<text>Olympiastadion () is a stadium located in Munich, Germany. Situated at the heart of the &quot;Olympiapark München&quot; in northern Munich, the stadium was built as the main venue for the 1972 Summer Olympics.

During the Olympics 70,824 tickets—including the unsaleable—were available for the events taking place in the stadium (including the opening and closing ceremonies). Yet, during the track and field competitions,
average audiences of 80,000 to 90,000 people were estimated daily. Also, the stadium has hosted many major football matches including the 1974 FIFA World Cup Final and the UEFA Euro 1988 Final—due to up to 5,000 additional short-term stands, the football World Cup Final in 1974 was attended by 75,200 spectators. The stadium also hosted European Cup Finals in 1979, 1993 and 1997. Its current capacity is 63,118 seated spectators. The stadium has also hosted various concerts, with capacity up to 77,337 depending on configuration.

Until the construction of Allianz Arena for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, the stadium was home to Bayern Munich and 1860 Munich. Football is still played at this venue, which is usually used for the Regionalliga Bayern club Türkgücü Munich. Unlike the Olympiastadion, the new stadium was purpose-built for football alone.

==Design==

Designed by the German architect Günther Behnisch and the engineer Frei Otto, with the assistance of John Argyris, the lightweight tent construction of the Olympiastadion was considered revolutionary for its time. This included large sweeping canopies of acrylic glass stabilized by steel cables that were used for the first time on a large scale. The idea was to imitate the Alps skyline and to set a counterpart to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, held during the Nazi regime. The sweeping and transparent canopy was designed to symbolize the new, democratic and optimistic West Germany. This concept was reflected in the official motto: &quot;The cheerful Games&quot; (&quot;Die Heiteren Spiele&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;DER SPIEGEL 35/1972&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Shortly after World War I, there were first considerations to build a large stadium in Munich, as football gained popularity. A stadium construction on Oberwiesenfeld failed in 1919, due to an objection by the Bavarian state. In 1921, the Teutoniaplatz was opened by the club FC Teutonia, with a capacity of 12,000. In the month after the opening, about 20,000 guests came to a game, which was almost twice the officially allowed capacity. The FC Bayern used the Teutoniaplatz for his home games from 1923 to 1925. Starting in 1911, the TSV 1860 played on the club&#x27;s own field at the Grünwalder Straße in Giesing, which became the largest stadium in Munich after it was expanded to a capacity of 40,000 spectators in 1926.

Although the capacity was sufficient for championship operation, the Teutoniaplatz was filled to its limits in international matches: the game Germany against Switzerland in 1926 showed that the demand for tickets in major events was a much higher than the allowed capacity. The 1928 opened fight course on the Dantestraße did not meet the expectations of a large stadium. For this reason, the construction of a large stadium on the outskirts of Munich, for example on Oberwiesenfeld, was discussed during the Weimar Republic, but did not yield any particular results.

In the early Nazi Germany, local politicians of the NSDAP planned the construction of a stadium west of Munich-Riem Airport with a capacity of 60,000 to 80,000, mirroring the Reichssportfeld in Berlin. However, the airport administration resisted and the Generalbaurat of Munich did not set it as a target. With the outbreak of World War II, the plans were finally rejected.

After the end of the war, the crowds flocked back to the football stadiums at weekends, including in Munich. In 1948, 58,200 spectators visited a game of TSV 1860 against 1. FC Nürnberg in the stadium on the Grünwalder road, intended for only 45,000 visitors. A year later, 57,000 spectators came to Munich for the semi-final match of the German Championship between Kaiserslautern and Borussia Dortmund. The postwar period is today considered the &quot;golden age&quot; of football in Germany; only since the 1990s, have so many visitors come to the German stadiums.

The Grünwalder Stadion, which was destroyed in the war, offered space for 50,000 spectators after the renovation, making it the largest stadium in Munich. However, the Municipal Sports Committee considered the capacity to be too low and sought to expand it to a capacity of 75,000 spectators. The Sports Committee received backlash from local media. For example, the Münchner Merkur asked for the construction of a new stadium on the Oberwiesenfeld in early 1951, after the extended grandstand of the Grünwalder Stadium would have made the construction of the planned Mittlerer Ring as the main access road to the Federal Highway 8 difficult. The major stadium project came to an end with the adoption of the so-called ten-year program on 10 March 1955 which promoted the construction of district sports facilities.

Another reason for this decision was the decreased popularity of football in Munich, after the formerly successful city clubs such as TSV 1860, FC Wacker and FC Bayern underperformed. Because of the small capacity of the Grünwalder Stadium, games of the Germany national team had not been held in Munich since 1940. For the big city clubs, the capacity of the Grünwalder stadium was adequate.

In 1958, the Bavarian party revived the talks of a large stadium. Both FC Bayern and the TSV 1860 resisted the project, fearing that the capacity would not be exhausted anyway. In 1963, in the last season before the introduction of the Bundesliga, the TSV 1860 won the league championship and therefore secured the starting place in the first league for the following season. In the first Bundesliga season, the TSV 1860 had an average of just under 32,000 spectators per game, which far exceeded the average of the previous years of about 20,000. In 1964, the TSV 1860 qualified for the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup 1964/65 by winning the DFB Cup in the preseason, and had constantly more than 30,000 spectators during the course of the competition. In the same year, the FC Bayern became champion of the Regionalliga Süd and qualified for the promotion round to the Bundesliga. The capacity of the Grünwalder Stadium once again proved to be too low. In the following season the TSV 1860 won the championship and FC Bayern the national cup competition. Although the average number of spectators was far lower than the maximum capacity of the Grünwalder Stadium, there were already numerous games in the mid-1960s at which the ticket demand was higher than the capacity of the stadium.

Munich was the only German city with two Bundesliga clubs, which at this time always played in the top table positions and were temporarily represented in international competitions. Therefore, the largest stadium in the city was now again found to be too small. In order to maintain the high level of the Munich football clubs, a larger stadium was considered necessary, because the audience still represented the main source of income of the clubs at that time.

Meanwhile, Georg Brauchle, then deputy Mayor of Munich, tried to bring the 1972 Summer Olympic Games to Munich. In October 1965, Mayor Hans-Jochen Vogel and Willi Daume, President of the West Germany National Olympic Committee, decided to test the city&#x27;s suitability for the Games. After further talks, among others with Federal Chancellor Ludwig Erhard and Bavaria&#x27;s Prime Minister Alfons Goppel, they came to the conclusion that an application for the 1972 Summer Olympics could be worthwhile. For this, however, a new and modern stadium had to be built for the city.

===Planning===

The three square kilometer and largely undeveloped Oberwiesenfeld was selected as the centerpiece of the Olympic Games. Due to the proximity to the city center, Munich was able to promote the games with the slogan &quot;Olympia of the short ways&quot;, which contributed to the decision-making process. Since the Oberwiesenfeld had served as a parade ground of the Bavarian cavalry regiment and later mainly military purposes, it was – except for armaments works – free of buildings. From 1931 to 1939 the Munich Airport was located on the Oberwiesenfeld. After the World War II, the debris rubble of the bombing of the city was piled up, from which the Olympic Mountain emerged. This was intentionally created in an oval shape, so that it could be used as a tribune foundation for a stadium.

In 1964, Munich opened an architectural competition for the planning of a large stadium, which was won by the offices of Henschker from Brunswick and Deiss from Munich. Their stadium design was integrated into an overall concept. In the planning of 1965, the stadium was planned to hold around 100,000 spectators, although later the capacity was reduced for the purpose of reusability. The plans were integrated into an overall concept, with the addition of a multi-purpose arena and a swimming pool on a large, concrete surface. Under the concrete slabs, supply systems and parking lots were to be built. On 26 April 1966, the IOC announced that Munich had prevailed against the other candidates Detroit, Madrid and Montreal. Thus the stadium construction was decided. The original plans of the Olympic Park and the stadium were criticized because of a lack of unity in the urban planning. In addition, the Association of German Architects suggested to avoid any monumentality at the sports facilities because of the Nazi past. The plans were finally rejected.

In February 1967, an architectural competition was again advertised, in which by the deadline of 3 July 1967 a total of 104 drafts were submitted, one of which came from the architectural firm Behnisch &amp; Partner. The architect Günter Behnisch and his employee Fritz Auer planned to build the stadium, the Olympic Hall and the swimming pool closely adjacent to each other west of the Olympic Tower, for which the base already existed. When a model was built at a scale of 1: 1000, the employee Cordel Wehrse came up with the idea of laying a tent roof construction over the three buildings. He had become aware of Frei Otto&#x27;s tent roof construction at the World Fair in Montreal through a newspaper article. Together with Carlo Weber and Heinz Isler the model was supplemented with wooden sticks and parts of a women&#x27;s stocking. The architects thought of the Olympic roof as a circus tent.

Finally, the model was submitted on the deadline. It was already eliminated after the first round by the jury, as it was considered too daring. However, the juror Egon Eiermann intervened and campaigned together with Mayor Hans-Jochen Vogel and NOK President Willi Daume, among others, for the model. Ultimately, the reviewers voted for the plan of Behnisch &amp; Partner, which emerged as the winner of the competition. The decision was announced on 13 October 1967. In addition to the stadium designed for 90,000 spectators, which was then reduced to 70,824 during the Olympic Games. The model convinced with its surrounding landscape architecture and the tent roof construction. Thus, it fulfilled the leitmotif of the games: human scale, lightness, bold elegance and unity of the landscape with nature. In addition, the possibility of reuse was given. Even with regard to short distances, the model convinced the jury.

===Erection===
To make room for the arena, the terminal building of the old airport had to be blown up. On 9 June 1969 work began on the stadium, the multi-purpose Olympic arena and swimming pool. However, it was only on 14 July 1969 with the laying of the cornerstone in a symbolic ceremony that the construction officially begun. In addition to the three buildings emerging on the Oberwiesenfeld, the Werner von Linde Hall, a volleyball hall, the Olympic Radstadion, the Olympic Village and various other buildings such as stations for U-Bahn and S-Bahn were built. During the time of the construction there was a spirit of optimism in Munich. The inner city received a pedestrian zone between Marienplatz and the Stachus and the metro was implemented. on the Oberwiesenfeld alone, there were 60 construction sites. From a total of 1.35 billion German marks, 137 million were used in the construction of the Olympic Stadium and another 170.6 million in the tent roof. About 5,000 construction workers worked at the construction site for more than one million hours. Contrary to the custom of German construction, the Olympic Stadium was built largely without prefabricated parts.

According to Behnisch, the stadium was to be a &quot;democratic sports venue&quot; according to the ideas of the Mayor of Munich Hans-Jochen Vogel and the specifications of the Federal Chancellor Willy Brandt, creating a contrast to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin during the period of National Socialism, the hitherto single summer Olympics in Germany. Since the time of National Socialism, Munich had the reputation of being the &quot;capital of the Nazi movement&quot;. The Olympics were intended to help improve Munich&#x27;s reputation. The foundation&#x27;s deed stated that the planned games should &quot;bear witness to the spirit of our people in the last third of the 20th century&quot;.

Behnisch wanted Frei Otto as a partner architect, whose tent roof construction at the EXPO 1967 in Montreal was a model for the stadium tent roof. Otto had already been involved in numerous construction projects with suspended and membrane structures and became the development consultant for the Olympiastadion tent roof construction. In addition to Behnisch and Otto, an architect team was also formed to realize the roof construction, including Fritz Leonhardt and Wolf Andrä. The planning management was done by Fritz Auer. Otto developed parts of the roof by means of the trial-and-error principle by making larger models of the roof construction, while Andrä and Leonhardt developed the roof with a CAD program elsewhere. Under the direction of civil engineer Jörg Schlaich, the roof over the stadium was completed on 21 April 1972. The current roof covers around 40,000 seats. Plans to cover an additional 15,000 seats in the eastern stands of the stadium - for the Olympic Games, respectively the football World Cup 1974 in West Germany - with a separate tent roof were initially developed by Behnisch and his architectural team from 1964 to 1967. But the additional roof was never completed; only the two main foundations to hold the roof were built, and they are still visible; one in each of the curves: behind, respectively under the existing roof. (In total some 60,000 seats would have been covered by the two separate tent roofs.)

Already in the summer of 1970 the shell of the buildings was finished and on 23 July 1970 the topping-out ceremony was celebrated. The plans for the stadium had forgotten to allocate cabins for football teams in the stadium interior. For this reason, from 24 May 1972 to the official opening of the stadium on 26 May 1972, two medical rooms were provisionally converted into changing rooms. There was enough room to set up a room for paramedics and referees as well. Later, the cabins were further equipped and remained in place. At the turn of the year 1971/1972 the main works were finished and at the end of June 1972 the finished buildings were handed over to the organizing committee. The planning, construction and financing of the buildings were controlled by the 1967 founded Olympia-Baugesellschaft mbH Munich, which was founded by the Federal Republic of Germany, the Free State of Bavaria and the City of Munich. The stadium is property of the Olympiapark München GmbH, a society wholly owned by the City of Munich&#x27;s Referat für Arbeit und Wirtschaft.

===Post Olympic legacy===

Following the Olympics, the stadium became the home of FC Bayern Munich. In 1979 the ground was host to the 1979 European Cup Final in which Nottingham Forest won the first of their consecutive European Cups.

In the 1990s Bayern Munich&#x27;s rivals TSV 1860 Munich moved into the stadium. The two teams coexisted in the &quot;Olympiastadion&quot; until 2005, when both clubs moved to the purpose built Allianz Arena.

Borussia Dortmund won the 1997 UEFA Champions League Final at the Olympiastadion.

On 6 to 11 August 2002 the 18th European Athletics Championships were held at the Olympiastadion.

Since 2005, it is the host of the yearly air and style snowboard event.

On 31 December 2006, the stadium made history as being the first venue to host the Tour de Ski cross-country skiing competition. The individual sprint events, held at 1100 m, were won by Norway&#x27;s Marit Bjørgen (women) and Switzerland&#x27;s Christoph Eigenmann (men). The snow was made in the stadium by combining the hot air with the cold refrigerated water that causes the snow to act like the icy type one would see in the Alps.

It was not used in the 2006 FIFA World Cup due to the Allianz Arena being the host stadium in Munich.

On 23 to 24 June 2007, the stadium was host to the Spar European Cup 2007, a yearly athletics event featuring the top 8 countries from around Europe.

The DTM touring car series held its first stadium event there in 2011: a Race of Champions-style event which took part over a two-day period, although it was not a championship scoring round. Edoardo Mortara won the first day, and Bruno Spengler the second. The event was repeated in 2012, but the stadium withdrew in 2013 because it proved impossible to turn it into a points-scoring event.

On 17 May 2012, the ground played host to the 2012 UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League Final in which Olympique Lyonnais won their second consecutive trophy. The attendance of that game was a record for a UEFA Women&#x27;s Champions League Final.
On 19 May 2012 it hosted the &quot;Public Viewing&quot; of the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final which took place at Allianz Arena in Munich.

In August 2020, it was announced that Türkgücü München who have been promoted into third division will be playing a couple of their home matches on the ground. 
On 10 October 2020, after more than eight years, Olympiastadion was due to host a professional football match of Türkgücü München against SV Wehen Wiesbaden.

The 2022 European Athletics Championships took place at the stadium.

The stadium was the setting of a skit for Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus in 1972, for The Philosophers&#x27; Football Match, in which Greek Philosophers played German Philosophers (plus Franz Beckenbauer) and the Greeks winning the game with a last-minute goal from Socrates. However, the skit was filmed instead at the Grünwalder Stadion.

Parts of the 1975 film &quot;Rollerball&quot; were shot on the (then) futuristic site surrounding the stadium.

The Olympic Stadium also hosted Motorcycle speedway when it held the 1989 World Final on 2 September 1989. Denmark&#x27;s Hans Nielsen won his third World Championship with a 15-point maximum from his five rides. Simon Wigg of England finished in second place after defeating countryman Jeremy Doncaster in a run-off to decide the final podium places after both had finished with 12 points from their five rides. Three time champion Erik Gundersen of Denmark finished in fourth place with 11 points. Gundersen, the defending World Champion, missed finishing outright second when his bike&#x27;s engine expired while he was leading Heat 9 of the World Final.

American rock band Guns N&#x27; Roses filmed parts of their &quot;Estranged&quot; video there when they visited Munich in June 1993.

In 2021, the stadium was visited during the fourth episode of the ninth season of Belgian reality series &quot;De Mol&quot; for a football-themed assignment.

The stadium is also used for American football.

<text>Hate Crew Deathroll is the fourth studio album by Finnish melodic death metal band Children of Bodom, released in 2003 under the Century Media label. It is the final Children of Bodom album to be recorded with all five original members, as their original rhythm guitarist, Alexander Kuoppala, would leave the band in 2003. It was successful both in Europe and the USA, which is demonstrated by the appearance of the &quot;Needled 24/7&quot; music video on MTV2&#x27;s Headbangers Ball. &quot;Needled 24/7&quot; also featured on the heavy metal documentary &quot;&quot; and the 2012 horror comedy video game &quot;Lollipop Chainsaw&quot;.

The track &quot;Angels Don&#x27;t Kill&quot; was included on the soundtrack of the 2009 video game &quot;Brütal Legend&quot; and the track &quot;Hate Crew Deathroll&quot; was included in the 2007 skateboarding video game &quot;Skate&quot;.

==Name==
Alexi Laiho had the letters COBHC (Children of Bodom Hate Crew) tattooed on his left hand fingers.

==Tracks==
With this album, the band&#x27;s sound became more condensed and less classical influenced, oriented more towards thrash metal and a harsher sound than previous albums. The keyboards were toned down as the guitars took hold as the more predominant instrument.

The tracks &quot;Sixpounder&quot; and &quot;Angels Don&#x27;t Kill&quot; are played in drop C (CGCFAD) tuning, which has the 6th (C) string tuned a step lower than the band&#x27;s usual step-down tuning.

The band shot a video for &quot;Needled 24/7&quot;, but it ended up being very expensive and did not turn out the way how they wanted. To make up for it, they shot the video for &quot;Sixpounder&quot;. This video has an edited version, in which the blood looks less realistic, and the license plate at the beginning just says &quot;COB 6 6&quot;. At the end of &quot;Needled 24/7&quot;, there is a quote: &quot;Death? What do y&#x27;all know about death?&quot; taken from the movie Platoon. The lyrics of &quot;Sixpounder&quot; are about sixpounder cannons.

&quot;You&#x27;re Better Off Dead&quot; was the only single from the CD. The single also contained a cover of the Ramones&#x27; &quot;Somebody Put Something in My Drink&quot;. It topped the Finnish singles chart and stayed in the top 20 for sixteen weeks.

&quot;Bodom Beach Terror&quot; includes a quote heard in the movie American Psycho: &quot;My pain is constant and sharp and I do not hope for a better world for anyone, in fact I want my pain to be inflicted on others.&quot; The quote can be heard at the end of the song. It continues at the beginning of the next track, &quot;Angels Don&#x27;t Kill&quot;, with &quot;I want no one to escape.&quot;

For the song &quot;Needled 24/7&quot; Alexi Laiho was dubbed in the top 50 for fastest guitarist of all time.

The booklet contains the lyrics for &quot;Needled 24/7&quot;, &quot;Chokehold (Cocked &#x27;n&#x27; Loaded)&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;re Better Off Dead&quot; and &quot;Hate Crew Deathroll&quot;.

The song &quot;Hate Crew Deathroll&quot; is only 3:36, but earlier pressings had a hidden track lasting 3 minutes and 2 seconds where, if heard at a high volume, the band are having a lively conversation in their native tongue of Finnish.

==Production==
After experimenting with a new producer, Peter Tägtgren on &quot;Follow the Reaper&quot;, the band turned back to their old producer, Anssi Kippo, with &quot;Hate Crew Deathroll&quot;. The album was mixed by Mikko Karmila, who had also mixed &quot;Hatebreeder&quot; and the second mix of &quot;Follow the Reaper&quot; and would later produce their next album, &quot;Are You Dead Yet?&quot;.

At this time, Children of Bodom were dealing with the issue that their contract with Spinefarm, which published their three earlier major albums, expired with &quot;Hate Crew Deathroll&quot;&#x27;s predecessor, &quot;Follow the Reaper&quot;. Furthermore, Spinefarm had been bought by the big company Universal Music Group in 2002, forcing the band to decide whether they would continue with Spinefarm, which would mean that their future albums would be released worldwide by UMG. They received several offers from various companies before their final decision to stay with Spinefarm (and thus UMG).

The contract with the &quot;new&quot; Spinefarm meant that Children of Bodom now had financial backing from one of the world&#x27;s largest record companies, UMG. This led to the band for the recording of &quot;Hate Crew Deathroll&quot; having access to production equipment of the highest quality, and as a result, the album also received praise for its production, having been described as &quot;crystal clear&quot; and &quot;sharp&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Hate Crew Deathroll&quot; debuted at number one on the Finnish album charts, where it remained for 2 weeks. In France, the album reached position 74 and stayed on the charts for 2 weeks. In Sweden, it reached position 36th after 2 weeks.

In Germany, the album debuted at position 45, but quickly fell to 68 and then to 92nd place before finally falling out of the list. After the release of &quot;Hate Crew Deathroll&quot;, the band experienced a growing interest from several leading mainstream media, such as MTV, where the video for the song &quot;Needled 24/7&quot; aired on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot;.

AllMusic has designated &quot;Hate Crew Deathroll&quot; as Children of Bodom&#x27;s best-ever album, describing it as an album that is &quot;particularly worth listening to&quot;.

As of November 2008, the album has sold 23,566 copies in Finland, and was certified gold the same year as it was released.

<doc id="928251" wikidata="Q3055477" url="?curid=928251" title="Girdwood, Anchorage, Alaska">
<text>Girdwood is a resort town within the southern extent of the Municipality of Anchorage in the U.S. state of Alaska. Located near the end of the Turnagain Arm of Cook Inlet, Girdwood lies in a valley in the southwestern Chugach Mountains, surrounded by seven glaciers feeding into a number of creeks, which either converge within the valley or empty directly into the arm. Girdwood is typically accessed by the Seward Highway (Milepost 90), with the main line of the Alaska Railroad paralleling the highway. By road distance, most of the community lies within of Downtown Anchorage. The 2019 American Community Survey estimates a population of 1,742 in the valley.

Founded as a community to supply miners during the Turnagain Arm gold rushes of the 1890s, Girdwood was mostly a small, quiet place until the middle of the 20th century. Two events drastically altered that. The first was the establishment of Alyeska Resort along the slopes of Mount Alyeska, which became an international destination coincidental with Anchorage&#x27;s civic promotion of itself as &quot;The Air Crossroads of the World&quot;. The second was the 1964 earthquake, which devastated the original townsite located directly along the arm. Following the earthquake, most of the town moved further up the valley to a new townsite, though a few homes remained and a strip mall was later constructed along the Seward Highway. Historically dominated in the years since the resort&#x27;s opening by seasonally-occupied vacation homes and seasonal activity at the resort, the opening of the Alyeska Prince Hotel during the 1990s has shifted the resort, and hence Girdwood as a whole, more towards year-round activity and a year-round economy. This has led to periodic debates about community growth and affordability of housing for resort workers, many of whom over the years have resorted to camping illegally on public lands.

Girdwood still revolves heavily around seasonal activity, with skiing and snowboarding at Alyeska Resort bringing visitors and their money into the community. Summer activities are also popular, which include hiking, fishing and rafting. The Girdwood Forest Fair, held every July, is the community&#x27;s most significant visitor attraction apart from resort-related activities. Girdwood is located within the northernmost extent of rain forest on Earth, and also serves as the closest point of access to Chugach National Forest from Anchorage proper.

==History==

Originally called &quot;Glacier City,&quot; Girdwood was founded as a supply camp for placer gold miners with claims along the creeks feeding Turnagain Arm. It was renamed for Colonel James Girdwood, a Belfast-born, Scots-Irish entrepreneur and linen merchant who staked the first four gold claims along Crow Creek in 1896.

The town was moved up the valley after the devastating Good Friday earthquake of 1964, when the land under the original townsite subsided into Turnagain Arm, putting much of the town below high tide. The nearby settlement of Alyeska was abandoned and most of its inhabitants moved to the new Girdwood townsite as well. The land has not all since been reclaimed, as one can still see inundated cabins in the marshy areas into which the city formerly extended. Significant earthquakes are a relatively common occurrence for Girdwood and the Kenai peninsula. Evidence indicates the area has seen six major quakes in the past 3,300 years.

Girdwood was incorporated as a city in 1961 and was absorbed into the Municipality of Anchorage in 1975, when the Greater Anchorage Area Borough unified with Anchorage and the borough&#x27;s smaller cities.

The town has served as a backdrop for at least two films: &quot;The Chechahcos&quot;, a 1924 silent film about the Klondike Gold Rush, and Warren Miller&#x27;s 1997 &quot;Snowriders II&quot;. Girdwood was the home of Alaska&#x27;s former senior U.S. Senator Ted Stevens, and Girdwood found itself in the media spotlight when the construction projects on Stevens&#x27; home became the subject of a federal investigation. Olympic gold and silver medal-winning skier Tommy Moe also called Girdwood home during his high school years, during which he attended Glacier Creek Academy.

Girdwood was shown on CBS on January 20, 2008, as the finish line for &quot;The Amazing Race 12&quot;.

==Geography==

===Climate===

According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Girdwood has a subarctic climate, abbreviated &quot;Dfc&quot; on climate maps.

==Demographics==

Girdwood first appeared on the 1950 U.S. Census as an unincorporated village. It formally incorporated as a city in 1961 and merged into Anchorage in 1975.

==Notable residents==

* Callan Chythlook-Sifsof (born 1989), Olympic snowboarder 
*Rosey Fletcher (born 1975), Olympic snowboarder
* Keegan Messing (born 1992), Canadian-American Olympic figure skater

<doc id="928254" wikidata="Q1061460" url="?curid=928254" title="Enterprise service bus">
<text>An enterprise service bus (ESB) implements a communication system between mutually interacting software applications in a service-oriented architecture (SOA). It represents a software architecture for distributed computing, and is a special variant of the more general client-server model, wherein any application may behave as server or client. ESB promotes agility and flexibility with regard to high-level protocol communication between applications. Its primary use is in enterprise application integration (EAI) of heterogeneous and complex service landscapes.

==Architecture==
The concept of the enterprise service bus is analogous to the bus concept found in computer hardware architecture combined with the modular and concurrent design of high-performance computer operating systems. The motivation for the development of the architecture was to find a standard, structured, and general purpose concept for describing implementation of loosely coupled software components (called services) that are expected to be independently deployed, running, heterogeneous, and disparate within a network. ESB is also a common implementation pattern for service-oriented architecture, including the intrinsically adopted network design of the World Wide Web.

No global standards exist for enterprise service bus concepts or implementations. Most providers of message-oriented middleware have adopted the enterprise service bus concept as &quot;de facto&quot; standard for a service-oriented architecture. The implementations of ESB use event-driven and standards-based message-oriented middleware in combination with message queues as technology frameworks. However, some software manufacturers relabel existing middleware and communication solutions as ESB without adopting the crucial aspect of a bus concept.

===Functions===
An ESB applies the design concept of modern operating systems to independent services running within networks of disparate and independent computers. Like concurrent operating systems, an ESB provides commodity services in addition to adoption, translation and routing of client requests to appropriate answering services.

The primary duties of an ESB are:
* Route messages between services
* Monitor and control routing of message exchange between services
* Resolve contention between communicating service components
* Control deployment and versioning of services
* Marshal use of redundant services
* Provide commodity services like event handling, data transformation and mapping, message and event queuing and sequencing, security or exception handling, protocol conversion and enforcing proper quality of communication service.

== History ==
The first published usage of the term &quot;enterprise service bus&quot; is attributed to Roy W. Schulte from the Gartner Group 2002 and the book &quot;The Enterprise Service Bus&quot; by David Chappell. Although a number of companies take credit for coining the phrase, in an interview, Schulte said that the first time he heard the phrase was from a company named Candle and went on to say: &quot;The most direct ancestor to the ESB was Candle’s Roma product from 1998&quot; whose Chief Architect and patent application holder was Gary Aven. Roma was first sold in 1998 making it the first commercial ESB in the market, but that Sonic&#x27;s product from 2002 was also one of the early ESBs on the market.

* Service - denotes non-iterative and autonomously executing programs that communicate with other services through message exchange
* Bus - is used in analogy to a computer hardware bus
* Enterprise - the concept has been originally invented to reduce complexity of enterprise application integration within an enterprise; the restriction has become obsolete since modern Internet communication is no longer limited to a corporate entity

===ESB as software===

The ESB is implemented in software that operates between the business applications, and enables communication among them. Ideally, the ESB should be able to replace all direct contact with the applications on the bus, so that all communication takes place via the ESB. To achieve this objective, the ESB must encapsulate the functionality offered by its component applications in a meaningful way. This typically occurs through the use of an enterprise message model. The message model defines a standard set of messages that the ESB transmits and receives. When the ESB receives a message, it routes the message to the appropriate application. Often, because that application evolved without the same message model, the ESB has to transform the message into a format that the application can interpret. A software adapter fulfills the task of effecting these transformations, analogously to a physical adapter.

ESBs rely on accurately constructing the enterprise message model and properly designing the functionality offered by applications. If the message model does not completely encapsulate the application functionality, then other applications that desire that functionality may have to bypass the bus, and invoke the mismatched applications directly. Doing so violates the principles of the ESB model, and negates many of the advantages of using this architecture.

The beauty of the ESB lies in its platform-agnostic nature and the ability to integrate with anything at any condition. It is important that Application Lifecycle Management vendors truly apply all the ESB capabilities in their integration products while adopting SOA. Therefore, the challenges and opportunities for EAI vendors are to provide an integration solution that is low-cost, easily configurable, intuitive, user-friendly, and open to any tools customers choose.
====Characteristics====
¹ &quot;Some do not regard process choreography as an ESB function. For example, see M.Richards.

² &quot;While process choreography supports implementation of complex business processes that require coordination of multiple business services (usually using BPEL), service orchestration enables coordination of multiple implementation services (most suitably exposed as an aggregate service) to serve individual requests.&quot;

These solutions often focus on low-level ESB functions, such as connectivity, routing and transformation, and require coding or scripting to implement orchestration. Developers operating at a project or tactical level, e.g., just trying to fix a problem, often gravitate toward lightweight service bus technologies, but there is often ongoing tension between these initiatives and an enterprise architecture whose goal it is to optimize infrastructure across multiple projects.

If the message broker, the ESB software, translates a message from one format to another, then as with any translation, there is the issue of semantics of the message. For example, a record can be translated from JSON to XML, but the same set of fields can be interpreted differently by different applications, specifically in the case of the various corner cases that are usually known only to developers that have extensive experience with the application that is connected to the ESB. For the known corner cases the number of tests that cover all corner cases increases exponentially with every application that is connected to the ESB, because every ESB-connected application must be tested against every other application that is connected to the ESB.

==Key benefits==

* Scales from point-solutions to enterprise-wide deployment (distributed bus)
* More configuration rather than integration coding
* No central rules-engine, no central broker
* Easy plug-in and plug-out and loosely coupling system

==Key disadvantages==
* Slower communication speed, especially for those already compatible services
* Single point of failure, can bring down all communications in the Enterprise
* High configuration and maintenance complexity

<doc id="928264" wikidata="Q2723418" url="?curid=928264" title="Andrew Symonds">
<text>Andrew Symonds (9 June 1975 – 14 May 2022) was an Australian international cricketer, who played all three formats as a batting all-rounder. Commonly nicknamed &quot;Roy&quot;, he was a key member of two World Cup–winning squads. Symonds was a part of the team that won both the 2003 Cricket World Cup and, four years later, the 2007 Cricket World Cup. Symonds played as a right-handed, middle-order batsman and alternated between medium pace and off-spin bowling. He was also notable for his exceptional fielding skills.

After mid-2008, Symonds spent significant time out of the team due to disciplinary reasons, including alcohol abuse. In June 2009, he was sent home from the 2009 World Twenty20, his third suspension, expulsion or exclusion from selection in the space of a year. His central contract was then withdrawn, and many cricket analysts speculated that the Australian administrators would no longer tolerate him and that Symonds might announce his retirement. Symonds eventually retired from all forms of professional cricket in February 2012, to concentrate on his family life.

In 2022, Symonds died in a single-vehicle car crash at Hervey Range, outside Townsville, Queensland. He was 46.

==Early life==
One of Symonds&#x27; birth parents was of an Afro-Caribbean background, while the other was believed to be of Scandinavian descent. Symonds was adopted by parents Ken and Barbara at three months of age, and they moved to Australia when he was a toddler. He had three siblings. His sister, Louise Symonds, who was also adopted, was a contestant on the Australian &quot;Gladiators&quot; television series in 2008. He spent the early part of his childhood in Charters Towers, northern Queensland, where his father taught at the private All Souls St Gabriels School, which Symonds attended. He showed sporting prowess from a very early age. &quot;Dad was cricket mad,&quot; Symonds said. &quot;He&#x27;d throw balls to me five or six days a week, before school, after school. And we&#x27;d play all sorts of games inside the house with ping-pong balls and Christmas decorations.&quot; His early junior cricket was played in Townsville for the Wanderers club, with the father-and-son duo making the 270-kilometre return trip sometimes twice a week. In 1988, Symonds&#x27; father accepted a deputy headmaster role at All Saints Anglican School, and the family subsequently relocated to the Gold Coast when Symonds was 12 years of age. He attended the school and continued his junior cricket at Palm Beach Currumbin. A few years later, Symonds made his Queensland Premier Cricket debut for the Gold Coast Dolphins as a 15-year-old and hit a remarkable double century in his first game.

==Overview of cricket career==
Symonds was an aggressive right-handed batsman who could also bowl off spin or medium pace, making him a solid all-rounder. He was an exceptional fielder, with a report prepared by ESPNcricinfo in late 2005 showing that since the 1999 Cricket World Cup, he had effected the equal-fifth-most run-outs in One Day International (ODI) cricket of any fieldsman, with the fourth-highest success rate, with Ricky Ponting rating him the best fielder he had seen, and a better and more versatile one than Herschelle Gibbs and Jonty Rhodes because Symonds was taller than them, giving him better defensive coverage range and had greater throw power outside the circle. He was very agile for his size and weight (medium-heavy build; 187 cm tall), had excellent reflexes, was able to take catches well and had a powerful and accurate throwing arm. His nickname was Roy, shortened from the name Leroy, after a coach from early in his career believed he resembled local Brisbane basketball player Leroy Loggins. He was an AIS Australian Cricket Academy scholarship holder in 1994.
In 1995, after playing in his first season for English county Gloucestershire, Symonds won the Cricket Writer&#x27;s Club Young Cricketer of the Year award. Shortly afterwards, Symonds was selected as part of the England A team that was to tour Pakistan in the winter; however, he decided not to go, instead choosing to pursue an international career for Australia. His place on the tour was later taken by Middlesex player Jason Pooley.

==Domestic cricket==
===Australian state cricket===
Symonds scored more than 5,000 runs and took more than 100 wickets for the Queensland state team. He scored 113 and took four wickets in a losing cause in the final of the 1998–99 Sheffield Shield season, and was named man of the match in the 2002 Pura Cup final after scoring 123 runs and taking six wickets.

===English counties===
Symonds played for four English counties during his career—Gloucestershire, Kent, Lancashire and Surrey. His first appearance for an English county was with Gloucestershire. Initially, he was considered an England-qualified player; however, following his first season of county cricket in 1995, he declared that his allegiances lay with Australia when he chose not to tour Pakistan with the England A team.

In August 1995, he hit a record 16 sixes in his unbeaten 254 against Glamorgan at Abergavenny. In doing so, he beat the previous mark set by New Zealand&#x27;s John R. Reid. &quot;Wisden&quot; reported that the 16th six &quot;landed on a tennis court about over the boundary&quot; and &quot;though he was undoubtedly helped by the short boundaries, it would have been a hugely effective innings on any ground in the world&quot;. The record was equalled by Graham Napier for Essex against Surrey in 2011, and stood until May 2022 when Ben Stokes hit 17 sixes in an innings for Durham against Worcestershire. Symonds added four more sixes in the second innings, to beat the old record of 17 in a match, set by Warwickshire&#x27;s Jim Stewart against Lancashire at Blackpool in 1959.

In July 2005, he signed for Lancashire for the rest of the English season having finished duties as part of Australia&#x27;s ODI squad. In April 2010, he signed for Surrey to play in the Friends Provident t20 competition.

==== Kent ====
Between 1999 and 2004, Symonds played for Kent. He joined the club as an overseas player for the first time ahead of the 1999 County Championship and was also brought in as an injury replacement for Daryll Cullinan during the 2001 County Championship.

He eventually made his mark in T20 cricket which was in its early days during his stint with Kent. He also featured for Kent in the inaugural edition of the 2003 Twenty20 Cup and played an influential knock of an unbeaten 96 runs off just 37 balls with a strike rate of 259.45 against Hampshire in a group stage match. His knock which came at a strike rate of over 250 was a surprise given that T20 cricket was in its very early days. His knock sealed the deal for Kent as the modest target of 146 was reached within just 12 overs.

Some of his highlights came on 2 July 2004 when he hit a 43-ball 112 for Kent Spitfires in a Twenty20 Cup match against Middlesex Crusaders. He scored 112 in 37 minutes and his century, which came at 34 balls, was the then world record for the fastest ever century in T20 cricket. His record stood for nine years before being surpassed by Chris Gayle, during the 2013 Indian Premier League, who did it in 30 balls. Symonds&#x27; knock comprised a flurry of boundaries including 18 fours and three sixes which came at a strike rate of 260.46 and his knock helped Kent to win the rain-affected match convincingly by seven wickets with 29 balls to spare.

He appeared in 49 first-class matches for Kent, scoring 3,526 runs for the club at an average of 45.20, including 12 centuries, and also taking 65 wickets. He also played in 62 List A matches for Kent, scoring 1,690 runs at an average of 30.17, and took 69 wickets at an average of 21.53. In 2020, Kent supporters named him as the club&#x27;s Greatest Overseas Player in the white ball format.

===Indian Premier League===
In February 2008, Symonds was signed by the Indian Premier League (IPL) franchise Deccan Chargers for US$1,350,000, which made him the second-most-expensive player in the league at that time. During the 2008 competition, Symonds scored 117 not out from 53 balls against Rajasthan Royals. The Royals ended up winning the game, with Symonds conceding 19 runs from the final over, with 17 required to win. Symonds started the third season convincingly, scoring two 50s in his first three games with the side in 2010. The following year he was contracted by Mumbai Indians for US$850,000.

==International career==
===Emergence and 2003 World Cup===
Although Symonds was originally qualified to play for England due to its being the country of his birth, and West Indies due to his ancestry, in 1995 he decided that he wished to pursue an international career for Australia instead. His international debut came on 10 November 1998, when he played in a One Day International (ODI) for Australia against Pakistan at Lahore. As an ODI player, he was known for scoring runs at an excellent strike rate of over 90, with a highest score of 156.

However, at the start of his international career, Symonds struggled to make an impact with the bat and ball, although his fielding was of high quality, and was not a regular member of the playing XI. Symonds was named in Australia&#x27;s 2003 Cricket World Cup squad. After all-rounder Shane Watson had to withdraw due to injury, Shane Warne was sent home after failing a drugs test, and with Darren Lehmann still serving a suspension for racial abuse, Symonds made his way into the starting XI. According to former England cricketer Adam Hollioake, Symonds would not have made the 2003 World Cup squad if he had not received backing from captain Ponting.

In the first match against Pakistan, Symonds scored 143 not out to guide Australia from 4/86 to 8/310 en route to an 82-run victory, a performance described by Kanta Murali of &quot;The Hindu&quot; as &quot;one of the best knocks in one-day cricket history&quot;. The innings went on to become the turning point of his career. In the semi-final against Sri Lanka, Symonds top scored with 91 not out and was named Player of the Match, as Australia won by 48 runs. With Australia&#x27;s defeat of India in the final, they claimed their third World Cup triumph, becoming the first team to go undefeated in an edition of the tournament. Following this breakthrough, &quot;The Age&quot; described Symonds &quot;as a true one-day star&quot;, who had &quot;become an essential part of the one-day team.&quot;

He batted in five innings during the victorious 2003 World Cup campaign where he made 326 runs at an average of 163. He was also the third leading runscorer for Australia during the World Cup campaign just behind Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden. He remained unbeaten in three of the five innings and his only failure with the bat in the tournament was against England where he was dismissed for a duck.

===ODI regular, Test debut===
A tour of the West Indies followed, with Symonds playing all seven ODIs, scoring half-centuries in the third and fifth matches. He ended as Australia&#x27;s top run scorer in a 4–3 series victory.

In March 2004, Symonds made his Test debut in Australia&#x27;s tour of Sri Lanka, with the selectors citing his bowling and his power hitting against spin bowlers as &quot;ideal&quot; for the subcontinent conditions. He replaced Simon Katich, who had scored a century and unbeaten fifty in Australia&#x27;s previous Test. Playing as a batsman, Symonds encountered difficulty against Muttiah Muralitharan on the dusty, spinning Sri Lankan tracks, failing to pass 25 in any of his four innings, and was dropped after two Test matches in favour of Katich.

He was recalled in November 2005 for South Africa&#x27;s tour of Australia, following an injury to Shane Watson, as Australia&#x27;s search for an all-rounder continued. After five Tests, with a batting average of 12.62 and a bowling average of 85.00, he was under pressure to retain his place in the team going into the 2005 Boxing Day Test. On the first day of the match, he was out caught behind for a golden duck. But Symonds then took 3/50 in the South African first innings, before hitting 72 off 54 balls in the second innings and taking 2/6 with the ball. For his performances in 2005, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.

At the 2006 Allan Border Medal count, Symonds would have won the One Day Player of the Year award as he polled the most votes, but was ineligible due to having been suspended because of a drinking binge during the 2005 Ashes tour.

Symonds played every ODI in the tri-nation 2005–06 VB Series. He was named Player of the Match twice in the group stage: once as he hit a half-century in the opening game, and then again after scoring 32 and taking three wickets, both in victories over Sri Lanka. He also scored a second half-century, reaching 65 in a win over South Africa.

Having won six of their eight group stage games, Australia qualified for the best-of-three final, once again facing Sri Lanka, who finished second in the group table. After going down 1–0 in the opening match, Symonds put up 151, including 13 fours and three sixes. He shared a big partnership with Ricky Ponting as Australia recorded 5/368, setting their highest ever ODI score. Symonds was named Player of the Match once again. After Australia secured victory in the third game of the final, Symonds won Player of the Series honours, having scored 389 runs and recorded 11 wickets. For his performances in 2006, he was named as 12th man in the World ODI XI by the ICC.

After South Africa&#x27;s tour of Australia, the teams both headed to South Africa in February 2006 for another series there. Symonds missed the first three ODIs through injury, but returned in the fourth with a score of 76, to help Australia chase down a score of 246, and tie the series at 2–2. In the fifth and final ODI, Symonds contributed 27* as Australia broke the world record score for an ODI, with 434. But in what was billed &quot;The greatest the world has seen&quot; by &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, South Africa successfully chased and broke the new world record, setting a new high of 438, with 1 wicket and 1 ball to spare.

While batting in the second Test of the tour, Symonds was struck in the face of his helmet by a bouncer off Makhaya Ntini. Symonds required four stitches on the inside of his upper lip. After scoring just 101 runs and claiming one wicket in the three Test series, Symonds found himself dropped from the Test team for the subsequent tour of Bangladesh, with Michael Clarke taking his place.

===2007 World Cup===
Following the retirement of Damien Martyn during the 2006–07 Ashes, Symonds was again recalled to the team. Although he scored just 26 and 2 in his first Test back, he retained his place in the team for the second match. In the Boxing Day Test, Symonds arrived at the crease with Australia at 5/84. After a slow start to his innings he proceeded to score his maiden Test century, combining with Matthew Hayden to put on a 279 run partnership and bringing up the century with a six. Symonds was finally dismissed for 156.

Although selected in Australia&#x27;s 15-member World Cup squad he was unavailable for selection for the first few matches because he ruptured his biceps while batting against England on 2 February 2007 in the Commonwealth Bank Tri Series. Surgery was performed and Symonds underwent extensive physical rehabilitation. As a result, he missed the remainder of that tournament as well as the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy in New Zealand, while Australia suffered their longest losing streak in over a decade.

Symonds remarkably made a relatively quick recovery after returning for Australia&#x27;s win in their last preliminary World Cup match against South Africa. Australia reached the final, where they faced Sri Lanka. In a rain-affected game, shortened to 38/36 overs per side, Symonds scored 23 not out during Australia&#x27;s innings, and bowled the final ball of the tournament to seal victory in a contest that concluded in near-total darkness.

===Allegations of racial taunts===
In 2007, crowds at the One Day Series in Vadodara, Nagpur and Mumbai were seen to offend Symonds with monkey chants. After the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) initially denied the incident at Vadodara took place (claiming it was a confusion with worshipping Hanuman the monkey god), further incidents occurred at the other grounds in the series.

During the subsequent Sri Lankan tour of Australia in late 2007, Symonds had good form with the bat but suffered an ankle injury, which ruled him out for the remainder of the Test series. He then returned for 2007–08 Australia–India series.

During the second Test against India on 2 January 2008, Symonds completed his second Test century. He came to the crease with Australia struggling at 119/4. After his initial partners, Michael Clarke (1) and then Adam Gilchrist (7), were dismissed in quick succession, Australia found themselves in dire shape at 134/6. Symonds and Brad Hogg then put on a record 7th wicket partnership at the Sydney Cricket Ground (also a record for Australia vs. India) of 173 until Hogg was dismissed for 79. At stumps on the first day, Symonds was not out on 137, and Australia 376/7. By the end of the innings, Symonds finished on 162 not out, when the Australians were finally bowled out for 463. He further went on to score 62 not out in the second innings. In January 2008, Indian spin bowler Harbhajan Singh received a three-match ban after a complaint that he had racially abused Symonds during the third day of the Second Test at the SCG. It was alleged that Harbhajan called Symonds a &quot;monkey&quot; after Symonds confronted him over touching fellow Australian player Brett Lee. The case was decided by the match referee, Mike Procter, in a hearing held after the match.

On 29 January 2008, after the hearing of the appeal, at Adelaide by ICC appeals commissioner John Hansen, the racism charge on Harbhajan Singh was not proved and the three Test ban was lifted. However, a lesser charge (Level 2.8 offence) of using abusive language was applied and Harbhajan was fined 50% of his match fee. Hansen later admitted that he &quot;could have imposed a more serious penalty if he was made aware by the ICC of the bowler&#x27;s previous transgressions&quot;—including a suspended one Test Match ban. The ICC claimed the &quot;database and human errors ... played a part in Harbhajan Singh escaping a more severe penalty during his appeal hearing in Adelaide&quot;.
Hansen also criticised Symonds in his report accusing him of swearing at Harbhajan after a friendly gesture by the Indian bowler towards Brett Lee. It was also reported that senior players had written a letter to John Hansen requesting a downgrading of the charge. The letter was signed by Sachin Tendulkar and Ricky Ponting and counter-signed by Michael Clarke, Matthew Hayden and Symonds. The stump microphone audio was removed immediately after the alleged incident between Harbhajan Singh and Andrew Symonds was released by Channel Nine.

In his 2013 autobiography &quot;At the Close of Play&quot;, Ricky Ponting expressed his disillusionment with Cricket Australia for failing to support Symonds, who, though the victim of abuse, was painted as a villain. Daniel Brettig notes how, &quot;duly disillusioned&quot;, Symonds &quot;drifted from the game via a series of disciplinary problems&quot;.

===International career draws to a close===
During the second final of the 2007–08 Commonwealth Bank Series against India on 4 March 2008, Symonds shoulder charged a male streaker who had entered the playing arena. Symonds, who had once considered a career in rugby league with the Brisbane Broncos, may have faced assault charges had the man taken legal action.

Symonds was set to play for Australia in the August 2008 series against Bangladesh in Darwin, but was sent home to Queensland after missing a team meeting while out fishing. Stand-in captain Michael Clarke told the media that Symonds would have to re-evaluate his desire to represent Australia: &quot;The main concern from us is Andrew&#x27;s commitment, to playing for this team and, in my opinion and I know the rest of the leadership team&#x27;s opinion, you need to be committed 100 per cent.&quot; As a further punishment for his misadventure, Symonds was not selected for the Australian tour of India in October 2008.

After Australia lost the test series in India 2–0, Symonds was recalled for the Test series against New Zealand in November 2008. He did not play any significant role in the first Test, which Australia won. After the Test, on 22 November, Symonds was reported to have been involved in a pub brawl with another patron who had attempted to hug him and have his photo taken with the cricketer. He was subsequently cleared by Cricket Australia to play in the second test. He then played in the first two tests of the next series against South Africa but performed poorly and was omitted from the team for the third test due to injury; at the same time, many critics called for his omission on performance grounds. Nonetheless, for his performances in 2008, he was named in the World ODI XI by the ICC.

In January 2009, Symonds gave an interview with sports comedians Roy &amp; HG, in which he made remarks about the acquisition of New Zealand cricketer Brendon McCullum by the New South Wales Blues to play in the KFC Twenty20 final against Victoria despite McCullum&#x27;s not having played at all for the Blues previously. Sounding intoxicated, Symonds called McCullum a &quot;lump of shit&quot; declaring that having dinner at the home of teammate Matthew Hayden was enjoyable because he could glance at Hayden&#x27;s wife. The interview led to his being charged with violating the Cricket Australia code of conduct. Following a hearing with general manager Michael Brown, he was fined $4,000, instructed to work with a psychologist, and indefinitely barred from selection until he was deemed to have been successfully rehabilitated.

In the meantime Symonds continued to play for Queensland, but was not selected by Australia, missing three five-match series against South Africa, New Zealand and South Africa respectively. He was finally recalled in April to play ODIs against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates,
but was not selected for the 2009 Ashes series, with young all-rounders Shane Watson, Andrew McDonald and Marcus North being preferred.

In early June 2009, Symonds was sent home from the ICC World Twenty20 tournament in England following &quot;an alcohol-related incident&quot;. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland called a press conference to announce Symonds&#x27; dismissal, which marked the end of his international cricket career. His Cricket Australia contract was also reviewed and later cancelled.

In June 2009, Symonds told Channel Nine&#x27;s &quot;Sixty Minutes&quot; that he was not an alcoholic but a binge-drinker. &quot;I go out and drink hard all in one hit – too fast, too much&quot;, he said.

;Records and achievements
Symonds previously held the world records for the most sixes hit during a first-class innings (16) and during a first-class match (20), both set while playing for Gloucestershire against Glamorgan as a 20-year-old. His first innings score was 254 not out.

At the time of his death, Symonds was one of only 22 players to have scored over 5,000 runs and taken more than 100 wickets in ODI cricket and one of only three Australians to have done so. His batting average of 100 runs per inning in World Cup matches was also the highest of any player in that competition.

In 2007, he was named as an all-rounder in Australia&#x27;s all-time &quot;greatest ODI team&quot;.

==Rugby league==
Symonds was a keen supporter of the Brisbane Broncos since childhood and was considering a switch to rugby league in 2002 when his cricket career was faltering. On 21 June 2009, he played a game for the Wynnum Manly Seagulls against an all-star team featuring some noted players, including Marcus Bai and Steve Renouf. He also trained with the Brisbane Broncos.

==Media==
Symonds made a cameo in the 2011 Bollywood movie &quot;Patiala House&quot;. In 2011, he was a guest contestant on the Indian reality series &quot;Bigg Boss&quot;. Pooja Mishra, who had already been eliminated from the show, returned to act as a translator for Symonds.

Symonds worked as a guest commentator for &quot;Big Bash&quot; matches between the 2016–17 and 2018–19 seasons.

==Death==
Symonds was killed in a single-vehicle road accident at Hervey Range, outside of Townsville, Queensland, on 14 May 2022, at the age of 46. Queensland Police said in a statement that Symonds was driving on Hervey Range Road near the Alice River Bridge when his car left the road and rolled at around 10:30 pm local time. Symonds was the only occupant of the car. Paramedics responded and attempted to revive him, but Symonds was pronounced dead at the scene.

A minute&#x27;s silence was observed at the start of the final day of the match between two of Symonds&#x27; former English clubs, Kent and Surrey, which was taking place when he died. A silence was also observed before the start of the first day&#x27;s play of the first Test between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in Chattogram.

A tribute campaign, called &quot;Fishing Rods for Roy&quot;, was launched in memory of Symonds, referring to his interest in fishing. Cricket fans throughout Australia were encouraged to leave fishing rods and cricket balls outside the front of their houses as a nationwide tribute, one which mirrored the tributes after the death of Phillip Hughes in 2014.

<text>Michael Scott Kasprowicz (born 10 February 1972) is a former Australian international cricketer, who played all formats of the game. He is a right arm fast bowler. He represented Queensland and played in the English county scene at first class level.

==Personal life==
A past student of Brisbane State High School, Kasprowicz is the older brother of former professional rugby union player Simon Kasprowicz. He holds a Masters of Business Administration from the University of Queensland. Kasprowicz is also a father to three children. His father is from Poland.

==Domestic career==
Kasprowicz made his debut for Queensland as a seventeen-year-old in the 1989/90 domestic season. He was an AIS Australian Cricket Academy scholarship holder in 1990/91.

In 1991, Kasprowicz played for the Australian Under-19 team which was captained by Damien Martyn. In the 1991/92 season, Kasprowicz became the youngest Australian to take 50 first-class wickets.

Kasprowicz represented Mumbai Champs in the Indian Cricket League. Kasprowicz&#x27;s name was not added to the list of national contract awardees announced by the ACB on 1 May 2007.

==International career==
His solid performances for Queensland earned him a Test debut against West Indies in his native Brisbane in November 1996. However, he would go through his first two Test matches for Australia wicketless.

Kasprowicz played in all the Tests on the tours of Sri Lanka and India in 2004, which were won 3–0 and 2–1. After being in and out of the side since his debut, Kasprowicz returned in 2004 to hold down a regular spot ahead of Brett Lee.

In the 2005 Ashes, Kasprowicz almost pulled off an escape for the Australian team in the second test at Edgbaston. On the final day England needed one last wicket with Kasprowicz and Brett Lee at the crease. However the two batsmen had edged Australia to within two runs of England. But then Kasprowicz gloved a Steve Harmison ball to Geraint Jones and England won. Though TV replays showed the dismissal should not have been given as Kasprowicz took his lower hand off the bat before ball hit glove. After the 2005 Ashes loss to England, Kasprowicz was dropped from the Australian team and his Cricket Australia contract was not extended. However, he had a successful 2005/06 domestic season with Queensland, taking 44 wickets. This effort earned him a tenth recall to the national side to replace Glenn McGrath as Brett Lee&#x27;s new ball partner.

On 8 February 2008 he announced his retirement from all forms of cricket effective 16 February. Kasprowicz&#x27;s best Test batting score of 25 was made against India, Kolkata, 1997–1998. His best Test bowling figures of 7 for 36 came against England, The Oval, 1997. Kasprowicz&#x27;s best ODI Batting score of 28 not out was made against England, Lord&#x27;s, 1997. His best ODI bowling figures of 5 for 45 came against Sri Lanka, Colombo, 2003–2004.

==Post-retirement==
Kasprowicz has been a director at Cricket Australia since 2011, although he briefly resigned from that position in 2016 to serve as interim CEO of Queensland Cricket.

<doc id="928267" wikidata="Q349135" url="?curid=928267" title="Ian Healy">
<text>Ian Andrew Healy (born 30 April 1964) is an Australian former international cricketer who played for Queensland domestically. A wicketkeeper and right-hand middle-order batsman, he first played international cricket in 1988, after six first-class games. Over the next decade, Healy was a member of the side as it enjoyed a period of success. By the time of his retirement, Healy held the world record for most Test dismissals by a wicket-keeper. He was a part of the Australian squad which finished as runners-up at the 1996 Cricket World Cup.

All of his four first-class centuries were scored in Test matches. In one day internationals, he averaged 21 while scoring at a rate of 83.8 runs per hundred balls. He captained Australia in eight one day internationals when the regular skipper Mark Taylor was injured.

== Early life ==
Born in the Brisbane suburb of Spring Hill, Healy was educated at Brisbane State High School. Healy and his family relocated north to the small town of Biloela in 1972, due to his father&#x27;s transfer in his job as a bank manager. Rod Marsh inspired Healy to take up wicket-keeping; he also played basketball, soccer, squash and rugby league. He represented the Queensland under-11 team and later attended a clinic conducted by the touring Queensland cricketers. The team&#x27;s wicket-keeper John Maclean gave him some specialist coaching, which gave his junior career further impetus.

During his later years in the town, Healy played alongside adults, which accelerated his progress. Returning to Brisbane with his family at the age of 17 he played for Brisbane State High School 1st XI and 1st XV. He then joined the Northern Suburbs club in Brisbane&#x27;s grade competition in 1982. After three matches for the Queensland Colts as a specialist batsman, Healy made his first-class debut in 1986–87 as a replacement for the injured Peter Anderson. However, Anderson remained the first choice as the state&#x27;s wicketkeeper for the next eighteen months, during which time Healy managed only six first-class appearances.

== International career ==
Given his small number of games for Queensland, Healy&#x27;s selection for the Australian team to tour Pakistan in late 1988 was a major surprise. The wicket-keeping position had proved a problem for Australia since the 1984 retirement of Healy&#x27;s boyhood hero, Rod Marsh. Wayne B. Phillips, Tim Zoehrer, Greg Dyer and Steve Rixon had all been tried with little success. Australian selector Greg Chappell had watched Healy&#x27;s progress in Queensland, and believed that he offered the lower-order batting stability and determined approach to the game that the Australian team was lacking.

By his own admission, Healy was overwhelmed by his sudden elevation and took some time to settle into the team. The selectors persevered with him through the difficult Pakistan tour and the subsequent home series against the West Indies, even though Australia lost both series.

An improvement in the team&#x27;s performances coincided with Healy&#x27;s establishment as a Test-class player. On the tour of England in 1989, he was safe behind the stumps in taking 14 Test catches, but averaged only 17.16 with the bat, as Australia won 4–0 to regain the Ashes. In seven Tests against New Zealand, Sri Lanka and Pakistan during the extended season of 1989–90, Healy accepted 23 catches and recorded a top score of 48.

=== First century ===

Although Australia lost the series with the West Indies and drew with New Zealand in 1992–93, the team had a successful tour of England in 1993 when Healy hit his maiden Test century. His form had gradually improved, culminating in an unbeaten 102 at Old Trafford when he dominated a partnership with Steve Waugh. With the introduction to the team of Shane Warne, Healy was able to demonstrate his skills standing up to the stumps and reading the varied deliveries of the spinner. In his first 39 Tests, Healy stumped two batsmen. In 14 Tests between 1992 and 1993, he stumped ten batsmen while taking 52 catches.

Healy followed up with another century, against New Zealand at Perth in 1993–94. Healy was also well known for his energy and optimism behind the stumps, and could frequently be heard on effects microphones encouraging the rest of the team, perhaps most prominently praise of Shane Warne, expressed as &#x27;bowling, Warnie&#x27;. Notable too was his attitude to injuries; despite breaking all of his fingers during his thirteen-year career he only ever missed one Test match, replaced by Phil Emery in Pakistan.

Healy twice captained an Australian XI, in tour matches against the West Indians in 1991–92 and 1992–93. In 1993, he led an official Australian team at the Hong Kong six-a-side tournament and replaced Allan Border as captain of Queensland in 1992–93. However, when Border retired at the end of the 1994 tour of South Africa, Healy was not seen as viable successor as Australian captain for two reasons. Firstly, only one wicket-keeper had led Australia in the previous one hundred years. Secondly, his various on-field confrontations were sometimes held against him.

=== Omitted from One Day Internationals team ===
Australia made the much-debated decision to separate the teams for playing Tests and ODIs for the 1997–98 season. This affected Healy and the captain, Mark Taylor, both of whom were dropped from the ODI team. Sri Lanka won the 1996 World Cup utilising a strategy of ultra-aggressive opening batsmen hitting as many runs as possible in the early overs of the innings. Adam Gilchrist, a wicket-keeper himself, had displayed the potential to play this type of game since his ODI debut the previous year. Gilchrist then became the ODI team&#x27;s wicket-keeper as well, allowing Australia to play an extra specialist (bowler or batsman) in the batting place previously occupied by Healy. Both Healy and Taylor made their disappointment with the decision known. However, Gilchrist hit a brilliant century during the finals of the Carlton and United Series, which Australia won after failing to qualify for the previous season. Healy finished his ODI career with a world record 233 dismissals, a mark since overtaken by Gilchrist, Mark Boucher, Moin Khan, Kumar Sangakkara and M.S.Dhoni.

Healy maintained his Test place, beginning the season with scores of 68 at Brisbane and 85 at Perth against New Zealand. His only other innings of substance was 46 not out against South Africa in the second Test at Sydney. On the subsequent tour of India, Healy top-scored with 90 in the first Test at Chennai, which Australia lost.

===World records===
On 4 October 1998, Healy broke Rod Marsh&#x27;s world record of 355 dismissals when he caught Wasim Akram from the bowling of Colin Miller, during the first Test against Pakistan at Rawalpindi. It was his 104th Test compared with Marsh&#x27;s 96 Tests. Healy ended with 395 dismissals from 119 Tests. This tally was subsequently overtaken by South African wicketkeeper Mark Boucher (in his 103rd test, 16 fewer than Healy) and other Australian wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist in his 96th Test which was his last. Boucher is currently the world record holder.

Healy also jointly holds the record in Test cricket (along with Mark Taylor) of being the only cricketers to have been run out in both innings of a Test on two occasions. Unfortunately, he played most ODIs for Australia without winning the Cricket World Cup.

===Anticlimactic farewell===
After four months off, the Australian team toured Sri Lanka in August and September 1999. In the three Tests, Healy made only 25 runs and took four catches. The team made a brief visit to Zimbabwe the following month, to play the inaugural Test between the two nations, at Harare. Healy made five and took two catches.

During the lead-up to the 1999–2000 season, the selectors made it clear that they wanted Adam Gilchrist to keep for the Test team as well as the ODI side. Initially, Healy requested that he be allowed to play one more season and then retire, which was refused. He then asked to play the first Test, scheduled for his home ground at Brisbane, as a farewell. This, too, was refused, so he announced his immediate retirement from all forms of the game in a statement released on 28 October 1999. In response to the tremendous public farewells afforded to Shane Warne, Glenn McGrath and Justin Langer at the end of the fifth Test at Sydney in 2006–07, Healy called for long-standing players to have their farewells to the game managed more appropriately than his own.

==Post retirement==
Healy&#x27;s performances were acknowledged when he was selected as the wicketkeeper in the Australian Cricket Board&#x27;s team of the 20th century, ahead of greats such as Rod Marsh, Wally Grout and Don Tallon. He was also recognised as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1994. He also embarked on a career presenting sport on the top-rating &quot;Nine News Queensland&quot;; he initially presented on weeknights in 2007 and 2008, before moving to weekends from 2009 until 2016, after regular weeknight sports presenter Wally Lewis made a full recovery from epilepsy. He has also coached the Somerville House cricket team. Since 1999, Healy has been a cricket commentator. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2008.

Healy began co-hosting the &quot;Breakfast with Pat &amp; Heals&quot; breakfast program with Pat Welsh on 7 September 2020, when SEN Track was launched in both North Queensland and South East Queensland. The program was then also heard on new digital station SENQ in 2021. Healy continued co-hosting the program when 693 SENQ launched on the 693 AM frequency in Brisbane on 1 July 2022 after the Sports Entertainment Network acquired the license of long running Brisbane music station 4KQ from the Australian Radio Network, a subsidiary of HT&amp;E.

In March 2021, the Ian Healy Oval in Brisbane became a first-class cricket venue.

==Family==
Healy has two brothers and a sister; Ken, Greg and Kim. Ken played a single Sheffield Shield game for Queensland in 1990 and a single List-A game in 1991, while Greg was also a member of the wider Queensland squad. Ian is married to wife Helen, with whom he has two daughters, Emma and Laura, and a son, Tom. His niece Alyssa Healy wicket–keeps for the Australia women&#x27;s national cricket team, formerly known as the &quot;Southern Stars&quot;. Alyssa married her childhood friend, Australian fast bowler Mitchell Starc in April 2016, making him Ian&#x27;s nephew-in-law.

<text>Brody (, ; ; ; ) is a city in Zolochiv Raion, Lviv Oblast, western Ukraine. It is located in the valley of the upper Styr River, approximately northeast of the oblast capital, Lviv. Brody hosts the administration of Brody urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. Population: 

Brody is the junction of the Druzhba and Odesa–Brody oil pipelines.

==History==
The first mention of a settlement on the site of Brody is dated 1084 (Instructions by Vladimir Monomach). It is believed to have been destroyed by Batu Khan in 1241.

===Polish Kingdom===
From 1441 Brody was the property of different feudal families (Jan Sieniński; from 1511, Kamieniecki).

Brody was granted Magdeburg town rights by Polish King Stephen Báthory by virtue of a privilege issued in Lublin on 22 August 1584. It was named Lubicz after the Lubicz coat of arms of the founder, Stanisław Żółkiewski, one of the most accomplished military commanders in Polish history (not to be confused with Lubech, &quot;Lubecz&quot;). The king also set up three annual fairs. These privileges were confirmed by King Sigismund III Vasa in 1597 at the Warsaw Sejm. Already in documents from 1598 the city appeared under the name Brody. It was a private town of the Polish Crown, owned by houses of Żółkiewski, Koniecpolski and Potocki.

From the 17th century until the Holocaust the city was populated not only by Ruthenians and Poles, but also by a significant number of Jews (70% of the town&#x27;s population), Armenians, and Greeks. From 1629, the city became the property of Stanisław Koniecpolski, another of the most distinguished military commanders in Polish history, who ordered the construction of the Brody Castle (1630–1635). The castle, or rather the fortress, was designed by the French military engineer Guillaume Le Vasseur de Beauplan. It was one of the strongest fortresses located on the route of frequent Tatar and Cossack invasions. King Władysław IV Vasa, wanting to reward and assist Koniecpolski in the construction of the fortress, issued a privilege in 1633 in Kraków, in which he equated fairs in Brody with those in Lublin and Toruń, granted staple right and exempted city residents from taxes for 15 years. Under the patronage of Koniecpolski, the city flourished. In 1637 he founded a school in which he employed lecturers from the Kraków Academy, Poland&#x27;s leading university. Its first director was Jan Marcinkowski. In 1643 he founded a silk and wool fabric manufacture in the city, one of the leading manufactories of this type throughout Poland. Stanisław Koniecpolski died in Brody on 11 March 1646. On 30 June funeral ceremonies took place in Brody.

In 1648, during the Cossack uprising, the castle took eight weeks for Bohdan Khmelnytsky to capture. Notably, according to the book &quot;History of the Rus&quot;, the town&#x27;s Jewish population was spared after the sack. The Cossacks destroyed and plundered the city. The Jews of Brody were found not to have been engaged in alleged maltreatment of the Orthodox Christian (Rus) population and were only required to pay a &quot;moderate tribute&quot; in kind.

In 1704, Brody was purchased by Potocki family. In 1734, the fortress was destroyed by Russian troops and was later replaced by Stanisław Szczęsny Potocki&#x27;s palace in the Baroque style.

===Austrian Empire===

As a result of the First Partition of Poland, in 1772, Brody became a part of the Habsburg Empire (from 1804 the Austrian Empire). During the Austro-Polish War (part of Polish national liberation fights), on 27 May 1809, the city was captured by Poles without a fight. In 1812, Wincenty Potocki was forced by the Austrian government to remove the city&#x27;s fortifications. In 1817 a secondary school (&quot;Realschule&quot;) was founded in Brody, transformed in 1865 into a gymnasium. After the liberalization of Austrian policies in the Austrian Partition of Poland, after 1904 German was gradually replaced by Polish at this school.

===Polish Republic===
In 1919, Brody became part of the Second Polish Republic, after Poland regained independence a year earlier. It was the site of a battle during the Polish-Soviet War of 1920 and heavy destruction by both Polish and Russian forces, and is described extensively in stories of the Red Cavalry by Isaac Babel. Administratively Brody was the seat of Brody County located in the Tarnopol Voivodeship. Brody was an important military base, with the Kresowa Cavalry Brigade headquarters established there. In 1936, the People&#x27;s University in Brody (&quot;Uniwersytet Ludowy w Brodach&quot;) was founded for farmers from the surrounding area.

===World War II===
After the Soviet invasion of Poland, during World War II, in September 1939, Brody was occupied by the Red Army. The Soviets deported mainly Polish people deep into the USSR. Between 26 and 30 June 1941, a tank battle was fought nearby between the German Panzer Group 1 and five Soviet mechanized corps with heavy losses on both sides. From 1941 to 1944 it was occupied by Germany. The local Jews were murdered in the Holocaust (see below). During July–August 1944, Brody and nearby areas saw the battles of the strategically important Lvov-Sandomierz Operation (a.k.a. &quot;Brodovkiy Kotel&quot;) where the Soviet army successfully encircled and destroyed German forces. It was occupied by the Soviets again, and in 1945, it was taken from Poland and annexed to the USSR. Brody held the headquarters of German Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt.

=== The Jews in Brody ===


A crossroads and a Jewish trade center in the 19th century, the city is considered to be one of the shtetls. It was particularly famous for the &quot;Brodersänger&quot; or Broder singers, who were among the first to publicly perform Yiddish songs outside of Purim plays and wedding parties.

The promulgation of the May Laws, and the massive exodus of Russian Jews which was its result, took the leaders of Western Jewry completely by surprise. Throughout 1881, hundreds of immigrants kept arriving in Brody daily. Their arrival placed the existing Austrian and German-influenced ethnic Jews in a quandary. The comfortable middle-class Jewish community of Central and Western Europe looked instinctively to the Alliance Israélite Universelle, the world&#x27;s largest and most respected Jewish philanthropic agency, to bring order out of chaos, to cope with the huge influx of newcomers.

Throughout centuries of Jewish life in Brody until the murderous events of the Holocaust, Jews and Gentiles lived a mostly segregated life, with distinct and separate social as well as religious life.

=== Holocaust in Brody ===

When German troops occupied the city on 1 July 1941, the Jewish population of some 9,000 was forced to wear an arm band with the yellow badge. Two hundred fifty intellectuals were arrested on 15 July 1941 and shot two days later at the Jewish cemetery after being brutally tortured. Encouraged by German occupation authorities, the Ukrainian population started a pogrom in August 1941, looting Jewish possessions. The Judenrat had to provide labor for repairs and maintenance on the roads and bridges as well as for work in army depots. From December 1941 young people were arrested on the streets and sent to forced labor camps in the vicinity.

In September 1942 the &quot;Aktion Reinhardt&quot; started in Brody, leaving 300 people dead. Two thousand people were deported to Bełżec where they would be murdered in the gas chambers. In December 1942 the German occupiers forced the Jewish population to resettle in a ghetto inside the town, where 6,000 people lived in January 1943. During 1943, &quot;Aktion Reinhardt&quot; was continued with thousands being killed in the nearby woods in March and April, the Ghetto being liquidated on 21 May 1943. More than 3,000 inhabitants were deported, presumably to Majdanek, but hundreds had already been killed in the Ghetto. Many houses were set on fire to drive out those who had remained hidden there.

=== After the war ===
During the Cold War, Brody air base served Soviet Air Force regiments, while the city was noticeably militarized. Parts of the city to this day are being referred to as Bili Kazarmy (the White Barracks) and as Chervoni Kazarmy (the Red Barracks).

The Brody Museum of History and District Ethnography was founded in 2001.

Until 18 July 2020, Brody was the administrative center of Brody Raion. The raion was abolished in July 2020 as part of the administrative reform of Ukraine, which reduced the number of raions in Lviv Oblast to seven. The area of Brody Raion was merged into Zolochiv Raion.

<text>Micah LeVar &quot;Pastor&quot; Troy (born November 18, 1977) is an American rapper from Augusta, Georgia. He is best known for his 2002 single &quot;Are We Cuttin&#x27;&quot; (featuring Ms. Jade), which entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The year prior, he signed with Universal Records to release his fourth album and major label debut, &quot;Face Off&quot; (2001), which entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;Are We Cuttin&#x27;&quot; spawned from his sixth album, &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; (2002), which peaked at number 13 on the chart. His seventh, &quot;By Any Means Necessary&quot; (2004), served as his final release with the label. 

Along with his solo career, he was the lead member of the Southern hip hop group D.S.G.B. (Down South Georgia Boyz).

== Early life ==
Micah LeVar Troy was born on November 18, 1977, in College Park, Georgia. His father, Alfred Troy, is a former drill instructor turned pastor.

Troy graduated from Creekside High School and attended Paine College in Augusta, Georgia, before deciding to fully pursue his career in rap. His rap name comes from his last name and his father&#x27;s profession as a pastor, and is also a pun on the name Castor Troy, a character from John Woo&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Face/Off&quot;, played by Nicolas Cage and John Travolta. His fourth album is titled &quot;Face Off&quot; in reference to the movie.

== Career ==
He released his first album, &quot;We Ready (I Declare War)&quot;, in 1999. To generate attention and buzz, he attacked record producer Master P verbally on the song &quot;No Mo Play in G. A.&quot;

Fellow Georgia-based rapper Ludacris enlisted Troy to appear on his Jermaine Dupri-produced song &quot;Get Off Me&quot;, from the former&#x27;s Def Jam Recordings debut, &quot;Back for the First Time&quot;. Troy also formed the Augusta, Georgia-based hip hop group D.S.G.B. (Down South Georgia Boyz) during this time, for which he served as frontman. He guest appeared on Lil Jon &amp; the Eastside Boyz&#x27; song &quot;Throw It Up&quot;, from their collaborative album &quot;Kings of Crunk&quot; (2002). In 2002, Troy&#x27;s album &quot;Universal Soldier&quot; became popular in the South; it spawned the single &quot;Are We Cuttin&#x27;&quot; featuring Ms. Jade, which was also featured on the soundtrack for the action film &quot;xXx&quot;, released that year. The album debuted at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. In 2003, Troy appeared on Young Jeezy&#x27;s 2003 album &quot;Come Shop wit&#x27; Me&quot; on the track titled &quot;GA&quot;.

Troy released &quot;By Any Means Necessary&quot; in 2004. Following this album, Troy was released from his Universal contract due to creative disputes. He then released &quot;Face Off, Part II&quot;, which addressed some issues with Lil Scrappy and BME. In 2005, he appeared with Killer Mike on Chamillionaire&#x27;s track &quot;Southern Takeover&quot; off of &quot;The Sound of Revenge.&quot;

He released three albums in 2006, starting with &quot;Stay Tru&quot;, followed by &quot;By Choice or By Force&quot; and &quot;Atlanta 2 Memphis&quot;, the latter on which in collaboration with Memphis, Tennessee, rapper Criminal Manne. &quot;Stay Tru&quot; entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 150, selling 6,000 copies its first week.

Troy released his sixteenth solo album, &quot;Ready for War&quot;, in June 2009, and released seven follow-up studio albums until 2011. In 2012, he released &quot;The Last OutLaw&quot;, and in 2013, he released &quot;The Streets Need You&quot;. In 2014, he released the mixtape &quot;Crown Royal Part 4&quot;, as well as the album &quot;Welcome to the Rap Game&quot;, while he released the sixth installment of his &quot;Crown Royal&quot; mixtape series in 2015, along with &quot;WAR (We Are Ready) in Atlanta&quot;, which featured Paul Wall and Bun B.

In 2017, Troy announced his retirement, and released his last album &quot;O.G.P.T&quot; in July of that year. He also announced he was in the process of completing his second film, titled &quot;Down 2 Come Up&quot;, which he wrote, directed, and starred in, which was slated for released on March 17, 2020. Despite announcing his retirement, his career continued with the release of two albums: &quot;Clubber Lang&quot; (2018) and &quot;Enemy of the State&quot; (2019).

<text>A sty or pigsty is a small-scale outdoor enclosure for raising domestic pigs as livestock. It is sometimes referred to as a hog pen, hog parlor, pigpen, pig parlor, or pig-cote, although pig pen may refer to pens confining pigs that are kept as pets as well. Pigsties are generally fenced areas of bare dirt and/or mud. &quot;Sty&quot; and &quot;pigsty&quot; are used as derogatory descriptions of dirty, messy areas, the word sty deriving from the Proto-Germanic *stiją meaning filthy hovel. There are three contributing reasons that pigs, generally clean animals, create such a living environment:

* Pigs are voracious eaters and will eat all the plants in the enclosure until there is nothing left to control erosion.
* The pig will naturally root and dig for food in the enclosure, further disturbing the soil.
* Pigs do not regulate temperature by sweating which means that they must be provided with water or mud in which they can control their own body temperature.

A large-scale enclosure for raising pigs is generally called a hog lot. Unlike a sty which would be found on a mixed farm, a hog lot is usually a dedicated facility. 

A locked enclosure with confined/restricted movement and freedom to exercise, is known as a boar-stall.
According to some experts such forced immobilization was believed to elevate cortisol.

== Family farm hog pen ==
The family hog pen was a small-scale system of pig farming found on family farms of the early 1900s, although backyard pig farming does still occur. Family hog pens enclosed just a few hogs to provide year-round meat for the table. Before refrigeration, some family farms depended on pigs as a primary source of meat and shortening (lard) for year-round food. Farms which had tenant families might have several hog pens. This is vastly different from the modern American hog farm which have an average of about 2,000 hogs, with the largest raising hundreds of thousands.

==The hog pen==
Farming pigs outdoors poses problems, but the small scale of family farming made it possible to manage these problems. In particular, hogs suffer &#x27;heat stress&#x27; in high temperatures and have no sweat glands to naturally cool themselves. To cool themselves, hogs need access to water or a &#x27;wallow&#x27;, which is an area of mud. Without access to water or mud, pigs must wallow in their own excrement. Normally, pigs avoid their own excrement; pigs do not defecate just anywhere in their pen–they use one corner of it for their &#x27;toilet&#x27;. Ideally, a cement wallow which contains water cools the pig much better. Alternatively, shade may be provided for the pigs. Pink pigs are especially prone to sunburn. 

Many family farm hog pens were improvised enclosures made of any handy free material. The pen is often kept small to conserve building material and effort.

==Slopping the hogs==
Historically, these farms fed hogs on grain, fruit and vegetables that are not fit for sale or family use. Overage produce from the farmer’s market and table and restaurant scraps were often diet elements as well. This practice of &#x27;swill feeding&#x27; (feeding table scraps) is considered a disease risk today, though this is mainly associated with feeding meat to pigs, which is banned in many countries. Hogs were also fed &quot;slops&quot; made from middlings or corn meal stirred with milk and water. 

Historically, hogs were also allowed to forage in gardens and orchards after the harvest was over. Such foraging can cause erosion and runoff, but the small scale of these operations prevented this from occurring.

<text>In miniature wargaming, players enact simulated battles using scale models called miniature models, which can be anywhere from 2 to 54 mm in height, to represent warriors, vehicles, artillery, buildings, and terrain. These models are colloquially referred to as miniatures or minis.

Miniature models are commonly made of metal, plastic, or paper. They are used to augment the visual aspects of a game and track position, facing, and line of sight of characters. Miniatures are typically painted and can be artfully sculpted, making them collectible in their own right. Pre-painted plastic figures, such as &quot;Clix&quot; miniatures produced by WizKids and unpainted plastic figures for &quot;Warhammer&quot; by Games Workshop, have become popular. The hobby of painting, collecting, and playing with miniatures originated with toy soldiers, though the latter were generally sold pre-painted.

==Materials==
Miniature models are derived from toy soldiers which were constructed of a variety of materials, These toy figures came to be mass produced from tin in late 1700s Germany, where they were called &quot;Zinnsoldaten&quot; (lit. &quot;tin soldiers&quot;). These early figures were flat models commonly called &quot;flats&quot;, and became quite common in western Europe. By the mid 1800s manufactures in several countries were producing 3d miniatures of tin and lead alloys, common called white metal. In 1993, the New York legislature introduced a bill outlawing lead in miniatures, citing public health concerns. Many miniature manufacturers, anticipating that other states would also impose bans, began making figures with lead-free alloys, often at increased prices. After months of debate and protests by miniature manufacturers and enthusiasts, New York Governor Mario Cuomo signed a bill which exempted miniatures from the state&#x27;s public health law. Despite this, most American manufacturers continued to use non-lead alloys. 
In the 20th century miniatures would also be manufactured from plastic and composite materials.

Some wargames use &quot;box miniatures&quot;, consisting of card stock folded into simple cuboids with representative art printed on the outside. Other games use 2d cardboard miniatures that are either held in a base or folded into a triangular tent.

==Scale heights==

Historically the size of miniatures was described in absolute scale in various different systems of measurement, most commonly in metric and English units. A 28mm miniature means that the size of the miniature will be 28mm from the feet of the mini to the chosen reference point. The most common miniatures were the 54 mm European miniatures and the 2 1/4&quot; English models which are commonly considered to be 1:32 scale. Early wargames such as H.G Wells Little Wars used these commonly available miniatures. With metrication in the United Kingdom, United States manufacturers began to use the metric system to describe miniatures, as opposed to the previously popular customary units, so that their table-top wargaming models would be compatible. Today,the scale of a figure is often described in millimeters, for example one of the most common scales is 28 mm.

Manufacturers set up a size of the miniature and try to make every miniature similar size or at least have an average with the size they&#x27;ve set up. While a model may be described as 28 mm the actual height of the model may be different. This is because of a number of factors such as manufacturer, model proportion, method of measuring the model, the model&#x27;s pose, and what sort of man the model is meant to represent. A manufacturer might advertise its figures as 28 mm, but their products may be over 30 mm tall. In 28 mm scale, short characters such as dwarves, hobbits, and goblins might be represented by figures in the 15 to 20 mm range while taller characters like ogres, trolls and dragons would use 30 mm or larger figures. Manufacturer&#x27;s use of scale is not uniform and can deviate by as much as 30%. Some manufacturers measure figure height from the feet to the eyes rather than the top of the head; therefore, a figure that is 30mm to the top of its head could be considered to be a 28mm miniature. Figures of 15 mm, 20 mm, 25 mm, 28 mm, 30 mm, 32 mm, and 35 mm are the most common for role-playing and table-top games. Smaller figures of 2 mm, 6 mm, 10 mm, 15 mm, and 20 mm are used for mass-combat wargames. Large sizes such as 40 mm and 54 mm were popular with wargamers in the past and are still used by painters and collectors. While the large miniatures have become popular again since the late 20th century, they are not as popular as the smaller sizes.

In many games there is a definite scale specified for the square grid that the game is played upon. One of the most common is 1 inch represents 5 feet. This specifies an exact scale of 1:60. That implies that a 28 mm tall figurine represents a person – which is a reasonable number for a modern 50th percentile male (See: Human height). Another popular scale is 1/72 or 1 inch equals 6 foot which uses 20 mm, to 25 mm miniatures. It is mostly used for historical gaming in part due to a wide selection of 1/72 scale models. Figures are commonly used with a variety of scales. It is not uncommon for there to be a mismatch between the game scale and miniature size. Chainmail used a scale of 1:360, appropriate to 5 mm miniatures, but was played with 30 mm miniatures, and the conceit that each figure represented 20 men. In the table below, figure height alone (excluding base thickness) is the feature from which approximate scale is calculated.

Scales smaller still are used when the game involves large vehicles (such as starships or battleships). For instance &quot;Axis &amp; Allies Naval Miniatures: War at Sea&quot; uses 1:1800 scale, and scales down to 1:6000 are seen. There is no equivalent &quot;mm&quot; number for these scales as individual figures would be nearly microscopic and are not used as such in the games.

=== Heroic scale ===
A further complication is differing interpretations of body proportions. Many gaming figures are unrealistically bulky for their height, with oversized feet, heads, hands, wrists, and weapons. Making these parts oversized allows for more details to be present in the miniatures. Some of these exaggerations began as concessions to the limitations of primitive mold-making and sculpting techniques, but they have evolved into stylistic conventions. Figurines with these exaggerated features are often referred to as &quot;heroic scale&quot;. 

=== Scale creep ===
There is a noted tendency in miniature figure manufacture where over time for bigger and bigger figures to be produced. Larger models were easier to produce correctly, especially in the 20th century; bigger details come out better, and larger surfaces are easier to paint. When a company sees that people are still buying the larger models, that&#x27;s an incentive for them to continue making larger ones.

== Miniature figure scale ==

This is a relative scale that compares the size of the model to the size of a real life object. This ratio will show how many times the model is smaller than the original size. The meaning of 15 mm (for example) is therefore dependent on a defined reference height. Thus 15 mm in the context of a dwarven world where the reference humanoid is tall, is not equivalent to 15 mm in the context an NBA model where the reference humanoid is 2 meters tall. Both models can be described as 15 mm, but the real world sizes depend on the size of the reference humanoid. In practice, the reference humanoid is generally assumed to be the idea of the average height of the human male, within a interval between , unless otherwise indicated by the designer. Average human height is heavily dependent on the population measured within a geographical region and historical era.

The following chart provides a numerical relationship between model scale and multiple figurine scales based on the platonic idea of the height of a human being (humanoid). 

==Painting==

Many role-playing gamers and wargamers paint their miniatures to differentiate characters or units on a gaming surface (terrain, battle mat, or unadorned table top).

Fantasy, role-playing, miniatures, and wargaming conventions sometimes feature miniature painting competitions, such as Games Workshop&#x27;s Golden Demon contest. There are also many painting competitions on the internet.

==Manufacture==
There are two basic methods of manufacturing figures: centrifugal/gravity casting and plastic injection casting.

Most metal and resin figures are made through spin casting. Larger resin models, like buildings and vehicles, are sometimes gravity cast, which is a slower process. To gravity cast, a sculptor develops a master figure, which is then used to create rubber master and production moulds. The production moulds are used to cast the final commercial figures.

Polyethylene and polystyrene figures are made by injection moulding. A machine heats plastic and injects it under high pressure into a steel mould. This is an expensive process; it is only cost effective when manufacturing large amounts of figures, since the quantity renders the cost per cast minimal. Many miniatures companies do not produce their figures themselves but leave the manufacturing to specialized casting companies or miniatures companies that have casting facilities.

==Sculpting==

Most miniatures are hand sculpted using two-component epoxy putties in the same size as the final figure. The components of the putty are mixed together to create a sculpting compound that hardens over 48 hours. Some common brands include Polymerics Kneadatite blue\yellow (also known as &quot;green stuff&quot; and &quot;Duro&quot; in Europe), Milliput, A&amp;B, Magic sculpt, and Kraftmark&#x27;s ProCreate.

Until recently, sculptors avoided polymer clays as they cannot withstand the traditional mould-making process. Modern techniques using RTV silicone and softer-quality rubbers have made it possible to use weaker materials, so that polymer clay masters have become more common. Fimo clay is popular, though due to the individual properties of certain colours, only a limited selection of colours is used.

Masters for plastic miniatures are often made in a larger scale, often three times the required size. The master is measured with a probe linked to a pantograph that reduces the measurements to the correct size and drives the cutter that makes the moulds.

A more recent development is the use of digital 3D models made by computer artists. These digital models create a physical model for mould-making using rapid prototyping techniques. Alternatively, they can be used directly to drive a computer numerical control machine that cuts the steel mould. They can also simply skip moulding steps and directly produce miniatures from 3D models.

==Miniatures in &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;==

Originally, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was an evolution of the &quot;Chainmail&quot; medieval miniatures game, with the distinction that each player controlled a single figure and had a wider variety of actions available. The original &quot;D&amp;D&quot; boxed set bore the subtitle, &quot;Rules for Fantastic Miniature Wargames Campaigns Playable with Paper and Pencil and Miniature Figures&quot;. However, &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; did not require miniatures, referring to them as &quot;only aesthetically pleasing&quot;. &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; likewise included a relatively short section describing miniature use, in conjunction with the official &quot;AD&amp;D&quot; miniatures being produced at the time. As the game developed, miniatures became more of an optional add-on. The &quot;AD&amp;D 2nd Edition&quot; accessory &quot;Player&#x27;s Option: Combat &amp; Tactics&quot; introduced a more elaborate grid-based combat system that emphasized the use of miniatures; a streamlined version of some of these concepts appeared in &quot;D&amp;D&quot; 3rd edition. Although not strictly necessary, the 4th edition of the game assumes the use of miniatures, and many game mechanics refer explicitly to the combat grid. In addition to reducing ambiguity about the size and position of characters, this allows the game to specify rules for reach, threatened areas, and movement rates. The 5th edition de-emphasized these mechanics, and returned the use of miniatures to mostly optional.

==2D miniatures==

Some games feature miniatures printed on cardboard or cardstock, and some companies have published such miniatures to be used in place of miniature models. 
*Steve Jackson Games published the &quot;Cardboard Heroes&quot; line, and included cardstock miniatures in &quot;Steve Jackson&#x27;s Man to Man&quot;, and then in the &quot;GURPS Basic Set&quot; and supplements such as &quot;GURPS Autoduel&quot;.
*&quot;Zargonians&quot; was another early line of cardboard miniatures.
*The &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Basic&quot; game included cardstock miniatures in supplements and adventures such as &quot;The Kidnapping of Princess Arelina&quot;, &quot;The Revenge of Rusak&quot;, &quot;The Veiled Society&quot;, and &quot;The Gem and the Staff&quot;.
*&quot;Marvel Super Heroes&quot; by TSR included cardstock miniatures, and was supplemented by &quot;Adventure Fold-Up Figures&quot; and more in &quot;Pit of the Viper&quot;.
*Other games that featured such 2D miniatures include &quot;Star Patrol&quot;, &quot;Ringworld&quot;, &quot;Dragonroar&quot;, &quot;Judge Dredd: The Role-Playing Game&quot;, &quot;TWERPS&quot;, and &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="928282" wikidata="Q640078" url="?curid=928282" title="Minelayer">
<text>A minelayer is any warship, submarine, military aircraft or land vehicle deploying explosive mines. Since World War I the term &quot;minelayer&quot; refers specifically to a naval ship used for deploying naval mines. &quot;Mine planting&quot; was the term for installing controlled mines at predetermined positions in connection with coastal fortifications or harbor approaches that would be detonated by shore control when a ship was fixed as being within the mine&#x27;s effective range.

An army&#x27;s special-purpose combat engineering vehicles used to lay landmines are sometimes called &quot;minelayers&quot;.

== Etymology ==
Before World War I, mine ships were termed mine planters generally. For example, in an address to the United States Navy ships of Mine Squadron One at Portland, England, Admiral Sims used the term &quot;mine layer&quot; while the introduction speaks of the men assembled from the &quot;mine planters&quot;. During and after that war the term &quot;mine planter&quot; became particularly associated with defensive coastal fortifications. The term &quot;minelayer&quot; was applied to vessels deploying both defensive- and offensive mine barrages and large scale sea mining. &quot;Minelayer&quot; lasted well past the last common use of &quot;mine planter&quot; in the late 1940s.

==Naval minelayers==


The most common use of the term &quot;minelayer&quot; is a naval ship used for deploying sea mines. Russian minelayers were highly efficient sinking the Japanese battleships and in 1904 in the Russo-Japanese War. In the Gallipoli Campaign of World War I, mines laid by the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s Navy&#x27;s &quot;Nusret&quot; sank , , and the in the Dardanelles on 18 March 1915.

In World War II, the British employed the Abdiel minelayers both as minelayers and as transports to isolated garrisons, such as Malta and Tobruk. Their combination of high speed (up to 40 knots) and carrying capacity was highly valued. The French used the same concept for the cruiser .

A naval minelayer can vary considerably in size, from coastal boats of several hundred tonnes in displacement to destroyer-like ships of several thousand tonnes displacement. Apart from their loads of sea mines, most would also carry other weapons for self-defense, with some armed well enough to carry out other combat operations besides minelaying, such as the World War II Romanian minelayer &quot;Amiral Murgescu&quot;, which was successfully employed as a convoy escort due to her armament (2 × 105 mm, 2 × 37 mm, 4 × 20 mm, 2 machine guns, 2 depth charge throwers).

Submarines can also be minelayers. The first submarine to be designed as such was the . was another such minelaying submarine. Although there are no modern dedicated submarine minelayers, mines sized to be deployed from a submarine&#x27;s torpedo tubes, such as the Stonefish, allow any submarine to be a minelayer.

In modern times, few navies worldwide still possess minelaying vessels. The United States Navy, for example, uses aircraft to lay sea mines instead. Mines themselves have evolved from purely passive to active; for example the US CAPTOR (enCAPsulated TORpedo) that sits as a mine until detecting a target, then launches a torpedo.

A few navies still have dedicated minelayers in commission, including those of South Korea, Poland, Sweden and Finland; countries with long, shallow coastlines where sea mines are most effective. Other navies have plans to create improvised minelayers in times of war, for example by rolling sea-mines into the sea from the vehicle deck through the open aft doors of a Roll-on/roll-off ferry. In 1984, the Libyan Navy was suspected of having mined the Red Sea a few nautical miles south of the Suez Canal using the Ro-Ro ferry &quot;Ghat&quot;, other nations suspected of having similar wartime plans include Iran and North Korea.

==Aerial minelaying==

Beginning in World War II, military aircraft were used to deliver naval mines by dropping them, attached to a parachute. Germany, Britain and the United States made significant use of aerial minelaying.

A new type of magnetic mine dropped by a German aircraft in a campaign of mining the Thames Estuary in 1939 landed in a mudflat, where disposal experts determined how it worked, which allowed Britain to fashion appropriate mine countermeasures.

The British Royal Air Force minelaying operations were codenamed &quot;Gardening&quot;. As well as mining the North Sea and approaches to German ports, mines were laid in the Danube River near Belgrade, Yugoslavia, starting on 8 April 1944, to block the shipments of petroleum products from the refineries at Ploiești, Romania. 

&quot;Gardening&quot; operations by the RAF were also sometimes used to assist in code breaking activities at Bletchley Park. Mines would be laid, at Bletchley Park&#x27;s request, in specific locations. Resulting German radio transmissions were then monitored for clues which could help deciphering messages encoded by the Germans using Enigma machines.

In the Pacific, the US dropped thousands of mines in Japanese home waters, contributing to that country&#x27;s defeat.

Aerial mining was also used in the Korean and Vietnam Wars. In Vietnam, rivers and coastal waters were extensively mined with a modified bomb called a &quot;destructor&quot; that proved very successful.

==Landmine laying==

Some examples of minelaying vehicles:
* Shielder minelaying system
* Zemledeliye (minelaying system)
* GMZ family of minelayers, which the 2S4 Tyulpan is based on, using TM-62 series mines
* Minenwerfer Skorpion
* Type 94 Minelayer
* Istrice (M113 variant)

<text>Accion is an international nonprofit. Founded as a community development initiative serving the poor in Venezuela, it works with local partners in different countries to develop and scale digital financial solutions for underserved people globally.

To date, it has more than 235 financial service providers operating across 75 countries.

Accion is headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and also has offices in Washington, D.C.; Bogota, Colombia; Mumbai, India; and Beijing, China. Accion works across Latin America and the Caribbean, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. In the U.S., Accion operates a nationwide nonprofit lending network.

==Background and history==
=== 2010–present ===
In 2009 and 2010, Accion helped to start microfinance institutions in underserved areas of Inner Mongolia, Cameroon, and Brazil.

In December 2009, Accion inaugurated Accion Microfinance China (AMC) in Chifeng Prefecture, Inner Mongolia; this microfinance institution represented the first wholly owned foreign microcredit company (MCC) and only the second wholly foreign-owned MCC in the country. Since then, Accion has transitioned ownership of AMC to Grassland Finance Ltd., a Hong Kong holding company incorporated in 2011 with a focus on founding or investing in financial services institutions in China that provide loans and other financial services to China&#x27;s vast number of medium, small, and micro enterprises (MSMEs). Today, grassland has grown to more than 15 branches across six provinces.

In April 2012, Accion launched its seed-stage investment initiative, Accion Venture Lab. Venture Lab invests capital in, and provides support to innovative fintech start-ups that increase access to, improve the quality of, or reduce the cost of financial services for the underserved at scale. Since launching, Accion Venture Lab has deployed over $12 million across more than 30 start-ups that work in over 20 countries worldwide.

Accion expanded its work to yet another country in April 2015 when it partnered with Myanmar&#x27;s DAWN, a microfinance institution originally launched in 2002 as a program of Save the Children. After decades of isolation beginning in the 1960s, Myanmar rejoined the world economy with a need for affordable services. Accion has helped DAWN integrate new technologies, triple its loan portfolio, and expand to more branches.

In November 2016, Accion announced an updated organizational strategy reflecting Accion&#x27;s increasing focus on the potential for financial technology, or &quot;fintech,&quot; to reach the world&#x27;s three billion financially underserved people. See details on Accion&#x27;s strategy below.

In March 2017, Accion announced the launch of a global fintech fund for the underserved: the &quot;Accion Frontier Inclusion Fund&quot;, managed by Quona Capital. The fund aims to help the world&#x27;s three billion financially underserved people by catalyzing fintech innovations that can radically improve the quality and availability of financial services for the underserved. At its launch, the fund represented over $141 million in commitments from an array of institutional investors. Accion is the fund&#x27;s sponsor and anchor investor; the fund&#x27;s manager, Quona Capital, is an early-growth-stage venture firm focused on financial technology for underserved consumers and businesses in emerging markets. Investments include NeoGrowth, Yoco, Konfio, and First Circle.

=== 2000s ===
In October 2000, Accion began working in partnership with microlending organizations in sub-Saharan Africa, marking its first initiative outside the Americas. Recognizing the need for microcredit throughout Africa, Accion worked to increase financial inclusion for poor, self-employed Africans throughout the continent. In 2006, Accion launched a partnership with Ecobank, the leading regional bank in West Africa. Pan-African Savings and Loans (then called EB-Accion Savings and Loans) launched operations in Ghana in 2007 and is expanding to neighboring countries.

In 2005, Accion started a new venture to reach another underserved group: urban small business owners in India. Since establishing an office in the country, Accion has partnered with local financial institutions in Patna and Mumbai, assisting them in applying individual and group lending and tailored credit scoring, among other microfinance methodologies.

In 2007, Compartamos Banco, a Mexican microfinance institution and Accion investee, became the first Latin American MFI to offer equity through an initial public offering (IPO). The IPO sparked an industry-wide debate, with some &quot;questioning the ethics of profit[ing] from the poor&quot; and others arguing that &quot;the profit motive can help lift many more people out of poverty than charity alone could ever do.&quot; Álvaro Rodríguez Arregui, chairman of Accion at the time, was among the latter and argued that the IPO was needed to attract much more capital to the microfinance industry, and Accion used the funds to advance its mission. Today, Compartamos stands out as one of the largest MFIs, in terms of the number of clients, in Latin America.

The proceeds from the IPO allowed Accion to create new MFIs in Brazil, Cameroon, China, Ghana, and India and strengthen, through investment or reinvestment, other partners in India, Africa, and Latin America. Accion also used the proceeds to establish and fund its Washington, D.C.–based think tank, the Center for Financial Inclusion (CFI) at Accion. 

CFI&#x27;s work is grouped into three broad categories:

&quot;Client Advocacy&quot;

Examples of CFI&#x27;s industry-wide initiatives include the Smart Campaign, the world&#x27;s first global consumer protection campaign, and Financial Inclusion 2020, a movement that mobilized stakeholders around the globe to achieve full financial inclusion, using the year 2020 as a focal point for action.

=== 1990s ===
In 1991 Accion brought its microlending model to the United States by piloting a program in Brooklyn, New York. Accion aimed to help those who didn&#x27;t meet requirements for traditional financing (such as bank loans) because their requested amount was too small or because they had limited or damaged credit.

Accion has since worked to further adapt its lending model to the social and economic needs of communities across the United States. Accion now serves small businesses nationwide through four independent community development financial institutions (CDFIs) and a national office that invests in shared knowledge, innovation, and impact to benefit the entire network.

Since 1991, the members of Accion in the U.S. have provided more than 60,000 loans to small business owners and disbursed more than $500 million in capital. Additionally, Accion provides business advising and training services—both in person and through online educational resources—to tens of thousands of entrepreneurs each year.

In 1995, Accion created an equity investment vehicle for microfinance, the Accion Gateway Fund, to provide new microfinance institutions with the resources they needed to expand.

=== 1980s ===
Over the next decade, Accion helped start microfinance programs in 14 countries in Latin America. Accion and its partners developed a lending method that met the needs of microenterprises.

The ability to cover costs, augmented by Accion&#x27;s new loan guarantee fund, the Bridge Fund, enabled Accion&#x27;s partners to connect with the local banking sector and dramatically increase the number of microentrepreneurs they reached. Between 1989 and 1995, Accion&#x27;s Latin American networked loan disbursements multiplied more than 20 times.

Convinced that microfinance had the potential to transform the economic landscape of Latin America, Accion recognized that microfinance institutions (MFIs) would need access to a much larger pool of capital.

To help them achieve this, Accion helped create BancoSol, the first commercial bank in the world dedicated solely to microenterprise. Founded in Bolivia in 1992, its clients are typically market vendors, sandal makers, and seamstresses.

In 1994, Accion helped BancoSol sell certificates of deposit in the U.S. financial market.

=== 1970s ===
By the early 1970s, Accion began to focus on addressing a major cause of poverty in Latin American cities: lack of economic opportunity.

In 1973, Accion staff in Recife, Brazil, began to focus their efforts on helping informal businesses. An Accion organization in Recife called UNO coined the term &quot;microenterprise&quot; and began issuing small loans, pioneering the field of microcredit.

===1960s===
Accion was founded in 1961 by a UC Berkeley law student named Joseph Blatchford.

Blatchford&#x27;s founding of Accion was heavily influenced by the philosophical works of Alexis de Tocqueville, Aldous Huxley and Mohandas Gandhi as well as The Ugly American by UC Berkeley professor Eugene Burdick and the classic essay “The Moral Equivalent of War” by William James. Working from James’ main thesis, Blatchford believed that Americans needed to find new, non-militaristic ways to focus their involvement abroad while promoting self-determination and democracy. A volunteer corps dedicated to international cooperation and grassroots development was one such path.

Blatchford recruited two other standout UC Berkeley law students, Jerry Brady and Gary Glenn, to manage volunteer recruitment, publicity, and the stateside orientation of volunteers while he continued to cultivate contacts in Latin America.

In the summer of 1961, the first group of 30 Americans was ready to deploy to poor barrios in urban centers around Venezuela.

The nature of Accion&#x27;s first projects reflected needs that the communities themselves identified as priorities. The Accion workers did everything from digging ditches to building schools to fundraising to managing sensitive negotiations between opposing community leaders. About the range of these early projects, Blatchford reflected, “The project depended on what the community was concerned about. Then the community did it; they created committees and were in charge of the project. They realized they could do it and it changed their lives.”

By the mid-1960s, Accion was engaging fewer and fewer North Americans and Europeans and instead was hiring college-educated Venezuelans as organizers—a group called “Community Action Organizers.”

Throughout the 1960s, Blatchford and other Accionistas worked with local business leaders in Argentina, Brazil (Rio, São Paulo, and Recife) and Peru to set up community development organizations that followed the same philosophy as the original Accion in Venezuela: “not to give people alms but to give them confidence in their own ability.” Many of these organizations, including Ação Comunitária do Brasil Rio de Janeiro, Ação Comunitária do Brasil São Paulo and Accion Comunitaria de Peru, which today is Mibanco – are still in existence today.

A few years after launching in Venezuela, Accion established itself in New York to provide technical support to funders and business leaders in Latin American countries who wanted to start community action programs like Accion did in Venezuela.

<doc id="928289" wikidata="Q6453728" url="?curid=928289" title="Cape bushbuck">
<text>The Cape bushbuck (Tragelaphus sylvaticus), also known as imbabala is a common, medium-sized bushland-dwelling, and a widespread species of antelope in sub-Saharan Africa. It is found in a wide range of habitats, such as rain forests, montane forests, forest-savanna mosaic, savanna, bushveld, and woodland. It stands around at the shoulder and weigh from . They are generally solitary, territorial browsers.

==Taxonomy==

The taxonomy of bushbuck, and of the Tragelaphini tribe in general, has been contested. Bushbuck have been fractured into over 40 subspecies in the past. mtDNA profiles of a large number of samples were resolved in 2009 as belonging to 19 groups, some corresponding to previously described subspecies, while others were previously unrecognised and remained unnamed. These groups were then organised into two taxa - a nominate northern subspecies (&quot;T. s. scriptus&quot;) and a southern subspecies &quot;T. s. sylvaticus&quot;. In the 1780 original description of &quot;T. sylvaticus&quot; from the Cape Region by Sparrman, no mention was made of striping. According to Moodley &quot;et al&quot;., males of type populations in West Africa are more often striped than southern and eastern specimens, although this is not always the case.

In 2011, Groves and Grubb advocated recognising eight species of bushbuck: &quot;T. scriptus&quot; (Pallas, 1766); &quot;T. phaleratus&quot; (Hamilton Smith, 1827); &quot;T. bor&quot; Heuglin, 1877; &quot;T. decula&quot; (Rüppell, 1835); &quot;T. meneliki&quot; Neumann, 1902; &quot;T. fasciatus&quot; Pocock, 1900; &quot;T. ornatus&quot; Pocock, 1900; and &quot;T. sylvaticus&quot; (Sparrman, 1780), grouped in a northern and southern &#x27;group&#x27;. The Ethiopian endemic species known as Menelik&#x27;s bushbuck or &quot;decula&quot; was classified as a &quot;scriptus&quot; group species as opposed to Woodley. In the case of &quot;Tragelaphus&quot;, these &#x27;species&#x27; would be based mostly on geography and pelage as opposed to genetics. These proposals are controversial.

In 2018, Hassanin et al. published a molecular phylogenetic study that provided support for the &quot;scriptus&quot; and &quot;sylvaticus&quot; species, with a divergence time of at least 2 million years, albeit with considerable genetic diversity within each of these groups.

==Description==


Cape bushbucks stand around at the shoulder and weigh from in males and in females. They have a light brown coat, with up to seven white stripes and white splotches on the sides. The white patches are usually geometrically shaped and on the most mobile parts of their bodies, such as the ears, chin, tail, legs, and necks. The muzzles are also white. Horns, found only on the males, can reach over half a metre and have a single twist. At 10 months old, young males sprout horns that are particularly twisted and at maturity form the first loop of a spiral.

The Cape bushbuck has on average less striping and more uniform colouration than populations in West Africa. Cape bushbuck occur from the Cape in South Africa to Angola and Zambia and up the eastern part of Africa to Ethiopia and Somalia, according to one interpretation. Other interpretations restrict the taxon to Southern Africa &quot;sensu stricto&quot; or consider them &quot;sensu lato&quot; to occur in the above range except eastern Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia. The first Latin name that can be attributed to the Cape bushbuck was &quot;Antilope sylvatica&quot; after Sparrman (1780), described from the Cape Colony.


==Ecology==
Bushbuck browse on trees, shrubs, and forbs; they rarely if ever eat grasses. Studies of free-ranging bushbuck in various parts of southeastern Africa using DNA metabarcoding show that bushbuck frequently forage on acacias (&quot;Senegalia&quot;, &quot;Vachellia&quot;) and other legumes, along with mallows (&quot;Grewia&quot;, &quot;Hibiscus&quot;), bushwillows (&quot;Combretum&quot;), buckthorns (&quot;Berchemia&quot;, &quot;Ziziphus&quot;) and various other plants. Bushbuck are active throughout the day, but tend to be nocturnal near human habitations. 

Bushbuck are solitary animals, but are not aggressively antisocial, and individuals sometimes forage in close proximity. Bushbuck live within a &quot;home&quot; area, which is usually around 50,000 m2 on the savannah and much larger in the forest, that they will not normally leave. These areas usually overlap other bushbuck home areas. 

Some game farmers in southern Africa discovered that the bushbuck may compete with the closely related, larger nyala when they tried to introduce the two species to the same area. However, the two species are often found in close proximity in natural communities (e.g., in Gorongosa National Park, Mozambique).

<doc id="928304" wikidata="Q1393006" url="?curid=928304" title="Fremantle-class patrol boat">
<text>The &quot;Fremantle&quot;-class patrol boats were coastal patrol vessels operated by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) from 1979 to 2007. Designed by British shipbuilder Brooke Marine and constructed in Australia by NQEA, the &quot;Fremantle&quot; class were larger, more powerful, and more capable than the preceding , and the two primary patrol boat bases required infrastructure upgrades to support them. Although up to 30 vessels were planned, fifteen were ordered and constructed, with an unexercised option for five more.

Their retirement was announced in 2001 and a decommissioning schedule published in 2004. From May 2005 they were replaced by the patrol boats with the last two &quot;Fremantle&quot;s decommissioning in May 2007. Most of the class were scrapped, with two marked for preservation as museum ships. The &quot;Fremantle&quot; class has also appeared in two drama television series based on the Royal Australian Navy.

==Planning and development==
The concept for the &quot;Fremantle&quot; class began somewhere between 1967 and 1969, as the s entered service, and areas for improvement were observed. In September 1970, the RAN announced the intention to construct ten new patrol boats, which would operate in tandem with the &quot;Attack&quot; class and replace two general purpose vessels. These new vessels were intended to enter service between 1976 and 1980. The number of vessels to be built fluctuated, peaking at thirty vessels (16 RAN, 4 Royal Australian Naval Reserve, and 10 for the military of Papua New Guinea), and settling at fifteen.

Plans of acquisition were announced in April 1975, with eleven shipbuilders submitting tenders, of which two were shortlisted in 1976; Brooke Marine of England and Lürssen Werft of West Germany. Brooke Marine won the contract to design and produce the lead ship, with NQEA contracted to build the other fourteen vessels. An option for an additional five vessels existed, but they were placed on indefinite hold in 1982. There was a separate acquisition plan for six missile-armed variants, but this was suspended due to the lack of available funding, and the belief that such ships could be constructed on short notice if required.

==Design and construction==
The design of the &quot;Fremantle&quot; class called for ships with improved seakeeping, and newer equipment and weapons than those fitted to the &quot;Attack&quot; class. The &quot;Fremantle&quot;s had a full load displacement of , were long overall, had a beam of , and a maximum draught of . The &quot;Fremantles&quot; were 28% longer and 50% heavier than their predecessors. During sea trials, NUSHIP &quot;Fremantle&quot; was revealed to be 20 tons over the contracted limit. Main propulsion machinery consisted of two MTU series 538 diesel engines, which supplied to the two propeller shafts. They also had an APU (an Auxiliary Propulsion Unit that was fitted in the interest of fuel saving whilst on patrol: One Dorman 12-cylinder auxiliary propulsion engine.) These were later removed as they proved inefficient when compared to the two main engines Exhaust was not expelled through a funnel, like most ships, but through vents below the waterline. The patrol boat could reach a maximum speed of , and had a maximum range of at . The ship&#x27;s company consisted of 22 personnel. Each patrol boat was armed with a single, bow-mounted Bofors 40 mm L/60 gun as main armament, supplemented by two .50-calibre Browning machineguns and an 81 mm mortar, although the mortar was removed from all ships sometime in the late 1990s. The main weapon was originally to be two 30-mm guns on a twin-mount, but the reconditioned Bofors were selected to keep costs down; provision was made to install an updated weapon later in the class&#x27; service life, but this did not eventuate.

Early on in the construction program, it was realised that the two main patrol boat bases, in Cairns, Queensland and in Darwin, Northern Territory, were not capable of supporting ships of this size on a permanent basis. This resulted in a $10 million infrastructure upgrade for the two bases, which was completed in 1981 and 1982, respectively. This included modern maintenance, logistic, and administrative facilities at both bases, and the installation of a synchro-lift at &quot;Coonawarra&quot;.
Construction of &quot;Fremantle&quot; began in October 1977. It was launched on 16 February 1979, and commissioned on 17 March 1980. During sea trials, &quot;Fremantle&quot; received distinction for locating and rescuing a British sailor thrown from a commercial trawler following its collision with an oil tender. Construction of the first Australian-built vessel, , began in September 1978, with &quot;Warrnambool&quot; launched on 25 October 1980 and commissioned on 14 March 1981. The final ship of the class, , was commissioned on 15 December 1984. The Australian-built vessels were built through an assembly-line method. Hulls were built upside-down from the keel to the second-uppermost deck, then rolled over and built to the top of the hull. After this, the superstructure, which had been fabricated at the same time, was welded onto the hull. Construction of the class (including the two naval base upgrades) cost $150 million. All fifteen vessels were named after &quot;Bathurst&quot;-class corvettes.

==Operational history==
The first ship of the class, , arrived in Australia on 27 August 1980, after an 82-day voyage covering . NQEA completed three patrol boats in both 1981 and 1982, and four in both 1983 and 1984. By the end of 1984, four &quot;Fremantle&quot;s were located at , , and Fleet Base East, two at , and one at HMAS &quot;Cerberus&quot;. Also by 1984, all of the &quot;Attack&quot; class had left active service, with many transferring to the RAN Reserve or the Indonesian Navy.

On 31 May 1985, &quot;Wollongong&quot; grounded on rocks at Gabo Island, causing extensive damage to the vessel. It was repaired by the builder, and returned to service in late 1986.

From May 2005 onwards, the &quot;Fremantle&quot;s were replaced in service by the fourteen patrol boats. During late 2006, the decommissioned remained laid up alongside in Waverton, Sydney for use as the alongside set for the drama series &quot;Sea Patrol&quot;. The last two ships, and , decommissioned in a joint ceremony on 11 May 2007.

== Fate ==

During 2006 and 2007, most of the &quot;Fremantle&quot;s were broken up for scrap in Darwin, at a cost of between $400,000 and $450,000 each to the Australian government. A total of 11 of the class were dismantled at Darwin, although the MTU engines were salvaged and sold on market, and some high value item were also saved. The exceptions were &quot;Wollongong&quot; (which was instead scrapped in Port Macquarie), &quot;Townsville&quot; (gifted to the Townsville Maritime Historical Society for preservation as a museum ship), and (gifted to the Gladstone Maritime Museum for preservation).

==&quot;Fremantle&quot; class in fiction==

The fictional HMAS &quot;Defiance&quot;, portrayed by HMA Ships , , , , and featured in the second season of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation television series &quot;Patrol Boat&quot;.

The fictional HMAS &quot;Hammersley&quot; is the setting of the first season of Channel Nine&#x27;s 2007 drama series &quot;Sea Patrol&quot;. This vessel was portrayed by HMA Ships &quot;Wollongong&quot; and . A second patrol boat, HMAS &quot;Kingston&quot;, also appears in the series. From the second season onwards, an &quot;Armidale&quot;-class boat is used.

<doc id="928309" wikidata="Q2434211" url="?curid=928309" title="Tim O'Brien (musician)">
<text>Timothy O&#x27;Brien (born March 16, 1954) is an American country and bluegrass musician. In addition to singing, he plays guitar, fiddle, mandolin, banjo, bouzouki and mandocello. He has released more than ten studio albums, in addition to charting a duet with Kathy Mattea entitled &quot;The Battle Hymn of Love&quot;, a No. 9 hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts in 1990. In November 2013 he was inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame.

== Early life ==
Tim O&#x27;Brien was born on March 16, 1954, and raised in Wheeling, West Virginia, the youngest in a family of five children. At the age of 12, he first heard a Bob Dylan record, played by his older sister Mollie, afterwards deciding to take up music. Throughout his teens, he taught himself to play guitar, violin, and mandolin.

In high school, he and his sister Mollie, a singer, began performing Peter, Paul, and Mary songs as a duo at church and local coffeehouses.

== Music career ==

=== Hot Rize ===

In 1973, he dropped out of Colby College to pursue music professionally. He wrote to his mother at the time, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m heading west. I know 200 songs now, and I figure if I keep learning more I should be all right.&quot;

He eventually moved to Boulder, Colorado, in the 1970s and became part of the music scene there. He played bars around Denver and Boulder with Dan Sadowsky and the Ophelia Swing Band and cut one of his earliest albums, Swing Tunes of the 30&#x27;s and 40&#x27;s, with that band in 1977. In Colorado, he met guitarist/bassist Charles Sawtelle, banjoist Pete Wernick, and guitarist Mike Scap, with whom he formed Hot Rize in 1978. Mike Scap was soon replaced by Nick Forster on bass with Sawtelle moving to guitar. Over the next twelve years, the quartet earned recognition as one of America&#x27;s most innovative and entertaining bluegrass bands. Never straying too far from a traditional sound, Hot Rize stood out with fresh harmony singing, Wernick&#x27;s melodic banjo playing, and O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s easy-going rhythmic drive.

To broaden their repertoire, the members of Hot Rize would often split their show with a set of classic and offbeat country and western music in the comic guise of Red Knuckles and the Trailblazers. The band would walk off stage, change clothes, and reappear as a different band (O&#x27;Brien assumed the role of &quot;Red Knuckles&quot;), with its own songs, fictional back story and humorous costumes. Hot Rize was the International Bluegrass Music Association&#x27;s first Entertainer of the Year in 1990, and in 1993, O&#x27;Brien took the IBMA&#x27;s Male Vocalist of the Year honors.

In 1990, Hot Rize disbanded as a regular touring and recording band. However, after the death of guitarist Charles Sawtelle, in 2002 Hot Rize was joined by award winning guitarist Bryan Sutton and the band began to once again play limited engagements.

=== Duets with Mollie O&#x27;Brien ===
In 1984, O&#x27;Brien and his sister Mollie O&#x27;Brien reunited for a Mother&#x27;s Day concert, and four years later recorded the duet album &quot;Take Me Back&quot;. Chip Renner of AllMusic gave the album 4.5/5 stars, and called it &quot;a masterpiece.&quot; In 1986 they began performing again as an Americana duo, and produced two more albums, &quot;Remember Me&quot; (1992), and &quot;Away Out on the Mountain&quot; (1994). All three records were released on Sugar Hill Records.

=== Solo career ===
O&#x27;Brien, who had already recorded several albums without Hot Rize, embarked on a solo career. He briefly signed to RCA Records, recording an album with them called &quot;Odd Man In&quot;, before being dropped. Sugar Hill Records eventually released the album, and O&#x27;Brien has not signed to a major since. In 1990, O&#x27;Brien also charted along with Kathy Mattea on the duet &quot;The Battle Hymn of Love&quot;, which peaked at No. 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks charts.

In 2010, O&#x27;Brien featured prominently on Kris Drever&#x27;s second solo album, &quot;Mark the Hard Earth&quot;. He also produced at least one instructional video/DVD of mandolin and bouzouki instruments.

O&#x27;Brien joined Mark Knopfler in his Get Lucky Tour between April 8, 2010 and July 31, 2010.

In 2024, O&#x27;Brien recorded a duet with Bonnie &quot;Prince&quot; Billie for the latter&#x27;s album &quot;The Purple Bird&quot;. The song, &quot;Our Home&quot; was released as a single in advance of the album release.

=== Howdy Skies Records ===
O&#x27;Brien started his own record label, Howdy Skies Records, in 1999.

== Style and sound ==
Although naturally left-handed, O&#x27;Brien plays the guitar and other instruments right-handed.

== Distinctions and awards ==
*2014 - Awarded Grammy Award for Best Bluegrass Album for &quot;The Earls of Leicester&quot;
*2013 - Inducted into the West Virginia Music Hall of Fame
*2006 - International Bluegrass Music Award (IBMA) for Male Vocalist of the Year.

<doc id="928312" wikidata="Q333823" url="?curid=928312" title="Gwilym Lloyd George">
<text>Gwilym Lloyd George, 1st Viscount Tenby, , later hyphenated Lloyd-George (4 December 1894 – 14 February 1967), was a Welsh politician and cabinet minister. The younger son of David Lloyd George, he served as Home Secretary from 1954 to 1957.

==Background, education and military service==
Born in Criccieth in North Wales, Lloyd George was the second son of Liberal Prime Minister David Lloyd George and his first wife, Margaret, daughter of Richard Owen. His sister Megan was also active in politics, but the two moved in opposite political directions: Gwilym to the right, towards the Conservatives, and Megan to the left, eventually joining the Labour Party.

Educated at Eastbourne College and Jesus College, Cambridge, Lloyd George was commissioned into the 6th Battalion Royal Welch Fusiliers in 1914. In 1915 he became aide-de-camp to Major-General Ivor Philipps, commander of the 38th (Welsh) Division. He transferred to the Anti-Aircraft branch of the Royal Garrison Artillery in 1916 and rose to the rank of major, being known for most of his political career as Major Lloyd George. He was also mentioned in despatches.

==Early political career 1922–45==

Leaving the army in 1918, Lloyd George found employment working with his father in the post war coalition government. This also included being a trustee for David Lloyd George&#x27;s National Liberal Political Fund.

Lloyd George was Member of Parliament (MP) for Pembrokeshire from 1922 to 1924, and again from 1929 to 1950. He was initially elected as a National Liberal, but then joined the re-united Liberal Party in 1923. In 1931, Lloyd George initially took ministerial office as Parliamentary Secretary to the Board of Trade in the National Government of Ramsay Macdonald, but resigned when his father David Lloyd George withdrew his support from the government. Gwilym Lloyd George was subsequently a member of the Independent Liberal group from 1931 to 1935, who were opposed to the continuation of the National Government. This group then subsequently returned to the main Liberal Party following the 1935 general election.

In 1939, Lloyd George joined Neville Chamberlain&#x27;s government for the same post he resigned from in 1931. From then on Lloyd George operated in effect as an independent Liberal. In 1941, he was appointed to the office of Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Food and then Minister of Fuel and Power in 1942. Lloyd George stayed in the post until the 1945 general election It was after the death of his father in 1945 that Gwilym began hyphenating his surname as Lloyd-George.

==Later political career, 1945 onward==
Following the 1945 general election in which he stood as a &#x27;Liberal and Conservative&#x27;, and was returned by a majority of 168, Lloyd George was approached by the Liberal Party and its rival the Liberal National Party to chair their respective political organisations. Lloyd George turned them both down. Winston Churchill offered him a position in the Conservative Party&#x27;s Shadow cabinet but was allowed to remain as a &#x27;Liberal&#x27;. In 1946 Lloyd-George formally lost the Liberal Party whip. 

From this point onwards he did not associate with his erstwhile Liberal colleagues (who included his sister Lady Megan) and he was openly supported by Conservatives in his constituency. In early January 1950 he was publicly disowned by the Liberal Party for supporting Conservative candidates in constituencies contested by a Liberal candidate.

Lloyd-George lost his seat (standing as a National Liberal and Conservative) in the 1950 general election. The Liberal Party did not field a candidate against him but this time Lloyd George lost to a Labour Party candidate Desmond Donnelly by 129 votes. His career in Welsh politics at an end, a year later Lloyd-George returned to parliament as a National Liberal for Newcastle upon Tyne North in the 1951 general election. His candidature was backed by Churchill although disgruntled Conservatives in the local party supported an independent against Lloyd George.

Returning to office, Prime Minister Winston Churchill appointed him Minister of Food 1951–1954, and Home Secretary and Minister for Welsh Affairs from 1954 until his retirement in 1957. Lloyd-George was raised to the peerage as Viscount Tenby, of Bulford in the County of Pembroke, on 12 February 1957 and took his seat in the House of Lords on 27 February. 

In 1955, during his time as Home Secretary, he had refused to commute the death sentence imposed on Ruth Ellis; she was the last woman to be executed in the UK.

==Family==
Lloyd George married Edna Gwenfron, daughter of David Jones, in 1921. They had two children: David Lloyd George, 2nd Viscount Tenby (1922–1983), and William Lloyd George, 3rd Viscount Tenby (1927–2023). He died aged 72, and was succeeded by his eldest son, David.

Lady Tenby died in 1971.

<doc id="928313" wikidata="Q7755988" url="?curid=928313" title="The Panel (Australian TV series)">
<text>The Panel was an Australian television talk show that was broadcast by Network Ten and its affiliates; it was also simulcast on the Triple M radio network. The show was produced by Working Dog Productions and included several members of the former D-Generation and &quot;The Late Show&quot; casts.

The show featured a panel of five (originally six) people who discuss and joke about items in the news, current affairs, and pop culture. Episodes of &quot;The Panel&quot; screened at 9.30pm on Wednesday nights. Episodes were scheduled to run one hour but would often finish late, delaying the live news broadcast scheduled for 10.30pm immediately afterwards.

The series premiered in 1998 and was very popular in its first few years. Between 2003 and 2007 the show also broadcast an annual Christmas special.

== Panelists ==

The regular panelists are Glenn Robbins, Rob Sitch, Tom Gleisner, Kate Langbroek, and Santo Cilauro (usually sitting in this order from screen left to right at the desk). Jane Kennedy was the original 6th panelist, but later left the show. Gleisner would act as the MC, introducing guests and bookending segments; however, if he didn&#x27;t appear in the episode, Cilauro would often play this role.

The series also frequently featured guest panelists, with other Australian comedians, actors, and international guests (such as American actor Harry Shearer) regularly taking a spot at the desk. Jo Stanley replaced Langbroek, who was on maternity leave, as a regular panelist for a number of shows in 2004.

Brian Nankervis performed warm-up for the audience. The floor manager was Annie Maver, the then-wife of comedian Tony Martin.

== Guests ==
Guests include music and movie stars, sports heroes and political figures, but also many lower profile individuals who have interesting stories to tell, such as round-the-world sailor Jesse Martin, or sexual health physician Dr. Cindy Pan. A number of regular guests also appear to help present segments. These include sports reporter Stephen Quartermain, film reviewer Lawrie Zion and Hollywood correspondent Jeff Stilson.

The international superstar Anastacia also made an appearance while her promoting her debut album Not That Kind, back in 2000, where she sang exclusively the song I&#x27;m Outta Love in an a cappella version.

One of the most &quot;excruciating&quot; interviews, as Tom Gleisner described it, was in 2002 when Tommy Lee Jones was in the studio with Will Smith to promote their film &quot;Men in Black II&quot;. Jones did not respond positively to any of the good humour of the interviewers and provided very brief answers.

&quot;All Aussie Adventures&quot; host, Russell Coight (played by Glenn Robbins) appeared in character on one episode. Robbins did not appear as a panelist that week. Robbins also appeared as both himself and his &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot; character Kel Knight during the 2007 Christmas special.

==Christmas specials==
Starting in 2003 a special Christmas episode of the show aired on Christmas night, outside the regular broadcast season of the series. It has been promoted under varying titles including &quot;The Panel Christmas Special&quot; and &quot;The Panel Christmas Wrap&quot;.

The extended length episode (usually two to three hours long) combines regular segments of the show, including live music performances and celebrity guests, with retrospectives on the past year. Live advertorials for the show&#x27;s sponsors are also performed by the cast, with the proceeds going to charity. The specials always finish with a pantomime of deliberately dubious quality revolving around the birth of Jesus.

Christmas specials continued to be produced for some years after regular series production ended, with the latest special broadcast in 2007. Although initially planned, there was no special in 2008 due to Working Dog&#x27;s commitment to &quot;The Hollowmen&quot;.

== Spin-offs ==
The success of the show has resulted in successful spin off shows in Ireland (hosted by Dara Ó Briain; see &quot;The Panel&quot; (Irish TV series)) and New Zealand (hosted by Cal Wilson). Another spin-off, supposedly the Afghanistan version, was introduced on the 2005 Christmas special.

It has also led to the release of several albums in the &quot;Music – Live from the Panel&quot; series, consisting of songs performed on the show by local and international artists. Performances on &quot;The Panel&quot; were frequently performed acoustically or with minimal instrumental backing, as opposed to a full band.

==Controversy==

Network Ten and &quot;The Panel&quot; have been parties to a number of media law cases. They are in a long running dispute with the Nine Network in the Federal Court of Australia regarding an episode of &quot;The Panel&quot; and its broadcast of footage from Nine shows. Several appeals and related decisions have been made in the Federal Court (FCA), the Full Court of the Federal Court (FCAFC) and the High Court of Australia (HCA):

In its first year, the show gained some notice when Rob Sitch uttered the word &quot;fuck&quot;, then taboo for a live program, on air when inquiring about television presenter Donna Gubbay. Gubbay had presented a story on her program &quot;E! News&quot; where she introduced a story about panelist Kate Langbroek with the words &quot;Who the hell is Kate Langbroek?&quot; After playing the footage, Sitch retorted &quot;who the hell is Kate Langbroek? Well, who the fuck are you?&quot;

In 2003 Langbroek faced some criticism after breastfeeding her first-born child live on air shortly after giving birth.

<doc id="928314" wikidata="Q4738179" url="?curid=928314" title="Alvin M. Johnston">
<text>Alvin Melvin &quot;Tex&quot; Johnston (August 18, 1914 – October 29, 1998) was an American test pilot for Bell Aircraft and the Boeing Company.

== Early life ==
Johnston was born August 18, 1914, in Admire, Kansas, to farmers Alva and Ella Johnston. He had his first airplane ride in 1925, at 11 years old, when a barnstormer landed near his family farm. At the age of 15, Johnston used his newspaper route money to purchase a wrecked Cessna glider. After repairing the glider, Johnston&#x27;s father would pull it behind their car and Johnston would release the tow cable and glide to a landing in a nearby field. After graduating from Emporia High School in 1932, Johnston enrolled in the airplane mechanic program at the Spartan School of Aeronautics in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Once Johnston became an apprentice mechanic, he was able to offset his flight training costs by working on the school&#x27;s aircraft. After graduating from Spartan, Johnston joined Inman&#x27;s Flying Circus, working as both a pilot and mechanic. After a season with Inman&#x27;s, Johnston bought a Command-Aire biplane and started barnstorming on his own.

When the 1934 barnstorming season ended, Johnston sold his airplane and returned to Emporia, Kansas. He reunited with his high school girlfriend, DeLores Honea, and married in 1935. In order to create a stable income for his young family, Johnston operated a movie theater for several years, but soon yearned to continue his aviation career. He enrolled in Kansas State University&#x27;s aeronautical engineering program, but dropped out in 1939 to become a civilian instructor for the U.S. Army Air Corp&#x27;s Civilian Pilot Training Program. Once the United States entered World War II, Johnston transferred to the U.S. Army Air Corps Ferry Command and was based in Dallas, Texas flying domestic ferry flights.

== Test pilot ==
===Bell Aircraft===
In December 1942, Bell Aircraft chief test pilot Robert Stanley offered Johnston a position as a production test pilot. Johnston flew the Bell P-39 Airacobra and the XP-63 Kingcobra during the prototype phases as well as the first American jet, the XP-59 Airacomet. Johnston earned his nickname &quot;Tex&quot; because of his penchant for wearing cowboy boots and a Stetson hat on the flightline.

After World War II ended, Johnston convinced Larry Bell to purchase two war-surplus Airacobras to be modified and entered in the National Air Races as a publicity stunt. The two P-39&#x27;s were named Cobra I and II, with Johnston flying Cobra II and his flight test boss Jack Woolams flying Cobra I. The day before the race, Cobra I crashed into Lake Ontario from a suspected canopy failure, killing Woolams. There was internal debate within Bell Aircraft as whether to continue or not, but Johnston insisted Woolams would have wanted them to race. The Cobra II crew worked all night making safety modifications and won the Thompson Trophy at the 1946 National Air Races. He set a race speed record of .

Johnston helped design and later flew the rocket-propelled Bell X-1 at a speed of Mach .72 on May 22, 1947. He stayed on the program as a design advisor on modifications to the trim controls that he discovered were unusable in their manufactured configuration at high subsonic speeds. Later that year, Chuck Yeager would become famous for breaking the sound barrier in this aircraft.

Once the X-1 project began to taper off, Bell Aircraft made the decision to enter the fledgling helicopter industry. Johnston learned to fly helicopters, but his passion remained for airplane testing.

===Boeing Company===
In July 1948, Johnston accepted a test pilot position with Boeing. He flew the Boeing B-47 Stratojet, and piloted the first flight of the Boeing B-52 Stratofortress prototype.

Johnston is best known for performing a barnstormer-style barrel roll maneuver with Boeing&#x27;s pioneering 367-80 jet in a demonstration flight over Lake Washington outside Seattle, on August 7, 1955. Bill Allen, the then-president of Boeing, had invited many aero-space and airline executives to enjoy Seattle&#x27;s Seafair aboard his yacht. Allen had asked Johnston to make a fly-by over Seafair to show off Boeing&#x27;s new airliner. Johnston performed the barrel roll during the fly-by, reversed course with a chandelle, and performed a second barrel roll on the way back. The following Monday, Allen called Johnston to his office and asked what he thought he was doing, to which he responded with &quot;I was selling airplanes,&quot; and explained the maneuver was not hazardous. He kept his position as a test pilot, and did not get in legal trouble for his actions on the condition that he did not do it again.

==Program manager and later life==
From 1960 to 1963, he was assistant program manager for the Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar program in Seattle. From 1964 to 1968, he was manager of the Boeing Atlantic Test Center in Cocoa Beach, Florida, working on two of Boeing&#x27;s programs, the Minuteman missile and the Lunar Orbiter designed for the Apollo missions. He also worked with NASA, managing Saturn and Apollo programs. In 1968, Johnston left Boeing to manage Tex Johnston, Inc., Total-In-Flight-Simulator Inc., and Aero Spacelines, the latter handling the manufacture and certification of an outsized cargo airplane known as the Pregnant Guppy.

In 1975, Johnston rejoined his old boss, Robert Stanley, and became chief pilot at Stanley Aviation, focusing on personnel escape systems (ejection seats).

In 1991, Johnston wrote his memoir, &quot;Tex Johnston: Jet Age Test Pilot&quot;, with writer Charles Barton.

==Death and honors==
Johnston died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 1998 at a nursing home in Mount Vernon, Washington.

Johnston was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1993. Johnston&#x27;s cowboy style of dress and maverick behavior is said to have inspired the creation of B-52 pilot Maj. T.J. &quot;King&quot; Kong, portrayed by Slim Pickens in the movie Dr. Strangelove.

<text>In the Groove (abbreviated ITG) is a rhythm game developed &amp; published by Roxor Games, and is the first game in the &quot;In the Groove&quot; series. The game was shown in an official beta-testing preview on July 9, 2004, and was officially released in arcades around August 30, 2004. A PlayStation 2 port of &quot;In the Groove&quot; was released on June 17, 2005, by RedOctane.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay mechanics of &quot;In the Groove&quot; are very similar to Konami&#x27;s &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; series, involving stepping in time to the general rhythm or beat of a song using a four-arrowed Dance Pad. During normal gameplay, color arrows scroll upwards from the bottom of the screen and pass over a set of gray, stationary arrows near the top (referred to as &quot;targets&quot;). When the scrolling arrows overlap the stationary ones, the player must step on the corresponding arrow(s) on the dance platform. Longer arrows referred to as &quot;Holds&quot; must be held down for their entire length for them to count. &quot;Rolls&quot; (as introduced in &quot;In the Groove 2&quot;), which appear to be spiky, green and yellow holds, must be rapidly tapped (like a drumroll, hence the name) for them to count. Mines deduct score and health if a player&#x27;s foot is on an arrow when they pass by the corresponding target arrow on-screen. If more than two arrows appear at the same time, the additional arrows are known as &quot;Hands&quot;, as players would hit arrows with their hands to complete such steps, though hitting two arrows with one foot also typically works.

On the player&#x27;s far side of the screen is a life bar. This is affected by the accuracy judgements the player receives for hitting (or missing) arrows. Most machines have the Auto-Fail feature turned off - that is, any player whose life bar empties during a song can still finish playing that song, but will be failed at its conclusion. All machines will immediately fail any player who stops hitting arrows long enough to accrue 30 misses in a row. Similar to other dancing games, the player is judged for how accurately they step relative to when they were &quot;supposed&quot; to step. From highest to lowest, possible judgements are &quot;Fantastic,&quot; &quot;Excellent,&quot; &quot;Great,&quot; &quot;Decent,&quot; &quot;Way Off,&quot; and &quot;Miss&quot;. For holds and rolls, if the player finishes the hold or roll successfully, they receive a &quot;Yeah!&quot; judgement. If not, the player receives a &quot;Bad&quot;. In the middle of the screen, the game keeps track of a player&#x27;s current &quot;combo,&quot; which is the length of the player&#x27;s most recent chain of good timing judgements. A player&#x27;s combo carries over from one song to the next, typically ending at the conclusion of a credit. However, if the player utilizes a USB card to keep track of their scores, their combo will also carry over from one credit to the next. The game has safety nets for players on easy difficulties that allows them to play all of the songs on their credit without failing out. If the life bar is fully depleted during gameplay, the player fails the song (unless the &quot;fail at end of song&quot; setting is on), usually resulting in a game over. Otherwise, the player is taken to the Results Screen, which rates the player&#x27;s performance with a letter grade and a percentage score, among other statistics.

Modifiers (also referred to as mods) change the display of how arrows and other items in a stepchart work. They include Speed Multipliers (to space out the position of the scrolling arrows so less can be seen at once), Perspective (to change the behavior of how arrows scroll, such as having slower-moving arrows at the top and faster-moving arrows at the bottom), and Note (to change the appearance of how arrows look; some Note options change the color of the arrow depending on the rhythm of the song).

===Game modes===
&quot;In the Groove&quot; offers different modes of gameplay, each with different rules on how songs are selected and played.

Dance Mode is the default mode of play. In this mode, a player chooses a number of individual songs to play (the default is three). After the songs are played, the game is over.

Marathon Mode is an extended mode of play. In this mode, a player chooses a predefined configuration of songs that may also have a predefined set of &quot;modifiers&quot; in order to make the songs more challenging to play. Marathon courses typically have four songs, although some have five songs.

Battle Mode is a specialized &quot;versus&quot; mode of play. Two players (or one player against the computer) play three individual songs of the same difficulty. During the song, successfully executed steps fill up a player&#x27;s &quot;power bar&quot;. When the power bar completely fills, a modifier is applied to the opposing player&#x27;s side.

==Music==

A total of 76 songs were available in the arcade and home versions of In the Groove. Some songs are exclusive to the home version for PC and Mac. Kyle Ward (also known as KaW, Inspector K, Banzai, E-Racer, and Smiley) is the developer&#x27;s house musician, who composed many of the songs. Another 56 artists can be found in the series.

==Home versions==
Two home versions of &quot;In the Groove&quot; were released. The first was released for the PlayStation 2 on June 17, 2005, and was published by RedOctane. The PS2 version contains the Novice mode carried over from &quot;In the Groove 2&quot;, Liquid Moon as a fully playable track, and 4 songs from the sequel. A PC version was released on August 16, 2006, featuring 3 songs from the now-canceled &quot;In the Groove 3&quot;, widescreen aspect ratio support, and Edit Mode. A patch named &quot;Song Pack A&quot; was later released adding the songs and theme from &quot;In the Groove 2&quot;.

In the home version, as the player progresses in the game by clearing a certain number of songs, more modifiers, marathon courses, and songs are unlocked.

==Controversy==

Konami filed a lawsuit against Roxor Games on an infringement of various rights on May 9, 2005, in the Eastern District of Texas, a district known for its bias for the plaintiff in patent cases. Additionally, they amended their complaint on July 1, 2005, to include the dance game &quot;MC Groovz Dance Craze&quot; (a game produced by Mad Catz to accompany their 3rd party dance mat). Konami primarily claims that Roxor has infringed their dancing game patent rights, but also goes on to claim that the refitting of arcade cabinets &quot;has been done in an infringing and unfair way&quot;.

On July 10, 2005, however, Konami amended its complaint to include the In The Groove PS2 game and its publisher RedOctane. On July 25, 2005, Roxor Games filed a counterclaim against Konami. In the counterclaim, Roxor denies the claims in Konami&#x27;s complaint, stating that &#x27;In The Groove&#x27; does not violate patent law and that claiming that Konami has engaged in unfair competition.

However, the lawsuit ultimately ended in a settlement. On October 18, 2006, Roxor announced that Konami had acquired the intellectual property rights to the In the Groove series as part of the settlement to this litigation. The musicians and developers of the game would later go on to create &quot;Pump it Up Pro&quot;, a spinoff of the Pump it Up series featuring music and features from ITG.

==Technical details==
&quot;In the Groove&quot; is built on a complete PC system dubbed the &quot;Boxor&quot; which runs a heavily modified version of the Debian Linux distribution. The computer contains a standard IDE hard disk (usually 40gb or 80gb in size), single-core 32-bit processor (Usually AMD Athlon or Intel Celeron), 128mb nVidia GeForce FX 5200 graphics card, 256MB or 512MB of DDR RAM, a Gigabyte Technology GA-8IPE1000 Pro2 motherboard, and a USB 2.0 hub (Cypress EZ-USB FX2) for transferring user statistics and edits onto a flash drive. On upgrade kits for Dance Dance Revolution machines, The Boxor includes a special I/O board called &quot;ITGIO&quot; for making a JAMMA connection to the machine. Some Boxors have slightly different hardware than others. The software used to run the game is a proprietary fork of the open source &quot;StepMania&quot; computer program. Anti-piracy measures are achieved through the use of a &quot;serial dongle&quot; which prevents execution of the software on an unlicensed computer. Certain versions of the &quot;In the Groove 2&quot; cabinet - in particular the ones manufactured by Andamiro, have BIOS passwords. In this situation users have to bypass the password by resetting the BIOS on the motherboard. This is typically done by removing the power cord and CMOS battery, then activating CMOS_PWD reset jumper on the motherboard of the computer.

<text>A portrait miniature is a miniature portrait painting from Renaissance art, usually executed in gouache, watercolor, or enamel. Portrait miniatures developed out of the techniques of the miniatures in illuminated manuscripts, and were popular among 16th-century elites, mainly in England and France, and spread across the rest of Europe from the middle of the 18th century, remaining highly popular until the development of daguerreotypes and photography in the mid-19th century. They were usually intimate gifts given within the family, or by hopeful males in courtship, but some rulers, such as James I of England, gave large numbers as diplomatic or political gifts. They were especially likely to be painted when a family member was going to be absent for significant periods, whether a husband or son going to war or emigrating, or a daughter getting married.

The first miniaturists used watercolour to paint on stretched vellum, or (especially in England) on playing cards trimmed to the shape required. The technique was often called limning (as in Nicolas Hilliard&#x27;s treatise on the &quot;Art of Limming&quot; of c. 1600), or painting in little. During the second half of the 17th century, vitreous enamel painted on copper became increasingly popular, especially in France. In the 18th century, miniatures were painted with watercolour on ivory, which had now become relatively cheap. As small in size as 40 mm × 30 mm, portrait miniatures were often fitted into lockets, inside watch-covers or pieces of jewellery so that they could be carried on the person. Others were framed with stands or hung on a wall, or fitted into snuff box covers.

==Early period==
The portrait miniature developed from the illuminated manuscript, which had been superseded for the purposes of book illustration by techniques such as woodprints and calc printing. The earliest portrait miniaturists were famous manuscript painters like Jean Fouquet (self-portrait of 1450), and Simon Bening, whose daughter Levina Teerlinc mostly painted portrait miniatures, and moved to England, where her predecessor as court artist, Hans Holbein the Younger painted some miniatures. Lucas Horenbout was another Netherlandish miniature painter at the court of Henry VIII. 
France also had a strong tradition of miniatures, centred on the court, although this came to concentrate in the mid-16th century on larger images, about the range of sizes of the modern paperback book, which might not qualify as miniatures in the usual sense. These might be paintings, or finished drawings with some colour, and were produced by François Clouet ( – 1572), and his followers.

The earliest French miniature painters were Jean Clouet (died ), his son François Clouet, Jean Perréal and others; but of their work in portraiture we have little trace at the present day, although there are many portraits and a vast number of drawings attributed to them. The seven portraits in the &quot;Manuscript of the Gallic War&quot; (Bibliothèque Nationale) are assigned to the eider Clouet; and to them may be added a fine work, in the Pierpont Morgan collection, representing the Marschal de Brissac. Following these men we find Simon Renard de St. André (1613–1677), and Jean Cotelle. Others whose names might be mentioned were Joseph Werner (1637–1710), and Rosalba Carriera (1675–1757).

The first famous native English portrait miniaturist is Nicholas Hilliard (–1619), whose work was conservative in style but very sensitive to the character of the sitter; his best works are beautifully executed. The colours are opaque, and gold is used to heighten the effect, while the paintings are on card. They are often signed, and have frequently also a Latin motto upon them. Hilliard worked for a while in France, and he is probably identical with the painter alluded to in 1577 as &quot;Nicholas Belliart&quot;. Hilliard was succeeded by his son Lawrence Hilliard (died 1640); his technique was similar to that of his father, but bolder, and his miniatures richer in colour.

Isaac Oliver and his son Peter Oliver succeeded Hilliard. Isaac (–1617) was the pupil of Hilliard. Peter (1594–1647) was the pupil of Isaac. The two men were the earliest to give roundness and form to the faces they painted. Peter painted initially very like his father, with tiny, coloured dots, giving the portraits a three-dimensionality. Peter Oliver then developed Isaac&#x27;s style, loosening the dots, and using softer, broader brush strokes to model the faces. They signed their best works in monogram, and painted not only very small miniatures, but larger ones measuring as much as . They copied for Charles I of England (1600–1649) on a small scale many of his famous pictures by the old masters.
Other miniaturists at about the same date included Balthazar Gerbier, George Jamesone, Penelope Cleyn and her brothers. John Hoskins (died 1664) was followed by a son of the same name, who was known to have been living in 1700, since a miniature signed by him and bearing that date is in the Pierpont Morgan collection, representing James FitzJames, 1st Duke of Berwick.

Samuel Cooper (1609–1672) was a nephew and student of the elder Hoskins, and is considered the greatest English portrait miniaturist. He spent much of his time in Paris and Holland, and very little is known of his career. His work has a superb breadth and dignity, and has been well called life-size work in little. His portraits of the men of the Puritan epoch are remarkable for their truth to life and strength of handling. He painted upon card, chicken skin and vellum, and on two occasions upon thin pieces of mutton bone. The use of ivory was not introduced until long after his time. His work is frequently signed with his initials, generally in gold, and very often with the addition of the date.

Other miniaturists of this period include Alexander Cooper (died 1660), who painted a series of portraits of the children of the king and queen of Bohemia; David des Granges (1611–1675); Richard Gibson (1615–1690); and Charles Beale the Elder and Mary Beale. They are followed by such artists as Gervase Spencer (died 1763), Bernard Lens III, Nathaniel Hone and Jeremiah Meyer, the latter two notable in connection with the foundation of the Royal Academy. The workers in black lead (&quot;plumbago&quot;, as it was called at that time) must not be overlooked, especially David Loggan, William Faithorne and John Faber the Elder. They drew with exquisite detail and great effect on paper or vellum.

On 28 April 1733, there was a terrible destruction of portrait miniatures in a fire at White&#x27;s Chocolate and Coffee House. Sir Andrew Fountaine rented two rooms at White&#x27;s to temporarily hold his huge collection of portraits done by Hilliard, the Olivers, Samuel Cooper, and others. The entire house burned down; the number of paintings destroyed was so large that the ashes were carefully sifted to recover the gold from the incinerated mountings of the miniatures.

==Peak period, by country==

===Denmark===

In Denmark, Cornelius Høyer specialized in miniature painting (often 40 mm × 30 mm or approximately 1-1.5 inches, or in many case, oval or round in shape) in the second half of the 18th century and was appointed Miniature Painter to the Danish Court in 1769. He also worked at several other European courts and won a considerable international reputation. He was succeeded by Christian Horneman as Denmark&#x27;s premier proponent of the special trade of miniature portraits. Among his most known works are a portrait of Ludwig van Beethoven from 1802 of which Beethoven was particularly fond—possibly because it presents him to a more handsome appearance than most other portraits.
===England===
The 18th century produced a great number of miniature painters, of whom Richard Cosway (1742–1821) is the most famous. His works are of great beauty, and executed with a dash and brilliance which no other artist equalled. His best work was done about 1799. His portraits are generally on ivory, although occasionally he worked on paper or vellum, and he produced a great many full-length pencil drawings on paper, in which he slightly tinted the faces and hands, and these he called &quot;stayned drawings&quot;. Cosway&#x27;s finest miniatures are signed on the back; there is but one genuine signed on the face; very few bear even his initials on the front.

George Engleheart (1750–1829) painted 4,900 miniatures; it is often signed E or G.E. Andrew Plimer (1763–1837) was a pupil of Cosway, and both he and his brother Nathaniel Plimer produced some lovely portraits. The brightness of the eyes, wiriness of the hair, exuberance of colour, combined with forced chiaroscuro and often very inaccurate drawing, are characteristics of Andrew Plimer&#x27;s work. John Smart ( – 1811) was in some respects the greatest of the 18th-century miniaturists. His work was hailed by contemporaries for his excellence in refinement, power and delicacy; its silky texture and elaborate finish, and the artists love for a brown background. Other notable painters were Richard Crosse (1742–1810), Ozias Humphry (1742–1810), Samuel Shelley (c1750–1808), whose best pictures are groups of two or more persons, Henry Edridge (1769–1821), John Bogle, and Edward Dayes.

The period also produced an exceptional painter in enamel on copper, Henry Bone R.A. (1755-1864). Bone expanded the size of miniatures that could be produced, working on historical and contemporary portraits, religious and mythical scenes, and old masters. He became the only enamel painter to achieve Royal Academy membership and was appointed as enameller to Kings George III, George IV, and William IV.


=== Colonial India ===

The portrait miniature was also used as a tool for notoriety, respect, and promotion especially for the British in Colonial India. Young soldiers sent to India were often done so under the impression that their tour of duty would elevate their status in society, secure a promotion, and prepare them for marriage upon their return. The climate in British occupied India proved to be harsh on complexion and many in British society regarded the physical change harshly. Young men had their portrait commissioned upon arrival to India for mothers, sisters, and spouses to prove that their health and safety were of no concern. The portraits were commissioned by the soldiers to send back to families, many of the portrait miniatures were created by British artists temporarily in India. One such artist was John Smart. Smart spent 1785–1795 in Madras where he was highly sought after by British soldiers. Portrait miniatures commissioned in Colonial India made from ivory are very different from the ones created with canvas and oil; not only due to the cost of the commission themselves but also due to the fragility and risk of packing and shipment. Shipment of ivory portrait miniatures were often taxed more heavily because of the higher risk of damage or loss. Due to the importance placed on status and the cost of shipping, many scholars have concluded the portrait miniatures not only point to the new methods of artistry but also the cultural history of the portrait miniature in Colonial India.

===Scotland===
Andrew Robertson (b. 1777, d. 1845), his brothers Alexander and Archibald also painters, created a style of miniature portrait, which consisted of slightly larger portrait miniatures measuring . Robertson&#x27;s style became dominant in Britain by the middle of the nineteenth century.

===Ireland===
Gustavus Hamilton (b. 1739, d. 1775) was instructed by Robert West at the National College of Art and Design in George&#x27;s Lane, Dublin, and was also an apprentice or pupil of Samuel Dixon of Capel Street, Dublin, where he was employed in colouring the basso-relievo prints of birds and flowers produced by Dixon.

Setting himself up as a miniature painter, he acquired an extensive and fashionable practice, patronized, says John O&#x27;Keeffe in his &quot;Recollections&quot;, by ladies of the first rank, and making &quot;a power of money by his pencil.&quot; From 1765 to 1768 he was living in Parliament Street, Dublin, then at No. 1 Dame Street, Dublin, at the house of Stock the hosier, and afterwards in College Green, Dublin.

He contributed miniatures to the Society of Artists in Dublin from 1765 to 1773. Shortly before his death he moved to Cork Hill, Dublin, and there died on 16 December 1775, aged 36. He was buried on 18 December at St. Werburgh&#x27;s Church, Dublin.

===France===
In the 18th century we know of miniatures by Nicolas de Largillière, François Boucher, Jean-Marc Nattier, and Jean-Germain Drouais; but the greatest names active in France are those of Peter Adolf Hall of Sweden, François Dumont of France, and Friedrich Heinrich Füger of Austria. The tiny pictures painted by the Blarenberghe family are by many persons grouped as miniatures, and some of the later French artists, as Pierre-Paul Prud&#x27;hon and Constance Mayer, executed miniature portraits. The popular artists in France, however, were Jean-Baptiste Jacques Augustin (1759–1832) and Jean-Baptiste Isabey (1767–1855). Their portraits of Napoleon and his court are exceedingly fine, and perhaps no other Frenchman painted miniatures so well as did Augustin.

===Spain===
Portrait miniatures were used in the Spanish court in the late 15th century, beginning with the political alliance between Henry VII of England (r. 1485–1509) and Ferdinand of Aragon (r. 1479–1519). The alliance celebrated the match between Catherine of Aragon (1485–1536) and Prince Arthur of England (1486–1502) with the Treaty of Medina del Campo in 1489. The promise of marriage commenced in the exchange of gifts including jewels and portrait miniatures of the young couple. The popularity of portrait miniatures to commemorate the promise of marriage began to circulate in each court soon after, especially Spain. The tokens of portrait miniatures to commemorate an alliance through marriage were considered extremely intimate and personal to the betrothed couple as well as their families. In Spain as well as the English courts, portrait miniatures were often adorned in jewels or kept in elaborate lockets that could either be concealed or taken out and admired on a whim.

The Spanish painter Francisco Goya (1746–1828) is known to have painted portrait miniatures for mourning and weddings beginning in 1806. The main medium used by Goya was oil but he was also commissioned for pencil miniatures. Between 1824 and 1825, Goya recorded over 40 miniature commissions on ivory while most portrait miniature artists dotted color onto the ivory, Goya shaped the lines of miniatures using water. Goya claimed his shaping technique was innovative and far different from the &#x27;accidental&#x27; ink wash technique developed in 1800s England by Alexander Cozens.

===Sweden===
Anton Ulrik Berndes played an important role in Swedish art at the end of the 18th century and beginning of the 19th. He produced around 600 portrait miniatures, and received commissions ranging from members of the lower bourgeoisie to the royal court.
===United States===

The English style of portrait miniatures was also exported to the American colonies; among the earliest recorded American miniaturists is Mary Roberts (died 1761), the first American woman to work in the form. In the late 18th century, Mary Way and her sister Betsey created portraits that included &quot;dressed miniatures&quot;, with fabric, ribbons, and lace affixed to the images. Miniaturist Amalia Küssner Coudert (1863–1932), from Terre Haute, Indiana, was known for her portraits of New York socialites and European royalty in the last decade of the 19th century. Recipients of her watercolor on ivory portraits included Caroline Astor, King Edward VII, Czar Nicholas II of Russia and Cecil Rhodes. One of the most famous miniature painters in American during the eighteenth century was Robert Field.
Many of the most prominent examples were produced by women artists, among them Eda Nemoede Casterton, who was selected to show her work in the prestigious Paris Salon. Nemoede Casterton used thin sheets of ivory rather than canvas for her paintings, a common practice among miniature portraitists. Around 1900, the United States experienced a revival of miniature portraiture, marked by the 1899 foundation of the American Society of Miniature Painters and the success of artists such as Virginia Richmond Reynolds, Lucy May Stanton, and Cornelia Ellis Hildebrandt. This has been reflected more recently by contemporary realist artists such as Dina Brodsky. Contemporary realist Ann Mikolowski was simultaneously a portrait miniaturist and illustrator of printed matter.

Portrait Miniatures and Mourning in Colonial America

Throughout the course of history, mourners have carried portraits with them to honor loved ones; this practice made its way to Colonial America in the mid 18th century. Portrait miniatures honoring the deceased could take many forms, such as rings, brooches, lockets, and small frame pictures. Prior to portrait miniatures, loved ones often received tokens of the deceased in the form of rings or lockets with inscriptions or images matching those in the coffin. The matching images and words created a type of bond, allowed surviving family to feel closer to their loved one. A shift in the eighteenth century from mourning death to celebrating life marked a change in the meaning behind tokens carrying morbid inscriptions and images. No longer did the tokens represent the bond between the departed and those left behind, they now represented a grim realization of mortality. The idea of gender also affected the view of mourning tokens; women were viewed as more emotional to carry tokens and society frowned upon men who carried such tokens. If men were to carry a token of a beloved one, an image of life rather than death would prove to be more becoming.

The first miniature portraits documented in Colonial America first appeared in the 1750s and may have appeared before then. These portraits were usually commissioned to remember someone who died suddenly from illness at a young age. The family of a twelve year old named Hannah had a locket commissioned to make her look like she did before she become ill. The locket carried a portrait of the young girl and had angel wings above her with the words &quot;NOT LOST&quot; written on the side. Portraits such as these carried hope and remembrance instead of the stigma of constant sorrow.

== Materials and techniques ==

The earliest miniatures were painted on vellum, chicken-skin or cardboard, or by Hilliard and others on the backs of playing cards, and also on very thin vellum closely mounted on to playing cards.

Vellum or primed calf-skin was considered an easy alternative to copper in the seventeenth century.

During the 18th century, watercolour on ivory became the standard medium. The use of ivory was first adopted in around 1700, during the latter part of the reign of William III.

Enamel: Portrait miniatures painted on enamel in oil with copper support was a method created in Italy during the 16th century. There is debate as to whether this method was attributed to Italian artists or Dutch artists. During the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, portrait miniature artist used enamel with a copper support in Germany, Portugal, and Spain. Many Dutch and German artists adopted copper as a medium further enhancing the images. Over time, only elite could afford the copper, forcing artists to stretched vellum, ivory, or paper. Dutch and German miniatures were painted in oil, and as a rule these are on copper; and there are portraits in the same medium, and often on the same material, attributed to many of the great Italian artists, notably those of the Bologna school. Samuel Cooper is said to have executed a few paintings in oil on copper. Beginning in the mid-17th century, many watercolors were conducted with vitreous enamel. Jean Petitot 1607–1691 was the greatest worker in this material, and painted his finest portraits in Paris for Louis XIV of France. His son succeeded him in the same profession. Other artists in enamel were Christian Friedrich Zincke (died 1767) and Johann Melchior Dinglinger. Many of these artists were either Frenchmen or Swiss, but most of them visited England and worked there for a while. The greatest English enamel portrait painter was Henry Bone (1755–1839). A great collection of his small enamel reproductions of celebrated paintings is in the British Royal Collection.Enamel stayed a consistent and robust alternative to portrait art miniatures during the 18th and 19th centuries.

Mica: Mica is a very thin mineral that can be shaved to transparent pieces also known at the time as &#x27;talc&#x27;. The paper thin material could be painted on with oil and placed over the portrait miniature so that the holder of the portrait miniature could dress up the subject or disguise the portrait.

Costume Overlays

Costume overlays were a technique in which artists were commissioned to paint a subject in costume or altered state of dress to hide the identity. Typically the portrait was commissioned with a thin removable overlay made from mica to conceal the identity of the subject. Concealing the identity of a miniature would have been necessary if the subject was an unpopular ruler, potentially causing harm if a person was caught carrying the picture. One such example is painting over a portrait in costume to hide the original portrait. Los Angeles County Museum of Art, Department of Costumes and Textiles discovered a series for portrait miniatures from England dating from the 1650s that appear to show the same woman in dress. The woman bore a striking resemblance to English monarch Charles I (1600–1649), who was executed in 1649. The king remained popular with a group of followers after his execution and many found subtle ways to honor the king. This discovery is only a glimpse as to how portrait miniatures could also serve as a way to commemorate loss as well as loyalty.

==Displays==
A number of museums display miniature original oil paintings including the Museum of Arts in Boston and the Astolat Dollhouse Castle when it is on public display. The National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. as well as the Victoria and Albert Museum in London carry a vast number of portrait miniatures among their larger portrait collections, many are also accessible to the public for online viewing.

<text>Nicholas Jon Barmby (born 11 February 1974) is an English football coach and former professional player.

As a player, he played as a midfielder spending nearly his entire career in the Premier League for Tottenham Hotspur, Middlesbrough, Everton, Liverpool and Leeds United. He then had a brief spell with Nottingham Forest in the Football League before finishing his career with home town club Hull City where during an eight-year spell he helped the club earn promotion from League One to the Premier League. He was capped 23 times by England between 1995 and 2001, and was part of the Euro 96 and Euro 2000 squads. Barmby is one of only nine players to have scored Premier League goals for six different teams (the others being Nicolas Anelka, Craig Bellamy, Darren Bent, Marcus Bent, Andy Cole, Peter Crouch, Les Ferdinand and Robbie Keane).

Following retirement, Barmby had a spell as Hull City manager, he later had a brief spell as first team coach at Scunthorpe United.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Growing up on the west side of Hull, Barmby played for local teams Springhead and National Tigers as a boy showing talent from a very early age. Consequently, he ended his education at the local Kelvin Hall High School (where he started in 1985) early to complete his studies at The Football Association&#x27;s School of Excellence, while also honing his skills for the professional game. His father, Jeff Barmby, was also a player in his younger days and became his son&#x27;s advisor and agent as his skills began to attract the attention of various clubs.

===Tottenham Hotspur===
Barmby eventually signed for Tottenham Hotspur, joining them on leaving school in the summer of 1990. His first game for Tottenham was against Hull City at Boothferry Park in a testimonial match for Garreth Roberts, and he scored two goals.

Having turned professional in April 1991 under the management of Terry Venables, he made his competitive debut against Sheffield Wednesday on 27 September 1992 in the FA Premier League, and established himself as a regular player that season, when still only 18 years old.

During his time at the club he became one of Ossie Ardiles&#x27; five-man attack, along with Jürgen Klinsmann, Teddy Sheringham, Darren Anderton and Ilie Dumitrescu. He played 100 games and scored 27 goals in all competitions for Spurs, playing on the losing side in two FA Cup semi-finals, before becoming Middlesbrough&#x27;s most expensive signing in a £5.25 million deal in June 1995.

===Middlesbrough===
Barmby set up the first competitive goal at the new Riverside Stadium for Craig Hignett. Barmby stayed at Middlesbrough for 17 months, before heading to Everton, who paid a record fee of £5.75 million for him, a small profit on the price they paid for him.

===Everton===
In his first season at the club, Barmby and his new team found themselves in a Premier League relegation battle. However, they survived with a 15th-place finish as Barmby made 25 league appearances and scored four goals. He managed just two goals from 30 appearances the following season as Everton finished just one place above relegation. Injuries restricted him to appearing in just 24 out of 38 league appearances in 1998–99, as he scored three goals. His final season at Goodison Park saw him miss just one league game and find the net nine times, though Everton finished only in 13th place. On 26 February 2000, Barmby scored a hat-trick in a 4–0 win against West Ham United.
After nearly four years at Everton, during which Barmby played 114 league games and scored 18 goals, he headed across Stanley Park to Liverpool for a fee of £6 million on 19 July 2000. It was the first time since striker Dave Hickson in 1959 that Everton had sold a player to Liverpool – although six players had moved in the opposite direction in the 41 years between Barmby&#x27;s transfer and that of Hickson.

Manchester United also expressed an interest in signing Barmby to cover for their missing players at the start of the 2000–01 season, but they were eventually outbid.

===Liverpool===
Barmby was involved in Liverpool&#x27;s successful season of 2000–01 in which they won the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup. He scored against his previous club Everton in the Merseyside derby in October 2000, and scored a penalty kick in the shootout against Birmingham City in the League Cup Final. An injury picked up in the FA Cup semi-final in April put his participation in the FA Cup and UEFA Cup finals in doubt. In the end he was left out of the FA Cup final squad but was on the bench for the UEFA Cup Final. The following season he started as Liverpool won the 2001 FA Charity Shield. However after persistent injury and lack of form blighted his second season at the club, Barmby was sold to Leeds United in August 2002 for a fee of £2.75 million, where he linked up with Terry Venables, his first manager at Tottenham. Barmby scored eight goals in his time at Liverpool, all of which came in the 2000–01 season: four in the UEFA Cup, two in the League, and one each in the FA Cup and the League Cup.

===Leeds United===
On 8 August 2002, Barmby signed for Leeds for £2.75 million. Despite scoring on his debut, Barmby made little impact at a Leeds side quickly sliding down the Premier League table, and missed much of the action during his two seasons with them in the Premier League. He spent a loan spell at Nottingham Forest during the 2003–04 season, scoring once against Gillingham, before moving to his hometown club, Hull City.

===Hull City===

In 2004, Barmby returned to his hometown team Hull City on a free transfer following Leeds&#x27;s relegation from the top flight. 
Barmby helped City to promotion from League One in his first season at the club. He scored nine goals, including the fastest goal in City&#x27;s history, after seven seconds in a match against Walsall on 6 November 2004. He played for Hull in the 2007–08 Football League Championship campaign, which ended in promotion through the Championship play-offs to the Premier League; a season earlier they had come close to being relegated to League One. 2008–09 was the first season in which Hull City played top division football. He scored his first goal of Hull&#x27;s first Premier League season against Sunderland on 20 December 2008, making him one of only five players to have scored for six different teams in the Premier League.

On 29 June 2010, it was announced by the incoming Hull City manager, Nigel Pearson, that Barmby would take his first steps into coaching, by being taken onto Pearson&#x27;s staff at Hull City for the 2010–11 Championship campaign, combining the role of coach with his playing duties.

==International career==
Barmby earned his first cap for England on 29 March 1995, coming on as a 64th-minute substitute in the 0–0 friendly draw against Uruguay at Wembley Stadium. He made his first start on 6 September, playing the whole game in the 0–0 draw with Colombia. On 23 May 1996, Barmby scored his first goals for England when he netted two goals in the 3–0 win against China at the Workers Stadium in Beijing. These goals ultimately sealed his place in England manager Terry Venables&#x27; 22-man squad for Euro 1996. Barmby went on to make three substitute appearances in the tournament, featuring in the 1–1 draw with Switzerland in the opening group game, in the 4–1 win against the Netherlands in the final group game, and in the 0–0 draw against Spain in the quarter-finals, a game England won on penalties. Had the shoot-out against Spain continued into sudden-death kicks, Barmby had been chosen to take England&#x27;s sixth penalty.

Barmby scored the first goal of Glenn Hoddle&#x27;s England tenure, he netted the opening goal in the 3–0 win against Moldova during qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup. This turned out to be his last cap for nearly four years.

Kevin Keegan recalled Barmby in May 2000 and named him in the preliminary squad for Euro 2000. He featured in the three warm-up games against Brazil, Ukraine, and Malta, before being named in the final squad on 1 June. Barmby made substitute appearances in the games against Germany and Romania as England were eliminated in the group stages.

Barmby scored England&#x27;s first goal under Sven-Göran Eriksson with the opening goal in a 3–0 friendly win against Spain at Villa Park. On 1 September 2001, he started in the 5–1 thrashing of rivals Germany during qualification for the 2002 World Cup. Barmby started in the 2–2 draw with Greece in October 2001, the result secured England&#x27;s qualification to the World Cup. This turned out to be his last cap for his country. He won a total of 23 caps for England and scored four goals.

==Coaching career==
===Hull City===
After Pearson left Hull for Leicester on 15 November 2011, Barmby took over as player caretaker manager. His reign got off to a fine start against Derby County by defeating them 2–0 at Pride Park Stadium. He announced his retirement from playing on 6 January 2012 before being appointed manager permanently on 10 January.

It was reported on 8 May 2012 that Barmby had been sacked as manager following a disciplinary meeting with the owners. This was later confirmed after he made comments about the owners and transfer money. He has since lost his appeal.

===Scunthorpe United===
On 29 March 2019, Scunthorpe United announced that Barmby would join former Hull City teammate Andy Dawson as a coach. Their first game in charge was against AFC Wimbledon which they lost 2–1. He left the club on 13 May 2019, when new manager Paul Hurst was hired.

==Personal life==
Barmby has a wife, Mandy, and two sons, Jack and George. Jack Barmby signed for Manchester United, before being signed by Leicester City in 2014. He moved on loan to the Portland Timbers of the MLS in March 2016. He has also represented England below senior level.

Barmby is a fan of Super League side Hull FC.

On 29 December 2023, Barmby was announced as the next member of Hull City&#x27;s Hall of Fame and would be inducted at the first home league game of 2024 against Norwich City.

<text>The telecommunications industries within the sector of information and communication technology is made up of all telecommunications/telephone companies and internet service providers and plays a crucial role in the evolution of mobile communications and the information society.

Traditional telephone calls continue to be the industry&#x27;s biggest revenue generator, but thanks to advances in network technology, telecom today is less about voice and increasingly about text (messaging, email) and images (e.g. video streaming). 
High-speed internet access for computer-based data applications such as broadband information services and interactive entertainment is pervasive. Digital subscriber line (DSL) is the main broadband telecom technology. The fastest growth comes from (value-added) services delivered over mobile networks.

Insight Research projected that telecommunications services revenue worldwide would grow from $2.2 trillion in 2015 to $2.4 trillion in 2019.

==Market segmentation==

Of all the customer markets, residential and small business markets are the toughest. With hundreds of players in the market, competitors rely heavily on price; success rests largely on brand name strength and investment in efficient billing systems. The corporate market remains the industry&#x27;s favorite. Big corporate customers are concerned mostly about the quality and reliability of their telephone calls and data delivery while being less price-sensitive than residential customers. Multinationals, spend heavily on telecom infrastructure and premium services like high-security private networks and videoconferencing. Network connectivity can also be provided to other telecom companies by wholesaling circuits to heavy network users like internet service providers and large corporations. 
===Value chain===
==Global players==
== Mergers and acquisitions ==
Around 24,800 M&amp;A deals have been conducted in the Telecommunication Industry with either the acquirer or the target company coming from the Telecommunications sector. In total over 5.712 bil. USD have been spent on M&amp;A between 1985 and 2018 in this industry. There has only been one big M&amp;A wave around 1999 and 2000. In most other industry there are three waves between 1990 and 2018. Since 1999 deal value shrunk by -90.12% and is expected to stagnate in 2018.

Here is a list of the top 10 Telecommunication deals in history ranked by volume:
==Recent developments==
The telecommunications sector has seen a large increase in the recent years. Whereas in 2015 there were 3.3 billion active mobile broadband subscriptions worldwide, in 2020 there were around 7.7 billion. This increase was due, in part at least, to the deployment of 4G LTE.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, telecommunications was used to track the spread of COVID-19 and was use by remote workers to conduct business during the COVID-19 lockdowns.

<doc id="928333" wikidata="Q1061856" url="?curid=928333" title="Shabu-shabu">
<text>Shabu-shabu () is a Japanese &quot;nabemono&quot; hotpot dish of thinly sliced meat and vegetables boiled in water and served with dipping sauces. The term is onomatopoeic, derived from the sound – &quot;swish swish&quot; – emitted when the ingredients are stirred in the cooking pot. The food is cooked piece by piece by the diner at the table. &quot;Shabu-shabu&quot; is generally more savory and less sweet than &quot;sukiyaki&quot;, another hot pot dish.

==History==
&quot;Shabu-shabu&quot; was invented in Japan in the 20th century with the opening of the restaurant Suehiro in Osaka, where the name was also invented. The president of the restaurant, Chūichi Miyake, registered the name as a trademark in 1952. &quot;Shabu-shabu&quot; became more and more popular in the Kansai region and in 1955 it was also added to the menu of restaurants in Tokyo and then spread throughout Japan.

There are two common theories about the origin of &quot;shabu-shabu&quot;. The first is that it comes from the Inner Mongolian hot pot known as instant-boiled mutton (&quot;shuàn yángròu&quot;), which was introduced to Japan after World War II by Japanese who had lived in Beijing. Both dishes are prepared by briefly swirling thin slices of meat in boiling broth, then eaten with sauce.

The other theory is that &quot;shabu-shabu&quot; originates from Japanese &quot;mizutaki&quot; hot pot, which is a popular type of &quot;nabemono&quot;. &quot;Mizutaki&quot; has various ingredients and versions but is always based on dashi or water without additional flavourings.

Compared with other Japanese hot-pot dishes such as &quot;sukiyaki&quot;, &quot;shabu-shabu&quot; is infrequently cooked at home in Japan. However, &quot;sukiyaki&quot; and &quot;shabu-shabu&quot; are both popular in many parts of Japan, and also in Japantowns in countries such as the United States and Canada. It is also popular in Taiwan and South Korea.

==Preparation==
The dish is usually made with thinly sliced beef, but some versions use pork, crab, chicken, lamb, duck, or lobster. Most often, ribeye steak is used, but less tender cuts, such as top sirloin, are also common. A more expensive breed of cattle, such as Wagyu, may also be used. It is usually served with tofu and vegetables, including Chinese cabbage, chrysanthemum leaves, &quot;nori&quot; (edible seaweed), onions, carrots, and shiitake and enokitake mushrooms. In some places, &quot;udon&quot;, &quot;mochi&quot;, or &quot;harusame&quot; noodles may also be served.

The dish is prepared by submerging a thin slice of meat or a piece of vegetable in a pot of boiling water or &quot;dashi&quot; (broth) made with &quot;konbu&quot; (kelp) and stirring it. Normally, the raw meat is dipped into the hot stock for just a few seconds, as the pieces are sliced paper thin so they will cook quickly. Putting all meat into the pot at one time may result in overcooking the meat. Cooked meat and vegetables are usually dipped in &quot;ponzu&quot; or &quot;goma&quot; (sesame seed) sauce before eating, and served with a bowl of steamed white rice. 

=== General order to put ingredients into the pot ===
# &quot;shabu-shabu&quot; some meat (the meat juices will add some flavor to the soup)
# add ingredients which need some time to cook such as carrots, shiitake mushrooms, Chinese cabbage, etc.
# add ingredients which are fast to cook such as tofu, green onions, mizuna and Chinese cabbage leaves.

Once the meat/fish and vegetables have been eaten, the soup stock will remain in the pot. The leftover broth from the pot can be customarily combined with rice, ramen or udon and the resulting dish is usually eaten last and called &quot;shime&quot; in Japan. 　

The variation with rice is also called &quot;zosui&quot;. When the cooked meat is served cold, it is called &quot;rei-shabu&quot;, which is often sold in convenience stores and supermarkets in Japan.

==Sauces and dippings==
A variety of sauces can be used to dip the meat and vegetables, including &quot;ponzu&quot; sauce and sesame sauce. Restaurants usually provide soy sauce, sesame paste,&quot; ponzu&quot; and several other condiment options, such as spring onions and Japanese pickled carrots, so customers can make the sauce according to their own preferences.

== Variations across Japan ==
Beef, pork or chicken is usually used for &quot;shabu-shabu&quot;, but variations using fish are also available. Some fish used are yellowtail (&quot;buri&quot;), greater amberjack (&quot;kanpachi&quot;), or red seabream (&quot;tai&quot;). Octopus and crab are also used. For vegetables, lettuce or sliced daikon radish can be used instead of Chinese cabbage.

Regional ingredients include:

* Tōhoku: Kelp (&quot;Wakame no Shabu-shabu&quot;)
* Kansai: Daggertooth pike conger (&quot;Hamo-Shabu&quot;)
* Toyama: Yellowtail (&quot;Buri-Shabu&quot;)
* Hokkaido: Octopus (&quot;Tako-Shabu&quot;)
* Kagoshima: Kurobuta pork (&quot;Kurobuta-Shabu&quot;)
* Nagoya: Nagoya Cochin, a famous Japanese chicken breed (&quot;Tori-Shabu&quot;)

<text>Bến Tre is a province of Vietnam. It is one of the country&#x27;s southern provinces, and is situated in the Mekong Delta. It is also famous for its coconuts and the Coconut Religion nationwide. Disconnected from the mainland, the province lies mainly on 2 river islands. It has land borders only with Vĩnh Long Province, which occupies the western tip of the southern river island.

==Etymology==
The origin of the province’s name is still unclear as it was first inhabited by the Khmer people, though some speculated it may have been called &quot;Kompong Russei&quot;. Its original name was then later altered by incoming waves of immigration and settlement by ethnic Vietnamese into &quot;Bến Tre.&quot; In Vietnamese, “Bến Tre” literally means “bamboo port”, which is quite inaccurate considering it is regionally famous for its Coconuts.

==History==
In what has been called &quot;the start of the Vietnam War&quot;, in January and February 1960, the Việt Cộng attacked and took temporary control of several districts in Bến Tre, then known as Kiến Hòa. The Việt Cộng set up &quot;people&#x27;s committees&quot;, and confiscated land from landlords and redistributed it to poor farmers. One of the leaders of the uprising was Madame Nguyễn Thị Định, who led the all-female &quot;Long Hair Army&quot;.

Although the South Vietnamese army (ARVN) recaptured the villages, uprisings spread to many other areas of South Vietnam. The uprisings were spontaneous rather than planned.

==Administration==
Bến Tre is subdivided into 9 district-level subdivisions.
The eight districts are
Ba Tri,
Bình Đại,
Châu Thành,
Chợ Lách,
Giồng Trôm,
Mỏ Cày Bắc,
Mỏ Cày Nam, and
Thạnh Phú.
There is also one provincial city of Bến Tre (capital).
They are further subdivided into 7 commune-level towns (or townlets), 147 communes, and 10 wards. To view the list of subdivisions, see List of communes in Bến Tre province.

==Geography==
Geographically, Bến Tre is wedged between the two main branches of the Tiền Giang River, which is itself one of the two main distributary of the Mekong. The province&#x27;s northern boundary is formed by the Tiền Giang&#x27;s main course, while the province&#x27;s southern boundary is formed by the Tiền Giang&#x27;s largest branch (which breaks away from the Tiền Giang just upriver from Bến Tre province). Between the Tiền Giang and its main branch are two smaller branches, passing through the middle of Bến Tre. As a result, this province may be considered having 2 main river islands and has land borders only with Vĩnh Long Province on its western tip.

The entire province is criss-crossed with a network of smaller rivers and canals. The extensive irrigation that this provides makes Bến Tre a major producer of rice, but also means that the area is prone to flooding. The Climate Change Research Institute at Cần Thơ University, in studying the possible consequences of climate change, has predicted that 51% of Bến Tre province can be expected to be flooded if sea levels rise by 1 meter. Bến Tre province is, on average, only above sea level.

==Transportation==
Construction on the Rạch Miễu Bridge, which links Bến Tre to neighboring Tiền Giang province to its north, was started in 2002. The bridge was finished and opened for traffic on 19 January 2009. Before that time, Bến Tre was only accessible to automobiles via ferry.

<text>Svartifoss (Icelandic for &quot;black waterfall&quot;, ) is a waterfall in Skaftafell in Vatnajökull National Park in Iceland, and is one of the most popular sights in the park. It is surrounded by dark lava columns, which gave rise to its name.

The base of this waterfall is noteworthy for its sharp rocks. New hexagonal column sections break off faster than the falling water wears down the edges.

These basalt columns have provided inspiration for Icelandic architects, most visibly in the Hallgrímskirkja church in Reykjavík, and also the National Theatre.

<doc id="928354" wikidata="Q1553312" url="?curid=928354" title="Revilo P. Oliver">
<text>Revilo Pendleton Oliver (July 7, 1908 – August 20, 1994) was an American professor of Classical philology, Spanish, and Italian at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. He was a co-founder of the John Birch Society in 1958, where he published in its magazine, &quot;American Opinion,&quot; before resigning in 1966. He later advised a Holocaust denial group. He was a polemicist for right-wing, white nationalist and antisemitic causes. 

Oliver attracted national notoriety in the 1960s when he published an article after the President John F. Kennedy assassination, alleging that Lee Harvey Oswald was part of a Soviet conspiracy against the United States. He was called to testify before the Warren Commission investigating the murder.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Oliver was born in 1908 near Corpus Christi, Texas. He attended two years of high school in Illinois. He wrote that he received &quot;one of the first mastoidectomies performed as more than a daring experiment&quot;. He relocated to California, where he studied Sanskrit, finding a Hindu missionary to tutor him, he wrote.

He later wrote that as an adolescent, he found amusement in watching evangelists &quot;pitch the woo at the simple-minded&quot;, attending performances of Aimee Semple McPherson and Katherine Tingley. He entered Pomona College in Claremont, California, when he was sixteen.

===Academia===
In 1930, Oliver married Grace Needham. He returned to Illinois, where he attended the University of Illinois and studied under William Abbott Oldfather. His first book was an annotated translation, from the Sanskrit, of &quot;Mricchakatika&quot; (&quot;The Little Clay Cart&quot;), published by the University of Illinois in 1938. He received his PhD in 1940. That same year, the University published his Ph.D. thesis: &quot;Niccolò Perotti&#x27;s Translations of the Enchiridion&quot;, which was republished in 1954 as &quot;Niccolo Perotti&#x27;s Version of the Enchiridion of Epictetus&quot;.

Oliver began teaching graduate classes. For a number of years he also gave graduate courses in the Renaissance, teaching in the Departments of Spanish and Italian. He said he read 11 languages.

Oliver worked in a military intelligence unit in the Signal Services during World War II, according to his writing. He wrote that he was in the War Department from 1942 until autumn 1945, and that he was &quot;responsible for the work of c. 175 persons&quot;.

Oliver left Washington, D.C. in 1945. He joined the University of Illinois in 1945 as an Assistant Professor, became an Associate Professor in 1947, and Professor in 1953. He published little in the academic press but later became known for politically conservative articles expressing anti-Semitism and white nationalism. He retired in 1977 from the University of Illinois as a professor emeritus.

===Conservative movement===
Oliver was an early book reviewer for &quot;National Review&quot; from 1956 until May 1960 when he was ousted by its editor, William F. Buckley Jr for his public antisemitism. Oliver also wrote for &quot;The American Mercury&quot;. Buckley, who aimed to make conservatism more respectable to Americans averse to antisemitism and extremism, kept a close friendship with Oliver but acknowledged privately that Oliver was antisemitic.

In 1958, Oliver joined as a founding member of Robert W. Welch, Jr.&#x27;s John Birch Society, an anti-communist organization. He was a member of its national board and associate editor of its magazine, &quot;American Opinion.&quot; In 1962, Buckley repudiated Welch and the &quot;Birchers&quot;, saying they were &quot;far removed from common sense&quot; and urging the GOP to purge itself of Welch&#x27;s influence. The repudiation drove a wedge in Buckley&#x27;s friendship with Oliver.

After the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Oliver wrote a two-part article called &quot;Marxmanship in Dallas&quot; published in March 1964 in &quot;American Opinion,&quot; the Birch magazine. It alleged that Lee Harvey Oswald had carried out the murder as part of a communist conspiracy to kill Kennedy, whom Oliver described as a puppet who had outlived his usefulness. In March 1964, Oliver was reprimanded by the University of Illinois&#x27; Board of Trustees, but was allowed to keep his position. Oliver testified in the fall of that year before the Warren Commission.

===White nationalism===
In 1966, Oliver embarrassed Welch by proclaiming that the world&#x27;s troubles would be ended if &quot;all Jews were vaporized at dawn tomorrow&quot; along with &quot;Illuminati&quot; and &quot;Bolsheviks&quot;. Alleging that Welch had tricked him or sold out to Zionist interests, he decried what he called &quot;the Birch hoax&quot;. He was &quot;forced to resign&quot; from the society on July 30, 1966. Oliver later claimed in 1981 to have discovered that Welch &quot;was merely the nominal head of the Birch business, which he operated under the supervision of a committee of Jews&quot;. Oliver is described as &quot;a virulent anti-Semite&quot; in Claire Conner&#x27;s memoir about the time, &quot;Wrapped in the Flag: A Personal History of America&#x27;s Radical Right&quot;. From the 1960s until his death, Oliver produced essays alleging Jewish conspiracies.

Oliver subsequently became involved with Willis Carto&#x27;s National Youth Alliance (NYA). Oliver mentored William Luther Pierce, founder of the National Alliance and author of &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;. Oliver is probably the author of the 1959 anonymous novel &quot;The John Franklin Letters&quot;, which was cited by Pierce as his most direct inspiration for &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;. He also mentored the neo-Nazi activist Kevin Alfred Strom. &quot;Oliver&#x27;s writings on Jews and race-mixing became an important part of neo-Nazi culture in the early twenty-first century,&quot; according to Andrew S. Winston of the University of Guelph.

In 1978, Oliver became an editorial adviser for the Institute for Historical Review, an organization devoted primarily to Holocaust denial. He was also a regular contributor to &quot;Liberty Bell&quot;, an antisemitic magazine of George P. Dietz.

Although originally a proponent that Christianity is essential to Western civilization, Oliver became convinced that Christianity, by promoting universality and brotherhood rather than racial survival, was itself a Jewish product and part of the conspiracy. In a 1990 article, he characterized Christianity as &quot;a spiritual syphilis&quot; that &quot;has rotted the minds of our race and induced paralysis of our will to live&quot;. Damon T. Berry, in his book &quot;Blood and Faith: Christianity and American White Nationalism&quot; (Syracuse University Press, 2017), devotes a chapter to Oliver, concluding that &quot;Oliver hated both conservativism and Christianity ... because they equally represented to him an ideological poison that was alien to the best instincts of the white race to defend its existence.&quot;

===Later years and death===
In 1994, suffering from leukemia and severe emphysema, he committed suicide at the age of 86 in Urbana, Illinois. His estate arranged to publish several works posthumously through Historical Review Press and Liberty Bell, as well as to attend to the needs of his wife Grace in her declining years.
==Name and pseudonyms==
&quot;Revilo P. Oliver&quot; is a palindrome—a phrase that reads the same backwards and forwards. Oliver wrote that his name had been given to first sons in his family for six generations.

He used the pen names &quot;Ralph Perier&quot; (for &quot;The Jews Love Christianity&quot; and &quot;Religion and Race&quot;) and &quot;Paul Knutson&quot; (for &quot;Aryan Asses&quot;). Oliver is sometimes credited as the author of the Introduction (credited to Willis Carto) to Francis Parker Yockey&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

<text>Altaf Hussain Hali ( – ; 1837 – 31 December 1914), also known as Maulana Khawaja Hali, was an Urdu poet and writer.

==Early life==
He was born in Panipat to Khwaja Ezad Baksh and was a descendant of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari. He belonged to the Panipat Ansari clan, whose members included Lutfullah Khan Sadiq, the Diwan-i-Khalisa and governor of Shahjahanabad in the Mughal empire, and Sher Afkan Panipati, the governor of Multan. Hali&#x27;s father died when he was nine years old and his mother suffered from dementia. He was in the care of his elder brother Khwaja Imdad Husain after the death of his parents and when he was fifteen, upon the forcing of the elder brother, married his cousin Islam-un-Nisa. Hali studied, and memorized, the Quran under Hafiz Mumtaz Husain, Arabic under Haji Ibrahim Husain and Persian under Syed Jafar Ali. Resentful of hindreance to his studies by marriage, at age seventeen he travelled to Delhi to study at the madrasa opposite Jama Masjid, which was called &#x27;Husain Baksh ka Madrasa.&#x27;

Hali composed an essay in Arabic that supported the dialectics of Siddiq Hasan Khan, who was an adherent of Wahhabism. His teacher, Maulvi Navazish Ali, belonged to the Hanafi school and when he saw the essay he tore it up. At this time Hali adopted the takhallus &quot;Khasta&quot;, which means &quot;the exhausted, the distressed, the heartbroken&quot;. He showed his work to the poet Ghalib, who advised him: &quot;Young man, I never advise anyone to write poetry but to you I say, if you don&#x27;t write poetry, you will be very harsh on your temperament&quot;.

After a three year stay in Delhi, 1852 to 1855, he returned to Panipat and his first son was born. In the following year he was employed at the Collector&#x27;s office in Hissar.

==Writing==
The Indian rebellion of 1857 was an armed uprising in British India against the oppressive and destructive British colonial rule and was also popularly remembered as the &#x27;First War of Independence&#x27;. This was a turning point in his life because he was an eyewitness to the catastrophe. His family took in a widowed girl who lived with them for the rest of her life. Her plight left a deep impression on Hali and he composed two poems on the condition of women: &quot;Munajaat-e-Beva&quot; (Supplication of the Widow) and &quot;Chup ki Daad&quot; (Homage to the Silent). Syeda Saiyidain Hameed called Hali &quot;Urdu&#x27;s first feminist poet&quot;.

In 1863, in Delhi, he was appointed tutor to the children of Nawab Mustafa Khan Shefta of Jahangirabad, a position he held for eight years. In 1871, he moved to Lahore, where he was employed at the Government Book Depot from 1871 to 1874, where his task was to correct Urdu translations of English books. This brought him into contact with a wide range of literature and led to him writing the first book of literary criticism in Urdu, &quot;Muqaddama-e-Shair-o-Shairi&quot;. This was published as an introduction to his collected poems, &quot;Divan&quot; (1890) and then on its own (1893). Annemarie Schimmel called Hali the &quot;founder of literary tradition in Urdu&quot;. He had by this time changed his takhallus from &quot;Khasta&quot; to &quot;Hali&quot;, which means &quot;contemporary&quot; or &quot;modern&quot;.

While in Lahore Hali saw a new form of Mushaira, where instead of reciting poetry at will, poets were given a subject to write about. This was begun by Muhammad Husain Azad and the Director of Public Education, W. R. M. Holroyd. Hali composed four poems for this purpose: &quot;Nishat-e-Umeed&quot; (Delight of Hope), &quot;Manazra-a-Rahm-o-Insaaf&quot; (Dialogue between Mercy and Justice), &quot;Barkha Rut&quot; (Rainy Season) and &quot;Hubb-e-Watan&quot; (Patriotism).

From 1874 until 1889 Hali taught at the Anglo Arabic School in Delhi. He was granted a stipend by the Chief Minister of Hyderabad in 1887 after which he immediately took retirement from the school to be able to devote himself full-time to creative writing. While at the Anglo Arabic School, he came into contact with Syed Ahmad Khan. He advised Hali to &quot;write something like &quot;Marsiya-e-Andalus&quot; (dirge for Spain)&quot; on the condition of the Muslims of India. Later Urdu writers called this moment: &quot;This is the place where the Quom got a poet and the poet got a Quom&quot;. Hali therefore began to compose his epic poem, the &quot;Musaddas e-Madd o-Jazr e-Islam&quot; (&quot;An elegiac poem on the Ebb and Tide of Islam&quot;). Khan acclaimed it upon its publication in 1879 in a letter to Hali:

It will be entirely correct if the modern age of Urdu poetry is dated from the date inscribed in &quot;Musaddas&quot;. I do not have the power of expression to describe the elegance, beauty and flow of this poem. ... I am undoubtedly its inspiration. I consider this poem among those finest deeds of mine that when God asks me what did you bring with you, I will say “Nothing but that I got Hali to write the &quot;Musaddas&quot;!”

He also called it the &quot;mirror of the nation&#x27;s condition and an elegy expressive of its grief&quot;. In the &quot;Musaddas&quot; Hali condemned what he saw as dogmatism, obscurantism and bigotry, and he attributed the decline of India&#x27;s Muslims to the discouragement of dissent and the placing of religious rituals above the spirit of religion. He concluded the poem by warning Muslims to repair their ship before it is ship-wrecked in a storm. 

The poem was very popular and apart from the first couple of editions, Hali dedicated the poem to the nation and took no royalties. Some scholars of Pakistani nationalism also consider the &quot;Mussadas&quot; an important text for the articulation of a future Muslim nation, Pakistan, which eventually was created in 1947. During an international seminar on Hali held in Delhi on 29 November 2001, scholars concluded that Hali could not have written the &quot;Musaddas&quot; without reading at least 5,000 pages of Islamic history.

After Khan&#x27;s death Hali wrote his biography, &quot;Hayat-e-Javed&quot;, which was published in 1901. He was awarded the title Shamsul Ulema (&quot;Sun among Scholars&quot;) by the government. Hali&#x27;s Mussadas-e-Hali also contains &#x27;Mehnat ki Barkaat&#x27;, which is an extract intended to spread awareness in Muslims.

==Death and legacy==
At the age of 52 in 1889, Hali finally returned to Panipat, where he shared home with his wife for the remaining twenty-five years of his life. Altaf Hussain Hali died in 1914. Pakistan Post issued a commemorative postage stamp in his honor on 23 March 1979 in its &#x27;Pioneers of Freedom&#x27; series. &quot;His great &#x27;Musaddas&#x27; is one of the most inspiring poems in Urdu literature and had a lasting influence on the minds and attitudes of the Muslims in the sub-continent and continues to inspire them to this day.&quot; 

According to a major Pakistani English-language newspaper, Altaf Hussain Hali and Maulana Shibli Nomani played key roles in rescuing Urdu language poetry in the 19th century, &quot;Hali and Shibli rescued Urdu poetry. They re-conceived Urdu poetry and took it towards a transformation that was the need of the hour.&quot;

In the same above-mentioned newspaper article, Baba-e-Urdu (Father of Urdu) Maulvi Abdul Haq is quoted as saying, &quot;Outstanding poetry happens when there is poetic departure and a poet is able to take universal meaning out of immediate events.&quot;

<text>An outwash plain, also called a sandur (plural: &quot;sandurs&quot;), sandr or sandar, is a plain formed of glaciofluvial deposits due to meltwater outwash at the terminus of a glacier. As it flows, the glacier grinds the underlying rock surface and carries the debris along. The meltwater at the snout of the glacier deposits its load of sediment over the outwash plain, with larger boulders being deposited near the terminal moraine, and smaller particles travelling further before being deposited. Sandurs are common in Iceland where geothermal activity accelerates the melting of ice flows and the deposition of sediment by meltwater.

== Formation ==
Sandurs are found in glaciated areas, such as Svalbard, Kerguelen Islands, and Iceland. Glaciers and icecaps contain large amounts of silt and sediment, picked up as they erode the underlying rocks when they move slowly downhill, and at the snout of the glacier, meltwater can carry this sediment away from the glacier and deposit it on a broad plain. The material in the outwash plain is often size-sorted by the water runoff of the melting glacier with the finest materials, like silt, being the most distantly re-deposited, whereas larger boulders are the closest to the original terminus of the glacier.

An outwash plain might contain surficial braided stream complexes that rework the original deposits. They may also contain kettle lakes, locations where blocks of ice have melted, leaving a depression that fills with water. The flow pattern of glacial rivers across sandar is typically diffuse and unchannelized, but in situations where the glacial snout has retreated from the terminal moraine, the flow is more channelized.

Sandurs are most common in Iceland, where geothermal activity beneath ice caps speeds up the deposition of sediment by meltwater. As well as regular geothermal activity, volcanic activity gives rise to large glacial bursts several times a century, which carry down large volumes of sediment.

The Gaspé Peninsula that makes up the essential part of southern Quebec (Lower St-Lawrence and Gaspé areas) also contains several examples of paleo-sandar, dating from the Pleistocene ice melt.
== The prototype sandur ==
One of the sandurs from which the general name is derived is , a broad sandy wasteland along Iceland&#x27;s south-eastern coast, between the icecap and the sea. Volcanic eruptions under the icecap have given rise to many large glacial bursts (&quot;&quot; in Icelandic), most recently in 1996, when the Ring Road was washed away (minor floods have also occurred since then). This road, which encircles Iceland and was completed in 1974, has since been repaired. The 1996 jökulhlaup was caused by the eruption of the volcano, with peak flow estimated to be compared to the normal summer peak flow of . Net deposition of sediment was estimated to be .

The main braided channels of are the Gígjukvísl and rivers, which incurred net gains of respectively during the 1996 jökulhlaup. In the Gígjukvísl there was massive sediment deposition of up to , which occurred closest to the terminus of the glacier. The erosional patterns of can be seen by looking at the centimetre-scale elevation differences measured with repeat-pass laser altimetry (LIDAR) flown in 1996 (pre-flood), 1997, and 2001. Of the overall deposition during the 1996 jökulhlaup, nearly half of the net gain had been eroded 4 years after the flood. These two rivers on the sandur display drastically different erosional patterns. The difference in sediment erosion can be attributed to the wide trench near the terminus where the Gígjukvísl flows, in contrast with the , which has braided flows directly onto the outwash plain. The Gígjukvísl river is where some of the highest level of sediment deposit occurred and also where the largest erosion happened afterward. This indicates that these massive jökulhlaup deposits may have a large geomorphic impact in the short term, but the net change on the surface relief could be minimal after a couple of years to a decade.

The observed change of from a diffuse to a channelized distributary system where it has the most observed sediment deposit has a significant impact on the development of the fluvial succession in the proximal zone. However, in order to have sustained active accretion across the entire sandur there needs to be a diffuse, multipoint distribution system. The system of accumulation on , which is a product of glacier retreat, can be seen as multiple regions of differing channel patterns that distribute sediment across the plain in dynamic configurations.

== Fossil sandar ==
Fossil sandar (i.e. no longer active) are found in areas which were formerly glaciated. An example would be the Usk Valley of South Wales where, towards the end of the last ice age, the receding Usk valley glacier left behind a series of recessional moraines and sandar deposits down-valley of them. Many of the sandar surfaces are still visible, albeit degraded over succeeding millennia. Extensive sandar are also recorded in the eastern part of the Cheshire Plain and beneath Morecambe Bay, both in northwest England. &#x27;Valley sandur&#x27; deposits are recorded from various localities in that same region.

<text>Whirlyball is a team sport that combines elements of basketball and jai alai with players riding &quot;Whirlybugs&quot;, small electric vehicles similar to bumper cars. Because play requires a special court, it is played in only a handful of locations in the United States and Canada.

==The game==
A Whirlyball team consists of five players. Players rides a Whirlybug and carries a scoop, with which to pass the ball, usually a Wiffle ball, or shoot at the goal, a circular target above the two opposite ends of the court. A score in Whirlyball is called a &quot;Whirlic&quot;.

Players are not allowed to leave their cars or to touch the ball with their hands. Other than that, almost anything is allowed, within certain bounds of safety, e.g., one is not allowed to ram a player from behind (four-point penalty).

The scoops provided for recreational use are manufactured by Mangum&#x27;s company, Flo-Tron Enterprises, while many players at the national level prefer to use a Trac Ball scoop due to the lighter weight. In order to use a Trac Ball scoop, players must use an industrial-strength heat gun to mold the scoop to fit the ball.

==Game origins==
The game was first invented in Utah in the 1960s by Stan Mangum. Whirlyball is a sport that combines lacrosse, bumper cars, and some aspects of basketball. It features two teams of five players riding Whirlybugs, which are specialized bumper cars that offer more agility and steering ability. A Whirlybug is similar to an electric bumper car. It is round, with a bumper going all the way around. Unlike most bumper cars, however, power is not provided by an overhead grid, but rather by alternating conducting plates that make up the floor of the court. A Whirlybug is steered by a handle that looks like a crank. This handle allows steering not just side to side, but also backwards.

The game is played on a court that allows for movement in the Whirlybugs, with the goal of players scoring the ball by making it into a target found on a backboard. The Chicago area of Illinois is a prominent area for WhirlyBall enthusiasts and features many possible venues for players to try their hand at this game. Other Whirlyball locations include Canada, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Ohio, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin, with Illinois and Minnesota being the states that have multiple locations. The only restriction that the sport of Whirlyball has is the height of the players. In order to be eligible to play Whirlyball you must stand at the height of four feet, six inches or taller. Players shorter than this height are prohibited from playing this sport. According to Flo-tron Enterprises, Inc., the sole company that makes WhirlyBall products and the Whirlybug, the game is meant to be a competitive team sport that can be played at any level. The highest level played in WhirlyBall is the international level.

==Whirlybug==
A Whirlybug is similar to an electric bumper car. It is round, with a bumper going all the way around. Unlike most bumper cars, however, power is not provided by an overhead grid, but rather by alternating conducting plates that make up the floor of the court. This means that Whirlybugs are more complex than traditional bumper cars, but this is necessary, as an overhead grid would obstruct play. A Whirlybug is steered by a handle that looks like a crank. This handle allows steering not just side to side, but also backwards. In this aspect, it is very different from a traditional bumper car.

One of the downsides to a Whirlybug&#x27;s controls, however, is the difficulty beginners will almost certainly have with them. One reason is that there is technically no reverse. This can make for an extremely difficult situation for a beginner who has run into a wall. A player must apply the throttle as they are twisting the handle in either direction. After a single rotation, the drive train reverses, and the car moves away from the wall. More experienced players may simply twist the crank a single time and then apply the throttle. The other problem with steering is that Whirlybugs often do not center the crank automatically, making it difficult for beginners to recover from a very tight turn or from &quot;reverse&quot;. Once the particulars of the steering are learned—usually in one or two games—the controls tend to be easy to use.

==Terminology==
* Whirlic: A score in Whirlyball, two points.
* Power Shot: Comparable to a lay-up in basketball.
* Slashing: Hitting an opponent scoop while going for the ball. In league play, a two-point penalty.
* Pillow Block: Driving the Whirlybug into an opponent&#x27;s bumper and attempting to slow them down by remaining there.
* Roll-Off: While contacting an opponent&#x27;s bumper, player does a 360-degree roll-off turn and continues momentum.
* Wall Bouncing: Running into the wall and spinning around to advance oneself or lose an opponent.
* Bounce Passing: Bouncing the ball off the floor while passing it to a teammate.
* The Back Door: The area to the side of the key where people frequently lurk to make a quick move to the basket.
* Key: The area directly under the basket. Similar to basketball.
* Dirty Whirly: Bumping an opponent from behind causing them to do a 180-degree turn around and continue backwards.

==Popularity==
Whirlyball is played as a competitive sport with organized leagues, but it is more commonly played for entertainment. Many Whirlyball locations have a sports bar atmosphere, offering billiards and other tabletop games to play between matches.

<text>Rulon Ellis Gardner (born August 16, 1971) is an American retired Greco-Roman wrestler. He won the gold medal at the 2000 Olympic Games, defeating Russia&#x27;s three-time reigning Olympic gold medalist Aleksandr Karelin in the final; Karelin was previously unbeaten for 13 years in international competition. Gardner won a bronze medal at the 2004 Games. In 2010, he was inducted into the National Wrestling Hall of Fame as a Distinguished Member.

== Personal background ==
Gardner was born in Afton, Wyoming. He is the son of Reed and Virginia Gardner and the last of nine children. His second great grandfather was Archibald Gardner, who was one of the early settlers of Star Valley, Wyoming. He attributes his strength to the physical labor that he performed growing up and working on the family&#x27;s dairy farm.

In 2005, Gardner published his autobiography (co-written by Bob Schaller), &quot;Never Stop Pushing: My Life from a Wyoming Farm to the Olympic Medals Stand&quot;, in which he describes his Greco-Roman wrestling career, his academic struggles (as someone who suffers from a learning disability) and an account of his near-death experience when stranded after a snowmobile accident.

As of 2011, Gardner worked as a motivational speaker, often appearing as a keynote presenter and event host. He has appeared at corporate events, celebrity golf tournaments, trade shows, and conventions. He also has licensing deals, as well as print and television endorsements.

In 2012, Gardner and his wife Kami filed for Chapter 7 Bankruptcy in a Salt Lake City Federal court, with $2.9 million in liabilities.

After the Athens Olympics, Gardner gained 210 pounds, culminating in a total body weight of 474 pounds. In January 2011, he was announced as a contestant on season 11 of the American reality television show, &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;. After 16 weeks on the show, Gardner had lost 173 pounds. Gardner shocked the trainers, staff, and contestants on the April 26 episode by announcing he would be leaving the show &quot;for personal reasons&quot;, and left the show without a final weigh-in. He did not appear on the final episode of the season, except in the background of scenes of other contestants.

=== Injuries ===
When Gardner was in elementary school, he was injured during a class show-and-tell, when his abdomen was punctured with an arrow.

In 2002, Gardner went snowmobiling with some friends in the mountains surrounding Star Valley, Wyoming. At one point, he became separated from the group. During his efforts to regain his composure and regroup, he fell into the freezing Salt River with his snowmobile. Unable to move any farther, Gardner decided to build a shelter and wait for a rescue team. He remained stranded for the next 18 hours. After several hours in his makeshift shelter, he stopped shivering, which led him to believe that he was dying. When he was eventually rescued, he was experiencing hypothermia and severe frostbite. Due to the physical damage, a saw had to be used to remove his boots. The harrowing experience cost Gardner the middle toe on his right foot, which he keeps in formaldehyde in a jar in his refrigerator, to remind him of his mortality. He told his story on a first-season episode of &quot;I Survived...&quot;.

On February 24, 2007, Gardner and two other men survived a crash when a light aircraft he was traveling in crashed into Lake Powell, Utah. The men swam an hour in 44 °F (7 °C) water to reach shore, and then spent the night without shelter. None of the three sustained life-threatening injuries.

== Educational background ==
Gardner attended Star Valley High School in Afton, Wyoming, and was a three-sport letter winner and standout in football, wrestling, and track and field. He was an All-State selection in both football and wrestling, and was also the 1989 Wyoming wrestling state heavyweight champion. In track and field, as a senior, he took second at the state finals in the shot put.

Gardner attended junior college at Ricks College (now BYU-Idaho) in Rexburg, Idaho, and as a sophomore won the NJCAA national heavyweight wrestling championship. He and his first wife Sheri lost their daughter, Stacey in a terrible car accident on December 26, 1990. He then earned a scholarship to attend the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. While at Nebraska, Gardner finished fourth in the 275 lb. weight class at the 1993 NCAA Championships, earning All-American honors. He graduated from the University of Nebraska–Lincoln with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in physical education. He attended both Ricks and Nebraska on wrestling scholarships.

== Wrestling career ==

=== Olympics ===
Gardner is known for his defeat of three-time reigning gold medalist Aleksandr Karelin at the 2000 Summer Olympics. Karelin had been undefeated for 13 years, and had not given up a point in six years, prior to his loss in the gold medal match to Gardner. Now even though this already seems impressive, its really put into perspective when you see Karelins record of 887 wins, and 2 losses, both loses by controversial 1 point decisions.&quot;blast from the past&quot;[19] Its more impressive when you learn that he only lost his first and last match, meaning he had an 887 win streak. Karelin had won the previous match against Gardner in 1997, with a score of 5–0.

In 2001, Gardner added a world championship to his list of accomplishments with a victory in the finals over Mihaly Deak-Bardos of Hungary. His win made him the only American to ever win both a World and Olympic title in Greco-Roman wrestling.

After the 2000 Olympics he suffered a series of injuries from both a snowmobiling and motorcycle accident. These injuries included an amputated toe and a dislocated wrist, but he still went on to win the U.S. Olympic trials for his weight class and then to compete in the 2004 Summer Olympics. He was unable to repeat his 2000 performance, coming away with the Bronze medal, and after his match, he placed his shoes in the middle of the mat as a symbol of retirement from competitive wrestling.

Gardner competed once in mixed martial arts, and in 2004 he became the host for a professional wrestling league called Real Pro Wrestling.

Gardner served as an analyst for NBC Sports coverage of Wrestling at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Gardner attempted a comeback for the 2012 Olympics but was unable to make the 264.5 pound max weight limit for the U.S. Olympic Trials and therefore ineligible to compete for a position on the Olympic team.

=== Mixed martial arts ===
On December 31, 2004, Gardner fought Hidehiko Yoshida in a judo vs wrestling mixed martial arts (MMA) bout for the Pride Fighting Championships at an event named PRIDE Shockwave 2004. Yoshida, in addition to being an Olympic gold medalist in judo, was a highly successful MMA fighter. Gardner, trained by Randy Couture at Team Quest, won the bout via unanimous decision.


== Honors and awards ==
Aside from his Olympic medals, his achievements include:
* U.S. Champion in 1995, 1997, and 2001
* James E. Sullivan Award for amateur athlete of the year, 2001
* Jesse Owens Award, 2001
* United States Olympic Committee Sportsman of the Year, 2001
* ESPY award for U.S. Male Olympic athlete of the year, 2001
* Inducted as a Distinguished Member of the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, 2010

<text>The Greater Khingan Range or Da Hinggan Range (; IPA: ) is a volcanic mountain range in the Inner Mongolia region of Northeast China.
It was originally called the Xianbei Mountains, which later became the name of the northern branch of the Donghu, the Xianbei.

==Geography==
The range extends from north to south. It is the watershed between the Nen and Songhua river systems to the east, and the Amur and its tributaries to the northwest.

==Population==
Its slopes are a relatively rich grazing area. The Khitan people lived on the eastern slopes before establishing the Liao Dynasty in the tenth century. Oroqen, a Tungusic people, live along the Greater and Lesser Khingan range in northeastern China and belong to the oldest autochthonous populations of the region. On the western slopes lived the nomadic people, who raised sheep and camels and used the Mongolian plateau for their pastoralist economy.

==In fiction==
The Greater Khingan Range is a key setting in the science fiction novel &quot;The Three-Body Problem&quot; (novel) by Chinese author Liu Cixin.

<doc id="928380" wikidata="Q26439" url="?curid=928380" title="Argun (Amur)">
<text>The Argun or Ergune () is a long river that forms part of the eastern China–Russia border, together with the Amur. Its upper reaches are known as the Hailar River () in China. The Argun marks the border (established by the Treaty of Nerchinsk in 1689) between Russia and China for about , until it meets the Amur.

== Name ==
The name derives from Buryat &quot;Urgengol&quot; &#x27;wide river&#x27; (&quot;urgen&quot; &#x27;wide&#x27; + &quot;gol&quot; &#x27;river&#x27;). Mongolian word &quot;ergün&quot; (in Traditional Mongolian alphabet) or &quot;örgön&quot; (in modern Mongolian) means &quot;wide&quot;. 

== Geography ==
The river flows from the Western slope of the Greater Xing&#x27;an Range in China&#x27;s Inner Mongolia, and forms the Chinese side of the two rivers that flow together to produce the Amur (Heilong). Its confluence with the Shilka at Ust-Strelka on the Russian side forms the Amur. The Argun is long including its upper course Hailar, and has a drainage basin of . Its main tributaries are the Urov, Uryumkan and Gazimur from the left, and the Gen He from the right.

==Kherlen–Argun–Amur==
In years with high precipitation, the normally exitless Hulun Lake may overflow at its northern shore, and the water will meet the Argun after about . The Kherlen–Argun–Amur system has a total length of .

==History==

In &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot; is a legend related to the Ergüne hun Mongol ancestry. In this legend, the Mongols prevailed over other tribes and carried such slaughter among them, that in living remained no more than two men and two women. These two families, in fear of the enemy, fled to the inhospitable terrain, which included only mountains and forests and to which there was no road. Among those mountains was the abundant grass and healthy climate of the steppe. Then, legend tells that in Ergune-Khun, Mongols multiplied and become masters of iron smelting and blacksmithing. According to legend, it is the art of melting iron that has helped them escape from the mountain gorges on scope of the current Mongolian steppes, to the Kherlen (Kelulun) and Onon River.

Prior to the emergence of the Mongols, the Amur River basin was home to certain tribes of Jurchen people, who founded the Jin dynasty (1115–1234) in northern China. The Manchu people who founded the Qing dynasty (1644–1912) additionally claimed descent from the Jurchens. Following the Russian conquest of Siberia in the 17th century, Russia-China relations were formalized in the 1689 Treaty of Nerchinsk, which established the Argun River as the China–Russia border. However, prior to the Amur Annexation of Outer Manchuria, China&#x27;s border extended further to include the so-called Sixty-Four Villages East of the River in present-day Amur Oblast, southern Khabarovsk, and all of Primorsky Krai. Although the subsequent Amur Annexation fixed the eastern Sino-Russian border at the Amur, it would only be at the 1991 Sino-Soviet Border Agreement when all Sino-Soviet border conflicts would be resolved.

<doc id="928385" wikidata="Q1194744" url="?curid=928385" title="Edict of Saint-Germain">
<text>The Edict of Saint-Germain (), also known as the Edict of January (), was a landmark decree of tolerance promulgated by the regent of France, Catherine de&#x27; Medici, in January 1562. The edict provided limited tolerance to the Protestant Huguenots in the Catholic realm, though with counterweighing restrictions on their behaviour. The act represented the culmination of several years of slowly liberalising edicts which had begun with the 1560 Edict of Amboise. After two months the Paris Parlement would be compelled to register it by the rapidly deteriorating situation in the capital. The practical impact of the edict would be highly limited by the subsequent outbreak of the first French Wars of Religion but it would form the foundation for subsequent toleration edicts as the Edict of Nantes of 1598.

== Prior legislation ==
During the reign of King Henry II, Protestantism had been subject to persecution in France under the Edicts of Chateaubriant, Ecouen, and Compiègne. This legislation aimed to correct what Henry felt was lax enforcement of prior heresy laws by the local courts, through the re-establishment of the Chambre Ardente and the sending out of special commissioners to take charge of the local court cases.

With the unexpected early death of Henry II during a joust in 1559, this new program of persecution was put on hold, as first the sickly Francis II and then Charles IX became king. Already in the reign of Francis II a new approach began to be forged, with the 1560 Edict of Amboise, which pardoned those convicted of religious offenses on the condition they went on to live good Catholic lives. The further legislation of the Edict of Romorantin in May later that year moved the trial of heresy cases to the purview of the ecclesiastical courts, which did not have the authority to impose death penalties.

This was followed in July 1561, during the reign of Francis&#x27; brother Charles IX, with the Edict of July, which reaffirmed Romarantin&#x27;s move of heresy cases to the ecclesiastical courts and removed the penalty of corporal punishment for heresy, alongside prohibiting investigation of neighbours&#x27; houses to find heretical services.

== The road to Saint-Germain ==
In the wake of the Conspiracy of Amboise, a failed attempt by several prominent Huguenots to seize power, the urgency of the need for religious peace was heightened. It was to this end that Charles, Cardinal of Lorraine announced plans for a national religious council to reconcile the two faiths.

Later that year, in an Assembly of Notables at Fontainebleau, the Moyenneur faction aimed to put forward a program of Gallican reforms to quell the abuses of the Catholic church that had angered the Protestants, allowing the faiths to reunify. This attempt would prove naïve, as the Protestant Louis, Prince of Condé came forward with a counterproposal for the two faiths to exist alongside one another, throwing the meeting into disarray. The assembly was however able to endorse plans for a national council to solve the religious question, endorsed in a royal edict on August 31, 1560.

On June 12, 1561, the decision was made to summon the national council on July 20. It would however be delayed and not open until September 9. The meeting which became known as the Colloquy of Poissy would be a failure, with the Calvinists under Theodore Beza unwilling to subscribe to the Confession of Augsburg proposed by Lorraine. Frustrated with the failures of the colloquy, Catherine appealed to Rome instead for doctrinal concessions regarding the taking of the Eucharist in both kinds. This too came to nought.

Unfazed by all this failure, Catherine arranged for carefully chosen moderate deputies from the various Parlements of France to attend a conference at Saint-Germain-en-Laye where they would eventually draw up the edict on January 17, 1562. Alongside two liberal representatives of each Parlement, members of the &quot;conseil privé&quot; and order of St Michael were invited. The Paris Parlement sent the famous liberal de Thou and the elderly cleric Viole. While the Guises and the Constable boycotted the event, Cardinal Bourbon and Tournon would attend, alongside François de Montmorency and the triumvir Saint André. The proceedings were led by Michel de l&#x27;Hôpital who tackled the subject of religion head on with the assembly, in contrast to prior laws where the notion of public order had been emphasised.

The edict written, it would be delivered to the Paris Parlement on January 23.

== Terms ==
=== Introduction ===
The edict was intended to be only a provisional solution to the religious problem, pending the hopefully-reconciliatory outcome of the general church Council of Trent. The edict made clear that it was not to be taken as approval of the &#x27;new religion&#x27; but a necessary expedient for as long as the king willed it. The king stated that he had come to see it as necessary because of the provisional nature of the edict of July and on the recommendation of his uncle Antoine of Navarre the princes, the privy councillors and the chief magistrates of the &quot;Parlements&quot;.

=== Parameters of worship ===
It outlined the spaces and times in which Protestant worship could occur: not in towns or under arms or at night. It could not occur in buildings that had been consecrated as churches. Sermons could not be held by itinerant preachers within a city. Exceptions were made for noble estates upon which the faith could be practiced freely. Further services could be held within towns in houses if they were only for the members of the household. The crown superseded its previous edict of July such that when Protestants are meeting outside of towns, they are not to be troubled by men of any quality. If people sought to do them harm during their comings and goings, magistrates had to intervene and punish them.

The king&#x27;s officers were always o be granted access to the sites of worship if they requested entry. The pastor was obligated to inquire into the identity of attendees of a Protestant service so that they could be handed over to the authorities easily if they needed to be arrested.

=== Other terms === 
Protestants would not be allowed to levy taxes towards their religious buildings, and would have to rely on voluntary donations. The political law of the Roman church as it related to marriage and holidays was to be maintained by them, and they were to return any property they had acquired or stolen from the Catholics in the course of the last few troubled years. There could be no creation of laws or magistrates among the Protestants independent from the crowns and Catholic church&#x27;s offices. All Protestant synods were to occur either with the permission or attendance of the Lieutenant-General of the respective province. Reproachful language against the Catholic church was made a misdemeanour. Iconoclasm and sedition were to be punished with death. Likewise death sentences for distributing prohibited books. Priests must swear to uphold this edict, and were ordered not to manufacture further heresies or preach contrary to the Nicene Creed. Priests of either faith were forbidden from inciting their flocks to violence.

== Registration and resistance ==

=== Paris Parlement ===
The Paris Parlement resisted the registering of the edict, a necessary prerequisite to it becoming law, and remonstrated against the crown. They were backed in their disapproval by the city council, the clergy and the Sorbonne. They were buoyed in their opposition to the edict by the fact their pay was in arrears, which they saw as useful leverage against registering.

====Edict examined====
The edict was read before the assembled Parlement on January 24 in the presence of Marshal Montmorency and Antoine of Navarre, with an implied threat that the Parlement should register it immediately. Even the moderate Parlementaires did not accept this, however, and both the ultra Le Maistre and moderate de Harley demanded copies of the edict, so they could apply proper scrutiny to it. Montmorency oversaw the printing of copies at the weekend and by the Monday several copies were in &quot;Parlementaire&quot; hands. The crown, eager to hurry these proceedings along, sent representatives every couple of days to the Parlement to keep up the pressure. On February 7, having voted, the Parlement announced they could not verify or publish the edict and would send a remonstrance to the crown. To explain this de Thou and Viole were sent back to the crown.

The remonstrance was drawn up on February 12 and signed by Le Maistre and Gayant. They argued in their remonstrance that the solution for disorder was to expel all Protestant pastors, dismissing the notion the Protestants were a sizeable enough minority as to require managing. On February 14 de Thou and Viole were harangued by the king, who explained that the court did not understand the situation of the country like the crown did. He gave assurances, however, that he would always remain a Catholic, and clarified a contentious passage of the bill relating to official attendance at Protestant services, as only being a police matter.

==== Moderates defect ====
This in hand de Thou returned on February 16 to Parlement, announcing he now felt comfortable registering the edict. The other moderates, de Harlay and Baillet, concurred. Yet even with the moderates on their side the crown&#x27;s forces lacked a majority in the court, and the bill was voted down again on February 18.

Catherine arrived in Paris on February 20, and summoned Viole, who explained that members of the court had suggestions on an alternative proposal. A meeting was arranged for February 23 to discuss this, though only 69 members were present, and they were largely on the conservative edge of the court.

==== Counter proposal ====
The members of the Parlement opposing the edict suggested banning all Protestant services, exiling pastors, banning all non-Catholic property transactions, and making all royal officials sign a profession of faith. Catherine received this on February 25, and prepared her own response to be delivered by Charles, Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon. In this they argued the courts&#x27; proposal was simply impractical in the current situation, and that the Parlement was worsening the situation in the country, pushing the Protestants towards arming. Moreover, Charles highlighted other Parlements had already registered the edict and had seen disorder fall resultingly. On March 4 students rioted in the Palais de Justice, demanding the bill be registered and threatening to seize temples if they were not given any.

==== Registration ====
All this finally pushed the Parlement into capitulating, with the &quot;avocat du roi&quot; du Mesnil who had led the opposition crossing the aisle to support it along with the &quot;gens du roi&quot;. On March 5 it was agreed to register the edict the following day. Five members, including Le Maistre and Saint-Andre, who led the courts&#x27; ultra wing, absented themselves from the final registration. The courts&#x27; approval was, moreover, disclaimed in the Parlement&#x27;s secret register.

=== Other Parlements ===
The Parlement of Rouen proved more malleable, and registered the edict on February 16. The Parlement of Dijon refused to register the edict, and would not be compelled to prior to the outbreak of civil war, which rendered it a dead letter. The Parlement of Aix-en-Provence would prove particularly resistant to registering the edict, and would, after their continued resistance post-Amboise, have their most recalcitrant members dismissed from the Parlement.

== Enforcement and resistance ==
Most of the princes of the realm opposed the edict, with the exceptions of the Prince of Condé, Antoine III de Croy, Count of Porcien, and Charles, Prince of La Roche-sur-Yon. Antoine of Navarre, who was Lieutenant-General of the Kingdom, voted against the edict in council, and appealed for Guise to return to Paris to aid his opposition.

Several commissioners had been sent out into the regions of Guyenne, Languedoc and Provence in late 1561, with the hopes of quieting the disorder that had engulfed the provinces over the previous year. To achieve this they were given broad powers, and with the establishment of the Edict of Saint-Germain, they were tasked with ensuring its registration and enforcement in their respective areas. They were provided with assistance from the lieutenant-governors of their respective provinces to offer support, alongside the ability to refer cases up to the court if they proved tricky to determine.

=== Provence ===
In Provence, the commissioners Fumée and Ponnat were faced with the rebellious first consul Flassans, who had taken up arms and was terrorising the region&#x27;s Protestants. He refused to meet the commissioners or disarm. With the authorities of Aix refusing entry to the commissioners they set themselves up at Marignane and called officers out to meet with them; only Flassans refused among the municipal officers. The clergy capitulated and met with them on February 5. This allowed them access to the town and they set about working on their commission. After the defeat of Flassans in the field, it was decided not to prosecute his followers. In the meanwhile they set about replacing recalcitrant consulate members in April, though by September all of them had been let back into the political fold, including Flassans. Such were the difficulties enforcing the edict that Provence would be exempt from the Edict of Amboise regarding Protestant churches.

=== Languedoc ===
In Languedoc the situation was reversed, and it was the task of the commissioners to restore the Catholic clergy to their office, and remove the Protestants from the churches they had occupied in the towns. The Huguenots of Nîmes and Montpellier petitioned the commissioners to be allowed to continue private worship in the towns they occupied. In this task the commissioners were largely unsuccessful.

=== Guyenne ===
In Guyenne, the commissioners Compaing and Girard were delayed in their arrival, and thus de Montluc and de Burie oversaw the appointment of two replacement commissioners in their stead, who lacked the broad remit of the royally assigned ones. The Bordeaux Parlement sought to interfere, arguing it had the local knowledge to better and more affordably provide justice in the region, despite this being the very thing the commissioners were trying to avoid. When Compaing and Girard finally arrived, they quickly became unpopular with the local nobility and Montluc, who perceived their decisions as favouring the Protestant party. Burie and Montluc argued against their interpretation of the Edict of Saint-Germain, saying it shouldn&#x27;t introduce Huguenot ministers into areas they had not been in before. The Cardinal of Armagnac joined in these attacks on the commissioners claiming they had granted minister requests without consulting the local clergy (which was not a provision of Amboise.) With all these attacks they were finally dismissed from their offices.

== Vassy and civil war ==
Having been called back to Paris by Navarre, Francis, Duke of Guise stopped en route on March 1 at the town of Vassy, which had become a Protestant stronghold in the largely Catholic countryside of Champagne. Enraged by the sound of Protestant bell ringing in the town, he and his company of gentlemen decided to enter, on the pretext of hearing mass. In the town he was further incensed to find that the Protestants were meeting in the castle district, which was on his property.

Controversy arose later over the legality of the service Guise had encountered. While this meeting took place after the issuance of the Edict of Saint-Germain, it took place before the Parlement of Paris had been forced to register it.

Guise sent out a gentleman ahead of him, who got into an altercation at the door to the barn where the Protestants were worshipping. Violence ensued and, as Guise&#x27;s company rushed forward, a massacre began, with 50 parishioners killed. Continuing onto Paris despite Catherine&#x27;s orders for him to come to her and explain himself, he entered the city to a hero&#x27;s welcome.

In the city Condé and his men were present, and thus a potential powder keg if he and Guise crossed paths. Recognising this, Catherine ordered both to vacate the city, but only Condé complied, heading to Orléans where he raised the standard of rebellion on April 2 beginning the first French War of Religion.

<doc id="928400" wikidata="Q5622159" url="?curid=928400" title="Guy Chouinard">
<text>Guy Camil Chouinard (born October 20, 1956) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played in the 1970s and 80&#x27;s for the Atlanta Flames, Calgary Flames, and St. Louis Blues. He has also had a lengthy career as a coach in the QMJHL since retiring as a player. He is now head coach in Quebec&#x27;s college hockey league with the Champlain-St. Lawrence Lions in Quebec City.

==Playing career==
As a youth, Chouinard played in four consecutive Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournaments from 1966 to 1969, with the Quebec Citdelle and Quebec Beavers minor ice hockey teams from Quebec City.

Chouinard was selected by the Atlanta Flames with the 28th overall pick in the 1974 NHL Entry Draft, following a successful junior career with the Quebec Remparts in which he was a regular at the age of 15. He was one of the first underage players available in the entry draft after the National Hockey League&#x27;s decision allowing the drafting of underage players. While playing with Atlanta, he set records for scoring goals in six consecutive games from November 14 to November 24, 1978; he was the first Flame to score 50 goals in a season in the 1978–79 season. Chouinard scored the final goal in Atlanta Flames history during the 1979-80 NHL playoffs in a 5-2 home team loss against the New York Rangers. He remained with the team when it relocated to Calgary for the 1980–81 season. He left the Flames franchise as its all-time leader in points (529) and assists (336) (records since broken) on September 6, 1983, when he was traded to the St. Louis Blues for future considerations.

After playing in the first nine games of the 1984-85 season in the International Hockey League with Peoria, Chouinard opted to retire.

==Coaching career==
Chouinard has also had a brilliant career (more than 10 years) coaching in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, notably for the Victoriaville Tigres, Quebec Remparts, and Prince Edward Island Rocket and was enshrined in the &quot;QMJHL Hall of Fame&quot; in 2005. He has coached the second most games in the QMJHL (988), most wins as a coach (515) and most championships as a coach (4).

From 2002 to 2006, he coached in the Ligue Nord-Américaine de Hockey, a minor professional league in Quebec, first with the Trois-Rivieres Vikings, then the Thetford-Mines Prolab. He was fired as the Prolab head-coach on January 13, 2006, after a 7–3 loss against the Saint-Hyacinthe Cristal. With the Prolab, his record was 45 wins and 48 loss (including 10 shootout loss and 2 losses in overtime).

Chouinard was hired by the QMJHL&#x27;s Prince Edward Island Rocket to replace Yanick Jean as head coach, on October 22, 2007. He was relieved of his duties on October 6, 2009.

==Other==
Chouinard was nicknamed &quot;Gramps&quot; because he appeared much older than he really was. He is not the only member of his family to play professional hockey; he is the older brother of former minor-leaguer Jean Chouinard and the father of Eric Chouinard, who currently is in the Grenoble Bruleurs de loups organization. His nephew, Marc Chouinard, played in the NHL for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim, Minnesota Wild and Vancouver Canucks.

<doc id="928407" wikidata="Q2710675" url="?curid=928407" title="Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops">
<text>Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops (PASGT, pronounced ) is a combat helmet and ballistic vest that was used by the United States military from the early 1980s until the early or mid-2000s, when the helmet and vest were succeeded by the Lightweight Helmet (LWH), Modular Integrated Communications Helmet (MICH), and Interceptor body armor (IBA) respectively.

Designed in the mid-1970s as a replacement for the M1 helmet and previous fragmentation vests, prototypes of the PASGT were tested in the late 1970s before being fielded in the early 1980s. Around the early or mid-2000s, the PASGT vest began being replaced by the IBA and the PASGT helmet was replaced soon thereafter with the LWH and MICH. As of 2018, the only remaining U.S. military users of PASGT in any capacity are the U.S. Army Reserve and the U.S. Navy, the latter of which retains the PASGT helmet for use by sailors aboard its warships, in addition to a PASGT-derived vest known as the &quot;U.S. Navy Flak Jacket&quot;.

==Name==
PASGT is an acronym, standing for Personnel Armor System for Ground Troops. When used by itself, PASGT refers to both the vest and helmet together.

In the U.S. military, the PASGT helmet was most commonly known by its wearers as simply the &quot;Kevlar&quot;. The nickname has since been adopted for usage with other helmets. The PASGT helmet was also referred to by its wearers in the U.S. military as the &quot;K-pot&quot;, similar in name to the colloquial nickname &quot;steel pot&quot; for the steel M1 helmet, which was in widespread U.S. military usage from the 1940s to the 1980s, including the Vietnam War. The PASGT helmet was also, but less commonly, known by its wearers as the &quot;Fritz&quot; helmet for its resemblance to the Stahlhelm, which was the standard helmet used by the German military forces in the First and Second World Wars.

On the other hand, the PASGT vest was colloquially known as the &quot;flak jacket&quot; or &quot;flak vest&quot; by its wearers in the U.S. military, a continuation of the nickname from earlier nylon and fiberglass-based protective vests.

==Helmet==

The PASGT helmet is a combat helmet first employed by the U.S. military in 1983 and eventually adopted by many other military and law enforcement agencies internationally. The shell is made from 19 layers of Kevlar, a ballistic aramid fabric treated with a phenolic resin system, and is rated at Threat Level IIIA. The helmet offers protection against shrapnel and ballistic threats. It meets the 1800 requirement of MIL-STD-662 E. It weighs from (size extra small) to (extra large).
===Overview===
The PASGT helmet is typically painted olive drab, though other colors such as tan, grey, and black could also be used. Camouflage was available in the form of cloth helmet covers with varying camouflage patterns, such as woodland, six-color desert, and three-color desert. Some PASGT helmets were retrofitted with newer camouflage colors, such as the Universal Camouflage Pattern and MultiCam.

Outside military use, the PASGT helmet has been used by SWAT teams, where it is often painted black. It has also been used by United Nations peacekeepers, where it is often painted United Nations blue.

When worn with a helmet cover, the PASGT helmet is often fitted with an elastic band around it that has two light recharging glow patches (sometimes known as &quot;cat eyes&quot;) on the rear, intended to reduce friendly fire incidents. These bands are also used to hold vegetation or small personal items, as with the M1 helmet before it. These bands can have names and blood types printed on them to identify the wearer and their blood type in the event of a casualty. In the U.S. Army, PASGT helmets often featured a patch with the wearer&#x27;s rank insignia on it stitched onto the front, and/or a second patch showing the symbol of the wearer&#x27;s unit on the sides. The U.S. Marines wore the Eagle, Globe, and Anchor insignia on the front of the helmet as an iron-on transfer, similar to the one worn by Marines on the breast pocket of the BDU. This practice continued with the adoption of the LWH, but fell out of use and was discontinued because the mounting base for night vision devices covered the emblem, and required a hole in the fabric to attach, defacing the symbol.

===Development===
The PASGT helmet was developed by the U.S. Army Soldier Systems Center after the Vietnam War during the mid-to-late 1970s. It completely replaced the steel M1 helmet in U.S. military service by the end of the 1980s. It first saw use in combat in 1983 during Operation Urgent Fury in Grenada, became standard issue for the U.S. military in 1985, and completely replaced the M1 helmet for frontline troops by the end of the decade. Army units stationed in Alaska were the last to receive the helmets, some not getting the PASGT until 1988.

===Accessories===
Various add-on accessories were developed for the PASGT helmet, including an improved chinstrap to keep the helmet stable when worn by paratroopers conducting airborne operations, as well as a helmet mount assembly to attach night vision goggles, and a riot protection helmet visor mount.

===Replacement===
The PASGT helmet was replaced in U.S. military service by the Lightweight Helmet for the U.S. Marine Corps and the Modular Integrated Communications Helmet by the U.S. Army, which was in turn replaced by the Advanced Combat Helmet.

Both were eventually replaced by the Enhanced Combat Helmet (ECH) around 2012 and 2014.

The PASGT system is still used by some U.S. allies and still sees some continued limited use in the U.S. military as of 2017, serving as one of the options available for sailors assigned to duty aboard U.S. Navy and Coast Guard vessels.

==Vest==

The PASGT vest was the U.S. military&#x27;s standard upper torso body armor from the mid-1980s up until the early 2000s, when it was replaced by the Outer Tactical Vest of the Interceptor body armor system. The PASGT vest replaced the M-69 Fragmentation Protective Body Armor nylon vest used by the Army, and the M-1955 Fragmentation Protective Body Army nylon and doron plate vest used by the Marine Corps.

The PASGT vest used Kevlar for the first time in the U.S. military&#x27;s body armor, unlike the ballistic nylon that was used in the models of body armor that preceded it. While generally incapable of stopping rifle bullets, the PASGT vest provided better protection against shrapnel and reduced the severity of injuries from small arms fire when compared to the M-69. Despite its ability to stop pistol rounds, including 9×19mm Parabellum FMJ, the vest was only ever designed or intended to stop fragmentation without injury to the user. The PASGT vest weighs approximately , a small increase over the previous model. Based on testing conducted for the Brass Fetcher Ballistic Testing Company, former ARDEC research engineer John Ervin stated that the PASGT vest is equivalent to NIJ level II or IIA protection: able to stop multiple 124-grain 9×19mm FMJ pistol rounds to its main torso panels (front and back), but susceptible to several closely spaced rounds or shots to the thin neck and shoulder panels. Another independent test, featured in the magazine &quot;GunNews&quot;, claimed that the PASGT vest could stop .357 Magnum Federal 125 grain JHP, .357 Magnum S&amp;W 158 grain JSP, 9mm Federal 115 grain FMJ, and 9mm +P+ Corbon 115 grain FMJ at a range of , though was penetrated by a second closely spaced shot of 9mm Federal FMJ after the first.

===Appearance===
The PASGT vest is typically covered with woodland pattern nylon fabric, either the ERDL pattern or U.S. Woodland. A very limited number of vests were made in olive drab, but only woodland versions were issued to U.S. forces. Like the PASGT helmet, camouflage covers were available to be worn atop the vest in various patterns. Early camouflage covers were in DBDU but later came in the DCU pattern.

===Development===
The PASGT vest was designed in 1975 and was tested by in the late 1970s before being fielded in the early 1980s.

====U.S. Navy Flak Jacket====
In January 2000, the U.S. Navy began using a derivative variant of the PASGT vest known as the &quot;U.S. Navy Flak Jacket Mk 1, Mod 0&quot;. This vest was still being used by the U.S. Navy as late as April 2017. The USN Flak Jacket is sage green or brown in color. Although this vest is quite similar in appearance to the PASGT vest, it actually is a different model of vest altogether.

===Accessories and usage===
In order to provide protection against high velocity bullets, the PASGT vest was, in 1996, combined with the Interim Small Arms Protective Overvest (ISAPO) pending the adoption of Interceptor body armor. The ISAPO weighed about and consisted of a carrier to hold two protective ceramic plate inserts. A PASGT armor system with overvest weighed more than and was criticized by many U.S. troops as unacceptably cumbersome in combat. The ballistic fill consists of 13 plies of . water repellent treated Aramid (Kevlar 29) fabric. The inner and outer cover, 
shoulder pads and front closure flap of the vest are water repellent treated 8 oz. ballistic nylon cloth.

While it had been phased out as frontline body armor by the start of the Iraq War in 2003, the PASGT vest saw some limited wear and usage by U.S. military personnel during the early stages of the war, where it was worn behind the frontlines by rear-echelon support personnel and navy sailors such as Seabees. Some U.S. Army soldiers used old PASGT vests as makeshift armor for their vehicles in the absence of actual up-armor kits.

===Replacement===
The PASGT vest was succeeded in U.S. military service by the outer tactical vest of the Interceptor body armor system, which was, in turn, partly replaced by the Modular Tactical Vest, Improved Outer Tactical Vest, and Scalable Plate Carrier. However, the PASGT vest still sees some limited use in the U.S. military as of 2016, where it serves as one of many vests for sailors assigned to duty on board U.S. Navy vessels.

<text>Eric Guy Chouinard (born July 8, 1980) is an American-born Canadian former professional ice hockey player who played in the National Hockey League (NHL) with the Montreal Canadiens, Philadelphia Flyers and Minnesota Wild.

==Playing career==
Chouinard was born in Atlanta during his father&#x27;s days with the Atlanta Flames, but raised in both Calgary, Alberta and Cap-Rouge, Quebec. As a youth, he played in the 1993 Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament with a minor ice hockey team from Sherbrooke.

Chouinard has played for Team Canada in international competition despite getting offers to play for Team USA. After scoring 296 points in 180 games with the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, he became a 1st-round draft choice (16th overall) by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. Since then, he has also played for the Philadelphia Flyers and the Minnesota Wild, where he played alongside his cousin, Marc Chouinard, during the 2003–04 season.

In 2006–2007, Chouinard played four games in Switzerland for HC Sierre-Anniviers. He received an offer to play for the Straubing Tigers of the German DEL where he played until January 19, 2009 when he was suspended by the team.

On September 2, 2009 Chouinard signed a contract with the Nurnberg Ice Tigers of the Deutsche Eishockey Liga. On January 15, 2011, he signed a new two-year contract extension with the Ice Tigers that will take him through the 2012–2013 season.

Approaching his final professional years, Chouinard played three seasons with Brûleurs de Loups of the French Ligue Magnus before ending his career by returning to Germany for a single season in 2017–18 with the Bayreuth Tigers of the DEL2.

==Personal life==
Chouinard is the son of former Atlanta Flames star Guy Chouinard, and the cousin of Marc Chouinard.

<text>Vector Marketing is a multi-level marketing subsidiary company and the marketing arm of Cutco Corporation, an Olean, New York–based cutlery manufacturer.

The company has been the subject of criticism and lawsuits for its business practices and has been accused of being a multi-level marketing company. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; states that Vector meets the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) definition of a multi-level marketing company which is &quot;businesses that involve selling products to family and friends and recruiting other people to do the same&quot; because they sell their product through person-to-person sales. Salespeople are generally young and recruited from high school or college; Vector&#x27;s recruitment tactics have been described as deceptive, and they have faced numerous lawsuits over their pay structure and treatment of its salespeople, who are independent contractors instead of employees. Vector claims they are a single-level direct selling marketing company, not a multi-level marketing company or a pyramid scheme.

The company was founded in 1981 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The company sells via individual sales representatives who sell Cutco cutlery via one-on-one demonstrations, typically through home visits.

==History==
Vector Marketing Corporation was founded in 1981 by Don Freda in Glenolden, Pennsylvania, as an independent seller of Cutco Cutlery products manufactured by the Alcas Corporation. It quickly became one of the top sellers of Cutco products, and in 1985, it was acquired by Alcas, which was struggling with sales following its split from former parent company Alcoa in 1983. 

In 2009, Alcas changed its name to Cutco Corporation, with Vector as its domestic sales subsidiary.

In 2019, Vector Marketing reported $273.8 million in sales.

==Business model==
Vector Marketing is a direct selling company that has built its sales force through advertising via newspapers, word-of-mouth, posted advertisements, letters and various media on the internet. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; claims that Vector meets the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) definition of a multi-level marketing company because they sell their product through person-to-person sales, but Vector argues that they employ single-level marketing and don&#x27;t meet the FTC definition of &quot;businesses that involve selling products to family and friends and recruiting other people to do the same&quot; because higher-level employees don&#x27;t profit from the revenue of people they recruit. The company has paid millions of dollars in lawsuits alleging deceptive recruiting practices. Cutco does sell products, but they derive a large portion of their sales from new employees, their families, and friends. 

The company recruits sales representatives from high schools and college campuses in the United States and Canada, sometimes through misrepresentation of affiliation with the school. Sales representatives are employed as independent contractors to sell Cutco products (mainly kitchen knives) to customers, typically their friends and family members, via one-on-one demonstrations.

Some of Vector&#x27;s former independent contractors have accused Vector Marketing of deceptive business practices. The firm frequently advertises in newspapers and on fliers posted on bulletin boards at college campuses, but the advertisements are often vague without explaining the nature of the job. &quot;The LA Times&quot; advised caution to potential employees, who are often young and never had a job before. The company&#x27;s recruitment practices often obfuscate the actual work they do, merely offering a good paying job without noting that the pay structure is based on selling knives by commission.

Vector Marketing&#x27;s compensation policies have also been criticized. Vector Marketing previously required sales representatives to make a refundable security deposit to procure a set of knives for demonstrations. However, the practices have changed and representatives are no longer required to make a security deposit. Sales representatives are loaned knives as well as given some as prizes for their &quot;Fast Start&quot; sales achievements. Those who work for Vector Marketing are independent contractors and are not reimbursed for the time they spend at training sessions.

==Lawsuits==

In 1990, Vector was sued by the Arizona Attorney General. Arizona and Vector agreed to a settlement that punctuated a series of state actions against Vector&#x27;s Tucson manager that spanned seven years. Vector agreed not to misrepresent its compensation system as part of the settlement.

In 1994, Wisconsin ordered Vector to stop deceptive recruiting practices, leading the company to temporarily stop recruiting in the state.

In 2003, a recruit who was successful in a lawsuit against Vector for failing to adhere to labor laws in New York, co-founded a group, Students Against Vector Exploitation (SAVE).

In 2008, Alicia Harris filed a federal class action lawsuit against Vector. Harris alleged that Vector violated California and federal labor law by failing to pay adequate wages and illegally coercing employees into patronizing the company. In 2011, Vector settled the lawsuit, &quot;Harris v. Vector Marketing Corporation&quot;, for $13 million.

In 2014, a lawsuit alleged that a girl was violently sexually assaulted by one of her customers while working for Vector and sued the company for not providing her with adequate training to prevent the situation.

In 2016, the company paid a $6.75 million preliminary settlement for violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act in California, Florida, New York, Illinois and Michigan when workers sued for going unpaid for their trainings.

In September 2017, Vector was sued in a class-action lawsuit initiated by a division manager who alleged that the company was engaging in unfair labor practices because, despite his position, he was still classified as an independent contractor, thus denying him access to overtime pay. According to the suit, division managers are the highest-ranking class of workers who are not officially classified as Vector employees.

<doc id="928418" wikidata="Q967739" url="?curid=928418" title="Culture of the Republic of the Congo">
<text>The culture of the [[Republic of the Congo]] is rich, diverse and made up of a mix of about 4.5 million people in 2015 and many languages and customs. 

Half of Congolese people follow traditional beliefs, and there are 15 principle Bantu groups and more than 70 subgroups. The other half are 35% Roman Catholic, 15% other Christian and 2% Muslim. The region was dominated by Bantu-speaking tribes, who built trade links leading into the Congo River basin. Congo-Brazzaville was formerly part of the French colony of Equatorial Africa.

==Language and writings==

The official language of the Republic of Congo is French. French is spoken by 56% of the Congolese population (78% of the population over 10 years), the second highest percentage of Africa in 2010, behind that of Gabon2. About 88% of Brazzavillans over 15 years of age say they have an easy expression in French.
The Republic of Congo has a number of well-known writers in Africa and the French-speaking world: Alain Mabanckou, Jean-Baptiste Tati Loutard, Jeannette Balou Tchichelle, Henri Lopes, Lassy Mbouity and Tchicaya U Tam&#x27;si.

Several artistic genres such as Congolese cinema struggle to make their breakthrough. After a promising start in the 1970s, the turbulent political environment and the closing of cinemas made production difficult. The country produces no feature films a year and filmmakers broadcast their production directly in video. In the end, in Congo-Brazzaville, culture remained until then the poor relation of the investments of successive governments.

==Geography==

Congo is located in the central-western part of sub-Saharan Africa, along the Equator. To the south and east of it is the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is bounded by Gabon to the west, Cameroon and the Central African Republic to the north, and Cabinda (Angola) to the southwest. It has a coast on the Atlantic Ocean.

==Education==

In the Republic of Congo, public spending on education was lower in 2002-05 than in 1991 public education is theoretically free and mandatory for children under 16, but in practice, parents must face a series of expenses. The net first degree enrollment rate was 44% in 2005, much less than 79% in 1991. The country has universities. Education between the ages of six and sixteen is mandatory. Students who complete six years of primary school and seven years of high school obtain a bachelor&#x27;s degree. At the university, students can obtain a degree in three years.

==Health Status==

Medical facilities are severely limited, medical materials are in short supply. Supply of prescription or over-the-counter drugs in local stores or pharmacies is also generally not available. Payment for any medical services is expected in cash in the Congo, in advance of treatment.

==Food==
Congolese cuisine is a blend of French, Asian and Arabic influences into more starchy, traditional African fare.

The Congolese diet features a diverse array of fruits. Among the most favored is the nsafu which is indigenous to Africa and derived from the Dacryodes edulis tree. This fruit can be consumed in various forms, including raw, boiled, roasted, or dried. Additionally, palm fruit plays a significant role in the production of palm oil and palm wine, and it is also prepared by boiling. Other fruits commonly found in the diet include mvuuta, lemons, plums (mungyengye), pineapple, cola nut, and banana (dinkondo). Notably, bananas exhibit a range of colors and sizes, with some varieties being wild and others having been introduced to the region. The Congolese cuisine also incorporates a variety of nuts, beans, peas, pumpkin, cabbage, potatoes, mushrooms, and spices, all of which come in different sizes and colors and can be prepared in numerous ways. Termites are another unique component of the diet; they are collected both in flight and from the ground, with their nests gathered in baskets. Termites are typically enjoyed alongside boiled manioc and beans, and the earth and clay from their nests are particularly sought after by children and pregnant women. Furthermore, the diet includes domestic animals, fish, and birds. Spices, particularly pepper, hold significant importance in Congolese cooking. One of the most popular varieties is nungu or ndungu, but there are several types, including Capsicum frutescens, known as pili-pili. The national dish, known as saka saka, features ground cassava leaves combined with smoked fish, peanut butter, and palm oil, typically served alongside fufu or plantains. Another traditional dish, yuuma, is made from roasted peanuts that are ground into a paste and served with boiled bananas, cassava (manioc starch), and palm oil, seasoned with salt, pepper, and optional meat. In regions where cassava is scarce, beans may substitute for cassava, accompanied by potato leaves in the stew. Moboke is another well-regarded dish, consisting of a fish stew enriched with green vegetables, often paired with fufu made from cassava or plantains. Moambe, a beloved roasted chicken dish, is prepared in a rich sauce derived from palm nuts. Additionally, moukalou, a fish broth complemented by coconut juice and peanut butter, is enjoyed by many. Other popular dishes include madesu and fumbwa. The preferred beverages in the region are beer and various fruit juices, particularly pineapple and mango.

<doc id="928427" wikidata="Q510601" url="?curid=928427" title="George C. Pimentel">
<text>George Claude Pimentel (May 2, 1922 – June 18, 1989) was a preeminent chemist and researcher, the inventor of the chemical laser, who was also dedicated to science education and public service. He developed the technique of matrix isolation in low-temperature chemistry. He also developed time-resolved infrared spectroscopy to study radicals and other transient species. In the late 1960s, Pimentel led the University of California team that designed the infrared spectrometer for the Mars Mariner 6 and 7 missions that analyzed the surface and atmosphere of Mars.

He was a passionate and popular teacher of first-year chemistry for his entire career. 
In science education, he was best known for the CHEM STUDY project, a national effort to improve high-school chemistry teaching. He participated in the production of films and other supplementary materials and in the training of teachers nationwide. Later, in 1985, he organized and edited the National Academy of Sciences&#x27; &quot;Pimentel Report,&quot; formally known as Opportunities in Chemistry, which highlighted the most important challenges in chemistry at that time. It was a resource for general public including lawmakers. A revised version, Opportunities in Chemistry Today and Tomorrow, was used worldwide for high school and college students. 

An alumnus of University of California, Los Angeles (B.S. 1943) and University of California, Berkeley (Ph.D. 1949), Pimentel began teaching at Berkeley in 1949, where he remained until his death in 1989 from intestinal cancer, with a three year appointment as Deputy Director at the National Science Foundation under the Carter administration in Washington, D.C..

==Honors and awards==
The ACS Award in Chemical Education was renamed the George C. Pimentel Award in Chemical Education in his honor in 1989.

*Earle K. Plyler Prize for Molecular Spectroscopy (1979)
*Wolf Prize in Chemistry (1982)
*Peter Debye Award (1983)
*National Medal of Science (1985)
*Franklin Medal (1985)
*Welch Award (1986)
*American Institute of Chemists Gold Medal (1988)
*Priestley Medal (1989)
*George C. Pimentel Award in Chemical Education (1990)

In 1966, Pimentel was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and in 1968 to the American Academy of Arts and Science. In 1985, 1987 and 1989 he was elected an honorary member to the American Philosophical Society, the Royal Chemical Society (Great Britain), and the Royal Institute of Great Britain. In 1987, he served as the President of the American Chemical Society.

== Chemical laser ==
In 1961, John C. Polanyi was the first to point out the possibility of chemical pumping based on vibrational excitation. He proposed four possible reactions, one of which was the reaction of H + Cl2. Using an infrared spectrometer, Jerome Kasper and Pimentel discovered infrared pulses produced by photodissociation of iodine, the first chemical laser. In September 1964, they announced their discovery at the first conference on chemical lasers, by that time more than 100 possible chemical reactions and 60 photodissociation reactions were proposed capable of producing laser radiation. However, at the symposium in San Diego only one working laser was reported, which was laced with photodissociation of iodine. In 1965, Kasper and Pimentel discovered the laser radiation HCl, arising from the explosion of the system H2 / Cl2. After the discovery of the laser based on the reaction of F + H2 in 1967, the number of chemical lasers found by the Pimentel laboratory rapidly increased. Thus, Pimentel first transformed the chemical energy obtained as a result of vibrational excitation into laser radiation.

<text>The Lavochkin La-15 (Plant 21 product code Izdeliye 52, USAF reporting name Type 21, NATO reporting name Fantail), was an early Soviet jet fighter and a contemporary of the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 which was in service with the Soviet Air Force from 1949 till 1953.

==Design and development==

Lavochkin had produced a line of prop powered fighters in World War II. The Lavochkin La-150 was its first response to a 1945 order to build a single-seat jet fighter using a single German Junkers Jumo 004 turbojet from the Me 262. The Lavochkin La-152 which flew in December 1946 moved the engine to the front of the nose, which reduced thrust loss. The Lavochkin La-160 was the first Soviet fighter to apply swept wings, and flew in June 1947.

The Lavochkin La-168 first flew on April 22, 1948. It was designed to use the new turbojet based on the Rolls-Royce Nene in response to a 1946 request for an advanced swept-wing jet fighter capable of transonic performance. The engine was placed behind the pilot, but with a high-mounted wing and T-tail compared to the similar MiG-15.

The La-15 which reached mass production was the outcome of a series of development aircraft that began with the Aircraft 150 bomber in 1945 and culminated in Aircraft 176, later in 1948. These aircraft were designed for British engines, Rolls-Royce Derwent V and Rolls-Royce Nene, acquired by the Soviets in 1947 and then copied as the Klimov RD-500 and Klimov RD-45 respectively. The Derwent-powered Aircraft 174 was designed as a backup for the main program, the Nene-powered Aircraft 168, in case the British failed to deliver more powerful Nene engines with afterburners (which they did fail to deliver). The first prototype of Aircraft 174 was flown just 9 days after its counterpart the Mikoyan-Gurevich I-310, on January 8, 1948. The first prototype was however lost on May 11, 1948 due to vibrations. Trials were continued with an improved second prototype, designated Aircraft 174D, which underwent State Acceptance Tests from August to September 25, 1948. In comparison with the Nene-powered MiG-15 it had almost the same maximum speed and better maneuverability, with somewhat reduced rate of climb. The type was ordered into production in September 1948, even while Aircraft 174D was undergoing flight trials, and given the official designation La-15 in April 1949.

The La-15 had a barrel-like fuselage, shoulder-mounted swept wings with 6 degrees anhedral, and stabilizers mounted high on the fin, almost a T-tail. It was popular with pilots because of its easy handling and reliability, and its pressurized cockpit was an advantage at high altitude. Nevertheless, official enthusiasm for the La-15 was mild, largely because it was a complex design that required complicated and expensive production tooling. Only 235 La-15s were built, serving with the Soviet Air Force until 1953.

==Operational history==
The La-15 was tested operationally by the 192nd Fighter Wing, based at Kubinka from 19 March 1949, and began appearing in front-line combat units later the same year. One unit was seemingly the 196th Fighter Aviation Regiment. Introduction was accompanied by numerous accidents, but the competing MiG-15 design fared little better. However, although the La-15 had a number of technical advantages over the MiG-15, a combination of easier manufacture and lower costs led to the MiG-15 being favoured. The Soviet authorities decided to produce only one fighter, and they chose the MiG-15bis. The remaining La-15s in service were disarmed by 1953, and their engines reused on the KS-1 Komet air-to-surface missile. The aircraft were expended as targets at various nuclear bomb tests.

==Variants==
;Aircraft 174
:Rolls-Royce Derwent powered first prototype of La-15. Crashed due to structural vibrations caused by sympathetic resonant frequencies of tailplane and rear fuselage.
;Aircraft 174D
:(Dooblyor-second)- Second prototype with modifications shown to be required from Aircraft 174&#x27;s flight tests.
;Aircraft 180
:A two-seat trainer version was also developed as Aircraft 180 and was to be put into production as the UTI La-15 or La-15UTI, but as official interest in the La-15 waned, the trainer was cancelled before mass production began and only two were made.

<text>Frederick&#x27;s of Hollywood is an American lingerie brand formerly with stores in shopping malls across the United States. In 2015, all 111 retail stores were closed before a bankruptcy filing. The brand was acquired by Authentic Brands Group and was relaunched as an online-only store, FOH Online Corp. In 2018, Naked Brand Group, Inc. acquired FOH Online Corp.

==History and operations==
The business began in 1946 in a Fifth Avenue loft in New York City, moved to the West Coast in 1947, and by 1996 had 200 stores across the country.

The business was started by Frederick Mellinger (&quot;inventor of the &quot;Rising Star&quot; push-up bra, the &quot;edible panty&quot;, and myriad garments whose chief attributes were that one could see through them and remove them quickly&quot;). Frederick&#x27;s sold bras, panties, corsets, bedroom slippers, a vast array of hosiery, bridal lingerie, special occasion lingerie, and more. The original flagship store, in the S. H. Kress and Co. Building on Hollywood Boulevard, was a landmark in Hollywood, California.

The store previously housed &quot;The Lingerie Museum&quot; featuring The Celebrity Lingerie Hall of Fame (that replaced its Bra Museum), which exhibited a collection of underwear worn by Hollywood movie stars, such as one of Madonna&#x27;s black pointy-breasted bustiers, the black lace bra and panties that Zsa Zsa Gabor wore in the 1953 film, &quot;Lili&quot;, a petticoat that Ava Gardner wore in &quot;Show Boat&quot;, a white peignoir that Mae West wore for Life magazine in 1952, the Milton Berle in-drag costume, and those worn by Cher, Judy Garland, Cybill Shepherd, Belinda Carlisle, Phyllis Diller, Lana Turner, Shirley MacLaine, Tony Curtis, Mary Wilson, Mamie van Doren, the Pointer Sisters, Ethel Merman, Amanda Blake, and Isabel Sanford.

Frederick&#x27;s of Hollywood was the market leader in lingerie until the 1980s when it was overtaken by Victoria&#x27;s Secret.

In 1992, Frederick&#x27;s lingerie museum drew national media attention when looted during the Los Angeles riots. Madonna’s black bustier, which was worn in her music video for &quot;Open Your Heart&quot;, was stolen and has never been returned despite a $1,000 reward from Frederick’s. Madonna gave the museum a replacement in exchange for a $10,000 donation to an organization that supplied free mammograms to people experiencing poverty. Other lingeries stolen in the store were &quot;a petticoat Ava Gardner wore in &quot;Show Boat&quot; and a push-up bra worn by actress Katey Sagal in &quot;Married... with Children&quot;. One repentant looter delivered a bag of Gardner&#x27;s and Sagal&#x27;s lingeries to the pastor at nearby Blessed Sacrament Catholic Church, Hollywood. An Austin newspaper noted that Blessed Sacrament&#x27;s pastor &quot;may be the only priest in America to ever comfort a man who felt guilty about stealing celebrity bloomers.&quot; In an article titled &quot;Support Is Generous for Bra Museum&quot;, the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; noted that such an &quot;uplifting story could only happen in Hollywood.&quot;

In 2001, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. 

In 2003, it emerged from bankruptcy and was headquartered in Los Angeles. 

In 2006, it merged with New York City sleepwear manufacturer Movie Star, and the headquarters was moved to New York. 

In September 2005, after 59 years, the store moved to the corner of Hollywood Boulevard and Highland Avenue.

In 2008, the company changed its name to Frederick&#x27;s of Hollywood Group Inc. The company was traded on the American Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol FOHL. 

In May 2014, the company was taken private by Harbinger Group and other investors. Its headquarters remain in New York City.

In 2015, the company closed its stores and again filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. Its brand and online operations were acquired by Authentic Brands Group. The company announced it would be online only, with possible plans to create products for sale in department stores and other retail outlets.

In 2018, the company&#x27;s online operations were acquired by the Naked Brand Group Inc.

Some of the lingerie worn by the 1950s pin-up Bettie Page was from Frederick&#x27;s of Hollywood.

<doc id="928444" wikidata="Q3136312" url="?curid=928444" title="Merton Hanks">
<text>Merton Edward Hanks (born March 12, 1968) is an American former professional football player who was a safety for nine seasons in the National Football League (NFL) during the 1990s, primarily with the San Francisco 49ers. He was a five-time All-Pro and four-time Pro Bowl selection with the 49ers, winning a Super Bowl (XXIX) with the team.

Hanks played college football for the Iowa Hawkeyes, earning All-American honors in 1990. He played eight seasons in the NFL with the 49ers and one with the Seattle Seahawks. He is currently a senior associate commissioner for the Pac-12.

== College career ==
Hanks attended Lake Highlands High School, where he was a district track-and-field champion. He attended the University of Iowa, earning all-Big Ten honors at cornerback. However, at the NFL scouting combine, his 40-yard dash times were very slow, and he was not drafted until the fifth round by the San Francisco 49ers.

== Professional career ==
Despite his low selection, Hanks was selected to four Pro Bowl and three All-Pro teams. He was well known for his interceptions and returns, as well as his unique &quot;chicken dance&quot; celebrations that were later emulated by basketball star Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. He was a member of the 1994 San Francisco team that won Super Bowl XXIX. Hanks finished his career with the Seattle Seahawks, retiring in 1999.

== Executive career ==
Hanks was previously the assistant director of operations for the National Football League, and then the league&#x27;s vice president of operations in charge of player conduct. Hanks began his tenure as Conference USA senior associate commissioner in July 2016, a position in which he was responsible for the conference&#x27;s football and baseball operations, including officiating, scheduling, game operations, player conduct and safety. On September 8, 2020, Hanks became the senior associate commissioner, football operations for the Pac-12 conference.

Hanks regularly embarks on speaking tours.

<text>A poncho (; ; ; &quot;blanket&quot;, &quot;woolen fabric&quot;) is a kind of plainly formed, loose outer garment originating in the Americas, traditionally and still usually made of fabric, and designed to keep the body warm. Ponchos have been used by the Native American peoples of the Andes, Patagonia, and the Valley of Mexico since pre-Hispanic times, in places now under the territory of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela, and have also become familiar in parts of the U.S. A rain poncho is made from a watertight material designed to keep the body dry from the rain.

== Types ==
In its simplest form, the poncho is essentially a single large sheet of fabric with an opening in the center for the head. It often has an extra piece of fabric serving as a hood. Rainproof ponchos are normally fitted with fasteners to close the sides once the poncho is draped over the body, with openings provided for the arms. Many ponchos have hoods attached to ward off wind and rain.

Alternative ponchos are now designed as fashion items. They are the same shape but of different material. They are designed to look fashionable and provide warmth and to remain breathable and comfortable, rather than to ward off wind and rain. They are often made out of woolen yarn, knitted or crocheted. Ponchos with festive designs or colors can be worn at special events as well.

=== Traditional ponchos ===
The poncho was one of the typical clothes of many South American and Mexican cultures. Although investigations have concluded that its origins could be Mexico, Ecuador or Peru, it is not known where the first ponchos were made. The poncho is now commonly associated with the Americas. As traditional clothing, the local names and variants are:

* Ruana, in cold regions of Colombia and Venezuela.
* Poncho, most Spanish-speaking countries and worldwide.
* Pala or Poncho, in Brazil (mainly in the South).
* Chamanto, only in Central Chile, poncho in the north and south.
* Jorongo, usually larger or full-length, and often used for special occasions or horse-back riding in Mexico 
* Gabán, typical in Michoacán, Mexico.
* Quechquémitl in many Mexican regions
* Poncho chilote, a heavy woolen poncho of Chiloé Archipelago.
* In Argentina, every province has a traditional design of poncho (material, color and design), being the most famous the &quot;Poncho salteño&quot; of the Salta province which is even included as a part of the province&#x27;s flag.

=== Military ponchos ===
The poncho was first used on a regular basis in the 1850s for irregular U.S. military forces operating on the U.S. Western Plains. These early military ponchos were made of &quot;gutta percha&quot; muslin, a latex-coated, waterproof cloth. Ponchos made of gutta-percha or &quot;India rubber&quot; coated cloth were officially adopted during the American Civil War, both as rain clothing and as a ground sheet for sleeping. While originally intended for cavalry forces, they were widely used by infantry as well; Major General Sherman&#x27;s Union troops, lightly equipped and living off procurement demand from the local populace, wore ponchos during wet weather encountered during the march through Confederate Georgia to the sea.

Discontinued after the Civil War, the U.S. Army again issued ponchos of waterproof rubberized canvas to its forces during the Spanish–American War of 1898. Two years later, both the Army and the Marines were forced to issue waterproof rubberized cloth ponchos with high neck collars during the Philippine–American War in 1900. With the entry of the United States into World War I, both doughboys and Marines in France wore the poncho; it was preferred over the raincoat for its ability to keep both the wearer and his pack dry, as well as serving as a roof for a makeshift shelter.

Just prior to World War II, ponchos were significantly improved during testing with the U.S. Army Jungle Experimental Platoon in the jungles of Panama, incorporating new, lighter materials and a drawcord hood that could be closed off to form a rain fly or ground sheet. Ponchos were widely used by United States armed forces during World War II; even lightly equipped foot-mounted forces such as Merrill&#x27;s Marauders, forced to discard tentage and all other unnecessary equipment, retained their blanket and poncho. During the 1950s, new lightweight coated nylon and other synthetic materials were developed for military ponchos. The poncho has remained in service ever since as a standard piece of U.S. military field equipment. Today, the United States armed forces issue ponchos that may be used as a field expedient shelter. These garments are also used by hunters, campers, and rescue workers.

During World War II, the German Army (Wehrmacht) issued the &quot;Zeltbahn&quot; (see Shelter half), a poncho that could be combined to form tents. A typical four-man tent used four &quot;Zeltbahnen&quot;.

Hikers and soldiers may use military ponchos for improvised tents, sleeping mats, and other purposes besides clothing. Soldiers tend to use ponchos as a substitute for a tent because it is portable and easy to install. Poncho Hooch, Poncho Lean-to, Poncho Litter, and &quot;Australian&quot; Poncho Raft are examples of possible poncho configuration.

== Ponchos in Chile ==
In the late 18th century, Basque navigator José de Moraleda wrote that the ponchos of the Huilliche of Osorno were less colorful than those of Chiloé Archipelago. The Huilliche are the principal indigenous population of Chile from Toltén River to Chiloé Archipelago. Mapuche ponchos were once highly valued, in the 19th century a poncho could be traded for several horses or up to seventy kilos of yerba mate. 19th-century Mapuche ponchos were clearly superior to non-indigenous Chilean textiles and of good quality when compared to contemporary European wool textiles.

== Film ==
* Clint Eastwood famously wore a poncho as the lead character in each of the films he starred in for Sergio Leone (&quot;A Fistful of Dollars&quot;, &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; and &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;). This gave him a distinct look in comparison to other cowboy characters in Western films, who usually wore dusters. It also inspired one worn by the Cybertronian bounty-hunter Lockdown on &quot;&quot;, one worn by the Spirit of the West on &quot;Rango&quot;, and one by Wildwheel on &quot;&quot;.

* Sylvester Stallone improvised an ad-hoc poncho from discarded industrial grade canvas as John Rambo on the set of the 1982 movie &quot;First Blood&quot;. Behind the scenes when filming, Stallone found the leftover canvas underneath an abandoned truck and used his signature survival knife to make a hole in the top fold and turned it into the poncho worn by the Rambo character and describes it having saved him from the freezing cold bitter rain of Northern Canada.

== See also ==
* Aguayo, a typical Andean piece of cloth.
* Baja Jacket
* Bisht
* Belted plaid, a garment that could also double as a blanket or groundsheet.
* Cape
* Chasuble, a poncho-like Christian liturgical vestment.
* Cloak
* Kaftan
* Ruana
* Rebozo, a longer scarf like shawl without hole, tied around shoulder and can be used to carry a baby.
* Sarape, a poncho-like garment traditional to the Mexican state of Coahuila.

<text>The Tour Down Under (currently branded as the [[Santos Limited|Santos]] Tour Down Under for sponsorship reasons) is a cycling race in and around Adelaide, South Australia. It is traditionally the opening event of the UCI World Tour and UCI Women’s WorldTour.

The event was established in 1999 with the support of then Premier of South Australia John Olsen as part of an effort to strengthen the state’s sporting calendar after the Australian Grand Prix moved from Adelaide to Melbourne, Victoria. Since that time it has been owned and managed by the South Australian Government through Events South Australia, the events division of the South Australian Tourism Commission. It experienced rapid growth in its first two decades, becoming the first race granted UCI ProTour status (now UCI WorldTour) in 2008 and the first event of the UCI World Ranking calendar in 2009.

The Tour Down Under takes place each January and features stages suited to sprinters, climbers and all-rounders. Like other UCI WorldTour races, the men’s race attracts all the top UCI teams, as well as a national representative team made up of riders without full-time professional contracts. 

Women&#x27;s races have been held alongside the event since 2011, with the Women&#x27;s Tour Down Under founded in 2016. This race joined the UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour in 2023 – the highest level of international road cycling competition.

Men’s and women’s teams traditionally consist of six riders. The rider with the lowest cumulative time after each stage is honoured with the ochre jersey. Similarly, leaders in the sprint, mountains and youth classifications wear jerseys to signify their positions in those standings. 

==History==
In 1993, it was announced that the Formula One Australian Grand Prix would move from Adelaide, South Australia to Melbourne, Victoria from the 1996 season. Following the loss of this major sporting event, the Government of South Australia worked to organise other major sporting events to replace the Grand Prix, including the Adelaide 500 and the Tour Down Under.

In 1999, the Tour Down Under was established as the Jacobs Creek Tour Down Under. The original event concept was developed by a team led by 1984 Olympics 4000m team pursuit gold medallist Michael Turtur in conjunction with the Government of South Australia.

The first Tour Down Under was a UCI 2.4-class race and featured teams from Australia and around the world, among them GC-Casino, BigMat-Auber93, Crédit Agricole, Lampre–Daikin, Palmans–Ideal, Deutsche Bank Telekom, Team home-Jack&amp;Jones, Saeco, the Australian Institute of Sport, Mapei, plus teams assembled under the banner of &#x27;Team Australia&#x27; and &#x27;World Team&#x27;. The race was won by Stuart O&#x27;Grady who in 2020 succeeded Turtur as Race Director. Current-day professional team Decathlon–AG2R La Mondiale has competed in every Tour Down Under.

In 2005, the Tour Down Under secured the highest UCI ranking outside Europe. In 2007, South Australian Premier Mike Rann and former tourism minister Jane Lomax Smith launched a campaign for the Tour Down Under to become the first race outside of Europe to secure ProTour status from the UCI, thereby guaranteeing the attendance of all the world&#x27;s top teams.

That campaign successfully led to the Tour Down Under being awarded ProTour status the following year, and joining the UCI World Ranking calendar in 2009.

In September 2008, Rann announced that Lance Armstrong would make his professional cycling comeback at the 2009 race. Armstrong&#x27;s participation saw visitor numbers double, with the event’s economic impact more than doubling (from $17.3 million in 2008 to $39 million in 2009) and media coverage increased five-fold. In 2009 Santos bought the naming rights and in 2010 the Tour Down Under was named Australia&#x27;s Best Major Event for the second year in a row in the Qantas Tourism Awards. Armstrong participated in three successive Tour Down Under events, retiring after 2011. 

The 2011 Tour Down Under had an economic impact of $43 million and crowds of more than 782,000. In 2013, it attracted more than 760,400 people to Adelaide and regional South Australia across eight days, including 40,000 interstate and international visitors who travelled there for the event.

Since then the race has continued to build, with milestones including becoming the first non-European event to achieve UCI ProTour status, being named as Australia&#x27;s Best Sporting Event in 2016 and receiving a bronze medal at the Australian Tourism Awards. Its 2020 edition attracted 779,362 spectators, created 742 full-time equivalent jobs and generated an economic benefit of $66.4 million. 

In November 2020, organisers confirmed the 2021 edition of the race would be cancelled due to logistical and quarantine complications arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. An all-Australian event known as the Santos Festival of Cycling was held 19–24 January 2021, featuring six days of competitions across road, track, paracycling, BMX, mountain bike and cyclocross, and a four-stage race on the National Road Series. The men&#x27;s National Road Series event was won by Luke Durbridge, while the women&#x27;s event was won by Sarah Gigante.

In September 2021 organisers confirmed that the Tour Down Under would be cancelled for the second consecutive year due to continued travel and quarantine restrictions affecting the ability for international teams to participate. The second annual Santos Festival of Cycling was held 21–29 January 2022.

In 2023 the Tour Down Under resumed as an international event. Grace Brown (FDJ-SUEZ) and Jay Vine (UAE Team Emirates) won the women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s races respectively.   

===List of overall winners===










Simon Gerrans has won the Tour four times (2006, 2012, 2014, and 2016). Stuart O&#x27;Grady (1999 and 2001), André Greipel (2008 and 2010), Daryl Impey (2018 and 2019) and Richie Porte (2017 and 2020) have won the Tour Down Under twice; Impey is the only rider to successfully defend his title.

The Santos Tour Down Under was not held in 2021 and 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but in its place was the locally focused Santos Festival Of Cycling.

==Women&#x27;s racing and the Women&#x27;s Tour Down Under==

From 2011, women&#x27;s races were held alongside the Tour Down Under, initially as a series of criterium races. In 2016, the Women&#x27;s Tour Down Under was founded, and was won by Mitchelton–Scott rider Katrin Garfoot. The race maintained its initial UCI 2.2 status until 2018, when it secured UCI 2.1 status and became the first cycling event in the world to offer women the same prize money as men.

In 2023 the women’s race was elevated to the UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour, becoming the only stage race at this level in Australia. The event features stages through Adelaide and regions including the Barossa, Adelaide Hills and Fleurieu Peninsula. 

The 2024 Santos Tour Down Under women’s race was held from 12-14 January.  

==Course==
The Santos Tour Down Under generally features stages through and surrounding Adelaide on terrain that ranges from flat to undulating and steep. In 2024 the men’s race featured its most challenging final weekend to date, with ascents of both Willunga Hill and Mount Lofty designed to test the peloton.

The 2024 women’s race also included a mix of terrain across its three stages. On 14 January, riders tackled Willunga Hill, a climb first featured for female athletes during the 2021 Santos Festival of Cycling and now making its debut in the Santos Tour Down Under women’s race.

South Australia in late January is often hot. Daily maximum temperatures approaching or exceeding are not uncommon and often challenge riders, including many who travel direct to South Australia from winter in the northern hemisphere.

===Frequent locations===
South Australian councils host Tour Down Under stage starts and finishes. Main streets and communities such as The Parade in Norwood, King William Road in Unley, and Jetty Road in Glenelg - along with Stirling, Tanunda and McLaren Vale – are frequent locations for hosting race departures and arrivals. Certain vistas have become synonymous with the Santos Tour Down Under, particularly the Barossa’s rolling vineyards, the coastline around Aldinga on the Fleurieu Peninsula and the native bushland found on the slopes of Willunga Hill. 

New start and finish locations in recent years have included Uraidla, Brighton, Port Willunga, Port Elliot and Mount Lofty. 

The race usually spends time in metropolitan Adelaide and nearby regions including the Barossa, Adelaide Hills and Fleurieu Peninsula. In 2024 it visited the Murray River, Lakes and Coorong, with Murray Bridge to host its first men’s stage start.
==Jerseys==
Leaders of competitions within the race wear a distinctive jersey as per cycling tradition. Both the men’s and women’s races acknowledge classification leaders with jerseys.

===Race classification jerseys===
*General classification: The &quot;ochre&quot; jersey is awarded to the rider with the lowest cumulative time at the end of each stage, and to the overall race winner following the final stage. Ochre is associated with the Australian landscape and the Santos Tour Down Under is the only race that uses it on a jersey. The jersey is currently sponsored by Santos. 
*Sprint classification: The sprint jersey is awarded to the rider with the most points. Time bonuses are awarded to the first three riders across the line at points along each stage route and the finish. This jersey’s colour and design usually changes based on its sponsor. The current sprint jersey is blue and sponsored by Ziptrak, an Australian outdoor blind manufacturer.
*Mountain classification: The king/queen of the mountain jersey is awarded to the rider with the most points from those earned by the first five riders over specified climb checkpoints on significant hills. The jersey retains the traditional polka dot design used in cycling races to denote the leader of this classification. The colour of dots on this jersey changes with its sponsor, which at present is Adelaide-based information technology company efex.
*Young rider classification: The young rider’s jersey is traditionally white in colour and is awarded to the leading rider under 23 at the end of each stage. Zwift is the current sponsor of this jersey. 

===Other prizes===
*The most aggressive rider is awarded red number patches after each stage. There is no overall classification. 
*The winning team competition is awarded to the team with the lowest cumulative team by its four best riders on each of the six stages. Wilson Parking sponsors this component of the event. 

==Cycling Festival==

The Santos Festival of Cycling is held together with the Santos Tour Down Under. It features South Australian food and beverage experiences, amateur participation activities for children and adults, street parties and various other community events organised by host councils. The festival program encourages visitors attending the Santos Tour Down Under to explore Adelaide and surrounding regions.

===Tour Village===
The Tour Village is a hub for fans and teams. It is based in Victoria Square/Tarntanyangga – part of the Adelaide central business district – and opposite the Hilton Adelaide, a team accommodation provider.

A Team Zone extends across the southern side of the square and features booths for each men’s and women’s team competing at the Santos Tour Down Under. Fans are invited to walk through the space and watch mechanics at work on athletes’ bikes.

The Bike Expo is based on the northern side of the square and houses bike retail displays, food vendors, bars and a large stage used for the team presentation and opening night concert, which are free to attend.  

=== Challenge Tour and participation activities ===
Since 2003 the Tour Down Under has included a companion event – the Challenge Tour – held on the morning of a race stage ahead of professionals competing. The inaugural Challenge Tour event in 2003 was known as the Break-Away Tour and attracted more than 600 riders. In 2004 this grew to 1,400 participants, with the event known as the Be Active Tour. Its name went on to change in line with various partnership agreements; when held in 2023 the event was simply named the Challenge Tour.  

It has only been cancelled once – in 2018 – when temperatures over 40 degrees forced organisers to abandon the ride. The Challenge Tour took place on a Friday from its inception until 2019, when it was held on a Saturday and known as the Challenge Tour presented by The Advertiser. Organizers decided to rest the Challenge Tour in 2024, instead offering a program which would feature more variety to suit a broader range of cycling interests and abilities. 
==Down Under Classic==

Since 2008 a circuit race has traditionally been held before the official start of the Santos Tour Down Under. This event, known as the Down Under Classic, takes place on roads throughout central Adelaide. It does not count towards overall standings in the Santos Tour Down Under, though riders do compete for prize money. In 2020 and 2023 the race was held as the Schwalbe Classic.  

===Down Under Classic Winners===







==Traditions==

===Ochre jersey===
From 1999 until 2005 the Tour Down Under presented the general classification leader and eventual winner with a yellow jersey, as seen at the Tour de France. In 2006 this yellow jersey was replaced by an ochre-coloured jersey, a colour chosen for its links to the Australian outback landscape. 

===Oppy the Kangaroo===
The race convoy is led by a car bearing the event’s mascot Oppy, who was named for Australian cyclist Hubert Opperman.

<doc id="928452" wikidata="Q743494" url="?curid=928452" title="Gennady Kolbin">
<text>Gennady Vasilyevich Kolbin (; 7 May 1927 – 15 January 1998) was the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR from 16 December 1986 to 22 June 1989.

==Early life==
Kolbin was born in 1927 in Nizhny Tagil. From 1942 to 1943, he served as an apprentice of a model designer at a factory and a shoemaker in Nizhny Tagil. In 1943, he started studying at the Nizhny Tagil Mining and Metallurgical College. From 1947 to 1959, he served as designer-technologist, head of the technological bureau, deputy head, head and deputy chief engineer at the plant in Nizhny Tagil. Kolbin joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1954.

In 1955 he graduated from the Ural Polytechnic Institute named after S. M. Kirov in absentia and later studied in graduate school.

==Political career==
In 1959, he served as secretary of the party committee at the plant. In 1962 , he served as Second Secretary and First Secretary of the Lenin District Committee of the CPSU of Nizhny Tagil. From 1962 to 1970, he served as Second Secretary and First Secretary of the Nizhny Tagil City Committee of the CPSU.

From 1970 to 1975, Kolbin was appointed as Secretary and later as Second Secretary of the Sverdlovsk Regional Committee of the CPSU. Kolbin then served as the Second Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Georgia. He served the Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Georgian SSR from 1975 to 1984. After leaving, in 1976, to Moscow, following promotion as the first secretary of the Sverdlovsk regional committee of the CPSU, Yakov P. Ryabov was considered as the main candidate for the post of first secretary of the Sverdlovsk regional committee of the CPSU. However, at the suggestion of Ryabov, acting secretary of the Sverdlovsk Regional Committee of the CPSU, Boris Yeltsin, was nominated for this post.

Kolbin was appointed as the First Secretary of the Ulyanovsk Regional Committee of the CPSU, from 1983 to 1986. On his initiative, the Microelectronics Center, a branch of Moscow State University, was opened in Ulyanovsk, and a decision was made to build the President Bridge across the Volga River. He served as the Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR from 1971 to 1975.

Kolbin served as the Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union from 1979 to 1989. He also served as the Member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet from 1987 to 1989.

===First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan===
In 1986, Kolbin was appointed as the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan. He replaced Dinmukhamed Kunaev, who previously served as the First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, from 1964. Kolbin had not worked in the Kazakh SSR prior to his appointment. He was appointed by Mikhail Gorbachev in an attempt to root out corruption in the Communist Party of the Kazakh SSR. Kolbin served as the Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR from 1987 to 1989 and member of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Kazakh SSR from 1987 to 1989.

As an outsider to Kazakhstan, he was not well received there. His appointment resulted in violent protests in the Kazakh capital Almaty and other cities, with several thousand protesters killed and hundreds injured. This revolt is now known as &quot;Jeltoqsan&quot;, Kazakh for &quot;December&quot;. It is reported that the outgoing first secretary, Dinmukhamed Kunaev, participated in organizing the protests, which involved 60,000 protesters. The report of Kunaev participation is likely fabricated, given that Kunaev was under home arrest at the time, isolated and was not allowed to communicate with anyone.

In June 1989, Kolbin was replaced by Kazakh Nursultan Nazarbayev. Kolbin was then transferred to a position in Moscow.

===Further political positions===
Following his transfer to Moscow, Kolbin served as the Chairman of the People&#x27;s Control Commission from 1989 to 1990. He served as the People&#x27;s Deputy of the USSR from 1989 to 1991. He retired from all political positions in December 1990.

==Later life==
From December 1990 onwards, Kolbin was a personal pensioner of federal significance. From 1992 to 1998, he served as the chairman of the Board of Directors of OJSC Mosuralbank.

On 15 January 1998, while travelling onboard the Moscow Metro to visit his daughter, Kolbin suddenly felt unwell and collapsed in the metro, and died of a heart attack. He was buried at the Troyekurovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.

==Personal life==
Kolbin was married to Sofya Ivanovna Kolbina (1926–1998). They had two daughters; Marina (born 1950) and Natalia (1952–1984).

<doc id="928458" wikidata="Q76778" url="?curid=928458" title="Nicolas Kiefer">
<text>Nicolas Kiefer (; born 5 July 1977) is a German former professional tennis player. He reached the semifinals of the 2006 Australian Open and won a silver medal in men&#x27;s doubles with partner Rainer Schüttler at the 2004 Athens Olympics. Kiefer&#x27;s career-high singles ranking was world No. 4, achieved in January 2000.

==Tennis career==
===1995–2005===
Kiefer was taken notice of as an outstanding junior. He won the Junior Australian Open, the US Open, and was a finalist and semifinalist at Wimbledon and the French Open finishing as the No. 2 junior behind Mariano Zabaleta when he was 18 in 1995. On 10 January 2000, he reached his second quarterfinal at the Australian Open and afterwards was ranked world No. 4, his highest position.

Kiefer was known to have some tennis superstitions. He was sometimes seen tapping his racquet on the corners of the court after a point, and, when serving, frequently asked for the ball with which he had just won a point to re-use it for the next one.

===2006–2007===
Kiefer became infamous for an incident on 25 January 2006, during the quarterfinals of the Australian Open. While facing Sébastien Grosjean late in the fifth set of a marathon match, Kiefer threw his racquet midpoint. Grosjean lost the point, hitting the ball into the net. Grosjean protested that the racquet distracted his shot. The umpire Carlos Bernardes said he did not believe the act was intentional and noted Grosjean had already hit the ball before the flying racquet could have had any effect on his shot. Grosjean eventually lost the fifth and final set to Kiefer. Kiefer went through to the semi-finals where he was defeated by the 2004 champion Roger Federer.

Kiefer injured his wrist while playing at the 2006 French Open, and announced his return on 5 July 2007, having fallen to the 404th position on ATP. He announced that he was &quot;tired of waiting and anxious to start traveling again and to see his name on scoreboards&quot;. Kiefer returned at the 2007 Gerry Weber Open, losing in the first round to eventual champion Tomáš Berdych. At Wimbledon, he made the third round after defeating No.30 seed Filippo Volandri and Fabrice Santoro, both in straight sets, before losing in 4 sets (3 of which were tiebreakers) to Novak Djokovic. At Newport, however, he ended up losing in round 1. At Los Angeles, he reached the semifinals in only his 4th tournament since coming back from injury; he had to default against Radek Štěpánek, another player coming back from injury, because of an injury sustained during his quarter-final win. He also made an impressive showing at the 2007 Madrid Masters, where he beat number five seed Fernando González in the quarterfinals before losing in the semifinals to world number one Roger Federer 6–4, 6–4.

===2008===
His 2008 season did not start out well: he lost in the first round of the Australian Open to former world No.1 Juan Carlos Ferrero, first round of 2008 Indian Wells Masters to Dudi Sela, third round of 2008 Miami Masters to world No.2 Rafael Nadal, second round of 2008 Monte Carlo Masters to Philipp Kohlschreiber, first round of 2008 Rome Masters to Ferrero. His first notable result was the quarterfinals of the 2008 Hamburg Masters with victories over world No.10 Stanislas Wawrinka and world No.4 Nikolay Davydenko before losing to Andreas Seppi in three sets. He would lose in the third round of 2008 Wimbledon Championships to Nadal. During the 2008 Canada Masters, at age 31 and ranked No. 37, he made his first Masters final after 73 previous tries, previously finishing as a semifinalist at the 1999 and 2004 Canada Masters (lost to Thomas Johansson and Andy Roddick respectively) and 2007 Madrid Masters (lost to Federer). Along the way, he defeated Mardy Fish, 15th seed Mikhail Youzhny, fourth seed Nikolay Davydenko, seventh seed James Blake, and Gilles Simon; the win over Simon was especially notable because Simon had defeated world No. 1 Roger Federer in the second round. He lost to Nadal in the final in straight sets. Because of his run, he broke back into the top 20 at No. 19.

===2009===
In 2009, he represented Germany in the 2009 Hopman Cup with 19-year-old Sabine Lisicki. In the first match, he lost against Australia&#x27;s Lleyton Hewitt, who had been six months inactive due to an injury. In the second singles match, Kiefer lost again, this time to USA&#x27;s James Blake. Nevertheless, Kiefer won both of the doubles matches with Sabine Lisicki against both Australia and the United States. In the third singles match, Kiefer twisted his ankle against Slovakia&#x27;s Dominik Hrbatý in the first set when Kiefer was up 3–1 and serving. This injury prevented him from participating in the 2009 Australian Open.

He re-appeared in the 2009 Davis Cup match against Austria in which he won in the doubles match with Philipp Kohlschreiber against Julian Knowle and Alexander Peya in four sets. Kiefer also played a singles match, the fourth match, against Jürgen Melzer in which Kiefer won in straight sets and gave Germany the victory against Austria. Kiefer then participated in the 2009 BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells in which he beat Bobby Reynolds in straight sets in the second round, but he then lost in the third round to Andy Roddick.

In the 2009 Sony Ericsson Open in Miami, Kiefer beat &quot;the magician&quot; Fabrice Santoro in the second round. In the third round Kiefer was defeated by world No. 2 Roger Federer.
At the 2009 Monte-Carlo Rolex Masters, Kiefer lost in his first match against qualifier Andreas Beck. At the 2009 Internazionali BNL d&#x27;Italia in Rome, Kiefer lost again in his first match against Juan Mónaco in straight sets. In the 2009 BMW Open Kiefer was down against Ernests Gulbis 2–6, 0–2 but eventually won in three sets. Kiefer said after the match, &quot;Clay and me, we will never be the best of friends&quot;. Kiefer suffered from back problems which eventually made him lose against Jérémy Chardy in the next round.

At the 2009 Mutua Madrileña Madrid Open he lost against Tommy Robredo. Kiefer then played the 2009 ARAG World Team Cup, in which he played the doubles matches with Mischa Zverev. They won all of their matches, and Germany reached the final, but lost against Serbia. Despite Germany losing, Kiefer won the doubles match in the final against Viktor Troicki and doubles world No. 1 Nenad Zimonjić.

Kiefer then participated at the 2009 French Open in which he beat qualifier Ilija Bozoljac in four sets. However, Kiefer lost in the second round against world No. 14 David Ferrer in five sets. Despite this loss, Kiefer claimed that he was proud that he had played up to a fifth set against one of the best tennis players of the world on clay, since clay is Kiefer&#x27;s least favourite surface.
The clay season had now ended, and the grass season started with Kiefer&#x27;s participation in his favourite tournament, the 2009 Gerry Weber Open. In the first match, he thrashed Viktor Troicki, but retired in the second round against Jürgen Melzer when he was down 1–6 with a muscular strain in his abdomen which forced him to retire from singles and doubles, where he had reached the semifinals with Mischa Zverev.

Kiefer participated in the Wimbledon as the 33rd seed but having not fully recovered from his abdomen injury. This was reflected in his match against Fabrice Santoro, where Kiefer lost in straight sets. Kiefer then played for Germany in the 2009 Davis Cup quarterfinals against Spain. He did so in the doubles match with Mischa Zverev against Spain&#x27;s Fernando Verdasco and Feliciano López. Kiefer and Zverev lost the match. In the first round of the U.S. Open, he beat Michaël Llodra in straight sets, but in the second round he lost to world No. 3 Rafael Nadal.

<doc id="928459" wikidata="Q6176150" url="?curid=928459" title="Jeffrey Maier incident">
<text>The Jeffrey Maier incident occurred during Game 1 of the 1996 American League Championship Series between the New York Yankees and the Baltimore Orioles. Twelve-year-old Jeffrey Maier deflected a batted ball, hit by Derek Jeter, into the Yankee Stadium stands for what umpires ruled to be a home run, rather than fan interference. His interference altered the course of Game 1. The resulting home run allowed the Yankees to tie the score. They were victorious in the game and won the series four games to one. &quot;Maier became an immediate celebrity in New York, a pariah in Baltimore and an everlasting character in baseball lore.&quot;

==Incident==

On October 9, 1996, the Yankees trailed the Orioles 4–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning when shortstop Derek Jeter hit a deep fly ball to right field. Right fielder Tony Tarasco moved near the fence and appeared &quot;to draw a bead on the ball&quot; when the then-12-year-old Maier clearly reached over the fence separating the stands and the field of play nine feet below and snatched the ball with his glove. While baseball fans are permitted to catch (and keep) balls hit into the stands, the Major League Baseball rulebook states that spectator interference is to be called if &quot;a spectator reaches out of the stands, or goes on the playing field, and touches a live ball&quot;.

Right field umpire Rich Garcia immediately ruled the play a home run, tying the game at 4–4, despite the protest of Tarasco and Orioles manager Davey Johnson (the latter was ejected in the ensuing argument).

The Yankees won the game in the eleventh inning on Bernie Williams&#x27; walk-off home run. The Orioles maintained their protest of the Maier play after the conclusion of the game, but their protest was denied by American League President Gene Budig because judgment calls cannot be protested. After viewing the replay, Garcia admitted he made a mistake and that there was spectator interference, but maintained Maier reached out, not down, and did not interfere with Tarasco&#x27;s ability to catch the ball and that Tarasco would not have caught it. Tarasco adamantly disagreed, maintaining he would have caught the ball without Maier&#x27;s interference. Had Garcia called spectator interference, he would have then used his own judgment to determine what the most likely outcome of the play would beeither an out or awarding Jeter a given number of bases. 

Garcia accepted Baltimore fans later booing him, but was disturbed when Yankees fans cheered him, as he did not want to appear biased. Two days after the incident Garcia said no one felt worse about it than he did, but that one play after 22 years of hard work as an umpire should not make him hang his head, adding, &quot;I love Baltimore, I love the team and I love this stadium Camden Yards]...&quot;

The Yankees went on to win the series against Baltimore, four games to one, as well as the World Series against the Atlanta Braves. As a result of the play, a railing was added behind the right field wall at Yankee Stadium to prevent fans from reaching over it.

Meanwhile, in New York, Maier became a minor celebrity. The &quot;New York Times&quot; described him as having become &quot;New York royalty&quot;. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; allowed him to sit behind the Yankee dugout during the World Series. The boy appeared on national talk shows. On the other end, a 2012 article in the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; began, &quot;The most despised child in the history of Baltimore sports is all grown up.&quot; Then Yankees&#x27; manager Joe Torre said after the incident, &quot;I think it&#x27;s glorifying the wrong thing.&quot; Maier himself has come to terms more over the years with the impact of the incident as he has grown older, married, and become a father. He has stated, &quot;&#x27;It&#x27;s a huge part of baseball history, either positive or negative depending on your allegiance, but it&#x27;s part of history nonetheless.&#x27;&quot;

<text>[[Multithreaded programming|Multithreaded]], [[Parallel programming model|Parallel]], and Distributed Programming (MPD) is a concurrent programming language whose syntax is derived from the one used in the book &quot;Foundations of Multithreaded, Parallel, and Distributed Programming&quot;. The name lists the distinguishing features of the language, namely that it supports all three of these concurrent programming techniques.

MPD is implemented as a variant of the SR programming language. It has a different parser, but it uses the same intermediate form and run-time system as SR. Consequently, MPD provides the same variety of concurrent programming mechanisms as does SR.

MPD programs can execute on single processors, shared-memory multiprocessors, or clusters of (homogeneous) processors. The implementation transparently supports a variety of different kinds of processors and Unix systems.

resource helloWorld()
 writes(&quot;Hello World\n&quot;)

<text>Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks through simultaneous execution or time-sharing (context switching), sharing resources and managing interactions. Concurrency improves responsiveness, throughput, and scalability in modern computing, including: 

* Operating systems and embedded systems
* Distributed systems, parallel computing, and high-performance computing
* Database systems, web applications, and cloud computing

== Related concepts ==
Concurrency is a broader concept that encompasses several related ideas, including: 

* Parallelism (simultaneous execution on multiple processing units). Parallelism executes tasks independently on multiple CPU cores, while concurrency manages multiple tasks on one or more cores, switching between threads or time-slicing without completing each one. Programs may exhibit parallelism only, concurrency only, both parallelism and concurrency, neither. 
* Multi-threading and multi-processing (shared system resources)
* Synchronization (coordinating access to shared resources)
* Coordination (managing interactions between concurrent tasks)
* Concurrency Control (ensuring data consistency and integrity)
* Inter-process Communication (IPC, facilitating information exchange)

== Issues ==
Because computations in a concurrent system can interact with each other while being executed, the number of possible execution paths in the system can be extremely large, and the resulting outcome can be indeterminate. Concurrent use of shared resources can be a source of indeterminacy leading to issues such as deadlocks, and resource starvation.

Design of concurrent systems often entails finding reliable techniques for coordinating their execution, data exchange, memory allocation, and execution scheduling to minimize response time and maximise throughput.

== Theory ==
Concurrency theory has been an active field of research in theoretical computer science. One of the first proposals was Carl Adam Petri&#x27;s seminal work on Petri nets in the early 1960s. In the years since, a wide variety of formalisms have been developed for modeling and reasoning about concurrency.

=== Models ===
A number of formalisms for modeling and understanding concurrent systems have been developed, including:
* The parallel random-access machine
* The actor model
* Computational bridging models such as the bulk synchronous parallel (BSP) model
* Petri nets
* Process calculi
** Calculus of communicating systems (CCS) 
** Communicating sequential processes (CSP) model
** π-calculus
* Tuple spaces, e.g., Linda
* Simple Concurrent Object-Oriented Programming (SCOOP)
* Reo Coordination Language
* Trace monoids

Some of these models of concurrency are primarily intended to support reasoning and specification, while others can be used through the entire development cycle, including design, implementation, proof, testing and simulation of concurrent systems. Some of these are based on message passing, while others have different mechanisms for concurrency.

The proliferation of different models of concurrency has motivated some researchers to develop ways to unify these different theoretical models. For example, Lee and Sangiovanni-Vincentelli have demonstrated that a so-called &quot;tagged-signal&quot; model can be used to provide a common framework for defining the denotational semantics of a variety of different models of concurrency, while Nielsen, Sassone, and Winskel have demonstrated that category theory can be used to provide a similar unified understanding of different models.

The Concurrency Representation Theorem in the actor model provides a fairly general way to represent concurrent systems that are closed in the sense that they do not receive communications from outside. (Other concurrency systems, e.g., process calculi can be modeled in the actor model using a two-phase commit protocol.) The mathematical denotation denoted by a closed system is constructed increasingly better approximations from an initial behavior called using a behavior approximating function to construct a denotation (meaning ) for as follows:

In this way, can be mathematically characterized in terms of all its possible behaviors.

=== Logics ===
Various types of temporal logic can be used to help reason about concurrent systems. Some of these logics, such as linear temporal logic and computation tree logic, allow assertions to be made about the sequences of states that a concurrent system can pass through. Others, such as action computational tree logic, Hennessy–Milner logic, and Lamport&#x27;s temporal logic of actions, build their assertions from sequences of &quot;actions&quot; (changes in state). The principal application of these logics is in writing specifications for concurrent systems.

== Practice ==

Concurrent programming encompasses programming languages and algorithms used to implement concurrent systems. Concurrent programming is usually considered to be more general than parallel programming because it can involve arbitrary and dynamic patterns of communication and interaction, whereas parallel systems generally have a predefined and well-structured communications pattern. The base goals of concurrent programming include &quot;correctness&quot;, &quot;performance&quot; and &quot;robustness&quot;. Concurrent systems such as Operating systems and Database management systems are generally designed to operate indefinitely, including automatic recovery from failure, and not terminate unexpectedly (see Concurrency control). Some concurrent systems implement a form of transparent concurrency, in which concurrent computational entities may compete for and share a single resource, but the complexities of this competition and sharing are shielded from the programmer.

Because they use shared resources, concurrent systems in general require the inclusion of some kind of arbiter somewhere in their implementation (often in the underlying hardware), to control access to those resources. The use of arbiters introduces the possibility of indeterminacy in concurrent computation which has major implications for practice including correctness and performance. For example, arbitration introduces unbounded nondeterminism which raises issues with model checking because it causes explosion in the state space and can even cause models to have an infinite number of states.

Some concurrent programming models include coprocesses and deterministic concurrency. In these models, threads of control explicitly yield their timeslices, either to the system or to another process.

* petroglyphs, which are carved or scratched into the rock surface,
* sculpted rock reliefs, and
* geoglyphs, which are formed on the ground.
The oldest known rock art dates from the Upper Palaeolithic period, having been found in Europe, Australia, Asia, and Africa. Anthropologists studying these artworks believe that they likely had magico-religious significance.

The archaeological sub-discipline of rock art studies first developed in the late-19th century among Francophone scholars studying the rock art of the Upper Palaeolithic found in the cave systems of parts of Western Europe. Rock art continues to be of importance to indigenous peoples in various parts of the world, who view them as both sacred items and significant components of their cultural heritage. Such archaeological sites may become significant sources of cultural tourism and have been used in popular culture for their aesthetic qualities.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;rock art&quot; appears in the published literature as early as the 1940s. It has also been described as &quot;rock carvings&quot;, &quot;rock drawings&quot;, &quot;rock engravings&quot;, &quot;rock inscriptions&quot;, &quot;rock paintings&quot;, &quot;rock pictures&quot;, &quot;rock records&quot;, and &quot;rock sculptures&quot;.

==Background==
Parietal art is a term for art in caves; this definition usually extended to art in rock shelters under cliff overhangs. Popularly, it is called &quot;cave art&quot;, and is a subset of the wider term, rock art. It is mostly on rock walls, but may be on ceilings and floors. A wide variety of techniques have been used in its creation. The term usually is applied only to prehistoric art, but it may be used for art of any date. Sheltered parietal art has had a far better chance of surviving for very long periods, and what now survives may represent only a very small proportion of what was created.

Both parietal and cave art refer to cave paintings, drawings, etchings, carvings, and pecked artwork on the interior of caves and rock shelters. Generally, these either are engraved (essentially meaning scratched) or painted, or, they are created using a combination of the two techniques. Parietal art is found very widely throughout the world, and in many places new examples are being discovered.

The defining characteristic of rock art is that it is placed on natural rock surfaces; in this way, it is distinct from artworks placed on constructed walls or free-standing sculpture. As such, rock art is a form of landscape art, and includes designs that have been placed on boulder and cliff faces, cave walls, and ceilings, and on the ground surface. Rock art is a global phenomenon, being found in many different regions of the world. There are various forms of rock art. Some archaeologists also consider pits and grooves in the rock known as &quot;cupules&quot;, or &quot;cups&quot; or &quot;rings&quot;, as a form of rock art.

Although there are exceptions, the majority of rock art whose creation was recorded by ethnographers had been produced during rituals. As such, the study of rock art is a component of the archaeology of religion.

Rock art serves multiple purposes in the contemporary world. In several regions, it remains spiritually important to indigenous peoples, who view it as a significant component of their cultural heritage. It also serves as an important source of cultural tourism, and hence as economic revenue in certain parts of the world. As such, images taken from cave art have appeared on memorabilia and other artifacts sold as a part of the tourist industry.

==Types==
===Paintings===
In most climates, only paintings in sheltered sites, in particular caves, have survived for any length of time. Therefore, these are usually called &quot;cave paintings&quot;, although many do survive in &quot;rock-shelters&quot; or cliff-faces under an overhang. In prehistoric times, these were often popular places for various human purposes, providing some shelter from the weather, as well as light. There may have been many more paintings in more exposed sites, that are now lost. Pictographs are paintings or drawings that have been placed onto the rock face. Such artworks have typically been made with mineral earths and other natural compounds found across much of the world. The predominantly used colours are red, black and white. Red paint is usually attained through the use of ground ochre, while black paint is typically composed of charcoal, or sometimes from minerals such as manganese. White paint is usually created from natural chalk, kaolinite clay or diatomaceous earth. Once the pigments had been obtained, they would be ground and mixed with a liquid, such as water, blood, urine, or egg yolk, and then applied to the stone as paint using a brush, fingers, or a stamp. Alternately, the pigment could have been applied on dry, such as with a stick of charcoal. In some societies, the paint itself has symbolic and religious meaning; for instance, among hunter-gatherer groups in California, paint was only allowed to be traded by the group shamans, while in other parts of North America, the word for &quot;paint&quot; was the same as the word for &quot;supernatural spirit&quot;.

One common form of pictograph, found in many, although not all rock-art producing cultures, is the hand print. There are three forms of this; the first involves covering the hand in wet paint and then applying it to the rock. The second involves a design being painted onto the hand, which is then in turn added to the surface. The third involves the hand first being placed against the panel, with dry paint then being blown onto it through a tube, in a process that is akin to air-brush or spray-painting. The resulting image is a negative print of the hand, and is sometimes described as a &quot;stencil&quot; in Australian archaeology. Miniature stencilled art has been found at two locations in Australia and one in Indonesia.

===Petroglyphs===
Petroglyphs are engravings or carvings into rock which is left &quot;in situ&quot;. They can be created with a range of scratching, engraving or carving techniques, often with the use of a hard hammerstone, which is battered against the stone surface. In certain societies, the choice of hammerstone itself has religious significance. In other instances, the rock art is pecked out through indirect percussion, as a second rock is used like a chisel between the hammerstone and the panel. A third, rarer form of engraving rock art was through incision, or scratching, into the surface of the stone with a lithic flake or metal blade. The motifs produced using this technique are fine-lined and often difficult to see.

===Rock reliefs===

Normally found in literate cultures, a rock relief or rock-cut relief is a relief sculpture carved on solid or &quot;living rock&quot; such as a cliff, rather than a detached piece of stone. They are a category of rock art, and sometimes found in conjunction with rock-cut architecture. However, they tend to be omitted in most works on rock art, which concentrate on engravings and paintings by prehistoric peoples. A few such works exploit the natural contours of the rock and use them to define an image, but they do not amount to man-made reliefs. Rock reliefs have been made in many cultures, and were especially important in the art of the Ancient Near East. Rock reliefs are generally fairly large, as they need to be to make an impact in the open air. Most have figures that are over life-size, and in many the figures are multiples of life-size.

Stylistically they normally relate to other types of sculpture from the culture and period concerned, and except for Hittite and Persian examples they are generally discussed as part of that wider subject. The vertical relief is most common, but reliefs on essentially horizontal surfaces are also found. The term typically excludes relief carvings inside caves, whether natural or themselves man-made, which are especially found in India. Natural rock formations made into statues or other sculpture in the round, most famously at the Great Sphinx of Giza, are also usually excluded. Reliefs on large boulders left in their natural location, like the Hittite İmamkullu relief, are likely to be included, but smaller boulders may be called stelae or carved orthostats.

===Earth figures===
Earth figures are large designs and motifs that are created on the stone ground surface. They can be classified through their method of manufacture. Intaglios are created by scraping away the desert pavements (pebbles covering the ground) to reveal a negative image on the bedrock below. The best known example of such intaglio rock art is the Nazca Lines of Peru. In contrast, &quot;geoglyphs&quot; are positive images, which are created by piling up rocks on the ground surface to resulting in a visible motif or design.

==Motifs and panels==
Traditionally, individual markings are called motifs and groups of motifs are known as &quot;panels&quot;. Sequences of panels are treated as archaeological sites. This method of classifying rock art however has become less popular as the structure imposed is unlikely to have had any relevance to the art&#x27;s creators. Even the word &#x27;art&#x27; carries with it many modern prejudices about the purpose of the features.

Rock art can be found across a wide geographical and temporal spread of cultures perhaps to mark territory, to record historical events or stories or to help enact rituals. Some art seems to depict real events whilst many other examples are apparently entirely abstract.

Prehistoric rock depictions were not purely descriptive. Each motif and design had a &quot;deep significance&quot; that is not always understandable to modern scholars.

==Interpretation and use==

=== Religious interpretations ===
In many instances, the creation of rock art was itself a ritual act.

==Regional variations==
===Europe===

In the Upper Palaeolithic of Europe, rock art was produced inside cave systems by the hunter-gatherer peoples who inhabited the continent. The oldest known example is the Chauvet Cave in France, although others have been located, including Lascaux in France, Alta Mira in Spain and Creswell Crags in Britain and Grotta del Genovese in Sicily.

The late prehistoric rock art of Europe has been divided into three regions by archaeologists. In Atlantic Europe, the coastal seaboard on the west of the continent, which stretches from Iberia up through France and encompasses the British Isles, a variety of different rock arts were produced from the Neolithic through to the Late Bronze Age. A second area of the continent to contain a significant rock art tradition was that of Alpine Europe, with the majority of artworks being clustered in the southern slopes of the mountainous region, in what is now south-eastern France and northern Italy.

===Americas===
The oldest reliably dated rock art in the Americas is known as the &quot;Horny Little Man&quot;. It is petroglyph depicting a stick figure with an oversized phallus and carved in Lapa do Santo, a cave in central-eastern Brazil. The most important site is Serra da Capivara National Park at Piauí state. It is a UNESCO World Heritage Site with the largest collection in the American continent and one of the most studied.

A site including eight miles of paintings or pictographs that is under study in Colombia, South America at Serranía de la Lindosa was revealed in November 2020. Their age is suggested as being 12,500 years old (c. 10,480 B.C.) by the anthropologists working on the site because of extinct fauna depicted.

Rock paintings or pictographs are located in many areas across Canada. There are over 400 sites attributed to the Ojibway from northern Saskatchewan to the Ottawa River.
* Pomier Caves, Dominican Republic
* Naj Tunich, Guatemala
* Rock Paintings of Sierra de San Francisco, Baja California, Mexico

* Hulkhuku, California, United States - The site of Hulkhuku is located in the San Emigdio Hills in South Central California. Archaeologists found that the rock art at the site was meant to be viewed by the general public and was not reserved for the elites of the society or for private rituals. This is based on evidence that the rock art is located in areas that were used by the public for everyday activities.

However, cave art is not the only type of rock art. While cave art provides the two-dimensional view on a rocky surface, figurines made of a rock material can provide a three-dimensional view that gives insight on indigenous views towards their visual arts. Many sites along and off the California coastline, such as the Channel Islands and Malibu, have both realistic and abstract styles of zoomorphic effigy figurines. From archaeological studies at these sites, archaeologists and other researchers discovered many of these figurines and performed a composition analysis, which most of these figurines are made of steatite but there are still made of other materials.

As a result from these archaeological studies, these figures provided context about spheres of interaction between tribal groups, demonstrate economical significance, and possibly hold a ritual function as well. Under one study by archaeologists Richard T Fitzgerald and Christopher Corey, they dated the earliest figurines to be around the Middle Holocene, suggesting two socioeconomic interactive spheres (one in the northern and one in the southern Channel Islands) and linguistic similarities between Takic-speaking Gabrileno and Chumash neighbors. These figurines share similar styles between these tribes, providing a history of interactive contact.

==== California ====
Little Lake is a complex of rock art located in a specific point in time and space (in Rose Valley, Inyo County). Rose Valley is located in the boundaries of the cultural Great Basin and the territory of the Timbisha Shoshone. This site is important to understanding the symbolism and value of North American rock art because it is one of the largest collections of rock art unrelated to the Coso (an indigenous tribe/people of the Mojave Desert). Its importance to territorial and anthropological studies helps many understand the in-depth descriptions and stylistic analyses of large rock art concentrations, which are valued by archaeologists, anthropologists, ethnographers, and even art enthusiasts. Referring back to these sites help social scientists understand and record the values that were important to the creators; it shows economic values or settlement patterns that were once a daily part of life. As a result, it is crucial to focus on the variable resources to understand how cultures were abiding with their environment. However, the rock art related sites at Little Rock can&#x27;t be directly dated or analyzed.

====Western Asia====
* Rock Art in the Ha&#x27;il Region in Saudi Arabia
* Iranian rock art sites are mostly found in the Zagros Mountain range. But there are many other sites in Central Iran, Sistan and Baluchistan, and Azarbaijan. Most of these rock arts date back to the late prehistory and historic period. Among which the well-known sites of Houmian at Kuhdasht, Khomein, and Teimareh in Central Iran are outstanding.
* Large carvings of camels that were discovered in 2018 in Saudi Arabia are estimated to be 7,000 to 8,000 years old. This Neolithic dating would make the carvings significantly older than Stonehenge (5,000 years old) and the Egyptian pyramids at Giza (4,500 years old).

=== Australasia ===
====Australia====

Australian Indigenous art represents the oldest unbroken tradition of art in the world. There are more than 100,000 recorded rock art sites in Australia.

The oldest firmly dated rock-art painting in Australia is a charcoal drawing on a rock fragment found during the excavation of the Nawarla Gabarnmang rock shelter in south western Arnhem Land in the Northern Territory. Dated at 28,000 years, it is one of the oldest known pieces of rock art on Earth with a confirmed date. Nawarla Gabarnmang has one of the most extensive collections of rock art in the world and predates both Lascaux and Chauvet cave art - the earliest known art in Europe - by at least 10,000 years.

In 2008 rock art depicting what is thought to be a Thylacoleo was discovered on the north-western coast of the Kimberley. As the Thylacoleo is believed to have become extinct 45000–46000 years ago (Roberts et al. 2001) (Gillespie 2004), this suggests a similar age for the associated Gwion Gwion rock paintings. Archaeologist Kim Akerman however believes that the megafauna may have persisted later in refugia (wetter areas of the continent) as suggested by Wells (1985: 228) and has suggested a much younger age for the paintings. Pigments from the Gwion Gwion of the Kimberley are so old they have become part of the rock itself, making carbon dating impossible. Some experts suggest that these paintings are in the vicinity of 50,000 years old and may even pre-date Aboriginal settlement.

Miniature rock art of the stencilled variety at a rock shelter known as Yilbilinji, in the Limmen National Park in the Northern Territory, is one of only three known examples of such art. Usually stencilled art is life-size, using body parts as the stencil, but the 17 images of designs of human figures, boomerangs, animals such as crabs and long-necked turtles, wavy lines and geometric shapes are very rare. Found in 2017 by archaeologists, the only other recorded examples are at Nielson&#x27;s Creek in New South Wales and at Kisar Island in Indonesia. It is thought that the designs may have been created by stencils fashioned out of beeswax.
* Kakadu National Park in the Northern Territory has a large collection of ochre paintings. Ochre is a not an organic material, so carbon dating of these pictures is impossible. Sometimes the approximate date, or at least an epoch, can be guessed from the content.
* The Sydney region has important rock engravings.
* Mount Grenfell Historic Site near Cobar, western New South Wales has important ancient rock-drawings.
* The Murujuga (Burrup Peninsula) area of Western Australia near Karratha is estimated to be home to between 500,000 and 1 million individual engravings.
* Kimberley region of Western Australia. Amateur archaeologist Grahame Walsh, who researched Gwion Gwion rock paintings in the region from 1977 until his death in 2007, produced a photographic database of 1.5 million Gwion Gwion rock paintings. Many of the Gwion rock paintings maintain vivid colours because they have been colonised by bacteria and fungi, such as the black fungus, &quot;Chaetothyriales&quot;. The pigments originally applied may have initiated an ongoing, symbiotic relationship between black fungi and red bacteria.
* The Grampians-Gariwerd region is Victoria is one of the richest Aboriginal rock art sites in south-eastern Australia. Some of the more well-known and easily accessible sites are the Ngamadjidj Shelter (Cave of Ghosts), Gulgurn Manja (Flat Rock), Billimina (Glenisla Shelter) and Manja (Cave of Hands); one of the most significant sites in south-eastern Australia is Bunjil&#x27;s Shelter, near Stawell, which is the only known rock art depiction of Bunjil, the creator-being in Aboriginal Australian mythology.
* The Maliwawa Figures in Arnhem Land, a series of 571 paintings and a drawing, created between 6,000 and 9,400 years ago, show a style nor recognised by researchers in the field before new research was done in 2016–2018 and published in September 2020 by Paul Taçon and his team.
* The Turramurra site in western Queensland is opening in 2020. Cliffs on the property, for some time known as Grace Vale Station, are covered with ancient rock art, including paintings and etchings of megafauna, emu symbols and the traditional songline of the Seven Sisters. Planning for an educational centre created from local rock is under way.
The first European discovery of aboriginal rock paintings took place on 14 January 1803. While on a surveying expedition along the shores and islands of the Gulf of Carpentaria, British navigator and explorer Matthew Flinders made landfall on rugged Chasm Island off Groote Eylandt.

Within the island&#x27;s rock shelters, Flinders discovered an array of painted and stenciled patterns. To record these images, he enlisted the ship&#x27;s artist, William Westall. Westall&#x27;s two watercolour sketches are the earliest known documentation of Australian rock art. In his journal, Flinders not only detailed the location and the artworks but also authored the inaugural site report:In the deep sides of the chasms were deep holes or caverns undermining the cliffs; upon the walls of which I found rude drawings, made with charcoal and something like red paint upon the white ground of the rock. These drawings represented porpoises, turtle, kanguroos [sic], and a human hand; and Mr. Westall, who went afterwards to see them, found the representation of a kanguroo [sic], with a file of thirty-two persons following after it. The third person of the band was twice the height of the others, and held in his hand something resembling the whaddie, or wooden sword of the natives of Port Jackson; and was probably intended to represent a chief. They could not, as with us, indicate superiority by clothing or ornament, since they wore none of any kind; and therefore, with the addition of a weapon, similar to the ancients, they seem to have made superiority of person the principal emblem of superior power, of which, indeed, power is usually a consequence in the very early stages of society.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, North Otago and South Canterbury have a rich range of early Māori rock art.
* The Takiroa Rock Art Shelter near Duntroon contains Māori artwork made from ochre and charcoal.

==Studies==
The archaeological sub-discipline devoted to the investigation of rock art is known as &quot;rock art studies&quot;. Rock art specialist David S. Whitley noted that research in this area required an &quot;integrated effort&quot; that brings together archaeological theory, method, fieldwork, analytical techniques and interpretation.

===History===
Although French archaeologists had undertaken much research into rock art, Anglophone archaeology had largely neglected the subject for decades.

The discipline of rock art studies witnessed what Whitley called a &quot;revolution&quot; during the 1980s and 1990s, as increasing numbers of archaeologists in the Anglophone world and Latin America turned their attention to the subject. In doing so, they recognised that rock art could be used to understand symbolic and religious systems, gender relations, cultural boundaries, cultural change and the origins of art and belief. One of the most significant figures in this movement was the South African archaeologist David Lewis-Williams, who published his studies of San rock art from southern Africa, in which he combined ethnographic data to reveal the original purpose of the artworks. Lewis-Williams would come to be praised for elevating rock art studies to a &quot;theoretically sophisticated research domain&quot; by Whitley. However, the study of rock art worldwide is marked by considerable differences of opinion with respect to the appropriateness of various methods and the most relevant and defensible theoretical framework.

===International databases and archives===
The UNESCO World Rock Art Archive Working Group met in 2011 to discuss the base model for a World Rock Art Archive. While no official output has been generated to date, various projects around the world — such as The Global Rock Art Database — are looking at making rock art heritage information more accessible and more visible to assist with rock art awareness, conservation and preservation issues.

<text>The Zwarte Water (&quot;Black Water&quot;) is a river in the Dutch province of Overijssel. It is formed just south of the city of Zwolle when two streams, the Soestwetering and the Nieuwe Wetering, merge. The Zwarte Water then flows north through Zwolle, bends to the northeast, takes in the Vecht near Hasselt and flows past the town of Zwartsluis to discharge in the Zwarte Meer (&quot;Black Lake&quot;, connected to the IJsselmeer lake) near Genemuiden.

Contrary to popular belief, the Zwarte Water is not an IJssel branch, nor is it another name for the Vecht. The river is, however, connected to the IJssel by two canals, the Willemsvaart (dug in the early nineteenth century, now disused) and the Zwolle-IJssel Canal.

<doc id="928511" wikidata="Q847599" url="?curid=928511" title="The Last Waltz">
<text>The Last Waltz was a concert by the Canadian-American rock group The Band, held on American Thanksgiving Day, November 25, 1976, at Winterland Ballroom in San Francisco. &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; was advertised as the Band&#x27;s &quot;farewell concert appearance&quot;, and the concert had the Band joined by more than a dozen special guests, including their previous employers Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan, as well as Paul Butterfield, Bobby Charles, Eric Clapton, Neil Diamond, Emmylou Harris, Dr. John, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, The Staple Singers, Ringo Starr, Muddy Waters, Ronnie Wood, and Neil Young. The musical director for the concert was the Band&#x27;s original record producer, John Simon.

The concert was produced and managed by Bill Graham and was filmed by director Martin Scorsese, who made it into a documentary of the same title, released in 1978. Jonathan Taplin, who was the Band&#x27;s tour manager from 1969 to 1972 and later produced Scorsese&#x27;s film &quot;Mean Streets&quot;, suggested that Scorsese would be the ideal director for the project, and Rock Brynner introduced Robbie Robertson and Scorsese. Taplin served as executive producer. The film features concert performances, intermittent song renditions shot on a studio soundstage, and interviews by Scorsese with members of the Band. The soundtrack and DVD were later released.

&quot;The Last Waltz&quot; is hailed as one of the greatest documentary concert films ever made. In 2019, the film was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the United States National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

==Plot==
Beginning with a title card saying, &quot;This film should be played loud!&quot; the concert documentary covers the Band&#x27;s influences and career. The group consisted of Rick Danko on bass, violin, and vocals, Levon Helm on drums, mandolin, and vocals, Garth Hudson on keyboards, saxophone and accordion, songwriter Richard Manuel on keyboards, drums, percussion and vocals, and guitarist-songwriter Robbie Robertson on vocals.
Various other artists perform with the Band: Muddy Waters, Paul Butterfield, Neil Young, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Dr. John, Neil Diamond, and Eric Clapton. Genres covered include blues, rock and roll, New Orleans R&amp;B, Tin Pan Alley pop, folk, and rock. Further genres are explored in segments filmed later on a sound stage with Emmylou Harris (country) and the Staple Singers (soul and gospel).

The film begins with the Band performing the last song of the evening, their cover version of the Marvin Gaye hit &quot;Don&#x27;t Do It&quot;, as an encore. The film then flashes back to the beginning of the concert, and follows it more or less chronologically. The Band is backed by a large horn section and performs many of its hit songs, including &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot;, &quot;Stage Fright&quot;, and &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;.

The live songs are interspersed with studio segments and interviews conducted by director Martin Scorsese in which the Band&#x27;s members reminisce about the group&#x27;s history. Robertson talks about Hudson joining the band on the condition that the other members pay him $10 a week each for music lessons. The classically trained Hudson could then tell his parents that he was a music teacher instead of merely a rock-and-roll musician. Robertson also describes the surreal experience of playing in a burnt-out nightclub owned by Jack Ruby.

Manuel recalls that some of the early names for the Band included &quot;The Honkies&quot;, and &quot;The Crackers&quot;. Because they were simply referred to as &quot;the band&quot; by Dylan and their friends and neighbors in Woodstock, New York, they figured that was just what they would call themselves.

Danko is seen giving Scorsese a tour of the Band&#x27;s Shangri-La studio, and he plays a recording of &quot;Sip the Wine&quot;, a track from his then-forthcoming 1977 solo album &quot;Rick Danko&quot;.

A recurring theme brought up in the interviews with Robertson is that the concert marks an end of an era for the Band, that after 16 years on the road, the time had come for a change. &quot;That&#x27;s what &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; is - 16 years on the road. The numbers start to scare you,&quot; Robertson tells Scorsese. &quot;I mean, I couldn&#x27;t live with 20 years on the road. I don&#x27;t think I could even discuss it.&quot;

==Origins==
The idea for a farewell concert came about early in 1976 after Richard Manuel was seriously injured in a boating accident. Robbie Robertson then began giving thought to leaving the road, envisioning the Band becoming a studio-only band, similar to the Beatles&#x27; decision to stop playing live shows in 1966. He was also concerned about the negative effects of being on the road too long:

Though the other band members did not agree with Robertson&#x27;s decision, the concert was set at Bill Graham&#x27;s Winterland Ballroom, where the Band had made its debut as a group in 1969. Originally, the Band was to perform on its own, but then the notion of inviting Ronnie Hawkins and Bob Dylan was hatched and the guest list grew to include other performers. Robertson wanted to invite people who had been a strong influence on their music, people who represented various music styles, including New Orleans rock and roll, English blues, and Chicago blues. When he called Bill Graham, he said he wanted the concert to be a kind of celebration, the end of a chapter.

With only six weeks before the planned date, Robertson called director Martin Scorsese, who he knew loved rock music and had worked at the Woodstock Festival, to see if he would direct it as a concert documentary. When he mentioned some of the performers they had lined up, Scorsese reacted quickly: &quot;&quot;Van Morrison?&quot; Are you &quot;kidding?&quot; I &quot;have&quot; to do it. I don&#x27;t have a choice.&quot; The group promoted the concert by appearing on the October 30 episode of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, where host Buck Henry introduced them by saying they were about to disband on Thanksgiving. They went into a set of &quot;Life Is a Carnival&quot; and &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot; (which featured a photo montage of the Band throughout their career) both sung by Helm, Danko then sang &quot;Stage Fright&quot; and closed out the episode with a cover of &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot; with Manuel on lead vocals.

==Concert==
Promoted and organized by Bill Graham, whose home turf was Winterland and who had a long association with the Band, the concert was an elaborate affair, with over 300 workers. Starting at 5:00 pm, the audience of 5,000 was served turkey dinners. There was ballroom dancing, with music by the Berkeley Promenade Orchestra. Poets Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Lenore Kandel, Diane di Prima, Michael McClure, Robert Duncan, and Freewheelin&#x27; Frank gave readings.
The Band started its concert at around 9:00 pm, opening with &quot;Up on Cripple Creek&quot;. This was followed by eleven more of the Band&#x27;s most popular songs, including &quot;The Shape I&#x27;m In&quot;, &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, and &quot;The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down&quot;. They were backed by a large horn section with charts arranged by Allen Toussaint and other musicians.

They were then joined by a succession of guest artists, starting with Ronnie Hawkins. As the Hawks, the Band served as Hawkins&#x27; backing band in the early 1960s. Dr. John took a seat at the piano for his signature song, &quot;Such a Night&quot;. He then switched to guitar and joined Bobby Charles on &quot;Down South in New Orleans&quot;.

A blues set was next with harmonica player Paul Butterfield, Muddy Waters, pianist Pinetop Perkins, and Eric Clapton. As Clapton was taking his first solo on &quot;Further on Up the Road&quot;, his guitar strap came loose and Robertson picked up the solo without missing a beat.

Neil Young followed, singing &quot;Helpless&quot; with backing vocals by Joni Mitchell, who remained off stage. According to Robertson&#x27;s commentary on &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; DVD, this was so her later appearance in the show would have more of an impact. Mitchell came on after Young and sang three songs, two with the backing of Dr. John on congas.

Neil Diamond was next, introducing his &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot; by saying, &quot;I&#x27;m only gonna do one song, but I&#x27;m gonna do it good.&quot; Robertson had produced Diamond&#x27;s album &quot;Beautiful Noise&quot; the same year and co-wrote &quot;Dry Your Eyes&quot;, which during the concert he hailed as a &quot;great song&quot;.

Van Morrison then performed two songs, a special arrangement of &quot;Tura Lura Lural (That&#x27;s an Irish Lullaby)&quot; as a duet with Richard Manuel and his own show-stopper, &quot;Caravan&quot;.
Canadians Young and Mitchell were then invited back out to help the Band perform &quot;Acadian Driftwood&quot;, an ode to the Acadians of Canadian history. The Band then performed a short set of some more of its songs before Bob Dylan came on stage to lead his former backing band through four songs.

The Band and all its guests, with the addition of Ringo Starr on drums and Ronnie Wood on guitar, then sang &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot; as a closing number. Dylan, who wrote the song, and Manuel, whose falsetto rendition had made the song famous on &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;, shared lead vocals, although Manuel cannot be clearly seen in the film and switched between his normal and falsetto voices between verses.

Two loose jam sessions then formed. &quot;Jam #1&quot; featured the Band minus Richard Manuel playing with Neil Young, Ronnie Wood, and Eric Clapton on guitar, Dr. John on piano, Paul Butterfield on harmonica, and Ringo Starr on drums. It was followed by &quot;Jam #2&quot; with the same personnel minus Robertson and Danko. Stephen Stills, who showed up late, took a guitar solo and Carl Radle joined on bass.

The Band then came out at around 2:15 am to perform an encore, &quot;Don&#x27;t Do It&quot;. It was the last time the group performed under the name &quot;the Band&quot; with its classic lineup. The five joined on stage at a Rick Danko concert in 1978. The Band reformed without Robertson in 1980 and headlined at The Roxy in Los Angeles with Scottish group Blue supporting, guests were Dr. John and Joe Cocker. Rick Danko later performed at various Los Angeles venues along with Blue, and at his invitation, they recorded their &quot;LA Sessions&quot; album at Shangri-La Studios.

==Film production==
===Concert filming===
Robertson initially wanted to record the concert on 16 mm film. He recruited Martin Scorsese to direct based on his use of music in &quot;Mean Streets&quot;. Under Scorsese, the film grew into a full-scale studio production with seven 35 mm cameras.

The cameras were operated by several cinematographers: Michael Chapman (&quot;Raging Bull&quot;), László Kovács (&quot;Easy Rider&quot;, &quot;Five Easy Pieces&quot;), Vilmos Zsigmond (&quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;), David Myers (&quot;THX 1138&quot;), Bobby Byrne (&quot;Smokey and the Bandit&quot;), Michael Watkins, and Hiro Narita. The stage and lighting were designed by Boris Leven, who had been the production designer on such musical films as &quot;West Side Story&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;. With Bill Graham&#x27;s assistance, the set from the San Francisco Opera&#x27;s production of &quot;La traviata&quot; was rented as a backdrop for the stage. Crystal chandeliers were also hung over the stage.

John Simon, who ran the rehearsals for the show, would give Scorsese details as to who sang what and who soloed when for each song. Scorsese meticulously storyboarded the songs, setting up lighting and camera cues to fit the lyrics of the songs. But despite his planning, in the rigors of the live concert setting, with the loud rock music and the hours spent filming the show, there were unscripted film reloads and camera malfunctions. It was not possible for all songs to be covered. At one point, all the cameras, except László Kovács&#x27;, were shut down for a scheduled film reload as Muddy Waters was to perform &quot;Mannish Boy&quot;. Kovács, frustrated by Scorsese&#x27;s constant instructions, had removed his headset earlier in the evening and had not heard the orders to stop filming. As Scorsese frantically tried to get other cameras up, Kovács was already rolling and able to capture the iconic song by the blues legend. &quot;It was just luck,&quot; Scorsese recalled in the DVD documentary, &quot;The Last Waltz Revisited&quot;.

Notably omitted from the film is Stephen Stills, who only performed in a jam session. Also omitted were performances by poets Lenore Kandel, Robert Duncan, Freewheelin&#x27; Frank Reynolds, Emmett Grogan, Diane DiPrima and Sweet William. Both jam sessions were omitted from the film entirely.

=== Unexpected negotiations with Dylan ===

While Bob Dylan had agreed to perform at the concert, which was being filmed, he decided during the intermission that he did not want his own performance filmed after all. He feared it might detract from his film &quot;Renaldo and Clara&quot;, which he directed during the Rolling Thunder Revue tour, which ended months earlier. However, Warner Bros. had agreed to finance &quot;Last Waltz&quot; only if Dylan would appear in it.

Levon Helm said that Scorsese &quot;went nuts&quot; upon hearing that Dylan changed his mind, while &quot;Robbie became totally pale.&quot; More than a million dollars would have been lost without Dylan&#x27;s performance in the film, said Helm. Jonathan Taplin, the Band&#x27;s manager and producer of the film, was also beside himself, knowing that he had no influence over Dylan. He, along with Robertson and Scorsese, then went to Graham: &quot;Bill, you&#x27;re going to have to go and talk to Bob.&quot; They knew that Graham had worked with Dylan before, such as during Graham&#x27;s SNACK Benefit Concert a year earlier. They wanted Graham to explain to Dylan how dire the situation was, said Helm.

As Graham walked toward Dylan&#x27;s dressing room, he tried to reassure them, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry, I&#x27;m gonna make it happen.&quot; As they waited, there were frantic backstage negotiations between Graham and Dylan, recalls Helm:

Robertson also assured Dylan that the concert film&#x27;s release would be delayed until after his film. Taplin later said that &quot;Bill did the greatest thing that night. In a sense, he really saved the day for us.&quot;

At one point during Dylan&#x27;s performance, Robertson states that Lou Kemp, a close friend of Dylan, said &quot;We&#x27;re not filming this.&quot; And Bill just said, &quot;Get out of here, or I&#x27;ll kill you.&quot; Graham told him &quot;This is &quot;history&quot;, don&#x27;t mess with it!&quot; Kemp backed off. To add to the confusion, Scorsese said that when Dylan got on stage, the sound was so loud he did not know what to shoot: &quot;Fortunately, we got our cues right and we shot the two songs that were used in the film.&quot;

According to Kemp, &quot;More or less, Bob got his way. I think they shot a little more than he wanted but they didn&#x27;t shoot as much as &quot;they&quot; wanted. As it ended up, everybody came out whole. Robertson was also satisfied:
===Drug use===

Scorsese has said he was using cocaine heavily during this period. Drugs were present in large quantities during the concert. During post-production Neil Young&#x27;s manager insisted that a large blob of cocaine on the guitarist&#x27;s nose be removed with special effects. Scorsese reportedly pushed back, defending the cocaine&#x27;s appearance as &quot;rock &amp; roll.&quot; When Young&#x27;s management insisted the post-production team created a special effect—known in-house as “the traveling booger matte.” This rotoscoped matte hovered over Young&#x27;s face for the duration of his appearance on-screen, obscuring the cocaine blob that clung to his nose.

===Post-concert production===
Following the concert, Scorsese filmed for several days on an MGM studio soundstage, with the Band, the Staple Singers and Emmylou Harris. The Band&#x27;s performance of &quot;The Weight&quot; with the Staple Singers was included in the film instead of the concert version. The Band and Harris performed &quot;Evangeline&quot;, which was also included in the film. Interviews with group members were conducted by Scorsese at the Band&#x27;s Shangri-La Studio in Malibu, California. Additionally, Robertson composed &quot;The Last Waltz Suite&quot;, parts of which were used as a film score. Finally, according to musical director John Simon, during post-production, the live recording was altered to clean up &quot;playing mistakes, out-of-tune singing, bad horn-balance in the remote truck. Only Levon&#x27;s part was retained in its entirety.&quot;

Due to Scorsese&#x27;s commitments on &quot;New York, New York&quot; and another documentary, &quot;American Boy: A Profile of Steven Prince&quot;, the film&#x27;s release was delayed until 1978.

During the editing process, Scorsese and Robertson became friends, and frequently collaborated on further projects, with Robertson acting as music producer and consultant on &quot;Raging Bull&quot;, &quot;The King of Comedy&quot;, &quot;The Color of Money&quot;, &quot;Casino&quot;, &quot;Gangs of New York&quot;, &quot;The Departed,&quot; &quot;Shutter Island, The Wolf of Wall Street, Silence, The Irishman&quot; and &quot;Killers of the Flower Moon&quot;.

==Reception==

===Critical reception===

The film has been hailed critically, listed among the greatest concert films. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 50 reviews, with an average rating of 8.60/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Among one of, if not the best rock movie ever made, &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; is a revealing, electrifying view of the classic band at their height.&quot; &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; film critic Michael Wilmington calls it &quot;the greatest rock concert movie ever made – and maybe the best rock movie, period&quot;. Terry Lawson of the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; comments that &quot;This is one of the great movie experiences.&quot; &quot;Total Film&quot; considers it &quot;the greatest concert film ever shot&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave it a negative review, stating that it &quot;articulates so little of the end-of-an-era feeling it hints at ... that it&#x27;s impossible to view the &quot;Last Waltz&quot; as anything but an also-ran.&quot; However, &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 2003 placed the film on its &quot;Best 1000 Movies Ever&quot; list, while &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called it the &quot;Greatest Concert Movie of All Time&quot;.

Music critic Robert Christgau gives the soundtrack a &quot;B+&quot;, saying &quot;the movie improves when you can&#x27;t see it.&quot; He praises the blues numbers by Muddy Waters and Paul Butterfield, the horn arrangements by Allen Toussaint, and the &quot;blistering if messy&quot; guitar duet by Robertson and Eric Clapton. Film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film three stars out of a possible four, noting that although &quot;the film is such a revealing document of a time&quot;, it also suggested the musicians had reached the end of their careers.

===Criticism by Levon Helm===
Levon Helm, in his 1993 autobiography &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s on Fire&quot;, expresses serious reservations about Scorsese&#x27;s handling of the film, claiming that Scorsese and Robertson (who produced the film) conspired to make the Band look like Robertson&#x27;s sidemen. He states that Robertson, who is depicted singing powerful backing vocals, was actually singing into a microphone that was turned off throughout most of the concert (a typical practice during their live performances).

Helm was also dissatisfied with Manuel and Hudson&#x27;s minimal screen time and the fact most of the band members never received any money for the various home videos, DVDs and soundtracks released by Warner Bros. after the project.

===Appreciation by Robbie Robertson===

Robertson said he was relieved when the concert ended, as he was constantly worried that something would go wrong, as it did when Dylan suddenly backed out of being filmed. To all the people involved, he said &quot;Thank God we got through it.&quot; He recalls that all the cameramen were hugging one another, feeling they had succeeded in capturing a unique rock concert on film.

He also thanked Graham for producing the concert at Winterland, where the Band had its debut in 1969:
==Home video releases==
For the concert&#x27;s 25th anniversary in 2002, the film was remastered and a new theatrical print was made for a limited release to promote the release of the DVD and four-CD box set of the film soundtrack. It opened in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro Theatre, with the release later expanded to 15 theaters.

The DVD features a commentary track by Robertson and Scorsese, a featurette, &quot;Revisiting The Last Waltz&quot;, and a gallery of images from the concert, the studio filming and the film premiere. A bonus scene is footage of &quot;Jam #2&quot;, which is cut short because they had run out of replacement sound synchronizers for the cameras after ten hours of continuous filming.

The original 2002 DVD release was packaged as a &quot;special edition&quot;. In addition to the extra features on the disc, the Amaray case came in a foil-embossed cardboard sleeve, and inside was an eight-page booklet, featuring a five-page essay by Robertson entitled &quot;The End of a Musical Journey&quot;. Also included was a US$5 rebate coupon for the four-CD box set. In 2005, the DVD was re-issued with different artwork and stripped of the outer foil packaging, inner booklet and coupon; the disc&#x27;s contents remained unchanged.

In 2006, &quot;The Last Waltz&quot; was among the first eight titles released in Sony&#x27;s high definition Blu-ray format. The soundtracks on the Blu-ray release consist of an uncompressed 5.1 Linear PCM track, a very high fidelity format, and a standard Dolby Digital 5.1 track.

On March 29, 2022, The Criterion Collection released a new 4K digital restoration, supervised and approved by Scorsese, with Dolby Vision HDR and a 5.1 surround DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack, supervised and approved by Robertson.

==Albums==

The original soundtrack album was a three-LP album released on April 16, 1978 (later as a two-disc CD). It has many songs not in the film, including &quot;Down South in New Orleans&quot; with Bobby Charles and Dr. John on guitar, &quot;Tura Lura Lural (That&#x27;s an Irish Lullaby)&quot; by Van Morrison, &quot;Life is a Carnival&quot; by the Band, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Believe You (She Acts Like We Never Have Met)&quot; by Bob Dylan. John Casado designed the packaging and logotype trademark.

In 2002, a four-CD box set was released, as was a DVD-Audio edition. Robbie Robertson produced the album, remastering all the songs. The set includes 16 previously unreleased songs from the concert, as well as takes from rehearsals. Among the additions are Louis Jordan&#x27;s &quot;Caldonia&quot; by Muddy Waters, the concert version of &quot;The Weight&quot;, &quot;Jam #1&quot; and &quot;Jam #2&quot; in their entirety, and extended sets with Joni Mitchell and Bob Dylan.

The soundtrack recordings underwent post-concert production featuring heavy use of overdubbing and re-sequencing. Bootleg collectors have circulated an original line recording of the concert as a more accurate and complete document of the event. It includes songs not available in the film or the official album releases, including &quot;Georgia on My Mind&quot;, &quot;King Harvest (Has Surely Come)&quot;, the complete &quot;Chest Fever&quot; and the live version of &quot;Evangeline&quot;.

<text>Lake Nokomis is one of several lakes in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and part of the city&#x27;s Chain of Lakes. The lake was previously named Lake Amelia in honor of Captain George Gooding&#x27;s daughter, Amelia, in 1819. Its current name was adopted in 1910 to honor Nokomis, grandmother of Hiawatha. It is located in the southern part of the city, west of the Mississippi River and south of Lake Hiawatha. The lake is oval in shape, with a long axis running southwest to northeast. Two pathways circle the lake, a pedestrian trail and a bicycle trail. Because the lower part of the lake is crossed by Cedar Avenue running north–south, the impression from the ground is that the lake is shaped like an L. The lake has an area of .

==History==
When purchased in 1907 by the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board, the lake was very shallow, only deep in the deepest spot. Much of it was actually marshland or slough—a drainage area for the neighborhood. It was deepened by dredging to produce the current lake. Within years of its development, Lake Nokomis surpassed Bde Maka Ska as the most popular swimming beach on Minneapolis city lakes; in 1924 attendance at the Lake Nokomis bathhouse was nearly triple the attendance at the Bde Maka Ska bath house.

In 1940, Dr. Chris Lambertsen performed about 12 Scuba dives in his Lambertsen Amphibious Respiratory Unit (LARU) prototype in Lake Nokomis. The LARU was the first rebreather designed and built in the United States and these dives are the first closed-circuit oxygen dives in U.S. history. On one of these dives, Lambertsen experienced an episode of oxygen toxicity but managed to surface without assistance.

Lake Nokomis has recently undergone a preservation project, creating areas of native vegetation along its shores. Several artificial ponds have been added to a more practical degree, as the areas where they are now were almost always flooded.

The local population uses the lake for a variety of purposes. Fishing and sailing are popular, there are two beaches with good (imported) sand, and the surrounding large park has facilities for walking and running, softball, cycling, and other sports.

The main beach along the northwest side has a restaurant, concessions, restrooms, and a variety of rental equipment, along with a playground. The smaller beach on the northeast side has no concessions but does have portable toilets. The lake bed drops off suddenly beyond the designated swimming areas, prompting a surprising and potentially dangerous environment for anyone swimming outside the ropes. This was cited as a contributing factor in the drowning death of an area teen in July 2006 at the beach.

Lake Nokomis has been the site of one of the more distinctive activities in the Minneapolis Aquatennial celebration, the &quot;Milk Carton Boat Race,&quot; from 1983 to 2000, although that event was relocated back to Bde Maka Ska in 2001. It is also home to the Life Time Fitness triathlon each July, and numerous other races on summer weekends.

Up until 1998, the lake was noted for having a number of very large and old trees which spanned several feet in diameter along the east shore, but these were uprooted in 1998 when a severe storm with high winds moved through the area.

== Fish ==
The lake contains black bullhead, black crappie, bluegill, bowfin, largemouth bass, carp, golden shiner, hybrid sunfish, pumpkinseed, tiger muskellunge, walleye, white sucker, yellow bullhead, and yellow perch. Some fish consumption guideline restrictions have been placed on the lake&#x27;s walleye and white sucker due to mercury contamination.

<doc id="928516" wikidata="Q897317" url="?curid=928516" title="Winemaker">
<text>A winemaker or vintner is a person engaged in winemaking. They are generally employed by wineries or wine companies, where their work includes:
*Cooperating with viticulturists
*Monitoring the maturity of grapes to ensure their quality and to determine the correct time for harvest
*Crushing and pressing grapes
*Monitoring the settling of juice and the fermentation of grape material
*Filtering the wine to remove remaining solids
*Testing the quality of wine by tasting
*Placing filtered wine in casks or tanks for storage and maturation
*Preparing plans for bottling wine once it has matured
*Making sure that quality is maintained when the wine is bottled

Today, these duties require an increasing amount of scientific knowledge, since laboratory tests are gradually supplementing or replacing traditional methods. Winemakers can also be referred to as oenologists as they study oenology – the science of wine.

==Vintner==

A vintner is a wine merchant. In some modern use, particularly in American English, the term is also used as a synonym for &quot;winemaker&quot;.

The term started in Middle English, superseding the earlier term &quot;vinter&quot;.

Due to the close political and commercial ties between Bordeaux and England during the 14th and early 15th centuries, vintners were among the more important people in London with winemakers being four times mayor of the city under the reign of Edward II. The Worshipful Company of Vintners is one of the oldest livery companies in London.

==Vigneron==

A vigneron is someone who cultivates a vineyard for winemaking. The word connotes or emphasizes the critical role that vineyard placement and maintenance has in the production of high-quality wine. The term, French for someone who grows grapes or makes wine, is often used in Australia to describe a winemaker who is also involved as an owner or manager as opposed to a person who is employed only to make wine, who is generally referred to as a winemaker. It is also used when referring to a winemaker from France.

Vincent of Saragossa is the patron saint of vignerons.

==&quot;Négociant&quot;==
Négociant is the French term for a wine merchant who assembles the produce of smaller growers and winemakers and sells the result under its own name.

&quot;Négociants&quot; buy everything from grapes to grape must to wines in various states of completion. In the case of grapes or must, the &quot;négociant&quot; performs virtually all the winemaking. If he buys already fermented wine in barrels or &quot;en-vrac&quot;—basically in bulk containers, he may age the wine further, blend in other wines or simply bottle and sell it as is. The result is sold under the name of the &quot;négociant&quot;, not the name of the original grape or wine producer.

Some &quot;négociants&quot; have a recognizable house style.

&quot;Négociants&quot;, who are also called wine merchants/traders, were the dominant force in the wine trade until the last 25 years for various reasons:
* Historically the owners of vineyards and producers of wine had no direct access to buyers.
* It was too expensive for growers to purchase the wine presses and bottling lines necessary to produce a finished wine.
* Owning only a small portion of a particular high-quality single vineyard (&quot;lieu-dit&quot;) meant that a grower often had insufficient wine from a parcel to vinify on its own. Under French inheritance laws, vineyard holdings were often split until offspring owned no more than a single row of grapes, not enough to fill a barrel. Since prices for a &quot;premier cru&quot; are typically higher than for wines from a larger area like a village or region, the grower could make more money selling off the production as the &quot;premier cru&quot; rather than blending it into a less specific appellation.

Many &quot;négociants&quot; are also vineyard owners in their own right. In Burgundy for instance, &quot;négociants&quot; such as Bouchard Père et Fils and Faiveley are among the largest owners of vineyards. Well-known &quot;négociants&quot; in Burgundy are Maison Louis Jadot, Joseph Drouhin, and Vincent Girardin; in Beaujolais, Georges Duboeuf; in Provence, Mirabeau; and in the Rhône region, Guigal, Jaboulet, Jean-Luc Colombo, Chapoutier, and Famille Perrin&quot;.

<doc id="928517" wikidata="Q337050" url="?curid=928517" title="Avery Fisher">
<text>Avery Robert Fisher (March 4, 1906 – February 26, 1994) was an amateur violinist, a pioneer in the field of high fidelity sound reproduction, founder of the Philharmonic Radio Company and Fisher Electronics, and a philanthropist who donated millions of dollars to arts organizations and universities.

==Early life and career==
Avery Fisher was born in Brooklyn, New York, the youngest of Charles (Anschel) (1868-1946) and Mary (Miriam) (née Byrach) (1869-1945) Fisher&#x27;s six children. He came from a Jewish family. His parents had emigrated in 1903 (three years before his birth) from Kyiv, then a part of the Russian Empire.

Fisher said he became fascinated with music through his father&#x27;s extensive collection of early phonograph cylinder recordings and that everyone in the family had to learn to play a musical instrument. &quot;I was born into a musical family. Every one of my parents&#x27; children was given an opportunity to learn an instrument. Papa would go down the line: violin, piano, violin, piano, violin&quot;.

He attended DeWitt Clinton High School, graduated from New York University with a Bachelor of Science Engineering (B.Sc.Eng.) degree in 1929, and subsequently worked for six years in book publishing and book design. During this time, Fisher, an amateur violinist, began experimenting with audio design and acoustics. He wanted to make a radio that would sound like he was listening to a live orchestra — a radio that would achieve high fidelity reproduction of the original sound.

===Book design and moonlighting as an audio equipment engineer===
Fisher explained his desire to leave publishing and move into audio design, saying, &quot;That&#x27;s how I started to make a living when I got out of college. I worked with a publishing house, Dodd, Mead and Company – to whom I owe everything when you get right down to it. I worked at Dodd, Mead &amp; Co. for the single most cruel person I have ever met in my lifetime – and I&#x27;m not exaggerating. This man was only a year older than I. He was the boss&#x27;s son, and I think he sensed my apprehension about having a job at all. I went to work there in 1933, having been in the advertising agency that handled their account before that. That agency closed when the banks closed in 1933, and I was out of work for about six months. In the fall of that year, I went to Dodd, Mead asking if they could use my services, and they hired me for $18 a week. After about six months, perhaps out of guilt or something, they gave me a two-dollar raise. I was doing the same work there that I was doing for them at the agency, and the agency used to charge them $100 to design a [promotional] brochure. I used to turn out two or three of those a week, and I still was getting only $18 or $20.&quot;

Fisher continued, &quot;In 1937, I noticed that the advertising department of Dodd, Mead was buying their photo-engravings from one source, and their book manufacturing department was buying from another. If they combined both those purchases and bought from one source, their quantity discount would save them just under $10,000 a year. I went to my superior, Ed Dodd, and told him about it. He said, &quot;That&#x27;s a great idea, Fisher.&quot; He never called me by my first name – always by my last, you know, like a deckhand. He said, &quot;I think I&#x27;ll do something about it.&quot; And they did. And I said, &quot;By the way, I&#x27;d be very grateful if I could have a five-dollar raise.&quot; He could have said, &quot;Well, not right now.&quot; But instead, he said, &quot;Well, no. We probably could get some young Yale boy in here to do your work for less than we&#x27;re paying you.&quot; That day, I said to myself, &quot;I&#x27;ve got to get out of here one way or another,&quot; and I started putting [radio-phonograph] sets together for friends. I was moonlighting, and I did that for a number of years before I was in a position to get out and really spend full time on this. By 1943, I&#x27;d built up my company, Philharmonic Radio, to the point where I could draw enough money from it to earn a living. By that time, I had a wife and child. So I owe them [Dodd, Mead] everything. Because I really loved my work as a book designer, and I turned out some very fine stuff, which won prizes. One of the books I turned out was called Grassroot Jungles, which became one of the 50 best books of the year for graphic design—this is out of 40,000 titles—and Ed Dodd never let me put my name in a book for credit as the designer. Now, this is a long answer to your simple question: what got me into hi-fi? It was an act of desperation—and also of love because I really enjoyed hearing good equipment.&quot;

Fisher explained the start of his career in high-fidelity audio, saying, &quot;...I was developing my hobby in hi-fi, and a number of friends asked me to make for them the kind of equipment I was constructing for my own home, the sort of thing that was not commercially available, the type of thing found in radio stations or movie theaters. And so I started constructing for this small group of people, and before I knew it, I had the beginnings of a business.&quot;

==Consumer electronics==

===Philharmonic Radio Co.===
In 1937 Fisher established his first company, the Philharmonic Radio Company with Victor Brociner, producing the company&#x27;s first high-fidelity radio receivers. Philharmonic Radio equipment was well regarded, earning Fisher the beginning of his reputation as a leader in audio equipment.

A January 1940 Consumers Union comparison test of high fidelity radio-phonograph recommended Philharmonic&#x27;s $295 () 14-tube Linear Standard console unit, saying &quot;Quality of reproduction judged best of high fidelity radios tested. For critical listeners who want the best possible tone quality regardless of price, the extra cost of this model is justified.&quot; The second unit recommended was the $219 () Philharmonic Futura Carillon. &quot;Difference in quality of reproduction between this model and the Linear Standard discernible only to the musician or engineer... the tone quality of this set will be considered perfect.

With the invention of FM broadcasting by Edwin Armstrong, Fisher&#x27;s desire to have a radio and amplifying device that could meet his goal of true high fidelity became a reality. In one of the earliest comparison tests of six FM receivers, Consumers Union gave the Philharmonic Futura K-1 its highest recommendation, saying &quot;its performance on broadcast was outstanding.&quot; The November 1941 review of the $377.50 () unit also said, &quot;It also used one of the most satisfactory of the record changers tested and was best as to tone quality.&quot; The review also noted the unit was safer than others, saying, &quot;Only radio tested with no shock hazard at record player.&quot;

In 1960, Fisher&#x27;s circa 1937 &quot;Philharmonic Futura&quot; high-fidelity tuner with power supply and his &quot;Philharmonic Futura&quot; high-fidelity automatic turntable were acquired by the Smithsonian and displayed in the Electrical division of the National Museum of American History. The amplified &quot;Philharmonic Futura&quot; tuner assembly was deemed the &quot;nation&#x27;s first high-fidelity (audio) receiver&quot;.

===Military and government production===
A US government order suspended the production of radios for civilian use in April 1942.

Reformed as the Philharmonic Radio Corporation, the company started producing military radio equipment and manufacturing the SSR-5A radio receiver during World War II for the US and Allied forces. Part of the SSTR-5 (Strategic Service Transmitter-Receiver) Radio Set developed late in the war was considerably smaller than the SSTR-1 and was carried in a canvas shoulder bag. Components included the SSR-5 receiver and the SST-5 transmitter. The set was designed to be operated from battery power (the receiver uses 135V, 6V, and 1.5V). In addition to a standard model, both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; variants were made. The SSR-5A receiver was made by Philharmonic.

Philharmonic Radio also produced airport instrument landing systems for control tower communication with commercial and military airplanes. One of their largest installations was deployed at the New York Municipal Airport, now named the LaGuardia Airport.

Fisher said, &quot;During the war, we were working on subcontracts for the Navy. We were turning out &#x27;IFF&#x27; equipment, which is Identification, Friend or Foe. It was a transponder, so you could tell whether an aircraft was one of ours or one of theirs. You&#x27;d send out a beam, and you had to get a signal reply back. We also designed the first instrument landing system used at LaGuardia Airport for the Civil Aeronautics Administration in Washington. In 1943, we didn&#x27;t have enough money to finance the contract work we were able to get, so the company was sold to American Type Founders, who needed an electronic division. I stayed on as president until 1945, but when the war was over, I resigned and, taking certain key people with me, started Fisher Radio&quot;.

==Fisher Radio==
Fisher sold his interest in Philharmonic Radio and founded his second audio firm, Fisher Radio Company, which developed, manufactured and marketed high-performance audio products under the trade name &quot;The Fisher&quot;.
By the 1950s, the term receiver was used instead of radio for a unit that combined a tuner and an amplifier but lacked speakers. In 1957, the Fisher Radio Company produced its first high-fidelity FM/AM receiver, the monophonic 14-tube Fisher 500 (TA500).

In 1958, H. H. Scott introduced the first true stereophonic receiver, which used a stereo multiplex decoder. Fisher followed with its $350 (), 22-tube, stereophonic 600 (TA600) receiver in 1959. (A multiplex option, the Fisher MPX-200, required four additional tubes)

Between 1964 and 1968, Fisher produced a series of tube stereo receivers that are considered by many to be among the finest ever made. Starting with the 500c (which debuted in the mid $300, a hefty sum in 1964) and, paradoxically, ending with the 400, tens of thousands of these units were produced. These have become collector&#x27;s items, beloved for their sound, build quality, FM tuner and phono stages, and beautiful appearance. The 400 included a green magic eye tube, which, by creating an image of a broken green bar that slowly closed to a solid bar, assisted users in tuning to the best possible position on the dial for a given station and added to the aesthetics. The 400 is considered by many to be the best-sounding of the three models.

Between 1963 and 1964, Fisher introduced their first all-transistor stereophonic receiver, the Fisher 400T. Hi-fi enthusiasts did not highly regard early transistor receivers, so manufacturers such as Fisher began using them only gradually. In the 1960s, Fisher made two trend-setting breakthroughs, marketing the first all-transistor (solid-state) amplifier and the first receiver-phonograph combination, the forerunner of the compact stereo and integrated component system. These products brought Avery Fisher both fame and fortune. From 1959 to 1961, the firm also made important improvements in AM-FM stereo tuner design.

==Sale of Fisher Electronics==
In 1969, Fisher sold his company to the Emerson Electric Company for US $31 million. Fisher distributed a sizable portion of the proceeds from the sale among his key employees. Fisher served as a consultant to the new management team. Sanyo purchased Fisher Electronics from Emerson in May 1977.

==Community service and philanthropy==
A lifelong philanthropist, Fisher served on the board of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, the New York Philharmonic, Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and the Marlboro Festival. He also established the Avery Fisher Artist Program, which includes the Avery Fisher Prize and Career Grants in 1974.

==Avery Fisher Artist Prize==
It was Avery&#x27;s idea to start this program in 1974.

Avery Fisher Artist Prize winner Emanuel Ax said of the prize &quot;One problem musicians face, is that we are constantly being judged. I&#x27;ve tried to learn not to rely on outside opinion, because if you do, you can go mad, and you can end up unable to trust your own judgment. I&#x27;m also generally not a believer in awards. The reward is inside you. But the Avery Fisher Prize is a special kind of recognition, and what makes it so tremendously gratifying is that it comes from your peers who recommend you for it – who say, &#x27;He plays well, he&#x27;s done good things, and he&#x27;s worthy of being an American pianist.&#x27; I don&#x27;t think the aim is to advance our careers, necessarily. It&#x27;s more like the Pulitzer or the Nobel Prizes in that it acknowledges that you&#x27;ve achieved something worthwhile.&quot;

==The Avery Fisher Center for Music &amp; Media==
The Avery Fisher Center for Music &amp; Media (originally named the &quot;Avery Fisher Listening Room&quot;) at the Elmer Holmes Bobst Library of New York University was established in 1987 with assistance from the Avery and Janet Fisher Foundation. Fisher explained the reason for his donation to the New York University Division of Libraries, saying, &quot;I was a graduate of N.Y.U.,&quot; he said, &quot;and I owe a great deal to them because I was there on a working scholarship.&quot;

Later gifts from the Fisher family helped the Avery Fisher Center acquire new equipment in 2017 during renovation designed by the architectural firm Perkins Eastman and managed by the R.P. Brennan general contracting firm of New York, NY.

The Avery Fisher Center for Music and Media, an 8-library, six-million-volume system, is one of the world&#x27;s largest academic media centers. &quot;His generous contribution to NYU has helped to make the Avery Fisher Center one of the largest academic media centers in the world.&quot; The Center is located on seventh floor of NYU&#x27;s Bobst Library. The Fisher Center&#x27;s video collection of DVDs, Blu-rays, and videocassettes contains a wide variety of classic and contemporary featuring American videos and those from around the world. TV series, stage and concert performances, documentaries, and art films are included in the library collection. The Avery Fisher Center&#x27;s facilities include collaborative media rooms and a &quot;state-of-the-art immersion&quot; room. One of the world&#x27;s largest academic media centers, it features over 100 audio and video viewing carrels and three media-enhanced classrooms. Students and researchers use more than 100,000 audio and video recordings per year at the Avery Fisher Center.

==Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center==
===Funded Philharmonic Hall renovation at Lincoln Center===
Fisher was known for having donated $10.5 million (U.S.) () to renovate the Philharmonic Hall auditorium in the Lincoln Center cultural complex in upper Manhattan. Fisher had a reputation for modesty and resisted the hall being named in his honor. John Mazzola, the general manager of Lincoln Center, had to persuade Fisher to permit the renaming. Fisher protested that no one paid attention to such things and quipped, &quot;Who&#x27;s Major Deegan?&quot; (a reference to the obscure namesake of the Major Deegan Expressway in the Bronx). Avery Fisher Hall housed the New York Philharmonic and was the site of various other musical and cultural events featuring many musical ensembles. The hall was named for Fisher in 1973.

===Avery Fisher Hall renaming===
In 2014, Lincoln Center officials announced their plan to remove his name from the Hall in favor of a new donor. On November 13, 2014, they laid out a timetable for naming rights to be sold to the highest bidder in a drive to raise a total of $500 million toward renovation set to commence in 2019. Said Lincoln Center chairwoman Katherine Farley, &quot;It will be an opportunity for a major name on a great New York jewel.&quot;

===Fisher family protest===
When Lincoln Center first approached them about renaming Avery Fisher Hall after a new donor, Fisher&#x27;s family threatened legal action. When Fisher set forth the conditions of his donation regarding the renaming of the venue in 1973, he stipulated the name Avery Fisher Hall &quot;will appear on tickets, brochures, program announcements and advertisements and the like, and I consent in perpetuity to such use.&quot; During the negotiations with the Fisher family, Lincoln Center began renovating some portions of the Lincoln Center complex, leaving Avery Fisher Hall untouched.

After three months of negotiation, Fisher&#x27;s children agreed to end the perpetual agreement that their father had established. Lincoln Center agreed to induct Fisher into the new Lincoln Center Hall of Fame meant to &quot;celebrate artists, leaders and philanthropists who have played central roles at Lincoln Center&quot;. It was further agreed that a Fisher family member would serve on the Hall of Fame&#x27;s advisory board and the Avery Fisher Classical Music Wing selection committee, helping choose inductees into the Wing, which would contain archival materials about Mr. Fisher. The agreement also promised to give the Avery Fisher Artist Program a higher profile. The agreement also provided Fisher&#x27;s three children $15 million for consenting to the agreement.

The Hall was renamed David Geffen Hall in September 2015 after Geffen pledged a $100 million donation to the Lincoln Center renovation.

==Other interests==

===Book design and typography===
Though he left publishing in 1943, he said book design was &quot;my first love.&quot; He still designed books long after he had made a fortune in audio. For example, he designed &quot;A History of the English-Speaking Peoples&quot; by Winston Churchill (1960) and &quot;The American Seasons&quot; by Edwin Way Teale (1976). He donated his fees for those projects to charities. Fisher told an interviewer in 1976, &quot;Looking at a beautiful typographical design is like listening to music.&quot;

===Music===
One of Fisher&#x27;s most prized possessions was a genuine 1692 Stradivarius violin. He would loan the violin to promising artists for special performances.

===Automobiles===
Fisher was a lifelong automobile enthusiast. As an enthusiastic driver, he said, &quot;I began in 1932 with the purchase of an Aston Martin, and since that time, I&#x27;ve owned nothing but foreign cars. I still drive a 10-year-old Rover Mark III... when I die, I&#x27;ll be seated at the wheel of the Rover, and the whole thing will be lowered into the ground. Of course, all gassed up, in case I want to go somewhere.&quot;

Fisher founded the A. R. Fisher Products Corporation, offering specialty products to the auto enthusiast market. He imported aftermarket foreign auto parts and sold items such as high-performance Abarth exhaust systems for Fiats and Volkswagens in the early 1950s.

==Death==
Fisher died at age 87 at the New Milford Hospital in New Milford, Connecticut, on February 26, 1994, from complications from a stroke. His body was cremated. Fisher said of his life in a 1976 interview, &quot;You know, I&#x27;ve been awfully lucky. My whole life has been devoted to giving people pleasure.&quot;

== Legacy and honors ==
* 1956 – Elected Chairman of the Board, Institute of High Fidelity Manufacturers.
* 1960 – Fisher&#x27;s circa 1937 &quot;Philharmonic Futura&quot; high-fidelity tuner with power supply and his &quot;Philharmonic Futura&quot; high-fidelity automatic turntable were acquired by the Smithsonian and displayed as the &quot;nation&#x27;s first high-fidelity (audio) receiver&quot;.

<doc id="928520" wikidata="Q208100" url="?curid=928520" title="Lamberto Dini">
<text>Lamberto Dini (born 1 March 1931) is an Italian politician and economist. He was the Director General of Bank of Italy from 1979 to 1994, Minister of Treasury from 1994 to 1996, the 51st prime minister of Italy from 1995 to 1996, and Foreign Minister from 1996 to 2001.

== Early life and career ==
After studying Economics in his native city of Florence, Dini took up a post at the International Monetary Fund in 1959, where he worked his way up until he served as Executive Director for Italy, Greece, Portugal and Malta between 1976 and 1979. Then, in October 1979, he moved to the Banca d&#x27;Italia, where he served as an executive until May 1994. When the Governor of the Bank of Italy, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, with whom Dini had developed a rivalry, was called upon to serve as prime minister in April 1993, Dini was widely tipped to succeed him, but was passed over (allegedly on Ciampi&#x27;s instigation) in favour of Antonio Fazio.

Dini made a comeback when Silvio Berlusconi formed the Berlusconi I Cabinet in May 1994, in which Dini served as Treasury Minister. Due to a split between Berlusconi and his coalition partner Umberto Bossi, the Lega Nord leader, Berlusconi&#x27;s government collapsed in December 1994, after a mere seven months in power. In January 1995, Dini was appointed as prime minister by President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. Dini also took the portfolio for treasury in the cabinet and was a non-elected prime minister and minister. Though he was not noted as a left-winger, he was given the confidence vote of the left-wing parties (apart from the Communist Refoundation Party) and by Lega Nord, whereas his erstwhile partners in the right-wing government chose to abstain whilst citing benevolence. His cabinet was a technocratic one.

== The Olive Tree ==
In April 1996, a general election was called, in which Berlusconi&#x27;s House of Freedoms coalition, minus the Lega Nord, was pitted against that of Romano Prodi, The Olive Tree. Relations between Dini and Berlusconi had seriously soured by then, and Dini chose to join The Olive Tree with his own centrist party, Italian Renewal. Dini was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies, and served for the entire term as Minister of Foreign Affairs in four successive centre-left governments, under Prodi, Massimo D&#x27;Alema in two separate, successive cabinets, and finally Giuliano Amato.

His party has merged into The Daisy, a larger party formed out of several centrist parties belonging to the centre-left coalition. The May 2001 the general election was won by Berlusconi and his allies (including, once again, Lega Nord), which led to Berlusconi forming his second government in June. Dini was elected to the Italian Senate, and, in this capacity, served as a delegate to the Convention in charge of drafting the European Constitution (February 2002 – July 2003).

== The People of Freedom ==
In September 2007, a month before Democracy is Freedom – The Daisy merged with the Democrats of the Left to form the new big tent centre-left Democratic Party, Dini broke away from The Daisy to form the Liberal Democrats, a new incarnation of Italian Renewal.
As the protagonist of the defeat of the government of Prime Minister Romano Prodi in a January 2008 Senate vote, in view of the 2008 Italian general election Dini joined The People of Freedom, the newly created Italian liberal-conservative party led by Silvio Berlusconi.

==Honours==
In 2000 during a state visit to the United Kingdom he was awarded an honorary Knighthood Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George. On 29 April 2009, the Japanese government announced that it awarded Dini the Grand Cordon of the Order of the Rising Sun; the honour was presented to him by the Emperor and the Japanese prime minister in a formal ceremony in May 2009.

=== Foreign honours ===
* Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Most Distinguished Order of St Michael and St George (2000).

<text>A miniature (from the Latin verb &#x27;to colour with minium&#x27;, a red lead) is a small illustration used to decorate an ancient or medieval illuminated manuscript; the simple illustrations of the early codices having been miniated or delineated with that pigment. The generally small scale of such medieval pictures has led to etymological confusion with minuteness and to its application to small paintings, especially portrait miniatures, which did however grow from the same tradition and at least initially used similar techniques.

Apart from the Western, Byzantine and Armenian traditions, there is another group of Asian traditions, which is generally more illustrative in nature, and from origins in manuscript book decoration also developed into single-sheet small paintings to be kept in albums, which are also called miniatures, as the Western equivalents in watercolor and other media are not. These include Arabic miniatures, and their Persian, Mughal, Ottoman and other Indian offshoots.

==Christian traditions==
===Italy and Byzantium, 3rd–6th centuries===

The earliest extant miniatures are a series of uncolored pen drawings in the &quot;Chronograph of 354&quot;, which was lost after the Renaissance, but is known from copies. Fragments of some heavily illustrated luxury manuscripts from before about 450 have survived to the modern day. The Cotton Genesis was mostly destroyed by fire in London in 1731 and the Quedlinburg Itala fragment mostly destroyed in the Middle Ages, the vellum used in bookbindings. 

There are also colored miniatures cut from the Ambrosian Iliad, an illustrated manuscript of the &quot;Iliad&quot; from the 5th century. In these pictures there is a considerable variety in the quality of the drawing, but there are many notable instances of fine figure-drawing, quite classical in sentiment, showing that the earlier art still exercised its influence. Such indications, too, of landscape as are to be found are of the classical type, not conventional in the sense of medieval conventionalism, but still attempting to follow nature, even if in an imperfect fashion; just as in the Pompeian and other frescoes of the Roman age.

Of even greater value from an artistic point of view are the miniatures of the Vatican manuscript of Virgil, known as the Vergilius Vaticanus, of the early 5th century. They are in a more perfect condition and on a larger scale than the Ambrosian fragments, and they therefore offer better opportunity for examining method and technique. The drawing is quite classical in style, and the idea is conveyed that the miniatures are direct copies from an older series. The colors are opaque: indeed, in all the miniatures of early manuscripts the employment of body color was universal. The method followed in placing the different scenes on the page is highly instructive of the practice followed, as we may presume, by the artists of the early centuries. It seems that the background of the scene was first painted in full, covering the whole surface of the page; then, over this background were painted the larger figures and objects; and over these again the smaller details in front of them were superimposed. (The painter&#x27;s algorithm.) Again, for the purpose of securing something like perspective, an arrangement of horizontal zones was adopted, the upper ones containing figures on a smaller scale than those below.
It was reserved for the Byzantine school to break away more decidedly from the natural presentment of things and to develop artistic conventions. Yet in the best early examples of this school the classical sentiment still lingers, as the relics of the miniatures of the Cotton Genesis, and the best of the miniatures of the Vienna Dioscurides testify; and in the miniatures of the later Byzantine manuscripts, which were copied from earlier examples, the reproduction of the models is faithful. But on comparing the miniatures of the Byzantine school generally with their classical predecessors, one has a sense of having passed from the open air into the cloister. Under the restraint of ecclesiastical domination Byzantine art became more and more stereotyped and conventional. The tendency grows to paint the flesh-tints in swarthy hues, to elongate and emaciate the limbs, and to stiffen the gait. Browns, blue-greys and neutral tints are in favor. Here we first find the technical treatment of flesh-painting which afterwards became the special practice of Italian miniaturists, namely the laying on of the actual flesh-tints over a ground of olive, green or other dark hue. Landscape, such as it was, soon became quite conventional, setting the example for that remarkable absence of the true representation of nature which is such a striking attribute of the miniatures of the Middle Ages.

And yet, while the ascetic treatment of the miniatures obtained so strongly in Byzantine art, at the same time the Oriental sense of splendour shows itself in the brilliancy of much of the coloring and in the lavish employment of gold. In the miniatures of Byzantine manuscripts are first seen those backgrounds of bright gold which afterwards appear in such profusion in the productions of every western school of painting.

The influence of Byzantine art on that of medieval Italy is obvious. The early mosaics in the churches of Italy, such as those at Ravenna and Venice, also afford examples of the dominating Byzantine influence. But the early Middle Ages provide but few landmarks to guide the student; and it is only when he emerges into the 12th century, with its frescoes and miniatures still bearing the impress of the Byzantine tradition, that he can be satisfied that the connection has always existed during the intervening centuries.

===Armenian miniatures===


Armenian miniature painting stands out with its variety of styles and schools. When in 405 Mesrop Mashtots created the Armenian letters, Armenian manuscripts appeared, and Armenian miniature painting developed together with it. Most of the 25,000 Armenian manuscripts from different centuries are decorated with miniatures.

Books with religious content were mostly decorated, however, the miniature artists, or &quot;flourishers&quot;, as they were called at the time, were able to express their emotions and feelings and to reflect real life scenes through religious themes. Especially in capital letters at the beginning of the text, in the ornaments placed before the title or in the pictures made in the margins, in the beautifully decorated letters, they introduced various images and elements of flora and fauna.

In Armenian miniatures one can find scenes depicting hunting, animal fighting, theatrical performances, other scenes of urban and rural life, portraits of famous figures of the time, commissioners of manuscripts. Such miniatures are of great importance for the study of the life and lifestyle of medieval Armenia, costumes, manners, crafts, Armenian nature. Some miniature painters also left their self-portraits.

Many miniature painting centers operated in Armenia at different times. There are well-known centers, such as those of Ani, Gladzor, Tatev, Nakhichevan, Artsakh, Vaspurakan, each of which, in addition to the general features typical of national art, is characterized by a unique style of miniature painting and local traditions. Later miniature painting centers were established in Armenian colonies as well.

Armenian miniature art flourished in the 13th century, especially in Cilician Armenia, where the miniatures were more luxurious and elegant. Works of such talented miniature artists of different times and centers as Toros Roslin, Grigor, Ignatius, Sargis Pitsak, Toros Taronetsi, Avag, Momik, Simeon Archishetsi, Vardan Artsketsi, Kirakos, Hovhannes, Hakob Jughayetsi and may more have weathered the march of times up to now. Yet names of many other miniature artists have not been preserved.

Armenian miniature painting has gone through long and difficult historical paths; it is a witness of Armenian&#x27;s unparalleled creative zeal, which neither the countless disasters brought by foreign invaders, nor the difficult and torturous migration routes were able to extinguish. With its originality, mastery of performance, extraordinary color, richness and variety of jewelry, it occupies a unique and honorable place not only in the treasury of national art, but also in the world art.

The Gospels were the most illustrated, followed by the Bible and other religious collections. The first miniatures that have reached us are samples of the 6th-7th centuries. The types of characters and painting in them are reminiscent of the frescoes of Lmbat and Aruch from the 7th century. The &quot;Gospel of Queen Mlke&quot;, &quot;The Gospel of Kars&quot;, &quot;The Gospel of Trabzon&quot; have survived from the period of the kingdoms of Bagratuni and Artsruni. These manuscripts contain the main features of the further development of Armenian miniature painting:
• columnar tabernacles,
• gold leaflets with capital letters,
• Lord&#x27;s pictures, that is the events of Christ&#x27;s life, which are mentioned in the church holidays,
• miniatures attached to the text.
An organic combination of Byzantine and all-Christian art can be found in them, in the depictions of arches of the tabernacles of the &quot;Gospel of Queen Mlke&quot;, Egyptian motifs, architectural decor of evangelical paintings, and elements of Hellenistic art.

Larger miniatures of the Gospels of Lesser Armenia related to Early Christian miniature art in 1038 (Matenadaran after Mesrop Mashtots, Yerevan, manuscript N 6201), preserving old stylistic and pictorial rules, contain novelties that formed the basis of all subsequent Armenian iconography, for example, the depiction of the naked Christ on the cross. The graphic development of the style of the group of manuscripts is obvious in Vaspurakan School of Miniature Painting.
A group of manuscripts from the late 11th century, led by the Gospel of Moghni, formed the school of Ani the stylistic forms of which bear similarities with the pre-Gothic miniatures, which show the eastern origins of the latter. The miniatures of that group stand out in the monumental-fresco style. In the manuscripts of the 12th century, the traditions of miniature art of the 10th-11th centuries were developed, endowed with tragic-emotional accents, and a great importance was paid to plant-animal motifs.
In the first half of the 13th century, before the Mongol invasions, miniature painting flourished in Greater Armenia (&quot;Gospel of Haghpat&quot;, &quot;Gospel of Translators&quot;). Miniature painting received an unprecedented new quality in Cilician Armenia. Exquisite manuscripts were collected both in the monasteries and in the royal court, and in addition to the clergy, manuscripts were ordered by members of the royal court and the councilors.

The ritual-church significance of the manuscripts diminished, they were often ordered for personal use, to satisfy the refined taste of the councilors ad their religious feelings. The size of the books decreased, the miniature painters turned more to the depiction of reality and of the neighboring countries (Byzantium և European countries). Famous miniature painters Grigor Mlichetsi, Toros Roslin, Sargis Pitsak and others appeared creating elegant royal manuscripts (&quot;King Hetum II&#x27;s dinner&quot;, &quot;Gospel of Queen Keran&quot;).
A relatively stable political situation in some regions of Greater Armenia contributed to the development of miniature painting. While the representatives of the Gladzor School of Miniature Painting stand out with stressed personalities, the artists of Vaspurakan (Simeon Artchishetsi, Zakaria Akhtamartsi, Rstakes, Kirakos Aghbaketsi and others) moved back to more unified painting traditions. The famous center of miniature painting was the Tatev School of Miniature Painting headed by Grigor Tatevatsi, after whom Armenian miniature art was continued in the colonies of the Crimea, New Julfa, Constantinople and elsewhere. In the 17th-18th centuries, Armenian book miniature painting gradually gave way to the printing art of book illustration.

===Europe, 8th–12th centuries===
In the native schools of illumination of Western Europe, decoration only was the leading motive. In the manuscripts of the Merovingian period, in the school which connected Frankland and northern Italy, and which is known as Lombardic or Franco-Lombardic, in the manuscripts of Spain, in the productions of the Insular art of the British Isles, figure-drawing was scarcely known, serving rather as a feature of decoration than as a representation of the human form.

The Anglo-Saxon school, developed especially at Canterbury and Winchester, which probably derived its characteristic free-hand drawing from classical Roman models, scarcely influenced by the Byzantine element. The highest qualities of the miniatures of the 10th and 11th century of this school lie in fine outline drawing, which had a lasting influence on the English miniature of the later centuries. But the southern Anglo-Saxon school rather stands apart from the general line of development of the western medieval miniature.

Under the Carolingian monarchs there developed a school of painting derived from classical models, chiefly of the Byzantine type. In this school, which owed its origin to the encouragement of Charlemagne, it is seen that the miniature appears in two forms. First, there is the truly conventional miniature following the Byzantine model, the subjects being generally the portraits of the Four Evangelists, or portraits of the emperors themselves: the figures formal; the pages brilliantly colored and gilded, generally set in architectural surroundings of a fixed type, and devoid of landscape in the real sense of the word. Accompanied as it was with profuse decoration in border and initial, it set the pattern for the later Continental schools of the West. On the other hand, there is also the miniature in which there is an attempt at illustration, as, for example, the depicting of scenes from the Bible. Here there is more freedom; and we trace the classical style which copies Roman, as distinguished from Byzantine, models. 
Under the subsequent Ottonian monarchs in East Francia, the early Ottonian manuscripts are still clearly in the Carolingian tradition. Like these, they are based on a programmatic reference to the ancient tradition, so that this era is referred to as the &quot;Ottonian Renaissance&quot;, based on the &quot;Carolingian Renaissance&quot;. Nevertheless, ancient naturalism and illusionism, which had been adapted in some manuscripts during the Carolingian period, were now completely sacrificed to a stylized formal language. The most important links between Carolingian and Ottonian illumination were the Abbey of St. Gall, the Abbey of Fulda (Codex Wittekindeus) and the Abbey of Corvey. There no longer seems to have been a court school like in Carolingian times. The most important art centers at the time of Otto the Great were Cologne, where a distinctive painterly style with Byzantine influence developed (for example with Hitda Codex), Trier, Regensburg and, above all, Reichenau Abbey (for example with Gero Codex, Petershausen Sacramentary, Codex Egberti or Egbert Psalter). In addition, scriptoria were active in Mainz, Prüm Abbey, the Abbey of Echternach (with the Golden Gospels of Henry III) and elsewhere. In the 11th century, the scriptoria of Tegernsee Abbey, Niederaltaich Abbey, Freising and Salzburg emerged in the Bavarian-Austrian region. From around 990 to 1020, Ottonian illumination reached its peak with the works of the Liuthar group, which were probably created in the Reichenau Island monasteries, including the Liuthar Gospels, the Gospels of Otto III, the Pericopes of Henry II and the Bamberg Apocalypse. Throughout the Ottonian period, the image of the evangelist was a central motif; the image of the ruler, which served to represent the clients&#x27; self-portrayal - often in the form of a dedication image - and the Majestas Domini stand out. The dominant stylistic elements are symmetrical, flat representations with a monumental character. Many of the Ottonian illustrations are full-page, sometimes divided into two panels. Large, overly long and expressive figures with ecstatic, suggestive sign language and the courage to use empty, monochrome surfaces - mostly gold backgrounds - characterize the style of these manuscripts, which strongly influenced Expressionism in the 20th century. The illustrations completely lack spatial depth.

The influence which the Carolingian school exercised on the miniatures of the southern Anglo-Saxon artists shows itself in the extended use of body-color and in the more elaborate employment of gold in the decoration. Such a manuscript as the Benedictional of St. Æthelwold, bishop of Winchester, 963 to 984, with its series of miniatures drawn in the native style but painted in opaque pigments, exhibits the influence of the foreign art. But the actual drawing remained essentially national, marked by its own treatment of the human figure and by the disposition of the drapery with fluttering folds. The style was refined, tending to exaggeration and disproportion of the limbs. With the Norman Conquest this remarkable native school died.

With the awakening of art in the 12th century the decoration of manuscripts received a powerful impulse. The artists of the time excelled in the border and the initial, but in the miniature also there was vigorous drawing, with bold sweeping lines and careful study of the draperies. The artists grew more practiced in figure-drawing, and while there was still the tendency to repeat the same subjects in the same conventional manner, individual effort produced in this century many miniatures of a very noble character.

The Norman Conquest had brought England directly within the fold of Continental art; and now began that grouping of the French and the English and the Flemish schools, which, fostered by growing intercourse and moved by common impulses, resulted in the magnificent productions of the illuminators of north-western Europe from the latter part of the 12th century onwards.

But of natural landscape there is nothing, unless rocks and trees of a stereotyped character can be so regarded. Hence the background of the miniature of the 12th and immediately succeeding centuries became the field for decoration to throw into stronger relief the figures in the scene. And thus arose the practice of filling in the entire space with a sheet of gold, often burnished: a brilliant method of ornament which we have already seen practiced in the Byzantine school. We have also to notice the conventional treatment of the sacred figures, which continue henceforward, from a sense of veneration, to be clad in the traditional robes of the early centuries, while the other figures of the scene wear the ordinary dress of the period.

===Europe, 13th–15th centuries===

Entering the 13th century, we reach the period when the miniature may be said to justify the modern false etymology which has connected the title with minuteness. The broad, bold style of the 12th century gives place to the precise and minute. Books in general exchanged their form from the large folio to the octavo and smaller sizes. There was a greater demand for books; and vellum was limited in quantity and had to go further. Handwriting grew smaller and lost the roundness of the 12th century. Contractions and abbreviations in the texts largely increased in number. Everywhere there is an effort to save space. And so with the miniature. Figures were small, with delicate strokes in the features and with neat slim bodies and limbs. The backgrounds blaze with color and burnished gold; and delicate diaper patterns of alternate gold and color abound. Frequently, and especially in English manuscripts, the drawings are merely tinted or washed with transparent colors. In this century, too, the miniature invades the initial. Whereas in the earlier periods bold flowering scrolls are the fashion, now a little scene is introduced into the blank spaces of the letter.

To compare the work of the three schools, the drawing of the English miniature, at its best, is perhaps the most graceful; the French is the neatest and the most accurate; the Flemish, including that of western Germany, is less refined and in harder and stronger lines. As to colors, the English artist affects rather lighter tints than those of the other schools: a partiality is to be observed for light green, for grey-blue, and for lake. The French artist loved deeper shades, especially ultramarine. The Fleming and the German painted, as a rule, in less pure colors and inclined to heaviness. A noticeable feature in French manuscripts is the red or copper-hued gold used in their illuminations, in strong contrast to the paler metal of England and the Low Countries.
It is remarkable how the art of the miniature throughout the 13th century maintains its high quality both in drawing and color without any very striking change. Throughout the century the Bible and the Psalter were in favor; and naturally the same subjects and the same scenes ran through the period and were repeated by artist after artist; and the very character of those sacred books would tend to restrain innovation. But towards the close of the period such secular works as the romances were growing in popularity, and afforded a wider field for the invention of the illustrating artist. Therefore, with the opening of the 14th century a palpable change of style supervenes. We pass to more flowing lines; not to the bold sweeping strokes and curves of the 12th century, but to a graceful, delicate, yielding style which produced the beautiful swaying figures of the period. In fact the miniature now begins to free itself from the role of an integral member of the decorative scheme of illumination and to develop into the picture, depending on its own artistic merit for the position it is to hold in the future. This is shown by the more prominent place that the miniature now assumes, and by its growing independence of the decorative border and initial.

But, at the same time, while the miniature of the 14th century thus strives to dissociate itself from the rest of the illuminated details of the manuscript, within itself it flourishes in decoration. Besides the greater elasticity of the figuredrawing, there is a parallel development in the designs of the backgrounds. The diapers become more elaborate and more brilliant; the beauty of the burnished gold is enhanced by the stippled patterns which are frequently worked upon it; the gothic canopies and other architectural features which it became the practice to introduce naturally followed the development of the architecture of the period. In a word, the great expansion of artistic sentiment in decoration of the best type, which is so prominent in the higher work of the 14th century, is equally conspicuous in the illuminated miniature.

In the early part of the century, English drawing is very graceful, the figures bending with a waving movement which, if they were not so simple, would be an affectation. Both in the outline specimens, washed with transparent color, and in the fully. painted examples, the best English work of this time is unsurpassed. French art still maintains its neat precision, the colors more vivid than those of England and the faces delicately indicated without much modelling. The productions of the Low Countries, still keeping to the heavier style of drawing, appear coarse beside the works of the other schools. Nor does German miniature art of this period hold a high position, being generally mechanical and of a rustic character. As time advances the French miniature almost monopolizes the field, excelling in brilliancy of coloring, but losing much of its purity of drawing although the general standard still remains high. The English school gradually retrogrades and, owing no doubt to political causes and to the wars with France, appears to have produced no work of much value. It is only towards the end of the 14th century that there is a revival.

This revival has been attributed to a connection with the flourishing school of Prague, a school which in the scheme of coloring suggests a southern influence following on the marriage of Richard II with Anne of Bohemia in 1382. The new style of English miniature painting is distinguished by richness of color, and by the careful modelling of the faces, which compares favorably with the slighter treatment by the contemporary French artists. Similar attention to the features also marks the northern Flemish or Dutch school at this period and in the early 15th century; and it may therefore be regarded as an attribute of Germanic art as distinguished from the French style.

The promise of the new development in English miniature painting, however, was not to be fulfilled. In the first quarter of the 15th century, examples of great merit were produced, but at a standstill in drawing and fettered by medieval convention. The native art practically came to a close about the middle of the century, just when the better appreciation of nature was breaking down the old conventional representation of landscape in European art, and was transforming the miniature into the modern picture. Whatever miniature painting was to be produced in England after that time was to be the work of foreign artists or of artists imitating a foreign style. The condition of the country during the Wars of the Roses sufficiently accounts for the abandonment of art. Thus the history of the miniature in the 15th century must be sought in the manuscripts of the Continental schools.

First we have to consider northern France and the Low Countries. As it passes out of the 14th and enters the 15th century, the miniature of both schools begins to exhibit greater freedom in composition; and there is a further tendency to aim rather at general effect by the coloring than neatness in drawing. This was encouraged by the wider field opened to the miniaturist. Books of all kinds were illustrated, and sacred books, Bibles and Psalters and liturgical books, were no longer the chief, if not the only, manuscripts which were illuminated. And yet there was one class of manuscript which came into the greatest prominence and which was at the same time liturgical. This was the &quot;Horae&quot;, or Book of Hours, devotional books for individual use, which were multiplied in vast numbers and contained some of the finest work of the miniaturists. The decoration of these little volumes escaped in great measure from the conventional restraints which their religious character might have imposed. Furthermore, the demand for illuminated manuscripts had by this time established a regular trade; and their production was not confined, as formerly, to the cloister. Notable secular illuminated manuscript artists include Master Honoré of the Parisian school.
Early in the century the old conventional treatment of landscape still held its own; nor did the diapered and gilded background pass out of use. Indeed, in some of the finest French specimens of the time the diapered patterns are more brilliant than ever. But natural scenery in the second quarter of the century asserts itself more decidedly, although with faults in perspective. It was not until another generation had arisen that there was a true appreciation of the horizon and of atmospheric effect.

The miniatures of the French and Flemish schools run fairly parallel for a time, but after the middle of the century national characteristics become more marked and divergent. The French miniature began to deteriorate, though some very fine examples were produced by the more gifted artists of the school. The figure-drawing was more careless, and the painting tended to hardness without depth, which the artist endeavoured to relieve by an excess of gilt shading.

The Flemish school in the latter part of the 15th century attained to its highest excellence. The Flemish miniature affected extreme softness and depth of color; also an ever-increasing carefulness in the treatment of details, of the draperies, of the expression of the features: the Flemish type of the Virgin&#x27;s face, for example, with its full, high forehead, can never be mistaken. In the best Flemish miniatures of the period the artist succeeds in presenting a wonderful softness and glow of color; nor did the high standard cease with the 15th century, for many excellent specimens still remain to attest the favor in which it was held for a few decades longer.

In the foregoing remarks what has been said in regard to the careful treatment of details applies still more to the miniatures executed in grisaille, in which the absence of color invited an even stronger accentuation of that treatment. This is perhaps most observable in the grisaille miniatures of northern Flanders, which often suggest, particularly in the strong angular lines of the draperies, a connection with the art of the wood engraver.

===Italy, 13th–15th centuries===
The Flemish miniature did not, however, hold the favor of western Europe without a rival. That rival had arisen in the south, and had come to perfection concurrently with the miniature of the Low Countries in the 15th century. This was the Italian miniature, which passed through the same stages as the miniatures of England and France and the Low Countries. Intercommunication between the countries of Europe was too well established for the case to be otherwise. In Italian manuscripts of the normal type the influence of Byzantine art is very manifest during the 13th and 14th centuries. The old system of painting the flesh tints upon olive green or some similar pigment, which is left exposed on the lines of the features, thus obtaining a swarthy complexion, continued to be practiced in a more or less modified form into the 15th century. As a rule, the pigments used are more opaque than those employed in the northern schools; and the artist trusted more to color alone to obtain the desired effect than to the mixture of color and gold which gave such brilliant results in the diapered patterns of France. The vivid scarlet of the Italian miniaturists is peculiarly their own. The figure-drawing is less realistic than the contemporary art of English and French manuscripts, the human form being often thick-set. In general, the Italian miniature, before its great expansion in the 14th century, is far behind the miniatures of the north. But with the 15th century, under the influence of the Renaissance, it advanced into the front rank and rivalled the best work of the Flemish school. The use of thicker pigments enabled the miniaturist to obtain the hard and polished surface so characteristic of his work, and to maintain sharpness of outline, without losing the depth and richness of color which compare with the same qualities in the Flemish school.

The Italian style was followed in the manuscripts of Provence in the 14th and 15th centuries. It had its effect, too, on the school of northern France, by which it was also influenced in turn. In the manuscripts of southern Germany it is also in evidence. But the principles which have been reviewed as guiding the development of the miniature in the more important schools apply equally to all. Like the miniature of the Flemish school, the Italian miniature was still worked to some extent with success, under special patronage, even in the 16th century; but with the rapid displacement of the manuscript by the printed book the miniaturist&#x27;s occupation was brought to a close.

==Other traditions==
Despite Islam&#x27;s objections to figurative art, Persia and the Persianate world continued what seems to have been a pre-existing tradition of book illustration, while the figurative Arabic miniature was relatively uncommon, other than figures in practical images such as diagrams. However, in Islamic art luxury manuscripts, including those of the Quran (which was never illustrated with figurative images) were often decorated with highly elaborate designs of geometric patterns, arabesques and other elements, sometimes as border to text. This is known as &quot;illumination&quot;.
===Arabic tradition===

Arabic miniatures (Arabic: الْمُنَمْنَمَات الْعَرَبِيَّة, &quot;Al-Munamnamāt al-ʿArabīyah&quot;) are small paintings on paper, usually book or manuscript illustrations but also sometimes separate artworks that occupy entire pages. The earliest example dates from around 690 AD, with a flourishing of the art from between 1000 and 1200 AD in the Abbasid caliphate. The art form went through several stages of evolution while witnessing the fall and rise of several Islamic caliphates. Arab miniaturists absorbed Chinese and Persian influences brought by the Mongol destructions, and at last, got totally assimilated and subsequently disappeared due to the Ottoman occupation of the Arab world. Nearly all forms of Islamic miniatures (Persian miniatures, Ottoman miniatures and Mughal miniatures) owe their existences to Arabic miniatures, as Arab patrons were the first to demand the production of illuminated manuscripts in the Caliphate, it wasn&#x27;t until the 14th century that the artistic skill reached the non-Arab regions of the Caliphate.

Despite the considerable changes in Arabic miniature style and technique, even during their last decades, the early Umayyad Arab influence could still be noticed. Arabic miniature artists include Ismail al-Jazari, who illustrated his own &quot;Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices,&quot; and the Abbasid artist, Yahya Al-Wasiti, who probably lived in Baghdad in the late Abbasid era (12th to 13th-centuries), was one of the pre-eminent exponents of the Baghdad school. In 1236-1237, he is known to have transcribed and illustrated the book, &quot;Maqamat&quot; (also known as the &quot;Assemblies&quot; or the &quot;Sessions&quot;), a series of anecdotes of social satire written by Al-Hariri of Basra. The narrative concerns the travels of a middle-aged man as he uses his charm and eloquence to swindle his way across the Arabic world.

With most surviving Arabic manuscripts in western museums, Arabic miniatures occupy very little space in modern Arab culture.

===Persian===

Persian art has a long tradition of the use of miniatures, both for illustrated books and individual pieces, which were collected in albums (&quot;muraqqa&quot;). The Mughal miniature tradition was heavily influenced by Persia, and began when a group of artists was recruited for India, miniatures having fallen into disfavour in the Persian court of Tahmasp I. Reza Abbasi (1565–1635), considered one of the most renowned Persian painters of all time, specialized in the Persian miniature, with a preference for naturalistic subjects. Today his surviving works can be found in many of the major museums of the Western world, such as the Smithsonian, the Louvre and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

In 2020, UNESCO declared the miniature art of Azerbaijan, Iran, Turkey and Uzbekistan as one of the masterpieces of the intangible cultural heritage of humanity.

===India===
Under the patronage of Pala Dynasty miniature painting was introduced in India by painting on Buddhist palm leaf manuscripts. One of the earliest surviving examples of Buddhist illustrated palm leaf manuscripts is Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā dated to 985 AD preserved in the University of Cambridge library. The art of Pala illuminated manuscripts developed in Buddhist centers of Bihar and Bengal. The Pala miniature paintings not only inspired Nepalese and Tibetan miniature paintings but also inspired Hinduism and Jainism to develop their own miniature painting traditions in later periods.

Mughal painting developed during the period of the Mughal Empire (16th - 18th centuries) and was generally confined to miniatures either as book illustrations or as single works to be kept in albums. It emerged from the Persian miniature painting tradition introduced to India by Mir Sayyid Ali and Abd al-Samad in the mid 16th century. It soon moved away from its Safavid origins; with the influence of Hindu artists, colors became brighter and compositions more naturalistic. The subject matter was predominantly secular, mainly consisting of illustrations to works of literature or history, portraits of court members and studies of nature. At its height the Mughal painting style represented an elegant marriage of Persian, European, and Hindi art.

In the Muslim Deccan sultanates miniature painting styles emerged with influence direct from Persia, and with some from existing Hindu painting. The Deccan painting style was freer and more extravagant than Mughal painting, if not as consistent in quality or naturalism. As the Mughals conquered the sultanates over the 17th century, the artists dispersed. A version of the Mughal style spread to princely courts, mostly Hindu, in North India, especially in Rajput painting, where several different styles developed. Pahari painting covers a number of small courts in the foothills of the Himalayas, and the Bikaner style came from further south. By the 18th century the Rajput courts were producing the most innovative Indian painting.

===Ottoman Empire===

The tradition of the Ottoman Empire began under Persian influence, and Persian miniatures were keenly collected by the Sultans. A distinctive Ottoman style soon developed, with a greater interest in narrative, and recording the history of the empire. Ottoman illumination was also extensively used on court manuscripts. 

=== Armenian illuminated manuscripts ===
Armenian miniature is notable for its variety of styles and schools. When Mesrop Mashtots created Armenian letters in 405, and Armenian handwritten books began to be written, together with education, Armenian illuminated miniature developed. Most of the 25,000 Armenian manuscripts handed down to us from different centuries are decorated with miniatures. Armenian illuminated manuscripts embody Armenian culture; they illustrate its spiritual and cultural values. The most famous Armenian miniaturist is Toros Roslin, who lived in 13th century. The art form flourished in Greater Armenia, Lesser Armenia and the Armenian Diaspora.Very few fragments of illuminated manuscripts from the 6th and 7th centuries have survived. The oldest fully preserved manuscript dates from the 9th century.

==Forgeries==
Miniatures are forged for various reasons. Forged Islamic miniatures depicting scientific advancements are made by Turkish artisans as souvenirs, and can often be found innocuously as stock photos on the Internet or within formal learning materials. Medieval European miniatures also have been forged to deceive collectors by various persons, one of the most notable forgers being the Spanish Forger.

<text>Francisco Ramírez Medina (born c.1828), was one of the leaders of &quot;El Grito de Lares&quot;, the first major revolt against Spanish rule and call for independence in Puerto Rico in 1868. He has thus far been the only person to be named &quot;President of the Republic of Puerto Rico&quot;.

==El Grito de Lares (The Lares Uprising)==
History has little to say about Ramírez Medina and his personal life; what is known however, is that he was a believer in the Puerto Rican independence movement. For years, various sectors in Puerto Rico had plans for claiming the independence of Puerto Rico from Spanish rule. Among those who planned for the island&#x27;s freedom was Puerto Rican General Antonio Valero de Bernabé, who upon learning of Simón Bolívar&#x27;s dream of liberating and creating a unified Latin America, which included Puerto Rico and Cuba, decided to join him and in St. Thomas established contacts with the Puerto Rican independence movement. However, it wasn&#x27;t until 1868 when a revolt was initially started and planned by Ramón Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis against the Government of Spain which then ruled the island. Manuel Rojas, Mariana Bracetti and Mathias Brugman joined them by forming revolutionary cells in the island. Ramírez Medina amongst others also joined the movement.

===Planning stage===
On September 20, Ramírez Medina held a meeting at his house in which the insurrection was planned and set to begin in Camuy on September 29. The meeting was attended by Marcelino Vega, Carlos Martínez, Bonifacio Agüero, José Antonio Hernández, Ramón Estrella, Bartolomé González, Cesilio López, Antonio Santiago, Manuel Ramírez, Ulises Cancela. Cancela instructed Manuel María González to deliver all of the acts and important papers in regard to the meeting to Manuel Rojas.

On the night of September 19 a Spanish captain stationed in Quebradillas, Juan Castañón, overheard two cell members commenting that on September 29 the troop at Camuy would be neutralized by poisoning the bread rations. Given the fact that September 29 would be a holiday for most laborers, simultaneous uprisings would occur, beginning with the cell in Camuy, and following with the ones in various other points; reinforcements would come in through a ship, &quot;El Telégrafo&quot;, and the cells would be reinforced by more than 3,000 mercenaries. Castañón and his men then entered González&#x27;s residence and confiscated the documents of Medina&#x27;s meeting and alerted his commanding officer in Arecibo. The cell leaders at the &quot;Lanzador del Norte&quot; cell in Camuy were soon arrested. The rebels decided to move up the date of the revolution after the authorities on the island discovered the plan.

==Declaration of Independence==

It was then agreed to first strike at the town of Lares on September 24. Some 400–600 rebels gathered on that day in the hacienda of Manuel Rojas, located in the vicinity of Peñuelas, on the outskirts of Lares. Poorly trained and armed, the rebels reached the town by horse and foot around midnight. They looted local stores and offices owned by &quot;peninsulares&quot; (Spanish-born men) and took over the city hall. Spanish merchants and local government authorities, considered by the rebels to be enemies of the fatherland, were taken as prisoners. The revolutionaries then entered the town&#x27;s church and placed the revolutionary flag, the first Puerto Rican flag, knitted by Bracetti with the materials provided by Eduvigis Beauchamp Sterling, Treasurer of the revolution, on the High Altar. The flag was divided in the middle by a white Latin cross, the two lower corners were red and the two upper corners were blue. A white star was placed in the upper left blue corner. According to Puerto Rican poet Luis Lloréns Torres the white cross on it stand for the yearning for homeland redemption; the red squares, the blood poured by the heroes of the rebellion and the white star in the blue solitude square, stands for liberty and freedom. By placing the flag on the High Altar, the revolutionists were giving a sign that the revolution had begun. This event became known as &quot;El Grito de Lares&quot;, Puerto Rico&#x27;s call for independence. After this victory, Rojas and his men declared Puerto Rico a free Republic. The Republic of Puerto Rico was proclaimed at (2:00 am local time) under the presidency of Ramírez Medina at the church. President Ramírez Medina appointed Government officials as follows:

*Francisco Ramírez Medina, President
*Aurelio Méndez, Minister of the Interior
*Manuel Ramírez, Minister of State
*Celedonio Abril, Minister of the Treasury
*Federico Valencia, Minister of War
*Clemente Millán, Minister of Justice
*Bernabé Poll, Secretary to the President
*Manuel Rojas, Commander in Chief of the Liberation Army

As the President of provisional government of the Republic of Puerto Rico, Ramírez Medina first official act was the proclamation of the abolition of the &quot;Libreta&quot; system. The &quot;Libreta&quot; system, required that every worker carry on his person a notebook which stated the type of job the person does and who he works for. Anyone who was able to work and did not carry a &quot;Libreta&quot; (notebook or journal) was subject to imprisonment. He also ordered the liberation of all the slaves who joined the struggle or were prevented from doing so, and he urged his countrymen to do their duty and liberate Puerto Rico.

==Confrontation at San Sebastián==

The rebel forces then departed to take over the next town, San Sebastián del Pepino. The Spanish militia, however, surprised the group with strong resistance, causing great confusion among the armed rebels who, led by Manuel Rojas, retreated back to Lares. Upon an order from the governor, Julián Pavía, the Spanish militia soon rounded up the rebels. All of the survivors were imprisoned in Arecibo. Francisco Ramírez Medina was among the captured and may have been executed for treason. His exact fate, however is unknown.

==Legacy==
On November 16, 1930, the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party issued bonds in the name of the &quot;Republic of Puerto Rico&quot; bearing the photograph of Dr. Ramírez &quot;First President of the Republic&quot;. There&#x27;s a street in Hato Rey, Puerto Rico called &quot;Calle Presidente Ramírez&quot; (lit. &quot;President Ramírez Street&quot;) in his honor. In addition it makes recognition of Ramírez Medina with a character in the play entitled &quot;El Grito de Lares ... un momento en la historia.&quot; This work was written and has been run by the same author, Gerardo Lugo Segarra better known by his stage name as Jerry Segarra. The play was premiered on September 22, 2009 and since then uses the actual scenarios where they developed the Grito de Lares as were the Revolution Square, City Hall, the temple of the Catholic Church and the streets around the Plaza in Lares, Puerto Rico.

<text>The Anchor Brewery was a brewery in Park Street, Southwark, London, England. Established in 1616, by the early nineteenth century it was the largest brewery in the world. From 1781 it was operated by Barclay Perkins &amp; Co, who in 1955 merged with the Courage Brewery, which already owned the nearby Anchor Brewhouse. The Park Street brewery was demolished in 1981.

== History ==

The brewery was established in 1616 by James Monger Sr. in Southwark, on land adjacent to the Globe Theatre. On his death, the brewery passed to his godson, James Monger Jr. James Child acquired the brewery after the younger Monger&#x27;s death in 1670, and owned it until his death in 1696. His son in law, Edmund Halsey, managed the business with James Child from 1693, and subsequently as sole proprietor until his death in 1729. The brewery was then purchased by Ralph Thrale, the brewery manager and a nephew of Halsey, for £30,000 in instalments over 11 years.

Barclay Perkins &amp; Co was founded in July 1781 after chief clerk John Perkins and Robert Barclay (of the banking family) acquired the Anchor Brewery from Henry Thrale&#x27;s widow, Hester for £135,000, to be paid over four years. They additionally paid her for permission to keep using the Thrale &amp; Co name until 1795. In 1782, 85,700 barrels were brewed.

By 1809 the venture had an annual output of 260,000 barrels, making it the largest brewery in the world. Between 1809 and 1853 the Anchor had the largest output of any brewery in London. The brewery produced exclusively porter until 1834, when it began to brew pale ale.
A fire at the brewery in May 1832, caused £40,000 worth of damage, destroying many buildings and resulting in considerable rebuilding of the site. The new brewery attracted considerable interest: visitors included the Prince of Wales, the German statesman Otto von Bismarck, Prince Louis-Napoléon Bonaparte, Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt, the Austrian general Julius Jacob von Haynau, who was attacked by draymen while touring the brewery in 1850, and the Italian nationalist Giuseppe Garibaldi in 1864.

In 1867, Barclay Perkins brewed 423,000 barrels.

Barclay Perkins was an early adopter of lager production in the UK, with the Anchor brewing lager from 1922.

In 1955, Barclay Perkins merged with rival London brewer Courage. Brewing continued at the Anchor site until the early 1970s. In 1981 the brewery buildings were demolished, although the former brewery tap, the Anchor Tavern, remains.

The brewery was well known for its Russian Imperial Stout, which continued to be brewed by Courage and later Scottish &amp; Newcastle until 1993.

The nearby Anchor Terrace was built in 1834, after the fire of 1832, for senior employees of the brewery and stands on top of William Shakespeare&#x27;s original Globe Theatre.

<doc id="928540" wikidata="Q1751979" url="?curid=928540" title="Radisson Hotels">
<text>Radisson Hotels is a multi-brand hotel chain with a worldwide presence. Its brands include several using the Radisson name, as well as other brands like Park Plaza Hotels &amp; Resorts and Country Inn &amp; Suites.

In June 2022, Radisson Hotel Group agreed to sell Radisson Hotels Americas (consisting of the Radisson franchise agreements, operations and intellectual property in the United States, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean) to Choice Hotels for $675 million. The deal closed on August 11, 2022. Radisson Hotel Group continues to own the brands in the rest of the world.

==History==
In 1907, Edna Dickerson came to Minneapolis, Minnesota, from Chicago to collect a substantial inheritance. Local business leaders persuaded her to build a hotel in the city, with Dickerson investing $1.5 million in the construction of the first Radisson hotel. It was planned as a high-end luxury hotel, designed in the French Renaissance architecture style, and constructed with &quot;the best in every line&quot; of paints, enamels, woodwork, and wood finishes, and named after the 17th-century French explorer, ranger and furrier Pierre-Esprit Radisson. The building was sixteen stories, making it the second-tallest building in Minneapolis at the time. As the opening neared, reports boasted of hand-carved walnut furnishings in guest rooms and Spanish leather chairs in the main lobby and banquet hall. The hotel opened on Wednesday, December 15, 1909, with many of the staff having been hired from large hotels on the Eastern seaboard, and being new to the city of Minneapolis. The opening was followed shortly thereafter by a charity ball for the city being held at the hotel. In an early hotel incident the following month, six waiters from New York were fired, allegedly &quot;because the Eastern waiters could not get accustomed to the Western ways&quot;, with three of them being thrown out &quot;into the street before they would leave&quot;.

Dickerson and her husband, attorney Simon Kruse, lived on the hotel&#x27;s thirteenth floor and managed the hotel, also opening a Radisson Inn on Christmas Lake, in the Minneapolis suburb of Excelsior. They remained for twenty-five years, until 1934, when the Radisson fell into the hands of a mortgage company. In the mid- and late-1940s, pianist Liberace &quot;gained national exposure through his performance contracts with the Statler and Radisson&quot; hotels. Another owner initiated a renovation of the hotel in the late 1940s. The Radisson was purchased in 1962 by the Carlson Company, and it began adding new locations, both through the purchase of existing hotels such as the Schimmel Hotels group and the Denver Hyatt House in 1968, and constructing new buildings in Bloomington, Minnesota, and Duluth, Minnesota. The chain had 14 locations by 1976, and 32 by 1984. The original Radisson in Minneapolis was demolished in 1982, with a new hotel being constructed in that city and beginning operations in 1987. Carlson expanded the chain into one of the top hotel corporations by 2013. On top of Radisson, Carlson also owned several other brands, such as Park Inn, Park Plaza (acquired in 2000), and Country Inns &amp; Suites (founded by Carlson in 1986).

The company&#x27;s headquarters, as well as the headquarters of the owner, Radisson Hospitality, Inc., were located in Minnetonka, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis, the city where the first Radisson Hotel was built. In the 1990s, American-Russian businessman Paul Tatum was murdered after a series of disagreements over the Radisson Hotel in Moscow.

On June 13, 2022, the Radisson Hotel Group agreed to sell Radisson Hotels Americas – consisting of the Radisson franchise agreements, operations and intellectual property in the United States, Canada, Latin America and the Caribbean – to Choice Hotels for $675 million.

In 2022, despite Russia&#x27;s ongoing invasion of Ukraine and the imposition of international sanctions, Radisson Hotel continues to operate 38 hotels in Russia. While the company has halted new investments and partnerships in the country, it maintains that its existing operations are owned by third parties and are crucial for supporting employees and local communities. This decision has drawn criticism, as many global brands have fully exited the Russian market in response to the war and Russia&#x27;s continued aggression against Ukraine.

<doc id="928546" wikidata="Q2981415" url="?curid=928546" title="Coddle">
<text>Coddle (sometimes Dublin coddle; ) is an Irish dish which is often made to use up leftovers. It most commonly consists of layers of roughly sliced pork sausages and rashers (thinly sliced, somewhat-fatty back bacon) with chunky potatoes, sliced onion, salt, pepper, and herbs. Traditionally, it can also include barley.

Coddle is particularly associated with Dublin, the capital of Ireland. It was reputedly a favourite dish of the writers Seán O&#x27;Casey and Jonathan Swift, and it appears in several references to Dublin, including the works of James Joyce.

The dish is braised in the stock produced by boiling the pieces of bacon and sausages. The dish is cooked in a pot with a well-fitting lid in order to steam the ingredients left uncovered by the broth. Sometimes raw sliced potato is added, but traditionally is eaten with bread. The only seasonings are usually salt, pepper, and occasionally parsley.

==Etymology==
The name comes from the verb &quot;coddle&quot;, meaning to cook food in water below boiling (see coddled egg), which in turn derives from &quot;caudle&quot;, which comes from the French term meaning ‘to boil gently, parboil or stew’.

== Significance in Irish popular culture ==
Because coddle is seen as particular to Dublin, and because of its unappetising appearance to those who have not seen it before, many Dubliners are defensive of the dish. As with other controversial national dishes such as casu martzu, escargot or hákarl, enthusiasts take the revulsion of the uninitiated as a point of pride—in particular, many coddle enthusiasts see browning the sausages as an unacceptable cop-out.

<doc id="928550" wikidata="Q3815190" url="?curid=928550" title="A Lost Lady">
<text>A Lost Lady is a 1923 novel by American writer Willa Cather. It tells the story of Marian Forrester and her husband, Captain Daniel Forrester, who live in the Western town of Sweet Water along the Transcontinental Railroad. Throughout the story, Marian—a wealthy married socialite—is pursued by a variety of suitors and her social decline mirrors the end of the American frontier. The work had a significant influence on F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s 1925 novel, &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;.

== Plot summary ==
Niel Herbert, a young man who grows up in Sweet Water, witnesses the slow decline of Marian Forrester, for whom he feels very deeply, and also of the West itself from the idealized age of noble pioneers to the age of capitalist exploitation.

== Major characters ==
* Niel Herbertthe main character who meets Mrs. Forrester as a young boy. He falls in love with what she represents and struggles to preserve his boyhood image of her. After watching her first have an affair with Frank Ellinger and later Ivy Peters, he finally leaves Sweet Water. Niel realizes by the end of the novel that his love of Marian was based on Captain Forrester&#x27;s idealization of her.
* Mrs. Marian Forrestera charming socialite and the wife of Captain Forrester. Niel falls in love with what she represents, and is dismayed to discover her affair with Frank Ellinger. After her husband&#x27;s death, she becomes the mistress of Ivy Peters who runs her estate. She eventually leaves the town and moves to California, dying before Niel ever sees her again.
* Captain Daniel Forresteran aging man of the Pioneer generation who made his fortune building track for the railroads in the old days. He is proud of his beautiful wife. The novel opens at a time when he has already been physically destroyed by a fall from a horse. After suffering two strokes he eventually dies, signifying the end of the pioneering era.
* Frank Ellingera muscular bachelor and businessman of the Gilded Age generation. Frank is Mrs. Forrester&#x27;s lover and visits her when the Captain is away from the house. He marries Constance Ogden.
* Ivy Petersa cocky and pretentious older boy of the Jazz Age generation who later becomes a lawyer. He becomes very wealthy and eventually succeeds in owning the Forrester estate.
* Constance Ogdenan envious Southern girl who is Niel&#x27;s age and who is envious of Marian&#x27;s beauty. She later marries Frank Ellinger.
* Judge PommeroyNiel&#x27;s uncle, he is a lawyer that falls on hard times much the way the Forresters do.
== Literary significance and criticism ==

The novel has a robust symbolic framework. Critical approaches have noted that the character of Marian Forrester symbolically embodies both the American Dream, as well as the gradual decline of the American West.

== Legacy and influence ==
The novel had an acknowledged influence on writer F. Scott Fitzgerald who borrowed many of its themes and elements. Marian Forrester, in particular, partly inspired his Daisy Buchanan character in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. Fitzgerald later wrote a letter to Cather apologizing for any unintentional plagiarism.

== Media adaptations ==
The first film version of the novel was created in 1924, adapted by Dorothy Farnum. Directed by Harry Beaumont, the film starred Irene Rich, Matt Moore, June Marlowe, and John Roche. It would also be adapted very loosely into a film of the same name in 1934 by Gene Markey, and starred Barbara Stanwyck as Marian Forrester. The film did not live up to the novel&#x27;s reputation and is generally regarded as mediocre. Cather was so displeased with the film that she forbade any further film or stage adaptations of her work.

<doc id="928554" wikidata="Q59930" url="?curid=928554" title="Hashim al-Atassi">
<text>Hashim al-Atassi (; 11 January 1875 – 5 December 1960) was a Syrian politician and statesman who served as the President of Syria on three occasions from 1936 to 1939, 1949 to 1951 and 1954 to 1955.

== Background and early career ==
He was born in Homs in 1875 to the large, landowning and politically active Atassi family. He studied public administration at the Mekteb-i Mülkiye in Istanbul, and graduated in 1893. He began his political career in 1888 in the Ottoman vilayet of Beirut, and through the years, up to 1918, served as Governor of Homs, Hama, Baalbek, Anatolia, and Jaffa, which included the then-small suburb of Tel Aviv. In 1919, after the defeat of Ottoman Turkey during World War I, he was elected chairman of the Syrian National Congress, the equivalent of a modern parliament. 

On 8 March 1920 that body declared independence as a constitutional monarchy, under King Faisal I. He became prime minister during this short-lived period, for French occupation soon followed under the terms of the Sykes-Picot Agreement and a League of Nations Mandate (Also see: San Remo conference). During his tenure, Atassi appointed the veteran independence activist and statesman Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar, one of the leaders of the Syrian nationalist movement against the Ottoman Empire during World War I, as Foreign Minister. He delegated Shahbandar to formulate alliances between Syria and Europe, in a vain attempt to prevent the implementation of a French Mandate. France moved quickly to reverse Syrian independence. 

The French High Commissioner Henri Gouraud presented Faisal with an ultimatum, demanding the surrender of Aleppo to the French Army, the dismantling of the Syrian Army, the adaptation of the French franc in Syria, and the dissolution of the Atassi Government. Shahbandar&#x27;s efforts to compromise with Gouraud proved futile, and Atassi&#x27;s cabinet was dissolved on 24 July 1920, when the French defeated the Syrian Army at the Battle of Maysalun and imposed their mandate over Syria.

== The French Mandate ==
After the dissolution of the Kingdom by the French, Atassi met with a group of notables in October 1927 and founded the National Bloc, which was to lead the Syrian nationalist movement in Syria for the next twenty years. The Bloc was a political coalition movement that sought full independence for Syria through diplomatic rather than violent resistance. It founders were a group of landowners, lawyers, civil servants, and Ottoman-trained professionals from Damascus, Aleppo, Homs, Hama, and Lattakia. Atassi was elected permanent President of the National Bloc. In 1928, he was also elected President of the Constituent Assembly, and charged with laying out Syria&#x27;s first republican constitution. The assembly was dissolved by the French high commissioner in May 1930 because of its adherence to the 1920 proclamation, and Atassi was imprisoned by the French for several months at Arwad Island. After being freed, he renominated himself for the presidency but lost the first round of elections and dropped out of the second, giving his endorsement to the independent Mohammad Ali al-Abid, who became president in the summer of 1932. In 1928 and 1932, he became a deputy for Homs in Parliament.

=== First President of the Republic ===
Atassi initially supported the Abid government but became disenchanted from the new President when Abid appointed two French stooges, Haqqi al-Azm as Prime Minister and Subhi Barakat as Speaker of Parliament. In 1934, Abid negotiated a treaty with France that promised gradual independence from the mandate but kept the Syrian Mountains under French control. Atassi severely criticized the treaty, arguing that no independence was valid unless it encompassed all of Syria&#x27;s territory. He called for a 60-day strike to protest Abid&#x27;s proposed treaty. The Bloc mobilized massive street-wide support for Atassi&#x27;s call, and most shops and enterprises closed down and riots raged daily, crippling the economy and embarrassing Abid before the international community.

In defeat, the French government agreed to recognize the National Bloc leaders as the sole representatives of the Syrian people and invited Hashim al-Atassi for diplomatic talks in Paris. On 22 March 1936, he headed a senior Bloc delegation to France, and, over 6 months, managed to formulate a Franco-Syrian treaty of independence. Atassi&#x27;s treaty guaranteed emancipation over 25 years, with full incorporation of previously autonomous territories into Greater Syria.

In return, Syria pledged to support France in times of war, offer the use of her air space, and the right for France to maintain military bases on Syrian territory. Other political, cultural, and economic attachments were made and Atassi returned to Syria in triumph on 27 September 1936. Hailed as a national hero, he was elected President of the Republic by a majority vote in November 1936, the first head of state of the modern state of Syria.

=== World War II ===
However, by the end of 1938 it became clear that the French government had no intention of ratifying the treaty, partly due to fears that if it relinquished its colonies in the Middle East, it would be outflanked in a war with Nazi Germany that was brewing in Europe. Atassi resigned on 7 July 1939 as the French continued to procrastinate about full Syrian independence and the withdrawal of French troops, and public discontent at the delay boiled over onto the streets. Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar returned to Syria at this time and agitated against Atassi and the National Block for failing to secure French ratification.

Atassi&#x27;s resignation was also influenced by the French decision to cede the Syrian province of Alexandretta (current day Iskenderun in Hatay Province) to Turkey, enraging Syrian nationalists. The ex-President retired to his native Homs and spent one year in seclusion, refusing to take part in political activity. Following his resignation, several years of instability and French military rule followed. The 1940s overall were dominated by the politics and machinations of World War II and its aftermath. Syria was occupied by British and General Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French Forces, which did not leave until 1946.

In an attempt at appeasing the Syrians, de Gaulle promised independence and visited Syria to elicit support for France. He visited Hashim al-Atassi in Homs and invited him to resume the presidency, assuring the veteran leader that France wanted to turn a new page in her relations with Syria. Atassi refused, however, claiming that his recent experience showed that France could not be trusted in its promises of independence. In 1943, rather than re-nominate himself, Atassi endorsed the election of Shukri al-Quwatli, a well-established Damascus leader who had risen to prominence under Atassi&#x27;s patronage, as President of the Republic.

Atassi took no active part in the final struggle for independence but supported the Quwatli government, which lasted from 1943 to 1949. In 1947, while Syria was facing a prolonged cabinet crisis, President Quwatli called on his old mentor to form a government of national unity. Due to a tense political atmosphere, however, and increasing anti-Quwatli sentiment within political circles, Atassi was unable to intervene to save the administration. He also argued with President Quwatli over presidential authority and conditioned that it would have to be curtailed if he became prime minister, but Quwatli refused.

In March 1949, the Quwatli government was overthrown in a coup d&#x27;état by Chief of Staff Husni al-Za&#x27;im, who headed a military cabinet for four months before he himself was overthrown in August 1949. Following this development, leading politicians called on the aging Atassi to create a provisional government that would supervise national elections and the restoration of civilian rule. He complied and formed a cabinet that included representatives of all parties, including the leftist Baath Party of Michel Aflaq, who he appointed Minister of Agriculture. He released Munir al-Ajlani, who was imprisoned by Husni al-Za&#x27;im, and voted him into the Constitutional Assembly. Under Atassi&#x27;s auspices, a new electoral law was adopted, and women voted for the first time in the election of 15 and 16 November 1949. Atassi served as Prime Minister from August to December 1949, after which a parliamentary majority nominated him for a second term as president.

== Second Presidential term ==
Atassi&#x27;s second term in office was even more turbulent than his first. He came into conflict with the politicians of Damascus for supporting the interests of the Aleppo nobility and their desire to unite with Iraq. He supported the People&#x27;s Party of Aleppo and appointed its leader Nazim al-Qudsi as prime minister. The party was vehemently pro-Iraq and sought a union with Baghdad. One of the Atassi administration&#x27;s most memorable actions was the closure of Syria&#x27;s border with Lebanon to prevent the rampant influx of Lebanese goods into Syria. From 1949 to 1951, he undertook serious talks with the Iraqi government over the union issue.

Atassi received senior Iraqi leaders in Damascus, including Crown Prince Abd al-Illah and Faisal II of Iraq, for technical discussions on union. This angered Syria&#x27;s emerging military strongman Adib Shishakli, who claimed that the Hashemite family of Baghdad should have no jurisdiction over Damascus. Shishakli demanded a change in course, yet Atassi remained adamant and refused to submit to military pressure. In response, Shishakli arrested Atassi&#x27;s Chief of Staff Sami al-Hinnawi, a People&#x27;s Party sympathizer, and several pro-Iraqi officers in the Syrian Army. He then demanded that one of his right-hand-men, Colonel Fawzi Selu, be appointed Minister of Defense, to ensure that pro-Iraqi influence in Syria remained under control.

Fearing a head-on-clash with the military, Atassi reluctantly accepted the demands. In December 1951, however, President Atassi asked Maarouf al-Dawalibi, another member of the People&#x27;s Party, to form a cabinet. Dawalibi accepted the job but refused to give the defense portfolio to Fawzi Selu. As a result, Shishakli launched another coup, arresting the prime minister and all members of the People&#x27;s Party. All ministers and pro-Hashemite statesmen were also abducted, and Parliament was dissolved. In protest, President Atassi presented his resignation to the disbanded Parliament, refusing to submit it to Shishakli, on 24 December 1951.

=== Opposition to military rule ===
During the Shishakli years (1951 to 1954), Atassi spearheaded the opposition, claiming that the Shishakli government was unconstitutional. He rallied the support of disgruntled officers, pro-Hashemite politicians, and members of all outlawed political parties, and called for a national uprising. In February 1954, Shishakli responded by arresting his son Adnan and placing the veteran statesman under house arrest. Such was Atassi&#x27;s stature in Syria as its elder statesman that Shishakli dared not subject him to the indignity of outright imprisonment.

The officers mutinied, political leaders mobilized against the government, and an armed uprising broke out in the Arab Mountain. On 24 February 1954, the government of Adib al-Shishakli was finally overthrown. Four days later, on 28 February, Atassi returned to Damascus from his home in Homs and reassumed his duties as President. He appointed Sabri al-Assali as Prime Minister, and restored all pre-Shishakli ambassadors, ministers, and parliamentarians to office. He tried to eradicate all traces of the four-year Shishakli dictatorship.

== Final years ==

In what remained of his term, the 80-year-old president tried to curb the influence of military officers and worked relentlessly against the leftist current that was brewing in Syria, characterized by socialist ideology, sympathies for the Soviet Union, and blind adherence to the policies of the socialist leader of Egypt, Gamal Abdel Nasser, policies which were supported even among members of the president&#x27;s own powerful clan, such as Jamal al-Atassi and Nureddin al-Atassi. Atassi defied President Nasser and worked in vain to keep Syria out of his socialist orbit.

Unlike most Arab leaders, Atassi believed that Nasser was too young, inexperienced and ideological to lead the Arab world. The Syrian President cracked down on Nasserite elements and clashed with his own pro-Nasser Prime Minister Sabri al-Asali, accusing him of wanting to transform Syria into an Egyptian satellite. In 1955, the President was tempted to accept the Baghdad Pact, an Anglo-American agreement aimed at containing Communism in the region, but Nasserite elements in the Syrian Army prevented him from doing so. He rallied in support of Hashemite Iraq, whose leaders were competing with Nasser over pan-Arab leadership, and was allied to Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Sa&#x27;id. Atassi then dissolved the cabinet of Assali and appointed Said al-Ghazzi followed by Faris al-Khoury, a moderate statesman, as Prime Minister. Atassi dispatched Khoury to Egypt to present Syrian objections to Egyptian hegemony over Arab affairs.

== Death and legacy ==
He died in Homs during the union years with Egypt on 6 December 1960. He was given a state funeral, which was the largest in the history of the city, attended by senior members of the United Arab Republic (UAR) government of President Nasser.

<text>Dermontti Farra Dawson (born June 17, 1965) is an American former professional football player who was a center and long snapper in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football with the Kentucky Wildcats. He was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round of the 1988 NFL draft and spent his entire pro career with the team and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2012.

==Early life==
Dawson was born in Lexington, Kentucky where he attended Bryan Station High School. He was a nationally ranked high school track and field performer in the discus and shot put.

After having a bad experience playing ninth grade football, Dawson chose not to go out for his high school team his sophomore year. He joined the football team as a junior after being recruited due to his size by the school&#x27;s football coach. He was an all-state offensive tackle in high school and eventually accepted a football scholarship to attend the University of Kentucky. Among his high school teammates were future NFL players Marc Logan and Cornell Burbage.

==College career==

Dawson played center and guard at Kentucky. He lettered in each of his four years. In his freshman year in 1984 the team defeated Wisconsin in the Hall of Fame Bowl. As a senior in 1987 Dawson was named second-team All-Southeastern Conference (SEC).

==Professional career==
Dawson was selected by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the second round of the 1988 NFL draft. In his rookie season he played guard alongside Hall of Fame center Mike Webster. When Webster left the team following that season, Dawson succeeded him as the starting center. He soon became one of the more respected players among the Steelers, and one of the best in the league at his position. He earned the name &quot;Dirt&quot; for the way he would try to grind defenders into the ground. In contrast, his friendly off-field demeanor led to a second nickname, Ned Flanders, after the annoyingly cheerful character from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;.
Dawson was named to seven consecutive Pro Bowls from 1992 to 1998 and was a six-time AP First-team All-Pro. In 1993, he was named co-AFC Offensive Lineman of the Year by the NFLPA and in 1996 he was named the NFL Alumni&#x27;s Offensive Lineman of the Year. He played in 170 consecutive games, the second-most in Steelers history, until severe hamstring injuries forced him to sit out nine games in 1999 and seven more games in 2000. Dawson was released by the Steelers following the 2000 season partly due to these injuries and partly due to salary cap reasons. He opted to retire rather than trying to play for another team.
He is the only player to have played in the two most lopsided games in the Browns–Steelers rivalry, getting his first career start at center in the Steelers&#x27; 51–0 loss to the Cleveland Browns at home (still the worst loss for the Steelers in franchise history), but was victorious in the Steelers 43–0 win against the Browns in Cleveland ten years later, in the Browns&#x27; first game in four years.

==Personal life==
Dawson is divorced from Regina – who served as an elementary school principal at Shearer Elementary in nearby Winchester, Kentucky – and has two children. He returned to Lexington after his retirement, where he spent several years as a real estate developer. He filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy protection in 2010 listing over $69 million in liabilities against just under $1.5 million in assets. He currently resides in San Diego, California, where he is a sales executive for a promotional products company.

Dawson served an internship in the Steelers scouting department in and served as an intern coach with the Cincinnati Bengals in 2010. He is also a part owner of the Washington Wild Things, an independent league baseball team in Washington, Pennsylvania.

==Legacy==
Dawson was named the first-team center on the National Football League 1990s All-Decade Team. In 2007, he was selected for the Pittsburgh Steelers All-Time Team which was named as part of the franchise&#x27;s 75th season celebration. The Steelers have not reissued Dawson&#x27;s #63 Jersey since his retirement, though it has not been formally retired. His election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2012 was preceded by three consecutive times of being a finalist listed for the honor.

In 2001 Dawson and his wife established the Dermontti F. and Regina M. Dawson Endowed Graduate Fellowship in Education scholarship at his alma mater, the University of Kentucky (UK). Dawson was appointed to the school&#x27;s board of trustees by Kentucky governor Ernie Fletcher in 2005. He is a member of UK&#x27;s College of Education&#x27;s &quot;Alumni Hall of Fame&quot; and the UK Hall of Distinguished Alumni as well as a charter member of the UK Athletics Hall of Fame. In addition, his jersey has been retired by the school.
