<text>Dalian Maritime University (DLMU; ) is a public university in Dalian, Liaoning, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Transport. The university is part of the Double First-Class Construction.

== History ==

The long history of the university can be traced back to 1909, when the Nanyang Institute in Shanghai established a Shipping Management Section. DMU was founded in 1953 through the merger of three merchant marine institutions: Shanghai Nautical College, the Northeast Navigation College and Fujian Navigation School. At the time its name was Dalian Marine College, and it was the only maritime college in China. In 1960, DMU was designated a national key institution of higher education. Later in 1983, the Asia-Pacific Region Maritime Training Center was established at DMU by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) and the IMO, and in 1985, a branch of the World Maritime University (WMU) was established.

In 1994 the university&#x27;s name was changed to the present one.

On June 6, 2009, DMU celebrated its centennial, with vice chairman of standing committee of 11th National People&#x27;s Congress Chen Zhili as the main guest.

== Academics ==

The university is designated as one of the &quot;Project 211&quot; institutions. Only about six percent of the universities across China were selected in this project. The university consists of 14 colleges and departments. 

Currently DMU has 42 undergraduate programs, 2 first-class doctoral programs, 12 second-class doctoral programs, 7 first-class master&#x27;s degree programs and 59 second-class master&#x27;s degree programs. Transport Engineering first-class discipline has a post-doctoral R&amp;D base. The university is authorized to confer MBA, MPA, J.M., and Master of Engineering, an on-the-job master&#x27;s degree.

<doc id="919191" wikidata="Q6809962" url="?curid=919191" title="Tavira Island">
<text>Tavira Island () lies south of the town of Tavira, Portugal, just a few hundred metres off the coast. It is 11 kilometres long and varies between 150 m to 1 km in width. The island has 11 km of the best beaches in the Algarve, including areas where naturism can be legally practised. It is part of the Natural reserve of Ria Formosa. It is also popular among tourists, people that like to swim and bird watchers.

==History==

The island was home to a thriving tuna industry using the old Phoenician technique called Almadrava, between 1841 and 1967, on Barril beach, where approximately 80 families lived. During the 1960s the tuna numbers declined, the migration patterns of tuna changed and fishing for tuna was abandoned, as well as the canning factories in the area. Sometime after 1966 the anchors used in the Almadrava technique were lined up on the island as a monument to the old tuna fishing industry. A train was used to transport the large tuna to the mainland from the island which has been converted to transport tourists. The old fisherman&#x27;s houses are now used as shops and restaurants.

==Access==

Access to the island is by ferry or water taxi from Quatro Águas, southeast of Tavira, and also by a small floating bridge in the Santa Luzia / Pedras d&#x27;El Rei area, followed by a small train trip (operating during the summer months) or on foot, via a footpath parallel to the railway line (c. 2 km).

<doc id="919204" wikidata="Q808549" url="?curid=919204" title="The Baroque Cycle">
<text>The Baroque Cycle is a series of novels by American writer Neal Stephenson. It was published in three volumes containing eight books in 2003 and 2004. The story follows the adventures of a sizable cast of characters living amidst some of the central events of the late 17th and early 18th centuries in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Central America. Despite featuring a literary treatment consistent with historical fiction, Stephenson has characterized the work as science fiction, because of the presence of some anomalous occurrences and the work&#x27;s particular emphasis on themes relating to science and technology. The sciences of cryptology and numismatics feature heavily in the series, as they do in some of Stephenson&#x27;s other works.

==Books==
The &quot;Baroque Cycle&quot; consists of several novels &quot;lumped together into three volumes because it is more convenient from a publishing standpoint&quot;; Stephenson felt calling the works a &quot;trilogy&quot; would be &quot;bogus&quot;.

Appearing in print in 2003 and 2004, the cycle contains eight books originally published in three volumes:

* &quot;Quicksilver, Vol. I of the Baroque Cycle&quot; – Arthur C. Clarke Award winner, Locus Award nominee, 2004
** Book 1 – Quicksilver
** Book 2 – King of the Vagabonds
** Book 3 – Odalisque
* &quot;The Confusion, Vol. II of the Baroque Cycle&quot; – Locus Award winner
** Book 4 – Bonanza
** Book 5 – The Juncto
* &quot;The System of the World, Vol. III of the Baroque Cycle&quot; – Locus Award winner, Arthur C. Clarke Award nominee, 2005
** Book 6 – Solomon&#x27;s Gold
** Book 7 – Currency
** Book 8 – The System of the World

==Setting==
The books travel throughout early modern Europe between the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy and the beginning of the 18th century. Though most of the focus is in Europe, the adventures of one character, Jack Shaftoe, do take him throughout the world, and the fledgling British colonies in North America are important to another (Daniel Waterhouse). &quot;Quicksilver&quot; takes place mainly in the years between the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy in England (1660) and the Glorious Revolution of 1688. &quot;The Confusion&quot; follows &quot;Quicksilver&quot; without temporal interruption, but ranges geographically from Europe and the Mediterranean through India to the Philippines, Japan and Mexico. &quot;The System of the World&quot; takes place principally in London in 1714, about ten years after the events of &quot;The Confusion&quot;.

==Themes==
A central theme in the series is Europe&#x27;s transformation away from feudal rule and control toward the rational, scientific, and more merit-based systems of government, finance, and social development that define what is now considered &quot;western&quot; and &quot;modern&quot;.
Characters include Sir Isaac Newton, Gottfried Leibniz, Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, William of Orange, Louis XIV of France, Oliver Cromwell, Peter the Great, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough and many other people of note of that time. The fictional characters of Eliza, Jack and Daniel collectively cause real historic effects.

The books feature considerable sections concerning alchemy. The principal alchemist of the tale is the mysterious Enoch Root, who, along with the descendants of several characters in this series, is also featured in the Stephenson novels &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; and &quot;Fall&quot;.

Mercury provides a unifying theme, both in the form of the common name &quot;quicksilver&quot; for the element Mercury, long associated with alchemy and the title of the first volume of the cycle, and the Roman god Mercury, especially the god&#x27;s various patronages: financial gain, commerce, eloquence, messages, communication, travelers, boundaries, luck, trickery, and thieves, all of which are central themes in the plot. Astronomy is also a significant (although secondary) theme in the cycle; a transit of Mercury was notably observed in London on day of the coronation of King Charles II of England, whose Restoration marks, chronologically, the earliest key historical event in the cycle.

==Inspiration==
Stephenson was inspired to write &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot; when, while working on &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, he encountered a statement by George Dyson in &quot;Darwin among the Machines&quot; that suggests Leibniz was &quot;arguably the founder of symbolic logic and he worked with computing machines&quot;. He also had heard considerable discussion of the Leibniz–Newton calculus controversy and Newton&#x27;s work at the treasury during the last 30 years of his life, and in particular the case against Leibniz as summed up in the Commercium Epistolicum of 1712 was a huge inspiration which went on to inform the project. He found &quot;this information striking when [he] was already working on a book about money and a book about computers&quot;. Further research into the period excited Stephenson and he embarked on writing the historical piece that became &quot;The Baroque Cycle&quot;.

<doc id="919207" wikidata="Q1347036" url="?curid=919207" title="I. Bernard Cohen">
<text>I. Bernard Cohen (1 March 1914 – 20 June 2003) was an American historian of science. He taught at Harvard University for 60 years, 1942–2002, becoming the first chair of its Department of the History of Science when it was established in 1966, and he mentored notable students including George Basalla, Lorraine Daston, and Allen G. Debus. He was the author of many books on the history of science and, in particular, on Isaac Newton, Benjamin Franklin, and Howard H. Aiken. He made a full English translation of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia Mathematica&quot; and was the second chief editor of the history of science journal &quot;Isis&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
I. Bernard Cohen was born 1 March 1914 in Far Rockaway, New York City, to Isadore and Blanche Cohen; he had one older sister, Harriet. His father died just before Cohen&#x27;s bar mitzvah at age 12, and Cohen became unmotivated and spent the next years performing unremarkably in schools and early jobs; he attended Columbia Grammar School through 1929 and then spent one semester at New York University before transferring to Farmingdale Agricultural Institute on Long Island for veterinary medicine. This also did not work out, so he returned to New York University but then dropped out and became a Prohibition rum runner while living with relatives in Connecticut. After nearly being shot while unloading rum, he enrolled in Valley Forge Military Academy and began to take his studies more seriously, graduating at the top of his class in 1933.

Cohen next attended Harvard University, where he intended to become a theoretical or mathematical chemical physicist and became a protege of George D. Birkhoff. He graduated in 1937 with a BSc in mathematics and honors in history, with an undergraduate thesis &quot;The Billiard Ball Problem and the Recurrence Property of Dynamical Systems&quot; advised by Birkhoff. He moved directly into Harvard&#x27;s new PhD program in the history of science, the first in the US, and became the first American to receive a PhD in the history of science in 1947.

In this time, Cohen worked closely with historian of science George Sarton, founder of the History of Science Society and founder of the journal &quot;Isis&quot;, becoming his personal assistant 1938–1941. In 1941, petitioning Harvard president James B. Conant to support Cohen in a teaching position, Sarton wrote Cohen was &quot;the best disciple I have had thus far out of a selected group of about a thousand men. He is also the only one whom I could train completely, and his preparation for work in my field is as good as could be from every point of view, scientific, philosophic, historical, and linguistic.&quot; Teaching duties beginning 1942 and secret work for the US in World War II 1942–1943 took his attention off his dissertation research for years, and in the end his final thesis in 1947 was his already-published 1941 edited volume &quot;Benjamin Franklin’s Experiments: A New Edition of Franklin’s Experiments and Observations on Electricity, Edited, with a Critical and Historical Introduction.&quot;

== Career ==
Cohen taught at Harvard from 1942 through his retirement emeritus in 1984, then at the Harvard Extension School and many visiting positions, until his hospitalization for terminal illness in 2002. He was the first chairman of Harvard&#x27;s Department of the History of Science and he rose to the position of Victor S. Thomas Professor of the History of Science at Harvard in 1977. During his tenure, he developed Harvard&#x27;s general education program and its program in the history of science.

Cohen succeeded George Sarton as editor of &quot;Isis&quot; (1952–1958) and, later, served as president of the History of Science Society (1961–1962). Cohen was also a president of the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science 1968–1971. In 1973 he gave three lectures for the A.S.W. Rosenbach Lectures in Bibliography. In 1974, he was awarded the Sarton Medal by the History of Science Society. He was awarded the 1986 Pfizer Award for his book &quot;Revolutions in Science&quot;. He became a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1952 and of the American Philosophical Society in 1995.

Cohen&#x27;s scholarship ranged from science and public policy to the history of computers, with particular concentrations in the study of Isaac Newton and early American science and several decades as a special consultant for history of computing with IBM. He published over 150 articles and over twenty books. The books included &quot;Franklin and Newton&quot; (1956), &quot;The Birth of a New Physics&quot; (1960), &quot;The Newtonian Revolution&quot; (1980), &quot;Revolution in Science&quot; (1985), &quot;Science and the Founding Fathers&quot; (1995), &quot;Howard Aiken: Portrait of a Computer Pioneer&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Triumph of Numbers&quot; (2005).&quot;&quot; He considered his work editing and translating Newton&#x27;s &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; to be his most important.

=== Teaching ===
Cohen began teaching at Harvard in 1942 as a teaching fellow and then an instructor in physics, while still a graduate student. He received tenure in 1953 and became the first chairman of Harvard&#x27;s Department of the History of Science when it was established in 1966. He became Victor S. Thomas Professor of the History of Science at Harvard in 1977 and retired emeritus in 1984.

Harvard&#x27;s president James B. Conant initially asked Sarton and Cohen to focus on teaching undergraduates in the history of science rather than graduate students because Conant worried that PhDs in the history of science could not find employment until the history of science was firmly established as a field in courses at the undergraduate level. For a time in the 1940s, Cohen said he was &quot;in charge of all elementary laboratory work at Harvard — civilians, army ASTP, and Navy V-12—1600 students at the peak.&quot; During this time, he prepared a book on the applications of science for laymen titled &quot;Science, Servant of Man&quot;, published 1948.

Cohen&#x27;s early teaching work developed the undergraduate General Education program at Harvard. He served as a research assistant to Conant on Conant&#x27;s own work on general education, for instance Conant&#x27;s Terry Lectures at Yale University, which Conant adapted into a General Education course of his own, &quot;On Understanding Science,&quot; then into the short book &quot;On Understanding Science: an Historical Approach&quot; (1947) and then the longer &quot;Science and Common Sense&quot; (1951). Cohen also served as a consultant to the faculty committee that established General Education at Harvard and edited &quot;General Education in Science&quot; (1952) with Fletcher Watson. He taught his own original General Education history of science course with an attendance of hundreds titled &quot;The Nature and Growth of the Sciences&quot; for years and published its original textbook, with the same title, in 1954.

Cohen supervised the doctoral dissertations of Lorraine Daston, Allen G. Debus, Judith Grabiner, Kenneth Manning, Uta Merzbach, Duane H. D. Roller, Joan L. Richards, and Helen L. Thomas. Among Cohen&#x27;s other students and protégés were the Islamic philosopher Seyyed Hosein Nasr; Tufts University professor George E. Smith; Bucknell University professor Martha Verbrugge; and Jeremy Bernstein.

While teaching for Harvard, Cohen adapted his teaching materials for larger audiences. Cohen wrote thirteen general-interest essays published in &quot;Scientific American&quot; between 1948 and 1992. Cohen&#x27;s April 1955 interview with Albert Einstein for the July 1955 &quot;Scientific American&quot; was the last Einstein gave before his death. In March 1984, &quot;Scientific American&quot; published an essay by Cohen on Florence Nightingale and her contributions to social statistics. In the 1970s, Cohen became general editor of a five volume series to provide albums of educational illustrations for classes in the history of science, a project inspired and lead by Charles Scribner, Jr., and contributed his own volume to the series: &quot;From Leonardo to Lavoisier, 1450–1800&quot; (1980).

After his retirement from Harvard, Cohen taught at the Harvard Extension School and at many visiting positions until his hospitalization for terminal illness in 2002 interrupted his final classes.

=== Isaac Newton ===
Cohen was an internationally recognized Isaac Newton scholar. He co-authored a 900-page 1972 variorum edition of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; begun with Alexandre Koyré and a 974-page 1999 English translation of the full &quot;Principia&quot;, begun in collaboration with the Latinist Anne Whitman&quot;.&quot; Many, including Cohen, considered this translation to be his most important work.

Cohen also published books on Newton such as &quot;The Birth of a New Physics&quot; (1959), &quot;Introduction to Newton&#x27;s&quot; Principia (1971), and &quot;The Newtonian Revolution&quot; (1980), and he co-edited volumes on Newton such as &quot;Isaac Newton’s Papers and Letters in Natural Philosophy&quot; (1958; 2nd ed. 1978), &quot;Newton: Texts, Backgrounds, Commentaries&quot; (1996, with Richard S. Westfall), &quot;Isaac Newton&#x27;s Natural Philosophy&quot; (2000, with Jed Buchwald), and &quot;The Cambridge Companion to Newton&quot; (2002, with George E. Smith).

Cohen stated his interest in Newton had been inspired by George D. Birkhoff&#x27;s teaching while he was an undergraduate. His professional work on Newton began via his dissertation work on Benjamin Franklin, particularly the influence of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Opticks&quot; on Franklin. His first published work on Newton was &quot;Newton and the Modern World” in &quot;The American Scholar&quot; in 1942. This interest then developed under the mentorship of Alexandre Koyré, who Cohen met via Massachusetts Institute of Technology historian and philosopher Giorgio de Santillana. Cohen and Koyré&#x27;s first collaboration was on Koyré&#x27;s paper “Galileo and Plato” in the &quot;Journal of the History of Ideas&quot; (1943), but they next moved to a letter from Robert Hooke to Newton and soon Cohen wrote a letter of recommendation for John Farquhar Fulton&#x27;s effort to recruit Koyré to Princeton&#x27;s Institute for Advanced Study, which ensured Koyré a place to work in America 1955–1962.

Cohen and Koyré decided to begin the project of preparing a variorum edition of the &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; in 1956 and Cohen took leadership of the project after Koyré&#x27;s death in 1964. They had also planned a joint commentary, but it was never begun. In 1959, Cohen&#x27;s work on the project brought him into lifelong friendship and collaboration with a graduate student, later an internationally recognized authority on Newton&#x27;s mathematical work, Derek T. Whiteside. After Koyré&#x27;s death, Cohen sought assistance from Harvard (BA 1959) Latinist Anne Whitman on the project.

During the preparation of this variorum edition, he also produced his &quot;Introduction to Newton&#x27;s&quot; Principia (1971) and a substantial biographical entry on Newton for the &quot;Dictionary of Scientific Biography&quot; (1974). He also began a translation project, with Whitman, that they continued together until her death in 1984. After completing the variorum edition, Cohen&#x27;s work on Newton focused on an interpretive work, &quot;The Newtonian Revolution: With Illustrations of the Transformation of Scientific Ideas&quot; (1980), which he had begun via his Wiles Lectures at the University of Belfast in 1966.

After Whitman&#x27;s death, Cohen halted work on the new translation of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; out of grief. However, after a prompt from his former student George E. Smith, he revived the project with the assistance of students and a former friend of Whitman&#x27;s, classicist Julia Budenz. The work was finally published in 1999, thirty years after it had begun, after review by Richard S. Westfall, Curtis Wilson, and Smith. It was the first new English translation of Newton’s complete “Principia” since 1729, 270 years before.

=== Early American science ===
Cohen began his professional scholarship with work on the science of Benjamin Franklin and he continued to work on the science of the Founding Fathers of the United States late into his career.

Cohen&#x27;s debut book was the edited volume &quot;Benjamin Franklin’s Experiments&quot; (1941), which became his doctoral dissertation in 1947, though he had planned a more extensive dissertation on the influence of Isaac Newton on Franklin, which eventually became the 1956 book &quot;Franklin and Newton&quot; (after he had already received tenure in 1953). &quot;Benjamin Franklin’s Experiments&quot; was based on the fifth English edition (London, 1774) of &quot;Franklin&#x27;s Experiments and Observations made at Philadelphia&quot; together with additional material, coming to roughly 275 pages, plus an original 160-page introduction by Cohen. Reviewers in &quot;Science&quot; and &quot;The English Historical Review&quot; praised both the introduction and the arrangement of material.

Between the publication of &quot;Benjamin Franklin’s Experiments&quot; and &quot;Franklin and Newton&quot;, Cohen also contributed to the establishment of Harvard&#x27;s Collection of Historic Scientific Instruments, focusing on instruments of the 18th century, and prepared the book &quot;Some Early Tools of American Science&quot; (1950). He also collaborated with Henry Guerlac on a project titled “American Science and the American Republic,” but this was never finished and instead became material for the later works &quot;Science and American Society in the First Century of the Republic&quot; (1961) and &quot;Science and the Founding Fathers&quot; (1995).

&quot;Science and the Founding Fathers&quot; was widely reviewed upon publication, with generally favorable reviews. Reviewers particularly valued Cohen&#x27;s argument that scientific principles were used more as rhetorical metaphors and analogies rather than as genuine mechanical inspirations, the general interest of many rich anecdotes of 18th century intellectual history such as Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s invention of Polly Baker, and Cohen&#x27;s attention to debunking Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s then-popular characterization of the Constitution of the United States as a &quot;Newtonian document&quot; (in his 1908 &quot;Constitutional Government in the United States&quot;), though historian of evolution John C. Greene alleged a core error in Cohen&#x27;s argument against Wilson&#x27;s invocation of Darwinism. To a few reviewers, the material on Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s interest in demography and its political applications, in particular, stood out as novel and valuable. Alongside the general praise, criticism from non-specialists focused on the specialist nature of the work, while criticism from specialists concerned its lack of novelty among specialists, with some specialist reviewers characterizing the book as sometimes repetitive in a &quot;schoolmaster&quot; style and also largely a reformulation of Cohen&#x27;s prior publications.

=== Computing ===
Cohen began his activity in the history of computing in around 1965 and spent several decades as a special consultant for history of computing with IBM. As of 1980, he was a member of the Board of Editors of the &quot;IEEE Annals of the History of Computing&quot;, a member of the American Federation of Information Processing Societies Committee on the History of Computing, and a member of the Board of Directors of the Charles Babbage Institute for the History of Information Processing. Cohen was exposed to the subject earlier and knew Howard Aiken as a graduate student, but his first major professional contribution was a 1967 official report for IBM comparing its collection of historic computers with other collections around the world.

== Personal life ==
Cohen married Frances Parsons Davis in 1944 and they remained married until her death in 1982. They had a daughter, Frances Bernard Cohen, who became a New York psychiatrist and psychoanalyst. He remarried in 1984 with the social worker Susan T. Johnson, gaining two stepsons. He died of the bone marrow disorder myelodysplasia in 2003.

The Shansi Imperial University was prepared in 1901 by Cen Chunxuan, then-governor of Shanxi, and on May 8, 1902, the Shansi Imperial University officially added the College of Western Studies, which was headed by the Welsh Baptist missionary Timothy Richard, focusing on teaching western technologies. 1902 was recognized as the official founding year of Shanxi University. Other than the Chinese government funding, one of the early funding sources of Shanxi University was the returned money from the British government with the Boxer Indemnity of Taiyuan massacre after Boxer Protocol, which was used to support the College of Western Studies.

Along with two other contemporary pioneer universities that started teaching western technologies in China: the Metropolitan Grand School (the predecessor of Peking University) and the Northern Grand School (the Predecessor of Tianjin University), the three universities together inaugurated a new era of modern Chinese higher education.

In 1912, following the Xinhai Revolution, Shansi Imperial University (山西大学堂) was renamed &quot;Shanxi University&quot;. Its name was changed to &quot;National Shanxi University&quot; (simplified Chinese: 国立山西大学 traditional Chinese: 國立山西大學; pinyin: Guoli Shanxi Daxue) in 1918, and changed back to &quot;Shanxi University&quot; in 1931. In 1937, because of the War of Resistance Against Japan, which is part of World War II, Shanxi University was moved away from Taiyuan. The school of law was moved to Pingyao, the college of liberal arts was moved to Yuncheng, the department of engineering and physics and the office of president was moved to Linfen. Later, Japanese army occupied not only Taiyuan, but Pingyao, Yuncheng and Linfen as well. Shanxi University thus stopped teaching until 1938 it was rebuilt in Sanyuan, Shaan&#x27;xi (陕西) in 1938, and later it was moved again to Yichuan. In 1943, because of the typhus epidemic in Yichuan, Shanxi University was moved back to Shanxi (山西) province, at Jixian Nancun, which was the wartime temporary capital of Shanxi province, and the location was renamed as KeNanPo, literally meaning that &quot;overcoming the suffering&quot;. Shanxi University finally moved back Taiyuan in 1946, after the Chinese victory over Japan of the second world war.

=== Late 20th century ===
In 1952, by order of the Ministry of Education of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Department of Liberal Arts and the Department of Science were combined to form Shanxi Normal College, the School of Law was integrated into Renmin University of China in Beijing. The Department of Engineering was dismantled, and fragments absorbed into University of Science and Technology Beijing, Northwestern Polytechnical University and Taiyuan University of Technology. In 1959, Shanxi University was rebuilt on Taiyuan&#x27;s Wucheng Street. By 1998, Shanxi University was considered a key university in Shanxi province.

=== Early 21st century - present ===

In May 2005, Shanxi University became a university co-developed by the state Ministry of Education and the People&#x27;s government of Shanxi province.

<text>Shanxi Agricultural University () is a provincial public university in Shanxi, China. It is managed by the Shanxi Provincial People&#x27;s Government.

It is in the city of Taigu (), a rural area with a population of about 40,000 people.

==History==
The school was founded in 1907 as the Ming Hsien school by a group of missionaries from Oberlin College, including the financier H.H. Kung, the future husband of Soong Ai-ling, the eldest of the three Song (Soong) sisters.

More precisely, the Oberlin missionaries founded a primary school in Taigu in the 1880s. When he was a boy, H.H. Kung became friends with the missionaries after they cured him of an eye disease. The missionaries were killed in the Boxer Rebellion during the summer of 1900, but Kung was sheltered by his family and survived. A few years later, now a young man, Kung was invited to continue his studies at Oberlin College. After graduating from Oberlin, he obtained his master&#x27;s degree at Yale and then returned to China.

In 1907 Kung founded Ming Hsien high school in his hometown of Taigu. (&quot;Ming Hsien&quot; means &quot;remember the worthy&quot; and was named in honor of his Oberlin missionary friends.) Beginning in 1908, Oberlin began sending recent graduates to teach at Ming Hsien and support Kung&#x27;s efforts under the auspices of the Oberlin-Shansi Memorial Association.

In 1950, following the Communist victory in the civil war, Ming Hsien was taken over by the party, turned into a university, and renamed &quot;Shansi Agricultural University.&quot; The American teachers from Oberlin were expelled and did not return until 1982, following China&#x27;s &quot;reform and opening.&quot;

In October 2019, with the view to overall reform and development of higher education and agricultural research in Shanxi, Shanxi Provincial Party Committee and Government decided to merge the Shanxi Agricultural University with the Shanxi Academy of Agricultural Sciences into a new Shanxi Agricultural University, ushering in a new chapter of reform and development.

==Academics==
SXAU has two campuses, Taigu Campus and Taiyuan Longcheng Campus, and research institutes all over the province, among which there are 22 teaching units and 20 directly affiliated research institutes (centers).

<doc id="919274" wikidata="Q14689086" url="?curid=919274" title="Iowa Wesleyan University">
<text>Iowa Wesleyan University was a private university in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, United States. It was Iowa&#x27;s first co-educational institution of higher learning and the oldest of its type west of the Mississippi River. The institution was affiliated with the United Methodist Church. It closed at the end of the 2022–23 academic year due to financial challenges.

Two campus buildings, Old Main and the Harlan-Lincoln House, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The latter, the former summer home of Robert Todd Lincoln, is now a museum featuring various artifacts from the Harlan and Lincoln families.

==History==
In 1841 a group of Methodist settlers in Mount Pleasant, Iowa, met and began lobbying the Iowa territorial legislature to establish an institute of higher learning in their burgeoning community. On February 17, 1842, the legislature granted a charter for the Mount Pleasant Literary Institute, soon to be renamed as Mount Pleasant Collegiate Institute. Despite the charter, organization and fund raising were sluggish at first. Twenty acres of land was donated for the campus by four Mount Pleasant residents in March 1843. That same month, organizing officials hired Reverend Artistides J. Heustis as the institution&#x27;s first president.

From February 1855, the school was known as Iowa Wesleyan University, honoring John Wesley, the founder of Methodism The institution&#x27;s name was modified to Iowa Wesleyan College in 1912, reflecting its contemporary status as a four-year baccalaureate degree institution of higher learning.

On August 10, 2015, Iowa Wesleyan College changed its name to Iowa Wesleyan University.

The university occupied a central campus of historic red brick buildings and modern structures, including some listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The chapel, built in 1896, received a complete renovation and restoration in the early 21st century.

Iowa Wesleyan was accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. 

=== Closure ===
Facing potential closure in 2018, the university was able to continue operating after receiving donations from alumni and a $26 million loan from the United States Department of Agriculture. In 2023, the university&#x27;s board of trustees voted unanimously in favor of closure after Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds determined that a loan of $12 million would not be feasible. Once the university closed, the campus became the responsibility of the USDA. The Mount Pleasant Community School District later bought practice fields and the central part of the campus for about $1.2 million.

Undergraduate enrollment at the college was approximately 600 full-time students at the time of its closure. The final president of the university was Christine Plunkett, from 2019 to 2023.

==Student life==
Beginning in late mid-1800s, Iowa Wesleyan maintained an active Military Department, in which students organized as a corps of cadets received training under the guidance of United States Army officers. Among Iowa Wesleyan&#x27;s commandants were Ulysses G. McAlexander (1891 to 1895) and Charles L. Hodges (1895 to 1897)

==Greek life==
Greek life had a rich history at Iowa Wesleyan University. The Beta chapter of Alpha Xi Delta sorority was the oldest sorority on campus, being on campus since 1902. It was the oldest chapter of Alpha Xi Delta in the country. At the time of closure, Iowa Wesleyan University had 3 active Greek organizations, which include Theta Sigma Rho sorority, Zeta Psi Mu fraternity, and Omega Delta Alpha fraternity.

The P.E.O. Sisterhood was founded at Iowa Wesleyan University on January 21, 1869.

<text>Beijing Jiaotong University (BJTU; ; previously Northern Jiaotong University) is a public university in Haidian, Beijing, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education, and co-funded by the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Transport, the Beijing Municipal People&#x27;s Government, and China State Railway Group Company Limited. The university is part of the Double First-Class Construction and Project 211. 

== History ==
The university was a component of Jiaotong University (also named Chiao Tung University). In September 1909 the Postal Department of the Qing government founded the Railway Management Institute in Beijing. In 1920 the Republic of China was founded and BJTU was attached to the Ministry of Transportation and Communications with its name changed to &quot;Ministry of Communications Traffic Training Institute&quot;. Meanwhile, it increased some subjects including the electrical engineering, cable broadcast and radio. In 1921 it merged with two technical schools in Shanghai and Tangshan to form the Jiaotong University. There were three campuses in Beijing, Shanghai and Tangshan.Beijing Jiaotong University was called &quot;Jiaotong University Beijing School&quot; at that time. The Beijing campus was named National Jiaotong University, Beijing (中国交通大学) in 1949. In 1950 the Beijing campus was renamed Northern Jiaotong University (北方交通大学). In September 2003 it was renamed Beijing Jiaotong University (北京交通大学) to make its locality explicit. The Shanghai campus has since separated into two universities which are now Shanghai Jiaotong University (上海交通大学) and Xi&#x27;an Jiaotong University (西安交通大学). 

There are five Jiaotong Universities in China named: Shanghai Jiaotong University, Xi&#x27;an Jiaotong University, Beijing Jiaotong University, Southwest Jiaotong University and National Chiao Tung University.

Beijing Jiaotong University is listed in the Double First-Class Construction, former 211 Project universities and 985 Project Innovation Platform. In 2017, Beijing Jiaotong University enters the ranks of double first-class construction.

<text>Donald Clarke Andrews (born April 20, 1942, as Vilim Zlomislić) is a Canadian white supremacist. He is the leader of the Nationalist Party of Canada and a perennial candidate for mayor of Toronto, Ontario.

==Early years==
Zlomislić was born to Croat parents in the region of Vojvodina during World War II. His father was killed by the Nazis while fighting with the Yugoslav Partisans against the German occupation of Yugoslavia in late 1944. His mother, Rose, was shipped to Germany in 1943 to work as a slave labourer for the Nazis and Vilim was placed in an orphanage. In 1945, Rose was told that her son had been killed in an air raid. After the war, she met and married Frederick Andrews, a Canadian working for a United Nations agency in a German displaced persons&#x27; camp. The couple moved to Toronto.

Vilim remained at the orphanage and was a member of the Communist Young Pioneers in the post-war Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. He suffered an accident during a camping trip and a botched operation on his leg left him limping and permanently disabled.

His mother continued to search for him after the war through the assistance of the Red Cross, which located Vilim in 1952 and brought him to Canada where he was re-united with his mother and re-named Donald Clarke Andrews.

In Canada, Andrews developed a strong antipathy toward communism, which he blamed for his physical disability. After graduating from high school he began reading far-right tracts by the John Birch Society and George Lincoln Rockwell and adopted far-right and ultimately fascist ideas.

==Education and work==
Andrews was educated at R. H. King Collegiate Institute in Scarborough, Ontario and subsequently took a public health inspection course at Ryerson Polytechnical Institute and earned his qualifications in 1964. He worked as a public health inspector in Scarborough in the 1970s. More recently, he has derived his income by being a landlord.

==Political activity==
===Edmund Burke Society===
In the 1960s, Andrews was drawn to far right groups and cofounded the Edmund Burke Society with Paul Fromm and Leigh Smith in 1967.

===Western Guard===
Andrews became the primary leader of the group and transformed it into the antisemitic and white supremacist Western Guard in 1972. Paul Fromm split with Andrews shortly after the Western Guard was formed in 1972.

Andrews was the first person in Canada charged with wilfully promoting hatred, and in 1975 he was charged with offences ranging from plotting arson, possession of weapons and explosives, and mischief, for which he was sentenced to two years in jail.

Along with the Western Guard he also plotted to bomb a visiting Israeli soccer team, although he was never charged for this. Consequently, the leadership of the Western Guard fell to John Ross Taylor in 1976.

===Nationalist Party===
Don Andrews is a Canadian perennial candidate, having run for Mayor of Toronto in 1972, 1974, 1976, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 2003, 2010 and most recently in 2014, when he came in seventh place with 0.10% of the vote. In the 1974 election, Andrews placed a distant second in the mayoralty race as no serious candidate ran against popular incumbent, David Crombie. As a result, the municipal law was changed so that the runner-up in the mayoralty contest no longer had the right to succeed to the mayor&#x27;s chair should the position become vacant between elections. Andrews has only run on occasions when his name appears first on the ballot. He sat out the 2000 municipal election in which fringe candidate Enza &quot;Supermodel&quot; Anderson was a candidate.

As of 1994, Andrews&#x27; organization had launched a campaign to celebrate &quot;European Heritage Day,&quot; but when it was realized that the event was spearheaded by a neo-Nazi organization, the various cities approached rejected it or revoked their original decision. In 1998, Andrews tried a new tactic by attempting to get a European heritage week declared in London, Ontario. When it was recognized as a neo-Nazi attempt, an emergency vote was held by the municipal government, and the week was cancelled.

===Dominica invasion attempt===
Andrews was involved in the preliminary planning for Operation Red Dog, but left the group when they changed their target to Dominica.

<text>Eliza is a female given name in English, meaning &quot;pledged to God&quot; or &quot;joyful.&quot;

==Etymology==
The name first developed as a diminutive of Elizabeth in the 16th century and its use as an independent name started in the 18th century. The name Elizabeth has been around since the Middle Ages, mainly popularised by the French (using the spelling Elisabeth). Elizabeth with a &quot;z&quot; is the typical spelling in English. Elizabeth is found in the Bible (Luke 1:57) as the mother of John the Baptist. Elizabeth became popularised during the late medieval period as a given name, mostly influenced by two saints: St. Elizabeth of Hungary and St. Elizabeth of Portugal. It was brought to England by the French, and the English can be credited with the formation of Eliza as a hypocorism (the French use Élise).

It may also be used as a variant of the Hebrew name Aliza, עַלִיזָה meaning &quot;joyful&quot;.

<text>S is a statistical programming language developed primarily by John Chambers and (in earlier versions) Rick Becker, Trevor Hastie, William Cleveland and Allan Wilks of Bell Laboratories. The aim of the language, as expressed by John Chambers, is &quot;to turn ideas into software, quickly and faithfully&quot;. It was formerly widely used by academic researchers., but has now been superseded by the partially backwards compatible R language, a part of the GNU free software project. S-PLUS was a widely used commercial implementation of S that was formerly sold by TIBCO Software.

==History==

===&quot;Old S&quot;===

S is one of several statistical computing languages that were designed at Bell Laboratories, and first took form between 1975–1976. Up to that time, much of the statistical computing was done by directly calling Fortran subroutines; however, S was designed to offer an alternate and more interactive approach, motivated in part by exploratory data analysis advocated by John Tukey. Early design decisions that hold even today include interactive graphics devices (printers and character terminals at the time), and providing easily accessible documentation for the functions.

Development of the project was led by John Chambers and Trevor Hastie, and included developers Richard Becker, Allan Wilks, John Chambers, and William Cleveland, all of whom were then employees of AT&amp;T. Out of the developers who contributed to S, Chambers is generally agreed to be the most significant contributor. Chambers received the Software System Award from the Association for Computing Machinery for his work on S.

The first working version of S was built in 1976, and ran on the GCOS operating system. At this time, S was unnamed; naming suggestions included &quot;ISCS (Interactive SCS)&quot;, &quot;SCS (Statistical Computing System)&quot;, and &quot;SAS (Statistical Analysis System)&quot; (which was already taken: see SAS System). The name &#x27;S&#x27; (used with single quotation marks until 1979) was chosen, as it was a common letter in the suggestions and consistent with other programming languages designed from the same institution at the time (namely the C programming language). It stands for the word &quot;statistics&quot;.

When UNIX/32V was ported to the (then new) 32-bit DEC VAX, computing on the Unix platform became feasible for S. In late 1979, S2 was ported from GCOS to UNIX, which would become the new primary platform.

In 1980 the first version of S was distributed outside Bell Laboratories and in 1981 source versions were made available. S was distributed freely in academic circles, and became popular among academic statisticians. The research team at Bell Laboratories published two books in 1984: &quot;S: An Interactive Environment for Data Analysis and Graphics&quot; (known as the &#x27;Brown Book&#x27;) and &quot;Extending the S System&quot;. Also, in 1984 the source code for S became licensed through AT&amp;T Software Sales for education and commercial purposes.

===&quot;New S&quot;===
The first version of S-PLUS was released by Statistical Sciences, Inc. in 1988. S-PLUS was later sold to TIBCO Software. By this time, many changes were made to S and the syntax of the language with the release of S3. &quot;The New S Language&quot; (known as the &#x27;Blue Book&#x27;) was published to introduce the new features, such as the transition from &quot;macros&quot; to &quot;functions&quot; and how functions can be passed to other functions (such as codice_1). Many other changes to the S language were to extend the concept of &quot;objects&quot;, and to make the syntax more consistent (and strict). However, many users found the transition to &quot;New S&quot; difficult, since their macros needed to be rewritten. Many other changes to S took hold, such as the use of X11 and PostScript graphics devices, rewriting many internal functions from Fortran to C, and the use of double precision (only) arithmetic. The &quot;New S&quot; language is very similar to that used in modern versions of S-PLUS and R.

The graphical user interface of S was also updated interactive graphical features after integration with Axum.

&quot;Statistical Models in S&quot; (known as the &#x27;White Book&#x27;) was published in 1991, introducing Wilkinson-Rogers formula notation (using the codice_2 operator) for defining statistical models, data frame objects, and modifications to the use of object methods and classes.

===S4===
The latest version of the S standard is S4, released in 1998. It provides advanced object-oriented features. S4 classes differ markedly from S3 classes; S4 formally defines the representation and inheritance for each class, and has multiple dispatch: the generic function can be dispatched to a method based on the class of any number of arguments, not just one.

The history of China Agricultural University can be traced back to 1905 when the College of Agriculture was founded in the former Imperial University of Peking. Beijing Agricultural University (BAU) was established in September 1949 through the merging of Peking University&#x27;s College of Agriculture, Tsinghua University&#x27;s College of Agriculture and North China University&#x27;s College of Agriculture.

In 1954, BAU was listed by the State Council as one of the Top-Six National Key Universities as well as one of the Top-Ten Key Universities for further construction and improvement.

In October 1952, BAU&#x27;s Department of Agricultural Machinery, North China College of Agricultural Machinery and Ministry of Agriculture&#x27;s Central Agricultural Mechanization School merged to form the Beijing Mechanized Agricultural College, which was renamed Beijing Agricultural Mechanization Institute (BAMI) in July 1953. The BAMI was listed by the State Council in October 1960 as one of the 64 National Key Universities and then renamed again as Beijing Agricultural Engineering University (BAEU) in 1985.

In 1995, Beijing Agricultural University and Beijing Agricultural Engineering University merged as China Agricultural University (CAU). Since then, the university has become the top academic institution in China in terms of agricultural studies.

<text>Beijing Language and Culture University (BLCU; ) is a public university of linguistics in Haidian, Beijing, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education of China.The university has the main aim of teaching the Chinese language and culture to foreign students. It is a key university directly under the Ministry of Education of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is the only international university founded by the People&#x27;s Republic of China named after &quot;language&quot; and with the main mission of spreading Chinese language and culture. However, it also takes Chinese students specializing in foreign languages and other relevant subjects of humanities and social sciences, and trains teachers of Chinese as a foreign language. It used to be the only institute of this kind in China. After the push for higher education starting in the 90s, nowadays many other universities in almost every major city in China have a similar offer. Thus bachelor, master or post-doc degrees in &quot;Teaching Chinese as a second language to Foreigners&quot;, as well as bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in several foreign languages, are no longer only to be found at BLCU. 

Beijing Language and Culture University is often called &quot;Little United Nations&quot; in China because of its very large number of international students from various countries. As of 2022, there are approximately 9,000 international students in its campus, ranking first in China.

==History==
Early in the 1950s when the teaching of Chinese as a foreign language (TCFL) was still at the initial stage, the first generation of BLCU teachers took an active part in the pioneering work. As a result, the first school of higher education specially oriented to foreign students, &quot;Higher Preparatory School for Foreign Students&quot;, was established in June 1962. In 1964, the school was officially named &quot;Beijing Language Institute&quot; (). In June 1996, it was renamed &quot;Beijing Language and Culture University&quot; (). Its Chinese name was shortened in July 2002 to &quot;Beijing Language University&quot; with the approval of the Ministry of Education, but the English name remained unchanged. September 6, 2002, witnessed the celebration of the 40th anniversary of BLCU, for which General-Secretary Jiang Zemin and Vice-Premier Li Lanqing wrote letters of congratulations, and the Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee Li Peng wrote words of encouragement. BLCU was granted the privilege to confer doctoral degrees in foreign languages and literature in 2011.

Throughout its history, the university has educated more than 220,000 international students from 189 different nations and regions around the globe. As of 2022, there are approximately 9,000 international students in its campus, ranking first in China.

==Campus==
The campus of BLCU is located in the Haidian District of Beijing. It takes about 330,289 m2, and total building area is about 427,342 m2. Most teaching facilities, including the main building, library and gym are in the teaching area, while dormitories for Chinese students are there as well.

<text>The China University of Political Science and Law (CUPL; ; pinyin: Zhōng Guó Zhèng Fǎ Dà Xué), also translated as Zhengfa University, is a national public university in Beijing, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Education and co-sponsored with the Beijing Municipal People&#x27;s Government. The university is part of Project 211 and the Double First-Class Construction.

The university has a strong emphasis on the research and teaching of law, politics, economics, management, sociology, history, and philosophy. CUPL has two campuses, one in Haidian as the original campus of the university, and the other located in Changping. At present, Haidian campus only conducts postgraduate education while undergraduates study on the larger Changping campus. In 2015, CUPL comprises 13 schools, with 15,833 students and 951 faculty members, of whom 290 are professors. CUPL maintains a broad international exchange program, with approximately 1000 foreign students from many countries.

==History==
CUPL was initially established in 1952, with its name as the Beijing College of Political Science and Law, incorporating departments of law, political science, and sociology of Peking University, Yenching University, Fu Jen Catholic University, and Tsinghua University. The prestigious scholar Ch&#x27;ien Tuan-Sheng (), who was educated at Harvard University and regarded as the founder of modern political science in China, was appointed as the first president. But after the outbreak of Cultural Revolution, CUPL was greatly affected. CUPL had been stopped during Cultural Revolution. Ch&#x27;ien died of illness in 1990.

In 1983, under the policy of Central People&#x27;s Government to develop the college quickly and make it the center of politics and law education in China, BCPSL was renamed as the China University of Political Science and Law. The Changping campus was a part of the State&#x27;s Seventh Five-Year-Plan in 1985.

Under the motto of &quot;Cherish the Moral, Understand the Law, Know the World, Serve the Public&quot;; CUPL made its contribution to the development of legal education and training in China. It was the first university to establish specialties such as Legal History, Civil and Commercial Law, Economic Law, Procedure Law and Comparative Law in the PRC. It also contributed to the education and promotion of Roman law in China. With over 100,000 graduates in the past 50 years who have become the elites of law enforcement and practitioners in China, CUPL has developed a niche for the enactment and enforcement of law in China. Furthermore, it became prominent in other public affairs in China, among which members of the faculty and student body played an active role in the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 demanding democracy and rule of law.

To face the challenge of globalization, CUPL developed joint programs with international partners. CUPL provided the first opportunity to study Chinese law in Beijing with an American Bar Association-approved program inaugurated in 1995 by the Duquesne University School of Law. In 2008, an exchange program was formed with Fordham University School of Law.

<text>The University of International Relations (UIR; ) is a public university in Haidian, Beijing, China.

The Institute for International Relations, later translated into English as Institute &quot;of&quot; International Relations, was established in 1949 by the first premier of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Zhou Enlai, to train diplomats. It became one of the National Key Universities in 1960, and was one of the first in China to offer master&#x27;s degrees. In 1983, the school became the first foreign studies institute in China to evolve into a comprehensive university.

The University of International Relations has offered a joint doctoral program with the China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, the 11th Bureau of the Ministry of State Security (MSS), China&#x27;s civilian intelligence agency. A 2011 report by the Open Source Enterprise stated, &quot;CICIR appears to have a close relationship with the University of International Relations in Beijing, with nearly half of the organization&#x27;s senior leadership — including President Cui Liru and Director of the CICIR Institute of American Studies Yuan Peng — having either taught or studied at the school.&quot;

==History==

The University of International Relations was founded in 1949 to train foreign affairs cadres for the newly created People&#x27;s Republic of China. In 1961, the school merged with then Foreign Affairs College.

In 1964, then-Premier Zhou Enlai ordered the creation of colleges and university departments to focus on international affairs. Several government agencies, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party, established their own institutes for the study of international affairs. The University of International Relations was formally affiliated with the Ministry of Public Security in 1965, and was charged with training intelligence agents for the Central Investigation Department (both predecessors to the MSS) and for Xinhua News Agency.

Like many schools in China, the University of International Relations was shuttered during China&#x27;s Cultural Revolution and reopened in 1978. In 1983, the school became the first foreign studies institute in China to evolve into a comprehensive university. In 2021, UIR was accredited to confer doctoral degrees in politics and master&#x27;s degrees in national security.

==Affiliation==
Despite claims from CCP sources that the University of International Relations operates under the direction of the Ministry of Education, the university does not appear on the Ministry of Education&#x27;s list of subordinate universities, and every available academic source concludes that the university is an affiliate of the Ministry of State Security (MSS). Also, provincial government documents suggest that the UIR is affiliated with the MSS, mentioning it alongside Jiangnan Social University, a known MSS training institute. The university&#x27;s campus is directly adjacent to the national headquarters of the MSS to the south and to the Central Party School of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to the west. According to Stratfor, &quot;training for most MSS officers begins at the Beijing [campus of the] University of International Relations.&quot; 

The &quot;Historical Dictionary of Chinese Intelligence&quot; states that the university&#x27;s &quot;relationship with the MSS is intended to be covert&quot;. According to József Boda of Hungary&#x27;s National University of Public Service, the &quot;UIR gives the MSS a way to work with foreign universities and academics to shape and learn about perceptions of the PRC&#x27;s views on security. It also provides a platform for the MSS to identify talents, recruit officers and collect intelligence.&quot;

== Partnerships ==
The university maintains partnerships and exchanges with Marietta College, University of Massachusetts Boston, Aalborg University, Toulouse 1 University Capitole, Hiroshima University, Hiroshima City University, Ibaraki University, among others.

<doc id="919339" wikidata="Q772766" url="?curid=919339" title="The Diary of Lady Murasaki">
<text>is the title given to a collection of diary fragments written by the 11th-century Japanese Heian era lady-in-waiting and writer Murasaki Shikibu. It is written in kana, then a newly-developed writing system for vernacular Japanese, more common among women, who were generally unschooled in Chinese. Unlike modern diaries or journals, 10th-century Heian diaries tend to emphasize important events more than ordinary day-to-day life and do not follow a strict chronological order. The work includes vignettes, poems, and an epistolary section written in the form of a long letter.

The diary was probably written between 1008 and 1010 when Murasaki was in service at the imperial court. The largest portion details the birth of Empress Shōshi&#x27;s (Akiko) children. Shorter vignettes describe interactions among imperial ladies-in-waiting and other court writers, such as Izumi Shikibu, Akazome Emon and Sei Shōnagon. Murasaki includes her observations and opinions throughout, bringing to the work a sense of life at the early 11th century Heian court, lacking in other literature or chronicles of the era.

A Japanese picture scroll, the , was produced during the Kamakura period (1185–1333), and the fragments of the diary serve as the basis for three important translations to English in the 20th century.

== Background ==

At the peak of the Heian period, from the late 10th to early 11th century, as Japan sought to establish a unique national culture of its own it saw the genesis of early Japanese classical literature, which to a large part emerged from women&#x27;s court literature. Through the rise and use of kana, aristocratic women court writers formed a foundation for classical court literature, according to Haruo Shirane. Kokin Wakashū&#x27;s first imperial collection, published , set the foundation for court literature. Up to this point, Japanese literature was written in Chinese – traditionally the language of men in the public sphere. It was in the literature of the imperial court that the gradual shift toward the vernacular kana writing system was most evident, and where poetry became immensely popular. As Shirane explains: &quot; became integral to the everyday life of the aristocracy, functioning as a form of elevated dialogue and the primary means of communication between the sexes, who usually were physically segregated from each other.&quot;

By the early 11th century new genres of women&#x27;s court literature were appearing in the form of diaries and poetic stories. Women, relegated to the private sphere, quickly embraced the use of kana, unlike men who still conducted business in Chinese. Women&#x27;s writing showed a marked difference from men&#x27;s, more personal and introspective in nature. Thus written Japanese was developed by women who used the language as a form of self-expression and, as Japanese literature scholar Richard Bowring says, by women who undertook the process of building &quot;a flexible written style out of a language that had only previously existed in a spoken form&quot;.


Emperor Ichijō&#x27;s court, dominated by the powerful Fujiwara clan, was the seat of two rival imperial empresses, Teishi and Shōshi, each with ladies-in-waiting who were proficient writers producing works honoring their mistresses and the Fujiwara clan. The three most noteworthy Heian-era diaries in the genre of – Murasaki&#x27;s &quot;The Diary of Lady Murasaki&quot;, Sei Shōnagon&#x27;s &quot;The Pillow Book&quot; and Izumi Shikibu&#x27;s – came from the empresses&#x27; courts. Murasaki&#x27;s diary covers a discrete period, most likely from 1008 to 1010. Only short and fragmentary pieces of the diary survive and its importance lies, in part, in the revelations about the author, about whom most of the known biographical facts come from it and from her short poetry collection, the (or &quot;Poetic Memoirs&quot;).

Murasaki&#x27;s given name is unknown. Women were often identified by their rank or that of a husband or another close male relative. &quot;Murasaki&quot; was given to her at court, from a character in &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;; &quot;Shikibu&quot; denotes her father&#x27;s rank at the Ministry of Ceremonial Affairs (). A member of a minor branch of the Fujiwara clan, her father was a scholar of Chinese literature who educated both his children in classical Chinese, although educating a female child was exceedingly uncommon.

Around 998 Murasaki married Fujiwara no Nobutaka (); she gave birth to a daughter in 999. Two years later her husband died. Scholars are unsure when she started writing the novel () &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, but she was certainly writing after she was widowed, perhaps in a state of grief. In her diary she describes her feelings after her husband&#x27;s death: &quot;I felt depressed and confused. For some years I had existed from day to day in listless fashion[...] doing little more than registering the passage of time[...] The thought of my continuing loneliness was quite unbearable&quot;. On the strength of her reputation as an author, Murasaki entered service with Shōshi at court, almost certainly at the request of Shōshi&#x27;s father, Fujiwara no Michinaga, perhaps as an incentive to continue adding chapters to &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. She began writing her diary after entering imperial service.
==Diary==
The diary consists of a number of vignettes containing lengthy description of Shōshi&#x27;s (known as Akiko)&#x27;s eldest son Prince Atsuhira&#x27;s birth, and an epistolary section. Set at the imperial court in Kyoto, it opens with these words: &quot;As autumn advances, the Tsuchimikado mansion looks unutterably beautiful. Every branch on every tree by the lake and each tuft of grass on the banks of the stream takes on its own particular color, which is then intensified by the evening light.&quot;

The opening vignettes are followed by short accounts of the events surrounding Shōshi&#x27;s pregnancy. She begins with a description of the Empress&#x27;s removal from the Imperial palace to her father&#x27;s house, the various celebrations and rituals that took place during the pregnancy, and the eventual childbirth with its associated rites in celebration of the successful delivery of a male heir. These passages include specific readings of sutras and other Buddhist rituals associated with childbirth.

Several passages account Murasaki&#x27;s dissatisfaction with court life. She describes feelings of helplessness, her sense of inadequacy compared to higher-ranked Fujiwara clan relatives and courtiers, and the pervasive loneliness after her husband&#x27;s death. In doing so, she adds a sense of self to the diary entries.

The diary includes autobiographical snippets about Murasaki&#x27;s life before she entered imperial service, such as a childhood anecdote about how she learned Chinese:
Some textual fragments may not have survived. Bowring believes the work is difficult to define, that piecing it together is puzzling. He sees four discrete sections, beginning with the dated descriptions of the birth, followed by two undated sections of introspective vignettes, and a final dated section in chronological order. This &quot;strange arrangement&quot;, as he calls it, might be the result of stitching together a series of incomplete sources or fragments. The diary&#x27;s text was used as a source for the – a laudatory work about Michinaga and the Fujiwara clan, written or compiled in the 11th century – with entire sections copied verbatim from Murasaki&#x27;s work. Yet the textual differences between the two suggests the author had access to a different, perhaps more complete text of the diary than has survived. Bowring questions whether the current structure is original to Murasaki, and the degree to which it has been rearranged or rewritten since she authored it.

===Fujiwara dynasty===
Unlike the imaginary courts of Murasaki&#x27;s romantic novel &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;, the descriptions in the diary of imperial court life are starkly realistic. The ideal &quot;shining prince&quot; Genji of her novel contrasts sharply with Michinaga and his crass nature; he embarrasses his wife and daughter with his drunken behavior, and his flirtations toward Murasaki make her uncomfortable. She writes about waking in the morning to find him lurking in the garden outside her window, and the ensuing exchange of :
Whether the two were intimate is a question scholars have been unable to determine.

Although the diary&#x27;s sections about the birth of Shōshi&#x27;s son were meant as a tribute to Michinaga, he is revealed as overly controlling. The child&#x27;s birth was of enormous importance to Michinaga, who nine years earlier brought his daughter to court as a concubine to Emperor Ichijō; Shōshi&#x27;s quick ascendence to Empress and status as a mother to the heir consolidated her father&#x27;s power. The child&#x27;s birth and its lengthy descriptions, &quot;marked the final tightening of Michinaga&#x27;s velvet-gloved strangle-hold on imperial succession through his masterful manipulation of marriage politics.&quot;

Michinaga dominated the child&#x27;s father and attending priests throughout the birth ceremonies. After the birth, he visited twice daily, whereas the Emperor only made a single short imperial visit to his son. Murasaki chronicles each of Michinaga&#x27;s ceremonial visits, as well as the lavish ceremony held 16 days after the birth. These include intricate descriptions of the ladies and their court attire:
Shōshi appears to have been serious and studious, a royal who expected decorum from her ladies-in-waiting – which often created difficulties at a fractious court. When she asked Murasaki for lessons in Chinese, she insisted they be conducted in secret. Murasaki explained that &quot;because [Shōshi] evinced a desire to know more about such things, to keep it secret we carefully chose times when the other women would not be present, and, from the summer before last, I started giving her informal lessons on the two volumes of &#x27;New Ballads&#x27;. I hid this fact from others, as did Her Majesty&quot;.
=== Court life ===
Some of the diary&#x27;s passages are unflinching in exposing the behavior at the imperial court, particularly that of drunken courtiers who seduced the ladies-in-waiting. As Keene describes it, the court was a place where the courtiers were &quot;drunken men who make obscene jokes and paw at women&quot;. Murasaki complained about drunk courtiers and princes who behaved badly, such as the incident when at a banquet court poet Fujiwara no Kintō joined a group of women asking whether Murasaki was present – alluding to the character in &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. Murasaki retorted that none of the novel&#x27;s characters lived at this tawdry and unpleasant court, so unlike the court in her novel. She left the banquet when &quot;Counsellor Takai[...] started pulling at Lady Hyōbu&#x27;s robes and singing dreadful songs, but His Excellency said nothing. I realized that it was bound to be a terribly drunken affair this evening, so[...] Lady Saishō and I decided to retire.&quot;

There are anecdotes about drunken revelries and courtly scandals concerning women who, because of behavior or age, were forced to leave imperial service. Murasaki suggests that the court women were weak-willed, uneducated, and inexperienced with men.

The women lived in semi-seclusion in curtained areas or screened spaces without privacy. Men were allowed to enter the women&#x27;s space at any time. When the Imperial palace burned down in 1005 the court was itinerant for the following years, depending on Michinaga for housing. Murasaki lived at his Biwa mansion, the Tsuchimikado mansion, or Emperor Ichijō&#x27;s mansion, where there was little space. Ladies-in-waiting had to sleep on thin futons rolled out on bare wood floors in a room often created by curtaining off a space. The dwellings were slightly raised and opened to the Japanese garden, affording little privacy. Bowring explains how vulnerable the women were to men watching them: &quot;A man standing outside in the garden looking in[...] his eyes would have been roughly level with the skirts of the woman inside.&quot;

The houses were cold and drafty in the winter, with few braziers available to the women whose multilayered kept them warm, of which there are detailed descriptions in the work. Heian-period noble women dressed in six or seven garments, each layered over the next, some with multiple linings in differing hues and color combinations. The description of the clothing the ladies-in-waiting wore at an imperial event shows the importance of fashions, the arrangement of their layers, as well as Murasaki&#x27;s keen observational eye:

Combining layers of garments, each with multiple linings, to arrive at harmonic color combinations known as assumed an almost ritual fascination to the women. It required attention, and achieving an individual stylistic aesthetic was important. Colour combinations were referred to using names reflecting their season of wear, and though they took inspiration from nature, did not aim to faithfully reproduce its colours, instead aiming for an evocation of the season. Murasaki chronicles the significance of making a mistake at a courtly function when two women failed in a perfect color combination: &quot;That day all the women had done their utmost to dress well, but[...] two of them showed a want of taste when it came to the color combinations at their sleeves[...] [in] full view of the courtiers and senior nobles.&quot;
===Ladies-in-waiting===
Murasaki suffered overwhelming loneliness, had her own concerns about ageing, and was not happy living at court. She became withdrawn, writing that perhaps the other women considered her stupid, shy or both: &quot;Do they really look on me as such a dull thing, I wonder? But I am what I am[...] [Shōshi] too has often remarked that she thought I was not the kind of person with whom one could ever relax[...] I am perversely stand-offish; if only I can avoid putting off those for whom I have genuine respect.&quot; Keene speculates that as a writer who required solitude Murasaki&#x27;s loneliness may have been &quot;the loneliness of the artist who craves companionship but also rejects it&quot;. He points out she had &quot;exceptional powers of discernment&quot; and probably alienated the other women, about 15 or 16 of whom she describes in her diary. Although she adds praise for each woman, her criticism is more memorable because she saw through and described their flaws.

Her insights did not endear her to the other women at a court where intrigue, drama and scheming was the norm, yet for a novelist it was crucial. He believes that she needed to be aloof so as to be able to continue writing, but equally that she was intensely private, a woman who &quot;chose not to reveal her true qualities&quot; except to those who earned her trust and respect, as Shōshi had.
The diary includes descriptions of other ladies-in-waiting who were writers, most notably Sei Shōnagon, who had been in service to Shōshi&#x27;s rival and co-empress, Empress Teishi (Sadako). The two courts were competitive; both introduced educated ladies-in-waiting to their respective circles and encouraged rivalry among the women writers. Shōnagon probably left court after Empress Teishi&#x27;s death in 1006, and it is possible the two never met, yet Murasaki was quite aware of Shōnagon&#x27;s writing style and her character. She disparages Shōnagon in her diary:

Murasaki is also critical of the two other women writers at Shōshi&#x27;s court – poet Izumi Shikibu, and Akazome Emon who authored a . Of Izumi&#x27;s writing and poetry she says:

=== The diary and &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; ===

Murasaki&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot; is barely mentioned in the diary. She writes the Emperor had the story read to him, and that colored papers and calligraphers had been selected for transcriptions of the manuscript – done by court women. In one anecdote she tells of Michinaga sneaking into her room to help himself to a copy of the manuscript. There are parallels between the later chapters of &quot;Genji&quot; and the diary. According to Genji scholar Shirane, the scene in the diary which describes Ichijo&#x27;s imperial procession to Michinaga&#x27;s mansion in 1008 corresponds closely to an imperial procession in chapter 33 (&quot;Wisteria Leaves&quot;) of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;. Shirane believes the similarities suggest portions of &quot;Genji&quot; may have been written during the period Murasaki was in imperial service and wrote the diary.

==Style and genre==

Heian-era diaries resemble autobiographical memoirs more than a diary in the modern sense. The author of a Heian-era diary (a ) would decide what to include, expand, or exclude. Time was treated in a similar manner – a might include long entries for a single event while other events were omitted. The was considered a form of literature, often not written by the subject, almost always written in third-person, and sometimes included elements of fiction or history. These diaries are a repository of knowledge about the Imperial Heian court, considered highly important in Japanese literature, although many have not survived in a complete state. The format typically included poetry, meant to convey information to the readers, as seen in Murasaki&#x27;s descriptions of court ceremonies.

Few if any dates are included in Murasaki&#x27;s diary and her working habits are not chronicled. It should not be compared to a modern &#x27;writer&#x27;s notebook&#x27;, according to Keene. Although it chronicles public events, the inclusion of self-reflective passages is a unique and important part of the work, adding a human aspect unavailable in official accounts. According to Keene, the author is revealed as a woman with great perception and self-awareness, yet a person who is withdrawn with few friends. She is unflinching in her criticism of aristocratic courtiers, seeing beyond superficial facades to their inner core, a quality Keene says is helpful for a novelist but less useful in the closed society she inhabited.

Bowring believes the work contains three styles, each distinct from the other. The first is the matter-of-fact chronicle of events, a chronicle which otherwise would typically have been written in Chinese. The second style is found in the author&#x27;s self-reflective analysis. He considers the author&#x27;s self-reflections the best that have survived from the period, noting that Murasaki&#x27;s mastery of introspective style, still rare in Japanese, reflects her contributions to the development of written Japanese in that she conquered the limits of an inflexible language and writing system. The epistolary section represents the third style, a newly developed trend. Bowring sees this as the weakest portion of the work, a section where she fails to break free of the rhythms of spoken language. He explains that the rhythms of spoken language assumes the presence of an audience, is often ungrammatical, relies on &quot;eye contact, shared experiences and particular relationships [to] provide a background which allows speech to be at times fragmentary and even allusive&quot;. In contrast, written language must compensate for &quot;the gap between the producer and receiver of the message&quot;. She may have been experimenting with the new style of writing, either producing a fictional letter or writing a real letter, but he writes that at the end of the section the writing is weaker, &quot;degenerating into[...] disjointed rhythms that are characteristic of speech.&quot;
==Translations==

In 1920, Annie Shepley Omori and Kochi Doi published &quot;Diaries of Court Ladies of Old Japan&quot;; this book combined their translation of Murasaki&#x27;s diary with Izumi Shikibu&#x27;s (The ) and with the . Their translation had an introduction by Amy Lowell.

Richard Bowring published a translation in 1982, which contains a &quot;lively and provocative&quot; analysis.

== 13th-century handscroll ==

In the 13th century, a handscroll of the diary was produced, the . The scroll, meant to be read from left to right, consists of calligraphy illustrated with paintings. Writing in &quot;The House-bound Heart&quot;, Japanese scholar Penelope Mason explains that in an or , a narrative reaches its full potential through the combination of the writer&#x27;s and the painter&#x27;s art. About 20 percent of the scroll has survived; based on the existing fragments, the images would have closely followed the text of the diary.

The illustrations in the emaki follow the late-Heian and early Kamakura period convention of (&#x27;line-eye and hook-nose&#x27;) in which individual facial expressions are omitted. Also typical of the period is the style of (&#x27;blown-off roof&#x27;) depictions of interiors which seem to be visualized from above looking downward into a space. According to Mason, the interior scenes of human figures are juxtaposed against empty exterior gardens; the characters are &#x27;house-bound&#x27;.

In the diary Murasaki writes of love, hate and loneliness, feelings which make the illustrations, according to Mason, of the &quot;finest extant examples of prose-poetry narrative illustrations from the period&quot;. Mason finds the illustration of two young courtiers opening the lattice blinds to enter the women&#x27;s quarters particularly poignant, because Murasaki tries to hold the lattice shut against their advances. The image shows that the architecture and the men who keep her away from the freedom of the garden to the right.

The scroll was discovered in 1920 in five segments by . The Gotoh Museum holds segments one, two and four; the Tokyo National Museum holds the third segment; the fifth remains in a private collection. The portions of the held at the Gotoh museum have been designated as National Treasures of Japan.

<text>The Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications (; CQUPT) is a municipal public university in Nan&#x27;an, Chongqing, China. It is affiliated with the Chongqing Municipal People&#x27;s Government.

==History==

CQUPT was founded in 1950 along with the foundation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the communist takeover of Chongqing. It was initially founded in the name of Chongqing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications. In 1965, it was entitled to have postgraduate programs as one of the first 10 colleges that had the right to have such programs in the then Sichuan Province (Chongqing separated from Sichuan province as a Municipality in 1997).

In 2000, under the university system reform in China, the university became co-governed and co-financed by the Central Government with the Chongqing municipal government. In 2006, CQUPT contracted with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology of China to become one of the universities supported by the central government ministry and the municipality government.

==Library and University Press==
Library

The Library of East China University of Science and Technology (ECUST) was established in 1952 and is placed under direct auspice of the Ministry of Education of People&#x27;s Republic of China. Starting with the collections of the different departments that initially made up the foundation of the college, it has developed into a research library for multiple disciplines ranging from chemistry and chemical engineering to natural sciences, engineering, management and liberal arts.

The library system of ECUST encompasses three branches among the major campuses. The library in Xuhui, built in 1987, houses most of the book collections, while the new nine-story library in Fengxian marks the center of the new campus and is geared towards undergraduate students. Together, they cover a floor space of almost 46,000 m2 and offer 3,500 seats in the reading rooms. Electronic resources are abundant, with databases shared among several university library systems and access to academic journals. In total, more than 2,600,000 books and publications are available. The university maintains subscriptions for over 2,000 foreign journals in print and over 30,000 in digital form. There is also a library in its Jinshan Campus, storing many books with a low usage.

The library is a member of the Shanghai Library system and one of its main nodes where inter-library loan is possible. It plays an active part in the theory and practice of teaching literature search that have been set up at ECUST. In 2004, with the introduction of a master&#x27;s degree in Information science, this role was further strengthened. Also on offer are services to students and the wider public, including, but not limited to, a language training center and the provision of teaching material in foreign languages, a center for the distribution of cultural resources and book consulting services both in-person and online.

<doc id="919365" wikidata="Q2583804" url="?curid=919365" title="American Anti-Imperialist League">
<text>The American Anti-Imperialist League was an organization established on June 15, 1898, to battle the American annexation of the Philippines as an insular area. The anti-imperialists opposed forced expansion, believing that imperialism violated the fundamental principle that just republican government must derive from &quot;consent of the governed&quot;. The League argued that such activity would necessitate the abandonment of American ideals of self-government and non-intervention—ideals expressed in the United States Declaration of Independence, George Washington&#x27;s Farewell Address and Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Gettysburg Address. The Anti-Imperialist League was ultimately defeated in the battle of public opinion by a new wave of politicians who successfully advocated the virtues of American territorial expansion in the aftermath of the Spanish–American War and in the first years of the 20th century, although the organization lasted until 1920.

== Organizational history ==

=== Forerunners ===
The idea for an Anti-Imperialist League was born in the spring of 1898. On June 2, retired Massachusetts banker Gamaliel Bradford (banker) published a letter in the &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot; in which he sought assistance gaining access to historic Faneuil Hall to hold a public meeting to organize opponents of American colonial expansion. An opponent of the Spanish–American War, Bradford decried what he saw as an &quot;insane and wicked&quot; colonial ambition among some American decision-makers which was &quot;driving the country to moral ruin.&quot; Bradford&#x27;s organizing efforts proved successful, and on June 15, 1898, his protest meeting against &quot;the adoption of an imperial policy by the United States&quot; was held.

The June 15 meeting gave rise to a formal four-member organizing committee known as the Anti-Imperialist Committee of Correspondence, headed by Bradford. This group contacted religious, business, labor, and humanitarian leaders from around the country and attempted to stir them into action to stop what they perceived as a growing menace of American colonial expansion into Hawaii and the former colonial possessions of the Spanish Empire. A letter-writing campaign attempting to involve editors of newspapers and magazines was initiated. This initial pioneering effort by Bradford and his associates bore fruit on November 19, 1898, when the Anti-Imperialist Committee of Correspondence formally established itself as the Anti-Imperialist League.

=== Structure ===
The Anti-Imperialist League was administered by three permanent officers—a President, Secretary, and Treasurer—working in conjunction with a six-member Executive Committee. Unsurprisingly given the localized origins of the organization, the initial members of this leadership group all hailed from the Boston metropolitan area. Chosen as the high-profile President of the League was former Massachusetts Governor, Congressman, and United States Senator George S. Boutwell, who would remain in the position until his death in 1905. Practical day-to-day executive operations were placed in the hands of Secretary Erving Winslow.

In addition to its Boston-based governing center, the Anti-Imperialist League also included a large list of public figures of national reputation who were enlisted as Vice-Presidents of the organization. This post was essentially ceremonial but was important in providing legitimacy to the organization. A total of 18 Vice-Presidents were named at the time of the November formation of the league, including among them former President of the United States Grover Cleveland, ex-US Senator and Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz, industrialist Andrew Carnegie, and labor leader Samuel Gompers.

During the first half of 1899 the number of &quot;paper&quot; Vice-Presidents of the League was boosted to 40, with a number of leading politicians and intellectuals added to the League&#x27;s letterhead. Included among these were religious philosopher Felix Adler, former Iowa Governor William Larrabee, Republican Congressman Henry U. Johnson, and Stanford University president David Starr Jordan.

Shortly after this expansion, the Executive Committee of the League voted to move the offices of the organization to Washington, D.C., to be better situated for influencing American political leaders. Despite this decision to establish a nexus in the nation&#x27;s capital, main operations of the organization remained in Boston. The decision to move to Washington was made moot with the establishment of an autonomous Washington Anti-Imperialist League in the fall of 1899. This affiliated group concentrated its efforts on the lobbying of national politicians and removed any need for the Boston-based national organization to shift its headquarters. The Anti-Imperialist League would remain based in Boston for the duration of its existence.

=== Local organizations ===
The Anti-Imperialist League attempted to establish a network of local organizations in an effort to decentralize and expand the group&#x27;s propaganda efforts. The group&#x27;s largest and most influential local affiliates were located in New York City, Philadelphia, Washington, DC, Chicago, Minneapolis, Cincinnati, Portland, Oregon, and Los Angeles.

In February 1899 the national office of the Anti-Imperialist League would peg the group&#x27;s total membership at &quot;considerably over 25,000.&quot; The total number of local branches of the group was reckoned as &quot;at least 100&quot; by November of that year.

Local groups maintained a substantial degree of autonomy and often had unique local monikers, including the American League of Philadelphia and the Anti-Imperialist League of New York. The roster of officers of the New York branch was nearly as expansive and impressive as that of the original Boston organization, including a corps of 23 Vice-Presidents.

=== Three leagues become one ===
In October 1899 a Chicago group inspired by the Boston organization which had previously styled itself as the Central Anti-Imperialist League held a convention merging with another organization to form the American Anti-Imperialist League. This organization would in turn merge with the Boston-based Anti-Imperialist League in the following month, rechristening the Boston organization as the New England branch of the American Anti-Imperialist League. Despite this formal organizational change, the Boston office remained the leading center of the anti-imperialist movement nationwide.

In 1904, the vital Boston organization was reestablished as the headquarters of the organization. Throughout it all, the loosely affiliated local Leagues would conduct their own activities, electing their own officers and producing their own publications.

=== Publications ===
One of the primary activities of the Anti-Imperialist League was the production of political leaflets and pamphlets meant to propagandize American imperialist activities. These publications began to emerge immediately in 1898. Included among these were a series of &quot;Broadsides&quot; which made use of extensive quotations from founding fathers of America such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and James Monroe, attempting to demonstrate a fundamental contradiction between the ideas upon which the American republic was founded and designs for colonial expansion being advanced by the nation&#x27;s contemporary political leaders.

Mark Twain, perhaps the most prominent member of the league, offered his voice through the publication of his essay &quot;To the Person Sitting in Darkness,&quot; which appeared in the North American Review in February 1901. In his essay, Twain satirically portrayed the moral and cultural superiority of Americans compared to Filipinos to comment on what he believed to be the great irony of the Philippines&#x27; annexation. Twain successfully gained popular support for the Anti-Imperialist League by claiming that America&#x27;s international role was not to subjugate other nations for material gain, but to see &quot;a nation of long harassed and persecuted slaves set free.&quot;

The Anti-Imperialist League of New York was particularly prominent in the production of propaganda pamphlets, drawing upon the impressive array of writers, public intellectuals, and politicians among its members.

The war that erupted in 1898 with Spain had its origins in the First Cuban Insurrection (1868–1878). The Cuban rebels had formed relationships with small groups of Americans committed to their cause. Many of these Americans supported the filibusters who attempted to run military supplies to the insurrectionists on the island. War had nearly erupted between the United States and Spain in 1873 when the Spanish captured the filibuster ship Virginius and executed most of the crew, including many American citizens. The Treaty of Zanjón signaled a temporary peace, but American sympathies remained with the Cubans desiring independence. When the reforms promised by the treaty proved illusory, the insurrectionists and their American supporters prepared for a new round.

=== Election of 1900 ===
The 1900 presidential election caused internal squabbles in the League. Particularly controversial was the League&#x27;s endorsement of William Jennings Bryan, a renowned anti-imperialist but also the leading critic of the gold standard, a position which alienated a substantial segment of the organization&#x27;s leaders.

A few League members, including Storey and Oswald Garrison Villard, attempted to organize a third party to both uphold the gold standard and oppose imperialism. This effort led to the formation of the National Party, which nominated Senator Donelson Caffery of Louisiana. The party quickly collapsed, however, when Caffery dropped out of the race, leaving Bryan as the only anti-imperialist candidate.
Following the death of George Boutwell in 1905, prominent lawyer and civil rights activist Moorfield Storey would serve as President of the organization, filling that role from 1905 until the League dissolved in 1920.

=== Dissolution ===
Despite its anti-war record, the League did not object to U.S. entry into World War I (though several individual members did oppose intervention). By 1920, it was only a shadow of its former strength, and it disbanded on November 27, 1920.

<text>Rational reconstruction is a philosophical term with several distinct meanings. It is found in the work of Jürgen Habermas and Imre Lakatos.

== Habermas ==

For Habermas, rational reconstruction is a philosophical and linguistic method that systematically translates intuitive knowledge of rules into a logical form. In other words, it is an approach to science and philosophy which attempts to put meanings into language properly. It is a type of formal analysis that makes explicit and systematizes the universal and inescapable conditions for the possibility of certain types of phenomena. Rational reconstruction explicates the deep generative structures that give rise to and allow for particular performances, behaviours, and other symbolically pre-structured realities. It is a procedure that is intimately tied to the interpretation of reality, and can deal with an extremely broad range of questions (but not all).

Habermas sees rational reconstruction as a task appropriate for philosophy. This mode of philosophical reflection can be compared to procedures traditionally taken up in philosophy and is concerned with the questions traditionally posed.

Rational reconstruction is limited to the analysis of symbolically pre-structured realities because it does not deal with the description of reality. So, while the natural sciences generate theoretical knowledge about the general structures of an observable reality, rational reconstructions (sometimes called the reconstructive sciences) generate a theoretical knowledge of the deep structures of a reality accessible only through interpretation. It is hard to point out a phenomenon that is not in some way symbolically pre-structured, that is without some meaning to someone.

While the meaning of any phenomenon must in some way be generated, and the interpretation of symbols is dependent upon intelligence, the bestowal of meaning is not arbitrary. Rational reconstruction attempts to make clear the underlying processes that generate particular meanings. It is concerned with the deep structures of intelligence that generate the knowledge, judgments and actions of subjects as well as the meaning, import and validity of objects. Because of this, those sciences that systematically explicate the intuitive knowledge of competent subjects by reconstructing the pretheoretical know-how of certain human capabilities can be seen as representative of this procedure of rational reconstruction.

Habermas suggests along these lines that &quot;we can distinguish between know-how, the ability of a competent subject who understands how to produce or accomplish something, and know-that, the explicit knowledge of how it is that he is able to do so&quot; (Habermas, 1979). This should be understood in the context of rational reconstruction as two levels of the explication of meaning, two ways of understanding a symbolically pre-structured reality. The difference between the two levels is, in Habermas&#x27;s terms, the content and the intuitively master rule-consciousness that allows for it, or in other terms, surface structures and deep structures. It is worth quoting Habermas at length to clarify this. Here he is discussing these two levels of analysis as applied to the interpretation of a text:&quot;...the understanding of content pursues the connections that link the surface structures of an incomprehensible [symbolic] formation with surface structures, of other, familiar formations. Thus, linguistic expressions can be explicated through paraphrase in the same language [etc.]…. If she cannot attain her end in this way, the interpreter may find it necessary to alter her attitude. She then exchanges the attitude of understanding content (directed towards surface structures)…for an attitude in which she focuses on the generative structures of the expressions themselves. The interpreter then attempts to explicate the meaning of a symbolic formation with the help of the rules according to which the author must have produced it….The attitude changes as soon as the interpreter tries not only to apply the intuitive knowledge of speakers but to reconstruct it. She then turns away from the surface structure of the symbolic formation….She attempts instead to peer into the symbolic formation- penetrating through the surface as it were- in order to discover the rules according to which this symbolic formation was produced…. The object of understanding is no longer the content…but the intuitive rule consciousness.&quot; (Habermas, 1979).Furthermore, following this distinction between surface and deep structures, Habermas views the task of the reconstructive sciences as moving in two directions, horizontal and vertical. The &quot;horizontal&quot; direction seeks to reconstruct fundamental and important competencies, while the &quot;vertical&quot; direction seeks to reconstruct the (genetic) logic of the development of these competencies. So there are surface structures and deep structures related to competencies and sub-competencies, and these are teased apart and reconstructed by engaging two distinct modes of understanding symbolically pre-structured realities.

This should clarify what it is that rational reconstructions seek to accomplish. It should also be said that the results of systematized reconstructions claim to explicate &quot;universal capabilities and not merely the particular competencies of individual groups&quot; (Habermas, 1979). The theoretical claims of such rational reconstructions have the status of general theories of human competencies and behavior. &quot;When the pretheoretical knowledge to be reconstructed expresses a universal capability, a general cognitive, linguistic, or interactive competence (or sub-competence), then what begins as an explication of meaning aims at the reconstruction of species competencies&quot; (Habermas, 1979).

These kinds of rational reconstructions are notably different from the purely philosophical but comparable solutions and methods offered up as definitive answers to such issues in the past. Kant&#x27;s transcendental analysis sought to deduce the categorical framework that structured and determined experience. Hegel&#x27;s dialectic sought to systematize the process of knowing, fitting each stage of insight as a defined moment to be subsumed in the development of absolute knowledge. These great systems were conceived as being a-priori, inescapably generative of all experience and knowledge, and they were understood to be factual, to be the truth. Habermas sees rational reconstruction as a similar, but less grandiose, undertaking:

&quot;Marked down in price the transcendental and dialectical modes of justification may still come in handy. All they can fairly be expected to furnish, however, is reconstructive hypotheses for use in empirical settings….[Rational reconstructions are] fallibilistic in orientation, they reject the dubious faith in philosophy&#x27;s ability to do things single handedly, hoping instead that the success that has for so long eluded it might come from an auspicious matching of different theoretical fragments (Habermas, 1990a).&quot;

Furthermore:….[In rational reconstruction] the distinction between drawing on a-priori knowledge and drawing on a-posteriori knowledge becomes blurred. On the one hand, the rule consciousness [i.e. intuitive know-how] of competent subjects is for them an a-priori knowledge; on the other hand, the reconstruction of this calls for inquiries undertaken with empirical [methods] (Habermas, 1979).In this respect Habermas sees those theorists whose projects represented a blend of philosophy and scientific methods as important exemplars. He identifies Freud, Durkheim, Mead, Weber, Piaget, Chomsky and Kohlberg as those who &quot;inserted a genuinely philosophical idea like a detonator into a particular context of research…[initiating] paradigms in which a philosophical idea is present in embryo while at the same time empirical, yet universal, questions are being posed&quot; (Habermas, 1990). These theorists approximated the ideal division of labor between philosophy and science that Habermas understands as crucial for progress to be achieved across disciplines; the human sciences in particular represent fertile ground for such cooperation.

== Lakatos ==

Lakatos distinguishes between the &quot;internal&quot; and &quot;external&quot; history of science. Internal history focuses on normative concerns and the reasons scientists can be said to have for accepting or rejecting scientific theories according to some account of the logic of science. External history, on the other hand, focuses on the contingent non-rational factors that influenced the scientific process.

<text>The Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE) is a public finance and economics university located in Shanghai, China. The university is affiliated with the Ministry of Education. It is part of the Double First-Class Construction and Project 211.

In 2005, SUFE introduced the academic tenure and became the first university in China to adopt this system.

==History==
The university began as a business program at the Nanjing Advanced Normal School in 1917. The program was relocated to Shanghai and became the Shanghai University of Commerce in 1921.

Over the years the university had evolved. By 1928, It was renamed as the School of Commerce of the Central University. In 1932, it was split from the Central University and became the National Shanghai College of Commerce. In 1950, the institution became the Shanghai College of Finance and Economics. The institution adopted its present name the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics in 1985. Chen Yun, who was then a top leader of the CPC Politburo Standing Committee, wrote the inscription of the school&#x27;s name.

Since then, SUFE has developed into a multidimensional university which focuses on applied economics and management, with economic theories as its basis. Its subjects include science, social sciences, laws, philosophy and humanities. Its aim is to train students to graduate with practical knowledge, versatile talents and a broad view. In 1997, Chinese President and General Secretary of the Communist Party Jiang Zemin wrote an inscription for the university: &quot;Facing the new century, let us build the Shanghai University of Finance and Economics into a top-level socialist university&quot; (面向新世纪把上海财经大学建设成为具有一流水平的社会主义大学).

== Present ==
At present, the university comprises 12 academic schools, one graduate school and more than 20 finance and economics research centers. It also encompasses the School of Continuing (Adult) Education, the School of Online Learning, the School of International Education, and a vocational school. China&#x27;s rapid economic expansion has tremendously impacted SUFE, which is now bustling with such activities. In 1981, SUFE became the first finance and economics university to receive accreditation for granting doctoral degrees. In addition, it was among the first nine schools to be selected as an &quot;M.B.A. Experimental Education Base&quot; and one of the first schools to set up a post-doctoral program in economics. In 1996, SUFE joined the Project 211. In 2002, SUFE became the first mainland university to offer a master&#x27;s program in Hong Kong. All of its programs continue to exceed world standards and are imbued with modernity, internationalism and cutting-edge information. It is included in the Double First-Class Construction published by the central government of China.

<text>James Michael Surowiecki ( ; born April 30, 1967) is an American journalist. He was a staff writer at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, where he wrote a regular column on business and finance called &quot;The Financial Page&quot;.

==Background==
Surowiecki was born in Meriden, Connecticut, and spent several childhood years in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, where he received a junior high-school education from Southwestern Educational Society (SESO). He is a 1984 graduate of Choate Rosemary Hall and a 1988 alumnus of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where he was a Morehead Scholar. Surowiecki pursued PhD studies in American history on a Mellon Fellowship at Yale University from 1988 to 1995, but did not complete his studies and did not receive a doctoral degree. In 1995, he founded the now-defunct e-magazine &quot;Rogue&quot; and began a career in journalism. He lives in New Haven, Connecticut, and is married to &quot;Slate&quot; culture editor Meghan O&#x27;Rourke.

==Career==
Surowiecki&#x27;s writing has appeared in a wide range of publications, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Motley Fool&quot;, &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;, &quot;Artforum&quot;, &quot;Wired&quot;, &quot;MIT Technology Review&quot;, and &quot;Slate&quot;.

Before joining &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, he wrote “The Bottom Line” column for &quot;New York&quot; magazine and was a contributing editor at &quot;Fortune&quot;.

He got his start on the Internet when he was hired from graduate school by Motley Fool co-founder David Gardner to be the Fool&#x27;s editor-in-chief of its culture site on America Online, entitled &quot;Rogue&quot; (1995–1996). As The Motley Fool closed that site down and focused on finance, Surowiecki made the switch over to become a finance writer, which he did over the succeeding three years, including being assigned to write the Fool&#x27;s column on &quot;Slate&quot; from 1997 to 2000.

In 2002, Surowiecki edited an anthology, &quot;Best Business Crime Writing of the Year&quot;, a collection of articles from different business news sources that chronicle the fall from grace of various CEOs. In 2004, he published &quot;The Wisdom of Crowds&quot;, in which he argued that, in some circumstances, large groups exhibit more intelligence than smaller, more elite groups, and that collective intelligence shapes business, economies, societies and nations. In an article in the Huffington Post in November 2013, Internet entrepreneur and researcher Neil Seeman drew on social media trends over the time since the publication of &quot;The Wisdom of Crowds&quot; to observe that Mr. Surowiecki had written his observations about collective intelligence &quot;prior to the proliferation of Facebook and Twitter and &#x27;social filtering&#x27;; today, online, we increasingly do not reach any wisdom of any independently-minded crowds. We speak to our friends.&quot;

<doc id="919384" wikidata="Q260899" url="?curid=919384" title="Shot (filmmaking)">
<text>In filmmaking and video production, a shot is a series of frames that runs for an uninterrupted period of time. Film shots are an essential aspect of a movie where angles, transitions and cuts are used to further express emotion, ideas and movement. The term &quot;shot&quot; can refer to two different parts of the filmmaking process:
#In production, a shot is the moment that the camera starts rolling until the moment it stops.
#In film editing, a shot is the continuous footage or sequence between two edits or cuts.

==Etymology==
The term &quot;shot&quot; is derived from the early days of film production when cameras were hand-cranked, and operated similarly to the hand-cranked machine guns of the time. That is, a cameraman would &quot;shoot&quot; film the way someone would &quot;shoot&quot; bullets from a machine gun.

== Categories of shots ==
Shots can be categorized in a number of ways.

===By field size===

The field size explains how much of the subject and its surrounding area is visible within the camera&#x27;s field of view, and is determined by two factors: the distance of the subject from the camera (&quot;camera-subject distance&quot;) and the focal length of the lens. Note that the shorter a lens&#x27;s focal length, the wider its angle of view (the &#x27;angle&#x27; in wide-angle lens, for instance, which is &quot;how much you see&quot;), so the same idea can also be expressed as that the lens&#x27;s angle of view plus camera-subject distance is the camera&#x27;s field of view.
*the long shot or wide shot (often used as an establishing shot), that shows the environment around the subjects,
*the full shot, where the entirety of the subject is just visible within the frame,
*the medium-long shot, where the frame ends near the knees,
*the medium shot, where the frame stops either just above or just below the waist,
*the medium close-up, where more of the shoulder is visible than in the close-up,
*the close-up, where the shoulder line is visible,
*the extreme close-up, where the frame stops at the subject&#x27;s chin and forehead.

Three less often used field sizes are:

*the extreme long shot (used for epic views and panoramas),
*the American shot (also 3/4 shot), a slight variation of the medium-long shot to also include outside the waistband handgun holsters in Western movies, a characterization from French film criticism for a type of shot in certain American films of the 1930s and 1940s also referred to as a &quot;Cowboy shot&quot; in reference to the gun holster being just above the bottom frame line,
*the &quot;Italian shot&quot;, where only a person&#x27;s eyes are visible, named after the genre of Italo-Westerns, particularly the &quot;Dollars Trilogy&quot; by Sergio Leone, that established this particular &quot;field size&quot;.

=== By camera placement ===
&quot;Shots&quot; referring to camera placement and angle rather than field size include:

*Camera angles:
**the aerial shot,
**the bird&#x27;s-eye shot (sometimes performed as a crane shot),
**the low-angle shot,
*the over the shoulder shot,
*the point of view shot,
*the reverse shot is defined as a 180-degree camera turn to the preceding image, common in &quot;point of view&quot; and &quot;over the shoulder&quot; (in the latter, care must be applied to avoid a continuity error by violating the 180 degree rule),
*the two shot where two people are in the picture.

=== By other criteria ===
*the establishing shot is defined by giving an establishing &quot;broad overview&quot; over a scene, whether performed by a wide shot with a fixed camera, a zoom, a series of different close-ups achieved by camera motion, or a sequence of independent close-angle shots edited right after each other,
*the master shot is a scene done in one single take, with no editing
*the freeze frame shot is created in editing by displaying a single frame for an elongated duration of time
*the insert shot is created in editing by replacing a picture with another while the audio stays the same
*the dolly shot, also known as a tracking or trolley shot, in which the camera moves toward or away from its subject while filming. Traditionally dolly shots are filmed from a camera dolly but the same motion may also be performed with a Steadicam or gimbal. A dolly shot is generally described in terms of &quot;dollying in&quot; or &quot;dollying out&quot;.

== Film editing ==

Cutting between shots taken at different times or from different perspectives is known as film editing, and is one of the central arts of filmmaking.

==Duration==
The length of shots is an important consideration that can greatly affect a film. The purpose of editing any given scene is to create a representation of the way the scene might be perceived by the &quot;story teller.&quot; Shots with a longer duration can make a scene seem more relaxed and slower-paced whereas shots with a shorter duration can make a scene seem urgent and faster-paced.

The average shot length (ASL) of a film is one of its cinemetrical measures. For example, &quot;The Mist&quot; has a length of 117 minutes and consists of 1292 shots, so the ASL is 5.4 seconds, while &quot;Russian Ark&quot; is a single 96-minute long take, so an ASL of 96 minutes or about 5,760 seconds, a factor of 1,000 difference.

Shots with extremely long durations are difficult to do because any error in the shot would force the filmmaker to restart from scratch, and are thus only occasionally used. Films famous for their long cuts include Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s &quot;The Godfather&quot; in which the entire first scene is a long take featuring Bonasera describing the assault on his daughter, and Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rope&quot;, which only cuts at the end of each reel, and does so surreptitiously so that it seems as if the whole film is one take. Orson Welles&#x27;s &quot;Touch of Evil&quot; opens with a long tracking crane shot, as does Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Player&quot;.

In addition to Russian Ark, which was made in 2002 using digital recording technology, other films known for their extremely long takes include Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and the works of Andrei Tarkovsky starting with &quot;Solaris&quot;. Béla Tarr is also known for using very long takes consistently in his films. Joss Whedon&#x27;s feature film &quot;Serenity&quot; introduces the main characters with a long take. Although Fish &amp; Cat is a single 134-minute long take, the narrator succeeded in playing with time and including several flashbacks.

<text>The Recruit is a 2003 American spy thriller film directed by Roger Donaldson and starring Al Pacino, Colin Farrell and Bridget Moynahan. It was produced by Spyglass Entertainment in association with Epsilon Motion Pictures and Place Productions, and released by Touchstone Pictures through Buena Vista Pictures Distribution on January 31, 2003. It received mixed reviews from critics, and grossed $101 million worldwide.

== Plot ==

While studying nonlinear cryptography at MIT, James Clayton helps to create &quot;Spartacus&quot;, a surveillance program that can enslave any computer&#x27;s audiovisual hardware. Showcasing the software at a campus job fair, James impresses a representative from Dell, and is later approached by Walter Burke, who recruits James to join the Central Intelligence Agency.

Hoping to find answers to his father&#x27;s mysterious death in a plane crash in Peru years ago, James passes the initial security screenings and is bused with the rest of his class to the Farm in rural Virginia, where they undergo training as prospective CIA operatives. James develops an attraction to fellow trainee Layla and a rivalry with Zack, his competition for top of the class, while Burke eventually confirms that James&#x27;s father was a spy.

During a public training exercise, James and Layla are abducted by masked assailants, and James is isolated, tortured and interrogated about the Farm and his instructors. After resisting for days, James breaks when he is told about Layla&#x27;s brutal treatment, and he gives up Burke&#x27;s name. The experience is revealed to be an exercise observed by the class, including Layla; James has failed and is removed from the Farm.

Burke seeks a despondent James and explains that his discharge was merely a cover story; that he has been selected as a non-official cover operative (NOC) tasked to investigate Layla, whom Burke suspects is a sleeper agent working to steal the CIA computer virus &quot;ICE-9&quot;, which transmits via the electrical grid and could disable all electrical devices on the planet, thus behaving similarly to the particle from Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s novel &quot;Cat&#x27;s Cradle&quot;.

Under the guise of working in a low-level data-entry position at CIA headquarters, James reunites with Layla, who now works in the agency&#x27;s Directorate of Science &amp; Technology, and they begin a romantic relationship. He discovers evidence of ICE-9 on her computer, so Burke gives him a sidearm. Evading a bug planted by Layla, James witnesses her passing a message to another agent at Union Station. He follows the agent, leading to a shootout, and the man is killed in the scuffle and revealed to be Zack.

James informs Burke and offers to bring in Layla, running her off the road and confronting her at gunpoint. Layla tells James that he is not a NOC, that Zack is, and that she was officially tasked by the agency to steal ICE-9 as part of assessing their security protocols. Letting Layla go, James confronts Burke, who claims that his gun is loaded with blanks, and that Zack&#x27;s death was faked. However, the gun goes off, proving that Burke is the real traitor.

Burke pursues James through an abandoned warehouse, taunting him with an explanation of his plan to manipulate James into acquiring ICE-9 for Burke to sell for $3 million, while incriminating James as a failed operative gone rogue, and declaring that James&#x27;s father was never an agent. James sets up a laptop that runs Spartacus, which fails to connect but leads Burke to believe that it has successfully transmitted his confession to the agency.

Chasing James outside, Burke is met by a CIA strike team led by Farm instructor Dennis Slayne. Believing that they are there to arrest him, Burke launches into a tirade revealing his grievances against the agency, as well as his own crimes, and Slayne directs the team to target Burke instead. Realizing that he has incriminated himself, Burke raises his empty gun and is shot dead. After a tearful embrace with Layla, James is driven to headquarters for a debriefing with Slayne, who alludes that James&#x27;s father was a fellow agent after all.

==Production==
Development on the film was first announced in August 1998. The film was produced by Gary Barber&#x27;s and Roger Birnbaum&#x27;s production company Spyglass Entertainment, with financial support from Disney&#x27;s Touchstone Pictures and German film financing company Epsilon Motion Pictures (which was owned by the Kirch Group at the time). Filming began on December 3, 2001. It was filmed mainly in Toronto and Niagara-on-the-Lake in Canada, with some landmark scenes, such as that from the Iwo Jima Memorial by the Arlington National Cemetery, shot in and around Washington, D.C. The film&#x27;s working title was &quot;The Farm&quot;. James Foley was considered to direct, but was replaced by Donaldson before filming began.

A video game adaptation was proposed by Torus Games for BAM! Entertainment, but the game was retooled into &quot;Ice Nine&quot; before release.

==Reception==
===Box office===
The film was released on January 31, 2003, and earned $16.3 million in its first weekend. Its final gross was $52.8 million in the United States and $48.4 million internationally, for a total of $101.2 million.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes the film holds an approval rating of 44%, based on 165 reviews, with an average rating of 5.55/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus states, &quot;This polished thriller is engaging until it takes one twist too many into the predictable.&quot; Metacritic assigned the film a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B+ on a scale of A+ to F.

Owen Gleiberman of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the film a positive review, with a B+ score. He wrote, &quot;From the get-go, &quot;The Recruit&quot; is one of those thrillers that delights in pulling the rug out from under you, only to find another rug below that.&quot;

Carla Meyer of &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; gave a positive review to the film, stating, &quot;Pacino and Farrell bring a wary curiosity to their early scenes, with Farrell displaying a palpable hunger for praise and Pacino a corresponding mastery of how to hook somebody by parceling out compliments. They&#x27;re a swarthier version of Robert Redford and Brad Pitt in &quot;Spy Game&quot;–only &quot;The Recruit&quot; is more about mind games.&quot;

Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; stated, &quot;The whole picture may be hokey, but the first part is agreeably so, the second part not. At the very least, one comes away with a new appreciation of the difficulty of interoffice romance at the CIA.&quot;

Mike Clark of &quot;USA Today&quot; gave a mixed review to the film, stating, &quot;Nothing is ever what it seems, but still, nothing&#x27;s very compelling in &quot;The Recruit&quot;, a less-than-middling melodrama whose subject matter and talent never click as much as its credits portend.&quot;

===CIA reaction===
In 2009, the movie was reviewed by new CIA employees, who wrote that although &quot;everyone in the Agency believes the movie is ridiculous&quot;, the movie is &quot;entertaining&quot;, and that &quot;all of the covert service trainees watched the film on the bus going into training&quot; for &quot;comic relief&quot;.

According to T.J. Waters (a former Farm student), &quot;The Recruit&quot; is &quot;a mediocre movie&quot; in which he &quot;recognize[s] a lot of similarities with the real Farm&quot;.

<text>Restless () is a 2000 Finnish romantic film directed by Aku Louhimies. It was entered into the 22nd Moscow International Film Festival. The sex scenes in the film sparked uproar and disapproval from the audience and critics after the release. Critic Antti Lindqvist wrote in &quot;Katso&quot; (5/2000) that the director throws more sex scenes and naked women and men on the screen more than anyone since Lauri Törhönen&#x27;s 1986 film &quot;The Undressing&quot;.

&quot;Restless&quot; was followed by &quot;Me and Morrison&quot; (2001) and &quot;Addiction&quot; (2004). &quot;Restless&quot; was co-written by Louhimies and Aleksi Bardy, but they did not participate in the sequels.

==Plot==
The film is about Ari, a 27-year-old ambulance doctor with a terminally ill mother. One-night stands are his main pastime. He does not want to meet any of the girls again because he is certain that commitment equals pain. But one day Ari realises that he cannot feel anything at all. Then he meets a woman named Tiina on the beach. That same day they have sex in Ari&#x27;s apartment and Tiina enters her phone number into Ari&#x27;s in order to exchange contact details. At first Ari ignores Tiina&#x27;s attempts to phone him to the amusement of his married colleague, Roope. Ari subsequently relents and they start dating each other reaching the point where Tiina, falling in love, begins to look for commitment. However, on Ari&#x27;s birthday when Tiina brings him a cake to his apartment she arrives as another woman is leaving. Nonetheless she decides to maintain the relationship with him though expressing her desire for exclusivity.

Ari is later introduced to Tiina&#x27;s friends who include two other couples, Ilona an archaeologist who is dating Stig and Hanna-Riikka a priest who is dating and living with Riku. This introduction takes place as the five pre-existing companions sail to an island to celebrate the Mid-Summer Festival. During this holiday the six have a conversation in which Hanna-Riikka states that man is nothing without belief to which Ari immediately responds: &quot;Then that must mean I am an ape&quot;. The others laugh and Hanna-Riikka walks out. Ilona shows a clear interest in Ari and later initiates a sexual encounter with him. This affair continues for an unspecified length of time during which Ari and Tiina move in together and Hanna-Riikka confronts Ari with her suspicions of what is happening between him and Ilona. When these are confirmed Hanna-Rikka also confronts Ilona about her behaviour and is accused of being a hypocritical lesbian. When the Ilona and Ari decide to have one last episode of intercourse they are discovered by Stig who tells Tiina about the affair and Ari moves out. Riku offers him use of his couch much to Hanna-Riikka&#x27;s displeasure. Meanwhile, Tiina discovers that she is pregnant and later gets a commitment from Ari to resume the relationship with the aim of being a responsible father to their child.

Late one night Ari is called to Roope&#x27;s house because his heavy drinking has precipitated the breakdown of his marriage to Piia. Ari arrives to find Roope with a bottle of spirits and his revolver. After Roope tells him about the fallout of his alcoholism, Ari says that Piia is actually outside sulking in the front garden. Roope asks Ari to talk to his wife because he considers Ari more knowledgeable about how to talk to women and gives Ari his revolver to prevent him from killing himself. Later, when Ari goes to his old apartment Tiina tells him that the hospital has called to inform him of his mother&#x27;s death. The pair attends the funeral together.

Then the film progresses to Tiina and Ilona reconciling, as do Ari and Stig who asks Ari to be his best man as the affair with Ilona apparently helped clarify Stig&#x27;s perspective of the relationship to the point where marriage appeared feasible. The wedding is to be officiated by Hanna-Riikka, who by now has separated from Riku, and to be held on the island where the six earlier holidayed. During one of the drinking games they usually engage in, Hanna-Rikka states that she has never climaxed during sexual intercourse prompting Riku to walk out and the two are later seen arguing. At the reception Ari, in deep contemplation, tells Tiina that they need to talk. Once they are alone Ari states &quot;What are we going to do?&quot; to which Tiina again questions the commitment of Ari by arguing that they should get married. Ari opposes her and says that they should separate. To this, Tiina is shocked, so she proceeds to drink excessively at the wedding prompting Ilona to try stop her. Tiina ends up revealing to the groom that Ari has, in fact, only recently slept with the bride and also the priest. This leads to a confrontation with Ari using the butt of Roope&#x27;s former revolver to knock both Stig and Riku to the ground and he leaves the reception.

The film ends with narrating Ari&#x27;s thoughts as he gets away from it all by physically distancing himself by travelling, Tiina has given birth, Ilona is lecturing while Stig and Riku have maintained their friendship. In the last scene Ari returns to a church where Hanna-Riikka is working.

<text>Bill Richardson (born 1955 in Winnipeg, Manitoba) is a Canadian radio broadcaster and author.

Richardson received his B.A. from the University of Winnipeg in 1976. After spending a year in Montpellier, he moved to Vancouver, where he completed a Master of Library Science at the University of British Columbia. He received an honorary doctorate from Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, Ontario, June 2017.

He was a long-time broadcaster on CBC Radio One, beginning in 1992 as a regular contributor and guest host on Vicki Gabereau&#x27;s show. When Gabereau left to host a television show on CTV, Richardson moved over to CBC Radio Two to host &quot;As You Like It&quot;, a classical music request show. In 1997 he returned to CBC Radio One to become host of &quot;Richardson&#x27;s Roundup&quot;.

He began hosting a new show, &quot;Bunny Watson&quot;, in 2004, and was replaced as host of &quot;The Roundup&quot; by Tetsuro Shigematsu. During the of 2005, he noted in the &quot;CBC Unplugged&quot; staff podcast that he has spent his entire time as a CBC host on contract, rather than as a permanent employee. CBC&#x27;s labour troubles resulted in his return to the air via reruns of &quot;The Roundup&quot;. He was also a frequent guest host of &quot;Sounds Like Canada&quot;, moderated CBC&#x27;s annual &quot;Canada Reads&quot; from 2003 to 2007, and was the host of &quot;Saturday Afternoon at the Opera&quot; and &quot;Sunday Afternoon in Concert&quot; from 2007 until 2013.

Richardson&#x27;s book &quot;Bachelor Brothers&#x27; Bed and Breakfast&quot; won the Stephen Leacock Medal for Humour in 1994.
Richardson now makes regular appearances on the Knowledge Network for its fundraising.

He is currently working on a musical based on Craigslist ads entitled &quot;do you want what I have got? a Craigslist Cantata&quot; with Veda Hille and Amiel Gladstone.

<doc id="919432" wikidata="Q7626839" url="?curid=919432" title="Stuart McLean">
<text>Andrew Stuart McLean, (April 19, 1948 – February 15, 2017) was a Canadian radio broadcaster, humorist, monologist, and author, best known as the host of the CBC Radio program &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot;. Often described as a &quot;story-telling comic&quot; although his stories addressed both humorous and serious themes, he was known for fiction and non-fiction work which celebrated the decency and dignity of ordinary people, through stories which often highlighted the ability of their subjects, whether real or fictional, to persevere with grace and humour through embarrassing or challenging situations.

==Personal life==
McLean was born in Montreal West, the eldest of three children to Australian immigrant parents, Andrew McLean and Margaret Godkin. His interest in radio programming developed during childhood when his father gifted him a Motorola radio to pass the time during an illness. This early fascination with radio persisted into adulthood, shaping McLean&#x27;s career trajectory in media and journalism.

McLean was educated at Lower Canada College and Bishop&#x27;s College School in Quebec. He admitted to feeling like an outsider to the other students at the private school, feeling neither athletic enough nor smart enough to fit in. McLean graduated from Sir George Williams University with a B.A. degree in 1971. Following his graduation, he worked in student services for Dawson College, and as campaign manager for Nick Auf der Maur in his first Montreal City Council election.

McLean married Linda Read, a potter, in 1982. They had two children together, Robert and Andrew, and McLean was stepfather to Read&#x27;s son, Christopher Trowbridge, from her first marriage. McLean and Read later divorced in 2002.

He was also a sponsor of the YMCA&#x27;s Camp Kanawana, establishing a charitable fund to provide financial support for underprivileged youth to attend the camp, and served as honorary colonel of the Canadian Armed Forces&#x27; 8 Air Maintenance Squadron at CFB Trenton.

==Media career==
=== Early work ===
McLean first joined CBC Radio as a researcher for &quot;Cross Country Checkup&quot; in 1974, later becoming a documentarian for the radio program &quot;Sunday Morning&quot;. He won an ACTRA Award in 1979 for &quot;Operation White Knight&quot;, his &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; documentary about the Jonestown Massacre. From 1981 until 1983 he was the show&#x27;s executive producer.

McLean was a professor of journalism at Ryerson University from 1984 until 2004, when he retired and became a professor emeritus. When he died in 2017, former students of McLean recalled how he concerned himself with their success in the journalism industry. CTV reporter Scott Lightfoot remarked, &quot;I went to university twice, I took a lot of courses, I never had another professor offer to make phone calls on my behalf.&quot;

During the 1980s and 1990s, he was a frequent contributor to and sometime guest host of &quot;Morningside&quot;, for which he often produced human interest documentaries and audio essays about everyday people and places. He would later characterize his &quot;Morningside&quot; work as celebrating &quot;the importance of being unimportant&quot;, and as ultimately helping him find his own voice as a writer. &quot;Morningside&quot; host Peter Gzowski remembered fondly the work McLean did for the program: ”On the surface, they seemed inconsequential, but in fact they were exquisitely crafted pieces of journalism.”

McLean eventually compiled a selection of his work for &quot;Morningside&quot; in his first book, &quot;The Morningside World of Stuart McLean&quot;. The book was a Canadian bestseller and a finalist for the 1990 Toronto Book Awards. Following the success of his first book, McLean was approached by Penguin Books to write a travel memoir about life in small-town Canada. Released in 1992, &quot;Welcome Home: Travels in Smalltown Canada&quot; featured stories from seven small communities, and won the Canadian Authors Association for best non-fiction book in 1993.

McLean often reported for CBC news programs &quot;The Journal&quot; and &quot;The National&quot;, where he focused on human interest stories, talking to &quot;regular people&quot; and delving into their often funny or poignant experiences. These segments about everyday people helped to inspire &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot;, which in the same vein looked at the lives of average Canadians.

=== &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot; ===

In 1994, McLean launched &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot; as a summer series featuring stories about a fictional second-hand record store. Although the early stories focused on a diverse group of characters loosely linked through the titular Vinyl Cafe record store, by the time the series became a permanent one the stories were focused more squarely on the store&#x27;s proprietor, Dave, and his family and friends. Following the show&#x27;s second summer run in 1995, McLean published &quot;Stories from the Vinyl Cafe&quot;, his first book in that series. The show joined CBC&#x27;s permanent regular-season schedule in 1997.

Beginning in 1998, McLean took &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot; on the road to theatres across Canada and the United States. Some stories would be repeated at multiple shows—in particular, an early story about Dave&#x27;s awkward attempt to cook a turkey for Christmas dinner became one of the most famous and most frequently performed stories of McLean&#x27;s career—but McLean would often perform slightly different versions of the stories to keep his audiences engaged. One episode of &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot; each year was also dedicated to the &quot;Arthur Awards&quot;, McLean&#x27;s own awards program to honour acts of kindness and community engagement by ordinary Canadians that might otherwise &quot;go unheralded and even unnoticed&quot;.

&quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot; was broadcast every weekend on CBC Radio, and later as a weekly podcast. McLean&#x27;s books of stories from &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot; won the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour three times. Several albums of his performances of &quot;Vinyl Cafe&quot; stories were also released. In the 2010s a spinoff edition, &quot;Vinyl Café Stories&quot;, aired on CBC Radio in a weekday afternoon time-slot, featuring two previously broadcast stories on interrelated themes.

==Cancer treatment and death==
Following McLean&#x27;s diagnosis with melanoma in November 2015, &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&quot; stopped touring and producing episodes. McLean announced on December 13, 2016, that he required a second round of treatment, meaning further delay in producing episodes, and that repeats of past shows would stop airing on CBC Radio One effective January 2017 to &quot;make room for others to share their work on the radio.&quot; McLean died of cancer on February 15, 2017, in Toronto, aged 68. His archive was donated to McMaster University.

One day after his death in February 2017, a tribute special hosted by Michael Enright under the title &quot;Canada&#x27;s Storyteller: A Tribute to Stuart McLean&quot;, aired on CBC Radio; it was repeated the following Sunday in &quot;The Vinyl Cafe&#x27;s&quot; former timeslot. CBC Radio&#x27;s documentary series &quot;The Doc Project&quot; produced a special episode after McLean&#x27;s death, re-airing his 1979 &quot;Sunday Morning&quot; documentary &quot;The New Goldrush&quot;, while &quot;Cross Country Checkup&quot; devoted a tribute episode to its own version of the Arthur Awards, asking callers to share stories of acts of kindness that had made a difference in their lives. In April 2018, &quot;Cross Country Checkup&quot; devoted a second episode to the question &quot;Who would you nominate for Stuart McLean&#x27;s Arthur Awards?&quot;

<text>Paul Erdmann Isert (1756 – 21 January 1789) was a German-Danish surgeon, botanist and planter

He was the first scientist to identify the bird Red Bishop (Euplectes orix franciscana (Isert)&#x27;. He is also known for his attempts to end the Danish-Norwegian slave trade.

==Biography==
Isert was born in Angermünde, Brandenburg, but educated in Berlin. He was appointed Chief Surgeon to Christiansborg (Osu, Accra) in Danish Guinea, arriving there in 1783. He sought this position because of his burning desire to collect plant specimens from West Africa. Once there, realizing that the inhabitants had no written language, he felt it his duty to record – for future generations – details of all aspects of life on the Gold Coast, as he observed them, thus creating an ethnographic, as well as botanical, work.

After nearly three years on the Gold Coast Isert abruptly determined to leave the country on the first possible ship back to Europe. This was due to his extreme frustration at being hindered from exploring in Ashanti. It was on this ship, a slave ship en route from Danish Guinea, on the second day at sea, that he witnessed a slave rebellion on the open sea, which almost cost him his life. The cargo of 452 blacks rose against the whites, with a resulting loss of 34 of their number and 2 of the crew wounded after a heated battle. In the West Indies, he visited Saint Croix, Saint. Thomas, Saint John, Guadeloupe and Martinique.
Sickened by the horror and human misery he saw, both in the slave-processing dungeons of Christiansborg, aboard the ship, and on the sugar plantations, Isert came up with an alternative to the abhorrent practice of the transatlantic slave trade. He found it not only inhumane, cruel and immoral, but also absurdly stupid. In a letter sent from Saint Croix in 1787 to his father, Isert asked questions:

:Why were our forefathers not sensible enough to establish plantations right there in the fertile continent of Africa; plantations for sugar, coffee, cacao, cotton and other articles that had become so necessary in Europe?

:&quot;...if we had come to them with an olive branch in our hand instead of murderous steel, the natives would willingly have given us access to the best and most fertile parts of their lands, areas which for untold years had been lying desolate.&quot;

These African people would have helped us in freedom and, for low wages would have given us greatness and riches with no offense against nature, or our personal and national consciences.

Why did we have to uproot vast numbers of people from their homelands, subject them to agony, torture, humiliation, and death; transplant them to alien continents, Caribbean islands, big and small? Why?

Isert wanted to demonstrate that the establishment of working plantations on the continent of Africa could be practical and profitable. To this end, he enlisted the aid of Ernst Heinrich von Schimmelmann, who was then the Danish-Norwegian Minister of Finance. Schimmelmann, a well-known and well-off liberal, who was later instrumental in the passage of the law ending the Danish-Norwegian transatlantic slave trade, agreed to finance Isert&#x27;s endeavour.

In 1788, Isert published his famous book &quot;Reise nach Guinea und den Caribäischen Inseln in Columbia&quot; (Journey to Guinea and the Caribbean Islands in Columbia), wherein he described his experiences with, and his views on, the slave trade. Later in the summer, he sailed for Africa and established a crown plantation, Frederiksnopel, near Akropong in the fertile and cool Akwapim Hills reminiscent of the Mediterranean, purchasing the land from the Akwapim chief, Nana Obuobi Atiemo, on behalf of the King Christian VII of Denmark. Isert and Nana Obuobi Atiemo had been comrades-in-arms during a war in 1783, waged at the Volta River, and had evidently formed a lasting friendship.
With the help of Nana Obuobi Atiemo, who shared Isert&#x27;s enthusiasm about the plan, paid African workers and the European group that had accompanied Isert, cleared the land and planted only easily cultivated plants, for their own sustenance. Trade products, such as sugar and cotton, would be put off until later.

On 16 January 1789, Isert wrote a report to the King of Denmark in which he expressed the fine initial success that he was enjoying. Isert died on 21 January 1789, just five days after writing the report. It was believed that Isert had died from a tropical fever. His wife, Dorothea Elisabeth Plum died a short time after the birth of their child, a daughter, who also died, a month later, on 8 March. Isert&#x27;s assistants attempted to carry on the project at Frederiksnopel, as did some others, but it failed due to various factors; such as distance from the sea, lack of support, and competition from Christiansborg.

Convinced of the feasibility of the plantations, an edict was issued in the name of King Christian VII by his son Prince Frederick (who was then Regent because of his father&#x27;s mental illness) on 16 March 1792, which came into effect on 1 January 1803. Denmark-Norway thus bears the honour of being the first established sovereign state to prohibit the transatlantic slave trade. But ultimately, the experimental plantations proved to be unsuccessful.

<text>Reinhard Günzel (born April 5, 1944, in The Hague) is a former German general. He joined the Bundeswehr in 1963. He commanded the parachute battalion in Merzig, a Jägerregiment in Trier and the Jägerbrigade in Frankenberg. He also studied history and philosophy in Tübingen. He was the commander of the Kommando Spezialkräfte (KSK) from November 2000 until November 2003.

Günzel was dismissed in 2003 because he expressed his solidarity with antisemitic statements by Christian Democratic Union member of the federal parliament Martin Hohmann. Günzel send a letter supporting Hohmann, and his speech that compared &quot;the actions of Jews in the 1917 Russian revolution with those of the Nazis&quot;. Günzel was fired from his position as General by Defence Minister Peter Struck. Hohmann became a member of the far-right Alternative for Germany.

Günzel is the author of &quot;Secret Warriors&quot;, a book in which, according to a 2020 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;he placed the KSK in the tradition of a notorious special forces unit under the Nazis that committed numerous war crimes [( Brandenburgers )], including massacres of Jews. He has been a popular speaker at far-right events&quot;.

<text>The University of the Andes (), also commonly self-styled as Uniandes, is a private research university located in the city centre of Bogotá, Colombia. Founded in 1948 by a group of Colombian intellectuals led by Mario Laserna Pinzón, it was the first Colombian university established as nonsectarian (independent from any political party or religious institution). 

The university is academically composed of nine schools, three special academic entities—the Alberto Lleras Camargo School of Government, the Center for Research and Training in Education (, CIFE), and the Interdisciplinary Center for Development Studies (, CIDER)—and a joint academic venture with the medical institution Santa Fe de Bogotá Foundation, offering 31 undergraduate, 18 doctoral, and 38 graduate degree-granting programs in areas of human knowledge such as medicine, engineering, science, law and others.

As of 2011, the university had produced 128 research groups recognized by Colciencias, most of them in the social sciences, mathematics, physics and engineering. By 2017, the number of groups recognized by Colciencias has increased to 153 research groups. It is one of the few Colombian universities to have received the maximum high quality institutional accreditation by the Colombian Ministry of Education, given in January 2015.

==History==
===Historical context===
In 1930, the Colombian presidential elections resulted in the appointment of Liberal party candidate Enrique Olaya Herrera to an office that had been, since 1880, under Conservative control. The latter years of this Conservative Republic were punctuated by events such as the Banana massacre, which may have been a contributing factor to the Colombian Conservative Party&#x27;s loss of the presidency.

During this new period of Liberal government, known as the Liberal Republic, the administrations of Alfonso López Pumarejo (1934-1938 and 1942–1946) implemented changes intended to modernize the country. Restructuring of higher education, in particular of the National University of Colombia in 1935, agrarian reform in 1936, and general promotion of industrialization resulted in rapid economic changes and growth. According to some estimates, around 50% of existing Colombian corporations in 1945 were founded between 1940 and 1945, promoting the accumulation of wealth and the creation of a new middle class with political interests and international aspirations.

However, in order to continue industrial development, there was an urgent need for skilled labor, reflected in the speech given by the Colombian Minister of Education to the Congress of Colombia in 1946:

These words echo the suggestions made around 35 years earlier by liberal leader Rafael Uribe Uribe regarding the need for the modernization of the educational system. These intellectual currents were coherent with previous educational developments such as the foundation of the Gimnasio Moderno in 1914. Amid the political tension and violence caused by the loss of liberal power in the 1946 elections, social unrest, and industrial growth, leftist liberal presidential candidate Jorge Eliécer Gaitán was assassinated on April 9, 1948, in an event that shook the country and was taken by the founders as &quot;the best argument for the foundation of the university&quot;.

===Foundation and early years (1949-1955)===
In November 1948, around a year after arriving back in Colombia from Columbia University, accompanied by intellectuals from the elites of both traditional parties, Mario Laserna Pinzón founded the Universidad de los Andes as the first nonsectarian and non-politically affiliated university in Colombia. The main goals with the establishment of the university were to provide Colombia with professionals whose technical knowledge benefited the development of the country, which made it necessary for them to study abroad and bring this knowledge back; and who would become leaders of their nation in the post-war world, facilitated by founders, faculty, and staff occupying important posts in government and institutions. In practice, Uniandes would be modeled after the American university, and its students would receive not only technical but also liberal education, in accordance to the need for the development of the human intellect for a practical, altruistic purpose, as per the Declaration of the Principles of the Founders.

Classes started on 29 March, 1949, with only 80 students taking courses from a small set of faculties and schools. Of note was the &quot;Colegio de Estudios Superiores&quot;, or &quot;college&quot;, which was modeled on the American university college and had the responsibilities of offering classes on Humanities, Spanish, English, Contemporary Civilization, and Colombian Geography &amp; History. Classes belonging to distinct curricula, but not specific to each, such as mathematics for Engineering and Architecture students, were also the responsibility of the &quot;college&quot;. By the second academic year, in 1950, there were around 400 applications for 110 places of study in Uniandes.

Increasing political violence in Colombia during the 1950s did not change the university&#x27;s stance towards political neutrality, and the inclusion of government representatives in the Board, as well as rectors and administrative staff belonging to both Conservative and Liberal parties, ensured good relations with conservative, military, and liberal Colombian administrations.

Starting in 1950, the &quot;three/two&quot; program was established at first with the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Through it, Uniandes students were able to course 5 semesters, or three years, at home, and then transfer to an American university to complete their undergraduate program. Participating universities included Pittsburgh, MIT, Vanderbilt, and Texas, among others. The funds for tuition expenses in the United States were initially provided by Colombian industries such as Avianca and Paz del Río Steelworks; American philanthropic institutions (the Rockefeller Foundation); and Colombian, Canadian, and American private individuals. To manage these assets, the university hired ICETEX, a government agency established by University founder and then-Minister of Education Gabriel Betancourt, whose objective was to promote Colombian students abroad through grants and scholarships.

Throughout the early 1950s, diverse experiments were carried out by the University as per its aspirations to fulfill the needs of its country and become an internationally recognized institution. Some of them failed, such as the Faculty of Aeronautic Sciences, due to low student interest; the Institute for Conservation of Natural Resources, which granted non-professional degrees on its subject matter; and the Preparatory Lyceum of Pereira, intended to equip high school students of this city with the necessary tools to thrive in Uniandes. Important successes were attained by the Cultural Extension Section: the organization of academic conferences whose speakers included the likes of John von Neumann, Arnold J. Toynbee, Hideki Yukawa, Thornton Wilder, and others. The subjects and structure of these conferences would give way to the establishment of the Female Section of the university in 1953, though its programs of study did not confer professional degrees. Active recruitment of foreign professors from abroad and from other Colombian educational institutions, such as the National University, the Normal Superior School, and the Gimnasio Moderno, was also an important strategy for the administrative staff in the initial years of Uniandes.

== Administration and organization ==
The university was legally established as a common-utility nonprofit corporation in February 1948. The Colombian government granted it University status in 1964. , the Statutes that define the university&#x27;s structure were last amended and ratified in 2009. Uniandes&#x27; organs of government are the Board of Trustees, the Board of Directors, the Rector (president), one or more Vice-Rectors, a Secretary, the Academic Council, the Deans, the Faculty Councils, and support administrative officers. 

The Board of Trustees is the supreme organ of the university, tasked with setting its general policies, having the power to amend the Statutes. The board has 30-45 members at all times, 2 of which must be Professors, and 2 of which must be students. The Board of Directors is responsible for the management and administration of the university, through reviews and approvals of the PDI (Programa de Desarrollo Integral): a 5-year development program prepared by the office of the Rector. The latter is the university&#x27;s legal representative, and it is responsible for implementing the PDI, setting the budgets, and appointing Departmental, Research Center, and Administrative Unit directors. The Deans are the administrative heads of each faculty, and together with the Rector, Vice-Rectors, and Directors of academic units, they comprise the Academic Council, entrusted with disciplinary and academic matters (such as modifying and terminating academic programs and units).

There are 14 academic units: 10 faculties, the CIDER (), the Alberto Lleras Camargo School of Government, Conecta-te (), and the dean of students. The academic units are home to 745 non-faculty staff as of 2021. There is a total of 20 Administrative Units, which accrue an additional 853 non-faculty staff.

According to a financial audit performed by Ernst &amp; Young Colombia in 2020, the value of the university&#x27;s assets totaled equating to at the COP/USD exchange rate for 31 December 2020. These amounts comprise cash and cash equivalents, investments, intangible assets, investment properties, among others.

=== Mission ===
The university&#x27;s Statutes state:
== Staff ==
 Los Andes&#x27; faculty members were mainly full-time academics, of whom 70% had a PhD from a top university in the world. Los Andes has traditionally supported instructors in undertaking their master&#x27;s and PhD studies in different subject areas in renowned foreign universities.

== Student population ==
* 55% male, 45% female
* 30% come from outside Bogotá.
* 95% of the undergraduate students were the top 1% high school students in the country.

== Academic structure ==
Students can register in classes from all academic programs offered at Los Andes; this interdisciplinary approach allows students to design their own curricular program, with the assistance of academic advisors. The following scheme shows the academic structure at Uniandes, which includes four cycles: a Basic Professional Cycle (CBP, in Spanish), which refers to the basic subjects belonging to each program; a Cycle of Elective Courses in Socio-humanistic issues (CSH, in Spanish), common to all programs and that offers about 180 courses; a Professional Cycle (CP, in Spanish), which includes the main professional subject for each program; and a Professional Complementary Cycle (CPC), which includes subjects from the specific program and subjects from other programs.

== International students ==

International students can attend the university as visiting students, who must be enrolled in at least three courses per semester, or exchange students, who can take between two and six courses per semester. Los Andes has academic exchange programs with more than 119 universities in 34 countries worldwide.

== Campus ==


Uniandes started academic activities in terrains rented from the Community of the Good Shepherd, a religious institution, and would continue to do so for around five years before buying the first plots of land, with a size of approximately 0.025 square kilometers. Included in the purchase were several buildings that were used by the religious community, such as a convent and a prison for women. Due to the low university population, the existing buildings were mostly restored and conditioned to provide adequate facilities for academic activities.

The campus is largely made up of a mixture of renovated industrial and religious buildings and newly constructed facilities. The infrastructure covers 180,551 sq mt and includes approximately 116 classrooms, 219 laboratories, a central library, and five satellite libraries (specialized by areas), where more than 445,000 books are available for students. It also has 26 computer rooms and six service units that hire out laptops, offering nearly 2,000 computers for student use (16.5 computers for each 100 students). As of 2017, there are 3,019 computers available for student use in the computer rooms.

In 1956 a metallic cylindrical structure now known as &quot;La Caneca &quot;(the Trash Bin) was installed on campus. &quot;La Caneca &quot; is the sports center of the university and it is composed of a gym, a pool, and various courts for sports like tennis, squash, and football.

The university&#x27;s campus is in Bogota&#x27;s historical center, an area that houses most of the city&#x27;s buildings of cultural interest, universities, banks, and large Colombian companies; the main offices of the national and local government; and a variety of cultural meeting places, such as libraries, museums, theatres, scientific and literary centers, and art galleries.

Also on campus are:
* Central cafeteria and many other food stations inside and outside the campus
* Gym and sports facilities
* Health services
* Rest and study areas

In addition to the main campus, the university also has an Internships Center for the Medicine Faculty, located at the Fundación Santa Fe de Bogotá, in the northern part of the city. Uniandes and Fundación Santa Fe—one of the most renowned medical institutions in the country—engage in a joint academic venture.

== Rankings ==

== Mascot ==
The mascot of Uniandes is a goat called Seneca, after Lucius Annaeus Seneca, the Roman Stoic philosopher. Its story dates back to the late 1940s when a goat roamed the campus freely. Students adopted it, and it soon became a symbol of the university. The goat died in 1966 when it fell off a cliff. Today it is not possible to keep a goat on campus, but Seneca is fondly remembered. The wireless spots are named after the goat, and every year a goat is brought to the university to celebrate &quot;Students&#x27; Day.&quot;

<doc id="919468" wikidata="Q3153706" url="?curid=919468" title="Intrawest">
<text>Intrawest Resorts Holdings, Inc. was a developer and operator of destination resorts and a luxury adventure travel company. The company was founded in 1976 as a privately funded real estate development company. In 2006, Intrawest was purchased by Fortress Investment Group, a private equity investment company, which resulted in the company being delisted from the Toronto Stock Exchange and New York Stock Exchange. Fortress was under financial pressure related to the Intrawest debt, but a new loan with a single lender was completed in April 2010 and all prior lenders were repaid in full.

In recent years, Intrawest has strengthened its cash flows, despite 2012 proving to be a challenging year for the American ski industry with warmer than normal temperatures and snowfall at 50% of historical averages. Western Canada experienced above average and record snowfall amounts in some areas.

In May 2017, it was announced that Intrawest would no longer exist as a public company after its acquisition by Henry Crown and Company and KSL Capital Partners. Intrawest resorts are now operated by Alterra Mountain Company, which announced its new name at the 2018 Outdoor Retailer show in Denver, Colorado.

==History==

In 1986, Intrawest acquired Blackcomb Mountain from the Federal Business Development Bank, a Canadian Crown Corporation, and Fortress Mountain of Alberta (no relation to Fortress Investments LLC), a wholly owned division of Aspen Skiing Company. The company later went public, listed on the Toronto and New York Stock Exchanges and, in 1996, merged with Whistler Mountain Ski Corporation to form Whistler-Blackcomb resort, a venue of the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympic Games. Intrawest eventually spun off Whistler-Blackcomb and sold the last of its shares in that company in 2012.

Today, the Intrawest network includes mountain resorts. Intrawest also operates Club Intrawest, a private resort club with nine locations in North America. The company is the largest developer and operator of resort properties in North America offering skiing, snowboarding, golf, mountain biking, lodging, and real estate opportunities at each of its resorts. Intrawest develops real estate at its resorts and at other locations across North America. The company owns Canadian Mountain Holidays, the largest heli-skiing operation in the world.

On November 12, 2013, Intrawest filed an initial public offering (IPO) with the New York Stock Exchange to raise up to $100 Million. The filing states that the money is being raised, &quot;for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include potential investments in, and acquisitions of, ski and adventure travel businesses and assets.&quot;

In 2016, Intrawest initiated significant reductions in full time staff to achieve rapid cost reductions. Numerous key staff positions have been eliminated at its corporate headquarters and resort locations. This follows the sale of the Club Intrawest time share lodging operation to Diamond Resorts International at the end of 2015. It is unclear regarding the company&#x27;s longer term strategies as it continues to display inconsistent approaches in its business and staffing model. In 2017, Intrawest was sold to Henry Crown and Company (which owns Aspen Skiing Company) and KSL Capital Partners for $1.5 billion. 
In May 2017, it was announced that Intrawest would no longer exist as public company. The newly formed company is called Alterra Mountain Company, which was announced at the 2018 Outdoor Retailer Show in Denver, Colorado.

<doc id="919472" wikidata="Q11843" url="?curid=919472" title="Snow-White and Rose-Red">
<text>&quot;Snow-White and Rose-Red&quot; () is a German fairy tale. The best-known version is the one collected by the Brothers Grimm in 1837 in the third edition of their collection &quot;Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales&quot; (KHM 161). It was first published by Wilhelm Grimm in 1827 in Wilhelm Hauff&#x27;s &quot;Märchen-Almanach&quot;. An older, somewhat shorter version, &quot;The Ungrateful Dwarf&quot;, was written by Caroline Stahl (1776–1837). Indeed, that appears to be the oldest variant; no previous oral version is known, although several have been collected since its publication in 1818. Oral versions are very limited regionally. The tale is of Aarne-Thompson type 426 (&quot;The Two Girls, the Bear, and the Dwarf&quot;).

Despite the presence of one dwarf, this story is not related to the Brothers Grimm fairy tale &quot;Snow White&quot; that provided the basis for the 1937 Walt Disney animated film &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;. The modern German name of that heroine is &quot;Schneewittchen&quot; rather than &quot;Schneeweißchen&quot;. This story has little in common but the similar name of its fair-skinned girl.

==Plot==
Snow-White and Rose-Red are two little girls living with their mother, a poor widow, in a small cottage by the woods. Snow-White is quiet and shy and prefers to spend her time indoors, doing housework and reading. Rose-Red is outspoken, lively and cheerful, and prefers to be outside. They are both very good girls who love each other and their mother dearly, and their mother is very fond of them as well.

One winter night, there is a knock at the door. Rose-Red opens the door to find a bear. At first, she is terrified, but the bear tells her not to be afraid. &quot;I&#x27;m half frozen and I merely want to warm up a little at your place,&quot; he says. They let the bear in, and he lies down in front of the fire. Snow-White and Rose-Red beat the snow off the bear, and they quickly become quite friendly with him. They play with the bear and roll him around playfully. They let the bear spend the night in front of the fire. In the morning, he leaves trotting out into the woods. The bear comes back every night for the rest of that winter and the family grows used to him.

When summer comes, the bear tells them that he must go away for a while to guard his treasure from a wicked dwarf. During the summer, when the girls are walking through the forest, they find a dwarf whose beard is stuck in a tree. The girls rescue him by cutting his beard free, but the dwarf is ungrateful and yells at them for cutting his beautiful beard. The girls encounter the dwarf several times that summer and rescue him from some peril each time, for which he is ungrateful.

Then one day, they meet the dwarf once again. This time, he is terrified because the bear is about to kill him. The dwarf pleads with the bear and begs it to eat the girls. Instead, the bear pays no heed to his plea and kills the dwarf with one swipe of his paw. Instantly, the bear turns into a prince. The dwarf had previously put a spell on the prince by stealing his precious stones and turning him into a bear. The curse is broken with the death of the dwarf. Snow-White marries the prince and Rose-Red marries the prince&#x27;s brother.

==Analysis==
===Tale type===
The tale is classified in the international Aarne-Thompson-Uther Index as tale type ATU 426, &quot;The Two Girls, the Bear, and the Dwarf&quot;: a pair of sisters welcome a bear into their house; the next summer, the girls rescue an ungrateful dwarf three times; at the end of the tale, the bear defeats the dwarf (who cursed him in the first place) and becomes a human prince.

According to scholars Johannes Bolte, Jiri Polívka, Stith Thompson, and Hans-Jörg Uther, the tale, in the Grimm&#x27;s compilation, originated from a story written by author Karoline Stahl and published in 1818.

In an early analysis, German scholar Kurt Ranke noted that the existing variants originated from &quot;Central Europe&quot;: Flanders, France, Germany and Switzerland.

==== Germanic languages ====
German folklorist Hans-Jörg Uther, in the Folktale Catalogue of the German-speaking Area, classifies the tale as type ATU 426, &quot;Schneeweißchen und Rosenrot&quot; (&quot;Snow-White and Rose-Red&quot;), which is sparsely attested in Germanophone areas. In addition, Kurt Ranke argued that the Grimm&#x27;s tale influenced variants collected later, such as &quot;Wittrösken und Rautrösken&quot;.

According to Frisian scholar Jurjen van der Kooi, in the Catalogue of Frisian Folktales, the tale type is also attested in Friesland, but the heroines are named &quot;Blauwoogje&quot; (&quot;Blue-Eyes&quot;) and &quot;Bruin-oogje&quot; (&quot;Brown-Eyes&quot;). In addition, Dutch scholar Theo Meder published a Dutch tale titled &quot;Rozerood en Lelieblank&quot; (&quot;Rose-Red and Lily-White&quot;), from a storyteller from Driebergen, Utrecht, who sent it in 1892 to linguist .

Johannes Bolte and Jiří Polívka cited a tale titled &quot;Rozenroodje&quot;, collected by J. F. Vincx from Hageland (Flanders).

==== Slavic languages ====
The tale type is also attested in the East Slavic Folktale Classification (), indexed as type SUS 426, &quot;Две девушки, медведь (волк) и карлик&quot; (&quot;Two Girls, the Bear/Wolf and the Dwarf&quot;), but only in Russia and Ukraine.

Philologist and folklorist Julian Krzyżanowski, establisher of the Polish Folktale Catalogue according to the international index, located a single Polish variant of type 426, &quot;Narzeczony niedźwiedź&quot; (&quot;The Bear Groom&quot;). However, Krzyżanowski indicated that the tale was a literary reworking that excised the dwarf and introduced other characters.

==== Other areas ====
According to the Latvian Folktale Catalogue, a similar story is found in Latvia, indexed as tale type 426, &quot;Lācis — princis&quot; (&quot;Bear Prince&quot;): two girls shelter a bear and rescue a dwarf; the bear defeats the dwarf and regains human form.

French scholars Paul Delarue and Marie-Louise Thèneze, establishers of the French folktale catalogue, reported only two variants in France of tale type ATU 426, &quot;Les deux fillettes, l&#x27;ours et le nain&quot; (&quot;The Two Little Girls, the Bear and the Dwarf&quot;), which they considered to be retellings of the Grimm&#x27;s story.

<text>John Abeel III (–February 18, 1836) known as Gaiänt&#x27;wakê (&quot;Gyantwachia&quot; – &quot;the planter&quot;) or Kaiiontwa&#x27;kon (&quot;Kaintwakon&quot; – &quot;By What One Plants&quot;) in the Seneca language and thus generally known as Cornplanter, was a Dutch-Seneca chief warrior and diplomat of the Seneca people. As a war chief, Cornplanter fought in the American Revolutionary War on the side of the British. After the war Cornplanter led negotiations with the United States and was a signatory of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784), the Treaty of Canandaigua (1794), and other treaties. He helped ensure Seneca neutrality during the Northwest Indian War.

In the postwar years, Cornplanter endeavoured to learn more about Euro-American culture and invited Quakers to establish schools in Seneca territory. After the War of 1812 he became disillusioned by his people&#x27;s poor reaction to Euro-American society. He had the schools closed and embraced his half-brother Handsome Lake&#x27;s movement to return to traditional Seneca ways and religion.

The United States government granted him about 1500 acres of former Seneca territory in Pennsylvania in 1796 for &quot;him and his heirs forever,&quot; which became known as the Cornplanter Tract. The federal government, however, started construction of the Kinzua Dam on the Allegany River in 1960. When the dam was completed the Cornplanter Tract was flooded and most of the few remaining residents moved to the Allegany Reservation of the federally recognized Seneca Nation of New York. Before flooding occurred the remains of Cornplanter, his descendants, and an 1866 monument to him were relocated.

==Early life==
Cornplanter was born about 1752 at Canawaugus (now in the Town of Caledonia) on the Genesee River in present-day New York State. He was the son of a Seneca woman, Gah-hon-no-neh (She Who Goes to the River), and a Dutch trader, Johannes &quot;John&quot; Abeel II.

The Dutch had settled the Hudson River Valley several generations earlier, and Cornplanter&#x27;s father, an Albany fur trader, was part of an established family. The Abeel family name was sometimes Gaelicized to O&#x27;Bail and O&#x27;Beale. John Abeel II (1722–1794) was connected to the Schuyler family, leaders in business and politics. The grandfather after whom Cornplanter was named, Johannes Abeel I (1667–1711), was a trader and merchant who built up links with the indigenous people along his trade routes, and who served as the second mayor of Albany. The younger John Abeel was a gunsmith and was gladly welcomed into the Iroquois community to repair their guns.

Cornplanter was raised by his mother among the Seneca. His Seneca name, &quot;Gaiänt&#x27;wakê&quot; (often spelled Gyantwachia), means &quot;the planter,&quot; and another variation, &quot;Kaintwakon&quot;, means &quot;by what one plants.&quot; As the Seneca and other Iroquois nations had a matrilineal system of kinship, Cornplanter was considered a member of his mother&#x27;s clan, the Wolf Clan.

==War chief==

When the American Revolutionary War began in 1775, Cornplanter urged the Seneca to remain neutral. He is reported to have said, &quot;War is war. Death is death. A fight is a hard business.&quot;

Initially, both the British and the Americans also wanted the Iroquois to remain neutral. As the war progressed, however, the British began encouraging the Iroquois to &quot;take up the hatchet,&quot; while the Americans sought their continued neutrality. In July 1777, the Seneca met with John Butler, a deputy superintendent in the British Indian Department at Irondequoit to discuss whether to abandon their neutrality. Although Cornplanter strongly opposed becoming involved, the Seneca eventually agreed to actively support the British against the Americans. Cornplanter honoured that decision.

Because of the status of the Seneca as &quot;elder brothers&quot; among the Iroquois, most of the Iroquois Confederacy followed suit. The Oneida and the Tuscarora, however, strongly influenced by the missionaries such as Samuel Kirkland, resolved to support the Americans instead. Cornplanter and Sayenqueraghta were named as war chiefs of the four nations that allied with the British: the Mohawk, Seneca, Onondaga and Cayuga.

During the Siege of Fort Stanwix in August 1777, Cornplanter played a significant role in the ambush of a column of Patriot militia and Oneida at the Battle of Oriskany. In 1778, he joined forces with John Butler and Butler&#x27;s Rangers at the 1778 Battle of Wyoming in what is now Northeastern Pennsylvania. Roughly 300 Patriot militia and Continentals were killed in what is commonly known as the Wyoming Massacre. The battle was followed by widespread looting and burning throughout the Wyoming Valley but non-combatants were not harmed.

In November 1778, Cornplanter led the Seneca at the Cherry Valley Massacre. During this raid many non-combatants were killed or taken captive.

In 1779, George Washington ordered Major General John Sullivan to invade Iroquois territory and destroy their villages. Cornplanter, along with Joseph Brant, Sayenqueraghta, and Butler, fought a desperate delaying action in order to allow the escape of refugees to Fort Niagara. They were brushed aside at the Battle of Newtown by Sullivan&#x27;s army of 4,500 men.

The Sullivan Expedition caused great destruction during the subsequent scorched earth campaign. They methodically razed villages, burned fields, and destroyed stored foodstuffs throughout the Seneca and Cayuga homeland. The Seneca suffered terribly during the following winter. Many froze or starved to death. Cornplanter and his warriors, however, continued to raid American settlements in 1780.

In May 1780, Cornplanter and Joseph Brant led an attack on Canojaharie on the Mohawk River. During this raid, Seneca warriors captured Cornplanter&#x27;s father John Abeel and burned his house. Cornplanter, who had once gone as a young man to meet his father, recognized Abeel and offered apology. Cornplanter invited Abeel to go with him or return to his European family. When his father chose the latter, Cornplanter had Seneca warriors accompany him in safety.

A few months later Cornplanter participated in the large scale raid on the Schoharie Creek and Mohawk River valleys that culminated in the inconclusive Battle of Klock&#x27;s Field. He was relatively inactive for the remainder of the war.

==Post-Revolutionary War years==
When the war ended in 1783, Cornplanter recognized the need to develop a positive diplomatic relationship with the fledgling government of what the Iroquois called the &quot;Thirteen Fires.&quot; He became a negotiator in disputes between the new &quot;Americans&quot; and the Seneca. He was a signatory of the Treaty of Fort Stanwix (1784), although this treaty was never ratified by the Iroquois.

During the Northwest Indian War, Native Americans in what is now Ohio and Indiana mounted a resistance to the encroachment of American settlers into their territory. Cornplanter convinced the Seneca to remain neutral in this conflict. In addition, he attempted to negotiate with the Shawnee on behalf of the United States.

In 1790, Cornplanter and other Seneca leaders travelled to Philadelphia to meet with President George Washington and Pennsylvania Governor Thomas Mifflin and protest the treatment of their people. Cornplanter extracted an agreement from Washington and Mifflin to protect Seneca land.

Cornplanter made a number of trips to Philadelphia, and later Washington, to strengthen relationships and meet with those who were interested in his people. He tried to understand Euro-American culture, as he felt it necessary for successful relations between the Iroquois and the United States.

Cornplanter was particularly impressed by the beliefs and practices of the Quakers. Like the Quakers, Cornplanter and his half-brother, the religious leader Handsome Lake, strongly opposed the use of liquor, and unlike other Protestant groups, the goal of Quaker missionaries was to educate rather than convert. Cornplanter invited Quakers to the Cornplanter Tract to help the Seneca learn new skills such as animal husbandry, carpentry and smithing as they could no longer rely on hunting or the fur trade as a way of life. He also encouraged Seneca men to become involved in growing crops, a task which traditionally was done by women.

In 1794, Cornplanter was a signatory to the Treaty of Canandaigua. The treaty proclaimed &quot;peace and friendship&quot; between the United States of America and the Iroquois, and affirmed their land rights in the state of New York.
Three years later he signed the Treaty of Big Tree that established Seneca reservations within their traditional territory.

Eventually, Cornplanter became disillusioned with his relationship with the Americans. To fight the drunkenness and despair suffered by many Indians, his half-brother Handsome Lake preached that the Seneca must return to the traditional way of life and take part in religious ceremonies. Cornplanter heeded Handsome Lake&#x27;s prophecy that they should return to traditional ways and turn away from European assimilation. He burned his military uniform, broke his sword, and destroyed his medals. He closed the schools but did not completely break relations with the Quakers as he retained his respect for them.

Cornplanter occasionally openly expressed his disdain for whites. Upon taking a short ride on the first steamboat to navigate the upper Allegheny River, Cornplanter, while generally impressed with the boat, quipped that &quot;white men will do anything to avoid using their muscles.&quot;

During the War of 1812, Cornplanter did not play an active role in the fighting along the Niagara River, however, his son Henry and his nephew Chainbreaker, also known as Blacksnake actively supported the Americans.

As Cornplanter aged, his influence among the Seneca dwindled in favour of Chainbreaker and Red Jacket. He died in 1836 at his home in the Cornplanter Tract.

==Family==

Cornplanter had an older half-brother, Handsome Lake, who later became a Seneca religious leader. He was the uncle of the influential sachem Chainbreaker, and the nephew of Guyasuta, a leader of the western Seneca during Pontiac&#x27;s War.

Cornplanter married twice and had seven children. The names of six of the seven are known. One of Cornplanter&#x27;s sons had an intellectual disability and is only referred to as &quot;The Idiot&quot; in primary sources.

While in Philadelphia in 1790, Cornplanter had met with Quaker leaders. He was impressed enough to send his son Henry to the Quaker school the following year. This sparked a continuing relationship between Cornplanter and the Quaker community. Henry Abeel (spelled Henry Abeele in federal documents) later served as an interpreter at the Treaty of Canandaigua negotiations in 1794.

Cornplanter descendants meet annually to Remember the Removal. There are hundreds of descendants of Cornplanter. They meet annually at the Annual Cornplanter Reunion Picnic. In 2018, the Cornplanter newsletters were compiled and published. These include genealogical information and stories from Cornplanter descendants.

==Cornplanter Tract==

In gratitude for his assistance to the state, the Pennsylvania government gave Cornplanter a grant of in 1796 along the western bank of the Allegheny River about three miles (5 km) below the southern boundary of New York state, allotting it to him and his heirs &quot;forever&quot;. By 1798, 400 Seneca lived on the land, which was called the Cornplanter Tract or Cornplanter Grant. In 1821 Warren County, Pennsylvania tried to force Cornplanter to pay taxes for his land, which he protested on the basis that the land had been &quot;granted&quot; to him by the U.S. government. After much talk, the state finally agreed that the Cornplanter Tract was exempt. Most of the Cornplanter Tract and his village, &quot;Diono?sade&#x27;gî&quot; (Place of burnt house) or &quot;Tiononshaté:ken&quot; (The house has burnt there), was deserted by the late 1950s, as it was never connected to the electrical grid and was prone to flooding.

==Cornplanter Monument==
Before his death in 1836, Cornplanter had requested a grave with no marker. In 1866, however, the State of Pennsylvania installed a monument over his grave, &quot;believed to be first monument erected in honor of a Native American in the United States.&quot;

Hon. James Ross Snowden of Philadelphia gave the dedicatory address, saying in part:

==Relocation of Cornplanter&#x27;s grave==
In 1965, the new federal Kinzua Dam at Warren, Pennsylvania was completed, creating the Allegheny Reservoir for flood control, and permanently flooding all but a small corner of the Cornplanter Tract.
Cornplanter&#x27;s grave was moved with the Cornplanter Monument, to higher ground, at the Riverview-Corydon Cemetery, located in Elk Township, Warren County, Pennsylvania. &quot;The grounds are located west of the north central Pennsylvania town of Bradford just about 100 yards from the New York state line. The cemetery contains what are believed to be the remains of Cornplanter&quot;, and some 300 of his descendants and followers. This property has eroded over the years, threatening the preservation of this important cemetery. The Seneca are reminded of their losses due to this damage. In 2009 the state made plans to try to protect the cemetery. The State of Pennsylvania erected an honorary marker at the site in 1966, after the original Cornplanter Tract was being submerged.

==Legacy==
*The relocation of Cornplanter&#x27;s remains and gravesite figure in the song &quot;As Long As The Grass Shall Grow&quot;, which Johnny Cash recorded in 1964; it was originally written by Peter LaFarge.

<doc id="919477" wikidata="Q476329" url="?curid=919477" title="Dinosaur (2000 film)">
<text>Dinosaur is a 2000 American live-action/animated adventure film produced by Walt Disney Feature Animation in association with The Secret Lab, and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The film was directed by Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton and produced by Pam Marsden, from a screenplay written by John Harrison, Robert Nelson Jacobs, and Walon Green, and a story by the trio alongside Zondag and Thom Enriquez. It features the voices of D. B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard, Ossie Davis, Max Casella, Hayden Panettiere, Samuel E. Wright, Julianna Margulies, Peter Siragusa, Joan Plowright, and Della Reese. The story follows a young &quot;Iguanodon&quot; who was adopted and raised by a family of lemurs on a tropical island. They are forced to the mainland by a catastrophic meteorite impact; setting out to find a new home, they join a herd of dinosaurs heading for the &quot;Nesting Grounds&quot;, but must contend with the group&#x27;s harsh leader, as well as external dangers such as predatory &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;.

The initial idea was conceived in 1986 by Phil Tippett and Paul Verhoeven, which they conceived as a darker, naturalistic film about dinosaurs. The project underwent numerous iterations with multiple directors attached. In 1994, Walt Disney Feature Animation began development on the project and spent several years developing the software to create the dinosaurs. The characters in &quot;Dinosaur&quot; are computer-generated. However, most of the backgrounds are live-action and were filmed on location. A number of backgrounds were found in various continents such as the Americas and Asia; various tepuis and Angel Falls also appear in the film. With a budget of $127.5 million, &quot;Dinosaur&quot; was reportedly the most expensive computer-animated film at the time. &quot;Dinosaur&quot; is also the first film from Walt Disney Feature Animation to be 3D animated.

&quot;Dinosaur&quot; was released on May 19, 2000, to generally positive reviews from critics, who praised the film&#x27;s opening sequence, soundtrack and animation, but criticized the story for its lack of originality. The film grossed $349 million worldwide, becoming the fifth highest-grossing film of 2000. It became the fourth best-selling home video release of 2001, selling 10.6 million copies and garnering $198 million in sales.

==Plot==

A &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; hunts a herd of dinosaurs, destroys a &quot;Iguanodon&quot; nest, and kills a &quot;Pachyrhinosaurus&quot;. The lone surviving &quot;Iguanodon&quot; egg is stolen by an &quot;Oviraptor,&quot; and, after a series of mishaps, arrives at an island inhabited by prehistoric lemurs. Plio, the daughter of lemur patriarch Yar, names the newly-hatched baby Aladar and raises him alongside her daughter Suri, over Yar&#x27;s initial protestations.

Several years later, a fully grown Aladar watches the lemurs take part in a mating ritual, in which Plio&#x27;s awkward teenage brother Zini fails to find a female. Moments after the ritual ends, they are interrupted by a meteorite crashing into the Earth, creating an explosive shockwave that destroys the island. Aladar and Yar&#x27;s family flee across the sea to the mainland. Being the only survivors, they mourn their losses, before journeying inland.

While crossing the burnt desert left by the meteorite, the group is attacked by a pack of &quot;Velociraptor&quot;. They escape by joining a multi-species herd of dinosaur refugees heading for the communal Nesting Grounds. After encountering the callous &quot;Iguanodon&quot; herd leader Kron, they retreat to the end of the line, and befriend the old &quot;Styracosaurus&quot; Eema, her pet &quot;Ankylosaurus&quot; Url, and her equally elderly friend Baylene, a &quot;Brachiosaurus&quot;. The herd travels for days without water to the site of a lake, only to find it seemingly dried up. Kron orders the herd to move on and let the weakest perish, but Aladar stays behind with a struggling Eema. He and Baylene dig until they reach the water table. The rest of the herd follows suit, and Kron&#x27;s sister Neera, impressed by Aladar&#x27;s compassion, begins to grow closer to him. However, Kron sees Aladar&#x27;s increasing popularity as a threat.

Meanwhile, two &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; have been tracking the herd, and ambush a scouting party led by Kron&#x27;s lieutenant Bruton. Surviving the attack, a badly wounded Bruton warns of the approaching predators. Ushering the herd away from the lake, Kron deliberately leaves Aladar, the lemurs, the elderly dinosaurs, and the injured Bruton behind, hoping that they will slow their pursuers down. The abandoned group takes shelter in a cave when a rainstorm begins, but the &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; find them during the night and attack. Fending off the attacking predators, Bruton sacrifices himself to cause a cave-in that kills one of the &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;, forcing the survivor to retreat.

Venturing deeper into the cave, the group reaches a dead end, causing Aladar to briefly lose hope. Baylene reproaches him for giving up, and uses her strength to smash through the wall, revealing the intact Nesting Grounds on the other side. As the group briefly celebrates, Eema notices that a landslide has collapsed the usual entrance into the valley. Aladar rushes off to warn Kron, who is attempting to force the herd to climb the rubble, unaware of the sheer drop on the other side. Kron sees the warning as a challenge for the position of herd leader and fights Aladar, until Neera intervenes on Aladar&#x27;s behalf. She and the herd leave with Aladar, but Kron does not follow them.

The surviving &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; arrives on the scene; Aladar rallies the herd to stand together against it, forcing the outnumbered &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; to back off. The predator, after noticing Kron&#x27;s attempts to climb the rocks alone, attacks him instead. Aladar and Neera rush to Kron&#x27;s aid, but are unable to rescue him. Aladar pushes the &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; towards the edge of the drop, where the ground gives way, causing the &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; to fall to its death. Aladar and Neera mourn Kron, then lead the herd to the Nesting Grounds. Some time later, a new generation of dinosaurs hatches - among them Aladar and Neera&#x27;s children - and the lemurs find more of their own kind.

==Voice cast==
* D. B. Sweeney as Aladar, a brave and compassionate young &quot;Iguanodon&quot;. He is the adoptive son of Plio, grandson of Yar, nephew of Zini and the older brother of Suri.
* Alfre Woodard as Plio, a wise lemur who cares for her family. She is the daughter of Yar, older sister of Zini, mother of Suri and the adoptive mother of Aladar.
* Ossie Davis as Yar, a lemur with a gruff attitude but a gentle heart. He is the father of Plio and Zini, maternal grandfather of Suri, and the adoptive maternal grandfather of Aladar.
* Max Casella as Zini, a wisecracking and somewhat hapless teenage lemur, who fancies himself a ladies man. He is the younger brother of Plio, son of Yar, and the maternal uncle of Suri and Aladar.
** Evan Sabara voices Zini as a child. 
* Hayden Panettiere as Suri, a sweet, fun-loving young lemur. She is Aladar&#x27;s adoptive younger sister, Plio&#x27;s daughter, Zini&#x27;s niece, and Yar&#x27;s granddaughter.
* Samuel E. Wright as Kron, Neera&#x27;s brother and the &quot;Iguanodon&quot; leader of the herd of survivors. He behaves as a Social Darwinist, only concerned about the &quot;fit/strong&quot; dinosaurs and his own position as leader.
* Julianna Margulies as Neera, a kindly, sensible &quot;Iguanodon&quot; who is Kron&#x27;s sister and Aladar&#x27;s love interest.

Chris Farley was originally slated to voice the character, when it was originally written as a male character named Sorbus. After his death, the character was rewritten as a female.
* Della Reese as Eema, a wizened, elderly and slow-moving &quot;Styracosaurus&quot; with a comically snarky demeanor.
* Michael T. Weiss as Creto, an Iguanodon scout who is killed by the two &quot;Carnotaurus&quot;.

==Production==
===Development===
After founding his own namesake studio, special effects artist Phil Tippett directed &quot;Prehistoric Beast&quot; (1984), an experimental animated short film in which a &quot;Centrosaurus&quot; is stalked by a &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;. Tippett&#x27;s skill at creating go motion animated creatures led to the 1985 CBS animated documentary &quot;Dinosaur!&quot;. A year later, Tippett was hired to work on the special effects team for &quot;RoboCop&quot; (1987). During filming, in December 1986, Tippett recalled, &quot;When Jon Davison and I were shooting the live-action plates where ED-209 falls down the stairs, there was some kind of delay. Peter Weller&#x27;s shoes didn&#x27;t fit. so we had to wait for someone to get the right stunt shoes.&quot; Frustrated by the delay, Tippett suggested to Paul Verhoeven that they should produce a &quot;dinosaur picture&quot;. That way, according to Tippett, &quot;[w]e wouldn&#x27;t have to be held up by actors in robot outfits.&quot;

Verhoeven was excited at the idea and suggested an approach inspired by &quot;Shane&quot; (1953) in which &quot;you follow a lead character through a number of situations and moving from a devastated landscape into a promised land.&quot; Veteran screenwriter Walon Green was then brought on to write the script. Verhoeven and Tippett had planned to use stop motion animation techniques such as puppets, scale models, and miniatures.

The film was originally going to be much darker and violent in tone, in a style akin to a nature documentary. The film&#x27;s original main protagonist was a &quot;Styracosaurus&quot; named Woot and the main antagonist was a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot; named Grozni, with a small mammal named Suri as a supporting character. After Woot defeats Grozni in a final fight, the film would end with the &quot;Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event&quot;, which would ultimately result in the death of the dinosaurs. Verhoeven then storyboarded two key sequences and calculated the project&#x27;s preliminary budget to be $45 million. Verhoeven pitched the project to then-Disney chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who gave a counteroffer of $25 million because in Verhoeven&#x27;s words, Katzenberg felt there wasn&#x27;t &quot;enough of an audience to justify that cost.&quot; The budget disputes led to Verhoeven and Tippett&#x27;s departure from the project.

In 1990, before Verhoeven and Tippett had departed the project, producer/director Thomas G. Smith became involved in the film, but briefly became the director after they had left. Reflecting on his tenure, Smith said, &quot;Jeanne Rosenberg was still writing the script, but it was in trouble. Disney wanted a cute story of dinosaurs talking, and I didn&#x27;t like the idea. I thought it should be more like Jean Annaud&#x27;s &quot;The Bear&quot;. I wanted to have actual lemurs in it. They actually existed at the time of dinosaurs...We actually located a guy who trains them.&quot; However, Katzenberg called Smith to help on &quot;Honey, I Blew Up the Kid&quot; (1992) in which he was replaced by David W. Allen, who had just finished directing &quot;Puppet Master II&quot; (1990). Multiple months were spent filming actual lemurs to portray Suri and creating visual development, but Allen&#x27;s version also fell into development hell. Smith stated, &quot;The thing that ultimately killed it is that Disney knew that &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; was coming along pretty well, and they knew it was being done digitally. They figured, &#x27;Well, maybe, we should wait until we can do it digitally.

In late 1994, Walt Disney Feature Animation began development on the project and they began shooting various tests, placing computer-generated characters in miniature model backdrops. The idea to use computer-generated backgrounds was considered, but rejected after the earliest proof-of-concept animation test was completed in March 1996. Ultimately, the filmmakers decided to take the unprecedented route of combining live-action scenery with computer-generated character animation. The filmmakers then approached then-Disney CEO Michael Eisner about not knowing how much the project would cost or how long it would take to finish, but that they could fully complete it. Trusting the filmmakers, Eisner decided to green-light the project. However, at his insistence, it was decided early on that the dinosaurs would talk during the film. To accommodate this change, Aladar would be given lips in contrast to actual &quot;Iguanodons&quot; who were duck-billed.

George Scribner was selected as the director, and he was later teamed with Ralph Zondag as co-director. Storyboard artist Floyd Norman stated that Scribner envisioned the film &quot;to be more than just a struggle for survival. He wanted this dinosaur movie to have elements of fun and humor ... Our director wanted to explore the fun elements of dinosaurs, such as their size, shape, and texture. George also knew that since dinosaurs come in all sizes—what wacky relationships might I come up with? What funny situations might plague a critter of such massive size?&quot;

Scribner left the project to work at Walt Disney Imagineering, and Eric Leighton was brought in as co-director. The new script had an &quot;Iguanodon&quot; named Noah as the protagonist wandering with his grandparents and a lemur companion named Adam, and a group of &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; as well as a rival &quot;Iguanodon&quot; named Cain playing the antagonists. The story dealt with Noah, who had the ability to see visions of the future, foreseeing the coming of an asteroid and struggling to guide a herd of other dinosaurs to safety. Further into production, Noah, Cain and Adam were renamed Aladar, Kron and Zini, and certain aspects of the story were altered further into what was later seen in the final product.

===Animation===
On April 17, 1996, the Walt Disney Company announced they had acquired the visual effects studio, Dream Quest Images. The studio was merged with the Feature Animation department&#x27;s Computer Graphics Unit in order to form The Secret Lab. Vision Crew Unlimited provided the live-action visual effects. At the time, the Secret Lab&#x27;s initial studio was reconstructed from a former Lockheed Martin (former Lockheed) building in Burbank, California. Most of the computers were used from Silicon Graphics and additional machines were installed to create a render farm in order to provide workstations for artists, software engineers, and technical directors. The production team eventually re-located to the Feature Animation&#x27;s Northside building in January 1997, and animation officially began eight months later, although some preliminary work had already begun.

To ensure realistic CG animation, 3D workbooks were created using Softimage 3D software. 48 animators worked on the film, using 300 computer processors to animate the film. Having aspired to be a paleontologist, David Krentz supervised the character design and visual development teams. He had an orthographic view of the dinosaurs, and his character designs were drawn on paper and scanned into the PowerAnimator software for the modelers to rig in the computers. In the character animation department, the dinosaur characters were first visualized in the computer in skeletal form. The rough character animations were then transferred into three software programs to strengthen the visuals of the characters. The programs were &quot;Fur Tool,&quot; which was used for the lemurs and to create feathers and grass; &quot;Body Builder,&quot; which was used to create skin and muscles for the dinosaurs; and &quot;Mug Shot,&quot; a shape blender that works within Alias Maya for facial animation and lip-synching.

Headed by David Womersley, live-action photography units shot on actual jungle, beach, and desert locations including California, Florida, Hawaii, Australia, Jordan, Venezuela, and Samoa. In total, two live-action film crews shot more than of film, although one scene, which takes place inside a cave, utilized a computer-generated background. In order to approximate a dinosaur&#x27;s perspective, visual effects supervisor Neil Krepela invented the &quot;Dino-cam&quot;, in which a camera was rigged on a cable suspended between two -tall towers. The computer-controlled camera allowed for panning and tilting on 360 degrees and moved at up to per hour across a span of . With the live-action elements shot and the character animation reaching completion, the footage was moved into the Scene Finaling department. Under Jim Hillin, the effects-compositing team blended 80–90 percent of the live action plates against the computer-animated characters. The lighting department then adjusted the final lighting of the shots by changing the lighting conditions and replacing the skies.

===Filming accident===
On February 26, 1998, while filming live-action footage in Poison Canyon near Trona, San Bernardino County, California, a crew member was killed and another seriously wounded when a camera boom struck a cross-country power line. Disney was sued by the surviving crew member and the deceased&#x27;s family, and the company was later fined $5,000 for violating worker safety laws.

==Music==
The film&#x27;s score was composed by James Newton Howard with choral directing by Lebo M, who did vocals for &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994). In September 1999, it was reported that pop singer/songwriter Kate Bush had written and recorded a song for the film to be used in the scene in which Aladar and his family mourn the destruction of their island. Reportedly, preview audiences did not respond well to the song. The producers recommended that Bush rewrite it, but she refused. Ultimately, due to complications, the track was not included on the soundtrack.

The soundtrack album was released on May 5, 2000, by Walt Disney Records. Howard would later compose the scores for the Disney animated features &quot;&quot; (2001), &quot;Treasure Planet&quot; (2002), and &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot; (2021). One track, &quot;The Egg Travels&quot;, was heard in many trailers following the film&#x27;s release, including &quot;Lilo &amp; Stitch&quot; (2002), &quot;The Wild Thornberrys Movie&quot; (2002), and &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (2004).

While the film got mixed reviews from critics, the film score received universally positive critical reception, with critics singling out &quot;The Egg Travels&quot; in particular as one of the best. For his work, James Newton Howard was nominated for an Annie Award for Music in a Feature Production and Saturn Award for Best Music.

==Release==
The film premiered at the El Capitan Theatre on May 13, 2000. In conjunction during its theatrical release, the film was accompanied by an exclusive interactive dinosaur exhibit center adjacent to the El Capitan Theatre titled &quot;The Dinosaur Experience&quot;. It received a PG rating from the Motion Picture Association of America due to &quot;intense images.&quot;

===Marketing===
Similar to the promotional marketing of &quot;The Lion King&quot; (1994), Disney began the promotional rollout for &quot;Dinosaur&quot; by attaching a teaser trailer consisting entirely of the film&#x27;s opening scene to the theatrical release of &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; (1999). The same trailer was also included on the home video release of &quot;Tarzan&quot; (1999), and the Walt Disney Gold Classic Collection DVD release of &quot;The Aristocats&quot; (1970). A second trailer was later released in March and attached to the theatrical release to DreamWorks Animation&#x27;s &quot;The Road to El Dorado&quot; (2000).

To promote the release of &quot;Dinosaur&quot;, the Animal Kingdom theme park ride &quot;Countdown to Extinction&quot; was renamed after the film, and its plot, which had always prominently featured a &quot;Carnotaurus&quot; and an &quot;Iguanodon&quot;, was mildly altered so that the &quot;Iguanodon&quot; is specifically meant to be Aladar, the film&#x27;s protagonist, and the plot of the ride is now about the riders traveling through time to a point just before the impact of the meteorite that caused the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, to bring Aladar back to the present and save his life. A &quot;Dinosaur Jubilee&quot; was held at the Animal Kingdom&#x27;s DinoLand U.S.A. It ran from May to July 2000 and included interactive games, music, and a display of the replica of the dinosaur Sue. A walkthrough attraction based on the film also opened temporarily in Discoveryland at Disneyland Paris.

McDonald&#x27;s launched a four-week promotion in May 2000. The restaurant chain sold &quot;Dinosaur&quot;-themed Happy Meals, which included toys such as hand puppets and talking dinosaur figures. It also ran the &quot;Hatch, Match &amp; Win&quot; sweepstake contest in the United States, where customers could collect game pieces with their meals for a chance to win various prizes. Mattel also produced toys based on the film, and the Disney Store chain sold other film-based merchandise.

===Home media===

The film was released on VHS and DVD on January 30, 2001. It was also released on 2-Disc Collector&#x27;s Edition DVD that same day. Both DVD releases are THX certified and feature a DTS 5.1 audio track. For the Collector&#x27;s Edition version, first disc contained supplemental bonus features, including two audio commentaries: one from directors Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton and the effects supervisors, and the other from producer Pam Marsden and the animators. It also featured interactive games and an educational short explaining the various prehistoric eras. The second disc contains numerous behind-the-scenes documentary features, including early animation tests.

In December 2001, &quot;Variety&quot; reported it was the fourth best-selling home video release of the year, behind &quot;Shrek&quot;, &quot;How the Grinch Stole Christmas&quot; and &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;. It had sold 10.6 million copies and garnered $198 million. It was re-released on VHS on February 25, 2003. The film was released on Blu-ray for an original widescreen presentation on September 19, 2006, becoming the first animated film to be released on the format.

===Video games===
On May 16, 2000, Disney Interactive released a video game based on the film on a Microsoft Windows/Mac CD-ROM as part of the &quot;Activity Center&quot; series. Additionally, Disney Interactive released a tie-in video game on Dreamcast, PlayStation, PC, and Game Boy Color.

==Reception==
===Box office===
During its opening weekend, &quot;Dinosaur&quot; grossed $38.8 million from 3,257 theaters in the United States and Canada, beating out &quot;Gladiator&quot; and &quot;Road Trip&quot; to take the number-one spot. The film was surpassed by &quot;&quot; the following weekend.

In the UK, &quot;Dinosaur&quot; grossed $3 million in its opening weekend, topping the box office ahead of &quot;Nutty Professor II: The Klumps&quot;. It was overtaken by &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; during its second weekend. In its third weekend, the film briefly returned to the number-one spot with $3.1 million before it was once again displaced by &quot;What Lies Beneath&quot; in its fourth weekend. In Japan, it had a record opening for a Disney film with an opening weekend gross of $5 million, beating the record set by &quot;Toy Story 2&quot;. The film also surpassed &quot;Tarzan&quot; to have Thailand&#x27;s highest opening for an animated film with $440,000, while delivering the third-highest opening of 2000 in the country, after &quot;Mission: Impossible 2&quot; and &quot;X-Men&quot;.

It grossed $137.7 million in the United States and Canada and $212.1 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $348.8 million. The film&#x27;s expensive production and marketing costs prevented the film from breaking even during its theatrical release.

===Critical response===
On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of based on reviews and an average score of . The website&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;While &quot;Dinosaur&quot;″s plot is generic and dull, its stunning computer animation and detailed backgrounds are enough to make it worth a look.&quot; On Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 56 out of 100, based on 32 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave the film three stars out of four, praising the film&#x27;s &quot;amazing visuals&quot; but criticizing the decision to make the animals talk, which he felt canceled out the effort to make the film so realistic. Ebert wrote, &quot;An enormous effort had been spent on making these dinosaurs seem real, and then an even greater effort was spent on undermining the illusion&quot;. On the syndicated television series &quot;Roger Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot;, the film received two thumbs up with guest host Michaela Pereira from ZDTV&#x27;s &quot;Internet Tonight&quot; additionally praising the vocal performances for the characters. Todd McCarthy of &quot;Variety&quot; called it &quot;an eye-popping visual spectacle&quot;, but later wrote, &quot;somewhere around half-way through, you begin to get used to the film&#x27;s pictorial wondrousness — to take it for granted, even — and start to realize that the characters and story are exceedingly mundane, unsurprising and pre-programmed.&quot; Peter Keough of the &quot;Boston Phoenix&quot; said, &quot;Maybe it&#x27;s just the Barney hater in me, but I prefer my dinosaurs without dialogue.&quot; A. O. Scott, reviewing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, praised the opening sequence as &quot;a visual and sonic extravaganza that the rest of the movie never quite lives up to. Those scores of animators and technical advisers have conjured a teeming pre-human world, and the first minutes of the film present it in a swooping, eye-filling panorama.&quot; Summarizing the review, he later wrote that &quot;[t]he reason to see this movie is not to listen to the dinosaurs but to watch them move, to marvel at their graceful necks and clumsy limbs and notice how convincingly they emerge into sunlight or get wet.&quot;

Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;astonishes and disheartens as only the most elaborate, most ambitious Hollywood products can. A technical amazement that points computer-generated animation toward the brightest of futures, it&#x27;s also cartoonish in the worst way, the prisoner of pedestrian plot points and childish, too-cute dialogue.&quot; Mark Caro of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; wrote &quot;The action is easy enough to follow, and the screen is never dull. But for a story that takes place some 65 million years ago, &quot;Dinosaur&quot; is awfully reliant on recent recycled parts.&quot; Desson Howe, reviewing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, felt the movie &quot;was somewhat derivative and lacked a narrative arc&quot; and claimed it was too similar to &quot;The Land Before Time&quot;.

<doc id="919480" wikidata="Q2308528" url="?curid=919480" title="Speedwell (1577 ship)">
<text>Speedwell was a 60-ton pinnace that carried a band of English Dissenters now popularly called the Pilgrims from Leiden, Holland, to England, whence they intended to sail to America aboard both the &quot;Speedwell&quot; and the &quot;Mayflower&quot; in 1620. The Pilgrims initially set sail in both ships, but &quot;Speedwell&quot; was found to be unseaworthy and both ships returned to England. The Pilgrims later left &quot;Speedwell&quot; behind and sailed in the &quot;Mayflower&quot; alone.

==&quot;Swiftsure&quot;==
&quot;Speedwell&quot; was built in 1577, under the name &quot;Swiftsure&quot;, as part of English preparations for war against Spain. She participated in the fight against the Spanish Armada. During the Earl of Essex&#x27;s 1596 Azores expedition she served as the ship of his second in command, Sir Gelli Meyrick. After hostilities with Spain ended, she was decommissioned in 1605, and renamed &quot;Speedwell&quot;, after the UK wildflower but also a play on words for its desired ability.

==&quot;Speedwell&quot;==
 Captain Blossom, a Leiden Separatist, bought &quot;Speedwell&quot; in July 1620. They then sailed under the command of Captain Reynolds to Southampton, England to meet the sister ship, &quot;Mayflower&quot;, which had been chartered by merchant investors (again Captain Blossom). In Southampton they joined with other Separatists and the additional colonists hired by the investors. &quot;Speedwell&quot; was already leaking. The ships lay at anchor in Southampton almost two weeks while &quot;Speedwell&quot; was being repaired and the group had to sell some of their belongings, food and stores, to cover costs and port fees.

The two ships began the voyage on 5 August 1620, but &quot;Speedwell&quot; was found to be taking on water, and the two ships put into Dartmouth in Devon for repairs. On the second attempt, &quot;Mayflower&quot; and &quot;Speedwell&quot; sailed about 100 leagues (about ) beyond Land&#x27;s End in Cornwall, but &quot;Speedwell&quot; was again found to be taking on water. Both vessels returned to Dartmouth in Devon. The Separatists decided to go on to America on &quot;Mayflower&quot;. According to Bradford, &quot;Speedwell&quot; was sold at auction in London, and after being repaired made a number of successful voyages for her new owners. At least two of her passengers, Captain Thomas Blossom and a son, returned to Leiden.

Prior to the voyage, &quot;Speedwell&quot; had been refitted in Delfshaven (Rotterdam) and had two masts. Nathaniel Philbrick theorizes that the crew used a mast that was too big for the ship, and that the added stress caused holes to form in the hull. William Bradford wrote that the &quot;overmasting&quot; strained the ship&#x27;s hull, but attributes the main cause of her leaking to actions on the part of the crew. Passenger Robert Cushman wrote from Dartmouth in August 1620 that the leaking was caused by a loose board approximately two feet long.

Eleven people from &quot;Speedwell&quot; boarded &quot;Mayflower&quot;, leaving 20 people to return to London (including Cushman) while a combined company of 102 continued the voyage. For a third time, &quot;Mayflower&quot; headed for the New World. She left Plymouth on 6 September 1620 and entered Cape Cod Bay on 11 November. &quot;Speedwell&#x27;s&quot; replacement, &quot;Fortune&quot;, eventually followed, arriving at Plymouth Colony one year later on 9 November 1621. Philippe de Lannoy on &quot;Speedwell&quot; made the trip.

The ship was apparently in use by the Royal Navy in 1624 when it was used by Royal Navy Captain John Chudleigh (MP for Lostwithiel) to transport the German commander Ernst von Mansfeld to London.

Under the ownership of Captain John Thomas Chappell, the &quot;Speedwell&quot; sailed again on 28 May 1635 from Southampton, finally arriving in Virginia. The ship then returned to England and was then refitted and sold.

==&quot;Speedwell&quot; in art==
 In 1837, Robert Walter Weir was commissioned by the United States Congress to paint an historical depiction of the Pilgrims. This painting was placed in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda at Washington, D.C. in December 1843. Known as &quot;The Embarkation of the Pilgrims&quot;, the painting is a scene on board &quot;Speedwell&quot; while harboured in Delfshaven, Holland. The historical event dramatized took place on 22 July 1620. Weir would later paint another, much smaller oil on canvas that is now displayed in the Brooklyn Museum of Art. The paintings are similar except for lighting and a few minor changes. The 1857 work measures about . &quot;The Embarkation of the Pilgrims&quot; is depicted on the reverse of the 10,000 dollar bill (Federal Reserve Note) issued in 1918. Only five examples of this bill are known, and &quot;none exist outside of institutional collections.&quot;

==&quot;Speedwell&quot; in fiction==
A fiction based on fact novel, &quot;A Spurious Brood&quot; outlines a possible explanation for the sabotage of &quot;Speedwell&quot;, based on the true story of Katherine More, whose children were sent to America on board &quot;Mayflower&quot;. In &quot;Hornblower and the Atropos&quot;, one of the C. S. Forester novels about fictional British naval officer Horatio Hornblower, a treasure ship named &quot;Speedwell&quot; has sunk in Turkey&#x27;s Marmorice Bay, and Hornblower&#x27;s mission is to recover the treasure from the bottom of the bay. &quot;Speedwell&quot; is also mentioned several times in battle-action scenes in the historical fiction novel, &quot;Armada: A Novel&quot;, written by Charles Gidley Wheeler and published in 1987. In the 1987 Larry Cohen film &quot;A Return to Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, which serves as a sequel to the 1979 miniseries &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, the &quot;Speedwell&quot; did not sink and was the ship upon which vampires arrived in the New World.

<doc id="919489" wikidata="Q6136243" url="?curid=919489" title="James C. Hormel">
<text>James Catherwood Hormel (January 1, 1933 – August 13, 2021) was an American philanthropist, LGBT activist, diplomat, and heir to the Hormel meatpacking fortune. He served as the United States Ambassador to Luxembourg from 1999 to 2001, and was the first openly gay man to represent the United States as an ambassador.

==Early life and education==
Hormel was born in Austin, Minnesota. He is the grandson of George A. Hormel, founder of Hormel Foods. Hormel is the son of Germaine Dubois and Jay Catherwood Hormel, who served as president of Hormel Foods. Hormel earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Swarthmore College and a Juris Doctor from the University of Chicago Law School. After law school, Hormel served as the dean of students and director of admissions at the University of Chicago Law School.

==Diplomatic career==
In 1994, President Bill Clinton considered Hormel for the ambassadorship to Fiji, but did not put the nomination forward due to objections from Fijian government officials. At the time, gay male sexual acts were punishable with prison sentences in Fiji and Hormel&#x27;s being open about his sexuality would stand in conflict with &quot;Fijian culture&quot;. Instead, Hormel was named as part of the United Nations delegation from the United States to the Human Rights Commission in 1995, and in 1996 became an alternate for the United Nations General Assembly.

In October 1997, Clinton nominated Hormel to be ambassador to Luxembourg, which had removed laws prohibiting consensual same-sex acts between adults in the 1800s. This appointment was the first nomination or appointment of an openly LGBT person from the United States. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee approved his nomination with only Republican and conservative Senators Jesse Helms and John Ashcroft opposed. While his confirmation by the senate initially seemed certain, with only two senators—Tim Hutchinson and James Inhofe—opposing the nomination, subsequent revelations about Hormel&#x27;s background led to more opposition from Republican senators, leaving Hormel&#x27;s nomination in limbo. Among the points of contention were:
* The James C. Hormel Gay and Lesbian Center at the San Francisco Public Library, which Hormel funded, was found to contain pornographic materials and documents published by the pro-pedophilia advocacy group NAMBLA. Christian-based conservative groups like the Traditional Values Coalition (TVC) and the Family Research Council (FRC) labelled Hormel as being pro-pornography, asserting that Hormel would be rejected in the largely Roman Catholic Luxembourg. The Washington Post later wrote that much of the same material could also be found in the Library of Congress, and Hormel said that he had nothing to do with the selection. 
* The FRC distributed video tapes of a television interview with Hormel at the 1996 San Francisco Pride parade in which Hormel laughed at a joke about the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a group of men who dress in drag as nuns to mock religious conventions, as they passed by. The Catholic League took this as an indication of approval of what they characterized as an anti-Catholic group. In a meeting with Tim Hutchinson, Hormel declined to repudiate the Sisters. In an interview years later, Hormel objected to the idea that the video clip showed that he approved of the group and that he was anti-Catholic.
* It was revealed that Hormel had contributed $12,000 to fund the production of &quot;It&#x27;s Elementary: Talking About Gay Issues in School&quot;, a video aimed at teaching tolerance of homosexuality to grade-school students. This especially inflamed Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, who was portrayed unflatteringly in the film. Smith contended that he opposed Hormel not because he was gay but because of his &quot;advocacy of the gay lifestyle&quot;.

Trent Lott, the Republican majority leader, worked to block the vote and publicly called homosexuality a sin and compared it to alcoholism and kleptomania. 

Concerns about Hormel&#x27;s reception in Luxembourg were &quot;blunted when officials of the country, which has laws against discrimination based on sexual orientation, indicated that he would be welcome.&quot; Senator Alfonse D&#x27;Amato of New York found the obstruction of the nomination an embarrassment and urged that Trent Lott bring the issue up for a vote. When Lott continued to stall, Clinton employed a recess appointment on June 4, 1999. Hormel was sworn in as ambassador in June 1999. His partner at the time, Timothy Wu, held the Bible during the ceremony. Also in attendance were Hormel&#x27;s former wife, his five children, and several of his grandchildren.
The treatment of his nomination was referenced by Pete Buttigieg during his acceptance speech for his nomination as Secretary of Transportation on December 16, 2020.

==Philanthropy and advocacy==
In 1981, he was one of the founders of the Human Rights Campaign. He was a member of the boards of directors of the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce and the American Foundation for AIDS Research. Hormel contributed $500,000 to fund the creation of the James C. Hormel Gay &amp; Lesbian Center at the San Francisco Public Library in 1996 (renamed the James C. Hormel LGBTQIA Center in 2016).

Hormel participated in numerous events, including a conference organized in 2004 by Amnesty International in the frame of the Geneva Gay Pride. In 2010 he was given the Lifetime Achievement Grand Marshal Award by San Francisco Pride Board of Directors for his LGBT activism over several decades.

==Personal life and death==
Hormel&#x27;s brother, Geordie Hormel, was a musician and recording studio proprietor. James Hormel was married to Alice Turner, now a retired psychologist, for ten years before coming out of the closet. They were married from 1956 to 1965. Hormel had five children, fourteen grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren. He lived in San Francisco, California, with his spouse Michael Peter Nguyen Araque.

James Hormel died in San Francisco on August 13, 2021, at the age of 88.

<text>The Nez Perce National Forest is a United States National Forest located in west-central Idaho. The forest is bounded on the east by the state of Montana, on the north by the Clearwater National Forest, on the west by a portion of the Wallowa–Whitman National Forest and on the south by the Payette National Forest.

The mountains in this forest provide wildlife habitat for timber wolf, raccoon, moose, black bear, coyote, cougar, elk, two species of fox, bald eagle, pika, beaver, flammulated owl, pine marten, white-tailed and mule deer, muskrat, river otter, peregrine falcon, mink, marmot, fisher, and mountain goat.

== History ==
The Nez Perce National Forest was established on July 1, 1908, by the U.S. Forest Service with from parts of Bitterroot National Forest and Weiser National Forest. On October 29, 1934, part of Selway National Forest was added.

In 2012, Nez Perce National Forest and Clearwater National Forest were administratively combined as Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests, with headquarters in Kamiah, Idaho. There are local ranger district offices in Elk City, Grangeville, Kooskia, and White Bird.

In 2018, the Penman Mine in Nez Perce served as a filming location for Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Gold Rush&quot;. During this filming, on October 5, 2018, Raw TV production staff member Terrance Woods Jr. (27) was reported as missing, as was Connie Johnson (76), a cook for Richie Outfitters last seen October 2. Johnson&#x27;s border collie, Ace, was recovered alive at the Moose Creek ranger station three weeks later, but as of 2022, neither Johnson nor Woods have been found.

==Wilderness areas==
There are four officially designated wilderness areas within Nez Perce National Forest that are part of the National Wilderness Preservation System. Three of these are partly or mostly in neighboring National Forests (as indicated).
* Frank Church—River of No Return Wilderness (only 4.68% lies within Nez Perce NF; mostly in either Payette National Forest, Challis NF, Salmon NF, Boise NF, or Bitterroot NF)
* Gospel Hump Wilderness
* Hells Canyon Wilderness (mostly in Wallowa National Forest; partly in Payette National Forest, Whitman National Forest, or BLM land)
* Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness (partly in Bitterroot NF; Clearwater National Forest; Lolo NF)

<doc id="919493" wikidata="Q321255" url="?curid=919493" title="Kouprey">
<text>The kouprey (Bos sauveli), also known as the forest ox and grey ox, is a possibly extinct species of forest-dwelling wild bovine native to Southeast Asia. It was first scientifically described in 1937.
The name kouprey is derived from the Khmer language and means &quot;forest ox&quot;.

The kouprey is listed as Critically Endangered and possibly extinct on the IUCN Red List. The last confirmed sighting of a wild individual took place in 1969.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The kouprey was described by Achille Urbain in 1937 based on an adult individual that was caught in northern Cambodia and was kept at the Paris Zoological Park.

In 2006, a comparison of mitochondrial DNA sequences indicated that the kouprey may be a hybrid between zebu and banteng. However, the authors of the study rescinded their conclusion. In 2021, it was established that the kouprey represents a distinct species unrelated to zebu, forming a polytomy with the banteng and gaur due to incomplete lineage sorting, suggesting extensive hybridisation between their ancestors and resulting in the mitochondrial DNA of kouprey being nested within a group including a mixture of both banteng and gaur.

Relationships of members of the genus &quot;Bos&quot; based on nuclear genomes after Sinding, et al. 2021.

==Description==

The kouprey has a light and gracile build, in comparison to other wild cattle species. Both sexes have notched nostrils. It is long from nose to rear, tall at the shoulders and weighs .

Calves have a reddish bay colour and turn grey at around 5 months of age. Their horns start appearing at the age of 6 months. The pelage of cows and bulls diverges as they mature; cows turn a mouse to brownish grey, while bulls become progressively darker, until individuals of 12 years or older are entirely dark brown. Both sexes have white stockings, with a dark strip down the front of each foreleg.

Kouprey are a sexually dimorphic species and along with having different colour coats, males and females are distinguishable by the remarkably different shapes of their horns. Those of bulls are widely-set, similar to those of wild yaks, growing outwards before arching forwards and upwards, eventually fraying at the tips. While those of cows spiral upwards, growing into a shape reminiscent of a lyre. The horns of bulls reach up to , and those of cows up to .

Bull kouprey develop large dewlaps as they age, with those of mature individuals reaching lengths of 16 inches (40 cm). In some cases, the dewlap is so pronounced that it drags along the ground.

==Distribution and habitat==
The range of the kouprey once stretched from eastern Thailand and southern Laos to the western edge of Vietnam and northern Cambodia. Archaeological evidence shows that it also occurred in northern Yunnan, China.

The primary habitat of the kouprey is described as a mix of open grassland and dense open canopy forests featuring grassy glades, waterholes and salt licks.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Kouprey behaviour is described as similar to that of the banteng, with the two species often being found grazing alongside each other, though not intermixing. Herds, made up of cows, their calves, and periodically bulls, are always led by a mature cow. Kouprey are active, if nervous, animals, being quick to flee if approached. Bulls have been observed to plough up soil with their horns, especially around mineral licks and waterholes, which leads to the tips fraying.

To avoid the hottest parts of the day, kouprey feed during the early morning and late afternoon, moving into denser forest for respite during midday. Little information is available on the animal&#x27;s diet, though various grasses and some browse, supplemented with mineral soil, have been recorded.

Kouprey come together to mate during the month of April, with bulls dispersing back into bachelor herds by the beginning of May. Gestation is between 8 and 9 months, with cows giving birth to a single calf between December and February. Female kouprey will isolate themselves to give birth, and remain away from the herd with their calf for the first month of its life. The total lifespan of a kouprey is thought to be around 20 years.

==Threats ==
The kouprey is thought to have never been numerous, likely never exceeding 2,000 individuals during the 20th century. In 1989, the total kouprey population in Cambodia was estimated at less than 200 individuals, with between 40 and 100 surviving in Laos, and less than 30 in Vietnam. As of 2016, the IUCN Red List puts the wild population at no more than 50 individuals, with a decreasing population trend.
Kouprey have been hunted by local people for their meat, horns and skulls, the latter being highly symbolic culturally.

Trophy hunting has likely been a considerable pressure on kouprey since their discovery by the Western world in the 1930s. War and political conflict, such as the Vietnam War and the Cambodian Civil War, have also played a role in the species&#x27; decline through the destruction of habitat, poaching, and significantly disrupting conservation efforts and further study of the animal in the wild.
Snares are a potential risk for any surviving kouprey, with a 2020 report by the World Wildlife Fund estimating that over 12.2 million snares were present within protected areas in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam.

== Conservation ==
Conservation efforts for the kouprey began in 1960 when Norodom Sihanouk, then head of state of Cambodia, gave the species protected status and created three natural reserves for it. These protected areas continued to be maintained by Norodom Sihanouk&#x27;s successor, Lon Nol, but became neglected during the time of Khmer Rouge rule under Pol Pot. During this period, the majority of the country&#x27;s Forestry Bureau staff were killed, and all documents relating to the reserves were destroyed.

Despite several expeditions by Dr. Charles H. Wharton to document kouprey during the 1950s, conservation efforts did not truly pick up again until the 1980s when, on the 15th and 16 January 1988, the University of Hanoi hosted the International Workshop on the Kouprey: Conservation Programme. Headed and coordinated by the IUCN, in collaboration with the governments of Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, and Thailand, this had the aim of creating a feasible and realistic action plan for immediate kouprey conservation. Other organizations that attended and contributed to the action plan were the Association of Zoos and Aquariums, the Centre for Environmental Studies, VNIUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC), the Asian Wild Cattle Specialist Group, as well as WWF International.

A 2011 examination by the IUCN of camera trap photos from northern Cambodia, some taken in known kouprey habitat, failed to turn up evidence of the animal. In late 2022, researchers from Re:wild and the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research began a study to determine the status of kouprey in the wild. The goal of the study, through the examination of historical surveys and camera trap records, is to determine whether or not there is still suitable kouprey habitat that has yet to be searched.

=== In captivity ===
Only two kouprey have ever been kept in zoos. A young male was captured in Preah Vihear Province, Cambodia, and sent to the Paris Zoological Park by a French veterinarian. It arrived at the zoo in April 1937 and was housed alongside a juvenile gaur and a juvenile water buffalo. It died sometime during World War II. Another calf was kept in a captive setting by Norodom Sihanouk during the 1950s, though details surrounding this individual are limited.

==Cultural significance ==

Potential depictions of kouprey in rock art have been documented in the Cardamon Mountains of Cambodia, and carvings in the temples of Angkor Wat have been found to resemble the animal as well.

The kouprey is the national animal of Cambodia, being designated as such by Norodom Sihanouk in 1960, its name is also the nickname of the country&#x27;s national football team.

Several statues depicting and dedicated to the kouprey have been established across Cambodia, including in the country&#x27;s capital city, Phnom Penh.

During the 2022 Miss Grand Cambodia contest, model Pich Votey Saravody wore a costume depicting a kouprey, which stirred considerable controversy amongst viewers, many of whom felt the depiction disrespected the animal.

<text>20 Minute Workout is a Canadian-produced aerobics-based television program that ran from 1983 to 1984, in which &quot;a bevy of beautiful girls&quot; demonstrated exercise on a rotating platform.

==Series background==
&quot;20 Minute Workout&quot; was created by Ron Harris in 1983, produced by Tantra Entertainment in association with the Canadian animation company Nelvana, and broadcast locally on Citytv. In the United States, it was syndicated by Orion Television. Two seasons of the program were produced, although reruns continued to appear for many years afterwards. The first season featured a different instructor for each day of the week, Monday through Friday. Bess Motta, Arlaine Wright, Holly Butler, Nicole Nardini, and Anne Schumacher all had speaking roles. The second season featured only Bess and Arlaine as instructors. One selling point of the show was the young attractive women exercising in leotards. The exercise routines were demanding, high-impact aerobics, followed by a stretching section. Pulsating music from synthesizers played in the background, although in the first season bass and electric guitar and saxophone were also used in the exercise music scores. For the first season, music was performed by the group Shiva. An &quot;As Seen on TV&quot; vinyl LP containing tracks used on the program was released by Ronco, Inc. in 1983 in the United States. Other versions and formats were also released in Canada, the UK, and Australia under the Ronco and Chadwick Music Productions labels. The second season featured music by the trio Jermyn/King/Ouillet.

There are numerous websites hosted by fans that detail about the dancers, and include so-called screen-captures from the show. The &quot;:20 Minute Workout&quot; is a spin-off from &quot;Aerobicise&quot;, a series of home videos that were first released in 1981, which had varying subtitles of &quot;The Beginners Workout,&quot; &quot;The Ultimate Workout,&quot; and &quot;The Beautiful Workout.&quot; In 1982, a series of segments aired in the U.S. on Showtime as unscheduled filler in between features, and lasting no longer than five minutes. Both the videos and the filler featured a different cast, and unlike the show they later spawned, exercise instruction was either kept minimal, or not featured at all, and any that was present was given by an off-screen narrator. The narrator was Jami Allen, one of the show&#x27;s producers.

&quot;Aerobicise&quot; is also the name of the original 1982 pilot episode of &quot;20 Minute Workout&quot;.

Scenes from the show are visible on televisions in some scenes of 1984&#x27;s &quot;Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter&quot;, &quot;Beat Street&quot;, &quot;Sesame Street Presents: Follow That Bird&quot; and the 1994 Luc Besson film &quot;&quot;. Additionally, some original music tracks from the 1983 album were used on the US version of the television game show &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; in the mid-1980s.

<text>Clearwater National Forest with headquarters on the Nez Perce Reservation at Kamiah is located in North Central Idaho in the northwestern United States. The forest is bounded on the east by the state of Montana, on the north by the Idaho Panhandle National Forest, and on the south and west by the Nez Perce National Forest and Palouse Prairie.

The North Fork of the Clearwater and the Lochsa rivers provide miles of tumbling white water interspersed with quiet pools for migratory and resident fish. The mountains provide a habitat for raccoon, elk, moose, black bear, two species of fox, bald eagle, marten, white-tailed and mule deer, coyote, wolf packs, cougar, boreal owl, river otter, muskrat, beaver, pika, fisher, mink, and mountain goat.

In 2012, Clearwater National Forest and Nez Perce National Forest were administratively combined as Nez Perce-Clearwater National Forests, with headquarters in Kamiah, Idaho.

==Features==
The forest is and contains mountains and river drainage areas. The Lochsa and Clearwater Rivers flow through the forest region. Portions of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness are also located in the forest. In descending order of land area the forest is located in Idaho, Clearwater, and Shoshone counties. Forest Service headquarters are located in Kamiah, Idaho. There are local ranger district offices in Kooskia, Powell (near Lolo, Montana, on the Idaho/Montana state line), Orofino, and Potlatch. The North Fork Ranger Station &amp; Visitor Center in Orofino is your one-stop-shop for information about the Clearwater and Nez Perce National Forests, as well as Dworshak Dam Visitor Center and Dworshak Reservoir, popular recreation sites just nine miles northwest of Orofino.

The Clearwater National Forest is home to the well-known Jerry Johnson Hot Springs and the smaller Weir Creek Hot Springs. Both springs are accessible via trails from U.S. Highway 12 and are popular tourist attractions, drawing visitors from Idaho and western Montana.

Lewis and Clark travelled through the region in their journey westward in 1805–1804. Upon reaching Lolo Pass at the eastern edge of the forest on September 15, 1805, William Clark was quoted as saying,

From this mountain I could observe high rugged mountains in every direction as far as I could see.

The Clearwater National Forest was established on July 1, 1908, with from parts of Coeur d&#x27;Alene National Forest and Bitterroot National Forest. On October 31, 1934, part of Selway National Forest was added.

A small part of the Selway-Bitterroot Wilderness lies within Clearwater National Forest, although the largest portion of the wilderness lies in either the neighboring Nez Perce National Forest, Bitterroot National Forest, or Lolo National Forest.

<doc id="919509" wikidata="Q7884357" url="?curid=919509" title="Unfit for Command">
<text>Unfit for Command: Swift Boat Veterans Speak Out Against John Kerry is a 2004 book about then U.S. Presidential candidate John Kerry by John O&#x27;Neill and Jerome Corsi published by Regnery Publishing. The book was released at the time that ads by Swift Vets and POWs for Truth were being aired on U.S. television.

==Content and criticism==

The book criticizes Kerry&#x27;s judgment in battle, his truthfulness, his entitlement to certain medals, and his later anti-war activities. The book was based in part on interviews with veterans who served in or with Kerry&#x27;s division, and also on biographies of Kerry. Several members of Kerry&#x27;s crew stated that O&#x27;Neill failed to interview them. Neither O&#x27;Neill nor Corsi had any firsthand knowledge of Kerry&#x27;s service. O&#x27;Neill served on the Swift boats after Kerry left Vietnam and Corsi never served in Vietnam. According to the Swiftboat skipper who served with Kerry, the book was &quot;wrong.&quot;

Kerry&#x27;s fellow sailors released a point-by-point rebuttal of the claims and stated that &quot;The book&#x27;s authors don&#x27;t give Kerry&#x27;s supporters the space or the credence that they warrant.&quot; According to the &quot;Seattle Times&quot;, the government documents support Kerry&#x27;s war awards and claims. Some veterans interviewed for the book complained that their statements were edited to strip out material favorable to Kerry.

At the same time the book was being criticized, the Swift Vets and POWs for Truth group was being criticized because &quot;None of those in the attack ad by the Swift Boat group actually served on Kerry&#x27;s boat. And their statements are contrary to the accounts of Kerry and those who served under him.&quot;

After controversial statements made by Corsi became public, O&#x27;Neill denied Corsi&#x27;s coauthorship of the book, saying that Corsi was &quot;simply an editor and not really any sort of co-author.&quot; However, portions of the book contain material also found in articles posted under Corsi&#x27;s name at &quot;WinterSoldier.com&quot;, a website critical of John Kerry, and O&#x27;Neill is cited in a later book as describing Corsi as helping to write &quot;Unfit for Command&quot;, and urging him to back out of media appearances after the controversial comments became public.

==Controversy with publisher==
In 2007 Corsi, along with several other authors, sued Regnery&#x27;s parent company, Eagle Publishing, claiming the company &quot;orchestrate[d] and participate[d] in a fraudulent, deceptively concealed and self-dealing scheme to divert book sales away from retail outlets and to wholly owned subsidiary organizations within the Eagle conglomerate.&quot; The suit was dismissed on June 30, 2008.

==2008 election==
Corsi published &quot;The Obama Nation&quot; in August 2008, criticizing then U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama. Corsi&#x27;s motivations behind its publication and book itself has been compared to &quot;Unfit for Command&quot; and criticized as unsubstantiated, misleading, or inaccurate. In response, the Obama campaign issued a 40-page rebuttal called &quot;Unfit for Publication&quot;, a play on the title of Corsi&#x27;s 2004 book, on his website &quot;FightTheSmears.com&quot;, alleging serious factual errors.

<text>is a brand of caffeinated chewing gum produced in Japan by Lotte that has been sold since 1983. It is popular in Japan, partially due to its television commercials that star Jean-Claude Van Damme. After being mentioned by &quot;Wired&quot; in 2003, which described its effect as &quot;Sambuca spiked with Vicks VapoRub&quot;, Lotte Black Black became popular in the United States. The gum&#x27;s name is derived from its charcoal-like color.

Ingredients include sugar, starch syrup, grape sugar, erythritol, oolong tea extract, ginkgo extract, chrysanthemum flower extract, gum base, flavorings, coloring agents (cacao, gardenia), caffeine, and nicotinamide. A persistent urban legend holds that the gum contains nicotine, the misconception stemming from confusion with nicotinamide, a different substance related to the B vitamins.

<text>Netta is a genus of diving ducks. The name is derived from Greek &quot;Netta&quot; &quot;duck&quot;. Unlike other diving ducks, the &quot;Netta&quot; species are reluctant to dive, and feed more like dabbling ducks.

These are gregarious ducks, mainly found on fresh water. They are strong fliers; their broad, blunt-tipped wings require faster wing-beats than those of many ducks and they take off with some difficulty.

They do not walk as well on land as the dabbling ducks because their legs tend to be placed further back on their bodies to help propel them when underwater.

The probably extinct pink-headed duck, previously listed as &quot;Rhodonessa caryophyllacea&quot;, has recently been shown by phylogenetic analysis to be closely related to the red-crested pochard, so has now been transferred to the same genus, as &quot;Netta caryophyllacea&quot;. However, this has been questioned due to numerous and pronounced peculiarities of that species.

==Species==
There are 3 recognized species.

<doc id="919529" wikidata="Q839454" url="?curid=919529" title="Treble Charger">
<text>Treble Charger is a Canadian rock band formed in 1992 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, consisting of vocalist and guitarist Greig Nori, vocalist and guitarist Bill Priddle, bassist Rosie Martin and drummer Richard Mulligan. They began with a melodic indie rock style but evolved into more of a pop punk band after signing to a major label in 1997. They disbanded in 2006 and reunited in 2012. Between 1996 and 2016, Treble Charger was among the Top 150 selling Canadian artists in Canada. 

==History==
===Early years (1992–1996)===
Originally from Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, the band consisted of Nori, Priddle, Rosie Martin and Morris Palter and was named NC-17 (after the movie rating) until 1994 when an American band with the same name threatened to sue. They adopted the name Treble Charger but named their debut album &quot;NC17&quot;. &quot;NC17&quot; was released independently at first by Smokin&#x27; Worm in 1994, but it was a hit on campus radio, MuchMusic, and CFNY when it was re-released by Sonic Unyon Records in 1997.

In 1995, the band released &quot;Self Title&quot;, which included a CD-ROM track promoting 30 of Treble Charger&#x27;s favourite Canadian indie bands, including The Inbreds, Change of Heart, By Divine Right, Hayden and Thrush Hermit.

In 1996, Treble Charger signed with RCA Records in the United States.

===Shift to pop punk (1997–2006)===

1997&#x27;s &quot;Maybe It&#x27;s Me&quot; was the band&#x27;s major label debut. Palter recorded drums for only a few tracks, and, after Nori considered recording the rest of the drums himself, session drummer Mike Levesque stepped in. The album featured a more polished, commercial sound than the band&#x27;s earlier albums, and launched the hit &quot;Friend of Mine&quot;. Soon afterward, Trevor MacGregor joined as the band&#x27;s drummer. That lineup, along with several of their songs from this album, were also featured in the 1999 film &quot;Mr. Music&quot;. The band played the role of an &#x27;undiscovered&#x27; indie band that gets discovered and helps to turn fictional Tone Records around from its slump.
&quot;Wide Awake Bored&quot;, released in 2000, completed the band&#x27;s evolution to a pop-punk style. This album also featured the hit singles &quot;American Psycho&quot; and &quot;Brand New Low&quot;.

In 2001, Treble Charger performed at the Snow Jam festival in Halifax. In 2002, the band released &quot;Detox&quot;, featuring hit single &quot;Hundred Million&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Believe It All&quot;.

Priddle, identified with Treble Charger&#x27;s early indie rock direction rather than the later pop-punk, left the band in 2003. Initially, it was said he was taking a break from the group, but it later came out the departure was permanent, and Nori had asked him to leave sooner than Priddle had intended.

Kelly Osbourne guitarist Devin Bronson filled in for Priddle for the rest of the &quot;Detox&quot; tour. Priddle continued his collaborations with Broken Social Scene and is a member of his new band The Priddle Concern.

By this time, their work with and the success of their proteges Sum 41, whom Nori produced, had started to eclipse Treble Charger&#x27;s own career. In late 2004, it was reported that Treble Charger itself was on hiatus, but an animated version of the group, including Priddle, would appear, with Sum 41, on The Comedy Network series &quot;Kevin Spencer&quot;.

However, a message posted on July 20, 2004, on their official website said they were continuing to record and the band was still together. But on September 1, 2005, Nori said in an interview:

:&quot;Thanks for all the amazing support you have given us. It seems like we&#x27;re bigger now then we have ever been. I only wish more people had caught on to our music sooner so that we could have had an easier time at being a band. I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s over yet but I am saying that right now I need to focus on other things. Maybe in a while I will get the urge to write a new TC album but right now my heart&#x27;s not in it. Thanks for enjoying our music.&quot;

The hits &quot;American Psycho&quot; and &quot;Brand New Low&quot; were featured in EA Sports Hockey game &quot;NHL 2002&quot; and &quot;Hundred Million&quot; was used in &quot;NHL 2003&quot; and in . EA also used &quot;Wear Me Down&quot; and &quot;Business&quot; from the &quot;Wide Awake Bored&quot; album in Triple Play 2002. &quot;American Psycho&quot; was used in promotional advertisements for the direct-to-video movie &quot;American Pie: Band Camp&quot; and featured in the movie &quot;Dude, Where&#x27;s My Car?&quot;

On February 3, 2006, Nori disbanded Treble Charger, ending their 14-year career.

===Post-breakup activity (2006–2011)===
Nori has stopped managing Canadian band Sum 41, although he now manages other bands. He is currently a &quot;musical guru&quot; for the Canadian reality show &quot;disBAND&quot; (since renamed &quot;Much Discovered&quot;) on MuchMusic. Priddle pursues a solo career in Toronto, and released a solo album in 2008 with his new band The Priddle Concern. MacGregor currently writes music for TV and film. Palter went on to pursue degrees in contemporary percussion performance and continues to perform solo and chamber music of contemporary composers all over the world.

Treble Charger was one of the inaugural inductees into the Sault Ste. Marie Walk of Fame on September 30, 2006, during the grand opening weekend of the Steelback Centre, the city&#x27;s new sports and entertainment arena.

Nori produced Organ Thieves&#x27; first full-length studio album &quot;Somewhere Between Free Men and Slaves&quot;, which was recorded between 2010–2012 and released on April 3, 2012.

===Reunion and upcoming sixth studio album (2012–present)===
On January 15, 2012, a Twitter account was opened for the band, with the opening tweet saying &quot;Wow - it&#x27;s been a while. Might be time to knock the dust off...&quot;, which led to speculations about the band reuniting, also following Nori&#x27;s tweet &quot;Thinking I should probably call Bill, and maybe pick up some new guitar strings, hmmmm.&quot; On January 20, 2012, it was confirmed that the band will reunite (without Martin and MacGregor) and has announced plans to play a reunion show at The Indie Awards in Toronto as part of Canadian Music Week. Another show was confirmed for March 21, 2012 in Toronto, with the band playing alongside Organ Thieves. The band played three more Canadian festival shows, in June, July and November.

In 2013, the band played one headlining show on July 12, in Windsor, Ontario, with support from The Trews and Neverending White Lights.

Nori and Priddle entered the studio to record new music in September 2014. During a 2018 headlining of the Rotaryfest, the band mentioned the possibility of a new album.

The band held a VIP fundraiser on March 7, 2024, to raise money for the Algoma University music program. On July 6, 2024, Treble Charger played the Big Shiny Saturday concert in Toronto, on a bill with Bif Naked, I Mother Earth, Headstones, and The Tea Party.

On October 7, 2024, Sum 41&#x27;s Deryck Whibley released his memoir &quot;Walking Disaster&quot;, in which he accused Nori of sexual and verbal abuse during his time as the band&#x27;s manager. Nori allegedly grabbed and kissed Whibley, and when he rejected those advances, Nori became psychologically and verbally abusive. Nori denied the allegations, insisting that although the relationship began when Whibley was a teenager, it was in fact consensual.

<text>The TRS-80 MC-10 microcomputer is a lesser-known member of the TRS-80 line of home computers, produced by Tandy Corporation in the early 1980s and sold through their RadioShack chain of electronics stores. It was a low-cost alternative to Tandy&#x27;s own TRS-80 Color Computer to compete with entry-level machines such as the VIC-20 and Sinclair ZX81.

The MC-10 was of value primarily to hobbyists and as an introduction to computer programming.It was not a commercial success and was discontinued only a year after its introduction.

== Description ==

About the size of a hardcover book, the MC-10 has four kilobytes of RAM, a Motorola MC6803 eight-bit microprocessor, a built-in serial port, and graphics capabilities similar to those of the original Color Computer (provided by the same MC6847 video display generator).

The MC-10 includes a BASIC interpreter in ROM and uses regular audio cassettes for bulk storage. Text and graphics are displayed on a television set via a built-in RF modulator. Less common for machines in its class is the integrated RS-232 serial port, which allows the MC-10 to use line printers and modems without additional hardware.

At the time of its release in 1983, the MC-10&#x27;s specifications were underwhelming (at least for its home market; North America). Disk drives, full-travel keyboards, medium-resolution graphics, and complete 64-kilobyte memory banks were becoming popular features for home computers; the MC-10 offered none of these, severely limiting the functions it could perform and the range of users to whom it could appeal.

The MC-10 was discontinued in 1984, along with the 16 KB memory upgrade and small amount of cassette-based software that had been released for it.

* I/O Ports:
** RS-232C serial interface (300-9600 baud; 600 baud from BASIC)
** Cassette interface (1500 baud)
** Internal RF modulator
** Memory expansion interface

Although the memory expansion interface connected directly to the CPU bus and could have been used for many applications, the edge connector involved had an unusual number of pins and was difficult to obtain.

The RS-232C serial interface had extremely limited usefulness. Although the 6803 CPU conveniently includes a built-in UART, it was left unconnected and did not assist the RS-232C interface in any manner. In part, this is because a single 3.58 MHz TV colorburst crystal is used to generate video and clock the CPU, and this clock rate could not be divided by an integer to obtain any standard baud rate for the UART. As a result, programs have to shift bits individually into and out of the RS-232C interface, a mode of operation that entails atypical and especially critical timing requirements.

The cassette interface has similar difficulties, plus a few. Although Micro Color Basic includes an undocumented codice_1 command for loading machine-language programs and an undocumented codice_2 function for manipulating variables as memory, there is no corresponding codice_3 command (documented or otherwise) to permit machine language programs to be saved to tape.

== Software ==
A limited amount of software was available on cassette for the MC-10, including Lunar Lander, Checkers, and a machine-language pinball program. However, as most programs written in Basic for other TRS-80 models were compatible with the MC-10, many books with BASIC programs were available for the user who was willing to type in the code.

== Clone ==
A clone of the MC-10, the Alice, was marketed in France through a collaboration among Tandy, Matra and Hachette.

<text>A parody advertisement is a fictional advertisement for a non-existent product, either done within another advertisement for an actual product, or done simply as parody of advertisements—used either as a way of ridiculing or drawing negative attention towards a real advertisement or such an advertisement&#x27;s subject, or as a comedic device, such as in a comedy skit or sketch.

==Overview==
A parody advertisement should not be confused with a fictional brand name used in a program to avoid giving free advertising to an actual product, or to the use of a fictional brand name in an actual advertisement used for comparison, which is sometimes done as opposed to comparing the product to an actual competitor. (In some countries, Germany or Norway for example, it is illegal to make disparaging comments about a competitor&#x27;s product in an advertisement, even if the statements are proven to be true.)

A parody advertisement can be one in which the advertisement appears to &quot;actually be a real ad for&quot; the false product, but then the advertisement is somehow exposed to be a parody and if it is an actual advertisement the actual brand becomes clear. If it is simply a parody it may or may not indicate that it is one.

==Notable examples==
===Candy===
During the 1960s and 1970s, the Topps Chewing Gum Company released a product called &quot;Wacky Packages&quot;, in which stickers showing various products were shown in ridiculous scenes, such as
*Hawaiian Punch fruit drink, was parodied as &quot;Hawaiian Punks. Beats you to a fruit-juicy pulp.&quot;
*Eveready Batteries, with its image of a cat having 9 lives, was parodied as &quot;NeveReady Batteries, has 0 lives,&quot; and an image of a dead cat.

===Film===
*&quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;: In addition to &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot;″s (in)famous fake movie trailers, the film has a parody ad for the fake products &#x27;Booty Sweat&#x27; energy drink and &#x27;Bust-A-Nut&#x27; candy bar. As part of the film&#x27;s marketing &#x27;Booty Sweat&#x27; has been made into a real life energy drink.
*&quot;Bamboozled&quot;: Spike Lee&#x27;s satire has fake ads for &#x27;Da Bomb&#x27; malt liquor and a racistly named parody of Tommy Hilfiger. In addition to the appearance in &quot;Bamboozled&quot;, &#x27;Da Bomb&#x27; makes appearances in three other Spike Lee films, &quot;Clockers&quot;, &quot;Inside Man&quot;, and &quot;Sucker Free City&quot;.
*&quot;Grindhouse&quot;: The film &quot;Grindhouse&quot; has trailers for a number of fictional films. These include &quot;Machete&quot;, in which the FBI hires a mercenary rather than risk their own agents on a potential suicide mission; &quot;Werewolf Women of the SS&quot; about a group of women who run a Nazi death camp; &quot;Don&#x27;t&quot;, an exploitative horror film; &quot;Thanksgiving&quot;, a slasher film in the genre of the &quot;Halloween&quot; series; and &quot;Hobo With a Shotgun&quot; about a vigilante killer similar to the premise of the film &quot;Death Wish&quot;. The trailer for &quot;Machete&quot; was so well received it has actually been made into a full-length feature film as well as &quot;Hobo with a Shotgun&quot;.
*&quot;RoboCop&quot;: Parody advertisements are seen throughout the &quot;RoboCop&quot; franchise for products such as the &quot;6000 SUX&quot;, a parody of the low fuel economy of many American-made cars at that time, the game &quot;NUKEM&quot;, a parody of Battleship, and &quot;Magnavolt&quot;, a car security system designed to electrocute and kill would-be carjackers.
*&quot;UHF&quot;: The Weird Al Yankovic film &quot;UHF&quot; has a few fake ads within the film, such as &quot;Spatula City&quot;, a store that sells nothing but spatulas, as well as promos for fake TV shows and movies like &quot;Conan the Librarian&quot; and &quot;Gandhi II&quot;.
*&quot;Cяazy People&quot;: The 1990 film &quot;Cяazy People&quot; is about an advertising executive who work in a psychiatric hospital with a number of patients to create &quot;truthful&quot; advertisements, often over-the-top and with explicit language, for mostly real-life products and brands.
*The 2013 film &quot;Movie 43&quot; featured a few parody ads such as &quot;iBabe&quot; spots, &quot;Machine Kids&quot; (a mock public service announcement), and a faux Tampax commercial.
*&quot;C.S.A.: The Confederate States of America&quot;: The 2004 mockumentary about the history of how the fictional Confederate States of America rose to power after winning the American Civil War is presented as a documentary airing on Confederate television. As such, the movie has commercial parodies that are racialist and are aimed towards white slave-owning families. Many of the products advertised in the film actually existed in the past.

===Television===
*The American sketch comedy series &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; produces fictional commercials on a regular basis, usually shown after the guest host&#x27;s monologue as an &quot;introductory commercial&quot;, prior to the beginning of the main show. While many of these ads parody actual TV commercials, they are simple &quot;comedic parodies&quot; of the style of the real advertisement rather than its product.
*Likewise, many subsequent sketch comedy programs have utilized parody advertisements, including &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;, &quot;MADtv&quot;, &quot;In Living Color&quot; and &quot;The Idiot Box&quot;.
*&quot;Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!&quot; frequently featured surreal advertisements for products and services from an in-universe megacorporation known as Cinco. These commercials often advertised products of an outlandish, unappealing, or otherwise questionable nature, including badly-named toys such as the &quot;B&#x27;owl&quot; (a cross between a bat and owl) and &quot;T&#x27;ird&quot; (a cross between a bird and turtle), products based on outdated technology (such as the &quot;Cinco-Fone&quot; and &quot;Cinco MIDI Organizer&quot;), products related to urination and defecation, unusual body modifications (such as a &quot;Food Tube&quot;, &quot;Bro-oche&quot;, and &quot;Eye Tanning System&quot;) that require the user&#x27;s teeth be removed as part of installation, and a children&#x27;s jukebox that generates hallucinatory &quot;dance tones&quot;. Likewise, some sketches consisted of promos for equally-surreal programs on the in-universe television station Channel 5.
*&quot;Short Circuitz&quot;, an MTV sketch comedy show starring Nick Cannon, often featured parodies of popular advertisements. Its accompanying website, ShortCircuitz.mtv.com, allows users to upload their own parody advertisements to compete for a cash prize and a spot on the show.

====Fictional advertisements for real products====
*In the 1990s, the most famous series of parody advertisements were those for the Energizer battery. A parody itself of a Duracell battery commercial, in its initial commercial episode first shown in October 1989, a toy pink rabbit, is being filmed in a commercial. The toy, powered by the battery, escapes the studio and begins a rampage, pounding a drum and rolling through other commercials being made, including those for coffee, wine, a fictional upcoming TV series, long-distance service, breakfast cereal, and sinus medication. A total of 120 fictional commercials and 4 real ones (for Twinkies, Purina Cat Chow, Pepsi, and Duracell) in both English and Spanish involving the Energizer Bunny were made.
*In 1991, Eveready Battery Company sued the Adolph Coors Company over an ad for Coors beer it was producing, which showed actor Leslie Nielsen in a full-size rabbit suit pounding a drum, which was parodying Eveready&#x27;s Energizer Bunny commercials, which themselves are parodies of Duracell advertisements and television program previews. Eveready claimed Coors&#x27; ad constituted copyright and trademark infringement. The court ruled that Coors&#x27; ad was a valid parody of Eveready&#x27;s, considering that Mr. Nielsen &quot;is not a toy, and does not run on batteries.&quot; &quot;Eveready Battery Co. v. Adolph Coors Co.&quot;, 765 F. Supp. 440 (N.D. Ill. 1991).
*The GEICO insurance company ran a series of television commercials in which a victim in a disadvantaged situation hears their fate from the antagonist, that they have good news, only the good news is for the antagonist (The antagonist will usually say as the punchline, &quot;I just saved a bunch of money on my car insurance by switching to GEICO&quot;). Some examples involved a fictional congressional hearing where the witness (the victim) is being informed he is subject to criminal penalties while the chairman of the committee (the antagonist) has saved money on his car insurance, a home repair show reminiscent of Bob Vila showing a victim couple with a home badly in need of repair, a fictional news report on a volcanic eruption, and a fictional hair restoration commercial. Another example parodied advertisements for reality TV shows, by showing a couple getting married, and getting disgruntled at living in a tiny house (the punchline: a voiceover saying &quot;The drama may be real, but it won&#x27;t save you any money on car insurance&quot;, followed by the wife asking her spouse in their tiny hot tub &quot;Why haven&#x27;t you called GEICO?&quot;).
*The Coca-Cola company&#x27;s lemon-lime soft drink Sprite ran a series of ads for other fictional drink products, which had actual or fictional celebrities endorsing the other product, with the implication that the fictional product was inadequate for quenching one&#x27;s thirst.
*The gimmick of characters from a commercial invading other spoof ads was first used by the British Lager brewers Carling Black Label. The advert featured a wild west outlaw being roped by a posse and dragging them off their horses and into adverts for a love compilation Album and Washing up powder.
*The 2005 &quot;Poser Mobile Posse&quot; in a print, online and point-of-sale campaign created by Publicis Seattle for T-Mobile&#x27;s pay-as-you-go cell phone plan was an ethnically diverse group of hip-hop posers with racially stereotyped Latino, Asian, and white characters like &quot;Big Spenda Lopez&quot;, &quot;The Fee Jones&quot;, &quot;25 cent Chang&quot; who inauthentically appropriate Black culture, and in one video ad arrive in a stereotypical rice burner faux sports car. The group ambush cell phone customers demanding hidden cell phone service charges and fees, but are rebuffed and called &quot;posers&quot; or &quot;clowns&quot;. It is somewhat of a parody on Boost Mobile&#x27;s &quot;Where You At?&quot; advertising campaign which features prominent hip-hop artists such as Ludacris, Kanye West, and The Game.

===Magazines and print===
====Mad Magazine====
&quot;Mad Magazine&quot; was notorious for regularly running obviously fictional ads for nonexistent products. However, many of these nonexistent products were clearly intended to be parodies of specific well-known brands of real-world products; frequently, the fictional advertisement in &quot;Mad&quot; parodied a specific genuine ad campaign for a recognizable brand-name product. For example, in the 1960s (when cigarettes could still be advertised on television), Kent Cigarettes ran a commercial featuring a series of line drawings illustrating the lyrics of a catchy jingle titled &quot;The Taste of Kent&quot;. &quot;Mad&quot; promptly ran a fake print ad, using drawings which parodied the style of the line art, illustrating verses about lung cancer and emphysema to a lyric that parodied Kent&#x27;s jingle, now titled &quot;The Taste of Death&quot;.

According to Frank Jacobs&#x27;s biography &quot;The Mad World of William M. Gaines&quot;, Mad&#x27;s parodies of real advertisements generated so much attention that Mad publisher William Gaines received requests from the promotional departments of many real products, asking Mad to run parodies of their advertisements. Gaines&#x27;s standard reply to such requests: &quot;Come up with a really stupid ad campaign, and we&#x27;ll be happy to make fun of it.&quot;

====Hustler====
The most serious incident involving a fictional advertisement in a magazine caused a lawsuit which reached all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, when Hustler Magazine ran a parody of a liquor ad which would ask people about their &quot;first time.&quot; In the actual ad, what we are led to believe is that the person is being asked about their first sexual experience, when it turns out the question is about their first time they used the sponsor&#x27;s product, a liqueur.

In the parody advertisement in &quot;Hustler&quot;, the Reverend Jerry Falwell, at the time a prominent promoter of social conservatism and opponent of pornography, is supposedly quoted describing the first time he had sexual intercourse with his mother in an outhouse while intoxicated. Falwell sued Hustler Magazine and its publisher Larry Flynt for invasion of privacy, libel and emotional distress. The jury found for the magazine on the issue of libel (the fictional advertisement clearly indicated it was a parody), but awarded Mr. Falwell $350,000 in damages for the emotional distress and invasion of privacy claims. The Supreme Court ruled that, since the advertisement was so obviously a parody that no reasonable person could have believed it, Falwell was not libelled and thus is not entitled to damages for emotional distress, and he was not entitled to damages for invasion of privacy because he is a well-known public figure. &quot;Hustler Magazine, Inc. et al. v. Jerry Falwell&quot;, 485 U.S. 46, (1988).

====Other examples====
*The Adbusters Media Foundation&#x27;s magazine &quot;Adbusters&quot; features advertisement parodies that are intended as sharp commentary on the social implications of either the product or the advertising campaign involved (also known as &quot;Culture jamming&quot;). One example is a parody of the &quot;Joe Camel&quot; advertising campaign for Camel Cigarettes, with a pseudo Joe Camel in a hospital bed, his head bald and an intravenous drip bottle leading into his arm, with the legend &quot;Joe Chemo&quot; on the faux ad, implying that the many years of smoking cigarettes has left &quot;Joe&quot; with cancer and requiring chemotherapy treatment. 
*The Wrigley Company created fictional print ads for Juicy Fruit, such as boy bands, an upcoming fictional movie poster, and a phony handheld game system.
*Games Magazine, a monthly publication featuring game- and puzzle-related material, through the 1980s carried a fake ad feature noted (without page number) in each issue&#x27;s contents with the tagline, &quot;Which of the pitches is full of hitches?&quot; One featured item was an abacus simulator running on PCs made by the nonexistent Nat Soh Software Co. of Hong Kong . The challenge to readers was to scrutinize all of the ads to spot the fake.

===Miscellaneous===
*Superhero-themed rock band The Aquabats are notorious for styling their live shows after Saturday morning cartoons, including engaging in scripted onstage battles with costumed monsters and villains. Normally, when these villains crash the stage, the concert will &quot;cut to commercial&quot; and a video screen behind the band will project a pre-recorded advertisement for an outlandish (and obviously fake) toy or product before returning to the show. In 2012, The Aquabats produced their own television series, &quot;The Aquabats! Super Show!&quot;, which also regularly features such parody commercials.
*An edited ad for a fictional Girl of the Year character wearing a track suit, bob haircut and wielding a semi-automatic pistol while defiantly violating face mask guidelines mandated due to the COVID-19 pandemic as a personification of the &quot;Karen&quot; stereotype, provoked criticism from Mattel subsidiary American Girl who took umbrage to the use of their name and trade dress, stating that they were &quot;disgusted&quot; by a post from brand strategist Adam Padilla under the online persona &quot;Adam the Creator&quot;, and &quot;are working with the appropriate teams at American Girl to ensure this copyright violation is handled appropriately.&quot; Boing Boing however expressed doubts over the merits of American Girl&#x27;s proposed legal action against the &quot;Karen&quot; parodies citing the Streisand effect, though it has also noted the debate on whether the satirical intent of the parody advertisement is protected by law.
*Italy&#x27;s most listened radio show &quot;Lo Zoo di 105&quot; ran a parody ad featuring a fictional luxury watches&#x27; brand Orologi Fumagazzi: two young listeners registered the trademark overnight, launching a real watches&#x27; collection with hilarious names and descriptions the very same week.

<text>A cuesta () is a hill or ridge with a gentle slope on one side, and a steep slope on the other. In geology, the term is more specifically applied to a ridge where a harder sedimentary rock overlies a softer layer, the whole being tilted somewhat from the horizontal. This results in a long and gentle backslope called a dip slope that conforms with the dip of resistant strata, called caprock. Where erosion has exposed the frontslope of this, a steep slope or escarpment occurs. The resulting terrain may be called scarpland.

==Definition==
In general usage, a cuesta is a hill or ridge with a gentle slope (backslope) on one side, and a steep slope (frontslope) on the other. The word is from Spanish: &quot;flank or slope of a hill; hill, mount, sloping ground&quot;. In geology and geomorphology, cuesta refers specifically to an asymmetric ridge with a long and gentle backslope called a dip slope that conforms with the dip of a resistant stratum or strata, called caprock. The outcrop of the caprock forms a steeper or even cliff-like frontslope (escarpment), cutting through the dipping strata that comprise the cuesta.

==Formation==
Cuestas are the expression of extensive outcrops of gently dipping strata, typically sedimentary strata, that consist of alternating beds of weak or loosely cemented strata, i.e. shale, mudstone, and marl and hard, well-lithified strata, i.e. sandstone and limestone. The surfaces of the hard, erosion-resistant rock strata form the caprock of the backslope (dip-slope) of the cuesta, where erosion has preferentially removed the weaker strata. The frontslope of the cuesta consists of an escarpment that cuts across the bedding of the strata comprising it. Because of the gently dipping nature of the strata that forms a cuesta, a significant shift in horizontal location will take place as the landscape is lowered by erosion. Because the slope of a cuesta dips in the same direction as the sedimentary strata, the dip angle of this bedding (θ) can be calculated by (&quot;v&quot; / &quot;h&quot;) = tan(θ) where &quot;v&quot; is equal to the vertical distance and &quot;h&quot; is equal to the horizontal distance perpendicular to the strike of the beds.

Cuestas, homoclinal ridges, and hogbacks comprise a sequence of landforms that form a gradational continuum. These landforms differ only on the steepness of their backslopes and the relative differences in the inclination of their backslopes and frontslopes. These differences depend upon whether the dip of the strata from which they have been eroded are either nearly vertical, moderately dipping, or gently dipping. Because of their gradational nature, the exact angle of the backslope that separates these landforms is arbitrary and some differences in the specific angles used to define these landforms occur in the scientific literature. It also can be difficult to sharply distinguish immediately adjacent members of this series of landforms because of their gradational nature.

==Examples==
In North America, two well-known cuestas in western/central New York and southern Ontario are the Onondaga escarpment and the Niagara Escarpment. The dip of the Onondaga is about 40 feet per mile (about 7.6 m/km) to the south. In their most populated sections both escarpments edges face north, running roughly parallel to the southern Lake Ontario shoreline and, for the former, the Mohawk River.

The Gulf Coastal Plain in Texas is punctuated by a series of cuestas that parallel the coast, as are most coastal plains. The Reynosa Plateau is the most coast-ward cuesta, which has surface expression with the Bordes-Oakville escarpment, on the northwest side and a low ridge on the eastern boundary, called the Reynosa Cuesta, where the deposits dip below later Pliocene-Pleistocene deposits of the Willis and Lissie Formations.

Cuestas have less dramatic expression in the United Kingdom, with two notable examples being the northwest-facing escarpment of the Cretaceous chalk White Horse Hills and the similarly aligned escarpment of the Jurassic limestones in the Cotswolds, sometimes called the Cotswold Edge. Other examples include the Brecon Beacons, Wenlock Edge, the Chilterns, the North and South Downs and the Greensand Ridge of Kent and Surrey

In continental Europe, the Swabian Alb offers particularly good views of cuestas in Jurassic rock. In France, the term for a cuesta is the same as for a coastline: &quot;côte&quot;. Notable French cuestas are the wine-growing regions of Côte d&#x27;Or.

The Machinchang Formation outcrops in the Langkawi islands off the coast of northwestern Malaysia. The formation is one of the oldest exposed rock units in Southeast Asia and has an extensive eroded anticline cuesta topography—dating back to Cambrian.

<text>NESL is a parallel programming language developed at Carnegie Mellon by the SCandAL project and released in 1993. It integrates various ideas from parallel algorithms, functional programming, and array programming languages.

The most important new ideas behind NESL are
*Nested data parallelism: this feature offers the benefits of data parallelism, concise code that is easy to understand and debug, while being well suited for irregular algorithms, such as algorithms on trees, graphs or sparse matrices.
*A language based performance model: this gives a formal way to calculate the work and depth of a program. These measures can be related to running time on parallel machines.

The main design guideline for NESL was to make parallel programming easy and portable. Algorithms are typically significantly more concise in NESL than in most other parallel programming languages, and the code closely resembles high-level pseudocode.

NESL handles nested data parallelism by using the flattening transformation to convert nested data parallelism to flat data parallelism. This works by storing nested vectors as the nested data and a segment descriptor of vector lengths, separately.
This flattening transform, however, can increase the asymptotic work and space complexity of the original program, leading to a much less efficient result.

==Influences==
NESL heavily influenced Data Parallel Haskell.

<doc id="919580" wikidata="Q7640488" url="?curid=919580" title="Sunlight Park">
<text>Sunlight Park was the first baseball stadium in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The all wood structure was built in 1886 at a cost of $7,000 by the International League baseball team the Toronto Baseball Club (renamed the Toronto Maple Leafs in 1902).

It was initially known as the Toronto Baseball Grounds. It stood south of Queen Street East, west of Broadview Avenue, north of Eastern Avenue, on the east side of the Smith Estate near the Don River, and had seating for 2,200 spectators, including a 550-seat reserved section. The stadium&#x27;s grand opening was held on May 22, 1886 for an afternoon game against the &quot;Rochesters&quot; of Rochester, New York. It came to be known as Sunlight Park after the Lever Brothers&#x27; Sunlight Soap Works was built south of Eastern Avenue. The stadium hosted the city’s first professional baseball championship in 1887. The team and league folded in 1890. The Torontos, called the Canucks of the Eastern League, played in the park until 1896 when new owners moved the team to their new Hanlan&#x27;s Point Stadium. The park was used for local baseball, football, and lacrosse leagues until well into the 20th century (1913), when encroaching industrial uses predominated.

Today the site is a block of condo lofts, a car dealership car-park and the Don Valley Parkway on ramp, Eastern Avenue diversion. The street Sunlight Park Road bears witness to the past, being the remnant Eastern Avenue bridge approach cut by the parkway. The site is bounded by the Don Valley Parkway and the industrial buildings of the former Lever Brothers.

<text>Karlsbad (; South Franconian: &quot;Kallsbad&quot;) is a municipality in the district of Karlsruhe, in Baden-Württemberg, Germany.

== Demographics ==
Population development:

== Geography and history ==
The municipality is situated on the Alb-Pfinz Plateau in the northern Black Forest, 8 km east-southeast of Ettlingen, 13 km southeast of Karlsruhe, and 15 km west of Pforzheim.

=== Constituent villages ===
The municipality of Karlsbad consists of 5 previously independent single-village municipalities united by the municipality reform in 1971:

==== Langensteinbach ====
==== Auerbach ====
==== Mutschelbach ====
==== Spielberg ====
==== Ittersbach ====
=== Neighbours ===

==== Karlsruhe ====

In the north Karlsbad borders to Karlsruhe and its neighbourhoods Stupferich and Palmbach. Both of these neighbourhoods form part of a group of neighbourhood known as Karlsruhe&#x27;s Bergdörfer (&quot;mountain villages&quot;). Most of Karlsruhe is situated within the Upper Rhine Plain, not so the Bergdörfer: They are situated on the mountains of the northern Black Forest and the western Kraichgau. They share the autobahn exit Karlsbad, situated within their borders, with their neighbour municipality and are connected with it through the Landesstraßen L609 and L623.

===== Stupferich =====

The village Stupferich is a southeastern neighbourhood of Karlsruhe. Until it was integrated into the city of Karlsruhe in 1972 it was an independent municipality. In 2000 the village celebrated its 900th anniversary. In December 2011 it had about 2,650 inhabitants.

===== Palmbach =====

The village Palmbach is an eastern neighbourhood of Karlsruhe. Until it was integrated into the city of Karlsruhe in 1975 it formed part of the municipality Wetterbsbach composed of the villages Palmbach and Grünwettersbach. Palmbach was founded in 1701 by 28 Waldensian refugee families consisting of 111 people from La Balme in the French Alps on an area of 306 acres belonging to Grünwettersbach. They called their settlement &quot;La Balme&quot;, just like the place, they came from, which turned into the village&#x27;s current name still during the 18th century. In March 2012 Palmbach had about 1,800 inhabitants.

==== Waldbronn ====

The western frontier of Karlsbad leads to Waldbronn, a municipality in the district of Karlsruhe at the borders of the Alb-Pfinz Plateau and within the Alb Valley with some 12,500 inhabitants. Just like Karlsbad, this municipality is also product of the municipality reform in Baden-Württemberg. Its current constituent villages and former independent municipalities joined the former single-village municipality Reichenbach:

* Etzenrot and Neurod (joined in 1971)
* Busenbach (joined in 1972)

In 1974 the enlarged municipality Reichenbach was renamed and received the name &quot;Waldbronn&quot;

==== Marxzell ====

The southwestern frontier of Karlsbad borders to Marxzell, a municipality in the district of Karlsruhe with about 5,300 inhabitants (as of December 2011) consisting of the former independent municipalities

* Burbach: 
Burbach, Marxzell (also part of the other two former municipalities], Metzlinschwander Hof and the houses Fischweier and Weimersmühle.
* Pfaffenrot: 
Pfaffenrot and Gertrudenhof
* Schielberg: 
Schielberg, &quot;Bergschmiede, Hotel&quot;, Schlotterhof, Steinhäusle and Frauenalb

==== Remchingen ====

The municipality Remchingen in the Enz district borders to Karlsbad on the northeastern frontier of the last-mentioned. It is located within the Pfinz Valley, counts about 12,000 inhabitants and consists of the following former municipalities:

* Nöttingen (bordering to Auerbach),
* Wilferdingen
* Singen

Historic ties between Karlsbad and Remchingen become obvious comparing the coats of arms of the former municipalities. The flowers on Mutschelbach&#x27;s coat of arms are quite similar to those of all three parts of Remchingen.

In addition, in both Nöttingen and Auerbach remains of Roman settlements have been found that can be dated back to circa 80 A.D.

==== Keltern ====

To the east of Karlsbad borders Keltern, a municipality within the Enz district with approximately 9,000 inhabitants. It consists of the following villages:

* Dietenhausen
* Ellmendingen
* Weiler
* Dietenhausen
* Niebelsbach

==== Straubenhardt ====

This municipality is located southeast of Karlsbad. Straubenhardt forms part of the Enz district with a total of approximately 11,000 inhabitants and is made up of the following previously independent municipalities:

* Conweiler
* Feldrennach
* Pfinzweiler
* Langenalb
* Ottenhausen
* Schwann

== Politics ==

=== Coat of arms ===
=== Municipal partnership ===
Karlsbad is a municipal partner of the following towns and municipalities:
* Heldrungen, Kyffhäuserkreis en Thuringia, 
* Hüttau, Salzburg (state) ()

== Infrastructure ==
Karlsbad can be accessed via the road or by train. Baden Airpark, the closest international airport, is situated at a straight-line distance of about 34 kilometers.

=== Railway ===

Langensteinbach, Spielberg and Ittersbach are all connected to each other and to the cities of Karlsruhe and Ettlingen among others by the Busenbach–Ittersbach branch of the Alb Valley Railway (&quot;Albtalbahn&quot;), an electric railway that forms part of the Karlsruhe Stadtbahn. Ittersbach is the terminus of the branch, which operates as line S 11.
Buses connect Auerbach an Mutschelbach to the mentioned railway through the train stops in Langensteinbach.

<text>Hanlan&#x27;s Point Stadium was a baseball stadium and lacrosse grounds in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was erected in 1897 at Hanlan&#x27;s Point on the Toronto Islands for the minor league Toronto Maple Leafs baseball club. It was destroyed by fire twice, in 1903, and again in 1909. Adjacent to the Hanlan&#x27;s Point Amusement Park, the site was in use for various sports until the late 1930s.

==History==
Initially, a grandstand and bleachers were built on the site. When the Toronto Ferry Company acquired the Leafs, it moved the team from Sunlight Park near the mouth of the Don River on the mainland to the Hanlan&#x27;s Point field on the islands. The Toronto Ferry Company built a new semi-circular grandstand, with the old grandstand converted to bleachers. The Maple Leafs played at the stadium until 1901, when they moved to Diamond Park on the mainland. The Hanlan&#x27;s stadium and the adjacent bar, both managed by Lol Solman, were destroyed by a fire on September 8, 1903. The stadium was rebuilt and reopened on May 24, 1904 and it was reported that there were so many people on the reopening, that the ferries couldn&#x27;t carry everyone to the Toronto Islands. 

In 1908, the stadium was replaced with Maple Leaf Park, a new baseball stand and grounds at Hanlan&#x27;s Point and the Maple Leafs returned. When it was built, Maple Leaf Park had 3,000 seats, covered bleachers that could accommodate another 4,500, and uncovered bleachers with room for about another 1,800. On opening day, May 12, 1908, the Leafs came from behind to defeat the Jersey City Skeeters in extra innings with paid attendance of 6,192. The stadium was destroyed by a fire on August 10, 1909 which also wiped out the amusement park at Hanlan&#x27;s Point and Hanlan&#x27;s Hotel, which was not rebuilt after the fire. For the rest of the season, the Maple Leafs had to return to the smaller Diamond Park.

A new stadium was built on the site, opening in 1910 and described at the time as the largest in all of the minor leagues with over 17,000 seats. It was designed by Toronto-based architect Charles F. Wagner. Initial advertising referred to the site as Hanlan&#x27;s Point Stadium. It was also sometimes called Island Stadium. The first baseball game at the stadium—but not the first event in the building—took place on May 9, 1910 with the Leafs rallying to defeat the Baltimore Orioles in the bottom of the ninth inning in front of a paid crowd of 12,867.

The stadium is notable for being the location of Babe Ruth&#x27;s first professional home run on September 5, 1914. Ruth was playing for the visiting Providence Grays and pitched a one-hitter against the Leafs to go along with his three-run home run over the right-field wall in a 9-0 win for Providence. A historic plaque commemorates the occasion near the Hanlan&#x27;s Point dock.

The Maple Leafs left the Toronto Islands for Maple Leaf Stadium after the 1925 season. In March 1927, the parks commissioner of the City of Toronto requested tenders for the demolition of the bleachers. The city architect had deemed them to be unsafe. The field remained in use until the construction of the Toronto Island Airport in 1937, when the area surrounding the airfield (where the old terminal building is now located) was converted to parkland. Two markers were placed near the site along Lakeshore Avenue.

<doc id="919593" wikidata="Q1191930" url="?curid=919593" title="Wudaokou">
<text>Wudaokou (), whose name is a literal reference to the fifth level crossing of the Jingbao Railway, is a neighborhood in the Haidian District of North West Beijing, famous for its close distances to universities including Tsinghua University and Peking University. 

It is around from the center of Beijing, between the Fourth and Fifth ring roads, and has good public transport links including a station on Line 13 of the Beijing Subway. 

It became a commercial center in Haidian during the 1950s following the establishment of several universities. The high price of real estate in this area has led to it being dubbed the &quot;Center of the Universe (宇宙中心).&quot; 

Until as recently as 2001 the area consisted mainly of Hutong neighborhoods and late 1960s apartment blocks, but major development has erased many of these old structures, replacing them with luxury apartments and technology parks. Some may also refer to Wudaokou as Koreatown, for the large number of Koreans in the area.

==Location==
Wudaokou is close to a large number of universities and research institutes, including Tsinghua University, Beijing Language and Culture University, Beihang University, Peking University, China University of Geosciences, University of Science and Technology Beijing, and Beijing Forestry University, and as such has a large student population. Google China used to have an office here.

Wudaokou is also known for its large number of international students. Wudaokou&#x27;s popularity as an international student area is reflected in its large number of bars and nightclubs (including Wu Club, Global Club, Sugar Shack, Lush, Sensation and Propaganda), which generally offer cheaper prices than many similar clubs in more central areas, such as Sanlitun. The Wudaokou area is also notable for its large number of Koreans, with many signs in Korean advertising businesses, restaurants and bars located within its vicinity. Korean students make up the largest foreign student population.

While centrally located along Beijing&#x27;s Line 13 subway, the 2-lane in each direction Chengfu Lu (Chengfu Road), which runs east–west under an elevated rapid transit line, suffers from severe traffic congestion problems regardless of rush hour primarily because of heavy foot traffic due to subway users, and because it is the only route connecting the Eastern and Western sides of Wudaokou across the railway corridor. Congestion has improved since the under-grounding of the heavy rail line as part of the Beijing–Zhangjiakou intercity railway project, which eliminated the level crossing from which Wudaokou draws its name.

== Korean population ==
Prior to the 2000s the Wudaokou area was the most popular area for South Koreans. It was the oldest of the major Korean settlements. Beginning in the early 1990s South Korean students who were studying Chinese for one to two year periods so they could enter Chinese universities began congregating in Wudaokou. The growth of Wangjing in Chaoyang District had weakened Wudaokou as a Korean area.
