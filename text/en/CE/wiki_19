<text>The J. Geils Band was an American rock band formed in 1967, in Worcester, Massachusetts, under the leadership of guitarist John &quot;J.&quot; Geils. The original band members included vocalist Peter Wolf, harmonica and saxophone player Richard &quot;Magic Dick&quot; Salwitz, drummer Stephen Bladd, vocalist/keyboardist Seth Justman, and bassist Danny Klein. Wolf and Justman served as principal songwriters. The band played R&amp;B-influenced blues rock during the 1970s and soon achieved commercial success before moving toward a more mainstream radio-friendly sound in the early 1980s, which brought the band to its commercial peak. They performed a mix of cover songs of classic blues and R&amp;B songs, along with original compositions written primarily by Wolf and Justman, as well as some group compositions written under the pseudonymous name Juke Joint Jimmy, representing compositions credited to the entire band as a whole. After Wolf left the band in 1983 to pursue a solo career, the band released one more album in 1984 with Justman on lead vocals, before breaking up in 1985. Beginning in 1999, the band had several reunions until the death of its namesake, J. Geils, on April 11, 2017.

The band first released several Top 40 singles in the early 1970s, including a cover of the song &quot;Lookin&#x27; For A Love&quot; by The Valentinos (which reached No. 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1972), as well as the single &quot;Give It to Me&quot; (No. 30 in 1973). Their biggest hits included &quot;Must of Got Lost&quot; (No. 12 in 1975), &quot;Come Back&quot; (No. 32 in 1980), &quot;Love Stinks&quot; (which reached No. 38 in 1980 and was featured in several films), &quot;Centerfold&quot; (No. 1 in 1982), and &quot;Freeze-Frame&quot; (No. 4 in 1982).

==Early days==
The band started in the mid-1960s while John Geils was attending Worcester Polytechnic Institute for a couple of semesters after transferring from Northeastern University in Boston (where he lived in &quot;The Playboy Room&quot; of the Gamma Phi Kappa fraternity). Originally named Snoopy and the Sopwith Camels, the group was an acoustic blues trio with Geils on guitar, bassist Danny Klein (&quot;Dr. Funk&quot;), and harmonica player Richard Salwitz (&quot;Magic Dick&quot;).

In 1968, the band switched focus, going electric and recruiting two fellow musicians from Boston band The Hallucinations, drummer Stephen Jo Bladd and vocalist Peter Blankenfeld, a fast-talking former WBCN disc jockey with the air name Peter Wolf. Initial influences included James Cotton and Little Walter – in a 2008 interview, harmonica star Magic Dick said they were all &quot;harp freaks&quot;.

They became The J. Geils Blues Band, later dropping the word &quot;Blues&quot; from the band name. Soon, fan Seth Justman joined on keyboards and the band started to earn a sizable following in the Boston area.

The band took its time carefully considering various offers of contracts. Unofficial live recordings circulated: as noted in &quot;Creem&quot;, &quot;WBCN had the infamous J. Geils &#x27;bathroom tapes&#x27; (that were almost exactly what the name implies) and a tape of their performance at Alternate Media Conference at Goddard College, but these hardly sufficed&quot; to fans who wanted a proper album. The group ultimately signed to Atlantic Records in 1970.

==1970s touring, recordings and early top 40 success==
After spending the better part of 1970 playing live shows around the US opening for artists as eclectic as B. B. King, Johnny Winter, The Allman Brothers, and The Byrds, The J. Geils Band recorded their debut LP &quot;The J. Geils Band&quot; in August 1970 in A&amp;R Studios in New York City and it was released in November. The band started to get airplay with release of their first single, a rock-cover of The Contours&#x27; Motown hit, &quot;First I Look at the Purse&quot;, and soon the band would get more AM radio airplay with a series of several successful singles in the early 1970s, the first one being a cover version of The Valentinos&#x27; &quot;Lookin&#x27; for a Love&quot;, which appeared on their second album &quot;The Morning After&quot; and was their Top 40 debut in 1972 (at No. 39 on the Billboard chart). The album was released in October 1971. In April 1972, Atlantic staff producer Michael Cuscuna enlisted the Geils Band to record two tracks behind Buddy Guy, &quot;This Old Fool&quot; and &quot;Honeydripper&quot;; these songs were included on the album &quot;Buddy Guy &amp; Junior Wells Play the Blues,&quot; issued in August 1972.

Through constant touring, the band soon built a large following in the US for their energetic live shows, with the charismatic stage-antics and &quot;microphone-stand-pole-vaulting&quot; of singer Peter Wolf, as well as its innovative use of the harmonica as a lead instrument. Harmonicalinks.com later called Magic Dick &quot;a pioneer in sound and style for rock harmonica.&quot; AllMusic described their 1970s period as a band &quot;pure and simple, churning out greasy covers of obscure R&amp;B, doo wop, and soul tunes, while cutting them with a healthy dose of Stonesy swagger.&quot; On August 17, 1971, at a show on the Boston Common, The Allman Brothers Band named The J. Geils Band as its favorite local band. Both bands later played the last show at the Fillmore East prior to the venue&#x27;s closing.

The Geils Band&#x27;s third album &quot;Full House&quot;, recorded in April 1972 at the Cinderella Ballroom in Detroit and released that September, showcased their live appeal. Although they hailed from Boston, the band had always considered Detroit its second home because of its enormous popularity there. Part of their second live album (&quot;Blow Your Face Out&quot;, 1976), and all of their third (&quot;Showtime!&quot;, 1982), would also be recorded in Detroit.

After the release of their first two albums and keeping a busy show schedule, it was The J. Geils Band&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Bloodshot&quot; that would be the first commercial breakthrough for the band, reaching No. 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album charts in the United States in 1973 and spawning the single &quot;Give It to Me&quot;, which went to No. 30 in the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts following the album&#x27;s release in 1973. The original U.S. copies of &quot;Bloodshot&quot; were distributed in red vinyl, (instead of the customary black), with matching red 1950s style Atlantic Records labels. The band would continue to use these vintage-style Atlantic labels, in different colors with each album release, throughout their remaining tenure with the label. Seeking to seize on this commercial success, the band released their following album &quot;Ladies Invited&quot; in November of that same year, which debuted at No. 51 but did not match the commercial success of &quot;Bloodshot&quot;. After spending the early part of 1974 on the road with an active touring schedule, the band went back into the studio and recorded their fifth album &quot;Nightmares...and Other Tales from the Vinyl Jungle&quot;, which yielded a big hit single, the Justman/Wolf composition &quot;Must of Got Lost&quot;, which reached No. 12 on the Billboard Top 100 in early 1975. Later that year the band started playing arenas across the US with a variety of artists including the Rolling Stones, Peter Frampton, and Rod Stewart. After their initial commercial success and with constant touring, the group seemed destined to be nothing more than a party band until the release of &quot;Monkey Island&quot; (1977), after which the group left Atlantic Records and signed to EMI America for &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (1978), which charted at No. 49 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and spun off a sizable hit single in &quot;One Last Kiss&quot; (No. 35 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100).

==1980s commercial peak and breakup==
The group hit their commercial peak and achieved mainstream success in the early 1980s, first with the humorous &quot;Love Stinks&quot; which was released in January 1980 and yielded two Top 40 singles, the song &quot;Come Back&quot; which peaked at No. 32 on the Billboard chart, as well as the title track &quot;Love Stinks&quot; which went to No. 38. &quot;Love Stinks&quot; remained a staple in FM radio in the &#x27;80s and was showcased in the 1998 hit film &quot;The Wedding Singer&quot; when Adam Sandler performs it in the film, and it also appeared on the film&#x27;s soundtrack &quot;The Wedding Singer Volume 2&quot;, also released in 1998. The band spent the better part of 1980 touring the US, Europe as well as touring Japan for the first time. The band followed up the success of &quot;Love Stinks&quot; with their hit album &quot;Freeze Frame&quot;, which reached No. 1 in early 1982 for four weeks. The first single &quot;Centerfold&quot; which hit No. 1 for six weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 &quot;Centerfold&quot; also became their first major hit single in the United Kingdom, where it reached No. 3 in February 1982. The title-cut &quot;Freeze Frame&quot; peaked at No. 4 in April 1982. The flip side of &quot;Freeze Frame&quot;, &quot;Flamethrower&quot; received airplay on Urban contemporary radio notably, in Metro Detroit, and reached number 25 on the Billboard soul chart and peaked at 12 on U.S. Billboard Hot Dance Club Play. The song also received airplay on rock and Top 40 stations. The third and final single released from the album &quot;Angel in Blue&quot; peaked at No. 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. The band&#x27;s videos for &quot;Centerfold&quot; and &quot;Freeze Frame&quot; were in heavy rotation on MTV which also contributed to the album&#x27;s success. During 1982, the band was frequently selling out arenas around the US, including a month-long tour with U2 as their support act in March of that year. The band also undertook a two-month tour of Europe playing with the Rolling Stones from June and July of that year as well. The band followed up on the international success of &quot;Freeze Frame&quot; with the release of another live album, &quot;Showtime!&quot;, which contained their No. 24 live hit cover of &quot;I Do&quot;, originally a 1965 hit by The Marvelows, which the band remade for their 1977 &quot;Monkey Island&quot; album.

Wolf left the group in 1983 over disagreements on the group&#x27;s musical direction. Many years later in 2016, Wolf offered the following recollection of the disagreements within the group that led to his departure: &quot;I did not leave the band, but the majority of the band wanted to move in another direction.[...] They wanted to continue in a pop-techno way, [and] it wasn&#x27;t my thing.&quot;

The band went on to record one more album of new material, &quot;You&#x27;re Gettin&#x27; Even While I&#x27;m Gettin&#x27; Odd&quot;. Seth Justman took over lead vocal duties in Wolf&#x27;s absence. The album produced only one single, &quot;Concealed Weapons&quot;, and was not a commercial success. The group then disbanded in 1985 after contributing the title song to the horror film &quot;Fright Night&quot;.

==Reunion appearances, Geils&#x27; departure, and final dissolution==
The group reunited with Wolf in 1999 for a 13-date tour of the East Coast and upper Midwest. Rollins Band drummer Sim Cain sat in on drums for this tour, which also saw the band supported by backup singers Andricka Hall and Catherine Russell, as well as the Uptown Horns (who had also appeared with the group on its &quot;Freeze Frame&quot; Tour). After the &#x27;99 reunion tour finished at that year&#x27;s end, Wolf returned to touring with his own backup band.

On February 26, 2005, the band (with drummer Marty Richards) reunited at the Charles Hotel in Cambridge, Massachusetts, for a charity show for the Cam Neely Foundation for cancer care. On May 22, 2006, all six original members had a surprise reunion at bassist Danny Klein&#x27;s 60th birthday party at Scullers Jazz Club in Boston.

On February 19, 2009, the band reunited again to perform the opening concert at the new House of Blues in Boston on Lansdowne Street (formerly the location of Avalon, Axis, The Embassy and The Modern), with Marty Richards on drums and Mitch Chakour supplying backup vocals. Subsequently, they played two shows on April 24 and 25 at Detroit&#x27;s Fillmore Theater (formerly State Theater). They also did a second show on Lansdowne Street on April 28.

On July 11, 2009, The J. Geils Band played at the Borgata Hotel/Casino in Atlantic City, NJ, selling out the Borgata&#x27;s 2,000-seat event center. On December 31, 2009, the band reunited for a one-night live gig at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, CT.

The band played a benefit in Boston for Big Brothers/Big Sisters on January 23, 2010. On August 14, 2010, The J. Geils Band reunited once again to open for Aerosmith at a sold-out show at Fenway Park. For their 2010 dates, the band was again supported by the Uptown Horns along with backup singers Mitch Chakour, Andricka Hall and Nichelle Tillman. Hall and Tillman toured with the band for their 2012 tour, as did the Uptown Horns, while Hall, Mitch Chakour, and Ada Dyer were the backup singers on the 2011 tour. Since this time, Wolf and Geils had also both been touring as solo artists. Danny Klein formed a new band called Danny Klein&#x27;s Full House that was dedicated to playing the music of The J. Geils Band.

The J. Geils Band embarked on a short U.S. tour in August/September 2012. However, they left for the tour without J. Geils, replaced by touring guitarists Duke Levine and Kevin Barry, along with touring drummer Tom Arey. A furious Geils filed a lawsuit against the other group members over using the band&#x27;s name for a tour without him. He named band members Richard Salwitz, Danny Klein, Peter Wolf and Seth Justman in the lawsuit filed in Boston Superior Court, claiming that they &quot;planned and conspired&quot; to continue touring without him and were unlawfully using the group&#x27;s trademarked name. Geils&#x27; lawsuit was unsuccessful. Angry at his bandmates for what they did, he permanently left the band, although he admitted in an interview several years later he did not bear his bandmates any ill will, saying, &quot;I wish them well. There is no bitterness on my part...&quot; Geils died in 2017.

Despite losing their eponymous leader, the J. Geils Band remained active. On May 30, 2013, they performed six songs as part of the Boston Strong concert at the TD Garden in Boston. The concert, a benefit for victims of the recent Boston Marathon bombing victims, also featured Aerosmith, James Taylor, Boston, Dropkick Murphys, New Kids on the Block, Bell Biv DeVoe, Boyz II Men, Jimmy Buffett, Carole King, Extreme and Jason Aldean.

In 2013 the band was the opening act for Bon Jovi in multiple locations across the United States. Beginning in the fall of 2014 and through the beginning of 2015, The J. Geils Band was the opening act for Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band on most tour dates across North America, along with a few solo shows. Their final tour was in the summer of 2015 with their final show being played in Detroit, MI.

The band was nominated for induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in the years 2005, 2006, 2011, 2017, and 2018. They were not voted in on any of those attempts.

==Projects outside of the band==
Since the breakup of the band in 1985, J. Geils began restoring sports cars in Massachusetts and started the performance shop KTR European Motorsports in Ayer, Massachusetts. In 1992, he joined his old bandmate Richard &quot;Magic Dick&quot; Salwitz to form the band Bluestime, which released two records: the self-titled &quot;Bluestime&quot; (1994) and &quot;Little Car Blues&quot; (1996) on Rounder Records. In 2004, Geils produced the album &quot;Nail It!&quot; for Massachusetts-based blues/rock group The Installers (Francesca Records No. 1011). He also occasionally performed live with the group. The December 2009 edition of &quot;Vintage Guitar&quot; featured an in-depth interview with Geils by Mambo Sons guitarist Tom Guerra. In the interview, Geils revealed his playing approach, jazz influences and choice of instruments. Geils released several jazz albums with Gerry Beaudoin.

Magic Dick contributed his harmonica playing and some vocals as part of a live recording called &quot;Command Performance&quot; by the Legendary Rhythm &amp; Blues Revue featuring The Tommy Castro Band, Deanna Bogart, Ronnie Baker Brooks and others. Since 2007, he has toured as part of the Legendary Rhythm &amp; Blues Revue on different Blues Cruises and again on land-based shows.
Magic Dick is still active and touring as an acoustic duo with Shun Ng. The duo released an EP &quot;About Time&quot;.

Peter Wolf followed his time in the band with a moderately successful solo career, having six solo singles chart on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the 1980s and early 1990s. He continued to release albums into the 2010s, with his most recent release &quot;A Cure for Loneliness&quot; being released in 2016. He toured with Kid Rock during the first half of 2008 and continues to tour heavily with his solo band, the Midnight Travelers.

<text>Operation Phantom Linebacker was a military operation in Iraq carried out jointly by Coalition forces and the Iraqi military to reinforce the Iraq–Syria border. The operation was put in place at the request of the Iraqi government, which claimed that large numbers of foreign militants and weapons were entering the country through the border, although this was disputed by the U.S. military, which maintained that Iraq&#x27;s insurgency was largely homegrown. Under the operation, several thousand U.S. troops were sent to the border to assist in border patrols and train members of the Iraqi border police.

Until 2003, the border had been patrolled by paramilitary units and local towns. The U.S.-led invasion of Iraq caused this system to collapse. As a result, supporters of the deposed government of Saddam Hussein were feared to be streaming across the border. Some of the militants used poorly patrolled border crossings in the desert, while others crossed at staffed checkpoints using fake passports. U.S. military officials noted Iraqi soldiers&#x27; susceptibility to bribes was a major issue in the porous nature of the border.

Although Iraqi officials had expressed fears that large numbers of foreign fighters were entering Iraq from Syria, around two months into the operation the U.S. military stated that the operation had apprehended only small numbers of such militants. Most of the people crossing the border were smugglers and Syrians who had ties to tribes living on the Iraqi side of the border, although a significant number of Iraqi militants linked to the former ruling Ba&#x27;ath Party, who had fled Iraq after the U.S.-led invasion, were also apprehended.

<text>Ben Walter Hooper (October 13, 1870April 18, 1957), was an American politician who served two terms as the 31st governor of Tennessee from 1911 to 1915. Elected as a Fusionist candidate, he was one of just three Republicans to hold the office from the end of Reconstruction to the last quarter of the 20th century. His success was due to divisions in the state Democratic Party over prohibition; he received support from some of the party. During his two terms, Hooper signed several prohibition laws, enacted a measure requiring mandatory school attendance, and signed a law requiring direct pay for women workers.

Hooper served as a member of the U.S. Railroad Labor Board (RLB) during the administration of President Warren G. Harding in the early 1920s. As chairman of the RLB, he was a central figure in the 1922 Railroad Shopmen&#x27;s Strike. He later worked as chief land purchasing agent for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.

==Early life==
Hooper was born out of wedlock to Sarah Wade in Newport, Tennessee. His father, Lemuel Washington Hooper, was a physician who was engaged to another woman at the time. Ben and his mother moved to Mossy Creek (modern Jefferson City) and afterwards to Knoxville, where he was placed in the St. John&#x27;s Orphanage. He was eventually legally adopted by his father, and returned to Newport.

Due to the social stigma surrounding his birth, Hooper struggled as a child in Newport. He later wrote that this made him more determined to succeed. He graduated in 1890 from Carson-Newman College in Jefferson City. He studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1894. Hooper served two terms in the Tennessee House of Representatives, from 1893 to 1897.

During the Spanish–American War, Hooper served as captain of Company C in the 6th U.S. Volunteer Infantry, which was commanded by fellow East Tennessean, Colonel Lawrence Tyson. The unit was stationed in the Arecibo area of northern Puerto Rico for most of the war, and saw little action.

From 1906 to 1910, Hooper was assistant U.S. attorney for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Tennessee.

==Governor==
By 1910, a serious rift had developed in Tennessee&#x27;s Democratic Party over the issue of prohibition. One faction, led by Edward W. Carmack, wanted to extend the state&#x27;s Four Mile Law (which banned the sale of liquor within four miles of any school) throughout the state, while the other faction, led by Governor Malcolm R. Patterson, wanted major cities to remain exempt. This rift was exacerbated when a Patterson associate killed Carmack in 1908, and Patterson pardoned the killer in 1910. When Patterson tried to control the party&#x27;s primary process during the 1910 elections, numerous Democrats abandoned the party to run as independents, and thus became known as the &quot;Independent Democrats.&quot;

Tennessee&#x27;s Republican Party was also suffering from internal divisions in 1910, as party bosses Walter P. Brownlow and Newell Sanders were embroiled in a power struggle. The Brownlow faction supported Alfred A. Taylor, brother of former Democratic governor Robert Love Taylor, as the party&#x27;s nominee, while the Sanders faction supported Hooper. The Sanders faction and the Independent Democrats formed an alliance— later known as the &quot;Fusionists&quot;—and agreed to support each other&#x27;s candidates. With this support, Hooper was able to win the Republican nomination, while Patterson&#x27;s allies were defeated in judicial elections that August.

Realizing he had little chance of winning, Patterson withdrew from the race a few weeks before the general election. Democrats quickly nominated Robert Love Taylor in hopes of salvaging party unity. The move proved unsuccessful, however, and Hooper defeated Taylor 133,074 votes to 121,694 to become governor.

The 1911 legislative session was tumultuous, as Fusionists controlled the state house, while the remaining Democrats, known as &quot;Regular Democrats,&quot; controlled the state senate. Though both chambers struggled with discord and quorum-busting, Hooper obtained passage of laws limiting child labor and requiring that the wages of women be paid directly to them, rather than to any other persons (employers previously had the option of giving women&#x27;s pay to their husbands). Hooper also enacted a state pure food and drug law, and authorized counties to issue bonds to establish hospitals and to purchase school property.

In the 1912 governor&#x27;s race, state Republicans were divided between supporters of William Howard Taft and Theodore Roosevelt, with the latter&#x27;s supporters, led by John Chiles Houk, breaking from the party and nominating William Poston for governor on a Progressive ticket. State Democrats also remained divided, with Regular Democrats nominating former governor Benton McMillin, and Independent Democrats supporting Hooper and the Fusion ticket. On election day, Hooper won with 124,641 votes to 116,610 for McMillin, and 4,483 for Poston.

During Hooper&#x27;s second term, he signed measures that required mandatory school attendance for children between the ages of eight and fourteen, and ordered county school boards to provide for the transportation of pupils. Hooper also established inspections for state banks, implemented a parole system for state convicts, and changed the state&#x27;s method of execution from hanging to electrocution. Pensions were authorized for veterans and widows of the American Civil War. He also signed the so-called &quot;Jug Bill,&quot; which banned the intrastate shipment of liquor, and the &quot;Nuisance Bill,&quot; which allowed as few as ten citizens to petition for the removal of saloons and gambling houses from a locality.

In the 1914 election season, Regular Democrats accepted statewide prohibition as part of the party&#x27;s platform, ending the party&#x27;s internal divisions. Lacking the support of the Independent Democrats, Hooper was defeated by Democratic candidate Thomas C. Rye, 137,656 votes to 116,667.

==Later life==

After his gubernatorial tenure ended, Hooper returned to his law practice in Newport, but remained active in Republican politics. He ran for the U.S. Senate in 1916, but was defeated by Democratic politician Kenneth D. McKellar.

In 1921, President Warren G. Harding appointed Hooper to the U.S. Railroad Labor Board (RLB). As chairman of the RLB, Hooper was a central figure in the Railroad Shopmen&#x27;s Strike which erupted in the summer of 1922 over wage cuts for maintenance workers approved by the RLB.

In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Hooper was the chief land purchasing agent for what would become the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, which was being developed on the Tennessee and North Carolina border.

In 1934, at the age of sixty-four, Hooper once again ran for one of Tennessee&#x27;s U.S. Senate seats. He won the Republican nomination, but was defeated in the general election by his 1916 opponent, Senator Kenneth McKellar.

Hooper died on April 18, 1957. He is interred at Union Cemetery in Newport, Tennessee.

==Family and legacy==

Hooper married Anna Belle Jones in 1901. They had six children: Anna, Ben, James, Margaret, Lemuel and Newell. Hooper&#x27;s grandson, Ben W. Hooper, II, is a former circuit court judge in Cocke County.

Hooper&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;The Unwanted Boy&quot;, was published posthumously in 1963. In 1946, his book, &quot;Elections in Tennessee&quot;, was published.

Hooper&#x27;s home, Elm Hill (built in 1885 by Hooper&#x27;s wife&#x27;s parents), still stands in Newport, and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Ben W. Hooper Vocational School, which opened in Newport in 1976, is named in his honor. The school is now part of Cocke County High School.

In the early 2000s, Hooper was the subject of a story entitled &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Daddy?&quot;, which circulated via email. The story, though considerably embellished, was based on incidents Hooper recalled in his autobiography.

<doc id="909507" wikidata="Q4364406" url="?curid=909507" title="Dividend reinvestment plan">
<text>A dividend reinvestment program or dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) is an equity investment option offered directly from the underlying company. The investor does not receive dividends directly as cash; instead, the investor&#x27;s dividends are directly reinvested in the underlying equity. The investor must still pay tax annually on his or her dividend income, whether it is received as cash or reinvested.

DRIPs allow the investment return from dividends to be immediately invested for the purpose of price appreciation and compounding, without incurring brokerage fees or waiting to accumulate enough cash for a full share of stock. Some DRIPs are free of charge for participants, while others do charge fees and/or proportional commissions.

Similarly income trusts and closed-end funds, which are numerous in Canada, can offer a distribution reinvestment plan and a unit purchase plan which operate principally the same as other plans.

Because DRIPs, by their nature, encourage long-term investment rather than active trading, they tend to have a stabilizing influence on stock prices.

==Cash purchase==

Although the name implies that reinvesting dividends is the main purpose of these plans, many companies offer a complementary share purchase plan (SPP). An SPP allows the enrollee to make periodic optional cash purchases (OCP) of company stock. The dollar amount of the OCP is sometimes subject to minimum and maximum limits, e.g. a minimum of $25 per OCP or a maximum that cannot exceed $100,000 per year. Low-fee or no-fee SPPs may be advantageous to enrollees as they offer a quick and cost-effective way to increase their holdings. And just like when dividends are reinvested, optional cash purchases are for fractional shares to 3 or 4 decimal places.

DRIPs have become popular means of investment for a wide variety of investors as they enable them to effectively take advantage of dollar-cost averaging with income in the form of corporate dividends that the company is paying out. This way, the investor is guaranteed the return of whatever the dividend yield is, but he or she is also subject to market risk due to the price fluctuations of the stock.

==Acquiring stock==

The majority of plans require the potential investor to become a registered shareholder, as opposed to a beneficial shareholder. Registered shareholders are direct owners of company stock and are listed with a company&#x27;s transfer agent, whereas beneficial shareholders hold their stock through a proxy, such as a brokerage account or an investment dealer. In the past, this meant having to keep stock certificates as proof of ownership, but now most plans are in paperless, &quot;book-entry&quot; format. In Canada, you must start a DRIP with a certificate and, as such, Canadian enrollees must have the share certificates to do so. All subsequent shares acquired through the DRIP or SPP would be in &quot;book-entry&quot; format.

In addition, certain DRIPs offer (with SEC approval in the US) a direct enrollment option, in which the initial share purchase may itself be made through the DRIP, thereby avoiding retail brokerage fees and commissions. This option is often called a &quot;direct share purchase plan&quot; or &quot;direct stock purchase plan&quot; (DSPP). DRIP expert Charles Carlson has dubbed such plans &quot;no-load stocks&quot;. However, describing such plans as &quot;no-load stock&quot; plans is extremely misleading. In the mid-1990s, when investing through company-sponsored plans became more popular, such &quot;no-load&quot; plans were created and promoted by certain transfer agents in order to create fees each time an investment is made through the plan (and, in many cases, for each dividend reinvestment). Traditional DRIPs, those available only to those who are already shareholders, are more likely to be &quot;no-fee&quot; plans. There are many no-fee versions of DRIPs, SPPs and DSPPs which are an efficient way to build holdings over time by making small regular investments on a dollar-cost averaging basis.

In some DRIPs, the investor has the option of receiving some or all dividends by check, as opposed to full reinvestment. Also, if a DRIP is discontinued, the investor&#x27;s shares typically continue to be held in book-entry form, either including fractional shares or with a refund check issued for the fractional part of the position.

A downside of using DRIPs is that the investor must keep track of cost basis for many small purchases of stock, and maintain records of these purchases in paper or electronic form. This assures that the investor can accurately calculate the capital gains tax when any shares are sold, and document cost basis to their government if requested. This record keeping can become burdensome (or costly, if done by an accountant) if the investor participates in more than one DRIP for many years. For example, participating in 15 DRIPs for ten years, with all of the stocks paying quarterly dividends, would result in at least 615 share lots to keep track of—the 15 initial purchases, plus 600 reinvested dividends. Further complications arise if the investor periodically buys or sells shares, or if the company is involved in an event requiring adjustments to cost basis, such as a spin-off or a merger.

While the term &quot;DRIP&quot; is usually associated with company-sponsored plans, reinvestment of stock dividends is also available at no cost through some brokerage firms. This is called a synthetic DRIP. The drawback to broker DRIPs is that they do not allow for optional cash purchases. If the investor wants to acquire additional shares, he or she must pay a commission for each subsequent purchase.

==History==

The name &quot;Nasuno&quot; was first introduced on 22 September 1959 for services operating between in Tokyo and on the Tōhoku Main Line. In 1966, this was upgraded to become an , and on 14 March 1985, it was upgraded to become a Limited express using 185 series EMU rolling stock. From 10 March 1990, the train was rerouted to operate between in Tokyo and Kuroiso.

On 10 December 1995, the name was adopted for the new all-stations services on the Tōhoku Shinkansen. The Tōhoku Main Line services to and from Shinjuku were renamed &quot;Ohayō Tochigi&quot; and &quot;Hometown Tochigi&quot; from this date. Prior to 1995, &quot;Aoba&quot; services formed the all-stations services along the whole line. However, with the introduction of short-distance &quot;Nasuno&quot; services, &quot;Aoba&quot; services were reduced, and in 1997, discontinued altogether, with the local services covered by &quot;Nasuno&quot; as far as Kōriyama, and all further stations served by the &quot;Yamabiko&quot;.

<text>Royal Air Force High Wycombe or more simply RAF High Wycombe is a Royal Air Force station, situated in the village of Walters Ash, near High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire, England. It houses Headquarters Air Command, and was originally designed to house RAF Bomber Command in the late 1930s. The station is also the headquarters of the European Air Group and the United Kingdom Space Command.

The location of the station was originally suggested by Wing Commander Alan Oakeshott when the Air Ministry was seeking a new, secure, site for Bomber Command away from London. Wing Commander Oakeshott was killed in combat in 1942 and is commemorated on the Naphill War Memorial and in the name of the station&#x27;s welfare centre, opened in 2011.

The motto of RAF High Wycombe in Latin is &#x27;Non Sibi&#x27;, which translates as &#x27;not for ourselves&#x27;.

==History==

===Construction===
Prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, the Air Ministry sought a safe location for RAF Bomber Command away from London. The wooded area near Naphill, Walters Ash and Lacey Green was suggested by Wing Commander Alan Oakeshott as ideal for this purpose, since the trees could provide natural camouflage from the air.

Buildings were designed to resemble other uses, such as the Officers&#x27; Mess which was built to look like a manor house. The fire station was built with a tower to resemble a village church. Trees were preserved as much as possible to maintain the camouflage they provided. Roads were laid out so as to avoid most trees. The building work was carried out by John Laing and Son, with 400 workmen and 80 specialists involved. Tunnels were dug to connect each block on the station, linked to an Operations Block built below ground.

To preserve secrecy, the station was known as &quot;Southdown&quot; in March 1940, as part of a directive by the Air Ministry. The site&#x27;s postal address was given as &quot;GPO High Wycombe.&quot;

Whilst High Wycombe was not an official flying station, a small airfield was used in the nearby village of Lacey Green, to the north. The airfield was unpaved and was used for small flights into and out of RAF High Wycombe and was only used between June 1944 and late 1945.

High Wycombe was also used by the 325th Photographic Wing, United States Army Air Forces, from 9 August 1944 until 20 October 1945.

===Post-War===
Headquarters, 7th Air Division of the Strategic Air Command, supporting SAC operations in UK relocated to High Wycombe from RAF South Ruislip in 1958, and commanded all SAC operations from there until 1965.

The station badge, incorporating a thunderbolt and two pillars to symbolise the support the station gave to Bomber Command, was approved on 23 November 1966. RAF Bomber Command merged with RAF Fighter Command to form RAF Strike Command at RAF High Wycombe on 30 April 1968. The station&#x27;s title, Royal Air Force Station High Wycombe, was officially approved on 1 January 1969. From 1983 to 1984 there was a peace camp protesting against the building of a bunker there at that time to house RAF Strike Command.

On 1 July 1994, Headquarters Allied Forces North Western Europe (AFNORTHWEST) of NATO was established at High Wycombe.

RAF Strike Command merged with RAF Personnel and Training Command to form RAF Air Command at RAF High Wycombe on 1 April 2007. Since 2009, the station has been responsible for reviewing UFO sightings as part of efforts to identify any possible unauthorised military incursions into UK airspace. Civil servants tasked with reviewing such sightings relocated to the station from the Ministry of Defence Main Building in London.

The Ministry of Defence and Serco agreed a ten-year contract in February 2010 whereby Serco would provide support services at RAF High Wycombe and RAF Halton, including leisure services, general engineering and catering.

The actor David Jason officially opened the station&#x27;s new welfare centre, named after Wing Commander Alan Oakeshott, in July 2011. An Armed Forces Community Covenant between the station and Wycombe District Council was signed on 16 April 2012, designed to strengthen the links between the military and the local community. Personnel exercised the station&#x27;s Freedom of Wycombe District on 29 May 2012, parading through Princes Risborough.

<doc id="909512" wikidata="Q1564223" url="?curid=909512" title="Historical background of the New Testament">
<text>Most scholars who study the historical Jesus and early Christianity believe that the canonical gospels and the life of Jesus must be viewed within their historical and cultural context, rather than purely in terms of Christian orthodoxy. They look at Second Temple Judaism, the tensions, trends, and changes in the region under the influence of Hellenism and the Roman occupation, and the Jewish factions of the time, seeing Jesus as a Jew in this environment; and the written New Testament as arising from a period of oral gospel traditions after his death.

In 64 BCE, the already partially Hellenized Hasmonean Kingdom of Judea was incorporated into the Roman Republic as a client kingdom when Pompey the Great conquered Jerusalem. The Romans treated Judea as a valued crossroads to trading territories, and as a buffer state against the Parthian Empire. Direct rule was imposed in 6 CE, with the formation of the province of Judea. Roman prefects were appointed to maintain order through a political appointee, the High Priest. After the uprising by Judas the Galilean and before Pontius Pilate (26 CE), in general, Roman Judea was troubled but self-managed. Occasional riots, sporadic rebellions, and violent resistance were an ongoing risk.

Throughout the third quarter of the first century, the conflict between the Jews and the Romans gave rise to increasing tensions. Before the end of the third quarter of the first century, these tensions culminated with the first Jewish-Roman War and the destruction of the Second Temple in Jerusalem. This war effectively flattened Jerusalem, and the city was later rebuilt as the Roman colony of Aelia Capitolina, in which Jews were forbidden to live.

== Factions, groups and cults in the Roman period ==
According to the Jewish-Roman historian Flavius Josephus, the three parties in contemporary Judaism were the Pharisees, the Sadducees and the Essenes, the last of these three being apparently marginalized and in some cases retired to quasi-monastic communities. Josephus also speaks of a &quot;Fourth Movement&quot;, &quot;Zealots&quot;, &quot;Lestai&quot; or &quot;Sicarii&quot;.
The Pharisees were a powerful force in 1st-century Judea. Early Christians shared several beliefs of the Pharisees, such as resurrection, retribution in the next world, angels, human freedom, and divine providence. After the fall of the Second Temple, the Pharisaic outlook was established in Rabbinic Judaism. Some scholars speculate that Jesus was himself a Pharisee. In Jesus&#x27; day, the two main schools of thought among the Pharisees were the House of Hillel, which had been founded by the Tanna, Hillel the Elder, and the House of Shammai. Historians do not know whether there were Pharisees in Galilee during Jesus&#x27; life, or what they would have been like.

The Sadducees were particularly powerful in Jerusalem. They accepted the written Law only, rejecting the traditional interpretations accepted by the Pharisees, such as belief in retribution in an afterlife, resurrection of the body, angels, and spirits. After the fall of Jerusalem, they disappeared from history.

The Essenes were apocalyptic ascetics, one of the three (or four) major Jewish schools of the time, although they were not mentioned in the New Testament. Some scholars theorize that Jesus was an Essene, or close to them. Among these scholars is Pope Benedict XVI, who supposes in his book on Jesus that &quot;it appears that not only John the Baptist, but possibly Jesus and his family as well, were close to the Qumran community.&quot;

The Zealots were a revolutionary party opposed to Roman rule, one of those parties that, according to Josephus inspired the fanatical stand in Jerusalem that led to its destruction in the year 70 CE. Luke identifies Simon, a disciple, as a &quot;zealot&quot;, which might mean a member of the Zealot party or a zealous person. The notion that Jesus himself was a Zealot does not do justice to the earliest Synoptic material describing him. Alternatively, according to Dale Martin of Yale and supported by Bart Ehrman, as well as an essay by James Still, Jesus has been cast in a Zealot/violent apocalyptic light.

=== Sadducees and Pharisees in the Roman period ===

During this period serious theological differences emerged between the Sadducees and Pharisees. Whereas Sadducees favored a limited interpretation of the Torah, Pharisees debated new applications of the law and devised ways for all Jews to incorporate purity practices (hitherto limited to the Jerusalem Temple, see also Ministry of Jesus#Ritual cleanliness) in their everyday lives. Unlike the Sadducees, the Pharisees also believed in (and introduced) the concept of the Resurrection of the Dead in a future, Messianic Age or World to Come.

=== New prophets ===
During this time a number of individuals claimed to be prophets, in the tradition of Elijah and Elisha. The Talmud provides two examples of such Jewish miracle workers around the time of Jesus. Mishnah Ta&#x27;anit 3:8 tells of &quot;Honi the Circledrawer&quot; who, in the middle of the 1st century BCE, was famous for his ability to successfully pray for rain. On one occasion when God did not answer his prayer, he drew a circle in the dust, stood inside it, and informed God that he would not move until it rained. When it began to drizzle, Honi told God that he was not satisfied and expected more rain; it then began to pour. He explained that he wanted a calm rain, at which point the rain calmed to a normal rain.

Mishnah Berakot 5:5 tells of Hanina ben Dosa, who in the generation following Jesus cured Gamaliel&#x27;s son by prayer (compare with Matthew 8: 5–13). A later story (In the Babylonian Talmud, Berakot 33a) tells of a lizard that used to injure passers-by. Hanina ben Dosa came and put his heel over the hole; the lizard bit him and died.

Such men were respected for their relationship with God but not considered especially saintly; their abilities were seen as one more unknowable thing and not deemed a result of any ultra-strict observance of Jewish law. These men were sometimes doubted, often respected, and even (according to Géza Vermes) addressed by their followers as &quot;lord&quot; — but never considered &quot;saviors&quot; or &quot;messiahs.&quot;

=== Messiahs and millennial prophets ===

The literal translation of the Hebrew word &quot;mashiach&quot; (messiah) is &quot;anointed&quot;, which refers to a ritual of consecrating someone or something by putting holy anointing oil upon it. It is used throughout the Hebrew Bible in reference to a wide variety of individuals and objects; for example, a Jewish king, Jewish priests and prophets, the Jewish Temple and its utensils, unleavened bread, and a non-Jewish king (Cyrus the Great).

In Jewish eschatology the term came to refer to a future king from the Davidic line who will be &quot;anointed&quot; to be king of God&#x27;s kingdom and rule the Jewish people during the Messianic Age. He is considered to be a great military and political leader descended from King David, well versed with the laws that are followed in Judaism.

After the fall of the Hasmoneans and the subsequent Roman occupation, it is plausible that Jews believed it to be the end of days and hoped that the Romans would somehow fall or be replaced by a Jewish king. Most Jews believed that their history was governed by God, meaning that even the conquest of Judea by the Romans was a divine act. They believed that the Romans would be replaced by a Jewish king only through divine intervention.

In 36 CE a Samaritan led a large group up Mount Gerizim, where they believed Moses had buried sacred vessels. Pilate blocked their route and killed their leaders. Josephus, who elsewhere expressed the common Judean prejudice against Samaritans, suggested that they were armed. But the surviving Samaritans appealed to the Syrian Legate, Vitellius, that they were unarmed and that Pilate&#x27;s actions were excessively cruel. According to historian H.H. Ben-Sasson, Samaria, as part of Roman Judea, was in a sense a &quot;satellite of Syria&quot;. As a result, Pilate was sent to Rome and ultimately dismissed from his post as prefect. Another such prophet was Theudas, who, sometime between 44 and 46 led a large group of people to the Jordan river, which he claimed he could part. Cuspius Fadus, a procurator after Pilate, blocked their route and killed Theudas.

An &quot;Egyptian&quot; prophet&quot; led thirty thousand around the Mount of Olives and sought to enter Jerusalem until stopped by Antonius Felix, a procurator after Fadus.

=== Zealots, Sicarii and bandits ===

When Herod was still military governor in the Galilee, he spent a good deal of time fighting bandits under the leadership of Ezekias. These bandits are best understood as a peasant group whose targets were local elites (both Hasmonean and Herodian) rather than Rome. Ventidius Cumanus (procurator 48 to 52 CE) often retaliated against brigandry by punishing peasant communities he believed to be their base of support. When a Galillean pilgrim on the way to Jerusalem was murdered by a Samaritan, the bandit chief Eliezar organized Galilleans for a counter-attack, and Cumanus moved against the Jews. A Syrian legate, Quadratus, intervened and sent several Jewish and Samaritan officials to Rome. The Emperor Claudius took the Jewish side, and had the Samaritan leaders executed and exiled, and turned one named Veler over to the Jews who beheaded him. Thus, widespread peasant unrest of this period was not exclusively directed against Rome but also expressed discontent against urban elites and other groups; Roman policy sought to contain the power of the bandits while cultivating Jewish support.

During the First Jewish-Roman War in 66, Josephus was sent to command the Galilee. He raised an army primarily of local bandits who pillaged nearby Greek and Roman cities (including ones occupied by Jewish elites), including the administrative centers of Sepphoris, Tiberias, and Gabara (sometimes Gadara). This suggests that they were concerned primarily with gain or social insurrection against local elites, rather than a political revolution against Roman occupation. When Roman legions arrived from Syria, the bandit army melted away.

The Romans employed a scorched earth policy in its fight in the north, driving thousands of peasants southwards towards Jerusalem. Between 67 and 68, these peasants, perhaps led by bandits, formed a new political party called the Zealots, which believed that an independent kingdom should be restored immediately through force of arms. It is unclear whether their leaders made messianic claims. The Zealots imprisoned members of the Herodian family, killed the former high priests Ananus ben Ananus and Joshua ben Gamla, and put on trial the wealthiest citizens. It is possible that they believed they were purging elements whom they believed would have surrendered to the Romans. But these purges also reveal the great social divide between Jewish peasants and aristocrats at this time. They formed part of a social revolution: although they ultimately lost to the Romans, elite groups like the Hasmoneans, Herodians, and Sadducees would never again have power in Roman Judea.

== Analysis of the gospels ==
Most historians view the gospels not as an objective account of Jesus, but as the product of men writing at a particular period, and grappling with particular theological as well as political issues. Specifically, they assume that, after Jesus&#x27;s death, his sayings and stories about him circulated among his followers until, at some point in the mid-1st century, someone (or a group of people) wrote his sayings down in Greek (see Q source) and someone edited and organized stories about his life into a historical narrative: the Gospel of Mark. As these two documents circulated among Christians, other historical narratives were edited and organized. The four gospels ascribed to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were regionally authoritative by proto-orthodoxy by the 2nd century. Some historians have suggested that, between Nero&#x27;s persecution of Christians in 64 CE and the Jewish revolt in 66 CE, Gentile Christians saw more sense in giving Jews, rather than Romans, responsibility for Jesus&#x27; death.

Moreover, just as Rabbinic Judaism was in part the Pharisaic response to their acknowledgment that the Temple would not be rebuilt in their lifetimes, Christianity reflected the acknowledgment of early Christians that the Second Coming of Christ and the establishment of God&#x27;s kingdom on earth was not to happen in their lifetimes. The critical analysis of the Gospels involves, at least in part, a consideration of how these concerns affected the Gospels&#x27; accounts of Jesus.

According to historian Paula Fredriksen (1988: 5), critical scholars rely on four basic criteria for extrapolating an &quot;authentic&quot; historical account of Jesus out of the New Testament sources:

# Dissimilarity: &quot;if the earliest form of a saying or story differs in emphasis from a characteristic teaching or concern both of contemporary Judaism and of the early church, then it &quot;may&quot; be authentic.&quot;
# Coherence: &quot;if material from the earlier strata of tradition is consonant with other material already established as probably authentic, then it too is probably authentic.&quot;
# Multiple attestation: &quot;if material appears in a number of different sources and literary contexts, then it may be authentic.&quot;
# Linguistic suitability: &quot;material with a claim to authenticity should be susceptible of Aramaic rendering, since Jesus did not teach in Greek, the language of the documents.&quot;

As Fredriksen observes, these criteria do not guarantee an accurate historical reconstruction. Nevertheless, she argues,

: If something stands in the gospels that is clearly &quot;not&quot; in the interests of the late 1st-century church — disparaging remarks about Gentiles, for example, or explicit pronouncements about the imminent end of the world — then it has a stronger claim to authenticity than otherwise. Stated briefly, anything embarrassing is probably earlier. (1988: 6).

Even these criteria are not sufficient to recover &quot;what really happened.&quot; They can, however, enable historians to suggest &quot;with reasonable security what &quot;possibly&quot; happened, what &quot;probably&quot; happened, and what &quot;could not possibly&quot; have happened.

According to Fredriksen, two events in the Gospels probably happened: John&#x27;s baptism and Pilate&#x27;s crucifixion of Jesus. These events are mentioned in all four gospels. Moreover, they do not conform to Jewish tradition in which there are no baptized and crucified messiahs. They are also embarrassing to the early Church. John the Baptist&#x27;s prominence in both the gospels and Josephus suggests that he may have been more popular than Jesus in his lifetime; also, Jesus&#x27; mission does not begin until after his baptism by John. Fredriksen suggests that it was only after Jesus&#x27; death that Jesus emerged as more influential than John. Accordingly, the gospels project Jesus&#x27; posthumous importance back to his lifetime. Ways this was accomplished were by minimizing John&#x27;s importance by having John resist baptizing Jesus (Matthew), by referring to the baptism in passing (Luke), or by asserting Jesus&#x27; superiority (John).

Given the historical context in which the Gospels took their final form and during which Christianity first emerged, historians have struggled to understand Jesus&#x27; ministry in terms of what is known about 1st century Judaism. According to scholars such as Geza Vermes and E.P. Sanders, Jesus seems not to have belonged to any particular party or movement; Jesus was eclectic (and perhaps unique) in combining elements of many of these different—and for most Jews, opposing—positions. Most critical scholars see Jesus as healing people and performing miracles in the prophetic tradition of the Galilee, and preaching God&#x27;s desire for justice and righteousness in the prophetic tradition of Judea. (According to Geza Vermes, that Jesus&#x27; followers addressed him as &quot;lord&quot; indicates that they likened him to notable miracle workers and scribes. See Names and titles of Jesus)

As the Gospel accounts are generally held to have been composed in the period immediately following the revolt of 66–73, it has been suggested that Christians had to refashion their theological and apocalyptic claims given that Jesus did not immediately return to restore the Jewish kingdom. Moreover, as Christianity emerged as a new religion seeking converts among the Gentiles, and eventually as the religion of the emperor himself, it needed to assure both Roman authorities and prospective Gentile audiences that it neither threatened nor challenged imperial sovereignty. Some historians have argued that these two conditions played a crucial role in the revision of accounts of Jesus&#x27; life and teachings into the form they ultimately took in the Gospels.

== The divergence of early Christians and Rabbinic Jews ==

As with many religions, no precise date of founding is agreed by all parties. Christians traditionally believe that Christianity began with Jesus&#x27; ministry, and the appointment of the Twelve Apostles or the Seventy Disciples, see also Great Commission. Most historians agree that Jesus or his followers established a new Jewish sect, one that attracted both Jewish and Gentile converts. Historians continue to debate the precise moment when Christianity established itself as a new religion, apart and distinct from Judaism. Some Christians were still part of the Jewish community up until the time of the Bar Kochba revolt in the 130s, see also Jewish Christians. As late as the 4th century, John Chrysostom strongly discouraged Christians from attending Jewish festivals in Antioch, which suggests at least some ongoing contact between the two groups in that city. Similarly for the Council of Laodicea . See also Shabbat, Sabbath in Christianity, Quartodeciman, Constantine I and Christianity. According to historian Shaye J. D. Cohen,

According to Cohen, this process ended in 70 CE, after the great revolt, when various Jewish sects disappeared and Pharisaic Judaism evolved into Rabbinic Judaism, and Christianity emerged as a distinct religion.
Many historians argue that the Gospels took their final form after the Great Revolt and the destruction of the Temple, although some scholars put the authorship of Mark in the 60s, and need to be understood in this context. They view Christians as much as Pharisees as being competing movements &quot;within&quot; Judaism that decisively broke only after the Bar Kokhba&#x27;s revolt, when the successors of the Pharisees claimed hegemony over all Judaism, and – at least from the Jewish perspective – Christianity emerged as a new religion.

=== The First Jewish–Roman War and the destruction of the Temple ===

By 66 CE, Jewish discontent with Rome had escalated. At first, the priests tried to suppress rebellion, even calling upon the Pharisees for help. After the Roman garrison failed to stop Hellenists from desecrating a synagogue in Caesarea, however, the high priest suspended payment of tribute, inaugurating the First Jewish–Roman War. In 70, the Temple was destroyed. The destruction of the Second Temple was a profoundly traumatic experience for the Jews, who were now confronted with difficult and far-reaching questions:
* How to achieve atonement without the Temple?
* How to explain the disastrous outcome of the rebellion?
* How to live in the post-Temple, Romanized world?
* How to connect present and past traditions?

How people answered these questions depended largely on their position prior to the revolt. But the destruction of the Second Temple by the Romans not only put an end to the revolt, it marked the end of an era. Revolutionaries like the Zealots had been crushed by the Romans, and had little credibility (the last Zealots died at Masada in 73). The Sadducees, whose teachings were so closely connected to the Temple cult, disappeared. The Essenes also vanished, perhaps because their teachings so diverged from the issues of the times that the destruction of the Second Temple was of no consequence to them; precisely for this reason, they were of little consequence to the vast majority of Jews).

Two organized groups remained: the Early Christians, and Pharisees. Some scholars, such as Daniel Boyarin and Paula Fredricksen, suggest that it was at this time, when Christians and Pharisees were competing for leadership of the Jewish people, that accounts of debates between Jesus and the apostles, debates with Pharisees, and anti-Pharisaic passages, were written and incorporated into the New Testament.

===Loss of records===
The siege of Jerusalem in 70 CE included a major fire at the Temple which destroyed the entire compound except the Western Wall; anything of value that remained (including the altar tablet) was taken by Titus to Rome as trophies. The destruction of Jerusalem, and the loss of significant portions of Jewish cultural records were significant, with Flavius Josephus writing (about 5 years later ) in &quot;The Jewish War&quot; (Book VII 1.1) that Jerusalem had been flattened to the point that &quot;there was left nothing to make those that came thither believe it had ever been inhabited.&quot; And once what was left of the ruins of Jerusalem had been turned into the Roman settlement of Aelia Capitolina, no Jews were allowed to set foot in it; and almost no direct records survive about the history of Judaism from the last part of the first century through the second century.

Margaret M. Mitchell writes that although Eusebius reports (Ecclesiastical History III 5.3) that the early Christians left Jerusalem for Pella just before Jerusalem was subjected to the final lockdown in 70, in the face of this total destruction we must accept that no first-hand Christian writings from the early Jerusalem Church have reached us.

=== The emergence of Rabbinic Judaism ===

Following the destruction of the Temple, Rome governed Judea both through a Procurator at Caesarea, which had always been the Roman provincial capital, and through a Jewish Patriarch. A former leading Pharisee, Yohanan ben Zakkai, was appointed the first Patriarch (the Hebrew word, Nasi, also means prince, or president), and he reestablished the Sanhedrin at Javneh under Pharisee control. Instead of giving tithes to the priests and sacrificing offerings at the Temple, the rabbis instructed Jews to give money to charities and study in local synagogues, as well as to pay the &quot;Fiscus Iudaicus&quot;.

In 132, the Emperor Hadrian threatened to rebuild Jerusalem as a pagan city dedicated to Jupiter, called Aelia Capitolina. Some of the leading sages of the Sanhedrin supported a rebellion (and, for a short time, an independent state) led by Simon bar Kochba; some, such as Rabbi Akiva, believed Bar Kochba to be &quot;messiah&quot;, or king. Up until this time, a number of Christians were still part of the Jewish community. However, they did not support or take part in the revolt. Whether because they had no wish to fight, or because they could not support a second messiah in addition to Jesus, or because of their harsh treatment by Bar Kochba during his brief reign, these Christians also left the Jewish community around this time. Traditionally, it is believed the Jerusalem Christians waited out the Jewish–Roman wars in Pella in the Decapolis.

This revolt ended in 135 when Bar Kochba and his army were defeated. According to a midrash, in addition to Bar Kochba the Romans tortured and executed ten leading members of the Sanhedrin (the &quot;Ten Martyrs&quot;). This account also claims this was belated repayment for the guilt of the ten brothers who kidnapped Joseph. It is possible that this account represents a Pharisaic response to the Christian account of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion; in both accounts the Romans brutally punish rebels, who accept their torture as atonement for the crimes of others.

After the suppression of the revolt, the vast majority of Jews were sent into exile; shortly thereafter (), Judah ha-Nasi edited together centuries of priestly judgements and oral traditions into an authoritative code, the Mishnah. This marks the transformation of Pharisaic Judaism into Rabbinic Judaism.

Although the Rabbis traced their origins to the Pharisees, Rabbinic Judaism nevertheless involved a radical repudiation of certain elements of this school of thoughtelements that were basic to Second Temple Judaism. The Pharisees had been partisan. Members of different sects argued with one another over the correctness of their respective interpretations, see also Hillel and Shammai. After the destruction of the Second Temple, these sectarian divisions ended. The term &quot;Pharisee&quot; was no longer used, perhaps because it was a term more often used by non-Pharisees, but also because the term was explicitly sectarian. The Rabbis claimed leadership over all Jews, and added to the Amidah the &quot;birkat haMinim&quot; (see Council of Jamnia), a prayer which in part exclaims, &quot;Praised are You O Lord, who breaks enemies and defeats the arrogant,&quot; and which is understood as a rejection of sectarians and sectarianism. This shift by no means resolved conflicts over the interpretation of the Torah; rather, it relocated debates between sects to debates within Rabbinic Judaism.

=== The emergence of Christianity ===
Paula Fredriksen, in &quot;From Jesus to Christ&quot;, has suggested that Jesus&#x27; impact on his followers was so great that they could not accept this failure. According to the New Testament, some Christians believed that they encountered Jesus after his crucifixion; they argued that he had been resurrected (the belief in the resurrection of the dead in the messianic age was a core Pharisaic doctrine), and would soon return to usher in the Kingdom of God and fulfill the rest of Messianic prophecy such as the Resurrection of the dead and the Last Judgment. Others adapted Gnosticism as a way to maintain the vitality and validity of Jesus&#x27; teachings (see Elaine Pagels, &quot;The Gnostic Gospels&quot;). Since early Christians believed that Jesus had already replaced the Temple as the expression of a new covenant, they were relatively unconcerned with the destruction of the Temple, though it came to be viewed as symbolic of the doctrine of supersessionism.

According to Shaye J.D. Cohen, historians of Hellenistic Judaism see that Jesus&#x27; failure to establish the Kingdom of God and his death at the hands of the Romans invalidated any messianic claims (see for comparison: &quot;prophet&quot; and &quot;false prophet&quot;).

According to many historians, most of Jesus&#x27; teachings were intelligible and acceptable in terms of Second Temple Judaism; what set Christians apart from Jews was their faith in Christ as the resurrected messiah. The belief in a resurrected Messiah is unacceptable to Jews today and to Rabbinic Judaism, and Jewish authorities have long used this fact to explain the break between Judaism and Christianity. Recent work by historians paints a more complex portrait of late Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity. Some historians have suggested that, before his death, Jesus forged among his believers such certainty that the Kingdom of God and the resurrection of the dead was at hand, that with few exceptions (John 20: 24–29) when they saw him shortly after his execution, they had no doubt that he had been resurrected, and that the restoration of the Kingdom and resurrection of the dead was at hand. These specific beliefs were compatible with Second Temple Judaism. In the following years the restoration of the Kingdom as Jews expected it failed to occur. Some Christians believed instead that Christ, rather than being the Jewish messiah, was God made flesh, who died for the sins of humanity, and that faith in Jesus Christ offered everlasting life (see Christology).

The foundation for this new interpretation of Jesus&#x27; crucifixion and resurrection are found in the epistles of Paul and in the Book of Acts. Most Jews view Paul as the founder of Christianity, who is responsible for the break with Judaism. Recently, Talmud scholar Daniel Boyarin has argued that Paul&#x27;s theology of the spirit is more deeply rooted in Hellenistic Judaism than generally believed. In &quot;A Radical Jew,&quot; Boyarin argues that Paul the Apostle combined the life of Jesus with Greek philosophy to reinterpret the Hebrew Bible in terms of the Platonic opposition between the ideal (which is real) and the material (which is false); see also Paul the Apostle and Judaism. Judaism is a corporeal religion, in which membership is based not on belief but rather descent from Abraham, physically marked by circumcision, and focusing on how to live this life properly. Paul saw in the symbol of a resurrected Jesus the possibility of a spiritual rather than corporeal messiah. He used this notion of messiah to argue for a religion through which all people — not just descendants of Abraham — could worship the God of Abraham. Unlike Judaism, which holds that it is the proper religion only of the Jews, Pauline Christianity claimed to be the proper religion for all people.

In other words, by appealing to the Platonic distinction between the material and the ideal, Paul showed how the spirit of Christ could provide &quot;all&quot; people a way to worship God — the God who had previously been worshipped only by Jews, although Jews claimed that he was the one and only God of all. Boyarin roots Paul&#x27;s work in Hellenistic Judaism and insists that Paul was thoroughly Jewish. But, Boyarin argues, Pauline theology made his version of Christianity very appealing to Gentiles. Nevertheless, Boyarin also sees this Platonic reworking of both Jesus&#x27;s teachings and Pharisaic Judaism as essential to the emergence of Christianity as a distinct religion, because it justified a Judaism without Jewish law (see also New Covenant).

The above events and trends led to a gradual separation between Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism. According to historian Shaye J.D. Cohen, &quot;Early Christianity ceased to be a Jewish sect when it ceased to observe Jewish practices.&quot;

Among the Jewish practices abandoned by proto-orthodox Christianity, circumcision was rejected as a requirement at the Council of Jerusalem, , Sabbath observance was modified, perhaps as early as Ignatius&#x27; &quot;Epistle to the Magnesians&quot; 9.1, and Quartodecimanism (observation of the Paschal feast on Nisan 14, the day of preparation for Passover, linked to Polycarp and thus to John the Apostle) was formally rejected at the First Council of Nicaea.

<text>The Prättigau is a geographical region in the canton of Grisons, Switzerland. It consists of the main valley of the river Landquart and the valleys of its side-rivers and creeks. Landquart River, which drains into the Alpine Rhine in the town of the same name, is on its upper end home to the ski resorts of Klosters.

Landquart is a village with a railway junction on the flat floor valley of the Alpine Rhine just north of Chur, the capital of the Grisons.

The Prättigau is a tourist destination for winter and summer activities, including downhill and cross-country skiing, tobogganing and hiking.

Traditionally, towns in the Prättigau were reliant on the lumber industry, although the income from tourism has largely replaced that.

The historical American Van Leer family claims lineage from this area through Swiss archives.

<text>Portuguese football is divided into divisions (&quot;divisões&quot;, singular — &quot;divisão&quot;). The major teams play in the Primeira Liga. The other professional teams play against each other in the LigaPro. The other major competitions are the Portuguese Cup, Portuguese League Cup and Portuguese Super Cup.

==Early years==
Before 1922, the Portuguese teams played only local games with neighbouring clubs and later in the local championships as the Lisbon District Championship (&quot;Campeonato Distrital de Lisboa&quot;) or the Porto District Championship (&quot;Campeonato Distrital do Porto&quot;).

==Championship of Portugal==
The nation was urging for a nationwide competition and the clubs organized the Championship of Portugal for the most important District Associations (Lisbon, Porto, Coimbra, Madeira, Algarve, and Braga). Setúbal Football Association teams also participated instead of Lisbon clubs if they won the Campeonato de Lisboa. In the first championship, only Lisbon, Porto, Madeira, and Algarve were invited and only Lisbon and Porto accepted. Later, all of them participated. This championship was played on a knock-out basis and was very similar to today&#x27;s Portuguese Cup.

First held in 1922, it determined the Portuguese national champion and awarded the winning team with the same trophy that is currently awarded to the Portuguese Cup winners (although the Championship of Portugal titles don&#x27;t count as Portuguese Cup titles and the winners of the Championship of Portugal no longer count as Portuguese football champions).

But after the formation of the first Portuguese Football Union (&quot;União Portuguesa de Futebol&quot;), and later (1926) Portuguese Football Federation (&quot;Federação Portuguesa de Futebol&quot;), the organization dissolved the former competitions and reformed Portuguese football.

==New names, new formats==
The Championship of Portugal was turned into the Portuguese Cup, this time with all clubs in the nation (except for those in the colonies). The Premier League (a round-basis experimental league) was transformed into the National Championship of the First Division (&quot;Campeonato Nacional da Primeira Divisão&quot;), or just First Division (&quot;Primeira Divisão&quot;) with the major clubs.

The also experimental Segunda Divisão was given the name of National Championship of the Second Division, or just Second Division divided into two zones (North and South) and later into three zones (North, Center and South). The Terceira Divisão was also created with several geographical series.

The irregular local championships were assigned to the 22 Portuguese District Football Associations, and, therefore, the District Championships were created.

==End of dictatorship==
With the end of the dictatorship in Portugal with the Carnation Revolution of 1974, the old 1938 format of the competitions needed some changes.

Firstly, the Portuguese League for Professional Football (&quot;Liga Portuguesa de Futebol Profissional&quot;) was created. This organization inside the Portuguese Football Federation (FPF) ruled the only professional league (First Division). The other competitions continued with the FPF.

A SuperCup was then introduced. The name chosen, SuperCup Cândido de Oliveira, was in honour of the Portuguese former football enthusiast and national coach in the early days. This competition was played on a yearly-basis between the First Division champion and the Portuguese Cup winner.

Since 1938, the First Division grew from 8 teams to 20 teams in 1989. The professional football was growing and a new professional competition was needed.

==The 1990s reform to nowadays==
With the beginning of the 1990s, the Portuguese Football Federation and the Portuguese League for Professional Football agreed to create a new professional competition between the First Division and the Second Division. It would be called Division of Honour or Second Division of Honour (&quot;Segunda Divisão de Honra&quot;) and relegated the former zone-divided Second Division to third place. This competition continued to exist as &quot;Second Division&quot; but with B added to the name until 2005. From 1999 to 2005 it was divided in 3 zones (North, Center and South). From 2005 to 2012 it was renamed &quot;Second Division&quot; again.

In 2007, the Portuguese League Cup was created. It is only open to clubs that compete in the top two tiers of Portuguese football.

In 2013, the Second and Third Divisions merged to form the Campeonato Nacional de Seniores, the new third-tier football league, and in 2015 the Campeonato Nacional de Seniores was renamed &quot;Campeonato de Portugal&quot;.

In 2020, the FPF announced the creation of Liga 3 which begins in 2021–22, supplanting the Campeonato de Portugal, which becomes the new fourth tier.

== Current league system==
*;Professional

:Primeira Liga (Portuguese League for Professional Football as the governing body)
:Liga Portugal 2 (Portuguese League for Professional Football as the governing body)

*;Non-Professional

:&quot;National&quot;
::Liga 3 in 2021 (Portuguese Football Federation as the governing body)
::Campeonato de Portugal (FPF as the governing body)

:&quot;Regional&quot;
::From one to four League Levels for each Portuguese District Football Associations.

==National cups==
The Portuguese League for Professional Football also rules the Portuguese League Cup.
The Portuguese Football Federation, the Portuguese Cup and the Super Cup.

==Other competitions==
The Portuguese Football Federation also rules the national youth championships, the women&#x27;s football, the indoor-football (or Futsal) and the Beach Soccer, being also responsible for all national teams.

<doc id="909535" wikidata="Q1453422" url="?curid=909535" title="Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland">
<text>The Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland (FPC Church; , ) was formed in 1893. The Church identifies itself as the spiritual descendant of the Scottish Reformation. The Church web-site states that it is &#x27;the constitutional heir of the historic Church of Scotland&#x27;. Its adherents are occasionally referred to as Seceders or the Wee Wee Frees. Although small, the church has congregations on five continents.

The Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland is Calvinist in doctrine, worship and practice and the community believes and professes that it accurately practices and adheres to the Word of God: the Bible. The &quot;subordinate standard&quot; of the church is the Westminster Confession of Faith.

==History==
=== Formation (1893) ===
The founding date of the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland can be traced to 25 May 1893, when Rev. Donald MacFarlane (1834–1926), who was the Free Church of Scotland minister of Raasay, walked out of the General Assembly in protest.

At the 1892 Free Church of Scotland General Assembly, following the example of the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland and the Church of Scotland (1889), the Free Church of Scotland passed a Declaratory Act on 26 May 1892 relaxing the stringency of subscription to the Westminster Confession of Faith, which was widely perceived as paving the way for unification with the United Presbyterian Church.

Macfarlane was not a member of the 1892 Assembly, but he and his Kirk Session at Kilmallie recorded their protest against it.

At the 1893 General Assembly, Macfarlane, who had recently been inducted as pastor of the Raasay congregation, formally protested the Act. The General Assembly rejected his requests and thus confirmed the Act. As a result, he felt compelled to separate himself from the Free Church of Scotland. In this, he was later joined by one other minister, the Rev Donald Macdonald (1825–1901) of Shieldaig. Together they constituted a Presbytery at Raasay on 28 July 1893.

=== Growth ===
The result was that a large number of elders and some congregations, mostly in the Highlands, severed their connection with the Free Church of Scotland and formed the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland, along lines they considered to be more orthodox. By 1907 this body had twenty congregations and twelve ministers.

A few years after the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland was formed (in 1900), the Free Church of Scotland did indeed unite with the United Presbyterian Church of Scotland to form the United Free Church of Scotland, with a somewhat larger minority remaining outside the union and retaining the name Free Church of Scotland. Initially, some wondered if the two churches would merge, but this did not happen, partly because the grounds on which the later separation was based had been the Establishment Principle, rather than the Declaratory Act, which had only been rescinded post separation by the Free Church of Scotland (post 1900). The two denominations took a different view of the 1892 Declaratory Act: the Free Church of Scotland did not regard it as having been a binding measure while the Free Presbyterians did.

In 1905, the Free Presbyterian Synod debated proposals for union with the post-1900 Free Church minority. The Synod declared that it would consider union with a church which held ‘the infallibility and inerrancy of the Scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, and the whole doctrine of the Confession of Faith, both in her profession and practice’. The Synod&#x27;s assessment of the post-1900 Free Church was that ‘although she made ample profession in words’ nevertheless she ‘came far behind in her practice’. One major issue was the Free Church&#x27;s employment of Professor W. M. Alexander, who had written a book which the FPs and some post-1900 Free Church conservatives believed to be ambiguous about the status of the Bible, as a lecturer in its college. A 1917 Free Church Reply to a FPC Statement of Differences stated underlined the fact that Dr Alexander had in 1905 withdrawn the book from circulation, expressed regret &#x27;for any reflections which the book was fitted to cast on the infallibility of the Word of God&#x27; and in 1906 publicly reaffirmed his belief in the inerrancy of Scripture in these words: &#x27;I cherish as more precious than life itself the absolute infallibility of the Word of God&#x27;. However a motion was carried at the 1918 FPC Synod which characterized the Reply as containing &#x27;evasive statements and suggestions of compromise&#x27;.

Some of the Free Presbyterian ministers preferred union with the post-1900 Free Church minority to maintaining a separate Free Presbyterian witness. In 1905 Revs John Macleod (Kames), Alexander Stewart (Edinburgh) and George Mackay (Stornoway) were accepted by the Free Church. In 1918, Revs John R Mackay (Inverness), Alexander Macrae (Portree) and Andrew Sutherland followed suit.
The two denominations are often confused, though not as often as in the past: they were initially of a predominantly Highland background, continue to share support for the Westminster Confession of Faith, and express a socially conservative outlook. However, the Free Presbyterian Church considers it a sin to use public transport to go to church on the Sabbath, while the Free Church does not. The Free Church permits the use of modern Bible translations, while the Free Presbyterian Church prescribes the exclusive use of the Authorized Version in public worship (by resolution of the Synod in 1961), and as the only version recommended for use in family and private devotions.

===Split in 1989===
In 1989, a splinter group formed the Associated Presbyterian Churches &quot;following the perceived failure of the Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland to put into practice chapters 20 and 26 of the Westminster Confession of Faith&quot;, following the suspension of Lord Advocate and Lord Chancellor Lord Mackay of Clashfern as an elder for attending the Roman Catholic Requiem Masses offered for two of his deceased fellow judges. The Moderator of Synod at the time was a minister from Zimbabwe, the late Aaron Ndebele, an Ndebele.

The FPC continues to oppose many aspects of the Catholic Church, including Mass, and has protested from time to time against figures in positions of authority including the British Royal Family attending Mass. It wrote to Prince Charles to complain of his presence at a requiem mass for one of his cousins in 2013. The church maintains that the Pope is the Antichrist.

===Disunity in the Scottish Reformed church scene===

The Free Presbyterians believe that the denominations in Scotland adhering to the Westminster Confession of Faith should unite with it after repentance over historical retreat from the Confession. The FPC Catechism (the 2013 edition is an updated version of the original 1942-1943 edition) says: &#x27;All Presbyterian Churches in Scotland claiming to represent the Reformed Church and who have caused or who maintain schisms contrary to the avowed Westminster Standards are bound to repent and to return to purity in doctrine, worship, government and discipline. The Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland is not guilty of schism and claims to be the true heir of the Reformed Church of Scotland in doctrine, worship, government and discipline. While she certainly does not claim perfection, she maintains that all churches in Scotland should unite around her constitution and testimony&#x27;.

==Twenty-first century developments==
Church extension work tends to be low-key and results to be measured in the long-term in the Free Presbyterian Church. It stresses the need for the Holy Spirit to work in the soul before any spiritual life will be present, the need for the church to provide Bible-based and Christ-focused preaching, emphasizes the need for a holy life by those who claim conversion, and encourages example as well as precept in evangelism. It has not emulated other evangelical churches in their approach to reaching the secular UK. Its Catechism explains: &#x27;Many modern churches have drama, dancing, and music bands in their worship and use sport and social entertainment to attract and retain young people; but these things are of the world and should not be countenanced by the Church of Christ for promoting the interests of the kingdom&#x27;.

Public pronouncements about the current state of the nation tend to combine concern about Free Presbyterian spiritual decline with fears of increased secularization of other Reformed churches. A 2014 report to the FP Religion and Morals Committee quoted from a FP Outer Isles presbytery report, but said the issues were relevant for many other parts of the country. &#x27;We must acknowledge the low state of religion among ourselves&#x27; it said, adding of other denominations: &#x27;...we find that many professing Christians in the Churches are actively encouraged to continue their former worldly interest in professional and amateur sport, worldly music, entertainments such as the cinema, dances, use of public houses, concerts and ceilidhs, and that many speak and dress like the world with little distinction to be found between them and their former companions&#x27;.

==Moderators of Synod==

Unlike the Church of Scotland and Free Church of Scotland, the annual meeting to consider the progress and direction of the church is called a Synod rather than a General Assembly.

<doc id="909536" wikidata="Q993404" url="?curid=909536" title="Ontario Highway 11">
<text>King&#x27;s Highway 11, commonly referred to as Highway 11, is a provincially-maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. At , it is the second-longest highway in the province, after Highway 17. Highway11 begins at Highway 400 in Barrie and arches through northern Ontario to the Ontario–Minnesota border at Rainy River via Thunder Bay; the road continues as Minnesota State Highway 72 across the Baudette–Rainy River International Bridge. North and west of North Bay (as well as for a short distance through Orillia), Highway11 forms part of the Trans-Canada Highway and is part of MOM&#x27;s Way between Thunder Bay and Rainy River.

The original section of Highway11 along Yonge Street was colloquially known as &quot;Main Street Ontario&quot; and was one of the first roads in what would later become Ontario. It was devised as an overland military route between York (Toronto) and Penetanguishene. Yonge Street serves as the east–west divide throughout York Region and Toronto.

Highway11 became a provincial highway in 1920 when the network was formed, although many of the roads that make up the route were constructed before the highway was designated. At the time, it only extended between Toronto and north of Orillia. In 1937, the route was extended to Hearst, northwest of Timmins. The route was extended to Nipigon by 1943. In 1965, Highway11 was extended to Rainy River, bringing it to its maximum length of . The southernmost leg, an section (including the Bradford–Barrie extension) through Barrie and south to Lake Ontario in Toronto, also known as Yonge Street, was decommissioned as a provincial highway in 1996 and 1997.

From the late 1940s through the 1960s, numerous bypasses of towns along the route were built, including Orillia, Washago, Gravenhurst, Bracebridge, Huntsville, Emsdale, Powassan, Callander, North Bay, Cobalt, Haileybury, New Liskeard and Thunder Bay. Beginning in the 1960s, the highway was expanded to four lanes between Barrie and North Bay in stages. Four-laning was completed between Barrie and Gravenhurst in the 1960s, between Gravenhurst and Huntsville in the 1970s, and from North Bay south to Callander in the 1980s. The remaining two-lane section between Huntsville and Callander was expanded through the 1990s and 2000s and completed in 2012. A section concurrent with Highway17 east of Thunder Bay was rebuilt as a divided highway in the early 2010s and work continues. After a structural failure in 2016, the two-lane Nipigon River Bridge was replaced with a twin-span bridge that opened in 2018.

== Route description ==
Highway11 varies between a divided four-lane urban freeway and a two-lane rural road. It travels through surroundings ranging from cities to farmland to the uninhabited wilderness. The section through northern Ontario includes several sections with no gas or service for over . Significant urban centres serviced by the route include Barrie, Orillia, Gravenhurst, Bracebridge, Huntsville, North Bay, Temiskaming Shores, Cochrane, Kapuskasing, Hearst, Nipigon, Thunder Bay, Atikokan, Fort Frances and Rainy River.
It is often paired with Yonge Street in the persistent but incorrect factoid that Yonge Street is the longest street in the world, a claim that was featured in the book of Guinness World Records from 1977 to 1998.

=== Barrie – North Bay ===
Highway11 begins at an interchange with Highway400 on the north side of Barrie, travelling northeast parallel to the northwestern shore of Lake Simcoe. The four-lane route, divided by a median barrier, crosses former Highway93 (Penetanguishene Road) and passes through a generally flat rural area, though businesses line both sides of the route. At the northern end of Lake Simcoe, the highway enters Orillia, where it is built as a divided freeway. It meets and becomes concurrent with Highway12 for . At Laclie Drive, the route exits Orillia and returns to a RIRO design with rural surroundings. It travels northward along the western shore of Lake Couchiching as far as Washago, then crosses the Severn River / Trent Severn Waterway.
North of the Severn River, Highway11 travels through the Canadian Shield; large granite outcroppings are frequent and thick Boreal forest dominates the terrain. At Gravenhurst, the highway makes a sharp curve to the east, then becomes a divided freeway before curving northward around Gull Lake. Near Bracebridge, it meets Highway 118 and former Highway 117. Highway 141 branches west from the route between Bracebridge and Huntsville, while Highway 60 branches east towards Algonquin Park in Huntsville. The section between Gravenhurst and Bracebridge is at freeway standards, while several at-grade intersections remain between Bracebridge and Huntsville. Highway11 crosses the 45th parallel north north of the bridge carrying Highway118 at interchange182, just outside Bracebridge.

The section of Highway11 between Huntsville and North Bay provides access to the western side of Algonquin Park. It also connects to Highway 518 at Emsdale, Highway 520 at Burk&#x27;s Falls, Highway 124 at Sundridge and South River, Highway 522 at Trout Creek, Highway 534 at Powassan, and Highway 94 and Highway 654 at Callander. Most of this section is built to freeway standards, although a small number of at-grade intersections remain, primarily between Trout Creek and Callander.

=== North Bay – Nipigon ===

From its junction with Highway17 at North Bay, the two highways share a concurrency for to the Algonquin Avenue intersection, where Highway17 continues west toward Sudbury and Sault Ste. Marie while Highway11 turns north onto Algonquin Avenue. Due to a steep incline as it descends Thibeault Hill into North Bay, the southbound Algonquin Avenue segment of Highway11 features the only runaway truck ramp on Ontario&#x27;s highway system, which was upgraded in 2009.
From North Bay, Highway11 extends northerly for , passing through communities such as Temagami, Latchford, Temiskaming Shores, Englehart and Matheson en route to Cochrane, where the route turns west. From Cochrane, it passes through communities such as Smooth Rock Falls, Kapuskasing, Hearst and Greenstone, arching across northeastern Ontario westward then south for before again meeting Highway17 at Nipigon.

=== Nipigon – Rainy River ===
Nearly the entire route from Nipigon to Rainy River is a two-lane, undivided road, with the exception of two twinned, four-lane segments approaching Thunder Bay. The first starts just west of Nipigon and ends just north of the Black Sturgeon River, for a distance of . The second portion reaches a distance of , from Highway587 at Pass Lake to Balsam Street in Thunder Bay. Work is being done to twin the route from Ouimet to Dorion. Additionally, the section from Balsam Street to the Harbour Expressway is four lanes wide, but undivided. The partial cloverleaf interchange at Thunder Bay&#x27;s Hodder Avenue is the only interchange in Northwestern Ontario.

Highway11 and 17 run concurrently from Nipigon down to Thunder Bay, a distance of approximately , where they swing west on the Shabaqua Highway, encountering Kakabeka Falls several kilometers later. The highway then runs in a northwestern direction to Shabaqua Corners, where the two highways split; Highway17 continues northwest to Dryden and Kenora, while Highway11 continues in a generally west direction, eventually reaching Highway11B at Atikokan, approximately halfway between Thunder Bay and Rainy River. The highway continues for , crosses the Noden Causeway, and reaches Fort Frances, where Highway71 runs south across the U.S. border to International Falls. From here, Highway11 shares a concurrency with Highway71 for until the latter branches north after Emo, while Highway11 runs parallel to the border for before ending at the town of Rainy River, where the roadway continues into Baudette, Minnesota, and ends at Minnesota State Route11.

=== Business routes ===
Highway 11B is the designation for business routes of Highway11, ten of which have existed over the years. Two continue to exist today, while the remaining eight have been decommissioned. With the exception of the short spur route into Atikokan, all were once the route of Highway11 prior to the completion of a bypass alignment. All sections of Highway11B have now been decommissioned by the province with the exception of the Atikokan route and the southernmost section of the former Tri-Town route between Cobalt and Highway11.

== History ==
=== Predecessors ===
The earliest established section of Highway11 is Yonge Street in Toronto and York Region, though it is no longer under provincial jurisdiction. Yonge Street was built under the order of the first Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada (now Ontario), John Graves Simcoe. Fearing imminent attack by the United States, he sought to create a military route between York (now Toronto) and Lake Simcoe. In doing so, he would create an alternative means of reaching the upper Great Lakes and the trading post at Michilimackinac, bypassing the American border.

In late 1793, Simcoe determined the route of his new road. The following spring, he instructed Deputy Surveyor General Augustus Jones to blaze a small trail marking the route.
Simcoe initiated construction of the road by granting land to settlers, who in exchange were required to clear of frontage on the road passing their lot.
In the summer of 1794, William Berczy was the first to take up the offer, leading a group of 64 families north-east of Toronto to found the town of German Mills, in today&#x27;s Markham. By the end of 1794, Berczy&#x27;s settlers had cleared the route around Thornhill. However, the settlement was hit by a series of setbacks and road construction stalled.

Work on the road resumed in 1795 when the Queen&#x27;s Rangers took over. They began their work at Eglinton Avenue and proceeded north, reaching the site of St. Albans on February16, 1796. Expansion of the trail into a road was a condition of settlement for farmers along the route, who were required to spend 12days a year to clear the road of logs, subsequently removed by convicted drunks as part of their sentence. The southern end of the road was in use in the first decade of the 19th century, and became passable all the way to the northern end in 1816.

For several years the Holland River and Lake Simcoe provided the only means of transportation; Holland Landing was the northern terminus of Yonge Street. The military route to Georgian Bay prior to, and during the War of 1812, crossed Lake Simcoe to the head of Kempenfelt Bay, then by the Nine Mile Portage to Willow Creek and the Nottawasaga River. The Penetanguishene Military Post was started before the war. However, lacking a suitable overland transport route, passage from York to Lake Huron continued via the Nottawasaga. The Penetanguishene Road, begun in 1814, replaced this route by the time the military post was opened in 1817.

In 1824, work began to extend Yonge Street to Kempenfelt Bay near Barrie. A north-western extension was branched off the original Yonge Street in Holland Landing and ran into the new settlement of Bradford before turning north towards Barrie. Work was completed by 1827, making connections with the Penetanguishene Road. A network of colonization roads built in the 1830s (some with military strategy in mind) pushed settlement northeast along the shores of Lake Simcoe and north towards the shores of Georgian Bay.
Construction of the Muskoka Road began by the 1860s. The road, which penetrated the southern skirts of the Canadian Shield and advanced towards Lake Nipissing, reached as far as Bracebridge by 1861, and to Huntsville by 1863.
It was officially opened when it reached Lake Nipissing in 1874.
Further extensions into Northern Ontario would await the arrival of the automobile, and consequent need for highway networks.

=== Assumption and paving ===
Highway 11 was initially planned as a trunk road to connect the communities of Southern Ontario to those of Northern Ontario, as a continuous route from Toronto to North Bay. In 1919, Premier of Ontario Ernest Charles Drury created the Department of Public Highways (DPHO), though much of the responsibility for establishing the route he left to minister of the new cabinet position, Frank Campbell Biggs. By linking together several previously built roads such as Yonge Street, Penetanguishene Road, Middle Crossroad and the Muskoka Road—all early colonization roads in the region—a continuous route was created between Toronto and North Bay; however, the new department&#x27;s jurisdiction did not extend north of the Severn River. Roads north of that point were maintained by the Department of Northern Development (DND).

In order to be eligible for federal funding, the DPHO established a network of provincial highways on February26, 1920. What would become Highway11 was routed along Yonge Street, its extension to the Penetanguishene Road, and the Muskoka Road as far as the Severn River.
The portions of Yonge Street through what is now York Region, as well as Toronto as far south as Yonge Boulevard, were assumed by the DPHO on June24, 1920, while the portions through Simcoe County, from Bradford to Severn Bridge were assumed two months later on August18.
It received its numerical designation in the summer of 1925.

The new route was mostly unpaved, with work beginning in 1922 to improve the roadway. That year saw paving completed between Yonge Boulevard and Thornhill, as well as a bypass of the original route through Holland Landing (now known as York Regional Road83).
The pavement was extended farther north from Thornhill to Richmond Hill the following year.
By 1925, the route was paved from Toronto north to Fennell, as well as between Orillia and Washago.
An additional north from Fennell were paved in 1926. In 1927, the pavement between Toronto and Barrie was completed with the paving of approximately south from Barrie.
Between Barrie and Orillia, paving began in 1929, with the completion of approximately east from Guthrie; at that point the highway turned north at 11th Line, then east at East Oro along Sideroad15/16. That year also saw paving completed from Washago to north of Gravenhurst.
The following year, the newly-renamed Department of Highways (DHO) paved the remaining 13kilometres between Barrie and Guthrie,
while the DND paved the Muskoka Road from Gravenhurst to Huntsville.
The final of unpaved road between Barrie and Orillia was completed in 1931.

=== Ferguson Highway and extension to Nipigon ===

Throughout the 1910s and early 1920s, various chambers of commerce, rotary clubs and boards of trade petitioned the government to construct a new trunk road from North Bay towards the mining communities to the north that were established in the prior decades.
These delegations and committees also saw the potential tourist draw of opening the Temagami area to hunters, fishers, and recreational tourism.
By 1923, a road existed between Cobalt and Kirkland Lake, as well as between Ramore and Cochrane, with an approximately gap separating the two sections.
Conservative leader Howard Ferguson promised to build a road to connect North Bay and Cochrane during the 1923 Ontario general election, which saw him elected as premier.

The route of the new road between North Bay and Cobalt was cleared by April 1925,
after which construction began in August from both North Bay as well as Cobalt.
The new gravel highway was officially opened on July2, 1927, by Minister of Lands and Forests William Finlayson. He suggested at the opening that the road be named the Ferguson Highway in honour of premier Ferguson. The name was originally suggested by North Bay mayor Dan Barker.
Despite the official opening, a section between Swastika and Ramore wasn&#x27;t opened until August.
The Ferguson Highway name was also applied to the Muskoka Road between Severn Bridge and North Bay.
Although the route from North Bay to Cochrane was passable, it was not an adequate road in many places. Construction continued for several years to build bypasses of sharp turns, steep grades, awkward rail crossings, and other obstacles. The Ferguson Highway was extended from Cochrane to Kapuskasing by 1930, and later to Hearst in 1932.

The Provincial Highway Network was radically overhauled in 1937, when the merged with the on April1. Consequently, the DHO assumed responsibility of roads north of the Trent–Severn Waterway over the next several months. On June2, of the Ferguson Highway was assumed by the DHO through Cochrane District. This was followed one week later when of the Muskoka Road through the District of Muskoka were assumed on June9. A portion of the route, which included a portion of what is now Highway 94 to connect to the Dionne quintuplets, was assumed through Parry Sound District on June16. On June30, of the Ferguson Highway were assumed north of North Bay within Nipissing District, as well as through Timiskaming District. Highway11 grew in length from to .

Construction began in 1938 on a road to connect Highway17 at Nipigon with the gold mines discovered near the town of Geraldton several years earlier.
Although portions of this new road were passable by the end of 1939,
the Nipigon–Geraldton Highway was opened ceremoniously by Thomas McQuesten and C. D. Howe on September7, 1940;
it was assumed as a provincial highway in 1941.
With the onset of World War II, the need for an east–west connection across Canada became imperative,
and construction began on a link between Geraldton and Hearst, a distance of in 1939. Due to the shortage of labour, several prison camps were established between the two communities in October of that year and work began to clear a tote road for the movement of supplies over the following winter.
While the highway was completed in November 1942, it was not maintained during through the winter, and the official opening did not take place until June12, 1943.
Following this, Highway11 was extended to Nipigon, and was long.
=== Thunder Bay – Rainy River ===

Highway11 ended at Nipigon until the late 1950s, after construction of a new highway west from Thunder Bay towards Fort Frances began. 
During World War II, large deposits of iron ore were discovered at Steep Rock Lake, around which the town of Atikokan was developed.
The need to connect the burgeoning community to the road network became apparent following a rail strike in August 1950, during which a &quot;mercy train&quot; was delivered to the isolated town. Throughout the fall of 1950, various delegates pressed the provincial government to construct a road link immediately.
The province announced plans for the new highway between Atikokan and Shebandowan the following August,
and released the proposed route on October10; construction began shortly thereafter.
The Atikokan Highway was ceremonially opened by premier Leslie Frost on August13, 1954, although traffic had used the incomplete road beginning in November 1953. At that event, which saw him use an axe to cut a ribbon, Frost announced the future vision to extend the new route to Fort Frances. Despite the opening, work was ongoing to improve the existing road between the end of the new highway at Shebandowan and Highway17 at Shabaqua Corners.

Initially this road was designated as Highway120. In 1959, it was decided to make this new link a westward extension of Highway11. On April1, 1960, Highway11 assumed the route of Highway120; this consequently created a concurrency of Highway11 and 17 between Nipigon and west of Thunder Bay.
Now reaching as far as Atikokan, construction of a road between there and Fort Frances was carried out over the next five years. The final link, the Noden Causeway over Rainy Lake, was opened on June28, 1965, after which Highway11 was extended to Rainy River and the American border.
Highway11 was now at its peak length of .

=== Lakehead Expressway ===

In 1963, Charles MacNaughton, minister of the Department of Highways, announced plans for the Lakehead Expressway to be built on the western edge of the twin cities of Port Arthur and Fort William (which amalgamated in 1970 to form Thunder Bay).
Plans called for a at-grade expressway from South of Arthur Street to meet Highway11 and Highway17 northeast of the cities.
Work began in August 1965, with a contract for a section of divided highway on the west side of the twin cities.
The first section of the expressway opened on August29, 1967, connecting Oliver Road (then part of Highway 130) and Golf Links Road with Dawson Road (Highway 102).
By mid- to late 1969, the route had been extended to Highway 527 northeast of the twin cities and to Highway11 and Highway17 (Arthur Street) at the Harbour Expressway.
By late 1970, the route had been extended southward from Arthur Street to Neebing Avenue / Walsh Street West. At this time, Highway11 and 17 and Highway61 were rerouted along the completed expressway. The old routes through Thunder Bay were redesignated as Highway 11B/17B and Highway 61B.

=== Expansion and rerouting ===

While Highway11 was extended farther north and west between the 1920s and 1960s, numerous projects took place along the sections between Barrie and Cochrane during that period to either realign the highway to improve the geometry, or to bypass built up areas. The largest bottleneck along the highway in the 1940s was between Washago and through Gravenhurst, where construction began in 1947 to realign between the two towns, including a new high-level bridge over the Trent–Severn Waterway.
The original bypass of Gravenhurst, along what is now Bethune Drive, opened in 1948,
while reconstruction of the remainder of the route between Washago and Gravenhurst was completed in 1949.

To the south, improvements between Barrie and Orillia, including a divided four-lane highway around the latter, were completed by 1955.
During that period, a two-lane bypass around Washago was built between 1954 and 1955.
Similar bypasses were built between Barrie and North Bay over the next decade, which were later incorporated into the modern four-lane route. A bypass of Bracebridge opened July1, 1953.
The North Bay bypass was completed in 1953,
while bypasses of Emsdale and Powassan were completed 1956
and 1957, respectively. Construction of the Huntsville Bypass began in 1957;
it opened November27, 1959.
The original Callander Bypass, which is now divided into Callander Bay Drive and part of Highway 93, also opened in October 1959.
Further north, the Tri-Town Bypass, from Gillies to north of New Liskeard, was opened on September18. The new route bypassed the towns of Cobalt, Haileybury and New Liskeard (the latter two which have since become part of Temiskaming Shores).
In several cases, the original route of Highway11 became a business route (Highway11B, see #Business routes) upon the completion of a bypass.

Beginning in 1965
Highway11 was widened to a divided four-lane route between Orillia and North Bay. Initially, this work began at the southern end and progressed northwards; work later began southwards from North Bay.
The first section to be four-laned was north of Orillia, which was completed in October 1964, while the remaining north to Severn River was completed by the end of 1965.
Construction continued north of Severn River, with a section—including a second bridge over the Severn River—opening as far north as Kahshe Lake in October 1966. Construction on the next from Kahshe Lake to south of Gravenhurst began that year.
The current bypass of Gravenhurst, crossing Gull Lake, was announced on March31, 1966,
and construction began in the spring of 1967.
The new bypass was completed and opened in late 1970.

By 1971, Highway11 was a four lane divided highway from Orillia to the northern interchange with Bethune Drive in Gravenhurst, and work was underway on twinning the highway between Gravenhurst and then-Highway 117 (now Highway 118), north of Bracebridge;
That project was completed by 1974.
Between then and 1979, widening was completed to north of Highway 141 at Stephenson Road12 along the existing route of Highway11, and underway for another to the southern end of the Huntsville Bypass.

=== Downloading and four-laning Huntsville to Powassan ===
In 1996 and 1997, the care (or rescinding of Connecting Link agreements) of Highway11 from Barrie southwards, including all of Yonge Street, was transferred by the provincial government to county, regional, and city governments by the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario as part of the Mike Harris government&#x27;s Common Sense Revolution. This practice is called downloading, in that the financial burden will fall to a lower tier government. The entire of Highway11 within York Region was transferred to the region on April1, 1996.
This was followed up a year later with the transfer of of the highway within Simcoe County south of Crown Hill on April1, 1997.
Along with the name Yonge Street, the section in York Region is now York Regional Road1, while the section in Simcoe County is now mostly Simcoe County Road4. Within the Cities of Toronto and Barrie it is simply either Yonge Street or the sections of various streets the highway followed.

By 1997, the four-laning of Highway11 reached to approximately north of Highway60,
where an interchange was built in 1992,
as well as from North Bay south to Powassan.
A continuous construction project was carried out over the next 15years to widen the remaining between Huntsville and Powassan.
A project to twin the existing two lane highway between Powassan and McGillvray Creek opened in September 1997. This was followed in October 1999 with the opening of another of twinning from McGillvray Creek south to Hummel Line, north of Trout Creek.

In the early 2000s, several more sections were completed at both the north and south end of the remaining two lane highway. A section was opened in September 2001 north of the Huntsville Bypass to south of Novar, mostly along a new alignment alongside the existing highway. On October3, 2002, the southbound lanes of the Trout Creek Bypass, a new alignment around that town, were opened, followed by the northbound lanes two weeks later. An additional of twinning was completed by the end of that year between Novar and south of Emsdale.

In 2003, a major failure of the Sgt. Aubrey Cosens VC Memorial Bridge at the Montreal River in Latchford caused a complete closure and significant detour.
A temporary one-lane Bailey bridge, which opened two weeks after the incident, was constructed to carry traffic on the highway;
due to the expected water levels on the Montreal River once ice and snow began to melt in the spring, however, a second temporary bridge then had to be constructed for the duration of the original bridge&#x27;s reconstruction. 
According to the Ministry of Transportation&#x27;s final report, the failure was caused by a fatigue fracture of three steel hanger rods on the northwest side of the bridge.
Following reconstruction, the bridge resumed service in 2005. Each hanger rod was replaced with four cable wires, to provide greater stability in the event of a wire failure.

On October30, 2004, another of four-laning was opened between the south end of the Trout Creek Bypass and north of South River.
To the south, a bypass of Emsdale opened the week of October21, 2005, with a portion of the original Emsdale Bypass (constructed in 1956) remaining as Highway 518.
This left a gap remaining to be four-laned; by 2009, construction was underway on .
A section from south of Burk&#x27;s Falls to south of Katrine was four-laned by late 2010, mostly along a new alignment. The Sundridge–South River Bypass opened to traffic on or about September20, 2011, along a new alignment.
The final two projects, twinning the Burk&#x27;s Falls Bypass and a new alignment alongside the existing highway between Burk&#x27;s Falls and Sundridge, were completed and opened together on August8, 2012, completing the four laning between Barrie and North Bay. Overall, the project between Huntsville and Powassan required &quot;16new interchanges, 54new bridges, 1.7million cubic meters of rock excavation, 10.5million cubic metres of earth excavation, 4.6million tonnes of granular material applied and 500,000tonnes of asphalt.&quot;

=== Since 2010 ===
Plans for four-laning Highway11/17 from the end of the Thunder Bay Expressway northeast to Nipigon, including the Nipigon River Bridge, were first announced in December 1989.
The corridor was divided into four segments, and an Environmental Study Report (ESR) was published for each in 1996 or 1997.
While the MTO designated the corridor—a mix of twinning the existing highway and a new alignment—in 2003, funding wasn&#x27;t committed to the project until the late 2000s. In early-to-mid 2009, the provincial government announced the first of several contracts to expand the highway, starting from the Thunder Bay end. Construction on the , $42-million contract began in August 2010, from west of Hodder Avenue to Highway 527.
The westbound lanes opened the weekend of August 6, 2011;
the existing highway was then rebuilt as the eastbound lanes, and opened on August 17, 2012. An interchange at Hodder Avenue—the first in Northwestern Ontario—was included as part of this project

By 2012, construction was already underway on two more contracts: A $46-million project to twin of the existing highway between Highway527 and west of Mackenzie Station Road that began in 2010,
and another 12.3-kilometre project built along a new alignment east of that point to Birch Beach Road. The latter project was completed first, opening in July 2013,
while the former was opened the week of September 29, 2014.

Construction began in 2013 on a new four lane cable-stayed bridge across the Nipigon River, to replace the existing two lane bridge built in 1974.
The southern span to carry the future westbound lanes was opened on November28, 2015, after which the old bridge closed. It was subsequently demolished to allow the construction of the northern span to carry eastbound traffic, which was scheduled for 2017.
However, on January10, 2016, the bridge experienced a significant structural failure in which the deck raised , severing the only highway connection between eastern and western Canada.
A single lane was reopened the following day and repairs began; both lanes were reopened on February25, 2016.
The failure caused a significant delay in the construction of the northern span, which did not open until November23, 2018,
The of approaches at each end were completed in 2019.

On June 10, 2015, the province announced the awarding of two contracts: A $32.7 million contract awarded to twin of the existing highway from Birch Beach Road to Highway 587 near Loon, and an $84.8 million contract to construct a new alignment from Red Rock Road No. 9 to Stillwater Creek near Nipigon.
Construction began on the former in October,
and on the latter by the end of June. The section from Birch Beach Road to Highway587 was completed on September 1, 2017,
while the section from Red Rock Road No. 9 to Stillwater Creek was completed in September 2019.

On March 29, 2022, the Government of Ontario announced that it was extending its speed limit increase, on a trial basis, to the section of Highway11 from north of Katrine to north of South River.

== Future ==
Work is ongoing or upcoming to twin or realign the remaining of two-laned Highway11/17 between Thunder Bay and Nipigon. On December8, 2020, a $71-million contract was awarded for a mix of twinning and a new alignment for from Superior Shores Road south of Ouimet to south of Dorion Loop Road near Dorion. Construction started a few weeks earlier at the end of November. The project is scheduled for completion in September 2023.
On July11, 2022, of the new eastbound lanes opened from Ouimet Canyon Road to Superior Shores Road. The remainder of the eastbound lanes, from Ouimet Canyon Road to Dorion Loop Road, are scheduled to open by the end of the year.

On April9, 2022, the province announced a $107-million contract to twin and realign of Highway11/17 from the end of the existing four lane route near Highway 587 to Pearl. Construction is scheduled to begin in late 2022 and be completed in 2026.

The remaining 
are in the detailed design process as of 2022, and are broken up into several sections: between Pearl and south of Ouimet; between Dorion Loop Road and near Highway 582; between Highway582 and Coughlin Road; between Coughlin Road and Red Rock Road No. 9, crossing the Black Sturgeon River and connecting with the existing four lane route, and; through Nipigon, between Stillwater Creek and First Street.

Highway11 between Barrie and Gravenhurst is currently a right-in/right-out (RIRO) expressway (local access permitted, turnarounds via special interchanges), except for a section around Orillia which is a full freeway. Another freeway section (formerly Highway400A) does exist in Barrie with the freeway segment from the southern terminus ending at Penetanguishene Road (Simcoe County Road93). The MTO is currently planning on either converting the existing RIRO expressway to a full six-lane freeway or bypassing it with an entirely new alignment. An environmental and fiscal study concluded that the improvements from Barrie to Gravenhurst will involve the existing route being widened with the exception of a portion south of Gravenhurst that may potentially be constructed to the east of the current road.

<text>A software publisher is a publishing company in the software industry between the developer and the distributor. In some companies, two or all three of these roles may be combined (and indeed, may reside in a single person, especially in the case of shareware).

Software publishers often license software from the original author-developers with specific limitations, such as a time limit or geographical region for a royalty consideration. The terms of licensing vary enormously, and are typically secret.

The author-developers may use publishers to reach larger or foreign markets. Typically, the publisher will bear most of the cost of entering these markets. In return they pay the developer an agreed upon royalty payment.

The duties of the publisher can vary greatly depending on the agreement reached between the parties. Duties can include:

*Translating language elements into the local language
*Building demand for the software in the local market
*Produce &amp; Design boxed software products
*Technical support of the product locally
*Advertising in the local market - this includes creating the advertising as well as paying to have it displayed
*Develop the many sales channels in order to reach the largest audience
*Market the software to the end customers

Publishers may also use developers to create software to meet a market need that the publisher has identified.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics code for Software Publishers is 511200.

<text>The Primeira Liga (), officially known as Liga Portugal Betclic for sponsorship reasons, is the top level of the Portuguese football league system. Organised and supervised by the Liga Portugal, it is contested by 18 teams since the 2014–15 season, with the three lowest-placed teams relegated to the Liga Portugal 2 and replaced by the top-three non-reserve teams from this division.

Founded in 1934 as Campeonato da Liga da Primeira Divisão, it was named Campeonato Nacional da Primeira Divisão from 1938 until 1999, when it was changed to its current naming. Over 70 teams have competed in the Primeira Liga, but only five have been crowned champions. Among them, the &quot;Big Three&quot; teams – Benfica (38 wins), Porto (30) and Sporting CP (20) – have won all but two Primeira Liga titles; the other winners are Belenenses (1945–46) and Boavista (2000–01).

The Primeira Liga reached a world ranking of fourth according to IFFHS&#x27;s 2011 ranking.

==History==
Before the Portuguese football reform of 1938, a competition on a round-basis was already being held – the &quot;Primeira Liga&quot; (Premier League) and the winners of that competition were named &quot;League champions&quot;. Despite that, a Championship of Portugal in a knock-out cup format was the most popular and defined the &quot;Portuguese champion&quot;, although the winners of this competition no longer count as Portuguese football champions.

Then, with the reform, a round-robin basis competition was implemented as the most important of the calendar and began defining the Portuguese champion. From 1938 to 1999, the name &quot;Campeonato Nacional da Primeira Divisão&quot; (National Championship of the First Division) or just &quot;Primeira Divisão&quot; (First Division), was used.

Porto won the inaugural edition of the new league championship and successfully defended the title in the next season. In 1939–40 the tournament was expanded from eight to ten clubs, due to an administrative battle between Porto and Académico do Porto, regarding a Regional Championship game that ended with only 43 minutes after the start, and later repeated (which FC Porto won) according to Porto FA decision. FPF came out with a decision to satisfy both clubs, expanding the championship to 10 teams (one more from Porto FA and another from Setúbal FA) and annulling the result from the repetition match. With this decision, FC Porto lost the Regional title and finished in 3rd, Leixões SC became the new regional champion, while Académico was 2nd place. All 3 teams qualified for 1939–40 Primeira Divisão.

In the 1941–42 season, it was decided to expand the championship from eight to ten teams to admit Braga FA and Algarve FA champions (until this season only the top teams from Porto, Coimbra, Lisboa and Setúbal were admitted). Porto finished the regional championship in third place again, which did not grant entry into the Primeira Liga. However, a second expand (from 10 to 12) in the same season was decided, which allowed the club to participate.

After the 1945–46 season, the qualifying system based on regional championships was abandoned and adopted a pyramid system, with relegations and promotions between the 3 tiers. The clubs in Primeira Divisão, Segunda Divisão and Terceira Divisão no longer had to play their district championships on the same season as they had been doing since the first seasons of the Liga. Below is a complete record of how many teams played in each season throughout the league&#x27;s history;
* 8 clubs: 1934–1939
* 10 clubs: 1939–1940
* 8 clubs: 1940–1941
* 12 clubs: 1941–1942
* 10 clubs: 1942–1945
* 12 clubs: 1945–1946
* 14 clubs: 1946–1971
* 16 clubs: 1971–1987
* 20 clubs: 1987–1989
* 18 clubs: 1989–1990
* 20 clubs: 1990–1991
* 18 clubs: 1991–2006
* 16 clubs: 2006–2014
* 18 clubs: 2014–present

When the Portuguese League for Professional Football took control of the two nationwide leagues in 1999, it was renamed &quot;Primeira Liga&quot; (Premier League).

===Big Three===

&quot;The Big Three&quot; () is a nickname for the three most powerful sports clubs in Portugal. With the exception of Belenenses in 1945–46 and Boavista in 2000–01, only three clubs have won the Primeira Liga title – Benfica (38 times), Porto (30) and Sporting CP (20). These three clubs generally end up sharing the top three positions (thus, appearing more frequently in UEFA competitions) and are the only clubs to have played in every season of the competition.

These clubs dominate Portuguese football, and it has become typical for fans to support any of these teams as a &quot;first club&quot;, with a local team probably coming afterwards, if at all. The &quot;Big Three&quot; have the highest average attendance ratings every season in Portugal, while many other teams, lacking support from the locals, have suffered from poor attendance. The lack of support for local teams is considered to be one of the main reasons why Portuguese Football registers one of the worst attendance ratings in European Football&#x27;s best championships, alongside the broadcast of almost all the games on television. In other sports, the rivalry between the big clubs is also considerable and it usually leads to arguments between the fans and players.

Benfica is the club with most league, cup and league cup titles, as well as the most domestic titles (81) and overall titles won (83 or 84, if the Latin Cup is taken into account), including back-to-back European Cup trophies. Porto is the club with most Portuguese Super Cups and international titles won (7).

Sporting CP holds the third place when it comes to the most league and cup titles. Benfica is the only Portuguese club to have won two consecutive European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, reaching ten European finals: seven European Cups and three UEFA Cup/Europa League, and was runner-up in two Intercontinental Cups. Porto is the only Portuguese club since 1987 to have won any international competition (excluding the UEFA Intertoto Cup), gathering a total of two European Cup/UEFA Champions Leagues, two UEFA Cup/Europa Leagues, one European Super Cup and two Intercontinental Cups and finished runner-up in one European Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup and three UEFA Super Cups. Sporting won one European Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup and was runner-up in one UEFA Cup. Apart from the big three, Braga won the last UEFA Intertoto Cup and was runner-up in one UEFA Europa League.

===Sponsored names===
Galp Energia acquired the naming rights to the league in 2002, titling the division SuperLiga GalpEnergia. A four-year deal with the Austrian sports betting bwin was announced on 18 August 2005 amid questioning by the other gambling authorities in Portugal (the Santa Casa da Misericórdia and the Portuguese Casinos Association), who claimed to hold the exclusive rights to legal gambling games in Portuguese national territory. After holding the name Liga betandwin.com for the 2005–06 season, the name was changed to bwin LIGA in July 2006.

From the 2008–09 season to the 2009–10 season the league was named Liga Sagres due to sponsorship from Sagres beer. In 2010, they renewed the sponsorship from Sagres, but also got the sponsorship from ZON Multimédia. The league was named Liga ZON Sagres until 2013–14 after the sponsorship agreement between Sagres, ZON (now NOS) and the league ended. In 2015, the league was named Liga NOS until the 2020–21 season. From 2021 to 2023, it was known Liga Portugal Bwin. Since 2023, it is called Liga Portugal Betclic.

==Competition==
Since the 2014–15 season, there are 18 clubs in the Primeira Liga, up from 16 in the previous seasons. During the course of a season, each club plays all teams twice – once at their home stadium and once at their opponent&#x27;s stadium – for a total of 34 games. At the end of each season, the two lowest placed teams are relegated to the Segunda Liga and the top two teams from Segunda Liga are promoted to the Primeira Liga.

===Qualification for European competitions===
The top teams in Primeira Liga qualify for the UEFA Champions League, with the top two teams entering the group stage directly. The third placed team enters the playoffs for the group stage of the UEFA Champions League; if they fail to qualify, they enter the UEFA Europa League, along with the fourth placed team and the Taça de Portugal cup winners. If the Taça de Portugal cup winners qualify for the UEFA Champions League through league placing, the berth is given to the fifth placed team.

== League attendance record ==
Since the beginning of the league, there are three clubs with an attendance much higher than the others: Benfica, Porto and Sporting CP. They have also the biggest stadiums in Portugal, with more than 50,000 seats. Other clubs, such as Vitória de Guimarães and Braga, also have good attendances. Académica de Coimbra, Vitória de Setúbal, Boavista, Belenenses, and Marítimo are historical clubs, with more than 30 top-flight seasons, from the biggest Portuguese cities, and have also many supporters. However, they do not have big attendances nowadays. Their stadiums have between 10,000 and 30,000 seats.

In the 2023–24 season, Liga Portugal broke the record for stadium attendance in the last 12 years of Liga records, with an increase of more than 10% compared to the previous season. The total accumulated audience figures were 3,707,290 and 556,267 people, giving an average attendance of 12,115 and 1,818 spectators in the Primeira and Segunda Liga, respectively. It&#x27;s also the highest in the last 33 years and the only one to pass the 12,000 barrier since the 1990–91 season.

This is due to the League&#x27;s joint initiative with Continente “&quot;É Para Cartão&quot;” to bring families back to the stadiums. The slogan “&quot;Football is You&quot;” was a success, as this season many historic clubs in lower leagues managed to have much higher averages than several clubs in the Primeira Liga.

The 2023–24 season saw the following average attendance by club:
==List of champions and top scorers==
* Before 1995–96, the points were awarded in a format of two points for a win. In that season, Primeira Liga switched to the now standard three points for a win system.
* (1) Porto saw six points subtracted for corruption allegations in the Apito Dourado, but they recovered those points in July 2017.

==Performance by club==
All Primeira Liga champions have come from either Lisbon or Porto.
==All-time Primeira Liga table==
The all-time Primeira Liga table is an overall record of all match results, points, and goals of every team that has played in Primeira Liga since its inception in 1934.

<text>La Movida Madrileña (, &quot;The Madrilenian Scene&quot;), also known as &quot;La Movida&quot;, was a countercultural movement that took place mainly in Madrid during the Spanish transition to democracy after the death of dictator Francisco Franco in 1975. The movement coincided with economic growth in Spain and a widespread desire for the development of a post-Francoist identity. The &quot;Concierto homenaje a Canito&quot; (Canito Memorial Concert), which took place on February 9, 1980, is traditionally considered the beginning of &quot;La Movida Madrileña&quot;.

&quot;La Movida Madrileña&quot; featured a rise in punk rock and synth-pop music, an openness regarding sexual expression and drug usage, and the emergence of new dialects such as cheli. This hedonistic cultural wave started in Madrid before appearing in other Spanish cities such as Barcelona, Bilbao and Vigo.

== Origins ==
In the years following the death of Francisco Franco, a growing underground punk rock music scene began to form in Madrid. Inspired by the growth of punk rock in the United Kingdom, a number of punk and synthpop bands, such as Tos and Aviador Dro, formed in the late 1970s. However, this new counterculture clashed heavily with the Spanish national government, during a time when evening curfew for women, criminalisation of homosexuality, and arrests of people with unorthodox appearances for violating a law regarding &quot;dangerousness and social rehabilitation&quot; were frequent.

&quot;La Movida Madrileña&quot; gained notoriety following a large concert at the Higher Technical School of Civil Engineers (ETSICCP) at the Technical University of Madrid on February 9, 1980. Although Francoist elements continued to oppose the increasing liberalization of the city, the government under socialist mayor Enrique Tierno Galván had a more open approach regarding the movement, and subsidized various artistic endeavours. A number of influential foreign artists, such as The Ramones and Andy Warhol, visited Madrid during this time.

== Characteristics ==
&quot;La Movida Madrileña&#x27;s&quot; central component was an aesthetic influenced by punk rock and synth-pop music, as well as visual schools such as dada and futurism. The aesthetic permeated into the city&#x27;s street fashion, photography, cartoons, and murals, manifesting itself in bright colours, voluminous hair, unconventional and revealing clothing, and heavy makeup use among both genders.

In addition to these artistic representations, &quot;La Movida Madrileña&quot; also effected an emergent LGBTQ+ community, illicit drug use, and the use of the cheli dialect.

Although some people involved with the movement testified to a lack of a unified political ideology, many elements of the movement were antifascist and had anarchist leanings. It should be understood from an anti-systemic and nihilistic perspective, not because it was a political movement or committed to any cause.

==Representatives==

The &quot;Movida&quot; comprised many art movements; Pedro Almodóvar became a well-known example internationally after his success as a film director.

===Music===
In moods, looks and attitude, the sound resembled the British punk and new wave scenes and the Neue Deutsche Welle, sometimes (in the case of Mecano) mimicking styles such as New Romantic.

Music was a contributing factor in the Movida because it was a way to express oneself. People were allowed to listen to different types of music and two popular genres at that time were rock n&#x27; roll and synth pop. Music bands like Mecano and Alaska y los Pegamoides were two popular bands during that time. Songs like &quot;¿A quien le importa?&quot; (What&#x27;s it to you) and (Not you, not anyone) made people confident and gave them the ability to express themselves.

===Film and television===

Almodóvar comically reflected the messiness of the freedom of those years, particularly in his films &quot;Pepi, Luci, Bom y otras chicas del montón&quot;;  &quot;Laberinto de pasiones&quot;; and &quot;What Have I Done to Deserve this?&quot; (1984). TV programs like &quot;La Bola de Cristal&quot; and contributed to spread the aesthetics of the movement to a wider audience.

Pedro Almodóvar had a significant influence on the Movida with his films. He was a director who made films exploring homosexuality and criticised the church beliefs and Franqismo. He created his characters with complexity, challenging the traditional values of family, gender roles, and respect. Almodóvar&#x27;s goal was to make people question the environment they were living in. He wanted people to question the norms during this time and fight against continued normalization. He does this through techniques like comparing and contrasting traditional models versus the franquistas, and to continue questioning the idea that a certain sex are bound to act a certain way to be considered normal. A variety of films were created to represent the LGBTQ+ community; Almodóvar wanted to bring awareness to their situation and used the Movida as a way to explore different approaches from the conventional lifestyles of the time.

=== Photography and painting ===
During these years, young photographers like Alberto García-Alix and Ouka Leele focused their art on the bands, concerts, and music scene, while other creators, like Miguel Trillo, were more interested in the urban tribes around the new movement. Illustrator Ceesepe is considered a major figure in the movement.

After Ouka Leele overcame her health problems, at the age of 22 she had a turning point in her career called movida madrileña and was elected as a faithful representative of what was called &quot;posmodernidad&quot;. Her work fit perfectly with the eclectic spirit of the that artistic movement.

Ouka Leele&#x27;s work evolves and surprises many. The strong garnish colors of her first works began to soften; interior settings stopped being a constant in her work and she shifted her focus outdoors with her particular manner of portraying forests and plants. Her works are located halfway between painting and photography; they are abstract paintings where composition becomes as important as color. Color, being an integral element of her work, serves to enhance the representation of her art.

===Graffiti===
Juan Carlos Argüello was the artist behind his trademark signature Muelle. Argüello created a unique form of street art, later described as “&quot;graffiti autóctono madrileño&quot;” and it was a reference and inspiration for many creators after him.

Argüello was born in 1965, and was a pioneer in the street art movement in Madrid. He started out in the 1980s during the Movida Madrileña. Muelle began his career by creating his graffiti in the Campamento neighborhood of Madrid. One of his famous marks was his signature, which also had an arrow at the bottom. He claimed that his signature was protected by copyright. At first, the police thought that these signatures that were showing up all around the city was a code used by the drug traffickers or gang members, but in reality it was just enthusiastic Madrid youth creating copies of the signature. Eventually, Muelle started adding designs to make it more complex with colors, borders, and shadows. Many people started following Muelle&#x27;s work and made copies of it around the city of Madrid. No one else&#x27;s signature had ever become so famous or impactful as Muelle&#x27;s. He also started a punk rock band, &quot;Salida de Emergencia&quot; (“Emergency Exit”), in which he played the drums. In 1993, Argüello stopped appearing publicly in Madrid. In 1995 he died from cancer, but his influence continued to have an impact in Madrid. In 2004 he was honored with a ceremony and is still remembered fondly in Madrid. A book was published about him called &quot;Yo conocí a Muelle&quot; (I knew Muelle) by Jorge Gómez Soto. In 2012, one of his few signatures left was made into a special cultural interest spot known as &quot;Bien de Interés Cultura&quot;, where this graffiti cannot be removed. On October 19, 2016, Madrid dedicated a special garden to him in the neighborhood where he once lived.

===Literature===
Writers Gregorio Morales, Vicente Molina Foix, , Javier Barquín, , Luis Mateo Díez, , and were prominent in the &quot;Tertulia de Creadores&quot;, which were a cycle of meetings, lectures, debates and happenings that took place in the Círculo de Bellas Artes in Madrid between 1983 and 1984. Many of them, as Gregorio Morales, José Tono Martínez or Ramón Mayrata, were regular collaborators of the art magazine . Other publications, such as Oscar Mariné&#x27;s magazine (&quot;Madrid Kills Me&quot;) contributed to the creation of a common identity.

Another important figure outside the artistic world of the &quot;Movida&quot; was journalist Francisco Umbral, a writer for the newspaper &quot;El País&quot;, who wrote about and documented the movement.

===LGBTQ+===

People focused on gender-based and heteronormative blindness, neglecting the significance of gender, sexuality, or acknowledging them. Those who participated in La Movida all believed that one of their top priorities in undertaking La Movida was advocating for queer people. Cultural productions with queer undertones have been placed elsewhere and have a majority of heteronormative narratives in La Movida. Voices were offered through musical production to represent gender and sexuality associated with the queer community, and others that weren&#x27;t were overlooked during La Movida.

The movement was a time of enlightenment, where members of the LGBTQ+ community could be seen as normal human beings. It was a period where there was change in perspectives and the LGBTQ+ community could be freely open without any repression from the government or limitations from the church. La Movida emphasized liberty and the chance to open new opportunities for the gay community towards having equal rights. A neighborhood in Madrid named Chueca symbolizes the modernity, freedom, and openness beginning in this period. It is the home of the LGBTQ community and is a popular area of Madrid. They have a variety of events like alternative fashion centres and a host of opportunities for entertainment, in an anything-goes atmosphere. It also holds the gay pride festival between June and July. &quot;Crossing through Chueca&quot; is a book written about La Movida Madrileña, about the lesbian community and navigating their sexual, racial, gender, and class identities. Chueca is known for its queer-safe spaces and how they combat against discrimination, which played a big role during the La Movida Madrileña.

Post-La Movida Madrilena

Thirty years later, the Movida continues to exert influence on the people of Spain. This movement has been and continues to be embraced by institutions, showcasing a new and improved vision for both the city and the country as a whole. In 2007 there was an article from &quot;El País&quot; that acknowledges the return of La Movida, but it was known as La Removida. The term la Removida represented La Movida reappearing, and in its previous state. The reappearance was so significant that there were newspapers written about it.

La Removida is a way to preserve memories, allowing societies to undergo a continuous process of construction and reconstruction. This can be observed in cases like the events in Madrid: &quot;La Sombra de un Sueño&quot; seeks to reinforce the memory of La Movida and immortalize many of those who died during this period. The use of footage from La Movida serves as a way to showcase the rebirth of the movement. In order to preserve the legacy of La Movida, society needs a constant reminder because its memory fades over time, despite attempts to uphold its legacy.

The stories surrounding La Movida and La Removida underscore the ongoing quest for identity and significance through memory, providing evidence for the assertion that postmodern identity is inherently ambiguous. Therefore, the films unveil the idea that memory is zestful, undergoing constant transformation — a process that is likely to persist in the future for both La Movida and La Removida.

<text>Albert Houston Roberts (July 4, 1868 – June 25, 1946) was an American politician, educator, and jurist. He served as the 33rd governor of Tennessee from 1919 to 1921, having previously served as a state court judge and as principal of the Alpine Institute. He is best remembered for calling the special session of the Tennessee General Assembly that ratified the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote, in August 1920. Roberts&#x27; support for the amendment and his unpopular tax reform initiatives divided the state Democratic Party and doomed his reelection chances.

==Early life==
Roberts was born in the community of Alpine in Overton County, Tennessee, the son of John and Sarah (Carlock) Roberts. In 1881, his family moved to Columbus, Kansas. He returned to Tennessee in 1886, however, where he attended Hiwassee College in Madisonville, earning his B.A. in 1889. In 1891, he became principal of the Alpine Academy in his native Overton County. He changed the school&#x27;s name to &quot;Alpine Institute.&quot;

Roberts was admitted to the bar in 1894, and practiced law in the nearby county seat, Livingston. In 1910, he was elected Chancellor of the Fourth Judicial District, which covered fifteen Middle Tennessee counties. He served as an advisor to Benton McMillin&#x27;s unsuccessful 1912 gubernatorial campaign, and unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for governor in 1914, losing to Tom Rye.

==Governor==
In 1918, Roberts again sought the Democratic nomination for governor in hopes of succeeding Governor Rye, who was not running for reelection. His opponent for the nomination was former state legislator Austin Peay. Roberts gained the support of party bosses E. H. Crump, Hilary Howse, and &quot;Nashville Banner&quot; publisher E. B. Stahlman, and defeated Peay in the primary by 12,000 votes. In the general election, Roberts defeated Knoxville judge Hugh B. Lindsay, 98,628 (62%) votes to 59,518 (38%) (turnout is believed to have been influenced by that year&#x27;s flu epidemic).

Among Roberts&#x27; first orders of business was to certify the state&#x27;s ratification of the 18th Amendment, which implemented nationwide prohibition. The state senate had voted 28 to 2 in favor of ratification, and the state house had voted 82 to 2 in favor. Tennessee was the 23rd state to ratify the amendment.

When Roberts took office, Tennessee was struggling with mounting state debt and an outdated tax code that favored rural residents over urban residents. Roberts signed legislation that authorized the State Railroad Commission to collect taxes on utilities and railroads, and empowered it to conduct a reassessment of property values. He also implemented a &quot;sliding scale&quot; on taxable personal property, which reduced individual tax rates as the amount of overall tax collections increased. The new tax code angered farmers and many business leaders.

In 1919, strikes erupted at the Carter Shoe Company in Nashville and the Knoxville Railway and Light Company in Knoxville. Roberts dispatched state guardsmen to quell both strikes, and attempted to organize a state police force. He was assailed for these actions by the Tennessee Federation of Labor.

On June 7, 1919, Roberts performed the marriage ceremony for celebrated World War I Medal of Honor recipient Sergeant Alvin York and Gracie Williams in the Pall Mall community, in Fentress County.

Having alienated multiple constituencies within his own party, Roberts was challenged for the party&#x27;s nomination for governor in 1920 by former Chattanooga mayor William Riley Crabtree. Along with attacks from labor groups and farmers, Roberts was accused by &quot;Putnam County Herald&quot; editor E. L. Wirt of hiring a &quot;disreputable&quot; secretary. In spite of these attacks and the general unpopularity of his tax reforms, he defeated Crabtree 67,886 votes to 44,853 in the party&#x27;s August 5 primary.

On August 9, following his victory in the primaries, Roberts called a special session of the General Assembly to consider ratification of the 19th Amendment, which would give women the right to vote. The amendment required ratification in 36 states to become law, and by August 1920, 35 had ratified it, while eight had rejected it, and five (including Tennessee) had yet to vote. The state senate approved the amendment by a 25 to 4 margin, and it narrowly passed in the state house by a 50 to 46 vote. Angry anti-suffragists tried to file an injunction preventing Roberts from certifying the legislature&#x27;s vote, but the Tennessee Supreme Court ruled against them. Roberts certified the state&#x27;s ratification of the amendment on August 24, 1920.

Roberts&#x27; support of the 19th Amendment brought him praise nationally, but in Tennessee it merely alienated still more members of his own party. In the general election campaign, the Republican nominee, Alfred A. Taylor, ruthlessly attacked Roberts&#x27; tax reforms. Democrats attempted to stoke racial fears by criticizing Taylor for supporting the Lodge Bill (which would have provided protections for black voters) when he was in Congress. On election day, Taylor defeated Roberts by a vote of 229,143 (55%) to 185,890 (45%).

==Later life==
After his term as governor, Roberts practiced law in Nashville, initially in partnership with James W. Cooper (1921–1925), and afterward with his son, Albert H. Roberts Jr. (1925–1946), and Theodore Trimmier McCarley He died in Nashville on June 25, 1946, and is buried in the Good Hope Cemetery in Livingston.

==Family and legacy==
Roberts married Nora Dean Bowden in 1889. She taught music at the Alpine Institute, and her father, Bailey, taught Latin.

In 1909, Roberts convinced the Disciples of Christ Board of Missions to establish a mission school, Livingston Academy, in Livingston. This school still serves the Livingston area. The Alpine Institute&#x27;s high school remained in operation until 1947, when its students were transferred to Livingston Academy. In 1987, the Institute&#x27;s grade school was merged with several other grade schools to form A. H. Roberts Elementary School, which was named for Roberts. Several of the Alpine Institute&#x27;s buildings have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Albert H. Roberts Law Office, a small building constructed circa 1885 and rented by Roberts from 1900 to 1913, still stands on Main Street in Livingston. The building has been listed on the National Register and documented by the Historic American Buildings Survey.

<text>William Wyche Fowler Jr. (; born October 6, 1940) is an American attorney, politician, and diplomat. He is a member of the Democratic Party and served as a U.S. Senator from Georgia from 1987 to 1993. He had previously served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987.

==Early life and education==
Fowler was born in Atlanta, Georgia. He attended Davidson College, and then served in the United States Army as an intelligence officer. After discharge, he returned to school to earn a J.D. degree from Emory University School of Law.

== Career ==
From 1965 to 1966, he became the chief of staff for Congressman Charles Weltner, and after holding this post for two years, he resigned to become a private attorney. From 1974 to 1976, he served as president of the Atlanta City Council, and he used this position as a stepping stone to the House.

===U.S Congress===
On April5, 1977, Fowler was elected in a special election to the U.S. House of Representatives, to fill the vacancy caused by Andrew Young&#x27;s resignation upon appointment as US Ambassador to the United Nations. He defeated John Lewis in the election.

In 1986, as a U.S. Representative, Fowler narrowly defeated the incumbent Republican Senator Mack Mattingly. Fowler served as the junior senator from Georgia. Fowler&#x27;s voting record was liberal on social concerns and moderate on economic and national security issues.

On October 15, 1991, Fowler was one of eleven Democrats who voted to confirm the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the U.S. Supreme Court in a 52 to 48 vote, the narrowest margin of approval in more than a century.

He unexpectedly lost his re-election bid in 1992 to Georgia state Senator Paul Coverdell (who would later become leader of the state&#x27;s Republican party). Fowler won a small plurality of the vote against Coverdell on general election night 1992, but Georgia law requires a runoff election between the two candidates with the highest vote totals if no one candidate receives over 50 percent (a majority) of the total vote, and a Libertarian Party candidate received enough votes to keep Fowler&#x27;s total below 50 percent-plus-one. In the runoff on November 24, 1992, Coverdell upset Fowler by a narrow margin.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;he was the key figure in orchestrating a compromise on financing for the National Endowment for the Arts.&quot;

===Post-Congress===
After his re-election defeat, Fowler was selected to serve as the 22nd United States Ambassador to Saudi Arabia in the Clinton Administration. Ambassador Fowler was criticized in a congressional report following the 9/11 attacks for pressuring consular officers to issue visas in the Kingdom, although the report did not mention him in connection to any particular visa cases of the 9/11 hijackers. Fowler left after George W. Bush took office, and was succeeded by attorney Robert W. Jordan.

After leaving the position, Fowler joined the law firm of Powell, Goldstein, Frazer, and Murphy, and he joined several corporate and academic boards, including those of the Carter Center at Emory University and the Morehouse School of Medicine. He also became board chairman of the Middle East Institute and is a member of the ReFormers Caucus of Issue One.

==Personal life==
Fowler has been married at least twice. His second marriage in 1990 was to Donna Hulsizer, then the issues director for People for the American Way. He has a daughter and a son.

, Fowler lives in Georgia and West University Place, Texas, where he teaches part-time at Rice University.

<doc id="909556" wikidata="Q2822855" url="?curid=909556" title="Basel Accords">
<text>The Basel Accords refer to the banking supervision accords (recommendations on banking regulations) issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).

Basel I was developed through deliberations among central bankers from major countries. In 1988, the Basel Committee published a set of minimum capital requirements for banks. This is also known as the 1988 Basel Accord, and was enforced by law in the Group of Ten (G-10) countries in 1992. A new set of rules known as Basel II was developed and published in 2004 to supersede the Basel I accords. Basel III was a set of enhancements to in response to the financial crisis of 2007–2008. It does not supersede either Basel I or II but focuses on reforms to the Basel II framework to address specific issues, including related to the risk of a bank run.

The Basel Accords have been integrated into the consolidated Basel Framework, which comprises all of the current and forthcoming standards of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

==The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision==

Formerly, the Basel Committee consisted of representatives from central banks and regulatory authorities of the Group of Ten countries plus Luxembourg and Spain. Since 2009, all of the other G-20 major economies are represented, as well as some other major banking locales such as Hong Kong and Singapore.

The Committee does not have the authority to enforce recommendations, although most member countries as well as some other countries tend to implement the Committee&#x27;s policies. This means that recommendations are enforced through national (or EU-wide) laws and regulations, rather than as a result of the committee&#x27;s recommendations - thus some time may pass and, potentially, some unilateral changes may be made, between the international recommendations for minimum standards being agreed and implementation as law at the national level.

The regulatory standards published by the committee are commonly known as &quot;Basel Accords.&quot;They are called the Basel Accords as the BCBS maintains its at the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland and the committee normally meets there. The Basel Accords is a set of recommendations for regulations in the banking industry.

== Basel I: the Basel Capital Accord ==

Deliberations by central bankers from major countries resulted in the Basel Capital Accord, which was published in 1988 and covered capital requirements for credit risk. The Accord was enforced by law in the Group of Ten (G-10) countries in 1992.

The Basel Accord was augmented in 1996 with a framework for market risk, which included both a standardised approach and a modelled approach, the latter based on value at risk.

== Basel II: the new capital framework ==

Published in 2004, Basel II was a new capital framework to supersede the Basel I framework. It introduced &quot;three pillars&quot;:

# Minimum capital requirements, which sought to develop and expand the standardised rules set out in the 1988 Accord;
# Supervisory review of an institution&#x27;s capital adequacy and internal assessment process;
# Effective use of disclosure as a lever to strengthen market discipline and encourage sound banking practices.

Capital requirements for operational risk were introduced for the first time. The ratio of equity and credit is 8% under Basel II. The standards were revised several times during subsequent years.

Bank regulators in the United States took the position of requiring a bank to follow the set of rules (Basel I or Basel II) giving the more conservative approach for the bank. Because of this it was anticipated that only the few very largest US banks would operate under the Basel II rules, the others being regulated under the Basel I framework. However Basel II standards were criticised by some for allowing banks to take on too much risk with too little capital. This was considered part of the cause of the US subprime mortgage crisis, which started in 2008.

The Basel 2.5 revisions introduced stressed VaR and IRC for modelled market risk in 2009-10.

== Basel III: responding to the financial crisis ==

Following the financial crisis of 2007–2008, the Basel III reforms were published in 2010/11. The standards set new definitions of capital, higher capital ratio requirements, and a leverage ratio requirement as a &quot;back stop&quot; measure. Risk-based capital requirements (RWAs) for CVA risk and interest rate risk in the banking book were introduced for the first time, along with a large exposures framework, a revised securitisation framework, and a standardised approach to counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR) to measure exposure to derivative transactions. A specific framework for exposures to central counterparty clearing was introduced.

The BCBS also published regulatory standards for the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR); 

In subsequent years, the Basel Committee updated the standards for market risk, based on a “Fundamental Review of the Trading Book” (FRTB). In addition, further reforms of the framework were published by the Basel Committee in 2017 under the title Basel III: Finalising post-crisis reforms. These reforms were sometimes referred to as &quot;Basel IV&quot;. However, the secretary general of the Basel Committee said, in a 2016 speech, that he did not believe the changes are substantial enough to warrant that title and the Basel Committee refer to only three Basel Accords. These new standards came into effect on 1 January 2023, although national implementation of the standards is generally running behind this schedule and still ongoing. 

==Criticism==
The framework&#x27;s approach to risk which is based on risk weights derived from the past was criticised for failing to account for the uncertainty in the future. A recent OECD study suggest that bank regulation based on the Basel accords encourage unconventional business practices and contributed to or even reinforced adverse systemic shocks that materialised during the financial crisis. According to the study, capital regulation based on risk-weighted assets encourages innovation designed to circumvent regulatory requirements and shifts banks&#x27; focus away from their core economic functions. Tighter capital requirements based on risk-weighted assets, introduced in the Basel III, may further contribute to these skewed incentives. New liquidity regulation, notwithstanding its good intentions, is another likely candidate to increase bank incentives to exploit regulation.

In an October 24, 2020 speech at the Bund Financial Summit in Shanghai, Jack Ma described the Basel Accords as a &quot;club for the elderly.&quot;

<text>The IBM 729 Magnetic Tape Unit was IBM&#x27;s iconic tape mass storage system from the late 1950s through the mid-1960s. Part of the IBM 7-track family of tape units, it was used on late 700, most 7000 and many 1400 series computers. Like its predecessor, the IBM 727 and many successors, the 729 used magnetic tape up to long wound on reels up to diameter. To allow rapid tape acceleration (and thus reduced seek/access times), long vacuum columns were placed between the tape reels and the read/write heads to absorb sudden increases in tape tension which would otherwise break the tape. Write protection was provided by a removable plastic ring in the back of the tape reel.

==Data format==
The tape had seven parallel tracks, six for data and one to maintain parity. Tapes with character data (BCD) were recorded in even parity. Binary tapes used odd parity (709 manual, p. 20). Aluminum strips were glued several feet from the ends of the tape to serve as physical beginning and end of tape markers. Write protection was provided by a removable plastic ring in the back of the tape reel. A 3/4 inch gap between records allowed the mechanism enough time to stop the tape. Initial tape speed was 75 inches per second (2.95 m/s) and recording density was 200 characters per inch, giving a payload transfer speed of 90 kbit/s (105 kbit/s including parity bits). Later 729 models supported 556 and 800 characters/inch and 112.5 in/s (payload transfer rates up to 540 kbit/s; raw transfer rates up to 630 kbit/s). At 200 characters per inch, a single 2400-foot tape could store the equivalent of some 50,000 punched cards (about 4,000,000 six-bit bytes, a data quantity equivalent to three million octets).

The 729 series was superseded by 9-track tape drives introduced with the IBM System/360.

==Models==

===729 I===
The IBM 729 I was introduced for the IBM 709 and IBM 705 III computers, looked identical to the IBM 727, and used vacuum tubes. The main improvement was the use of a dual gap head permitting write verify.

===729 II===
The IBM 729 II was introduced for the IBM 7000 series computers, introducing a new cabinet style and transistorized circuitry. Supported dual density (200, 556).

===729 III===
High speed (112.5 in/s) single density (556).
===729 IV===
High speed (112.5 in/s) dual density (200, 556).

===729 V===
High density (800).

===729 VI===
High speed (112.6 in/s) high density (800). Introduced September 1961.

<text>The GE U25B is General Electric&#x27;s first independent entry into the United States domestic road switcher diesel-electric locomotive railroad market for heavy production road locomotives since 1936. From 1940 through 1953, GE participated in a design, production, and marketing consortium (Alco-GE) for diesel-electric locomotives with the American Locomotive Company. In 1956 the GE Universal Series of diesel locomotives was founded for the export market. The U25B was the first attempt at the domestic market since its termination of the consortium agreement with Alco.

==History==
The U25B (nicknamed &quot;U-Boat&quot;) is the first commercially successful domestic diesel electric road locomotive designed, built, and sold by General Electric after its split with the American Locomotive Company (Alco), a company dating back to the steam era. GE had developed internal combustion-electric generating, control, and drive systems in the early 1920s, which provided the foundation for the use of internal combustion engines in railroading. Early applications were in motorized railcars and switch engines. The 1930s saw that technology adapted to high speed mainline locomotives. In 1940 GE partnered with Alco, who by that time were well-established as a manufacturer of diesel switch engines and were introducing their first diesel road locomotives. They were successful in building locomotives for switching and short-haul applications, having introduced the first road-switcher design in 1941 (which would supplant the carbody design developed by the Electro-Motive Corporation by the mid-1950s) and gained a 26% market share as of 1946. Alco-GE&#x27;s efforts in main line road locomotives had not been successful at breaking into EMD&#x27;s dominant position in that market, although they introduced a successful gas turbine-electric locomotive to market in 1952. In 1953 GE went independent from Alco in locomotive production, with their new subsidiary GE Rail taking over the gas turbine-electric venture while they sought a supplier of more reliable diesel engines suitable for road locomotives. Production of Cooper-Bessemer powered Universal Series locomotives began in 1956 and some 400 export locomotives were sold before the U25B was offered in the United States. The U25B was announced by General Electric as a domestic model on April 26, 1960. It was the first locomotive powered by GE&#x27;s highly successful FDL-16 engine.

The U-Boat put GE on the road to becoming the top locomotive producer in the U.S., much to the chagrin of EMD. It introduced many innovations to the U.S. diesel locomotive market, including a pressurized car body and a centralized air processing system that provided filtered air to the engine and electrical cabinet, thus reducing maintenance. The U25B was also the highest-horsepower four-axle diesel road locomotive in the U.S. at the time of its introduction, its contemporaries being the GP20 (2,000 hp) and the RS27 ().

Though many were produced and sold, the only remaining U25B locomotives are in museums, as many were retired or scrapped at the end of their service life by the end of the 1980s.

== Rebuilds ==

=== M-K TE70-4S ===

Four Southern Pacific U25Bs were rebuilt by Morrison-Knudsen with a Sulzer V-12 prime mover. These locomotives, designated M-K TE70-4S, operated from 1978 to 1987. The experiment proved unsuccessful, and no additional units were rebuilt.

=== U25BE ===

Two Southern Pacific U25Bs were rebuilt by the Southern Pacific Transportation Company themselves at their own Sacramento Shops into GE U25BE locomotives. Only SP #3100 was preserved while SP 3101 was scrapped in 1987.

==Preservation==
Six U25Bs are known to be preserved today. Of these, only one remains in operating condition. Southern Pacific 3100 is now on permanent exhibit at the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Perris, California. Built in 1963, this locomotive was first numbered SP 7508. Later numbered SP 6800, it became a goodwill ambassador for the railroad in 1976 when it was painted in an elaborate red, white, and blue color scheme in celebration of the nation&#x27;s bicentennial; it was later renumbered and repainted in standard SP livery and was donated to the museum. The 3100 is fully certified to run on any of the nation&#x27;s railroads and is frequently used as motive power for offsite work trains.

Several more examples survive, all in varying states of preservation:
*Louisville and Nashville 1616 is stored at the Southern Appalachia Railway Museum in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The unit is missing its main generator.
*Milwaukee Road 5056 is preserved at the Illinois Railway Museum and is being both cosmetically and mechanically restored for operation on the museum grounds.
*Milwaukee Road 5057 is being cosmetically restored by Cascade Rail Foundation to eventually be displayed at the South Cle Elum Rail Yard in Washington.
*New Haven 2525 has been preserved by the Railroad Museum of New England/Naugatuck Railroad of Thomaston, CT. It wears its original New Haven colors, however it is not currently operational.
*New York Central 2500 is on display at the Lake Shore Railway Historical Society museum in North East, Pennsylvania.

== History ==
After World War II the was founded in 1950, by order of the minister of the interior Gustav Heinemann. The first president of the THW was , who had founded the THW&#x27;s predecessor, the , in 1919. The main purpose of the THW was civil defense in the event of war. This has changed over the decades; today the THW intervenes in a wide spectrum of disasters, such as traffic accidents, industrial disasters, or earthquakes.

The most important domestic operations in the 1960s were the North Sea storm flood in 1962 and the mining accident of Lengede in 1963.

The largest disaster control action took place in August 2002 after the flooding of the Elbe river in eastern Germany. About 24,000 THW members participated in the operation, with up to 10,000 people helping simultaneously along the Elbe and its tributaries.

The largest engagement outside Germany was in France in 2000, after storms Lothar and Martin blew down power lines and trees, blocking many streets, between 26 and 28 December 1999. The main contribution was supplying temporary electrical power for hospitals and other important institutions and rebuilding parts of the electrical system.

The organisation has also been active in many disaster relief operations abroad, for example in Thailand and Sri Lanka after the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, in the United States after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, in Pakistan after the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, in 2010 during the flooding in Poland, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the April 2015 Nepal earthquake, and the 2020 Beirut explosions.

In 2021, the THW provided relief during major flooding in southwestern Germany, particularly in the Ahr Valley.

In February 2023, THW personnel deployed to Turkey in the aftermath of the 2023 Turkey–Syria earthquake.

== Organization ==

As a federal authority which is part of the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the THW is headed by a president and board. Its headquarters () are in , together with the (BBK) (Federal Office for Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance).

The THW comprises 668 local chapters, 66 regional offices, eight state associations, and the THW administration in Bonn, which consists of the management staff, the commissioner of volunteers, and the Deployment Section with the units E1 mission, E2 foreign, E3 training, E4 logistics, and E5 technology, and the Central Services Section with the units Z1 volunteers and staff, Z2 organization, Z3 finance, Z4 security and health protection, and Z5 information and communication.

The THW logistics center has its office in Heiligenhaus, and is, via its attachment to the Logistics Unit E4, part of the THW administration.

== Field organization ==
=== Organization in Germany ===
The THW is stationed all over Germany in 668 local chapters, called (OV). Some 80,000 people are active in this organisation including about 15,000 young volunteers (members of the THW Youth). The majority of those are volunteers, while about 1,800 work full-time in its administration. Each local chapter () maintains one or more (technical platoons), each consisting of one (command squad), comprising four volunteers, one (rescue units) comprising nine to twelve volunteers, and one to three (technical units), comprising four to eighteen volunteers.

The main type of THW unit is one of two (1st and 2nd Rescue Groups), equipped with heavy tools like hydraulic cutting devices, chain saws, and pneumatic hammers. Their vehicles are the (GKW 1) (Equipment Truck 1) for the 1st Rescue Group and the (MzKW) (Multi-Purpose Truck) or the older (GKW 2) — which is scheduled to be phased out — for the 2nd Rescue Group.

The (Technical Units) include:
* Bridge Building ()
* Debris Clearance ()
* Demolition/Blasting ()
* Electricity Supply () 
* Emergency Supply and Maintenance, (, introduced 2019 as a replacement for the former technical unit &quot;Illumination&quot; and many &quot;2nd rescue units&quot;)
* Infrastructure ()
* Oil Pollution ()
* Search and Rescue ()
* Water Damage / Pumping ()
* Water Hazards ()
* Water Supply and Treatment ()
* Recovery ()
* Unmanned Aerial Systems ()

Furthermore, two types of technical units exist outside of technical platoons. They provide support mainly during major incidents or multi-regional operations:
* Logistics () 
* Command, Control and Communications ()

=== International deployment ===
For relief in foreign countries, there are four or &quot;SEEBA&quot; (Rapid Deployment Unit Search and Rescue Abroad) units according to INSARAG standards, able to go airborne within six hours, and three or &quot;SEEWA&quot; (Rapid Deployment Unit Water Supply and Treatment Abroad) units.

The Schlauchschwinger also operates high capacity pumping (HCP) modules for the EU Civil Protection Mechanism.

Furthermore, the THW has a pool of experts which can be rapidly deployed to places of crisis to perform assessment and coordination tasks within the fields of technical and logistical support. Those experts are also active in capacity building operations.

== Personnel ==

In Germany, military service was mandatory for adult males until 2011. Instead of joining the military for a shorter period full-time, one of the alternatives was to join a non-combatant volunteer organisation within the German (disaster relief) or (civil defense) for a minimum of four years (this is calculated so that although serving far less time every week, in the end the number of served hours was about the same). The THW was one of those organisations. Others were too, such as volunteer fire brigades and various organisations engaged in emergency medical service; however, the THW relied more heavily on such quasi-conscripts, as it tends to have less local popularity than, e. g., volunteer fire brigades (who tend to be the chief social club of their respective village or town-quarter), and as it had less of an infrastructure of paid employees than, for instance, the German Red Cross.

The THW has its own decoration for meritorious service or exemplary achievements in the field of emergency management or civil protection: All three classes of the are approved by the president of Germany.
=== Ranks ===
In general, the rank structure of the THW is divided into two groups: the volunteers and the full-time employees.

The (THW Youth) is the youth organization of the THW. It has set itself the target to introduce boys and girls from the age of six in a playful way to the work of the THWs. The is not part of the Federal Agency for Technical Relief, but is an independently registered charity. This arrangement was made in order to avoid maintaining a state youth organization.

<text>Love and Anarchy () is a 1973 political comedy-drama film written and directed by Lina Wertmüller and starring Giancarlo Giannini and Mariangela Melato.

Set in Fascist Italy in the early 1930s, the film follows Tunin (Giannini), an anarchist farmer who stays in a brothel in Rome while preparing to assassinate Benito Mussolini with assistance from Salomè (Melato), a prostitute and fellow anarchist. However, his mission is complicated when he becomes romantically involved with Tripolina (Lina Polito), another prostitute at the brothel. The film explores the depths of his emotions concerning love, his hate for fascism, and his fears of being killed while assassinating Mussolini.

At the 1973 Cannes Film Festival, &quot;Love and Anarchy&quot; was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or and Giannini was awarded Best Actor.

==Plot==
In 1932, after witnessing the murder of his anarchist friend at the hands of the Fascist police for plotting to assassinate Benito Mussolini, Antonio &quot;Tunin&quot; Soffiantini, a peasant farmer from northern Italy, resolves to carry out his friend&#x27;s mission. After training in marksmanship in Paris with the anarchist underground, he travels to Rome and settles into Madame Aida&#x27;s brothel while posing as the cousin of one of the prostitutes, Salomè, who is his secret political contact. Salomè explains to Tunin that she seeks to avenge the lynching of her anarchist lover, Anteo Zamboni, who was framed for an attempt on Mussolini&#x27;s life in Bologna.

Salomè arranges for her, Tunin and Tripolina, a younger prostitute at the brothel, to spend the day with the head of Mussolini&#x27;s secret police, Giacinto Spatoletti, from whom she has been extracting vital information for the past three months, so they can learn Spatoletti&#x27;s upcoming security arrangements. The four of them go to the countryside near Rome where the assassination will take place in a few days&#x27; time. Salomè keeps Spatoletti busy while Tunin surveys the area and devises a plan. After striking up a conversation, Tunin and Tripolina develop feelings for one another and subsequently sleep together.

Back in Rome that night, Salomè and Tripolina return to the brothel while Spatoletti takes Tunin to the Piazza del Campidoglio, where the two men drink as Spatoletti expresses his admiration for Mussolini and his disdain for socialists and anarchists. When Spatoletti makes crude remarks about Tripolina, Tunin admonishes him and runs towards the brothel, yelling Tripolina&#x27;s name, but the madams throw him out.

The next day, Tunin reveals his assassination plot to Tripolina and asks her to spend the next two days with him, as he fears they may be his last, leaving her devastated. When an important client dies suddenly at the brothel, Madame Aida, hoping to avoid a scandal, assigns Tunin to discreetly dump the client&#x27;s corpse in the Roman Forum, which he does with help from Salomè. In exchange, Madame Aida allows Tripolina to spend the next two days with Tunin.

On the morning of the planned assassination, Tripolina refuses to awaken Tunin, fearing he will die, which leads to a heated argument with Salomè, who insists that he execute the plan, but the two eventually agree to protect him. Tunin awakens and, realising he is late, angrily accuses both women of betrayal. When the police conduct a routine patrol at the brothel, an increasingly paranoid Tunin confesses his intention to kill Mussolini and opens fire on the police, killing a few officers. He then tries to shoot himself but has run out of bullets. While attempting to escape, he is apprehended outside the brothel as Salomè, Tripolina and the other prostitutes watch in horror.

Tunin is subjected to torture and interrogation by Spatoletti, but refuses to speak. He is subsequently beaten to death by Fascist officers in his jail cell. The police report describes his death as an &quot;unidentified madman&#x27;s&quot; suicide.

==Cast==

==Production notes==
Giancarlo Giannini starred in three other films Wertmuller made during this period: &quot;The Seduction of Mimi&quot;, &quot;Swept Away&quot;, and &quot;Seven Beauties&quot;.

==English version==
For the initial American release, editor Fima Noveck created a prologue which featured a montage of photos of Mussolini, along with a crawl explaining his rise to power and the violent activities sanctioned in his name during his reign. Also, in this edit, the full Italian title is not displayed, in favor of the abbreviated English title &quot;Love and Anarchy&quot;.

<text>The GE U28B diesel-electric locomotive model replaced the U25B in early 1966, featuring a slightly uprated prime mover (only more power than the U25B). Early units had the same car body styling as the U25B, while later units had design features (e.g., shortened nose) more in common with later models. After only a year of production, this model was superseded by the U30B.

Trains Magazine editor David P. Morgan wrote about General Electric&#x27;s decision to go with 2800 horsepower in its 1966 locomotive production. The short article Morgan wrote in the November 1965 issue had line drawings of the proposed short nose U28B.

<text>The Warren Anatomical Museum, housed within Harvard Medical School&#x27;s Countway Library of Medicine, was founded in 1847 by Harvard professor John Collins Warren, whose personal collection of 160 unusual and instructive anatomical and pathological specimens now forms the nucleus of the museum&#x27;s 15,000-item collection. The Warren also has objects significant to medical history, such as the inhaler used during the first public demonstration of ether-assisted surgery in 1846 (on loan to the Massachusetts General Hospital since 1948), and the skull of Phineas Gage, who survived a large iron bar being driven through his brain. The museum&#x27;s first curator was J.B.S. Jackson.

==Early 2020s closure==
The museum gallery was closed for renovation through winter/spring 2023, as stated on the museum&#x27;s website, although the collection remains accessible to researchers by appointment. Normally a rotating subset of items, including Gage&#x27;s skull and the tamping iron that passed through it, is on public display.

<doc id="909602" wikidata="Q1662473" url="?curid=909602" title="Information Commissioner's Office">
<text>The Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office (ICO) is a non-departmental public body which reports directly to the Parliament of the United Kingdom and is sponsored by the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology. It is the independent regulatory office (national data protection authority) dealing with the Data Protection Act 2018 and the General Data Protection Regulation, the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003 across the UK; and the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and, to a limited extent, in Scotland. When they audit an organisation they use Symbiant&#x27;s audit software.

The Information Commissioner is in the process of being replaced by the Information Commission by Clause 143 of the Data Protection and Digital Information Bill (once enacted).

==Role of the Information Commissioner==

The Information Commissioner is an independent official appointed by the Crown. The Commissioner&#x27;s decisions are subject to appeal to an independent tribunal and the courts. The Commissioner&#x27;s mission is to &quot;uphold information rights in the public interest, promoting openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals&quot;.

The role of Information Commissioner is currently held by John Edwards, who succeeded Elizabeth Denham on 3 January 2022.

===John Edwards===
On 26 August 2021, John Edwards was named as the new Information Commissioner, replacing Elizabeth Denham. The UK government said he would &quot;go beyond the regulator&#x27;s traditional role&quot; and that the job would now be &quot;balanced&quot; between protecting rights and promoting &quot;innovation and economic growth&quot;. It also said that protection for privacy should be done &quot;in as light a touch way as possible&quot;, that it would prioritise allowing personal data to be sent internationally to places such as the United States, Korea, Singapore, Dubai and Colombia, among others, that it wanted a data policy that delivered a &quot;Brexit dividend&quot; for businesses (c.f. individuals alone) and that it wanted to get rid of &quot;endless&quot; cookie popups. Promoting economic growth is not one of the ICO&#x27;s functions recognised at law and as such this new role creates the potential for conflict with its statutory functions, set out for example in section 115 of the Data Protection Act 2018 and the UK GDPR, and/or the risk that it may potentially take actions which are ultra vires. Since promoting economic growth has not previously been one of its roles (it was announced on 26 August 2021 that it is something that the job would &quot;now&quot; involve and it is not set out in statute), then logically, promoting economic growth is to come at the expense of the protection of rights, since that protection has not previously been balanced with it. , the ICO&#x27;s website states that it is &quot;The UK&#x27;s independent authority set up to uphold information rights in the public interest, promoting openness by public bodies and data privacy for individuals&quot;.

===Elizabeth Denham===
Since Elizabeth Denham was appointed Britain&#x27;s Information Commissioner in 2016, the ICO has undertaken high-profile investigations into Equifax, Yahoo, Talk Talk, Uber, and Facebook; issuing the maximum fine under the Data Protection Act 1998 of £500,000 to Facebook, for breaches of data protection law. Denham has also overseen the conclusion of the ICO&#x27;s investigation into charities&#x27; fundraising activities and a series of fines for companies behind nuisance marketing.

Elizabeth Denham welcomed the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that came into effect in May 2018, as well as the Data Protection Act 2018.

In October 2018 she was elected chair of the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners (ICDPPC), the leading global forum of data protection and privacy authorities, encompassing more than 120 members across all continents that works throughout the year on global data protection policy issues.

===Christopher Graham===
During his time as Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham was noted for gaining new powers to issue monetary penalties to those who breach the Data Protection Act 1998. He has also welcomed new powers to issue monetary penalties under the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations, as well as raising concerns over harm and distress caused by nuisance call to the public. Christopher Graham succeeded Richard Thomas in 2009. 

===Richard Thomas===
During Richard Thomas&#x27; tenure as Commissioner, the ICO was particularly noted for raising serious concerns over the Government&#x27;s proposed British national identity card and database, as well as other similar databases such as the Citizen Information Project, Universal Child Database, and the NHS National Programme for IT, stating that the country is in danger of sleepwalking into a surveillance society, drawing attention to the misuse of such information by the former states of the Eastern bloc and Francisco Franco&#x27;s Spain.

===Data Protection Act 2018===

The Data Protection Act 2018 received royal assent on 23 May 2018. It updates data protection laws in the UK, supplementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), implementing the EU law enforcement directive, and extending data protection laws to areas not covered by the GDPR. The new Act aims to modernise data protection laws to ensure they are effective in the years to come.

The data protection charge on UK data controllers to support the Act is under the Data Protection (Charges and Information) Regulations 2018. Exemptions from the charge were left broadly the same as for the previous Act: largely some businesses and non-profits internal core purposes (staff or members, marketing and accounting), household affairs, some public purposes, and non-automated processing.
The register of fee payers, which excludes those data controllers that are exempt from paying a fee, is publicly available and searchable at the website of the ICO, which also gives links to the ICO&#x27;s counterparts around Europe.

====Data Protection Act 1998====

The United Kingdom as a member of the European Union was, and as a former member still is, subject to a strict regime of data protection. The Data Protection Act 1984 created the post then named &quot;Data Protection Registrar&quot; with whom people processing personal data had to register the fact of their processing of that data on the register of data controllers. Under the provisions of EC Directive 95/46 (introduced in the UK as the Data Protection Act 1998, rather than as an SI under the European Communities Act 1972), the name of the post was changed to &quot;Data Protection Commissioner&quot; and later to &quot;Information Commissioner&quot;.

===General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)===
The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a new, Europe-wide law that replaces the Data Protection Act 1998 in the UK. The GDPR came into force on 25 May 2018 and sets out requirements for how organisations need to handle personal data. It forms part of the data protection regime in the UK, together with the new Data Protection Act 2018 (DPA 2018). Following the UK&#x27;s departure from the EU on 31 January 2020, the GDPR continues to be part of British domestic law by virtue of section 3 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

===Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004===
In 2005 the Commissioner&#x27;s role was expanded to include enforcement of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 and Environmental Information Regulations 2004 and the name of the position was changed from Data Protection Commissioner to Information Commissioner (&#x27;IC&#x27;). Enforcement of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002, which applies to devolved public authorities in Scotland, is the responsibility of the Scottish Information Commissioner, a separate public official, as the British Act does not apply to these authorities.

The ICO issues guidance on Freedom of Information legislation, which is being updated in accordance with its strategic plan 2019/20 - 2021/22, &quot;Openness by Design&quot;.

===Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (EC Directive) 2003 (PECR)===
In November 2011 the ICO was given the powers to impose monetary penalties of up to £500,000 for breaches of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR). PECR applies to organisations that wish to send marketing messages through electronic means i.e. phone, fax, email, text; use cookies or provide electronic communication services to the general public. As with the GDPR, these regulations continue to apply following Brexit.

====Nuisance calls====
In March 2013, commenting on a fine of £90,000 imposed on Cumbernauld fitted kitchen company DM Design for nuisance marketing calls, the Information Commissioner said that &quot;this fine will not be an isolated penalty. We know other companies are showing a similar disregard for the law and we&#x27;ve every intention of taking further enforcement action against companies that continue to bombard people with unlawful marketing texts and calls.&quot; In 2014, the Government changed the law to &quot;lower the legal threshold for consumer harm&quot;. This made it easier for the ICO to &quot;take enforcement action against more organisations breaching the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR)&quot;.

In October 2018 the ICO fined two companies a total of £250,000 that made nearly 1.73 million direct marketing phone calls to people registered with the Telephone Preference Service (TPS). In December 2018, the Commissioner welcomed the new law that means the ICO can now hold company bosses directly responsible and has the power to fine them personally for breaches of the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR).

===Environmental Information Regulations 2004===
The Information Commissioner is also responsible for appeals made under the Environmental Information Regulations 2004.

==Enforcement==
Prior to 2010 the enforcement powers were limited to issuing enforcement notices and to pursuing those alleged to have broken the Data Protection Act 1998 through the courts. In 2010 The Information Commissioner was granted the power to issue fines, known as monetary penalties, by its own authority, granted in April 2010. The first such were served on 24 November 2010. From 2010, the ICO were also given the powers to serve Assessment Notices, which can be issued to organisations who are unwilling to work alongside the ICO and are at risk of breaking the principles of the Data Protection Act 1998. During the Leveson Inquiry in 2012 it came to light that the ICO had felt unable to challenge the press related to allegations of breaches due to the power of the press and perceived weakness of its own powers.

From 25 May 2018 the ICO were granted new enforcement powers under the new data protection laws, including the ability to fine organisations €20 million (or equivalent in sterling) or 4% of the total annual worldwide turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, for breaching data protection laws.

==Investigations==
===Operation Motorman===
In 2002, under &#x27;Operation Motorman&#x27;, the ICO under Richard Thomas raided various newspaper and private investigators&#x27; offices, looking for details of personal information kept on unregistered computer databases. The operation uncovered numerous invoices addressed to newspapers and magazines, which detailed prices for providing the journalists with personal information, with 305 journalists being identified as having been the recipients of a wide range of information.

In 2006, a request under the Freedom of Information Act led to the publication of a report to the British Parliament called &quot;What Price Privacy Now?&quot;. The newspaper with the highest number of requests was the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; with 952 transactions by 58 journalists; the &quot;News of the World&quot; came fifth in the table, with 182 transactions from 19 journalists. The &quot;Daily Mail&quot; immediately issued a press release, in which it rejected the accusations within the report. Editor Paul Dacre said that Associated Newspapers only used private investigators to confirm public information, such as dates of birth.

In a July 2011 appearance in front of a parliamentary committee, a day after former News International CEO Rebekah Brooks had been arrested and bailed in light of the News International phone hacking scandal, Dacre told them that he had never &quot;countenanced&quot; phone hacking or blagging at his newspaper, as both acts were clearly &quot;criminal&quot;.

===Consulting Association===
On 23 February 2009, the Droitwich office of the Consulting Association (TCA) was raided by the ICO, which served an enforcement notice against TCA under the terms of the Data Protection Act. The ICO action followed a 28 June 2008 article about alleged blacklisting in the construction industry, by journalist Phil Chamberlain, published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;.

===Sony===
In 2013, the Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office fined Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Ltd. £250,000, when many PlayStation systems were hacked and the names, addresses, phone numbers and card details of users were stolen. The ICO found that Sony had excessive information about their users and inadequate security systems in place.

===Facial recognition use by Amazon and Facebook===
May 2018 saw the increased scrutiny of both Facebook and Amazon with regards to reports of the use of biometric personal data without the consent of the subjects.

===Cambridge Analytica and Facebook===
On 23 March 2018, the ICO searched the London headquarters of Cambridge Analytica amid reports that the firm harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users as part of a campaign to influence the U.S. 2016 presidential elections.

In October 2018 the ICO issued a fine of £500,000, the maximum allowable under the laws which applied at the time the incidents occurred, to Facebook, for breaches of data protection law. The ICO&#x27;s investigation found that between 2007 and 2014, Facebook processed the personal information of users unfairly by allowing application developers (specifically, Aleksandr Kogan and his company GSR as clients of SCL Ltd and Cambridge Analytica) access to their information without sufficiently clear and informed consent, and allowing access even if users had not downloaded the app, but were simply &#x27;friends&#x27; with people who had.

===Uber===
In November 2018 the ICO fined Uber £385,000 for failing to protect customers&#x27; personal information during a cyber-attack. A series of avoidable data security flaws allowed the personal details of around 2.7 million British customers to be accessed and downloaded by attackers from a cloud-based storage system operated by Uber&#x27;s US parent company.

===Equifax===
In September 2018, the ICO issued Equifax Ltd with a £500,000 fine for failing to protect the personal information of up to 15 million British citizens during a cyber-attack in 2017. The incident, which happened between 13 May and 30 July 2017 in the US, affected 146 million customers globally.

=== TikTok ===
In February 2019, the ICO launched an investigation of the video-sharing platform and mobile application TikTok, following the fine its parent company ByteDance received from the United States&#x27; Federal Trade Commission, for collecting information from minors under the age of 13 in violation of the country&#x27;s Children&#x27;s Online Privacy Protection Act. Speaking to a parliamentary committee, Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham said that the investigation focuses on the same issue of private data collection, as well as the kind of videos collected and shared by children online, as well as the platform&#x27;s open messaging system which allows any adult to message any child. She noted that the company was potentially violating provisions in the GDPR which &quot;requires the company to provide different services and different protections for children&quot;.

===Interserve===
In October 2022, Interserve was fined £4.4 million for a breach of data protection law in May 2020 which enabled hackers to access data on up to 113,000 Interserve employees. While a phishing email had been detected, the ICO said Interserve &quot;failed to thoroughly investigate the suspicious activity&quot;. As a result, the attacker compromised 283 systems and 16 accounts, uninstalled the company&#x27;s anti-virus solution, and encrypted the personal data of current and former employees. Interserve disputed that its staff and its response had been complacent. It said it had also sought to reduce risks in systems supporting ongoing operations at Tilbury Douglas and in Mitie Group. The fine was the fourth-largest ever demanded by the ICO.

<text>Progressive Christianity, formerly known as The Center for Progressive Christianity (TCPC), was founded in 1996 by, retired Episcopal priest, James Rowe Adams in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It is established in line with the larger progressive movement. The organization is an ecumenical network of affiliated , informal groups, and individuals.

==Members==
One of the organization&#x27;s goals involves creating a very broad tent. Its fourth point invites: &quot;...all people to participate in our community and worship life without insisting that they become like us in order to be acceptable (including but not limited to): believers and agnostics, conventional Christians and questioning skeptics, women and men, those of all sexual orientations and gender identities, those of all races and cultures, those of all classes and abilities, those who hope for a better world and those who have lost hope.&quot; Most affiliates generally view religious belief as a process or journey—a searching for truth rather than establishing truth. Liberal Christians or post-Christians who stress justice and tolerance above creeds may also be attracted to the movement. The Center for Progressive Christianity has also during its growth with the progressive Christian movement in the United States inspired an offshoot in the British Progressive Christianity Network.

Progressive Christianity&#x27;s website gives an analogy that symbolizes the methodology of the Progressive Christianity movement. It involves a Sunday school teacher and a class of 9 or 10-year-olds. Even at that age, some were skeptical of the inerrancy of the Bible. The teacher suggested that they read Charlotte&#x27;s Web instead. The class enjoyed the book. The teacher interjected the thought that pigs and spiders cannot talk. The kids protested: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s a story.&quot; The teacher asked whether the story was true. They decided that it was sort of true. &quot;In a way, it was true.&quot; So the teacher suggested: &quot;let&#x27;s look at the Bible in the same way.&quot;

For the movement&#x27;s founder, James Rowe Adams, &quot;such open-ended and searching conversations are at the heart of what it means to be religious. They are the very thing he hopes to foster through the work of his small, but visionary organization. Education is at the core of the Center’s work, but it is a vision of education that calls for open-ended conversation, the use of scholarship and intellectual gifts, as well as personal experience and emotion.&quot;

==Criticism==
More conservative Christian organizations and movements have singled out Progressive Christianity for criticism on theological grounds. Other criticism is politically focused coming from members of the Christian right who disagree with socially liberal aspects of the organization&#x27;s political stances. Albert Mohler president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary has said of Progressive Christianity, &quot;Christians should see The Center for Progressive Christianity, not as posing a threat to Christianity itself, but as exposing the basic hatred of biblical truth that drives those on the theological left.&quot;

<text>Alfred Thomas Archimedes Torbert (July 1, 1833 – August 29, 1880) was a career United States Army officer, a Union Army General commanding both infantry and cavalry forces in the American Civil War, and a U.S. diplomat.

==Early life==


Torbert was born in Georgetown, Delaware. He graduated 21st in a class of 34 from the United States Military Academy in 1855 and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 2nd U.S. Infantry Regiment. His West Point roommate was William B. Hazen.

==Civil War==
Just before the start of the Civil War, Torbert was appointed a first lieutenant in the Confederate States Army on March 16, 1861, but he refused the appointment and remained a lieutenant in the U.S. Army. By September 16, he was appointed colonel of the 1st New Jersey Infantry and, by August 29, 1862, he was a brigade commander in the VI Corps of the Army of the Potomac. In the Maryland Campaign of 1862, he was wounded at Crampton&#x27;s Gap in the Battle of South Mountain. He was promoted to brigadier general on November 29, 1862. Torbert commanded his New Jersey brigade in the campaigns leading to the Battle of Fredericksburg, the Battle of Chancellorsville, and the Battle of Gettysburg.

On April 10, 1864, Torbert was given command the 1st Division of the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac, following the death of Maj. Gen. John Buford. Torbert commanded during the Overland Campaign, except when ill following the Battle of Spotsylvania Courthouse. During Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan&#x27;s Valley Campaigns of 1864, Torbert was the Chief of the Cavalry for the Army of the Shenandoah and led the cavalry at important battles such as the Battle of Third Winchester and the Battle of Cedar Creek. Torbert&#x27;s final campaign as cavalry chief in the Army of the Shenandoah was during a raid against the Virginia Central Railroad near Gordonsville, Virginia, also called the Luray Raid, from December 19 to 28, 1864. The campaign was plagued by intense cold, rain, snow, and hail, and hundreds of Torbert&#x27;s men suffered from frostbite. Following this failed raid, Torbert went on extended leave through February 1865.

Following the Gordonsville raid, Torbert never again held Sheridan&#x27;s confidence as a combat commander, and in late March, Torbert was ordered to remain in the Shenandoah Valley when Sheridan returned to Petersburg, Virginia. Torbert commanded the vestigial Army of the Shenandoah from April 22 to July 12, 1865, with his headquarters in Winchester, Virginia. Wesley Merritt commanded Torbert&#x27;s former corps under Sheridan, which included two divisions, and would lead this command during the Appomattox campaign.

Torbert received brevet promotions in the regular army for his service at Gettysburg, Haw&#x27;s Shop, Third Winchester, and Cedar Creek. Notably, Torbert was never promoted to the full rank of major general in the volunteers, even though he commanded a successful and prominent corps of cavalry at many important battles, suggesting that Sheridan was disappointed in Torbert&#x27;s personal leadership during this time, despite any successes. From July through September 1865, Torbert commanded the District of Winchester, Virginia.

He later commanded the District of Southeastern Virginia, with his headquarters at Norfolk, Virginia from September through December 1865. He was mustered out of the volunteer service in January 1866 and placed on a leave of absence until October 31, 1866, when he resigned from the Army.

==Postbellum career==
After the war, Torbert served in a number of diplomatic posts: as U.S. Consul to El Salvador in 1869, U.S. Consul General in Havana in 1871, and U.S. Consul General in Paris in 1873.

On August 29, 1880, while en route to Mexico aboard the steamship &quot;Vera Cruz&quot;, Torbert was washed off the deck during a violent hurricane off the coast of Florida near Cape Canaveral. Accounts of his death indicate he had made it to shore alive, over 20 hours after the ship sank, but drowned in the surf shortly thereafter. His body was recovered August 31, 1880 and buried in Daytona the next day. By September 23, he was disinterred and taken first to New York City, then to Philadelphia and then to his final resting place in the Avenue Methodist Episcopal Cemetery, Milford, Delaware, escorted by military units along the way. Memorial services were held in each of those three cities where, with hundreds attending, he was honored by officials from the U.S. government, military, and dignitaries from foreign countries.

==In memoriam==
In 2008, a statue honoring General Torbert was erected in Milford.

<doc id="909610" wikidata="Q5486913" url="?curid=909610" title="Frank Gorrell">
<text>Frank Cheatham Gorrell (June 20, 1927 – March 12, 1994) was an American politician who served as the 47th Lieutenant Governor of Tennessee from 1967 to 1971, during Governor Buford Ellington&#x27;s second term.

== Early years ==
Gorrell was born in Russellville, Kentucky, and attended college and played college football at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. After college he attended law school at Vanderbilt, then joined the Nashville law firm of Bass, Berry &amp; Sims.

== Career ==
In 1947, while a student at Vanderbilt, he married Bette Jamison, which connected him to the powerful Middle Tennessee Jamison family, whose interests included a mattress factory near downtown Franklin, Tennessee. In 1964, Governor Frank G. Clement decided that he desired Gorrell to be lieutenant governor to replace the outgoing James L. Bomar Jr. The Tennessee General Assembly had begun to show a measure of independence from the executive branch of government in this era but was generally still largely subject to it. However, a faction of the Democratic Caucus in the Tennessee State Senate, which in Tennessee elects the lieutenant governor from its own members, had decided to resist the selection of Gorrell. They were joined by the relatively small Republican Caucus, which proposed the election of former lieutenant governor Jared Maddux, who had previously served as lieutenant governor during Clement&#x27;s first administration.

A &quot;nose count&quot; revealed a total of sixteen Senators supporting Clement&#x27;s selection of Gorrell, and sixteen supporting Maddux. The remaining member, Senator Charles O&#x27;Brien of Crossville, was in seclusion and could not be reached by either side. Clement, sensing victory, sent his sister Anna Belle, who also served as his chief of staff, to visit O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s home and persuade him to support Gorrell. Exactly what occurred is unknown, but while O&#x27;Brien voted for Maddux, who was returned to office, Anna Belle Clement married Senator O&#x27;Brien, later serving in the Senate herself as Anna Belle Clement O&#x27;Brien, while Senator O&#x27;Brien later went on to serve as Chief Justice of the Tennessee Supreme Court. Gorrell&#x27;s turn was to come two years later.

Gorrell was regarded as being both pro-business and somewhat progressive. After leaving state government he became a lobbyist and was regarded as the most influential lobbyist in the state at the time of his death.

== Death ==
Gorrell died in March 1994 as a result of a choking incident at a restaurant in Brentwood, Tennessee.

<doc id="909615" wikidata="Q5029420" url="?curid=909615" title="Canada Research Chair">
<text>Canada Research Chair (CRC) is a title given to certain Canadian university research professors by the Canada Research Chairs Program.

== Program goals ==
The Canada Research Chair program was established in 2000 as a part of the Government of Canada wanting to promote research and development excellence in Canadian post-secondary educational institutions. Through the Canada Research Chair program, $300 million is spent annually to attract and retain outstanding scholars and scientists.

The program hopes to help chairholders achieve research excellence in natural sciences, engineering, health sciences, humanities, and social sciences, improve Canada&#x27;s depth of knowledge and quality of life, strengthen the country&#x27;s international competitiveness, and train personnel through student supervision, teaching, and the coordination of other researchers&#x27; work.

== Types of chairs ==
There are two types of Canada Research Chair:
*Tier 1 Chairs – tenable for seven years and renewable once (and twice in exceptional circumstances), are for outstanding researchers acknowledged by their peers as world leaders in their fields. Nominees for Tier 1 positions are full professors or associate professors who are expected to be promoted to the full professor level within one or two years of the nomination (or, if coming from outside the academic sector, nominees must possess the necessary qualifications to be appointed at these levels by the nominating university). For each Tier 1 Chair, the university receives $200,000 annually for seven years.
*Tier 2 Chairs – tenable for five years and renewable once, are for exceptional emerging researchers, acknowledged by their peers as having the potential to lead in their field. Nominees for Tier 2 positions are assistant or associate professors (or they possess the necessary qualifications to be appointed at these levels by the nominating university). For each Tier 2 Chair, the university receives $100,000 annually for five years.

The money received for each chair can be used to add to the chair&#x27;s salary, to help pay for the chair&#x27;s existing salary, or to fund research; the proportion allocated to each category varies by university.

== Chair allocations ==
The number of CRCs allocated to a university is proportional to the amount of research grant funding that university has received in the three years prior to the year of the allocation. Grant funding must originate from the three federal granting agencies (NSERC, CIHR, and SSHRC).

Of the total 2000 Chairs, 1880 are regular allocations, distributed as follows:
* 733 Chairs (39 per cent) for research in natural sciences and engineering;
* 733 Chairs (39 per cent) for research in health sciences;
* 414 Chairs (22 per cent) for research in social sciences and humanities.

The program sets aside a special allocation of 120 Chairs for universities that have received one per cent or less of the total funding paid out by the three federal granting agencies over the preceding three years.

Roughly 66% of Chairs are allocated to member institutions of the U15, a group of the top research-intensive universities in Canada.

===List of Canada Research Chairs===

The Canada Research Chairs Program maintains an online database of profiles of each chairholder, which include detailed descriptions of each of their research projects.

===Canada Research Chairs insignia===
On March 27, 2008, the Government of Canada&#x27;s Ministry of Industry, as well as the presidents of the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada, the Canada Foundation for Innovation, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research presented each chairholder with a Canada Research Chair insignia at a national celebration of the program held at the Université du Québec en Outaouais in Gatineau, Quebec. The lapel pin, made of sterling silver, symbolizes the pursuit of knowledge and research excellence and is available exclusively to chairholders. As of November 2007, there are 1,851 Canada Research Chairs. Seventy Canadian universities are participating in the program.

<doc id="909623" wikidata="Q1530288" url="?curid=909623" title="Mexican Mafia">
<text>The Mexican Mafia (Spanish: &quot;Mafia Mexicana&quot;), also known as La eMe (Spanish for &quot;the M&quot;), is a predominantly Mexican American prison gang and criminal organization in the United States. Despite its name, the Mexican Mafia has no origins in Mexico and is entirely a U.S. prison-based organization. Law enforcement officials report that the Mexican Mafia is the deadliest and most powerful gang within the California prison system.

Government officials state that there are currently 350–500 official members of the Mexican Mafia with thousands of hitmen and associates within prison and an estimate of more than 50,000 loyal foot soldiers who also carry out its illegal activities on the streets in the hopes of becoming full members. The Mexican Mafia has immense influence and control over every Hispanic street gang in Southern California, including the notoriously brutal MS-13 and 18th Street Gang, since in the prison system inmates are recruited into gangs based on race regardless of street gang affiliation. The U.S. Government considers the Mexican Mafia to be &quot;among the most powerful, dangerous and feared criminal organizations in the world&quot;.

==History==
The Mexican Mafia was formed in 1957 by thirteen Hispanic street gang members from different Los Angeles neighborhoods who were incarcerated at the Deuel Vocational Institution, a California Youth Authority facility, which is now an adult state prison in Tracy, California. The founding members formed the gang in order to protect Hispanic inmates from other prison gangs. One of the founders of La eMe is Luis &quot;Huero Buff&quot; Flores, who was an active member of the Barrio Hawaiian Gardens gang in Hawaiian Gardens, California. Gang warfare between Hispanic neighborhoods was the norm during the 1950s and 60s, so the fact that Luis Flores was able to get established enemies to set aside their rivalry upon entry into the prison system was something that was not thought possible. This requirement exists to the present day. Hispanic street gangs like White Fence, The Avenues, Clanton 14, Hawaiian Gardens, Varrio Nuevo Estrada, and Primera Flats, were already into their second decade and firmly established as self-sustaining entities.
Luis Flores initially recruited violent members to the gang in an attempt to create a highly feared organization which could control the black market activities of the Deuel prison facilities. La eMe member Ramon &quot;Mundo&quot; Mendoza claims that in the beginning the overall goal was to terrorize the prison system and enjoy prison comforts while doing time. It is said that the name &quot;Mexican Mafia&quot; was to show organization similar to the American Mafia but it was later changed so as not to be confused with it. Furthermore, the black hand symbol was a reference to the Black Hand of the early 20th century.

===Rise===
By 1961, violence got so bad at the Deuel Vocational Institution that administrators transferred a number of the charter La eMe members to San Quentin Penitentiary in the hopes of discouraging their violent behavior. This tactic failed. Cheyenne Cadena arrived on the lower yard of San Quentin and was met by a six-foot-five, 300-pound black inmate who kissed him. Cadena returned a short time later, walked up to the unsuspecting predator, and stabbed him to death with a jailhouse knife, or shiv. Despite there being more than a thousand inmates on the yard, no witnesses stepped forward.

A string of other slayings soon followed as Mexican Mafia members sought to establish a reputation among the inmates of San Quentin. The Mexican Mafia&#x27;s quest for complete control alienated many other Mexican-American inmates who were fed up with Mexican Mafia stabbing, killing, and stealing their watches, rings, cigarettes and anything else of value. Some of them secretly founded a new prison gang called Nuestra Familia (NF) or &quot;Our Family.&quot; It was first established in the mid-1960s at the California Correctional Training Facility in Soledad. Some of the early members were from the Los Angeles area, but NF soon drew inmates primarily from rural communities in Northern California. The Mexican Mafia saw Nuestra Familia as inferior and &quot;just a bunch of farmers&quot;, or &quot;farmeros&quot;. However, in 1968 at San Quentin, a full-scale riot broke out after a Mexican Mafia soldier, or &quot;soldado&quot;, stole a pair of shoes from a Nuestra Familia sympathizer. Nineteen inmates were stabbed and one La eMe associate ended up dead. The battle became known as the &quot;Shoe War&quot; and it established Nuestra Familia as the major La eMe rival.

The Mexican Mafia gained significant power and control over illegal activities in the California prison system by using violence. The gang also extended its influence outside the prison system when members who were released from custody began taking control of narcotics distribution in parts of Southern California, primarily by &quot;taxing&quot; drug dealers.

===New Mexican Mafia===

La eMe should not be confused with the New Mexican Mafia. Around 1974, a group of Hispanic inmates at Arizona State Prison, Florence, formed a prison gang known as the Mexican Mafia. Arizona Department of Corrections officials at that time obtained information that this group patterned themselves after the California Mexican Mafia which had been in existence for several years. Several Hispanics who came into the Arizona Prison System brought the concept and philosophy of the California Mexican Mafia. In 1978 the Mexican Mafia split into two organizations. One kept the original philosophy and structure and currently refer to themselves as the Original Mexican Mafia, &quot;Califas Faction&quot;, &quot;EME&quot;. The other, which came into prominence in 1984 and refer to themselves as the New Mexican Mafia. Many assaults and murders of members of both groups have occurred as a result of each organization claiming the title of &quot;Mexican Mafia&quot; within the Arizona prison system. They have created their own rules and regulations and have established an organizational structure. Each member is allowed to vote on issues regarding membership and leadership. The leader, approved by the members, has the power to solely decide important issues.

==Culture==

Law enforcement believes that &quot;La eMe&quot; presently is not presided over by a single leader. Many Mexican Mafia members have the authority to order murders and oversee various other criminal activities. They have almost a thousand associates that help carry out those orders and have the theoretical control of all Sureño gang members. Members are expected to engage in tests of their loyalty to &quot;La eMe&quot;, which may include theft or murder. The penalty for refusing orders or failing to complete an assigned task is often death. According to the gang&#x27;s constitution, members may also be punished or murdered if they commit any of four major infractions. These include becoming an informant, acts of homosexuality, acts of cowardice, and showing disrespect against fellow gang members. According to gang policy, a member of the Mexican Mafia may not be murdered without prior approval by a vote of three members, yet the murder of non-members requires no formal approval.

During the early 1960s at San Quentin Prison, Luis &quot;Huero Buff&quot; Flores and Rudy &quot;Cheyenne&quot; Cadena established a blood oath for members of the Mexican Mafia. Prior to the establishment of the oath, members of the Mexican Mafia were allowed to return to their street gangs after incarceration. The new oath stipulated that the only way for a member to leave the Mexican Mafia was to be killed. Flores and Cadena also established a set of gang commandments. These included policies such as: a new member must be sponsored by an existing member, unanimous approval from all existing members to join (no longer policy), prioritizing the gang over one&#x27;s family, denial of the existence of the Mexican Mafia to law enforcement or non-members, respect of other members, and forgiving street conflicts which existed before incarceration. Execution of a member of the gang for policy violation must be committed by the gang member who sponsored him. &quot;La eMe&quot; has a blood-in, blood-out policy: murder or drawing of blood is a prerequisite for membership and anyone trying to get out will be killed.

===Rules===

# A member may not be an informant.
# A member may not be a coward.
The rules of conduct are:
# A member may not raise a hand against another member without approval from the higher-ups and leaders.
# A member must not show disrespect for any member&#x27;s family, including sex with another member&#x27;s wife, or girlfriend.
# A member must not steal from another member.
# A member may not be homosexual, sex offender, child killer, child molester, or rapist.
# A member must not politic against another member or cause dissension within the organization.
# Membership is for life, the only way out is death.
# Retaliation must be carried out if anyone crosses &quot;La eMe&quot;, no exceptions.
# Vendetta must be carried out, even if it takes months, years, or decades.
# If a member of &quot;La eMe&quot; gets harmed or killed by someone else such as police, or another criminal gang, retaliation must be immediate, and must be swift, brutal and deadly.
# It is mandatory to assault/kill all dropouts and traitors.
# &quot;La eMe&quot; comes first. Even before your own family, religion and god.
# A member must not interfere with another member&#x27;s business activities.
# A member must never harm children.
# A member must always treat another member&#x27;s family with respect and kindness.
# A member must protect another member from harm.
# A member must treat another member like a brother.

===Allies and rivals===
The Mexican Mafia is the controlling organization for almost every Hispanic gang in Southern California, and some gangs located in Central and Northern California, with their vassal gangs being called Sureños. Members of almost all Hispanic gangs in Southern California are obliged under the threat of death to carry out any and all orders from made Mexican Mafia members. The Mexican Mafia also holds a loose alliance with the Aryan Brotherhood, mainly due to their common rivals within the prison system.

The primary rivals of the Mexican Mafia are Nuestra Familia. The Mexican Mafia is also a rival of the Black Guerrilla Family prison gang, which holds a loose alliance with La Nuestra Familia. Bloods and Crips are the new enemies.

===Symbols===
Mexican Mafia symbols include images of a black hand. The gang&#x27;s primary symbol, which is often used in tattoos by members, is the national symbol of Mexico (eagle and a snake) atop a flaming circle over crossed knives. Street gangs that are aligned with the Mexican Mafia often use the number 13 as a gang identifier, as the letter &quot;M&quot; is the 13th letter of the modern Latin-derived alphabet.

==Criminal activities==
According to the FBI, the Mexican Mafia had arranged for contract killings to be carried out by the Aryan Brotherhood, a white prison gang. The Mexican Mafia and the Aryan Brotherhood are mutual enemies of the Norteños and the African-American gangs Black Guerrilla Family and D.C. Blacks. Even though homosexuals are barred from entry into &quot;La eMe&quot;, they are engaged heavily in homosexual prostitution in the prison system. Many of the street level homicides in the Highland Park area of Los Angeles committed by the Avenues gang were done on orders issued by the Mexican Mafia.

The Mexican Mafia is involved in a variety of criminal activities both inside and outside the prison system, but its main source of income is extorting drug distributors outside prison and distributing various narcotics within and outside the prison system. In 1992, an example of &quot;La eMe&quot;&#x27;s influence and power over Sureños was made clear to law enforcement. Joe &quot;Pegleg&quot; Morgan, a prominent Mexican Mafia leader, ordered that no more drive-by shootings and violence were to take place by Sureños. Between April, when the edict was announced, and September 1992 there were no drive-by shootings in East Los Angeles, an area that was notorious for violence and drive-bys.

===1950s===
In 1957, Gregory Huerta Valenzuela and Augustin Acosta, two Mexican Mafia associates and members of the White Fence gang, shot and killed grocer Jose Castellanos during a robbery in East Los Angeles. On May 13, 1958, while standing trial for Castellanos&#x27; murder at the Hall of Justice, Valenzuela and Acosta managed to stab Los Angeles County Sheriff&#x27;s Department (LASD) sergeant Ned Lovretovich with sharpened spoons after Lovretovich had given testimony against the pair. Valenzuela and Acosta were convicted of first-degree murder in the death of Castellanos and sentenced to life in state prison. They also pled guilty to assault with intent to commit murder and injury to a county employee for the stabbing of Lovretovich and were given sentences to run concurrently with their life terms.

The first murder of a prison guard by &quot;La eMe&quot; was carried out by Doroteo &quot;Sleepy&quot; Betancourt and Frank &quot;Moose&quot; Bazure at San Quentin State Prison in June 1958.

===1970s===
The first murder outside of prison that was ordered by &quot;La eMe&quot; occurred in 1971 when Mexican Mafia member Alfonso &quot;Pachie&quot; Alvarez was found shot twice in the head in a secluded area of Monterey Park. His offense: collecting taxes on narcotics dealers without kicking up the profits to &quot;eMe&quot; leaders behind bars, known in the gang as &quot;Big Homies&quot; or &quot;Emero&quot;s. The person responsible for the murder was Joe &quot;Pegleg&quot; Morgan—the notorious white godfather of &quot;La eMe&quot; who had ascended by then to become one of the highest-ranking bosses of the entire organization, even with no &quot;official&quot; Mexican blood himself. His connections with cocaine and heroin suppliers in Mexico helped pave the foundation for the Mexican Mafia&#x27;s narcotics distribution throughout California. During the 1970s, while under the control of Morgan&#x27;s protégé Rodolfo Cadena, the Mexican Mafia often took control over various community groups. The gang was able to filter money from alcohol and drug prevention programs to finance their criminal activities.

The Mexican Mafia and the Italian-American Los Angeles crime family collaborated in skimming money from Get Going, a taxpayer-funded drug treatment program. By 1977, Get Going founder Ellen Delia was determined to expose the infiltration of her beloved program. Shortly before an appointment with the California State Secretary of Health and Welfare Services, Delia was murdered. Her collection of evidence on Italian and Mexican Mafia infiltration of the Get Going program was never recovered.

===1980s===
On October 14, 1984, Alfred Arthur &quot;Chato&quot; Sandoval, a high ranking &quot;eMe&quot; member and Arizona Maravilla gangster, shot and killed Gilbert Martinez and Anthony Aceves during a gang-related fight in Belvedere Park, East Los Angeles; a third victim, Manuel Torres, survived the attack. The victims were members of the Mariana Marivilla gang. Around two weeks later, on October 31, 1984, Ray and Marlene Wells were also shot execution-style in their home in Baldwin Park. Sandoval killed Ray Wells because he believed the man had told police of the whereabouts of the car he used in the Belvedere Park murders; Marlene Wells was then killed because she had witnessed the murder of her husband. Sandoval was convicted on four counts of first-degree murder in Los Angeles County Superior Court and was sentenced to death for the murder of Marlene Wells, and to life in prison without the possibility of parole for the murders of Martinez, Aceves and Ray Wells. On November 6, 2000, Sandoval had his death sentence for the murder of Marlene Wells overturned by the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals but remained imprisoned for life without parole.

Two Mexican Mafiosi, the brothers Hector and Ronaldo Ayala, along with a third man, bound and then killed three others — Ernesto &quot;Chacho&quot; Mendez Dominguez, Marco Zamora-Villa, and Jose Luis &quot;Cucuy&quot; Rositas — by shooting them execution-style at the A &amp; Z Auto Repair shop in the Logan Heights neighborhood of Southeast San Diego after demanding $10,000 from the men, who were allegedly involved in the heroin trade, on April 26, 1985. A fourth shooting victim, Pedro &quot;Pete&quot; Castillo, survived and identified the Ayala brothers as the killers. Ronaldo Ayala was convicted of three counts of first-degree murder, attempted murder, robbery, and attempted robbery, on October 12, 1988, and sentenced to be executed in the gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison, on February 9, 1989. Hector Ayala, who stood trial separately, was convicted on the same charges, on August 1, 1989 and also sentenced to death, on November 17, 1989. The third defendant, Joseph Moreno, was acquitted of all charges.

===1990s===
On July 16, 1991, Mexican Mafia members Benjamin &quot;Topo&quot; Peters and Rene &quot;Boxer&quot; Enriquez stabbed another &quot;eMe&quot; member, Salvador &quot;Mon&quot; Buenrostro, at the Los Angeles County Jail. Buenrostro, who survived the attack despite being stabbed 26 times, was targeted because he had sided against Joe &quot;Pegleg&quot; Morgan in internal gang affairs.

Mexican Mafia member Charles &quot;Charlie Brown&quot; Manriquez was targeted for death by the gang when he was accused of cowardice after failing to carry out a prearranged stabbing on another inmate at the Chino State Prison in 1991. Manriquez was fatally shot to death by &quot;La eMe&quot; hitman David &quot;Smilon&quot; Gallardo in the Ramona Gardens housing project in the Boyle Heights neighborhood of Los Angeles, on March 25, 1992.

In 1998, United States federal authorities indicted 22 members and associates of the Mexican Mafia, charged under the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act with crimes which included extortion, murder, and kidnapping. One of the arrested members, Benjamin &quot;Topo&quot; Peters (Arizona Maravilla), was allegedly the Mexican Mafia&#x27;s highest-ranking member at the time, and was engaged in a power struggle with fellow member Ruben &quot;Tupi&quot; Hernandez (Onterio Varrio Sur – Ontario, California). Another indicted member was accused of having plotted the death of an anti-gang activist who served as a consultant for the film &quot;American Me&quot;. The indictments marked a two-year investigation by federal, local, and state law enforcement officials.

===2000s===
Mike &quot;Acha&quot; Ison, a Mexican Mafia leader described by &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; writer Julian Guthrie as &quot;a small man with a giant reputation who had survived 30 years in California&#x27;s toughest prisons&quot;, was beaten to death by three or four people armed with pool cues after he was involved in a bar fight at Grady&#x27;s Bar in the Mission District of San Francisco, on March 25, 2001.

In 2006, a 36-count federal indictment was brought against members of the Mexican Mafia. The arrests were made for alleged acts of violence, drug dealing, and extortion against smaller Latino street gangs. According to the federal indictment, Mexican Mafia members exert their influence in both federal and state prison systems through either violence or the threat of violence. Members and associates of the gang remain fiercely loyal to the criminal organization both in and outside of prison, particularly in Southern California cities such as Los Angeles and San Diego. The gang asserts its influence over Chicano gangs throughout Southern California by threatening violence against their members should they ever become incarcerated. Gangs and drug dealers who refuse to pay a protection &quot;tax&quot; to the Mexican Mafia are often murdered or threatened with murder. High-ranking members of the Mexican Mafia who are locked in private cells for 23 hours of each day are still able to communicate with their associates, through methods which range from tapping in code on prison plumbing pipes to smuggled letters. The primary goal of the Mexican Mafia is to control all drug trafficking in all areas that they have been established.

===2010s===
In early 2012 there was a federal indictment of 119 San Diego County gang members, including a Mexican Mafia boss that was arrested in a raid of his San Marcos home, which portrays a sprawling, well-organized criminal network that ran drug dealing on the streets of North County and even extended inside the Vista jail. Rudy &quot;Crazy&quot; Espudo (Esco Varrio Diablos – Escondido, California) was in control of the Hispanic gangs in the area and forced drug dealers to pay taxes in tribute to La eMe or face the consequences. The local gangs were smuggling narcotics into the Vista Detention Center in order to sell them for the Mexican Mafia. On North County streets, &quot;La eMe&quot; ordered Surenos to obtain taxes from the local drug dealers. Members of the Azusa 13 gang, associated with the Mexican Mafia, were indicted in 2011 for harassing and intimidating black people in Southern California.

===2020s===
On January 31, 2022, a fight broke out between members of the Mexican Mafia and MS-13 at United States Penitentiary, Beaumont, Texas, causing two fatalities and leading to all U.S. federal prisons being placed on lockdown due to fears of retaliatory attacks.

A joint investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) into the Westside Wilmas gang in the Los Angeles Harbor Region commenced in October 2022 and culminated with the arrests of 12 Mexican Mafia members and the seizure of 23 firearms, 57.7 pounds of methamphetamine, approximately 23,000 fentanyl pills, 5.2 pounds of powdered fentanyl and 2.2 pounds of cocaine as search warrants were executed in the South Bay and as far as Bakersfield, on May 17, 2023.

==In popular culture==
The Mexican Mafia received mainstream notoriety after being featured in the 1992 movie &quot;American Me&quot;. The film was co-produced, directed and starred in by actor Edward James Olmos, who allegedly received death threats by members of the Mexican Mafia for what they considered an unflattering depiction of the gang. Two consultants for the film were murdered shortly after the film&#x27;s release, though it is unclear whether the murders were tied to the Mexican Mafia or to recent layoffs that had provoked death threats. The Mexican Mafia was allegedly displeased with the portrayal of the murder of Rodolfo Cadena (who was the basis for Olmos&#x27; character Santana) as being committed by his fellow gang members. Mexican Mafia members were also allegedly offended by the portrayal of a homosexual rape committed by Puppet, a Mexican Mafia character in the film who in the latter part of the movie murders his own brother, Li&#x27;l Puppet, for disrespecting &quot;La eMe&quot;. Olmos subsequently applied for a concealed handgun permit, which was denied.
While serving a life sentence for murder at Pelican Bay State Prison, Joe &quot;Pegleg&quot; Morgan, filed a $500,000 lawsuit against Olmos, Universal Studios, and other producers of the film. Morgan claimed that one of the principal characters in the film was based on him without obtaining his permission.

The 1993 film &quot;Blood In Blood Out&quot; is loosely based on the Mexican Mafia, although the story is fictional. The protagonist Miklo Velka is largely based on Joe &quot;Pegleg&quot; Morgan, being white and having lost his leg from getting shot during a robbery (one of the rumored ways that Morgan lost his). The prison gangs named in the film are in turn inspired by real-life counterparts: La Onda (Mexican Mafia), Black Guerilla Army (Black Guerilla Family), and Aryan Vanguard (Aryan Brotherhood).

<doc id="909624" wikidata="Q1453421" url="?curid=909624" title="AFI (2004 album)">
<text>AFI is an album by the American rock band AFI, compiling tracks from their releases on Nitro Records between 1996 and 2001, before the band signed to DreamWorks Records and achieved mainstream success. Released on November 2, 2004, the compilation peaked at #88 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The compilation focuses on the band&#x27;s hardcore punk sound during this era.

The album&#x27;s tracks are presented in reverse chronological order from their Nitro Records release dates, beginning with material from &quot;The Art of Drowning&quot; (2001) and proceeding through the &quot;All Hallow&#x27;s E.P.&quot; (1999), &quot;Black Sails in the Sunset&quot; (1999), &quot;Shut Your Mouth and Open Your Eyes&quot; (1997), &quot;Very Proud of Ya&quot; (1996), and &quot;Answer That and Stay Fashionable&quot; (originally released in 1995 on Wingnut Records, re-released by Nitro in 1997). It includes the &quot;Art of Drowning&quot; B-side &quot;A Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot;, previously released on &quot;The Days of the Phoenix E.P.&quot; (2001), as well as three tracks previously exclusive to the LP releases of the band&#x27;s albums: &quot;Lower It&quot; is from the LP release of &quot;Black Sails in the Sunset&quot;, while &quot;Rolling Balls&quot; and &quot;Who Said You Could Touch Me?&quot; are from the LP release of &quot;Very Proud of Ya&quot;.

== Background ==
The album is the last major Nitro Records release of AFI material recorded before their DreamWorks Records debut, Sing the Sorrow. According to Discogs, the album was &quot;Allegedly released by Nitro Records without AFI&#x27;s permission&quot;. A month before its release, the band posted on their official message board:While we&#x27;re really proud of our history and accomplishments we feel our career is really just getting started and feel slightly embarrassed by anything that hints at retrospect. There&#x27;s plenty of time for that later when we&#x27;re old. We&#x27;d rather move forward...

== Track listing ==
== Reception ==

According to a PunkNews.org review, the album is &quot;Purely intended as a proper introduction to fans first associated with AFI from their 2003 major label debut full-length, &quot;Sing the Sorrow&quot;&quot; which functions as &quot;a nice sampler of material ... of the band&#x27;s back catalog.&quot;

<text>Red Kola is a carbonated soft drink made from fruit extracts, and may include flavouring from the kola nut. Red Kola is made by various firms including Currie&#x27;s (operated by Dunns Food &amp; Drinks Ltd), Solripe, and A.G. Barr.

Despite the name, it bears no resemblance to more traditional cola drinks in either flavour or appearance. It is bright red in colour and has a unique taste, significantly sharper than cola and with a strong fruit base.

== Ingredients ==

Currie&#x27;s Red Kola: carbonated water, sugar, tartaric acid, flavourings, preservative (sodium benzoate), sweeteners (sodium saccharin, aspartame), colours (E163, E100).

Barr Red Kola: carbonated water, sugar, citric acid, flavouring, concentrates (black carrot, safflower), sweeteners (sucralose, acesulfame K), preservative (sodium benzoate).

<doc id="909631" wikidata="Q1259750" url="?curid=909631" title="Jet set">
<text>The jet set is a social group of wealthy and fashionable people who travel the world to participate in social activities unavailable to ordinary people. The term was introduced in 1949 and replaced &quot;café society&quot;; it reflected a style of life involving travelling from one stylish or exotic place to another via jet plane. With the democratization of air travel it has been replaced at least in part by the term &quot;glitterati&quot;, reflecting a greater emphasis upon celebrity, including &quot;being seen&quot; and stalked by &quot;paparazzi&quot;, and less upon mode of travel.

The term &quot;jet set&quot; is attributed to Igor Cassini, a reporter for the &quot;New York Journal-American&quot; who wrote a gossip column under the pen name &quot;Cholly Knickerbocker&quot;. He was a younger brother of the fashion designer Oleg Cassini. Another term that developed during the era was &quot;Beautiful People&quot;, a period equivalent to today&#x27;s concept of &quot;glitterati&quot; being &quot;supermodels, celebrities and socialites&quot;, where looks, youth, and attractive activities predominated over wealth and high social standing.

Jet passenger service in the 1950s was marketed primarily to the upper class, but its introduction eventually resulted in a substantial democratization of air travel. Although the term &quot;jet set&quot; can still be found in common parlance, its literal meaning of those who travel by jet is no longer applicable as such.

== History ==

The British international air carrier BOAC inaugurated the world&#x27;s first commercial scheduled jet service on 2 May 1952, using the de Havilland Comet, followed by the introduction of the Comet 4 in 1958 after a series of accidents in 1953–1954. The first successful service, from October 1958, was the typical &quot;jet set&quot; route, London–New York City. Pan Am followed suit with the Boeing 707, making its first scheduled flight between New York City and Paris on 26 October 1958.

Other cities on the standard jet set routes were Honolulu, Mexico City, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Rio de Janeiro, Athens, Madrid, Paris, Rome, Vienna, Bangkok, Hong Kong, Manila, Punta del Este and Tokyo. Jet set resorts in places like Acapulco and Nassau, where Huntington Hartford&#x27;s new Paradise Island opened in 1962, were taking the place of Bermuda. Meanwhile, Cannes, Capri, St. Tropez, Portofino, and other sea-side towns on the French and Italian Riviera were on the jet set itinerary. Greek Islands such as Mykonos were included in the loop around 1974. Later on other hot spots such as Spain&#x27;s Marbella on its Costa del Sol also developed a similar reputation.

The original members of this elite, free-wheeling set were those socialites who were not shy about publicity and entertained in semi-public places like restaurants and in night clubs, where paparazzi—a jet set phenomenon—photographed them. They were the first generation that might spend a weekend in Paris or fly to Rome just for a party. The jet set was celebrated in popular culture, for example, Federico Fellini captured their lifestyle in &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; (1960), and many movies and record albums of the era promoted flying to foreign lands for honeymoons and getaways, such as Capitol Records &quot;Honeymoon in Rome&quot; (1956).

The term was joined in the spring of 1962 by &quot;Vogue&quot; coinage of the term &quot;the Beautiful People&quot;. This expression initially referred to the circle that formed around President John F. Kennedy and First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy. Readers of the 15 February 1964 &quot;Vogue&quot; could learn &quot;What the beautiful people are doing to keep fit.&quot; The two phrases ran for a time in tandem; in 1970, author and social commentator Cleveland Amory could fear &quot;that the Beautiful People and the Jet Set are being threatened by current economics.&quot;

A sign that &quot;jet set&quot; had passed from urbane use was the 1974 country song &quot;(We&#x27;re Not) The Jet Set&quot;, in which George Jones and Tammy Wynette claim they are &quot;the old Chevrolet set,&quot; as opposed to leading a glamorous, &quot;jet-setting&quot; lifestyle.

In 1976, the jet set first flew on the supersonic Concorde. Scheduled flights began on 21 January 1976 on the London–Bahrain oil executive route and the distinctly jet-set Paris–Rio de Janeiro (via Dakar) route. From November 1977 the Concorde was flying between standard jet-set destinations, London or Paris to New York City; passenger lists on initial flights were gossip-column material. The Concorde restored the term&#x27;s cachet: &quot;From rock stars to royalty, the Concorde was the way to travel for the jet set,&quot; according to the &quot;Nova&quot; retrospective special &quot;Supersonic Dream&quot;. However, the Concorde was doomed by its sonic boom, limited global fly-over rights because of the boom, its huge thirst for jet fuel, and a disastrous crash. The aircraft was retired in 2003. Meanwhile, the Boeing 747, densely packed with some 400 passengers, was a craft that accelerated the democratizing social changes already brought about by the jet age.

<text>Antônio Francisco Lisboa ( or 1738 – 18 November 1814), better known as Aleijadinho (, ), was a sculptor, carver and architect of Colonial Brazil, noted for his works on and in various churches of Brazil. With a style related to Baroque and Rococo, Aleijadinho is considered almost by consensus as the greatest exponent of colonial art in Brazil by Brazilian critics and, surpassing Brazilian borders, for some foreign scholars he is the greatest name of Baroque in the Americas.

Little is known with certainty about his biography, which remains shrouded in legend and controversy to this day, making the research work on his life very arduous. The main documentary source on Aleijadinho is a biographical note written only about forty years after his death. His trajectory is reconstructed mainly through the works he left behind, although even in this context his contribution is controversial, since the attribution of authorship for most of the more than four hundred creations that exist today associated with his name was made without any documentary evidence, based only on stylistic similarity with documented pieces.

All of his work, including carvings, architectural projects, reliefs and statuary, was carried out in Minas Gerais, especially in the cities of Ouro Preto, Sabará, São João del-Rei and Congonhas. The main monuments that contain his works are the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi in Ouro Preto and the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus of Matosinhos.

==Biography==
Little is known about the life of Antônio Francisco Lisboa. Practically all the data available today are derived from a biography written in 1858 by Rodrigo José Ferreira Bretas, 44 years after Aleijadinho&#x27;s death, allegedly based on documents and testimonies of individuals who had known the artist personally. However, recent criticism has tended to consider this biography largely fanciful, part of a process of magnification and dramatization of his personality and work, in a romanticized manipulation of his figure whose aim was to elevate him to the status of an icon of Brazilianness, a mix of hero and artist, a &quot;singular genius, sacred and consecrated&quot;, as Roger Chartier described it. Bretas&#x27; account, however, cannot be completely discarded, since being the oldest substantial biographical note on Aleijadinho, most of the later biographies were based on it, but the information it brings needs to be seen with some skepticism, being difficult to distinguish what is fact from what has been distorted by popular tradition and by the writer&#x27;s interpretations. Biographies and critical studies carried out by Brazilian modernists in the first half of the 20th century also made biased interpretations of his life and work, increasing the amount of stereotypes around him, which are still perpetuated today in the popular imagination and in part of the critics, and are explored both by official cultural instances and by tourism agencies in the cities where he left his production.

The first official news about Aleijadinho appeared in 1790 in a memorandum written by captain Joaquim José da Silva, complying with the royal order of 20 July 1782, which determined that notable events, of which there was certain news, that had occurred since the foundation be recorded in an official book of the Captaincy of Minas Gerais. The memorandum, written while Aleijadinho was still alive, contained a description of the artist&#x27;s most notable works and some biographical indications, and was partly based on it that Bretas wrote &quot;Traços biográficos relativos ao finado Antônio Francisco Lisboa, distinto escultor mineiro, mais conhecido pelo apelido de Aleijadinho&quot;, where he reproduced excerpts from the original document, which was later lost.

===Early years===
Antônio Francisco Lisboa was the son of a respected Portuguese master builder and architect, , and his African slave, Isabel. In the baptismal certificate, cited by Bretas, it appears that Antônio, born a slave, was baptized on 29 August 1730, in what was then the town of Vila Rica (currently Ouro Preto) in the parish of Nossa Senhora da Conceição de Antônio Dias, with Antônio dos Reis as his godparent and being manumitted on the occasion by his father. The birth certificate does not contain the child&#x27;s date of birth, which may have occurred a few days earlier. However, there are strong arguments that currently lead to considering it more likely that he was born in 1738, as his death certificate states the date of his death as 18 November 1814, adding that the artist was then 76 years old. The 1738 date is accepted by the Aleijadinho Museum, located in Ouro Preto, and according to biographer Silvio de Vasconcelos, the original manuscript by Bretas, found in the archives of the Archdiocese of Mariana, refers the birth to 1738, warning that the date corresponds to that recorded on Aleijadinho&#x27;s death certificate; the reason for the discrepancy between the dates in the manuscript and the booklet that was printed is unclear. In 1738 Aleijadinho&#x27;s father married Maria Antônia de São Pedro, an Azorean, and with her he gave Aleijadinho four half-siblings, and it was in this family that the artist grew up.

According to Bretas, Aleijadinho&#x27;s knowledge of drawing, architecture and sculpture was obtained from his father and perhaps from draftsman and painter João Gomes Batista. From 1750 to 1759, he would have attended the boarding school at the Seminary of the Franciscans Donatos of the Hospício da Terra Santa, in Ouro Preto, where he would have learned grammar, latin, mathematics and religion. Meanwhile, he assisted his father in the work he carried out at the Church of Antônio Dias and the , also working with his uncle Antônio Francisco Pombal, a carver, and . He collaborated with José Coelho Noronha in the work of carving the altars of the Mother Church of Caeté, his father&#x27;s project. His first individual project dates back to 1752, a design for the fountain in the courtyard of the in Ouro Preto.

===Maturity===
In 1756 Aleijadinho may have gone to Rio de Janeiro accompanying Friar Lucas de Santa Clara, the transporter of gold and diamonds that were to be shipped to Lisbon, where he may have been influenced by local artists. Two years later, he would have created a soapstone fountain for the Terra Santa Hospice and soon after launched himself as a self-employed professional. However, being a mulatto, he was often forced to accept contracts as a day laborer and not as a master. From the 1760s until close to his death, Aleijadinho produced a large number of works, but in the absence of supporting documentation, several have a controversial authorship and are strictly considered only attributions, based on criteria of stylistic similarity with his authenticated production. With his father&#x27;s death in 1767, Aleijadinho, as a bastard son, was not contemplated in the will. The following year, he enlisted in the Infantry Regiment of the Brown Men of Ouro Preto, where he remained for three years, without discontinuing his artistic activity. During this period, he received important commissions: the design of the façade of the , in Sabará, and the pulpits of the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi, in Ouro Preto.

Around 1770 he organized his workshop, which was in full expansion, according to the model of craft guilds or medieval guilds, which in 1772 was regulated and recognized by the Chamber of Ouro Preto. Still in 1772, on 5 August, he was received as a brother in the Brotherhood of São José de Ouro Preto. On 4 March 1776, the governor of the Captaincy of Minas Gerais, Dom Antônio de Noronha, following the instructions of the viceroy, summoned masons, carpenters, locksmiths and blacksmiths to join a military battalion that would work on the reconstruction of a fort in Rio Grande do Sul. Aleijadinho would have been obliged to answer the call, even traveling to Rio de Janeiro, but then he would have been dismissed. In Rio, he arranged for the judicial record of the paternity of a son he had with Narcisa Rodrigues da Conceição, a mulatto, a son who was named, like his grandfather, Manuel Francisco Lisboa. She later abandoned him and took the child to Rio de Janeiro, where he later became an artisan.

Until then, according to Bretas, Aleijadinho had enjoyed good health and the pleasures of the popular parties and dances, but from 1777 onwards, signs of a serious illness began to appear. Over the years the illness deformed his body and hindered his work, causing him great suffering. To this day, as Bretas recognized, the exact nature of his illness is unknown, and several diagnostic proposals have been offered by various historians and physicians. Even with increasing difficulty, Aleijadinho continued to work intensively. On 9 December 1787, he formally assumed the role of judge of the Brotherhood of Saint Joseph. In 1790, captain Joaquim José da Silva wrote his important memorandum to the Chamber of Mariana, partially transcribed by Bretas, where he gave various data about the artist, and, witnessing the fame that accompanied him by then, greeted him as:

===Final years and death===
In 1796 Aleijadinho received another commission of great importance, for the realization of sculptures of the &quot;Via Sacra&quot; and the Prophets for the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus of Matosinhos, in Congonhas, considered to be his masterpiece. In the 1804 census, his son appeared as one of his dependents, along with his daughter-in-law Joana and a grandson. Between 1807 and 1809, with his illness being at an advanced stage, he closed his workshop, but still carried out some work. From 1812 onwards, his health deteriorated further and he began to depend heavily on the people who cared for him. Aleijadinho moved to a house near the Church of Our Lady of Carmel in Ouro Preto, to supervise the works that were in charge of his disciple Justino de Almeida. By this time, he was nearly blind and his motor skills were greatly reduced. For a brief period he returned to his old home, but soon had to settle down at his daughter-in-law&#x27;s house, who, according to Bretas, took care of him until his death on 18 November 1814. Aleijadinho was buried in the Mother Church of Antônio Dias, in a tomb next to the altar of Our Lady of the Good Death.

== The man, the disease and the myth ==
Aleijadinho was described by Bretas in the following terms:

Almost nothing is recorded about his personal life, except that he liked to entertain himself in &quot;vulgar dances&quot; and eat well, and that he fell in love with the mulatto Narcisa, with whom he had a son. Nothing was said about his artistic, social or political ideas. He always worked under the commission regime, earning half an eighth of gold a day, but he did not accumulate a fortune, rather, it is said that he was careless with money, being robbed several times. On the other hand, he would have made repeated donations to the poor. He kept three slaves: Maurício, his main helper with whom he shared his earnings, plus Agostinho, a carving assistant, and Januário, who guided the donkey he used to go around on.

Bretas reported that after 1777 Lisboa began to show signs of a mysterious degenerative disease, which earned him the nickname &quot;Aleijadinho&quot;, i.e. &#x27;little cripple&#x27;. His body gradually deformed, which caused him continuous pain; he would have lost several fingers, leaving only his index and thumb, and all of his feet, forcing him to walk on his knees. In order to work, he had to have the chisels tied to his stump hands, and in the most advanced stage of the disease he had to be carried around for all his trips — receipts for payments from slaves who took him around survive, attesting to this. His face was also damaged, lending it a grotesque appearance. According to the report, Aleijadinho was fully aware of his terrible appearance, and for this reason he developed a perennially revolted, angry and suspicious mood, imagining that even the praise he received for his artistic achievements were disguised mockery.

In order to hide his deformity, he wore loose-fitting clothes and large hats that hid his face. He also began to prefer to work at night, when he could not be seen easily, and inside a space closed by awnings. According to Bretas, citing what he learned from Aleijadinho&#x27;s daughter-in-law, in his last two years, when he could no longer work and spent most of his time in bed, one side of his body was covered with sores, and he constantly begged that Christ came to give him death and deliver him from his life of suffering, resting his holy feet on his miserable body. However, testimonies of the time do not agree on the nature or extent of his deformities. says that the version that presents him without hands originated with , who visited Minas Gerais in 1818, and is repeated by many others, but Auguste de Saint-Hilaire, for example, who was there at the same time, mentioned that Aleijadinho had preserved his hands, albeit paralyzed, a version repeated by Wilhelm Ludwig von Eschwege. The exhumation of his remains in 1930 was inconclusive. The terminal bones of the fingers and toes were not found, but they may have disintegrated after burial, a hypothesis suggested by the state of decay of the larger bones.

Several diagnoses have been proposed to explain this disease, all conjectural, which include, among others, leprosy (an unlikely alternative, since Aleijadinho was not excluded from social life, as was the case with all lepers), deforming rheumatism, yaws, &quot;cardine&quot; intoxication (an unknown substance said to have the power to enhance his artistic gifts, according to an ancient account), syphilis, scurvy, physical trauma from a fall, rheumatoid arthritis, poliomyelitis and porphyria (a disease that produces photosensitivity — which would explain the fact that the artist worked at night or protected by an awning).

The construction of the myth around Aleijadinho already began in the pioneering biography of Bretas, who, despite warning to the fact that &quot;when an individual becomes famous and admirable in any genre, there are those who, lovers of the marvelous, exaggerate indefinitely what is extraordinary in him, and from the exaggerations that succeed and accumulate, a truly ideal entity finally composes&quot;, nevertheless, Bretas praised Aleijadinho&#x27;s achievements against a hostile environment and an overwhelming illness. At the beginning of the 20th century, interested in defining a new sense of Brazilianness, the modernists took Aleijadinho as a paradigm, a mulatto, a symbol of the Brazilian cultural and ethnic syncretism, who managed to transform the Portuguese heritage into something original, and a lot of bibliography was produced in that sense, creating an aura around him that was assumed by the official instances of the national culture.

One of the most active elements in the construction of the &quot;Aleijadinho myth&quot; concerns the relentless search for confirming signs of its originality, of its &quot;uniqueness&quot; in the panorama of Brazilian art, representing an event so special that it would transcend even the style of its time. However, this search is a peculiar interpretation of the aesthetic phenomenon that was born during Romanticism in the 19th century, when the creator began to be strongly associated with his creation, the latter being considering an exclusive property of the former, and attributing to the work the ability to display genuine reflections of personality and the individual soul that produced it. This entire set of ideas did not exist, at least not with the importance it acquired, during earlier periods, which excelled in the system of collective and often anonymous creation. Art tended to be considered a product of public utility, the clients determined the approach to be employed in the work, the stories and motifs did not belong to anyone, and the artist&#x27;s personal voice should not prevail over established formal canons and collective concepts which they sought to convey, nor could the creator, in general terms, claim intellectual property over what he wrote, sculpted or painted.

Aleijadinho&#x27;s illness also became an important element in this magnified picture. As summarized by Gomes Junior:

The researcher also draws attention to the documentary evidence of receipts signed in 1796, in which Aleijadinho&#x27;s handwriting is still firm and clear. This is an inexplicable fact if Bretas&#x27; biography or the 19th century reports of travelers, such as Luccock, Friedrich von Weech, Francis de Castelnau and others, certainly repeating what they had heard from the locals, claiming Aleijadinho had lost not only fingers, but even his hands, are taken into account. However, according to Bury, from that date his handwriting visibly deteriorated. Chartier, Hansen, Grammont and others have echoed the same arguments as Gomes Júnior; Barretto added that the figure of Aleijadinho is currently a decoy for tourism in Ouro Preto to such an extent that his illness, represented in the books, is &quot;commercialized&quot; in some tourist spots in the city. In the midst of this web of dubious biographical constructions largely consecrated by tradition, several scholars have tried to separate fact from legend, in an effort that began almost at the same time as the mythical image around it was created, with the pioneering writings of José Mariano Filho and Roger Bastide on this topic, later supported by several others such as those of the aforementioned authors.

=== Iconography ===
There is no news that Aleijadinho was portrayed in life. However, at the beginning of the 20th century, a small portrait of a well-dressed mulatto, with his hands hidden, was found in the ex-voto house of the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus de Matosinhos, in Congonhas. The work was then sold in 1916 to the Rio de Janeiro merchant Baerlein as a portrait of Aleijadinho, and after ending up in an antique shop, it was bought by Guilherme Guinle, at which point the authorship of the portrait was attributed to Manoel da Costa Ataíde. In 1941 Guinle donated the portrait to the Public Archives of Minas Gerais, where in 1956 it was rediscovered by historian Miguel Chiquiloff, who began a research of almost twenty years to prove its authenticity. Chiquiloff&#x27;s conclusion was that the image does indeed represent Aleijadinho, but its authorship was attributed to an obscure painter, Euclásio Penna Ventura.

After that, a great debate was ignited in the press, and public opinion in Minas Gerais was induced to be favorable to the official recognition of the work as an authentic portrait of Aleijadinho; the proposal was even the subject of a bill that was submitted to the Legislative Assembly of Minas Gerais, but in accordance with an opinion of the State Council of Culture of Minas Gerais, which stated that &quot;due to the absence of supporting elements, it is not possible to make any official pronouncement on the authenticity of the painting referred to in the process&quot;, the project was vetoed by the governor. However, the Assembly overturned the government veto and approved Law No. 5,984, of 12 September 1972, recognizing the portrait as the official and unique effigy of Antônio Francisco Lisboa. It is the image that illustrates the opening of this article. Some Brazilian artists have also offered conjectural versions of his appearance, among them Belmonte and Henrique Bernardelli.

== Historical and artistic context ==
===Baroque and Rococo===


Aleijadinho worked during the transition period from Baroque to Rococo; his work reflects characteristics of both. However, the distinction between them is not always clear, which makes many critics consider them a unit; for these critics, Rococo represents the final phase of the Baroque cycle. Others, in turn, understand Rococo as an autonomous and differentiated current. This debate affects Aleijadinho directly, and sometimes confuses the definition of his personal style and his insertion in the great international aesthetic currents.

Baroque, which emerged in Europe at the beginning of the 17th century, was a style of reaction against the Classicism of the Renaissance, whose conceptual bases revolved around symmetry, proportionality and containment, rationality and formal balance. Thus, Baroque aesthetics excelled for asymmetry, excess, expressiveness and irregularity. Beyond a purely aesthetic trend, these traits constituted a true way of life and set the tone for the entire culture of the period, a culture that emphasized contrast, conflict, dynamic, drama, grandiloquence, and the dissolution of boundaries, together with an accentuated taste for the opulence of forms and materials, making it a perfect vehicle for the Counter-Reformation of the Catholic Church and the rising absolutist monarchies to visibly express their ideals of glory and assert their political power. A correct understanding of Baroque in the arts cannot be achieved by analyzing individual works or artists, but rather by studying its cultural context and the architectural structures that were erected at that time — the palaces and the great theaters and churches — that served as a framework of a &quot;total work of art&quot;, which included architecture itself, plus painting, sculpture, decorative and performing arts such as music, dance and theater, as Baroque sought to integrate all forms of expression into an enveloping, synthetic and unifying whole.

In Baroque Europe, the Catholic Church and the courts competed in artistic patronage. The Brazilian Baroque flourished in a very different context, in the period when Brazil was still a colony. The court was across the ocean, in the Portuguese metropole, and the internal administration that it imposed on the land was inefficient and time-consuming. This social space was immediately occupied by the Church through missionaries, who administered, in addition to divine offices, a series of civil services, were at the vanguard of the conquest of the interior of the territory, organized a good part of the urban space and dominated teaching and social assistance by maintaining schools and orphanages, hospitals and asylums. The Church also practically monopolized Brazilian colonial art, with a rare notable secular expression.

Having been born primarily as a reaction against Protestants, who condemned luxury in churches and the cult of images, the Baroque, particularly in Brazil, was a style moved mainly by religious inspiration, but, at the same time, it placed enormous emphasis on sensoriality, captivated by the richness of the materials and forms and by the decorative exuberance, trying to reconcile the illustration of spiritual glories with the appeal to worldly pleasure, seeing this as a particularly apt didactic instrument for moral and religious education. This ambiguous pact, when conditions allowed, created artistic monuments of enormous formal complexity and artistic richness.

In competition with Protestant dissidents, the Catholic clergy sought, in short, to co-opt more followers by translating the abstract meanings of their religion into a highly rhetorical visual language, which had a scenographic and declamatory sense, and which expressed itself full of hyperbole and other figures of speech, which was plastically reflected in the extreme complexity of the carving work and in the agitated and convoluted movement of the statuary, pictorial and architectural forms, which seduced by their sumptuousness and by the easily understandable motifs by the people. At a time when the population was mostly illiterate, Catholic Baroque art was a highly persuasive complement to the verbal catechism. The counter-reformist iconographic program chose the themes, the formal approach and the ways of narrative development of the visual discourse, foreseeing the achievement of a specific affective effect for each work. Privileging the most dramatic moments of sacred history, Christ being flogged, the Virgin with her heart pierced with knives, bloody crucifixes and martyrs in the apotheosis of their tortures multiplied. But that same devotion, which so often adored the tragic, also shaped countless scenes of ecstasy and heavenly visions, graceful Madonnas and sweet baby Jesus, whose appeal to the simple heart of the people was immediate and effective.

=== The gold cycle ===


Minas Gerais had the peculiarity of being a more recent settlement area in relation to the Brazilian coast, and there it was possible to build with more freedom, in more updated aesthetics, in this case, the Rococo, a profusion of new churches, without having to adapt or renovate older buildings already established and still in use, as was the case on the coast, which makes them exemplary with regard to stylistic unity. The Rococo ensemble of churches in Minas Gerais is of special importance both for its richness and variety and for being a witness to a very specific phase of Brazilian history, when the region concentrated the attention of the Portuguese metropole for its large deposits of gold and diamonds and constituted the first nucleus of an eminently urban society in Brazil. The formulation of a differentiated artistic language in Minas Gerais was also due to two other important factors: its relative isolation from the rest of the colony and the sudden enrichment of the region with the discovery of the gold deposits. The style typically practiced in Minas Gerais had its main center in the old Vila Rica, today Ouro Preto, founded in 1711, but it also flourished vigorously in Diamantina, Mariana, Tiradentes, Sabará, Cachoeira do Campo, São João del-Rei, Congonhas and a number of other mining towns and villages. When gold began to run out, around 1760, the cultural cycle of the region also began to decline, but that was when its characteristic style, at this point already transitioning to Rococo, reached its culmination with the mature work of Aleijadinho and Master Ataíde. The wealth of the region in the 18th century also favored the emergence of an urban elite interested in art, sponsoring artists and appreciating secular works. According to Afonso Ávila,

The role of the brotherhoods in the social life of Minas Gerais, to which Aleijadinho connected through the Brotherhood of São José, which served mainly mulattos and attracted many carpenters, was important. They were organizations that sponsored the arts, fostered the spirit of Christian living, created a network of mutual assistance for their members, and dedicated themselves to caring for the poor. Many became very wealthy, and competed in building temples decorated with luxury and refinement, boasting paintings, carvings and statuary. It is also considered that the brotherhoods had a political side, acting in the construction of a social consciousness in an environment dominated by the Portuguese elite. At the time when Aleijadinho worked, Minas Gerais was in a state of political and social agitation, strongly pressured by the Portuguese Crown, which wanted the gold from the mines at any cost, and due to this intolerable pressure it became the headquarters of the Minas Gerais Conspiracy. It is documented that Aleijadinho had contact with one of the conspirators, Cláudio Manuel da Costa, but his political views are unknown.

Rococo can be succinctly described as a softening and lightening of the Baroque. In the opinion of , the form of its introduction in Minas Gerais is obscure and controversial, and the only thing known for sure is that in the 1760s works along this line already appeared in various parts of the region, without any apparent connection between them. Other researchers attribute the emergence of the style in Minas Gerais to the spread of German and French engravings, statuary and Portuguese tiles, created in this aesthetic that was already consolidated in Europe at this point. Throughout colonial Brazil, art developed under a very precarious teaching structure, essentially artisanal and corporate, and the practice of learning through the study of reproductions of great examples of European art was a commonplace process among local artists, who looked to them for inspiration for their own work. It is also certain that Portuguese artists circulated in the region; they knew the art of the Metropolis well and naturally left their mark on the people of Minas Gerais.


In any case, Rococo was characterized by the abandonment of the heavy and compact decoration of the oldest and typically Baroque coastal temples, full of dense carvings, often completely covered in gold, framing compartmentalized panels painted in somber colors, the so-called &quot;coffers&quot;, and instead adopting decorations that are more open, flowing, luminous and light. The softening was also imprinted on the architecture, with more elegant facades and more decorative porticos, larger windows for more effective internal lighting, busier plants, more docile materials such as soapstone, and interiors with a predominance of white, interspersed with more delicate and graceful carving, more expansive and also more sparse, often resorting to patterns derived from the shape of the shell with clear polychromies. The general approach to sacred iconography, however, was not greatly affected by Rococo in countries with a strong counter-reformist tradition such as Portugal and Brazil, continuing what was described about the theme in the Baroque, including the case of the sculptural works of Aleijadinho, whose drama and eloquence are remarkable.

Aleijadinho&#x27;s affiliation with the aforementioned aesthetic schools is a matter of dispute; some authors even detected traces of archaic styles such as Gothic in his production, which he would have known through Florentine engravings. Mário de Andrade, in the enthusiasm that characterized the rediscovery of Aleijadinho by the modernists, went so far as to express himself about his style on an epic scale, saying that:

Sometimes Aleijadinho is analyzed as a transitional element between Baroque and Rococo, as is the case of Bazin, Brandão, Mills, Taylor and Graham. Others regard him as a typical Rococo master, such as James Hogan, for whom he was the greatest exponent of Brazilian Rococo, or Myriam Oliveira, a scholar of colonial art, who denounced the recurring tendency to assimilate the &quot;Minas Gerais phenomenon&quot; into the orbit of the Baroque, a basic flaw that she pointed out to exist in most modern studies on the art of the region and on Aleijadinho, and which originated the concept, so widespread, and for her false, of &quot;Baroque from Minas Gerais&quot;. Others see it as a perfect example of Baroque, such as Clemente, Ferrer, Fuentes and Lezama Lima. John Bury considers that:

The influence of popular art on his work is also noted, as Junqueira Filho refers to when he states that Aleijadinho&#x27;s uniqueness resides in the fact that he overcomes the talent of a simple copyist and the idiosyncrasies of a popular language that, however, remains visible as &quot;a grace craft&quot; in its process of appropriating cultured models, surpassing its models and acquiring a status of new and original work, an achievement that would be responsible for the universality of his contribution without implying the loss of its popular roots, also being a justification for its relevance in the panorama of Brazilian art.

== Works ==

=== The authorship and personal style issue ===
As with other colonial artists, identifying Aleijadinho&#x27;s works is difficult due to the fact that artists of the time did not sign their works and the scarcity of documentary sources. In general, documents such as contracts and receipts agreed between religious brotherhoods and artists are the safest sources for attributing authorship. Also other documents, such as the Memory of the councilor of Mariana transcribed by Bretas and the oral tradition are useful elements. Stylistic comparisons between authenticated works and those of suggested authorship can be used to identify the author, although this criterion is always conjectural, even more so because it is known that Aleijadinho&#x27;s &quot;typical&quot; style created a school, being continued by a large number of sculptors from Minas Gerais and copied until today by saint-makers in the region. Such a style was described by Silvio de Vasconcellos as having the following traits:

* Foot placements close to right angle;
* Drapes with sharp folds;
* Quadrangular proportions of the hands and nails, with a receding and elongated thumb, the index and little finger apart, and united ring and middle fingers of equal length; in female figures the fingers taper and undulate, rising in their middle thirds;
* Cleft chin;
* Half-open mouth and slightly fleshy but well-designed lips;
* Sharp and prominent nose, deep and marked nostrils;
* Slanted almond-shaped eyes, with accentuated teardrops and flat pupils; superciliary arches raised and joined in a &quot;V&quot; at the nose;
* Moustache arising from the nostrils, receding from the lips and blending with the beard; the latter is recessed on the face and is split into two rolls;
* Short arms, somewhat rigid, especially in the reliefs;
* Stylized hair, modeled as sinuous and grooved rolls, ending in volutes and with two locks over the forehead;
* Sharp expressiveness, penetrating gaze.

As an example, the image on the right illustrates one of the numerous works that have been accepted as his authorship based on stylistic comparison, a &quot;Nossa Senhora das Dores&quot;, today in the collection of the Museum of Sacred Art of São Paulo.

Beatriz Coelho divided his stylistic evolution into three phases: the first, between 1760 and 1774, when his style was undefined, looking for a characterization; the second, between 1774 and 1790, when he personalized himself and his works were defined by firmness and idealization, and the final one, between 1790 and his death, when stylization reached extremes, far from naturalism, trying to express spirituality and suffering.

Another aspect that must be taken into account is the work system in collective workshops that prevailed in Minas Gerais at the time; there is little certainty about the extent of his direct intervention in the execution of many of his works, even the documented ones. Often the master builders intervened in the original design of the churches, and construction supervision was carried out by teams from corporations, associated with the civil and ecclesiastical powers, which also had directive power. An indeterminate number of assistant craftsmen also participated in the carving of altars and sculptures, who, while following the guidelines of the designer in charge of the commission, left their distinctive mark on the finished pieces. As Angela Brandão said:

Being one of the icons of Brazilian art today, Aleijadinho&#x27;s work is highly valued in the market, and the issue of authorship attributions comes into play with strong pressure from various sectors involved, including official instances, collectors and art dealers. Although his documented work is limited to relatively few commissions (two of them including the large sculptural sets of Congonhas, the &quot;Via Sacra&quot; and the Prophets), the general catalog published by Márcio Jardim in 2006 listed 425 pieces as his exclusive work, without help by others, a much larger number than the 163 works counted in 1951, in the first cataloging. The number continues to grow: several pieces by hitherto unknown authorship have been &quot;authenticated&quot; in recent years, almost invariably without any documentary foundation. A critical study published in 2003 by researchers linked to the Brazilian National Institute of Historic and Artistic Heritage (IPHAN), Myriam Oliveira, Antônio Batista dos Santos and Olinto Rodrigues dos Santos Filho, contested hundreds of these attributions, and the book ended up having its entire edition seized by court order, issued in a lawsuit filed by Renato Whitaker, a great collector of Aleijadinho, who felt harmed by seeing several of his pieces discredited. The embargo, however, was later lifted. Other contestations came from Guiomar de Grammont, claiming that in his lifetime, and hampered by a limiting illness, it would be impossible for Aleijadinho to execute all the works attributed to him. She further claimed to have &quot;reason to suspect that there is collusion between collectors and critics to value anonymous works&quot;.

Aleijadinho&#x27;s participation as a carver is documented in at least four large altarpieces, as designer and executor. In all of them, his personal style deviates at some significant points from the prevailing Baroque-Rococo models. The most striking feature in these complex compositions, both sculptural and architectural, is the transformation of the crowning arch, now without a pediment, replaced by an imposing statuary group, which, according to Oliveira, suggests the artist&#x27;s primarily sculptural vocation. The first set was the project for the apse of the in Ouro Preto, dated 1772, the year in which he joined the corresponding brotherhood. The works were carried out, however, by a poorly qualified craftsman, jeopardizing the aesthetic result. It still features a crowning canopy, but is now devoid of ornaments and boasts a sculptural group.

The most important ensemble is the altarpiece of the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi in Ouro Preto, where the tendency to populate the crowning with figures reaches its high point, with a large sculptural ensemble representing the Holy Trinity. This group not only completes the altarpiece, but is effectively integrated with the ornamentation of the vault, merging wall and ceiling in an upward thrust. All the woodwork on the altarpiece has a sculptural mark, more than merely decorative, and creates an original game of diagonal planes through its structural elements, which constitutes one of the distinctive elements of his style in this field, and which was repeated in another large complex he designed, for the Franciscan Church of São João del-Rei.

The final stage in the evolution of his style as a carver is illustrated by the altarpieces he created for the Church of Our Lady of Carmel in Ouro Preto, designed and executed by him between 1807 and 1809, being the last ones he created before his illness forced him to supervise rather than execute his ideas. These last pieces present a great formal reduction, with the reduction of the decorative elements to essential forms. The retables are markedly verticalized and fully fit within the Rococo canons; they completely abandon the scheme of the crowning arch, using only forms derived from the shell (the &quot;rocalha&quot;) and branches as the central motifs of the ornaments. The shafts of the columns are no longer divided in two by a ring in the lower third, and the pelmet appears to be integrated into the composition by sinuous volutes.

==== Architecture ====
Aleijadinho worked as an architect, but the extent and nature of this activity are quite controversial. Only documentation survives on the design of two church facades, Our Lady of Carmel in Ouro Preto and Saint Francis of Assisi in São João del-Rei, both started in 1776, but whose outlines were changed in the 1770s.

Oral tradition holds that Aleijadinho was also the author of the design for the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi in Ouro Preto, but in relation to it, only his participation as a decorator is documented, creating and executing altarpieces, pulpits, a doorway and a washbasin. He also created, as already mentioned, projects for altarpieces and chapels, which fit more in the function of the decorator-carver, even though they have architectural proportions. Oliveira states that the comparison between the documented facade designs and what is traditionally attributed shows that they are dealing with very different stylistic universes, suggesting that the attribution of the Franciscan church of Ouro Preto to Aleijadinho is questionable to say the least. This presents a more compact model, with more dynamic volumes and poor ornamentation in the openings, except for the doorway, whose authorship is defined by Aleijadinho. Its aesthetics are more reminiscent of old Baroque models. The other two have decorated windows and less protruding volumes, and are conceived in the Rococo style.

The problems become more complex in the analysis of his contribution to the religious architecture of Minas Gerais when one notices the discrepancy between the design of the Church of Saint Francis of Assisi in São João del-Rei, which was recovered, with the result that is visible today, having undergone several modifications by , to the point of being fair to call him co-author of the work. According to Oliveira:

==== Sculpture ====


Aleijadinho&#x27;s greatest achievement in full-figure sculpture are the sets at the Sanctuary of Bom Jesus de Matosinhos, in Congonhas — the 66 statues of the &quot;Via Sacra&quot;, &quot;Via Crucis&quot; or &quot;Passos da Paixão&quot;, distributed in six independent chapels, and the Twelve Prophets in the churchyard. All the scenes on the &quot;Via Sacra&quot;, carved between 1796 and 1799, are intensely dramatic, and this effect is heightened by the bright colors of the life-size statues, painted, as indicated in a contract signed in 1798 by Master Ataíde and Francisco Xavier Carneiro. However, it is not certain that Carneiro worked on the pieces, as there are no payments made to him in Book 1 of Expenses until 1837, when it ends.

The typology of the &quot;Via Sacra&quot; is old, dating back to the &quot;Sacro Monte&quot; tradition, born in Italy centuries before being re-enacted in Congonhas. The type consists of a set of scenes from the Passion of Jesus, of a theatrical and pathetic nature, explicitly intended to invoke pity and compassion, briefly reconstructing the journey of Jesus from the Last Supper to his crucifixion. The scenes are usually arranged in a series of chapels that precede a temple placed on top of a hill or mountain — hence the name &quot;Sacro Monte&quot; — exactly as is the case with the Sanctuary of Congonhas, erected by Feliciano Mendes in payment of a promise and imitating the model of the homonymous shrine in Braga, Portugal.

Julian Bell found in the Brazilian ensemble an intensity not surpassed even by the Italian models, and Mário de Andrade read it as an example of a sometimes ferocious expressionism. Gilberto Freyre and others saw in some of these plays, especially in the grotesque Roman soldiers who torment Christ, a poignant and sarcastic, albeit veiled, cry of protest against the oppression of the colony by the Portuguese government and of blacks by whites. Freyre, at the same time, identified typically folkloric roots for the constitution of his extravagant personal style, such as the satirical iconography of popular culture, marveling at the skilful way in which Aleijadinho introduced elements of the voice of the people into the universe of international Baroque high culture.

By comparing the quality of the various individual figures, researchers came to the conclusion that Aleijadinho did not execute all of the &quot;Via Sacra&quot; images. His work would only be on those of the first chapel, where the &quot;Holy Supper&quot; is represented, and on those of the second chapel, featuring the &quot;Agony in the Mount of Olives&quot;. Of the other chapels, he would have personally carved only some of the figures. In the third, from the &quot;Prison&quot;, Christ and possibly Saint Peter, and in the one that contains two scenes, the &quot;Flagellation&quot; and the &quot;Crowning with Thorns&quot;, also the figures of Christ, and one of the Roman soldiers, who would have served as a model for all the others, carved by his assistants. In the chapel of &quot;Carrying of the Cross&quot;, the figure of Christ and possibly the two weeping women, together with the boy carrying a nail from the cross. In the chapel of the Crucifixion, his work would be the images of the nailed Christ and the two thieves who flanked him on Calvary, in addition, possibly, also that of Mary Magdalene.

The other part of the Matosinhos set are the twelve sculptures of the prophets, made between 1800 and 1805, whose style has been a source of controversy since the manifest misunderstanding of Bernardo Guimarães in the 19th century, who, disconcerted by the apparent errors in carving and design, still recognized moments of remarkable beauty and solemnity in the statues, truly worthy of the prophets. The set is one of the most complete series representing prophets in Western Christian art. The four main prophets of the Old Testament are present — Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel and Daniel, in a prominent position in the central wing of the staircase — and eight minor prophets, chosen according to the importance established in the order of the biblical canon, namely Baruch, Hosea, Jonah, Joel, Obadiah, Amos, Nahum and Habakkuk.

The proportions of the figures are extremely distorted. Part of the critic attributes this to the incompetence of his group of assistants or the difficulties in handling the chisel generated by his illness, but others are inclined to see an expressive intentionality in them; others understand the distortions as an eminently technical resource destined to compensate for the deformation arising from the low point of view from which the statues are seen, demonstrating that the creator was aware of the problems and demands of the figural representation in perspective. In fact, the drama of the set seems to be intensified by these aberrant forms, which are presented in a varied and theatrical gesture, imbued with symbolic meanings referring to the character of the prophet in question and the content of his message. Ten of them have the same physical type: a young man with a slender face and elegant features, high cheekbones, trimmed beard and long mustache. Only Isaiah and Nahum appear as old men with long beards. All of them also wear similar tunics, decorated with embroidery, except for Amos, the shepherd-prophet, who wears a cloak similar to the sheepskin garments found among peasants in the Alentejo region. Daniel, with the lion at his feet, also stands out in the group and it is believed that, due to the perfection of its finish, it is perhaps one of the only pieces in the set entirely made by Aleijadinho. According to Soraia Silva:

The prophets have attracted the attention of many researchers, and several theories have been proposed to interpret them. As an example, Martin Dreher, in his book &quot;A Igreja Latino-Americana no Contexto Mundial&quot;, states that in Aleijadinho&#x27;s work &quot;the feeling of revolt against the oppressors is alive&quot;, making an association between the prophets and the political situation of Minas Gerais, at the time agitated by the Minas Gerais Conspiracy; others take this line of thought further, identifying each of the prophets with one of the conspirators, some of whom the artist seems to have known personally, and others believe that there may be hidden Masonic symbolism in the works. These theories — mainly because the period documentation about the artist is very poor, leaving room for a lot of conjecture — are far from being a consensus and circulate in a limited way among specialists, although they find an appreciable space in popular culture.

In any case, the set&#x27;s conception is typical of international religious Baroque: dramatic, choreographic and eloquent. Soraia Maria Silva states that each statue represents a specific character who, despite the independence in the representative and physical space, maintain a bodily dialogue of their own. Giuseppe Ungaretti, astonished by the mystical intensity of the figures, said that &quot;Aleijadinho&#x27;s prophets are not baroque, they are biblical&quot;. Gabriel Frade thought that the set comprising the church, the large churchyard and the prophets has become one of the most known sacred architecture in Brazil, being a perfect example of how interdependent elements complement each other, crowning the entirety of the work with harmony. For John Bury:

Today the entire set of the Sanctuary is a World Heritage Site, as declared by UNESCO, in addition to being listed by IPHAN.

==== Reliefs ====
Still within the field of sculpture, there are the large reliefs that Aleijadinho sculpted for church porches, which introduced a pattern of great posterity in Brazil. Typical of this innovation is the cartouche or crowned coat of arms flanked by angels, which first appeared on the door of the Church of Carmel in Sabará. Bazin related this model to Portuguese Baroque prototypes from the time of king John V, which were often used there and in Brazil for crowning altarpieces, but the repeated presence of these elements in Portuguese Carmelite churches also suggests a preference for this religious Order.

Aleijadinho transferred this model to the portals of the Franciscan churches of Ouro Preto and São João del-Rei, where the composition became much more complex and virtuosic. In Ouro Preto, the angels have two coats of arms side by side, united by Christ&#x27;s crown of thorns and the stigmatized arms, symbols of the Franciscan Order, and over this a large medallion opens with the figure of the Virgin Mary, topped by a large royal crown. The set is decorated with garlands, flowers, cherub heads and ribbons with inscriptions, in addition to volutes and shell and foliage motifs. Also new are the design of the pedestals, in a semicircular arch, and the addition of fragments of entablature above the side pilasters, decorated with serrations and volutes. The same motifs appear in São João del-Rei, but all these portals were apparently modified, in their structural part, by Cerqueira. A differential of the Ouro Preto example is the presence of an additional relief occluding the oculus, where Saint Francis of Assisi appears receiving the stigmata, which for Mário de Andrade is among his most exquisite creations, combining remarkable sweetness and realism.

In the same category, the monumental washbasins and pulpits he carved in soapstone in churches in Ouro Preto and Sabará should be remembered, all with sculptural work in relief, both ornamental and in descriptive scenes.

== Critical reception ==
After a period of relative obscurity after his death, even though it was commented on by several travelers and scholars of the first half of the 19th century such as Auguste de Saint-Hilaire and Richard Burton, sometimes in an unflattering way, Aleijadinho returned to scene with the pioneering biography of Bretas in 1858, already mentioned. Emperor Pedro II was an admirer of his work. But it was later that his name returned with force to the aesthetic and historical discussion, with the research of Afonso Celso and Mário de Andrade in the beginning of the 20th century, allied to the new prestige that the Minas Gerais Baroque enjoyed among the government, a prestige that led to the creation of the Inspectorate of National Monuments, IPHAN&#x27;s predecessor, in 1933. For the modernists in Mário&#x27;s group, who were engaged in a process of creating a new concept of national identity, knowing Aleijadinho&#x27;s work was like an inspiring revelation, being accompanied by some illustrious French-speaking theorists, in a period when the Baroque style was very discredited among the intelligentsia in Europe but in Brazil it had become the subject of the moment. Admired, Blaise Cendrars intended to write a book about him, but that ended up not materializing. However, the studies were expanded in the following years by, among many others, Roger Bastide, Rodrigo Melo Franco de Andrade, Gilberto Freyre, Germain Bazin and also by IPHAN technicians, and since then they have expanded even more to address a wide variety of topics about the artist&#x27;s life and work, generally stating the superlative importance of his contribution. Lúcio Costa maintained a divided position; denied him talent as an architect, and rejected his work in this field as inferior, of a decorative level only, and ironized his person too, calling him &quot;tragic repressed&quot;, even though at another time he praised him as &quot;the most high individualized expression of Portuguese art of its time&quot;.

His recognition goes beyond Brazil. For a good part of modern critics, Aleijadinho represents a unique moment in the evolution of Brazilian art, being a point of confluence of the various social, ethnic, artistic and cultural roots that founded the nation, and more than that, it represents a plastic expression of very high quality of this synthesis, being the first great genuinely national artist. Among many similar opinions, Bazin praised him as the &quot;Brazilian Michelangelo&quot;, for Carlos Fuentes he was the greatest &quot;poet&quot; of colonial America, Lezama Lima called him &quot;the culmination of the American Baroque&quot;, Regis St. Louis and his collaborators give him a prominent place in the history of international art, John Crow considers him one of the most gifted creators of the western hemisphere ever, and João Hansen claims that his works are already beginning to be identified with Brazil alongside samba and football in other countries, having become one of the national icons for foreigners. There is already a museum specially dedicated to the preservation of his memory, the Aleijadinho Museum, founded in Ouro Preto in 1968, and his hometown regularly promotes &quot;Aleijadinho Week&quot;, with meetings of researchers allied to popular celebrations, where he is the main theme. The artist&#x27;s prestige with specialized critics accompanies his popularity among Brazilian laypeople. In 2007, the Bank of Brazil Cultural Center (CCBB) in Rio de Janeiro held the exhibition &quot;Aleijadinho e seu Tempo — Fé, Engenho e Arte&quot;, which had a record public of 968,577 visitors, the largest public, in absolute numbers, received at an exhibition held in the CCBB Rio since its seventeen years active, surpassing figures for the São Paulo International Biennial (535,000), and for the &quot;Picasso Na Oca&quot; (905,000) and &quot;Guerreiros de Xi&#x27;an&quot; (817,782) exhibitions.

Grammont, Gomes Júnior, Chartier, Barretto and others warn against the perennialization of mystifying, romanticized and fanciful views about the Aleijadinho, which tend to obscure his correct contextualization and the clear understanding of his artistic stature and the extent of his originality, from the copious folklore that, since the Vargas Era, both the officials and the people have been creating around his little-known and mysterious figure, elevating him to the level of a national hero. Hansen even pointed out as regrettable evidence of this situation the occurrence of political manipulation of Aleijadinho&#x27;s image abroad, citing government censorship of the publication of more critical studies in the catalog of a major exhibition that included the artist mounted in France, sponsored by the federal government of Brazil.

== In popular culture ==
Aleijadinho has already been portrayed as a character in cinema and television: in 1915 Guelfo Andaló directed the first biopic about the artist, in 1968 he was portrayed by Geraldo Del Rey in the film &quot;Cristo de Lama&quot;, Maurício Gonçalves in the film &quot;Aleijadinho - Paixão, Glória e Suplício&quot; (2003) and Stênio Garcia in a Special Case on TV Globo. In 1978 Aleijadinho was the subject of a documentary directed by Joaquim Pedro de Andrade and narrated by Ferreira Gullar.

<text>Project 629 (, ), also known by the NATO reporting name Golf, was a class of diesel-electric ballistic missile submarines that served in the Soviet Navy. All boats of this class left Soviet service by 1990, and have since been disposed of. According to some sources, at least one Golf-class submarine was operated by China, to test new submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs).

== Class history ==
Project 629 was started in the mid-1950s along with the D-2 missile launch system, which it was to carry, and was based on the Foxtrot-class submarine. The design task was assigned to OKB-16, one of the two predecessors (the other being SKB-143) of the Malakhit Marine Engineering Bureau, which would eventually become one of the three Soviet/Russian submarine design centers, along with the Rubin Design Bureau and the Lazurit Central Design Bureau. The submarine was originally designed to carry three R-11FM ballistic missiles with a range around 150 km. These were carried in three silos fitted in the rear of the large sail behind the bridge. They could only be fired with the submarine surfaced and the missile raised above the sail, but the submarine could be underway at the time. Only the first three boats were equipped with these; the remaining ones were equipped with the longer-range R-13 missiles.

The first boats were commissioned in 1958 and the last in 1962.

The boats were built at two shipyards — 16 in Severodvinsk and 7 in Komsomolsk-na-Amure in the Far East. An eighth in the Far East went to China. Fourteen were extensively modified in 1966–1972 and became known as &quot;629A&quot; by the Soviet Navy and &quot;Golf II&quot; by NATO (the original version having been designated &quot;Golf I&quot;). The major changes were the upgrade of the missile system to carry R-21 missiles, which could be launched from inside their tubes with the submarine submerged, and increased speed. In later years, a few were converted to test new missiles and others had different conversions.

All boats had left Soviet service by 1990. In 1993, 10 were sold to North Korea for scrap. According to some sources, the North Koreans were attempting to get these boats back into service.

An organization of defectors from North Korea, named In-Kook Yantai, published a report in 2016 entitled &quot;North Korea&#x27;s Nuclear and WMD Assessment&quot;. In that report, North Korean defector Kim Heung-kwang said a 3,500-ton, nuclear-powered submarine, one of a pair, was due for launch before 2018. It was described as having four missile launch silos in the sail, and is generally thought to refer to a repowered Golf II-class vessel.

In 1959, the project technology was sold to China, which built a single modified example in 1966, which is still in service.

==Project Azorian==
On March 8, 1968, northwest of Oahu in the Pacific Ocean, the Golf II-class submarine &quot;K-129&quot; sank due to an explosion brought on by unknown cause, the accident being registered by the SOSUS network. The entire crew of 98 was lost and the vessel sank with three ballistic nuclear missiles as well as two nuclear torpedoes. The United States recovered parts of the submarine in July 1974 from a depth around 5 km, in an operation named Project Azorian.

Two nuclear submarines that had been facing retirement, and , were rebuilt and pressed into service as deep-sea search vehicles. After &quot;Halibut&quot; discovered a sunken Soviet submarine containing at least one intact ballistic missile complete with nuclear warhead, Melvin Laird, United States Secretary of Defense under President Richard Nixon, approved Azorian. Six years later, 1560 nautical miles north of the Pearl Harbor, a mechanical claw descended to the bottom of the Pacific, and guided by computers on board the &quot;Glomar Explorer&quot;, clamped onto the mass of twisted, rusting steel and began slowly raising it to the surface. How successful the effort was is unclear, but the United States has admitted to recovering a portion of &quot;K-129&quot;, which included six bodies of Soviet sailors who were buried at sea with full honors.

==Variants==
*Project 629: The original design with the NATO reporting name Golf I, with a total of 22 boats built from 1958 through 1962. Dimensions are 98.4 m for length, 8.2 m for beam, and 7.85 m for draft. Surfaced/submerged displacements are 2794 / 3553 tons, respectively. Surfaced/submerged speeds are 15 / 12.5 knot, respectively. Project 629 is crewed by 80 men, and is equipped by either D-1 launching system for R-11FM or D-2 launching systems for SS-N-4 SLBMs.
*Project 629B: &quot;K-229&quot; was converted in 1958 in Severodvinsk, under Project 629B to test a newly designed on-board missile control system, which was the first-generation design based entirely on semiconductors.
*Project 629A: 14 Project 629/Golf I-class submarines were converted to Project 629A between 1966 and 1972, and received the NATO reporting name &quot;Golf II&quot;. Changes include the increase of dimension, with length and draft increased to 98.9 / 8.5 m, respectively, the surfaced/submerged displacement increased to 2300–2820 / 2700–3553 t, respectively, and surfaced/submerged speeds increased to 17 / 14 kn respectively. Crew was increased to 83, and the launching system is D-4 for SS-N-5 SLBMs.
*Project 601: &quot;K-118&quot; was converted from 1969 through 1974 and received the NATO reporting name &quot;Golf III&quot;, with displacement increased to 4000 tons and number of SLBMs increased to six, and the missile type is SS-N-8.
*Project 605: &quot;K-102&quot; was converted from 1969 through 1973 and received the NATO reporting name &quot;Golf IV&quot;, lengthened 18.3 m with four SLBMs to test R-27K (SS-N-13) SLBMs.
*Project 619: &quot;K-153&quot; was converted in 1976 to test SS-N-20 SLBMs and received the NATO reporting name &quot;Golf V&quot;.
*Project 629R: &quot;K-61&quot;, &quot;B-42&quot; and &quot;K-107&quot; were converted in Vladivostok into command posts between 1973 and 1979, with the missile and torpedo tubes removed; they received the NATO reporting name &quot;Golf SSQ&quot;.
*Type 6631: A Chinese-built Golf-class submarine, she was built in Dalian between 1960 and 1966, after receiving technical data from the USSR in 1959. China did not purchase SLBMs, thus Type 6631 was equipped with simulation systems and mainly used for training. Originally with pennant number 1101, it was subsequently changed to 200 in 1967. The second unit was supposed to be built and delivered by USSR (pennant number K-208), but due to the Sino-Soviet split, most on-board equipment was not delivered, and the boat was used as sample for reverse engineering to complete the first unit, which entered Chinese service in August 1966. In June 1968, Type 6631 went through a major refit because China decided to adopt solid-fueled SLBMs instead of liquid-fueled SLBMs, as the Soviets used, so the simulation equipment was replaced by support equipment of solid-fueled SLBMs. In addition, the planned Chinese SLBM had different dimensions from the original Russian SLBM-equipped Golf-class submarines, so the number of missile tubes was reduced to two from the original three.
*Type 031: Type 6631 went through a second major refit, which was completed in November 1978. The most important improvement is the ability to launch SLBMs under water. In addition to changing to Type 031 from the original Type 6631, the unit also received the name &quot;Great Wall&quot;, when China began restore the practice of naming its warships in the 1980s. The unit is hence usually referred as &quot;Great Wall 200&quot;.

<text>José Pedro Mourão Nunes Lamy Viçoso, , known as Pedro Lamy (; born 20 March 1972), is a Portuguese former professional racing driver. He was the first Portuguese driver to score a point in a Formula One World Championship event, in the 1995 Australian Grand Prix, for Minardi.

==Racing career==

===Early years===
Born in Aldeia Galega da Merceana, Alenquer, Portugal, Lamy graduated from karting and won the Portuguese Formula Ford Championship in his debut year, in 1989, at the age of 17. Taking on Domingos Piedade as a manager, Lamy moved to Formula Opel Lotus and won the championship in his second attempt, in 1991.

With Piedade&#x27;s help, Lamy went to Germany to race in the local Formula Three series. Signing for Willi Weber&#x27;s team, he defeated Marco Werner in the fight for the Championship, in 1992, also winning the Marlboro Masters in Zandvoort and finishing second in the Macau Grand Prix. In 1993 he raced for Crypton Engineering in Formula 3000 and finished second in the series, one point behind champion Olivier Panis, although he scored a win at Pau, a narrow street course considered even more difficult than Monaco.

===Formula One===

====Lotus (1993–1994)====
In , Lamy got the chance to race in the final four Formula One races of the season, replacing injured Alessandro Zanardi in the Lotus team. He scored no points, but was signed for the team to drive the full 1994 season. Lamy drove the first four races, before suffering a serious crash in private testing at Silverstone, breaking both legs and wrists and sitting in the sidelines for over a year.

====Minardi (1995–1996)====
After intense physical therapy, Lamy signed a contract to race in the second half of the 1995 season for Minardi, replacing Pierluigi Martini, and scoring the team&#x27;s only point of the season in Adelaide, despite a spectacular spin and struggling to get going again halfway through the race. Lamy stayed with Minardi for 1996, but the team&#x27;s lack of resources meant the car received little development, and the Portuguese driver finished his F1 career, after 32 Grand Prix starts.

===Sports car racing===

Afterwards, Lamy moved to the FIA GT Championship, where he won the GT2 class in 1998 in an Oreca Chrysler Viper GTS-R. He then raced in the Le Mans 24 Hours and the DTM for the works Mercedes team, but was unhappy with his treatment within the team.

Switching to the Zakspeed outfit, he won the 24 Hours Nürburgring twice in a row (in 2001 and 2002), taking the V8Star Series crown as well, in 2003. In 2004 he drove for BMW Motorsport in a few selected events including the 24 Hours Nürburgring that he won again. He also won the GTS class in the Le Mans Endurance Series in a Larbre Compétition Ferrari 550 Maranello. For 2005, Lamy was an Aston Martin works driver for the Sebring 12 Hours and Le Mans, also racing for BMW at the 24 Hours Nürburgring where he won again, and for the Larbre team in the FIA GT Championship.

In 2005, Lamy was announced as the driver of A1 Team Portugal in the 2005 A1 Grand Prix. However, Lamy never went beyond testing, and Álvaro Parente was appointed the main driver&#x27;s seat. Instead, Lamy remained with the Aston Martin Racing squad, taking part in the American Le Mans Series and 24 Hours of Le Mans. In 2007, Lamy became a factory driver for the Peugeot 908 HDi FAP in the Le Mans Series, as well as driving the diesel-powered prototype in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Lamy became LMP1 champion in the LMS in the first season.

In 2010, driving for BMW Motorsport, he won the 24 Hours Nürburgring for the fifth time, to tie with Marcel Tiemann for the most wins at the race. In 2012, Lamy participated in the FIA World Endurance Championship, driving a Larbre Competition Corvette C6.R in GTE-Am.

, he is a FIA (Fédération Internationale de l&#x27;Automobile) commissioner.

<doc id="909658" wikidata="Q7700202" url="?curid=909658" title="Tennessee Supreme Court">
<text>The Tennessee Supreme Court is the highest court in the state of Tennessee. The Supreme Court&#x27;s three buildings are seated in Nashville, Knoxville, and Jackson, Tennessee. The Court is composed of five members: a chief justice, and four justices. , the chief justice is Holly M. Kirby.

Unlike other states, in which the state attorney general is directly elected or appointed by the governor or state legislature, the Tennessee Supreme Court appoints the Tennessee Attorney General.

==History==
When Tennessee was admitted as a state on June 1, 1796, it didn&#x27;t have a provision for a judicial branch of government in its constitution. The Tennessee legislature created a Superior Court with three judges who were elected by the general assembly and functioned as both a trial court and an appellate court. In 1809, the Superior Court was abolished by the Tennessee legislature and a new Supreme Court of Error and Appeals, which only heard appellate cases, was established. In 1835, Tennessee adopted a new state constitution that established the judiciary an independent branch of government, which included the Supreme Court as well as a system of lower courts. This court had three justices.

==Structure==
The third Tennessee State Constitution, adopted in 1870, called for five justices, no more than two of whom may come from any one of the state&#x27;s three Grand Divisions (East Tennessee, Middle Tennessee, and West Tennessee) in order to prevent regional bias. For the same purpose, the court is required to convene alternately in Nashville, Knoxville, and Jackson. In recent years, its provision has been regarded as permissive rather than restrictive. Therefore, the court has met in other cities, such as Chattanooga, Kingsport, and Memphis, throughout the state as part of a legal education project for high school students called &quot;Supreme Court Advancing Legal Education for Students&quot; (SCALES). SCALES has been instrumental in allowing over 36,000 high school students from over 540 high schools in Tennessee to see the court in action since 1995.

The justices serve eight-year terms and can succeed themselves. The office of chief justice rotates among the justices. Justices are required to recuse themselves in cases in which they may have a personal interest; the whole court once had to step aside and a case be heard by a special court appointed by the governor, this occurring when the court itself became the subject of litigation, as described below.

The Tennessee Supreme Court has no original jurisdiction. Other than in cases of worker&#x27;s compensation, which have traditionally been appealed directly to it from the trial court, it hears only appeals of civil cases which have been heard by the Court of Appeals, and of criminal cases that have been heard by the Court of Criminal Appeals. The Tennessee Supreme Court was created through the Constitutional Convention of 1834 and replaced the Tennessee Court of Errors and Appeals.

== Judicial selection ==
The method by which Tennessee&#x27;s supreme court justices are selected has changed significantly over the years.

Originally, each justice was elected by the Tennessee General Assembly for life.

An 1853 amendment to the state constitution set judicial terms of office to eight years (even with changes in the election process, the tenure has remained the same ever since) and provided that all judges (including supreme court justices) would be elected by the people. Under this arrangement, a justice could enter office either through gubernatorial appointment (to fill a vacancy) or by winning a partisan election. Either way, the justice would have to stand for re-election during the next general state election.

In 1971, a statute modified this process at the appellate level. Under a modified version of the Missouri Plan, appellate judges (including supreme court justices) would be subjected only to a &quot;Yes/No&quot; retention vote rather than to any challenge from an electoral opponent. Thus, it became impossible to become an appellate judge without being appointed by the governor.

The revised statute was subject to litigation. In the case of &quot;Higgins v. Dunn&quot; (1973), the Court held that the retention elections were constitutional, as the constitution specified only that judges must be elected, without precisely defining what kinds of elections the General Assembly must enact for that purpose. Justice Allison B. Humphries, in his dissent, opined that the supreme court justices approving the constitutionality of the Modified Missouri Plan had, &quot;like Esau, sold [their] precious birthright, equality and freedom for a mess of potage&quot; and had made the judicial branch subordinate to the legislative branch.

Partially as a result of that decision, the statute was revised in 1974 to remove Tennessee Supreme Court justices from the plan, yet a 1994 revision to what was now called the &quot;Tennessee Plan&quot; extended it once again to supreme court justices.

The case of &quot;DeLaney v. Thompson&quot; challenged the statute once more in 1998. The plaintiffs argued that the process was not an &quot;election&quot; in the sense envisioned by the authors of the state constitution and that the court in &quot;Higgins v. Dunn&quot; had been incompetent to render a decision because of its interest in the outcome of the case. &quot;DeLaney v. Thompson&quot; was appealed to the Tennessee Supreme Court, which, if it had not recused itself in the case of &quot;Higgins v. Dunn&quot; recused itself altogether and entirely now. The governor appointed five temporary replacements to hear this case. That body declined to rule on the constitutionality of the Tennessee Plan but rather remanded the case on a technicality.

In 2014, Tennessee voters approved an amendment to the Tennessee Constitution, which codified the Tennessee Plan while adding to it a provision that gubernatorial appointments must be confirmed by the General Assembly.

Only one member of the Tennessee Supreme Court has ever been removed under the Tennessee Plan. Former Justice Penny White was removed in 1996 in a campaign reminiscent of that used a few years earlier in California to remove former Chief Justice Rose Bird, and for largely the same reason: a demonstrated unwillingness to uphold death sentences.

<text>Edge of Appalachia Preserve, also known as Richard and Lucile Durrell Edge of Appalachia Preserve System or simply The Edge, is a series of ten adjacent nature preserves located along the Appalachian Escarpment in Adams County, Ohio. Four of the ten preserves, Lynx Prairie, Buzzardroost Rock, Red Rock and The Wilderness, are National Natural Landmarks. The Preserve is owned and operated by The Nature Conservancy and Cincinnati Museum Center. It is the largest privately owned nature preserve in Ohio.

== History ==
The area encompassing the Edge of Appalachia Preserve was first studied by ecologist Emma Lucy Braun in the 1920s. However, it was not until 1959 when the Nature Conservancy purchased 42 acres (170,000 m2) near Lynx, Ohio that the Edge of Appalachia Preserve was created and established as a protected preserve.

== Biodiversity ==
The Edge of Appalachia Preserve is among the most biologically assorted areas in the Midwestern United States. The preserve is predominantly wooded with over 13,000 acres (53 km2) of forestland. Over 100 rare species of animals and plants are found within the preserve. The Edge of Appalachia Preserve contains 30 ecological communities, eight of which are classified as rare throughout the world. Among its rare plants are the Canby&#x27;s mountain lover and the northern white cedar. The Edge of Appalachia Preserve is also home to the rare green salamander and Allegheny woodrat. Over 1,200 plant species grow in the preserve.

The preserve has over 27 miles of hiking on five trails, including Buzzardroost Rock Trail, the Wilderness Trail, and the Lynx Prairie Trail.

<text>Little Odessa is a 1994 American crime drama film directed and written by James Gray, in his directorial debut, and starring Tim Roth, Edward Furlong, Moira Kelly, Maximilian Schell and Vanessa Redgrave. The title is a reference to Brighton Beach, a community in Brooklyn nicknamed &quot;Little Odessa&quot;.

==Plot==
The film follows the personal relationship between Arkady Shapira, his terminally ill wife Irina, and their two sons, Joshua and Reuben. Joshua, the elder brother, is a hit-man for the Russian-Jewish mafia in Brooklyn and estranged from his family. After finishing a contract killing, Joshua is ordered to kill an Iranian jeweler in Brighton Beach, which he reluctantly accepts. Joshua stands outside his family&#x27;s apartment, where he is spotted by one of his old friends Sasha, who tells Joshua&#x27;s brother Reuben the next day. Reuben goes to the hotel where Joshua is staying to see him. Joshua asks Reuben how he knew he was in Brighton, and they plan to meet again the next day.

Joshua waits near the boardwalk where Sasha is and intimidates him to tell who else knows about Joshua being in Brighton. Sasha brings Joshua to the car repair
stand where Viktor and Yuri are. Joshua says they will help him find the Iranian jeweler and when they refuse, Joshua threatens them.

When a man notices Joshua walking on the street, Joshua follows him to a phone booth and shoots him dead to avoid being exposed, angering neighborhood boss Boris Volkoff. Joshua starts dating his ex-girlfriend Alla Shustervich, who asks Reuben if he has seen Joshua anywhere, and the trio see a movie together. Eventually, Reuben takes Joshua home to see his parents again, but Arkady denounces him as a murderer and kicks him out.

Joshua uses information about his father&#x27;s affair to see his dying mother, who, after reminiscing about the past, asks him to go to his grandmother&#x27;s birthday party, which Joshua agrees to. On the day of the party, Joshua meets with his friends to kidnap the jeweler. They take him to the dump where Joshua kills the man, before burning the body in the furnace. They wipe the gun clean of prints and drop it near the furnace. Reuben witnesses the killing, and takes the gun from the murder scene. Arkady discovers that Reuben has been skipping school for two months and beats him. Upon seeing Reuben&#x27;s bruised face, Joshua brings Arkady to a snowy field and prepares to kill him, but loses his nerve after Arkady tells him that there&#x27;s nowhere left for him to go in Brighton Beach. Afterwards, Arkady relinquishes his son to Volkoff and Irina dies.

The next day when Reuben is riding his bike, two of Volkoff&#x27;s men push him to the ground and tell him that Joshua is a dead man. With the mafia pursuing him, Joshua stays at Alla&#x27;s.

Volkoff&#x27;s men look for Joshua and search Alla&#x27;s neighborhood. Reuben finds out from Sasha where Joshua is and rides there on his bike to warn his brother. One of Volkoff&#x27;s men finds Alla outside hanging out laundry and shoots her before escaping. Reuben finds Alla&#x27;s body and shoots the second would-be assassin. Sasha arrives on the spot and, seeing somebody behind the sheets that Alla had hung out to dry, immediately shoots the person through the sheet, believing it is one of the men looking for Joshua. When he looks behind the sheet, he realizes that he has killed Reuben; he runs off before Joshua can show up. Afterwards, Joshua finds Reuben and takes his body, wrapped in the sheet, to the furnace for cremation.

<text>Karen Jill Elson (born 15 January 1979) is an English model, singer, and songwriter.

==Early life and education==
Elson was born in Oldham, Greater Manchester, and attended North Chadderton School as a child. She has a fraternal twin sister, filmmaker Kate Elson.

==Career==

=== Modelling ===
Elson was discovered at age 16 by Debra Burns, the owner of Boss Model Management in Manchester. She began modelling locally and left Oldham a year later. Steven Meisel photographed Elson for the cover of Italian &quot;Vogue&quot; on her 18th birthday, thus launching her career worldwide. She has worked with most of the world&#x27;s major fashion photographers and fashion designers, including Arthur Elgort, Bruce Weber, Mario Testino, Peter Lindbergh, Mert and Marcus, Steven Klein, Patrick Demarchelier, Helmut Newton and Ellen Von Unwerth.

Elson&#x27;s runway modelling credits include: Marc Jacobs, Jean-Paul Gaultier, Chanel, Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Versace, Tom Ford, YSL, Alexander McQueen, Dior, Anna Sui, and Gucci.

Elson has over 30 magazine covers to her credit—international editions of &quot;Vogue,&quot; &quot;W&quot;, &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot;, &quot;Numéro&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Bazaar&quot; (British), &quot;Marie Claire&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;Lula&quot;, &quot;Foam,&quot; and &quot;Nylon&quot;. In September 2008, Elson was on the cover of British &quot;Vogue&quot; as &quot;Fashion&#x27;s Red Queen&quot;.

In 1997, Elson won the title of Model of the Year at the VH1 Fashion Awards. The September 2004, cover of American &quot;Vogue&quot; featured her as one of the &quot;Models of the Moment&quot;. In 2005, she won the British Fashion Award for Best Model.

It was then announced that Elson was the new face of British department store John Lewis for autumn/winter 2008–2009. In the autumn of 2009, she appeared on billboards internationally for H&amp;M.

She has been in ad campaigns for Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier, Louis Vuitton, Versace, Christian Dior, Burberry, Trussardi, Roberto Cavalli, Lanvin, and Chanel. For the Tom Ford 2009 spring eyewear advertising campaign, she was photographed, for the first time, by Ford himself. She was the 2010 face for American fashion brand St. John and Karen appeared with sister Kate in the 2011 H&amp;M Holiday campaign. That same year, she was part of Banana Republic&#x27;s 2011 Holiday Collection. Her cosmetic advertising credits are YSL&#x27;s Opium perfume and Kose Cosmetics.

Elson is currently the face of Jo Malone London and represents them worldwide.

Elson has appeared in many short films and videos, including the music video for the White Stripes song, &quot;Blue Orchid&quot;. She has also appeared in fashion films: &quot;War Opera&quot;, Nick Knight&#x27;s Andy Warhol-inspired series &quot;More Beautiful Women&quot;, Craig McDean&#x27;s &quot;48 Girls&quot;, and Bruce Weber&#x27;s &quot;Petit Fleur,&quot; &quot;Harlequin,&quot; &quot;Voodoo Daddy,&quot; &quot;Closer Walk With Thee&quot; and &quot;Karen&#x27;s Boogie&quot; (all films were made in conjunction with &quot;W&quot; as a tribute to New Orleans).

She acted in the short film &quot;Lay Down Lean,&quot; a project by the experimental filmmaking team Belles of the Black Diamond Field.

Elson has contributed to Nick Knight&#x27;s fashion site SHOWstudio.com since 2002. She also contributed to Knight&#x27;s project &quot;Moving Fashion&quot; with a black and white video of herself in a sequined gown, perched upon a swing. The images were accompanied by Elson playing the autoharp and singing a verse of Marlene Dietrich&#x27;s &quot;Falling in Love Again.&quot;

In 2010, she modelled a Patricia Field dress for the Sex and the City Archive in the Naomi Campbell&#x27;s Fashion for Relief runway show for the White Ribbon Alliance, an organisation aiding mothers in Haiti.

Elson has designed her own line of shoes, bags and jewellery for fashion brand Nine West.

Elson was one of eight British models chosen to walk during a segment at the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony. She wore a gold gown by Burberry and walked the stadium with her fellow models to David Bowie&#x27;s song &quot;Fashion.&quot;

=== Music ===
Elson is a founding member and performer with the New York-based political cabaret troupe the Citizens Band, appearing with them at various theatres as well as the downtown art gallery Deitch Projects since 2004. Critical response to Elson&#x27;s performances have been unequivocally positive, with the press frequently commenting on her striking vocal skills. As one of the leaders of the Citizens Band she has performed a variety of songs including covers of the Velvet Underground, Kurt Weill, Elvis Presley, Mimi and Richard Fariña, Pete Seeger, Leonard Cohen, Neil Young and Marlene Dietrich. She has also written and co-written songs for the troupe&#x27;s performances. Her cover of the Velvet Underground&#x27;s &quot;Candy Says&quot; is available on the Citizen Band&#x27;s MySpace page. Short samples of her performances are available on the troupe&#x27;s website as well.
Elson contributed backing vocals to a remix of Robert Plant&#x27;s &quot;Last Time I Saw Her&quot; from Plant&#x27;s album &quot;Dreamland&quot; in 2002. In 2005, a personal recording of Elson singing &quot;Coming Down&quot; was made available on a CD accompanying the August 2005 issue of &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine. The song was chosen by REM singer Michael Stipe. She sang a duet with Cat Power of &quot;I Love You (Me Either)&quot; for &quot;Monsieur Gainsbourg Revisited&quot;, a tribute album to French singer-songwriter Serge Gainsbourg.

Her first full-length album was written, for the most part, in secret without letting her then-husband Jack White hear what she was doing. &quot;At home I would hide—I would play my songs really in isolation. I would lock the bathroom door and hide. Eventually he was like, &#x27;Why are you hiding this from me?&#x27;&quot;. Elson released her debut solo album &quot;The Ghost Who Walks&quot; in May 2010, via White&#x27;s label, Third Man Records. It received generally favourable reviews. &quot;Spin&quot; magazine gave it 7/10 and compared her voice to both Jenny Lewis and Loretta Lynn. Elson and her band performed on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; in September 2010.

Elson has recorded numerous cover songs throughout her career including &quot;Season of the Witch&quot; by Donovan (included in the HBO TV series &quot;True Blood&quot; episode &quot;If You Love Me, Why Am I Dyin&#x27;?&quot;), &quot;Vicious&quot; by Lou Reed (released for Record Store Day 2011), &quot;Milk and Honey&quot; by Jackson C. Frank (released for Record Store Day 2012), &quot;Crying, Waiting, Hoping&quot; by Buddy Holly (for the tribute album &quot;Rave on Buddy Holly)&quot;, &quot;Gold Dust Woman&quot; by Fleetwood Mac (for the album &quot;Just Tell Me That You Want Me: A Tribute to Fleetwood Mac)&quot;, &quot;If I Had a Boat&quot; by Lyle Lovett (in closing credits of the 2014 movie &quot;Still Alice&quot;)

In September 2012, she was featured in a campaign called &quot;30 Songs / 30 Days&quot; to support &quot;Half the Sky: Turning Oppression into Opportunity for Women Worldwide&quot;, a multi-platform media project inspired by Nicholas Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn&#x27;s book. &quot;Fringe&quot; included Elson&#x27;s song &quot;The Ghost Who Walks&quot; on their season 4 episode &quot;A Better Human Being&quot;.

Elson opened for Neko Case in October 2013, for eight shows in Case&#x27;s North American tour.

Her second solo album, Double Roses, was released in 2017. Her third, &quot;Green&quot;, was released in 2022.

==Personal life==
From 2005 to 2013, Elson was married to American musician Jack White. They co-parent their two children, Scarlett Teresa White (b. 2006) and Henry Lee White (b. 2007).

In 2024, Elson married Electric Lady Studios owner Lee Foster. They reside in Nashville, Tennessee.

She is an ambassador for Save the Children and has travelled to Sierra Leone, the Middle East and the Ivory Coast. She has written articles and appeared on CNN to advocate for child rights. 

Elson published an autobiography, &quot;The Red Flame&quot; (2020), in which she details her childhood eating disorder, personal struggles and her professional journey.

<text>Tryfan () is a mountain in the Ogwen Valley, Snowdonia, Wales. It forms part of the Glyderau group, and is one of the most recognisable peaks in Britain, having a classic pointed shape with rugged crags. At above sea level, it is the fifteenth-highest mountain in Wales. Tryfan was voted Britain&#x27;s favourite mountain by &quot;Trail&quot; magazine.

Between the mid-1980s and June 2010, its accepted height was . However, it was resurveyed using accurate GPS measurements and found to be 2.4 metres (eight feet) higher (which the pre-1980s surveys also recorded).

Tryfan is said to be the final resting-place of Sir Bedivere (Bedwyr) of Arthurian legend.

==Naming==
The name &quot;Tryfan&quot; is thought to derive from the intensifying particle &quot;try–&quot; and the noun &quot;ban&quot; (‘top, peak’), giving the meaning ‘very high peak’.

==Routes of ascent==

There are many routes of ascent, ranging from easy ridge scrambling, to multi-pitch mountaineering rock climbs on the east face.

A popular ascent route is its north ridge, which starts close to the A5 road, about one mile (1.5 km) east of Idwal Cottage (a youth hostel) or Ogwen Cottage (an outdoor pursuits centre). From here a route leads directly up the ridge, a Grade 1 scramble by the easiest line. The difficulty can be increased considerably if the most direct line is followed throughout; particularly in the upper sections of the ridge. About a third of the way up there is a distinctive rock known as &quot;The Cannon&quot; which points upwards at 45 degrees and is visible from the valley. The North Tower is located three quarters of the way up, which can be avoided to the right or climbed directly at a difficulty of Grade 2.

Tryfan may also be climbed by the south ridge, which links the mountain (via Bristly Ridge) to Glyder Fach. The route begins at Bwlch Tryfan, the col between Tryfan and Bristly Ridge. The col is reached by a path leading up from Idwal Cottage to the west, passing through Cwm Bochlwyd. This cwm contains Llyn Bochlwyd.

The summit of Tryfan is famous for the twin monoliths of &quot;Siôn a Siân&quot; (&quot;Adam and Eve&quot; in English), a pair of rocks some three metres (10&#x27;) high and separated by 1.2 metres (4&#x27;). The rocks are visible from the Ogwen valley. Those who tackle the &quot;step&quot; between the two rocks are said to gain the &quot;Freedom of Tryfan&quot;. However, the exposure on one side is quite great, and mountain writer Frank Showell Styles said: &quot;In calm dry weather it is not too hard a step but the penalties of failure are unpleasant in the extreme.&quot;

Two prominent pillar-like boulders are visible on the skyline midway through the approach to the summit via the South ridge. As these can be mistaken for &quot;Siôn a Siân&quot; from a distance, they have become known as &quot;Cain and Abel&quot;, continuing the biblical theme.

==Milestone Buttress==
Milestone Buttress at the base of Tryfan is a popular location for climbing. The Buttress is about 10 minutes&#x27; walk from roadside laybys. The most popular route is known as the &quot;Direct Route&quot;: there are often queues of people waiting to climb it. It is long, and has a grade of Very Difficult (VD). The route was first climbed by G. Barlow and H. Priestly-Smith in 1910. There is also a popular Grade 3 scramble incorporating the Milestone Buttress. This route is commonly used as an alternative approach to the North Ridge, as is the nearby slabby wedge of Tryfan Bach, on the other side of the mountain.

<text>Rose Elizabeth Bird (November 2, 1936 – December 4, 1999) was the 25th Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court. She was the first female law clerk of the Nevada Supreme Court, the first female deputy public defender in Santa Clara County, the first woman to serve in the California State Cabinet, and the first female Chief Justice of California.

She was also notable as the first, and to date only, Chief Justice in California history to lose a retention election.

==Early life and education==
Bird was born near Tucson, Arizona, on November 2, 1936. Her father, Harry Bird, was the grandson of English immigrants and her mother, Anne (née Walsh), was Irish American. She had two older brothers. Her father deserted the family and died when she was five. Her mother moved the family to New York City, where Bird and her brothers grew up in poverty. She was a standout scholar in high school and won a scholarship to Long Island University, where she earned her bachelor&#x27;s degree magna cum laude. She later graduated from the UC Berkeley School of Law (Boalt Hall) in 1965.

== Legal and political career ==

After graduating from the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, Bird became the first female law clerk in the Supreme Court of Nevada.

Between 1966 and 1974, she held the positions of deputy public defender, senior trial deputy, and chief of the appellate division at the Santa Clara County Public Defender&#x27;s Office. She taught at Stanford Law School from 1972 to 1974. She volunteered with Jerry Brown&#x27;s 1974 campaign for governor, and became a trusted advisor. After Brown won the election, he appointed Bird to the position of Secretary of Agriculture.

In February 1977, Governor Brown appointed Bird as Chief Justice of the California Supreme Court.

==Chief Justice of California==

=== Tenure ===
Bird&#x27;s tenure on the Supreme Court was controversial. She drew opposition due to her strongly liberal views, lack of judicial experience, and temperament. Bird was also controversial among the Associate Justices on her court. In a 1998 oral history interview, fellow liberal Stanley Mosk said that Bird was a bright and articulate lawyer, but a terrible administrator (one of the Chief Justice&#x27;s major responsibilities). Mosk claims Bird required the Associate Justices to make appointments to talk to her for any reason.

=== Noted opinions ===
Bird&#x27;s opposition to the death penalty was reflexive. She reviewed a total of 65 capital cases appealed to the court. In every instance, she issued a decision overturning the death penalty that had been imposed at trial, including that of serial killer Rodney Alcala. She was joined by at least three of the seven members of the court in 61 of those cases.

In 1981, Bird ruled that the State Constitution required that the state provide free abortions for poor women. In 1982, Bird argued in dissent that the proposed California Proposition 8, known as the Victims&#x27; Bill of Rights, should not be allowed on the ballot. In 1984, Bird and a majority of the court granted the American Federation of Labor&#x27;s 1984 original petition to block a balanced budget amendment proposition from appearing on the ballot.

=== 1978 retention ===
Bird was first subject to a retention election in 1978. A campaign was waged against her, to which she did not respond. On election day, it was charged that the court decided to withhold the publication of a controversial ruling until after the 1978 vote. The ensuing controversy generated considerable press coverage but, by then, Bird had been retained by a 52% to 48% margin.
===1986 removal===
In 1985, Bird said in interviews that opposition to her rulings was based on sexism, bigotry, and right-wing ideology led by U.S. Attorney General Edwin Meese. She said, &quot;These are bully boys. Meese is trying it on the Supreme Court.&quot; Many Democrats later conceded that the remarks backfired on her and other members of the court appointed by Governor Brown. Her rulings and public statements led Bird&#x27;s critics to claim that she was substituting her personal opinions and ideas for the law.

The anti-Bird campaign ran television commercials featuring the surviving families of murder victims, whose murderers&#x27; sentences Bird and her fellow Justices Cruz Reynoso, Joseph Grodin, and Allen Broussard had voted to reverse. In addition to Bird, Reynoso and Grodin were also voted off the seven-justice California state supreme court bench. Bird was removed in the November 4, 1986 election by a margin of 67% to 33%.

Justice Stanley Mosk, who often joined Bird, Reynoso, and Grodin, was not challenged. Twelve years later, Mosk explained why he was able to stay and Bird was not:
As a result of the 1986 election, Governor George Deukmejian elevated Malcolm M. Lucas to Chief Justice and appointed three new associate justices. The Lucas Court moved toward a more business-friendly and pro-law enforcement judicial philosophy.

==Death==
Bird died on December 4, 1999, at Stanford University Medical Center from complications of breast cancer, which she had fought on and off since 1976. She was 63 years old.

== Legacy ==
Bird was the first and remains the only Chief Justice to be removed from that office by a majority of the state&#x27;s voters. Prior to Bird, no California appellate judge had ever failed such a vote.

After her death, the California Public Defender&#x27;s Association and California Women Lawyers Association established awards in her honor. New York Law School annually awards one graduating student the Chief Justice Rose E. Bird Award for Motivation in Pursuing Public Interest Law.

=== In popular culture ===
In 1984, Bird appeared as a family court judge in an episode of the television series &quot;Pryor&#x27;s Place.&quot;

In 1987, Bird appeared as a judge on the scripted television program called &quot;Superior Court.&quot;

<text>Thomas Blake Glover (6 June 1838 – 16 December 1911) was an Anglo-Scottish merchant in Bakumatsu and Meiji-period Japan.

==Early life (1838–1858)==
Thomas Blake Glover was born at 15 Commerce Street, Fraserburgh, Aberdeenshire in northeast Scotland on 6 June 1838, the fifth of eight children, to Thomas Berry Glover (1806-1878), a coastguard officer from Vauxhall, London and Mary Findlay (1807-1887) from the parish of Fordyce, Banffshire. Thomas Blake Glover spent the first six years of his life in Fraserburgh, which was fast expanding as a fishing and trading port.

In 1844, the family moved first to coastguard stations at Grimsby, then Collieston in Aberdeenshire, then finally to the Bridge of Don, by Aberdeen, Thomas senior having by this time been promoted to Chief Coastguard Officer. Young Thomas was educated first at the recently opened parish school in Fraserburgh, then in primary schools in Grimsby, Collieston, and finally at the Chanonry School in Old Aberdeen. Upon leaving school, Glover took a job as a shipping clerk with the trading company Jardine Matheson and in 1857 he moved to Shanghai.

==Japan (1859–1911)==
In 1859, aged 21, Glover crossed from Shanghai to Nagasaki and worked initially buying Japanese green tea. Two years later, he founded his own firm, Glover and Co. (Guraba-Shokai).

His business was based in Nagasaki. It was here that he had his home constructed; the building remains today as the oldest Western-style building in Japan.

Anti-western sentiment was rife in Japan in the Bakumatsu period due to the unbalanced treaty agreements imposed upon the Tokugawa shogunate by the United States and other western powers, which included extraterritorial rights. Nationalistic militants in Satsuma and Chōshū spearheaded anti-government efforts aimed at toppling the Shogunate and restoring the Emperor as sovereign. It was these factions, later to become leaders in the Meiji Restoration government, that Glover supplied with arms and warships.

Some of the arms sales to rebellious factions in the Western regions of Japan (i.e., Satsuma and Choshu) were conducted in violation of treaty agreements between Great Britain and Japan as well as Japanese law.

The Bakufu had made &quot;a pointed request to the British Queen not to allow the illicit trade. The Shogun himself sent her a personal letter,&quot; Glover explained, and to sell arms to a rebel force would be a treaty violation. &quot;Glover feels sorry for us,&quot; Kido explained to the Seijido [Political Council] in Yamaguchi, &quot;but there is nothing he can do.&quot; The Scot did have a suggestion to circumvent the Bakufu. If Choshu would send a vessel directly to Shanghai to buy rifles, &quot;Glover will do everything in his power to buy and load as many guns as we want; he seems to be deeply committed to us on this matter.&quot; 
In the end Glover provided the needed rifles directly from Nagasaki, and accompanied Ito Hirobumi back to Shimonoseki, on 15 October 1865, for his first personal meeting with Kido, who noted: &quot;Trading with our han is strictly prohibited for a foreigner; therefore, Glover is very reluctant about dealing with us,&quot; explained Kido; and he had not told his own crew about the sale of guns, which, in any case, were not aboard that ship. If discovered, Glover could be prohibited from engaging in foreign trade for three years, and even fined or imprisoned.

In 1863, Glover helped the Chōshū Five travel to London on Jardine Matheson ships. He also helped send fifteen trainees from Satsuma under Godai Tomoatsu in 1865. The same year, he was also responsible for bringing a small-scale steam locomotive and cars to Japan, which he demonstrated on a short track in the Ōura district of Nagasaki, causing a sensation and alerting Japan to the benefits of railway transportation.

As Glover had assisted in toppling the Tokugawa Shogunate during the Boshin War, he had cordial relations with the new Meiji government. These links led to his being responsible for commissioning one of the first warships in the Imperial Japanese Navy (the &quot;Jo Sho Maru&quot;, later called &quot;Ryūjō Maru&quot;), which was built by Alexander Hall and Company in Aberdeen and launched on 27 March 1869. Glover also commissioned the smaller &quot;Hosho Maru&quot; for the navy and the &quot;Kagoshima&quot; for the Satsuma clan from the same Aberdeen shipyard.

In 1868, Glover made a contract with the Nabeshima clan of Saga Domain in Hizen Province and began to develop Japan&#x27;s first coal mine at Hashima Island, Takashima. He also brought the first dry dock to Japan.

Thomas Glover went bankrupt in 1870, but he stayed in Japan to manage the Takashima coal mine after the Restoration for the mine&#x27;s Dutch owners until it was taken over by the Meiji government. In 1881, the mine was acquired by Iwasaki Yatarō.

Glover was a key figure in the industrialisation of Japan, helping to found the shipbuilding company which was later to become the Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan. Negotiating the sale of William Copeland&#x27;s Spring Valley Brewery in Yokohama, Glover also helped establish the Japan Brewery Company, which later became the major Kirin Brewery Company, Ltd. An urban myth has it that the moustache of the mythical creature featured on Kirin beer labels is in fact a tribute to Glover (who sported a similar moustache).

In recognition of these achievements, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun (second class).

Thomas Blake Glover died of kidney disease at his home in Tokyo in 1911, and was buried at the Sakamoto International Cemetery in Nagasaki.

==Family==

Thomas Glover had a common-law marital relationship with a Japanese woman named Awajiya Tsuru (淡路屋 ツル), a native of Bungo province (present day Oita Prefecture) whom he apparently met in Osaka in the early 1870s. Glover and Tsuru remained together until the latter&#x27;s death in 1899. The couple had a daughter named Hana, born in Nagasaki in 1876. Hana wed British merchant Walter George Bennett in 1897 and later moved with him to Korea, where she died in 1938. She had four children but only one grandchild, Ronald Bennett (born 1931), who lives in the United States.

Thomas Glover (Japanized as Gurabā or Kuraba) also adopted a British-Japanese son, later named Kuraba Tomisaburō (倉場 富三郎) (1870–1945), who was born in Nagasaki and went on to make important contributions to the economy of this city in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Tomisaburō married Nakano Waka (中野 ワカ), also of mixed British and Japanese descent. Official household registers preserved at Nagasaki City Hall indicate that Tomisaburō was the son of a woman named Kaga Maki (加賀 マキ). Kaga Maki married a Japanese man and died in Nagasaki in 1905.

Despite his Japanese citizenship, Kuraba Tomisaburō was hounded as a potential spy by the Japanese military police during World War II. His wife Waka died in 1943, and Tomisaburō committed suicide on 26 August 1945, soon after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and a few weeks before the arrival of American occupation forces in Nagasaki.

=== False correlation with &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; ===
Thomas Glover has been erroneously linked with Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; in tourist brochures, popular magazines, and some academic literature.
The stories by John Luther Long and Pierre Loti that it is based upon (albeit with some debate on exactly which and to what extent) are set on the eastern slope of Nagasaki Harbour.
There is no historical evidence to support this linkage, except Glover&#x27;s adoption of half-British Tomisaburō, the photographs of Glover&#x27;s wife Tsuru wearing a kimono with a butterfly design on the sleeve, and Loti&#x27;s Summer 1885 affair a few blocks north of Glover Garden with Kiku (Chrysanthemum) née Kane.
There are no naval officers, desertions, or attempted suicides in Glover&#x27;s life as in the stories; rather, Tsuru&#x27;s aforementioned death followed surgery.
There is also no evidence for the claim that Tsuru went by the nickname &quot;Chōchō-san&quot; (Ms Butterfly).

These tourist brochures&#x27;, magazines&#x27;, and articles&#x27; source is ultimately the fact that the American occupation forces in Japan nicknamed the former Glover House at Glover Garden, which they had requisitioned after World War 2, the &quot;Madame Butterfly House&quot; (on the basis of the panoramic view over Nagasaki Harbor and the Euro-Japanese ambiance of the building).
This nickname in its turn might have originated with the 1932 Cary Grant and Silvia Sidney American movie &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; having been partly filmed on location at the Glover mansion, and there are earlier mentions of the mansion being &quot;the original setting of &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot;&quot; in the 1926-04-25 &quot;Japan Times&quot; in coverage of a cherry-blossom fête being held there.
As this nickname was popular with American visitors, with even at the end of the 20th century the admission tickets for visitors to the house still bearing the title &quot;Home of Madame Butterfly&quot;, the Japanese, albeit somewhat controversially at the time, picked up on this as a way to promote the postwar tourism industry.

The linkage was later, in the 1950s, introduced into academic literature by way of Duiti Miyazawa writing in &quot;Opera News&quot; and elsewhere in the 1950s.
Miyazawa introduced the hypothesis, and then in fact proceeded to refute it with factual evidence, albeit then proceeding to argue that this truth is unimportant when it comes to the opera tale itself.
An outraged letter to &quot;Opera News&quot; was written in response by Edith Correl Spindle, daughter of John Luther Long&#x27;s sister Jennie Correll, who had both studied the opera at the New England Conservatory of Music and known the Glovers personally, which &quot;Opera News&quot; never printed.
Miyazawa&#x27;s contra-factual thesis, that was published, has since been repeated by people such as Roderick Cameron and others.

==Freemasonry claim==
There is speculation that he may have been a Freemason. However, no concrete evidence has been presented to support the claim. The gate with the Freemasons&#x27; insignia, which Gardiner and others cite as proof of some connection, was relocated to Glover Garden in the 1960s from the site of the former Masonic Lodge in Matsugae-machi, and none of the buildings in present-day Glover Garden have any historical link with Freemasons. 
What trading houses like Jardine Matheson were looking for were boys of high ambition who showed strength of character useful in negotiation and who were willing to spend years away from their families. In Thomas Blake’s case, the scouts may have been Masons: one of the buildings in the Glover Garden complex is a Masonic lodge, and there is a close system of business contacts running through his career. Jardine Matheson invited Thomas to interview sometime in early 1857 at the age of 18, and not long after he was posted to China. The reason for Jardine Matheson’s appointing Thomas Blake Glover are not documented, even in their own records, and may have involved exotic handshakes. We don’t know.

In Scottish Freemasonry, it is possible for the son of a Freemason to become one himself, at the age of eighteen, but there remains no evidence that Thomas Berry Glover was a member of the secret society.

==Residences==


Glover&#x27;s former residence in Nagasaki is now a visitor attraction known as Glover Garden and attracts two million visitors each year. He also had a residence in the Shiba Park area of Tokyo.

The site of the house where Glover is thought to have been born in Fraserburgh was levelled after a bomb strike during World War II, although a blue plaque marks the site of his birth. A display in Fraserburgh Heritage Centre commemorates this link.

Braehead House in Aberdeen (now known as Glover House) was purchased by the Glover family in 1864 and Thomas Blake&#x27;s parents lived there until their deaths. The house was purchased by Mitsubishi in 1996 and gifted to Grampian Regional Council. Due to local government reorganisation, the house became the property of Aberdeen City Council the same year, and in 1997 it was sold to Grampian Japan Trust for £1. The Trust sold the house to Mitsubishi for £250,000 who immediately sold it back to them for £1. The Trust used the funds to convert part of the house to a museum about Thomas Blake Glover&#x27;s life. It closed to visitors in 2012 and ownership of the empty house transferred to Glover House Trustees Ltd (a company wholly owned by Aberdeen City Council) in 2015. As at October 2021, no new use for the house had been found and the property had fallen into disrepair.

==Honours and legacy==

* Order of the Rising Sun, Gold and Silver Star, 1908 (Japan).

His association with the rebellious samurai clans of Satsuma and Chōshū, and his interest in samurai generally seems to have contributed to his being referred to as the &quot;Scottish Samurai&quot; in Scotland. A Scottish Samurai award has been initiated by one of Aberdeenshire&#x27;s most famous sons, who also holds the Order of the Rising Sun; Ronald Stewart Watt, OBE, ORS, OSS 大将軍, KCCR, KHT, 9th Dan, Hanshi, assisted by the Aberdeen Sports Council.

In December 2021, a plantation of cherry blossom trees in Mineralwell Park, Stonehaven was dedicated to Glover.

==The Glover whisky==
The Glover series of whiskies was launched in October 2015 to celebrate the life of Thomas Blake Glover and honour the long-standing relationship between Scotland and Japan.

Initially, two whiskies were created, a 22-year-old and a 14-year-old. These were made using rare single malt whisky from the highly sought-after and now defunct Hanyu distillery in Japan and single malt Scotch from Longmorn and Glen Garioch distilleries, with the blending and bottling carried out by Fife-based Adelphi. They are considered to be the first Scottish-Japanese blend, and celebrate the fact they are a blend of Scotch and non-Scotch.

The Glover 22-year-old, which had the highest concentration of the Japanese whisky, was priced at £1,050. Only 390 bottles were made. The 14-year-old was priced at around £85 and 1,500 bottles were made. Both have subsequently sold out.

A third fusion whisky, an 18-year-old, was launched in August 2016. Of this, 1,448 were made, priced around £145.

==In fiction==
Glover is the subject of &quot;The Pure Land&quot; by Alan Spence. The novel relives in fiction his true life rise and fall, and his love affair with a courtesan who, unknown to him, has a son for which he has longed. Glover is also the basis for the character Jamie McFay in the James Clavell novel &quot;Gai-Jin&quot;, set in the early 1860s. In addition, Glover appeared as an enemy in the Japanese videogame &quot;Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!&quot; and is voiced by Jeff Gedert.

<text>SuperTux is a free and open-source 2D side scrolling platform video game inspired by Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; series. The player character is Tux, the official mascot of the Linux kernel.

== Plot ==

The game begins in Icy Island. Tux holds a picnic with Penny, his girlfriend. Suddenly, the villain of the game, named Nolok, appears and knocks out Tux, then kidnaps Penny. Later, Tux wakes up and finds that Penny is missing. Determined to save her, Tux begins his journey. He then navigates the Icy Island and later the Forest to find her.

== Gameplay ==

Gameplay in &quot;SuperTux&quot; is similar to &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;. Tux can jump under bonus blocks marked with question marks to gain coins or retrieve power-ups such as the egg, which makes Tux bigger and allows him to take an extra hit before dying. Other objects such as trampolines and invincibility granting stars can also be obtained from these blocks. Tux can defeat some bad guys by jumping on them, and most can be defeated or frozen by shooting bullets after collecting a fire flower or an ice flower. Earth flowers grant Tux a miner helmet with a spotlight for dark areas and can give invincibility for a few seconds, and air flowers allow Tux to glide in the air, jump higher and move faster. If Tux gets hit after he collected a flower, he loses his helmet and transforms back into big Tux. The objective of each level is to get to the end, usually marked by checker-patterned poles.
At the end of each world is a boss, such as the Yeti boss on Icy Island or the Ghosttree on the Forest World.
In addition to the two main worlds, there are contributed levels, which include the 4 Bonus Islands, a christmas and halloween levelsets and a special retro levelset (Revenge in Redmond) designed to celebrate the game&#x27;s 20th anniversary (2020). In addition to these, there are installable addons and custom levels added by the player, either created in the internal Level Editor or added manually.

There are additional add-on levels in &quot;SuperTux&quot; which can be installed with the built-in add-on manager or manually. The add-on manager lists over 25 add-ons. New add-ons are usually published on the forum or in the Discord server and can be added to the list after testing.

== Development and release ==
The game was originally created by Bill Kendrick and is maintained by the SuperTux Development Team. It is written mostly in the C++ programming language. Many of the in-game graphics were created by Ingo Ruhnke, author of &quot;Pingus&quot;.

The game was developed under usage of Simple DirectMedia Layer as cross-platform middlelayer targeting OpenGL and OpenAL. Game engine and physics engine are own developed. The game&#x27;s metadata are &quot;S-Expressions&quot; of the programming language Lisp, scripts are written in Squirrel.

In January 2022, &quot;SuperTux&quot; was released on Steam as an Early Access game.

== Reception ==
In 2007 &quot;Punto Informatico&quot; described the atmosphere of the game as pleasant and praised the free availability of the game.

In 2008, &quot;SuperTux&quot; was used as a game for children by school district #73 in British Columbia, which had decided to transition to free and open-source software.

The game was ported to other platforms, including Wii Homebrew, GP2X, Pocket PC, PSP, and Palm WebOS. The game was also scheduled to be included in the release of the EVO Smart Console as of April 2009.

<text>Wolfgang Müller von Königswinter (15 March 1816 – 29 June 1873) was a German novelist and poet. He settled in Cologne, and became a popular poet, novelist, and chronicler of the Rhine region.

==Early life==
Müller was born in Königswinter, Germany on 15 March 1816. His real name was also the name of an earlier poet, Wilhelm Müller. He also followed the poet&#x27;s practice of appending the name of his birthplace to his original name. In 1835, he went to Bonn to study medicine at the wish of his father, also a physician. There he met Karl Joseph Simrock and Gottfried Kinkel. He continued his studies in Berlin in 1838 and graduated in 1840, after which he served his required time in the army as a surgeon. On his discharge in 1842, he went to Paris where he met Heinrich Heine, Georg Herwegh and Franz von Dingelstedt and continued his medical studies.

His stay in Paris was brief, since the death of his father pushed him to establish a practice in Düsseldorf. He married in 1847, and his family life was a great comfort and inspiration to him in later years. In 1848, he was a delegate to the preliminary parliament at Frankfurt. At its conclusion, he went back to writing sagas about the Rhine. In 1853, he gave up his medical practice and moved to Cologne, and gradually gave up medicine to devote himself to literature. He briefly went back to practicing medicine during the Franco-Prussian War and wrote some patriotic poems on this occasion.
==Poetry==

He is well known for his poem &quot;Merlin der Zauberer&quot; (&quot;Merlin the Magician,&quot; 1857). Verse epics or narratives in the German Arthurian Literature tradition were undertaken with various success from the mid-19th century forward. In contrast to Romantic poets like Karl Leberecht Immermann, for whom Merlin represented the spirit of nature, Müller created a &quot;modern Merlin&quot; who, as Niniane&#x27;s lover, uses his wisdom to resolve the conflict created by his revelation of the love affair of Guinevere. The Merlin-Niniane relationship is presented as uncharacteristically positive compared to other depictions in the Arthurian cannon.

Another well-known poem of his is &quot;Mein Herz ist am Rhein&quot; (&quot;My heart is by the Rhine&quot;). Six volumes of his selected poems were published under the title &quot;Dichtungen eines rheinischen Poeten&quot; (&quot;Poesies of a Rhine poet,&quot; 1871-76).

Müller&#x27;s poetry finds much of its material in the Rhine, its beauty, its legends, and the life of its people. His verses were not imposing in their depth of passion, originality or flights of imagination, but won the reader through their free and fresh aura, their musical voice, their tender mellowness and their poetical sensuality. They were characterised by beauty and health.

Composer Sophie Seipt (1812–1889) used Muller&#x27;s text for her song &quot;Auf eines Berges Hohen&quot; (1852).

<doc id="909704" wikidata="Q3365745" url="?curid=909704" title="Parang">
<text>Parang is a popular folk music originating from Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago that was brought to Trinidad and Tobago by Venezuelan migrants who were primarily of Amerindian, Spanish, Mestizo, Pardo, and African heritage, something which is strongly reflected in the music itself. The word is derived from two Spanish words: &quot;parranda&quot;, meaning &quot;a spree”, and &quot;parar&quot; meaning &quot;to stop&quot;.

In the past, it was traditional for parang serenaders to pay nocturnal visits to the homes of family and friends, where part of the fun was waking the inhabitants of the household from their beds. Today, parang is especially vibrant in Trinidad and Tobago communities such as Paramin, Lopinot, and Arima.

A new form of parang, soca parang, has emerged. Soca parang is a combination of soca and parang.

==Performance==
In Trinidad, traditional parang music is largely performed around Christmastime, when singers and instrumentalists (collectively known as the &quot;parranderos&quot;) travel from house to house in the community, often joined by friends, neighbours, and family, using whatever instruments are at hand. Popular parang instruments include the Venezuelan cuatro (a small, four-string guitar) and maracas (locally known as &quot;chac-chacs&quot;). Other instruments often used are violin, guitar, claves (locally known as &quot;toc-toc&quot;), box bass (an indigenous instrument), tambourine, mandolin, bandol, caja (a percussive box instrument), and marimbola (an Afro-Venezuelan instrument). In exchange for the entertainment, parranderos are traditionally given food and drink: pasteles, pastelle, sorrel, rum and &quot;Ponche Crema&quot; (a form of alcoholic eggnog).

While traditional house-to-house caroling tradition is still practised by some small groups and larger organized groups, modern parang music has also developed a season of staged performances called &quot;parang fiestas&quot;, held from October through to January each year, culminating in a national parang competition. Today, parang is especially vibrant in Trinidad and Tobago communities such as Paramin, Lopinot, and Arima.

==Varieties==
Traditional parang music includes a variety of song types:

* &quot;aguinaldo&quot; or &quot;serenal&quot;: relating to the stories of the nativity of Christ similar to European carols played in the Canary Islands and Andalusia;
* &quot;guarapo&quot;: a secular song, often with passages of improvised lyrics where content and length vary according to the skill of the lead singer;
* &quot;estribillo&quot;: a lively call-and-response style song;
* &quot;rio Manzanares&quot;: a Venezuelan waltz which celebrates the different aspects of the Manzanares River of Cumaná, Venezuela;
* &quot;joropo&quot;: similar in style to the Spanish waltz;
* &quot;galerón&quot;;
* &quot;picón&quot;;
* &quot;despedida&quot;: a song of farewell and gratitude.

Since the 1950s, parang has become more popularised. In the 1980s it evolved into &quot;soca parang&quot;, a fusion of soca and parang with lyrics in English. While still festive in nature, the lyrics often refer to North American cultural elements such as Santa Claus.

Parang has also been fused with chutney, a form of vocal music indigenous to Trinidad, influenced by Indian rhythms and sometimes sung in Hindustani. This fusion forms chutney parang.</text><links>

<text>Kevin Meade Williamson (born March 14, 1965) is an American screenwriter, director, and producer. He is known for developing and writing the screenplay for the slasher film &quot;Scream&quot; (1996)—which launched the &quot;Scream&quot; franchise—along with those for &quot;Scream 2&quot; (1997) and &quot;Scream 4&quot; (2011), and directing &quot;Scream 7&quot; (2026). He is also known for creating the WB teen drama series &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; (1998–2003), the CW supernatural drama series &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; (2009–2017), the Fox crime thriller series &quot;The Following&quot; (2013–2015) and the CBS All Access thriller series &quot;Tell Me a Story&quot; (2018–2020).

Williamson also wrote the screenplays for the films &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1997), &quot;The Faculty&quot; (1998), &quot;Cursed&quot; (2005), and &quot;Sick&quot; (2022). He made his directorial debut with the black comedy film &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot; (1999).
==Early life==
Williamson was born in New Bern, North Carolina, the younger son of Faye and Wade Williamson, a fisherman. He spent his early years in Aransas Pass, Texas, near Corpus Christi. Williamson&#x27;s family returned to North Carolina for his high school years. He then attended East Carolina University in Greenville, North Carolina, where he received a BFA in Theatre Arts.

He told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; interviewer Melissa Maerz, &quot;When I was growing up, my mom and dad took me to the Poe Museum in Richmond, Virginia. It was a little house downtown, and &quot;The Raven&quot; was written on the walls. You had to move from room to room to read the whole story. I thought it was the coolest thing in the world.&quot;

==Career==

===Early career (1990–1994)===
After graduation, he moved to New York City to pursue an acting career. Though he landed a part on the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; in 1990, he moved to Los Angeles the following year, where he had small parts on the TV series &quot;In Living Color&quot;, in the films &quot;Dirty Money&quot; and &quot;Hot Ticket&quot;, and in music videos. While taking classes on screenwriting at UCLA he wrote his first script, &quot;Killing Mrs. Tingle&quot; (later retitled &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot;) which was bought by a production company in 1995 and put on the shelf.

===Mainstream breakthrough (1995–1998)===

====&quot;Scream&quot;====
Inspired by the March 9, 1994, episode of the news magazine &quot;Turning Point&quot; on Danny Rolling, a serial killer in Gainesville, Florida, who preyed on college students, Williamson wrote a horror movie script, originally titled &quot;Scary Movie&quot;. Its characters had seen many classic horror movies (e.g. &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;A Nightmare on Elm Street&quot;) and knew all the clichés. Miramax bought the script for $400,000 for their new Dimension Films label in the spring of 1995. Directed by Wes Craven, the film was renamed &quot;Scream&quot;, and released in The United States on December 20, 1996. It became a commercial blockbuster and critical success—ultimately drawing $173 million in ticket sales worldwide.

Kevin Williamson earned the Saturn Award for Best Writing in 1996 for his work on &quot;Scream&quot;.

In 1997, Dimension Films released &quot;Scream 2&quot;, also written by Williamson. It, too, was a critical and box office hit and paved the way for two more installments, &quot;Scream 3&quot; (2000) and &quot;Scream 4&quot; (2011). The latter was written by Williamson.

====&quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;====
Paul Stupin, an executive at Columbia TriStar Television, read &quot;Scream&quot; after the bidding war for the script and was convinced Williamson was just the man to create a television series for his company. The result was &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;, a semi-autobiographical tale set in a small coastal community not unlike Oriental. Williamson was the model for the title character, Dawson Leery, a hopeless romantic who is obsessed with movies—especially those of Steven Spielberg. Joey Potter, the platonic girl-next-door, was based on a real life friend of Williamson&#x27;s when he was young.

In December 1995, the show was pitched to the Fox Network, where Stupin had been an executive, but it was rejected. Then in 1996, Stupin and Williamson went to, and struck a deal with, The WB. Williamson said, &quot;I pitched it as &quot;Some Kind of Wonderful&quot;, meets &quot;Pump Up the Volume&quot;, meets &quot;James at 15&quot;, meets &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;, meets &quot;Little House on the Prairie&quot;.&quot; &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; premiered on The WB on January 20, 1998, and was an immediate hit that helped launch the newly created television network.

In 1999, Williamson left the show to focus on other endeavors, among them ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wasteland&quot;, which failed to attract a sizable audience and was canceled after its thirteen-episode first season. He later returned to &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; to pen the two-part series finale in 2003.

====&quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;====
In 1997, Williamson penned his next film, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, based on a 1973 novel of the same name by Lois Duncan. Centered on four high school friends who accidentally run over a man and dump his body in an attempt to go on with their lives, the plot focuses on the four friends a year after the accident when they become the victims of a serial stalker. Despite receiving negative reviews from critics, the film helped launch the careers of actors Jennifer Love Hewitt, Freddie Prinze, Jr., Sarah Michelle Gellar, and Ryan Phillippe, going on to spawn two sequels, neither of which Williamson was involved with.

===Later work (1999–2008)===
Williamson gave up the job of writing the full script for &quot;Scream 3&quot; in order to direct his first penned script, originally titled &quot;Killing Mrs. Tingle&quot;, a comedy thriller, inspired by an event he experienced in high school. &quot;Teaching Mrs. Tingle&quot; (as it was renamed after the Columbine High School massacre) followed a group of students getting even with their vindictive teacher.

In 1999, Williamson created &quot;Wasteland&quot;, a late-night, sexualized version of his earlier show, &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot;. It aired for just 3 episodes in October 1999 before being canceled. The remaining 10 episodes were aired on Showtime&#x27;s ShowNext channel in 2001.

In 2001, Williamson created &quot;Glory Days&quot; as a mid-season replacement for The WB. The series followed a novelist returning to his hometown, a coastal community within Washington state, which was experiencing strange occurrences—seeming to mirror the plot ABC&#x27;s &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;. Debuting in January 2002, the series was canceled after the airing of nine episodes.

Williamson penned another script which Wes Craven would go on to direct called &quot;Cursed&quot;, after a failed first shoot starring an almost entirely different cast before re-writes and re-shoots turned the project into something new, it was finally released in 2005. Due to the many script changes, delays in production and low promotional budget due to all the re-shoots, the film failed to perform at the box office.

Later that same year, Dimension Films released Williamson&#x27;s horror film &quot;Venom&quot;, about a group of teens stalked by a crazed killer in the bayous of Louisiana. Williamson is listed as a producer of the film but not as a writer. The film opened to negative reviews and suffered at the box office, taking in less than $900,000 in gross revenue.

In 2006, Williamson began production on a new teen drama, tentatively titled &quot;Palm Springs&quot;, for The CW, the successor to the WB network. Later retitled &quot;Hidden Palms&quot;, the series was a coming-of-age drama about a troubled teen who moves with his mother and new stepfather to a gated community in Palm Springs, California, where he uncovers dark secrets about his neighbors and his home&#x27;s previous tenants. &quot;Hidden Palms&quot; was originally intended to be a midseason replacement set to air in March but its timeslot was filled by &quot;Pussycat Dolls Present: The Search for the Next Doll&quot; instead. The pilot eventually premiered on May 30, 2007, to favorable reviews. However, after eight episodes, the series was canceled due to low viewership ratings. The final episode aired on July 4, 2007.

===Return and newfound success (2009–present)===
Williamson developed a new TV series for The CW entitled &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;, which was adapted from a novel series of the same name by L. J. Smith. The series follows the life of Elena Gilbert (Nina Dobrev), who falls in love with vampire Stefan Salvatore (Paul Wesley), and soon finds herself caught in a love triangle between Stefan and his older brother, Damon (Ian Somerhalder), while the brothers are also being haunted by the past they&#x27;ve had with Katherine Pierce (also played by Dobrev). The series also focuses on the lives of Elena&#x27;s friends and other inhabitants of the fictional town of Mystic Falls, Virginia. &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; premiered on September 10, 2009, and has become a domestic and international hit.

Williamson developed a new TV series for The CW entitled &quot;The Secret Circle&quot;, which was from another book series of &quot;Vampire Diaries&quot; writer, L. J. Smith. The series revolves around six teenage witches who form a Circle coven on the fictional town of Chance Harbor, Washington.

&quot;The Secret Circle&quot; premiered on September 15, 2011, just after the third-season premiere of &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;. It was pickup for a full-season on October 12, 2011. It was eventually cancelled.

Williamson was the writer and producer for &quot;Scream 4&quot;, which began shooting in June 2010 and was released in theaters on April 15, 2011.

Williamson created the TV series &quot;The Following&quot;, which began airing on Fox in the 2012–13 television season. Starring critically acclaimed actor Kevin Bacon, the series follows an ex-FBI agent who finds himself in the middle of a network of serial killers. The series was cancelled by Fox on May 8, 2015, however it was reported the series was being shopped to Hulu for a possible fourth season.

Williamson also created &quot;Stalker&quot;, a psychological thriller centered on a pair of detectives who handle stalking incidents for the Threat Management Unit of the LAPD. The pilot was directed by Liz Friedlander and starred Dylan McDermott and Maggie Q. The series was cancelled on May 11, 2015, after one season. It was reported Warner Bros. would possibly shop the series around.

In 2017, Williamson developed &quot;Time After Time&quot;, based on the novel of the same name, with the plot reset in 2017 New York City. It failed to capture a large enough audience for ABC.

In 2018, Williamson created &quot;Tell Me a Story&quot;, a psychological thriller based on the Mexican television series Érase una vez, who takes &quot;the world&#x27;s most beloved fairy tales and reimagines them as a dark and twisted psychological thriller&quot;. The pilot was also directed by Friedlander (who also directed episodes of &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot;, &quot;The Following&quot; and &quot;Stalker&quot; for Williamson) and starred James Wolk, Billy Magnussen, Dania Ramirez, Kim Cattrall, Danielle Campbell and Paul Wesley. The latter was one of the main actors in Williamson&#x27;s previous show, &quot;The Vampire Diaires&quot;. The show began airing on CBS All Access on October 31, 2018.

In March 2020, it was announced that Williamson would serve as executive producer for the fifth installment of the &quot;Scream&quot; franchise, which was directed by Tyler Gillett and Matt Bettinelli-Olpin. The film was released on January 14, 2022.

In January 2022, it was announced that Williamson would reunite with Julie Plec for an adaptation of the comic &quot;Dead Day&quot; for Peacock. In January 2023, it was announced Peacock was no longer moving forward with &quot;Dead Day&quot; but that the potential series was being shopped to other networks.

In February 2022, it was announced that a sequel to &quot;Scream&quot; (2022) had been greenlit, with a planned release date of March 31, 2023, with Williamson on board as an executive producer.

In June 2022, Julie Plec, who co-created &quot;The Vampire Diaries&quot; with Williamson, announced that she, Williamson, and another TVDU executive producer, Brett Matthews, were working on a fourth show in the universe together.

In March 2024, Williamson was confirmed to be returning to the &quot;Scream&quot; franchise as the director of the upcoming untitled seventh &quot;Scream&quot; film.

<doc id="909711" wikidata="Q1785728" url="?curid=909711" title="Willard Mullin">
<text>Willard Mullin (September 14, 1902 – December 20, 1978) was an American sports cartoonist. He is most famous for his creation of the &quot;Brooklyn Bum&quot;, the personification of the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team, based on circus clown Emmett Kelly&#x27;s &quot;Weary Willie&quot; hobo persona. He was widely published: he cartooned daily for Scripps-Howard&#x27;s &quot;New York World-Telegram and Sun&quot; for decades and was often published in Scripps-Howard&#x27;s twenty papers, as well as in the &quot;Sporting News&quot;.

==Publications==
Mullin was often commissioned to draw cover illustrations for yearbooks of the Brooklyn Dodgers, the New York Giants, and---after those teams moved to the West Coast---the New York Mets. Mullin also did covers for Harlem Globetrotters yearbooks. When the Mets looked to be winning the National League East in 1969, &quot;Time&quot; commissioned Mullin to draw a cover for a feature on the team. Jerry Mitchell&#x27;s history of the early Mets, &quot;The Amazin&#x27; Mets&quot;, featured several previously published Mullin cartoons illustrating their early struggles.

An oversize retrospective collection of Willard Mullin cartoons, titled &quot;Willard Mullin&#x27;s Golden Age of Baseball: Drawings 1934–1972&quot;, was published by Fantagraphics Books in 2013. The book also contains biographical and historical information. In 2015, Fantagraphics Books published &quot;Willard Mullin&#x27;s Casey at the Bat and Other Diamond Tales&quot;. This book features Mullin&#x27;s thirteen drawings to match the thirteen verses of Ernest Thayer&#x27;s famous baseball poem, the poem as written in Mullin&#x27;s once-celebrated cartoon lettering style, and a few selections from Mullin&#x27;s other baseball cartoons. Until the Fantagraphics publication, the Mullin &quot;Casey&quot; had only ever been seen by those who attended an early 1950s convention of the National Association, then the overseers of Minor League Baseball and were given copies of the Mullin &quot;Casey.&quot;

==Awards==
He received the Reuben Award in 1954 for his work, as well as the National Cartoonists Society Sports Cartoon Award for each year from 1957 through 1962, and again in 1964 and 1965.

<text>enRoute was a credit card issued by Air Canada until 1992, when the airline sold its credit card division to Diners Club.

The card was developed only for Air Canada transactions, but over time, the card was expanded into a more general credit card for business travellers, being accepted by hotels, restaurants, and other merchants. It offered such features as in depth transaction details and sorting of expenses by category.

In 1989, enRoute card became the first credit card to earn its cardholders Aeroplan miles with their purchases.

In 1992, Air Canada sold the million enRoute card business to Diners Club. The move gave enRoute cardholders access to the existing Diners Club network of 2.1 million merchants at the time, while earning existing Diners Club Canada cardholders Aeroplan miles. For several years following the business transaction, Diners Club credit cards were marketed as in Canada &quot;Diners Club/en route&quot;.

==Inflight magazine==
Today, &quot;enRoute&quot; remains the name of Air Canada&#x27;s monthly inflight magazine, with a circulation of 116,244, as of 2016.

<doc id="909726" wikidata="Q1984955" url="?curid=909726" title="Nicholas Moore">
<text>Nicholas Moore (16 November 1918 – 26 January 1986) was an English poet, associated with the New Apocalyptics in the 1940s, whose reputation stood as high as Dylan Thomas’s. He later dropped out of the literary world.

==Biography==
Moore was born in Cambridge, England, the elder child of the philosopher G. E. Moore and Dorothy Ely. His paternal uncle was the poet, artist and critic Thomas Sturge Moore, his maternal grandfather was OUP editor and author George Herbert Ely and his brother was the composer Timothy Moore (1922–2003).

He was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford, Leighton Park School in Reading, the University of St Andrews, and Trinity College, Cambridge. Moore was editor and co-founder of a literary review, &quot;Seven&quot; (1938–40), while still an undergraduate. &quot;Seven, Magazine of People&#x27;s Writing&quot;, had a complex later history: Moore edited it with John Goodland; it later appeared edited by Gordon Cruikshank, and then by Sydney D. Tremayne, after Randall Swingler bought it in 1941 from Philip O&#x27;Connor.

While in Cambridge Moore became closely involved with literary London, in particular Tambimuttu. He published pamphlets under the Poetry London imprint in 1941 (of George Scurfield, G. S. Fraser, Anne Ridler and his own work). This led to Moore becoming Tambimuttu&#x27;s assistant. Moore later worked for the Grey Walls Press. In the meantime he had registered as a conscientious objector.

&quot;The Glass Tower&quot;, a selected poems collection from 1944, appeared with illustrations by the young Lucian Freud. In 1945 he edited &quot;The PL Book of Modern American Short Stories&quot;, and won Contemporary Poetry&#x27;s Patron Prize (judged that year by W. H. Auden) for &quot;Girl with a Wine Glass&quot;. In 1947 he won the Harriet Monroe Memorial Prize for &quot;Girls and Birds&quot; and various other poems.

Later Moore encountered difficulty in publishing; he was in the unusual position for a British poet of having a higher reputation in the United States. His association with the &quot;romantics&quot; of the 1940s was, in fact, rather an inaccurate reflection of his style.

In the 1950s he worked as a horticulturist, writing a book &quot;The Tall Bearded Iris&quot; (1956). In 1968 he entered 31 separate pseudonymous translations of a single Baudelaire poem, in a competition for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, run by George Steiner. Each translation focused on a different element of the poem: rhyme, pattern, tropes, symbolism, etc. producing vastly different results, to illustrate the inadequacies and lacunae produced in translation. This work was published in 1973 as &quot;Spleen&quot;; it is also available online.

&quot;Longings of the Acrobats&quot;, a selected poems volume, was edited by Peter Riley and published in 1990 by Carcanet Press. An interview with Riley concerning Moore&#x27;s rediscovery and later years appears as a documentary element within the &quot;Guilty River&quot; chapter of Iain Sinclair&#x27;s novel &quot;Downriver&quot;. According to Riley, Moore was extremely prolific and left behind many unpublished poems. An example of one of Moore&#x27;s &quot;pomenvylopes&quot; – idiosyncratic documents consisting of poems and comments typed onto envelopes and posted to friends and acquaintances – appears online at &quot;The Fortnightly Review&quot;.

His &quot;Selected Poems&quot; was published by Shoestring Press in 2014.

<doc id="909734" wikidata="Q2610999" url="?curid=909734" title="Ackworth, West Yorkshire">
<text>Ackworth is a village and civil parish in the metropolitan borough of Wakefield, West Yorkshire, England. It stands between Pontefract, Barnsley and Doncaster on the River Went. It has four parts: High Ackworth, Low Ackworth, Ackworth Moor Top, and Brackenhill. The 2001 census gave it a population of 6,493, which rose to 7,049 at the 2011 census. There is also a city ward called Ackworth, North Elmsall and Upton, with a 2011 census population of 16,099.

==History==
===Name===
The name of the village may derive from one of two sources. The first is from the Anglo-Saxon words &quot;ake&quot; or &quot;aken&quot;, meaning oak, and &quot;uurt&quot;, equivalent to &quot;worth&quot;, meaning an enclosure or homestead. The other possibility is from the Anglo-Saxon name &quot;Acca&quot;, to make Acca&#x27;s worth or Acca&#x27;s enclosure. Several place names in the area show that the Anglo-Saxons had influence. Words such as &quot;worth&quot; and also &quot;tun&quot;, meaning an enclosure or farmstead, are found in local names such as Badsworth, Hemsworth and Wentworth, and Fryston and Allerton. The name Ackworth was first recorded in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 as &quot;Aceuurde&quot; and is thought it have been formalised as &#x27;Ackworth&#x27; in the 1800s.

===Early history===
The area around Ackworth may have been settled about 500–600 by settlers from modern-day Denmark, Germany and the Netherlands after the departure of the Romans from Britain. The Romans were active around Ackworth, the nearby town of Castleford being the location of Lagentium, a Roman fort. The A639 Roman road to York also runs close by; a Roman milestone was found near its junction with Sandy Gate Lane on the parish boundary with Pontefract. In terms of Christianity, the first church may have appeared in Ackworth between 750 and 800, a well-established tradition being that the monks of Lindisfarne, escaping the Norse invasion, stopped there about 875, bringing with them the body of Saint Cuthbert. Evidence of Norse settlement can also be found locally in place names such as Thorpe Audlin and Grimethorpe, with the Norse term &quot;thorpe&quot; meaning a small settlement or a farm.

====Domesday Book====
The earliest mention of the village appears in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot;: &quot;Manor in Ackworth. Erdulf &amp; Osulf have six carucates of land to be taxed, where there might be five ploughs. Humphry now holds it of Ilbert. [Humphry] himself has there one plough and a half, and fourteen villains, and two boors. There is a Church there, and priest; one mill, of sixteen pence. Value in King Edward&#x27;s time four pounds, now three pounds. &quot;Domesday Book&quot; 107. Land of Ilbert de Lacy&quot; According to Domesday, Ilbert de Lacy was Lord of a manor able to employ five ploughs. His vassal was the Humphrey mentioned in the book, who himself owned one-and-a-half ploughs (about a quarter of the manor). The rest was divided between two farmers as Humphry&#x27;s tenants. De Lacy was a Norman knight, who received land for services to William the Conqueror and built the first earth and timber motte and bailey castle in nearby Pontefract. Domesday suggests Ackworth was small – 14 villagers and two smallholders – but as only heads of families were counted, a likelier population would have been 30–40.

===Ackworth in the Middle Ages===
Estate accounts for 1296 showed that Ackworth had developed by then. The Lord had 240 bondsmen working for him and the value of the mill had risen. Adam de Castleford had to pay 10 shillings (£0.5) rent for his land. His wife Isabella founded a Chapel of Our Lady in Ackworth Church in 1333. In 1341 the &quot;Inquisitiones Nonarum&quot; stated that the only inhabitants of Ackworth were working in agriculture. It has been speculated that the central village cross was erected by the Isabella de Castleford, who built the chapel in the church, which may date it around 1340. The cross itself was listed a grade II building in 1968, with a description as &quot;late medieval&quot;, constructed as a &quot;medieval shaft with a Tudor ball on top&quot; and &quot;prominently sited near junction with Pontefract road&quot;.

====The Black Death and Plague====

One reason given for erecting the cross was as a memorial to plague victims, possibly of the Black Death of 1349, which would have killed many. The Black Death reached Southern England in 1348 and by 1350 had killed a third of England&#x27;s population. In nearby Pontefract it was estimated that 40 per cent of the population died. A reminder of how communities communicated and traded despite the plague remains in the Ackworth plague stone, although it is thought that it dates from a further plague outbreak in 1705. Standing at the junction of Sandy Gate Lane on the road into Pontefract, the stone too is a Grade II listed monument. Plague stones were &quot;receptacles for sterilising coins in vinegar, normally at or close to parish boundaries.&quot; This suggests that the current location of the plague stone was the outer rim of the parish. The plague in 1645 was said to have killed 153, the bodies being buried in a &quot;burial field... crossed by the footpath from Ackworth to Hundhill.&quot; The area had possibly been used for mass burial after a skirmish earlier in the year between Roundhead and Royalist forces during the English Civil War. The bubonic plague of 1645 was not confined to Ackworth: in Leeds over 1,300 people died, and a further 245 were thought to have died &quot;in and around the Wakefield area&quot;. One theory was that it had been brought in by civil-war soldiers. Another version was retold by Henry Thompson in &quot;A History of Ackworth School in its first 100 years&quot;. A well-loved monk went to Rome and became &quot;smitten by the plague and died&quot;. The monk, from the priory at Nostell would preach at the medieval cross in the centre of the village and was described as a &quot;noble soul with a kindly heart&quot;, admired by young and old alike. After succumbing to the plague in Rome, his body was returned and passed through Ackworth, where &quot;nothing could satisfy the ignorant but faithful love of the old hearers&quot; and the coffin was opened. The village was then stricken with plague and the stone on Castle Syke Hill became &quot;for many months the only contact between them and the outside world&quot;. The book relates how &quot;upon that stone the Ackworth purchaser dropped his money into a vessel of water, for which, a few hours afterwards, he found his return in merchandise.&quot; Of this the author comments, &quot;We make no idle comment... We tell the tale as it was told to us.&quot;

===Battles and conflicts===
The area round Ackworth saw several important battles, such as the 1460 Battle of Wakefield and the 1461 Battle of Towton during the Wars of the Roses. In 1489, four years after the War of the Roses ended, the new King Henry Tudor levied a tax that sparked an uprising in parts of Yorkshire. Thomas Howard, the Earl of Surrey, was sent to quash this after the Earl of Northumberland had been killed by the rebels. Howard subdued it and hanged the leaders in York. In 1492 a further uprising occurred in Ackworth, of which little is known except that Howard again subdued the insurgents. An earlier link could be made with the Battle of Winwaed in 655 between Penda of Mercia and Oswiu of Northumbria, King of Berenicia. This was mentioned by Bede, but the location of the battle is unknown. Options include Oswestry in Shropshire, Winwick in Lancashire, Whinmoor, north-east of Leeds, and between Wentbridge and Ackworth, where the A639, once a Roman road, crosses the River Went. The battle was pivotal, as Penda had been a powerful pagan king and the victory of the Christian Oswiu could be seen as effectively ending Anglo-Saxon paganism.
The area around Ackworth was a hotbed for dissent against the Dissolution of the Monasteries by Henry VIII. A revolt led by Robert Aske, styled the Pilgrimage of Grace, was thought to have marched through Ackworth on its way to capture Pontefract Castle in 1536. The rebels were eventually defeated by an army sent by Henry, and its leaders hanged at Tyburn, including Sir Nicholas Tempest of Ackworth. The nearby Priory of St Oswald at Nostell was dissolved in 1540 and the land bought by Rowland Winn. During the English Civil War, the Ackworth area was strongly Royalist, with four divisions of volunteers raised from Pontefract and surrounding villages to garrison the castle. In 1645, Ackworth was occupied by Roundhead soldiers, who damaged the church and replaced the cross on top of the medieval cross in the centre of the village with the ball shape that still sits there.

The Ackworth Hoard is a hoard of 52 gold coins, 539 silver coins, and a gold posy ring found in a garden in Ackworth in April 2011. Thought to date from the Civil War period, it was declared treasure and was later acquired by Pontefract Museum.

Ackworth war memorial, opened in 1999, recalls the soldiers from Ackworth who died in the two world wars: 80 soldiers and 40 respectively.

===Religious history===
====The Church of St Cuthbert====

The first recorded mention of a church in Ackworth appears in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot;: &quot;There is a Church there, and priest.&quot; Before this, it is thought there had been a church in Ackworth from about 750. Ackworth is noted in the porch of a Durham church as one of the places where the body of St Cuthbert was taken by monks from Lindisfarne as they journeyed round the country with his body in 875–882. The Church of St Cuthbert in the centre of High Ackworth is believed to have been dedicated when the monks stopped on their pilgrimage. The original church is believed to have been replaced in the 14th century with a stone church and tower. The tower remains, but the church was renovated and restored in 1852–1854, when it is thought that the roof was lifted and additional windows added. All the present stained glass windows date from that time. The restoration followed a 1852 fire that damaged the nave and chapel. During the restoration, remains of an earlier Norman chapel were found. The church was declared a Grade II listed building in 1968.

====Thomas Bradley====

By the entrance to St Cuthbert&#x27;s is a stone font with a Latin inscription that translates: &quot;Thomas Bradley D. D. Rector. H. A. and T. C., Churchwardens. This font, thrown down in the war of the Fanatics, was set up again in the year 1663.&quot; Thomas Bradley was chaplain to Charles I of England and supposedly attended him at his execution in 1649. Bradley was given the living of Castleford and Ackworth by the King, but under the Commonwealth of England it was taken over by Thomas Birkbeck and H. Moorhouse. Bradley sided with the Royalists in the English Civil War and is recorded as part of Sir George Wentworth&#x27;s division in the garrison of Pontefract Castle. The castle survived three successive sieges before Oliver Cromwell set up headquarters at Knottingley and bombarded it. It was the last Royalist stronghold to surrender, on 24 March 1649, two months after the beheading of Charles I. During the Commonwealth period it was reported that Bradley &quot;suffered intensively&quot;; his house was looted and &quot;himself, his lady, and all his children turned out of doors to seek their bread in desolate places.&quot; A library entrusted to a John Lake of Castleford was &quot;betrayed into the hands of his enemies.&quot; After the 1660 Restoration, the living was restored to him and Thomas Birkbeck in turn ejected from the Rectory. In 1666 Bradley built two almshouses for poor women on the village green. He died on 10 October 1673.

===Village history===
====Ackworth School and the Society of Friends====
In &quot;A History of Ackworth School&quot; (1853), Ackworth was called a &quot;neat agricultural village, situate about three miles from Pontefract, and closely bordering on the great Yorkshire manufactories.&quot; The book underlines its location: &quot;It is so completely removed from any great line of road, either of the old system or the new, that but for the world-wide celebrity it has obtained from the Society of Friends from its association with their school, it is probable that, at least as it regards them, it would have slumbered in undisturbed repose amidst the well cultivated lands by which it is surrounded.&quot;

The school was opened by John Fothergill, described in the book as an &quot;eminent physician of London and a man of much influence in the Society of Friends&quot;. Originally built as a branch of the Foundling Hospital in London, work started in 1757 and cost about £13,000. The governors of the &quot;Hospital for the Maintenance and Education of Exposed and Deserted Young Children&quot; had already established branches in Shrewsbury, Chester and Westerham. Their move to Ackworth was in view of the &quot;great advantages from having one amongst the active and enterprising people of the northern counties.&quot; The hospital eventually closed in 1773 and remained empty for several years, during which time it seems to have avoided being turned into a &quot;lunatic asylum&quot; or &quot;being sold and taken down for the materials.&quot; It was on hearing that the building may be &quot;disposed of&quot; that Fothergill bought it along with 85 acres of surrounding lands for £7,000. This purchase in 1777 was fully approved by the Society of Friends in 1778 and the school set up in 1779. Fothergill died in 1780, by which time 80 girls and 150 boys were being taught there.

=====The Foundling Hospital=====
Of its time as a foundling hospital, &quot;A History of Ackworth School&quot; paints an unflattering picture, in which &quot;disease and death carried off great numbers annually,&quot; due to &quot;starvation, and even murder, on the part of nurses who had the care of the infants, and of masters to whom the elder children were apprenticed.&quot; This &quot;added to the mortality and, though the evidence is abundant of the untiring efforts of the directors to care for the children whilst in the hospital, and to protect their rights when they were apprenticed, evils and oppressions, unnumbered and insurmountable, paralyzed their exertions and the establishment was given up.&quot; Children were sent to Ackworth from London and other areas in which there was a branch of the hospital, with the children made to work, as &quot;idleness was the parent of vice,&quot; or so it was seen by the governors. In 1759 a &quot;woollen manufactory&quot; was established at the hospital, with children spinning and weaving a cloth that soon became in demand, so much so that in 1762 profits were a significant £500. Meanwhile, other children worked on the farm, and all were taught to mend their own clothes. Whilst at the hospital, attempts were made to place the children as &quot;apprentices&quot; with business owners in the local area. At times the demand for apprentices was so high that the steward of the hospital, John Hargreaves, wrote to the London board asking for more children to be sent. The high demand for apprentices in turn led to checks on those taking the apprentices being relaxed, despite the instruction to ensure that all applicants for apprentices should be tested for suitability. As the demand grew and checks became rarer, &quot;men unsuitable for the trust&quot; were able to obtain credentials and then &quot;treat the children they obtained on the strength of them, with little short of barbarity, and in more than one case murderous cruelty.&quot; Some children would be apprenticed as young as 6 and 7 until they reached 24, although in 1768 this changed to 21.

=====John Fothergill=====
After the foundling hospital closed in 1773, John Fothergill, who had arranged the purchase in 1777, turned the building into a school for the Society of Friends. Fothergill, a prominent Quaker born in Wensleydale, educated at Sedbergh School and apprenticed as an apothecary in Bradford. He studied medicine in Edinburgh, graduating in 1736 before moving to London to set up a practice. He was a keen botanist and developed an extensive garden at his home at Rooke Hall in Upton. A selection of some 2,000 sketches of his flowers and plants were sold after his death and eventually became the property of the Empress of Russia. Fothergill was a contemporary of Benjamin Franklin and took an interest in relations between England and the American Colonies, which were on the verge of war at the time. He had helped establish schools in New York and Philadelphia, and though never visiting the colonies, often saw patients crossing the Atlantic to seek his advice as a physician. His relation with Franklin was formed as Franklin visited Europe to try to find a settlement between the two countries. Fothergill wrote a paper on how the two sides might agree, and this was accepted by Franklin, but rejected by the British government. Fothergill intended Ackworth School to be a &quot;boarding school for the education of children whose parents were not rich.&quot; He took a great interest in the running it, often travelling from London to serve on the committee and help with expenses, before his death in 1780. A hall built at the school in 1899 with seating for 400 people was named Fothergill Hall.

==Geography==

At Ackworth is bounded by the City of Wakefield to the west, Pontefract to the north, with the villages of Thorpe Audlin and Kirk Smeaton to the east and Hemsworth to the south. The small River Went cuts through the village, as do the main A638 Doncaster to Wakefield road and the A628 from Barnsley to Pontefract. The underlying geology round High Ackworth consists of grey mud and silt stones associated with the Bolsovian series of rocks from the Upper Carboniferous period. An archaeological survey in 2008 described the soils as &quot;well developed based on a pale orange silty clay natural probably glacially developed outwash upon which has developed a pale grey silty clay subsoil and a silty loam topsoil.&quot;

==Demography==
The census of 2001 counted a population of 6,364 – 49.2 per cent male, 50.8 per cent female. The census statistics compared Ackworth with the rest of the Wakefield district and with the rest of England. In ethnicity, 97.7 per cent classified themselves as &quot;white&quot; – much higher than the national average of 90.9 per cent. In religion, 79.2 per cent of people classified themselves as &quot;Christian&quot; (national average: 71.7 per cent) and 11 per cent as of &quot;no religion&quot; (national average 14.6 per cent and district average of 11.7 per cent). The proportion of &quot;economically active&quot;, at 67.8 per cent, was higher than that of the Wakefield district (64.3 per cent) and the national average (66.9 per cent). Educationally, the figure of 21.5 per cent for those with a degree-level qualification or higher was significantly higher than the 12.5 per cent for the rest of the Wakefield district (national average: 19.9 per cent).

==Economy==
===Agriculture===
Agriculture played an important role in developing the Ackworth area from the times it was first settled. Other place names in the area indicate that farming was a key feature in areas around Ackworth such as Badsworth and Hemsworth. Norse place names also indicate that this continued into the period of Scandinavian settlement, when places appeared with the name &quot;thorpe&quot;, meaning a small homestead or a farm. Domesday noted that Ackworth had a mill and that the land could employ five ploughs. Accounts from 1296 show the mill as still important to the community, as its value had gone up. In 1341 the &#x27;Inquisitiones Nonarum&#x27; noted that the only people living in Ackworth were those working in agriculture. The census of 1831 showed &quot;agricultural labourer&quot; as the commonest occupation, with a total of 100 men over the age of 20 employed in it. The second most populous was &quot;retail and handicrafts&quot; with 90 employees. There were 29 people classed as &quot;farmers employing labourers&quot; and 13 as &quot;farmers not employing labourers&quot;. In the 1881 census, agriculture was still the second commonest employment in the area: 106 men and 1 woman. The commonest by this time for men was &quot;workers in various mineral substances&quot;, and for women &quot;domestic services or offices&quot;.

===Stone quarrying===
Quarrying was also important around the areas of Moor Top and Brackenhill. There was a long tradition of quarrying and masonry, and the production of building stone and high-quality grindstones used in agriculture and tool-making. Saywell (1894) describes Brackenhill as &quot;almost entirely inhabited by stoneworkers&quot; and Moor Top consisting of &quot;several good houses, the rest are the cottages of miners and quarryworkers&quot;. Saywell describes &quot;extensive quarrying&quot; in the south and south-west of the Ackworth area, with stone running &quot;near the surface&quot; in many areas. He calls Ackworth stone &quot;good, but in places... exceptionally soft and unfit for building purposes, which accounts for so many faults&quot;. The 1848 &quot;Topographical History of Great Britain&quot; notes &quot;extensive quarries&quot; of stone found in Moor Top, with an abundant supply of &quot;freestone of excellent quality&quot;.

The first stone quarry was said to have been opened by John Askew, whose initials supposedly appear on the lintel of the &quot;Masons Arms&quot;, a pub in Moor Top, one of the parish&#x27;s oldest buildings. Green, in his 1910 &quot;Historical Antiquities of Ackworth&quot;, states that quarrying was carried out as early as 1611. In 1927 Kelly&#x27;s directory of the West Riding confirmed that quarrying was still going strong and hinted that the stone was received by a global market: &quot;At Moor Top and Brackenhill are several large quarries, from which great quantities of stone are sent to all parts of England and abroad.&quot; Brackenhill was still described as a place where men employed by the stone quarries dwelt, alongside those working in the Hemsworth colliery. The working men&#x27;s club and institute in Moor Top was built in 1907 at a stated cost of £1,750.

===Coal mining===
Saywell (1894) notes that &quot;coal abounds in the vicinity&quot; and tells how in 1860, an experimental bore of 153 feet was drilled in Long Lane, but coal was &quot;not reached&quot;. However, &quot;rich veins of iron are known to exist, at certain points, especially in Low Ackworth, inasmuch as many of the natural water springs are strongly oxidised.&quot; Picturing Ackworth in 50 years&#x27; time, he surmised that &quot;it is not a too great stretch of imagination to [say] the picturesque village of Ackworth will have become one of the busiest mining centres of the West Riding of Yorkshire.&quot;

====Hemsworth Colliery====
Hemsworth Colliery, sunk in 1876, was initially called Fitzwilliam Main. By 1879 the pit employed over 300 men and boys, who travelled there from Kinsley, Hemsworth, Ackworth and Crofton. In 1879 an explosion killed five people, including three from Brackenhill. The &quot;Wakefield Express&quot; described how one of the men, John Mann, said he suffered a &quot;compound fracture of the skull and also a scalp wound, his right arm had been fractured, and he was burnt in a shocking manner on the head, face, chest and back.&quot; It added that &quot;the poor fellow expired about nine o&#x27;clock the same night.&quot; After the disaster, the colliery was taken over by the Hemsworth Colliery Coal Company in 1880, went into liquidation in 1890, and was in turn bought by a New Hemsworth Colliery Coal Company. In 1904 this became Fitzwilliam-Hemsworth Collieries and in 1907 just Hemsworth Colliery. Kelly&#x27;s directory of 1927 noted that the area of Brackenhill was &quot;inhabited chiefly by the men employed in the stone quarries and the Hemsworth colliery.&quot; A colliery was also sunk in Ackworth around 1910–1912.

==Transport==
The village sits astride two main roads, the A638 between Wakefield and Doncaster and the A628 between Barnsley and Pontefract. &quot;The Angel&quot; pub and the &quot;Boot &amp; Shoe&quot; were at one time stopping places for stage coaches as they made their way through the village, a route which would have taken them through Bell Lane, at one time a main thoroughfare, which even now has an old stone signpost at its junction.

===Rail services===
Several railway stations once served the village, whose location in relation to them was given in 1927 as &quot;3 miles from Hemsworth station on a branch line of the London and North Eastern railway from Doncaster to Wakefield, 3 miles south of Pontefract, 2 [miles] from the Featherstone station on the Wakefield and Goole branch of the Lancashire and Yorkshire railway, and 1 mile from Ackworth station on the Swinton and Knottingley branch of the London, Midland and Scottish and London and North Eastern railways.&quot; Ackworth Station was located in Low Ackworth, on the road to East Hardwick, and closed in 1951. There was also a goods station at Ackworth Moor Top opened by the Brackenhill Light Railway in 1914 and closed in 1962. It ran from Brackenhill Junction to Hemsworth Colliery and was mainly a goods service, running only 3¼ miles. The route can still be seen in places: the first mile from Brackenhill Junction to Cherry Tree Farm is used by railway maintenance road vehicles and the section from Mill Lane to Kinsley Common as a cycle path.

==Education==
===Schools in Ackworth===
Ackworth&#x27;s schools include Ackworth School, a Quaker-run boarding school and day school for pupils aged 2–18. The three primary schools are Ackworth Mill Dam Junior and Infants, Bell Lane Junior and Infants and Ackworth Howard Church of England Junior and Infants school. &#x27;Oakfield Park&#x27; is for students of 11–19 with learning difficulties.

==Notable people==
The Yorkshire and England fast bowler, Graham Stevenson, was born in Ackworth. John Gully, the pugilist, horseracer and Member of Parliament, is buried at High Ackworth in his private burial ground.

Luke Howard, amateur meteorologist and namer of clouds, lived at Ackworth Court. His daughter Rachel founded the Howard School, behind which is a Plymouth Brethren burial ground.

Theodore Kitching, Secretary to General William Booth and a Commissioner in The Salvation Army, was born in Ackworth in 1866.

After being evicted from a house owned in Berkshire, singer Dorothy Squires was asked to stay at the home of a local fan in the village, where she lived from 1988 until the host&#x27;s death in 1995.

Dave Cooper and Graham Bilbrough, members of the 1970s TV and chart group Child, are residents of Ackworth.

<text>The Boys of the Lough is a Scottish-Irish Celtic music band active since the 1970s.

==Early years==
Their first album, called &quot;Boys of the Lough&quot; (1972) consisted of Aly Bain (fiddle), Cathal McConnell (flute), Dick Gaughan (vocals and guitar) and Robin Morton (bodhran and vocals).

Since the 1960s, the Forrest Hill Bar in Edinburgh had been a centre for folk singers and instrumentalists. In the pub, always nicknamed &quot;Sandy Bell&#x27;s&quot; and now formally called that, fiddler Aly Bain played along with singer/guitarists Mike Whellans and Dick Gaughan in sessions. Aly Bain was from the Shetland Islands, and steeped in the Shetland style of playing. Meanwhile, in Ireland, Cathal McConnell was an All-Ireland champion in both flute and whistle. He was from a family of flute players in County Fermanagh in Ireland. Cathal&#x27;s musical collaborators were Tommy Gunn and Robin Morton. The two halves met at Falkirk folk festival in Scotland, and formed Boys of the Lough.

In 1973, Gaughan left to pursue a solo career and the Northumberland musician Dave Richardson (concertina, mandolin, cittern) joined. This line-up was constant for the next six albums. Richardson was also a writer of new material. They played ensemble instrumentals and the occasional song, equally divided between traditional sources from Ireland and Scotland.

==&quot;Regrouped&quot;==
The Boys of the Lough 1978/79 tour was billed as their final tour. However, they returned a year later with &quot;Regrouped&quot; (1980). Robin Morton had left to found a Scottish folk music label called Temple Records (featuring such groups as the Battlefield Band). The &quot;Regrouped&quot; line-up had two new members, and eventually fiddler John Coakley was added, who remained with the group for the next 12 years. Their 1980s sound also included Christy O&#x27;Leary from County Kerry (uilleann pipes), who had previously toured with De Dannan. Tich Richardson (guitar, bass) died in a car accident in Scotland in September 1984. In 1992, Boys of the Lough played at Carnegie Hall.

==1990s==
In 1994, the band released &quot;The Day Dawn&quot;. John Coakley left the band.

==2000s==
In 2002, the band released &quot;Lonesome Blues and Dancing Shoes&quot;. They invited guests to appear for a single album. Chris Newman (guitar) and Kathryn Tickell (Northumbrian pipes) sat in with them on tours and albums. After 32 years, Aly Bain left to play with other musicians, most notably Phil Cunningham (accordion), and was replaced in 2002 by fellow Shetland fiddler Kevin Henderson of Fiddlers&#x27; Bid.

In 2006, Boys of the Lough participated in TG4&#x27;s &quot;Geantraí&quot;. An album of the same name was issued in 2007, with contributions from Boys of the Lough, Gerry O&#x27;Connor, Joe Burke, Noel Hill, Mairtín O&#x27;Connor and others.

In 2009, &quot;Paidraig O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s/Con Cassidy&#x27;s&quot; from &quot;In The Tradition&quot; was included in Topic Records 70 year anniversary boxed set &quot;Three Score and Ten&quot;, as track fourteen on the third CD.

<doc id="909744" wikidata="Q56385" url="?curid=909744" title="Gulf Arabic">
<text>Gulf Arabic or Khaleeji ( &#x27; or&#x27;, ) is a variety of the Arabic language spoken in Eastern Arabia around the coasts of the Persian Gulf in Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, southern Iraq, eastern Saudi Arabia, northern Oman, and by some Iranian Arabs.

Gulf Arabic can be defined as a set of closely related and more-or-less mutually intelligible varieties that form a dialect continuum, with the level of mutual intelligibility between any two varieties largely depending on the distance between them. Similar to other Arabic varieties, Gulf Arabic varieties are not completely mutually intelligible with other Arabic varieties spoken outside the Gulf. The specific dialects differ in vocabulary, grammar and accent. There are considerable differences between, for instance, Kuwaiti Arabic and the dialects of Qatar and the UAE, especially in pronunciation, that may hinder mutual intelligibility. The Gulf has two major dialect types that differ phonologically and morphologically, typically referred to as &quot;badawī&quot; (&#x27;Bedouin&#x27;) and &quot;ḥadarī&quot; (&#x27;sedentary&#x27;), the differences marking important cultural differences between those who historically practiced pastoralism and those who were sedentary.

Gulf varieties&#x27; closest related relatives are other dialects native to the Arabian Peninsula, i.e. Najdi Arabic, Mesopotamian Arabic and Bahrani Arabic. Although spoken over much of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s area, Gulf Arabic is not the native tongue of most Saudis, as the majority of them do not live in Eastern Arabia. There are some 200,000 Gulf Arabic speakers in the country, out of a population of over 30 million, mostly in the aforementioned Eastern Province.

== Name ==

The dialect&#x27;s full name &#x27; ( ) can be translated as &#x27;the dialect of the gulf&#x27;. However, it is most commonly referred to as Khaliji ( &#x27; ), in which the noun (; &quot;&quot;) has been suffixed with the Nisba, literally meaning &#x27;of the bay&#x27; or &#x27;of the gulf&#x27;.

== Phonology ==
=== Consonants ===

Phonetic notes:
* only occurs in loanwords; the non-native letter , or its native counterpart , are used to denote this sound e.g.: &quot;piyāḷah&quot; ( or , &#x27;small glass&#x27;), from Persian.
* A feature that distinguishes Gulf Arabic dialects from other Arabic varieties is the retention of the dental fricatives and , which in many other dialects merged with other sounds; similarly, the reflex of the merger of classical * and * is often in some dialects but is a fricative (either or ) in Gulf dialects. It shares this feature with most Peninsular and Mesopotamian dialects.
* has merged to .
* Historically, became in Gulf Arabic. Due to influence from MSA, the sound was reintroduced in a handful of classicisms. A number of speakers realize this restricted phoneme as a voiced uvular stop; these same speakers have post-velar or uvular realizations of and ( and , respectively). For such speakers, and the are in free variation while other speakers distinguish from . Thus may be realized as or for such speakers.
* The emphatic consonants are variably described in the literature as having secondary velarization or pharyngealization. Other emphatic consonants can be found, but these are the result of a process that spreads the velarization/pharyngealization of these sounds on surrounding consonants. E.g. (&#x27;championship&#x27;) (&#x27;championship&#x27;).

===Allophony===
 and are often palatalized when occurring before front vowels unless the following consonant is emphatic. The actual realization is in free variation, and can be or, more commonly, . Speakers who exhibit variation between and do so in words derived from historical (e.g. &#x27;opposite&#x27;); is a contemporary reflex of historical and so there are also sets of words where and appear in free variation (e.g. (e.g. &#x27;neighbor&#x27;).

Voiced stops tend to devoice in utterance-final position, especially as the final element in clusters, e.g. (&#x27;dog&#x27;) .

A notable aspect of Gulf Arabic is the different realization of a number of phonemes inherited from Classical Arabic. These differences are the result, in part, of natural linguistic changes over time. After these changes occurred, the original sounds (or close approximations to them) were reintroduced as a result of contact with other dialects, as well as through influence of Modern Standard Arabic as a language of media, government, and religion. For many of these sounds, speakers exhibit free variation between the MSA form and the colloquial form. The following table provides a rough outline of these differences:

=== Vowels ===
Gulf Arabic has five long vowels and three or four short monophthongs. Two recent studies point to a lack of phonemic contrast between [i] and [u], and Shockley (2020) argues that backness is not phonemically contrastive in short vowels. The most recent grammar of Gulf Arabic similarly points to a reduced central vowel [ə] as a frequent reflex of all short vowels.
===Allophony===
Regional variations in vowel pronunciation is considerable, particularly outside of educated speech. Unless otherwise noted, the following are major allophonic variants shared across the entire Gulf region.

====Front vowels====
In the context of emphatic consonants, long and exhibit centralized vowel onglides and offglides. For example: 
* (&#x27;mud&#x27;) → .
* (&#x27;summer&#x27;) → .
* (&#x27;she menstruates&#x27;) → .

Similarly, the normal realization of short is except in final position, where it is ; when adjacent to emphatic, uvular, or bilabial consonants, is centralized to .
* (&#x27;my daughter&#x27;) → . 
* (&#x27;book&#x27;) → . 
* (&#x27;go! [f]&#x27;) → .

When between two emphatic, uvular, or bilabial consonants, is fully backed to .
* (&#x27;medicine&#x27;) → .
 (&#x27;turn over!&#x27;) → .

The normal realization of short is a front ; when adjacent to dorsal and pharyngeal consonants, the normal realization is a back ; when adjacent to emphatic consonants (and, for some speakers, bilabial consonants), the realization is a back and rounded :
* (&#x27;Bedouin&#x27;) → .
* (&#x27;after&#x27;) → .
* (&#x27;coffee&#x27;) → .
* (&#x27;row&#x27;) → .

When both a dorsal/pharyngeal consonant and emphatic consonant are adjacent to a vowel, the realization is .

For , the pattern is largely the same except that, when adjacent to dorsal/pharyngeal consonants, the realization is .
* (&#x27;he fasted&#x27;) → .
* (&#x27;he said&#x27;) → .
* (&#x27;health&#x27;) → .

Word-finally, long is shortened and subjected to the same phonological rules as short . This shortening can lead to alternations based on morphological conditioning, e.g. (&#x27;lunch&#x27;) vs. (&#x27;your lunch&#x27;).

====Back vowels====
 is normally realized as . Similarly, is realized except when unstressed, in which case it is reduced to if it is not deleted altogether (e.g. → or &#x27;houses&#x27;).

The short vowel phoneme occurs rarely as a variant of the diphthong in a handful of words (e.g. لو &#x27;if&#x27;).

Similarly to other Arabic varieties, Gulf Arabic has lost much of the case inflection of Classical Arabic. Possession is marked with the particles and , which are attached to possessive enclitics.

=== Pronouns ===

Gulf Arabic has 10 personal pronouns. The conservative dialect has preserved the gender differentiation of the 2nd and 3rd person in the plural forms, whereas dual forms have not survived. The following table bears the generally most common pronouns:
* Many speakers do not distinguish between masculine and feminine forms in the second person plural, replacing &quot;intum&quot; and &quot;intin&quot; with intu ().
* Speakers that do not distinguish between masculine and feminine forms in the third person plural will also use hum () for both genders in the third person plural, respectively.
Some pronouns, however, have other (less frequent, resp. local) forms:
* ānā ():
*: &quot;anā&quot; ()
*: &quot;āni&quot; () (especially Baḥrānī)
* inta ():
*: &quot;init&quot; ()
* huwa ():
*: &quot;hū&quot; ()
*: &quot;huwwa&quot; () (especially Qaṭarī)
*: &quot;uhu&quot; ()
* hiya ():
*: &quot;hī&quot; ()
*: &quot;hiyya&quot; () (especially Qaṭarī)
*: &quot;ihi&quot; ()
* niḥin ():
*: &quot;niḥna&quot; ()
*: &quot;iḥna&quot; () (especially Baḥrānī and Qaṭarī)
*: &quot;ḥina&quot; () (Qaṭarī)
* intum ():
*: &quot;intu&quot; ()
* hum ():
*: &quot;humma&quot; () (especially Qaṭarī)
*: &quot;uhum&quot; ()

==Syntax==
The normal word order in main clauses is the following:

Subject – (Verb) – (Direct Object) – (Indirect Object) – (Adverbials)

The following sentence indicates the normal word order of declarative statements:
When forming interrogative statements, any of these elements can be replaced by interrogative words. identifies five such words in Gulf Arabic:
* (&#x27;who&#x27;)
* (alternatively, , or ) (&#x27;what&#x27;)
* (&#x27;how&#x27;)
* (alternatively ) (&#x27;why&#x27;)
* (&#x27;when&#x27;)

Unless it is desired to stress one of these elements, this order of elements is preserved in the formation of interrogative questions.


When placing emphasis on the questioned element, word order can change. Specifically, the element of a clause can be questioned by moving it, generally to initial position. With the subject (which is normally initial), it is moved to final position:

The moved element receives strong stress; in the case of a question word, the intonation is a high fall. When the point is to seek clarification, the element questioned has a high rising intonation.

<text>A shuttle tanker is a ship designed for oil transport from an off-shore oil field as an alternative to constructing oil pipelines. It is equipped with off-loading equipment compatible with the oil field in question. This normally consists of a taut hawser arrangement or dynamic positioning to maintain the position relative to the field, an off-loading arrangement of pipes, and redundant safety systems to ensure that the potentially flammable crude oil is handled safely in a harsh environment.

Shuttle tankers initially started operating in the North Sea. They are now in use also in Brazil and Canada. Trials have been carried out in Gulf Of Mexico. There are plans to take up such operation in the Arctic Sea, north of western Russia.</text><links>

<text>The Battle of Heligoland (or Helgoland) was fought on 9 May 1864, during the Second Schleswig War, between a Danish squadron led by Commodore Edouard Suenson and a joint Austro-Prussian squadron commanded by the Austrian Commodore Wilhelm von Tegetthoff. The action came about as a result of the Danish blockade of German ports in the North Sea; the Austrians had sent two steam frigates, and , to reinforce the small Prussian Navy to help break the blockade. After arriving in the North Sea, Tegetthoff joined a Prussian aviso and a pair of gunboats. To oppose him, Suenson had available the steam frigates and and the corvette .

On the morning of 9 May, the two squadrons encountered each other off the island of Heligoland, then controlled by neutral Great Britain. Tegetthoff attacked with his two frigates while the slower Prussian vessels lagged behind, unable to effectively engage the Danish warships. Tegetthoff&#x27;s flagship, &quot;Schwarzenberg&quot;, bore the brunt of the Danish gunfire and caught fire three times, the last of which could not be put out quickly and forced Tegetthoff to seek shelter in the neutral waters around Heligoland. Though Denmark claimed a tactical victory in the battle, the Danes were forced to end the blockade of the German coast. An armistice came into effect three days after the Battle of Heligoland. By the time fighting broke out again in June, further Austrian warships had arrived to strengthen the Austro-Prussian naval forces, and the Danes did not seek to challenge them.

Historians&#x27; opinions on the outcome of the battle are mixed, with some citing the withdrawal of Tegetthoff&#x27;s ships, and the greater damage they sustained, as evidence of a tactical victory for Suenson. Other naval historians cite the lifting of the blockade as a strategic victory for the Austrians and Prussians, and others still describe the battle as inconclusive. The Battle of Heligoland was the last naval battle fought by squadrons of wooden ships, and it was also the last time Danish warships fought a major action. &quot;Jylland&quot; is preserved in Ebeltoft, the last surviving wooden-hulled, screw-driven warship.

==Background==
In late 1863, tensions began to increase between the German Confederation and Denmark over the latter&#x27;s November Constitution, which integrated the duchies of Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg with Denmark, a violation of the London Protocol that had ended the First Schleswig War. The crisis erupted in the Second Schleswig War, which began on 1 February 1864, after the Prussian and Austrian Empires delivered an ultimatum to Denmark to cede the disputed duchies to Austro-Prussian control. At the time, the Danish fleet was far superior to the Prussian naval forces initially available, which allowed the Danes to blockade the German coast. The bulk of the Prussian fleet was concentrated in the Baltic Sea, and the Austrian fleet was primarily stationed in the Mediterranean Sea. Also in the Mediterranean were the Prussian aviso and the gunboats and ; these vessels were immediately recalled to German waters.

In the meantime, on 30 March, the Danish fleet formed the North Sea Squadron, which at the time consisted of the steam frigate and the steam corvettes and , commanded by Commodore Edouard Suenson. On 6 May, the frigate relieved &quot;Dagmar&quot;, allowing her to be transferred to the Baltic Sea. By this time, the Danish squadron had captured fifteen German prizes, along with four blockade runners from neutral countries. Additionally, the ports of Hamburg and Bremen were effectively closed to traffic.

To reinforce their Prussian allies and break the blockade, the Austrians assembled a powerful squadron, which equaled the Danish fleet, and ordered it to steam from the Mediterranean Sea to the North Sea to break the blockade. The squadron was to comprise the ship-of-the-line , the armored frigates and , the screw frigates and , the screw corvette , the sidewheel gunboats and , and the gunboats and . Initially, only the Austrian Levant Squadron, commanded by Commodore Wilhelm von Tegetthoff, was ready and so those ships were ordered north in advance of the rest of the squadron. The Levant Squadron, centered on &quot;Schwarzenberg&quot; and &quot;Radetzky&quot; arrived in the North Sea on 1 May; Tegetthoff&#x27;s other two vessels, the corvette and the gunboat &quot;Seehund&quot;, were unavailable due to boiler trouble and a grounding, respectively. The Austrian and Prussian squadrons rendezvoused in Texel, the Netherlands, and Tegetthoff added &quot;Preussischer Adler&quot;, &quot;Blitz&quot;, and &quot;Basilisk&quot; to his force. Tegetthoff took his flotilla to attack the Danish North Sea Squadron.

On the morning of 7 May, Tegetthoff&#x27;s ships spotted the British frigate off the island of Heligoland; after Tegetthoff closed to determine that &quot;Aurora&quot; was a neutral warship, he took his squadron to anchor off the island of Sylt. &quot;Aurora&quot;, commanded by Francis Leopold McClintock, encountered Suenson&#x27;s squadron the next day. McClintock informed Suenson of the last known location of the Austro-Prussian squadron. In the meantime, Tegetthoff had proceeded further to Cuxhaven, at the mouth of the Elbe, to replenish his fuel stores.

==The battle==

Early on 9 May, Tegetthoff received word that the Danish squadron was cruising off Helgoland. He immediately sortied, and by 10:00 approached the Danish warships. Shortly after 10:00, lookouts aboard the Danish vessels spotted smoke from Tegetthoff&#x27;s ships approaching from the south. Three hours later, the two squadrons were in visual range, and &quot;Aurora&quot;, which had been observing the Danish squadron, took up a position to delineate the neutral waters around the island. A little after 13:30, the Austrian, Prussian, and Danish commanders all ordered their crews to clear for action. The Austro-Prussian squadron opened fire first, at 13:57, with &quot;Schwarzenberg&quot;″s bow guns at a range of about . The two squadrons, in line ahead formation with the Prussian vessels lagging behind, closed to about and passed in opposite directions, firing broadsides at each other. A shell from &quot;Niels Juel&quot; struck &quot;Schwarzenberg&quot; and killed or wounded most of the men on one of her starboard guns.

Tegettoff turned his ships back to the south to chase Suenson, who in turn altered course to try to cut off the Prussian gunboats. As &quot;Schwarzenberg&quot; turned, the distance closed to just over , and she came under fire from all three Danish vessels. &quot;Jylland&quot; and &quot;Hejmdal&quot; then shifted fire to &quot;Radetzky&quot;. The Prussian vessels remained on the disengaged side of the Austrian frigates, firing at the Danish vessels with little effect. One of the Austrian vessels scored a hit on &quot;Jylland&quot; that killed or wounded all the men in one of her gun crews. The crews of the guns on either side fled their positions at the sight of the carnage until one of the men returned, calling his comrades to join him. During this period of the battle, &quot;Schwarzenberg&quot; suffered multiple shell hits and was set afire three times. Her crew extinguished the first two, but the third, in her foretopsail, proved to be too difficult to fight.

By 16:00, &quot;Schwarzenberg&quot; began to withdraw from the action, her forward rigging and forecastle burning badly. Tegetthoff decided to break off the engagement and fled to the neutral waters around Heligoland. As Tegetthoff&#x27;s ships began to withdraw, one of them scored a hit on &quot;Jylland&quot;″s rudder, which prevented Suenson from being able to effectively pursue the retreating Austrians and Prussians. McClintock took &quot;Aurora&quot; between the two squadrons to deter Suenson from pursuing Tegetthoff in violation of British neutrality. The two Austrian frigates had suffered a total of 36 men killed and 108 wounded; of those 31 killed and 81 wounded aboard &quot;Schwarzenberg&quot;—and both vessels were damaged. The Danish vessels suffered 14 men killed and 54 wounded, and only &quot;Niels Juel&quot; was damaged in the action. The battle was the last to be fought solely by wooden warships, and it was also the last major naval action to involve the Danish Navy.

==Aftermath==

Suenson waited outside the British zone of , but the Austrian-Prussian squadron was able to escape during the night to Cuxhaven, arriving at about 04:00 on 10 May. On reaching the port, the Austrian ships began to repair the damage sustained in the battle. Suenson sent his casualties ashore and resumed patrolling in the southern North Sea, between Heligoland and the Elbe. The day of the battle, the two sides had signed an armistice in London that took effect on 12 May, temporarily ending the fighting. The armistice lasted until 26 June, when fighting broke out again on land. The following day, a second Austrian squadron, which included the ship of the line &quot;Kaiser&quot;, the armored frigate &quot;Don Juan d&#x27;Austria&quot;, and two smaller vessels under Vice Admiral Bernhard von Wüllerstorf-Urbair arrived to reinforce Tegetthoff&#x27;s ships. The now outnumbered Danish fleet remained in port for the rest of the war and did not seek battle with the Austro-Prussian squadron. Instead, the Austrian and Prussian naval forces supported operations to capture the islands off the western Danish coast. These advances, coupled with the capture of the island of Als in the Baltic Sea, forced the Danes to seek a second armistice on 29 June.

Denmark claimed to have won the Battle of Heligoland, though they were no longer able to enforce a blockade on the northern German ports. Tegetthoff himself claimed a draw, but he was promoted to rear admiral as a reward for his actions during the battle. The opinions of naval historians on the outcome of the battle are similarly mixed; Anthony Sokol, a historian of the Austrian Navy, states that &quot;In spite of the damage they had sustained, the Austrians had won a strategic victory&quot;, citing the fact that the Danish blockade had been lifted. John Greene and Allesandro Massignani state that &quot;Heligoland was Tegetthoff&#x27;s day&quot;, though noting that Suenson could have won a victory had &quot;Jylland&quot; not been rendered unmaneuverable at the end of the action. On the other hand, David Zabecki affirms the argument that the battle &quot;was a tactical Danish victory&quot;, while noting the lifting of the blockade. David Olivier described the battle as inconclusive, though also noted the end of the blockade.

&quot;Jylland&quot; is today located in a drydock in a maritime museum in Ebeltoft, Denmark. She is the last surviving screw-driven, wooden-hulled warship. In Copenhagen, at Nyboder, there is a monument commemorating Suenson. A German memorial to the Austrian sailors who died in the battle was erected in Ritzebüttel, Cuxhaven.

<text>Process-oriented psychology, also called process work, is a depth psychology theory and set of techniques developed by Arnold Mindell and associated with transpersonal psychology, somatic psychology and post-Jungian psychology. Process oriented psychology has been applied in contexts including individual therapy and working with groups and organisations. It is known for extending dream analysis to body experiences and for applying psychology to world issues including socioeconomic disparities, diversity issues, social conflict and leadership.

==Origins and reception==
Process oriented psychology was originated in the 1970s by Arnold Mindell, an American Jungian analyst then living in Switzerland. It began as a development of Jungian psychology with the concept of a &#x27;dreambody&#x27; that extended dream analysis to include work with people&#x27;s body symptoms and bodily experiences. Jungian analyst June Singer commented that Mindell&#x27;s work &#x27;expands the scope of Jung&#x27;s psychology to include not only the psyche but also the body, relationships and the total environment.&#x27; Stanislav Grof has described Arnold Mindell as one of the &#x27;pioneers of transpersonal psychology&#x27;. Mindell&#x27;s concepts of &#x27;deep democracy&#x27; and &#x27;worldwork&#x27; have been identified as part of a toolkit for transformational change which supports collective governance.

In a critical exploration of the relationship between African Americans and C.G. Jung&#x27;s analytical psychology, Fanny Brewster describes Mindell&#x27;s dreambody work and his linking of body symptoms and psychological development. Brewster finds that Mindell&#x27;s development of Jungian ideas is aligned with traditional African concepts of healing which link mind and body: 
: ‘I believe that Mindell’s approach to dreamwork with its emphasis on body healing mirrors the African system of healing’s inclusiveness of body and mind in the process.’

Process Work is recognised within the field of body psychotherapy and somatic psychology with its emphasis on movement and body feeling. Mindell was one of five people honored in 2012 with a Pioneer Award from the US Association of Body Psychotherapy. Following the publication of his book &quot;Dreambody&quot; in 1982, it reportedly gained a &#x27;worldwide following in the field of holistic healing&#x27; although remaining little known in &#x27;traditional psychological circles&#x27;.

Process Work is described as an integrative and holistic approach to understanding human behaviours. It is characterized as creative and improvisational: a &#x27;fluid, flexible, playful approach, using some basic principles to improvise effective approaches to whatever comes its way, even-handedly weaving together the personal, political, the bodily, the relational and the spiritual aspects of existence.&#x27; It is considered to have similarities with Eugene Gendlin&#x27;s Focusing and is identified with a focus on the unknown aspects of experience:

:&#x27;Process Work ... seeks to encounter with the unknown and the irrational side of life. ... [It] appreciates symptoms and disturbances of any sort, not as pathologies to be healed or transcended or somehow got rid of, but as expressions of the very thing we need for our further growth, happiness, or enlightenment.&#x27;

From its original &#x27;dreambody&#x27; concept, Process Work developed a theory and method of working with altered states of consciousness including near death and coma, and with experiences given psychiatric diagnoses. Mindell&#x27;s book on coma and palliative care inspired a UK theatre production performed in Edinburgh and London. Process Work and Arnold Mindell are also known for a theory and methods for working with conflict resolution and leadership issues, in groups and organisations.

Process oriented psychology has been associated with alternative spirituality movements. It is considered an example of a modern Western eclectic adaptation of shamanism and has been taught at the Findhorn community in north-east Scotland. Fred Alan Wolf cites Mindell&#x27;s &#x27;dreambody&#x27; concept and the Institute of Noetic Sciences lists Mindell in their directory.

==Theory and practices==

===Process===
The theory of process oriented psychology centres around the idea of &#x27;process&#x27;: a meaningful, connected pattern over time that can be observed and tracked through non-intentional signals (e.g. non-verbal communication, body symptoms, dreams, accidents, conflicts). It is claimed that becoming consciously aware of the &#x27;dreaming process&#x27; may help to deal with disturbances including mental and physical distress, relationship troubles and social issues. The theory of a &#x27;dreaming process&#x27; began with Arnold Mindell&#x27;s concept of the &#x27;dreambody&#x27;, developed from Jungian dream analysis and the observation that dreams and body symptoms were meaningfully connected. Mindell asserted that a therapist could work with body experiences to reveal the unconscious just as they could work with dreams.

Process Work&#x27;s contention of a link between dreams and body symptoms is a viewpoint similar to shamanism, &#x27;mankind&#x27;s oldest medicinal doctrine, where illness reflects one&#x27;s spiritual condition&#x27;. Mindell&#x27;s theory has also been compared to another Jungian, Meredith Sabini, who similarly recognises a symbolic relationship between dream images and physical symptoms, and values their role in bringing awareness of a person&#x27;s individuation process, the development of the Jungian Self. Mindell is recognised for providing a method of working psychologically with body symptoms using the technique of &#x27;amplification&#x27;; this involves intensifying the experience of a symptom or a dream and following its expression through the various &#x27;channels&#x27; of perception until the meaning of the &#x27;dreambody&#x27; is revealed to the client.

The idea of a &#x27;dreambody&#x27; was generalised to the concept of a &#x27;dreaming process&#x27;: a potentially meaningful pattern within symptoms, dreams and other irrational or disturbing aspects of our experience. Totton explains that for process oriented psychology, &#x27;dreaming&#x27; refers to any &#x27;extra-conscious signals through which our process communicates itself&#x27;. The signals of a &#x27;dreaming process&#x27; go beyond nighttime dreams and body symptoms to include &#x27;daydreams, imagery and flickers of awareness that come and go&#x27;. For Process Work, &#x27;dreaming&#x27; can be defined as &#x27;the unconscious activity of the person, both when they are asleep and when they are awake&#x27;. Shafton comments that Mindell, along with Walter Bonime, Fritz Perls, Strephon Williams, Jeremy Taylor and Eugene Gendlin, makes the assumption that &#x27;dreamlike symbolic processes occur in waking&#x27; and accordingly applies dreamwork techniques to aspects of conscious experience.

The &#x27;dreaming process&#x27; is believed to have a meaningful, purposeful direction of change, reflecting the influence of Taoism and Jungian psychology. The dreaming process can be understood as the Jungian unconscious &#x27;seeking integration, and ... creating opportunities for the individual to grow in conscious awareness&#x27;.

An important conceptual distinction for process oriented psychology is between the &#x27;primary&#x27; (intended) and the &#x27;secondary&#x27; (unintended) aspects of a given behaviour or experience:
:people at any given moment experienc[e] a &#x27;primary process&#x27; — aspects of our experience with which we identify — and a &#x27;secondary process&#x27; — aspects with which we find it hard to identify and which are trying insistently to enter our awareness. 
For an individual, the primary or intended aspects of communication and behaviour will be shaped by conscious norms and values, while secondary processes will include disturbing, challenging or irrational experiences that are further from awareness and often overtly marginalised. Process Work aims to integrate secondary processes into a person&#x27;s primary, conscious awareness to reduce the disturbance and access its potential for meaning and growth.

Process Work theory includes a framework of experiential &#x27;channels&#x27; through which the dreaming process is expressed; these channels include the visual, auditory, movement (kinaesthetic), body feeling (proprioceptive), relationship and world channels. Like Gestalt therapy, Process Work tracks a person&#x27;s experience as it shifts between different channels. Process Work is particularly known for using the channels of body awareness, movement and physical contact to explore psychological issues. The concept of a purposeful &#x27;dreaming process&#x27; expressing itself through multiple &#x27;channels&#x27; of experience is the theoretical basis for Process Work&#x27;s &#x27;far-reaching and flexible approach, which uses essentially the same capacious toolbox to work with everything from bodily symptoms to couple relationships to political conflicts&#x27;.

The theory and contentions of process oriented psychology have been described as an alternative to mainstream psychology. Process Work proposes that disturbing feelings, symptoms and behaviours be interpreted as &#x27;an underlying urge toward health, wholeness, and diversity rather than pathology&#x27;. The theory suggests understanding the meaning of symptoms and disturbances rather than only focusing on modifying or eliminating them.

===Worldwork and deep democracy===
The application of process oriented psychology to group issues is called &#x27;worldwork&#x27; and a key concept is &#x27;deep democracy&#x27;. Worldwork includes theory and practices for working with conflict, leadership and social issues. Brown and Harris (2014) explain:
:Deep democracy was developed as a means of approaching the relationships among individual, organisational and social transformational change which support collective governance. Amy and Arnold Mindell&#x27;s world work framework draws on relativity concepts from physics to heighten awareness of the relationship element in all experience. A central concept is the validity of subjective inner and observable outer experience as two sides of the same coin.
Process Work applications for groups have become known through Mindell&#x27;s books: &quot;The Leader as Martial Artist: An Introduction to Deep Democracy&quot; (1992) and &quot;Sitting in the Fire: Large Group Transformation Using Conflict and Diversity&quot; (1995) Mindell&#x27;s ideas of worldwork and deep democracy have been likened to the work of Danaan Parry.

For process oriented psychology, the concept of &#x27;deep democracy&#x27; refers to a &#x27;belief in the inherent importance of all parts of ourselves and all viewpoints in the world around us&#x27;. It aims to broaden the idea of democracy to include not only cognitive, rational viewpoints but also emotional experiences and intuition: &#x27;Deep democracy awareness welcomes inner voices and makes use of diversity and existing tensions to access subjective experience, deeper vision and tangible results of the participants.&#x27; Similarly, the author John Bradshaw explains: 
:Deep democracy, as the psychologist Arnold Mindell points out in his book, &quot;The Leader as Martial Artist&quot;, is a timeless feeling of shared compassion for all living beings. It is a sense of the value and importance of the whole, including and especially our own personal reality. Deeply democratic people value every organ in their body as well as their inner feelings, needs, desires, thoughts and dreams.

This use of the term &#x27;deep democracy&#x27; is distinct from that of Arjun Appadurai and Judith M. Green in community development and that of Haider A. Khan in economic theory.

Worldwork includes group techniques for developing awareness of social issues like racism and has been used to deal with post-conflict trauma. Worldwork has been described as the &#x27;attempt to apply psychotherapy in the sphere of political conflict without privileging the therapeutic over the political&#x27;, because it takes on the challenge of supporting all sides of a conflict while dealing with the real politics of inequality. Totton notes that &#x27;so far worldwork has not resolved this problem—perhaps it cannot be resolved, but only held in continual tension&#x27;. Similarly, Worldwork has been described as &#x27;group therapy in public&#x27;: a group work technique aiming to bring awareness to &#x27;the hidden emotional undercurrents surrounding social issues — like racism — that are rarely addressed publicly&#x27;. Totton comments that worldwork is &#x27;difficult: experimental, stirring, demanding every ounce of flexibility and awareness from all the participants ... but also tremendously hopeful&#x27;.

An example of &#x27;worldwork&#x27; with social tensions in large groups was reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. In 1992, a racially diverse group of 200 people gathered in Oakland, CA to explore racial tensions, using Process Work techniques. This reportedly involved the expression of pain, anger and grief in a public forum with a focus on authentic, personal dialogue between individuals from opposing sides of a social issue. The Chronicle comments: 
:Using role-playing exercises, body awareness and other techniques, Mindell tries to intensify the conflict under controlled situations — hoping that through some cathartic process, conflict will reconcile itself.

The Chronicle reports that the group moved from angry heated conflict between a black and a white man, to a black man emotionally expressing his grief and pain, and finally the group &#x27;melted into one giant, wailing, hugging mass of black and white humanity&#x27;.

The Process Work approach to leadership and conflict facilitation is based on the idea of deep democracy; it tries to build awareness of the bigger picture and develop compassion for all sides in a conflict, an approach that Mindell refers to as &#x27;eldership&#x27;. Process oriented psychology is known for a positive model of conflict, seeing it as an opportunity for growth and community; Mindell, like the authors Thomas Crum and Danaan Parry, suggests that dealing with personal conflicts better can create global change. The model of conflict resolution involves identifying the sides in the conflict as roles and having the conflicting parties experiment with expressing all roles, swapping sides until greater understanding is achieved. Conflict is understood as a sign that at least one viewpoint or experience within the group is not being adequately represented and Process Work aims to bring these &#x27;ghosts&#x27; into conscious awareness and dialogue.

====Lewis Method of Deep Democracy====
Lewis Method of Deep Democracy is based on the work of Arnold Mindell. In the early 1990s two of Arnold Mindell’s students, Myrna Lewis and her late husband, Greg, began translating some of the tools. Lewis&#x27;s Method of Deep Democracy is more flexible about the depth.

====Patricia A. Wilson&#x27;s Deep Democracy====
Wilson has more focus on inner work and building the container for a culture of dialogue and connectedness. She summarizes essence of deep democracy as &quot;the inner experience of interconnectedness&quot;.

====Judith M. Green&#x27;s Deep Democracy====
Green describes &quot;Deep Democracy would equip people to expect, to understand, and to value diversity and change while preserving and projecting both democratically humane cultural values and interactively sustainable environmental values in a dynamic responsive way.&quot;

==Research==
Process oriented psychology is one of eleven psychotherapeutic modalities examined in a Swiss longitudinal study of therapeutic effectiveness completed in 2012. There are published studies of the clinical application of Process Work to group therapy with people experiencing mental illness and to the care of elders with dementia. A Japanese case study has described the application of process oriented psychology to the treatment of a woman with symptoms including major depression and an eating disorder, concluding that the method can be effective in the resolution of psychosomatic problems. Process Work has been used to extend play therapy techniques and found to enrich therapeutic work with children experiencing parental separation issues. The process oriented psychology approach to clinical supervision has been documented and shown to offer experiential and phenomenological techniques to work with signals, roles and the &quot;parallel dynamics&quot; that occur within client-counsellor and counsellor-supervisor interactions. It has been suggested that the concept of ‘metaskills’ can be useful for the psychotherapist seeking to serve polyamorous clients. Connections have been established between process oriented psychology and dance movement therapy.

The concept of ‘rank’ as defined and developed by Mindell has been taken up in a number of contexts including action learning, the analysis of international nongovernmental organization advocacy campaigns, and anti-racism diversity work.
An Australian case study has considered the use of process oriented psychology for tackling the problems of intercultural communication in higher education; it finds that Process Work has a multidimensional concept of social rank (expanded beyond social status to include &#x27;psychological&#x27; and &#x27;spiritual&#x27; aspects) which promotes understanding of interpersonal communication issues and could be used to improve international student experience in Australia.

==Organisations==
Process oriented psychology is represented by a professional organisation called the International Association of Practitioners of Process Oriented Psychology (IAPOP). The Association recognises over 25 training centres around the world including the UK, Australia &amp; New Zealand, Poland, Switzerland, Slovakia, Ireland, Japan, India, Greece, Israel, Palestine, Russia, Ukraine and the US. 
The first teaching organisation was founded in Zürich in 1982 and is now known as the Institute for Process Work (Institut für Prozessarbeit IPA), an accredited Training Institute for psychotherapy in Switzerland. 
The Research Society for Process Oriented Psychology in the UK (RSPOPUK)&#x27;s Training Programme is accredited by the United Kingdom Council of Psychotherapy, within the Humanistic and Integrative Psychotherapy Section. 
In the US, the first training centre was established in 1989 in Portland, Oregon, now known as the Process Work Institute, while the Deep Democracy Institute was founded in 2006. The newest Institute for Processwork was founded 2018 in Germany (Institut für Prozessarbeit Deutschland).

==Criticism and early controversy==

Criticisms of process oriented psychology include that the &#x27;dreambody&#x27; concept and techniques are too subjective and overly positive. Mindell&#x27;s concept of the meaningful &#x27;dreambody&#x27; has been criticised for coming &#x27;perilously close&#x27; to psychologising every illness; Shafton values &#x27;dreambody work&#x27; but cautions that body symptoms are ambiguous and may be a product of stress or denial as much as a message for growth. 
Others have claimed that Process Work as a therapy is hard to define and has similarities with &#x27;faith healing&#x27;, raising hopes about the healing of physical illness (though it is reported that Mindell explicitly discourages this idea). Like other transpersonal psychologies, process oriented psychology has been identified by critics as a method having &#x27;a mystical or supernaturalistic application, theory, significance, or pedigree.&#x27; In 1997, a Japanese scientist involved in deprogramming members of the Aum Shinrikyo cult mentioned process oriented psychology as an example of recent psychotherapeutic paradigms that draw on Asian philosophy, Gestalt, Jung and transpersonal psychology, and claimed that, while &#x27;these programs are not substantively dangerous&#x27;, the methods may be used adversely and have the potential to be a form of &#x27;mind control&#x27;. He then clarified that process oriented psychology was not amongst those that were dangerous. Mindell&#x27;s (1993) book, &quot;Leader as Martial Artist&quot;, has been critiqued as a use of Eastern belief systems to justify capitalist business practice.

There has been controversy in the history of process oriented psychology in the US state of Oregon. In 1990, a Eugene newspaper, the Register-Guard, reported that a planning permit application for the coastal town of Yachats by the founder, Arnold Mindell, was met with initial apprehension and fears of &#x27;another Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh&#x27; although these fears were subsequently allayed. Twenty-three years later, in 2013, The Yachats Academy of Arts and Sciences invited Arnold and his wife Amy Mindell to offer a keynote lecture on their work on conflict resolution around the world.

In 2001, a Portland alternative newspaper, the Willamette Week guided by the complaint of a student, reported that an Oregon school of process oriented psychology, (one of 26 worldwide schools of process oriented psychology), the Process Work Center of Portland (now known as the Process Work Institute) was being investigated by the Oregon Office of Degree Authorization (ODA) due to a complaint by a student and an anonymous letter with the primary complaint that teachers in the Masters in Process Work shared student information inappropriately, and that relationship and sexual boundaries were not clear between students.&#x27; Some allegations were not verified while others were &quot;substantially correct&quot;. ODA recommended improvements in privacy policies and dual relationship policies between students and faculty. PWI complied with changes requested during the investigation and the degree remained continuously authorized by the state of Oregon degree authorization office. The Process Work Institute does not have regional accreditation and does not participate in DOE Title IV lending. Small schools in the Pacific NW are not eligible for regional accreditation unless they have 300 or more active students. PWI is currently pursuing national accreditation which is allowed in the US for smaller schools. Other schools of Process Work internationally such as in Switzerland, Poland, the UK, and Australia have been able to become accredited either regionally, nationally, or by psychological professional accrediting boards. The ODA website shows that in 2014 the Process Work Institute is authorised as a degree offering institution and lists PWI as one of the unaccredited private colleges approved for students in Oregon.

<doc id="909774" wikidata="Q716755" url="?curid=909774" title="English as She Is Spoke">
<text>, commonly known by the name English as She Is Spoke, is a 19th-century book written by Pedro Carolino, with some editions crediting José da Fonseca as a co-author. It was intended as a Portuguese–English conversational guide or phrase book. However, because the provided translations are usually inaccurate or unidiomatic, it is regarded as a classic source of unintentional humour in translation.

The humour largely arises from Carolino&#x27;s indiscriminate use of literal translation, which has led to many idiomatic expressions being translated ineptly. For example, Carolino translates the Portuguese phrase as &quot;raining in jars&quot;, when an analogous English idiom is available in the form of &quot;raining buckets&quot;.

It is widely believed that Carolino could not speak English and that a French–English dictionary was used to translate an earlier Portuguese–French phrase book , written by José da Fonseca. Carolino likely added Fonseca&#x27;s name to the book, without his permission, in an attempt to give it some credibility. The Portuguese–French phrase book is apparently a competent work, without the defects that characterize the Portuguese–English one.

The title &quot;English as She Is Spoke&quot; was given to the book in its 1883 republication, but the phrase does not appear in the original phrasebook, nor does the word &quot;spoke&quot;.

==Cultural appraisals and influence==
Mark Twain said of &quot;English as She Is Spoke&quot; &quot;Nobody can add to the absurdity of this book, nobody can imitate it successfully, nobody can hope to produce its fellow; it is perfect.&quot;

Stephen Pile mentions this work in &quot;The Book of Heroic Failures&quot; and comments: &quot;Is there anything in conventional English which could equal the vividness of &quot;″to a marmoset″&quot;?&quot; The original has &quot;to craunch the marmoset&quot;, an entry under the book&#x27;s &quot;Idiotisms and Proverbs&quot;. This is the author&#x27;s attempt to translate the French slang idiomatic expression , used to indicate &quot;waiting patiently for someone to open a door&quot;, with referring to the &quot;knocking&quot; or &quot;rapping&quot; sound, and , a term for the grotesque door knockers in vogue at the time. &quot;Craunch&quot; is an archaic term meaning &#x27;to chew&#x27; or &#x27;crunch&#x27;. In Modern French, usually means &quot;to crunch&quot; (cf. croque monsieur); its use in this idiom is a survival from the Middle French meaning of , , which meant &quot;to slap, hit, strike&quot;.

Tristan Bernard wrote a very short comedy with a similar name, (1899). Ionesco&#x27;s (1950) is mostly made of lines used out-of-context from inter-lingual conversation books. British comedy television series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; made use of the theme of the mistranslating guide in the sketch &quot;Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook&quot; (1970), which may have been inspired by &quot;English as She Is Spoke&quot;.

==Phrase examples==
In addition to the examples above, Carolino managed to create a number of words which added to the book&#x27;s unintentionally comic effect. Many can be found in the &quot;Familiar Dialogues&quot; section and include the above &quot;Sook here if I knew to tame hix&quot;.

==Contemporary allusions==
The phrase &quot;English as she is spoke&quot; is nowadays used allusively, in a form of linguistic play, as a stereotypical example of bad English grammar.

In January 1864, then US President Abraham Lincoln and Secretary of State William H. Seward laughed as Lincoln&#x27;s private secretary John Hay read aloud from the book. The book has been cited as one example of many diversions that Lincoln used to lighten his heart and mind from the weight of the US Civil War and his cabinet&#x27;s political infighting.

In Jerome K. Jerome&#x27;s book &quot;Three Men on the Bummel&quot;, set in the late 1800s, the character George comedically tries to use a badly written German–English phrasebook to do some shopping and errands around London. 

In the &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot; sketch &quot;Dirty Hungarian Phrasebook&quot;, a man unknowingly causes trouble by reading from a Hungarian–English phrasebook with deliberately mistranslated phrases that are absurd or inappropriate. The sketch ends with the publisher of the book being questioned in court. 

The English prog rock band Cardiacs used passages from the book in their 1999 album &quot;Guns&quot;, most notably in the songs &quot;Cry Wet Smile Dry&quot; and &quot;Sleep All Eyes Open.&quot;

A more subtle reference occurs in Series 3, Episode 10 &quot;The Affair at the Victory Ball&quot; of the series &quot;Agatha Christie&#x27;s Poirot&quot;. This episode ends with Poirot offering to give Inspector Japp &quot;my personal copy of &#x27;The English as She Should be Spoken.&#x27;&quot;

<doc id="909777" wikidata="Q5159273" url="?curid=909777" title="Conditional quantum entropy">
<text>The conditional quantum entropy is an entropy measure used in quantum information theory. It is a generalization of the conditional entropy of classical information theory. For a bipartite state formula_1, the conditional entropy is written formula_2, or formula_3, depending on the notation being used for the von Neumann entropy. The quantum conditional entropy was defined in terms of a conditional density operator formula_4 by Nicolas Cerf and Chris Adami, who showed that quantum conditional entropies can be negative, something that is forbidden in classical physics. The negativity of quantum conditional entropy is a sufficient criterion for quantum non-separability.

In what follows, we use the notation formula_5 for the von Neumann entropy, which will simply be called &quot;entropy&quot;.

== Definition ==

Given a bipartite quantum state formula_1, the entropy of the joint system AB is formula_7, and the entropies of the subsystems are formula_8 and formula_9. The von Neumann entropy measures an observer&#x27;s uncertainty about the value of the state, that is, how much the state is a mixed state.

By analogy with the classical conditional entropy, one defines the conditional quantum entropy as formula_10.

An equivalent operational definition of the quantum conditional entropy (as a measure of the quantum communication cost or surplus when performing quantum state merging) was given by Michał Horodecki, Jonathan Oppenheim, and Andreas Winter.

==Properties==

Unlike the classical conditional entropy, the conditional quantum entropy can be negative. This is true even though the (quantum) von Neumann entropy of single variable is never negative. The negative conditional entropy is also known as the coherent information, and gives the additional number of bits above the classical limit that can be transmitted in a quantum dense coding protocol. Positive conditional entropy of a state thus means the state cannot reach even the classical limit, while the negative conditional entropy provides for additional information.

<doc id="909794" wikidata="Q1642782" url="?curid=909794" title="Silvester de Everdon">
<text>Silvester de Everdon (died 1254) was a medieval Bishop of Carlisle and Lord Chancellor of England.

==Life==

Everdon came from the village of Everdon, near Daventry in Northamptonshire, but other than the fact that he was related to a locally prominent family of Thorp, nothing else is known of his ancestry. He was a priest in Northamptonshire from 1219. In 1229 he entered the service of Ralph Neville, who was Bishop of Chichester and Lord Chancellor, as a chancery clerk and continued on in the chancery until his election to Carlisle. In 1244 Everdon became Lord Chancellor (holding the post until 1246) and in 1245 he became the Archdeacon of Chester. He was elected to the see of Carlisle about 1 September 1246 but declined the see. He probably declined the see because of concerns over being rewarded for secular work with a clerical office.

King Henry III of England seems to have persuaded Everdon that election was canonical, and he was elected again in November 1246 and accepted. Earlier, Matthew Paris had described Silvester as &quot;the king&#x27;s faithful clerk, dear and close, obtaining the first place in the chancery, where he served him wisely&quot; and certainly Henry would have had the ability to persuade Silvester to accept the bishopric. He was consecrated on 13 October 1247. During his time as bishop he worked to settle a long-standing dispute over the finances of the see between the bishop and the canons. He also served as a royal justice and attended parliament. He died in the spring of 1254, after being thrown from a horse near Northampton while on his way to the royal court.

Everdon is believed to be buried in the Temple Church in London.

<doc id="909803" wikidata="Q3698285" url="?curid=909803" title="Croft, Leicestershire">
<text>Croft is a village and civil parish in the Blaby district of Leicestershire, off the Fosse Way, straddling the River Soar. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 1,639. 

==Geography==
The village is about southwest of Leicester, in the Blaby District of Leicestershire. The civil parish covers an area of and nearby places include Stoney Stanton, Broughton Astley, Huncote and Narborough. 

Arbor Road and Broughton Road run from the B4114 (Fosse Way) into the village and Huncote Road runs towards the village of Huncote which lies to the other side of Croft Hill. The village comprises a mix of house types of various ages, factories and shops. The village has a primary school, parish church and public house. Croft Quarry occupies a site at the end of the older part of the village.

Next to the quarry is the natural Croft Hill, standing 128m high rising up the Soar flood-plain. It stands out as an isolated landmark almost at the physical centre of England, and has been used as a meeting place for centuries. The hill provides a number of habitats including broad leaved woodland, scrub land, acidic grassland and two other distinct areas of grassland. It is an important area in view of the variety of flora, fauna, birds and butterflies which inhabit or visit at various times of the year.

The New Hill, to the southeast of Croft Quarry, has been constructed out of quarry waste, and is being landscaped and planted to match the local flora.

==History==

It is local tradition that the parish stone pit at Croft, known as the Clevis, was originally a first-century Roman granite quarry used in the construction of the foundations and bridges of the Fosse Way.

Fenn states that the place-name Croft was first recorded in 836, and is derived from the Old English cræft, &quot;craft, a machine, engine&quot;. The craft in question could perhaps be that of quarrying. or a water wheel/mill. The occasion in 836 was an assembly at Croft when King Wiglaf of Mercia was joined by Archbishop of Canterbury Ceolnoth and eleven of his bishops and three abbots, besides twenty-two laymen of authority and influence. They gathered to witness the grant of land by Wiglaf to the monastery of Hanbury.

It has been suggested that the use of the Croft Hill for Royal Mercian assemblies makes it a candidate location for councils of the Clovesho.

In the 1920s, Croft Hill was used as a picnic spot for Sunday School trips and was popular with Leicester people, it being a short train journey from the surrounding areas.

<text>Civitavecchia (, meaning &quot;ancient town&quot;) is a city and major sea port on the Tyrrhenian Sea west-northwest of Rome. Its legal status is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) of Rome, Lazio.

The harbour is formed by two piers and a breakwater on which stands a lighthouse.

==History==
===Etruscan era===

The whole territory of Civitavecchia is dotted with the remains of Etruscan tombs and it is likely that in the centre of the current city a small Etruscan settlement thrived. The Etruscan necropolis of Mattonara, not far from the Molinari factory, is almost certainly from the 7th - 6th century BC and was most likely connected with the nearby necropolis of Scaglia. An ancient port formed by small parallel basins capable of accommodating single vessels was still visible at the end of the 19th century near Forte Michelangelo.

An Etruscan settlement on the hill of Ficoncella can still be seen. The first baths of the settlement were built there before 70 BC, and known by the Romans as Aquae Tauri.

===Roman era===

The nearby monumental baths at Terme Taurine were built originally in the Roman Republican era, possibly by Titus Statilius Taurus, prefect of Rome.

The harbour was greatly enlarged by the Emperor Trajan at the beginning of the 2nd century and became known as Centum Cellae, probably due to the many vaulted &quot;cells&quot; forming the harbour wall, some of which can still be seen. The first occurrence of the name Centum Cellae is from a letter by Pliny the Younger in AD 107. It has been suggested that the name could instead refer to the &quot;centum&quot; (&quot;hundred&quot;) halls of the extensive villa of Trajan which was nearby. The harbour was probably built by Trajan&#x27;s favourite architect, Apollodorus of Damascus (who also built the harbour of Ancona). The town was also known as Centum Cellae and was developed from the same time. Trajan&#x27;s sumptuous villa &quot;pulcherrima&quot; (most beautiful, according to Pliny) must have been built at the same time but traces have yet to be found, although the Terme Taurine baths and the large cistern nearby are likely to have been included. Pliny was summoned by Trajan to his villa there for an exceptional meeting there of the &quot;consilium principis&quot; (advisory council) which normally took place in Rome, and which indicates the status of the villa as an imperial residence. The villa was also used later by the young Marcus Aurelius, probably in the years 140-145 who built a &quot;vivarium&quot; there and also in 173 by Commodus.

Inscriptions from between the 2nd and 3rd centuries from a cemetery near the Roman harbour prove the presence of &quot;classiari&quot;, sailors from the navy, and also of a noble class. They also tell of the number and type of ships which were detachments of the fleets of Ravenna and of Misenum.

In 251 Pope Cornelius was imprisoned in Centumcellae during the persecutions of Decius and his successor Trebonianus Gallus and died there in 253.

In the 4th and 5th centuries the city and port became even more prosperous and busy, as Rutilius Namatianus described it in 414 as it became an important port of Rome due to the silting of Ostia.

In the 530s, &quot;Centumcellae&quot; was a Byzantine stronghold and until 553 the city suffered in the wars between the Goths and the Byzantines.

===Later history===

It became part of the Papal States in 728 and Pope Gregory III  refortified Centumcellae. As the port was raided by the Saracens in 813–814, 828, 846 and finally in 876, a new settlement in a more secure place was therefore built by order of Pope Leo IV as soon as 854. In the meantime, however, the inhabitants returned to the old town by the shore in 889 and rebuilt it, giving it the name &quot;Civitas Vetus&quot;. The Popes gave the settlement as a fief to several local lords, including the Count Ranieri of Civitacastellana and the Abbey of Farfa, and the Di Vico, who held &quot;Centumcellae&quot; in 1431. In that year, pope Eugene IV sent an army under cardinal Giovanni Vitelleschi and several condottieri (Niccolò Fortebraccio, Ranuccio Farnese and Menicuccio dell&#x27;Aquila among them) to recapture the place, which, after the payment of 4,000 florins, became thenceforth a full Papal possession, led by a vicar and a treasurer.

The place became a free port under Pope Innocent XII in 1696 and by the modern era was the main port of Rome. The French Empire occupied it in 1806. 

The French novelist Stendhal served as consul for a time in Civitavecchia.

On 16 April 1859 the Rome and Civitavecchia railway was opened for service.

The Papal troops opened the gates of the fortress to the Italian general Nino Bixio in 1870. This permanently removed the port from papal control.

During World War II, the Allies launched several bombing raids against Civitavecchia, which damaged the city and inflicted several civilian casualties. On June 27, 1944, two American soldiers from the 379th Port Battalion, Fred A. McMurray and Louis Till, allegedly raped two Italian women in Civitavecchia and murdered a third. McMurray and Till were subsequently both executed by the United States Army by hanging five months later.

==Economy==

Civitavecchia is today a major cruise and ferry port, the main starting point for sea connection from central Italy to Sardinia, Sicily, Tunis and Barcelona. Fishing has a secondary importance.

The city is also the seat of two thermal power stations. The conversion of one of them to coal has raised the population&#x27;s protests, as it is feared it could create heavy pollution.

==Main sights==

=== Roman city ===

The modern inner harbour (darsena) rests on ancient foundations many of which can be seen and whose shape is still very much the same as it was in Trajan&#x27;s time. It had a curved breakwater on the southern side and a straight one to the north with arches to reduce the waves which still exist.

The is the only remaining Tower of four large Roman round towers that served as beacons around the ancient harbour. Remains of warehouses can be seen between the large basin and the inner harbour (darsena), still used during the Middle Ages.

A section of the Via Aurelia running along the harbour, 6 m wide and at a depth of 3 m, was excavated. Some of the Roman city wall is visible in the basement of the Fraternity of the Banner in the Piazza Leandra. Remains of an aqueduct and a large cistern, possibly part of Trajan&#x27;s villa, are preserved.

North of the city at Ficoncella are the Terme Taurine baths frequented by Romans and still popular with the Civitavecchiesi. The modern name stems from the common fig plants among the various pools.

Also at Ficoncella nearby are the baths of Aquae Tauri from the earlier Etruscan and early Roman settlement. A larger building of 160x100 m enclosed the baths and is being excavated.

===Other sights===

The massive &quot;Forte Michelangelo&quot; was first commissioned from Donato Bramante by Pope Julius II, to defend the port of Rome. The upper part of the &quot;maschio&quot; tower, however, was designed by Michelangelo, whose name is generally applied to the fortress. Pius IV added a convict prison, and the arsenal, designed by Bernini, was built by Alexander VII. 

Major cruise lines start and end their cruises at this location, and others stop for shore excursion days to visit Rome and the Vatican, ninety minutes away.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Civitavecchia experiences a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;).

==Transport==

The Port of Civitavecchia, also known as &quot;Port of Rome&quot;, is an important hub for the maritime transport in Italy, for goods and passengers. Part of the &quot;Motorways of the Sea&quot;, it is linked to several Mediterranean ports and represents one of the main links between Italian mainland to Sardinia.

Civitavecchia railway station, opened in 1859, is the western terminus of the Rome–Civitavecchia railway, which forms part of the Pisa–Livorno–Rome railway.
A short line linking the town center to the harbour survived until the early 2000s. It counted two stations: Civitavecchia Marittima, serving the port, and Civitavecchia Viale della Vittoria.

Civitavecchia is served by the A12, an unconnected motorway linking Rome to Genoa and by the State highway SS1 &quot;Via Aurelia&quot;, which also links the two stretches. The town is also interested by a project regarding a new motorway, the Civitavecchia-Venice or &quot;New Romea&quot;, nowadays completed as a dual carriageway between Viterbo and Ravenna (via Terni, Perugia and Cesena) and commonly known in Italy as the &quot;Orte-Ravenna&quot;.

==Education==
The commune has multiple preschools, primary schools, junior high schools, and high schools. Polo Universitario di Civitavecchia is located in the city.

<text>Sibawayh ( (also pronounced in many modern dialects) ; &#x27; ; ), whose full name isAbu Bishr Amr ibn Uthman ibn Qanbar al-Basri(,&#x27;), was a Persian leading grammarian of Basra and author of the Third book on Arabic grammar. His famous unnamed work, referred to as &quot;Al-Kitāb&quot;, or &quot;The Book&quot;, is a five-volume seminal discussion of the Arabic language.

Ibn Qutaybah, the earliest extant source, in his biographical entry under &quot;Sibawayh&quot; simply wrote:
He is Amr ibn Uthman, and he was mainly a grammarian. He arrived in Baghdad, fell out with the local grammarians, was humiliated, went back to some town in Persia, and died there while still a young man.

The tenth-century biographers Ibn al-Nadim and Abu Bakr al-Zubaydi, and in the 13th-century Ibn Khallikan, attribute Sibawayh with contributions to the science of the Arabic language and linguistics that were unsurpassed by those of earlier and later times. He has been called the greatest of all Arabic linguists and one of the greatest linguists of all time in any language.

==Biography==
Born circa 143/760, Sibawayh was from Shiraz, in today&#x27;s Fars province, Iran. Reports vary, some saying he went first to Basra, then to Baghdad, and finally back to the village of al-Baida near Shiraz where he died between 177/793 and 180/796, while another says he died in Basra in 161/777.
His Persian nickname &quot;Sibuyeh&quot;, arabized as &quot;Sībawayh(i)&quot;, means &quot;scent of apples&quot; coming from the Persian root word &quot;sib&quot; meaning apple and reportedly refers to his &quot;sweet breath.&quot; A protégé of the Banu Harith b. Ka&#x27;b b. &#x27;Amr b. &#x27;Ulah b. Khalid b. Malik b. Udad, he learned the dialects (languages) from Abu al-Khattab al-Akhfash al-Akbar (the Elder) and others. He came to Iraq in the days of Harun al-Rashid when he was thirty-two years old and died in Persia when he was over forty. He was a student of the two eminent grammarians Yunus ibn Habib and Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi, the latter of whom he was most indebted.

==Debates==
Despite Sibawayh&#x27;s renowned scholarship, his status as a non-native speaker of the language is a central feature in the many anecdotes included in the biographies. The accounts throw useful light on early contemporary debates which influenced the formulation of the fundamental principles of Arabic grammar.

===The Question of the Hornet===
In a story from the debate held by the Abbasid vizier Yahya ibn Khalid of Baghdad on standard Arabic usage, Sibawayh, representing the Basra school of grammar, and al-Kisa&#x27;i, one of the canonical Quran readers and the leading figure in the rival school of Kufa, had a dispute on the following point of grammar, which later became known as المسألة الزنبورية &quot;al-Mas’alah al-Zunbūrīyah&quot; (&quot;The Question of the Hornet&quot;).

The discussion involved the final clause of the sentence:
: 
: &quot;I have always thought that the scorpion was more painful in stinging than the hornet, and sure enough it is.&quot;

Both Sibawayh and al-Kisa&#x27;i agreed that it involved an omitted verb, but disagreed on the specific construct to be used.

Sibawayh proposed finishing it with &quot;fa-&#x27;iḏā huwa hiya&quot; (), literally &quot;and-thus he [is] she&quot;, using &quot;he&quot; for the scorpion (a masculine noun in Arabic) and &quot;she&quot; for &quot;stinging, bite&quot; (a feminine noun), arguing that Arabic does not need or use any verb-form like &quot;is&quot; in the present tense, and that object forms like &quot;(&#x27;iyyā-)hā&quot; are never the main part of a predicate.

Al-Kisa&#x27;i argued instead for &quot;fa-&#x27;iḏā huwa &#x27;iyyā-hā&quot; (), literally &quot;and-thus he [does] onto-her&quot;, supporting the object pronoun &quot;-hā&quot; (&quot;her&quot;) with the particle &quot;&#x27;iyyā-&quot;. The grammatical constructions of the debate may be compared to a similar point in the grammar of modern English: &quot;it is she&quot; vs. &quot;it is her&quot;, which is still a point of some disagreement today.

To Sibawayh&#x27;s dismay, al-Kisa&#x27;i soon ushered in four Bedouins who had &quot;happened&quot; to be waiting near the door. Each testified that &quot;huwa &#x27;iyyā-hā&quot; was the proper usage and so Sibawayh&#x27;s was judged incorrect. After this, he left the court, and was said to have returned in indignation to Shiraz where he died soon, apparently either from upset or illness.

A student of Sibawayh&#x27;s, al-Akhfash al-Asghar (Akhfash the Younger), is said to have challenged al-Kisa&#x27;i after his teacher&#x27;s death asking him 100 questions on grammar, proving al-Kisa&#x27;i&#x27;s answers wrong each time. When the student revealed who he was and what had happened, al-Kisa&#x27;i approached the Caliph Harun al-Rashid and requested punishment from him knowing he had had a share in &quot;killing Sibawayh.&quot;

==Legacy==

Sibawayh&#x27;s &quot;Al-Kitab&quot; was the first formal and analytical Arabic grammar written by a non-native speaker of Arabic, i.e. as a foreign language. His application of logic to the structural mechanics of language was wholly innovative for its time. Both Sibawayh and his teacher al-Farahidi are historically the earliest and most significant figures in respect to the formal recording of the Arabic language. Much of the impetus for this work came from the desire of non-Arab Muslims for correct interpretation of the Quran and the development of &quot;tafsir&quot; (Quranic exegesis); The poetic language of the Qur&#x27;an presents interpretative challenges even to the native Arabic speaker. In Arabic, the final voiced vowel may occasionally be omitted, as in the Arabic pronunciation of the name &quot;Sibawayh&quot; where the name terminates as &quot;Sibuyeh&quot;. Discrepancies in pronunciation may occur where a text is read aloud (See &quot;harakat&quot;); these pronunciation variants pose particular issues for religious readings of Qur&#x27;anic scripture where correct pronunciation, or reading, of God&#x27;s Word is sacrosanct.

Later scholars of Arabic grammar came to be compared to Sibawayh. The name Niftawayh, a combination of &quot;nift&quot;, or asphalt – due to his dark complexion – and &quot;wayh&quot;, was given to him out of his love of Sibawayh&#x27;s works. Abu Turab al-Zahiri was referred to as the Sibawayh of the modern era due to the fact that, although he was of Arab descent, Arabic was not his mother tongue.

===&quot;Al-Kitāb&quot;===
&quot;Al-Kitāb&quot; or &quot;Kitāb Sībawayh&quot; (&#x27;Book of Sibawayh&#x27;), is the foundational grammar of the Arabic language, and perhaps the first Arabic prose text. Al-Nadim describes the voluminous work, reputedly the collaboration of forty-two grammarians, as &quot;unequaled before his time and unrivaled afterwards&quot;. Sibawayh was the first to produce a comprehensive encyclopedic Arabic grammar, in which he sets down the principles rules of grammar, the grammatical categories with countless examples taken from Arabic sayings, verse and poetry, as transmitted by Al-Khalil ibn Ahmad al-Farahidi, his master and the famous author of the first Arabic dictionary, &quot;Kitab al-&#x27;Ayn&quot;, and of many philological works on lexicography, diacritics, poetic meter (ʻarūḍ), cryptology, etc. Sibawayh&#x27;s book came from flourishing literary, philological and tafsir (Quranic exegetical) tradition that centred in the schools of Basra, Kufa and later at the Abbasid caliphal seat of Baghdad.
Al-Farahidi is referenced throughout &quot;Al-Kitāb&quot; always in the third person, in phrases such as &quot;I asked him&quot;, or &quot;he said&quot;. Sibawayh transmits quotes, mainly via Ibn Habib and al-Farahidi, of Abu ʻAmr ibn al-ʻAlāʼ 57 times, whom he never met. Sibawayh quotes his teacher Harun ibn Musa just five times.

====Grammarians of Basra====
Probably due to Sibawayh&#x27;s early death, &quot;no one&quot;, al-Nadim records, &quot;was known to have studied &quot;Al-Kitāb&quot; with Sibawayh,&quot; nor did he expound it as was the tradition. Sibawayh&#x27;s associate and pupil, Al-Akhfash al-Akbar, or al-Akhfash al-Mujashi&#x27;i, a learned grammarian of Basra of the Banu Mujashi ibn Darim, transcribed Sibawayh&#x27;s &quot;Al-Kitāb&quot; into manuscript form. Al-Akhfash studied &quot;Al-Kitāb&quot; with a group of student and grammarian associates including Abu &#x27;Umar al-Jarmi and Abu &#x27;Uthman al-Mazini, who circulated Sibawayh&#x27;s work, and developed the science of grammar, writing many books of their own and commentaries, such as al-Jarmi&#x27;s &quot;(Commentary on) The Strange in Sibawayh&quot;. Of the next generation of grammarians, Al-Mubarrad developed the work of his masters and wrote an &quot;Introduction to Sibawayh&quot;, &quot;Thorough Searching (or Meaning) of &quot;the Book&quot; of Sibawayh&quot;, and &quot;Refutation of Sibawayh&quot;. Al-Mubarrad is quoted as posing the question to anyone preparing to read the &quot;Book&quot;,
::&quot;Have you ridden through grammar, appreciating its vastness and meeting with the difficulties of its contents?&quot;
Al-Mabriman of al-&#x27;Askar Mukram and Abu Hashim debated educational approaches to the exposition of &quot;Al-Kitāb&quot;. Among Al-Mabriman&#x27;s books of grammar was &quot;An Explanation of &quot;the Book&quot; of Sibawayh&quot; (incomplete). Al-Mubarrad&#x27;s pupil and tutor to the children of the Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tadid, Ibn as-Sarī az-Zajjāj wrote a &quot;Commentary on the Verses of Sibawayh&quot;, focusing on Sibawayh&#x27;s use of both pre- and post-Islamic poetry. Al-Zajjaj&#x27;s pupil, Abu Bakr ibn al-Sarraj, also wrote a &quot;Commentary on Sibawayh&quot;. In an anecdote about Ibn al-Sarraj being reprimanded for an error, he is said to have replied &quot;you have trained me, but I&#x27;ve been neglecting what I studied while reading this book (meaning Sibawayh&#x27;s &quot;Al-Kitāb&quot;), because I&#x27;ve been diverted by logic and music, and now I&#x27;m going back to [Sibawayh and grammar]&quot;, after which he became the leading grammarian after al-Zajjaj, and wrote many books of scholarship. Ibn Durustuyah an associate and pupil of al-Mubarrad and Tha&#x27;lab wrote &quot;The Triumph of Sibawayh over All the Grammarians&quot;, comprising a number of sections but left unfinished. Al-Rummani also wrote a &quot;Commentary on Sibawayh&quot;. Al-Maraghi a pupil of al-Zajjaj, wrote &quot;Exposition and Interpretation of the Arguments of Sibawayh&quot;.

====Format====
Al-Kitāb, comprising 5 volumes, is a long and highly analytic and comprehensive treatment of grammar and remains largely untranslated into English. Due to its great unwieldiness and complexity the later grammarians produced concise grammars in a simple descriptive format suitable for general readership and educational purposes. Al-Kitāb categorizes grammar under subheadings, from syntax to morphology, and includes an appendix on phonetics. Each chapter introduces a concept with its definition. Arabic verbs may indicate three tenses (past, present, future) but take just two forms, defined as &quot;past&quot; (past tense) and &quot;resembling&quot; (present and future tenses).

Sibawayh generally illustrates his statements and rules by quoting verses of poetry, grabbing material from a very wide range of sources, both old and contemporary, both urban and from the desert: his sources range from pre-Islamic Arabian poets, to later Bedouin poets, urban Umayyad-era poets, and even the less prestigious and more innovative rajaz poets of his time.

Although a grammar book, Sibawayh extends his theme into phonology, standardised pronunciation of the alphabet and prohibited deviations. He dispenses with the letter-groups classification of al-Farahidi&#x27;s dictionary. He introduces a discussion on the nature of morality of speech; that speech as a form of human behavior is governed by ethics, right and wrong, correct and incorrect.

Many linguists and scholars highly esteem &quot;Al-Kitāb&quot; as the most comprehensive and oldest extant Arabic grammar. Abu Hayyan al-Gharnati, the most eminent grammarian of his era, memorized the entire &quot;Al-Kitāb&quot;, and equated its value to grammar as that of hadiths to Islamic law.
