<text>Brighton railway station is the principal station serving the city of Brighton and Hove in England, operated by Govia Thameslink Railway. It is the southern terminus of the Brighton Main Line, the western terminus of the East Coastway Line and the eastern terminus of the West Coastway Line. It is from via . 

The station was built by the London &amp; Brighton Railway in 1840–41, initially only connecting Brighton to Shoreham-by-Sea, westwards along the coast, in May 1840. In September 1841, it was connected inland to Haywards Heath and London Bridge via the new Clayton Tunnel; then in 1846 to the county town of Lewes to the east via the London Road Viaduct. The railway became the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway in 1846 following mergers with other railways with lines between Portsmouth and Hastings.

With 14.5 million passenger entries and exits in 2023-24, Brighton is the busiest station in East Sussex, the second busiest in South East England, and the seventh-busiest station in the country outside London.

==History and development==
The London &amp; Brighton Railway (L&amp;BR) built a passenger station, goods station, locomotive depot and railway works on a difficult site on the northern edge of Brighton. This site was from, and above the sea shore, and had involved considerable excavation work to create a reasonable gradient from Patcham Tunnel.

===Passenger station===

The passenger station was a three-storey building in an Italianate style, designed by David Mocatta in 1839–40 which incorporated the head office of the railway company. (This building still stands but has been largely obscured by later additions.) The station is said to have many similarities to the Nine Elms railway station of the London and Southampton Railway (1838) designed by Sir William Tite. Baker &amp; Son were paid £9766 15s for the station building between May and August 1841. The platform accommodation was built by John Urpeth Rastrick and consisted of four pitched roofs each . It opened for trains to Shoreham on 12 May 1840, and to London on 21 September 1841.
The station site was extended for the opening of the Brighton Lewes and Hastings Railway on 8 June 1846 (which had been purchased by the L&amp;BR in 1845). In July 1846, the L&amp;BR merged with other railways to form the London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway.

Further extensions to the station occurred during the mid-19th century but only a limited number of additional platforms could be added because of the awkward sloping site. By the late 1870s the facilities were inadequate for the growing volume of traffic and so the existing platforms were lengthened to be able to accommodate two trains, and the three separate roofs were replaced by an overall roof during 1882/1883.

The station has an impressive large double-spanned curved glass and iron roof covering all of the platforms, which was substantially renovated in 1999 and 2000.

At the front of the station is a bus station. The station has six bus stops which are served by Brighton &amp; Hove bus routes 1, 1A, N1, 5B, 6, 7, N7, 12, 12A, 12X, 13X, 14, 14C, 18, 24, 26, 27, 27B, 27C, 46, 48, 49, 55, 59 and 79. The station taxi rank is outside the rear of the station. A tunnel runs under the station which once provided an open-air cab run at a shallower gradient than Trafalgar Street outside, which had been the main approach to the station before the construction of Queen&#x27;s Road (which was financially supported by the railway and intended to improve access). The cab run was covered (forming a tunnel) when the station above was extended over it on cast iron columns. The cab run remains in situ but has been sealed at the station end, with the sloped entrance infilled with concrete and used as a storage area.

Help, a dog used to collect charitable donations, was displayed at the station following its death in 1891.

===Goods station and yard===
A goods station and yard was also constructed on the eastern side of the passenger station but on a site due to the sloping site, which was initially accessed from the Shoreham line by a second tunnel under the passenger station. The tunnel entrance was filled in after new tracks were laid into the goods yard, but a portion of it was converted into offices during World War II, and these were in use until the early 21st century. A portion of the tunnel is still used by a local rifle club, with an entrance staircase accessible from platforms 6 and 7. The site of the goods yard has since been redeveloped, and much of it forms the New England Quarter.

===Locomotive and carriage works===
To the north of the station, on the east side of the main line, the railway constructed its locomotive and carriage works, which operated from 1841 until 1911, when the carriage works was moved to Lancing and 1957 when the locomotive works closed. Thereafter Isetta cars were briefly built in a part of the works.

===Locomotive depot===

The London &amp; Brighton Railway opened a small locomotive shed and servicing facility to the north west of the station for locomotives on the Shoreham line, in May 1840, and another, adjacent to the locomotive works for main line locomotives, the following year.
During 1860–1861 John Chester Craven, the locomotive superintendent of the London Brighton and South Coast Railway (LB&amp;SCR) began the removal of a large chalk hill to the north of the station, which had been dumped during the excavation of the main line. The space created was used to accommodate a new much enlarged motive power depot in 1861, replacing the two existing facilities. During the early 1930s, following the electrification of the lines the steam motive power depot was rebuilt and reduced in size. It was closed 15 June 1961 but remained in use for stabling steam locomotives until 1964 and was demolished in 1966.

The site is currently the Network Rail&#x27;s ECR and infrastructure maintenance depot, and Southern&#x27;s Lovers Walk Depot, used for servicing most of Southern&#x27;s single voltage Class 377 and formerly Class 313 fleets.

===Listed status===
Brighton station was listed at Grade II* on 30 April 1973. As of February 2001, it was one of 70 Grade II*-listed buildings and structures, and 1,218 listed buildings of all grades, in the city of Brighton and Hove.

==Platform layout==
The station has eight platforms, numbered 1 to 8 from left to right when looking from the main entrance. All platforms are long enough to accommodate 12-car trains, except platform 1 which can only hold up to 10 carriages.

* Platforms 1 and 2 can only be used by services on the West Coastway line. They are served by Southern services towards , , West Worthing, Littlehampton, , and .
* Platform 3 is the only platform that can be used by services on all three lines, although trains on the West Coastway Line are limited to 4 carriages in length; services on the Brighton main and East Coastway lines are not restricted. The signalling also allows this platform to be occupied by two units on two separate lines at the same time, with a West Coastway train at the near end of the platform and a Brighton main or East Coastway train (up to 4 carriages long) at the far end. During the day, the platform is usually used by Southern and Gatwick Express services to .
* Platforms 4-8 can be used by services on the Brighton Main Line and the East Coastway line. Usually, platform 4 shares with platform 3 the Southern and Gatwick Express services to London Victoria; platform 5 is served by Thameslink trains to , platform 6 by those to , while platforms 7 and 8 are used by Southern services on the East Coastway Line. However, this usage can be changed at times of disruption.

* London, Brighton &amp; South Coast Railway
* Southern Railway
* British Rail
* CrossCountry
* South West Trains
* Virgin CrossCountry
* Connex South Central
* Wessex Trains

Until May 2022, Great Western Railway operated limited 3 car services to Bristol Temple Meads and beyond.

=== Disruptions to services from the station ===
Football matches at the Falmer Stadium are served by train services from Brighton to Falmer. A queuing system is in operation from 2 hours before kick off for trains departing from platforms 7 and 8. The stadium&#x27;s 31,800 capacity means these queues are large close to kick off. After the game, fans leave the station via the emergency gates, and a queuing system is in operation for West Coastway Line services departing from platforms 1 and 2.

The Lewes Bonfire night, usually on 5 November, attracts large numbers of people, many travelling through Brighton station. As a result, Southern operate a queuing system from the afternoon onwards.

The London to Brighton Bike Ride in June each year attracts large numbers of cyclists. As a result, Southern bans bicycles from many trains on the day, and on the following day it operates a queuing system at Brighton station. The train operators had in the past allowed bicycles on trains for the many cyclists returning to London.

== Facilities ==
Passenger facilities include a ticket office, a travel information office, and several retail outlets. There are bus stops, a taxi rank, a car park and bicycle storage. Facilities for cyclists were extended in 2014 when a &quot;cycle hub&quot; was built at the rear entrance to the station. The three-storey building combines storage space for 500 bicycles with shops to buy or hire a bicycle, a repair facility, toilets, showers, changing facilities and a café. It is open 24 hours a day and storage is free of charge; most funding came from the Department for Transport (£500,000), Network Rail (£200,000), local rail operator Southern and the city council (£100,000 each).

In 2012 £4.5 million was secured from the Department for Transport&#x27;s Station Commercial Project Facility for renovation of the concourse. Changes included an increased number of ticket barriers, improved layout, more seating and retail outlets and the removal of the previous WH Smiths structure.

In 2021, a tactile map was installed, in collaboration with the Royal National Institute of Blind People, to help blind and partially sighted passengers navigate the station.

==Train Crew Depots==
Both Southern and Thameslink have driver, on board supervisor and conductor depots at Brighton station.

==Accidents==
Arthur Wellesley, 2nd Duke of Wellington, died at the station on 13 August 1884.

On 4 August 1909, a train hauled by Terrier No.83 &quot;Earlswood&quot; collided with the buffers at Brighton, due to the driver&#x27;s error. Nineteen people were injured.

On 30 September 1922, control of a steam engine was lost at the engine shed. When the engine got to the turntable there were no buffer-stops to stop the engine. This caused the momentum of the engine to derail and crash through a brick wall into the street, injuring one passer-by.

== Concourse ==
The concourse includes food shops, cafés, a newsagent and other food and retail outlets. The front of the station often sees stalls and street food vans. Following a request by Labour MP for Hove Peter Kyle in 2014, Southern added a street piano to the concourse, with a vintage Southern Railway logo inscribed.

<text>Chicken is a 2001 Irish short film directed by Barry Dignam about the way adolescent males sometimes redirect their feelings of affection for each other into often violent or competitive activities such as games of chicken.

==Plot==
Mick (Darren Healy) and Kev (Niall O&#x27;Shea) spend a late afternoon near railroad tracks by the seaside where Mick teaches Kev how to &quot;shotgun&quot; beer for reasons then unknown to the viewer. He observes that Kev is &quot;a bit of a wuss&quot; after he fails to replicate the proper shotgunning technique and calls for Kev to come sit close to him for a test of courage, the knife game, which involves stabbing a knife between outstretched fingers at an ever-faster rate. The game is usually played with one person&#x27;s hand at a time and as a gesture of what may be seen as self-sacrifice, Mick puts his hand over Kev&#x27;s in order to shield Kev&#x27;s hand from the brunt of an injury should it occur.

When a train speeds by them, Mick accidentally cuts Kev and himself very slightly with the knife. They clasp each other&#x27;s hands tightly and Mick, who suddenly seems very insecure and in need of affection is lovingly embraced by Kev, who perhaps has known all along why Mick brought him here.

A single screen of credits appears, then the film ends with a brief shot of the two in silhouette, standing apart, watching the sun set over the ocean.

==Production==
&quot;Chicken&quot; was shot over two days on 35 mm film with a Dolby Digital soundtrack.

The title of the short film is a double entendre, since &quot;chicken&quot; is also a slang term for a young homosexual.

<doc id="910768" wikidata="Q7721548" url="?curid=910768" title="The Casino (American TV series)">
<text>The Casino is an American reality television series broadcast on the Fox network in 2004 which followed two dot-com millionaires, Thomas Breitling and Tim Poster, as they manage the Golden Nugget Hotel &amp; Casino, located in downtown Las Vegas instead of the more popular Las Vegas Strip.

The show was created by Mark Burnett, the creator of &quot;Survivor&quot;. It was canceled shortly before the last three episodes of the series could be broadcast due to dismal ratings. However, sister station Fox Reality Channel picked up &quot;The Casino&quot; and broadcast the unaired episodes and then ran the series in re-runs until its cancellation from that network.

==Production==
Scenes of Tim Poster and Thomas Breitling were filmed around Las Vegas in January 2004. Filming at the Golden Nugget was initially scheduled to begin that same month, but was delayed and began instead on February 2, 2004.

Casinos such as the Aladdin Resort &amp; Casino and Caesars Palace were initially considered rather than the Golden Nugget. An area of the Golden Nugget&#x27;s casino was closed off to allow for filming of high-stakes gambling at a roulette wheel, a dice table, and four blackjack tables. &quot;The Casino&quot; was the first reality series to be shot with high-definition video cameras. Eighteen camera crews shot approximately 270 hours of footage for each hour-long episode. Executive producer James Bruce speculated that the show &quot;could go on forever&quot; because of its variety.

Other filming locations included the Las Vegas Strip and downtown Las Vegas. Filming at the Golden Nugget concluded on March 17, 2004, with additional background footage to be shot at a later time. The theme song, &quot;Two Shots of Happy, One Shot of Sad&quot;, was written by Bono and The Edge, and performed by Matt Dusk.

==Broadcast==
&quot;The Casino&quot; began airing on June 14, 2004. In July 2004, it was reported that &quot;The Casino&quot; was a ratings disappointment, and that Poster, Breitling, and employees did not like the show&#x27;s portrayal of the Golden Nugget, including its &quot;staged feel&quot;.

<doc id="910770" wikidata="Q2809955" url="?curid=910770" title="List of urban areas in the European Union">
<text>This is a list of urban areas in the European Union with over 500,000 inhabitants as of 2022. The data comes from Demographia and the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Demographia provides figures for urban areas (including conurbations), while the UN DESA figures are a mix agglomerations, cities proper and metropolitan areas. For comparison, Function Urban Area (FUA) population figures by Eurostat are also provided, however, these measure the wider metropolitan areas.

==Important notes==
* This is a list of urban areas, &quot;not&quot; a list of metropolitan areas. Urban areas are contiguous built-up areas where houses are typically not more than 200 m apart, not including rivers, parks, roads, industrial fields, etc. A metropolitan area is an urban area plus any satellite cities around it and any agricultural land in between. For instance Paris is sometimes listed with 12 million inhabitants, Stuttgart is frequently listed with 2.2 million inhabitants, Munich with 2 million or more, etc., indicating the wider metropolitan area of those places. Metropolitan areas, which imply much more complicated definitions (such as the proportion of people in satellite cities working in the core of the metropolitan area), can be accurately computed only by statistical offices, after they have chosen a definition for metropolitan areas, whereas urban areas can be computed by any institution or person with the study of maps, satellite imagery and other geographical data in order to determine the outer limits of a continuous built-up area with one or more neighbouring cities. Furthermore, the list does not make a difference between cities that have multiple satellites and cities that do not. Therefore, two cities with the same demographics for their urban area will have an equal ranking on this list, even if one of the two cities may be much larger as it is the core of a number of satellites.
* This is a list of urban areas, &quot;not&quot; a list of administrative cities. For example, the list of conurbations contains the urban area of Lille-Kortrijk. Lille and Kortrijk remain two very distinct cities, each belonging to a different country, culture and language area. For a list of the largest cities of the European Union by population, see List of cities in the European Union by population within city limits.

<doc id="910778" wikidata="Q7928823" url="?curid=910778" title="Views of Lyndon LaRouche and the LaRouche movement">
<text>Lyndon LaRouche (1922–2019) and the LaRouche movement have expressed controversial views on a wide variety of topics. The LaRouche movement is made up of activists who follow LaRouche&#x27;s views.

==Economics and politics==
According to Matko Meštrović, emeritus senior research fellow at the Institute of Economics of Zagreb, Croatia, LaRouche&#x27;s economic policies call for a program modeled on the economic-recovery program of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration, including fixed exchange rates, capital controls, exchange controls, currency controls, and protectionist price and trade agreements among partner-nations, although Roosevelt generally pursued trade liberalization. LaRouche also called for a reorganization of debt world-wide, and a global plan for large-scale, continental infrastructure projects. He rejects free trade, deregulation, and globalization.

===Marxist roots===
Lyndon LaRouche began his political career as a Trotskyist and praised Marxism, but he and the National Caucus of Labor Committees abandoned this ideology in the late 1970s. From then on, LaRouche no longer opposed private ownership of the means of production, and his analysis of political events is no longer phrased in terms of class.

According to Tim Wohlforth, during and after his break with Trotskyism, LaRouche&#x27;s theory was influenced by what he called his &quot;Theory of Hegemony&quot; derived from Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s view of the role of intellectuals in being a vanguard helping workers develop their consciousness and realize their leading role in society. He was influenced by Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s concept of hegemony as an intellectual and cultural elite which directs social thought. LaRouche&#x27;s theory saw himself and his followers as becoming such a hegemonic force. He rejected Gramsci&#x27;s notion of &quot;organic intellectuals&quot; being developed by the working class itself. Rather, the working class would be led by elite intellectuals such as himself.

LaRouche was influenced by his readings of Rosa Luxemburg&#x27;s &quot;The Accumulation of Capital&quot; and Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital&quot; developing his own &quot;theory of reindustrialization&quot;, saying that the West would attempt to industrialize the Third World, particularly India, and attempt to solve the economic crisis both by developing new markets in the Third World and using its cheap and surplus labor to increase profits and minimize costs (see neocolonialism.) To oppose this, LaRouche argued for a &quot;reindustrialization&quot; of the United States with himself at the vanguard of the effort allowing him to personally resolve the crisis of capitalism. Though his arguments had since been stripped of their quasi-Marxist language and citations, his core theories had remained essentially the same since the late 1960s.

==== &quot;Dialectical Economics&quot; ====

In the book &quot;Dialectical Economics: An Introduction to Marxist Political Economy&quot;, which was published in 1975 by D. C. Heath and Company under the pen name Lyn Marcus, LaRouche tried to show that numerous Marxists—ranging from the &quot;Monthly Review&quot; group to Ernest Mandel, Vladimir Lenin, Leon Trotsky, Joseph Stalin, Mao Zedong, Fidel Castro and the &quot;Soviet economists&quot;—had failed to understand and to interpret correctly Marx&#x27;s writing. Marxists he admired—apart from Marx himself—were Rosa Luxemburg and Yevgeni Preobrazhensky.

According to a review by Martin Bronfenbrenner in &quot;The Journal of Political Economy&quot;, about half of the book was devoted to dialectical philosophy, &quot;with a strong epistemological stress&quot;, with the other half devoted to discussions of economic and general history, anthropology and sociology, and actual economics, including a surprisingly large helping of business administration—Bronfenbrenner noted that LaRouche seemed to have &quot;more private-business experience than the great majority of academic economists&quot;, including a familiarity with the way speculative overcapitalization, operating at the borders of white-collar crime, creates &quot;fictitious capitals&quot; that later do not match their actual earning power. Like Thorstein Veblen, LaRouche subscribed to an overcapitalization theory of economic depression.

According to Bronfenbrenner, LaRouche viewed conventional economics as a &quot;withered arm of philosophy&quot;, which had taken a wrong turn toward reductionism under the influence of British empiricists such as John Locke and David Hume. LaRouche&#x27;s definition of reductionism was as follows:

The fundamental fallacy of ordinary understanding is the delusion that the universe is reducible to simple substance, or—the more Hume-like view—that the content of human knowledge is limited to simple-substance-like, self-evident sense perceptions. This discredited outlook—whether it takes the naive mechanistic [form] or the equivalent mechanistic outlook of empiricism—is termed &quot;reductionism&quot;. All varieties of reductionism are formally premised on the fallacious assumption of formal logic, that the universe can be represented as discrete points interconnected by formal relations. 

From this it followed, Bronfenbrenner said, that LaRouche viewed bourgeois economists&#x27; concern with &quot;prices&quot; as reductionism, versus the Marxian concern with &quot;values&quot;. The reductionist fallacy then lies in adjusting a value theory like labor theory to fit in with price theory; in LaRouche&#x27;s view, economists should work in the opposite direction.

According to Bronfenbrenner, LaRouche viewed capitalist America as headed for a kind of fascism not much better than that of the Nazis; but he noted that LaRouche&#x27;s own vision of socialism, and the trade-off between necessity and freedom in a centrally planned economy, seemed apt to result in the justification of a different kind of dictatorship:

Judging from his controversial manner, [LaRouche] impresses at least one reader as a Me-for-Dictator type to whom it would be dangerous to entrust the task of drawing any boundary between the domain of freedom and that of necessity or order.

===LaRouche&#x27;s campaign platforms===
The campaign platforms of LaRouche and his followers have included these elements:
* A return to a gold-based national and world monetary system, and fixed exchange rates; and replacement of the central bank system, including the U.S. Federal Reserve System, with a &quot;national bank&quot;;
* A war on drug trafficking and prosecution of banks involved in money laundering;
* An emphasis on large-scale economic infrastructure, including the building of a world land bridge of railroads and a tunnel under the Bering Strait, the building of nuclear power plants, accelerating research on fusion energy, the North American Water and Power Alliance, and rebuilding or nationalizing the country&#x27;s steel industry;
*A crash program to build particle-beam weapons and lasers, including support for elements of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI);
*Opposition to the USSR and support for a military buildup to prepare for imminent war;
*Growth in food production and a farm debt moratorium;
*Low interest rates and opposition to the Gramm–Rudman balanced-budget law;

===Later orientation===
According to &quot;China Youth Daily Online&quot;, LaRouche was once a Marxist, but later supported heavily regulated capitalism. He supported public control of financial capital and low-interest loans.

LaRouche said banks should not be bailed out, but be placed in receivership by the state. He said that a &quot;firewall&quot; should prevent state aid from being diverted to speculative entities, which should be allowed to fail, and that such failures would clean up the financial markets.

LaRouche believes in the principles of the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, and favors state intervention in the economy. LaRouche also said that he supported the approach of U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton, who established a banking system geared to develop production.

Italian Economics Minister Giulio Tremonti said that he had encountered LaRouche at a debate held in 2007 in Rome, and that he appreciates LaRouche&#x27;s writings. According to an article by Ivo Caizzi in &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, a group of Italian Senators led by Oskar Peterlini asked the Berlusconi government to tackle the financial crisis using legislation developed by LaRouche in 2007. The legislation proposed that public money should save only the commercial infrastructure required for the financing of productive enterprises.

The &quot;Triple Curve&quot;, or &quot;typical collapse function&quot;, is an economic model developed by LaRouche which tries to illustrate the growth of financial aggregates at the expense of the physical economy and how this leads to an inevitably collapsing bubble economy. According to the &quot;China Youth Daily Online&quot; interview, LaRouche&#x27;s main point is that the real economy (production) is dropping while the nominal economy (money and financial instruments) is going up. As the nominal economy greatly overreaches the real economy, an unavoidable economic crisis ensues.

Since 2000, the LaRouche movement has:
*Called for a moratorium on Third World debt.
*Opposed deregulation. According to LaRouche&#x27;s publications, &quot;LaRouche has consistently called for reregulation of utilities, transportation, health care (under the &quot;Hill-Burton&quot; standard), the financial (especially the speculative markets) and other sectors ...&quot; They support the renewal of Glass–Steagall Act regulations on banks.
*In 2007, LaRouche proposed a &quot;Homeowners and Bank Protection Act&quot;. This called for the establishment of a federal agency that would &quot;place federal- and state-chartered banks under protection, freeze all existing home mortgages for a period of time, adjust mortgage values to fair prices, restructure existing mortgages at appropriate interest rates, and write off speculative debt obligations of mortgage-backed securities&quot;. The bill envisioned a foreclosure moratorium, allowing homeowners to make the equivalent of rental payments for an interim period, and an end to bank bail-outs, forcing banks to reorganize under bankruptcy laws. A LaRouche spokesman said that bank bail-outs &quot;reward corrupt swindlers with taxpayer money&quot;. The proposal attracted support from Democrats at city council and state legislature level. Pennsylvania Democrat Paul Kanjorski opposed the bill, stating it would involve government seizure of &quot;every American bank&quot;. Mike Colpitts of &quot;Housing Predictor&quot; stated that LaRouche&#x27;s economic forecasts had been correct, and that he might have received more mainstream credibility had it not been for his controversial history.

==Neoplatonism==

LaRouche&#x27;s philosophy references an old dispute between Plato and Aristotle. Aristotle believed in knowledge through empirical observation and experience. Plato believed in The Forms.
According to LaRouche, history has always been a battle between Platonists—rationalists, idealists and utopians who believe in absolute truth and the primacy of ideas—and Aristotelians—relativists who rely on empirical data and sensory perception. Platonists in LaRouche&#x27;s worldview include figures such as Beethoven, Mozart, Shakespeare, Leonardo da Vinci, and Leibniz. LaRouche states that many of the world&#x27;s ills are due to the fact that Aristotelianism, as embraced by British philosophers like Locke, Hume, Thomas Hobbes, Jeremy Bentham and represented by &quot;oligarchs&quot;, foremost among them wealthy British families, has dominated, leading to a culture that favors the empirical over the metaphysical, embraces moral relativism, and seeks to keep the general population uninformed. LaRouche frames this struggle as an ancient one, and sees himself and his movement in the tradition of the philosopher-kings in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;.

LaRouche and his followers use Neoplatonism as the basis for an economic model that posits &quot;the absolute necessity of progress&quot;. Economies evolve in stages as humanity devises new technologies, stages that LaRouche compares to the hierarchical spheres in Kepler&#x27;s model of the solar system based on the Platonic solids. The purpose of science, technology and business must be to assist this progress, enabling the Earth to support an ever-growing humanity. Human life is the supreme value in LaRouche&#x27;s world view; environmentalism and population control are seen as retrogressive steps, promoting a return to the Dark Ages. Rather than curtailing progress, because of dwindling resources, LaRouche advocates using nuclear technology to make more energy available to humanity, freeing humanity to enjoy music and art.

In LaRouche&#x27;s view, the people opposing this vision are part of the Aristotelian conspiracy. They may not necessarily be in contact with one another: &quot;From their standpoint, [the conspirators] are proceeding by instinct&quot;, LaRouche has said. &quot;If you&#x27;re asking how their policy is developed—if there is an inside group sitting down and making plans—no, it doesn&#x27;t work that way ... History doesn&#x27;t function quite that consciously.&quot; Left and right are false distinctions for LaRouche; what matters is the Platonic versus Aristotelian outlook, a position that has led LaRouche to form relationships with groups as disparate as farmers, nuclear engineers, Black Muslims, Teamsters, pro-lifers, and followers of the Ku Klux Klan—even though LaRouche counts the Klan itself among his foes.

George Johnson, in &quot;Architects of Fear&quot; (1983), has described LaRouche&#x27;s Neoplatonist conspiracy theory as a &quot;distortion of a real philosophical distinction&quot;. He has written that the resulting philosophy can be applied to any number of situations in a manner that becomes plausible once one accepts its basic premise. In his view, it forms the foundation of a conspiracy theory that rationalizes paranoid thinking, an opinion echoed by John George and Laird Wilcox in &quot;American Extremists: Militias, Supremacists, Klansmen, Communists &amp; Others&quot; (1996). Writing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1989, Johnson described LaRouche as &quot;a kind of Allan Bloom gone mad&quot; who seems to &quot;believe the nonsense he spouts&quot;, a view of the world in which Aristotelians use &quot;sex, drugs and rock-and-roll&quot; and &quot;environmentalism and quantum theory&quot; to support wealthy oligarchs and create a civilization-destroying &quot;new Dark Age&quot;.

==Conspiracies==
LaRouche wrote that conspiracy was natural in human beings. In 1998, he responded to critics of his conspiracism, such as Daniel Pipes and said that Pipes wrongly believed that all reports of conspiracy are axiomatically false.

LaRouche&#x27;s critics, particularly Dennis King and Chip Berlet, characterize his current orientation as being a conspiracist worldview. They say the Marxist concept of the ruling class was converted by LaRouche into a conspiracy theory, in which world capitalism was controlled by a cabal including the Rothschilds, the Rockefellers, Henry Kissinger, and the Council on Foreign Relations. Daniel Pipes said that LaRouche personalizes his conspiracy theories, and associates &quot;all of his adversaries with the forces of darkness.&quot;

The &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot; (EIR), a LaRouche publication, ran an &quot;investigative report&quot; titled &quot;Vast Right-Wing Conspiracy At It Again, With a New Twist&quot; in 2007. The article states:
In 2001, LaRouche said that rogue elements within the American military took part in, or planned, the September 11, 2001, attacks as part of a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;.

===The &quot;British&quot; conspiracy===
LaRouche is known for alleging conspiracies by the British. LaRouche has said that the dominant imperialist strategic force acting on the planet today is not the United States, but the &quot;Anglo-Dutch liberal system&quot; of the British Empire, which he asserts is an oligarchic financial consortium like that of medieval Venice, more like a &quot;financial slime-mold&quot; than a nation. According to this theory, London financial circles protect themselves from competition by using techniques of &quot;controlled conflict&quot; first developed in Venice, and LaRouche attributes many wars in recent memory to this alleged activity by the British.

According to Chip Berlet and Dennis King, LaRouche has always been stridently anti-British and has included Queen Elizabeth II, the British Royal Family, and others, in his list of conspirators who are said to control the world&#x27;s political economy and the international drug trade. According to Jonathan Vankin and John Whalen, LaRouche is the &quot;most illustrious&quot; Anglophobe. These views are reflected in three books authored by members of his organization:

*&quot;Dope, Inc.&quot; by David P. Goldman, Konstandinos Kalimtgis and Jeffrey Steinberg, 1978 (): this book discusses the history of narcotics trafficking, beginning with the Opium War, and alleges that British interests have continued to dominate the field up to the modern era, for example through money laundering in British offshore banking colonies. The heart of the conspiracy, according to LaRouche, is the financial elite of the City of London.
*&quot;The Civil War and the American System&quot; by Allen Salisbury, 1979 (): alleges that British interests encouraged and financed the secession movement and supported the Confederacy against the Union in the American Civil War, because they preferred North America to be a primitive agrarian economy that they could dominate through policies of free trade.
*&quot;The New Dark Ages Conspiracy&quot; by Carol White, 1980 (): alleges that a group of British intellectuals led by Bertrand Russell and H. G. Wells attempted to control scientific progress in order to keep the world backward and more easily managed by imperialism. In this conspiracy theory, Wells wished science to be controlled by some kind of priesthood and kept from the common man, while Russell wished to stifle it altogether by restricting it to a closed system of formal logic, that would prohibit the introduction of new ideas. This conspiracy also involved the promotion of the counterculture.

====The Queen and Prince Philip====
According to book critic and columnist Scott McLemee:

The emergence of the [LaRouche Youth Movement] is all the more surprising, given that LaRouche himself has long since become the walking punchline to a very strange joke. He is known for some of the most baroque conspiracy theories ever put into circulation. Members of the LYM now deny that he ever accused the of drug trafficking—though in fact, he did exactly that throughout the 1980s. At the time, he won admirers on the extreme right wing by denouncing Henry Kissinger as an agent of the KGB and calling for AIDS patients to be quarantined.

In 2004, in a segment about the death of Jeremiah Duggan during a LaRouche Youth Movement cadre school in Wiesbaden in March 2003, BBC&#x27;s &quot;Newsnight&quot; re-broadcast a BBC interview with LaRouche from 1980, in which he said about the Queen: &quot;Of course she&#x27;s pushing drugs. That is, in the sense of a responsibility, the head of a gang that is pushing drugs, she knows it&#x27;s happening and she isn&#x27;t stopping it.&quot;

A 1998 editorial in LaRouche&#x27;s &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot; cited a statement by Ambrose Evans-Pritchard in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; that described LaRouche as the &quot;publisher of a book that accuses the Queen of being the world&#x27;s foremost drug dealer&quot;, characterising it as a &quot;bit of black propaganda&quot; and a &quot;reference to the book Dope, Inc., ... which laid bare the role of the London-centered offshore financial institutions and allied intelligence services, in running the global drug trade, from the time of Britain&#x27;s nineteenth-century Opium Wars against China.&quot; Evans-Pritchard further said LaRouche had claimed that the Queen was involved in the Death of Diana, Princess of Wales. The &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot; responded that Evans-Pritchard&#x27;s article was &quot;pure fiction&quot;, written in response to EIR reporter Jeff Steinberg&#x27;s appearance on a British ITV television program about the conspiracy theories surrounding the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. In a brief part of an interview with Steinberg broadcast the following day by Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Dispatches&quot;, Steinberg said that while there was &quot;no smoking gun proof&quot; that Prince Philip asked British intelligence to assassinate Diana, he could not &quot;rule out&quot; the possibility.

===Leo Strauss===
LaRouche&#x27;s initial essay on the influence of Leo Strauss within neoconservatism and the George W. Bush administration, &quot;The Essential Fraud of Leo Strauss&quot;, was written in March 2003. In the same year, a series of pamphlets entitled &quot;Children of Satan&quot; later consolidated into a book, began appearing. LaRouche charges that there was a conspiracy dominated by what are called Straussians (followers of Leo Strauss) within the Bush administration, and that the dominant personality in this conspiracy was Dick Cheney (whose photo appears on the cover of the book.) LaRouche claimed that these conspirators deliberately misled the American public and the US Congress in order to initiate the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He writes that the Straussians created the Office of Special Plans in order to fabricate intelligence and bypass traditional intelligence channels. According to LaRouche movement member Tony Papert, an important part of this theory is the LaRouchian analysis of the ideas of Leo Strauss which borrows heavily from the writings of Shadia Drury.

Robert Bartley of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; has condemned LaRouche&#x27;s views on this subject, and says that it may have influenced other commentators who subsequently published a similar analysis, such as Seymour Hersh and James Atlas in their articles for &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Bartley quotes the assertion by LaRouche movement member Jeffrey Steinberg that a &quot;cabal of Strauss disciples, along with an equally small circle of allied neo-conservative and Likudnik fellow-travelers&quot; have plotted a &quot;not-so-silent coup&quot; using the September 11 attacks as a justification, similar to the Reichstag fire of 1933. Bartley complains that Strauss&#x27;s &quot;words are twisted from their meaning&quot; in order to justify the theory. Canadian journalist Jeet Heer has commented that LaRouche&#x27;s followers &quot;argue that Strauss is the evil genius behind the Republican Party&quot;. Political science scholars Catherine and Michael Zuckert say that LaRouche&#x27;s writings were the first to connect Strauss to neoconservatism and the Bush foreign policy and initiated the discussion of the topic, though the views about it changed as it percolated through to international journalism.

===Bush family===
The &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot; (EIR) published an article by Anton Chaitkin alleging that Prescott Bush &quot;had persevered with his comrades in the old Auschwitz gang&quot; and that &quot;the smoldering bodies in Auschwitz followed logically upon the race propaganda festival which had been staged by the Harriman-Bush enterprise a decade earlier in New York.&quot;

EIR published a book, &quot;George Bush: The Unauthorized Biography&quot;, by Webster Griffin Tarpley and Anton Chaitkin, in 1992, which said that &quot;virtually all the Nazi trade with the United States was under the supervision of the Harriman-Bush interests&quot;, and that &quot;Bush&#x27;s family had already played a central role in financing and arming Adolf Hitler for his takeover of Germany; in financing and managing the buildup of Nazi war industries for the conquest of Europe and war against the U.S.A.; and in the development of Nazi genocide theories and racial propaganda, with their well-known results. ... The President&#x27;s family fortune was largely a result of the Hitler project. The powerful Anglo-American family associations, which later boosted him into the Central Intelligence Agency and up to the White House, were his father&#x27;s partners in the Hitler project.&quot;

In 2006, The LaRouche Political Action Committee and EIR published &quot;LaRouche to Rumsfeld: FDR Defeated the Nazis, While Bushes Collaborated&quot;, which stated:

==PANIC proposal and AIDS==
In 1974, an organisation affiliated to LaRouche predicted that there would be pandemics in Africa. When AIDS was first recognized as a medical phenomenon in the early 1980s, LaRouche activists were convinced that this was the pandemic about which the task force had warned. LaRouche and his followers stated (incorrectly) that HIV, the AIDS virus, could be transmitted by casual contact, citing as supporting evidence the high incidence of the disease in Africa, the Caribbean and southern Florida. LaRouche said that the transmission by insect bite was &quot;thoroughly established&quot;. John Grauerholz, medical director of the BHTF, told reporters that the Soviet Union may have started the epidemic and that U.S. health officials aided the Soviets by not doing more to stop AIDS.

AIDS became a key plank in LaRouche&#x27;s platform. His slogan was &quot;Spread Panic, not AIDS!&quot; LaRouche&#x27;s followers created &quot;Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee&quot; (PANIC), which sponsored California Proposition 64, the &quot;LaRouche Initiative&quot;, in 1986. Mel Klenetsky, co-director of political operations for the Larouche-affiliated National Democratic Policy Committee and LaRouche&#x27;s campaign director, said that there must be universal testing and mandatory quarantining of HIV carriers. &quot;Twenty to 30 million out of 100 million people in central Africa have AIDS&quot;, Klenetsky said. &quot;It is spreading because of impoverished economic conditions, and that is a direct result of IMF policies that have destroyed people&#x27;s means of resisting the disease.&quot; Klenetsky said that LaRouche believed that not only drug users and homosexuals are vulnerable to the disease.

The measure was met with strong opposition and was defeated. A second AIDS initiative qualified for the ballot in 1988, but the measure failed by a larger margin. In response to a survey which predicted that 72% of voters would oppose the measure, a spokesman called the poll &quot;an obvious fraud&quot;, saying that pollsters deliberately worded questions to prejudice respondents against the initiative. He additionally said that the poll was part of a &quot;big lie ... witch hunt&quot; orchestrated by Armand Hammer and Elizabeth Taylor.

As early as 1985, NDPC members ran for local school boards on a platform of keeping infected students out of school. In 1986, LaRouche supporters traveled from Seattle to Lebanon, Oregon to urge the school board there to reverse a policy that would allow children with AIDS to enroll. In 1987, followers tried to organize a boycott of an elementary school in the Chicago neighborhood of Pilsen, sending a van with loudspeakers through the district. They disrupted an informational meeting and, according to press accounts, told parents that &quot;The blood of your own children will be on your hands if you allow this child with AIDS in your school&quot;, or shouted at opponents, &quot;He has AIDS! He has AIDS!&quot;

LaRouche purchased a national TV spot during his 1988 presidential campaign, in which he summarized his views and proposals with respect to the AIDS epidemic. He said most statements about how AIDS is spread were an &quot;outright lie&quot; and that talk of safe sex was just propaganda put out by the government to avoid spending the money required to address the crisis.

The AIDS disinformation of the LaRouche movement occurred during the Soviets&#x27; Operation &quot;INFEKTION&quot; propaganda campaign. According to researcher Douglas Selvage, &quot;a cycle of misinformation and disinformation... arose between U.S.-based conspiracy theorists—especially Lyndon LaRouche and his followers—and authors and publications espousing Moscow&#x27;s preferred theses regarding AIDS.&quot;

LaRouche-affiliated candidates used AIDS as an issue as late as 1994.

Opponents characterized it as an anti-gay measure that would force HIV-positive individuals out of their jobs and into quarantine, or create &quot;concentration camps for AIDS patients.&quot; According to newspaper reports, the LaRouche newspaper &quot;New Solidarity&quot; said the initiative was opposed by Communist gangs composed of the &quot;lower sexual classes&quot; and he warned of the recruitment of millions of Americans into the ranks of &quot;AIDS-riddled homosexuality&quot;.

==Environment and energy==
Meštrović says LaRouche followed Vladimir Vernadsky in seeing the human mind as a force transforming the biosphere into a higher form, the noösphere. LaRouche favored a highly industrialized civilization reaching for innovation and interplanetary colonization. The movement said that the theory of man-caused global warming prevents the development of emerging economies. It also said that the top level organizations in the command structure of the environmental movement include the World Wildlife Fund, headed by Prince Philip, the Aspen Institute, and the Club of Rome.

According to Chip Berlet, &quot;Pro-LaRouche publications have been at the forefront of denying the reality of global warming&quot;. The LaRouche movement&#x27;s &quot;21st Century Science &amp; Technology&quot; magazine has been called &quot;anti-environmental&quot; by &quot;Mother Jones&quot; magazine. LaRouche publications denounced the concept of a nuclear winter, the theory that nuclear war could lead to global cooling, as early as 1983, calling it a &quot;fraud&quot; and a &quot;hoax&quot; popularized by the Soviet Union to weaken the U.S. Some of the movement&#x27;s ideas were later adopted by the Wise use movement. The LaRouche movement opposed ratification of the Convention on Biological Diversity, which failed in the U.S. Senate in 1994.

===Energy-flux density===
LaRouche asserts a concept &quot;energy-flux density&quot;, which is the rate of energy use per person and per unit area of the economy as a whole. He asserts that an increase in energy flux density as a fundamental principle of the universe in general (contrary the second law of thermodynamics), and the appropriate destiny or goal for mankind in general. Consequently, policies or ideologies deemed to oppose this increase must be opposed and are foolish and dangerous: for example, moves to decrease energy consumption or improve efficiency, or to reduce consumption, or to reduce population; policies deemed increase it should be pursued: higher energy fuels such as nuclear fuels, higher populations, higher consumption.

===Nuclear power===
LaRouche says that nuclear and especially fusion power is necessary for the continued growth of civilization. He founded the Fusion Energy Foundation, which published the journal &quot;Fusion&quot; (later renamed to &quot;21st Century Science &amp; Technology&quot;). In his 1980 presidential platform, LaRouche promised 2500 nuclear power plants if elected. In 2007, LaRouche reiterated his position, saying that only the &quot;massive investment&quot; in fission and fusion technology could prevent the &quot;collapse of human existence on this planet&quot;.

The movement has targeted opponents of nuclear power. Members of the Clamshell Alliance, non-violent protesters at the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in New Hampshire, were called &quot;terrorists&quot; in 1977. Representatives of LaRouche&#x27;s U.S. Labor Party gave incriminating information to law enforcement about them, which the FBI later determined had been fabricated, according to King. During a large demonstration against the plant in 1989, an airplane carried a banner overhead which read, &quot;Free LaRouche! Kill Satan – Open Seabrook&quot;.

The movement blames cabalists, including then-congressman Dick Cheney, for inciting anti-nuclear sentiments during the late 1970s. LaRouche sources described the incident at the nuclear power plant at Three Mile Island as sabotage, since they considered the control systems too sophisticated to fail by accident.

===DDT===
&quot;21st Century Science &amp; Technology&quot;&#x27;s managing editor, Marjorie Mazel Hecht, called the campaign against DDT the &quot;&#x27;mother&#x27; of all the environmental hoaxes&quot;. Other articles compared anti-DDT campaigner Rachel Carson to Nazi propagandist Joseph Goebbels. &quot;21st century&quot;, which is produced by LaRouche supporters, has published papers by entomologist J. Gordon Edwards, including one that urged the return of the insecticide DDT because he said it has &quot;saved more millions of lives than any other man-made chemical&quot;. Rogelio (Roger) Maduro, an associate editor, wrote that the ban on DDT was part of a plan to reduce the population and had caused the deaths of 40 million people via a resurgence of malaria.

===Ozone hole===
LaRouche was part of what was called the &quot;ozone backlash&quot;. &quot;21st Century Science &amp; Technology&quot;, which conducted what has been called &quot;a very effective campaign of misinformation on the issue of ozone depletion&quot;, published &quot;The Holes in the Ozone Scare&quot; in 1992. The book, by LaRouche followers Rogelio Maduro and Ralf Schauerhammer, said that chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) were not destroying the ozone layer and opposed the proposal to ban them. It asserted that most chlorine in the atmosphere came from oceans, volcanoes, or other natural sources, and that CFCs were too heavy to reach the ozone layer. It went on to say that even if the ozone layer were depleted there would not be any harmful effects from additional ultraviolet radiation. It predicted that a ban would result in an additional 20 to 40 million deaths due to food spoilage. Lewis DuPont Smith, an heir to the DuPont Chemical fortune and a LaRouche follower, told Maduro that the DuPont Company had schemed to ban CFCs, which they had invented but which had become generic, in order to replace them with more expensive proprietary compounds. It has been called &quot;probably the best known and most widely quoted text aimed at debunking the concept of ozone depletion&quot;. Its assertions were repeated by Dixy Lee Ray in her 1993 book &quot;Environmental Overkill&quot;, by Rush Limbaugh, and by Ronald Bailey. Some atmospheric scientists have said that it is based on poor research.

At a 1994 shareholder&#x27;s meeting, Smith called on DuPont to continue producing CFCs, saying there was no evidence of their harmfulness and that &quot;This is nothing less than genocide&quot;. By 1995 LaRouche was noted as calling the ozone hole a &quot;myth&quot;. Maduro&#x27;s writings were the basis for the Arizona legislature&#x27;s passage of a 1995 bill to allow the production of CFCs in the state despite federal and international prohibitions.

===Global warming===

&quot;The &quot;Greenhouse effect&quot; hoax: a world federalist plot&quot;, another book by Maduro, says that the theory of anthropogenic global warming (AGW) is a plot by the British royal family and communists to undermine the U.S. It was cited by science writer David Bellamy.

LaRouche followers have promoted the documentary &quot;The Great Global Warming Swindle&quot; and attacked Al Gore&#x27;s &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;, infiltrating showings to promote their viewpoints. They have stood on street corners proclaiming the falsity of global warming, and have protested Gore&#x27;s appearances.

&quot;21st Century Science &amp; Technology&quot; has published papers by climate change contrarians including Zbigniew Jaworowski, Nils-Axel Mörner, Hugh Ellsaesser, and Robert E. Stevenson. A 2007 article by LaRouche science advisor Laurence Hecht suggested that the varying levels of cosmic rays, whose change is dependent on Earth&#x27;s motion through the galaxy, has a larger effect on the climate than local factors such as greenhouse gases or solar and orbital cycles. Christopher Monckton was praised as the leading spokesman of the &quot;global warming swindle&quot; in the introduction to an &quot;Executive Intelligence Review&quot; interview with him in 2009, but he was also considered to have a relatively limited view of the cabal behind the hoax. A movement newsletter says that environmental groups seek to &quot;force ... CO2 emissions agreements down the throats of governments as a way of finishing off the nation-state system&quot; on behalf of synarchist networks.

==Music and science==
LaRouche was fascinated by musical theory, as well as mathematics and physics, and this fascination also translates into his teachings; his followers for example have attempted to link the musical scale to his Neoplatonist model of economic evolution, and study singing and geometry. A common teaser used by the movement is to ask people whether they know how to &quot;double the square&quot;—draw a square whose area is twice the size of an existing square. A motto of LaRouche&#x27;s European Workers&#x27; Party is &quot;Think like Beethoven&quot;; movement offices typically include a piano and posters of German composers, and members are known for their choral singing at protest events, using satirical lyrics tailored to their targets.

LaRouche and his wife had an interest in classical music up to Johannes Brahms. LaRouche abhorred contemporary music; holding that rock music is subversive, and was deliberately created to be so by British intelligence. LaRouche is quoted as saying that jazz music was &quot;foisted on black Americans by the same oligarchy which had run the U.S. slave trade&quot;. This dislike for modern music also extends to classical music the movement disapproves of; LaRouche movement members have protested at performances of Richard Wagner&#x27;s operas, denouncing Wagner as an anti-Semite who found favor with the Nazis, and called a conductor &quot;satanic&quot; because he played contemporary music.

In 1988, LaRouche advocated that classical orchestras should return to the &quot;Verdi pitch&quot;, a pitch that Giuseppe Verdi had enshrined in Italian legislation in 1884. Orchestras&#x27; pitches have risen since the 18th century, because a higher pitch produces a more brilliant orchestral sound, while imposing an additional strain on singers&#x27; voices. Verdi succeeded in 1884 in having legislation passed in Italy that fixed the reference pitch for A at 432 Hz, but in 1938, the international standard was raised to 440 Hz, with some major orchestras tuning as high as 450 Hz in recent times. LaRouche spoke about the resulting strain on singers&#x27; voices in his 1988 presidential campaign videos. By 1989 the initiative had attracted support from more than 300 opera stars, including Joan Sutherland, Plácido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Montserrat Caballé. While many of these singers may or may not have been aware of LaRouche&#x27;s politics, Renata Tebaldi and Piero Cappuccilli ran for the European Parliament on LaRouche&#x27;s &quot;Patriots for Italy&quot; platform and appeared as featured speakers at a conference organised by the Schiller Institute. (The institute was founded by LaRouche and his wife, Helga.) The discussions led to debates in the Italian parliament about reinstating Verdi&#x27;s legislation. LaRouche himself gave an interview to National Public Radio on the initiative in 1989 from prison. Stefan Zucker, the editor of &quot;Opera Fanatic&quot; (and, incidentally, the &quot;world&#x27;s highest tenor&quot;) opposed the initiative on the grounds that it would result in the establishment of a &quot;pitch police&quot;, arguing that the way it presented the history of the tuning pitch was a &quot;simplification&quot;, and that LaRouche was using the issue to gain credibility. The initiative in the Italian Senate failed to result in corresponding legislation being passed.

LaRouche considered pitch important, believing that the Verdi pitch has a direct relation to the structure of the universe, and that bel canto singing at the correct pitch maximizes the music&#x27;s impact on both singers and listeners.

==Opposition to Obama&#x27;s health reforms==

LaRouche&#x27;s organization opposed the Obama administration&#x27;s health-care reform proposals. Posters of Obama wearing a Hitler-style mustache appeared at a LaRouche movement rally.

As town-hall meetings on this issue during the summer of 2009 began to attract very large and angry crowds, the comparison of Obama to Hitler began to show up on many signs and banners. &quot;The Atlantic&quot; wrote that LaRouche supporters &quot;patented the Obama-is-Nazi theme&quot;.

==Sexuality and politics==
In 1973, LaRouche wrote an article called &quot;Beyond Psychoanalysis&quot;. He theorized that each culture had characteristic flaws that resulted in blocks to effective political organizing. LaRouche and his colleagues conducted studies of different &quot;national ideologies&quot;, including German, French, Italian, English, Latin American, Greek, and Swedish.

In an article, &quot;The Sexual Impotency of the Puerto Rican Socialist Party&quot;, LaRouche criticised Machismo. Regarding the role of women, he adds, &quot;The task of real women&#x27;s liberation is to generally strengthen women&#x27;s self-consciousness and their power and opportunities to act upon self-consciousness.&quot;

==Minority politics==

Critics say the movement is antisemitic, conspiracist, and anti-LGBT, and that its political and economic proposals are a cover for its actual beliefs.

===Homosexuality===
During the 1980s, LaRouche and his supporters made comments that were seen as anti-gay. A LaRouche-affiliated newspaper wrote that demonstrators against the LaRouche-sponsored AIDS initiative in California were from the &quot;lower sexual classes.&quot;

===Judaism and Zionism===
British journalist Roger Boyes wrote, &quot;Anti-Semitism is at the core of LaRouche&#x27;s conspiracy theories, which he adapts to modern events — most recently the war in Iraq.&quot; Daniel Levitas wrote in 1995 that LaRouche &quot;has been consistent in creating and elaborating conspiracy theories that contain a strong dose of antisemitism&quot;. As an example of LaRouche&#x27;s alleged antisemitism, Dennis King cited LaRouche&#x27;s statement (under the pen name L. Marcus) in &quot;The Case of Ludwig Feuerbach&quot; (1973), &quot;Jewish culture ... is merely the residue left to the Jewish home after everything saleable has been marketed to the Goyim.&quot;

The charge of antisemitism in the LaRouche network resurfaced in the media in 2004 in accounts of the death of a Jewish student, Jeremiah Duggan, who had been attending a Schiller Institute event in Germany. British press reports described LaRouche as &quot;the American leader of a sect with a fascist and antisemitic ideology&quot;.

LaRouche denied over a long period that his movement is antisemitic. In 2006, LaRouche said, &quot;Religious and racial hatred, such as anti-Semitism [is] the most evil expression of criminality to be seen on the planet today.&quot; Debra Freeman, a spokesperson for LaRouche, told a newspaper in 2010 that, &quot;Hitler was a lunatic, but his policies were based principally on economic policy and staying in power. We mourn the loss of six million Jews and countless others.&quot;

LaRouche&#x27;s critics have said he is a &quot;disguised anti-Semite&quot;, in that he takes the classical antisemitic conspiracy theory and substitutes the word &quot;Zionist&quot; for the word &quot;Jew&quot;, and ascribes the classical antisemitic caricature of the &quot;scheming Jew&quot; to particular Jewish individuals and groups of Jews, rather than to the Jews as a whole. &quot;Modern Zionism was not created by Jews, but was a project developed chiefly by Oxford University&quot;, LaRouche says. He says, &quot;Zionism is not Judaism.&quot; In 1978, the same year LaRouche&#x27;s article cited &quot;The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion&quot;, the LaRouche group published &quot;Dope, Inc.: Britain&#x27;s Opium War against the U.S.&quot;, which cited the Protocols and defended its authenticity, likening the &quot;Elders of Zion&quot; to the Rothschild banking family, the British Royal family, and the Italian Mafia, and the Israeli Mossad, General Pike, and the B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith. Later editions left out cites to &quot;The Protocols&quot;. This is the genesis of the claim that LaRouche has said Queen Elizabeth runs drugs. When asked by an NBC reporter in 1984 about the Queen and drug running, LaRouche replied, &quot;Of course she&#x27;s pushing drugs ... that is in a sense of responsibility: the head of a gang that is pushing drugs; she knows it&#x27;s happening and she isn&#x27;t stopping it.&quot;

Chip Berlet argues that LaRouche indirectly expresses antisemitism through the use of &quot;coded language&quot; and by attacking neoconservatives. Dennis King maintains, for example, that words like &quot;British&quot; were really code words for &quot;Jew&quot;. Other critics of LaRouche believe that LaRouche&#x27;s anti-British statements disparage the British system rather than the Jewish religion. Laird Wilcox and John George write that, &quot;Dennis King goes to considerable lengths to paint LaRouche as a neo-Nazi, even engaging in a little conspiracy-mongering of his own.&quot;

===Race===
Manning Marable of Columbia University wrote in a 1997 column that LaRouche had a &quot;long attempted to destroy and manipulate black leaders, political organizations and the black church&quot;.

During LaRouche&#x27;s slander suit against NBC in 1984, Roy Innis, leader of the Congress of Racial Equality, took the stand for LaRouche as a character witness, stating under oath that LaRouche&#x27;s views on racism were &quot;consistent with his own.&quot; Asked whether he had seen any indication of racism in LaRouche&#x27;s associates, he replied that he had not. Innis received criticism from many blacks for having testified on LaRouche&#x27;s behalf.

The African-American civil-rights leader James Bevel was LaRouche&#x27;s running mate in the 1992 presidential election, and in the mid-1990s, the LaRouche movement entered into an alliance with Louis Farrakhan&#x27;s Nation of Islam. Another LaRouche movement member with a record in civil-rights issues is Amelia Boynton Robinson, then the vice-president of the Schiller Institute, a LaRouche organization; she has described the movement as following in the footsteps of Martin Luther King Jr.: &quot;Mr. Mrs. LaRouche built a movement, taking up where Dr. King had left off. They realized ... there must be universal image of mankind, which transcends all racial differences and barriers.&quot;

==Accusations of fascism against the LaRouche movement==
LaRouche&#x27;s movement has frequently been accused of being fascist. Those making the accusation include Democratic National Committee chairman Paul G. Kirk, a local Texas Democratic district committee, and Democratic activist Bob Hattoy.

Dennis King, a former Marxist–Leninist and member of the Progressive Labor Party in the 1960s and early 1970s, used this thesis in the title of his book-length study of LaRouche and his movement, &quot;Lyndon LaRouche and the New American Fascism&quot; (1989). &quot;Operation Mop-Up&quot;, which is said to have consisted of violent physical attacks on left-wing meetings, is used as a basis for such accusations.

, a Russian historian and academician at the International Academy of Sciences in Innsbruck, Austria, was interviewed in 2012 by the Russian think tank and web portal &quot;Terra America&quot; and asked to comment on the characterizations of LaRouche in Western media. He replied that intellectuals who have called LaRouche a fascist do not deserve to be called intellectuals, and that the charge has no basis in any real scientific analysis of politics. According to Fursov, it comes from the fact that LaRouche criticizes the supposedly &quot;democratic&quot; but actually &quot;liberal totalitarian&quot; system of the West. Fursov said that in Russia not so many people know of LaRouche and that the important thing is not the quantity, but the quality.

George Johnson, in a review of King&#x27;s book in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said that King&#x27;s presentation of LaRouche as a &quot;would-be Führer&quot; was &quot;too neat&quot;, and that it failed to take into account that several members of LaRouche&#x27;s inner circle were themselves Jewish, while acknowledging that LaRouche&#x27;s &quot;conspiracy theory is designed to appeal to anti-Semitic right-wingers as well as to Black Muslims and nuclear engineers&quot;. In his 1983 book, &quot;Architects of Fear&quot;, Johnson described LaRouche&#x27;s dalliances with radical groups on the right as &quot;a marriage of convenience&quot;, and less than sincere; as evidence he cited a 1975 party memo that spoke of uniting with the right simply for the purpose of overthrowing the established order: &quot;Once we have won this battle, eliminating our right-wing opposition will be comparatively easy.&quot; At the same time, Johnson says, LaRouche also sought contact with the Soviet Union and the Ba&#x27;ath Party in Iraq; failing to recruit either the Soviets or right-wingers to his cause, LaRouche attempted to adopt a more mainstream image in the 1980s. Laird Wilcox and John George similarly stated that King had gone too far in trying &quot;to paint LaRouche as a neo-Nazi&quot; and that LaRouche&#x27;s most severe critics, like King and Berlet, came from extreme leftist backgrounds themselves.

<text>St. Catherine University (St. Kate&#x27;s) is a private Catholic university in Saint Paul, Minnesota. It was established as one of the first institutions of higher learning specifically for women in the Midwest and was known as the College of St. Catherine until 2009. St. Kate&#x27;s offers baccalaureate programs for women as well as graduate and associate programs for women and men.

The university averages an enrollment of about 5,000 students annually. It focuses on recruiting and enrolling minority students and non-traditional aged students. St. Catherine&#x27;s Weekend College—now College for Adults—was the second such program in the nation and the first in the Upper Midwest. St. Kate&#x27;s was also the first private college in the nation to launch an effort to attract, welcome, and retain Hmong students, making it home to one of the largest populations of Hmong scholars in the nation.

==History==

===Founders===

St. Catherine University was founded as the College of St. Catherine in 1905 by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet under the leadership of Mother Seraphine Ireland. The university is named after St. Catherine of Alexandria, the fourth-century Egyptian lay philosopher who suffered martyrdom for her faith.

A site for St. Kate&#x27;s was chosen atop the city&#x27;s second-highest hill in St. Paul in the area now known as Highland Park. Hugh Derham of Rosemount contributed $20,000 for the first building. Derham Hall opened in January 1905, offering classes to high school boarding students and lower-division college students. The high school eventually moved to its own campus and merged with the Lasallian-run Cretin High School to form Cretin-Derham Hall High School in 1987. Upper-division courses were first offered in the academic year of 1911–12. In spring 1913, Bachelor of Arts degrees were conferred on the first two students to complete four years at the new institution. In 1917, St. Kate&#x27;s earned full accreditation from the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.

During World War II, St. Kate&#x27;s responded to a critical nursing shortage by expanding its programs to include a baccalaureate degree in nursing and assuming leadership of the St. Joseph&#x27;s and St. Mary&#x27;s hospitals and schools of nursing and partnering with the U.S. Cadet Nursing Corps to provide students with financial assistance in exchange for nursing services. More than 170 St. Catherine alumnae served in military hospitals between 1942 and 1948.

Prior to the 1970s, students often took classes at the nearby University of St. Thomas, which was at the time a men&#x27;s college.

===Expansion to Minneapolis===

The St. Paul campus is the location for most day, evening/weekend, and graduate program classes, with 110 wooded acres in the Highland Park neighborhood, a central location between the Twin Cities&#x27; downtowns.
St. Kate&#x27;s coeducational Minneapolis campus in the Riverside neighborhood offers associate degree and certificate programs in numerous healthcare fields. In 1887, the Sisters of St. Joseph responded to a need for trained nurses in the region founding the St. Mary&#x27;s School of Nursing at St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Minneapolis. Student nurses in the three year Registered Nurse program lived in a dormitory at the hospital while studying first year academics at the College of St. Catherine. In 1964, the hospital program was expanded and opened under the title St. Mary&#x27;s Junior College. St. Mary&#x27;s offered associate degrees in healthcare, including the first occupational therapy assistant program and the first physical therapist assistant program in the United States. St. Kate&#x27;s acquired St. Mary&#x27;s Junior College in 1985. In 1987, Fairview Hospital combined with St. Mary&#x27;s Hospital to become Riverside Medical Center. In 2019, St. Catherine University sold the Minneapolis campus and moved all Minneapolis campus programs and staff to the St. Paul campus the following year.

===Move to University===

On June 1, 2009, the College of St. Catherine changed its name to St. Catherine University.

===National Register of Historic Places===

Derham Hall and Our Lady of Victory Chapel are co-listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Organization==

===Schools and colleges===

At St. Catherine University, students enroll in one of three colleges:
* The College for Women
* The Graduate College
* The College for Adults

Students pursue their majors or programs of study through four discipline-based schools:

* School of Humanities, Arts, and Sciences
* School of Business
* Henrietta Schmoll School of Health Sciences
* School of Nursing

Collectively, the schools host more than 100 fields of study, many of which are available in both traditional day and nontraditional hybrid (evening, weekend and online) formats. St. Kate&#x27;s also has nearly 60 baccalaureate majors, plus another 35 or so through the Associated Colleges of the Twin Cities, as well as dozens of minors and nine pre-professional programs.

===Partnerships===

St. Kate&#x27;s is a member of the Associated Colleges of the Twin Cities (ACTC), a consortium of five private liberal arts colleges located in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The partnership allows students to take classes or complete a major at any one of the other colleges. The university also partners with 900 clinical training sites to make clinical education meaningful and relevant to St. Kate&#x27;s students. Partner organizations include Allina Health System, Fairview Health Services, HealthEast Care System and HealthPartners.

In the fall of 2011, St. Kate&#x27;s became the first university in Minnesota to partner with the Paul D. Coverdell Fellows Program (formerly known as the Peace Corps Fellows/ USA program) to offer Peace Corps volunteers a fellowship to earn a Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership (MAOL).

===Endowed Mission Chairs===

Unlike many colleges and universities that have established separate departments for Catholic studies, liberal arts and women&#x27;s studies, St. Catherine University has established three distinguished chairs:

* Endowed Chair in Catholic Identity
* Endowed Chair in Women&#x27;s Education
* Endowed Chair in the Liberal Arts

Each position is supported by endowed funds and a program endowment. The distinguished chairs will work as a team to:

* Initiate, plan and oversee faculty and staff development programming;
* Fund faculty and staff work focused on integrating the mission into syllabi, program
* Requirements and co-curricular activities;
* Purchase relevant library holdings and other materials;
* Serve as faculty resources, especially for visiting classes, recruiting speakers and planning workshops.

==Academics==

The student/faculty ratio is 10:1. The average class size is 18 in the traditional/day program, 13 in the College for Adults, bachelor&#x27;s program and 16 in the College for Adults, associate program.

In addition to taking courses directly related to their chosen majors, baccalaureate students are required to complete one or two additional courses in the arts, humanities and sciences to meet the university&#x27;s liberal arts requirements.

===Online OTA program===
In 2014, St. Catherine University expanded its Occupational Therapy Assistant program to offer a blended learning option. Starting in Virginia, and then expanding to California and Texas, the Online OTA program features 80% online and 20% onsite curriculum, including skills labs and fieldwork experiences.

===Research and Academic Centers===

St. Catherine University offers opportunities for faculty-student research and mentoring through department and grant-funded initiatives—as well as through these programs and national centers:

* Assistantship Mentoring Program (AMP) — paid teaching, research, and program assistantships in this program .
* Mayo Innovation Scholars program — This program brings together baccalaureate students from a variety of disciplines to research Mayo Clinic invention ideas and create business plans for a medical product. Graduate students from St. Catherine&#x27;s Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership program serve as mentors to student teams.
* WHIR Center — The Women&#x27;s Health Integrative Research (WHIR) Center is a laboratory devoted to interdisciplinary research on women&#x27;s health. In addition to motion-tracking equipment—such as a 3-D electromagnetic motion system, a metabolic measurement unit and a heart-rate monitoring system—WHIR also has a wet lab that supports the processing and storage of human blood and saliva samples. WHIR also functions as a ladder between degree programs in disciplines such as nursing, where students from two-year associate degree programs work alongside students earning their four-year or graduate degrees.
* CATIE Center — St. Catherine University established the CATIE Center in 2005 as the Collaborative for the Advancement of Teaching Excellence. It is one of the six centers working in partnership as the National Consortium of Interpreter Education Centers. The CATIE Center offers resources and programs such as the Body Language online modules, ASL Immersion, Deaf Mentor Training, and Interpreting for Deaf-Blind Mentorship for students and working professionals. The center hosts the National Symposium on Healthcare Interpreting, drawing more than 150 interpreters to St. Kate&#x27;s each year.
* National Center for STEM Elementary Education — This center houses outreach programs and services related to fostering interest and skill in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) among students as young as fourth grade.
* Human Anatomy Lab — St. Kate&#x27;s is home to the second largest collegiate anatomy lab in the state. The 3,600-square-foot space includes two labs—each one large enough to accommodate nine bodies—plus showers, lockers, storage units and a cleaning room. At least eight different academic programs use the lab, including orthoptics (undergraduate), physician assistant studies (master&#x27;s) and physical therapy (doctoral studies). A religious service is held at the start of each semester to help students express gratitude for the generosity of their &quot;silent teachers&quot;. John C. Nienstedt, Archbishop of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, blessed the lab on September 19, 2011.

===Honors programs===

First-year students or sophomores who have achieved at least a 3.5 GPA are eligible to apply for the St. Catherine University&#x27;s Antonian Scholars program for promising learners, leaders, researchers, writers, performers, and creative thinkers. Antonian Scholars are required to complete an independent creative project during senior year. There are a total of 25 different Honor Societies.

===Study abroad programs===

St. Catherine University offers more than 150 study abroad options in 50 countries, ranging in length from January term to yearlong. More than 200 St. Kate&#x27;s students study abroad each year.

==Student life==
===Residence life===
Eighty percent of St. Catherine&#x27;s first-year students live in eight residence halls on campus. Students have access to computer labs in the halls and resident advisors (RAs) who provide ongoing support, guidance, and social activities. Each year, the university offers learning communities in some residence halls.

===Clubs and organizations===

St. Catherine University has more than 50 student organizations, including Student Senate, intramural sports, and a women&#x27;s choir. Students can work on two student publications, The Wheel and Ariston.

===Art and archives===
St. Catherine University&#x27;s fine art collection dates back to St. Kate&#x27;s founding in 1905. Today, more than 1,000 pieces comprise the collection. Among them are works on paper—prints (etchings, engravings, woodcuts, lithographs and silkscreens), watercolors and drawings—as well as paintings and sculpture by artists of different nationalities and periods, including:

* Corita Kent, one of America&#x27;s most influential graphic design artists of the 20th century.
* Adolf Dehn, who helped define regionalism and caricature in American art.
* Clair Mairs, featured in Pioneer Modernists: Minnesota&#x27;s First Generation of Women Artists.
* Giovanni Piranesi, one of the most prolific printmakers of the 18th century.
* Ade Bethune, who made unique contributions during the 20th century to the field of sacred art and architecture as an artist, writer and liturgical consultant.

In addition to paper files, the St. Catherine University archives contains more than 8,000 photographs and 4,500 artifacts. The archives contain artifacts from before the Christian era and from the early days of printing, including a Heritage Edition of The Saint John&#x27;s Bible.

The university also houses the Catherine G. Murphy Gallery which hosts art exhibitions, programming, and the university&#x27;s art collection. The gallery seeks to &quot;maintain a powerful women-centered presence in the local and regional arts communities.&quot;

==Athletics==
St. Catherine athletic teams are the Wildcats. The university is a member of the Division III level of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), primarily competing in the Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) since the 1983–84 academic year.

St. Catherine competes in 11 intercollegiate varsity sports: Women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, dance, golf, ice hockey, soccer, softball, swimming &amp; diving, tennis, track &amp; field and volleyball. Club and recreational sports include aerobics, volleyball, basketball, soccer, tennis and rock climbing.

===Facilities===
Remodeled in 2015, the Aimee and Patrick Butler Center for Sports and Fitness at St. Kate&#x27;s is a women-oriented sports center, complete with an eight-lane swimming pool, weight room, suspended jogging track, spa and sauna. The benefits for student athletes are emerging at the university&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Health Integrative Research (WHIR) Center. WHIR&#x27;s equipment can establish baseline performance measurements and track athletic improvement over time.

<text>A bicycle helmet is a type of helmet designed to attenuate impacts to the head of a cyclist in collisions while minimizing side effects such as interference with peripheral vision.

== History ==

=== History of designs ===

A cycle helmet should generally be light in weight and provide ample ventilation because cycling can be an intense aerobic activity which significantly raises body temperature, and the head in particular needs to be able to regulate its temperature. The dominant form of the helmet up to the 1970s was the &quot;hairnet&quot; style, an open construction made of rubber bars covered in leather. This offered acceptable protection from scrapes and cuts, but only minimal impact protection, and was mainly used by racing cyclists.

More widespread use of helmets began in the US in the 1970s. After many decades when bicycles were regarded largely as children&#x27;s toys, many American adults took up cycling during and after the bike boom of the 1970s. Two of the first modern bicycle helmets were made by MSR, a manufacturer of mountaineering equipment, and Bell Sports, a manufacturer of helmets for auto racing and motorcycles. These helmets were a spin-off from the development of expanded polystyrene foam liners for motorcycling and motorsport helmets and had hard polycarbonate plastic shells. The bicycle helmet arm of Bell was split off in 1991 as Bell Sports Inc., having completely overtaken the motorcycle and motorsports helmet business.

The first commercially successful purpose-designed bicycle helmet was the Bell Biker, a polystyrene-lined hard shell released in 1975. At the time there was no appropriate standard; the only applicable one, from Snell, would be passed only by a light open-face motorcycle helmet. Over time the design was refined and by 1983 Bell were making the V1-Pro, the first polystyrene helmet intended for racing use. In 1984 Bell produced the Lil Bell Shell, a no-shell children&#x27;s helmet. These early helmets had little ventilation.

In 1985, Snell B85 was introduced, the first widely adopted standard for bicycle helmets; this has subsequently been refined into B90 and B95 (see Standards below). At this time helmets were almost all either hard-shell or no-shell (perhaps with a vacuum-formed plastic cover). Ventilation was still minimal due mainly to technical limitations of the foams and shells in use.
Around 1990 a new construction technique was invented: in-mould micro shell. A very thin shell was incorporated during the moulding process. This rapidly became the dominant technology, allowing for larger vents and more complex shapes than hard shells.

Use of hard shells declined rapidly among the general cyclist population during the 1990s, almost disappearing from road and cross country mountain bike helmets by the end of the decade, but remaining popular with BMX riders and more aggressive mountain bike disciplines such as downhill riding.

The late 1990s and early 2000s saw advances in retention and fitting systems, with cradles which adjust precisely to the rider&#x27;s head, replacing the old system of varying thickness pads. This resulted in the back of the head being less covered by the helmet, although more recent designs have largely addressed this.

Since more advanced helmets began being used in the Tour de France, carbon fiber inserts are often used to increase strength and protection of the helmet. The Giro Atmos and Ionos, as well as the Bell Alchera, were among the first to use carbon fiber, MET Helmets furthered the use of carbon fibre by in-moulding a complete cage during manufacturing.

Some modern road and track racing bicycle helmets have a long tapering back end for streamlining. This type of helmet is mainly dedicated to time trial racing and Triathlon as they lack significant ventilation, making them uncomfortable for long races.

=== History of standards ===

In the United States the Snell Memorial Foundation, an organisation initially established to create standards for motorcycle and auto racing helmets, implemented one of the first standards, since updated. Snell&#x27;s standard includes testing of random samples. In 1990 the Consumers&#x27; Association (UK) market survey showed that around 90 % of helmets on sale were Snell B90 certified. By their 1998 survey, the number of Snell certified helmets was around zero. There are two main types of helmet: hard shell and soft/micro shell (no-shell helmets are now rare). Hard shells declined rapidly among the general cyclist population over this period, almost disappearing by the end of the decade, but remained more popular with BMX riders as well as inline skaters and skateboarders.

The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) created a standard called ANSI Z80.4 in 1984. Later, the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) created its own mandatory standard for all bicycle helmets sold in the United States, which took effect in March 1999.

In the European Union (EU) the currently applicable standards are EN 1078:1997 and EN 1080:1997.

An additional and voluntary standard was created by Swedish medical professionals. MIPS-compliant helmets are intended to reduce rotational violence to the brain caused by angled impacts.

In Australia and New Zealand, the current legally required standard is AS/NZS 2063. A 2004 report concluded that the performance requirements of the 1996 version of this standard was slightly less strict than the Snell B95 standard but incorporated a quality assurance requirement, making it arguably safer.

=== Design intentions and standards ===

The standards are intended to reduce acceleration to (and within) the head due to impact, as a stiff liner made of expanded polystyrene is crushed against the head. However, both the CPSC and the EN 1078 standards only look at linear accelerations and ignore rotational accelerations. The rotational accelerations that arise in bicycle accidents can be large enough to cause concussions, diffuse axonal injury and subdural haematoma. A few new helmets are designed to reduce rotational accelerations in accidents.

It is important that a helmet fit the cyclist properly – in one study of children and adolescents aged 4 to 18 years, 96 % were found to be incorrectly fitted. Efficacy of incorrectly fitted helmets is reckoned to be much lower; one estimate states that risk is increased almost twofold.

==History of use==

Helmets use varies greatly between populations and between groups. Downhill mountain bikers and amateur sportive cyclists normally wear helmets, and helmet use is enforced in professional cycle sport and in a few legal jurisdictions. Utility cyclists and children are much less likely to wear helmets unless compelled.

===Required helmet use in cycling sport===

Historically, road cycling regulations set by the sport&#x27;s ruling body, Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI), did not require helmet use, leaving the matter to individual preferences and local traffic laws. The majority of professional cyclists chose not to wear helmets, citing discomfort and claiming that helmet weight would put them in a disadvantage during uphill sections of the race.

The first serious attempt by the UCI to introduce compulsory helmet use was 1991 Paris–Nice race, which resulted in a riders&#x27; strike, and UCI abandoned the idea.

While voluntary helmet use in professional ranks rose somewhat in the 1990s, the turning point in helmet policy was the March 2003 death of Andrei Kivilev at the Paris–Nice. The new rules were introduced on 5 May 2003, with the 2003 Giro d&#x27;Italia being the first major race affected. The 2003 rules allowed for discarding the helmets during final climbs of at least 5 kilometres in length; subsequent revisions made helmet use mandatory at all times.


===Injury reduction===

There is consistent scientific evidence that bicycle helmets reduce the severity of head injuries, particularly serious injuries, in accidents, although they are less useful when a motor vehicle is involved.

===Health benefits of cycling===

Studies from China, Denmark, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom show that regular cyclists live longer because the health effects far outweigh the risk of crashes. A reduction in the number of cyclists is likely to harm the health of the population more than any possible protection from injury. UK figures show that it takes at least 8,000 years of average cycling to produce one clinically severe head injury and 22,000 years for one death. De Jong developed a mathematical model to evaluate the health-risk trade-offs of all-age mandatory helmet laws, if they were to be introduced in various North American and Western European countries. He concluded that helmet laws appear to offer net health benefit only in those countries with more dangerous bicycling environments under optimistic assumptions of the efficacy of helmets. Newbold suggested improvements to the De Jong model, and, using published cycling statistics for the United States in his revised model, found that mandatory bicycle helmet laws would seem to have positive net public health benefits there. However, Newbold stressed that there were many parameters to these models which require further research to properly quantitate, and that results should be considered provisional rather than definitive.

Some researchers have suggested that a legal requirement to wear helmets there may have dissuaded people from cycling, and that repeal of these laws could lead to increased cycling. This suggestion has been criticised. Fewer cyclists might lead to increased risks per cyclist due to the &quot;safety in numbers&quot; effect. This means that if the number of cyclists on the road doubles, then the average individual cyclist can ride for an additional 50 percent of the time without increasing the probability of being struck. It is thought that the increased frequency of motorist-cyclist interaction creates more aware motorists.

===Risk compensation===

It has been hypothesised that the wearing of helmets may make cyclists feel safer and thus take more risks. This hypothetical effect is known as risk compensation or risk homeostasis. Some authors have suggested that risk compensation occurs with other road safety interventions such as seat belts and anti-lock braking systems, but these views are disputed by other road safety experts.

A Spanish study of traffic accidents between 1990 and 1999 found that helmeted cyclists involved in accidents were less likely to have committed a traffic law violation than unhelmeted cyclists, and that helmeted cyclists were no more likely to have committed a speeding violation in association with the accident than unhelmeted cyclists. The authors concluded that &quot;although the findings do not support the existence of a strong risk compensation mechanism among helmeted cyclists, this possibility cannot be ruled out.&quot;

In one experimental study, adults accustomed to wearing helmets cycled more slowly without a helmet, but no difference in helmeted and unhelmeted cycling speed was found for cyclists who do not usually wear helmets. An experimental study found that children negotiating an obstacle course on foot went faster and took more risks when wearing safety gear (including helmets). A telephone interview study found that in hypothetical scenarios of their children wearing protective equipment or not, parents&#x27; ratings of permissible risk for their children was higher if protective gear was hypothetically worn.

Motorists may also alter their behaviour toward helmeted cyclists. One study by Walker in England found that 2500 vehicles passed a helmeted cyclist with measurably less clearance (8.5 cm less) than that given to the same cyclist unhelmeted (out of an average total passing distance of 1.2 to 1.3 metres). An initial re-analysis of these data by other investigators agreed that with the 8.5 cm finding, but argued that there were not more &quot;close passes&quot; (which they defined as under 1 metre of clearance). In 2018, Walker published a rebuttal, arguing that there were more passes under 1.5m (the legal minimum distance in Spain and Germany) or 2m, and there was not enough evidence to say there weren&#x27;t more passes at under 1m.

In 1988, Rodgers re-analysed data which supposedly showed helmets to be effective; he found data errors and methodological weaknesses, and concluded that in fact the data showed &quot;bicycle-related fatalities are positively and significantly associated with increased helmet use&quot;. He mentioned risk compensation as one possible explanation of this association.

=== Counterfeits ===
With fake &quot;knock-off&quot; products of inferior quality and durability increasingly appearing for sale online, many direct from China, consumers are warned to be suspicious of prices that seem too good to be true, and to purchase helmets from reputable local or online sellers. The main target markets seem to be the US and Europe, with 90 percent of US counterfeit seizures coming from Hong Kong and China.

===Accidents from wearing at inappropriate times===

The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has warned that children should not wear bike helmets while using playground equipment, or any time when they are not biking, because of the risk of strangulation by the helmet strap should the helmet or strap be caught in playground equipment, a tree being climbed, and so on. European Standard EN 1080, which uses a weak retention system designed to open under load, was published in 1997 to address this problem.
Such helmets are not intended for use anywhere motor vehicles are present. To avoid serious accidents, parents and carers should take care to ensure that children do not wear bicycle helmets during unsupervised play, or when using climbing equipment.

==Debate over compulsion or strong promotion==

===Supporters===
The National Health Service of the United Kingdom lists wearing a helmet as one of its &quot;cycling safety tips&quot; for beginners, and it states &quot;wearing a cycling helmet can help prevent a head injury if you fall from your bike&quot;. The American Medical Association Medical Student Section has stated that &quot;helmet use is an effective public health intervention&quot;.

A number of cycling advocacy organisations support helmet use or legislation. The League of American Bicyclists &quot;has encouraged the wearing of helmets via its publications and its education program for many years. Since 1991 the League has required participants in League-sponsored events to wear helmets.&quot; Bicycle Network, Australia&#x27;s largest bike riding organisation, previously supported the helmet legislation, but is no longer supporting a mandate. Bicycle Queensland supports helmet laws, noting that &quot;ample research shows the safety benefits of wearing helmets surpasses the no-helmet personal-freedom argument&quot;.

Numerous health medical groups support helmet laws. These include the World Health Organization, the British Medical Association, the American Medical Association, the American College of Emergency Physicians, the Canadian Paediatric Society, the Canadian Academy of Sport and Exercise Medicine, and the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the (British) Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents recommend wearing helmets. Safety groups Safe Kids USA and the National Safety Council urge helmet wearing. SWOV (the Dutch Institute for Road Safety Research) recommends helmet use. Temple University&#x27;s Public Health Law Research program classifies bicycle helmets laws as an &quot;effective&quot; public health intervention, based on a review of scholarly research. The British National Children&#x27;s Bureau supports and promotes helmet use.

===Opponents===
Dorothy Robinson reviewed data from jurisdictions where helmet use increased following legislation, and concluded that helmet laws did not demonstrably reduce cyclists&#x27; head injuries. Mayer Hillman, a transport and road safety analyst from the UK, does not support the use of helmets, reasoning that they are of very limited value in the event of a collision with a car, that risk compensation negates their protective effect and because he feels their promotion implicitly shifts responsibility of care to the cyclist. He also cautions against placing the recommendations of surgeons above other expert opinion in the debate, comparing it to drawing conclusions on whether it is worthwhile to buy lottery tickets by sampling only a group of prizewinners. The prominent UK-based cycling activist John Franklin is skeptical of the merits of helmets, regarding proactive measures including bike maintenance and riding skills as being more important. Cyclists&#x27; representative groups complain that focus on helmets diverts attention from other issues which are much more important for improving bicycle safety, such as road danger reduction, training, roadcraft, and bicycle maintenance.

In 1998 the European Cyclists&#x27; Federation (ECF) adopted a position paper rejecting compulsory helmet laws as being likely to have greater negative rather than positive health effects. The UK&#x27;s largest cyclists&#x27; organisation, Cycling UK, believes that the &quot;&quot;overall health effects of compulsory helmets are negative.&quot; The Dutch &quot;Fietsersbond&quot; (Cyclists&#x27; Union) summarised existing evidence and concluded that a compulsory helmet law (for utility cyclists) would have a negative impact on population health: &quot;Helmet laws save a few brains, but destroy a lot of hearts&quot;&quot;. No policy position was provided for other types of cycling, particular mountain biking (MTB) and all forms of on- and off-road cycle sports.

Cycling Action Network (New Zealand) policy states &quot;There is evidence that mandatory cycle helmet wearing legislation is not working as intended and should be reviewed. Priority needs to be given to other safety issues such as motorist behaviour and roading improvements.&quot;

===Legislation and culture===

The following countries have mandatory helmet laws, in at least one jurisdiction, for either minors only, or for all riders: Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, Finland, Iceland, New Zealand, Sweden, and the United States. Spain requires helmets on interurban routes. In the US, 21 states have statewide mandatory helmet laws for minors of varying ages, and 37 states have mandatory helmet laws for varying age groups in varying jurisdictions. Nearly 9 in 10 American adults support helmet laws for children. Israel&#x27;s helmet law was never enforced or obeyed, and the adult element has been revoked; Mexico City has repealed its helmet law.

In 2004, a Bill proposing to make the wearing of bicycle helmets compulsory came before the UK Parliament, and was defeated. Horton observed: &quot;The 2004 Parliamentary Bill was unanimously opposed by the cycling establishment, with every major cycling organisation and magazine rejecting helmet compulsion.&quot; A 2016 Irish postage stamp originally depicting a cyclist with helmet and hi-vis vest was altered to remove those after Cycling Ireland complained that it would discourage people from taking up cycling.

Although a causal link is not proven, it is observed that the countries with the best cycle safety records (Denmark and the Netherlands) have among the lowest levels of helmet use. Their bicycle safety record is generally attributed to public awareness and understanding of cyclists, safety in numbers, education, and cycling infrastructure. A study of cycling in major streets of Boston, Paris and Amsterdam illustrates the variation in cycling culture: Boston had far higher rates of helmet-wearing (32% of cyclists, versus 2.4% in Paris and 0.1% in Amsterdam), Amsterdam had far more cyclists (242 passing bicycles per hour, versus 74 in Paris and 55 in Boston). Cycle helmet wearing rates in the Netherlands and Denmark are very low. An Australian journalist writes: &quot;&quot;Rarities in Amsterdam seem to be stretch-fabric-clad cyclists and fat cyclists. Helmets are non-existent, and when people asked me where I was from, they would grimace and mutter: &quot;Ah, yes, helmet laws.&quot; These had gained international notoriety on a par with our deadly sea animals. Despite the lack of helmets, cycling in the Netherlands is safer than in any other country, and the Dutch have one-third the number of cycling fatalities (per 100,000 people) that Australia has.&quot;&quot; Cycling UK say that cycling in the Netherlands and Denmark is perceived as a &quot;normal&quot; activity requiring no special clothing or equipment. Pucher and Buehler state: &quot;The Dutch cycling experts and planners interviewed for this paper adamantly opposed the use of helmets, claiming that helmets discourage cycling by making it less convenient, less comfortable, and less fashionable. They also mention the possibility that helmets would make cycling more dangerous by giving cyclists a false sense of safety and thus encouraging riskier riding behavior.&quot;

<text>Brentwood School is an independent, secular, coeducational day school with two campuses located four blocks apart in the Brentwood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, United States.

==History==
Brentwood Military Academy was founded by Mary McDonnell in 1902. The school moved sites multiple times under the direction of McDonnell and her family until moving to its final location in 1930. In spring 1972, it was announced that the military academy would not reopen in the fall.

The property was sold by John McDonnell to Terry Leavey Lemons and Walter Ziglar, who soon converted the school to non-profit status. Brentwood School opened in fall 1972 as a college preparatory day school serving Grades 6–10. For the first 5 years, Ziglar served as the President. He was also the chair of the first Board of Executive Directors, which included Bill Badham of Curtis School and Vern Simpson of Montclair Prep. The first headmaster was Richman Grant. Grade 11 was added in 1973, and the school graduated its first Senior class in June 1975. Brentwood School remained Grades 7-12 until 1995 when, under the guidance of Headmaster Hunter M. Temple, the school purchased the Marymount Junior School campus and opened the Lower Division. With the opening of the Lower Division in fall 1995, the school became Grades K-6 on the West Campus and Grades 7–12 on the East Campus. In 2001, the Brentwood School Athletics Complex opened on the East Campus. On December 2, 2011, four new modular classrooms were installed at Brentwood School&#x27;s East Campus. The classrooms were the first zero net energy classrooms in Los Angeles County. In the fall of 2019, Brentwood School opened a brand new Middle School building allowing its 6th Grade to join the Middle School from the Lower School, and increase enrollment size for each grade on both campuses.

==Overview==

Combined enrollment on both campuses is about 1,200 students – approximately 900 on the East Campus and 300 on the West Campus. For the 2021–2022 school year, tuition without financial support in the Lower School was $39,350 per year, while tuition in the Middle and Upper Schools were $46,550 per year. The school awards approximately $3,500,000 in need-based financial support each year. Brentwood is a highly selective school, with major admissions entry points in kindergarten, 6th, 7th, and 9th grades, and only limited openings at other grade levels. Admissions decisions are made by a committee composed of faculty and administrators. Brentwood offers a liberal arts curriculum, including over 100 courses each year, including advanced placement courses in 17 subject areas. The school year runs from August 31 to June 10.

==Demographics==
The Brentwood School community includes students who live in nearly 120 different zip codes. 19% of Brentwood School families receive financial support. In 2021, the school reported that their student community consisted of 46% students of color. In 2016, Brentwood School created an Office of Equity and Inclusion. The school has a diversity council composed of faculty, staff and administrative representatives.

==Athletics==
Brentwood School fields 83 different athletic teams in grades 4–12. Brentwood School Upper School fields 35 teams in 17 different sports. Students fill about 500 roster spots and work with more than 80 coaches. Approximately 80% of Brentwood&#x27;s students participate in at least one interscholastic sport. The school primarily employs its own teachers as coaches and requires that students maintain a certain degree of academic standing in order to participate in sports. Brentwood School has a history of hosting the annual Special Olympics Games put on in conjunction with the Special Olympics Southern California Westside Chapter. In 2003, Brentwood-area resident Arnold Schwarzenegger was the Guest of Honor and presided over the Special Olympics Games&#x27; Opening Ceremony. Since 1992, the School has also provided a venue for the Peter Vidmar Men&#x27;s Gymnastic&#x27;s Invitational, hosted by Brentwood School alumnus, Peter Vidmar. Brentwood School also has a wide variety of e-sports teams.

==Relationship with the Veteran&#x27;s Administration==
Since 1972, Brentwood School has supported the Veteran&#x27;s Administration and veterans through school engagement that includes direct services and student engagement. In 2016, Brentwood School formalized its on-going relationship with a commitment to the VA valued at close to $1.8 million annually in rent and in-kind services.

On August 29, 2013, U.S. District Judge James Otero responding to a lawsuit by the ACLU, ruled that the West Los Angeles Veterans&#x27; Administration Enhanced Sharing Agreements that allowed VA land to be leased to Brentwood School, UCLA, and other businesses were not valid As of the start of the 2014–2015 school year, the ruling that the VA must terminate those leases was under appeal to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.

The 22-acre athletic complex, built by Brentwood School on VA land, is a shared space known as the VCRE (Veterans Center for Recreation and Education). In addition to being home to Brentwood School athletics, it offers extensive recreational, vocational, educational, and wellness opportunities to veterans and their families.

<text>Magna Steyr Fahrzeugtechnik GmbH &amp; Co KG is an automobile manufacturer based in Graz, Styria, Austria, where its primary manufacturing plant is also located. It is a subsidiary of Canadian-based Magna International and was previously part of the Steyr-Daimler-Puch conglomerate.

Magna Steyr engineers develop and assemble automobiles for other companies on a contractual basis; therefore, Magna Steyr is not an automobile marque. In 2002, the company absorbed Daimler AG&#x27;s Eurostar vehicle assembly facility. With an annual production capacity of approximately 200,000 vehicles as of 2018, it is the largest contract manufacturer for automobiles worldwide. The company has several manufacturing sites, with its main car production in Graz in Austria.

Magna Steyr developed Mercedes-Benz&#x27;s &quot;4Matic&quot; all-wheel drive (AWD) system, and was the sole manufacturer of all E-Class 4Matic models between 1996 and 2006. The company also undertook substantial development on the BMW X3 and manufactured all original X3s (model code E83), and the Aston Martin Rapide. The company developed several cars on behalf of manufacturers such as the Audi TT, Fiat Bravo and Peugeot RCZ.

==History==
Magna Steyr GmbH &amp; Co KG was founded in 2001 after Magna International Inc. acquired a majority shareholding in Steyr-Daimler-Puch AG three years earlier.

During the second quarter of 2015, the Magna Steyr battery pack business was sold to Samsung SDI for approximately $120 million.

* Mercedes-Benz G-Class (1979–present)
* Jaguar I-Pace (2018–present)
* BMW Z4 (2018–present)
* Toyota GR Supra (2019–present)
* W Motors Fenyr SuperSport (2019–present)

In March 2017, Magna Steyr started to produce the new BMW 5 Series sedan; production was shared with BMW Group&#x27;s manufacturing plant in Dingolfing, Germany.

In early December 2016, Magna International announced it will build the new Jaguar I-Pace, the company’s first battery electric vehicle. Jaguar later said Magna Steyr will also assemble its E-Pace crossover, starting later in 2017. Magna Steyr confirmed the deal following Jaguar&#x27;s announcement. Production for the I-Pace started in early 2018.

In January 2020, Sony presented a concept car, the Sony Vision-S, which was developed and built in cooperation with Magna Steyr. In October 2020, Magna International announced it would build a new electric vehicle, the Fisker Ocean, while taking a 6% ownership interest in Fisker Inc. Also the Ineos Grenadier 4x4 has been developed with expertise from Magna Steyr, with subsidiary Magna Powertrain working on the development of the chassis and suspension and the car being built at the former Smartville plant at Hambach in France.

<text>Two Treatises of Government (full title: Two Treatises of Government: In the Former, The False Principles, and Foundation of Sir Robert Filmer, and His Followers, Are Detected and Overthrown. The Latter Is an Essay Concerning The True Original, Extent, and End of Civil Government) is a work of political philosophy published anonymously in 1689 by John Locke. The &quot;First Treatise&quot; attacks patriarchalism in the form of sentence-by-sentence refutation of Robert Filmer&#x27;s &quot;Patriarcha&quot;, while the &quot;Second Treatise&quot; outlines Locke&#x27;s ideas for a more civilized society based on natural rights and contract theory. The book is a key foundational text in the theory of liberalism.

This publication contrasts with former political works by Locke himself. In &quot;Two Tracts on Government&quot;, written in 1660, Locke defends a very conservative position; however, Locke never published it. In 1669, Locke co-authored the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina, which endorses aristocracy, slavery and serfdom. Some dispute the extent to which the Fundamental Constitutions of Carolina portray Locke&#x27;s own philosophy verses that of the Lord proprietors of the colony—it was a legal document written for and signed and sealed by the eight Lord proprietors to whom Charles II of England had granted the colony. In this context, Locke was only a paid secretary.

== Historical context ==
King James II of England (VII of Scotland) was overthrown in 1688 by a union of Parliamentarians and the stadtholder of the Dutch Republic William III of Oranje-Nassau (William of Orange), who as a result ascended the English throne as William III of England. He ruled jointly with Mary II, as Protestants. Mary was the daughter of James II, and had a strong claim to the English Throne.

This is now known as the Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688. Locke claims in the &quot;Preface&quot; to the &quot;Two Treatises&quot; that its purpose is to justify William III&#x27;s ascension to the throne, though Peter Laslett suggests that the bulk of the writing was instead completed between 1679–1680 (and subsequently revised until Locke was driven into exile in 1683). According to Laslett, Locke was writing his &quot;Two Treatises&quot; during the Exclusion Crisis, which attempted to prevent James II from ever taking the throne in the first place. Anthony Ashley-Cooper, 1st Earl of Shaftesbury, Locke&#x27;s mentor, patron and friend, introduced the bill, but it was ultimately unsuccessful. Richard Ashcraft, following in Laslett&#x27;s suggestion that the &quot;Two Treatises&quot; were written before the Revolution, objected that Shaftesbury&#x27;s party did not advocate revolution during the Exclusion Crisis. He suggests that they are instead better associated with the revolutionary conspiracies that swirled around what would come to be known as the Rye House Plot. Locke, Shaftesbury and many others were forced into exile; some, such as Sidney, were even executed for treason. Locke knew his work was dangerous—he never acknowledged his authorship within his lifetime.

== Publication history ==

&quot;Two Treatises&quot; was first published anonymously in December 1689 (following printing conventions of the time, its title page was marked 1690). Locke was dissatisfied with the numerous errors and complained to the publisher. For the rest of his life, he was intent on republishing the &quot;Two Treatises&quot; in a form that better reflected its intended meaning. Peter Laslett, one of the foremost Locke scholars, has suggested that Locke held the printers to a higher &quot;standard of perfection&quot; than the technology of the time would permit. Be that as it may, the first edition was indeed replete with errors. The second edition was even worse, in addition to being printed on cheap paper and sold to the poor. The third edition was much improved, but still deemed unsatisfactory by Locke. He manually corrected the third edition by hand and entrusted the publication of the fourth to his friends, as he died before it could be brought out.

&quot;Two Treatises&quot; is prefaced with Locke announcing what he aims to achieve, also mentioning that more than half of his original draft, occupying a space between the &quot;First&quot; and &quot;Second Treatises&quot;, has been irretrievably lost. Peter Laslett maintains that, while Locke may have added or altered some portions in 1689, he did not make any revisions to accommodate for the missing section; he argues, for example, that the end of the &quot;First Treatise&quot; breaks off in mid-sentence.

In 1691 &quot;Two Treatises&quot; was translated into French by David Mazzel, a French Huguenot living in the Netherlands. This translation left out Locke&#x27;s &quot;Preface,&quot; all of the &quot;First Treatise&quot;, and the first chapter of the &quot;Second Treatise&quot; (which summarised Locke&#x27;s conclusions in the &quot;First Treatise&quot;). It was in this form that Locke&#x27;s work was reprinted during the 18th century in France and in this form that Montesquieu, Voltaire and Rousseau were exposed to it. The only American edition from the 18th century was printed in 1773 in Boston; it, too, left out all of these sections. There were no other American editions until the 20th century.

== Main ideas ==
&quot;Two Treatises&quot; is divided into the &quot;First Treatise&quot; and the &quot;Second Treatise&quot;. typically shortened to &quot;Book I&quot; and &quot;Book II&quot; respectively. Before publication, however, Locke gave it greater prominence by (hastily) inserting a separate title page: &quot;An Essay Concerning the True Original, Extent and End of Civil Government.&quot; The &quot;First Treatise&quot; is focused on the refutation of Sir Robert Filmer, in particular his &quot;Patriarcha&quot;, which argued that civil society was founded on divinely sanctioned patriarchalism. Locke proceeds through Filmer&#x27;s arguments, contesting his proofs from Scripture and ridiculing them as senseless, until concluding that no government can be justified by an appeal to the divine right of kings.

The &quot;Second Treatise&quot; outlines a theory of civil society. Locke begins by describing the state of nature, and appeals to god&#x27;s creative intent in his case for human equality in this primordial context. From this, he goes on to explain the hypothetical rise of property and civilization, in the process explaining that the only legitimate governments are those that have the consent of the people. Therefore, any government that rules without the consent of the people can, in theory, be overthrown, i.e. revolutions can be just.

== &quot;First Treatise&quot; ==

The &quot;First Treatise&quot; is an extended attack on Sir Robert Filmer&#x27;s &quot;Patriarcha&quot;. Locke&#x27;s argument proceeds along two lines: first, he undercuts the Scriptural support that Filmer had offered for his thesis, and second he argues that the acceptance of Filmer&#x27;s thesis can lead only to slavery (and absurdity). Locke chose Filmer as his target, he says, because of his reputation and because he &quot;carried this Argument [&quot;jure divino&quot;] farthest, and is supposed to have brought it to perfection&quot; (1st Tr., § 5).

Filmer&#x27;s text presented an argument for a divinely ordained, hereditary, absolute monarchy. According to Filmer, the Biblical Adam in his role as father possessed unlimited power over his children and this authority passed down through the generations. Locke attacks this on several grounds. Accepting that fatherhood grants authority, he argues, it would do so only by the act of begetting, and so cannot be transmitted to one&#x27;s children because only God can create life. Nor is the power of a father over his children absolute, as Filmer would have it; Locke points to the joint power parents share over their children referred to in the Bible. In the &quot;Second Treatise&quot; Locke returns to a discussion of parental power. (Both of these discussions have drawn the interest of modern feminists such as Carole Pateman.)

Filmer also suggested that Adam&#x27;s absolute authority came from his ownership over all the world. To this, Locke responds that the world was originally held in common (a theme that will return in the &quot;Second Treatise&quot;). But, even if it were not, he argues, God&#x27;s grant to Adam covered only the land and brute animals, not human beings. Nor could Adam, or his heir, leverage this grant to enslave mankind, for the law of nature forbids reducing one&#x27;s fellows to a state of desperation, if one possesses a sufficient surplus to maintain oneself securely. And even if this charity were not commanded by reason, Locke continues, such a strategy for gaining dominion would prove only that the foundation of government lies in consent.

Locke intimates in the &quot;First Treatise&quot; that the doctrine of divine right of kings (&quot;jure divino&quot;) will eventually be the downfall of all governments. In his final chapter he asks, &quot;Who heir?&quot; If Filmer is correct, there should be only one rightful king in all the world—the heir of Adam. But since it is impossible to discover the true heir of Adam, no government, under Filmer&#x27;s principles, can require that its members obey its rulers. Filmer must therefore say that men are duty-bound to obey their present rulers. Locke writes:
I think he is the first Politician, who, pretending to settle Government upon its true Basis, and to establish the Thrones of lawful Princes, ever told the World, That he was &quot;properly a King, whose Manner of Government was by Supreme Power, by what Means soever he obtained it&quot;; which in plain &quot;English&quot; is to say, that Regal and Supreme Power is properly and truly his, who can by any Means seize upon it; and if this be, to be &quot;properly a King&quot;, I wonder how he came to think of, or where he will find, an &quot;Usurper&quot;. (1st Tr., § 79)
Locke ends the &quot;First Treatise&quot; by examining the history told in the Bible and the history of the world since then; he concludes that there is no evidence to support Filmer&#x27;s hypothesis. According to Locke, no king has ever claimed that his authority rested upon his being the heir of Adam. It is Filmer, Locke alleges, who is the innovator in politics, not those who assert the natural equality and freedom of man.

== &quot;Second Treatise&quot; ==
In the &quot;Second Treatise,&quot; Locke develops a number of notable themes. It begins with a depiction of the state of nature, wherein individuals are under no obligation to obey one another but are each themselves judge of what the law of nature requires. It also covers conquest and slavery, property, representative government, and the right of revolution.

=== State of Nature ===
Locke defines the state of nature thus:

To properly understand political power and trace its origins, we must consider the state that all people are in naturally.
That is a state of perfect freedom of acting and disposing of their own possessions and persons as they think fit within the bounds of the law of nature. People in this state do not have to ask permission to act or depend on the will of others to arrange matters on their behalf. The natural state is also one of equality in which all power and jurisdiction is reciprocal and no one has more than another. It is evident that all human beings—as creatures belonging to the same species and rank and born indiscriminately with all the same natural advantages and faculties—are equal amongst themselves. They have no relationship of subordination or subjection unless God (the lord and master of them all) had clearly set one person above another and conferred on him an undoubted right to dominion and sovereignty.

In 17th-century England, the work of Thomas Hobbes popularized theories based upon a state of nature, even as most of those who employed such arguments were deeply troubled by his absolutist conclusions. Locke&#x27;s state of nature can be seen in light of this tradition. There is not and never has been any divinely ordained monarch over the entire world, Locke argues. However, the fact that the natural state of humanity is without an institutionalized government does not mean it is lawless. Human beings are still subject to the laws of God and nature. In contrast to Hobbes, who posited the state of nature as a hypothetical possibility, Locke takes great pains to show that such a state did indeed exist. Actually, it still exists in the area of international relations where there is not and is never likely to be any legitimate overarching government (i.e., one directly chosen by all the people subject to it). Whereas Hobbes stresses the disadvantages of the state of nature, Locke points to its good points. It is free, if full of continual dangers (2nd Tr., § 123). Finally, the proper alternative to the natural state is not political dictatorship/tyranny but a government that has been established with consent of the people and the effective protection of basic human rights to life, liberty, and property under the rule of law.

Nobody in the natural state has the political power to tell others what to do. However, everybody has the right to authoritatively pronounce justice and administer punishment for breaches of the natural law. Thus, men are not free to do whatever they please. &quot;The state of nature has a law of nature to govern it, which obliges every one: and reason, which is that law, teaches all mankind, who will but consult it, that... no one ought to harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions&quot; (2nd Tr., § 6). The specifics of this law are unwritten, however, and so each is likely to misapply it in his own case. Lacking any commonly recognised, impartial judge, there is no way to correct these misapplications or to effectively restrain those who violate the law of nature.

The law of nature is therefore ill enforced in the state of nature.
IF man in the state of nature be so free, as has been said; if he be absolute lord of his own person and possessions, equal to the greatest, and subject to no body, why will he part with his freedom? Why will he give up this empire, and subject himself to the dominion and control of any other power? To which it is obvious to answer, that though in the state of nature he hath such a right, yet the enjoyment of it is very uncertain, and constantly exposed to the invasion of others: for all being kings as much as he, every man his equal, and the greater part no strict observers of equity and justice, the enjoyment of the property he has in this state is very unsafe, very unsecure. This makes him willing to quit a condition, which, however free, is full of fears and continual dangers: and it is not without reason, that he seeks out, and is willing to join in society with others, who are already united, or have a mind to unite, for the mutual preservation of their lives, liberties and estates, which I call by the general name, property. (2nd Tr., § 123)
It is to avoid the state of war that often occurs in the state of nature, and to protect their private property that men enter into civil or political society, i.e., state of society.

=== Conquest and slavery ===
Ch. 4 (&quot;Of Slavery&quot;) and Ch. 16 (&quot;Of Conquest&quot;) are sources of some confusion: the former provides a justification for slavery that can nonetheless never be met, and thus constitutes an argument against the institution, the latter concerns the rights of conquerors, which Locke seeks to challenge.

In the rhetoric of 17th-century England, those who opposed the increasing power of the kings claimed that the country was headed for a condition of slavery. Locke therefore asks, facetiously, under what conditions such slavery might be justified. He notes that slavery cannot come about as a matter of contract (which became the basis of Locke&#x27;s political system). To be a slave is to be subject to the absolute, arbitrary power of another; as men do not have this power even over themselves, they cannot sell or otherwise grant it to another. One that is deserving of death, i.e., who has violated the law of nature, may be enslaved. This is, however, but the state of war continued (2nd Tr., § 24), and even one justly a slave therefore has no obligation to obedience.

In providing a justification for slavery, he has rendered all forms of slavery as it actually exists invalid. Moreover, as one may not submit to slavery, there is a moral injunction to attempt to throw off and escape it whenever it looms. Most scholars take this to be Locke&#x27;s point regarding slavery: submission to absolute monarchy is a violation of the law of nature, for one does not have the right to enslave oneself.

The legitimacy of an English king depended on (somehow) demonstrating descent from William the Conqueror: the right of conquest was therefore a topic rife with constitutional connotations. Locke does not say that all subsequent English monarchs have been illegitimate, but he does make their rightful authority dependent solely upon their having acquired the people&#x27;s approbation.

Locke first argues that, clearly, aggressors in an unjust war can claim no right of conquest: everything they despoil may be retaken as soon as the dispossessed have the strength to do so. Their children retain this right, so an ancient usurpation does not become lawful with time. The rest of the chapter then considers what rights a just conqueror might have.

The argument proceeds negatively: Locke proposes one power a conqueror could gain, and then demonstrates how in point of fact that power cannot be claimed. He gains no authority over those that conquered with him, for they did not wage war unjustly: thus, whatever other right William may have had in England, he could not claim kingship over his fellow Normans by right of conquest. The subdued are under the conqueror&#x27;s despotical authority, but only those who actually took part in the fighting. Those who were governed by the defeated aggressor do not become subject to the authority of the victorious aggressor. They lacked the power to do an unjust thing, and so could not have granted that power to their governors: the aggressor therefore was not acting as their representative, and they cannot be punished for his actions. And while the conqueror may seize the person of the vanquished aggressor in an unjust war, he cannot seize the latter&#x27;s property: he may not drive the innocent wife and children of a villain into poverty for another&#x27;s unjust acts. While the property is technically that of the defeated, his innocent dependents have a claim that the just conqueror must honour. He cannot seize more than the vanquished could forfeit, and the latter had no right to ruin his dependents. (He may, however, demand and take reparations for the damages suffered in the war, so long as these leave enough in the possession of the aggressor&#x27;s dependants for their survival).

In so arguing, Locke accomplishes two objectives. First, he neutralises the claims of those who see all authority flowing from William I by the latter&#x27;s right of conquest. In the absence of any other claims to authority (e.g., Filmer&#x27;s primogeniture from Adam, divine anointment, etc.), all kings would have to found their authority on the consent of the governed. Second, he removes much of the incentive for conquest in the first place, for even in a just war the spoils are limited to the persons of the defeated and reparations sufficient only to cover the costs of the war, and even then only when the aggressor&#x27;s territory can easily sustain such costs (i.e., it can never be a profitable endeavour). Needless to say, the bare claim that one&#x27;s spoils are the just compensation for a just war does not suffice to make it so, in Locke&#x27;s view.

=== Property ===

In the &quot;Second Treatise&quot;, Locke claims that civil society was created for the protection of property. In saying this, he relies on the etymological root of &quot;property,&quot; Latin &quot;proprius&quot;, or what is one&#x27;s own, including oneself (cf. French &quot;propre&quot;). Thus, by &quot;property&quot; he means &quot;life, liberty, and estate.&quot; In &quot;A Letter Concerning Toleration&quot;, he wrote that the magistrate&#x27;s power was limited to preserving a person&#x27;s &quot;civil interest&quot;, which he described as &quot;life, liberty, health, and indolency of body; and the possession of outward things&quot;. By saying that political society was established for the better protection of property, he claims that it serves the private (and non-political) interests of its constituent members: it does not promote some good that can be realised only in community with others (e.g. virtue).

For this account to work, individuals must possess some property outside of society, i.e., in the state of nature: the state cannot be the sole origin of property, declaring what belongs to whom. If the purpose of government is the protection of property, the latter must exist independently of the former. Filmer had said that, if there even were a state of nature (which he denied), everything would be held in common: there could be no private property, and hence no justice or injustice (injustice being understood as treating someone else&#x27;s goods, liberty, or life as if it were one&#x27;s own). Thomas Hobbes had argued the same thing. Locke therefore provides an account of how material property could arise in the absence of government.

He begins by asserting that each individual, at a minimum, &quot;owns&quot; himself, although, properly speaking, God created man and we are God&#x27;s property; this is a corollary of each individual&#x27;s being free and equal in the state of nature. As a result, each must also own his own labour: to deny him his labour would be to make him a slave. One can therefore take items from the common store of goods by mixing one&#x27;s labour with them: an apple on the tree is of no use to anyone—it must be picked to be eaten—and the picking of that apple makes it one&#x27;s own. In an alternate argument, Locke claims that we must allow it to become private property lest all mankind have starved, despite the bounty of the world. A man must be allowed to eat, and thus have what he has eaten be his own (such that he could deny others a right to use it). The apple is surely his when he swallows it, when he chews it, when he bites into it, when he brings it to his mouth, etc.: it became his as soon as he mixed his labour with it (by picking it from the tree).

This does not yet say &quot;why&quot; an individual is allowed to take from the common store of nature. There is a necessity to do so to eat, but this does not yet establish why others must respect one&#x27;s property, especially as they labour under the like necessity. Locke assures his readers that the state of nature is a state of plenty: one may take from communal store if one leaves a) enough and b) as good for others, and since nature is bountiful, one can take all that one can use without taking anything &quot;from&quot; someone else. Moreover, one can take only so much as one can use before it spoils. There are then two provisos regarding what one can take, the &quot;enough and as good&quot; condition and &quot;spoilage.&quot;

Gold does not rot. Neither does silver, or any other precious metal or gem. They are, moreover, useless, their aesthetic value not entering into the equation. One can heap up as much of them as one wishes, or take them in trade for food. By the tacit consent of mankind, they become a form of money (one accepts gold in exchange for apples with the understanding that someone else will accept that gold in exchange for wheat). One can therefore avoid the spoilage limitation by selling all that one has amassed before it rots; the limits on acquisition thus disappear.

In this way, Locke argues that a full economic system could, in principle, exist within the state of nature. Property could therefore predate the existence of government, and thus society can be dedicated to the protection of property.

=== Representative government ===
Locke did not demand a republic. Rather, Locke felt that a legitimate contract could easily exist between citizens and a monarchy, an oligarchy or some mixed form (&quot;2nd Tr.&quot;, sec. 132). Locke uses the term Common-wealth to mean &quot;not a democracy, or any form of government, but any independent community&quot; (sec. 133) and &quot;whatever form the Common-wealth is under, the Ruling Power ought to govern by declared and received laws, and not by extemporary dictates and undetermined resolutions.&quot; (sec 137)

Locke does, however, make a distinction between an executive (e.g. a monarchy), a &quot;Power always in being&quot; (sec 144) that must perpetually execute the law, and the legislative that is the &quot;supreme power of the Common-wealth&quot; (sec 134) and does not have to be always in being. (sec 153) Furthermore, governments are charged by the consent of the individual, &quot;i.e. the consent of the majority, giving it either by themselves, or their representatives chosen by them.&quot; (sec 140)

His notions of people&#x27;s rights and the role of civil government provided strong support for the intellectual movements of both the American and French Revolutions.

=== Right of revolution ===
The concept of the right of revolution was also taken up by John Locke in &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot; as part of his social contract theory. Locke declared that under natural law, all people have the right to life, liberty, and estate; under the social contract, the people could instigate a revolution against the government when it acted against the interests of citizens, to replace the government with one that served the interests of citizens. In some cases, Locke deemed revolution an obligation. The right of revolution thus essentially acted as a safeguard against tyranny.

Locke affirmed an explicit right to revolution in &quot;Two Treatises of Government&quot;: “&quot;whenever the Legislators endeavor to take away, and destroy the Property of the People&quot;, or to reduce them to Slavery under Arbitrary Power, they put themselves into a state of War with the People, who are thereupon absolved from any farther Obedience, and are left to the common Refuge, which God hath provided for all Men, against Force and Violence. Whensoever therefore the &quot;Legislative&quot; shall transgress this fundamental Rule of Society; and either by Ambition, Fear, Folly or Corruption, &quot;endeavor to grasp&quot; themselves, &quot;or put into the hands of any other an Absolute Power&quot; over the Lives, Liberties, and Estates of the People; By this breach of Trust &quot;they forfeit the Power&quot;, the People had put into their hands, for quite contrary ends, and it devolves to the People, who have a Right to resume their original Liberty&quot;. (sec. 222)

== Reception and influence ==

=== Britain ===
Although the &quot;Two Treatises&quot; would become well known in the second half of the 18th century, they were somewhat neglected when published. Between 1689 and 1694, around 200 tracts and treatises were published concerning the legitimacy of the Glorious Revolution. Three of these mention Locke, two of which were written by friends of Locke. When Hobbes published the &quot;Leviathan&quot; in 1651, by contrast, dozens of texts were immediately written in response to it. As Mark Goldie explains: &quot;&quot;Leviathan&quot; was a monolithic and unavoidable presence for political writers in Restoration England in a way that in the first half of the eighteenth the &quot;Two Treatises&quot; was not.&quot;

While the &quot;Two Treatises&quot; did not become popular until the 1760s, ideas from them did start to become important earlier in the century. According to Goldie, &quot;the crucial moment was 1701&quot; and &quot;the occasion was the Kentish petition.&quot; The pamphlet war that ensued was one of the first times Locke&#x27;s ideas were invoked in a public debate, most notably by Daniel Defoe. Locke&#x27;s ideas did not go unchallenged and the periodical &quot;The Rehearsal&quot;, for example, launched a &quot;sustained and sophisticated assault&quot; against the &quot;Two Treatises&quot; and endorsed the ideology of patriarchalism. Not only did patriarchalism continue to be a legitimate political theory in the 18th century, but as J. G. A. Pocock and others have gone to great lengths to demonstrate, so was civic humanism and classical republicanism. Pocock has argued that Locke&#x27;s &quot;Two Treatises&quot; had very little effect on British political theory; he maintains that there was no contractarian revolution. Rather, he sees these other long-standing traditions as far more important for 18th-century British politics.

In the middle of the 18th century, Locke&#x27;s position as a political philosopher suddenly rose in prominence. For example, he was invoked by those arguing on behalf of the American colonies during the Stamp Act debates of 1765–66. Marginalized groups such as women, Dissenters and those campaigning to abolish the slave trade all invoked Lockean ideals. But at the same time, as Goldie describes it, &quot;a wind of doubt about Locke&#x27;s credentials gathered into a storm. The sense that Locke&#x27;s philosophy had been misappropriated increasingly turned to a conviction that it was erroneous&quot;. By the 1790s Locke was associated with Rousseau and Voltaire and being blamed for the American and French Revolutions as well as for the perceived secularisation of society. By 1815, Locke&#x27;s portrait was taken down from Christ Church, his alma mater (it was later restored to a position of prominence, and currently hangs in the dining hall of the college).

=== North America ===
Locke&#x27;s influence during the American Revolutionary period is disputed. While it is easy to point to specific instances of Locke&#x27;s &quot;Two Treatises&quot; being invoked, the extent of the acceptance of Locke&#x27;s ideals and the role they played in the American Revolution are far from clear. The &quot;Two Treatises&quot; are echoed in phrases in the Declaration of Independence and writings by Samuel Adams that attempted to gain support for the rebellion. Of Locke&#x27;s influence Thomas Jefferson wrote: &quot;Bacon, Locke and Newton I consider them as the three greatest men that have ever lived, without any exception, and as having laid the foundation of those superstructures which have been raised in the Physical &amp; Moral sciences&quot;. The colonists frequently cited Blackstone&#x27;s &quot;Commentaries on the Laws of England&quot;, which synthesised Lockean political philosophy with the common law tradition. Louis Hartz, writing at the beginning of the 20th century, took it for granted that Locke was the political philosopher of the revolution.

This view was challenged by Bernard Bailyn and Gordon S. Wood, who argued that the revolution was not a struggle over property, taxation, and rights, but rather &quot;a Machiavellian effort to preserve the young republic&#x27;s &#x27;virtue&#x27; from the corrupt and corrupting forces of English politics.&quot; Garry Wills, on the other hand, maintains that it was neither the Lockean tradition nor the classical republican tradition that drove the revolution, but instead Scottish moral philosophy, a political philosophy that based its conception of society on friendship, sensibility and the controlled passions. Thomas Pangle and Michael Zuckert have countered, demonstrating numerous elements in the thought of more influential founders that have a Lockean pedigree. They argue that there is no conflict between Lockean thought and classical Republicanism.

Locke&#x27;s ideas have not been without criticism with Howard Zinn arguing that the treatise &quot;ignored the existing inequalities in property. And how could people truly have equal rights, with stark differences in wealth&quot;? and others taking issue with his Labour theory of property.

== Controversies regarding interpretation ==
Locke&#x27;s political philosophy is often compared and contrasted with Thomas Hobbes’ &quot;Leviathan&quot;. The motivation in both cases is self-preservation with Hobbes arguing the need of an absolute monarch to prevent the war of &quot;all against all&quot; inherent in anarchy while Locke argues that the protection of life, liberty, and property can be achieved by a parliamentary process that protects, not violates, one&#x27;s rights.

Leo Strauss and C. B. Macpherson stress the continuity of thought. In their view Locke and Hobbes describe an atomistic man largely driven by a hedonistic materialistic acquisitiveness. Strauss&#x27; Locke is little more than Hobbes in &quot;sheep’s clothing&quot;. C. B. Macpherson argued in his &quot;Political Theory of Possessive Individualism&quot; that Locke sets the stage for unlimited acquisition and appropriation of property by the powerful creating gross inequality. Government is the protector of interests of capitalists while the &quot;labouring class [are] not considered to have an interest&quot;.

Unlike Macpherson, James Tully finds no evidence that Locke specifically advocates capitalism. In his &quot;A Discourse on Property&quot;, Tully describes Locke&#x27;s view of man as a social dependent, with Christian sensibilities, and a God-given duty to care for others. Property, in Tully&#x27;s explanation of Locke, belong to the community as the public commons but becomes &quot;private&quot; so long as the property owner, or more correctly the &quot;custodian&quot;, serves the community. Zuckert believes Tully is reading into Locke rights and duties that just aren’t there. Huyler finds that Locke explicitly condemned government privileges for rich, contrary to Macpherson&#x27;s pro-capitalism critique, but also rejected subsidies to aid the poor, in contrast to Tully&#x27;s social justice apologetics.

The Cambridge School of political thought, led principally by Quentin Skinner, J. G. A. Pocock, Richard Ashcraft, and Peter Laslett, uses a historical methodology to situate Locke in the &quot;political&quot; context of his times. But they also restrict his importance to those times. Ashcraft&#x27;s Locke takes the side of the burgeoning merchant class against the aristocracy. Neal Wood puts Locke on the side of the agrarian interests, not the manufacturing bourgeoisie.

Jerome Huyler and Michael P. Zuckert approach Locke in the broader context of his oeuvre and historical influence. Locke is situated within changing religious, philosophical, scientific, and political dimensions of 17th century England. Objecting to the use of the contemporary concept of economic man to describe Locke&#x27;s view of human nature, Huyler emphases the &quot;virtue of industriousness&quot; of Locke&#x27;s Protestant England. Productive work is man&#x27;s earthly function or calling, ordained by God and required by self-preservation. The government&#x27;s protection of property rights insures that the results of industry, i.e. &quot;fruits of one’s labor&quot;, are secure. Locke&#x27;s prohibition of ill-gotten gains, whether for well-connected gentry or the profligate, is not a lack of Locke&#x27;s foresight to the problems in the latter stages of liberalism but an application of equal protection of the law to every individual.

Richard Pipes argues that Locke holds a labor theory of value that leads to the socialist critique that those not engaging in physical labor exploit wage earners. Huyler, relying on Locke&#x27;s &quot;Essays on the Law of Nature&quot; shows that reason is the most fundamental virtue, underwrites all productive virtue, and leads to human flourishing or happiness in an Aristotelean sense.

<text>Meng Huo ( 210s–220s) was a local leader in the Nanzhong region in the state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period of China. He was popularly depicted as a local leader representing the gentries of the Nanzhong region, but some historians doubt his historical existence.

Meng Huo&#x27;s popular image comes from the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the events before and during the Three Kingdoms period. The novel portrays Meng Huo as a southern barbarian tribal leader. He also marries the fictional Lady Zhurong, who claims descent from the fire deity Zhurong. In the Beijing Opera &quot;Dragon and Phoenix Headgear&quot; Zhurong and Meng Huo has a daughter named Huaman.

==Historical sources==
Meng Huo and the record of his captures appeared in both the &quot;Han Jin Chunqiu&quot;, written by Xi Zuochi in the Eastern Jin dynasty and also in the near-contemporary &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot; written between 348 and 354 by Chang Qu. Therefore, two historical documents of different origins and known for reliability recorded events involving Meng Huo. The Liu Song historian Pei Songzhi, when compiling his annotated version of the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; found Xi Zuochi&#x27;s account reliable and annotated him to Chen Shou&#x27;s work with no further comment. The historian Sima Guang, when compiling the &quot;Zizhi Tongjian&quot;, also recorded events involving Meng Huo.

However due to Pei Songzhi&#x27;s criticism of Xi Zuochi on other parts of his work, the historian Fang Guoyu (方國瑜) used Pei&#x27;s doubts on Xi&#x27;s unreliability to challenge the story of Meng Huo&#x27;s seven captures. However, Fang did not go as far as to doubt Meng Huo&#x27;s existence.

The absurdity of Meng Huo being captured and released seven times led many to doubt the story, and even of Meng Huo&#x27;s existence. The Republican-era historian Zhang Hualan (張華爛) wrote in his article &quot;Discussion on Meng Huo&quot; (孟獲辯) that Meng was a fictional character invented by later historians, noting that the name &quot;Huo&quot; (獲), which means &quot;captured&quot; in Chinese, is too coincidental, considering Meng&#x27;s fate on being captured – a view shared by many academics.

A contrary example of this argument could be made with the given name of Liu Bei and Liu Shan. Bei (備) which means &quot;to prepare&quot; and Shan (禪) which means &quot;to give&quot; in Chinese. Just as with Meng Huo, those indicate what happened. Liu Bei prepared his kingdom and Liu Shan gave it, as noted by Qiao Zhou. Yet, those individuals are definitely not fictional. Furthermore, it is unclear if Meng Huo was of Chinese descendent or from foreign tribes. If it was the latter, then his name may have sounded similar as &quot;Huo&quot; (獲) and therefore was transcribed as such.

Huang Chengzhong (黃承宗) of the Liangshan Yi Slave Society Museum believes Meng to be a real historical figure, though he is certain that the &quot;seven times freed&quot; story is fiction.

Sichuan University professor Miao Yue (繆鉞) contended Zhuge Liang would not be able to release the leader if the latter was indeed captured. Tan Liangxiao (譚良嘯), director of the Zhuge Liang Memorial Temple in Chengdu, also stated the &quot;seven times freed&quot; story to be &quot;strange and unbelievable&quot;, but like Fang and Huang, he believes Meng Huo did exist in history.

==Life==

When the Shu Han emperor Liu Bei died in 223 CE, the local people of Nanzhong rebelled against Shu Han, stating that there were three lords claiming to be the legitimate ruler of China and they no longer knew whom they should pledge allegiance to. In retaliation, the Shu Han chancellor Zhuge Liang launched an invasion on the Nanzhong region and successfully quelled the uprising.

At the beginning of the rebellion, when Yong Kai (雍闓) saw that many people were still indecisive about this course of action. He had Meng Huo from Jianning Commandery (建寧) sent to persuade the Sou (叟) and other tribes. Meng Huo proclaimed to all of them that the government was making excessive demands of rare resources that is difficult to acquire in large numbers. The tribe people believed him and so they rejoined Yong Kai back.

After Yong Kai&#x27;s death, Meng Huo replaced him as the leader of the rebellion. During the summer, Zhuge Liang led his army and crossed the Lu River and advanced toward Yizhou Commandery (益州). He captured Meng Huo then had him brought into his camp and asked him what did he think of his army. Meng Huo answered to him &quot;I have regrets for if I knew this earlier, I would have easily defeated you.&quot;

Zhuge Liang thought that if he wanted to concentrate all his efforts in the campaigns to the north, he would have to find tricks and ways to subdue the tribes of Nanzhong since they were often in rebellion and causing chaos. So he forgave Meng Huo and had him sent back to his army. After this, the two armies fought each other seven times, Meng Huo was always captured by Zhuge Liang and he was always forgiven and released. All of this caused Meng Huo along with the tribal people and Han citizens to reconsider their rebellion and to sincerely submit. When Zhuge Liang saw Meng Huo arrived, he asked him what were his intentions. Meng Huo replied that he considered Zhuge Liang as the &quot;scourge of Heaven&quot; and never again would the people of the south dare to revolt.

After the rebellion, many talented people of the south joined the Shu Han government. Meng Huo was one of them and became a subordinate of Zhuge Liang. His highest office was Assistant to the Imperial Counsellor (御史中丞).

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==

:Extracts from the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; about Meng Huo:

;Chapter 87
* &quot;In the third year of Jianxing, a bulletin came to Yi Province announcing, &quot;Meng Huo has led 100,000 Nanman tribesmen across our borders to plunder the villages.&quot;&quot;
* &quot;Despite protest from Court Councillor Wang Lian, Zhuge Liang leaves to lead 500,000 soldiers against the southern forces.&quot;
* &quot;The Shu forces were led by Zhuge Liang. Zhao Yun and Wei Yan were his generals, their lieutenants being Wang Ping and Zhang Ni.&quot;
* &quot;Meng Huo speaks to Zhuge Liang, &quot;The whole of the riverlands once belonged to another. Your lord seized it by force and proclaimed himself emperor. My ancestors held these lands, which you have encroached upon so barbarically.&quot;&quot;

;Chapter 88
* &quot;Zhuge Liang captures and frees Meng Huo: &quot;I can catch him again with ease whenever I choose to. But pacification of the south requires that we subdue the hearts of the Nanman people.&quot;&quot;
* &quot;During the conquest, Meng Huo was captured on seven different occasions, by Zhuge Liang. In addition, many Nanman generals and lieutenants were captured and treated with kindness. This caused many withdrawals and eventually the pacification of the south.&quot;

;Chapter 90
* Zhuge Liang: &quot;I guessed the enemy would be looking for an ambush in the woods, so I set up decoy banners there to confuse them. There were never any troops. Next, I had Wei Yan lose a series of battles to strengthen their confidence... I ordered Ma Dai to deploy the black wagons in the valley - they had been loaded earlier with fire launchers called &#x27;earth thunder&#x27;, each containing nine missiles... We cut off the road and burned out the enemy...&quot;&quot;
* &quot;Finally, Meng Huo admits defeat: &quot;Seven times captured, seven times freed! Such a thing has never happened! Though I stand beyond the range of imperial grace, I am not utterly ignorant of ritual, of what propriety and honour require. No, I am not so shameless!&quot; He then stripped off one of his sleeves (a sign of swearing oath) and pledged: &quot;By the Chancellor&#x27;s celestial might, the Southerners will never rebel again.&quot;&quot;

==Legacy==

The Yi considered Meng Huo one of their rulers and called him Mot Hop (Yi language: ꂽꉼ).
Meng Huo is featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot; video game series. He also appears as a playable general in &quot;The Furious Wild&quot; DLC for the strategy video game, &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot;.

<text>The Salon (), or rarely Paris Salon (French: &quot;Salon de Paris&quot; ), beginning in 1667 was the official art exhibition of the in Paris. Between 1748 and 1890 it was arguably the greatest annual or biennial art event in the Western world. At the Salon of 1761, thirty-three painters, nine sculptors, and eleven engravers contributed. From 1881 onward, it was managed by the Société des Artistes Français.

== Origins ==
In 1667, the royally sanctioned French institution of art patronage, the (a division of the Académie des beaux-arts), held its first semi-public art exhibit at the Salon Carré. The Salon&#x27;s original focus was the display of the work of recent graduates of the École des Beaux-Arts, which was created by Cardinal Mazarin, chief minister of France, in 1648. Exhibition at the Salon de Paris was essential for any artist to achieve success in France for at least the next 200 years. Exhibition in the Salon marked a sign of royal favor.

In 1725, the Salon was held in the Palace of the Louvre, when it became known as &quot;Salon&quot; or &quot;Salon de Paris&quot;. In 1737, the exhibitions, held from 18 August 1737 to 5 September 1737 at the Grand Salon of the Louvre, became public. They were held, at first, annually, and then biennially, in odd-numbered years. They would start on the feast day of St. Louis (25 August) and run for some weeks. Once made regular and public, the Salon&#x27;s status was &quot;never seriously in doubt&quot;. In 1748 a jury of awarded artists was introduced. From this time forward, the influence of the Salon was undisputed.

== Prominence (1748–1890) ==

The Salon exhibited paintings floor-to-ceiling and on every available inch of space. The jostling of artwork became the subject of many other paintings, including Pietro Antonio Martini&#x27;s &quot;Salon of 1785&quot;. Printed catalogues of the Salons are primary documents for art historians. Critical descriptions of the exhibitions published in the gazettes mark the beginning of the modern occupation of art critic. The French salon, a product of the Enlightenment in the early 18th century, was a key institution in which women played a central role. Salons provided a place for women and men to congregate for intellectual discourse.

The French Revolution opened the exhibition to foreign artists. The Salon of 1824 was noted for its displays of British paintings by John Constable, Thomas Lawrence and Richard Parkes Bonington. by In the 19th century the idea of a public Salon extended to an annual government-sponsored juried exhibition of new painting and sculpture, held in large commercial halls, to which the ticket-bearing public was invited. The &quot;vernissage&quot; (varnishing) of opening night was a grand social occasion, and a crush that gave subject matter to newspaper caricaturists like Honoré Daumier. Charles Baudelaire, Denis Diderot and others wrote reviews of the Salons.

After the French Revolution of 1848 liberalized the Salon, far fewer works were refused. Medals were introduced in 1849.

=== Early splinter groups ===
The increasingly conservative and academic juries were not receptive to the Impressionist painters, whose works were usually rejected, or poorly placed if accepted. The Salon opposed the Impressionists&#x27; shift away from traditional painting styles. In 1863 the Salon jury turned away an unusually high number of the submitted paintings. An uproar resulted, particularly from regular exhibitors who had been rejected. In order to prove that the Salons were democratic, Napoleon III instituted the Salon des Refusés, containing a selection of the works that the Salon had rejected that year. It opened on 17 May 1863, marking the birth of the avant-garde. The Impressionists held their own independent exhibitions in 1874, 1876, 1877, 1879, 1880, 1881, 1882 and 1886.

In 1881 the government withdrew official sponsorship from the annual Salon, and a group of artists organized the Société des Artistes Français to take responsibility for the show.

== Secessions ==
In December 1890, the leader of the &quot;Société des Artistes Français&quot;, William-Adolphe Bouguereau, proposed that the Salon should be an exhibition of young, not-yet-awarded, artists. Ernest Meissonier, Puvis de Chavannes, Auguste Rodin and others rejected the proposal and broke way to create the Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts, with its own exhibition, immediately referred to in the press as the &quot;Salon du Champ de Mars&quot; or the &quot;Salon de la Société Nationale des Beaux–Arts&quot;. Soon, it was also widely known as the &quot;Nationale&quot;.

In 1903, in response to what many artists at the time felt was a bureaucratic and conservative organization, a group of painters and sculptors, led by Pierre-Auguste Renoir and Auguste Rodin, organized the .

As the number of salons increased, American newspapers sometimes referred to the original salon as the &quot;Salon of the Champs Elysees&quot;.

<doc id="910821" wikidata="Q135598" url="?curid=910821" title="Discourse on Inequality">
<text>Discourse on the Origin and Basis of Inequality Among Men (), also commonly known as the &quot;Second Discourse&quot;, is a 1755 treatise by philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, on the topic of social inequality and its origins. The work was written in 1754 as Rousseau&#x27;s entry in a competition by the Academy of Dijon, and was published in 1755. 

Rousseau first exposes in this work his conception of a human state of nature (broadly believed to be a hypothetical thought exercise) and of human perfectibility, an early idea of progress. He then explains the way in which, in his view, people may have established civil society, and this leads him to conclude that private property is the original source and basis of all inequality.

==Context==
The text was written in 1754 in response to a prize competition of the Academy of Dijon answering the prompt: &quot;What is the origin of inequality among people, and is it authorized by natural law?&quot; As with his &quot;Discourse on the Arts and Sciences&quot;, Rousseau answered in the negative. He did not win with his treatise (as he had for the &quot;Discourse on the Arts and Sciences&quot;); a canon of Besançon by the name of François Xavier Talbert (l&#x27;abbé Talbert) did. The &quot;Discourse on Inequality&quot; was written in part to contradict the claims made by Locke, Hobbes, and Pufendorf in their discussions of the state of nature. Rousseau published the text in 1755.

==Argument==
Rousseau&#x27;s text is divided into four main parts: the dedication, the preface, an extended inquiry into the nature of the human being and another inquiry into the evolution of the human species within society. It also includes an appendix that elaborates primarily on eighteenth century anthropological research throughout the text. Rousseau discusses two types of inequality: natural, or physical inequality, and ethical, or moral inequality. Natural inequality involves differences between one human&#x27;s body and that of another—it is a product of nature. Rousseau is not concerned with this type of inequality because he claims it is not the root of the inequality found in civil society. Instead, he argues moral inequality is unique to civil society and is evinced in differences in &quot;wealth, nobility or rank, power and personal merit.&quot; This type of inequality is established by convention. Rousseau appears to take a cynical view of civil society, where man has strayed from his &quot;natural state&quot; of individual independence and freedom to satisfy his individual needs and desires.

His discussion begins with an analysis of a natural man who bears, along with some developed animal species, instincts for self-preservation—a non-destructive love of self (&quot;amour de soi&quot;)—and a &quot;natural repugnance&quot; to suffering—a natural pity or compassion (&quot;pitié&quot;). Natural man acts only for his own sake and avoids conflicts with other animals (and humans). Rousseau&#x27;s natural man is more or less like any other animal, with &quot;self-preservation being his chief and almost sole concern&quot; and &quot;the only goods he recognizes in the universe&quot; being food, a female, and sleep... Rousseau&#x27;s man is a &quot;savage&quot; man. He is a loner and self-sufficient. Any battle or skirmish was only to protect himself. The natural man was in prime condition, fast, and strong, capable of caring for himself. He killed only for his own self-preservation.

Natural man&#x27;s anthropological distinction (from the animal kingdom) is based on his capacity for &quot;perfectibility&quot; and innate sense of his freedom. The former, although translated as &quot;perfectibility,&quot; has nothing to do with a drive for perfection or excellence, which might confuse it with virtue ethics. Instead, perfectibility describes how humans can learn by observing others. Human freedom does not mean the capacity to choose, which would require reason, but instead the ability to refrain from instinct. Only with such a capacity can humans acquire new habits and practices.

The most important feature of Rousseau&#x27;s natural man is that he lacks reason, in contrast to most of the Western intellectual tradition. Rousseau claims natural man does not possess reason or language (in which reason&#x27;s generation is rooted) or society—and these three things are mutually-conditioning, such that none can come into being without the others.

Rousseau&#x27;s natural man significantly differs from, and is a response to, that of Hobbes; Rousseau says as much at various points throughout his work. He thinks that Hobbes conflates human being in the state of nature with human being in civil society. Unlike Hobbes&#x27;s natural man, Rousseau&#x27;s is not motivated by fear of death because he cannot conceive of that end; thus fear of death already suggests a movement out of the state of nature. Also, this natural man, unlike Hobbes&#x27;s, is not in constant state of fear and anxiety. Rousseau&#x27;s natural man possesses a few qualities that allow him to distinguish himself from the animals over a long period of time.

The process by which natural man becomes civilized is uncertain in the &quot;Discourse&quot;, but it could have had two or three different causes. The most likely causes are environmental, such that humans came into closer proximity and began cohabitation, which in turn facilitated the development of reason and language. Equally, human &quot;perfectibility&quot; could explain this change in the nature of the human being. Rousseau is not really interested in explaining the development, but acknowledges its complexity.

What is important is that with primitive social existence (preceding civil society), humans gain &quot;amour propre&quot;(&quot;self-esteem&quot;, &quot;self-love&quot;, or &quot;vanity&quot;) and most of the rest of Rousseau&#x27;s account is based on this. Rousseau&#x27;s critique of civil society is primarily based on psychological features of civil man, with &quot;amour propre&quot; pushing individuals to compare themselves with others, to gain a sense of self corresponding to this, and to dissolve natural man&#x27;s natural pity: &quot;the savage lives within himself, sociable man, always outside himself, can only live in the opinion of others&quot;. For Rousseau, &quot;amour propre&quot; did not exist in the state of nature - &quot;amour de soi&quot; and &quot;pitié&quot; were enough to ensure survival.

The beginning of part two dramatically imagines some lone errant soul planting the stakes that first establish private property: &quot;The first person who, having enclosed a plot of land, took it into his head to say this is mine and found people simple enough to believe him, was the true founder of civil society&quot;. But Rousseau then clarifies that this moment was presaged by a series of environmental and rational conditions that made it possible. For Rousseau, even the &quot;concept&quot; of private property required a series of other concepts in order to be formed.

The inequality that began with the establishment of private property was progressively exacerbated into slavery, despotism, and corruption. Rousseau asserted that the stage of human development associated with what he called &quot;savages&quot; was the best or optimal in human development, between the less-than-optimal extreme of brute animals on the one hand and the extreme of decadent civilization on the other. &quot;...[N]othing is so gentle as man in his primitive state, when placed by nature at an equal distance from the stupidity of brutes and the fatal enlightenment of civil man&quot;. Rousseau argues that it is not possible to return to the state of nature. He did believe, however, that it was possible to correct some of the mistakes that were made in the transition to civilisation. Rousseau returned to this theme in &quot;The Social Contract&quot;.

==Dedication==
The work is dedicated to the state of Geneva, Rousseau&#x27;s birthplace. On the face of the dedication, he praises Geneva as a good, if not perfect, republic. The qualities he picks out for praise include the stability of its laws and institutions, the community spirit of its inhabitants, and its good relations with neighboring states, neither threatening them nor threatened by them, and the well-behaved women of Geneva. However, this is not how Geneva truly was. This is the type of regime Rousseau wished for. The epistle dedicatory is a highly ironic and idealized version of the Geneva Rousseau really wanted. Also, his description is in great contrast with Paris, where he had spent many years previous to writing this discourse, and which he had left bitterly. Thus, his description of Geneva is in part a statement against Paris.

<text>Stack-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that relies on one or more stacks to manipulate data and/or pass parameters. Programming constructs in other programming languages need to be modified for use in a stack-oriented system. Most stack-oriented languages operate in &quot;postfix&quot; or Reverse Polish notation: arguments or parameters for a command are listed before that command. For example, postfix notation would be written instead of (&quot;prefix&quot; or Polish notation), or (&quot;infix&quot; notation). The programming languages Forth, Factor, RPL, PostScript, BibTeX style design language and many assembly languages fit this paradigm.

Stack-based algorithms manipulate data by popping data from and pushing data to the stack. Operators govern how the stack manipulates data. To emphasize the effect of a statement, a comment is often used showing the top of the stack before and after the statement; this is known as the stack effect diagram. Some stack-oriented languages may use multiple stacks for different purposes; for example, PostScript uses separate stacks for variables, dictionaries, procedures, some typical procedures, and control flow statements. Analysis of the language model allows expressions and programs to be interpreted simply.

== Stack-based algorithms ==
PostScript is an example of a postfix stack-based language. An expression example in this language is (&#x27;mul&#x27; being the command for the multiplication operation). Calculating the expression involves understanding how stack orientation works.

Stack orientation can be presented as the following conveyor belt analogy. At the end of a conveyor belt (the &quot;input&quot;), plates marked codice_1, codice_2, and codice_3 are placed in sequence. The plate at the end of the conveyor (codice_1) can be taken, however other plates cannot be accessed until the plate at the end is removed. The plates can only be stored in a stack, and can only be added or removed from atop the stack, not from the middle or bottom. Blank plates (and a marker) can be supplied and plates can be permanently discarded.

Take plate codice_1 and put it on the stack, then take plate codice_2 and put it on the stack. Next, take the codice_3 plate. This is an instruction to perform. Then, take the top two plates off the stack, multiply their labels (codice_1 and codice_2), and write the result (codice_10) on a new plate. Discard the two old plates (codice_1 and codice_2) and the plate codice_3, and put the new plate on the stack. With no more plates remaining on the conveyor, the result of the calculation (codice_10) is shown on the plate atop the stack.

This is a very simple calculation. What if a more complex calculation is needed, such as ? If it is first written in postfix form, that is, ,
the calculation can be performed in exactly the same manner and achieve the correct result. The steps of the calculation are shown in the table below. Each column shows an input element (the plate at the end of the conveyor), and the contents of the stack after processing that input.

After processing all the input, the stack contains codice_15, which is the answer.

From this, the following can be concluded: a stack-based programming language has only one way to handle data, by taking one piece of data from atop the stack, termed &quot;pop&quot;ping, and putting data back atop the stack, termed &quot;push&quot;ing. Any expression that can be written &quot;conventionally&quot;, or in another programming language, can be written in postfix (or prefix) form and thus be amenable to being interpreted by a stack-oriented language.

== Stack manipulation ==
Since the stack is the key means to manipulate data in a stack-oriented language, such languages often provide some sort of stack manipulation operators. Commonly provided are codice_16, to duplicate the element atop the stack, codice_17 (or codice_18), to exchange elements atop the stack (the first becomes second and the second becomes first), codice_19, to cyclically permute elements in the stack or on part of the stack, codice_20 (or codice_21), to discard the element atop the stack (push is implicit), and others. These become key in studying procedures.

== Stack effect diagrams ==
As an aid to understanding the effect of the statement, a short comment is used showing the top of the stack before and after the statement. The top of the stack is rightmost if there are multiple items. This notation is commonly used in the Forth language, where comments are enclosed in parentheses.

( before -- after )

For example, the basic Forth stack operators are described:
dup ( a -- a a )
drop ( a -- )
swap ( a b -- b a )
over ( a b -- a b a )
rot ( a b c -- b c a )
The codice_22 function below is described:

fib ( n -- n&#x27; )

It is equivalent to preconditions and postconditions in Hoare logic. Both comments may also be referenced as assertions, though not necessarily in the context of Stack-based languages.

== PostScript stacks ==
PostScript and some other stack languages have other separate stacks for other purposes.

=== Variables and dictionaries ===
The evaluation of different expressions has already been analysed. The implementation of variables is important for any programming language, but for stack-oriented languages, it is of special concern, as there is only one way to interact with data.

The way variables are implemented in stack-oriented languages such as PostScript usually involves a separate, specialized stack which holds &quot;dictionaries&quot; of key-value pairs. To create a variable, a key (the variable name) must be created first, with which a value is then associated. In PostScript, a name data object is prefixed with a codice_23, so codice_24 is a name data object which can be associated with, for example, the number codice_25. The codice_26 command is codice_27, so

codice_28

associates with the name codice_29 with the number codice_25 in the dictionary atop the stack. A difference exists between codice_24 and codice_29 – the former is a data object representing a name, and codice_29 stands for what is defined under codice_24.

=== Procedures ===
A procedure in a stack-based programming language is treated as a data object in its own right. In PostScript, procedures are denoted between codice_35 and codice_36.

For example, in PostScript syntax,

codice_37

represents an anonymous procedure to duplicate what is on the top of the stack and then multiply the result – a squaring procedure.

Since procedures are treated as simple data objects, names with procedures can be defined. When they are retrieved, they are executed directly.

Dictionaries provide a means of controlling scoping, as well as storing definitions.

Since data objects are stored in the top-most dictionary, an unexpected ability arises naturally: when looking up a definition from a dictionary, the topmost dictionary is checked, then the next, and so on. If a procedure is defined that has the same name as another already defined in a different dictionary, the local one will be called.

=== Anatomy of some typical procedures ===
Procedures often take arguments. They are handled by the procedure in a very specific way, different from that of other programming languages.

To examine a Fibonacci number program in PostScript:
 /fib
 dup dup 1 eq exch 0 eq or not
 dup 1 sub fib
 exch 2 sub fib
 add
 } if
 } def

A recursive definition is used on the stack. The Fibonacci number function takes one argument. First, it is tested for being 1 or 0.

Decomposing each of the program&#x27;s key steps, reflecting the stack, assuming calculation of codice_38 :
 stack: 4
 dup
 stack: 4 4
 dup
 stack: 4 4 4
 1 eq
 stack: 4 4 false
 exch
 stack: 4 false 4
 0 eq
 stack: 4 false false
 or
 stack: 4 false
 not
 stack: 4 true

Since the expression evaluates to true, the inner procedure is evaluated.
 stack: 4
 dup
 stack: 4 4
 1 sub
 stack: 4 3
 fib
: &quot;(recursive call here)&quot;
 stack: 4 F(3)
 exch
 stack: F(3) 4
 2 sub
 stack: F(3) 2
 fib
: &quot;(recursive call here)&quot;
 stack: F(3) F(2)
 add
 stack: F(3)+F(2)
which is the expected result.

This procedure does not use named variables, purely the stack. Named variables can be created by using the codice_39 construct. For example, codice_40

is a squaring procedure with a named variable codice_41. Assuming that codice_42 and codice_43 is called, the procedure codice_44 is analysed in the following way:
 stack: 3 /n
 exch
 stack: /n 3
 def
 stack: &quot;empty&quot; (it has been defined)
 n
 stack: 3
 n
 stack: 3 3
 mul
 stack: 9
which is the expected result.

=== Control and flow ===
As there exist anonymous procedures, flow control can arise naturally. Three pieces of data are required for an if-then-else statement: a condition, a procedure to be done if the condition is true, and one to be done if the condition is false. In PostScript for example,
 2 3 gt { (2 is greater than three) = } { (2 is not greater than three) = } ifelse

performs the near equivalent in C:

 if (2 &gt; 3) { printf(&quot;2 is greater than three\n&quot;); } else { printf(&quot;2 is not greater than three\n&quot;); }

Looping and other constructs are similar.

== Analysis of the language model ==
The simple model provided in a stack-oriented language allows expressions and programs to be interpreted simply and theoretically evaluated much faster, since no syntax analysis needs to be done but lexical analysis. The way such programs are written facilitates being interpreted by machines, which is why PostScript suits printers well for its use. However, the slightly artificial way of writing PostScript programs can form an initial barrier to understanding stack-oriented languages such as PostScript.

While the ability to shadow by overriding inbuilt and other definitions can make programs hard to debug, and irresponsible use of this feature can cause unpredictable behaviour, it can simplify some functions greatly. For example, in PostScript use, the codice_45 operator can be overridden with a custom one that applies a certain style to the page, instead of having to define a custom operator or repeat code to generate the style.

<doc id="910851" wikidata="Q914139" url="?curid=910851" title="A Letter Concerning Toleration">
<text>A Letter Concerning Toleration (Epistola de tolerantia) by John Locke was originally published in 1689. Its initial publication was in Latin, and it was immediately translated into other languages. Locke&#x27;s work appeared amidst a fear that Catholicism might be taking over England and responds to the problem of religion and government by proposing religious toleration as the answer. This &quot;letter&quot; is addressed to an anonymous &quot;Honored Sir&quot;: this was Locke&#x27;s close friend Philipp van Limborch, who published it without Locke&#x27;s knowledge.

==Background==
In the wake of the discovery of the Rye House Plot and Charles II&#x27;s persecution of the Whigs, Locke fled England to Amsterdam in the Dutch Republic in September 1683. Throughout his life, Locke was interested in the debate about religious toleration. The question was much debated in Holland during Locke&#x27;s stay, and in October 1685, Louis XIV of France revoked the Edict of Nantes that had guaranteed religious toleration for French Protestants.

In the Dutch Republic, Locke met Philipp van Limborch, a Professor of Divinity. It was to be a discussion with Limborch that persuaded Locke to temporarily put aside his work on &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot; and put forth his ideas on toleration. Locke wrote the &quot;Letter&quot; during the winter of 1685–86.

==Argument of the &quot;Letter&quot;==
One of the founders of Empiricism, Locke develops a philosophy that is contrary to the one expressed by Thomas Hobbes in &quot;Leviathan&quot;, in supporting toleration for various Christian denominations. Hobbes did allow individuals to maintain their own religious beliefs as long as they outwardly expressed those of the state, however, and it has been argued that Locke&#x27;s rejection of Catholic Imperialism was the ultimate basis for his rejection of the government&#x27;s interest in spiritual salvation.

&quot;That church can have no right to be tolerated by the magistrate,&quot; Locke argued, &quot;which is so constituted that all who enter it &quot;ipso facto&quot; pass into the allegiance and service of another prince&quot;. If this were to be tolerated, &quot;the magistrate would make room for a foreign jurisdiction in his territory and...allow for his people to be enlisted as soldiers against his government&quot;. This has been interpreted by historians as a reference to the Catholic Church, with the Pope being the prince to whom Catholics owed allegiance.

However, more recently, scholars have challenged the idea that Locke opposed tolerating Catholics in all circumstances. Mark Goldie argues that the traditional interpretation of Locke&#x27;s position on Catholics &quot;needs finessing, since he did not exclude the theoretical possibility of tolerating Catholics...if Catholics could discard their uncivil beliefs, they could then be tolerated&quot;. Goldie asserts that Locke was opposed not to Catholicism as such but antinomianism, the belief that ordinary moral laws are superseded by religious truth. Scott Sowerby also claims that Locke left open the possibility that Catholics could be tolerated if they adopted tolerant principles and rejected political allegiance to the Pope.

John Marshall has argued that several passages in the &quot;Letter&quot; demonstrate that Locke believed that Catholics &quot;in their terms of worship and religious speculative beliefs...deserved their worship to be free&quot;. Marshall also notes that &quot;The combination of Locke’s comments in the Letter suggests that during [its] composition ... Locke was once again struggling over how to discriminate between the series of associated political principles which for him made Catholics intolerable, and the religious worship and other religious beliefs of Catholics which deserved toleration.&quot; A confirmation of these positions seems to come from a 2019 discovery of a previously unknown manuscript, dated 1667–8, titled &quot;&quot;, in which Locke makes his earliest arguments for religious toleration.

In one of the last paragraphs, Locke argued against atheists: &quot;Lastly, those are not at all to be tolerated who deny the being of a God. Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon an atheist. The taking away of God, though but even in thought, dissolves all; besides also, those that by their atheism undermine and destroy all religion, can have no pretence of religion whereupon to challenge the privilege of a toleration. As for other practical opinions, though not absolutely free from all error, if they do not tend to establish domination over others or civil impunity to the Church in which they are taught, there can be no reason why they should not be tolerated.&quot; This critique excluded all atheistic varieties of philosophy and all attempts to deduce ethics and natural law from purely secular premises. There exists also a passage added in a later edition of the &quot;Essay concerning Human Understanding&quot;, where Locke perhaps questioned &quot;whether &#x27;atheism&#x27; was necessarily inimical to political obedience.&quot;

Toleration is central to Locke&#x27;s political philosophy. Consequently, only churches that teach tolerance are allowed in his society. Locke&#x27;s view on the difficulty of knowing the one true religion may suggest that religion is not personally important to Locke. Still, it also may point to the deep uncertainties surrounding religious belief in a time of political and intellectual conflict. In contrast, Locke&#x27;s view on atheism suggests that he was far from considering religion unimportant. As an empiricist, he considered practical considerations, such as how the peace of civil society would be affected by religious toleration. Closely reading the text also reveals that Locke relies on Biblical analysis at several key points in his argument.

==Reception==
There were immediate responses from the High Church Anglican clergy, published by Thomas Long and Jonas Proast. Long believed the letter represented an atheistically disguised Jesuit plot for the Roman Catholic Church to gain dominance by bringing chaos and ruin to the English Church and State. Proast attacked the Letter and defended the view that the government has the right to use force to cause dissenters to reflect on the merits of Anglicanism, the True Religion. Locke&#x27;s reply to Proast developed into an extended, controversial exchange.

<text>Gräfin Mariza (; &quot;Countess Maritza&quot;) is an operetta in three acts composed by Hungarian composer Emmerich Kálmán, with a German libretto by Julius Brammer and Alfred Grünwald. It premiered in Vienna on 28 February 1924 at the Theater an der Wien.

==English adaptations==

As &quot;Countess Maritza&quot;, it made its New York City debut on 18 September 1926 at the Shubert Theatre, in an adaptation by Harry B. Smith, and with interpolated music by other composers, playing 318 performances, with Yvonne d&#x27;Arle in the title role on opening night. The show was staged by J. C. Huffman.

As &quot;Maritza&quot;, it opened in London at the Palace Theatre on 6 July 1938, with Mary Losseff in the title role.

A London revival by New Sadler&#x27;s Wells Opera opened at Sadler&#x27;s Wells Theatre in February 1983, with a new English book and lyrics by Nigel Douglas, starring Marilyn Hill Smith (Maritza), Ramon Remedios (Tassilo), Laureen Livingstone (Lisa), Lynn Barber (Manja) and Tudor Davies (Zsupan) conducted by Barry Wordsworth.

==Roles==
== Synopsis ==

:Place: Hungary: the manor and estate of the Countess Maritza
:Time: Around 1920.

Manja the gypsy girl flirts with the newly appointed bailiff, Béla Törek. Unknown to anyone, Törek is in fact the impoverished Count Tassilo, who is seeking to earn a living and set aside some cash for the dowry of his sister Lisa. The Countess Maritza, a young widow, unexpectedly arrives at the estate to celebrate her engagement. This &#x27;engagement&#x27; is however quite fictitious, an invention intended to put off her numerous followers. The name she has chosen for her suitor, based on her recollection of Strauss&#x27; operetta, &quot;The Gypsy Baron&quot;, is Baron Koloman Zsupán. However, amongst Maritza&#x27;s guests, to Tassilo&#x27;s horror, is Lisa, who he instructs to keep their relationship and his identity strictly secret. Maritza is also embarrassed when a genuine Koloman Zsupán materialises, having seen an announcement of his &#x27;engagement&#x27; in the press.
Tassilo is heard by the guests singing an air &quot;Komm, Zigány&quot; (&quot;Come, gypsies!&quot;), which he ends with a czardas. Maritza orders him to repeat it; he refuses, and the angry countess announces that he is fired. Manja predicts that The Countess will be very happy in love. &quot;One moon will pass over this Earth and Maritza will find her happiness&quot;, she sings. Maritza therefore decides to remain on her estate. She stops Tassilo from leaving and apologises.

Zsupan has meanwhile decided that he prefers Lisa to Maritza, whilst Maritza is increasingly attracted to Tassilo. However, the ageing Lothario Populescu reveals to Maritza Tassilo&#x27;s identity, and moreover alleges that Lisa is his girlfriend. Maritza in a high temper insults Tassilo, who declares that he will leave. However, before he goes, the repentant Maritza writes him a &#x27;reference&#x27; which is in fact a proposal of marriage. The operetta ends with Maritza and Tassilo, and Zsupan and Lisa, engaged.

<text>The LaRouche criminal trials in the mid-1980s stemmed from federal and state investigations into the activities of American political activist Lyndon LaRouche and members of his movement. They were charged with conspiring to commit fraud and soliciting loans they had no intention of repaying. LaRouche and his supporters disputed the charges, claiming the trials were politically motivated.

In 1986, hundreds of state and federal officers raided LaRouche offices in Virginia and Massachusetts. A federal grand jury in Boston indicted LaRouche and 12 associates on credit card fraud and obstruction of justice. The subsequent trial, described as an &quot;extravaganza&quot;, was repeatedly delayed and ended in mistrial. Following the mistrial, a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, indicted LaRouche and six associates. After a short trial in 1988, LaRouche was convicted of mail fraud, conspiracy to commit mail fraud, and tax evasion, and was sentenced to prison for fifteen years. He entered prison in 1989 and was paroled five years later. At the same trial, his associates received lesser sentences for mail fraud and conspiracy. In separate state trials in Virginia and New York, 13 associates received terms ranging from one month to 77 years. The Virginia state trials were described as the highest-profile cases that the state Attorney General&#x27;s office had ever prosecuted. Fourteen states issued injunctions against LaRouche-related organizations. Three LaRouche-related organizations were forced into bankruptcy after failing to pay contempt of court fines.

Defense lawyers filed numerous unsuccessful appeals that challenged the conduct of the grand jury, the contempt fines, the execution of the search warrants and various trial procedures. At least ten appeals were heard by the United States court of appeals, and three were appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark joined the defense team for two appeals. Following the convictions, the LaRouche movement mounted failed attempts at exoneration.

== Background ==
Beginning in the late 1960s and early 1970s, Lyndon LaRouche formed a variety of political organizations, including the U.S. Labor Party and the National Democratic Policy Committee. These organizations served as the platforms for presidential campaigns by LaRouche starting in 1976, and by his followers in scores of local races. According to one candidate, supporters viewed LaRouche as &quot;the greatest political leader and economist of the 20th century, and they&#x27;re proud to be associated with him. They feel he&#x27;s leading the battle to save Western civilization.&quot; The &quot;Survey of Jewish Affairs, 1987&quot; called the LaRouche movement one of the two most prominent &quot;extremist political groups&quot; of 1986.

The movement&#x27;s greatest electoral success came in 1986 when two supporters, Janice Hart and Mark J. Fairchild, won the Democratic Party nominations for Illinois Secretary of State and Lieutenant Governor. Both lost in the general election. Also in 1986, the &quot;Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee&quot; (PANIC) got an initiative on the California ballot, Proposition 64 (also known as the &quot;LaRouche Initiative&quot;), which attracted widespread opposition and was defeated that November.

== Investigations ==
=== Early 1980s ===
According to arguments made by LaRouche&#x27;s attorneys in later appeals, the government investigations were started under the FBI&#x27;s COINTELPRO in the 1960s. Edward Spannaus, a defendant in the trials, further notes that there was a memorandum written on January 12, 1983, by former FBI chief William Webster to Oliver &quot;Buck&quot; Revell, head of the Bureau&#x27;s General Investigative Division. It requested information on the funding of LaRouche and the U.S. Labor Party, including whether the U.S. Labor Party might be funded by hostile intelligence agencies. The LaRouche organization asserts that this formulation was specifically tailored to enable FBI &quot;active measures&quot; against LaRouche under Executive Order 12333, which permits such measures if a political movement receives foreign funding. The memo was eventually obtained by LaRouche&#x27;s attorneys and submitted as an exhibit in the 1987 trial of LaRouche and co-defendants in Boston.

In August 1982, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger sent a memo to Webster requesting an investigation of the LaRouche movement due to their &quot;increasingly obnoxious&quot; harassment of him, which was raised at a meeting that day of the President&#x27;s Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board by senior member David Abshire. Revell replied to Kissinger that there was sufficient evidence to proceed with an investigation. The FBI conducted an investigation but did not find evidence of a violation of Kissinger&#x27;s civil rights. The investigation was closed in late 1983.

=== Mid-1980s ===
In the mid-1980s, the U.S. government and eleven states began investigations into alleged financial improprieties by LaRouche groups. A federal grand jury reportedly began investigating &quot;an extensive nationwide pattern of credit card fraud&quot; by LaRouche organizations in November 1984. That same year a New Jersey bank froze the accounts of LaRouche&#x27;s 1984 presidential campaign due to allegedly fraudulent credit card charges.

In January 1985, a grand jury in Boston subpoenaed documents from the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC) and three other LaRouche organizations: Caucus Distributors Inc., Fusion Energy Foundation, and Campaigner Publications Inc. Seven weeks later, on March 29, 1985, a federal district court judge, A. David Mazzone, held them to be in contempt and fined them $45,000 per day. The fines for all the organizations eventually totaled over $20 million. The same grand jury subpoenaed Elliot I. Greenspan, an official of Caucus Distributors Inc., to appear but he pleaded the Fifth Amendment and refused to testify. He was granted immunity and compelled to testify but only did so after being jailed for contempt for two days. A spokesman for LaRouche called the investigation &quot;a political terror operation&quot;.

Investigations by a separate federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia, along with state agencies in New York, California, Minnesota, Illinois and Washington were also underway. The FBI, IRS, FEC and personnel of other federal agencies were conducting separate investigations. The Internal Revenue Service revoked the tax-exempt status of the Fusion Energy Foundation in September 1985, and a year later the State of New York sought to dissolve the corporation, alleging that it used &quot;persistently fraudulent and illegal&quot; means to solicit donations. U.S. Attorney William Weld announced in January 1986, that he would convene a national conference &quot;to coordinate a prosecutive and investigative effort&quot; against LaRouche. The conference was held the following month in Boston. Three states, Alaska, Indiana and Maryland, banned fundraising by Caucus Distributors Inc. in May 1986, due to the sale of unregistered promissory notes. The Illinois Secretary of State began civil proceedings against Caucus Distributors Inc. in June 1986, seeking an injunction to bar deceptive business practices. Minnesota officials banned &quot;Independent Democrats for LaRouche&quot; from fundraising, an order that was affirmed on appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.

LaRouche lawyers filed a series of related civil suits against individuals, agencies and businesses. They sued Weld and former Attorney General William French Smith to try to stop the FBI investigation of the credit card case. They sued the New Jersey bank that had frozen their credit card merchant accounts; and they sued Chemical Bank in a similar suit. Edward Spannaus, a treasurer for LaRouche campaigns, filed complaints with the state bar and the U.S. Justice Department against one of the Assistant U.S. Attorneys in the case.

== Raid and indictments ==

Beginning October 6, 1986, the Leesburg, Virginia, headquarters of the LaRouche organization was searched in a coordinated, two-day raid by hundreds of officers of the FBI, IRS, other federal agencies, and Virginia state authorities, supported by armored cars and a helicopter. The agents also surrounded LaRouche&#x27;s heavily guarded estate for the duration of the search but did not enter it. While surrounded, LaRouche sent a telegram to President Ronald Reagan saying that an attempt to arrest him &quot;would be an attempt to kill me. I will not submit passively to such an arrest, but ... I will defend myself&quot;. He later assured that he would comply peaceably with any warrant. LaRouche offices in Quincy, Massachusetts, were searched as well. US Attorney Henry E. Hudson held a press conference to say that the searches had recovered subpoenaed materials, including notebooks and index cards.

Warren J. Hamerman, Chair of the NDPC, said the searches &quot;conducted by Donald Regan&#x27;s associate William Weld&#x27;s forces against presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche&#x27;s headquarters coincides with Don Regan&#x27;s desperate attempts to maintain the cover-up on AIDS&quot;. LaRouche later said that the Soviet Premier had ordered the raid as part of an assassination attempt. &quot;The man with the mark of the beast on his head, Mikhail Gorbachov, has demanded my elimination&quot;, said LaRouche. In his 1987 autobiography, he wrote that the raid was ordered by Raisa Gorbachev, whom he described as outranking her husband in the nomenklatura due to her leadership of the Soviet Cultural Fund.

On the same day as the Leesburg search, the Boston grand jury handed down a 117-count indictment that named ten LaRouche associates, two corporations, and three campaign committees. Authorities charged them with making unauthorized credit charges that defrauded $1 million from over 1,000 people. The charges also included a scheme to raise funds by soliciting loans with no intention of repaying them. The National Caucus of Labor Committees was charged, along with others, of conspiring to obstruct justice. Prosecutors charged that defendants had burned records, sent potential grand jury witnesses out of the country, and failed to provide subpoenaed evidence. The indictment quoted LaRouche telling an associate that, in reaction to legal problems, &quot;we are going to stall, tie them up in the courts ... just keep stalling, stall and appeal, stall and appeal&quot;. Three of the indicted associates remained at large for over a year, and investigators were allegedly given false information. On June 30, 1987, the U.S. grand jury in Boston indicted LaRouche on one count of conspiracy to obstruct justice.

Meanwhile, the state cases were progressing. On February 16, 1987, the Commonwealth of Virginia indicted 16 LaRouche associates on securities fraud and other felonies. On March 3, 1987, the State of New York indicted 15 LaRouche associates on charges of grand larceny and securities fraud.

== Involuntary bankruptcy ==

In early April 1987, the government charged in court that LaRouche organizations may have been trying to sell properties for cash to more easily conceal their assets and avoid paying $21.4 million in contempt of court fines. The U.S. Department of Justice filed an involuntary bankruptcy petition on April 20, 1987, to collect the debt from Caucus Distributors Inc., Fusion Energy Foundation, and Campaigner Publications Inc. In a rare procedure, the companies were seized before the bankruptcy came to trial. Assistant U.S. Attorney S. David Schiller wrote in a brief that the debtors had a &quot;pattern of transferring or commingling substantial corporate assets to their members and other insiders for little or no consideration and for non-business purposes&quot;. The trustees later reported they were only able to locate about $86,000 in assets.

The bankruptcy halted the publication of a weekly newspaper, &quot;New Solidarity&quot;, and a bi-monthly science magazine, &quot;Fusion&quot;. At least one publication, &quot;Fusion&quot;, was reborn with a new name but the same editor and material.

The attorneys who represented the LaRouche entities in the bankruptcy trial filed a brief stating that the action was unprecedented and improper, alleging that it deviated from the standard rules of involuntary bankruptcy, and that members of the Alexandria prosecution team from the second criminal trial were involved in the planning and execution of the bankruptcy.

During the bankruptcy trial in September 1989, an FBI agent destroyed evidence (credit card receipts, cancelled checks, and FEC filings) immediately after he had promised the court he would preserve them. On October 25, 1989, Judge Martin V.B. Bostetter dismissed the government&#x27;s involuntary bankruptcy petition, finding that two of the entities involved were nonprofit fund-raisers and therefore not subject to involuntary bankruptcy actions. According to the LaRouche movement, Bostetter said the government&#x27;s actions amounted to bad faith regardless of whether government agents and attorneys had intended this outcome. He found that the government&#x27;s actions and representations in obtaining the bankruptcy had the effect of misleading the court as to the status of the organization, leading to a &quot;constructive fraud on the court&quot;. In 1993, an appeals court decision said that Bostetter had specifically rejected that view, and said that the defendants had &quot;greatly distorted the character of much of the evidence&quot;. Appeals that went all the way up to the U.S. Supreme Court found that the matter of the involuntary bankruptcy would not change the outcome of LaRouche&#x27;s conviction.

The LaRouche organization asserts that it has proof, obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, which shows that the purpose of the bankruptcy was simply to shut down the affected entities rather than to collect fines. The U.S. Attorney said, &quot;Essentially the court holds that we did not abuse the bankruptcy filing, just that we should have filed differently.&quot; He also noted that only a minimal amount of money had been collected.

== Boston trials ==
=== Trial of Frankhouser ===
United States District Judge Robert Keeton presided in Boston. Jury selection was completed in September 1987. Before the trial could begin, Keeton granted a motion to sever the case of Roy Frankhouser, whose case was tried first in front of a different jury.
Frankhouser had been an informant for the ATF and other law enforcement agencies, in addition to being a neo-Nazi and a former Pennsylvania Ku Klux Klan grand dragon. Frankhouser became a security consultant for LaRouche after convincing him that he was actively connected to U.S. intelligence agencies.

In &quot;U.S. v. Frankhauser&quot;, Frankhouser testified that he and LaRouche security employee Forrest Lee Fick had invented a connection to the CIA in order to justify his $700 a week salary. They persuaded a friend to play a former top CIA official (&quot;Mr. Ed&quot;) in meetings with LaRouche associates who, according to LaRouche group lawyers, came to believe that they had a direct line of communication to the White House and Kremlin through Mr. Ed and—as &quot;a national resource in security matters&quot;—were immune from prosecution. When LaRouche found out about the grand jury investigation, he reportedly told Frankhouser to get the CIA to quash it. Frankhouser told LaRouche that the CIA wanted him to destroy evidence and hide witnesses. Frankhouser claimed that on another occasion LaRouche sent him to Boston to check on the grand jury investigation. Instead of going to Boston he went to a Star Trek convention in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and called to warn LaRouche that the FBI had wiretapped his phones. LaRouche was called as a defense witness in Frankhouser&#x27;s trial but he refused to testify, exercising his Fifth Amendment right to avoid self-incrimination.

Frankhouser was found guilty of obstruction of the federal investigation into credit-card fraud. He was sentenced to three years and a $50,000 fine. After his conviction, he was granted immunity against further prosecution and compelled to testify against LaRouche in the Boston trial. Frankhouser appealed his conviction on April 3, 1989, arguing that his case should not have been severed from the main case, that his counsel had inadequate time to prepare, and that he was not provided with allegedly exculpatory evidence. The appeal was rejected in July.

=== Trial of LaRouche, et al. ===
The trial of LaRouche and his six co-defendants, &quot;U.S. v. LaRouche Campaign&quot;, began on December 17, 1987, with the jury that had been picked in September, before the Frankhouser trial. The 12 defense lawyers made 400 pretrial motions.

The prosecution argued that pressure to fill fund raising quotas had led to 2,000 instances of credit card fraud, and that organization members had sought to obstruct the investigation. The defense presented the case that the prosecution was the culmination of a 20-year campaign of harassment by the FBI and CIA, and that the prosecution was acting on the orders of the CIA when they destroyed evidence and hid witnesses.

During the trial, a search of the personal files of Oliver North was ordered by Judge Keeton to look for evidence that North had led an effort to harass and infiltrate the LaRouche movement, causing an additional delay in the trial. The search produced a May 1986 telex from Iran-Contra defendant General Richard Secord to North, discussing the gathering of information against LaRouche. After this memo surfaced, Judge Keeton ordered a search of Vice President George Bush&#x27;s office for documents relating to LaRouche. Another delay came when the trial was halted to give time for the FBI to search their files for exculpatory documents. The trial was delayed again when federal agents seized LaRouche properties as part of the involuntary bankruptcy procedure in 1988.

Originally expected to last from three to six months, the trial stretched out much longer. One local reporter called the Boston trial a &quot;long, complex and costly multidefendant extravaganza&quot;. After several jurors asked to be excused due to the length of the trial, the defense refused to proceed with fewer than 12 jurors, forcing the judge to declare a mistrial on May 4, 1988. According to one of the jurors, all defendants, including LaRouche, would have been found not guilty. He told a reporter &quot;it seemed some of the government&#x27;s people caused the problem&quot;, and that people working on behalf of the government &quot;may have been involved in some of this fraud to discredit the campaign.&quot; At the time of the mistrial, a spokesperson said that the Constitutional Defense Fund, a LaRouche organization, had spent over $2 million on legal and administrative expenses. Defense attorneys said they would appeal if the government sought a new trial.

A retrial in Boston was scheduled for January 3, 1989, but the charges were dismissed after the Alexandria convictions; this was over the objections of the LaRouche lawyers who said they were seeking vindication. The Assistant U.S. Attorney who handled both the Boston and Alexandria cases said after the dismissal, &quot;It was the Boston prosecuting effort which led to the evidence which allowed the indictment and convictions in Alexandria, and I think justice was served by the substantial sentences received.&quot;

Throughout the trial, three of the indicted individuals were fugitives: Michael Gelber, Charles Park, and Richard Sanders. According to Roy Frankhouser, they had been sent to Europe. They surrendered to the court in 1990 and were sentenced by Judge Keeton to one year each for obstructing the investigation.

=== Related appeals ===
On July 3, 1986, the First Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the contempt of court fines from the Boston grand jury. That decision was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which let it stand. The First Circuit Court heard an appeal on September 11, 1987, alleging abuse of the grand jury and denied it six days later. On November 3, 1987, six organizations affiliated with LaRouche argued that their documents were seized improperly during the October 1986 search. The court denied the appeal the following January. Jeffrey Steinberg said on December 11, 1987, that 100 notebooks compiled by himself and his wife should not have been included in the grand jury subpoena or the search. He lost that appeal the following January. The court heard an appeal from NBC on January 5, 1988, over a lower court subpoena of NBC outtakes of a videotaped interview with a witness, Forrest Lee Fick. The lower court ruled the subpoenaed outtakes were to be placed under seal and subject to in camera review only, giving the court discretion whether to release any portion to the defendants. LaRouche had asserted the outtakes could be used to impeach Fick&#x27;s testimony. The court affirmed the lower court&#x27;s ruling in March.

Following the mistrial in Boston, the prosecution moved to schedule a new trial. LaRouche and the other defendants appealed that effort on October 5, 1988, saying that a new trial would create double jeopardy. The appeal was denied four months later. The contempt of court fines were appealed again on January 9, 1989, and affirmed again on March 29. Following the convictions in the Alexandria court, prosecutors moved to dismiss the charges from the Boston court, canceling the retrial. The LaRouche lawyers appealed that decision on March 13, 1989, arguing that they needed the trial to exonerate LaRouche.

== Alexandria trial ==
Judge Albert V. Bryan Jr. presided over &quot;U.S. v. LaRouche&quot; in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, where LaRouche resided. That court was known as a &quot;rocket docket&quot; for its speed in disposing of cases. LaRouche and six associates were indicted on October 14, 1988, on charges of mail fraud and conspiracy to commit mail fraud. Trial was scheduled for six weeks after the indictment. Defense lawyers made an unusual appeal asking for a delay, which was rejected.

Judge Bryan granted a prosecution motion &quot;in limine&quot;, ruling that the defense would not be permitted to discuss, or even allude to, the fact that the indebted entities had been placed in involuntary bankruptcy. It also excluded claims of vindictive prosecution and political harassment by the government. Bryan wrote, &quot;the court will not allow a delving into any details of alleged infiltration ... for the reason that ... this would divert the jury from the issues raised in the indictment.&quot;

The prosecution, led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kent Robinson, presented evidence that LaRouche and his staff solicited US$34 million in loans since 1983 with false assurances to potential lenders and showed &quot;reckless disregard for the truth&quot;. In his opening statement to the trial, Robinson said, &quot;Members of the jury, this case is about money. It&#x27;s about how the defendants got money, and to a lesser extent, what they did with that money when they got it ... The defendants, all seven of them, are charged in engaging in a scheme to defraud. That is, to obtain those loans by making false promises, false pretences, saying things to potential lenders which they knew weren&#x27;t true.&quot;

The most important evidence was the testimony of lenders, many of them elderly retirees, who had loaned a total of $661,300 to help LaRouche fight the &quot;war on drugs&quot; but only received $10,000 in repayment. One of the prosecutors, John Markham, said those loans represented &quot;just a very small portion of unrepaid borrowing&quot;. Other testimony asserted that, as of 1987, half of the $4 million borrowed by the 1984 presidential campaign was unpaid, and that only $5 million had been repaid out of $30 million in non-campaign loans. LaRouche supporters claim the unrepaid amount was $294,000 but, according to testimony at trial, the amount owed by 1987 topped $25 million.

Several witnesses were LaRouche followers who testified under immunity from prosecution. A former fundraiser testified that he was told, &quot;No matter what the person you are talking to says, get the money. [...] If you are talking to an unemployed worker who says he has got to feed ... a dozen children, forget it. Get the money. Most of these people are immoral anyway. This is the most moral thing they have ever done is to give you money.&quot;

None of the defendants testified. Outside of court, LaRouche denied all the charges, calling them &quot;an all-out frame-up by a state and federal task force,&quot; and said that the federal government was trying to kill him. &quot;The purpose of this frame-up is not to send me to prison. It&#x27;s to kill me,&quot; LaRouche said. &quot;In prison it&#x27;s fairly easy to kill me ... If this sentence goes through, I&#x27;m dead.&quot;

=== Income tax ===
One of the charges against LaRouche was that he had conspired to avoid paying income tax, not having filed a return in ten years. LaRouche claimed to have had no income. LaRouche lived on a 172-acre (700,000 m2) estate near Leesburg, Virginia, with a pond and horse ring. It was purchased for his use by Oklahoma oilman David Nick Anderson for $1.3 million, with LaRouche organizations paying rent to cover the $9,605 mortgage. LaRouche had named the property, otherwise known as Ellwood, &quot;Ibykus Farm&quot; after a work by Friedrich Schiller. His wife, Helga LaRouche, is reported to have overseen hundreds of thousands of dollars in renovations to the property. In all, the LaRouche group spent over US$4 million on Virginia real estate during this period, according to trial testimony. The LaRouche defense argued that Ibykus Farm was a &quot;safehouse&quot; needed for the security of LaRouche and others. The government argued that security expenditures were &quot;misplaced priorities.&quot;

In 1985, a judge in a separate case had described LaRouche&#x27;s testimony about being almost penniless as &quot;completely lacking in credibility&quot;. In 1986, in the same case, LaRouche said that he did not know who had paid the rent on the estate, or for his food, lodging, clothing, transportation, bodyguards, or lawyers since 1973. The judge fined him for failing to answer.

=== Conviction and imprisonment ===
On December 16, 1988, LaRouche was convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud involving more than $30 million in defaulted loans; 11 counts of actual mail fraud involving $294,000 in defaulted loans; and one count of conspiring to defraud the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The judge said that the claim of a vendetta was &quot;arrant nonsense&quot;, and that, &quot;the idea that this organization is a sufficient threat to anything that would warrant the government bringing a prosecution to silence them just defies human experience.&quot;
Jury foreman Buster Horton told &quot;The Washington Post&quot; that it was the failure of LaRouche aides to repay loans which swayed the jury in the Virginia case. He said that the jury &quot;all agreed [LaRouche] was not on trial for his political beliefs. We did not convict him for that. He was convicted for those 13 counts he was on trial for.&quot;

As part of the trial in Alexandria, six of LaRouche&#x27;s associates were also found guilty. His chief fund-raiser, William Wertz, was convicted on ten mail fraud counts. LaRouche&#x27;s legal adviser and treasurer, Edward Spannaus, along with fund raising operatives Dennis Small, Paul Greenberg, Michael Billington, and Joyce Rubinstein, were convicted of conspiracy to commit mail fraud. Wertz and Spannaus were sentenced to five years imprisonment each, with Spannaus serving a total of two and a half years until his release from custody. Both were fined $1,000. The others received three-year terms and various fines.

While in prison LaRouche released claims that he was tortured as part of an assassination attempt. LaRouche ran two political campaigns from prison: for Virginia&#x27;s 10th Congressional District in 1990 and for U.S. President in 1992. One of his cellmates during his incarceration at the Federal Medical Center, Rochester in Minnesota was televangelist Jim Bakker. Bakker later devoted a chapter of his book, &quot;I Was Wrong&quot;, to his experience with LaRouche. Bakker described his astonishment at LaRouche&#x27;s detailed knowledge of the Bible. According to Bakker, LaRouche received a daily briefing each morning by phone, often in German, and on more than one occasion LaRouche had information days before it was reported on the network news. Bakker also wrote that his cellmate was convinced that their cell was bugged. In Bakker&#x27;s view, &quot;to say LaRouche was a little paranoid would be like saying that the Titanic had a little leak.&quot; LaRouche also befriended Richard Miller, a former FBI agent and fellow inmate who was imprisoned on espionage charges. LaRouche was paroled in 1994 after serving five years of the 15-year sentence, the normal schedule for parole at that time. LaRouche commented later that &quot;... in effect, George H. W. Bush put me in the jug, and Bill Clinton got me out&quot;.

=== Appeal of convictions ===

The defendants in the Alexandria trial appealed their convictions to Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on October 6, 1989. Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark joined the defense team, which contended that there were six faults in the trial. In the words of the Circuit Court&#x27;s opinion, the alleged errors were:
# The district court erred in denying their motion for a continuance of the trial date.
# The district court erroneously denied their discovery request for exculpatory material.
# The district court made numerous evidentiary rulings, &quot;in limine&quot; and at trial, that unconstitutionally restricted their ability to defend against the charges.
# The trial judge failed to conduct a &quot;voir dire&quot; sufficient to impanel an unbiased jury and improperly failed to excuse several jurors for cause.
# The mail fraud counts were improperly joined with the tax conspiracy count.
# The sentence imposed on LaRouche was excessive.
# The district court erroneously instructed the jury on the tax count.
# The district court erred in allowing the introduction of illegally seized evidence.
Seventeen &quot;amicus curiae&quot; (&quot;friend of the court&quot;) briefs were filed in the appeal. One, by Albert Bleckmann, director of the Institute for Public Law and Political Sciences at the University of Münster, objected to the lack of &quot;voir dire&quot;, the exclusion of evidence under the motion &quot;in limine&quot;, the fact that the government did not approach LaRouche about his tax situation before indicting him for tax violations, and concerns about double jeopardy because of the nearly identical charges in the Boston and Alexandria trials. A brief by a French lawyer said that, &quot;a crime of thought seems to have been camouflaged as a common law crime.&quot; Notable submitters of amicus briefs included: James Robert Mann, Charles E. Rice, Jay Alan Sekulow and George P. Monaghan.

The three-judge panel reviewed and rejected each item, affirming the defendants&#x27; convictions and sentences unanimously on January 22, 1990. Five months later the U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the case.

== State trials ==

The Attorney General of Virginia, Mary Sue Terry, prosecuted eight LaRouche organizations on charges of securities fraud relating to $30 million in loans. The first trials were in Leesburg, but later trials moved to the larger city of Roanoke. In order for the prosecutions to proceed, a decision by the State Corporation Commission (SCC) was needed verifying that the loans solicited by LaRouche organizations were securities. Attorneys for the LaRouche organizations argued that a prohibition on raising funds through loans would violate their First Amendment rights. The SCC rejected that argument and decided, on March 4, 1987, that the promissory notes were securities. It ordered six LaRouche organizations—Fusion Energy Foundation Inc., Caucus Distributors Inc., Publication and General Management Inc., Campaigner Publications Inc., EIR News Service Inc. and Publication Equities Inc.—to stop their sale. Five other states had already issued injunctions, and 14 states eventually followed. At least one injunction, by the State of Minnesota against Independent Democrats for LaRouche, was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which confirmed the lower court ruling.

Six of LaRouche&#x27;s associates were convicted and two pleaded guilty. Rochelle Ascher, a fundraiser, was sentenced in Leesburg to 86 years (reduced to 10 years) for six charges of fraudulently selling securities and one count each of selling an unregistered security with intent to defraud, selling a security by an unregistered agent with intent to defraud, and conspiracy to commit security fraud. In two Roanoke trials, four other associates were found guilty of securities fraud charges: Donald Phau, Lawrence Hecht, Paul Gallagher and Anita Gallagher. Richard Welsh and Martha M. Quinde pleaded guilty and received 12 month and one month terms, respectively.

Michael Billington was charged in a Roanoke court with having knowingly solicited 131 loans that would never be repaid from 85 people, totaling $1.24 million. Represented by a court-appointed lawyer, he rejected a plea bargain that would have limited his prison sentence to the three years he had already served in the federal case. The lawyer, Brian Gettings, doubted Billington&#x27;s competence and told the court that he believed LaRouche was making the decisions in the case rather than his client. The court ordered two psychiatric tests. The first physician deemed him competent. Billington refused to cooperate with a second examination that was to be conducted by an expert on cults. Billington sought to fire Gettings, who had already tried to quit over competency question, but the judge refused to permit Billington to substitute a different attorney. A LaRouche spokesman said that Billington was prepared for trial. Billington was convicted on nine counts of &quot;conspiracy to fail to register as a securities broker&quot;. Under Virginia&#x27;s court system, the jury determines prison terms although a judge may override the jury&#x27;s recommendation. The jury in this case recommended 77 years (out of a possible 90); the judge refused to lower it because Billington continued to insist upon his innocence (which the judge deemed lack of remorse) and because he had warned that he would accept the jury recommendation if Billington requested a jury trial. Billington served a total of ten years in prison before being released on parole. The lead prosecutor said the case involved &quot;willful and massive fraud that has caused a lot of people to suffer&quot;.

A trial in New York state courts on charges of scheming to defraud resulted in the conviction of Robert Primack, Marielle Kronberg and Lynne Speed.

&quot;My imprisonment is the American Dreyfus case&quot;, LaRouche said in a January 1989 interview from prison. The prosecutor denied claims of a conspiracy, describing the theory as an &quot;Orwellian fantasy ... that we are hiding some supersecret spy plot which, if exposed, would exonerate them&quot;. LaRouche supporters insisted that LaRouche was jailed, not for any violation of the law, but for his beliefs.

LaRouche also alleged systematic government misconduct:
The record shows, that for nearly thirty years, elements of the U.S. Department of Justice have been engaged in world-wide political targeting of me and my associates. This includes early 1970s operations run in conjunction with Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger&#x27;s U.S. State Department. During the last ten years or so of that period, some U.S. officials, and others, have challenged the relevant agencies with some of the evidence which shows, that those prosecutions and correlated harassment of me and my associates, had been clearly fraudulent, politically motivated targeting.

LaRouche and his lawyers asserted that the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) sought to destroy his organization, and that the prosecution was the result of a conspiracy between the ADL, the government and the media. This claim stemmed from a series of meetings that LaRouche publications refer to as the John Train &quot;Salon&quot;. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported, in its obituary for Train, that &quot;he convened meetings at his home for journalists, law enforcement agents and others in government to raise awareness about research he had done into Mr. LaRouche.&quot;

Friedrich August Freiherr von der Heydte, a professor of constitutional and international law at the University of Mainz in Germany, compared the LaRouche trial to the Dreyfus affair, which he called &quot;a classical example of a political trial&quot;. He wrote, &quot;Just as LaRouche was, the French Capt. Alfred Dreyfus was deprived by the structure of the trial procedures, of any opportunity to prove his innocence, and facts critical for his defense were excluded from the trial.&quot;

On November 8, 1991, Angelo Vidal d&#x27;Almeida Ribeiro, the Special Rapporteur for the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, filed a request to the U.S. Government based on a complaint that had been filed concerning the LaRouche case. The U.S. government responded by saying that LaRouche had been given due process under the laws of the United States. The U.N. Commission took no further action.

In testimony submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee on July 13, 1998, the LaRouche-affiliated Schiller Institute claimed that &quot;[t]he inability to repay lenders and other crediters [sic] was the consequence of an unprecedented involuntary bankruptcy proceeding initiated by the Justice Department against those companies in 1987, initiated in an &quot;ex parte&quot;, &quot;in camera&quot; proceeding&quot;.

In 2000, Adrian Bennett, a former Australian member of parliament and founder of the LaRouchite Curtin Labor Alliance, stated that LaRouche had been framed by the &quot;global oligarchy&quot;, and said the convictions represented &quot;a badge of honor, a testament to the unshakable courage and commitment of LaRouche and his associates&quot;.

== Exoneration attempts ==
Ramsey Clark wrote a letter in 1995 to then-Attorney General Janet Reno in which he said that the case involved &quot;a broader range of deliberate and systematic misconduct and abuse of power over a longer period of time in an effort to destroy a political movement and leader, than any other federal prosecution in my time or to my knowledge&quot;. He asserted that, &quot;The government, ex parte, sought and received an order effectively closing the doors of these publishing businesses, all of which were involved in First Amendment activities, effectively preventing the further repayment of their debts.&quot; He called the convictions &quot;a tragic miscarriage of justice which at this time can only be corrected by an objective review and courageous action by the Department of Justice&quot;. The LaRouche movement organized two panels to review the cases: the Curtis Clark Commission, and the Mann-Chestnut hearings.

On September 18, 1996, a full-page advertisement appeared in the &quot;New Federalist&quot;, a LaRouche publication, as well as &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and &quot;Roll Call&quot;. Entitled &quot;Officials Call for LaRouche&#x27;s Exoneration&quot;, its signatories included Arturo Frondizi, former President of Argentina; figures from the 1960s American Civil Rights Movement such as Amelia Boynton Robinson (a leader of the Larouche-affiliated Schiller Institute), James Bevel (a Larouche movement participant) and Rosa Parks; former Minnesota Senator and Democratic Presidential Candidate Eugene McCarthy; Mervyn M. Dymally, who chaired the Congressional Black Caucus; and artists such as classical vocalist William Warfield and violinist Norbert Brainin, former 1st Violin of the Amadeus Quartet.

== Later developments ==
In 2009, Molly Kronberg, widow of Kenneth Kronberg, sued LaRouche in federal court for the Eastern District of Virginia, in Alexandria, alleging that he and his associates libelled and harassed her on account of her compelled testimony in the 1988 case which led to his conviction. LaRouche alleges that Kronberg perjured herself and colluded with the prosecutors to frame him in order to cover up a bad check issued in 1979 by her from a New Benjamin Franklin House Publishing Company account for royalties owed him. One of the prosecutors in the 1988 case, John Markham, is representing Kronberg in the suit.

<text>Let&#x27;s Talk About Love is the fifteenth studio album and fifth English-language album by Canadian singer Celine Dion, released on 14 November 1997 by Sony Music. The follow-up to the commercially successful &quot;Falling into You&quot; (1996), &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; showed a further progression of Dion&#x27;s music. Throughout the project, she collaborated with Barbra Streisand, the Bee Gees, Luciano Pavarotti, Carole King, George Martin, Diana King, Brownstone, Corey Hart, and her previous producers: David Foster, Ric Wake, Walter Afanasieff, Humberto Gatica, and Jim Steinman. The album includes Dion&#x27;s biggest hit, &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. Written by James Horner and Will Jennings and serving as the love theme for James Cameron&#x27;s 1997 blockbuster film, &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; topped the charts around the world and is considered to be Dion&#x27;s signature song. 
&quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; and its songs won many awards around the world. &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television. In addition, the album was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album and &quot;Tell Him&quot; for Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals.

&quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; became one of the best-selling albums in history, with sales of over 31 million copies worldwide. The album also topped the record charts around the world, including the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, France, Australia and many more. It became one of the best-selling albums of 1997 and 1998 in various countries, and also one of the top-selling albums of the decade. It was certified Diamond, Multi-Platinum, Platinum and Gold around the world. Various singles were released, depending on the country. In addition to the major success of &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, other singles included &quot;Tell Him&quot;, &quot;Be the Man&quot;, &quot;The Reason&quot;, &quot;To Love You More&quot;, &quot;Immortality&quot;, &quot;Miles to Go (Before I Sleep)&quot; and &quot;Treat Her Like a Lady&quot;.

==Conception and composition==
The follow-up to her successful album &quot;Falling into You&quot; (1996), &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; was recorded in London, New York, and Los Angeles, and featured a host of special guests: Barbra Streisand on &quot;Tell Him&quot;, Bee Gees on &quot;Immortality&quot;, Italian operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti on &quot;I Hate You Then I Love You&quot;, and Jamaican reggae singer Diana King and American R&amp;B group Brownstone on &quot;Treat Her Like a Lady&quot;. &quot;The Reason&quot; was co-written by Carole King and produced by George Martin, who produced nearly all of The Beatles&#x27; recordings. The most successful single from the album became the classically influenced ballad &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, which was written by James Horner and Will Jennings. Serving as the love theme for the 1997 blockbuster film &quot;Titanic&quot;, &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; topped the charts around the world, and has become Dion&#x27;s signature song.

Tracks on &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; were produced mainly by David Foster, Ric Wake, Walter Afanasieff, Humberto Gatica and Corey Hart. &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; includes cover songs such as Leo Sayer&#x27;s &quot;When I Need You&quot; and Mina&#x27;s &quot;Grande grande grande&quot; (recorded as an English-language duet titled &quot;I Hate You Then I Love You&quot;). Sony Music Entertainment issued few different editions of &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; around the world. Aside from the main thirteen tracks, &quot;To Love You More&quot; was included on the US and Latin America editions, &quot;Be the Man&quot; on the European, Australian and Asian editions, &quot;Amar Haciendo el Amor&quot; outside the US and &quot;Where Is the Love&quot; outside Latin America.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; divided music critics. &quot;Billboard&quot; editor Paul Verna gave it a positive review. He wrote that Dion&#x27;s &quot;super-charged vocals are expectedly potent and often reach for heavens&quot; and praised the restrained Bee Gees&#x27; collaboration &quot;Immortality&quot;, top forty border-breaking &quot;To Love You More&quot;, Carole King/George Martin effort &quot;The Reason&quot;, explosive &quot;Us&quot; and the &quot;Titanic&quot; single &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. He also noted that Dion spreads her wings on tracks like the reggae-splashed &quot;Treat Her Like a Lady&quot; featuring Diana King and Brownstone, and &quot;I Hate You Then I Love You&quot;, a curious duet with Luciano Pavarotti. Larry Flick, also from &quot;Billboard&quot;, spoke positively about &quot;Tell Him&quot; and &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;. He called &quot;Tell Him&quot; an event and wrote that two of pop music&#x27;s best voices are united on a &quot;grand, wonderfully over-the-top ballad that will melt the heart of even the most jaded listener&quot;. He also called it an electrifying &quot;girlfriend&quot; anthem. Flick wrote that &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; &quot;woos with romantic lyrics and a melancholy melody that is fleshed out with a weeping flute solo.&quot; He noted that Dion &quot;hit notes that shatter glass&quot; but that she also &quot;has the ability to pack volumes of emotion in a whisper.&quot; Flick argued that &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; &quot;will add a much-needed touch of class to every station it graces.&quot;

Senior editor of AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; four stars out of five. He noted that &quot;Falling into You&quot; established Dion as a superstar in America, so its sequel, &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot;, was designed to consolidate her position as a newly minted star. The album was constructed as a blockbuster, featuring Dion&#x27;s trademark melodramatic ballads, some carefully tailored dance-pop, a bevy of duets with the likes of Barbra Streisand and the Bee Gees, and production and songs from adult contemporary gurus David Foster, Jim Steinman, and Walter Afanasieff. According to Erlewine, given that so many talented craftsmen worked on &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot;, it makes sense that a number of the cuts succeed according to adult contemporary terms—they are predictably sweeping showcases for Dion&#x27;s soaring, technically skilled voice. As usual, the singles (including the Streisand duet &quot;Tell Him&quot; and the &quot;Titanic&quot; love theme &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;) shine the most brilliantly, but even the filler is immaculately produced. Erlewine ended his review saying that if the result doesn&#x27;t quite gel as an album, that shouldn&#x27;t be surprising—this is music by committee, a product that was made to appeal to the widest possible audience. Such a calculated execution guarantees that anyone who liked one of the singles shouldn&#x27;t be disappointed by &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot;, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they will remember all of the record after it has finished playing.

David Browne from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave the album a grade of C. He wrote that aiming for the widest possible audience, &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; is top-heavy with renowned duet partners (Barbra Streisand, the Bee Gees, Luciano Pavarotti), proven middle-of-the-road producers (Walter Afanasieff, David Foster, Jim Steinman), and an obligatory remake (a precisely enunciated version of Leo Sayer&#x27;s &quot;When I Need You&quot;). According to him, most of the album is composed of the heavy-hearted ballads that have made Dion a star, but for added crossover appeal, it also includes a beat-by-numbers dance track (&quot;Just a Little Bit of Love&quot;) and an overarranged stab at reggae dancehall (the unintentionally amusing &quot;Treat Her Like a Lady&quot;). And to cement the music-film bond, it even features a movie theme (for the similarly epic &quot;Titanic&quot;). Browne noted that just as recent big-budget summer movies have piled on special effects at the expense of plausible story lines, &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; forgets that a pop album, no matter the budget, needs solid songs. He felt that most of the songs here, from the Gibb brothers&#x27; banal &quot;Immortality&quot; (written for the forthcoming London stage production of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;) to the air balloon &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; (love theme from &quot;Titanic&quot;), are flimsy concoctions that droop under the weight of their arrangements. He added that Streisand glides like butter into the duet &quot;Tell Him&quot; — making Dion sound like margarine in the process — but the song is an Uberschlock ode to subservience. Browne finished the review saying that Dion gives it her all, sounding hurt or empowered as each number demands, but her voice has so little personality that it too is lost amid the ornateness. Elysa Gardner of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; gave the album two out of four stars saying that Dion&#x27;s voice is a technical marvel, but her delivery lacks the personality and intuitive sense of drama that are a diva&#x27;s stock in trade. A negative review came from Jonathan Bernstein of &quot;The New York Observer&quot;. He panned the album with the exception of &quot;When I Need You&quot;, &quot;Just a Little Bit of Love&quot; and &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;.

<text>The Russian Mennonites ( [lit. &quot;Russia Mennonites&quot;, i.e., Mennonites of or from the Russian Empire]) are a group of Mennonites who are the descendants of Dutch and North German Anabaptists who settled in the Vistula delta in West Prussia for about 250 years and established colonies in the Russian Empire (present-day Ukraine and Russia&#x27;s Volga region, Orenburg Governorate, and Western Siberia) beginning in 1789. Since the late 19th century, many of them have emigrated to countries which are located throughout the Western Hemisphere. The rest of them were forcibly relocated, so very few of their descendants currently live in the locations of the original colonies. Russian Mennonites are traditionally multilingual but Plautdietsch (Mennonite Low German) is their first language as well as their lingua franca. In 2014, there were several hundred thousand Russian Mennonites: about 200,000 live in Germany, 74,122 live in Mexico, 150,000 in Bolivia, 40,000 live in Paraguay, 10,000 live in Belize, tens of thousands of them live in Canada and the US, and a few thousand live in Argentina, Uruguay, and Brazil.

The term &quot;Russian Mennonite&quot; refers to the country which they resided in before their immigration to the Americas rather than their ethnic heritage. The term &quot;Low-German Mennonites&quot; is also used in order to avoid this conflation.

==History==
=== Origins in the Vistula Delta ===
In the early-to-mid 16th century, Mennonites began to flee to the Vistula Delta region in the Kingdom of Poland in order to avoid persecution in the Low Countries—especially Friesland and Flanders—seeking religious freedom and exemption from military service. They gradually replaced their Dutch and Frisian languages with the Low German language spoken in the area, blending into it elements of their native tongues to create a distinct dialect known as Plautdietsch. Today Plautdietsch is the distinct Mennonite language that developed over a period of 300 years in the Vistula delta region and south Russia. The Mennonites of Dutch origin were joined by Mennonites from other parts of Europe, including the German-speaking parts of the Swiss Confederacy.

In 1772, most of the Vistula delta was annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia in the First Partition of Poland. Frederick William II of Prussia ascended the throne in 1786 and imposed heavy fees on the Mennonites in exchange for continued military exemption. The remainder of the Vistula delta was annexed by Prussia in the Second Partition of Poland in 1793.

=== Migration to Russia ===

Catherine the Great of Russia issued a manifesto in 1763 inviting all Europeans to come and settle various pieces of land within New Russia (today Southern Ukraine) and especially in the Volga region. Mennonites from the Vistula delta region sent delegates to negotiate an extension of this manifesto and, in 1789, Crown Prince Paul signed a new agreement with them. The Mennonite migration to Russia from the Prussian-annexed Vistula delta was led by Jacob Hoeppner and Johann Bartsch. Their settlement territory was northwest of the Sea of Azov, and had just been acquired from the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War, 1768–1774. Many of the Mennonites in Prussia accepted this invitation, establishing Chortitza on the Dnieper River as their first colony in 1789. A second larger colony, Molotschna, was founded in 1804.

Mennonites lived alongside Nogais—semi-nomadic pastoralists—in the Molotschna region of southern Ukraine starting from 1803, when Mennonites first arrived, until 1860, when the Nogai Tatars departed. Mennonites provided agricultural jobs to Nogais and rented pasture from them. Nogai raids on Mennonite herds were a constant problem in the first two decades of settlement.

Two Mennonite settlements on the Vistula near Warsaw, Kazuń Nowy and Nowe Wymyśle, came under Russian control after Mazovia was annexed by Russia at the Congress of Vienna (1815). Some of these families emigrated to the Molotschna settlement after it was established. Deutsch-Michalin near Machnovka was founded in 1787. Many families from this settlement moved to nearby Volhynia in 1802. Swiss Mennonites of Amish descent from Galicia settled near Dubno, Volhynia province in 1815. Other Galician Mennonites lived near Lviv.

When the Prussian government eliminated exemption from military service on religious grounds, most of the remaining Mennonites were eager to emigrate to Russia. They were offered land along the Volga River in Samara Governorate and exemption from military service for twenty years, after which they could pay a special exemption tax. Two settlements, Trakt and Alt-Samara (to distinguish it from Neu Samara Colony), were founded in 1853 and 1861 respectively.

By 1870 about 9000 individuals had immigrated to Russia, mostly to the Chortitza and Molotschna settlements which, with population increase, numbered about 45,000. Forty daughter colonies were established by 1914, occupying nearly , with a total population of 100,000.

==== Life in Russia ====
===== Economy =====
The colonists formed villages of fifteen to thirty families, each with 70 ha (175 acres) of land. The settlements retained some communal land and a common granary for use by the poor in lean years. Income from communal property provided funding for large projects, such as forming daughter colonies for the growing population. Insurance was also organized separately and outside of the control of the Russian government.

Initially the settlers raised cattle, sheep and general crops to provide for their household. The barren steppes were much drier than their Vistula delta homeland and it took years to work out the proper dry-land farming practices. They grew mulberries for the silk industry, produced honey, flax and tobacco, and marketed fruits and vegetables for city markets. By the 1830s wheat became the dominant crop.

Expanding population and the associated pressure for more farmland became a problem by 1860. The terms of the settlement agreement prevented farms from being divided; they were required to pass intact from one generation to the next. Since agriculture was the main economic activity, an expanding class of discontented, landless poor arose. Their problems tended to be ignored by the village assembly, which consisted of voting landowners. By the early 1860s the problem became so acute that the landless organized a party that petitioned the Russian government for relief. A combination of factors relieved their plight. The Russian government permitted farms to be divided in half or quarters and ordered release of the village&#x27;s communal land. The colonies themselves purchased land and formed daughter colonies on the eastern frontier extending into Siberia and Turkestan. These new colonies included Bergtal, Neu Samara Colony and the Mennonite settlements of Altai.

As wheat farming expanded, the demand for mills and farm equipment grew. The first large foundry was established in Chortitza in 1860 and other firms followed. By 1911 the eight largest Mennonite-owned factories produced 6% of the total Russian output (over 3 million rubles), shipped machinery to all parts of the empire and employed 1744 workers. The annual output of &quot;Lepp and Wallman&quot; of Schönwiese was 50,000 mowers, 3000 threshing machines, thousands of gangplows in addition to other farm equipment. Flour and feed mills were originally wind-powered, a skill transplanted from Prussia. These were eventually replaced with motor- and steam-driven mills. Milling and its supporting industries grew to dominate the industrial economy of the colonies and nearby communities.

===== Local government =====
Mennonite colonies were self-governing with little intervention from the Russian authorities. The village, the basic unit of government, was headed by an elected magistrate who oversaw village affairs. Each village controlled its own school and roads, and cared for the poor. Male landowners decided local matters at village assemblies.

Villages were grouped into districts. All of the Chortitza villages formed one district; Molotschna was divided into two districts: Halbstadt and Gnadenfeld. A district superintendent headed a regional bureau that could administer corporal punishment and handle other matters affecting the villages in common. Insurance and fire protection were handled at the regional level, as well as dealing with delinquents and other social problems. The Mennonite colonies functioned as a democratic state, enjoying freedoms beyond those of ordinary Russian peasants.

In addition to village schools, the Mennonite colonies established their own hospitals, a mental hospital and a school for the deaf. They cared for orphans and elderly and provided an insurance program. By being largely self-sufficient in these local matters, they were able to minimize their burden on and contact with the Russian government.

Mennonites stayed out of Russian politics and social movements that preceded the Russian revolution. After the Russian Revolution of 1905 they did exercise their right to vote. Most aligned themselves with the Octobrist Party because of its guarantee of religious freedoms and freedom of the press for minority groups. Hermann Bergmann was an Octobrist member of the Third and Fourth State Dumas; Peter Schröder, a Constitutional Democratic party member from Crimea, was a member of the fourth Duma.

===== Education =====
At a time when compulsory education was unknown in Europe, the Mennonite colonies formed an elementary school in each village. Students learned practical skills such as reading and writing German and arithmetic. Religion was included as was singing in many schools. The teacher was typically a craftsperson or herder, untrained in teaching, who fit class time around his occupation.

In 1820 the Molotschna colony started a secondary school at Ohrloff, bringing a trained teacher from Prussia. The Central School was started in Chortitza in 1842. Over three thousand pupils attended the Central School with up to 8% of the colonists receiving a secondary education. A school of commerce was started in Halbstadt employing a faculty with full graduate education. Those who wanted to pursue post-secondary education attended universities in Switzerland, Germany as well as Russia.

===== Religious life =====
Typically each village or group of villages organized an independent congregation. Cultural and traditional differences between Frisian and Flemish Mennonites were also reflected in those of their churches. They all agreed on fundamental Mennonite beliefs such as believer&#x27;s baptism, nonresistance and avoidance of oaths. Pastors of Flemish congregations read sermons from a book while seated at a table. Frisian pastors stood while delivering the sermon.

Pastors were untrained and chosen from within the congregation. Unpaid pastors were selected from among the wealthier members—large landowners, sometimes teachers—allowing them to make a living while serving the congregation. The combined effect of respect for their position and material wealth gave them substantial influence over the community.

Church discipline was exercised in the form of excommunication against those who had committed sins and refused to repent and ask for forgiveness. The most conservative congregations practiced &quot;avoidance&quot;, which entailed cutting all business and most social ties with an unrepentant member, but members still had the obligation to help the shunned person if he was in grave need. Because being part of a Mennonite congregation was required to enjoy the special benefits the Russian government provided to colonists, excommunication had broader implications. This was softened by the various internal factions, which allowed a person banned from one congregation to join another.

=== First wave of emigration ===
As nationalism grew in central Europe, the Russian government could no longer justify the special status of its German-speaking colonists. In 1870 they announced a Russification plan that would end all special privileges by 1880. Mennonites were particularly alarmed at the possibility of losing their exemption from military service and their right for schools to use the German language, which they believed was necessary to maintain their cultural and religious life.

Delegates were sent to Petersburg in 1871 to meet with the czar and appeal for relief on religious grounds. They met with high officials, but failed to present the czar with their petition. A similar attempt the next year was also unsuccessful, but were assured by the Tsar&#x27;s brother Grand Duke Konstantin that the new law would provide a way to address the concerns of the Mennonites in the form of noncombatant military service.

The most conscientious Mennonites could not accept any form of service that supported making war, prompting their community leaders to seek immigration options. In 1873 a delegation of twelve explored North America, seeking large tracts of fertile farmland. This group consisted of Leonhard Sudermann and Jacob Buller of the Alexanderwohl congregation representing the Molotschna settlement; Tobias Unruh from Volhynia settlements; Andreas Schrag of the Swiss Volhynia congregations; Heinrich Wiebe, Jacob Peters and Cornelius Buhr from the Bergthal Colony; William Ewert from West Prussia; Cornelius Toews and David Klassen of the &quot;Kleine Gemeinde&quot; and Paul and Lorenz Tschetter representing the Hutterites. This group returned with positive reports of good land available in Manitoba, Minnesota, South Dakota, Nebraska and Kansas.

The more conservative groups—those from &quot;Kleine Gemeinde&quot;, Bergthal and Chortitza—chose Canada, which promised privileges equal to those previously held in Russia and a large tract of land to reestablish colonies in Manitoba (East Reserve and West Reserve). The more liberal groups—those from Molotschna—and the Hutterites chose the United States. Entire communities such as Alexanderwohl and Bergtal prepared to move as a unit as well as many individual families from among the other Mennonite villages. They sold their property, often at reduced prices and worked through the red tape and high fees of procuring passports.

Realizing that 40,000 of Russia&#x27;s most industrious farmers were preparing to leave for North America, the Russian government sent Eduard Totleben to the colonies in May 1874. Meeting with community leaders, he exaggerated the difficulties that would be encountered in North America and offered an alternative national service that would not be connected in any way to the military. His intervention convinced the more liberal Mennonites to stay.

Between 1874 and 1880, of the approximately 45,000 Mennonites in South Russia, 10,000 departed for the United States and 8,000 for Manitoba. The settlement of Mennonites, primarily in the central United States, where available cropland had similarity to that in the Crimean Peninsula, coincided with the completion of the Transcontinental Railroad in 1869. Others looked east, and in one of the strangest chapters of Mennonite history, Claas Epp, Jr., Abraham Peters and other leaders led hundreds of Mennonites to Central Asia in the 1880s, where they expected Christ&#x27;s imminent return. They settled in the Talas Valley of Turkestan and in the Khanate of Khiva. For those who remained in Russia, the military service question was resolved by 1880 with a substitute four-year forestry service program for men of military age.

=== World War I ===
During the period of the &#x27;Great War&#x27;, the Mennonites in Russia were well advanced socially and economically. Many large agricultural estates and business entities were controlled by Mennonite interests. They had a reputation for outstanding efficiency and quality and were noted across Russia for their agricultural and organizational abilities. The precedent of non-resistant national service had been established years before and the Mennonites therefore had a system to handle military service requests at the outbreak of war. During World War I, 5000 Mennonite men served in both forestry and hospital units and transported wounded from the battlefield to Moscow and Ekaterinoslav hospitals. The Mennonite congregations were responsible for funding these forms of alternative service, as well as supporting the men&#x27;s families during their absence, a burden of 3.5 million rubles annually. During this time there was a progressive breakdown in the autonomy of the Mennonite colonies and social and financial pressure began to take their effect on the Mennonite people and their institutions. Property and possessions began to be confiscated for the war effort and certain industrial complexes turned to military production (some voluntarily). Much of the Mennonite hope at that time was based on the preservation of the existing Russian Provisional Government. However, as the war progressed, the social tide turned against the existing power structure and Russia began a march toward structural discord.

The chaos that followed the collapse of the Russian Provisional Government was devastating to much of Ukraine, including the Mennonite colonies. The Red and White armies moved through the region, confiscating food and livestock. Nestor Makhno&#x27;s anarchist army generally targeted Mennonites because they were thought of as &quot;Kulaks&quot; and an entity generally more advanced and wealthy than the surrounding Ukrainian peasants. The Mennonites&#x27; Germanic background also served to inflame negative sentiment during the period of revolution. It is also rumored that Makhno himself had served on a Mennonite estate in childhood and harbored negative feelings based on treatment he received while employed there. Hundreds of Mennonites were murdered, robbed, imprisoned and raped during this period, and villages including (and around) Chortitza, Zagradovka and Nikolaipol were damaged and destroyed. Many more people died from typhus, cholera and sexually transmitted diseases, spread by the anarchist army warring throughout the colonies.

Based on the tragedy unfolding around them, some of the avowed pacifist Mennonites turned to self-defense and established militia units (Selbstschutz) to ward off raiding forces with the help of the German Army. This was regarded as a failure of spiritual commitment by many within the community (currently and at the time). The forces initially achieved some military success in defending Mennonite colonies and families while the communities tried to escape and/or relocate. Ultimately the self-defence militia was overwhelmed once Makhno&#x27;s anarchists aligned themselves with the Red Army early in 1919. While the resistance certainly helped defend Mennonite communities against initial attacks, it may also have served to inflame some of the atrocities that followed. After this period, many Mennonites were dispossessed and ultimately their remaining properties and possessions were nationalized (collectivization) by the Soviet authorities.

The impacts of the trauma experienced during World War I and the Russian Revolution had lasting impacts on Russian Mennonites. Even though Mennonites who emigrated to North America experienced drastically less violence and the privilege of land ownership, many still showed very high levels of psychological distress. First through third generation Mennonites in North America were found to have high levels of depression, hysteria, psychasthenia, post traumatic stress disorder, ego strength, anxiety, repression, and over-controlled hostility.

=== Famine ===
Mennonites of Molotschna sent a commission to North America in the summer of 1920 to alert American Mennonites of the dire conditions of war-torn Ukraine. Their plight succeeded in uniting various branches of Mennonites to form the Mennonite Central Committee in an effort to coordinate aid.

The new organization planned to provide aid to Ukraine via existing Mennonite relief work in Istanbul. The Istanbul group, mainly Goshen College graduates, produced three volunteers, who at great risk entered Ukraine during the ongoing Russian Civil War. They arrived in the Mennonite village of Halbstadt in the Molotschna settlement just as General Wrangel of the White Army was retreating. Two of the volunteers withdrew with the Wrangel army, while Clayton Kratz, who remained in Halbstadt as it was overrun by the Red Army, was never heard from again.

A year passed before official permission was received from the Soviet government to do relief work among the villages of Ukraine (see Russian famine of 1921). Kitchens provided 25,000 people a day with rations over a period of three years beginning in 1922, with a peak of 40,000 servings during August of that year. Fifty Fordson tractor and plow combinations were sent to Mennonite villages to replace horses that had been stolen and confiscated during the war. The cost of this relief effort was $1.2 million.

=== Second wave of emigration ===
As conditions improved, Mennonites turned their attention from survival to emigration. Though the New Economic Policy appeared to be less radical than previous Soviet reforms, thousands of Mennonites saw no future under the communists. After years of negotiation with foreign governments and Moscow, arrangements were made for emigration to Canada, Paraguay and Argentina. Because Canada had not recognized the Soviet government, Moscow would not deal with them directly. Emigrants bound for Canada were processed through Riga. Those who could not pass the medical exam—usually because of trachoma—were allowed to stay in Germany and Southampton in England until they were healthy. By 1930, 21,000 Mennonites had arrived in Canada, most on credit provided by the Canadian Pacific Railway. Another group went to Paraguay where they founded the Fernheim and Friesland Colonies.

A group of Mennonites from western Siberia who subsequently settled along the Amur in unrealized hopes of better living conditions, escaped over the frozen river to Harbin, China. A few hundred were allowed entry into California and Washington. The majority remained as refugees until the Nansen International Office for Refugees of the League of Nations intervened and arranged resettlement in Paraguay and Brazil in 1932.

Those that remained in their home villages were subject to exile to Siberia and other remote regions east of the Urals. From 1929 to 1940, one in eight men were removed, usually under the pretext of political accusations, to labor camps from which few ever returned or were heard from again.

=== Collectivization ===
With the onset of economic and agricultural reforms, large estates and the communal land of the Mennonite colonies were confiscated. The next step was to reduce the model farms by 60% and then another 50% percent—an insufficient size to support a family. The confiscated land was given to peasants from outside the Mennonite communities, often communist party members. These new villagers soon controlled the local government, further confiscating land and rights from the Mennonite majority by labeling landowners and leaders kulaks and sending them into exile. The government taxed the remaining landowners so heavily that they could not possibly produce enough to meet the obligation and their land was confiscated as payment. As collectivization proceeded, there was some hope that Mennonites could run their own collective farms, but with the introduction of Stalin&#x27;s first five-year plan there was no hope that such a scheme would be allowed.

Starting in 1918 religious freedoms were restricted. Churches and congregations had to be registered with the government. Ministers were disenfranchised and lost their rights as citizens. Ministers could not be teachers, which was the livelihood of many Mennonite pastors. They and their family members could not join cooperatives or craft guilds. Because of these restrictions, ministers had a strong incentive to emigrate, and few were willing to replace them. Congregations could no longer do charitable work of any kind, which destroyed the well developed social institutions with the Mennonite colonies. Villages lost control of their schools; all religious content was prohibited. Sunday was abolished as a holiday.

During World War I the Russians had permitted Mennonites to serve in non-combat capacities in the military. This practice was not continued.

Following the Russian withdrawal from World War I, the Russian Civil War ensued, with an ultimate Red victory. The Russian Mennonites, many of whom were also known as being part of the one million or so Volga Germans living in their own established communities, were approached by the Soviet authorities and issued new standards and expectations. Education was to be controlled according to these new directives by the State, and families were eventually to be separated, with children sent to various live-in schools, while parents were to be assigned according to State needs.

These directives were described by a Volga German teacher, Henry Wieler, who attended these State meetings and related the events in his detailed Journal, Tagabook, which today is partially translated but available in the published book, The Quiet in the Land, by Henry Wieler.

=== World War II to the 21st century ===
In 1937 and 1938 the NKVD carried out ethnically motivated purges of German descendants and German language speakers, including Mennonites. As Stalin fomented cooperation with the Russian Orthodox Church in World War II, Mennonites and Protestants were seen as more dangerous. During the Holodomor in Ukraine, there was active persecution of German-speaking people as a potential threat to the state, and a ban on organized religion. The hostilities of World War I had increased tensions with ethnic Ukrainians, and Mennonites with family members living abroad were targeted during the Great Purge.

The Mennonites suffered persecution by the Stalinist regime, which advocated state atheism. As pacifists within an increasingly military regime under Stalin and then (after invasion of Ukraine and parts of Russia by Hitler) the Nazis, and as &quot;Volga Germans&quot; whose abuse Hitler had used as a pretext to invade, Mennonites were subject to special pressure to join military units. Mennonites played a central role in managing the labor force at Stutthof concentration camp, and some, recruited into SS units, served as guards at concentration camps or carried out shootings of prisoners. Other Mennonites were conscripted by force into German units as support and shock troops and some participated in anti-partisan operations. Most history of this period is anecdotal and based on family memoirs and letters from the Gulags.

Peter Letkemann of University of Winnipeg characterizes the casualties and abuses of this period as &quot;victims of terror and repression in the Soviet Union during the 40-year period from 1917–1956.&quot; This would overlap somewhat with the &quot;Siberian Germans&quot; deported to that region who have lost touch entirely with the Mennonite mainstream worldwide.

Between 1987 and 1993 about 100,000 persons of Mennonite origin emigrated from the USSR to Germany. Today in Ukraine there are three Mennonite communities in Zaporizhzhia Oblast and Kherson Oblast and a Mennonite community in Ternopil Oblast.

=== North America ===
After 1870 about 18,000 Russian Mennonites, fearing conscription into military service and state influence on their education systems, emigrated to the Plains States of the US and the Western Provinces of Canada. The more liberal went in general to the US where the majority over a period of several decades assimilated more or less into the mainstream society.
Russian Mennonites settled much of South Central Kansas, which owes its reputation as a wheat-producing state in large measure to its early Mennonite settlers. Winter wheat was introduced to Kansas in 1873. The following year the Mennonites, who had experience with dry land farming in Russia, quickly took advantage of its characteristics, resulting in rapid expansion of the milling industry in the state. It is planted in the fall and harvested in June and July of the following summer, and is therefore ideally suited to cold winters and the hot, dry Kansas summers. Kansas remains a top producer of wheat in America to this day.

The more conservative Old Colony, Bergthal Mennonites and Kleine Gemeinde went to Canada which promised privileges equal to those previously held in Russia (no conscription into military service and German language private schools) and a large tract of land divided into two &quot;Reserves&quot;. The Mennonites settled mostly in Manitoba in areas east and west of the Red River, called East Reserve and West Reserve.

They brought with them many of their institutions and practices, especially their traditional settling pattern which meant that they settled in vast exclusively Mennonite areas where they formed villages with German names such as Blumenort, Steinbach and Grünthal.
The more conservative faction of the Manitoba Mennonites decided to leave Canada after World War I and moved to Mexico mostly in the years 1922–1927 and to Paraguay in 1927. The main reasons were compulsory attendance at public schools and anti-German sentiments because of the war. Some latercomers went to Mexico in 1948. After the more conservative fraction had left for Mexico, most of the remaining Mennonites quickly assimilated into the mainstream society.

Descendants of Manitoba Mennonites today form the majority of Conservative Mennonites in Latin America, counting more than 200,000. Because many of these Mennonites from Canada still hold Canadian passports-there was and still is a steady flow back to Canada fed by the high birth rates of conservative Mennonites. These emigrants strengthen the Russian Mennonite element in the Canadian Mennonite churches.

With the Russian Mennonites came separate denominations previously unseen in North America, such as the Mennonite Brethren.

A second wave of Russian Mennonites came out of Russia after the bloody strife following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and a third wave in the aftermath of World War I. These people, having lost everything they had known, found their way to settlements in Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, British Columbia and Ontario and in many regions of the United States. Some joined with previous Mennonite groups, while others formed their own. A key figure negotiating with the government on behalf of 20,000 of the Mennonite immigrants at this time, and mediating among the Mennonites themselves, was David Toews, founding chairman of the Canadian Mennonite Board of Colonization.

=== Latin America ===
The emigration from Canada to Mexico and Paraguay in the 1920s was a reaction to the introduction of universal, secular compulsory education in 1917 requiring the use of the English language, which the more conservative Mennonites saw as a threat to the religious basis of their community.

The first colony in a Latin American country was established by Mennonites from Canada between 1922 and 1925 in Mexico in the state of Chihuahua near the city of Cuauhtémoc. The next country was Paraguay, where Menno Colony was formed 1927 by Mennonites from Canada, whereas Fernheim and Friesland Colonies were formed in the 1930s by Mennonites from the Soviet Union who were fleeing starvation (Holodomor), persecution of religion and Collectivization under Stalin. Neuland and Volendam Colonies were founded 1947 by Mennonites who fled the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. All other Mennonite colonies in Latin America were formed by Mennonites who settled in North America since 1870, partly via Mexico and Belize.

Beginning in 1954 conservative Mennonites settled in East-Bolivia, in the Santa Cruz Department. Bolivia soon became the refuge for Mennonites who wanted to flee the influences of modern society. In 2006 there were 41 Mennonite colonies in Bolivia. Old Colony Mennonites went from Mexico to Belize in 1959 and to Argentina in 1986.

* 74,122 in Mexico
* 150,000 in Bolivia
* 40,000 in Paraguay
* 10,000 in Belize
* 10,000 in Brazil
* 4,000 in Argentina
* 1,000 in Uruguay
* 900 in Peru
* 500 in Colombia

As of 2017, the population of Mennonites living in Mexico has declined sharply, according to some estimates. Worsening poverty, water shortages and drug-related violence across northern Mexico have provoked large numbers of Mennonites living in the Mexican states of Durango and Chihuahua to relocate abroad in recent years, especially to Canada and other regions of Latin America. Between 2012 and 2017 alone, it is estimated that at least 30,000 Mexican Mennonites emigrated to Canada.

A distinguished writer and historian about the Russian Mennonites in Latin America, especially in Paraguay, was Peter P. Klassen.

== Denominations ==
=== Church of God in Christ, Mennonite ===

The Church of God in Christ, Mennonite, commonly referred to as Holdeman Mennonites after the founder of the church, is a theologically Conservative Mennonite plain dress denomination founded in the United States but made up primarily of descendants of Russian Mennonites, including many former members of the Kleine Gemeinde. In 2013 the church had 24,400 baptized members.

=== General Conference ===

The main body of Mennonites continued to be congregational in organization until 1882 when the &quot;General Conference of Mennonite Congregations in Russia&quot; was formed. Cooperation among Mennonite congregations throughout the empire became necessary for dealing with common interests, such as publishing a hymnal, adopting a confession of faith, preserving the German language, education and running the forestry service, an alternative to military service. The conference adopted the motto &quot;Unity in essentials, tolerance in non-essentials, moderation in all things&quot;.

The Russianization program of Stolypin required the conference to publish its proceedings in Russian, certify all delegates with the imperial government and allow a government representative to attend all sessions. The conference found itself devoting more time to dealing with changing government policies and protecting the special privileges of Mennonites. An important task was to convince the government that Mennonitism was an established religion and not a &quot;sect&quot;, a label applied to small religious groups who were regularly mistreated within the Russian empire.

The group that immigrated to North America called itself the General Conference Mennonite Church. Today, the main branches of the former General Conference Mennonite Church have split into the Mennonite Church Canada (since 2000) and the Mennonite Church USA (since 2002).

=== Kleine Gemeinde ===

Klaas Reimer and a group of eighteen followers broke from the main group and formed the (small congregation). Reimer&#x27;s main complaint was that Mennonite leaders were straying from their traditional nonresistant stance when they turned lawbreakers over to the government for punishment while at the same time church leaders were lax in enforcing spiritual discipline. In 1860 a portion of this group moved to Crimea, adopted baptism by immersion and became known as the Krimmer Mennonite Brethren. Today, the largest group of Kleine Gemeinde are located in Mexico. The majority of the Canadian congregations became theologically evangelical in the mid-20th century and are now called the Evangelical Mennonite Conference.

=== Mennonite Brethren ===

Pietistic influences, introduced earlier among the West Prussian Mennonites, were transplanted to the Molotschna colony. The pastor of a neighboring congregation, Eduard Wüst, reinforced this pietism. Wüst was a revivalist who stressed repentance and Christ as a personal savior, influencing Catholics, Lutherans and Mennonites in the area. He associated with many Mennonite leaders, including Leonhard Sudermann.

In 1859, Joseph Höttmann, a former associate of Wüst met with a group of Mennonites to discuss problems within the main Mennonite body. Their discussion centered on participating in closed communion with church members who were unholy or not converted and baptism of adults by immersion.

The Mennonite Brethren Church formally broke with the main church on January 6, 1860, when this growing group of dissenters presented a document to the elders of the Molotschna Mennonite Churches which indicated &quot;that the total Mennonite brotherhood has decayed to the extent that we can no more be part of it&quot; and fear the &quot;approach of an unavoidable judgment of God.&quot; The Mennonite Brethren movement spread throughout the Mennonite colonies and produced many distinguished leaders, particularly in Molotschna. By breaking religious and cultural patterns that had become a hindrance to Mennonite society, the contribution of the Mennonite Brethren allowed all Mennonites groups to pursue a more wholesome Christian life.

=== Old Colony ===

Not to be confused with Old Order Mennonites, who are primarily of Swiss-German origin, the name Old Colony Mennonites (German: Altkolonier-Mennoniten) refers to part of the Russian Mennonite movement that is descended from colonists who migrated from the Chortitza Colony, as opposed to the slightly newer Molotschna colony, in Russia and are theologically Conservative Mennonites. Old Colony Mennonites consist of a number of groups that are still quite conservative, including Sommerfelder, Reinlander, and Old Colony, as well as groups that are no longer as conservative such as the Christian Mennonite Conference (formerly the Chortitzer Mennonite conference), which is evangelical in doctrine.

== Culture ==
Most ethnic Russian Mennonites no longer reside in Russia, with the majority being spread across the Americas. Russian Mennonites are diverse in terms of theology and dress, while many have assimilated into larger American, Canadian, or Mexican culture. Still shared by many Russian Mennonites, assimilated or not, is the Plautdietsch language, certain dishes Mennonite cuisine such as vereniki, zwieback, and farmer sausage and certain common surnames such as Reimer, Friesen, Penner and dozens of others. Russian Mennonites, particularly in Canada, have also written many well known works of literature.

== Terminology ==
Many Mennonites, particularly in Western Canada, use the term &quot;Russian Mennonite&quot; as term of culture or ethnicity referring to their Dutch and Prussian ancestry and heritage, even if they never lived in Russia themselves. The term, does not, however, mean that they are ethnically Russian, but refers to the country they lived in before immigrating to the Americas. &quot;Low-German Mennonites&quot; is also used in order to avoid this conflation.

Russian Mennonites can be further divided into several groups and labels based on immigration history. The term &quot;Kanadier&quot; refers to Russian Mennonites who came to Canada in the 1870s, some of whom later moved to Mexico. The label &quot;Russlander&quot; refers to Russian Mennonites who came to the Americas in the 1920s. Those who left Europe after World War II were often called &quot;displaced persons&quot; or &quot;DPs&quot;, although this term is not specific to Mennonites. The term &quot;Aussiedler&quot; refers to Russian Mennonites who stayed in the Soviet Union throughout the 20th century before leaving for Germany or the Americas following the collapse of the Soviet Union.

<text>Cheikh Tidiane Gadio (born 16 September 1956) is a Pan African political figure and diplomat who has held prominent positions on the African continent over the last two decades. He served as a special envoy on matters of conflict prevention and resolution in Africa, including Special Envoy of the Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie (OIF) to Mali (September 2020 – present), Special Envoy for the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) for the Central African Republique (February 2014 – March 2017), and Special Representative for Africa for the Secretary General of OIC (January 2016 – March 2017).

Gadio is an elected Congressman (2017) and a Vice President of the Senegalese Parliament (2019). He also serves as President of the Institute for Pan-African Strategies, Peace-Security-Governance (IPS), a Dakar-based think-thank engaged in research, convenings, strategic communications, and advocacy on issues of African peace, security, development, governance and unity.

Gadio stood as a candidate for the Senegalese presidency in the February 2012 election, prior to which he served as Minister of Foreign Affairs (April 2000 – October 2009) and appointed State Minister from 2002 to 2009.

==Early life and career==

Cheikh Tidiane Gadio was born 16 September 1956 in Senegal&#x27;s first capital, Saint Louis. He comes from a traditional Muslim Fulani family with its origins in the Department of Podor in an area known as Fouta Toro in Northern Senegal. His parents moved to Saint Louis from their native Fouta Toro, both from aristocratic lineage of great Islamic scholars and rulers of the Almamiya of Fouta Toro. Gadio is a fourth-generation descendant of Almamy Youssouf Cire Ly, a famous king-ruler of Fouta who served as &quot;Almamy&quot; (ruler) for a nearly unprecedented 11 terms. By way of his maternal lineage, he is a grandson of the renown Fulani Scholar Dewo Elimane Moctar LY, founder of the historic city of Saldé Tebegoutt.

Gadio&#x27;s father, El Hadj Ousmane Aliou Gadio (from the village of Gadiobe), was a decorated World War II veteran who served as president of the Association of Veterans and Prisoners of War at the Institute of Pape Gueye Fall in Dakar, Senegal. He moved to Dakar at the age of 3, when the Senegalese capital was moved from Saint Louis to Dakar, where he did most of his primary schooling. Gadio claims all three heritages: Fouta Toro, Saint Louis and Dakar. At age 12, as a exceptional young student, he was tapped to enroll as a young cadet in Prytanée Militaire de Saint Louis, a highly, a highly selective international military academy where he was first acquainted with Pan-Africanism through close friendships developed with students from Niger, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire and Burkina Faso.

===Education===
After completing his secondary studies in Senegal, Gadio moved to Paris, France to continue his studies. During his stay in Paris, he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in the Sociology of Development and International Relations from the University of Paris 8 – Vincennes (1981), a Certificate of Professional Training in Journalism with a concentration in Broadcast Journalism from Centre de formation des Journalistes de Paris (1982), a master&#x27;s in Sociology with a concentration in Information and Communication Sciences from the University of Paris 7 – Jussieu (1983), and an Advanced Graduate Studies Diploma (D.E.A.) in Sociology of Mass Communication with a concentration in Mass Communication and Development and Education and information Technology from the University Paris IV-Sorbonne (René Descartes) (1984). 
After completing his studies in France, Gadio obtained a diploma of practical training in communication technologies and program development for audio-visual education in Montreal 1986). He later moved to the United States, where he attended the Ohio State University and earned a (Ph.D.) doctorate in Communication (1994).

===Early career===
Gadio was widely published in his early career, with over 70 articles and research papers published in Démocraties Africaines, Sud Hebdo, Sud Quotidien, Le Devoir, Tribune Africaine, and la Revue Africaine de la Communication on a range of issues, including new communication technologies, training and curriculum development, institutional reform, democratization, and development in Africa.

As a young Pan-Africanist, Gadio took on several influential journalistic roles from 1980 to 1996: editor in chief of the Parisian quarterly African review (Tribune Africaine), a journal advocating African unity and new approaches to African development (1980-1984); collaborator and political analyst on African issues for broadcast television weeklies such as &quot;African Time&quot; and &quot;Forum Africain&quot; broadcasting in the Tri-State area of New York, New-Jersey, Connecticut (1992-1994); assistant professor of communication at CESTI, Dakar University in Senegal where he conducted research and lectured on communication technology, television production, political economy of telecommunications, telephony, telematics and internet (1984 – 1988 and 1994 – 1996).

In 1996, Gadio took on the role of coordinator of the US-Africa Institute, a Private Voluntary Organization with the aim of building stronger ties between the US and Africa in the areas of trade, investment, new communication technologies, education and democratization (1996 – 1999), then of as the regional director for Africa at the School for international Training (SIT) in Vermont, the accredited college of World Learning, an international organization committed to promoting international understanding and cross-cultural education (1998-1999). During his tenure at SIT, his portfolio included programs in Southern Africa (South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe) and Francophone Africa (Morocco, Cameroon, Mali and Madagascar). During the same period, he was also a registered consultant for the United Nations (UNOPS) and the European Commission&#x27;s Technical Assistance to the third World Countries Programme.
He was coordinator for West and Francophone Africa (West and Francophone), World Links for Development Program, WBI, The World Bank in Washington, DC, when he was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs of Senegal in April 2000.

==Diplomatic and political career==
Gadio was appointed as Foreign Minister of the Republic of Senegal when Abdoulaye Wade took office as President in April 2000. He was later promoted to the rank of Minister of State, while retaining the foreign affairs portfolio, in November 2002.

As Foreign Minister, Gadio played a prominent role in African diplomacy, and President Wade praised him as &quot;the best foreign minister in Africa.&quot; He was appointed Chairman of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) Council of Ministers and Chairman of the ECOWAS Peace and Mediation Council, roles in which he served from January 2002 – January 2003. During his tenure as Chairman, he led negotiations that led to the 17 October 2002 signing of the cease-fire agreement that ended the first phase of the Civil War in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire. During his tenure as Foreign Minister of Republic of Senegal, Dr. Gadio led several successful mediation missions in Madagascar, Guinea Bissau, Sudan, Libya, and Mauritania, to end conflicts and establish peace (e.g., the Dakar Agreement of May 2003 between Madagascar political leaders; the Dakar Peace Agreement of March 2008 between Chad and Sudan; the African Union International Mediation in Mauritania of June 2009; and the resumption of diplomatic ties between Senegal and China, signed 25 October 2005 in Beijing).

At the African Union summit in Accra, Ghana in July 2007, where leaders discussed whether a United States of Africa should be created immediately or gradually, Dr. Gadio expressed Senegal&#x27;s stance in favor of immediate creation, saying that &quot;We are ready to abandon partially or totally our sovereignty to join a unity government in Africa.&quot; He mentioned the possibility that Senegal could join a smaller union of willing states if the rest of Africa was not ready.

After more than nine years as Foreign Minister, Gadio was replaced by Madické Niang in the government named on 1 October 2009. No reason was given, although in the Senegalese press it was reported that Gadio had a poor relationship with Karim Wade, the President&#x27;s son, who also served in the government as Minister of State for International Cooperation, Infrastructure, Air Transport, and Public Works. Gadio was against all attempts of monarchical transfer of power (or worse &quot;dynastic succession&quot;), which he believed President Wade was preparing his son for. In protest, Gadio did not attend the weekly ministerial meetings at the presidential palace for six months prior to his departure from Wade&#x27;s government.

A few months after his dismissal, Gadio launched a new political movement, the Citizen Political Movement (Mouvement politique citoyen Luy Jot Jotna; MPCL) in May 2010, and reaffirmed his support for pan-Africanism expressing his hope for an &quot;African Renaissance&quot; in the 21st century. Gadio joined the opposition against President Wade&#x27;s regime and vowed to combat all efforts to eliminate the second round of presidential elections in Senegal; the proposal to reduce elections to a single round was perceived as a change that would work to Wade&#x27;s benefit and allow him to install his son in power. Dr. Gadio stood in the February 2012 presidential election as one of the candidates of the 23 June Movement (M23), he placed eighth in the elections out of 14 candidates.

==Life post diplomatic service==

After leaving Wade&#x27;s government, in November 2009 Gadio co-founded a consulting and advisory firm (Sarata Holding LLC) for &quot;Business and Development Partnerships with Africa,&quot; with three locations: Dakar, Washington, DC, Casablanca. He was the Chairman and CEO of that firm until March 2016.

In November 2012, he founded the Pan-African Strategies Institute, and he has subsequently served as its President. Speaking at the Bamako Forum in February 2015, he argued in favor of integration between regions as a step towards African unity. He said that some national borders, such as those separating Senegal from Gambia and Guinea-Bissau, lacked justification and should be eliminated.

Gadio was appointed Special Envoy for the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) for the Central African Republique in February 2014 and served as such for three years. He was given an additional appointment in 2016 with OIC as the Secretary General Special Representative for Africa in charge of the Mali and Sahel crisis, Boko Haram and The Lake Chad Basin countries.
After legislative elections in 2017, in which Gadio&#x27;s political party participated, he was elected to the Senegalese Parliament as a Congressman for 5 years.

=== Gadio&#x27;s legal scandal in the U.S.===

In November 2017, Gadio was accused of being complicit in corrupt acts of CEFC officials that the US Justice Department charged were violative of the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. He was subjected to home confinement in his family home in Maryland for a period of 9 months. 

After participating in a 9-month process which included multiple interviews with federal prosecutors, the charges withdrew the charges but offered no explanation for the decision on September 14 2018. The NYTimes article adds, &quot;dismissals of this sort often come with agreements not to prosecute in return for testimony.&quot;

Gadio was requested to await the trial of the charged CEFC official before going back home – in case he was needed to testify. Gadio was able to return to Senegal cleared of all charges in December 2018. He immediately regained his position as a congressman and 10 months later was elected as a vice president of the Senegalese Parliament.
Gadio, once home, called a press conference, attended by nearly 40 National and international journalists and several media outlets, to issue a statement that, after more than a decade serving at the highest levels of the Senegalese government, he was regarded as having a perfect record in good and ethical governance. He indicated that the US incident could only be termed &quot;a tragic misunderstanding,&quot; and that he was glad, after a long process, to reclaim his good name.
In October 2019, Dr. Gadio was elected as a Vice President of the Senegalese National Assembly. He is currently the Special Envoy of OIF (Organisation Internationale de la Francophonie) to Mali, a role in which he has served since September 2020.

<text>The Young Artist Award (originally known as the Youth in Film Award) is an accolade presented by the Young Artist Foundation, a nonprofit organization founded in 1978 to honor excellence of youth performers, and to provide scholarships for young artists who may be physically disabled or financially unstable.

First presented in 1979, the Young Artist Awards was the first organization established to specifically recognize and award the contributions of performers under the age of 18 in the fields of film, television, theater, and music.

The 1st Youth In Film Awards ceremony was held in October 1979, at the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Hollywood to honor outstanding young performers of the 1978/1979 season.

== Young Artist Association ==
The Young Artist Association (originally known as the Hollywood Women&#x27;s Photo and Press Club, and later, the Youth in Film Association) is a non-profit organization founded in 1978 to recognize and award excellence of youth performers, and to provide scholarships for young artists who may be physically or financially challenged. The Young Artist Association was the first organization to establish an awards ceremony specifically set to recognize and award the contributions of performers under the age of 21 in the fields of film, television, theater, and music.

== Young Artist Foundation ==
The Young Artist Foundation is a non-profit 501(c) organization founded in 1978 by long-standing Hollywood Foreign Press (Golden Globes) member Maureen Dragone and dedicated to presenting scholarships to physically or financially challenged aspiring young artists, allowing them to pursue a career in entertainment by attending a performing arts school of their choice. The scholarship program is funded through donations including contribution from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association.

== Young Artist Awards ==

=== History ===
The Young Artist Awards are presented annually by the Young Artist Association. Originally known as the Youth In Film Awards for the first twenty years, the name was officially changed to the Young Artist Awards for the 21st annual awards ceremony in March 2000. Playfully referred to as the &quot;Kiddie Oscars&quot;, the Young Artist Awards are regarded as young Hollywood&#x27;s answer to the Academy Awards, recognizing children for their work within the entertainment industry.

First presented for the 1978–1979 entertainment season, the awards were envisioned by Maureen Dragone, as a way to honor talented young people in film, television, and music who might otherwise be eclipsed by their adult co-stars. Two notable examples that year being young Ricky Schroder in &quot;The Champ&quot; and Justin Henry in &quot;Kramer vs. Kramer&quot;, who were each nominated for Golden Globes in the same categories as their adult counterparts. Originally held in the autumn in its early years, the awards ceremony has traditionally taken place in the spring for more than 20 years.

=== Statuette ===
The original Youth In Film Award was a statuette was similar to a miniature Oscar. A gilded figure of a man holding a laurel wreath instead of a sword and standing upon a relatively large &quot;trophy&quot; style base. The current Young Artist Award statuette, is a figure displaying a five-pointed star above its head and standing upon a smaller base. In addition to the Young Artist Award statuette presented to the winners, all nominees are presented with a special nomination plaque at the ceremony, commemorating their nominations in their respective categories.

=== Voting ===
Candidates considered for nomination must be between the ages of 5 and 21 and are usually submitted for consideration by producers or by the young artist&#x27;s agent or manager. Submissions are traditionally due by the end of January to mid-February and nominees are announced about one month later at an annual nomination ceremony and party. Originally conceived of as a way to acknowledge young artists under the age of 21, the focus of the awards has shifted over time to focus primarily on young artists who were under the age of 18 at the time of principal production of the project for which they are nominated.

Winners are selected by members of the Young Artist Association. Originally known as the Hollywood Women&#x27;s Photo and Press Club, and later, the Youth in Film Association, the general membership was originally composed of 88 journalists and photographers, who were active in various branches of the arts. Today, the Young Artist Association has a voting board of over 125 members composed of journalists, agents, and former child performers. Winners are selected by secret ballot of all associated with the Young Artist Association as well as former nominees.

=== Categories ===
The various Young Artist Awards categories have evolved extensively since the first awards were presented. Originally beginning with only 11 competitive categories in 1979, the first categories included &quot;Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a Motion Picture&quot;, &quot;Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a TV Series or Special&quot;, &quot;Best Juvenile Actor and Actress in a Daytime TV Series&quot;, and &quot;Best Male and Female Juvenile Recording Artist&quot;, as well as competitive categories honoring studios and networks for &quot;family friendly&quot; films and television programming.

Over time, the competitive categories have been expanded to include &quot;Best Young Actor and Actress in an International Feature Film&quot;, &quot;Best Young Actor and Actress in a Short Film&quot;, &quot;Best Young Supporting Actor and Actress in Film&quot;, &quot;Best Young Ensemble Cast&quot;, &quot;Best Young Recurring Actor and Actress in a TV Series&quot;, and &quot;Best Young Guest-starring Actor and Actress in a TV Series&quot;, with many of the categories being split to acknowledge young artists age 10 and under in their own separate categories. In addition to its well-known film and television awards, the association has also recognized the achievements of youth in other fields of the performing arts over the years, including theater, dance, commercials, journalism, radio, and stand-up comedy.

=== Special awards ===
While many of the acting categories have been expanded over time, some early competitive categories such as &quot;Best Juvenile Recording Artist&quot;, &quot;Best Family Motion Picture&quot;, and &quot;Best Family TV Series&quot; have been phased out over the years, with accolades for those achievements now being bestowed in the form of special &quot;Honorary&quot; awards.

The foundation&#x27;s most notable annual honorary awards include the &quot;Jackie Coogan Award&quot;, often presented to film studios, producers, or directors for their &quot;Outstanding Contribution To Youth Through Entertainment&quot;, and the &quot;Former Child Star Award&quot;, presented as the foundation&#x27;s &quot;Lifetime Achievement Award&quot; honoring former child stars for their achievements.

=== Ceremony ===
The ceremony is held annually in Hollywood and has traditionally been considered one of the more formal children&#x27;s awards ceremonies, with honorees and their chaperones &quot;dressing-up&quot; for the occasion and arriving in limousines. All members of the press are invited to attend the pre-show red carpet arrivals as young celebrity attendees make their entrances and sign autographs, and each year&#x27;s presenters are often selected from the previous year&#x27;s young winners or from that year&#x27;s list of nominees. After the ceremony is the annual banquet dinner and then dancing with live musical entertainment often provided by talented young musical artists of the day.

The first Youth In Film Awards were presented in October 1979 at a banquet ceremony held at the Sheraton Universal Hotel in Hollywood, California.

<text>IC 434 is a bright emission nebula in the equatorial constellation of Orion. It was discovered on February 1, 1786, by German-British astronomer William Herschel. The nebula is located at a distance of approximately from the Sun and spans the interior of a neutral hydrogen shell with an angular size of . At that distance, the dimensions correspond to a projected size of .

This is an H II region that is being ionized by ultraviolet radiation from the nearby Sigma Orionis (σ Ori) multi-star system. An additional half dozen stars provide further illumination of IC 434. This H II region is one of the youngest to form around members of the Orion OB1 association of hot stars. The region has a radius of about and a mass of around The mass displaced by the advancing ionization front of IC 434 is estimated at . The nebula includes dust with an estimated mass of .

IC 434 is surrounded by a shell of neutral hydrogen gas with the identifier GS206-17+13. The primary driving energy behind this expanding shell was likely supplied by the blue supergiant Epsilon Orionis. The Horsehead Nebula is a dark nebula that is silhouetted against the diffuse background of IC 434. It is protruding from the Orion B molecular cloud, which is part of the Orion molecular cloud complex.

<doc id="910924" wikidata="Q3443958" url="?curid=910924" title="Ontario Highway 7">
<text>King&#x27;s Highway 7, commonly referred to as Highway 7 (abbreviated as Hwy 7) and historically as the Northern Highway, is a provincially maintained highway in the Canadian province of Ontario. At its peak, Highway 7 measured in length, stretching from Highway 40 east of Sarnia in Southwestern Ontario to Highway 17 west of Ottawa in Eastern Ontario. However, due in part to the construction of Highways 402 and 407, the province transferred the sections of Highway 7 west of London and through the Greater Toronto Area to county and regional jurisdiction. The highway is now long; the western segment begins at Highway 4 north of London and extends to Georgetown, while the eastern segment begins at Donald Cousens Parkway in Markham and extends to Highway 417 in Ottawa.

Highway 7 was first designated in 1920 between Sarnia and Guelph and extended to Brampton the following year. Between 1927 and 1932, the highway was more than doubled in length as it was gradually extended eastward to Perth, where Highway 15 continued to Ottawa via Carleton Place. In the early 1960s, that section of Highway 15 was renumbered as Highway 7. In that same decade, the Conestoga Parkway through Kitchener and the Peterborough Bypass were constructed. During the 1970s and 1980s, many sections of Highway 7 were widened from the initial two lane cross-section to four or six lanes. Within central York Region, where it would share a narrow corridor with the then-future Highway 407, the route was upgraded to a limited-access arterial highway in preparation for the construction of the latter route.

Soon thereafter, that new tollway would act as justification for transferring the section of Highway 7 through the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) to regional governments. The sections became Peel Regional Road 107 Bovaird Drive West to Highway 410 and Queen Street East from east of 410 respectively) and York Regional Road 7. In the west, the construction of Highway 402 between Sarnia and London provided an uninterrupted alternative to Highway 7, resulting in the transfer of the section west of Highway 4. A third transfer took place in Peterborough, briefly separating the route into three discontinuous segments, but has since been rectified by renumbering a section of Highway 7A. From 2007 to 2012, the section of Highway 7 between Carleton Place and Ottawa has been widened to a divided freeway. In addition, work is underway to extend the Conestoga Parkway to New Hamburg as well as to build a new freeway between Kitchener and Guelph.

== Route description ==
Originally, Highway 7 extended as far west as Sarnia, remaining as a provincial highway for some time after the extension of Highway 402 to London. At Warwick, Highway 7 crosses Highway 402, west of that point these routes ran parallel to each other for 40 km (both roads never being further than 2 km apart) until Highway 40. Upon entering the Sarnia city limits from the east on Highway 7, drivers encountered a plethora of motels and restaurants, the Sarnia Airport, and attractions such as Hiawatha Racetrack and Waterpark, earning the stretch between Modeland Road and Airport Road the nickname of the &quot;Golden Mile&quot;. The interchange with Highway 40 marked the former western terminus of Highway 7, thereafter the road continues as Exmouth Street as the opposing carriageways merge and follow an S curve before passing Lambton Mall. Since being downloaded to municipal authorities, the former highway is now known as Lambton County Road 22 (London Line) and Middlesex County Road 7 (Elginfield Road).

=== Western segment ===
The current western segment of Highway 7 travels from Elginfield in Middlesex County in the southwest to the Halton - Peel border at Norval near Brampton; a distance of . The western segment was separated from the rest of Highway 7 on June 7, 1997, when the section from Brampton to Markham was downloaded due to the opening of Highway 407. A portion of this segment, from Waterloo Regional Road 51 south of Baden to Highway 85 in Kitchener is a freeway, forming part of the Conestoga Parkway. Plans to build a freeway bypass of Highway 7 from Kitchener to Guelph are currently underway (see below).

The current route begins at Highway 4, approximately north of London and immediately southeast of the village of Lucan; the former routing continued west along Elginfield Road through Parkhill and Arkona. Though the highway changes direction several times between Elginfield and Kitchener, it is mostly straight and two lanes wide, except east of New Hamburg where it widens to four lanes. Proceeding east-northeast through farmland, the highway meets the southern terminus of Highway 23 just later. It continues, serving as the boundary between Lucan Biddulph to the north and Middlesex Centre to the south, and later as the boundary between Perth County to the north and Middlesex and Oxford counties, with the tripoint of the three at County Road 120A south of St. Marys. Southeast of St. Marys, Highway 7 curves northeast into Perth County until it reaches downtown Stratford, where it meets Highway 8.

The two highways travel east concurrently for , passing through the town of Shakespeare as it travels in a straight line through farmland. Southwest of New Hamburg, the route curves northeast into Waterloo Region, eventually widening into the four-lane Conestoga Parkway east of Nafziger Road. It follows this divided freeway past interchanges at Waterloo Regional Road 51 (Foundry Street) south of Baden, Waterloo Regional Road 12 (Queen Street/Notre Dame Drive) south of Petersburg, and Waterloo Regional Road 70 (Trussler Road) north of Mannheim, where it enters Kitchener and becomes surrounded by residential subdivisions. Within Kitchener, Highway 7 encounters interchanges at Waterloo Regional Road 58 (Fischer-Hallman Road)(at which point it widens to six lanes), Waterloo Regional Road 28 (Homer Watson Boulevard), Waterloo Regional Road 53 (Courtland Avenue), Waterloo Regional Road 15 (King Street)/Highway 8 (at which point it widens to eight lanes), Waterloo Regional Road 14 (Ottawa Street) and Waterloo Regional Road 55 (Victoria Street). The Highway 8 concurrency ends at the King Street interchange, with it diverging southeast onto the Freeport Diversion. Highway 7 exits at Victoria Street (four-lane arterial) while the parkway continues north into Waterloo as Highway 85. Construction began in June 2015 on a future freeway between Kitchener and Guelph that will make use of a reconfigured Wellington Street interchange, just north of Victoria Street, and tie in with the northern end of the Hanlon Expressway.

Highway 7 exits Kitchener after crossing the Grand River, where it enters farmland again for the brief journey to Guelph along Victoria Street and Woodlawn Road. Midway between the two cities, the route enters Wellington County. Within Guelph, it meets Highway 6 at the northern end of the Hanlon Expressway. The two routes travel southeast along the expressway to Wellington County Road 124 (Wellington Street, former Highway 24), where Highway 7 branches northeast into downtown Guelph. It exits the city along York Road after crossing the Speed River, travelling parallel to and south of the Goderich–Exeter Railway. At Rockwood, the highway enters Halton Region and begins to zig-zag through several communities in Halton Hills. These include Acton, where the route intersects former Highway 25, and Georgetown. Just east of Norval, the western section of Highway 7 ends at the Halton–Peel boundary. The road continues into Brampton as Peel Regional Road 107 (Bovaird Drive). The former highway then followed Highway 410 south, where it continued east along Queen Street (also Peel Road 107).

Part of the Highway 7 segment through Vaughan and Richmond Hill was relocated on a new alignment (as a 6 lane at-grade expressway) in 1987 in order to make way for the future toll route Highway 407 (where the two highways were forced to share a narrow right-of-way due to development and the hydro corridor) and to eliminate a jog along Bathurst Street; which also resulted in a section from west of Dufferin Street becoming a westerly extension of Centre Street. The new Highway 7 expressway has grade-separated crossings with connecting ramps to Dufferin Street, Bathurst Street, Yonge Street, and Bayview Avenue, enabling a speed limit of 80 km per hour; however this segment is not controlled-access as there are signalized intersections, pedestrian sidewalks and bus stops, effectively making it an arterial road. Old sections of Highway 7 bypassed by the new expressway still remain in use between Bathurst Street and Bayview Avenue, but reverted to their original name of &quot;Langstaff Road&quot;. Another former section from Bathurst to Yonge Street is now Centre Street, which requiring motorists to travel north along Yonge Street to rejoin eastbound on Highway 7 along the former route of Langstaff Road. Highway 7 through York Region, despite no longer being a provincial highway since being downloaded to municipal authorities in 1997, is still officially named &quot;Highway 7&quot;, but otherwise has no street name, and received the number York Regional Road 7, displacing Islington Avenue which was redesignated as Regional Road 17. 

Parts of the Markham portion were once called &quot;Wellington Street&quot; as well as sideroad allowance (before 1925 when Highway 7 reached the area), stub of the old road exists today west of Markham Road that was a result of re-alignment of Highway 7. 

The Toronto Star ran a series of articles in 2013 depicting the urbanization of the downloaded Highway 7 in the Greater Toronto Area, including a proposed name change to &quot;Avenue 7&quot;.

=== Eastern segment ===
The eastern segment of Highway 7 runs from Donald Cousens Parkway (York Regional Road 48) in Markham to Highway 417 in Ottawa, a length of . Between Brooklin and north of Sunderland, Highway 7 assumes a north–south routing and is concurrent with Highway 12. The section from Sunderland to the eastern terminus of the highway is designated as part of the Central Ontario Route of the Trans-Canada Highway.

Travelling east from Donald Cousens Parkway, Highway 7 exits the urbanized portion of Markham and enters the Greenbelt, a large tract of land north of the GTA restricted from development. It curves north at the community of Locust Hill along an alignment that eliminated a jog, then curves back to the east as it crosses into Durham Region. It travels north of and parallel to Highway 407 to Brougham, curving to cross the former eastern terminus of the freeway near Brock Road (Durham Regional Road 1). East of the Highway 407 overpass, Highway 7 widens to four lanes and curves around the community of Greenwood and the hill that it stands on. The route crosses the northern end of Pickering, entering Whitby at Lakeridge Road (Durham Regional Road 23). Between Lakeridge Road and Highway 12, the route was rebuilt for the new Highway 407E and West Durham Link, with an overpass constructed at Cochrane Road. East of that, the route enters Brooklin and meets Highway 12.

Highway 7 and Highway 12 travel north concurrently from Brooklin through Durham Region to Sunderland, with Highway 7 eventually departing to the east and entering the City of Kawartha Lakes. Despite its name, the highway passes through a mostly-rural landscape in Kawartha Lakes, bypassing south of Lindsay in the middle of the &quot;city&quot; along a brief concurrency with Highway 35. East of Lindsay, the route meanders southeast towards Peterborough, encountering the divided freeway Highway 115 southwest of the city. The two routes travel east concurrently along the southern edge of the city. Highway 115 and the divided freeway end at Lansdowne Street, onto which Highway 7 turns.
The segment between Peterborough and Perth was built in the 1930s during the Great Depression, as a public works employment project. It was constructed parallel to a CP Rail corridor (now abandoned east of Peterborough) that was built in the 1880s, and used hand-power to dig and build the road whenever possible. From Peterborough to Norwood, the route travels in a straight line through the Peterborough Drumlin Field, connecting to the southern terminus of Highway 28 and crossing the Indian River while otherwise passing through farmland. At Norwood the route suddenly begins to meander as it approaches the undulated Canadian Shield. The section east of Havelock to Perth, unlike the rest of the highway, travels through a relatively isolated area, with few services or residences along the route outside of the several towns that it connects. In contrast to the surroundings west of there, this section is located in dense forest with numerous lakes and muskeg dotting the landscape. It services the villages of Marmora, where it connects with the northern terminus of former Highway 14, Madoc, where it intersect Highway 62, Actinolite, where it meets the northern terminus of Highway 37, and Kaladar, where it intersects Highway 41.

East of Kaladar, Highway 7 begins to serve cottages along the shores of several large lakes that lie near the highway. It intersects the northern terminus of former Highway 38 near Sharbot Lake and later passes south of Maberly before exiting the Canadian Shield and reentering farmland. On the outskirts of Perth, the route meets former Highway 43 and curves northward. It travels around the western and northern shorelines of Mississippi Lake before passing directly south of Carleton Place. Just east of there, Highway 7 widens into a four lane freeway for the remainder of the distance to Highway 417. This section, completed by early 2012, was built by &quot;twinning&quot; the existing two lane highway with a second parallel carriageway to serve as the eastbound lanes. Highway 7 ends at an interchange with Highway 417, where drivers can proceed east to Ottawa or north to Arnprior.
== History ==
The route which would later become Highway 7 was first established by the Department of Public Highways as part of the initial provincial highway network on February26, 1920. This route connected Sarnia to Guelph.
On April 27, 1921, the route was extended east to the Wellington–Halton boundary. Several days later, on May 4, the highway was extended further east to Hurontario Street in Brampton.
&quot;The Great Northern Highway&quot;, as it was known at the time, was numbered as Highway 7 during the summer of 1925.
Assumptions on June 22 and July 2, 1927 extended Highway 7 from Brampton to Peterborough. A portion of the original routing of Highway 12 between Sunderland and Lindsay was renumbered in this process and a concurrency established between Brooklin and Sunderland.

During the early 1930s, the DHO decided that Highway 7 would ultimately serve as the most direct route between Toronto and Ottawa; at that time the only option was via Highway 2 and Highway 16. The first step in this undertaking was to extend Highway 7 as far as Madoc along existing settler routes. This section was assumed on September 17, 1930.
On November 18, 1931, construction was accelerated between Madoc and Perth as a major depression-relief project when eight contracts were set to build the new route. Over 2700 men blasted rock, dredged muskeg and endured a constant barrage of blood-sucking insects in order to construct this new link. The majority of it followed along a Canadian Pacific right-of-way (now abandoned past the town of Havelock) which had been cleared in 1881, deviating at times to provide a better alignment, avoid large muskeg or to lessen excavation work, most of which was performed by hand.
On February 10 and February 17, the route, still incomplete, was surveyed and assumed as an extension of Highway 7. The new highway was opened to traffic on August 23, 1932.

Between the 1930s and 1960s, Highway 7 connected Sarnia with Perth; Highway 15 continued from Perth to Ottawa. By the mid-1950s, the well established highway network had changed travel characteristics, and the numbering of Highway 15 between Perth and Ottawa was confusing motorists. The Ottawa Board of Trade petitioned the Department of Highways to renumber several highways surrounding the city.
The department performed a series of renumberings similar to these recommendations following the extension of Highway 43 on September 8, 1961. Highway 15 was rerouted between Smiths Falls and Carleton Place to travel concurrently with Highway 29; Highway 7 was extended along the former routing from Perth to Carleton Place and signed concurrently with Highway 15 eastward to Ottawa. This brought the highway to its peak length of .

At an at-grade intersection with Highway 40 (Modeland Road, formerly Lucasville Road), Highway 7 transitioned into Highway 402, inaugurated in 1953, which continued westwards to the Bluewater Bridge at the American border. In 1957, the DHO announced that Highway 402 would be extended east of Sarnia to London, starting with the construction of an interchange at Modeland Road to replace the at-grade intersection in 1963-64, although Highway 402 would continue to default to Highway 7 for the near future as the rest of the extension was still being planned.
This interchange would serve as the terminus for a new bypass of Sarnia, as in 1980 a second overpass was built at this interchange during the twinning of Highway 40 to Wellington Street.

The extension of Highway 402 involved a new alignment east of Murphy Road to a new interchange with Highway 40, just north of the existing Highway 40 interchange with Highway 7, while Highway 7 would continue to a redirected Exmouth Street (causing a section of the latter to be bypassed and renamed as Old Exmouth Street). Highway 402 was completed between Sarnia and Highway 401 in 1982, and with traffic shifting to the newly completed freeway, this resulted in the redundancy of Highway 7 west of London. 

Nonetheless, Highway 7 remained provincially maintained until the segment west of Highway 4 was transferred to county jurisdiction on January 1, 1998; a process referred to as downloading. The former highway is now known as Lambton County Road 22 (London Line) and Middlesex County Road 7 (Elginfield Road).

=== Transfer of portions to lower governments (downloading) ===
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Ministry of Transportation (MTO) &quot;downloaded&quot; (i.e., transferred responsibility for) several sections of Highway 7 to regional and county governments. There are three separate issues that led to these downloads.

Due to budget cuts instituted by the Mike Harris government, many highways deemed to serve a local or regional function were downloaded to local jurisdiction. The sections of Highway 7 west of London were transferred to Lambton County and Middlesex County, largely supplanted by the completion of nearby Highway 402 in 1982. On April 1, 1997, the section from Sarnia to Thedford was transferred to Lambton County.
The section from Thedford to Elginfield was transferred to Lambton and Middlesex counties on January 1, 1998.

As the construction of Highway 407 progressed across the northern end of the Greater Toronto Area, the MTO transferred sections of Highway 7 to the regions of Peel and York. On June 7, 1997, the section between Highway 410 and Highway 404 was transferred to the regions of Peel and York; the section from Highway 404 to McCowan Road was transferred to York Region on April 1, 1999. Several months later, on September 1, a short section between McCowan Road and Markham Road was transferred. Finally, on January 25, 2007, the section between Markham Road and east of Donald Cousens Parkway, where the highway narrows to two lanes today, was transferred. Within Peel Region, Highway 410 and Highway 7 ran concurrently north–south between Bovaird Drive and Queen Street. The Queen St. portion of the route was numbered Peel Regional Road 21 on July 10, 1997, but renumbered as Peel Regional Road 107 on March 26, 1998. To make the former highway easier to follow through Brampton, the Bovaird Drive portion of the route was subsequently also numbered Regional Road 107, after the highway was transferred to the Region of Peel on November 28, 2001.
The non-Highway 7 portions of Queen Street and Bovaird Drive west and east of Highway 410 are designated as Regional Roads 6 and 10 respectively.

In the Peterborough area, Highway 7 was rerouted from travelling through the city to bypassing it along Highway 115. This situation took over six years to set in place. On April 1, 1997, the sections of Highway 7 entering the western edge of Peterborough along North Monaghan Parkway and Sir Sanford Fleming Drive were transferred to the county and city, creating a gap between Springville and the Peterborough Bypass. This situation was rectified on May 1, 2003, when the section of Highway 7A that until then was a continuation of the road south from Springville to Highway 115 was renumbered as Highway 7. The concurrency with Highway 115 was extended southwest to remove the discontinuity entirely.

=== Recent work ===
====York Region====
In 2005, Highway 7 was made the second main arterial for York Region&#x27;s Viva Rapid Transit service (after Yonge Street), leading to the expansion of the CN MacMillan Bridge and Highway 400 overpass.

====Carleton Place====
On August 22, 2006, work officially began on a project to expand Highway 7 between Ottawa and Carleton Place into a freeway through a process known as &quot;twinning&quot;,
in which a second carriageway is built parallel to an existing road and grade-separated interchanges constructed.
Plans for this expansion were first conceptualized in 1979 when a planning study was undertaken. However, budgetary constraints forced an early end to this study in 1981. In 1988, the project was reinstated. A study released that year recommended that Highway 7 be widened to five lanes with a centre turning lane south of Carleton Place as an interim measure; this was carried out in 1993. Full planning on the four-laning of the route began in 1993.

In mid-2005, the Government of Ontario announced the project to the public. The work was carried out over three contracts: from Highway 417 to Jinkinson Road, from Jinkinson Road to Ashton Station Road, and from Ashton Station Road to Highway 15. In July 2007, a C$45 million contract was awarded to R.W. Tomlinson for the first phase of the route west from Highway 417. Bot Construction was awarded the $73.2 million contract for the second phase, which included two interchanges, four overpasses and service roads, in early 2008. The first phase was opened to traffic on July 31, 2008 Towards the end of 2009, the $25.8 million contract for the third phase was awarded to Aecon. The second phase was completed ahead of schedule on December 3, 2008, bypassing south of the former route at Ashton Station Road and merging to two lanes west of Dwyer Hill Road. The third phase was completed in late 2011/early 2012, connecting to Carleton Place.

In early 2011, Ontario Infrastructure Minister Bob Chiarelli hinted at possible plans to extend the four-laning of Highway 7 west from Carleton Place to Perth.

==== Proposed Kitchener–Guelph freeway ====
On March 23, 2007, the Government of Ontario announced the approval of an Environmental Impact Assessment for a four-lane controlled-access highway between Kitchener, and Guelph, as traffic on Highway 401 is growing steadily and approaching capacity, along with the current two-lane alignment of Highway 7. This would connect to the Conestoga Parkway via an expansion of the existing Wellington Road half-cloverleaf interchange, with additional semi-directional flyover ramps above making it a four level interchange. The eastern end of the proposed Highway 7 freeway would terminate at, and interline with, the Hanlon Expressway (Highway 6), which is also scheduled for upgrades to a full freeway beginning in June 2015. Combined with plans to extend the Conestoga Parkway westward to Stratford, this would result in the Highway 7 route following a continuous freeway all the way to Guelph.

As one of the prerequisite projects, on the Conestoga Parkway the Victoria Street overpass was demolished overnight on February23–24, 2018, and was replaced with a new structure that reopened to traffic on October28; the new bridge is longer and has a higher elevation to accommodate the future ramps between the Kitchener-Guelph freeway and the Conestoga Parkway.

In July 2020, the Ford government announced that it would fund the highway project linking Guelph and Kitchener and building a new bridge for the highway over the Grand River. It is expected to cost 764 million dollars for the 18-kilometre freeway.

<text>In topology and related areas of mathematics, a subspace of a topological space &quot;X&quot; is a subset &quot;S&quot; of &quot;X&quot; which is equipped with a topology induced from that of &quot;X&quot; called the subspace topology (or the relative topology, or the induced topology, or the trace topology).

== Definition ==

Given a topological space formula_1 and a subset formula_2 of formula_3, the subspace topology on formula_2 is defined by
:formula_5
That is, a subset of formula_2 is open in the subspace topology if and only if it is the intersection of formula_2 with an open set in formula_1. If formula_2 is equipped with the subspace topology then it is a topological space in its own right, and is called a subspace of formula_1. Subsets of topological spaces are usually assumed to be equipped with the subspace topology unless otherwise stated.

Alternatively we can define the subspace topology for a subset formula_2 of formula_3 as the coarsest topology for which the inclusion map
:formula_13
is continuous.

More generally, suppose formula_14 is an injection from a set formula_2 to a topological space formula_3. Then the subspace topology on formula_2 is defined as the coarsest topology for which formula_14 is continuous. The open sets in this topology are precisely the ones of the form formula_19 for formula_20 open in formula_3. formula_2 is then homeomorphic to its image in formula_3 (also with the subspace topology) and formula_14 is called a topological embedding.

A subspace formula_2 is called an open subspace if the injection formula_14 is an open map, i.e., if the forward image of an open set of formula_2 is open in formula_3. Likewise it is called a closed subspace if the injection formula_14 is a closed map.

== Terminology ==

The distinction between a set and a topological space is often blurred notationally, for convenience, which can be a source of confusion when one first encounters these definitions. Thus, whenever formula_2 is a subset of formula_3, and formula_1 is a topological space, then the unadorned symbols &quot;formula_2&quot; and &quot;formula_3&quot; can often be used to refer both to formula_2 and formula_3 considered as two subsets of formula_3, and also to formula_38 and formula_39 as the topological spaces, related as discussed above. So phrases such as &quot;formula_2 an open subspace of formula_3&quot; are used to mean that formula_38 is an open subspace of formula_39, in the sense used above; that is: (i) formula_44; and (ii) formula_2 is considered to be endowed with the subspace topology.

== Examples ==
In the following, formula_46 represents the real numbers with their usual topology.
* The subspace topology of the natural numbers, as a subspace of formula_46, is the discrete topology.
* The rational numbers formula_48 considered as a subspace of formula_46 do not have the discrete topology ({0} for example is not an open set in formula_48 because there is no open subset of formula_46 whose intersection with formula_48 can result in &quot;only&quot; the singleton {0}). If &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are rational, then the intervals (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) and [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;] are respectively open and closed, but if &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are irrational, then the set of all rational &quot;x&quot; with &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;b&quot; is both open and closed.
* The set [0,1] as a subspace of formula_46 is both open and closed, whereas as a subset of formula_46 it is only closed.
* As a subspace of formula_46, [0, 1] ∪ [2, 3] is composed of two disjoint &quot;open&quot; subsets (which happen also to be closed), and is therefore a disconnected space.
* Let &quot;S&quot; = [0, 1) be a subspace of the real line formula_46. Then [0, ) is open in &quot;S&quot; but not in formula_46 (as for example the intersection between (-, ) and &quot;S&quot; results in [0, )). Likewise [, 1) is closed in &quot;S&quot; but not in formula_46 (as there is no open subset of formula_46 that can intersect with [0, 1) to result in [, 1)). &quot;S&quot; is both open and closed as a subset of itself but not as a subset of formula_46.

== Properties ==

The subspace topology has the following characteristic property. Let formula_61 be a subspace of formula_3 and let formula_63 be the inclusion map. Then for any topological space formula_64 a map formula_65 is continuous if and only if the composite map formula_66 is continuous. 

This property is characteristic in the sense that it can be used to define the subspace topology on formula_61.

We list some further properties of the subspace topology. In the following let formula_2 be a subspace of formula_3.

* If formula_70 is continuous then the restriction to formula_2 is continuous.
* If formula_70 is continuous then formula_73 is continuous.
* The closed sets in formula_2 are precisely the intersections of formula_2 with closed sets in formula_3.
* If formula_77 is a subspace of formula_2 then formula_77 is also a subspace of formula_3 with the same topology. In other words the subspace topology that formula_77 inherits from formula_2 is the same as the one it inherits from formula_3.
* Suppose formula_2 is an open subspace of formula_3 (so formula_86). Then a subset of formula_2 is open in formula_2 if and only if it is open in formula_3.
* Suppose formula_2 is a closed subspace of formula_3 (so formula_92). Then a subset of formula_2 is closed in formula_2 if and only if it is closed in formula_3.
* If formula_96 is a basis for formula_3 then formula_98 is a basis for formula_2.
* The topology induced on a subset of a metric space by restricting the metric to this subset coincides with subspace topology for this subset.

== Preservation of topological properties ==

If a topological space having some topological property implies its subspaces have that property, then we say the property is hereditary. If only closed subspaces must share the property we call it weakly hereditary.

* Every open and every closed subspace of a completely metrizable space is completely metrizable.
* Every open subspace of a Baire space is a Baire space.
* Every closed subspace of a compact space is compact.
* Being a Hausdorff space is hereditary.
* Being a normal space is weakly hereditary.
* Total boundedness is hereditary.
* Being totally disconnected is hereditary.
* First countability and second countability are hereditary.

<doc id="910930" wikidata="Q809518" url="?curid=910930" title="Bartolomeo Tromboncino">
<text>Bartolomeo Tromboncino (c. 1470 – 1535 or later) was an Italian composer of the middle Renaissance. He is mainly famous as a composer of &quot;frottole&quot;; he is principally infamous for murdering his wife. He was born in Verona and died in or near Venice.

==Life==
There is little information on his early life, as is common for most composers of the time. He mentions in a letter that he was originally from Verona, and it is most likely that he grew up in Mantua. Until around 1500 he lived and worked in Mantua, though he made occasional trips to adjacent cities such as Ferrara, Este, Vicenza, Milan, and Pavia, especially when he was in trouble. He fled Mantua in 1495 for unknown reasons, returning later that same year. In 1499 he murdered his wife when he discovered her &quot;in flagrante delicto&quot; but, unlike Gesualdo a hundred years later, he may have spared the man (the sources are contradictory on this detail). Curiously, he seems to have been pardoned again and again for his misdeeds, but he left Mantua again &quot;without permission, and for despicable reasons&quot;, as recorded in a letter from one of the Gonzaga family, his employers. His skill as a composer probably endeared him to Isabella d&#x27;Este, one of the great patrons of the arts of the time, and this connection may have assisted him in attaining pardons for his various murders and misdemeanors.

From 1502 Tromboncino was employed by the even more infamous Lucrezia Borgia in Ferrara, where he wrote music for the famous &quot;intermedi&quot; of her opulent court, and most significantly for her wedding to Alfonso d&#x27;Este. Sometime before 1521 he moved to Venice, where he most likely spent the remainder of his life, seemingly in rather more placid circumstances.

==Music and influence==
In spite of his stormy, erratic, and possibly criminal life, much of his music is in the light current form of the &quot;frottola,&quot; a predecessor to the madrigal. He was a trombonist, as shown by his name, and sometimes employed in that capacity; however he apparently wrote no strictly instrumental music (or none survives). He also wrote some serious sacred music: seventeen &quot;laude,&quot; a motet and a setting of the &quot;Lamentations of Jeremiah.&quot; Stylistically, the sacred works are typical of the more conservative music of the early 16th century, using non-imitative polyphony over a cantus firmus, alternating sectionally with more homophonic textures or with unadorned plainsong. His &quot;frottola&quot;s, by far the largest and most historically significant part of his output (176 in all) are more varied than those of the other famous frottolist, Marchetto Cara, and they also tend to be more polyphonic than is typical for most &quot;frottola&quot;s of the time; in this way they anticipate the madrigal, the first collections of which began to be published near the very end of Tromboncino&#x27;s life, and in the city where he lived (for example Verdelot&#x27;s &quot;Primo libro di Madrigali&quot; of 1533, published in Venice). The major differences between the late &quot;frottola&quot;s of Tromboncino and the earliest madrigals were not so much musical as in the structure of the verse they set.

The poetry that Tromboncino set tended to be by the most famous writers of the time; he set Petrarch, , Sannazaro, and others; he even set a poem by Michelangelo, &quot;Come haro dunque ardire,&quot; which was part of a collection Tromboncino published in 1518.

<doc id="910931" wikidata="Q125344" url="?curid=910931" title="Downe">
<text>Downe, formerly Down (), is a village in Greater London, England, located within the London Borough of Bromley, which formed part of the historical county of Kent until 1965, and is beyond London&#x27;s contiguous urban area. Charles Darwin lived in Down House for forty years until his death in 1882.

Downe is south west of Orpington and south east of Charing Cross. Downe lies on a low ridge (an outlier of the North Downs), and much of the centre of the village is unchanged; the former village school now acts as the village hall. 

The word Downe originates from the Anglo Saxon word &quot;dūn&quot;, latterly &quot;down&quot;, hence the South and North Downs. 

In April 1965, much of Orpington Urban District, including Downe, was transferred from the historic county of Kent and placed within the newly created London Borough of Bromley.

==Brief history==

Lord Simon de Manning, a former Lord of the Manor of nearby Kevington, then in Kent, and holder of the land which now includes Downe, was a grandson of Rudolph de Manning, Count Palatine, who married Elgida, aunt of King Harold I, of England; he was the royal Standard Bearer to King Richard the Lionheart, who carried the Royal Standard to Jerusalem in 1190, during the First Crusade. In England, the forms Earl Palatine and Palatine Earldom are preferred.

As well as Downe, Kevington Manor then included the areas which later became Berry&#x27;s Green, Luxted, Single Street, Westerham Hill, and Leaves Green. These (excluding Kevington), together formed the Darwin (ward), Greater London&#x27;s largest electoral ward), as it was first constituted in 1965. The current elected political party&#x27;s website (2022), states that the ward includes Cudham, Leaves Green, Leavesden Estate, Westerham Hill, Beechwood, Berry&#x27;s Green, and Pratts Bottom.

The spelling of the name of the village varied in the past, until the 1870s it was most commonly &quot;Down&quot;, then &quot;Downe’ became more usual.
In postal directories of the mid-19th century, it is named as Down. By 1882 Kelly&#x27;s Directory was using &quot;Downe&quot;.

==Darwin==
Charles Darwin lived in Down House for 40 years, from 1842 until he died there in 1882. Sir John Lubbock, 3rd Baronet, lived nearby at his High Elms estate on the other side of the village, and Darwin soon became a close friend and colleague of Lubbock&#x27;s son, who from 1865 was the 4th Baronet, and from 1901 1st Baron Avebury. A favourite place of Darwin&#x27;s was Downe Bank, now a nature reserve and Site of Special Scientific Interest together with High Elms Country Park, and several members of Darwin&#x27;s family are buried in the graveyard of St Mary&#x27;s Church.

Down House and the surrounding area has been nominated by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport to become a World Heritage Site. However, this decision has been deferred.

==Local politics==

Since 2019, the local Member of Parliament has been Gareth Bacon of the Conservative Party. In the 2017 General Election, with a majority of 19,453 votes (38.5%), Orpington was the safest Conservative Parliamentary seat in London.

One councillor is elected every four years to Bromley London Borough Council. To date, the Darwin ward has only been represented by representatives from the Conservative Party. It is the largest Greater London ward, and includes Berry&#x27;s Green, Single Street, Luxted, Leaves Green, Westerham Hill, and Cudham.








==Buckston Browne Farm==

Downe is the location of Buckston Browne Farm, built in 1931 as a surgical research centre by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS). In the 1980s, the farm caused controversy because of its use of vivisection techniques, and in August 1984 it was raided by anti-vivisection activists.

The farm has now been made into four houses.
==Scouting==
There are two scout campsites in the Downe area:

* The Downe Scout Activity Centre consisting of of woodland and open fields is just outside the village.
* The Greenwich (one of the Districts of the Greater London South Scout county) District campsite is also nearby.

==Transport==

The closest National Rail stations to Downe are at and , located 4.5 and 4.7 miles away respectively.

The village is served by London Buses routes 146 and R8 which provide connections to Bromley, Orpington and Biggin Hill.

<text>General John Campbell, 4th Duke of Argyll, KT, PC ( – 9 November 1770) was a Scottish military officer, Whig politician and peer who sat in the British House of Commons from 1713 to 1761.

==Early life==

John Campbell was born , the son of John Campbell of Mamore. His father was the second son of Archibald Campbell, 9th Earl of Argyll and his wife Elizabeth Elphinston, the daughter of John Elphinstone, 8th Lord Elphinstone.

==Marriage and children==
In 1720, Campbell secretly married Mary Drummond Bellenden, the daughter of John Drummond Bellenden, 2nd Lord Bellenden of Broughton. A maid of honour to Caroline of Ansbach, she was rumoured to have had an affair with the Prince of Wales. She had told the Prince that she would ask his blessing on any marriage but she broke this promise and married. She lost her position but John Campbell retained his position as a Groom of the Bedchamber. They moved to Coombe Bank. They had the following children:

* Lady Caroline Campbell (born 12 January 1721, died 17 January 1803)
* Field Marshal John Campbell, 5th Duke of Argyll (born June 1723, died 24 May 1806)
* Lord Frederick Campbell (born 20 June 1729, died 8 June 1816)
* Lord William Campbell (born 11 July 1730, died 1778)

His wife died in childbirth in 1736.

He acquired Coombe Bank, at Sundridge, near Sevenoaks Kent, where he commissioned Roger Morris to build a country house for him in the second quarter of the 18th century. The house subsequently passed on his death in 1770 to his second son Frederick.

==Military and parliamentary careers==
Campbell joined the army in 1710, becoming a Lieutenant Colonel at the age of nineteen. However, he soon entered the world of politics, and at the 1713 general election, he was returned unopposed as Member of Parliament (MP) for the alternating seat of Buteshire.

At the 1715 general election, Campbell stood at Elgin Burghs. He was defeated in the poll, in which two rival delegates were allowed to vote, and the chairman, who was the other candidate, used his casting vote in the resulting tie to return himself. Campbell was returned on petition as MP for the Boroughs on 7 April 1715. In the 1722 general election, much the same thing happened again with two rival delegates casting their votes. This time the petition was referred to committee and it took two years before Campbell was returned as MP on 23 January 1725. At the 1727 general election, Campbell succeeded his father as MP for Dunbartonshire, where he was returned unopposed in the general elections of 1734, 1741 and 1747. He was returned unopposed again for Dumbartonshire at the 1754 general election, and supported Newcastle&#x27;s administration and voted in its defence in the division on Minorca in 1757. He was nominated for governor of Dumbarton castle in 1759 but became involved in the Argyll-Bute family quarrel and was appointed governor of Limerick in compensation. He was returned again at the 1761 general election, but succeeded to the Dukedom two days later and had to vacate his seat in the House of Commons. During most of his tenure as MP for Dunbartonshire, he was Groom of the Bedchamber.

Additionally, Campbell served in the military during his tenure in Parliament—he became Colonel of the 39th Regiment of Foot (1737–1738) and the 21st Regiment of Foot (1738–1752), serving with honour in the Battle of Dettingen in 1743.

On 12 July 1746, Campbell was the questioner of Jacobite figure Flora MacDonald for her role in aiding Charles Edward Stuart to Skye, and produced a written document of Flora&#x27;s confessions.

He rose quickly up the ranks, becoming a brigadier general in 1743, major general in 1744, and lieutenant general in 1747; he became colonel of the North British Dragoons in 1752, a position he held until his death.

==Dukedom==
Upon inheriting the dukedom and other titles upon the death of his cousin Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll in 1761, he left the House of Commons and became Governor of Limerick and a Scottish representative peer. He became a Privy Councillor in 1762, a general in 1765, and a Knight of the Order of the Thistle in that same year.

==Death==
The Duke died on 9 November 1770 and is buried at Kilmun Parish Church. He was succeeded in the dukedom and other titles by his elder son John. His younger son Lord William Campbell was the last British Governor of South Carolina.

==Ancestry==
== In popular culture ==
In &quot;The Black Adder&quot;, the first series of historical sitcom &quot;Blackadder&quot;, the second episode, &quot;Born to Be King&quot;, has Alex Norton playing the Fourth Duke of Argyll, but this Duke is not John Campbell since the episode is set in 1487, 206 years before Campbell was born, and the Fourth Duke is called Dougal MacAngus.

<doc id="910944" wikidata="Q249525" url="?curid=910944" title="Lotteria">
<text>Lotteria (; Japanese: ロッテリア; stylized in all caps) is a South Korean-Japanese company that operates a chain of fast food restaurants in East Asia, having opened its first restaurant in Tokyo in September 1972. Taking its name from its parent company, Lotte Corporation, it currently has franchises in Japan (sold to Zensho Holdings), South Korea, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar. The origin of the name is a combination of corporate names Lotte and Cafeteria.

Its menu includes typical fast-food items such as burgers, french fries, fried chicken, chicken wings and chicken fingers.

==History==
The company was founded in February 1972 in Tokyo, Japan, by Shin Kyuk-ho, a Korean entrepreneur. Its first franchises opened in Nihonbashi, Ueno and Yokohama in September of that year. In 1979, the brand was established in Seoul, South Korea. Lotteria later spread throughout East Asia adding locations in China, Myanmar, Taiwan and Vietnam.

==Businesses by country==

===Japan===
In 2005, Genichi Tamatsuka, the former president of Fast Retailing Co. (which operates the Uniqlo brand), was appointed as chairman and CEO during a management restructuring in 2005. The appointment was the result of a previous contract undertaken by Revamp Corp, a business revitalization company.

On February 16, 2023, Lotteria of Japan was announced all shares of Lotteria would be sold to major Japanese fast food holding company Zensho on April 1, 2023.

===South Korea===

Lotteria South Korea was founded in 1979, as part of an expansion of the Lotte Group which also included Lotte Chilsung Beverages, Lotte Food and Lotte Ham. Lotteria became the number-one fast food restaurant chain in South Korea. The company achieved a 45% market share in 2001 (compared to 20.1 percent for McDonald&#x27;s). Lotteria&#x27;s success was achieved in part by introducing lines of Koreanized fast food including its now signature kimchi burger, leading to it being seen by most Koreans as a native version of most Western-style fast-food restaurants. The company tries to imitate the western idea of fast food through &quot;cleanliness, bright interior, Western pop music as an audio background,&quot; with the idea of trying to create &quot;the impression of a &#x27;small piece of America in the middle of Korea&#x27;&quot;. Their business strategy resulted in growth rates of 10 percent in 2006 and 16 percent in 2007; by 2009, Lotteria had 920 outlets across the country.

In March 2009, Lotteria took full control of the South Korean branch of T.G.I. Friday&#x27;s. It had previously invested 10 billion won in the chain in 2002. Lotteria also runs Natuur, one of South Korea&#x27;s major ice cream franchises, itself introduced to South Korea by Lotte in 1998.

Lotteria is also famous for shrimp burgers. In January 2021, the square shrimp double burger, which was released for a month for limited sales, announced that it would sell it as a regular product due to favorable responses.

===China===

Lotteria entered the Chinese market in 1994 and mainly centered in Beijing, but it ended operation in 2003 due to a lack of popularity among potential customers. In 2008, Lotteria restarted business in China with new operation strategies that specifically targeting Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region, other stores are located in cities like Beijing, Qingdao, Yantai and Shenyang.

===Vietnam===
The restaurant entered the Vietnamese market in 2004. They have a special menu that cannot be found in any other country, which is called &quot;rice and spaghetti&quot;.

===Indonesia===
The chain opened its first Indonesian franchise on 19 October 2011 at Lotte Mart Kelapa Gading, North Jakarta. As of 2015, the chain had 32 outlets in Greater Jakarta, Karawang and Bandung. All outlets in Indonesia were permanently closed on 29 June 2020.

===Cambodia===
The chain opened its first Cambodian franchise in June 2014 at Aeon Mall, followed by a second store in December 2014 at Soria Mall.

===Myanmar===

The first Lotteria restaurant in Myanmar was opened in Junction Square in Yangon in April 2013, with plans to open 24 more by 2016 from Yangon to Nay Pyi Taw. Along with the regular fare of chicken and burgers, Lotteria is offering dishes tailored to Myanmar consumers, such as chicken rice.

=== Singapore ===
Lotteria is slated to expand to Singapore by the second quarter of 2025.

==Other business strategies==

In 2003, Lotteria partnered with KT and Intel to provide Wi-Fi access in its restaurants, to help attract more customers. This service has also been available in every restaurant in Japan for NTT Docomo and au mobile users since 2006.

Lotteria has followed the global fast-food trend of shifting towards health-conscious foods and rebranding its image. In the face of health trends, it eliminated trans fats from its French fries. It also introduced healthier menu items, such as a rye bread burger that totals only 350 calories. From 2008, perhaps as a response to McDonald&#x27;s strategy to become more upmarket, Lotteria began a campaign to change &quot;the image of our stores to create a mood similar to a cafe, geared toward the health-conscious as well as female customers&quot;.

==Recycling in South Korea==

Since 2003, the South Korean government has required a 50-to-100 Won deposit to be levied against all disposable cups sold in restaurants to ensure that they were returned to be recycled. As such, products (such as drinks and ice cream) to be consumed in-store are served in reusable plastic containers; or if a customer purchases their product in a disposable cup and pays the deposit, they can have their deposit refunded if they return the empty cup to the counter staff. The recycling law yielded recycling rates for cups of 14 percent in 2003, 22 percent in 2004, and 25 percent in 2005. This law has since been repealed.

The Seoul city government requires mandatory garbage sorting with food, recyclables and general trash to be separated from each other. Specialized receptacles thus exist (for liquids, paper, uneaten food, plastic, and other general waste) at all Lotteria restaurants. In addition, Lotteria also charges a fee of 50-to-100 Won on bags as is the norm for most Western-style stores and other shopping venues in South Korea.

In 2021, Lotteria announced the introduction of drinking lids instead of straws to reduce the use of plastic straws at 100 direct stores.

<doc id="910950" wikidata="Q2074443" url="?curid=910950" title="Lev Pulver">
<text>Lev Mikhailovich Pulver (Yiddish pronunciation: Leib Pulver, , European spelling: Leo Pulver, ; 18 December 1883, Verkhnodniprovsk – 18 March 1970, Moscow), was a Soviet and Russian-Jewish composer and musician.

== Early life ==
He was an offspring of a renowned klezmorim&#x27;s family.

Pulver studied violin since early childhood, at first with his father; later on, he studied with his brother-in-law, a disciple of Czech violinist Otakar Ševčík. Pulver graduated from Saint Petersburg Conservatory, where he studied violin and composition under Anatoly Lyadov.

Initially, he was a violinist and composer in a wandering Ukrainian theatre group. Later on, he was a symphonic concert-master and conductor, a founding member of the Stradivari Quartet. He was the musical director of the State Jewish Theatre in Moscow (the GOSET).

== Compositions ==
Pulver composed incidental music for works including Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;; Sholem Aleichem&#x27;s &quot;200.000&quot; and &quot;The Man of the Air&quot;; &quot;Adventures of Benjamin the Third&quot; after Mendele Mocher Sforim; Abraham Goldfaden&#x27;s &quot;The Sorceress&quot; (in collaboration with Joseph Achron); and Zalman Shneyer&#x27;s &quot;Freylekhs&quot; (in collaboration with Maximilian Steinberg). He also composed operettas (&quot;Gulliver&quot;, &quot;Inside the Big Top&quot;, &quot;What is her name?&quot;), movie scores, songs, and Yiddish folk-song arrangements. Some of his tunes have been considered as Jewish folklore. He was one of the important musicians bridging the traditional Eastern European Jewish music with the Western classical music forms.

== Artists about Lev Pulver ==
L.M. Pulver has a sophisticated sense of incidental music&#x27;s essence./ ... /.Pulver is especially aware of those moments in scenic plots when a direct calling for the music to sound is there. Moreover, this is not surprising: he started playing since nine years of age as a wandering weddings-musician. Thereafter, while being an already accomplished musician, he went on with playing in theaters, first at the orchestra of the Ukrainian Opera, then at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow. His theatrical experience left a lasting impression on all of his works. His music is effectively theatrical. /Solomon Mikhoels/

... (My) father started a job at Mikhoels&#x27; Jewish Theatre .That theatre might have been considered as a musical one. In charge of the orchestra and of all the musical life (there) was an energetic gifted man – Lev Pulver. All of the music was written by him, and he conducted as well. Their productions reminded of the today&#x27;s musicals. /Kirill Kondrashin/

== Recordings ==
A few recordings of his music are available featuring the performances of the GOSET orchestra with Solomon Mikhoels and Benjamin Zuskin, as well as by singers Solomon Khromchenko, Mikhail Alexandrovich, Nechama Lifshitz, Marina Gordon and actors Emil Gorovets and Boris Landau.

<doc id="910967" wikidata="Q1364826" url="?curid=910967" title="Joint entropy">
<text>In information theory, joint [[entropy (information theory)|entropy]] is a measure of the uncertainty associated with a set of variables.

==Definition==
The joint Shannon entropy (in bits) of two discrete random variables formula_1 and formula_2 with images formula_3 and formula_4 is defined as

where formula_5 and formula_6 are particular values of formula_1 and formula_2, respectively, formula_9 is the joint probability of these values occurring together, and formula_10 is defined to be 0 if formula_11.

For more than two random variables formula_12 this expands to

where formula_13 are particular values of formula_14, respectively, formula_15 is the probability of these values occurring together, and formula_16 is defined to be 0 if formula_17.

==Properties==

===Nonnegativity===

The joint entropy of a set of random variables is a nonnegative number.

:formula_18

:formula_19

===Greater than individual entropies===

The joint entropy of a set of variables is greater than or equal to the maximum of all of the individual entropies of the variables in the set.

:formula_20

:formula_21

===Less than or equal to the sum of individual entropies===

The joint entropy of a set of variables is less than or equal to the sum of the individual entropies of the variables in the set. This is an example of subadditivity. This inequality is an equality if and only if formula_1 and formula_2 are statistically independent.

:formula_24

:formula_25

==Relations to other entropy measures==

Joint entropy is used in the definition of conditional entropy

:formula_26,

and

:formula_27.

It is also used in the definition of mutual information

:formula_28.

In quantum information theory, the joint entropy is generalized into the joint quantum entropy.

==Joint differential entropy==
===Definition===
The above definition is for discrete random variables and just as valid in the case of continuous random variables. The continuous version of discrete joint entropy is called &quot;joint differential (or continuous) entropy&quot;. Let formula_1 and formula_2 be a continuous random variables with a joint probability density function formula_31. The differential joint entropy formula_32 is defined as

For more than two continuous random variables formula_12 the definition is generalized to:

The integral is taken over the support of formula_34. It is possible that the integral does not exist in which case we say that the differential entropy is not defined.

===Properties===
As in the discrete case the joint differential entropy of a set of random variables is smaller or equal than the sum of the entropies of the individual random variables:
:formula_35

The following chain rule holds for two random variables:
:formula_36
In the case of more than two random variables this generalizes to:
:formula_37
Joint differential entropy is also used in the definition of the mutual information between continuous random variables:
:formula_38

<doc id="910969" wikidata="Q313126" url="?curid=910969" title="Nectanebo II">
<text>Nectanebo II (Egyptian: ; ) was the last native ruler of ancient Egypt, as well as the third and last pharaoh of the Thirtieth Dynasty, reigning from 358 to c.340 BC.

During the reign of Nectanebo II, Egyptian artists developed a specific style that left a distinctive mark on the reliefs of the Ptolemaic Kingdom. Like his indirect predecessor Nectanebo I, Nectanebo II showed enthusiasm for many of the cults of the gods within ancient Egyptian religion, and more than a hundred Egyptian sites bear evidence of his attention.

For several years, Nectanebo II was successful in keeping Egypt safe from the Achaemenid Empire. However, he was betrayed by his former servant, Mentor of Rhodes, and ultimately defeated. The Persians occupied Memphis and then seized the rest of Egypt, incorporating the country into the Achaemenid Empire under Artaxerxes III. Nectanebo fled south. His subsequent fate is unknown.

==Name==
&quot;Nectanebo&quot; is derived from the Greek form of his name, (, or in later sources). His Egyptian name was &quot;Nḫt-Ḥr-Ḥbt&quot;, which means &quot;victorious is Horus of Hebyt&quot;. Although convention in English assigns identical names to him and his grandfather, Nectanebo I, the latter was in fact called ().

Medieval Arab authors referred to him as &quot;Naqatanibas&quot; ().

==Rise to power==

In 525 BC, Egypt was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. Because of internal struggles for the Persian imperial succession, Egypt managed to regain independence in 404 BC. In 389 BC, Pharaoh Hakor negotiated a treaty with Athens and for three years (from 385 to 383 BC) managed to withstand Persian aggression. However, following the conclusion of the Peace of Antalcidas in 387 BC between the Achaemenids and the Greek city-states, Egypt and Cyprus became the only obstacles to Persian hegemony in the Mediterranean.

At the beginning of 360 BC, Nectanebo&#x27;s predecessor, Teos, started preparations for war against intruders. In the same year, the Egyptian army set off, traveling along the coast by land and sea. Nectanebo II accompanied his uncle Teos in that campaign and was in charge of the &quot;machimoi&quot;.

In an attempt to quickly raise finances for the war, Teos imposed taxes on Egyptians and seized temple property. Egyptians, particularly the priests, resented these measures but supported Nectanebo II. Teos asked Spartan military leader Agesilaus and Athenian general Chabrias to support him. Agesilaus, however, said he was sent to aid Egypt and not to wage war against it. Chabrias returned home with his mercenaries. Teos decided to flee to the Achaemenid court, where he ultimately died of natural causes.

Nectanebo contended with an unnamed pretender to the throne from the town of Mendes, who proclaimed himself pharaoh. The revolt was probably led by one of the descendants of Nepherites I, whose family had ruled the town before. The claimant sent messengers to Agesilaus in an attempt to persuade Agesilaus to his side. Agesilaus remained loyal to Nectanebo, fearing to become a turncoat. At one of the towns in the Nile Delta, the troops of Nectanebo and Agesilaus were besieged by the usurper, who had gained many sympathisers. Despite the enemy&#x27;s numerical superiority, Nectanebo and Agesilaus were victorious and the revolt was put down in the fall of 360 BC.

==Reign==
Religion played an important part in Nectanebo&#x27;s domestic policy. He began his reign by officiating over the funeral of an Apis bull in Memphis. There, Nectanebo added a relief decoration to the eastern and western temples of Apis. Among notable sanctuaries erected under Nectanebo II are a temple of Khnum in Abu and a temple of Amun at Sekhtam. He also dedicated a diorite &quot;naos&quot; to Anhur-Shu (a fragment of it was found in the temples of Tjebnutjer). Nectanebo II was responsible for the increasing popularity of the Buchis cult. Under Nectanebo II a decree forbidding stone quarrying in the so-called &quot;Mysterious Mountains&quot; in Abydos was issued.

Foreign affairs under Nectanebo II were thwarted by repeated Achaemenid attempts to reconquer Egypt. Before the accession of Nectanebo II to the throne, the Persians attempted to reclaim Egypt in 385, 383, and 373 BC. Nectanebo used the peace to build up a new army and employed Greek mercenaries, which was a common practice at the time. In about 351 BC, the Achaemenid Empire embarked on a new attempt to reclaim Egypt. After a year of fighting, Nectanebo and his allied generals, and Lamius of Sparta, managed to defeat the Achaemenids. Having scored a resounding victory, Nectanebo II was acclaimed &quot;Nectanebo the divine falcon&quot; by his people, and cults were set up in his name.In 345/44 BC, Nectanebo supported the Phoenician rebellion against the Achaemenid Empire, led by the king of Sidon, Tennes, and dispatched military aid in the form of 4,000 Greek mercenaries, led by Mentor of Rhodes. However, having heard of the approach of the forces of Artaxerxes III, Mentor opened communication with the Persians in collusion with Tennes.
At the end of 344 BC, ambassadors of Artaxerxes III arrived in Greece, asking for the Greeks&#x27; participation in a campaign against Egypt. Athens and Sparta treated the ambassadors with courtesy, but refrained from committing to an alliance against Egypt. Other cities, however, decided to support the Persians: Thebes sent 1,000 hoplites and Argos 3,000.

In the winter of 343 BC, Artaxerxes set off for Egypt. The Egyptian army, headed by Nectanebo, consisted of 60,000 Egyptians, 20,000 Libu, and as many Greek mercenaries. In addition, Nectanebo had a number of flat-bottomed boats intended to prevent an enemy from entering the Nile mouths. The vulnerable points along his Mediterranean sea border and east boundary were protected by strongholds, fortifications and entrenched camps. Persian forces were strengthened by Mentor and his men, well acquainted with the eastern border of Egypt, and by 6,000 Ionians.

Nectanebo II was ultimately defeated and, in the summer of 342 BC, Artaxerxes entered Memphis and installed a satrap. Nectanebo fled to Upper Egypt and finally to Nubia, where he was granted asylum. He, however, preserved a degree of power there for some time. With the help of Khabash, Nectanebo made a vain attempt to regain the throne.
== Archaeological evidence ==

=== Building campaigns ===
Though placed in an unfortunate period of Egyptian history, and with his legacy perhaps marred by being the last pharaoh to rule an independent Egypt, Nectanebo was an extensive builder, likely on a scale that would equal many kings of the glory days of the New Kingdom. References to either Nectanebo II or his grandfather have been found almost ubiquitously at the premier religious centres, and the piety of the two kings matched those of the great kings of the past, attested to by the numerous monuments across Egypt bearing their names. Nectanebo II, specifically, built and improved temples across the country, and he donated extensively to the priesthoods of the plethora of sites which he donated to. Nectanebo&#x27;s name has been found at Heliopolis, Athribis, and Bubastis in the Nile Delta, among other places, but he built most extensively at Sebennytos, including the modern site of Behbeit El Hagar. The reliefs of the temples at Sebennytos would leave a distinct mark on the art of the later Ptolemaic Kingdom. The religious focus of his building campaigns, however, may not be solely due to sheer piety; because Nectanebo was an usurper, he likely sought to legitimise his rule over Egypt religiously.

=== Portraits ===
Except for the small-scale greywacke statue in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, which shows Nectanebo II standing before the image of Horus, no other annotated portraits of Nectanebo II are known. In the greywacke statue, Nectanebo II is shown in a &quot;nemes&quot; and &quot;uraeus.&quot; His bent arm with the sword stands for the hieroglyph &quot;nakht&quot;, the falcon represents Horus, while the hieroglyph in Nectanebo&#x27;s right hand stands for &quot;heb&quot;. Other portraits attributed to Nectanebo II (all featuring the &quot;khepresh&quot;) include a quartzite head in the museum of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, a basalt head in Alexandria, a granite head acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and a damaged quartzite head.

==Legacy==

=== Sarcophagus ===

In 1798, Napoleon captured the Egyptian city of Alexandria. Soon after, following the Battle of Alexandria in 1801, Napoleon&#x27;s forces surrendered to the British, and conditionally turned over antiquities they had gathered from the ancient city. Notably, among these was the Rosetta Stone, as well as a seven ton sarcophagus, covered in hieroglyphics. Soon after the British secured these, they were approached by locals who believed that this was the tomb of Alexander the Great. Thereafter, the sarcophagus was taken to London, where it still resides at the British Museum.

For a time, the sarcophagus was believed to have belonged to Alexander. However, after the translation of the Rosetta Stone, the writings on the sarcophagus were deciphered, and it became clear the tomb was not fashioned for him. The hieroglyphics on the tomb were sections from the Book of What is in the Underworld, and contained the cartouche of Nectanebo II. The tomb was likely created for Nectanebo, before going unused as he was overthrown and fled to Nubia.
It has been argued that the sarcophagus did indeed house the remains of Alexander the Great. Alexander the Great&#x27;s body was temporarily entombed in Memphis following his death in 323 BC, and Saqqara is a suspected location of his temporary Memphite tomb. Nectanebo had erected a temple there, where he may have intended to be laid to rest. It is possible the tomb was vacant in Memphis at the same time Alexander&#x27;s body was placed there. When Alexander&#x27;s remains were moved to Alexandria in 280 BC, it may have been moved along with the sarcophagus. In an article in the Egyptology journal &quot;Kmt&quot; (fall 2020), Andrew Chugg showed that a 3rd century BC fragment of a high status Macedonian tomb found embedded in the foundations of St Mark&#x27;s Basilica in Venice in 1960 (which was believed to have been brought over from Alexandria along with the relics of St. Mark in 828 AD) is an exact fit as part of a tomb-casing for the sarcophagus, sparking renewed claims that the sarcophagus once held Alexander&#x27;s remains.

At the Attarine Mosque, where it was found by Napoleon&#x27;s men, holes had been drilled in the sarcophagus. It had been used as a ritual bath when Alexandria was under Islamic rule.

===Nectanebo and the Alexander Romance===

There is an apocryphal tale appearing in the pseudo-historical &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; that details another end for the last native pharaoh. Soon after Alexander the Great&#x27;s godhood was confirmed by the Libyan Sibyl of Zeus Ammon at the Siwa Oasis, a rumor was begun that Nectanebo II, following defeat in his last battle, did not travel to Nubia but instead to the court of Philip II of Macedon in the guise of an Egyptian magician. There, while Philip was away on campaign, Nectanebo convinced Philip&#x27;s wife Olympias that Amun was to come to her and that they would father a son. Nectanebo, disguising himself as Amun, slept with Olympias and from this event came Alexander.

This myth would hold strong appeal for the Egyptians, who desired continuity and harbored a strong dislike for foreign rule. In art of this event, Nectanebo is usually depicted as having dragon-like features, for example in the &quot;Speculum Historiale&quot;.

In the early Ptolemaic tale of Nectanebo and Petesis, preserved only in a Greek fragment from the Serapeum of Saqqara, the pharaoh has a prophetic dream of Isis in which the god Onuris is angry with him because of his unfinished temple in Sebennytos. Nectanebo calls in the best sculptor of the realm, Petesis, to finish the job, but he bungles his assignment when he gets drunk and chases a beautiful girl instead. The narrative ends abruptly here, but this is probably the preface to the fall of Egypt. Al-Biruni&#x27;s &quot;A History of India&quot; reproduces the story.
The legend of Nectanebo (or Nectanebus, or Natanabo, as reported in some versions of the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot;) left a profound mark on European culture up to the Renaissance and beyond. It is no coincidence that this character is included in the Sola Busca tarot (with the name Natanabo) together with other important &quot;actors&quot; of the same legend: Alexander, Philip of Macedon, Olympias and Ammon. An alchemical interpretation of this character was provided by the Italian scholar Sofia Di Vincenzo in a study on the Sola Busca Tarot, where she explains that Natanabo represents a celestial messenger who came to earth with a gift, the helmet, which is a symbol of invulnerability and both physical and mental potency.

<text>The Tennessee Central Railway Museum (TCRM, reporting mark TCRX) is a railroad museum located in Nashville, Tennessee.

It is a small non-profit facility which is preserving the heritage of rail transport in Tennessee and the central South. The museum&#x27;s name honors the former Tennessee Central Railway.

The museum maintains a collection of historic rolling stock which it restores and uses for rail excursions in the area, both for fundraising and educational purposes.

It runs an all-volunteer heritage railroad dedicated to preserving, restoring, interpreting, and operating historic railroad equipment. TCRM currently has nine diesel-electric locomotives and thirty other cars/engines.

Inside the freight depot where the museum is located, there are railroad artifacts and memorabilia, a gift shop, and a large room where model train layouts in HO and N scale are displayed.

<doc id="910990" wikidata="Q6952864" url="?curid=910990" title="NBS 24/7">
<text>NBS 24/7 is a television program produced by Kestrel Communications on Speed Channel. Every Monday, the show profiled some of the crews and drivers of NASCAR&#x27;s Busch Series. Each 30-minute episode gave a look, not just at those profiled during races, but behind-the-scenes as well. Two of the many drivers looked at on the show include Casey Atwood and David Stremme. The show premiered in February 2004, and was a replacement for the failed &quot;Inside NBS&quot;, which was cancelled after just one season.

== Seasons ==
Season 1: Featured teams were FitzBradshaw Racing, Braun Racing, and Akins Motorsports (as well as their drivers, including Tim Fedewa, Kasey Kahne, David Stremme, and Casey Atwood).

Season 2: The teams remained the same, however Fedewa, Atwood, and Kahne were not featured. Stremme moved from FBR to Braun after previous driver Shane Hmiel&#x27;s ban from the sport. Jason Leffler, A. J. Foyt IV, and Joel Kauffman were part of the show in the latter part of season 2.

Season 3: Attempting to capitalize on the rookie hype for the 2006 season, &quot;NBS 24/7&quot; changed its name to &quot;NBS 24/7: The Rookies&quot;, again traveled with FitzBradshaw Racing and Akins Motorsports, but this time covered their rookies, Kauffman and Foyt. The show also looked at the other 2006 Busch ROTY contenders (including Danny O&#x27;Quinn Jr., Todd Kluever, and Burney Lamar).

On June 19, 2006, the show aired its final episode.

<doc id="910996" wikidata="Q269265" url="?curid=910996" title="Pepi I Meryre">
<text>Pepi I Meryre (also Pepy I; died 2283 BC) was an ancient Egyptian king, third king of the Sixth Dynasty of Egypt, who ruled for over 40 years from the 24th to the 23rd century BC, toward the end of the Old Kingdom period. He was the son of Teti, the founder of the dynasty, and ascended the throne only after the brief intervening reign of the shadowy Userkare. His mother was Iput, who may have been a daughter of Unas, the final ruler of the preceding Fifth Dynasty. Pepi I, who had at least six consorts, was succeeded by his son Merenre Nemtyemsaf I, with whom he may have shared power in a coregency at the very end of his reign. Pepi II Neferkare, who might also have been Pepi I&#x27;s son, succeeded Merenre.

Several difficulties accumulated during Pepi&#x27;s reign, beginning with the possible murder of his father and the ensuing reign of Userkare. Later, probably after his twentieth year of reign, Pepi faced a harem conspiracy hatched by one of his consorts who may have tried to have her son designated heir to the throne, and possibly another conspiracy involving his vizier at the end of his reign. Confronted with the protracted decline of pharaonic power and the emergence of dynasties of local officials, Pepi reacted with a vast architectural program involving the construction of temples dedicated to local gods and numerous chapels for his own cult throughout Egypt, reinforcing his presence in the provinces. Egypt&#x27;s prosperity allowed Pepi to become the most prolific builder of the Old Kingdom. At the same time, Pepi favored the rise of small provincial centres and recruited officials of non-noble extraction to curtail the influence of powerful local families. Continuing Teti&#x27;s policy, Pepi expanded a network of warehouses accessible to royal envoys and from which taxes and labor could easily be collected. Finally, he buttressed his power after the harem conspiracy by forming alliances with Khui, the provincial nomarch of Abydos, marrying two of his daughters, Ankhesenpepi I and Ankhesenpepi II, and making both Khui&#x27;s wife Nebet and her son Djau viziers. The Egyptian state&#x27;s external policy under Pepi comprised military campaigns against Nubia, Sinai and the southern Levant, landing troops on the Levantine coast using Egyptian transport boats. Trade with Byblos, Ebla and the oases of the Western Desert flourished, while Pepi launched mining and quarrying expeditions to Sinai and further afield.

Pepi had a pyramid complex built for his funerary cult in Saqqara, next to which he built at least a further six pyramids for his consorts. Pepi&#x27;s pyramid, which originally stood tall, and an accompanying high temple, followed the standard layout inherited from the late Fifth Dynasty. The most extensive corpus of Pyramid Texts from the Old Kingdom cover the walls of Pepi I&#x27;s burial chamber, antechamber and much of the corridor leading to it. For the first time, these texts also appear in some of the consorts&#x27; pyramids. Excavations revealed a bundle of viscera and a mummy fragment, both presumed to belong to the pharaoh. Pepi&#x27;s complex, called &quot;Pepi Mennefer&quot;, remained the focus of his funerary cult well into the Middle Kingdom and ultimately gave its name to the nearby capital of Egypt, Memphis. Pepi&#x27;s cult stopped early in the Second Intermediate Period. Pepi&#x27;s monuments began to be quarried for their stone in the New Kingdom, and in the Mamluk era they were almost entirely dismantled.

==Family==
===Parents===
Pepi was the son of the king Teti and queen consort Iput. Her parentage is directly attested to by a relief on a decree uncovered in Coptos that mentions Iput as Pepi&#x27;s mother, by inscriptions in her mortuary temple mentioning her titles as mother of a king and as mother of Pepi, by the architecture of her tomb which had been changed from an original mastaba form into a pyramid on the accession of her son to the throne,
and by her mention as being Pepi&#x27;s mother on the Sixth Dynasty royal annals. Iput may have been a daughter of Unas, the last pharaoh of the Fifth Dynasty, although this remains uncertain and debated. She seems to have died before Pepi&#x27;s accession to the throne. The observation that Teti was most probably Pepi&#x27;s father follows from the location of Iput&#x27;s tomb, next to Teti&#x27;s pyramid as was customary for a queen consort.

===Consorts===

Egyptologists have identified six consorts of Pepi I with near certainty.
Pepi&#x27;s best-attested consorts were Ankhesenpepi I and Ankhesenpepi II, who both bore future kings and were daughters of the nomarch of Abydos Khui and his wife Nebet. Further consorts are Nubwenet, Inenek-Inti, who became one of Pepi&#x27;s viziers, and Mehaa (also called Haaheru). All were buried in pyramids adjacent to that of Pepi. Relief fragments from the necropolis surrounding Pepi&#x27;s pyramid mention another consort, Sebwetet.

Two more consorts have been proposed for Pepi I based on partial evidence. The first is Nedjeftet, whose name is recorded on blocks excavated in the necropolis adjacent to Pepi&#x27;s pyramid. The identification of Nedjeftet as Pepi&#x27;s consort remains uncertain owing to the lack of inscriptions explicitly naming her husband. Given the location of Nedjeftet&#x27;s blocks in the necropolis, she may be the owner of a pyramid west of Pepi&#x27;s. The second is another consort, named Behenu, who was buried in the second largest queen pyramid of Pepi&#x27;s necropolis, north of his. She could either be one of his consorts or a consort of Pepi II.

A final unnamed consort, only referred to by her title &quot;Weret-Yamtes&quot; meaning &quot;great of affection&quot;, is known from inscriptions uncovered in the tomb of Weni, an official serving Pepi. This consort, whose name is purposefully left unmentioned by Weni, conspired against Pepi and was prosecuted when the conspiracy was discovered.

===Children===
Pepi fathered at least four sons. Ankhesenpepi I probably bore him the future pharaoh Merenre Nemtyemsaf I. Ankhesenpepi II was the mother of Pepi II Neferkare, who was probably born at the very end of Pepi I&#x27;s reign given he was only six upon ascending the throne after Merenre&#x27;s rule. While a majority of Egyptologists favor this hypothesis, an alternative one holds that Pepi II could be a son of Merenre.
Another of Pepi I&#x27;s sons was Teti-ankh, meaning &quot;Teti lives&quot;, whose mother has yet to be identified. Teti-ankh is known only from an ink inscription bearing his name discovered in Pepi&#x27;s pyramid. Buried nearby is Prince Hornetjerkhet, a son of Pepi with Mehaa.

At least three of Pepi I&#x27;s daughters have been tentatively identified, all future consorts of Pepi II. The first, Meritites IV, was the king&#x27;s eldest daughter and was buried in the necropolis surrounding her father&#x27;s pyramid. The second is Neith, whom he fathered with Ankhesenpepi I. She may have been the mother of Pepi II&#x27;s successor Merenre Nemtyemsaf II. The third is Iput II, whose identity as Pepi&#x27;s daughter remains uncertain because her title of &quot;daughter of the king&quot; may only be honorary.

==Chronology==
=== Relative chronology ===

The relative chronology of Pepi I&#x27;s reign is well established by historical records, contemporary artifacts and archeological evidence, which agree he succeeded Userkare and was succeeded by Merenre I Nemtyemsaf. For example, the near-contemporary South Saqqara Stone, a royal annal inscribed during the reign of Pepi II, gives the succession &quot;Teti → Userkare → Pepi I → Merenre I&quot;, making Pepi the third king of the Sixth Dynasty. Two more historical sources agree with this chronology: the Abydos king list, written under Seti I which places Pepi I&#x27;s cartouche as the 36th entry between those of Userkare and Merenre, and the Turin canon, a list of kings on papyrus dating to the reign of Ramses II which records Pepi I in the fourth column, third row.

Historical sources against this order of succession include the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; (), a history of Egypt written in the 3rd century BC during the reign of Ptolemy II (283 – 246 BC) by Manetho. No copies of the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; have survived, and it is now known only through later writings by Sextus Julius Africanus and Eusebius. According to the Byzantine scholar George Syncellus, Africanus wrote that the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; mentioned the succession &quot;Othoês → Phius → Methusuphis&quot; at the start of the Sixth Dynasty. Othoês, Phius (in Greek, φιός), and Methusuphis are understood to be the Hellenized forms for Teti, Pepi I and Merenre, respectively, meaning that the &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot; omits Userkare. Manetho&#x27;s reconstruction of the early Sixth Dynasty agrees with the Karnak king list written under Thutmosis III. This list places Pepi&#x27;s birth name immediately after that of Teti in the seventh entry of the second row. Unlike other sources such as the Turin canon, the purpose of the Karnak king list was not to be exhaustive, but rather to list a selection of royal ancestors to be honoured. Similarly the Saqqara Tablet, written under Ramses II, omits Userkare, with Pepi&#x27;s name given as the 25th entry after that of Teti.

===Length of reign===

The length of Pepi I&#x27;s reign remains somewhat uncertain, although as of 2021, the consensus is that he ruled over Egypt for over 40 years, possibly 49 or 50 years and possibly longer.

During the Old Kingdom period, the Egyptians counted years from the beginning of the reign of the current king. These years were referred to by the number of cattle counts which had taken place since the reign&#x27;s start. The cattle count was an important event aimed at evaluating the amount of taxes to be levied on the population. This involved counting cattle, oxen and small livestock. During the early Sixth Dynasty, this count was probably , occurring every two years.

The South Saqqara Stone and an inscription in Hatnub both record the 25th cattle count under Pepi I, his highest known date. Accepting a biennial count, this indicates that Pepi reigned for 49 years. That a 50th year of reign could have also been recorded on the royal annal cannot be discounted, however, because of the damaged state of the South Saqqara Stone. Another historical source supporting such a long reign is Africanus&#x27; epitome of Manetho&#x27;s &quot;Aegyptiaca&quot;, which credits Pepi I with a reign of 53 years.

Archaeological evidence in favor of a long reign for Pepi I includes his numerous building projects and many surviving objects made in celebration of his first Sed festival, which was meant to rejuvenate the king and was first celebrated on the 30th year of a king&#x27;s rule. For example, numerous alabaster ointment vessels celebrating Pepi&#x27;s first Sed festival have been discovered. They bear a standard inscriptions reading, &quot;The king of Upper and Lower Egypt Meryre, may he be given life for ever. The first occasion of the Sed festival.&quot; Examples can now be found in museums throughout the world:

The Sed festival had a considerable importance for Old Kingdom kings. Representations of it were part of the typical decoration of temples associated with the ruler during the Old Kingdom, whether the king had actually celebrated it or not. As further evidence of the importance of this event in Pepi&#x27;s case, the state administration seems to have had a tendency to mention his first jubilee repeatedly in the years following its celebration until the end of his rule in connection with building activities. For example, Pepi&#x27;s final 25th cattle count reported on the Sixth Dynasty royal annals is associated with his first Sed festival even though it probably had taken place some 19 years prior.

==Politics==

=== Ascending the throne ===

Pepi&#x27;s accession to the throne may have occurred in times of discord. Manetho, writing nearly 2,000 years after Pepi&#x27;s reign, claims that Pepi&#x27;s father Teti was assassinated by his own bodyguards. The Egyptologist Naguib Kanawati has argued in support of Manetho&#x27;s claim, noting for example that Teti&#x27;s reign saw a significant increase in the number of guards at the Egyptian court, who became responsible for the everyday care of the king. At the same time, the figures and names of several contemporary palace officials as represented in their tombs have been erased purposefully. This seems to be an attempt at a &quot;damnatio memoriae&quot; targeting three men in particular: the vizier Hezi, the overseer of weapons Mereri and chief physician Seankhuiptah. These men could therefore be behind the regicide.

Pepi may have been too young to be king. In any case, he did not immediately succeed his father. King Userkare succeeded him instead, but Userkare&#x27;s identity and relationship to the royal family remain uncertain. It is possible Userkare served only as a regent with Pepi&#x27;s mother Iput as Pepi reached adulthood, occupying the throne in the interregnum until Pepi&#x27;s coming of age. The apparent lack of resistance to Pepi&#x27;s eventual accession supports such hypotheses.

Against this view, however, Kanawati has argued that Userkare&#x27;s short reign—lasting perhaps only one year—cannot be a regency as a regent would not have assumed a full royal titulary as Userkare did, nor would he be included in king lists. Rather, Userkare could have been an usurper and a descendant of a lateral branch of the Fifth Dynasty royal family who seized power briefly in a coup, possibly with the support of the priesthood of the sun god Ra. This hypothesis finds indirect evidence in Userkare&#x27;s theophoric name which incorporates the name of Ra, a naming fashion common during the preceding Fifth Dynasty that had fallen out of use since Unas&#x27;s reign. Further archeological evidence of Userkare&#x27;s illegitimacy in the eyes of his successor is the absence of any mention of him in the tombs and biographies of the many Egyptian officials who served under both Teti and Pepi I. For example, the viziers Inumin and Khentika, who served both Teti and Pepi I, are completely silent about Userkare and none of their activities during his time on the throne are reported in their tomb. The tomb of Mehi, a guard who lived under Teti, Userkare and Pepi, yielded an inscription showing that the name of Teti was first erased to be replaced by that of another king, whose name was itself erased and replaced again by that of Teti. Kanawati argues the intervening name was that of Userkare to whom Mehi may have transferred his allegiance. Mehi&#x27;s attempt to switch back to Teti was seemingly unsuccessful, as there is evidence that work on his tomb stopped abruptly and that he was never buried there.

For the Egyptologist Miroslav Bárta (cs), further troubles might have arisen directly between Pepi and relatives of his father Teti. Bárta and Baud point to Pepi&#x27;s apparent decision to dismantle the funerary complex of his paternal grandmother Sesheshet, as witnessed by blocks from this queen&#x27;s complex which were found reused as construction material in Pepi&#x27;s own mortuary temple. On the other hand, Wilfried Seipel disagrees with this interpretation of the blocks being reused by Pepi, instead, he thinks the blocks bear witness to Pepi&#x27;s foundation of a pious memorial to his grandmother. At the same time as he apparently distanced himself from his father&#x27;s line, Pepi transformed his mother&#x27;s tomb into a pyramid and posthumously bestowed a new title on her, &quot;Daughter of the King of Upper and Lower Egypt&quot;, thereby emphasising his royal lineage as a descendant of Unas, last ruler of the Fifth Dynasty.

Pepi chose the Horus name of Mery-tawy, meaning &quot;He who is loved by the two lands&quot; or &quot;Beloved of the Two Lands&quot;, which Nicolas Grimal sees as a clear indication that he desired political appeasement in times of troubles. Similarly, Pepi chose the throne name Nefersahor, meaning &quot;Perfect is the &quot;protection&quot; of Horus&quot;. Bárta adds that Pepi&#x27;s writing of his own name &quot;Mery-tawy&quot; is also highly unusual: he chose to invert the order of the hieroglyphic signs composing it, placing the sign for &quot;Beloved&quot; before that for &quot;Two Lands&quot;. For Bárta and Yannis Gourdon, this deliberate choice shows Pepi&#x27;s deference to the powerful nobility of the country, on which he was dependent. Although there seems to be no direct relation between Userkare&#x27;s brief reign and one or more later conspiracies against him, this evidence suggests some form of political instability at the time. 
=== Provincial administration ===
In a long trend that began earlier in the Fifth Dynasty, the Old Kingdom Egyptian state was the subject of increasing decentralisation and regionalisation. Provincial families played an increasingly important role, marrying into the royal family, accessing the highest offices of the state administration and having a strong influence at the court, while also consolidating their hold over regional power bases by creating local dynasties.
These processes, well under way during Pepi I&#x27;s reign, progressively weakened the king&#x27;s primacy and ascendancy over his own administration and would ultimately result in the princedoms of the First Intermediate Period. Teti and Pepi I seem to have developed several policies to counteract this. They both changed the organisation of the territorial administration during their reigns: many provincial governors were nominated, especially in Upper Egypt, while Lower Egypt was possibly under direct royal administration.
In addition, Pepi instigated the construction of royal Ka-chapels throughout Egypt to strengthen the royal presence in the provinces. These expensive policies suggest Egypt was prosperous during Pepi&#x27;s reign. Small provincial centres in areas historically associated with the crown became more important, suggesting that pharaohs of the Sixth Dynasty tried to diminish the power of regional dynasties by recruiting senior officials who did not belong to them and were loyal to the pharaoh. Some of these new officials have no known background, indicating they were not of noble extraction. The circulation of high officials, who were moved from key positions of power to other duties, occurred at an &quot;astonishing&quot; pace under Teti and Pepi I according to the Egyptologist Juan Carlos Moreno García, in what might have been a deliberate attempt to curtail the concentration of power in the hands of a few officials.

The Sixth Dynasty royal annals, only a small part of which are still legible, record further activities during Pepi&#x27;s reign, including the offering of milk and young cows for a feast of Ra, the building of a &quot;south chapel&quot; on the occasion of the new year and the arrival of messengers at court. Further offerings of lapis-lazuli, cattle, bread and beer are mentioned, for gods including Horus and the Ennead.

=== Harem Conspiracy ===

At some point in his reign, Pepi faced a conspiracy hatched by one of his harem consorts, only known by her title &quot;Weret-Yamtes&quot;. Although Weni, who served as a judge during the subsequent trial, does not report the precise nature of her crime, this at least shows that the person of the king was not untouchable. If the conspiracy happened early in Pepi&#x27;s reign as proposed by Wilfried Seipel and Vivienne Callender, the queen concerned could have been Userkare&#x27;s mother and Teti&#x27;s consort rather than Pepi&#x27;s. Most scholars, however, agree with Hans Goedicke&#x27;s thesis that the conspiracy occurred after more than two decades into Pepi&#x27;s reign. For Goedicke, the queen could have been Merenre&#x27;s mother. Nicolas Grimal and Baud see this as highly unlikely and outright outlandish respectively, as this queen&#x27;s son would have been punished along with her. Rather, the queen might have attempted unsuccessfully to secure the throne for her son, whose name is now lost.

Perhaps in response to these events, Pepi changed his prenomen Nefersahor to Meryre, meaning &quot;Beloved of Ra&quot;, even updating the inscriptions inside his pyramid. This late change with Pepi incorporating the sun god Ra&#x27;s name into his own may reflect some agreement with the influential priesthood of Ra. Around this time, Pepi married two daughters of Khui, the provincial governor of Abydos. This may also have served to counteract the weakening of the king&#x27;s authority over Middle and Upper Egypt by securing the allegiance of a powerful family. For Baud and Christopher Eyre, this also demonstrates that at the time of the Sixth Dynasty, government and power was still largely determined by family relationships rather than by bureaucracy.

The political importance of these marriages is furthered by the fact that for the first and last time until the 26th Dynasty some 1800 years later, a woman, Khui&#x27;s wife Nebet, bore the title of vizier of Upper Egypt. Egyptologists debate whether this title was purely honorific or whether she really assumed the duties of a vizier. Later, Khui&#x27;s and Nebet&#x27;s son Djau was made vizier as well. Pepi&#x27;s marriages might be at the origin of a trend which continued during the later Sixth and Eighth Dynasties, in which the temple of Min in Coptos—Khui&#x27;s seat of power—was the focus of much royal patronage. The Coptos Decrees, which record successive pharaohs granting tax exemptions to the temple, as well as official honours bestowed by the kings on the local ruling family while the Old Kingdom society was collapsing, manifest this.

=== End of reign: coregency ===

The end of Pepi&#x27;s rule may have been no less troubled than his early reign, as Kanawati conjectures that Pepi faced yet another conspiracy against him, in which his vizier Rawer may have been involved. To support his theory, Kanawati observes that Rawer&#x27;s image in his tomb has been desecrated, with his name, hands and feet chiselled off, while this same tomb is dated to the second half of Pepi&#x27;s reign on stylistic grounds. Kanawati further posits that the conspiracy may have aimed at having someone else designated heir to the throne at the expense of Merenre. Because of this failed conspiracy, Pepi I may have taken the drastic step of crowning Merenre during his own reign, thereby creating the earliest documented coregency in the history of Egypt. That such a coregency took place was first proposed by Étienne Drioton. A gold pendant bearing the names of both Pepi I and Merenre I as living kings, and the copper statues of Hierakonpolis, discussed below, indirectly support this. Goedicke has suggested further that an inscription mentioning King Merenre&#x27;s tenth year of reign in Hatnub, contradicting Manetho&#x27;s figure of seven years, is evidence that Merenre dated the start of his reign before the end of his father&#x27;s reign, as a coregency would permit.

The coregency remains uncertain. The Sixth Dynasty Royal annals bear no trace either for or against it, but the shape and size of the stone on which the annals are inscribed makes it more probable that Merenre did not start to count his years of reign until soon after the death of his father. Furthermore, William J. Murnane writes that the gold pendant&#x27;s context is unknown, making its significance regarding the coregency difficult to appraise. The copper statues are similarly inconclusive as the identity of the smaller one, and whether they originally formed a group, remains uncertain.

=== Military campaigns ===

Militarily, aggressive expansion into Nubia marked Pepi I&#x27;s reign. The walls of the tombs of the contemporary nomarchs of Elephantine, alabaster vessels bearing Pepi&#x27;s cartouche found in Kerma and inscriptions in Tumas report this. The Sixth Dynasty royal annals also recount at least one campaign into Nubia. Although the campaign narrative is now largely illegible, according to the Egyptologists Baud and Dobrev, it comprised three phases: first, messengers were sent to Nubia for negotiation and surveillance purposes; then the military campaign took place and finally a booty of men and goods was brought back to Egypt for presentation to the pharaoh.

To the north-east of Egypt, Pepi launched at least five military expeditions against the &quot;sand dwellers&quot; of Sinai and southern Canaan. These campaigns are recounted on the walls of the tomb of Weni, then officially a palace superintendent but given tasks befitting a general. Weni states that he ordered nomarchs in Upper Egypt and the Nile Delta region to &quot;call up the levies of their own subordinates, and these in turn summoned their subordinates down through every level of the local administration&quot;. Meanwhile, Nubian mercenaries were also recruited and endowed with the power to enroll men and seize goods, so that in total tens of thousands of men were at Weni&#x27;s disposal. This is the only text relating the raising of an Egyptian army during the Old Kingdom, and it indirectly reveals the absence of a permanent, standing army at the time. The goal of this army was either to repulse rebelling Semitic people or to seize their properties and conquer their land in southern Canaan, an action possibly motivated by the intense commercial activities between Egypt and this region. 
The Egyptians campaigned up to what was probably Mount Carmel or Ras Kouroun, landing troops on the coast using transport boats. Weni reports that walled towns were destroyed, fig trees and grape vines were cut down, and local shrines were burned.

===Titulary===

==Economy==

The reign of Pepi I marks the apogee of the Sixth Dynasty foreign policy, with flourishing trade, several mining and quarrying expeditions and major military campaigns.

===Foreign trade and mining===
Trade with settlements along the Levantine coast, which had existed during the Fifth Dynasty, seems to have peaked under Pepi I and Pepi II. Their chief trade partner there might have been Byblos, where dozens of inscriptions on stone vessels showing Pepi&#x27;s cartouches have been found, and a large alabaster vessel bearing Pepi&#x27;s titulary and commemorating his jubilee from the Temple of Baalat Gebal. The high official, Iny, served Pepi during several successful expeditions to Byblos for which the king rewarded him with the name &quot;Inydjefaw&quot;, meaning, &quot;He who brings back provisions&quot;. Through Byblos, Egypt, had indirect contacts with the city of Ebla in modern-day Syria. The contact with Ebla is established by alabaster vessels bearing Pepi&#x27;s name found near its royal palace G, destroyed in the 23rd century BC, possibly by the Akkadian Empire under Sargon. Trading parties departed Egypt for the Levant from a Nile Delta port called Ra-Hat, &quot;the first mouth [of the Nile]&quot;. This trade benefited the nearby city of Mendes, from which one of Pepi&#x27;s viziers probably originated. Further contacts with Canaan may be inferred from a statue of Pepi, which is said to have been unearthed in Gezer but has since been lost.

Expeditions and mining activities that were already taking place in the Fifth and early Sixth Dynasty continued unabated. These include at least one expedition of workmen and their military escort to the mines of turquoise and copper in Wadi Maghareh, Sinai, around Pepi&#x27;s 36th year on the throne. In all likelihood, this expedition departed Egypt from the Red Sea coast port of Ayn Soukhna, which was active during Pepi&#x27;s reign. The same port may also have been the origin of an expedition to the southern Red Sea, possibly to Punt, as witnessed by Ethiopian obsidian discovered on the site. There were also one or more expeditions to Hatnub, where alabaster was extracted at least once in Pepi&#x27;s 49th year of reign, as well as visits to the Gebel el-Silsila and Sehel Island. A trading expedition fetching lapis-lazuli and lead or tin may also have passed further south through Mirgissa. Greywacke and siltstone for building projects originated from quarries of the Wadi Hammamat, where some eighty graffiti mention Pepi I. At the same time, an extensive network of caravan routes traversed Egypt&#x27;s Western Desert, for example, from Abydos to the Kharga Oasis and from there to the Dakhla and Selima Oases.

===Domestic policies===
Agricultural estates affiliated with the crown in the provinces during the preceding dynasty were replaced by novel administrative entities, the &quot;ḥwt&quot;, which were agricultural centres controlling tracts of land, livestock and workers. Together with temples and royal domains, these numerous &quot;ḥwt&quot; represented a network of warehouses accessible to royal envoys and from which taxes and labor could easily be collected. This territorial mode of organisation disappeared nearly 300 years after Pepi I&#x27;s reign, at the dawn of the Middle Kingdom period.

Pepi decreed tax-exemptions to various institutions. He gave an exemption to a chapel dedicated to the cult of his mother located in Coptos. Another decree has survived on a stele discovered near the Bent Pyramid in Dashur, whereby in his 21st year of reign, Pepi grants exemptions to the people serving in the two pyramids towns of Sneferu:

The Egyptologist David Warburton sees such perpetual tax exemptions as capitulations by a king confronted with rampant corruption. Whether they were the result of religious or political motives, exemptions created precedents that encouraged other institutions to request similar treatment, weakening the power of the state as they accumulated over time.

Further domestic activities related to agriculture and the economy may be inferred from the inscriptions found in the tomb of Nekhebu, a high official belonging to the family of Senedjemib Inti, a vizier during the late Fifth Dynasty. Nekhebu reports overseeing the excavations of canals in Lower Egypt and at Cusae in Middle Egypt.

==Building activities==

Pepi I built extensively throughout Egypt, so much so that in 1900 the Egyptologist Flinders Petrie stated &quot;this king has left more monuments, large and small, than any other ruler before the Twelfth Dynasty&quot;. The Egyptologist Jean Leclant reached a similar conclusion in 1999. He sees Pepi&#x27;s rule as marking the apogee of the Old Kingdom owing to the flurry of building activities, administrative reforms, trade and military campaigns at the time. Pepi devoted most of his building efforts to local cults and royal Ka-chapels, seemingly with the objective of affirming the king&#x27;s stature and presence in the provinces.

===Ka-chapels===
Ka-chapels were small cult buildings comprising one or more chambers to hold offerings dedicated to the cult of the Ka of a deceased or, in this case, the king. Such chapels dedicated to Pepi I were uncovered or are known from contemporary sources to have stood in Hierakonpolis, in Abydos, and in the central Nile Delta region, in Memphis, Zawyet el-Meytin, Assiut, Qus and beyond the Nile Valley in Balat, a settlement of the Dakhla Oasis. In addition, two chapels were built in Bubastis and probably more than one stood in Dendera. Finally, yet another chapel is believed to have existed in Elkab, where rock inscriptions refer to his funerary cult. All these buildings were probably peripheral to or inside larger temples hosting extensive cult activities. For example, the chapel at Abydos was next to the temple of Khenti-Amentiu. For the Egyptologist Juan Moreno García, this proximity demonstrates the direct power that the king still held over the temples&#x27; economic activities and internal affairs during the Sixth Dynasty.
In an underground store beneath the floor of Hierakonpolis&#x27; Ka-chapel of Pepi, the Egyptologist James Quibell uncovered a statue of King Khasekhemwy of the Second Dynasty, a terracotta lion cub made during the Thinite era, a golden mask representing Horus and two copper statues. Originally fashioned by hammering plates of copper over a wooden base, these statues had been disassembled, placed inside one another and then sealed with a thin layer of engraved copper bearing the titles and names of Pepi I &quot;on the first day of the Heb Sed&quot; feast. The two statues were symbolically &quot;trampling underfoot the Nine bows&quot;—the enemies of Egypt—a stylized representation of Egypt&#x27;s conquered foreign subjects. While the identity of the larger adult figure as Pepi I is revealed by the inscription, the identity of the smaller statue showing a younger person remains unresolved. The most common hypothesis among Egyptologists is that the young man shown is Merenre. As Alessandro Bongioanni and Maria Croce write: &quot;[Merenre] was publicly associated as his father&#x27;s successor on the occasion of the Jubilee [the Heb Sed feast]. The placement of his copper effigy inside that of his father would therefore reflect the continuity of the royal succession and the passage of the royal sceptre from father to son before the death of the pharaoh could cause a dynastic split.&quot; Alternatively, Bongioanni and Croce have also proposed the smaller statue may represent &quot;a more youthful Pepy I, reinvigorated by the celebration of the Jubilee ceremonies&quot;.

===Temples===
The close association between Ka-chapels and temples to deities might have spurred building activities for the latter. For example, the Bubastis ensemble of Pepi I comprised a enclosure wall with a small rectangular Ka-chapel housing eight pillars near its north corner. This ensemble was peripheral to the main Old Kingdom temple dedicated to the goddess Bastet.
In Dendera, where a fragmentary statue of a seated Pepi I has been uncovered, Pepi restored the temple complex to the goddess Hathor. He seems particularly to have desired to be associated with her, using the epithet &quot;son of Hathor of Dendera&quot; on numerous vessels found throughout Egypt and abroad. In Abydos, he built a small rock cut chapel dedicated to the local god Khenti-Amentiu, where he is again referred to as &quot;Pepi, son of Hathor of Dendera&quot;. Pepi also referred to himself as the son of Atum of Heliopolis, direct evidence for the strengthening of the Heliopolitan cults at the time.

At the southern border of Egypt, in Elephantine, several faience plaques bearing Pepi&#x27;s cartouche have been uncovered in the temple of Satet. These may suggest royal interest in the local cult. An alabaster statue of an ape with its offspring bearing Pepi I&#x27;s cartouche was uncovered in the same location, but it was probably a gift of the king to a high official who then dedicated it to Satet. In this temple, Pepi built a red granite naos, destined either to house the goddess&#x27;s statue, or a statue of Pepi I himself, which would mean the naos was yet another Ka-chapel. Pepi I&#x27;s cartouche and the epithet &quot;beloved of Satet&quot; is inscribed on the naos, which stands high. Pepi seems to have undertaken wider works in the temple, possibly reorganising its layout by adding walls and an altar. In this context, the faience tablets bearing his cartouche may be foundation offerings made at the start of the works, although this has been contested. For the Egyptologist David Warburton, the reigns of Pepi I and II mark the first period during which small stone temples dedicated to local deities were built in Egypt.

===Pyramid complex===

Pepi I had a pyramid complex built for himself in South Saqqara, which he named &quot;Men-nefer-Pepi&quot; variously translated as &quot;Pepi&#x27;s splendour is enduring&quot;, &quot;The perfection of Pepi is established&quot;, &quot;The beauty of Pepi endures&quot;, or &quot;The perfection of Pepi endures&quot;. The shortened name &quot;Mennefer&quot; for the pyramid complex progressively became the name of the nearby capital of Egypt—which had originally been called &quot;Ineb-hedj&quot;. In particular, the Egyptian &quot;Mennefer&quot; ultimately gave Memphis in Greek, a name which is still in use for this ancient city. Pepi I&#x27;s mortuary complex is neighboured on its south-west corner by a necropolis built during his own reign and the reigns of Merenre and Pepi II. The necropolis housed the pyramids of Pepi I&#x27;s consorts and their dedicated funerary temples.

====Main pyramid====

Pepi&#x27;s main pyramid was constructed in the same fashion as royal pyramids since the reign of Djedkare Isesi some 80 years earlier: a core built six steps high from small roughly dressed blocks of limestone bound together using clay mortar encased with fine limestone blocks. The pyramid, now destroyed, had a base length of converging to the apex at ~ 53° and once stood tall. Its remains now form a meager mound of , containing a pit in its centre dug by stone thieves.

The substructure of the pyramid was accessed from the north chapel which has since disappeared. From the entrance, a descending corridor gives way to a vestibule leading into the horizontal passage. Halfway along the passage, three granite portcullises guard the chambers. As in preceding pyramids, the substructure contains three chambers: an antechamber on the pyramids vertical axis, a serdab with three recesses to its east, and a burial chamber containing the king&#x27;s sarcophagus to the west. Extraordinarily, the pink granite canopic chest that is sunk into the floor at the foot of the sarcophagus has remained undisturbed. Discovered alongside it was a bundle of viscera presumed to belong to the pharaoh. The provenance of a mummy fragment and fine linen wrappings discovered in the burial chamber are unknown, but they are hypothesized to belong to Pepi I.

The walls of Pepi I&#x27;s antechamber, burial chamber, and much of the corridor are covered with vertical columns of inscribed hieroglyphic text. The hieroglyphs are painted green with ground malachite and gum arabic, a colour symbolising renewal. His sarcophagus is also inscribed on its east side with the king&#x27;s titles and names, as part of a larger set of spells that includes texts at the bottom of the north and south walls opposite the sarcophagus, and in a line running across the top of the north, west, and south walls of the chamber. The writing comprises 2,263 columns and lines of text from 651 spells, of which 82 are unique to Pepi&#x27;s pyramid. This is the most extensive corpus of Pyramid Texts from the Old Kingdom. The tradition of inscribing texts inside the pyramid was begun by Unas at the end of the Fifth Dynasty, but originally discovered in Pepi I&#x27;s pyramid in 1880. Their function, like that of all funerary literature, was to enable the reunion of the ruler&#x27;s &quot;ba&quot; and Ka, leading to the transformation into an &quot;akh&quot;, and to secure eternal life among the gods in the sky.

====Mortuary temple====

Pepi&#x27;s pyramid was part of a wider funerary complex comprising a small cult pyramid and mortuary temple surrounded by an enclosure wall. The purpose of the cult pyramid remains unclear. While it had a burial chamber, it was never used as such and must have been a purely symbolic structure. It may have hosted the pharaoh&#x27;s Ka, or a miniature statue of the king, and could have been used for ritual performances centring around the burial and resurrection of the Ka spirit during the Sed festival. Excavations of the small cult pyramid yielded statue fragments, pieces of stelae and offering tables which indicate the continuation of Pepi&#x27;s funerary cult into the Middle Kingdom.

A valley temple by the Nile and a causeway leading from this temple up to the pyramid on the desert plateau completed the overall construction. The high temple, next to the pyramid, was laid out according to a standard plan, making it nearly the same as the temples of Djedkare Isesi, Unas, and Teti. The temple had an entrance hall some high, now almost completely destroyed, leading into an open columned courtyard. Storage rooms to the north and south flanked the hall. The inner temple contained a chapel with five statue niches, an offering hall and other core chambers. Either the mortuary temple or the causeway might have been lined with statues of kneeling bound captives representing Egypt&#x27;s traditional enemies. Both the temple and the causeway are now heavily damaged due the activity of lime makers, who extracted and burned the construction stones to turn them into mortar and whitewash in later times. In particular, the original location of the statues remains uncertain as they had been displaced, ready to be thrown into a lime furnace.

===Necropolis of Pepi I===
Pepi&#x27;s mortuary complex was the centre of a wider necropolis which comprised the tombs of the royal family and further afield those of the high officials of the state administration including a tomb for Weni. Pepi had pyramids built for his consorts to the south and south-west of his pyramid. These were all located outside the complex&#x27; enclosure wall but inside an area delimited by a street to the west. Three of the main queens&#x27; pyramids were built in a row on an east–west axis, each with a base side dimension of about . The Ancient Egyptians referred to the owners of these pyramids as the &quot;Queen of the East&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Centre&quot; and &quot;Queen of the West&quot;.

====Pyramid of Nebwenet====
The pyramid of the queen of the east belonged to Nebwenet, whose name, image and titles are preserved on a fallen jamb uncovered in the attached mortuary temple. The pyramid had a base of , making it similar in size to the other pyramids of the necropolis. On its northern face was a small mudbrick chapel, which hosted a limestone altar, now broken. The pyramid&#x27;s substructures were accessed from a descending passageway leading first to an antechamber and, from there, to the burial chamber slightly to the south of the pyramid&#x27;s apex. This chamber yielded fragments of pink granite sarcophagus and pieces of inscribed alabaster. To the east was a serdab and the scant remnants of funerary equipment.

====Pyramid of Inenek-Inti====
Immediately west of the pyramid of the queen of the east was the pyramid of the queen of the centre, Inenek-Inti. The name, image and titles of this queen are inscribed on jambs and two high red-painted obelisks on either side of the gateway to the mortuary temple, establishing that Inenek-Inti was buried there. With a base of , the pyramid size and layout is similar to that of Nebwenet, except that the burial chamber is located precisely beneath the pyramid apex. Fragments of a greywacke sarcophagus and pieces of stone vessels were uncovered there. Unlike Ankhesenpepi II&#x27;s burial chamber, that of Inenek-Inti had no inscriptions on its walls. Inenek&#x27;s mortuary temple was much larger than Nebwenet&#x27;s, surrounding her pyramid on its eastern, northern and southern sides. Inenek&#x27;s complex also comprised a small cult pyramid, at the base, on the south-east corner of the mortuary temple.

====Queen of the West====
West of Inenek&#x27;s pyramid is that of the queen of the west. The identity of this pyramid&#x27;s owner is preserved on an obelisk in front of her pyramid only as &quot;the eldest daughter of the king&quot;. The pyramid had a base length of around , similar to those of Inenek and Nebwenet, and now stands tall. Entry into the substructure is gained on the north face. The burial chamber is located under the vertical axis of the pyramid. The location of the serdab is unusual, being to the south of the burial chamber instead of east. Substantial remains of funerary equipment were found inside including wooden weights, ostrich feathers, copper fish hooks, and fired-clay vessels, but none bore their owner&#x27;s name. It has a hastily built mortuary temple, with an offering hall and a room with two statue niches. Relief fragments discovered depict scenes of processions and estates, along with an incomplete cartouche of Pepi I&#x27;s name.

====Pyramid of Ankhesenpepi II====

The pyramid of Ankhesenpepi II occupies the south-western extremity of the necropolis of Pepi I. With a base of , the pyramid once reached high, making it the largest of the queens&#x27; pyramids. The funerary complex of Ankhesenpepi II was also the largest in the necropolis except for that of Pepi himself, covering an area of . It comprised a mortuary temple to the north of the pyramid and 20 storage rooms for offerings. The queen&#x27;s funerary complex had a monumental entrance with a granite frame, its lintel bearing the queen&#x27;s name and titles being more than wide and weighing over 17 tons.
A small chapel stood on the pyramid northern face, at the entrance of the substructures. Painted reliefs of which only scant remains have been found including a small scene depicting the queen and a princess on a boat among papyrus plants, adorned the accompanying funerary temple. The burial chamber walls were inscribed with spells from the pyramid texts, a privilege that had been the preserve of kings. Fragments from a black basalt sarcophagus were uncovered onsite.

====Pyramid of Behenu====
With a base of , Queen Behenu&#x27;s pyramid was of similar size and layout to the other queens&#x27; pyramids of the necropolis. Located on the western end of the necropolis, immediately north-west of Mehaa&#x27;s tomb on which it intrudes, Behenu&#x27;s mortuary temple was on the pyramid&#x27;s southern face with a cult pyramid on its south-east corner. The entrance of the temple, flanked with two granite obelisks, led to several rooms, which once housed statues and offering altars, while a further 10 rooms served for storage.
The burial chamber measured , and its walls were inscribed with numerous spells of the pyramid texts. The head of a wooden statue of the queen as well as her opened basalt sarcophagus were unearthed there.

====Pyramid of Mehaa====
Pepi&#x27;s consort Mehaa was buried in a pyramid on the south-west corner of Pepi&#x27;s enclosure wall. Directly adjacent to Mehaa&#x27;s pyramid&#x27;s eastern face was her mortuary temple, where a relief bearing the name and image of Prince Hornetjerykhet, her son, was uncovered. Mehaa&#x27;s pyramid is intruded upon by the pyramid of Behenu, establishing that Mehaa was a consort of Pepi I early in his reign while Behenu lived in the later part of his rule.

==Legacy==
===Old Kingdom===
Pepi I was the object of a funerary cult after his death. For the remainder of the Old Kingdom period, the funerary cult of Pepi had active priests even outside of his Saqqara mortuary complex, for example inscriptions in Elkab attest to the presence of priests of his cult officiating in or in the vicinity of the local temple of Nekhbet. The ritual activities taking place in his main funerary complex continued up until the Middle Kingdom. This means that Pepi&#x27;s cult continued to be celebrated during the First Intermediate Period, a period during which the Egyptian state seems to have collapsed, with only brief interruptions of the cultic activities at times of important political instability.

As members of the royal family and high officials had continued to be buried in the necropolis next to Pepi&#x27;s pyramid during the reigns of Merenre and Pepi II, including Ankhesenpepi II and III and Pepi&#x27;s daughter Meritites, Pepi&#x27;s necropolis had grown and had attracted burials from the highest officials such as vizier Weni. Starting with the reign of Pepi II, the necropolis also attracted burials from private individuals as well as popular devotion to him and his consorts. The deposit of numerous offering tables throughout the site confirms this.

===Middle Kingdom===
The conquest of Egypt under Mentuhotep II seems to have interrupted all activities in the necropolis. These resumed towards the end of the Eleventh Dynasty, when the state-sponsored funerary cult of Pepi was renewed, albeit in a more limited form than earlier. At this time, private cultic activities seem to cease in the wider necropolis of Pepi, rather concentrating in Pepi&#x27;s own mortuary temple, mainly around his statues, then accessible to important officials participating in the pharaoh&#x27;s cult. Meanwhile, the abandonment of certain parts of the mortuary temple and the queens&#x27; necropolis led to the installation of novel tombs. The most prominent of these was that of the high official Reheryshefnakht, who had a small pyramid complex built for himself in the midst of the tombs of the Sixth Dynasty royal family. The royal cult of Pepi I seems to have ended with the onset of the Second Intermediate Period.

===New Kingdom===

The New Kingdom period witnessed renewed private burials in the necropolis of Pepi, including in several rooms of his mortuary temple which were used as a catacomb at the time, although no such tomb was found in the main room hosting the royal funerary cult, suggesting continued use. The individuals buried in the necropolis belonged to the lower ranks of Egyptian society, as shown by the simplicity, if not the absence, of funerary equipment, while those using the catacombs were richer. 

The consequences of the long-lasting cults of Old Kingdom pharaohs during the New Kingdom are apparent in the Karnak king list. It was composed during the reign of Thutmosis III to honour a selection of royal ancestors. Several kings of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasty including Nyuserre Ini, Djedkare Isesi, Teti and Pepi I are mentioned on the list by their birth name, rather than throne name. The Egyptologist Antonio Morales believes this is because the popular cults for these kings, which existed well into the New Kingdom, referred to these kings using their birth name.

Later, during the reign of Ramses II, limited restoration works on the Old Kingdom monuments took place in the Memphite area under the direction of Prince Khaemweset. Pepi&#x27;s pyramid complex was among those restored, as shown by inscriptions left on-site by Khaemweset, even though it was actively being used for private burials. Pepi I&#x27;s necropolis was, therefore, probably in a ruined state at this point, with the area with the queens&#x27; pyramids serving as a stone quarry. Khaemweset stated he had found the pyramid &quot;abandoned&quot; and &quot;recalled his for posterity&quot;. The progressive accumulation of burials in the passages leading up to the temple cult rooms blocked all access to it, demonstrating that Pepi&#x27;s funerary cult had ceased.

===Late Period===
The stone quarrying activities, which were limited to Pepi&#x27;s necropolis during the New Kingdom and had spared his mortuary temple, became widespread during the Late Period of Egypt, with intermittent burials continuing nonetheless. Both the stone robbing and funerary activities stopped at some point during the period, and the necropolis was abandoned until the Mamluk period when intense stone quarrying resumed.

<doc id="910997" wikidata="Q942577" url="?curid=910997" title="Ralph Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford">
<text>Ralph de Stafford, 1st Earl of Stafford, 2nd Baron Stafford (24 September 1301 – 31 August 1372), KG, of Stafford Castle and Madeley Castle in Staffordshire, was an English nobleman and a notable soldier during the Hundred Years&#x27; War against France.

==Early life and family==
Ralph was born on 24 September 1301, the son of Edmund de Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford and Margaret Basset. Having lost his father at the age of seven, Ralph grew up in the midlands with his mother&#x27;s relatives, including her second husband Thomas Pipe. He had his first experience of royal service, along with his brothers and stepfather, when he joined the retinue of Ralph, 2nd Lord Basset.

==Career==

Stafford was made a Knight banneret in 1327 and was fighting the Scots shortly afterwards. He supported the plot to free Edward III of England from the control of Roger Mortimer, which earned the king&#x27;s gratitude. By the summer of 1332, he was a commissioner of the peace in Staffordshire and had served abroad on royal business, accompanying Hugh de Audley, 1st Earl of Gloucester. He was also still fighting the Scots, commanding archers at the Battle of Dupplin Moor on 11 Aug 1332 and on three further Scottish campaigns.

He was first summoned to Parliament by writ as Lord Stafford on 29 November 1336 and continued to attend until 1350.

His military career continued, accompanying King Edward to France in 1338 as an advisor and being present at the naval battle of Sluys on 24 June 1340. He also fought at the relief of Brest and the siege of Morlaix. He was captured at Vannes but was exchanged in time to negotiate a truce at Malestroit.

On 6 January 1341, he was made Steward of the Royal Household but resigned that post on 29 March 1345 having assumed the office of Seneschal of Aquitaine, an English possession in France, where he stayed for about a year. He took part in the Gascon campaign of 1345 including the battles of Bergerac and Auberoche, the siege of Aiguillon, from where he escaped prior to its lifting, a raid on Barfleur and the English victory at the Battle of Crecy, on 26 August 1346. He became one of the twenty-six founding members and the fifth knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348.

In November 1347, his wife&#x27;s father died; they were able to take possession of his estates without paying the king&#x27;s homage, an indication of the relationship between them. Ralph was now a very wealthy man, from his estates and from the many prizes from the French war.

Edward III created a number of new peerage titles to honour his war captains and to mark his jubilee year. Ralph was created the 1st Earl of Stafford on 5 March 1350, with an annuity of 1000 marks. He now replaced Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster as the king&#x27;s lieutenant in Gascony. He committed to serve with 200 men at his own expense with the expectation of this being doubled in March 1353 at the king&#x27;s expense. The campaigns provided several captives that were ransomed, but were ultimately unsuccessful, leading to the appointment of Edward, Prince of Wales to command.

Even at the age of sixty, Stafford continued to command troops and act as a royal envoy, both in France and in Ireland in 1361, accompanying Lionel of Antwerp to try and restore English control.

==Marriages and children==
Around 1326, Stafford married his first wife, Katherine de Hastang. Katherine was the daughter of Sir John de Hastang, Knight, of Chebsey, Staffordshire. Ralph and Katherine had two daughters:

*Margaret Stafford, married Sir John de Stafford, Knight, of &quot;Broomshull&quot; (Bramshall near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire) and Amblecote in the parish of Old Swinford, Worcestershire, ancestor of several prominent Stafford lines, most notably Stafford of Hooke in Dorset, Stafford of Southwick in Wiltshire and Stafford of Grafton in Worcestershire.
*Joan Stafford, married Sir Nicholas de Beke, Knight.

He later sensationally abducted Margaret de Audley, 2nd Baroness Audley, daughter of Hugh de Audley, 1st Earl of Gloucester and Margaret de Clare, who was worth at least £2,314 a year, more than ten times his own estates. Her parents filed a complaint with King Edward III of England, but the King supported Stafford&#x27;s actions. In compensation, the King appeased Hugh and Margaret by creating Hugh the 1st Earl of Gloucester. Margaret de Audley and Stafford married before 6 July 1336 and they subsequently had two sons and four daughters: 
* Ralph de Stafford (d. 1347), married Maud of Lancaster, daughter of Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster and Isabel de Beaumont in 1344.
* Hugh de Stafford, 2nd Earl of Stafford, born circa 1336 in Staffordshire, England, married Philippa de Beauchamp; they were the ancestors of the Dukes of Buckingham (1444 creation).
* Elizabeth de Stafford, born circa 1340 in Staffordshire, England, died 7 August 1376, married firstly Fulk le Strange; married secondly, John de Ferrers, 4th Baron Ferrers of Chartley; married thirdly Reginald de Cobham, 4th Baron Cobham.
* Beatrice de Stafford, born circa 1341 in Staffordshire, England, died 1415, married firstly, in 1350, Maurice FitzGerald, 2nd Earl of Desmond (d. June 1358); married secondly, Thomas de Ros, 4th Baron de Ros, of Helmsley; married thirdly Sir Richard Burley, Knt.
* Joan de Stafford, born in 1344 in Staffordshire, England, died 1397, married firstly, John Charleton, 3rd Baron Cherleton; married secondly Gilbert Talbot, 3rd Baron Talbot.
* Katherine de Stafford, born circa 1348 in Staffordshire, England and died in December 1361. On 25 December 1357, she married Sir John Sutton III (1339 – c. 1370 or 1376), Knight, Master of Dudley Castle, Staffordshire. Burke reports that she died without issue. However, Burke is often erroneous and incomplete, and later evidence supports that she is the mother of John Sutton IV, 3rd Baron Sutton of Dudley, probably having died in childbirth.

==Death==
He died on 31 August 1372 at Tonbridge Castle, Kent, England. He was buried at Tonbridge Priory, next to his second wife and her parents.

<text>A flight progress strip or flight strip is a small strip of paper used to track a flight in air traffic control (ATC). While it has been supplemented by more technologically advanced methods of flight tracking since its introduction, it is still used in modern ATC as a quick way to annotate a flight, to keep a legal record of the instructions that were issued, to allow other controllers to see instantly what is happening and to pass this information to other controllers who go on to control the flight.

== Positioning ==

The strip is mounted in a plastic boot called a &#x27;strip holder&#x27; and placed with other strips in a &#x27;strip board&#x27; which is then used as a representation of all flights in a particular sector of airspace or on an airport. The color of the strip holder itself often has a meaning. The strip board has vertical rails that constrain the strips in several stacks (&#x27;bays&#x27;).

The position of the strip in the board is a significant part of the information of the strip board: approach and area controllers typically keep their strips in level/altitude order, whereas tower controllers use the bays to represent the ground, the runway and the air. Each bay might be further sub-divided using &#x27;designator strips&#x27; and metal bars to allow even more information to be portrayed by the position of a flight progress strip. Other special strips can be used to indicate special airspace statuses, or to represent the presence of physical obstructions or vehicles on the ground. They may even be used to provide a quick reminder to the controller of other pertinent information, e.g. the time when night begins or ends.

== Content ==
There are many styles of progress strip layouts, but minor differences aside, a strip contains at least:

*Aircraft identification (e.g. aircraft registration or a flight number)
*Aircraft type as the relevant 4-letter ICAO designator (e.g. B744 for a Boeing 747-400)
*Level (assigned altitude)
*Departure and destination
*At least one time in four figures (other times can be shortened to minutes only).

Other information may be added as required.

== Use ==
After processing the flight plan, computers will send flight strips to the tower, to the radar facility that handles the departure route, and to the Center controller whose sector the flight first enters. These strips are delivered approximately 30 minutes prior to the proposed departure time. Strips are delivered to en route facilities 30 minutes before the flight is expected to enter their airspace.

In addition a strip may be &quot;cocked out&quot;, or offset, from normal alignment to highlight potential issues. This can be used either as a personal reminder or as a form of communication between controllers.

For filed flight plans, strips are initially printed from a computer and often contain more information than this. Further information is then added by controllers and assistants in various colored pens to show the role of person making the annotation. For &#x27;free-calling&#x27; aircraft (generally smaller aircraft transiting airspace), strips must be fully hand-written by the controller or assistant from information passed by radio.

== Replacement by computers ==
In some countries, strips have been replaced by electronic equivalents. These generally use touch-screens to show the flight information, while still trying to keep some of the physical aspects of paper strips and strip racks. This is not always a problem-free transition, since physical strips have many characteristics that a computer system cannot replicate. In fact, the term &quot;handoff,&quot; which is used today to denote the computerized transfer of control of an aircraft from one sector to another, comes from the older technique of physically handing off the flight progress strip to the next controller to denote the transfer of responsibility. 

This technique is still used today within some control towers; for example, the ground controller may physically hand the strip to the local controller as the aircraft reaches the runway, or the local controller will drop the strip and strip holder down a chute to the departure radar controller in the room below, once the aircraft has been cleared for takeoff.
