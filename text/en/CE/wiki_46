<text>Bent Gestur Sivertz (August 11, 1905 – October 4, 2000) was a Canadian sailor, teacher, soldier, and civil servant.

He was commissioner of the Northwest Territories from July 12, 1963 to January 16, 1967. He was the last non-resident Commissioner of the NWT.

Bent Gestur &quot;Ben&quot; Sivertz was born one of six brothers in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. His parents were Icelandic immigrants and he and his brothers were raised in Victoria, B.C. where his father Christian was a longtime letter carrier and an early labour organizer in the post office. Bent was a merchant seaman and sailed in square-rigged ships for ten years on the B.C. coast and to Australia and New Zealand. He later crewed on tugboats such as the &quot;Moresby&quot; and &quot;Salvage King&quot; while taking teacher training at U.B.C. As an officer in the R.C.N.V.R., he was called up in 1940 for service with the Royal Canadian Navy and after instructing in navigation at several locations in Canada, in 1944 became commanding officer of HMCS Kings, as the Officer Training Establishment was then called. II.

After World War II, Bent Sivertz entered the Department of External Affairs where his success in reorganizing and streamlining the Passport Office to a point where passports were issued in three days rather than the previous three weeks, led to him being drafted in 1950 into the new Department of Resources and Development. Sivertz initiated a number of progressive and innovative policies in northern healthcare, education, infrastructure and corrections. His memoir recounts some of these activities and his struggles with Arthur Laing the then Minister of Northern Affairs. Sivertz became Commissioner of the Northwest Territories in 1963 and served until 1967. During the 1950s he was instrumental in introducing print making and cooperative marketing to the Cape Dorset Inuit.

&quot;Today my tenure in Arctic Canada, and that of my colleagues is often referred to by the new breed of historians and politicians, as &quot;assimilationist&quot;. They are quick to say that we were &quot;well-intentioned, but misguided.&quot; I am told that I must not take personally the very personal attacks that have been leveled against me in the name of progress, but simply to understand that my notion of right and wrong was different from that of today. This has been a sadness for me and many of my northern peers who devoted themselves to Canada&#x27;s North. In 1993, the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples formalized this attack and destroyed many reputations, while turning history into a black and white affair, casting the white government employees as the &#x27;bad guy&#x27;, and the northern people, the Inui, [as] the exploited innocents. In spite of my difficulty with this Commission and my shabby treatment at its hands, my experiences in northern work have not been diminished where personal recollection is concerned.&quot;

Bent &quot;Ben&quot; Sivertz&#x27;s oldest brother Henry George was a teacher until his enlistment in the Canadian Expeditionary Force. Henry was one of thirty-six Canadians awarded the Military Medal and two bars during World War I. He was killed in action in September 1918 at the (second) Battle of Cambrai. He is commemorated in the former Provincial Normal School (for teachers), of which he was a graduate, now part of Camosun College, Victoria, B.C. The next oldest brother Gustave &quot;Gus&quot; Sivertz also served in the C.E.F. and was later a well-known journalist in Vancouver where he wrote a periodic column called &quot;Memoirs of an Old Sweat&quot; about the War and veterans concerns. Christian &quot;Chris&quot; Sivertz, was also a teacher when he volunteered with his brothers in July 1916. All three brothers served in infantry battalions on the Western Front, Gus being wounded.

Bent Gestur Sivertz died on Mayne Island, BC in 2000. His wife, Barbara Isabel (née Prael) Sivertz predeceased him in Victoria, B.C. in 1995.

<text>Sarah Knox Davis ( Taylor; March 6, 1814 – September 15, 1835) was the daughter of the 12th U.S. president Zachary Taylor and part of the notable Lee family. She met future Confederate president Jefferson Davis (1808–1889) when living with her father and family at Fort Crawford during the Black Hawk War in 1832. They married in 1835 and she died three months later of malaria. 

==Marriage and death==
Zachary Taylor and his wife, Margaret, had three surviving daughters and one son. Sarah Knox Taylor was their second child and spent some years growing up on military installations. Her father became a general and commanded forts; her mother provided most of her education. Sarah was given the nickname &quot;Knoxie,&quot; which originated from her middle name and from Fort Knox II in Vincennes, Indiana, where she was born. In the early 1830s, her father commanded Fort Crawford at Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin, and was involved in waging the Black Hawk War. His wife and children lived there with him.

At age 17, Sarah fell in love with Jefferson Davis, (1808–1889), a recent graduate of the United States Military Academy, and a newly commissioned lieutenant in the United States Army, who was second to General Taylor at the fort. Davis was transferred to St. Louis in 1833, yet managed to keep in contact with the woman whom he wished to marry. Zachary Taylor admired Davis for his soldiering skills but opposed the romantic match. The Taylors&#x27; older daughter had already married Army surgeon Robert Crooke Wood, and they were raising three young children in a desolate frontier outpost. Together with their own experience, the Taylors felt that the military life was too hard and did not want Sarah to be an Army wife. 

Following discussions with his older brother Joseph Emory Davis, Jefferson decided to resign from the Army so that he could marry Sarah. He returned to Mississippi to develop his Brierfield Plantation next to his brother&#x27;s Hurricane Plantation. Joseph gave Jefferson the land, called Brierfield because it was largely covered with brush and briers.

After Sarah turned 21, she married Davis on June 17, 1835 at the home of her aunt, near Louisville, Kentucky. Both of the newlyweds contracted either malaria or yellow fever on a summer visit to Davis&#x27;s sister, Anna Davis Smith, in St. Francisville, Louisiana. Sarah Taylor Davis died of the tropical illness just three months into her marriage to Jefferson Davis, while staying in her sister-in-law&#x27;s home, Locust Grove Plantation. Her husband nearly died as well.
The young Mrs. Davis was laid to rest near other members of Jefferson Davis&#x27;s family, in the cemetery located on the site of the (former) Locust Grove Plantation. The cemetery has been preserved by the state of Louisiana and is now known as the Locust Grove State Historic Site.

==Posthumous==

Jefferson Davis was devastated by the death of his young wife, as were her parents. Her death caused years of ill will between Davis and Zachary Taylor; Taylor and his wife felt that Davis should have known better than to go to St. Francisville in the &quot;fever season&quot;. The men met by chance in 1845 on a Mississippi steamboat and achieved some reconciliation.

After recovering from malaria, seeking respite from the loss of his wife, Davis sailed to Havana, and then to New York City. In 1836, he returned to his Brierfield Plantation in Warren County, Mississippi, to take up cotton cultivation. After being reclusive for years, he gradually became active in politics. He remarried in 1845 and had six children. He served in Congress and was elected as President of the Confederate States of America, after secession in 1861.

When Jefferson Davis married Varina Banks Howell on February 26, 1845, he insisted that the newlywed couple visit Sarah&#x27;s grave during their honeymoon.

Davis served as Colonel under the command of General Zachary Taylor in the 1847 Battle of Buena Vista during the Mexican–American War. Davis fought bravely during the battle but was shot in the foot, necessitating his removal to safety by Robert H. Chilton. In recognition of Davis&#x27;s bravery and initiative, Taylor is reputed to have said, &quot;My daughter, sir, was a better judge of men than I was.&quot;

<text>Henry Tazewell (November 27, 1753January 24, 1799) was an American politician who was instrumental in the early government of Virginia, and a US senator from Virginia. He was a slave owner, and served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate in 1795.

==Early life==
Born in Brunswick County, Virginia, Tazewell was the son of Littleton and Mary Gray Tazewell. He attended the rural schools and graduated from the College of William &amp; Mary at Williamsburg, Virginia, in 1770.

He married Dorothea Elizabeth Waller on January 13, 1774, who were the parents of Littleton Waller Tazewell, who became a senator and governor of Virginia, and a daughter, Sophia Ann.

==Career==

Tazewell studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1773, and began his practice. During the American Revolutionary War, he raised and was commissioned captain of a troop of cavalry.

A member of the House of Burgesses in 1775, Tazewell was also a delegate to the Fourth Virginia Convention of 1775 and the Fifth Virginia Convention of 1776, which wrote the state constitution. From 1778 to 1785, he was a member of the Virginia General Assembly.

In 1785, Tazewell became a judge of the Virginia General Court. Elevated to its chief justice, he served from 1789 to 1793. He also served as a judge on the Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, later renamed the Virginia Supreme Court, in 1793.

In 1794, Tazewell was elected to the US Senate to fill the vacancy that had been caused by the resignation of John Taylor. Re-elected in 1798, he served from December 29, 1794, to his death. He served as the president pro tempore of the Senate in 1795.

When Tennessee Senator William Blount was impeached on account of treason in 1797, Tazewell cast the lone dissenting vote against Blount&#x27;s expulsion from the Senate. Tazewell was one of four senators to vote against authorizing military force for the Quasi-War.

==Death==
Tazewell died in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on January 24, 1799, and is interred at Christ Church Burial Ground.

Tazewell County, Virginia; Tazewell, Virginia; Tazewell, Tennessee; New Tazewell, Tennessee; and possibly Tazewell County, Illinois are named after him.

<doc id="917941" wikidata="Q47901" url="?curid=917941" title="River Irwell">
<text>The River Irwell ( ) is a tributary of the River Mersey in north-west England. It rises at Irwell Springs on Deerplay Moor, approximately north of Bacup and flows southwards for to meet the Mersey near Irlam Locks. The Irwell marks the boundary between Manchester and Salford, and its lower reaches have been canalised and now form part of the Manchester Ship Canal.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the Irwell&#x27;s lower reaches were a trading route that became part of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation. In the 19th century, the river&#x27;s course downstream of Manchester was permanently altered by the construction of the Manchester Ship Canal which opened in 1896. The canal turned Manchester and Salford into a major inland seaport and led to the development of Trafford Park, which became the largest industrial estate in Europe. Further changes were made in the 20th and 21st centuries to prevent flooding in Manchester and Salford, including the construction of the Anaconda Cut in 1970 and the River Irwell Flood Defence Scheme in 2014.

The river became severely polluted by industrial waste during the Industrial Revolution, but in the second half of the 20th century a number of initiatives were implemented to improve water quality, restock it with fish and create a diverse environment for wildlife. Stretches of the river flowing through Manchester and Salford have attracted large-scale investment in business and residential developments, such as Salford Quays, and other parts have become important wildlife havens. The Irwell is used for recreational activities, such as pleasure cruising, rowing, racing, swimming and fishing.

==Course==
From its source to the confluence with the River Mersey the Irwell is about long. Rising on the moors above Cliviger near the sources of the Lancashire River Calder and the Yorkshire River Calder, it flows south through Bacup, Rawtenstall, Ramsbottom and Bury before merging with the River Roch near Radcliffe. Turning west, it joins the River Croal near Farnworth before turning southeast through Kearsley, Clifton and the Agecroft area of Pendlebury. It then meanders around Lower Kersal and Lower Broughton. It bisects Salford and Manchester, joining the rivers Irk and Medlock, and then turns west toward Irlam, as part of the Manchester Ship Canal. Its course ends just beyond Irlam Locks, where it empties into the Mersey near Flixton.

==Natural history==

Until the early 19th century the Irwell was well-stocked with fish and other wildlife, with people living near Manchester Cathedral using its water for drinking and other domestic purposes. But during the Industrial Revolution, increasing levels of pollution caused by waste products discharged into the river by local industries proved fatal to wildlife, with fish stocks disappearing completely by about 1850. This situation abated somewhat during the 20th century, with a slow improvement in water quality leading to fresh populations of roach, bream and chub, and sightings of brown trout have become increasingly common.

Problems with water quality in some of the former Manchester Docks basins became apparent with the redevelopment of Salford Quays. Years of runoff from sewers and roads had accumulated in the slow running waters of this area and decomposition of organic matter was causing oxygen depletion. In 2001, a compressed air injection system was introduced. This raised the oxygen levels in the water by up to 300%, improving the water quality to such an extent that the number of invertebrate species present increased to more than 30, including freshwater shrimp. Spawning and growth rates of fish species such as roach and perch have also increased, and are now amongst the highest in England.

Two Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSIs) are located close to the banks of the Irwell, near to its confluence with the River Croal at Moses Gate Country Park near Bolton. The first is at Nob End, an 88 800 m2 site which has been designated because of its biological interest, based on the predominance of flora typical of limestone grassland including some nationally rare herbs and orchids. Nob End is also designated as a Local Nature Reserve (LNR). The second site is Ashclough, which is a site of geological interest. These two SSSIs are among the 21 found in Greater Manchester. In Salford the river flows through Clifton Country Park and Kersal Dale Country Park, both of which have been designated as LNRs.

Grey herons, cormorants, mute swans, kingfishers and many species of geese and ducks are regularly sighted on the river. The Manchester Ship Canal near Salford Quays is one of the top ten sites in Britain for diving ducks, providing a winter home to approximately 3,000 common pochard and 2,000 tufted ducks.

==Geology==
From its source until shortly after its confluence with the River Croal, the river runs through a landscape formed from rocks of the late Carboniferous Coal Measures and the underlying (and therefore older) Millstone Grit, consisting mostly of a series of sandstone and shales. The lower sections of the river run through a landscape where the bedrock is of Permian and Triassic age, though alluvial and river terrace deposits often obscure the rock strata. The glaciers of the Pleistocene epoch radically re-shaped the landscape and then retreated, leaving behind deposits of sand, pebbles and boulder clay that formed the fluvioglacial ridges of the lower Irwell Valley. Ashclough, a site which comprises the steep banks of the river between Prestolee and Little Lever, has been designated an SSSI because of its geological interest, primarily because it is the best site in the area displaying the Ashclough marine band and its associated strata. Ashclough is a site of national importance for interpreting the coal measures palaeogeography of Great Britain.

==River Irwell catchment area==
The River Irwell catchment area extends from the moors above Bacup to the Manchester Ship Canal. The climate of the catchment area is wetter than the UK average, with rainfall of per annum compared to per annum, and the rivers quickly respond to rainfall. The topography varies considerably, with the upper reaches dominated by the Pennine moors at an altitude of between AOD and the bottom of the catchment consisting of relatively flat land, which lies between AOD. The watercourses are characterised by steep narrow valleys, which contributes to high rates of run-off, as does the underlying solid geology. This comprises Lower Coal Measures overlying Millstone Grit, both of which are classified as minor aquifers which will only hold relatively small amounts of water. The surface deposits comprise thick peat in the upper reaches, with glacial boulder clay and glacial sand and gravel in the lower parts. The sand and gravel are also classified as a minor aquifer, whilst the boulder clay is a non-aquifer. The higher, steeper slopes of the upper part of the catchment provide a large source of erodible material and debris which is transported downstream to the lower, flatter parts of the catchment. Where the channel is constricted, this material is then deposited and can contribute to a reduction in channel capacity.

==History==
===Etymology===

The origins of the name &quot;Irwell&quot; are uncertain but many accept the Anglo-Saxon origin, &quot;ere-well&quot;, meaning &quot;hoar or white spring&quot;. The first part of the name may also be the Brittonic &quot;*ar&quot;, an ancient river-name element that implies horizontal motion, &quot;flowing&quot;, &quot;rising&quot; or else &quot;springing up&quot;.

===Ancient history===
Flint scrapers, knives and other materials associated with the neolithic period were discovered on Kersal Moor in the late 19th century and early 20th century. There have been isolated finds of artefacts characteristic of this period along the Irwell valley, and a possible hunting site was excavated at Prestwich Golf Course in 1982, which produced a quantity of Late Neolithic and Early Bronze Age flints. Neolithic tools have also been found in the River Roch near Bury and in Radcliffe, and Bronze Age burial sites have been found in Bury and Shuttleworth.

===Celtic, Roman and Medieval===
The first recorded human settlements were those of the Celtic tribe, the Brigantes, who farmed the uplands and lower reaches of the river in the late Iron Age. In AD 79 the Roman Empire conquered these tribes, building forts at the confluences of the Irwell and the rivers Irk and Medlock and naming the town Mamucium. They also built a ford with rectangular stone blocks at Cornbrook, which is thought to be the first man-made structure to span the river. For four hundred years the Pax Romana brought peace, but their withdrawal in AD 410 left the tribes at the mercy of the Saxons, who renamed the town Manigceastre. The Danes later seized, and all-but destroyed Manigceastre, and absorbed what was left of the tribes. The Danelaw ruled until AD 920 when the Norsemen were expelled by Edward the Elder.

In the Middle Ages the town, which was now known as &quot;Manceastre&quot; (later to become Manchester), grew and prospered, and trading vessels plied along the river. The hamlet of Kersal, which now forms part of the City of Salford, was gifted to the Cluniac Priory of Lenton, near Nottingham, in 1142. The most important part of the gift was the fishing rights on the River Irwell, and even in the 18th century, the salmon rights on the rivers of Lancashire were let every year for many hundreds of pounds.

===19th century===
During the Industrial Revolution factories, mills and terraced hovels grew up along the river banks. Joseph Corbett, the Borough Engineer of Salford, wrote in his 1907 book &quot;The River Irwell&quot; of his father Edward&#x27;s experiences around 1819, of seeing &quot;large shoals of fish, chiefly gudgeon but also other fish, rising to the flies&quot; from a vantage point on New Bailey bridge, (now Albert Bridge) in Manchester. Local industry dumped toxic chemicals into the river, such as gas-tar, gas-lime and ammonia water, and by 1850 fish stocks had all but disappeared. In 1860 the Irwell was described as &quot;almost proverbial for the foulness of its waters; receiving the refuse of cotton factories, coal mines, print works, bleach works, dye works, chemical works, paper works, almost every kind of industry.&quot; In 1862 the Scottish geologist Hugh Miller wrote about the Irwell, in his book &quot;First Impressions: The English People&quot;, describing it as:
The hapless river—a pretty enough stream a few miles higher up, with trees overhanging its banks, and fringes of green sedge set thick along its edges—loses caste as it gets among the mills and the printworks. There are myriads of dirty things given it to wash, and whole waggon-loads of poisons from dye-houses and bleachyards thrown into it to carry away; steam-boilers discharge into it their seething contents, and drains and sewers their fetid impurities; till at length it rolls on—here between tall dingy walls, there under precipices of red sandstone—considerably less a river than a flood of liquid manure, in which all life dies, whether animal or vegetable, and which resembles nothing in nature, except, perhaps, the stream thrown out in eruption by some mud-volcano.
In the Victorian era passenger boat trips were popular but cut-short by the foul smells from the river. In 1862 the Corporation of Salford promoted an Act of Parliament enabling them to establish a River Conservancy Committee; they appointed a river inspector, and had to power to take action against anyone polluting the river. The Rivers Pollution Prevention Act 1876 (39 &amp; 40 Vict. c. 75) was designed to solve the problems of river pollution, but it was largely ineffective. It did, however, lay the groundwork for the more draconian legislation which followed, and in 1891 the Mersey and Irwell Joint Committee was formed. Local authorities were ordered to provide sewage treatment facilities, and industrial concerns were told to use the best practical means of preventing pollution. Salford was one of the first authorities in the Irwell watershed to install intercepting sewers and sewage treatment works at Mode Wheel Sewage works.

In the 1830s, there was an ambitious plan to build a reservoir system on the Irwell, in the vein of Robert Thom&#x27;s innovations in hydraulics, in order to provide a more regular supply of water power to mills at a lower cost than steam power. The plan was led by Thomas Ashworth (younger brother of Henry Ashworth) and Peter Ewart. The proposal was to build 15 reservoirs that would contain 241.3 million cubic feet of water and generate at least 6,600 horsepower. The Irwell Reservoirs Bill was submitted to Parliament in November 1832, but it was not passed. The reasons are not entirely known, but are seemingly related to concerns from mill owners about unequal benefits obtained from the plan.

One of the most famous characters associated with the river during this time was Mark Addy, who was born in a tenement on The Parsonage near Blackfriars Bridge in Manchester in 1838. Whenever anyone was in difficulty in the river, the cry would go up &quot;Bring Mark Addy!&quot; and he would race to the rescue. He was awarded a number of medals including the gold and silver medals from the Humane Society for the Hundred of Salford, and the Royal Humane Society&#x27;s bronze medal. In 1878 he became the only civilian ever to be awarded the Albert Medal (first class), His final rescue was on Whit Monday in 1889, when he saved a young boy from a particularly sewage-laden section of the river. After this he became ill, and died of tuberculosis in 1890 aged 51. He had rescued more than 50 people from the river during his lifetime.

===20th century===

In 1939, the Mersey and Irwell Joint Committee was superseded by the Lancashire Rivers Board, but wartime conditions brought about further deterioration of the river. In 1951, the Rivers (Prevention of Pollution) Act was passed and this board disappeared to be replaced by the Mersey River Board, which was replaced in turn by the Mersey and Weaver River Authority in 1965. During a 1950s television documentary entitled River of Irwell, the watercourse was described as &quot;The hardest worked river in the world&quot;.

In 1946, there was serious flooding in Salford, caused by a bottleneck at a bend in the river at Strangeways, on the border with Manchester. Flooding had been a problem for hundreds of years, and, in 1946, the decision was made to straighten and widen the river to increase its capacity. Work started in 1951 but it was not until September 1970 that water first flowed through the Anaconda Cut. The total cost of the project was £2m.

In a question to the House of Commons in 1950 the Member of Parliament for Rossendale, Mr. Anthony Greenwood, highlighted the lamentable condition of the Irwell and one of its main tributaries, the River Roch:
Today I am afraid that fish in most of those rivers are virtually extinct. Anybody who stands today in the City of Manchester outside the Exchange Station and looks down at the noisome black water which flows beneath him would find it difficult to believe that any fish, or any other living creature, could ever have lived in what the &quot;Manchester Guardian&quot; has so rightly called that &quot;melancholy stream&quot;... I have had my differences with the British Field Sports Society, but I have nothing but admiration for the excellent series of reports on river pollution which have been prepared for that Society... and ventured to suggest that they should make a similar survey of the Rivers Irwell and Roach. These two rivers were covered by the third report; and very sorry reading it made. There are two passages in that report which I should like to read. The first says: &quot;The banks are lined with factories, large and small, many of which take their water from the drainage of the hills forming the slopes of the river&#x27;s valley, and discharge it as a polluted effluent, either into the small feeders, or the main river itself, so it may be said that no natural water normally enters the river from its cradle in the moors to its grave in the Manchester Ship Canal.&quot; The second quotation is one which I find still more appalling than the first. It is: &quot;There are no fish in these rivers (apart from a very occasional tributary), no insects, no weeds, no life of any kind except sewage fungus, nothing but chemicals and any dirt which cannot be put to profitable use. Sewage effluents (and, being usually very good, they are the most encouraging feature of the appalling situation) are hailed with delight as being the purest water which the rivers hold.&quot; The full importance of that statement will be realised when I remind hon. Members of the frequency with which residents in Bacup, Ramsbottom, Manchester and Salford are subjected to flooding from the waters of the Irwell.

In 1951, it was announced that flood defence works were to be carried out on the stretch of the river passing through Lower Broughton between Cromwell Bridge and Gerald Road Bridge, although local property owners and shopkeepers were outraged at being asked to bear part of the cost. Work on the concrete wall did not get underway until June 1952 and was still only nearing completion when, in August 1957, nearby homes were threatened by flooding during heavy rain.

====1970s====

A report in the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; in 1971 stated that Bury Angling Society had signed an agreement with Bury Corporation giving them fishing rights along of the river between Summerseat and Radcliffe. The secretary of the society was quoted as saying:
Extensive tests have been carried out on fish we put in the river and we are satisfied that the water will support fish life. Roach and perch have already been caught and we have had no reports of any ill-effects. There is no doubt the pollution is clearing. It will be a long job, but we are sure there is a future for angling in the river.

The report went on to state that the society &quot;intends to carry out stocking operations soon&quot;. In 1972 the newspaper reported that &quot;tiddlers&quot; (small fish) had been seen swimming in the &quot;notorious inky Irwell&quot; near Peel Park, Salford. The Deputy chief water quality officer for Salford, Mr. Eric Harper, said:
Ten years ago, any fish getting as far down as Salford would have been killed almost immediately by the pollution in the water. Although the river there is now a great deal better than it has been for 100 years, fish will probably not be able to live long. These had probably got into the main river from small streams flowing into the Irwell. But I think it is real progress.

Mr Harper went on to say that the Irwell had been well stocked with fish along its whole length 100 years ago but refused to guess when it would reach the same state again. In 1974 all of the river authorities were merged into the Regional Water Authorities. In the 1974 annual report of the North West Water Authority (NWWA), it was said that the river &quot;once internationally famous, or infamous as the epitome of river pollution, is now in a much better state as compared with its condition at the time of a special survey carried out nine years ago.&quot; This was reported in an article in &quot;The Manchester Evening News&quot; on 26 October of that year which stated that:
During nine years of pollution control work reviewed by the North West Water Authority, the biggest improvement had been in the Bolton District, where effluent from five dilapidated sewage plants and two paper mills were now being treated at the Ringley Fold Works [but] there has been little reduction in pollution from the river Roch. At Bacup the headwater of the Irwell is discoloured by ochre deposits from a disused mine but work is being done to stop the ochre seepage. Fish do exist in the stretch between Rossendale and Bury and fish are to be introduced in stretches between Radcliffe and Manchester. However, it is feared that it will be many years before fish will be able to breed freely in the river.

====1980s====
In 1980, a scheme for improving a section of the river between Littleton Road and Adelphi Weir in Salford for boating purposes was included in Greater Manchester Policy Committee&#x27;s capital programme for 1981/82. County Councillors at a recent committee meeting had criticised the condition of the river, with the councillor for the Metropolitan Borough of Oldham calling it &quot;quite revolting and horrible&quot;. A spokesperson for the NWWA said that, although the river had a reputation for being polluted, it was getting much better but still had not reached a state where they would be satisfied. She added that tests were being carried out to show the improved cleanliness of the Irwell and that 600 trout had recently been put in the river at Summerseat, near Bury. The proposals were welcomed by both Salford University and Agecroft Rowing Club, with the university stating that they wished to use that section for their boat race. Later that year it was reported that hundreds of trees and shrubs were to be planted along the banks of the Irwell between Broughton and Pomona Dock in a £650,000 &quot;green finger&quot; scheme to &quot;bring the countryside into the heart of industrial Salford&quot;. The dossier outlining the scheme, prepared by Salford&#x27;s Technical Services Officer, emphasised the &quot;bleak character&quot; of the Irwell Valley with &quot;many constructions by the river that are decaying and rotting&quot; and said &quot;the main problems are caused by an excess of ammonia and a high organic content from sewage effluents which discharge into the water upstream.&quot; The report recommended that &quot;even more support should be given to the NWWA in their pollution control of the River Irwell.&quot;

Throughout the 1980s, sightings of fish as far downstream as Manchester city centre were reported in local newspapers. In February 1981 the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; reported that &quot;ten jacksharps [sticklebacks], about two inches long&quot; had been spotted by a site manager working on the Mark Addy public house, which was then being built on the disused New Bailey Landing Stage, below New Bailey Street, on the border of Manchester and Salford. Plans for developing the river for recreational use were also coming to fruition as it was reported in 1982 that, over the May bank holiday, the first pleasure cruise on the river in the 20th century would leave from the Mark Addy as part of a three-day experiment to see whether river cruises could be a success. In 1983 over 100 canal and river boats rode the flooded river for the Greater Manchester Waterways Festival, an event aimed at demonstrating how pleasure boating could &quot;transform the bleak waterway in the heart of Manchester&quot;. By 1984 two local men felt the waters were clean enough for them to brave a ten-mile (16 km) charity fund-raising swim from Clifton to Manchester, although they were warned by a spokesman for the North West Water Authority that the cocktail of effluent and occasional untreated sewage meant that the Irwell was still &quot;a class 4 river – top of the pollution chart&quot;. During 1985 the Croal–Irwell Valley local plan was launched, listing 187 proposals for the improvement of the valley and in 1986 the Mersey Basin Campaign was announced. The campaign was to cover a large area, from Rossendale in the north to Crewe in the south, and it was promised that £67m would be made available in the first three years for water- and land-based projects. In September 1987 plans were revealed for a mile-long landscaped walkway in Manchester city centre and developers announced plans to develop three bricked-up railway arches on the side of the river, opposite Manchester Cathedral, into a wine bar and restaurant. In 1988 Manchester&#x27;s first water bus made its maiden voyage from the New Bailey Landing Stage, then known as the Mark Addy Quay, on a five-mile (8 km) inaugural round trip to Salford Quays By the end of the 1980s ambitious plans had been announced to turn Manchester into a top international tourist centre &quot;mainly based on the derelict areas around the waterways of Manchester, Salford and Trafford – the Irwell, the Irk, the ship canal and the Bridgewater Canal...bringing £500m of investment and 13,000 new jobs over the next 10 years&quot;. The Manchester Ship Canal Company also announced a £70 million redevelopment scheme for Pomona Docks in Salford, to include a marina, homes, offices and other commercial developments.

====1990s====

In 1990, the newly formed Mersey and Irwell Packet Company launched regular tourist trips along the river from a landing stage opposite the Granada Studios Tour entrance in Quay Street, taking in the stretch from Castlefield to Salford Quays. This was not universally welcomed as, by September of that year, a retired chemical engineer claimed that the pleasure boat was &quot;leaving clouds of methane in its wake as it disturbed sediment on the river bed&quot;. However, in 1991 a feature article appeared in the magazine &quot;Lancashire Life&quot; extolling the virtues of the cruise, and stating that the Irwell &quot;once thought a liability is in fact a major asset to urban regeneration ... now the twin cities compete to befriend her, to dress her in finery and proudly introduce her back into society. And the public are cordially invited back onto her waters.&quot; During 1994, construction work began on a new £1.3M footbridge to link Manchester and Salford, to be known as Trinity Bridge. The box-girder and steel cable construction was designed by Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava to represent a ship in full sail as the centrepiece of the £50M Chapel Wharf Regeneration Scheme, which was expected to breathe new life into a run-down area of Salford and to create up to 8,000 new jobs. In May 1995 a new long multimillion-pound arts trail, to be known as the Irwell Sculpture Trail, was reported in the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; and in June 1997 work began on the £10 million Lower Irwell Valley Flood Defence Scheme in Lower Kersal.

===21st century===

In July 2000 there was a setback for the clean-up programme when a pollution incident affected approximately of the river between Rawtenstall and Ramsbottom, causing the death of more than 36,000 fish. The large number of fish killed did however serve to illustrate how much the river had improved from the lifeless, &quot;melancholy stream&quot; of the 1950s. In 2005 a £1M project to make the river &quot;the cleanest it has been for decades&quot; was announced by United Utilities. The improvements included fitting filters on sewers in Lower Broughton to ensure litter was not washed into the river, as part of a scheme to improve overflows across Adlington, Wigan, Chorley, Rochdale and Bury. Then in October 2008 United Utilities announced that work on the Ringley Fold Wastewater Works in Stoneclough, to be completed by the end of the year, should increase the number of fish in the river and &quot;massively improve the environment locally so walkers, canoeists and anglers will all reap the benefits.&quot; The company said that this was to be the biggest scheme that they had undertaken in the region, and the project manager was quoted as saying:
Reducing the amount of phosphate in the water is the main driver behind the scheme. New legislation states that the amount of phosphate in waste water should be one milligram per litre because it causes water to clog with algae and reduces the amount of oxygen in the water, which results in less aquatic life and fish.

The treatment plant, which was built in the 1930s and last updated in the 1970s, treats waste water from a population of half a million, from Bolton, Prestwich, Whitefield and Clifton.

There was another pollution incident in March 2008 when twenty miles of the river turned orange. Iron oxide from old mine workings near the source at Irwell Springs had polluted the water since 1969 and in 1997 a Coal Authority survey identified the stretch as having the fourth worst case of minewater pollution in the country. A treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove the pollution at a cost of £1M; however, it is thought that there was a collapse in the mine after heavy rains in the spring of 2008. Although the water was stained with ochre, no damage to wildlife was reported.

==Commerce==
===Mersey and Irwell Navigation===

In the late 17th century, the Warrington businessman Thomas Patten had made the River Mersey navigable as far as Warrington and suggested that there would be significant commercial value in extending this along the Irwell as far as Manchester. In 1721, Parliament authorised the alteration with the Mersey and Irwell Navigation Act, and by 1736 work had been completed by creating eight canal locks along the route from Warrington to Manchester, allowing access to boats of up to 51 tonnes. The waterway, which became known as the Mersey &amp; Irwell Navigation, played a central role in the cotton industry of the 18th century that spearheaded the Industrial Revolution.

===Bridgewater Canal===

When Francis Egerton, 3rd Duke of Bridgewater built the Bridgewater Canal, the task of crossing the Irwell was one of the main obstacles he faced. The solution was to build a canal-carrying bridge across the river, the first barge aqueduct in England. The aqueduct, which opened in 1761, measured high and long, and became one of the wonders of the age. The Mersey and Irwell Navigation and the Bridgewater Canal competed for trade to and from Manchester for the next 120 years and specially designed barges with a shallow draft, known as &quot;Mersey flats&quot;, were used on both waterways. Over the years both trade and rivalry continued to grow with each company offering reduced freight charges or special rates and concessions to gain business from the other. The most important cargo carried was raw cotton from Liverpool to Manchester but timber, dyewoods, pig iron, lead, copper, nails, tar, sand, grain and flour were also carried. Passenger services had been operating on the Bridgewater Canal for some years and in 1807 the Irwell and Mersey Navigation Company began to compete with daily services between Runcorn and Manchester. In 1816 they began to use packet steamers. However, in 1830 the Liverpool and Manchester Railway opened; packet boat services went into decline, and ceased to operate completely in the 1860s. In Manchester two other canals used the Irwell as a point of access: the Manchester Bolton &amp; Bury Canal from 1809, and the Manchester and Salford Junction Canal from 1839. The previous year, the short Hulme Locks Branch Canal had also connected the Irwell to the Bridgewater Canal at Castlefield. All are now non-navigable, although the first is under restoration.
===Manchester Ship Canal===
As the 19th century progressed, the increasing need for large freight carriers led to Liverpool&#x27;s dominance as a port. Manchester became increasingly reliant on its Merseyside neighbour for its imports and exports, but the handling charges and dues charged by the Mersey Docks and Harbour Board made goods from Manchester uncompetitive. A solution was to build the Manchester Ship Canal. In 1887 the Bridgewater Navigation Company was purchased by the Manchester Ship Canal Company with a cheque for £1,710,000, which was at the time the largest cheque ever written, and the building of the Manchester Ship Canal began.
The canal, which was made by greatly deepening and widening the eastern section of the Mersey and Irwell Navigation, opened on 1 January 1894. It reduced the shipping costs of raw cotton to the mills and the dispatching the finished cloth overseas. The canal had helped the region to become the centre of the Industrial Revolution, and it had transformed Manchester into England&#x27;s third largest port, despite being inland. As the canal was built, it became clear that Brindley&#x27;s famous aqueduct would have to be demolished, as it allowed insufficient headroom for the freighters that the canal would carry. Fortunately, in 1896 the councillors of Eccles paid to have the aqueduct moved to the spot it occupies today, alongside the canal. The Bridgewater Canal is now carried over the Manchester Ship Canal by the equally celebrated Barton Swing Aqueduct, which was completed in 1893 with the novel idea of &quot;opening&quot; by rotating 90 degrees to allow ships to pass.

The construction of the Manchester Ship Canal and the Manchester Docks led to the development of Trafford Park as the largest industrial estate in Europe, and brought employment to the area for the next eighty years. By the 1960s however, the UK had begun to lose its position as an industrial world power. By the mid-20th century, the UK cotton industry had gone into decline because of low-cost competition from Asian manufacturers. The decline of heavy industry in the area, the increasing size of freight-carrying ships, and competition from road transport, brought about the decline of the terminal docks at Salford, which closed in 1982.

==River Irwell flood defence scheme==

The lower reaches of the Irwell have flooded many times in its history, the most well documented being the floods of 1866, 1946, 1954, 1980, 2007, 2015 and 2020. In December 1816 rapidly thawing snow caused the river to flood, sweeping away a considerable amount of property including building materials and livestock. Locals reported the height of the river to have been almost as great as a more serious flood of 1768. A local public house, the &quot;Black Boy&quot;, suffered extensive damage as the water caused the rear wall to collapse, a local brewery was flooded with the loss of all its stock, and a Mersey Flat came free of its moorings, hitting Regent Bridge. In 1866, the &quot;year of the great Flood&quot;, rain fell for three continuous days commencing on Tuesday 13 November. By the end of the first day, the river had risen above normal at Peel Park, street lamps could not be lit and mills were brought to a stop. In all, £1 million of property was damaged, 450 hectares of land was flooded, 700 people had to be rescued from wrecked homes, but only one man died by drowning. The height of the flood was marked by an obelisk erected in Peel Park. The construction of the ship canal is said to have reduced the risk of flooding, by providing a larger outlet below Regent bridge. In 1946 in Salford 5,300 properties were flooded, and 600 were flooded in 1954.

To alleviate such problems two flood storage basins with a capacity of have been constructed to the west of Littleton Road, Kersal, at a cost of around £11 million. As part of the River Irwell Flood Defence Scheme, the defences help to protect some 3,000 properties in Kersal and Lower Broughton against a 1 in 75 year flood. Concerns have been raised that a 1 in a 100-year flood would breach these defences and cause some £55 million damage to property. The defences proved successful on 22 January 2008, when the worst flooding to hit the region in thirty years caused the Irwell to burst its banks further downstream in the centre of Manchester.

On 2 February 2018 the Environment Agency announced the completion of A£10 million extension to the flood defence scheme which will protect almost 2,000 homes and businesses and has created more than 5 hectares of high quality urban wetland habitat. The new development also provides a new footpath around the site which links to existing footpaths to provide a green route to and from the centre of Manchester. The 28 hectare flood basin will protect surrounding properties by holding up to 650 million litres of water during flood conditions. The scheme, utilises an &#x27;offline&#x27; storage basin, created in a meander of the Irwell on the site of the old Manchester Racecourse, that will work in tandem with the existing flood storage area at Littleton Road. The embankment around the basin features an inlet to allow the controlled spill of water into the basin when river levels are high. Water will then be stored in the basin during a flood and released back into the river once the water level has dropped. The flood embankments have also been planted with 10 hectares of wildflower habitat, to attract pollinating species such as moths, butterflies and bees.

==Regeneration==

A large urban regeneration project, The Salford Quays Development Plan, was published in 1985 and work began a few years later to redevelop the site for residential, business and leisure purposes. The Salford Quays waterside development has made living by the Irwell, and the Manchester Ship Canal into which it flows, fashionable once again.

There are further plans to &quot;turn the tide on the years of neglect and once again embrace the River Irwell as a fundamental part of Manchester and Salford&#x27;s heritage and future economic and social growth. The vision is to reinvent the central Manchester conurbation as the major waterfront destination in Northern England.&quot; A number of key stakeholders are involved in the development of this regeneration vision. These include Manchester, Salford and Trafford councils, Manchester Ship Canal Company, Environment Agency, Mersey Basin Campaign, local businesses, landowners, community groups and the wider Manchester, Salford and Trafford
communities.

===Irwell City Park===
In 2007 Manchester City Council, Salford City Council and Trafford Metropolitan Borough Council prepared planning guidance to support the delivery of a project for the restoration of the river and creation of a new urban park, to be called &quot;Irwell City Park&quot;. The intention is to develop of riverside between The Meadows and Peel Park in the north, through Salford and Manchester city centres, Ordsall and Pomona Dock areas, around to Salford Quays and Trafford Wharfside. The three authorities formally adopted the draft Planning Guidance in March 2008. The Guidance sets out the guidelines that the councils will use as a material consideration in determining applications for planning permission and other matters in the Irwell City Park area. It also establishes a set of principles to ensure the provision of a continuous riverside cycle/walkway, and the high quality design of new public open spaces and other infrastructure. An application is to be made to the North West Development Agency in October 2008 to support pre-project implementation work, including design and technical feasibility work.

==Sport on the Irwell==
Rowing has existed along the river in Manchester and Salford since 1823. A regatta was inaugurated on 12 September 1842 on a straight course from Throstle&#x27;s Nest Weir to Regent Road Bridge. Racing continued in Manchester with events such as Agecroft Regatta and Warburton Regatta. At the turn of the 20th century, rowing was very popular in the area with many local clubs such as Nemesis, Prince of Wales, Minerva, Didsbury and Agecroft all competing regularly. With the decline in the condition of the water, by the Second World War only Agecroft and Broughton rowing clubs were still active.

Agecroft Rowing Club was formed in 1861, making it one of the oldest open membership rowing clubs in the world. The club was originally based in the grounds of Agecroft Hall and then a short distance downstream at Littleton Road. However, the river became impossible for eight&#x27;s and fours to pass due to the encroachment of weeds and river life following the clean up of the environment. The club now operates from a boat house next to the Salford Watersports Centre at Salford Quays, which it has shared with the University of Salford Boat Club since 2004. The boat house, which the sport&#x27;s governing body, British Rowing, has nominated as the North West Centre of Excellence, also hosts the Two Cities Boat Race, which has been held on the river since 1972.

This river is home to the &quot;Salford Friendly Anglers&#x27; Society&quot;, the oldest angling society in the world, founded in 1817.

==Tributaries==

Moving upstream from the Mersey confluence, the tributaries include the following:

*Platts Brook
*Bent Lanes Brook
**Longford Brook

<text>(Robert) Gordon Robertson, (May 19, 1917 – January 15, 2013) was the commissioner of the Northwest Territories from November 15, 1953 to July 12, 1963 who, having been sworn in at the age of 36, remains the youngest person to ever hold the office. He went on to become Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to the Cabinet, the top position in the Canadian public service.

== Biography ==
Born in Davidson, Saskatchewan, Robertson was educated at University of Saskatchewan, Exeter College, Oxford (where he was a Rhodes Scholar) and University of Toronto. He joined the Department of External Affairs in 1941. From 1945 to 1948 he worked in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office of William Lyon Mackenzie King, and from 1948 to 1953 he was in the Privy Council Office under Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent. In 1953 he was appointed Deputy Minister of the newly formed Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources. By virtue of that position he was also Commissioner of the Northwest Territories. He remained in this combination of positions until 1963, when incoming Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson appointed him Clerk of the Privy Council and Secretary to the Cabinet, the top position in the Canadian public service. He held this position under Pearson and then under Pierre Trudeau until 1975. In that year, Trudeau appointed him Secretary to the Cabinet for Federal-Provincial Relations, to support Trudeau in his constitutional reform agenda. He remained in that position for most of the government of Joe Clark, retiring in December 1979.

Awarded an honorary doctorate of laws from the University of Saskatchewan for outstanding service with the Department of Northern Affairs and National Resources and Commissioner of the Northwest Territories Council in 1959. In 1970, he won the Vanier Medal of the Institute of Public Administration of Canada.

Robertson was a recipient of the Public Service Outstanding Achievement Award in 1972; in 1976 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada, and a member of the Privy Council in 1982.

Robertson served as chancellor of Carleton University in Ottawa from 1980 to 1990.

In 2000, Robertson published &quot;Memoirs of a Very Civil Servant&quot;, which recounted his experiences as a senior civil servant under five Canadian Prime Ministers.

In 2022, in association with the Inuit Advisory Council and Inuit in the region and in the North, Carleton University re-named Robertson Hall (named after Robertson) to Pigiarvik (ᐱᒋᐊᕐᕕᒃ), which is an Inuit name that translates to “a place to begin” or “the starting place.&quot;
==Personal life==
Robertson was born to John Gordon Robertson and Lydia A. Paulson. A prominent leader in Saskatchewan John Gordon Robertson served as Live Stock Commissioner in the province of Saskatchewan following his service in the Great War. Additionally John Robertson held many administrative offices in the province and served on several boards and organisations. Robert Gordon Robertson had one brother, former chairman of the CDIC, Ronald Neil Robertson, and one sister, Jessie Lucille Robertson.

The Honourable Robert Gordon Robertson died on January 15, 2013.

<doc id="917954" wikidata="Q7009927" url="?curid=917954" title="New Lost City Ramblers">
<text>The New Lost City Ramblers, or NLCR, was an American contemporary old-time string band that formed in New York City in 1958 during the folk revival. Mike Seeger, John Cohen and Tom Paley were its founding members. Tracy Schwarz replaced Paley, who left the group in 1962. Seeger died of cancer in 2009, Paley died in 2017, and Cohen died in 2019. NLCR participated in the old-time music revival, and directly influenced many later musicians.

==Career==
The Ramblers distinguished themselves by focusing on the traditional playing styles they heard on old 78rpm records of musicians recorded during the 1920s and 1930s, many of whom had earlier appeared on the &quot;Anthology of American Folk Music&quot;. The New Lost City Ramblers refused to &quot;sanitize&quot; these southern sounds as did other folk groups of the time, such as the Weavers or Kingston Trio. Instead, the Ramblers have always strived for an &quot;authentic&quot; sound. However, the Ramblers did not merely copy the old recordings that inspired them. Rather, they would use the various old-time styles they encountered while at the same time not becoming slaves to imitation.

The Ramblers named themselves in response to a request by Moe Asch, based on 
an amalgam of a favorite tune, J. E. Mainer&#x27;s &quot;New Lost Train Blues&quot;; a favorite group, Charlie Poole and the North Carolina Ramblers; and a reference to the urban settings in which they played old-timey music.

On &quot;Songs from the Depression&quot;, the New Lost City Ramblers performed a variety of popular political songs from the New Deal days, all but one of them taken from commercially issued 78s, and that one is &quot;Keep Moving&quot;, identified in the album notes only as &quot;from Tony Schwartz&#x27;s collection — singer unidentified&quot; when actually it is by Agnes &quot;Sis&quot; Cunningham, the full title being &quot;How Can You Keep On Moving (Unless You Migrate Too)&quot;. The omission later caused Ry Cooder, who listened to the Ramblers album, to record the song as Traditional on the first edition of his &quot;Into the Purple Valley&quot; album, an omission he gladly corrected when informed of it. Cooder also covered another song from the same New Lost City Ramblers album, which he may have heard on a poorly labeled cassette copy: &quot;Taxes on the Farmer Feeds Us All&quot; which the New Lost City Ramblers credit to Fiddling John Carson but which the Cooder notes still list as &quot;traditional&quot;. The same is true of the track &quot;Boomer&#x27;s Story&quot;, covered by the Ramblers—Cooder credits it as &quot;traditional&quot;, but the song was written by Carson Robison and first recorded by him in 1929 under the title &quot;The Railroad Boomer&quot;.
In his autobiography, &quot;&quot;, Bob Dylan described the impression the Ramblers made on him when he heard their records in 1960:

The group drifted apart during the latter half of the 1960s. Schwarz and Seeger performed with different musicians and together formed the short lived Strange Creek Singers.

The New Lost City Ramblers&#x27; extensive recordings for the Folkways label became, after the death of Moe Asch, part of the Smithsonian Institution, which reissues Folkways titles on CD.

John Cohen is said to have inspired the titular John of the Grateful Dead&#x27;s 1970 song &quot;Uncle John&#x27;s Band&quot;.

<text>Data envelopment analysis (DEA) is a nonparametric method in operations research and economics for the estimation of production frontiers. DEA has been applied in a large range of fields including international banking, economic sustainability, police department operations, and logistical applications Additionally, DEA has been used to assess the performance of natural language processing models, and it has found other applications within machine learning.

==Description==
DEA is used to empirically measure productive efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs). Although DEA has a strong link to production theory in economics, the method is also used for benchmarking in operations management, whereby a set of measures is selected to benchmark the performance of manufacturing and service operations. In benchmarking, the efficient DMUs, as defined by DEA, may not necessarily form a “production frontier”, but rather lead to a “best-practice frontier.”

In contrast to parametric methods that require the &quot;ex-ante&quot; specification of a production- or cost-function, non-parametric approaches compare feasible input and output combinations based on the available data only. DEA, one of the most commonly used non-parametric methods, owes its name to its enveloping property of the dataset&#x27;s efficient DMUs, where the empirically observed, most efficient DMUs constitute the production frontier against which all DMUs are compared. DEA&#x27;s popularity stems from its relative lack of assumptions, the ability to benchmark multi-dimensional inputs and outputs as well as its computational ease owing to it being expressable as a linear program, despite its task to calculate efficiency ratios.

==History==
Building on the ideas of Farrell, the 1978 work &quot;Measuring the efficiency of decision-making units&quot; by Charnes, Cooper &amp; Rhodes applied linear programming to estimate, for the first time, an empirical, production-technology frontier. In Germany, the procedure had earlier been used to estimate the marginal productivity of R&amp;D and other factors of production. Since then, there have been a large number of books and journal articles written on DEA or about applying DEA to various sets of problems.

Starting with the CCR model, named after Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes, many extensions to DEA have been proposed in the literature. They range from adapting implicit model assumptions such as input and output orientation, distinguishing technical and allocative efficiency, adding limited disposability
of inputs/outputs or varying returns-to-scale to techniques that utilize DEA results and extend them for more sophisticated analyses, such as stochastic DEA or cross-efficiency analysis.

==Techniques==
In a one-input, one-output scenario, efficiency is merely the ratio of output over input that can be produced, while comparing several entities/DMUs based on it is trivial. However, when adding more inputs or outputs the efficiency computation becomes more complex. Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (1978) in their basic DEA model (the CCR) define the objective function to find formula_1 efficiency formula_2 as:

:formula_3

where the formula_1 known formula_5 outputs formula_6 are multiplied by their respective weights formula_7 and divided by the formula_8 inputs formula_9 multiplied by their respective weights formula_10.

The efficiency score formula_11 is sought to be maximized, under the constraints that using those weights on each formula_12, no efficiency score exceeds one:

:formula_13

and all inputs, outputs and weights have to be non-negative. To allow for linear optimization, one typically constrains either the sum of outputs or the sum of inputs to equal a fixed value (typically 1. See later for an example).

Because this optimization problem&#x27;s dimensionality is equal to the sum of its inputs and outputs, selecting the smallest number of inputs/outputs that collectively, accurately capture the process one attempts to characterize is crucial. And because the production frontier envelopment is done empirically, several guidelines exist on the minimum required number of DMUs for good discriminatory power of the analysis, given homogeneity of the sample. This minimum number of DMUs varies between twice the sum of inputs and outputs (formula_14) and twice the product of inputs and outputs (formula_15).

Some advantages of the DEA approach are:
* no need to explicitly specify a mathematical form for the production function
* capable of handling multiple inputs and outputs
* capable of being used with any input-output measurement, although ordinal variables remain tricky
* the sources of inefficiency can be analysed and quantified for every evaluated unit
* using the dual of the optimization problem identifies which DMU is evaluating itself against which other DMUs

Some of the disadvantages of DEA are:
* results are sensitive to the selection of inputs and outputs
* high-efficiency values can be obtained by being truly efficient or having a niche combination of inputs/outputs
* the number of efficient firms on the frontier increases with the number of inputs and output variables
* a DMU&#x27;s efficiency scores may be obtained by using non-unique combinations of weights on the input and/or output factors

==Example==
Assume that we have the following data:

* Unit 1 produces 100 items per day, and the inputs per item are 10 dollars for materials and 2 labour-hours
* Unit 2 produces 80 items per day, and the inputs are 8 dollars for materials and 4 labour-hours
* Unit 3 produces 120 items per day, and the inputs are 12 dollars for materials and 1.5 labour-hours

To calculate the efficiency of unit 1, we define the objective function (OF) as

*formula_16

which is subject to (ST) all efficiency of other units (efficiency cannot be larger than 1):

*Efficiency of unit 1: formula_17 
*Efficiency of unit 2: formula_18 
*Efficiency of unit 3: formula_19

and non-negativity:

*formula_20

A fraction with decision variables in the numerator and denominator is nonlinear. Since we are using a linear programming technique, we need to linearize the formulation, such that the denominator of the objective function is constant (in this case 1), then maximize the numerator.

The new formulation would be:

* OF
**formula_21
*ST
** Efficiency of unit 1: formula_22
** Efficiency of unit 2: formula_23
** Efficiency of unit 3: formula_24
**Denominator of nonlinear OF&quot;:&quot; formula_25
** Non-negativity: formula_20

==Extensions==
A desire to improve upon DEA by reducing its disadvantages or strengthening its advantages has been a major cause for discoveries in the recent literature. The currently most often DEA-based method to obtain unique efficiency rankings is called &quot;cross-efficiency.&quot; Originally developed by Sexton et al. in 1986, it found widespread application ever since Doyle and Green&#x27;s 1994 publication. Cross-efficiency is based on the original DEA results, but implements a secondary objective where each DMU peer-appraises all other DMU&#x27;s with its own factor weights. The average of these peer-appraisal scores is then used to calculate a DMU&#x27;s cross-efficiency score. This approach avoids DEA&#x27;s disadvantages of having multiple efficient DMUs and potentially non-unique weights. Another approach to remedy some of DEA&#x27;s drawbacks is Stochastic DEA, which synthesizes DEA and Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA).

<text>Major-General Hugh Andrew Young (3 April 1898 – 21 January 1982) was a Canadian military officer and civil servant who served as the commissioner of the Northwest Territories from 1950 to 1953.

==Military career==
Young was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, to Andrew Young and Emma Florence Nesbitt, and was of Irish descent. He graduated from the University of Manitoba became joining the military, serving in the Yukon and Arctic. Once while facing starvation in the extreme north, he boiled and ate his Mukluks. During the First World War, he served with distinction with the Canadian Expeditionary Force.

In the Second World War, Young became a senior staff officer at the Canadian Military Headquarters in London. From 1942 to 1943, he commanded the 6th Canadian Infantry Brigade. From 1943 to 1944, he served on the general staff of II Canadian Corps, before returning to command of the 6th Brigade for the rest of the war. Following the end of the war, Young oversaw the return of Canadian forces to Canada and succeeded without any stray casualties. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order in October 1944 and, by now a major general, appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) over a year later in June 1946, a year after having been appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE).

Young retired from the army in 1947 and joined the Civil Service at the request of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent.

He was Commissioner of the Northwest Territories from November 14, 1950, to November 15, 1953. He was Deputy Minister of Public Works for 10 years until 1963, serving under five different Ministers of Public Works.

He died in Ottawa in 1982.

<text>Bala&#x27;s Museum, officially with the sub-name &quot;With Memories Of Lucy Maud Montgomery&quot;, is a museum located in Bala, Ontario, Canada. It is owned and operated by Jack Hutton and Linda Hutton.

The museum was formerly a boarding house operated by Fanny Pike at the beginnings of the 1900s and now houses artifacts from the Muskoka region from its founding by Thomas Burgess as well as those pertaining to Lucy Maud Montgomery, the author of the &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; series and &quot;The Blue Castle&quot;. It is the only museum of its kind outside of Prince Edward Island to do so. It sees visitors from around the world regularly, especially for the annual &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot; Day, with re-enactments of Montgomery&#x27;s two-week visit to the region in 1922.

==Origins==

While on their honeymoon in Prince Edward Island, Linda and Jack Hutton discovered that Montgomery visited Bala for two weeks in 1922. The Tree Lawn Tourist Home, where Montgomery ate her meals while visiting the region, had been for sale for six years, and the couple bought the building to prevent its destruction. The couple opened a museum dedicated to Montgomery on July 24, 1992. It was the first museum to focus on Montgomery&#x27;s life and her work in Ontario.

==Collections==

The museum features dioramas depicting scenes from Montgomery&#x27;s book &quot;Anne of Green Gables&quot;. The museum also displays a first-edition copy and foreign language translations of the &quot;Green Gables&quot; book. A copy of &quot;The Delineator&quot; from 1905, featuring a painting of Montgomery by George Gibbs, is also part of the museum&#x27;s collection. This painting is used as the front cover illustration of various editions of the &quot;Green Gables&quot; book.

The museum&#x27;s most expensive acquisition is the original sheet music from the 1919 Anne of Green Gables film. They bought the sheet music from eBay, discovering after the auction that they were bidding against the National Library of Canada. Although the film was destroyed, the museum has acquired film stills from the production of the movie.

The collection also includes items from Montgomery&#x27;s life, including a silver tea set gifted to Montgomery for her 1911 wedding, a basket where the author kept her letters and excerpts from her diary during her visit to Bala.

==Historical designation==

In 2013, the museum was designated as a historical site by the township of Muskoka Lakes.

<doc id="917982" wikidata="Q2916178" url="?curid=917982" title="Socratic problem">
<text>In historical scholarship, the Socratic problem (also called Socratic question) concerns attempts at reconstructing a historical and philosophical image of Socrates based on the variable, and sometimes contradictory, nature of the existing sources on his life. Scholars rely upon extant sources, such as those of contemporaries like Aristophanes or disciples of Socrates like Plato and Xenophon, for knowing anything about Socrates. However, these sources contain contradictory details of his life, words, and beliefs when taken together. This complicates the attempts at reconstructing the beliefs and philosophical views held by the historical Socrates. It has become apparent to scholarship that this problem is seemingly impossible to clarify and thus perhaps now classified as unsolvable. Early proposed solutions to the matter still pose significant problems today. 

Socrates was the main character in most of Plato&#x27;s dialogues and was a genuine historical figure. It is widely understood that in later dialogues, Plato used the character Socrates to give voice to views that were his own. Besides Plato, three other important sources exist for the study of Socrates: Aristophanes, Aristotle, and Xenophon. Since no writings by Socrates himself survive to the modern era, his actual views must be discerned from the sometimes contradictory reports of these four sources. The main sources for the historical Socrates are the &quot;Sokratikoi logoi&quot;, or Socratic dialogues, which are reports of conversations apparently involving Socrates. Most information is found in the works of Plato and Xenophon.

There are also four sources extant in fragmentary states: Aeschines of Sphettus, Antisthenes, Euclid of Megara, and Phaedo of Elis. In addition, there are two satirical commentaries on Socrates. One is Aristophanes&#x27;s play &quot;The Clouds&quot;, which humorously attacks Socrates. The other is two fragments from the &quot;Silloi&quot; by the Pyrrhonist philosopher Timon of Phlius, satirizing dogmatic philosophers.

== Xenophon ==

There are four works of Xenophon that deal with Socrates. They are &quot;Apology of Socrates to the Jurors&quot; (which apparently reports the defence given by Socrates in court), &quot;Memorabilia&quot; (which is a defence of Socrates and so-called Socratic dialogues), &quot;Oeconomicus&quot; (which concerns Socrates&#x27; encounter with Ischomachus and Critobulus), and &quot;Symposium&quot; (which recounts an evening at a dinner party to which Socrates was an attendee).

== Plato ==

Socrates—who is often credited with turning Western philosophy in a more ethical and political direction and who was put to death by the democracy of Athens in May 399 BC—was Plato&#x27;s mentor. Plato, like some of his contemporaries, wrote dialogues about his teacher. Much of what is known about Socrates comes from Plato&#x27;s writings; however, it is widely believed that very few, if any, of Plato&#x27;s dialogues can be verbatim accounts of conversations between them or unmediated representations of Socrates&#x27; thought. Many of the dialogues seem to use Socrates as a device for Plato&#x27;s thought, and inconsistencies occasionally crop up between Plato and the other accounts of Socrates; for instance, Plato has Socrates denying that he would ever accept money for teaching, while Xenophon&#x27;s &quot;Symposium&quot; clearly has Socrates stating that students pay him to teach wisdom and that this is what he does for a living.

Stylometric analysis of Plato&#x27;s work has led some scholars to classify dialogues as falling approximately into three groups, Early, Middle and Late. On the assumption that there is an evolution of philosophical thought in Plato&#x27;s dialogues from his early years to his middle and later years, the most common modern view is that Plato&#x27;s dialogues contain a development of thought from closer to that of Socrates&#x27; to a doctrine more distinctly Plato&#x27;s own. However, the question of exactly what aspects of Plato&#x27;s dialogues are representative of Socrates and what are not, is debated. Although the view that Plato&#x27;s dialogues are &quot;developmental&quot; in their doctrines (with regard to the historical Socrates or not) is standard, the view is not without objectors who propose a &quot;unitarian&quot; view or other alternative interpretations of the chronology of the corpus. One notable example is Charles Kahn who argued that Plato had created his works not in a gradual way, but as a unified philosophical vision, whereby he uses Socratic dialogues, a non-historical genre, to flesh out his views. The time that Plato began to write his works and the date of composition of his last work are unknown and, adding to the complexity, even ancient sources do not know the order of the works or dialogues.

==Aristotle==
== Others ==

=== Aeschines ===
Two relevant works pertain to periods in Socrates&#x27; life, of which Aeschines could not have had any personal first-hand experiential knowledge. However, substantial amounts are extant of his works &quot;Alcibiades&quot; and &quot;Aspasia&quot;.

=== Antisthenes ===
Antisthenes was a pupil of Socrates, and was known to accompany him.

== Issues relating to the sources ==

Aristophanes (c. 450–386 BCE) was alive during the early years of Socrates. One source shows Plato and Xenophon were about 45 years younger than Socrates, other sources show Plato as something in the range of 42–43 years younger, while Xenophon is thought to be 40 years younger.

=== Issues resulting from translation ===
Apart from the existing identified issue of conflicting elements present in accounts and writings, there is the additional inherent concern of the veracity of transfer of meaning by translation from classic Greek to contemporary language, whether that be Greek, English or any other.

== History of the problem ==
Efforts have been made by writers for centuries to address the problem. According to one scholar (Patzer) the number of works with any significance in this issue, prior to the nineteenth century, are few indeed. G.E. Lessing caused a flurry of interest in the problem in 1768. A methodology for analysis was posited, by study of Platonic sources, in 1820 with Socher. A break of scholarly impasse in respect to understanding, resulted from Campbell making a stylometric analysis in 1867.

An essay written by Friedrich Schleiermacher in 1815 (&quot;The Worth of Socrates as a Philosopher&quot;), published 1818 (English translation 1833) is considered the most significant and influential toward developing an understanding of the problem.

Throughout the 20th century, two strains of interpretation arose: the literary contextualists, who tended to interpret Socratic dialogues based on literary criticism, and the analysts, who focus much more heavily on the actual arguments contained within the different texts.

Early in the 21st century, most of the scholars concerned have settled to agreement instead of argument about the nature of the significance of ancient textual sources in relation to this problem.

== Manuscript tradition ==
A fragment of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot; (588b-589b) was found in Codex VI, of the Nag Hammadi discoveries of 1945.

=== Plato primary edition ===
The Latin language corpus was by Ficinus during 1484, the first of a Greek language text was Aldus in 1513.

=== Xenophon primary edition ===

The &quot;Memorabilia&quot; appeared in the Florence Junta in 1516.

The first &quot;Apology&quot; was by Johann Reuchlin in 1520.

== Scholarly analysis ==

The German classical scholar Friedrich Schleiermacher addressed the &quot;Socratic problem&quot; in his essay &quot;The Worth of Socrates as a Philosopher&quot; (published in 1818). Schleiermacher maintained that the two dialogues &quot;Apology&quot; and &quot;Crito&quot; are purely Socratic. They were, therefore, accurate historical portrayals of the real man, and hence history and not Platonic philosophy at all. All of the other dialogues that Schleiermacher accepted as genuine he considered to be integrally bound together and consistent in their Platonism. Their consistency is related to the three phases of Plato&#x27;s development:
# Foundation works, culminating in &quot;Parmenides&quot;;
# Transitional works, culminating in two so-called families of dialogues, the first consisting of &quot;Sophist&quot;, &quot;Statesman&quot; and &quot;Symposium&quot;, and the second of &quot;Phaedo&quot; and &quot;Philebus&quot;; and finally
# Constructive works: &quot;Republic&quot;, &quot;Timaeus&quot; and &quot;Laws&quot;.

Schleiermacher&#x27;s views on the chronology of Plato&#x27;s work are rather controversial. In Schleiermacher&#x27;s view, the character of Socrates evolves over time into the &quot;Stranger&quot; in Plato&#x27;s work, and fulfills a critical function in Plato&#x27;s development, as he appears in the first family above as the &quot;Eleatic Stranger&quot; in &quot;Sophist&quot; and &quot;Statesman&quot;, and as the &quot;Mantitenean Stranger&quot; in the &quot;Symposium&quot;. The &quot;Athenian Stranger&quot; is the main character of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Laws.&quot; Further, the &quot;Sophist–Statesman–Philosopher&quot; family makes particularly good sense in this order, as Schleiermacher also maintains that the two dialogues, &quot;Symposium&quot; and &quot;Phaedo,&quot; show Socrates as the quintessential philosopher in life (guided by Diotima) and into death, the realm of otherness. Thus the triad announced both in the Sophist and in the Statesman is completed, although the Philosopher, being divided dialectically into a &quot;Stranger&quot; portion and a &quot;Socrates&quot; portion, is not called &quot;The Philosopher&quot;; this philosophical crux is left to the reader to determine. Schleiermacher thus takes the position that the real Socratic problem is understanding the dialectic between the figures of the &quot;Stranger&quot; and &quot;Socrates&quot;.

Søren Kierkegaard addressed &quot;the Socratic problem&quot; in Theses II, III and VII of his &quot;On the Concept of Irony with Continual Reference to Socrates&quot; (1841).

Karl Popper, who considered himself to be a disciple of Socrates, wrote about &quot;the Socratic problem&quot; in his book &quot;The Open Society and Its Enemies&quot; (1945).

==Proposed solutions==
Four solutions elucidated by Nails were proposed early in the history of the Socratic problem and are still relevant, even though each still poses problems today:

# Socrates is the individual whose qualities exhibited in Plato’s writings are corroborated by Aristophanes and Xenophon.
# Socrates is he who claims “to possess no wisdom” but still participates in exercises with the aim of gaining understanding.
# Socrates is the [individual named] Socrates who appears in Plato’s earliest dialogues.
# The real Socrates is the one who turns from a &quot;pre-Socratic&quot; interest in nature to ethics, instead.

<text>The Bohemian Forest, known in Czech as &#x27; () and in German as &#x27;, is a low mountain range in Central Europe. Geographically, the mountains extend from Plzeň Region and the South Bohemian Region in the Czech Republic to Austria and Bavaria in Germany, and form the highest truncated uplands of the Bohemian Massif, up to 50 km wide. They create a natural border between the Czech Republic on one side and Austria and Germany on the other.

==Names and etymology==
For political reasons, the Bohemian and German sides have different names in both languages: in Czech, the Bohemian side is called and the Bavarian side &#x27;Rear Bavarian Forest&#x27;, while in German, the Bohemian side is called &#x27;Bohemian Forest&#x27;, and the Bavarian side &#x27;Bavarian Forest&#x27;.

In Czech, is also used as a name for the entire region in Bohemia and Germany.

The designation &quot;&quot; has been attested in the late 15th century in Antonio Bonfini&#x27;s work . Folk etymology connects the name&#x27;s origin with the Czech words , (literally &#x27;hum, humming&#x27;) denoting the noise of trees in the wind. The most accepted opinion among linguists derives from a theorized Proto-Slavic word &#x27;dense forest&#x27;, cf. Serbian as it adjoins regions populated by Sorbs of Lusatia and surrounds (North Eastern Bavaria and Saxony). There are corresponding toponyms in modern-day Serbia i.e. &#x27;land of dense forests&#x27;.
Modern Serbian maintains the use of the word &#x27;forest&#x27; and the toponym equates to &#x27;forested lands&#x27;. 

In the ancient maps of astronomer and geographer Ptolemy, the mountain chain is called Gabreta. In the maps of Greek geographer Strabo the mountain chain is called Sudeta. Both names given to the mountain chain are of Celtic etymology.

==Geography==
The Bohemian Forest comprises heavily forested mountains with average heights of 800–1,400 metres. The highest peak is Großer Arber (1,456 m) on the Bavarian side; the highest peak on the Bohemian and Austrian side is the Plöckenstein (Plechý, 1,378 m). The most eastern peak is the Sternstein (1,125 m). The range is one of the oldest in Europe, and its mountains are eroded into round forms with few rocky parts. Typical for the Bohemian Forest are plateaux at about 1,000–1,200 m with relatively harsh climates and many peat bogs.

===Water===

The Bohemian Forest is the dividing range between the watersheds of the Black Sea and the North Sea, where water collected by the Vltava, Otava and Úhlava rivers flows. These rivers all spring from the Bohemian Forest. Owing to heavy precipitation (mostly snow), the peat bogs and the Lipno Reservoir, the Šumava region is an important water reservoir for Central Europe. More important for their aesthetic value than for holding water are several lakes of glacial origin.

==Nature==
As a border region, the Bohemian Forest has had a complicated history. In the 20th century it was part of the Iron Curtain, and large areas were stripped of human settlement. Even before that, settlement was sparse and for centuries forests dominated over human dwellings and pathways. These unique circumstances led to the preservation of unspoilt nature and forest ecosystems relatively unaffected by human activity. On the other hand, many habitats dependent on farming activity are slowly turning into forest.

In the Czech Republic, the most valuable area is protected in the Šumava National Park and Protected Landscape and the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. Part of the German section is protected as the Bavarian Forest National Park. The Bohemian Forest is a popular holiday destination because it is excellent hiking country. Most interesting natural and cultural sights are connected with more than 500 km of summer marked trails and many bike trails. However, park administration is not always successful in its task, and many believe the rapid growth of tourist accommodation and services is destroying the former calm of the Šumava region. Šumava National Park is also suffering from problems connected with bark beetles, and there is heated debate about how to deal with them.

==History==

According to archaeological findings, the Bohemian Forest area was not significantly populated during the Paleolithic era – the Stone Age (dates back to 9000 BC). The initial settlements of a more permanent character appeared in the southwest of Bohemia during the Bronze Age (3,000 to 1,000 years BC). In the 1st century AD, the forest was inhabited by Gallo-Romans as well as by Germanic tribes in its northern part.

The Celts were however gradually forced out by the Germanic tribe (the Marcomanni), who left the Celtic agricultural settlements desolated. With the departure of the Marcomanni, the forests were left to evolve with almost no human influence. The Bohemian Forest forests began to change character only with the arrival of the Slavs in the 6th century, who found a refuge in the middle of the impenetrable forests. The cultural landscape began to penetrate the wooded surroundings. The gradual but disorganized and fairly subtle form of colonisation continued until the late 11th century. Slavic settlement gradually shifted south, without however reaching the upper Vltava valley. Slavic-founded settlements carried the names of Christian Saints, which indicates that the founding was after the Christianization of Bohemia. Some toponyms indicate that the new Slavic settlers came in contact with remaining Germanic people.

Under the rule of King Ottokar I, organized colonization of Bohemian Forest by German settlers began. Bavarian settlers after various wars with Serbs (modern Serbs/Sorbs) for domination over the region, cleared the forest and founded settlements in the to date largely uninhabited mountainous region, which thereby became culturally close to Bavaria. Since then the nature in Bohemian Forest, including the forested landscape developed under the strong influence of human activity. The borderline virgin forests receded, making way for fields and pastures, and thus in the 13th century, the colonisation of the Bohemian borderland began.

In the area, 136 villages with German names relating to forest clearing () existed. In addition, groups of German village names appear, one such group between Sonnberg (first mentioned in 1279) and Deutsch Reichenau (1261), another group around Zettwing (1356). South of Ottau, German villages form a line along the road from Linz through Hohenfurth to Krummau. Another old settlement area was between Untermoldau (1376, today: Dolní Vltavice) and Obermoldau (1359).

In 1945–1946, the region&#x27;s Bohemian Germans were expelled. The originally Sorbian population moved to adjoining places which to this day testify to their origins in places throughout North Bohemia i.e Srbská Kamenice.

<text>Hugh Llewellyn Keenleyside, CC (7 July 1898 – September 27, 1992) was a Canadian university professor, diplomat, and civil servant. He was the Canadian ambassador to Mexico from 1944 to 1947, and the commissioner of the Northwest Territories from January 14, 1947 to September 15, 1950.

== Life ==
Born in Toronto, the son of Ellis William and Margaret (Irvine) Keenleyside, he moved with his family to British Columbia when he was a few months old. After serving with the Canadian Expeditionary Force during World War I, he received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of British Columbia in 1920. He married Katherine Pillsbury in 1924. He received a Master of Arts degree in 1921 and Ph.D. in 1923 from Clark University. He taught history at Clark University, Penn State University, Brown University and Syracuse University. He returned to the University of British Columbia in 1927, but left to work at Macmillan publishers, before joining the Department of External Affairs at the same time as Lester B. Pearson.

In 1929, he was posted to Japan, to open the new Canadian embassy there. He returned to Canada in 1936, and prepared the 1939 royal visit of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. In 1941, he was appointed Assistant Under-Secretary of State for External Affairs. From 1944 to 1947, he was the Canadian Ambassador to Mexico. From 1940 to 1945, he served on the Canadian Section of the Permanent Joint Board on Defence. He was the commissioner of the Northwest Territories from 1947 to 1950. From 1947 to 1949, he was the Deputy Minister of Mines and Resources. From 1950 to 1958, he was the director general of the United Nations&#x27; Technical Assistance Administration. From 1959 to 1962, he was the chairman of the British Columbia Power Commission and co-chairman at the British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority from 1962 to 1969. He retired in 1969.

From 1969 to 1977, he served as Chancellor and Chairman of the Board of Governors of Notre Dame University College.

He published a two-volume memoir: &quot;Hammer the Golden Day&quot; and &quot;On the Bridge of Time&quot;.

==Honours==

In 1969, he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada &quot;for service at the United Nations and in public administration&quot;. He also was the 1982 recipient of the Pearson Medal of Peace for his work in public service. The Hugh Keenleyside Dam on the Columbia River in British Columbia is named in his honour. He was awarded an honorary degree from the University of British Columbia in 1945 and an honorary Doctor of Laws from his alma mater Clark University in 1951.

<text>The Think-a-Dot was a mathematical toy invented by Joseph Weisbecker and manufactured by E.S.R., Inc. during the 1960s that demonstrated automata theory. It had eight coloured disks on its front, and three holes on its top – left, right, and center – through which a ball bearing could be dropped. Each disk would display either a yellow or blue face, depending on whether the mechanism behind it was tipped to the right or the left. The Think-a-Dot thus had 28=256 internal states. When the ball fell to the bottom it would exit either to a hole on the left or the right of the device.

As the ball passed through the Think-a-Dot, it would flip the disk mechanisms that it passed, and they in turn would determine whether the ball would be deflected to the left or to the right. Various puzzles and games were possible with the Think-a-Dot, such as flipping the colours of all cells in the minimum number of moves, or reaching a given state from a monochrome state or vice versa.

<text>Jonne Valtonen is a Finnish composer, arranger and orchestrator. He contributed to demoscene and tracker music, under the name Purple Motion, and with Future Crew.

== Life and early career ==

Jonne Valtonen was born in Turku, Finland and was raised in Kaarina along with his brother. He began learning to play classical piano at the age of nine.

Valtonen&#x27;s first music compositions were done on his home computer, a Commodore 64. During his teen years, he became involved in the PC demoscene where he was able to pursue his passion for electronic music production. He has won several awards in this field. Between 1991 and 1996 Valtonen created music for Future Crew, one of the groups in the demoscene at the time. Eventually he became their lead composer under the pseudonym Purple Motion, chosen as a tribute to the British rock group Deep Purple. His compositions include &quot;UnreaL ][ / PM&quot; (from Future Crew demo &quot;Second Reality&quot;), &quot;Satellite One&quot;, and &quot;Starshine&quot;.

Valtonen sings in a mixed choir (Näsin Ääni, Tampere) and has started learning to play the harp.

== Educational background ==

Jonne Valtonen graduated from classical composition at the Pirkanmaa Polytechnic in Finland in 2009. He has received training in composition under the guidance of Hannu Pohjannoro, Oliver Kohlenberg, and Juhani Nuorvala. He has also studied under Magnus Lindberg, Jukka Tiensuu, Kirmo Lintinen and Michael Nyman in various composition masterclasses.

== Working for the entertainment industry ==

In 1996, Jonne Valtonen began doing commission work for game developers in Finland, namely Remedy Entertainment, Housemarque and Bugbear Entertainment. During the same time, he served as the musical director for the TeatteriSusi theatre, where he composed music for several plays including &quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;The Miser&quot; and &quot;Don Quijote&quot;.

In 1998, Jonne Valtonen co-founded his company Valtone Oy, specialising in music productions for the entertainment industry. Continuing on this path, he also contributed two titles, in 2000 and 2002, for the &quot;Merregnon&quot; trilogy, an international soundtrack project featuring orchestral music by veteran video game composers from all over the world, such as Chris Hülsbeck and Yuzo Koshiro.
In 2002, Valtonen&#x27;s talent was recognized again when he was presented with the Best Soundtrack Award at the International Fest of Cinema &amp; Technology for the movie &quot;House by the Sea&quot;, directed by Janne Ketola.
In 2004, Jonne Valtonen released his first professionally mastered audio CD, &quot;Musicdisk&quot;, featuring tracks from his demoscene past.

At the beginning of 2008, Jonne Valtonen took the position of the music lead for all live orchestra projects at Merregnon Studios, a company managed by Thomas Böcker and involved in productions of video game music concerts around the world, and several live recordings for publishers/developers such as THQ US, SEGA Japan and Square Enix Japan.

== Orchestra arrangements ==

Drawing on his background in live orchestra work and his studies, Jonne Valtonen has been arranging and orchestrating music for video game concerts since 2005. He has earned worldwide recognition as the main arranger of the annual video game music concerts of the German WDR Radio Orchestra, namely &quot;Symphonic Shades&quot; (2008), &quot;Symphonic Fantasies&quot; (2009), &quot;Symphonic Legends&quot; (2010), and &quot;Symphonic Odysseys&quot; (2011).

In addition to the WDR Radio Orchestra, his arrangements have been performed at the Sydney Opera House, Gewandhaus Leipzig, Max Fisher Music Center Detroit, Esplanade Singapore, Cologne Philharmonic Hall, and Konserthuset Stockholm. His portfolio includes franchises such as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot;, &quot;Super Mario Galaxy&quot;, &quot;The Elder Scrolls&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, and &quot;Castlevania&quot;. In 2007, he arranged and orchestrated music for Sega&#x27;s arcade game series &quot;World Club Champion Football&quot; which was recorded with a live orchestra and choir in Prague.

<doc id="918027" wikidata="Q7626882" url="?curid=918027" title="Stuart Murray">
<text>Stuart Murray (born November 24, 1954) is a former politician from Manitoba, Canada. He served as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba and leader of the opposition in the Manitoba legislature from 2000 to 2006. From 2006 until 2009, Murray was the President and Chief Executive Officer of the St. Boniface Hospital Research Foundation. He subsequently served as director and chief executive officer of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights from 2009 to 2014.

==Early life and career==
Murray was born in Lestock, Saskatchewan, and raised in Punnichy in the same province. His mother, Jean Murray, was a town councillor. He studied Science at the University of Manitoba, and transferred to Ryerson Polytechnical Institute to further his studies in Architectural Science. He later worked as road manager for the rock band Blood, Sweat and Tears, and in 1982 became media director for the Canadian Opera Company.

Murray began working for Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in 1985. He moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1989 after being named vice-president of the family-owned Domo Gasoline Corporation, and became its CEO and president four years later. Murray was also an organizer for the Manitoba Progressive Conservative Party in the 1990, 1995 and 1999 elections, and supported Kim Campbell&#x27;s successful bid to succeed Mulroney as leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 1993.

Murray was appointed to the board of Canadian National Railways in 1991, and served for one term. He was a founding member of the Manitoba Entertainment Complex Group (MEC) in 1994, and chaired the successful World Hockey Junior Championship in 1999. In recognition of their contribution, he and his team were each awarded the Order of the Buffalo Hunt, one of Manitoba’s highest honours.

==Provincial politician==
After eleven years in power, the Manitoba Progressive Conservatives were defeated by Gary Doer&#x27;s New Democratic Party in the 1999 election. Gary Filmon, the party&#x27;s leader since 1983, stepped down in 2000.

Murray soon emerged as the party establishment&#x27;s preferred choice to succeed Filmon as leader. Darren Praznik considered running against him, but withdrew several months before the convention because of fundraising difficulties. Murray was acclaimed as party leader in November 2000, and won a by-election in Kirkfield Park shortly thereafter. On December 5, he was sworn in as leader of the opposition. He criticized the New Democratic Party&#x27;s 2001 budget for increased government spending, and called for significant tax cuts. He also argued the NDP was too close to provincial labour unions. Murray held progressive views on some social issues, and supported the principle of gay adoption rights late 2001.

Murray was criticized for hiring Taras Sokolyk as an advisor in 2002 without informing his caucus. Sokolyk had previously been implicated in a vote-manipulation scheme involving the Independent Native Voice party, and was largely discredited as a political figure. Murray later spoke at a Winnipeg rally held in support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

Murray led the Progressive Conservatives in the 2003 provincial election. His health strategy called for the government to purchase more surgeries and diagnostic services at private clinics, with the intent of reducing waiting times. He also promised to reintroduce workfare laws and to cancel the planned University College of the North, using the savings for tax cuts. Murray argued that provincial laws were skewed in favour of labour unions, and considered introducing right-to-work legislation. His most radical proposal was to eliminate the taxation powers of local school boards.

Gary Doer&#x27;s NDP government was re-elected, and Murray&#x27;s Conservatives slipped to 36.31% of the popular vote and 20 seats in the 57-member legislature. This was the party&#x27;s worst showing since 1953. The NDP made historic inroads in south-end Winnipeg, while the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s support was largely concentrated in the rural south of the province. A post-election editorial in the &quot;Winnipeg Free Press&quot; described Murray as &quot;pleasant and even-tempered&quot; but noted that he &quot;did not make a deep impression on the public either by his work in the legislature or in the election campaign&quot;.

Murray continued as party leader after the election. He recommended adopting Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) for determining Manitoba&#x27;s budget, and called for provincial whistleblower protection legislation. He endorsed the new Conservative Party of Canada in 2004, and campaigned on behalf of Steven Fletcher in the 2004 federal election. Despite concerns about Murray&#x27;s leadership, the Manitoba Progressive Conservatives voted overwhelmingly against a leadership review in November 2004.

In early 2004-05, Manitoba&#x27;s labour-managed Crocus Investment Fund stopped trading and was forced into receivership after reports that it had misled shareholders and overstated the values of its assets. Doer&#x27;s government was accused of improper oversight of the fund due to its ties to labour interests, and the resulting scandal initially threatened to damage the NDP&#x27;s credibility. Instead, it grew to encompass the Progressive Conservatives as well. Murray acknowledged that the Progressive Conservatives had received reports of irregularities at Crocus as early as 2002, but refrained from criticism after assurances from party advisers that the fund was in proper order. These admissions may have prevented Murray from exploiting the scandal to his party&#x27;s advantage; the NDP&#x27;s popularity increased over the PCs increased in the summer of 2005.

On November 5, 2005, a leadership review motion at the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s annual general meeting received 55% support from delegates. Murray acknowledged the vote as disappointing, and called for a leadership convention to be held in light of the close result. He announced on November 14 that he would not be a candidate to succeed himself, and that he would return to the private sector after a new leader was selected.

Murray continued to lead the Progressive Conservatives in the legislature until the new leader was chosen. In late November 2005, he said that he would be willing to accept private MRI clinics in the province. He did not attend the Progressive Conservative leadership convention in April 2006, which chose Hugh McFadyen as his successor.

==After politics==
Murray resigned as MLA for Kirkfield Park on September 7, 2006. One day later, he was introduced as the new President and Chief Executive Officer for the St. Boniface Hospital Research Foundation in Winnipeg. He held this position until 2009, and during this time, he hosted a weekly radio program on CJOB called &quot;The Health Report&quot;.
In late summer of 2009, Murray was named the inaugural Director and Chief Executive Officer of the
Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg, Manitoba. In 2016, Murray was appointed by the provincial government to the board of Manitoba Liquor &amp; Lotteries Corporation. He wrote to the provincial government in 2019, asking that his position on the board not be renewed. Murray was then appointed co-chair of Manitoba 150, along with Monique Lacoste.

In late summer of 2009, Murray was named the inaugural Director and Chief Executive Officer of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg, Manitoba. He did not have his contract renewed in October 2014 after his controversial inauguration of the museum, including having only 5 of 11 galleries open for viewing.

Murray launched the podcast &quot;Humans, on Rights&quot; in January 2021. Its mission is to raise awareness of local grassroots human rights issues and events and profile the people and the organizations advocating or educating to make a difference.

==Honours==
In 2002, Murray was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal. In 2012, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. Murray was appointed as Honorary Colonel of 17 Wing in January 2018, and reappointed in December 2020. He received the Order of Manitoba on September 10, 2020. In 2022 he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Platinum Jubilee Medal.

<text>William Wallace Cory, CMG (June 16, 1865 – September 21, 1943) was the commissioner of the Northwest Territories from June 27, 1919 to February 17, 1931.

== Biography ==
Cory was born in Strathroy, Canada West and moved with his farming family to Gladstone, Manitoba in 1871. He studied law in Winnipeg and joined the Manitoba Attorney General&#x27;s Office as a clerk in 1889, then joined the Dominion Department of the Interior in 1901. He was Assistant Commissioner of Dominion Lands from 1904 to 1905. Between 1905 and 1930 he was Deputy Minister of the Department of the Interior. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1909.

=== Commissioner of the Northwest Territories ===
In 1919 Cory was also appointed Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, holding the office until 1931. Only the second Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, Cory inherited a region that had barely been governed during the time of his predecessor. Within months the new Commissioner had enacted a new ordinance (or law) regarding entry into the Northwest Territories, restricting access only to those pre-approved by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at various outposts in Alberta or the Yukon. The ordinance was cancelled a year later having been deemed &quot;ultra vires.&quot; However, during his tenure as Commissioner, Cory pursued further administration of the Territories, overseeing the appointment of councillors for the first time and establishing operations to facilitate the expansion of oil and gas interests in the region including the opening of the Territories&#x27; administration offices at Fort Smith in 1921.

Later in 1921, a memo from the Commissioner&#x27;s office concerned the well-being of the 150 white settlers of the District of Mackenzie and including future white interests in the Territories. It did not make any reference to the interests of the approximately 3,500 aboriginal population of the District of Mackenzie at that time. However alternative evidence suggests Cory himself was sympathetic to the region&#x27;s Inuit populace as highlighted in a letter to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company secretary, Edward Fitzgerald accusing Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company post managers of exploiting the Inuit, and casting doubt on whether the Company could reform its trading system to prevent such abuses.

=== Later life ===
Cory died in Montreal (St. Lambert) in 1943 and was buried in Ottawa.

Cory is the namesake of Mount Cory, in Alberta.

== Family ==
Cory married Laura Watson in 1888; they had three children: Wilfred, Thomas, and Edith. Edith married Alfred Bertram Rosevear and had eight children: John, William, Thomas, Margaret, Cory, Edith, Bertram, and Elizabeth. William married Cynthia and had a daughter named Stephanie. Cory married Elizabeth and had three children: Kenneth, Robin and Heather. Edith married J.D. Scanlan and had one daughter: Mary, who married Keith Martin and had three children: Sarah, Emily, and Sophie. Elizabeth married Charles Dean and had three children: Stephen, Thomas, and James.

<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Frederick D. White (February 16, 1847 – September 27, 1918) was a Canadian civil servant who served as the first commissioner of the Northwest Territories.

Born in Birmingham, White immigrated to British North America in 1862 at the age of 15, and worked for some time for the Grand Trunk Railway at Montreal. He entered the Canadian Department of Justice in 1869 as a third-class clerk, becoming Chief Clerk in 1876. He was later transferred to the Department of the Secretary of State, where he was made the clerk in charge of the North-West Mounted Police in 1876. 

In 1880 he was appointed private secretary to Sir John A. Macdonald. The same year he was appointed Comptroller of the NWMP, holding the post until 1913. In 1883 he was given the rank of Deputy Minister (Secretary of State). In the 1902 Coronation Honours he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.

On August 24, 1905, White was appointed the first Commissioner of the Northwest Territories, and held the office until his death on September 27, 1918.

<doc id="918047" wikidata="Q1307676" url="?curid=918047" title="Künneth theorem">
<text>In mathematics, especially in homological algebra and algebraic topology, a Künneth theorem, also called a Künneth formula, is a statement relating the homology of two objects to the homology of their product. The classical statement of the Künneth theorem relates the singular homology of two topological spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; and their product space formula_1. In the simplest possible case the relationship is that of a tensor product, but for applications it is very often necessary to apply certain tools of homological algebra to express the answer.

A Künneth theorem or Künneth formula is true in many different homology and cohomology theories, and the name has become generic. These many results are named for the German mathematician Hermann Künneth.

== Singular homology with coefficients in a field ==
Let &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; be two topological spaces. In general one uses singular homology; but if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; happen to be CW complexes, then this can be replaced by cellular homology, because that is isomorphic to singular homology. The simplest case is when the coefficient ring for homology is a field &quot;F&quot;. In this situation, the Künneth theorem (for singular homology) states that for any integer &quot;k&quot;,

:formula_2.

Furthermore, the isomorphism is a natural isomorphism. The map from the sum to the homology group of the product is called the &quot;cross product&quot;. More precisely, there is a cross product operation by which an &quot;i&quot;-cycle on &quot;X&quot; and a &quot;j&quot;-cycle on &quot;Y&quot; can be combined to create an formula_3-cycle on formula_1; so that there is an explicit linear mapping defined from the direct sum to formula_5.

A consequence of this result is that the Betti numbers, the dimensions of the homology with formula_6 coefficients, of formula_1 can be determined from those of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;. If formula_8 is the generating function of the sequence of Betti numbers formula_9 of a space &quot;Z&quot;, then

: formula_10

Here when there are finitely many Betti numbers of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, each of which is a natural number rather than formula_11, this reads as an identity on Poincaré polynomials. In the general case these are formal power series with possibly infinite coefficients, and have to be interpreted accordingly. Furthermore, the above statement holds not only for the Betti numbers but also for the generating functions of the dimensions of the homology over any field. (If the integer homology is not torsion-free, then these numbers may differ from the standard Betti numbers.)

== Singular homology with coefficients in a principal ideal domain ==
The above formula is simple because vector spaces over a field have very restricted behavior. As the coefficient ring becomes more general, the relationship becomes more complicated. The next simplest case is the case when the coefficient ring is a principal ideal domain. This case is particularly important because the integers formula_12 form a PID.

In this case the equation above is no longer always true. A correction factor appears to account for the possibility of torsion phenomena. This correction factor is expressed in terms of the Tor functor, the first derived functor of the tensor product.

When &quot;R&quot; is a PID, then the correct statement of the Künneth theorem is that for any topological spaces &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; there are natural short exact sequences

:formula_13

Furthermore, these sequences split, but not canonically.

=== Example ===
The short exact sequences just described can easily be used to compute the homology groups with integer coefficients of the product formula_14 of two real projective planes, in other words, formula_15. These spaces are CW complexes. Denoting the homology group formula_16 by formula_17 for brevity&#x27;s sake, one knows from a simple calculation with cellular homology that 
:formula_18, 
:formula_19,
:formula_20 for all other values of &quot;i&quot;. 
The only non-zero Tor group (torsion product) which can be formed from these values of formula_17 is 
:formula_22.
Therefore, the Künneth short exact sequence reduces in every degree to an isomorphism, because there is a zero group in each case on either the left or the right side in the sequence. The result is
:formula_23
and all the other homology groups are zero.

== The Künneth spectral sequence ==
For a general commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, the homology of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; is related to the homology of their product by a Künneth spectral sequence 
:formula_24 
In the cases described above, this spectral sequence collapses to give an isomorphism or a short exact sequence.

== Relation with homological algebra, and idea of proof ==
The chain complex of the space &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; is related to the chain complexes of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; by a natural quasi-isomorphism
:formula_25
For singular chains this is the theorem of Eilenberg and Zilber. For cellular chains on CW complexes, it is a straightforward isomorphism. Then the homology of the tensor product on the right is given by the spectral Künneth formula of homological algebra.

The freeness of the chain modules means that in this geometric case it is not necessary to use any hyperhomology or total derived tensor product.

There are analogues of the above statements for singular cohomology and sheaf cohomology. For sheaf cohomology on an algebraic variety, Alexander Grothendieck found six spectral sequences relating the possible hyperhomology groups of two chain complexes of sheaves and the hyperhomology groups of their tensor product.

== Künneth theorems in generalized homology and cohomology theories ==
There are many generalized (or &quot;extraordinary&quot;) homology and cohomology theories for topological spaces. K-theory and cobordism are the best-known. Unlike ordinary homology and cohomology, they typically cannot be defined using chain complexes. Thus Künneth theorems can not be obtained by the above methods of homological algebra. Nevertheless, Künneth theorems in just the same form have been proved in very many cases by various other methods. The first were Michael Atiyah&#x27;s Künneth theorem for complex K-theory and Pierre Conner and Edwin E. Floyd&#x27;s result in cobordism. A general method of proof emerged, based upon a homotopical theory of modules over highly structured ring spectra. The homotopy category of such modules closely resembles the derived category in homological algebra.

<doc id="918048" wikidata="Q2347080" url="?curid=918048" title="Chroma Key">
<text>Chroma Key is a band of Kevin Moore, known for his work with the bands OSI and Dream Theater. Although primarily a solo project, several other musicians have recorded as part of the band such as bassist Joey Vera, drummer Mark Zonder, and guitarist Jason Anderson.

Chroma Key&#x27;s music is a mix of psychedelia, electronica and ambient, with detailed keyboard sounds and a slightly dark mood.

==History==

===Departure from Dream Theater and &quot;Dead Air for Radios&quot; (1994–1998) ===
After more than eight years with the band Moore left Dream Theater in June 1994 in pursuit of his own musical direction. By fall of 1994 Moore relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico, where much of the first album, 1998&#x27;s &quot;Dead Air for Radios&quot; was written and recorded. The first four songs to be recorded were: &quot;Even the Waves&quot;, &quot;S.O.S.&quot;, &quot;On the Page&quot; and &quot;Mouse&quot; which include excerpts of interviews conducted by Moore of people he had met in Santa Fe. Dead Air for Radios was the first release on Moore&#x27;s newly formed Fight Evil Records, created specifically for Chroma Key and future releases. In response to a question of whether or not he would tour to support the release Moore explained that after three years with the material he was ready to &quot;just move on&quot;, but stated that touring would be more likely &quot;after the next album.&quot; Moore denied a &quot;dark&quot; vibe to the album, and preferred to describe it as &quot;emotional or thoughtful&quot;. Furthermore he went on to elaborate that the &quot;result of the mood I was in during the period after I left Dream Theater and before I knew what the hell I was going to do with my life... I don&#x27;t really think of it as a dark time, but certainly a thoughtful time anyway. I think that kind of shows up on the album.&quot;

===&quot;You Go Now&quot; (1999–2019)===
2000&#x27;s &quot;You Go Now&quot; was written and recorded in Los Angeles, right before another move to Costa Rica, where Moore lived for three years. In Costa Rica, he began writing and recording ideas for a new Chroma Key album, during the day producing a bi-weekly, activist, musical radio program for Radio for Peace International, a short wave station based in San José. Moore released a compilation of the program—a mix of original music and politically volatile spoken word recordings—as a downloadable album on his official site as &quot;Shines Fox1&quot;.

===&quot;Graveyard Mountain Home&quot; (2003–2004)===
Moore originally began work on &quot;Graveyard Mountain Home&quot; in December 2003, but postponed work on more material due to the next OSI album. By this time he had completed two new songs. Moore commented on the sound of the album stating &quot;&quot;The big difference with the new [Chroma Key album] is that there are more real instruments...This new Chroma Key is going to be more organic, and less digital.&quot; Moore left Costa Rica at the invitation of former classmate at California Institute of the Arts, Theron Patterson to visit him in Istanbul, Turkey. After two weeks he decided to settle down and record the third Chroma Key album. Moore decided to model the album as a soundtrack to a movie. He chose to use a film within the public domain to avoid copyright issues. Searching the Prelinger Archives he happened upon social guidance film Age 13. Moore wrote music to Age 13 slowed down to half its original playback speed allowing him to compose almost an hour of music. &quot;Graveyard Mountain Home&quot; was released on November 8, 2004 by InsideOut Music.

===Unofficial work===

Since 2015, Moore has had a Patreon page for Chroma Key, collecting crowdfunding for song releases.

==Musical style and influences==
Chroma Key has been loosely described by Kevin Moore as electronic, trip hop, and pop.

Moore has identified vocalists Peter Gabriel, Roger Waters and Laurie Anderson as his &quot;[oldest] and most basic influences&quot; and early influences as Rick Wakeman and Keith Emerson as well as Jane Siberry. Moreover Moore has also recognized such varied artists, bands and composers as Lisa Germano, Pole, The Cure, John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, The Way Out, Gordons and Japanese band Acid Undertones as influences to his music.

<text>Element management is concerned with managing network elements on the network element management layer (NEL) of the TMN (Telecommunications Management Network).
An element management system (EMS) manages one or more of a specific type of telecommunications network elements (NE). 

It manages functions and capabilities within each NE but does not manage the traffic between different NEs in the network.

It also provides foundation to implement TMN – layered operations support systems (OSS) architectures for better operability and meeting stringent QoS requirements.

OSS Interoperability between EMS and NMS has reached great heights with the introduction of CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture).

== For server appliances ==
A server appliance is a computing entity that delivers predefined services through an application-specific interface with no accessible operating software. In order to develop a true server appliance, the end-user must be shielded from managing the solution as a general purpose server.

An element manager routinely audits the operational condition of core elements, including CPUs, power supplies and disk drives. In the event of hardware or software malfunctions, crashes, runtime errors and system boot failure, the element manager phones home and automatically generates a maintenance request. The use of standards-based mechanisms such as SNMP and Syslog ensures full integration with today&#x27;s network management systems and provides a unified view of system-wide functionality. The element manager uniquely manages the software as an image and not just a collection of software parts.

An element manager also includes update services that automate the process and management of delivering updates, patches and other upgrades to server appliances deployed in field, including the operating system and all related applications. The update service provides a secure phone home point for delivering encrypted manifests and patches in the field.

==State models for network elements (NEs)==
A network element state model facilitates cross domain network management and promotes a multi-vendor environment. The standard definitions and mappings allow operations systems to gather state information from NEs and integrate it into a consistent representation of the status of the entire managed network and each of the services that it supports.

Telcordia GR-1093 discusses the two primary state models in industry. One is the Telcordia State Model, which consolidates the state models previously described in several Telcordia documents. By consolidating the models, changes and expansions to the models can be presented and can evolve in a coordinated fashion. Also, inconsistencies and redundancy may be averted. The other model is the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) State Model, which is defined in International Telecommunication Union - Telecommunication (ITU-T) Rec. X.731.

The state of an entity represents the current condition of availability of the underlying resource or service in the NE from the point of view of management. In the context of the Telcordia State Model, the term &quot;entity&quot; represents an entry in a TL1 administrative view (i.e., represents the resource or service generally identified by the Access Identifier [AID] parameter). In the context of the ISO State Model, the term &quot;entity&quot; means &quot;managed object&quot;.

Different types of entities (such as hardware, transport facilities, and subscriber service) have a variety of state characteristics that express the availability of their underlying resources that are specific to each entity type. However, a state model is expected to be common to a large number of types of entities. It expresses key aspects of their availability at any given time. The purpose of the state model is to indicate the availability of an entity in providing its functions and, if an entity is not available, to indicate the cause of the unavailability and what kind of activity may be taken by the manager (e.g., the OS or the craft) to make the entity available.

In a specific application, only a subset of the state model may be needed. The rationale of such restrictions is not described in GR-1093. The technology or application-specific requirements document should be consulted for this information.

The standard definitions and mappings allow operations systems to gather state information from NEs and integrate it into a consistent representation of the status of the entire managed network and each of the services that it supports.

To help ensure interoperability, particularly for an OS that interfaces with multiple NEs using one of the two state models, a mapping between the models may be needed. GR-1093 provides a mapping for the two models and also defines the extension to the OSI state/status attributes that is necessary to meet the telecommunications needs of the service providers.

<text>Harda is a city and a municipality in Harda district in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. Harda is the administrative headquarters of Harda.

==History==
===Mughal period===
During the Mughal period, Harda was a mahal in the Handia sarkar. In 1742, Marathas led by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao captured the area, and displaced the Muslim governor of the Handia sarkar. Subsequently, Harda replaced Handia as the most important town in the area, as the local Maratha &quot;amil&quot; (chief) resided at Harda. Harda was a part of the Scindia&#x27;s territories. In 1801, Yashwantrao Holkar sacked Harda. Later, Harda also faced attacks from the Pindaris and the Korku tribals.

===British period===
In 1817, during the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Harda became the headquarters of John Malcolm&#x27;s division. Even after the Maratha defeat in the war, the Scindias retained control of the Harda-Handia tract. The area was ceded to the British in 1844, but the cession was completed only in 1860. The town saw disturbances during the 1857 uprising. The Deputy Magistrate, Maulvi Mazhar-ul-Jamil, helped curb the rebellion, and was rewarded with a jagir in the Damoh district. The Harda Nagar Palika was established on 18 May 1867, and the Harda tehsil was created in 1913.

The British tried to bring a progressive frame work to Harda during its rule. Harda was formed by combining Kul Harda and Mehmudabad Villages. After the railway lines were laid the conditions improved, and the area developed. In 1857 British officers worked here as judges and administrative Officers. Harda was one of the largest places in the old &#x27;Madhya Prant&#x27; and includes area of &#x27;Seoni Malwa.&#x27; The Harda language and culture is influenced by &#x27;Malwa&#x27; and &#x27;Nimar&#x27;. The main dialect spoken in Harda is known as Bhuani, and the region is known as the Bhuana area which loosely translates to more fertilized land.

===Indian independence movement ===

Guru Radha Kishan was born in 1925 in Bid village of Harda district. On 15 August 1947, S.D.O Shri Beretha hosted the Indian flag at the police station of Harda. Eminent personalities from Harda include Narayanrao Raghunathrao Kekre, the President of the Hindu Mahasabha of Madhya Pradesh.

Freedom struggle at Harda was led by &quot;Former Chief minister of Madhya pradesh Pandit Bhagwantrao Annabhau Mandloi Annapura V.V.Giri Ward 12 Harda&quot; (He was a recipient of the civilian honour of Padma Bhushan.), Atmaram Lokre shastri in 1905. After the division of Bengal in 1905 there were political movements in Harda led by Pro. Mahadev Shivram Gole, Pandit Chandragopal Gajadharprasad Mishra (Vakil Saheb), Balwantrao Agnihotri, Bhikaji Vinayak Naik, 
Pandit Chandragopal Mishra, Ramdada Naik, Benimadhav Awasthi led the freedom movement. 
Later Thakur Guljarsingh, Sitacharan Dixit, Dadabhai Naik, Maheshdatt Mishra (son of Pt. Chandrgopal Mishra) &amp; Champlal Sokal led the freedom struggle and were subsequently sent to jail.

<doc id="918057" wikidata="Q2908365" url="?curid=918057" title="William Ormsby-Gore, 4th Baron Harlech">
<text>William George Arthur Ormsby-Gore, 4th Baron Harlech (11 April 1885 – 14 February 1964), was a British Conservative politician and banker.

==Background==
Harlech, the son of George Ormsby-Gore, 3rd Baron Harlech, and Lady Margaret Gordon, daughter of Charles Gordon, 10th Marquess of Huntly, was born at Eaton Square, London. He was educated at Eton College and New College, Oxford.

==Military service and First World War==
Ormsby-Gore served in the Territorial Army, being commissioned a second lieutenant in the Shropshire Yeomanry in 1907 and promoted lieutenant in 1911.

He was mobilized at the outbreak of the First World War and accompanied his regiment to Egypt, where he was promoted captain in 1915 and went onto the general staff. In 1916 he joined the Arab Bureau as an intelligence officer, attached to the British High Commissioner Sir Henry A. McMahon.

He strongly opposed the secret Sykes-Picot Treaty, arguing &quot;we make professions of defending and helping small &amp; oppressed nations... [yet] we parcel out between our allies &amp; ourselves vast tracts of countries which do not want us.&quot; He argued that Britain should support self-determination for Arabs and Jews. He challenged claims that Africans were incapable of governing themselves. He saw white prejudices as the fundamental problem, not the incapability of non-whites. After becoming an MP, Ormsby-Gore pressured the British government to accept a League of Nations mandates system. 

He was recalled to England in 1917 to serve as Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lord Milner and as assistant secretary in the War Cabinet headed by Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and to Sir Mark Sykes. Zionist leader Chaim Weizmann, a personal friend, took refuge in Ormsby-Gore&#x27;s London home while the former was in the capital for the cabinet approval of the Balfour Declaration. With Weizmann&#x27;s approval, Ormsby-Gore was the British military liaison officer with the Zionist mission in the Holy Land (then lately liberated from Ottoman Turkish rule) during March to August 1918. After the armistice, he was part of the British delegation to the peace conference at Paris in 1919.

Ormsby-Gore remained serving in the yeomanry after the war until 1921. In 1939 he was appointed an honorary colonel of the 10th Battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers.

==Political career==
Harlech was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Denbigh Boroughs by a majority of eight votes at the January 1910 general election, sitting for the seat until he was selected for and won Stafford at the 1918 general election. He sat in the House of Commons until he entered the House of Lords on succeeding to his father&#x27;s peerage in 1938 as the 4th Baron Harlech.

He was British representative to the Permanent Mandates Commission of the League of Nations from 1921 to 1922. He played a catalyst role in expanding the powers of the Commission and making colonial powers accountable to the Commission. He was influential in establishing a process whereby subjects in the mandates could petition the League of Nations and have their grievances publicized.

He served as Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies from 1922 to 1929 (with a brief interruption during the short-lived Labour government of 1924). 

In the 1927 New Year Honours, he was sworn of the Privy Council. Harlech also held office in the National Government as Postmaster-General in 1931, as First Commissioner of Works from 1931 to 1936 and as Colonial Secretary between 1936 and 1938, resigning, eight days after he entered the House of Lords, as protest of support of partitioning Palestine after pressure of Arab protests over Jewish immigration. After his resignation, he was appointed as Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) in the 1938 Birthday Honours. He was also a firm protester against Nazi Germany at that time.

During the Second World War, he was Civil Defence Commissioner for the North-East of England and then High Commissioner to South Africa from 1941 to 1944.

==Cultural interests==
He had an extensive library at his Shropshire home, Brogyntyn near Oswestry, which he downsized after moving out of the mansion in 1955. He and his father deposited a valuable collection of Brogyntyn manuscripts at the National Library of Wales.

He was author of:
*&quot;Florentine Sculptors of the Fifteenth Century&quot; (1930)
*&quot;Guide to the Mantegna Cartoons at Hampton Court&quot; (1935)
*Three volumes in the series &quot;Guides to the Ancient Monuments of England&quot;.

===Further work===
After retiring from politics he served on the board of Midland Bank, owner of a banking house founded by his family, and was chairman of the Bank of West Africa. He also held the honorary post of Lord Lieutenant of Merionethshire between 1938 and 1957. On 12 March 1948 he was appointed as Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter (KG).

Described as having &quot;a deep interest in the arts&quot;, Lord Harlech was trustee of the National Gallery (with brief interval) from 1927, and of the Tate Gallery from 1945 to 1953, chairman of the advisory committee to the Victoria and Albert Museum and of the Standing Commission on Museums and Galleries from 1948 to 1956.
He was the President of the national Library of Wales, 1950–58. He was Pro-Chancellor of the University of Wales and Constable of Harlech and Caernarfon castles.

==Personal life==
Lord Harlech married Lady Beatrice Edith Mildred Gascoyne-Cecil (born 10 August 1891, died 1980), daughter of James Gascoyne-Cecil, 4th Marquess of Salisbury, in 1913. They had six children:
* Mary Hermione Ormsby-Gore (born 7 September 1914, died 26 September 2006), married firstly Captain Robin Francis Campbell in 1936 (divorced 1946) and secondly in 1947 Sir Alexander Lees Mayall, KCVO, CMG.
* Owen Gerard Cecil Ormsby-Gore (born 30 July 1916, died 3 October 1935)
* William David Ormsby-Gore, 5th Baron Harlech (born 20 May 1918, died 26 January 1985)
* Katherine Margaret Alice Ormsby-Gore, DBE (born 4 January 1921, died 22 January 2017), married Maurice Macmillan, Viscount Macmillan of Ovenden, son of Harold Macmillan, 1st Earl of Stockton and Lady Dorothy Cavendish.
* Captain John Julian Stafford Ormsby-Gore (born 12 April 1925, died 18 April 2008), unmarried.
* Elizabeth Jane Ormsby-Gore (born 14 November 1929, died 19 January 2004), married William Simon Pease, 3rd Baron Wardington.

Lord Harlech died in February 1964, aged 78, and was succeeded in the barony by his second, but eldest surviving son David, who followed him into politics and served as British Ambassador to the United States in the 1960s. Beatrice, Lady Harlech, a 
Lady of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth, died in 1980.

<text>Grant George Hackett OAM (born 9 May 1980) is an Australian swimmer, most famous for winning the men&#x27;s 1500 metres freestyle race at both the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney and the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens. This achievement has led him to be regarded as one of the greatest distance swimmers in history. He also collected a gold medal in Sydney for swimming in the heats of the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay. He was well regarded for his versatility, and has held the long course world records in the 200 m, 800 m, and 1500 m freestyle events. He dominated the 1500 m event for a decade, being undefeated in the event in finals from 1996 until the 2007 World Aquatics Championships. In total, he won 10 long-course world championship gold medals.

Hackett was the captain of the Australian swimming team from the time the role was reintroduced in 2005 until his retirement in 2008.

Hackett worked for the Nine Network, often hosting &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;. Hackett&#x27;s contract as a Westpac Banking Corporation ambassador was not renewed in February 2012 after 13 years in the role, but he remains an employee of the organisation. He is currently the Chief Executive Officer of Generation Life.

==Early life==
Hackett was born at Southport on the Gold Coast of Queensland. He is the son of a policeman and younger brother of a Surf Lifesaving champion. Hackett&#x27;s mother, Margaret, had his brother Craig six years before he was born, as she was diagnosed with cancer between the two boys&#x27; births, and was told due to the cancer she was unlikely to ever have more children, however she later fell pregnant with Grant. He attended Merrimac State High School.

==Swimming career==
Hackett first achieved prominence on debut at the 1997 Pan Pacific Championships, where he first won the 1500 metres. He also won the 400 m freestyle, recording his only international victory over the yet-to-be-famous Ian Thorpe at the distance in international long course competition.

===1998 World Championships===
During the 1998 World Championships, he again won the 1500 m but was narrowly upset by Thorpe in the 400 m. He also combined with Thorpe, Michael Klim and Daniel Kowalski to win the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay, beginning a six-year winning streak in the event over the United States.

These results were replicated at the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur. From 1997 to 2007 he was unbeaten in the 1500 m, winning it at every major world competition, including the World Championships, Pan Pacific Championships, Olympics, Commonwealth and Australian Championships.

In 1999, Hackett broke his first world record, unexpectedly breaking Giorgio Lamberti&#x27;s 200 m freestyle world record while leading off his club relay team at the Australian Championships. That record was subsequently broken by Ian Thorpe in the same year at the 1999 Pan Pacific Championships in Sydney, although Hackett himself bettered his old mark. Hackett himself claimed the 1500 m freestyle, and combined with Thorpe, Klim and Bill Kirby to break the world record in the 4 × 200 m freestyle.

===2000 Summer Olympics===


Entering the Sydney Olympics in 2000, Hackett was the overwhelming favourite in the 1500 m freestyle, and was also expected to help Thorpe take a quinella in the 200 m and 400 m events. However, due to a virus, he was well short of his best and finished eighth and seventh, respectively, in these events. He followed this with an extremely slow swim in the heats of the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay, and was dropped from the final quartet, being replaced by Todd Pearson. By the time the final of the 1500 m freestyle came, Hackett had qualified third behind sentimental favourite Kieren Perkins, who was being vocally cheered by the crowd. In the face of the immense pressure, Hackett adopted a more attacking, fast-starting approach, and managed to hang on to claim gold.

===2001 World Championships===
At the 2001 World Championships in Fukuoka, Hackett was in the peak of his speed. He set personal bests in the 200 m, 400 m 800 m and 1500 m freestyle events, finishing second to Thorpe in both 400 m and 800m, and bettering the 800 m world record in the latter. Along with Thorpe, Klim and Kirby, they bettered the previous world record in the 4 × 200 m freestyle. In the 1500 m, Hackett attacked immediately, and stayed well ahead of Perkins&#x27; world record, and with the crowd standing and willing him on, he broke the record by 7 seconds, to claim gold.

===2003 World Championships===
In the 2003 World Championships in Barcelona, Hackett picked up five medals; three gold, a silver and a bronze. Despite capturing individual medals in 200, 400, 800 and 1500 freestyle events for the first time in an international meet, Hackett failed to break any personal best times.

===2004 Summer Olympics===



At 196 cm (six foot five) and 89.8 kg (198 pounds), Hackett won the gruelling 1500 metres race by sheer physical strength and stamina. He showed this in Sydney when he won despite having only partly recovered from illness, and again in Athens, when he survived challenges from swimmers (Larsen Jensen and David Davies) both six years his junior to hang on to win the race, despite a partially collapsed lung. This came after a solid swim in the 400 m to claim silver behind Thorpe, and a lackluster performance in the individual 200 m, 
followed by an unconvincing swim in the lead-off leg of the 4 × 200 m relay, when he was 1.66 seconds off his best. His sluggish heat swim placed him third, raising concerns within the Australian camp. After the Olympics, it was revealed that one of his lungs was partially collapsed, leaving his total lung capacity diminished by 25%.

===2005 World Championships===
In 2005, Swimming Australia introduced the concept of a captain for the swimming team. Hackett was awarded this honour, and led Australia in the World Championships at Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He won gold medals in the 400 m, 800 m and 1500 m freestyle (as well as silver in the 200 m freestyle), the first person to achieve this feat, along with the only swimmer to medal in four distances in a single world championships. His victory in the 800 m event broke Thorpe&#x27;s world record, and his 1500 m victory saw him become the first to win an event four times at a World Championships. He anchored the 4 × 200 m team to bronze with a split of 1:44.84, making him the second fastest performer in relay splits. He was named as FINA&#x27;s Male swimmer of the meet.

In November 2005, Hackett announced his withdrawal from the 2006 Commonwealth Games due to being unavailable for the selection trials because of a minor surgery to correct a shoulder injury. However, he was given dispensation to act as a non-competing captain in order to mentor the fellow swimmers in the lead-up to the competition.

In late 2006, Hackett relocated to Melbourne for personal reasons. He attributed his disrupted preparation to adjusting with his new regime. Prior to the 2007 World Aquatics Championships, he presented a pessimistic outlook of his prospects.

===2007 World Championships===
He qualified last in the 400 m event, but led in the final before fading in the last lap to take the bronze medal. He qualified fifth in the 800 m event, but finished seventh, more than ten seconds behind the winner. In the 1500 m final Hackett came seventh, ending his decade long unbeaten streak in the event.

In December 2007, Hackett competed in and won his first national championship 10 km Open Water race. By barely edging out veteran open-water swimmer and surf Ironman Ky Hurst, the pair both qualified for the World Championships in Seville, Spain. However, Hackett failed to finish in the top 10 in this event, and therefore missed out on qualifying for the 10 km open water swim at the 2008 Summer Olympics. He was also criticised for appearing to be overweight after the event, a claim that he rejected as &quot;ridiculous&quot;.

At the 2008 Victorian Short Course Swimming Championships, his final Australian meet before departing for the Olympics, Hackett broke his own 800 metres freestyle world record – lowering the mark by almost two seconds to 7:23.42.

===2008 Olympics===

Though Hackett failed to qualify for the 10,000m; he succeeded in other events. He swam the 400m and 1500m freestyle and the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay. In the 1500m he finished second, winning the silver medal behind Tunisian Oussama Mellouli. Had he won, he would have been the first male swimmer to win three successive Olympic titles in the same event, an opportunity denied to two-time Olympic 1500m champion Vladimir Salnikov due to the 1984 Summer Olympics communist boycott. Hackett won the individual 200m freestyle swim at the Olympic trials but as he was not seeking a berth in the event he handed his spot in the Olympic competition in this event to the third-place finisher at the trials, Nicholas Sprenger.

===2015 World Championships Comeback===
After six and half years since racing a major competition and after six months of training under his belt. At the Australian Championships, Hackett finished fourth in the 200m freestyle, qualifying for the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay for the 2015 World Aquatics Championships. He also won a bronze medal in the 400m freestyle. At the 2015 World Championships in Kazan, he won a bronze medal for swimming in the heats of the 4 × 200 m freestyle relay, thereby winning his first international medal since the 2008 Olympics.

==Career best times==
Hackett has set quite a number of world records both short course and long course. His world records in the 1500 metre (long course and short course) and 800 metre short course were the only men&#x27;s world records that survived the 2008/2009 release of the high tech Polyurethane suits.

==Media career==
Hackett is currently contracted to the Nine Network, having previously worked with the Seven Network.

In October 2008, Hackett joined &quot;Nine News Melbourne&quot; as the weekend sport presenter, replacing Heath O&#x27;Loughlin. However, in November 2009, Nine announced that Hackett would no longer continue as weekend sports presenter, but would continue with the network in other capacities.

Hackett was an expert commentator for Amazon Prime Video for the 2021 Swimming Australia Olympic Trials and the 2022 Australian Swimming Championships.

==Personal life==
Hackett holds a double degree in commerce and law, and an executive MBA from Bond University.

On 14 April 2007, Hackett married Australian singer Candice Alley. In March 2009, Hackett announced that his wife was expecting twins and in September she gave birth to a son named Jagger Emilio and a girl named Charlize Alley. On 3 May 2012, Alley and Hackett announced that they were separating. They divorced in August 2013.

In December 2020, Hackett married his partner Sharlene Fletcher. They have a son Edward together. In August 2023, they had their second child together - a daughter, Olympia. He is an advocate for Mental Health.

==Controversies==
On 29 October 2011, police were called to attend a dispute at Hackett and Alley&#x27;s Melbourne apartment, which was reportedly found in disarray.

Hackett was questioned by police for an alleged assault during a flight from Adelaide to Melbourne on 17 April 2016. Police sources say that he &quot;went to the toilet for an extended period, taking a bag with him. He emerged aggressive and agitated, taking offence to a male business class passenger who reclined his seat&quot;. He reportedly abused and grabbed the passenger on the chest before crew restrained him and contacted Federal Police. The victim alleged he was sexually assaulted, accusing Hackett of groping him. The man alleged that Hackett &quot;tweaked my nipple quite forcefully.&quot; Hackett said he had no recollection of touching the man&#x27;s nipple, and said that the incident followed a period of heavy drinking. Hackett said he &quot;stuffed up&quot; and was embarrassed by his actions. The victim chose not to press charges after receiving a personal apology.

On 15 February 2017 Hackett was arrested following a disturbance at his parents&#x27; house on Queensland&#x27;s Gold Coast. Hackett had previously admitted a reliance on sleeping pills and had been battling mental health issues. Later that same day, his parents reported him missing from home, but before he was reported missing, Hackett posted a photo of himself on Instagram with cuts and bruises to his face and said his brother had beaten him. Hackett was subsequently found safe.

==Honours==
Hackett received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000, and both a Centenary Medal and a Medal of the Order of Australia in 2001, the latter for his 2000 gold medal win.

==Awards==
In 2004 he was granted the &quot;Key to the City of Gold Coast&quot; in recognition of his outstanding achievement as a swimming champion. He was named as the Australian Swimmer of the Year in 2005, and was also named the World Swimmer of the Year by &quot;Swimming World&quot; magazine. In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, Grant Hackett was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for his role as a &quot;sports legend&quot;. In 2010 he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame, and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 2014.

<text>Darren Thomas Praznik (born May 9, 1961) is a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a cabinet minister in the Progressive Conservative government of Gary Filmon, and considered running for the party&#x27;s leadership in 2000.

Praznik was born in Selkirk, Manitoba, and attended the University of Winnipeg and the University of Manitoba. He was called to the Manitoba bar in 1986, and worked as a barrister and solicitor. He also joined the Board of Directors on the Manitoba Oil and Gas Corporation (for one term), and was a special assistant to the federal Health minister between 1986 and 1988.

Praznik first ran for the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1986 general election, in the rural northeastern riding of Lac du Bonnet. He was defeated by Clarence Baker of the New Democratic Party, 3903 votes to 3601.

Praznik was elected for Lac du Bonnet in the 1988 general election (defeating Baker by over 800 votes), and was soon named legislative assistant to Gary Filmon, the newly elected Premier.

Praznik was re-elected in the 1990 election and was promoted to Minister of Labour, a position that he held until 1995. He held several other portfolios in the Filmon government, including Minister of Northern Affairs (1993–1997), Minister of Energy and Mines (1995–1997), Minister of Health (1997–1999), and Minister of Highways and Transportation and Government House Leader (February to October 1999). As Health Minister, Praznik presided over a number of cutbacks in government funding, but was also responsible for expanding the government&#x27;s home care delivery system.

Filmon&#x27;s Tories were defeated by Gary Doer&#x27;s New Democrats in the 1999 election, and Praznik moved into the opposition. He considered running against Stuart Murray for the party&#x27;s leadership in 2000, but left the race well before the convention took place. Murray was subsequently elected without opposition.

Praznik resigned from the legislature in 2002 to become executive director of government relations with the Canadian Blood Services. In 2007, he became president and CEO of the Canadian Cosmetic, Toiletry and Fragrance Association.

<doc id="918070" wikidata="Q707678" url="?curid=918070" title="Anglo-German Naval Agreement">
<text>The Anglo-German Naval Agreement (AGNA) of 18 June 1935 was a naval agreement between the United Kingdom and Germany regulating the size of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; in relation to the Royal Navy.

The Anglo-German Naval Agreement fixed a ratio whereby the total tonnage of the Kriegsmarine was to be 35% of the total tonnage of the Royal Navy on a permanent basis. It was registered in &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on 12 July 1935. The agreement was abrogated by Adolf Hitler on 28 April 1939.

The Anglo-German Naval Agreement was an ambitious attempt on the part of both the British and the Germans to reach better relations, but it ultimately foundered because of conflicting expectations between the two countries. For Germany, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was intended to mark the beginning of an Anglo-German alliance against France and the Soviet Union, whereas for Britain, the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was to be the beginning of a series of arms limitation agreements that were made to limit German expansionism. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement had been controversial ever since because the 35:100 tonnage ratio allowed Germany the right to build a navy beyond the limits set by the Treaty of Versailles and because London had made the agreement without consulting the French or Italian governments.

==Background==
Part V of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles had imposed severe restrictions on the size and capacities of Germany&#x27;s armed forces. Germany was allowed no submarines, no naval aviation, and only six obsolete pre-dreadnought battleships; the total naval forces allowed to the Germans were six armoured vessels of no more than 10,000 tons displacement, six light cruisers of no more than 6,000 tons displacement, twelve destroyers of no more than 800 tonnes displacement, and twelve torpedo boats.

Through the interwar years German opinion had protested these restrictions as harsh and unjust, and demanded that either all the other states of Europe disarm to German levels, or Germany be allowed to rearm to the level of all the other European states. In Britain, where after 1919 guilt was felt over what was seen as the excessively harsh terms of Versailles, the German claim to &quot;equality&quot; in armaments often met with considerable sympathy. More importantly, every German government of the Weimar Republic was implacably opposed to the terms of Versailles, and given that Germany was potentially Europe&#x27;s strongest power, from the British perspective it made sense to revise Versailles in Germany&#x27;s favour as the best way of preserving the peace. The British attitude was well summarised in a Foreign Office memo from 1935 that stated &quot;... from the earliest years following the war it was our policy to eliminate those parts of the Peace Settlement which, as practical people, we knew to be unstable and indefensible&quot;.

The change of regime in Germany in 1933 caused alarm in London, but there was considerable uncertainty regarding Hitler&#x27;s long-term intentions. The Secretary to the Committee of Imperial Defence (CID), Sir Maurice Hankey, visited Germany in August 1933, and wrote a report of his impressions of the &quot;New Germany&quot; that October. His report concluded with the words:

:&quot;Are we still dealing with the Hitler of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;, lulling his opponents to sleep with fair words to gain time to arm his people, and looking always to the day when he can throw off the mask and attack Poland? Or is it a new Hitler, who discovered the burden of responsible office, and wants to extricate himself, like many an earlier tyrant from the commitments of his irresponsible days? That is the riddle that has to be solved&quot;.

That uncertainty over Hitler&#x27;s ultimate intentions in foreign policy was to colour much of the British policy towards Germany until 1939.

==London Naval Conference==
Equally important as one of the origins of the agreement were the deep cuts made to the Royal Navy after the Washington Naval Conference of 1921–1922 and the London Naval Conference of 1930. The cuts imposed by the two conferences, combined with the effects of the Great Depression, caused the collapse of much of the British shipbuilding industry in the early 1930s. That seriously hindered efforts at British naval rearmament later in the decade, leading the British Admiralty to value treaties with quantitative and qualitative limitations on potential enemies as the best way of ensuring the Royal Navy&#x27;s sea supremacy. Maiolo argues that it was actually of little importance whether potential enemies placed voluntary limitations on the size and the scale of their navies. In particular, Admiral Sir Ernle Chatfield, the First Sea Lord between 1933 and 1938, came to argue in favour of such treaties. They promised a standardised classification of different warships and discouraged technical innovations, which under existing conditions the Royal Navy could not always hope to match. Chatfield especially wished for the Germans to do away with their &quot;Panzerschiffe&quot; (known in the London press as &quot;pocket battleships&quot;), as such ships, embracing the characteristics of both battleships and cruisers, were dangerous to his vision of a world of regulated warship types and designs. As part of the effort to do away with the &quot;Panzerschiffe&quot;, the British Admiralty stated in March 1932 and again in the spring of 1933 that Germany was entitled to &quot;a moral right to some relaxation of the treaty [of Versailles]&quot;.

==World Disarmament Conference==
In February 1932, the World Disarmament Conference opened in Geneva. Among the most hotly-debated issues at the conference was the German demand for &quot;Gleichberechtigung&quot; (&quot;equality of armaments&quot;, abolishing Part V of Versailles) as opposed to the French demand for &quot;sécurité&quot; (&quot;security&quot;), maintaining Part V. The British attempted to play the &quot;honest broker&quot; and sought to seek a compromise between the French claim to &quot;sécurité&quot; and the German claim to &quot;Gleichberechtigung&quot;, which in practice meant backing the German claim to rearm beyond Part V, but not allowing the Germans to rearm enough to threaten France. Several of the British compromise proposals along those lines were rejected by both the French and the German delegations as unacceptable.

In September 1932, Germany walked out of the conference and claimed it was impossible to achieve &quot;Gleichberechtigung&quot;. By then, the electoral success of the Nazis had alarmed London, and it was felt unless the Weimar Republic could achieve some dramatic foreign policy success, Hitler might come to power. To lure the Germans back to Geneva, after several months of strong diplomatic pressure by London on Paris, all of the other delegations voted for a British-sponsored resolution in December 1932 that would allow for the &quot;theoretical equality of rights in a system which would provide security for all nations&quot;. Germany agreed to return to the conference. Thus, before Hitler had become chancellor, it had been accepted that Germany could rearm beyond the limits set by Versailles, but the precise extent of German rearmament was still open to negotiation.

==Adolf Hitler==
During the 1920s, Hitler&#x27;s thinking on foreign policy went through a dramatic change. At the beginning of his political career, Hitler was hostile to Britain and considered it an enemy of the &quot;Reich&quot;. However, after the British opposed the French occupation of the Ruhr in 1923, he came to rank Britain as a potential ally. In &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; and even more in its sequel, &quot;Zweites Buch&quot;, Hitler strongly criticised the pre-1914 German government for embarking on a naval and colonial challenge to the British Empire and in Hitler&#x27;s view, needlessly antagonising Britain. In Hitler&#x27;s view, Britain was a fellow &quot;Aryan&quot; power, whose friendship could be won by a German &quot;renunciation&quot; of naval and colonial ambitions against Britain. In return for such a &quot;renunciation&quot;, Hitler expected an Anglo-German alliance directed at France and the Soviet Union and British support for the German efforts to acquire &quot;Lebensraum&quot; in Eastern Europe. As the first step towards the Anglo-German alliance, Hitler had written in &quot;Mein Kampf&quot; of his intention to seek a &quot;sea pact&quot;, by which Germany would &quot;renounce&quot; any naval challenge against Britain.

In January 1933, Hitler became the German chancellor. The new government in Germany had inherited a strong negotiating position at Geneva from the previous government of General Kurt von Schleicher. The German strategy was to make idealistic offers of limited rearmament out of the expectation that all such offers would be rejected by the French, which would allow Germany to go on ultimately with the maximum rearmament. The ultranationalism of the Nazi regime had alarmed the French, who put the most minimal possible interpretation of German &quot;theoretical equality&quot; in armaments and thereby played into the German strategy. In October 1933, the Germans again walked out of the conference and stated that everyone else should either disarm to the Versailles level or allow Germany to rearm beyond Versailles. 

Though the Germans never had any serious interest in accepting any of the various compromise proposals of the British, in London, the German walk-out was widely, if erroneously, blamed on French &quot;intransigence&quot;. The British government was left with the conviction that opportunities for arms limitation talks with the Germans should no longer be lost because of French &quot;intransigence&quot;. Subsequent offers by the British to arrange for the German return to the World Disarmament Conference were sabotaged by the Germans, who put forward proposals that were meant to appeal to the British but to be unacceptable to the French. On 17 April 1934, the last such effort ended with French Foreign Minister Louis Barthou&#x27;s rejection of the latest German offer as unacceptable in the so-called &quot;Barthou Mote,&quot; which ended French participation in the Conference while declaring that France would look after its own security in whatever way was necessary. Meanwhile, Admiral Erich Raeder of the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; persuaded Hitler of the advantages of ordering two more &quot;Panzerschiffe&quot;, and in 1933 advised the Chancellor that Germany would be best off by 1948 with a fleet of three aircraft carriers, 18 cruisers, eight &quot;Panzerschiffe&quot;, 48 destroyers and 74 U-boats. Raeder argued to Hitler that Germany needed naval parity with France as a minimum goal, but Hitler from April 1933 onwards expressed a desire for a &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; of 33.3% of the total tonnage of the Royal Navy.

In November 1934, the Germans formally informed the British of their wish to reach a treaty under which the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; would be allowed to grow until the size of 35% of the Royal Navy. The figure was raised because the phrase of a German goal of &quot;one third of the Royal Navy except in cruisers, destroyers, and submarines&quot; did not sound quite right in speeches. Raeder felt that the 35:100 ratio was unacceptable towards Germany but was overruled by Hitler, who insisted on the 35:100 ratio. Aware of the German desire to expand their Navy beyond Versailles, Admiral Ernle Chatfield repeatedly advised it would be best to reach a naval treaty with Germany so as to regulate the future size and scale of the German navy. The Admiralty described the idea of a 35:100 tonnage ratio between London and Berlin as &quot;the highest that we could accept for any European power&quot;, but it advised the government that the earliest that Germany could build a navy to that size was 1942 and the Admiralty would prefer a smaller tonnage ratio than 35:100, but it was still acceptable. In December 1934, a study done by Captain Edward King, Director of the Royal Navy&#x27;s Plans Division, suggested that the most dangerous form a future German Navy might take, from the British perspective, would be a &quot;Kreuzerkrieg&quot; (Cruiser war) fleet. Captain King argued that &quot;guerre-de-course&quot; German fleet of &quot;Panzerschiffe&quot;, cruisers, and U-boats operating in task forces would be dangerous for the Royal Navy, and that a German &quot;balanced fleet&quot; that would be a mirror image of the Royal Navy would be the least dangerous form the German Navy could take. A German &quot;balanced fleet&quot; would have proportionally the same number of battleships, cruisers, destroyers, etc. that the British fleet possessed, and from the British point of view, that would be in the event of war, the easiest German fleet to defeat.

==U-boat construction==

Every government of the Weimar Republic had violated Part V of Versailles, but from 1933, the Nazi government became more flagrant and open in violating it. That year, the Germans started to build their first U-boats since World War I, and in April 1935, they launched their first U-boats. On 25 April 1935, the British naval attaché to Germany, Captain Gerard Muirhead-Gould, was officially informed by Captain Leopold Bürkner of the &quot;Reichsmarine&quot; that Germany had laid down twelve 250 ton U-boats at Kiel. On 29 April 1935, British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon informed the British House of Commons that Germany was now building U-boats. On 2 May 1935, Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald told the House of Commons of his government&#x27;s intention to reach a naval pact to regulate the future growth of the German Navy.
In a more general sense, because of Britain&#x27;s championing of German &quot;theoretical equality&quot; at the World Disarmament Conference, London was in a weak moral position to oppose the German violations. The German response to British complaints about violations of Part V were that they were merely unilaterally exercising rights that the British delegation at Geneva had been prepared to concede to the &quot;Reich&quot;. In March 1934, a British Foreign Office memo stated, &quot;Part V of the Treaty of Versailles... is, for practical purposes, dead, and it would become a putrefying corpse which, if left unburied, would soon poison the political atmosphere of Europe. Moreover, if there is to be a funeral, it is clearly better to arrange it while Hitler is still in a mood to pay the undertakers for their services&quot;.

In December 1934, a secret Cabinet committee met to discuss the situation caused by German rearmament. British Foreign Secretary Sir John Simon stated at one of the committee&#x27;s meetings, &quot;If the alternative to legalizing German rearmament was to prevent it, there would be everything to be said, for not legalizing it&quot;. However, since London had already rejected the idea of a war to end German rearmament, the British government chose a diplomatic strategy that would allow abolition of Part V in exchange for German return to both the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference. At the same meeting, Simon stated, &quot;Germany would prefer, it appears, to be &#x27;made an honest woman&#x27;; but if she is left too long to indulge in illegitimate practices and to find by experience that she does not suffer for it, this laudable ambition may wear off&quot;. In January 1935, Simon wrote to George V, &quot;The practical choice is between a Germany which continues to rearm without any regulation or agreement and a Germany which, through getting a recognition of its rights and some modifications of the Peace Treaties enters into the comity of nations and contributes in this or other ways to European stability. As between these two courses, there can be no doubt which is the wiser&quot;. In February 1935, a summit in London between French Premier Pierre Laval and British Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald led to an Anglo-French communiqué issued in London that proposed talks with the Germans on arms limitation, an air pact and security pacts for Eastern Europe and the nations along the Danube.

==Talks==
In early March 1935, talks intended to discuss the scale and extent of German rearmament in Berlin between Hitler and Simon were postponed when Hitler took offence at a British government White Paper that justified a higher defence budget under the grounds that Germany was violating the Versailles Treaty, and Hitler claimed to have contracted a &quot;cold&quot;. In the interval between his &quot;recovering&quot; and Simon&#x27;s visit, the German government took the chance of formally rejecting all the clauses of Versailles relating to land and air disarmament. In the 1930s, the British government was obsessed with the idea of a German bombing attack destroying London and so placed a great deal of value on reaching an air pact outlawing bombing. The idea of a naval agreement was felt to be a useful stepping stone to an air pact. On 26 March 1935, during one of his meetings with Simon and his deputy, Anthony Eden, Hitler stated his intention to reject the naval disarmament section of Versailles but was prepared to discuss a treaty regulating the scale of German naval rearmament. On 21 May 1935, Hitler, in a speech in Berlin, formally offered to discuss a treaty offering a German Navy that was to operate forever on a 35:100 naval ratio. During his &quot;peace speech&quot; of 21 May, Hitler disavowed any intention of engaging in a pre-1914 style naval race with Britain, and he stated: &quot;The German &quot;Reich&quot; government recognises of itself the overwhelming importance for existence and thereby the justification of dominance at sea to protect the British Empire, just as, on the other hand, we are determined to do everything necessary in protection of our own continental existence and freedom&quot;. For Hitler, his speech illustrated the &quot;quid pro quo&quot; of an Anglo-German alliance, the British acceptance of German mastery of Continental Europe in exchange for German acceptance of Britain&#x27;s mastery over the seas.
On 22 May 1935, the British Cabinet voted for formally taking up Hitler&#x27;s offers of 21 May as soon as possible. Sir Eric Phipps, the British ambassador in Berlin, advised London that no chance at a naval agreement with Germany should be lost &quot;owing to French shortsightedness&quot;. Chatfield informed the Cabinet that it was most unwise to &quot;oppose [Hitler&#x27;s] offer, but what the reactions of the French will be to it are more uncertain and its reaction on our own battleship replacement still more so&quot;.

On 27 March 1935, Hitler had appointed Joachim von Ribbentrop to head the German delegation to negotiate any naval treaty. Ribbentrop served as both Hitler&#x27;s Extraordinary Ambassador–Plenipotentiary at Large (making part of the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot;, the German Foreign Office) and as the chief of a Nazi Party organization, the &quot;Dienststelle Ribbentrop&quot;, which competed with the &quot;Auswärtiges Amt&quot;. German Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath was at first opposed to the arrangement but changed his mind when he decided that the British would never accept the 35:100 ratio and so having Ribbentrop head the mission was the best way to discredit his rival.

On 2 June 1935, Ribbentrop arrived in London. The talks began on Tuesday, 4 June 1935, at the Admiralty office, with Ribbentrop heading the German delegation and Simon the British delegation. Ribbentrop, who was determined to succeed at his mission at any cost, began his talks by stating the British could accept the 35:100 ratio as &quot;fixed and unalterable&quot; by the weekend, or the German delegation would go home in which case the Germans would build their navy up to any size that they wished. Simon was visibly angry with Ribbentrop&#x27;s behaviour: &quot;It is not usual to make such conditions at the beginning of negotiations&quot;. Simon walked out of the talks.

On 5 June 1935, a change of opinion came over the British delegation. In a report to the British Cabinet, it was &quot;definitely of the opinion that, in our own interest, we should accept this offer of Herr Hitler&#x27;s while it is still open... If we now refuse to accept the offer for the purposes of these discussions, Herr Hitler will withdraw the offer and Germany will seek to build to a higher level than 35 per cent... Having regard to past history and to Germany&#x27;s known capacity to become a serious naval rival of this country, we may have cause to regret it if we fail to take this chance...&quot;. Also, on 5 June, during talks between Sir Robert Craigie, the British Foreign Office&#x27;s naval expert and chief of the Foreign Office&#x27;s American Department, and Ribbentrop&#x27;s deputy, Admiral Karlgeorg Schuster, the Germans conceded that the 35:100 ratio would be expressed in ship tonnage, the Germans building their tonnage up to whatever the British tonnage was in various warship categories. In the afternoon of that same day, the British Cabinet voted to accept the 35:100 ratio, and Ribbentrop was informed of the Cabinet&#x27;s acceptance in the evening.

During the next two weeks, talks continued in London on various technical issues, mostly relating to how the tonnage ratios would be calculated in the various warship categories. For example, when it came to submarines, the Kriegsmarine was allowed to have 45% as many submarines as the Royal Navy. However, under certain circumstances this could be increased to 100%. Ribbentrop was desperate for success and so agreed to almost all of the British demands. On 18 June 1935, the agreement was signed in London by Ribbentrop, and the new British Foreign Secretary, Sir Samuel Hoare. Hitler called 18 June 1935, the day of the signing, &quot;the happiest day of his life&quot;, as he believed that it marked the beginning of an Anglo-German alliance.

==French reaction==
The Naval Pact was signed in London on 18 June 1935 without the British government consulting with France and Italy or later informing them of the secret agreements, which stipulated that the Germans could build in certain categories more powerful warships than any of the three other major Western European nations then possessed. The French government regarded that as treachery and saw it as a further appeasement of Hitler, whose appetite grew on concessions. Also, it resented that the British agreement had for private gain further weakened the peace treaty, which added to Germany&#x27;s growing overall military power. France contended that the British had no legal right to absolve Germany from respecting the naval clauses of the Versailles Treaty.

As an additional insult for France, the Naval Pact was signed on the 120th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo, in which Prussian and British-led troops defeated the French under Napoleon.

== Impact ==

Because of the lengthy period needed to construct warships and the short duration of the agreement, its impact was limited. It was estimated by both German and British naval experts that the earliest year that Germany could reach the 35% limit was 1942. In practice, the lack of shipbuilding space, design problems, shortages of skilled workers and the scarcity of foreign exchange to purchase necessary raw materials slowed the rebuilding of the German Navy. A lack of steel and non-ferrous metals caused by the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; being third in terms of German rearmament priorities, behind the Heer and the Luftwaffe, led to the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (as the German Navy had been renamed in 1935) being still far from the 35% limit when Hitler denounced the agreement in 1939.

The requirement for the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to divide its 35% tonnage ratio by warship categories had the effect of forcing the Germans to build a symmetrical &quot;balanced fleet&quot; shipbuilding program that reflected the British priorities. Since the Royal Navy&#x27;s leadership thought that the &quot;balanced fleet&quot; would be the easiest German fleet to defeat and a German &quot;guerre-de-course&quot; fleet the most dangerous, the agreement brought the British considerable strategic benefits. Above all, since the Royal Navy did not build &quot;pocket battleships&quot;, Chatfield valued the end of the &quot;Panzerschiff&quot; building.

When the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; began planning for a war against Britain in May 1938, the &quot;Kriegsmarine&#x27;s&quot; senior operations officer, Commander Hellmuth Heye, concluded the best strategy for the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; was a &quot;Kreuzerkrieg&quot; fleet of U-boats, light cruisers and &quot;Panzerschiff&quot; operating in tandem. He was critical of the existing building priorities dictated by the agreement since there was no realistic possibility of a German &quot;balanced fleet&quot; defeating the Royal Navy. In response, senior German naval officers started to advocate a switch to a &quot;Kreuzerkrieg&quot; type fleet, which would pursue a &quot;guerre-de-course&quot; strategy of attacking the British Merchant Marine, but they were overruled by Hitler, who insisted on the prestige of Germany building a &quot;balanced fleet&quot;. Such a fleet would attempt a Mahanian strategy of winning maritime supremacy by a decisive battle with the Royal Navy in the North Sea. Historians such as Joseph Maiolo, Geoffrey Till and the authors of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; Official History have agreed with Chatfield&#x27;s contention that a &quot;Kreuzerkrieg&quot; fleet offered Germany the best chance for damaging Britain&#x27;s power and that the British benefited strategically by ensuring that such a fleet was not built in the 1930s.
In the field of Anglo-German relations, the agreement had considerable importance. The British expressed hope, as Craigie informed Ribbentrop, that it &quot;was designed to facilitate further agreements within a wider framework and there was no further thought behind it&quot;. In addition, the British viewed it as a &quot;yardstick&quot; for measuring German intentions towards them. Hitler regarded it as marking the beginning of an Anglo-German alliance and was much annoyed when that did not result.

By 1937, Hitler started to increase both the sums of &quot;Reichsmark&quot; and raw materials to the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; and reflected the increasing conviction that if war came, the British would be an enemy, not an ally, of Germany. In December 1937, Hitler ordered the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; to start laying down six 16-inch gun battleships. At his meeting with British Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax in November 1937, Hitler stated that the agreement was the only item in the field of Anglo-German relations that had not been &quot;wrecked&quot;.

By 1938, the only use the Germans had for the agreement was to threaten to renounce it as a way of pressuring London to accept Continental Europe as Germany&#x27;s rightful sphere of influence. At a meeting on 16 April 1938 between Sir Nevile Henderson, the British ambassador to Germany, and Hermann Göring, the latter stated it had never been valued in England and that he bitterly regretted that Herr Hitler had ever consented to it at the time without getting anything in exchange. The agreement had been a mistake, but Germany was nevertheless not going to remain in a state of inferiority in this respect &quot;vis-à-vis&quot; a hostile Britain and would build up to a 100% basis.

In response to Göring&#x27;s statement, a joint Admiralty-Foreign Office note was sent to Henderson to inform him that he should inform the Germans:
&quot;Field Marshal Göring&#x27;s threat that in certain circumstances Germany might, presumably after denouncing the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935, proceed to build up to 100% of the British fleet &quot;is clearly bluff&quot; [emphasis in the original]. In view of the great existing disparities in the size of the two navies this threat could only be executed if British construction were to remain stationary over a considerable period of years whilst German tonnage was built up to it. This would not occur. &quot;Although Germany is doubtless capable of realizing the 35% figure by 1942 if she so desires&quot;, or even appreciably earlier, it seems unlikely (considering her difficulties in connection with raw material, foreign exchange and the necessity of giving priority to her vast rearmament on land and in the air, and considering our own big programme) that she would appreciably exceed that figure during the next few years. This is not to say we have not every interest in avoiding a denunciation of the Anglo-German Agreement of 1935, which would create a present state of uncertainty as to Germany&#x27;s intentions and the ultimate threat of an attempt at parity with our Navy, which must be regarded as potentially dangerous given that Germany has been credited with a capacity for naval construction little inferior to our own. Indeed, so important is the Naval Agreement to His Majesty&#x27;s Government that it is difficult to conceive that any general understanding between Great Britain and Germany, such as General Göring is believed to desire, would any longer be possible were the German Government to denounce the Naval Agreement. &quot;In fact, a reaffirmation of the latter in all probability have to figure as part of such a general understanding.&quot;

The German Navy was for Germany mainly an instrument for putting political pressure on Britain. Before the war, Germany would have been willing to cease or moderate its naval competition with Britain but only in return for a promise of its neutrality in any European conflict. Hitler attempted the same thing by different methods, but like other German politicians, he saw only one side of the picture. It is clear from his writings that he was enormously impressed with the part played by the prewar naval rivalry in creating bad relations between the two countries. Thus, he argued that the removal of that rivalry was all that was necessary to obtain good relations. By making a free gift of an absence of naval competition, he hoped that relations between the two countries would be so improved that Britain should not, in fact, find it necessary to interfere with Germany&#x27;s continental policy.

He overlooked, like other German politicians, that Britain was bound to react not only against danger from any purely-naval rival but also against dominance of Europe by any aggressive military power, particularly if that power is in a position to threaten the Low Countries and the Channel Ports. British complaisance could never be purchased by trading one of the factors against the other, and any country that attempted so would be bound to create disappointment and disillusion, as Germany did.

==Munich Agreement and denunciation==
At the conference in Munich that led to the Munich Agreement in September 1938, Hitler informed Neville Chamberlain that if the British policy was &quot;to make it clear in certain circumstances&quot; that Britain might be intervening in a mainland European war, the political preconditions for the agreement no longer existed, and Germany should denounce it. That led to Chamberlain including mention of it in the Anglo-German Declaration of 30 September 1938.
By the late 1930s, Hitler&#x27;s disillusionment with Britain led to German foreign policy taking an increasing-anti-British course. An important sign of Hitler&#x27;s changed perceptions about Britain was his decision in January 1939 to give first priority to the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; in allocations of money, skilled workers and raw materials and to launch Plan Z to build a colossal &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; of 10 battleships, 16 &quot;pocket battleships&quot;, 8 aircraft carriers, 5 heavy cruisers, 36 light cruisers and 249 U-boats by 1944, which were purposed to crush the Royal Navy. Since the fleet envisioned in the Z Plan was considerably larger than allowed by the 35:100 ratio in the agreement, it was inevitable that Germany would renounce it. Over the winter of 1938–1939, it became clearer to London that the Germans no longer intended to abide by the agreement, which played a role in straining Anglo-German relations. Reports received in October 1938 that the Germans were considering denouncing the agreement were used by Halifax in Cabinet discussions for the need for a tougher policy with the &quot;Reich&quot;. The German statement of 9 December 1938 of intending to build to 100% ratio allowed in submarines by the agreement and to the limits in heavy cruisers led to a speech by Chamberlain before the correspondents of the German News Agency in London that warned of the &quot;futility of ambition, if ambition leads to the desire for domination&quot;.

At the same time, Halifax informed Herbert von Dirksen, the German ambassador to Britain, that his government viewed the talks to discuss the details of the German building escalation as a test case for German sincerity. When the talks began in Berlin on 30 December 1938, the Germans took an obdurate approach, which led London to conclude that the Germans did not wish for the talks to succeed.

In response to the British &quot;guarantee&quot; of Poland of 31 March 1939, Hitler, enraged by the British move, proclaimed, &quot;I shall brew them a devil&#x27;s drink&quot;. In a speech in Wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship Tirpitz, Hitler threatened to denounce the agreement if Britain persisted with its &quot;encirclement&quot; policy, as was represented by the &quot;guarantee&quot; of Polish independence. On 28 April 1939, Hitler denounced the agreement. To provide an excuse for its denunciation of and to prevent the emergence of a new naval treaty, the Germans began refusing to share information about their shipbuilding, which left Britain with the choice of either accepting the unilateral German move or rejecting it and providing the Germans with the excuse to denounce it.

At a Cabinet meeting on 3 May 1939, the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Stanhope, stated that &quot;at the present time Germany was building ships as fast as she could but that she would not be able to exceed the 35 per cent ratio before 1942 or 1943&quot;. Chatfield, now the Minister for Co-ordination of Defence, commented that Hitler had &quot;persuaded himself&quot; that the British had provided the &quot;Reich&quot; with a &quot;free hand&quot; in Eastern Europe in exchange for the agreement. Chamberlain stated that the British had never given such an understanding to Germany, and he commented that he first learned of Hitler&#x27;s belief in such an implied bargain during his meeting with the Führer at the Berchtesgaden summit in September 1938. In a later paper to the Cabinet, Chatfield stated &quot;that we might say that we now understood Herr Hitler had in 1935 thought that we had given him a free hand in Eastern and Central Europe in return for his acceptance of the 100:35 ratio, but that as we could not accept the correctness of this view it might be better that the 1935 arrangements should be abrogated&quot;.

In the end, the British reply to the German move was a diplomatic note strongly disputing the German claim that the British were attempting to &quot;encircle&quot; Germany with hostile alliances. The German denunciation and reports of increased German shipbuilding in June 1939 caused by the Z Plan played a significant part in persuading the Chamberlain government of the need to &quot;contain&quot; Germany by building a &quot;Peace Front&quot; of states in both Western and Eastern Europe and raised the perception in the Chamberlain government in 1939 that German policies were a threat to Britain.

<text>Perchance to Dream is a musical romance with book, lyrics and music by Ivor Novello. It was the only musical for which Novello wrote lyrics. The title is a quotation from William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The plot, like many of Novello&#x27;s plots, is a romantic adventure tale, telling the parallel stories of the fates of several inhabitants of the same house through differing time periods. The stories interconnect and have unforeseen repercussions, one upon the other.

It opened on the London stage at the Hippodrome Theatre on 21 April 1945. The show starred Novello as Sir Graham, Valentine Fayre and Bay Fayre; Margaret Rutherford as Lady Charlotte Fayre; Olive Gilbert as Ernestine Flavelle, later called Mrs. Bridport; Roma Beaumont as Melinda Fayre, Melanie and Melody; Muriel Barron as Lydia Lyddington, Veronica Lyddington and Iris; and Bobbie Andrews as William Fayre. Zena Dare was a replacement as Lady Charlotte. Sylvia Cecil replaced Muriel Barron during the run. It was directed by Jack Minster, with choreography by Frank Staff and Keith Lester. The musical is one of Novello&#x27;s most successful works and enjoyed an original run of 1,022 performances (the longest of any of Novello&#x27;s runs) and finally closed on 11 October 1948. It enjoyed many subsequent tours and revivals. A 2011 revival at the Finborough Theatre, London, was the first professional production since the 1980s. The hit song of the show was &quot;We&#x27;ll Gather Lilacs&quot;.

==Synopsis==
;Act I
During the Regency period, Sir Graham Rodney, an impoverished womaniser, is living off the largess of Lady Charlotte, his rich aunt. He is the owner of a magnificent old Georgian country house, called &quot;Huntersmoon&quot;. Lydia Lyddington, a Drury Lane actress, is Sir Graham&#x27;s lover and lives with him, as does her friend, also an actress. Sir Graham&#x27;s hated cousin William Fayre covets Huntersmoon and dogs Sir Graham&#x27;s steps. Sir Graham disguises himself to become the notorious highwayman, &quot;Frenchy&quot;, to pay his debts and add excitement to his life of leisure. He robs a coach and takes a necklace but finds that the coach contains Lady Fayre and her ward Melinda. They soon meet at Huntersmoon, and he falls in love with Melinda. He dies in Melinda&#x27;s arms after being shot in another highway robbery gone wrong, telling Melinda that they will find each other again in another life, and leaving Lydia pregnant. Huntersmoon devolves to William and some unhappy ghosts.

;Act II
More than three decades later, in the early Victorian era, William&#x27;s son, Valentine Fayre, owns Huntersmoon. He is a composer to Queen Victoria. He marries Veronica Lyddington, the illegitimate daughter of the late Sir Graham and Lydia. They live amidst the ghosts of their predecessors. Valentine meets Melanie, Sir Graham&#x27;s niece; they fall in love and plan to run away together, but Veronica reveals that she is pregnant. Valentine is in despair when Melanie commits suicide.

;Act III
In 1945, Valentine&#x27;s grandson, Bay Fayre, wins the hand of Melody, the girl who represents the love that he had lost in earlier generations. The romance finally lays the ghosts to rest and all ends happily.

<text>Piita Taqtu Irniq, formerly Peter Irniq, (born February 1, 1947) is an Inuk politician in Canada, who served as the second commissioner of Nunavut from April 2000 to April 2005.

==Biography==

Born in Lyon Inlet near Repulse Bay, Northwest Territories (now Naujaat, Nunavut). Irniq is an Inuit cultural teacher and has lived most of his life in the Kivalliq Region of Nunavut, including Naujaat, Coral Harbour, Baker Lake, Chesterfield Inlet, Rankin Inlet, and Iqaluit. He has also lived in the Western Arctic (Northwest Territories), Manitoba and Ontario.

Irniq was the executive assistant to the assistant commissioner of the NWT. from 1974 to 1975. He was elected to the 1975 Northwest Territories general election and represented the riding of the Keewatin Region for four years. He was the first Inuk to be made assistant regional director for the Department of the Executive in the former Keewatin Region (Kivalliq Region), 1979 until 1981.

As superintendent of renewable resources, he was the first Inuk to hold this position and encouraged the hiring of Inuit into the department. In 1982, Irniq was appointed the first Speaker of the Keewatin Council, a position he held until 1983. Elected [president of the Keewatin Inuit Association, he served in this capacity for five years.

Irniq was re-elected to the Northwest Territories Legislature in the 1987 general election for the Aivilik electoral district. He ran on a platform of encouraging Inuit to participate at higher levels in employment, education, and business. He ran again in the 1991 general election; however, James Arvaluk defeated him.

He was named the executive director of the Inuit Cultural Institute in 1992. A year later, he became director of communications for Nunavut Tunngavik Incorporated.

As a member of the Nunavut Implementation Commission, Irniq served on the Communication and Governmental Operations Committees and was a spokesperson for the Commission on Nunavut in Canada and overseas and was active in seeking justice for the former students of the infamous Joseph Bernier residential school in Chesterfield Inlet, who suffered physical and sexual abuse at the hands of school staff.

Irniq was assistant director, Nunavut, Heritage/Culture, Department of Education, Culture and Employment for the Government of N.W.T. where he was responsible for developing culture and heritage programs and services to meet the needs of the new territory of Nunavut, 1997–98. He became deputy minister of Culture, Language, Elders and Youth, 1998–99. His mandate was to be the guardian of traditional Inuit culture and language.

In August 1999, Irniq was seconded to the Legislative Assembly of Nunavut to set up the offices of the Official Languages, Access to Information and Conflict of Interest Commissioners.

In addition, Irniq writes an Inuit perspective column for the &quot;Nunavut News/North&quot; newspaper.

In 2003, he was made a Commander of the Order of St. John. In 2005, he was appointed to the board of directors of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation. Most recently, he served as a key consultant on the National Film Board of Canada project &quot;&quot;.

<text>Plugs in horticulture are small-sized seedlings grown in seed trays filled with potting soil. This type of plug is used for commercially raising vegetables and bedding plants. Similarly plugs may also refer to small sections of lawn grass sod. After being planted, lawn grass may somewhat spread over an adjacent area.

Plug plants are young plants raised in small, individual cells, ready to be transplanted into containers or a garden. Professionally raised vegetable/flowering plants in controlled conditions during their important formative period (the first 4–6 weeks) can help to ensure plant health and for plants to reach their maximum potential during the harvest/blooming period. Establishing a garden using plug plants is often easier than doing so starting from seed. According to the American National Standards a plug is a cylinder of medium in which a plant is grown. The term is generally used to describe seedlings and rooted cuttings which have been removed from the container but with the medium held intact by the roots.

==Overview==

Planting from plugs reduces the time a crop resides in the ground, and is functional for those with limited space. Plugs can improve yields: a healthy, stocky plant will grow rapidly and symmetrically when planted out, with a potentially greater capacity to withstand pests, disease and drought. Raising some types of seedlings successfully can be difficult, so plug plants can be beneficial for less experienced gardeners. Plug plants are beneficial for gardeners who want to try a new variety or a range of varieties without purchasing numerous packets of seeds and starting the plants from seed. Plug plants are very useful if the sowing window is missed, and plugs can be purchased quickly to replace a crop which has failed.

As a garden develops, interplanting (intercropping) existing crops with plugs plants, ideally companion plants, can improve the productivity of the space and so maximise harvestsa sown crop may not be able to compete with established plants. Plug plants are much easier to weed than sown seedlings, and weeding will need to be done less frequently.

Having semi-grown plants simplifies designing a vegetable plot or container. As plants that have already started growth, the time to attain plant growth is lessened. Within days of planting signs of growth are typically visible: leaves will perk up and roots anchor into the soil. Air pruned plugs are grown in a manner to promote very rapid growth almost immediately after being transplanted to new soil.

Plugs are sometimes used in hillside plasticulture applications, due to the ease in which they are transplanted.

==Plant cultivation and growth==

Plug plants grow more consistently, as has been noted by the commercial scale vegetable growing industry, and more rapidly; large-scale brassica field crops are planted almost exclusively from soil block plugs in some parts of Europe, a trend which is growing in the UK. This success at the commercial scale is testament to the success of plugs in the ground.

It is of note that many varieties actively benefit from being transplanted as severing the taproot encourages bushier root growth. Traditionally nearly all heading brassica are sown in a separate seed bed, thinned, and the best ones planted in a prepared bed after about 6–8 weeks. Many pests want to eat baby brassica; this in combination with its long growing season makes planting brassica from plugs a much easier option.

==Root vegetables==
Root vegetables are typically, but not always, sown from seed, rather than transplanted from plugs, where they are to mature and then be thinned. The thinning action is highly beneficial in itself as it provides soil aeration at depth without disturbing adjacent roots systems. The initial concentration of seedlings also dilutes damage from pests and provided some food for the gardener or the compost in the form of thinnings. Beetroot, carrots and the root brassica family- swede, turnip- will simply not reach their full potential with any check to early root growth. In addition, these seeds are typically inexpensive, and the seedlings are delicate; hence there is little value to the gardener in buying or growing them as plugs.

<text>Henry Cecil John Hunt, Baron Hunt (22 June 1910 – 7 November 1998) was a British Army officer who is best known as the leader of the successful 1953 British expedition to Mount Everest.

==Early life and military career==
Hunt was born in Simla, British India on 22 June 1910, the son of Captain Cecil Edwin Hunt of the Indian Army, and a great-great-nephew of the explorer Sir Richard Burton. His father was killed in action during the First World War. Hunt, from the age of 10, spent much holiday time in the Alps, learning some of the mountaineering skills he would later hone while taking part in several expeditions in the Himalayas while serving in India. He made a guided ascent of Piz Palu at 14. He was educated at Marlborough College before entering the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, where he was awarded the King&#x27;s Gold Medal and the Anson Memorial Sword.

After Sandhurst, Hunt was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the King&#x27;s Royal Rifle Corps (KRRC) on 30 January 1930. Among his fellow graduates were Charles Harington and Alan Brown. In 1931, the regiment was posted to India. He was promoted lieutenant in 1933. Despite his background he seems not to have been entirely comfortable with the prevailing social climate of the Raj. He preferred rugby to polo, and having already gained fluency in German and French he added Urdu and some Bengali. In 1934 he became a Military Intelligence officer in the Indian Army, with the local rank of captain, and was seconded to the Indian Police. At this time the Indian independence movement was gaining ground, and Bengal was particularly affected. Hunt even worked undercover, gathering intelligence in Chittagong while dressed in local clothing. He returned to his regiment in 1935, having been awarded the Indian Police Medal.

Throughout this period Hunt continued to climb in the Himalayas. In 1935, with James Waller&#x27;s group, he attempted Saltoro Kangri, reaching . This exploit led to his election to the Alpine Club and the Royal Geographical Society. He applied to join the 1936 Everest Expedition, but was turned down when an RAF medical discovered a minor heart problem.

He married Joy Mowbray-Green on 3 September 1936, and she also took part (along with Reggie Cooke), in Hunt&#x27;s 1937 Himalayan trip which included reconnaissance of Kangchenjunga, the south-western summit of Nepal Peak, and only the third ascent of the Zemu Gap, between Kangchenjunga and Simvo. Here they saw tracks that one of the party&#x27;s Sherpas told them were those of the Yeti. In 1938 he returned for a further period of secondment in Military Intelligence, being promoted substantive captain.

==Second World War==
Upon returning to the United Kingdom in 1940, Hunt became chief instructor at the Commando Mountain and Snow Warfare School, Braemar. He returned to regimental duty in 1943 as a war substantive major and acting lieutenant colonel, Commanding Officer (CO) of the 11th Battalion of the KRRC. Forming the motorised infantry element of the 23rd Armoured Brigade, Hunt led the battalion in the Italian Campaign. In 1944, Hunt received an immediate award of the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his leadership in bitter fighting on the River Sangro, in addition to his battalion, he commanded attached troops from other arms, and the recommendation for his DSO states that he was constantly in the forefront of the fighting, organising raids and ambushes to keep the enemy forces on the back foot, and himself leading reconnaissance patrols deep behind enemy lines. In October 1944, his battalion was transferred to Greece, just as the tensions that would lead to the Greek Civil War were becoming evident.

In Greece, Hunt was appointed temporary brigadier and given command of the 11th Indian Infantry Brigade, part of the 4th Indian Infantry Division, at Patras. He described attempting to keep the peace between the various factions as &quot;the most tense and difficult period in all my experience, before or since&quot;. For his efforts there Hunt was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in June 1945. In contrast to Italy, he was ordered not to take the initiative and had to cope with large hostile forces threatening him, and infiltration by armed civilians as well as increasing numbers of insults to his troops. Hunt kept the situation calm, and when finally allowed to act, and reinforced he planned and executed a successful operation. He then attended the Staff College, Camberley in 1946, followed by various staff appointments in the Middle East and Europe. He was granted the substantive rank of major in 1946, becoming substantive colonel in 1952.

==Mount Everest==

Hunt was employed on the staff at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force (SHAEF) when he received the surprise invitation to lead the 1953 British Mount Everest expedition. It had been expected that Eric Shipton would lead the expedition, as he had led the (unsuccessful) British attempt on Cho Oyu the previous year from which the majority of the climbers were drawn. However, the Joint Himalayan Committee of the Alpine Club and Royal Geographical Society that oversaw British attempts on Everest decided that Hunt&#x27;s military leadership experience and undoubted climbing credentials would provide the best hope for success. It was felt to be critical that this expedition should be successful as the French had permission to mount an expedition in 1954 and the Swiss in 1955, meaning that the British would not have another opportunity until 1956 at the earliest.

Many members of the expedition felt a strong loyalty to Shipton, and were unhappy with his replacement. Edmund Hillary was one of those most opposed to the change, but was soon won round by Hunt&#x27;s personality and frank admission that the change had been badly handled. Hunt planned for three assaults of two climbers each including &quot;a third and last attempt&quot; if necessary, although after two consecutive assaults a wait would be necessary to &quot;recover our strength&quot; and to replenish the camps. 

Base Camp was established on 12 April 1953. The next few days were taken up with establishing a route through the Khumbu Icefall, and once opened, teams of Sherpas moved tons of supplies up the mountain. A succession of advanced camps were created, slowly forging higher up the mountain. By 21 May, Wilfrid Noyce and Annullu had reached the psychological milestone of the South Col. Hunt had selected two climbing pairs to attempt the summit. The first pair (Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans) set out on 26 May but were forced to turn back after becoming exhausted high on the mountain. On the same day, Hunt himself climbed to with Da Namgyal Sherpa to leave a cache of equipment on the Southeast Ridge for the second summit party. On 28 May, the expedition made its second assault on the summit with the second climbing pair. The summit was eventually reached at 11:30 am on 29 May 1953 by the New Zealander Edmund Hillary and Sherpa Tenzing Norgay from Nepal (Norgay had previously ascended to a record mark on Everest with a Swiss expedition of 1952).

News of the expedition&#x27;s success reached London on the morning of Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation. Returning to Kathmandu a few days later, they discovered that Hillary had been made a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire and Hunt a Knight Bachelor for their efforts. He received his knighthood on his return to London in July 1953. Further honours were showered on Hunt and the expedition team: the Hubbard Medal of the National Geographic Society, the first time the medal was awarded on a collective basis, though individual bronze replicas were made for Hunt, Hillary and Norgay; the Founder&#x27;s Medal of the Royal Geographical Society; the Lawrence medal of the Royal Central Asian Society; and honorary degrees from Aberdeen, Durham, and London universities.

==Later life==

Hunt returned to active duty in the Army, being posted as assistant commandant of Sandhurst. Following his retirement from military service in 1956, when he was granted the honorary rank of brigadier, he became the first Director of the Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme, a post he held for ten years. He left an account of the British Caucasus Expedition in 1958. 

Hunt was Committee Chairman of Plas y Brenin from 1955 to 1965, and in the 1966 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours he was created a Life Peer for his work with young people, his title being gazetted as Baron Hunt, of Llanvair Waterdine in the County of Salop. 

He was the first Chairman of the Parole Board, and his advisory work on policing in Northern Ireland led to the Hunt Report with its recommendation for the disbanding of the B-Specials and creation of a purely military reserve force, which was created as the Ulster Defence Regiment. In 1974 he was appointed to the Royal Commission on the Press. He was invested as a Knight Companion of the Garter in 1979. 

Lord Hunt died on 7 November 1998 aged 88 in Henley-on-Thames, Oxfordshire, having had four daughters.

<text>The Toyota 2000GT is a limited-production front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive, two-door, two-seat sports car/grand tourer designed by Toyota in collaboration with Yamaha. First displayed to the public at the Tokyo Motor Show in 1965, the 2000GT was manufactured under contract by Yamaha between 1967 and 1970. A halo car for the automaker, in Japan it was exclusive to Toyota&#x27;s Japanese retail sales channel called &quot;Toyota Store&quot;.

The 2000GT revolutionized the automotive world&#x27;s view of Japan, then viewed as a producer of imitative and stodgily practical vehicles. As a sleek, high-performance fastback coupé, it demonstrated its auto makers could produce a sports car to rival the better marques of Europe. Reviewing a pre-production 2000GT in 1967, &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; magazine summed up the car as &quot;one of the most exciting and enjoyable cars we&#x27;ve driven&quot;, and compared it favorably to the Porsche 911. Today, the 2000GT is seen as the first seriously collectible Japanese car and its first supercar. Examples of the 2000GT have sold at auction for as much as in 2013.

== Background ==
Automobile ownership in Japan during the late 1950s and early 1960s began to pick up, and Toyota noticed that most international manufacturers had a top level sports car or grand touring coupe, that would draw customers into showrooms and dealerships and drive sales of other more affordable models. Ford had recently introduced the Thunderbird, Chrysler had the C-300 while GM&#x27;s Chevrolet Division had the Corvette. In Europe, Mercedes-Benz had the 300SL, BMW briefly offered the 507, Porsche had the 356, Jaguar had the E-Type, Aston Martin had the DB4, Ferrari had the 250 GT Coupé, and Maserati had the 3500 GT. In Japan, Nissan offered the Datsun Sports, while Honda introduced the S500 and Prince offered the Skyline Sport Coupé. Toyota had already began production of the Sports 800, but the engine was far too small to be considered a world class sports car, and decided they needed to offer a proper 6-cylinder coupe.

Most of the 2000GT&#x27;s design was done by Yamaha Motor Corporation, who also contributed contract assistance for other Japanese manufacturers, including Nissan. In 1959, Yamaha established the Technical Research Institute to develop their own sports car, and had built the YX30 sports car with a 4-cylinder engine displacing 1600cc, having drawn inspiration from the British MGA B-Series 1600 DOHC engine. Due to various problems, Yamaha senior management decided to close the research facility in 1962, but enthusiasm of developing a sports car led to them partnering with an established auto manufacturer. A prototype called the &quot;A550X&quot; was built, but Nissan cancelled the project and introduced the slow selling Nissan Silvia coupe in 1965. Yamaha then proposed the design to Toyota, for whom they also did contract work, then perceived as the most conservative of the Japanese car manufacturers. Wishing to improve their image, Toyota accepted the proposal, but employed a design from their own designer Satoru Nozaki.

== Styling ==
The 2000GT incorporated many classic 1960s Gran Turismo design elements. Nozaki&#x27;s styling was inspired by the E-type Jaguar. Its smoothly flowing bodywork featured pop-up headlights above large plexiglass covered driving lamps flanking the grille similar to those on the Toyota Sports 800. Bumpers were minimal, and the car was extremely low, just 116 cm (45.7 in) to the highest point of the roof. Despite a custom open-top version built for the James Bond film &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, a factory-produced convertible was never offered.
The interior offered comfortable, if cramped, accommodation and luxury touches such as a walnut or rosewood veneer dashboard inlays provided by Yamaha&#x27;s musical instrument woodworking facilities, and an auto-signal seeking radio tuner. &quot;Road &amp; Track&quot; was impressed, considering the interior suited to a &quot;luxurious GT&quot; and calling the 2000GT an impressive car &quot;in which to sit or ride - or simply admire.&quot; An electric clock and a stopwatch were installed in the dashboard below the radio and above the climate controls.

In August 1969, the front was modified slightly, making the driving lamps smaller and changing the shape of the turn signals. The rear turn signals were enlarged at the same time, and some alterations were made to modernise the interior. The last few vehicles were fitted with air conditioning and had automatic transmission as an option. These cars had an additional scoop fitted underneath the grille to supply air to the A/C unit.

==Drivetrain==

The engine was a longitudinally mounted straight-6 (the &quot;3M&quot;) sourced from the Toyota Crown (S50) sedan. It was transformed by Yamaha into a sports car engine by coupling three 2-barrel Mikuni-Solex 40 PHH carburetors to a new DOHC head that produced at 6,600 rpm and at 5,000 rpm.

Nine special &quot;MF-12&quot; models were also built with the larger but lower power output SOHC 2.3 L &quot;2M-B&quot; engine, which produced at 5,800 rpm and at 3,800 rpm of torque.

Fitted with a five-speed manual transmission, the rear wheel drive car was available with three different final drives. A 4.375 ratio axle car was claimed to be capable of reaching 135 mph (217 km/h) and achieve .

Both a limited slip differential and all-around power-assisted disc brake, a first for a Japanese car, were standard. The suspension was coil springs attached to double wishbones at all four wheels installed on a backbone chassis and rode on 15-inch Magnesium alloy wheels. It was also the first Toyota to offer rack and pinion steering as Toyota wanted to establish that this was a world-class sports car. The dashboard-mounted emergency brake gripped the rear discs directly should the primary braking system fail.

== Production ==
Only 337 regular production units of the 2000GT were built, figures comparable to contemporary elite Italian supercars, and according to Toyota, all 337 were sold. The first prototype was built in August 1965, only 11 months after the project had begun. Taking two years for production vehicles to finally emerge, a total of 233 MF10s, 109 MF10Ls, and nine MF12Ls were built at the Yamaha factory in Iwata, Shizuoka according to Toyota and Yamaha data, starting in May 1967 until August 1970. In America, a 1968 2000GT listed for about US$7,150 ($ in dollars ), a moderately higher price than competitors like the $5,539 Jaguar E-Type or the $6,790 Porsche 911S, though much lower than exotics like the $19,700 Ferrari 365 GTB/4. Toyota did not sell very many of the cars, which led to its cancellation in 1970, while it did inspire the company to introduce performance oriented &quot;sporty&quot; coupes that followed in the 1970s.

As a &quot;halo car&quot; for Toyota, it is believed that no profit was made on the 2000GT despite its high price. About 60 units reached North America and the others were similarly thinly spread worldwide. Most 2000GTs were painted either Solar Red or Pegasus White, while other colors were offered such as Thunder Silver metallic, Bellatrix Yellow, Atlantis Green, and Twilight Turquoise metallic.

Yamaha and Toyota also collaborated on another more affordable production car, again using a Toyota engine block while Yamaha developed the DOHC cylinder head, and introduced the Toyota 1600GT, using a 1967 Corona 2-door hardtop coupe. When production of the 2000GT ended, and Toyota had established a reputation of making performance oriented cars, the Celica was exclusively introduced at &quot;Toyota Corolla Store&quot; locations as the top model, again offering a 2.0L DOHC engine with a manual transmission but more affordably priced. Toyota also introduced sport coupes at each of their sales distribution networks, using the same technology in a 2-door coupe with an OHC 4-cylinder engine and a fun-to-drive approach to each car. May 1967 was also the same time the Mazda Cosmo was also introduced.

Lessons learned by Toyota and Yamaha led to the development of the Toyota 7, which was designed primarily for use in FIA Group 7 competition. It was Toyota&#x27;s first purpose-built racing car.

Recognizing that the limited number of original cars may need maintenance to keep the vehicles in drivable condition, Toyota has begun reproducing new parts from original sources, and has made them available to registered owners through the GR Heritage Parts Program.

== Racing ==
Toyota entered the 2000GT in competition at home, coming third in the 1966 Japanese Grand Prix at Fuji. The 2000GT took its first win in the inaugural Suzuka 1000 Kilometres in 1966, and went on to win the 24 Hours of Fuji and the Fuji 1000 Kilometres in 1967. In addition, the car set thirteen FIA world records for speed and endurance in a 72-hour test at the Yatabe High Speed Test Track in 1966. Unfortunately, the record car was destroyed in a pace car accident and eventually scrapped. These records shortly prompted Porsche to prepare a 911R especially to beat this record.

Carroll Shelby also entered a pair of 2000GTs to compete in the 1968 SCCA production car races in the CP category. Initially Shelby built three cars, including one spare. Although it performed well, it was the only season the car competed in the US. Toyota took back one of the cars and rebuilt it into a replica of their record car, which still resides in Japan. The two remaining Shelby cars remain in the United States.

In 2022, one of the Toyota-Shelby 2000GTs sold at auction for US $2.5 million.

== 2000GT Open-Top, the &quot;Bond Model&quot; ==
The 2000GT made its most famous screen appearance in the 1967 James Bond movie &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot;, most of which was filmed in Japan. Two one-off topless models—fitted only with tonneau covers to simulate functioning convertible roofs—were made specially for the film. It is claimed that a targa had been considered to accommodate the burly tall Sean Connery. This retained the original car&#x27;s fastback profile but eliminated rear side windows. Purportedly, Connery&#x27;s head stuck out of the top and a roofless version was fabricated in less than two weeks for the movie. The car was only driven by &quot;Bond girl&quot; Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi) in the film.

Bond actor Daniel Craig voted the 2000GT as his favourite Bond car of all time.

<text>James Mitchell (February 29, 1920 – January 22, 2010) was an American actor and dancer. Although he is best known to television audiences as Palmer Cortlandt on the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; (1979–2010), theatre and dance historians remember him as one of Agnes de Mille&#x27;s leading dancers. Mitchell&#x27;s skill at combining dance and acting was considered something of a novelty; in 1959, the critic Olga Maynard singled him out as &quot;an important example of the new dancer-actor-singer in American ballet&quot;, pointing to his interpretive abilities and &quot;masculine&quot; technique.

==Early life==
Mitchell was born on Leap Day, 1920 in Sacramento, California. His parents emigrated from England to Northern California, where they operated a fruit farm in Turlock. In 1923, Mitchell&#x27;s mother, Edith, left his father and returned to England with Mitchell&#x27;s brother and sister; she and Mitchell had no further contact. Unable to run a farm while single-handedly raising his remaining son, Mitchell&#x27;s father fostered him out for several years to vaudevillians Gene and Katherine King.

After Mitchell&#x27;s mother died, however, his father remarried and brought both of his sons, but not his daughter, back to Turlock. He graduated at Turlock High School. At age seventeen, Mitchell left Turlock for Los Angeles, where he remained close to the Kings.

==Stage and film career==
While studying drama at Los Angeles City College, Mitchell was introduced to modern dance at the school of the famed teacher and choreographer, Lester Horton. After receiving his associate degree, he joined Horton&#x27;s company, where he remained for nearly four years. While working with Horton, he became a close friend of dancer Bella Lewitzky; in the 1970s, he became President of the board of directors of her Dance Foundation, and afterwards remained a &quot;major longtime [...] supporter&quot; of hers. In 1944, Horton took Mitchell to New York with him to form a new dance company, but the venture abruptly collapsed.

As it happened, the failure of Horton&#x27;s company was a significant turning point in Mitchell&#x27;s career: while struggling to find either acting or dancing roles in New York, he successfully auditioned for Agnes de Mille, who was choreographing her first musical since &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. Mitchell, who did not study ballet until he was in his mid-twenties, was at a loss when faced with de Mille&#x27;s ballet combination. Much later, describing his approach to the audition, he said, &quot;Well, I really hadn&#x27;t too much familiarity with that but I threw myself across the floor and about the third or fourth pass, Agnes cried &#x27;Stop&#x27; and summoned me over and said &#x27;Where on earth did you get your dance training?&#x27;&quot;. De Mille nevertheless offered him the dual position of principal dancer and assistant choreographer. Given the option between touring with Helen Hayes and dancing for de Mille, he chose de Mille.

&quot;Bloomer Girl&quot; (1944) began an important artistic partnership with de Mille that lasted from 1944 to 1969 and spanned theater, film, television, and concert dance. De Mille&#x27;s biographer, Carol Easton, describes him as the &quot;quintessential male de Mille dancer&quot; and de Mille&#x27;s &quot;closest confidant&quot; in her artistic life. In one of her autobiographical volumes, de Mille herself said of Mitchell that he had &quot;probably the strongest arms in the business, and the adagio style developed by him and his partners has become since a valued addition to ballet vocabulary.&quot;

When, nearly thirty years later, an interviewer asked Mitchell to respond to de Mille&#x27;s comments, he offered a more modest assessment of his career: &quot;I was primarily an actor [...] and I think what Agnes was referring to was my acting and regard for the woman I was partnering. Because in the end I really was a partner. When I look at today&#x27;s dancers, or I look at the great dance films, such as &quot;Seven Brides for Seven Brothers&quot;--I couldn&#x27;t do any of that! I know I was a dancer, but I didn&#x27;t have the technique. At most I was an actor-dancer.&quot;

Mitchell worked consistently on stage in both musicals and straight dramas until the late 1970s, including numerous regional theatre roles across the country. His other significant credits include Broadway appearances in &quot;Carousel&quot;, &quot;First Impressions&quot;, and &quot;The Deputy&quot;; off-Broadway appearances in &quot;Winkelberg&quot;, &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;, &quot;Livin&#x27; the Life&quot;, and &quot;The Father&quot;; &quot;L&#x27;Histoire du Soldat&quot; at New York City Opera; and national tours of &quot;The Rainmaker&quot; (with future &quot;All My Children&quot; co-star Frances Heflin), &quot;The King and I&quot;, &quot;Funny Girl&quot;, and &quot;The Threepenny Opera&quot;. A character based on Mitchell appears in Anderson Ferrell&#x27;s biographical dance play, &quot;Dance/Speak: The Life of Agnes De Mille,&quot; which debuted at New York Theatre Ballet in 2009.
As a film performer, Mitchell had only moderate success. In the early 1940s, he did both chorus dancing and extra work in a number of minor musicals and westerns.
In 1949, he starred in &quot;The House Across the Street&quot;.
On the strength of his award-winning performance in &quot;Brigadoon&quot;, he was scouted by producer Michael Curtiz and signed to a contract at Warner Brothers. Curtiz initially intended to put Mitchell in a picture with Doris Day that never materialized.

After several months, Mitchell eventually made two films for Warner Brothers, including Raoul Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Colorado Territory&quot;, before following Curtiz to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. At MGM, he played supporting roles in six films between 1949 and 1955, most notably Anthony Mann&#x27;s &quot;Border Incident&quot;, Jacques Tourneur&#x27;s &quot;Stars in My Crown&quot;, and Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s critically lauded &quot;The Band Wagon&quot; (1953), in which he played the unsympathetic role of choreographer Paul Byrd – an experience he loathed so much that he refused to see the film. He did not work for the studio again after appearing in the infamously over-budgeted flop &quot;The Prodigal&quot; (1955). Mitchell&#x27;s film career ended abruptly after he starred in Hal R. Makelim&#x27;s Western &quot;The Peacemaker&quot; (1956), the only time he was ever billed above the title, as he played the lead, gunfighter Terrall Butler. After that, it took over two decades before he made his next and what proved to be his final appearance on the big screen, &quot;The Turning Point&quot; (1977). He also co-starred with Thelma &quot;Tad&quot; Tadlock in the famous sponsored film &quot;A Touch of Magic&quot; presented by General Motors at the 1961 Motorama.

Besides performing, Mitchell occasionally worked as a director and choreographer, particularly in the late 1960s and 1970s. He staged musicals at the Paper Mill Playhouse, the Mark Taper Forum, and The Muny, among other theatres. In 1956, he and Katherine Litz co-staged &quot;The Enchanted&quot; for American Ballet Theatre.

==Television career==
On television, Mitchell was considerably more active, especially in the late 1950s and early 1960s. In addition to working regularly as a dancer, he played dramatic roles in a number of television films and prime-time series, as well as in the anthologies that were once so popular, such as Play of the Week, Gruen Guild Playhouse, and Armstrong Circle Theatre. In 1964, he took his first contract role on a soap opera in &quot;The Edge of Night&quot;, as the corrupt Captain Lloyd Griffin. In 1966, he appeared in an episode of the espionage drama &quot;Blue Light&quot;. This was followed by a role in the entire run of the soap opera &quot;Where the Heart Is&quot; (1969–73), in which he played the male lead, Julian Hathaway.

However, after &quot;Mack &amp; Mabel&quot; flopped in 1974, Mitchell&#x27;s performing career nearly ended altogether. He earned a BA from Empire State College and an MFA from Goddard College to teach full-time at the college level, and taught movement for actors at Juilliard, Yale University, and Drake University. After a few years of almost no work – although he was a guest star on &quot;Lou Grant&quot; and &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; in the late 1970s, he once summed up the 1970s as &quot;I cried and did a lot of gardening&quot;.

He was hired in 1979 as self-made millionaire Palmer Cortlandt alias Pete Cooney on ABC&#x27;s long-running soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. Initially hired for only one year, he remained on contract through 2009. For much of his first decade on the show, Palmer was a ruthless villain, totally possessive of his daughter, Nina and violently threatening his ex-wife Daisy with being attacked by dobermans when she came back from the dead. After the introduction of David Canary in December 1983 as Adam Chandler, Palmer remained ruthless in business dealings, but toned down in romantic relationships. His old ways returned several times, such as when he was revealed to be hoarding stolen artwork and when he tried to kill his last wife, Vanessa, after falsely believing that she had cheated on him. His final appearance as a contract player was September 19, 2008, although his retirement was not made official until September 30, 2009.

==Personal life==
Mitchell&#x27;s partner of thirty-nine years was the Oscar-award-winning costume designer Albert Wolsky.

==Death==

James Mitchell died on January 22, 2010, at age 89, in Los Angeles. His death came after suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease complicated by pneumonia.

<text>Easter Parade is a 1948 American Technicolor musical film directed by Charles Walters, written by Sidney Sheldon, Frances Goodrich, and Albert Hackett from a story by Goodrich and Hackett, and starring Judy Garland, Fred Astaire, Peter Lawford, and Ann Miller. The film contains some of Astaire&#x27;s and Garland&#x27;s best-known songs, including &quot;Easter Parade&quot;, &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out with My Baby&quot;, and &quot;We&#x27;re a Couple of Swells&quot;, all by Irving Berlin.

Gene Kelly was originally cast opposite Garland, but broke his ankle. The part was then offered to Astaire, who had retired two years earlier. Very eager to work again, Astaire consulted Kelly about the offer, and Kelly supported his decision to take the role. Garland and Astaire were a successful team, and Astaire was restored to his status as a top MGM star.

A critical and commercial success, &quot;Easter Parade&quot; was the highest-grossing musical film of 1948, and the second-highest grossing MGM musical of the 1940s, after &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot;.

==Plot==
In 1912, Broadway star Don Hewes buys Easter presents for his sweetheart and dancing partner, Nadine Hale (&quot;Happy Easter&quot;), getting a boy to part with a plush rabbit by playing all the drums in the toy store (&quot;Drum Crazy&quot;). He takes the gifts to Nadine, who has been offered the opportunity to star in a show—solo. He tries to persuade her to stay with him (&quot;It Only Happens When I Dance With You&quot;) but she has signed a contract. Don&#x27;s best friend, Johnny, arrives. Nadine is clearly attracted to Johnny, but he resists her out of respect for Don.

Don drowns his sorrows at the bar at Pastini&#x27;s restaurant, bragging to Johnny and the bartender, Mike, that he can make a star dancer out of any girl from the floor show. He chooses Hannah Brown. The next day, at rehearsal, he learns that she suffers from left/right confusion.

Don tries to turn Hannah into a copy of Nadine, teaching her to dance the same way, buying her a similar wardrobe, and giving her the exotic stage name &quot;Juanita&quot;. She makes several mistakes at their first performance (&quot;Beautiful Faces Need Beautiful Clothes&quot;), and the show is a fiasco.

Johnny is instantly attracted to Hannah, singing &quot;A Fella With an Umbrella&quot; while walking her to rehearsal. He tries unsuccessfully to reunite Don with Nadine, who tells Don her friends are laughing because Hannah is trying to be her. Don realizes his mistakes after Hannah sings—and they dance to—“I Love a Piano&quot;. He prepares routines better suited to her. Now known as &quot;Hannah &amp; Hewes&quot;, they become a great success (&quot;I Love a Piano,&quot; &quot;Snookie-Ookums&quot;, &quot;The Ragtime Violin&quot;, and &quot;When That Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves For Alabam&#x27;”).

Auditioning for the Ziegfeld Follies, Hannah and Don meet the show&#x27;s star—Nadine. Realizing that Nadine is Don&#x27;s former partner, Hannah demands to know whether he loved her. At their hotel, Don reveals that he turned down the Ziegfeld offer, believing Hannah and Nadine do not belong in the same show: Nadine can&#x27;t compare with Hannah. They are about to kiss when Johnny arrives to take Hannah to dinner. He confesses that he fell in love with her during the rainstorm, but Hannah admits that she is hopelessly in love with Don.

Don is in the audience when Nadine&#x27;s show opens (&quot;Shakin&#x27; The Blues Away&quot;). Later, he tells Hannah that he has signed them to star in their own show and invites her out on the town. She arrives at his apartment to find that he has arranged a private dinner. He makes the mistake of mentioning their act, and Hannah explodes, accusing him of treating their rendezvous like a dance rehearsal. She tries to leave, but he kisses her. She plays the piano and sings &quot;It Only Happens When I Dance With You&quot;. &quot;Why didn’t you tell me I was in love with you?&quot; he asks, and they embrace.

Their show features Don and a large chorus (&quot;Steppin&#x27; Out with My Baby&quot;) followed by &quot;We&#x27;re a Couple of Swells&quot;, in which he and Hannah play bums. Afterward, they celebrate at the roof garden, where Nadine is performing. The audience gives them a rousing ovation. Nadine is furious. After dancing to &quot;The Girl on the Magazine Cover&quot;, she insists that Don perform one of their old numbers with her: &quot;It Only Happens When I Dance With You (Reprise)&quot;. Don reluctantly agrees. Hannah leaves.

At Pastini&#x27;s, where she and Don first met, Hannah pours out her troubles to Mike (&quot;Better Luck Next Time&quot;). She finds Don waiting outside her apartment. He tries to explain himself, promising to wait all night for her to forgive him, but the house detective evicts him just before she opens the door. The next morning, Johnny tells Hannah that if he loved someone, he would show them.

Hannah is inspired. Flowers, a chocolate egg and a live bunny in a top hat arrive anonymously at Don&#x27;s apartment, followed by Hannah, who reminds him of their date and sings (&quot;Easter Parade&quot;). Don puts a diamond ring on her left hand as they walk in the Easter parade.

One musical number, a seductive performance of &quot;Mr. Monotony&quot; by Garland wearing a tuxedo jacket, black fedora, and black nylons (a style of dress that became something of a trademark of hers in later years after she wore the same outfit in &quot;Summer Stock&quot;), was cut from the film as too risqué for a film set in 1912. Audiences finally got to see it when an edited version was included in the 1994 compilation film &quot;That&#x27;s Entertainment! III&quot;. It was first seen as part of the extras on the VHS and Laser Disc special edition versions the next year. When the film was released to DVD, several minutes of outtakes, raw footage, and alternative takes of this performance were included in addition to the footage previously released.

As with &quot;White Christmas&quot; six years later, it is impossible to remix the musical numbers from this film into stereo or surround sound, because the original audio track recordings burned in a fire, leaving only a monaural composite track containing dialogue, music and effects, and an isolated music-only track intended for international release.

==Release==

=== Original theatrical run ===
&quot;Easter Parade&quot; premiered in New York City on July 8, 1948. It was a commercial success, earning over $6.8 million at the box office. Critics praised the performances, particularly Garland’s and Astaire’s, as well as the choreography and Berlin’s songs. The film won the Academy Award for Best Original Music Score and remains a hallmark of MGM’s musical productions during Hollywood’s Golden Age.

=== Television ===
&quot;Easter Parade&quot; first aired on American television in the mid-1950s, as part of MGM&#x27;s strategy to capitalize on its extensive film library through television broadcasts. Its family-friendly appeal and iconic musical numbers, such as &quot;A Couple of Swells&quot; and &quot;Easter Parade,&quot; made it a perennial favorite during holiday programming. The film has been regularly aired on networks like Turner Classic Movies, particularly during the Easter season, ensuring its continued popularity among audiences.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Easter Parade&quot; was initially released as home media on VHS in 1986 and re-issued on VHS in 1992 and 1993 by MGM/UA Home Video, followed by multiple DVD releases, including a special edition in 2005 that featured behind-the-scenes documentaries and interviews. In 2013, Warner Bros. released &quot;Easter Parade&quot; on Blu-ray, presenting a remastered version with improved video and audio quality. The Blu-ray release included additional features, such as audio commentary by film historians and surviving members of the production team. The film is also available for digital streaming on platforms such as Amazon Prime Video and Apple TV.

==Reception==
&quot;Easter Parade&quot; earned $4,144,000 in the U.S. and Canada and $1,659,000 overseas.

The film received mostly positive reviews. The film holds a 91% rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on twenty-three reviews.

Lady Hadwell, the widow of an aristocrat, is struggling to make ends meet by opening her home to the public. The youngest of her three daughters, Charlotte, known as Charlie, is a tomboy. Their loyal assistant, Joe, is in love with Charlie. When he learns he has won a fortune on the football pools, he conceals the fact from his employers.

<text>Washington Augustus Roebling (May 26, 1837 – July 21, 1926) was an American civil engineer who supervised the construction of the Brooklyn Bridge, designed by his father John A. Roebling. He served in the Union Army during the American Civil War as an officer at the Battle of Gettysburg.

==Education and military service==
The oldest son of Johanna (née Herting) and John A. Roebling, Washington was born in 1837 in Saxonburg, Pennsylvania, a town co-founded by his father and his uncle, Carl Roebling. His early schooling consisted of tutoring by Riedel and under Henne in Pittsburgh. He was sent to stay with Professor Lemuel Stephens of the Western University of Pennsylvania (now known as the University of Pittsburgh), where Roebling also attended some classes. Roebling eventually attended the Trenton Academy and acquired higher education in engineering at the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, from 1854 to 1857. He wrote a thesis titled &quot;Design for a Suspension Aqueduct.&quot;

Following his graduation as civil engineer (C.E.), Roebling joined his father to work as a bridge builder. From 1858 to 1860, he assisted his father on the Sixth Street Bridge project to replace an older bridge over the Allegheny River. During that period, he lived in a boarding house on Penn Street. Following completion of the bridge, Roebling returned to Trenton, where he worked in his father&#x27;s wire mill.

On April 16, 1861, soon after the start of the American Civil War, Roebling enlisted as a private in the New Jersey Militia. Seeking more than garrison duty, he resigned after two months and re-enlisted in a New York artillery battery: Company K, 83rd NY Volunteers. He performed staff duty engaged in the construction of suspension bridges to provide for the movement of troops. He rose steadily in rank and was soon commissioned as a 2nd Lieutenant.

Roebling saw action in numerous battles: Manassas Junction (Second Bull Run), Antietam, Chancellorsville, the Wilderness, Siege of Petersburg, and most notably, the Battle of Gettysburg. Soon after Chancellorsville, he was perhaps the first to note the movement of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Confederate Army toward the northwest while conducting air balloon reconnaissance.

On July 2, 1863, during Gettysburg, Roebling was one of the first Union officers on Little Round Top. Observing signs of approaching Confederate troops, he hurried down the hill to report to Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren, for whom Roebling was aide-de-camp. General Warren and Roebling descended further to find troops to secure this important tactical position. Roebling helped haul artillery up the hill, while Warren sent two of his aides, including Lt. Ranald S. Mackenzie, to search for infantry support. The two aides secured a brigade from the Union V Corps. Commanded by Col. Strong Vincent, the brigade immediately occupied the hill and defended the left flank of the Army of the Potomac against repeated Confederate attacks. As Vincent&#x27;s brigade began moving into position, Warren and Roebling had left the hill. Roebling sent the 140th New York Volunteers to the hill, not knowing that Vincent&#x27;s brigade was already engaging with advance Confederate troops. The 140th New York provided much needed reinforcements.

Roebling was brevetted lieutenant colonel in December 1864 for gallant service. He ended his service brevetted to colonel. After the war, he became a veteran companion of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States.

==Construction of the Brooklyn Bridge==
From mid-1865 to 1867, Roebling worked with his father on the Cincinnati-Covington Bridge (now the John A. Roebling Suspension Bridge). While traveling in Europe to research wire mills, bridges and caisson foundations, his only son, John A. Roebling II, was born. After returning to the U.S. in 1868, Washington became assistant engineer on the Brooklyn Bridge and was named chief engineer after his father&#x27;s death in mid-1869. He made several important improvements on the bridge design and further developed bridge building techniques. Thus, he designed the two large pneumatic caissons that became the foundations for the two towers.

In 1870, fire broke out in one of the caissons; from within the caisson, Roebling directed the efforts to extinguish the flames. Working in compressed air in these caissons under the river caused him to get decompression sickness (&quot;the bends&quot;) shattering his health and rendering him unable to visit the site, yet he continued to oversee the Brooklyn project to successful completion in 1883. Besides the bends, he may have had additional afflictions, possible neurasthenia, side effects of treatments, and secondary drug addiction. His wife, Emily Warren Roebling, who had taught herself bridge construction, took over much of the chief engineer&#x27;s duties including day-to-day supervision and project management. Although the couple jointly planned the bridge&#x27;s continued construction, Emily successfully lobbied for formal retention of Washington as chief engineer. McCullough remarked that &quot;nowhere in the history of great undertakings is there anything comparable&quot; to Roebling conducting the largest and most difficult engineering project ever &quot;in absentia.&quot;

Roebling would battle the after-effects from the caisson disease and its treatment the rest of his life.

==Later years==
Following the Brooklyn project, Roebling and his wife lived in Troy, New York, from 1884 to 1888, as their only child, John A. Roebling II, also attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). When their son graduated, the Roeblings returned to Trenton, moving to 191 West State Street in 1892. From 1902 to 1903 Roebling served as President of the Alumni Association at Rensselaer. His wife Emily died in 1903 from stomach cancer. Roebling remarried in 1908 to Cornelia Witsell Farrow of Charleston, South Carolina.

His namesake and nephew, Washington Augustus Roebling II, born March 25, 1881, only son of his brother Charles G. Roebling, went down with the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; in 1912.

Following the sudden death of another nephew, Karl Gustavus Roebling, in 1921, Roebling again became president of John A. Roebling&#x27;s Sons Company at age 84. He died in 1926, after being bedridden for two months, at age 89.
==Legacy==

Roebling&#x27;s most passionate hobby was collecting rocks and minerals. His collection of over 16,000 specimens was donated in 1926 by his son, John A. Roebling II, to the Smithsonian Institution and became an important part of its mineral and gem collection. One of the items in Roebling&#x27;s collection was the Canary Diamond, a nearly 18-carat yellow diamond found in 1917 in Arkansas at what is now Crater of Diamonds State Park.

Roebling endowed the Mineralogical Society of America with funds that support the award of the society&#x27;s Roebling Medal, its highest award. His gift of $40,000 in bonds became the Roebling Fund which has since grown in value to $1.5 million. Roebling Medal awardees include two Nobel Prize winners, Lawrence Bragg and Linus Pauling.

Many of his manuscripts, photographs, and publications can be found in the Roebling collections at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey, and at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. His family silver is on display in Ashford Castle, Cong, Co Mayo, Ireland.

Roebling was voiced by descendant Paul Roebling in the 1990 Ken Burns PBS film &quot;The Civil War&quot;.

Kinkora Works, the site of the Roebling Company factory complex in Roebling, New Jersey, was opened as a museum in 2010. The museum tells the story of the Roebling family and the John A. Roebling’s Sons Company.

<text>SS &quot;Shieldhall&quot; is a preserved steamship that operates from Southampton. She is the largest operational historic steamship in Europe and one of the last reciprocating steam engined ships built, using technology that dated back to the last quarter of the 19th century and which was obsolete at the time of her construction. She spent her working life as one of the &quot;Clyde sludge boats&quot;, making regular trips from Shieldhall in Glasgow, Scotland, down the River Clyde and Firth of Clyde past the Isle of Arran, to dump treated sewage sludge at sea. These steamships had a tradition, dating back to the First World War, of taking organised parties of passengers on their trips during the summer. SS &quot;Shieldhall&quot; has been preserved and offers cruises to the paying public.

==History==
The 1,972-ton &quot;Shieldhall&quot; was laid down in October 1954, built by Lobnitz &amp; Co. of Renfrew who also constructed the two triple expansion steam engines which are set vertically in a similar way to the much larger engines on the RMS &quot;Titanic&quot;. By the 1950s Lobnitz usually built its engines with enclosed crankcases but the Shieldhall was deliberately fitted with traditional open-crank engines. Glasgow Corporation had long allowed day-trippers access to the engine room of its ships while at sea and the older-style engines allowed passengers to see the workings of the engines in operation.

She was built on the classic lines of a 1920s steam tanker with a traditional midships wheelhouse. The hull was of riveted and welded construction with a slightly raked stem and a cruiser stern. Her length is and breadth . Accommodation was provided for 80 passengers. She entered service in October 1955 and was operated by Glasgow Corporation to transport treated sewage sludge down the Clyde to be dumped at sea. She and her sister ships were jocularly known as Clyde banana boats as the livery resembled that of a well known banana shipping company.

In 1976 after 21 years of service on the Clyde, &quot;Shieldhall&quot; was laid up, and in the following year was bought by the Southern Water Authority. Once at Southampton, Shieldhall would take sludge from the areas of Marchwood, Totton and Woolston, then dump the sludge in an area south of the Nab Tower. 

Due to rising fuel prices she was withdrawn from service on 5 July 1985. Memos from Southern Water show that while the company was trialling a new ship to take over the Shieldhall&#x27;s duties, Shieldhall was to be laid up. Once the new ships were proved to be viable for Southern Water, Shieldhall was to be broken up for scrap.

As early as 25 July 1985, discussions opened between Southern Water, The City Council, Associated British Ports and Southampton University Industrial Archeological Society to preserve the Steamship Shieldhall.

==Preservation==

From 1985 until 1988, while the preservation society raised the money to buy the ship, &quot;Shieldhall&quot; remained in the custody of Southern Water. Then on 28 July 1988, &quot;Shieldhall&quot; was handed over to the preservation society, now named The &quot;Solent Steam Packet Limited&quot;, which operates as a charity. 

&quot;Shieldhall&quot; originally was berthed in Ocean Village, plans were underway at the time for there to be a maritime heritage centre, in which she would be an active working museum. However, the plans for the heritage centre never came to fruition. &quot;Shieldhall&quot; now docks at Berth 110 in Southamptons Western Docks.

&quot;Shieldhall&quot;&#x27;s first voyage in her now preserved state was conducted on 9 June 1991.

All work associated with the Society and &quot;Shieldhall&quot; was and still is carried out by unpaid volunteers. The remaining Glasgow sludge boats kept going into the 1990s, when changing environmental standards led to new ways of treating the sludge.

She has been restored to sea-going condition, and is listed in the Core Collection of the National Historic Fleet. &quot;Shieldhall&quot; is now a frequent sight around the Solent running excursions, crewed by volunteers. She has been to the Netherlands for the Dordrecht Steam Festival and has been at &quot;International Festivals of the Sea&quot; at Bristol and Portsmouth. Passengers are encouraged to visit the bridge and see the engine room, getting an understanding of the days of steam.

In July 2005, &quot;Shieldhall&quot; made a return visit to the Clyde, taking part in the &quot;River Festival&quot; in Glasgow, and berthing at Custom House Quay, Greenock. She made a number of excursions, taking passengers on cruises from Greenock on her old route down the Clyde to Arran.
In 2012, to mark the centenary of the sinking of &quot;Titanic&quot; and to honour all lives lost at sea over the previous century, &quot;Shieldhall&quot; was repainted in White Star Line livery of black hull, white upper works, and buff funnel. Since 2012, the ship has continued this look.

A £1.4 million grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) was announced, in April 2013, for essential hull works to meet modern regulations, improved passenger facilities and interpretation. Further grants were made in 2019 and 2020.

In September 2023, &quot;Shieldhall&quot; met with the paddle steamer off Bournemouth as &quot;Shieldhall&quot; made her way from Poole to Southampton, giving the rare sight of two ClydeBuilt ships sailing together on the South Coast. Also in 2023, &quot;Shieldhall&quot; was the official Committee vessel for the 2023 Ocean Globe race. As the &#x27;guest starting vessel&#x27;, her whistle, alongside a cannon at Cowes, sounded to signal the start of the race. &quot;Shieldhall&quot; sailed with sailing experts, enthusiasts, photographers and some of the competitors&#x27; families onboard, alongside the racers down towards The Needles, before returning to Southampton.

==In popular culture==
Shieldhall has made many television appearances, including in &quot;Casualty&quot;, &quot;Lovejoy&quot;, &quot;Fred Dibnah&#x27;s Age of Steam&quot;, and &quot;Coltrane&#x27;s Planes and Automobiles&quot;. She represented the &quot;Titanic&quot; in &quot;Myths of the Titanic&quot; and played a Spanish ship, &quot;Begona&quot;, in Floella Benjamin&#x27;s &quot;Coming to England&quot;. In 1999, the ship was used in Rede Globo&#x27;s Brazilian telenovela &quot;Terra Nostra&quot;, playing a fictional Italian ship &quot;Andrea I&quot;.

Film appearances include &quot;Angela&#x27;s Ashes&quot; and &quot;Bright Young Things&quot;.

<doc id="918131" wikidata="Q7314225" url="?curid=918131" title="Representation theory of diffeomorphism groups">
<text>In mathematics, a source for the representation theory of the group of diffeomorphisms of a smooth manifold &quot;M&quot; is the initial observation that (for &quot;M&quot; connected) that group acts transitively on &quot;M&quot;.

==History==

A survey paper from 1975 of the subject by Anatoly Vershik, Israel Gelfand and M. I. Graev attributes the original interest in the topic to research in theoretical physics of the local current algebra, in the preceding years. Research on the &quot;finite configuration&quot; representations was in papers of R. S. Ismagilov (1971), and A. A. Kirillov (1974). The representations of interest in physics are described as a cross product &quot;C&quot;∞(&quot;M&quot;)·Diff(&quot;M&quot;).

==Constructions==

Let therefore &quot;M&quot; be a &quot;n&quot;-dimensional connected differentiable manifold, and &quot;x&quot; be any point on it. Let Diff(&quot;M&quot;) be the orientation-preserving diffeomorphism group of &quot;M&quot; (only the identity component of mappings homotopic to the identity diffeomorphism if you wish) and Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;) the stabilizer of &quot;x&quot;. Then, &quot;M&quot; is identified as a homogeneous space

:Diff(&quot;M&quot;)/Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;).

From the algebraic point of view instead, formula_1 is the algebra of smooth functions over &quot;M&quot; and formula_2 is the ideal of smooth functions vanishing at &quot;x&quot;. Let formula_3 be the ideal of smooth functions which vanish up to the n-1th partial derivative at &quot;x&quot;. formula_3 is invariant under the group Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;) of diffeomorphisms fixing x. For &quot;n&quot; &gt; 0 the group Diff&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) is defined as the subgroup of Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;) which acts as the identity on formula_5. So, we have a descending chain

:Diff(&quot;M&quot;) ⊃ Diff&quot;x&quot;1(M) ⊃ ... ⊃ Diff&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) ⊃ ...

Here Diff&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) is a normal subgroup of Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;), which means we can look at the quotient group

:Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;)/Diff&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;M&quot;).

Using harmonic analysis, a real- or complex-valued function (with some sufficiently nice topological properties) on the diffeomorphism group can be decomposed into Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;) representation-valued functions over &quot;M&quot;.

==The supply of representations==

So what are the representations of Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;)? Let&#x27;s use the fact that if we have a group homomorphism φ:&quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot;, then if we have a &quot;H&quot;-representation, we can obtain a restricted &quot;G&quot;-representation. So, if we have a rep of

:Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;)/Diff&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;M&quot;),

we can obtain a rep of Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;).

Let&#x27;s look at

:Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;)/Diff&quot;x&quot;2(&quot;M&quot;)

first. This is isomorphic to the general linear group GL+(&quot;n&quot;, R) (and because we&#x27;re only considering orientation preserving diffeomorphisms and so the determinant is positive). What are the reps of GL+(&quot;n&quot;, R)?

:formula_6.

We know the reps of SL(&quot;n&quot;, R) are simply tensors over &quot;n&quot; dimensions. How about the R+ part? That corresponds to the &quot;density&quot;, or in other words, how the tensor rescales under the determinant of the Jacobian of the diffeomorphism at &quot;x&quot;. (Think of it as the conformal weight if you will, except that there is no conformal structure here). (Incidentally, there is nothing preventing us from having a complex density).

So, we have just discovered the tensor reps (with density) of the diffeomorphism group.

Let&#x27;s look at

:Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;)/Diff&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;M&quot;).

This is a finite-dimensional group. We have the chain

:Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;)/Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;) ⊂ ... ⊂ Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;)/Diff&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;M&quot;) ⊂ ...

Here, the &quot;⊂&quot; signs should really be read to mean an injective homomorphism, but since it is canonical, we can pretend these quotient groups are embedded one within the other.

Any rep of

:Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;)/Diff&quot;x&quot;&quot;m&quot;(&quot;M&quot;)

can automatically be turned into a rep of

:Diff&quot;x&quot;1/Diff&quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;(&quot;M&quot;)

if &quot;n&quot; &gt; &quot;m&quot;. Let&#x27;s say we have a rep of

:Diff&quot;x&quot;1/Diff&quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot; + 2

which doesn&#x27;t arise from a rep of

:Diff&quot;x&quot;1/Diff&quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot; + 1.

Then, we call the fiber bundle with that rep as the fiber (i.e. Diff&quot;x&quot;1/Diff&quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot; + 2 is the structure group) a jet bundle of order &quot;p&quot;.

Side remark: This is really the method of induced representations with the smaller group being Diffx1(M) and the larger group being Diff(&quot;M&quot;).

==Intertwining structure==

In general, the space of sections of the tensor and jet bundles would be an irreducible representation and we often look at a subrepresentation of them. We can study the structure of these reps through the study of the intertwiners between them.

If the fiber is not an irreducible representation of Diff&quot;x&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;), then we can have a nonzero intertwiner mapping each fiber pointwise into a smaller quotient representation. Also, the exterior derivative is an intertwiner from the space of differential forms to another of higher order. (Other derivatives are not, because connections aren&#x27;t invariant under diffeomorphisms, though they are covariant.) The partial derivative isn&#x27;t diffeomorphism invariant. There is a derivative intertwiner taking sections of a jet bundle of order &quot;p&quot; into sections of a jet bundle of order &quot;p&quot; + 1.

<text>Gerald Michael Gabbard (born January 15, 1948) is an American politician, serving as the Hawaii State Senator for District 21 from the Democratic party, since 2006. Gabbard rose to prominence for efforts to prevent same-sex marriage in Hawaii by passing a 1998 amendment to the Constitution of Hawaii to give the state legislature &quot;the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples&quot; under the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). Gabbard, who was born in American Samoa, is the first person of Samoan descent to serve in the Hawaii Senate.

His daughter, Tulsi Gabbard, served as a Democratic member of the U.S. House of Representatives for Hawaii&#x27;s second congressional district from 2013 to 2021 and was a candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2020. She later switched parties and became the Director of National Intelligence during President Donald Trump’s second term in 2025.

==Early life and education==
Gabbard was born on January 15, 1948, in Fagatogo, American Samoa, one of eight children of Aknesis Agnes (Yandall) and Benjamin Harrison Gabbard, Jr, a Samoan of American ancestry. Mike Gabbard is of Samoan and European descent from both his maternal and paternal ancestry. He was a U.S. citizen from birth because of his father&#x27;s U.S. citizenship. Gabbard lived in Hawaii as a child and graduated from Choctawhatchee High School in Fort Walton Beach, Florida. He studied at and obtained a degree in English from Sonoma State College in 1971. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in community college administration from Oregon State University.

==Early career==
In the 1970s and early 1980s, Gabbard taught high school English in American Samoa and was a guidance counselor and later Assistant Dean of Instruction, and Dean of Adult and Community Education at American Samoa Community College. He also worked as a head tennis pro at the Kuilima Hyatt Resort on the North Shore of O&#x27;ahu in the mid 1970s.

From 1983 to 1987, Gabbard and his wife Carol established the Ponomauloa School in Wahiawa, Hawaii, where he worked as headmaster and teacher; it closed after five years.

From 1988 to 1992, Gabbard and his wife owned The Natural Deli, a vegetarian restaurant within Moiliili, Hawaii&#x27;s Down to Earth Natural Food Store. Gabbard closed the restaurant following picketing by activists after Gabbard said on his self-funded radio show, &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk Straight Hawaii&quot;, on K-108, that &quot;If [two applicants] were both the same, then I would take the one that is not homosexual.&quot;

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Gabbard and his wife worked for state Senator Rick Reed.

In the early 1990s, Gabbard and his wife were listed as teachers for the Science of Identity Foundation.

Gabbard and his wife later started Hawaiian Toffee Treasures, a candy company in Honolulu.

==Political career==
Gabbard was elected to the Honolulu City Council in a nonpartisan race in 2002.

In 2004, he ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for the Second Congressional District of Hawaii in the United States House of Representatives, losing to state Representative Ed Case.

On March 21, 2006, Gabbard announced his plans to run for the Hawaii State Senate in West Oahu&#x27;s District 19, after 14-year incumbent Senator Brian Kanno decided not to run for reelection. On November 7, 2006, Gabbard defeated retired Honolulu police captain George Yamamoto by a 56% to 44% margin, to represent the district in the Hawaii State Senate. Gabbard was sworn in on January 17, 2007. Gabbard, who was born in American Samoa, became the first person of Samoan descent to serve in the Hawaii Senate.

On August 30, 2007, Gabbard switched from the Republican Party of Hawaii to the Democratic Party of Hawaii. His stated reason for doing so was that he believed that he could be more effective to his constituents as part of the majority party in the State Senate, where Democrats have long had a supermajority.

On November 2, 2010, Gabbard was re-elected for a second term to the Hawaii State Senate, after defeating Republican Aaron Bonar by a 74% to 26% margin. Gabbard served as the Chair of the Energy and Environment Committee from 2009 to 2015, which culminated with his leadership on the passage of a first-in-the-nation law to require Hawaii utilities to get 100% of their electricity from clean, renewable energy sources by 2045.

On November 6, 2012, Gabbard defeated Republican candidate Dean Capelouto, 72% to 28%, to represent the newly reapportioned Hawaii State Senate District 20.

During the 2016 election cycle, Gabbard was unopposed, and was re-elected to the Hawaii State Senate for a four-year term on November 8, 2016.

==Activism==

Gabbard became an anti-homosexual activist before the same-sex marriage debate took hold in Hawaii. Between 1991 and 1996, Gabbard founded the organizations Stop Promoting Homosexuality Hawaii (renamed Stop Promoting Homosexuality International), Stop Promoting Homosexuality America, and the Alliance for Traditional Marriage and Values. Gabbard became well-known for his advocacy for Hawaii Constitutional Amendment 2 (1998). This amendment, approved by voters 69.2%–28.6%, gave the state legislature &quot;the power to reserve marriage to opposite-sex couples&quot; under the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), signed by Bill Clinton in 1996.

Shortly after 9/11, Gabbard founded Stand Up For America (SUFA), a non-profit educational organization.

In 2007, Gabbard co-founded the non-profit Aloha Parenting Project (APP) with his wife Carol.

==Political positions==

===Same-sex marriage===
Gabbard used to oppose same-sex marriage and civil unions. He used to believe that marriage should only be between a man and a woman. However, in March 2024 he voted to put Amendment 1 on the ballot and expressed support for same-sex marriage. Gabbard apologized for his previous opposition to same-sex marriage and stated that conversations with his daughter Tulsi led to him evolving on this issue.

===Environment===
In 2016, while serving as the Chair of the Water, Land, and Agriculture Committee, Gabbard authored a bill banning the sale of parts and products of endangered species.

In 2018, Gabbard authored legislation that enacted a statewide ban on sunscreens that contained the controversial chemicals oxybenzone and octinoxate. The bill also included a ban on the pesticide chlorpyrifos, and upon enactment, Hawaii became the first state to ban the substance.

In 2021, Gabbard reintroduced the Hawaii Cruelty Free Cosmetics Act, which passed the Hawaii State Legislature and would make Hawaii the sixth state to ban cosmetic animal testing, after having previously introduced the bill in 2018. He received Cruelty Free International&#x27;s May 2021 award for Legislator of the Month. He also introduced and passed SCR44, a resolution which made Hawaii the first state to declare a &quot;climate emergency&quot;.

He is currently the Chair of the Agriculture and Environment Committee.

==Personal life==
Mike Gabbard married to Carol Porter in 1968. One of Mike&#x27;s daughters, Tulsi, became a politician. Mike&#x27;s sister, Caroline Sinavaiana-Gabbard, was a professor who died in a stabbing in May 2024.

A socially conservative Catholic, Gabbard serves as a lector at St. Jude Catholic Church in Makakilo, Hawaii. In the 1970s, Gabbard and his wife became devotees of Chris Butler, who founded the Science of Identity Foundation. Gabbard became vegetarian and gave his children Hindu names.

<doc id="918141" wikidata="Q3716434" url="?curid=918141" title="Enteric duplication cyst">
<text>Enteric duplication cysts, sometimes simply called duplication cysts, are rare congenital malformations of the gastrointestinal tract. They most frequently occur in the small intestine, particularly the ileum, but can occur anywhere along the gastrointestinal tract. They may be cystic or tubular in conformation.

The condition of having duplication cysts has been called intestinal duplication.

==Symptoms and signs==

Symptoms depend on the location of the duplication. Duplications occurring high in the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. esophageal) may cause difficulty breathing due to compression of the airway. Lower gastrointestinal duplications (e.g. duodenum, colon) can be associated with abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, a palpable mass, vomiting, or may cause bowel obstruction. Smaller lesions can act as a so-called &quot;lead point&quot; for intussusception.

==Diagnosis==
==Treatment==

Duplications are usually removed surgically, even if they are found incidentally (i.e. not causing symptoms or encountered on routine studies for other reasons), as there is a high incidence of complications resulting from untreated cases. Cysts are often technically easier to remove than tubular malformations since tubular structures usually share a blood supply with the associated gut.

<doc id="918146" wikidata="Q3777975" url="?curid=918146" title="Belfield, Dublin">
<text>Belfield () is a small enclave, not quite a suburb, in Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown, Ireland. It is synonymous with the main campus of University College Dublin.

Belfield is close to Donnybrook, Ballsbridge, Clonskeagh, Goatstown, Stillorgan, Booterstown, Merrion and Mount Merrion and takes its name from Belfield House and Demesne, one of eight properties bought to form the main campus of University College Dublin. It is adjacent to the R138 road.

==History==
Belfield was one of the original sites suggested as a possible location for Dublin Airport before Collinstown was chosen. Nowadays, Belfield is synonymous with University College Dublin, being the location of that institution&#x27;s main 132-hectare campus. University College Dublin (UCD) dates back to its foundation at 86 St. Stephen&#x27;s Green in 1851 as the Catholic University of Ireland founded by John Henry Newman who was its first rector.

In 1934, UCD bought Belfield House and from 1949 to 1958 purchased a group of adjoining properties to form a potential campus estate.

In 1960, the Government recommended that the college move from the city centre to Belfield. The first buildings to be completed on the new campus were those of the Faculty of Science in 1964. The other faculties moved to Belfield on a phased basis as their new buildings were completed, although as of 2007, parts of a few remain in Dublin city centre. Additionally, the Michael Smurfit Graduate School of Business is based on the remainder of the Carysfort (former School of Education) campus in Blackrock.

From the 1970s until his death in 2021, a homeless man, known affectionately as &#x27;Old Man Belfield&#x27;, lived rough on the campus of UCD and became well known in the area, despite rarely speaking to anyone.

==Amenities==
The site also includes Belfield office park, with a large, international Hewlett-Packard call centre, and a sports ground, The Belfield Bowl, at which the UCD soccer and rugby teams both play in the top divisions of their respective leagues. The area is served by the college&#x27;s numerous media outlets including newspapers, the College Tribune and the University Observer, radio station Belfield FM and television station the College Television Network.

==Business==
There are several &#x27;office parks&#x27; located in and adjacent to Belfield, including Belfield Office Park, Clonskeagh Drive and Beech Hill Office Park, the latter with a gym adjacent. Some of the companies located here include Hewlett-Packard (until 2008 most call centre activities were based in HP&#x27;s Belfield Office Park), Ericsson, Smurfit Kappa (head office), and the Department of Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform.

<doc id="918149" wikidata="Q334980" url="?curid=918149" title="Arthur Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder">
<text>Marshal of the Royal Air Force Arthur William Tedder, 1st Baron Tedder, (11 July 1890 – 3 June 1967) was a British Royal Air Force officer and peer. He was a pilot and squadron commander in the Royal Flying Corps in the First World War and he went on to serve as a senior officer in the Royal Air Force (RAF) during the inter-war years when he served in Turkey, Great Britain and the Far East.

During World War II, as Air Officer Commanding of the RAF Middle East Command, Tedder directed RAF air operations in the Mediterranean and North Africa, including the evacuation of Crete and &quot;Operation Crusader&quot; in North Africa. His bombing tactics became known as the &quot;Tedder Carpet&quot;. Later in the war Tedder took command of the Mediterranean Air Command and in that role was closely involved in the planning of the Allied invasion of Sicily and the Allied invasion of Italy. When Operation Overlord—the invasion of France—came to be planned, Tedder was appointed Deputy Supreme Commander at Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force under General Dwight D. Eisenhower.

After the war, Tedder served as Chief of the Air Staff, in which role he advocated increased recruitment in the face of many airmen leaving the RAF, doubled the size of RAF Fighter Command and implemented arrangements for the Berlin Airlift in 1948. He also held senior positions in business and academia.

==Early life==
Tedder was born the son of Sir Arthur John Tedder and Emily Charlotte Tedder (née Bryson) at the Glenguin Distillery (now Glengoyne) in the Campsie Fells, north of Glasgow. His father was distinguished as the Commissioner of the Board of Customs who devised the old age pension scheme. His father&#x27;s occupation meant that the young Tedder saw different parts of the British Isles, spending 1895 to 1898 in Lerwick in the Shetland Isles and 1899–1901 in Elgin, in the County of Moray. In 1902 the family moved to Croydon in Surrey where Tedder attended Whitgift School until 1909, when he went up to the University of Cambridge. Tedder spent his university years (1909–13) at Magdalene College, where he read history. He was awarded a lower second class honours degree in June 1912.

Tedder spent the summer of 1912 in Berlin studying German. With the start of a new academic year, he decided to return to Magdalene for a fourth year in order that he might prepare himself for a career as a diplomat. On 2 September 1913, during his last year at Magdalene, Tedder gained a reserve commission as a second lieutenant in the Dorsetshire Regiment.

After university, Tedder joined the Colonial Service as a cadet and departed Britain in February 1914, serving in the administration in Fiji. He did not find colonial life in Fiji to his liking, and when war was declared, he returned to Britain so that he could join the regular Army.

==Military career==
===First World War===
Tedder was promoted to lieutenant in the Dorset Regiment on 14 October 1914, and arrived back in Britain in December. He was posted to a reserve unit at Wyke Regis on the Dorset coast where he seriously injured his knee in February. Following his injury Tedder was unable to carry out full infantry service and, although he briefly carried out duties at a base camp in Calais, he pressed for a transfer to the Royal Flying Corps (RFC).

In January 1916, Tedder was accepted into the RFC and he was asked to attend the No. 1 School of Aeronautics in Reading. He was promoted to captain on 21 March 1916. In April he attended the Central Flying School where he learned to fly and gained his &#x27;wings&#x27;. In June 1916, Tedder served as a pilot with No. 25 Squadron RFC flying the Bristol Scout C on the Western Front. On 9 August 1916, Tedder was given additional responsibilities as he was made a flight commander with 25 Squadron. The first day of 1917 saw Tedder promoted to major and appointed officer commanding No. 70 Squadron RFC. Tedder remained on the Western Front and his new squadron was equipped with the Sopwith 1½ Strutter. He was awarded the Italian Silver Medal for Military Valour on 26 May 1917.

Tedder was appointed officer commanding No. 67 Squadron at RFC Shawbury on 25 June 1917 and became commander of the School of Navigation and Bomb Dropping in Egypt the following year. Another change soon followed and on 24 June 1918 Tedder was appointed officer commanding 38th Wing, also based in Egypt. He was promoted to the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel on 23 July 1918 (rank relinquished on 2 April 1919).

===Inter-war years===
Tedder was given command of No. 274 Squadron, equipped with the Handley Page V/1500, the largest RAF bomber of its time, at RAF Bircham Newton in May 1919. On 1 August 1919, Tedder accepted a permanent commission in the new Royal Air Force (RAF). Renamed No. 207 Squadron in February 1920 and equipped with DH9a bombers, the squadron was briefly deployed to Turkey in 1922–23 during the Chanak Crisis. Tedder attended the RN Staff College in late 1923 and through the spring of 1924.

Promoted to wing commander on 1 January 1924, Tedder became station commander at RAF Digby and the Commandant of No. 2 Flying Training School there in September 1924, before joining the air staff in the Directorate of Training at the Air Ministry in January 1927. He attended the Imperial Defence College in 1928 and then became Assistant Commandant at the RAF Staff College in January 1929. Promoted to group captain on 1 January 1931, he went to the Air Armament School at RAF Eastchurch as officer commanding in January 1932. On 4 April 1934 he became Director of Training at the Air Ministry, gaining promotion to air commodore on 1 July 1934.

In November 1936, Tedder was appointed Air Officer Commanding (AOC) RAF Far Eastern Forces which gave him command over RAF units from Burma to Hong Kong and Borneo. Appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 1 February 1937, he was promoted to air vice marshal on 1 July 1937 and became Director General for Research in the Air Ministry in July 1938.

===Second World War===

At the outbreak of war in 1939, Tedder&#x27;s department was transferred to the newly created Ministry of Aircraft Production, but Tedder was unable to form a good working relationship with the minister, Lord Beaverbrook and consequently with Prime Minister Churchill and on 29 November 1940, he became Deputy Air Officer Commanding in Chief, RAF Middle East Command with the acting rank of air marshal. Shortly thereafter, Tedder was ordered by Churchill to resurrect the Takoradi air route.

Tedder was appointed as Air Officer Commanding in Chief, RAF Middle East Command on 1 June 1941, with the temporary rank of air marshal (made permanent in April 1942). He had not been Churchill&#x27;s first choice for the role but when the preferred choice (Air Vice-Marshal O T Boyd) was captured, Tedder was appointed. As head of the RAF Middle East Command, he commanded air operations in the Mediterranean and North Africa, including the evacuation of Crete in May 1941 and &quot;Operation Crusader&quot; in North Africa in late 1941. Tedder was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1942 New Year Honours, mentioned in despatches for his services in the Middle East on 30 June 1942 and promoted to the temporary rank of air chief marshal on 3 July 1942.

Tedder oversaw the buildup of the air arm in the Western Desert and, more importantly, the development of new more effective operational and administrative policies which turned it into a highly effective force which was key to the Allied victory at the decisive Battle of El Alamein in October 1942. One of his bombing tactics became known as the &quot;Tedder Carpet&quot;. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 27 November 1942 in recognition of his services in the Middle East.

In February 1943 Tedder took command of Mediterranean Air Command, serving under U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower (the theatre commander), and in that role was closely involved in the planning of the Allied invasion of Sicily and then the Allied invasion of Italy. He was awarded the American Legion of Merit on 27 August 1943 and awarded the Grand Cross of the Polish Order of Polonia Restituta on 1 October 1943. He went on to be Commander of Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, which took in an expanded group of air forces, in December 1943.

When Operation Overlord—the invasion of France—came to be planned, Tedder was appointed Deputy Supreme Commander at SHAEF beneath General Eisenhower, taking up the role in January 1944. However he developed an towards the British General Bernard Montgomery and during the difficult Battle of Normandy and later, he was a critic of Montgomery&#x27;s performance and advocated Montgomery&#x27;s removal from command. In the last year of the war, Tedder was sent to the Soviet Union to seek assistance as the Western Front came under pressure during the Battle of the Bulge. When the unconditional surrender of the Germans came in May 1945 Tedder signed on behalf of General Eisenhower. He was promoted to the substantive rank of Air Chief Marshal on 6 June 1945. Tedder was awarded the Soviet Order of Kutuzov (1st Class) on 28 August 1945 and promoted to Marshal of the Royal Air Force on 12 September 1945.
===After the war===
Tedder took over from Charles Portal as Chief of the Air Staff on 1 January 1946. In that role he advocated increased recruiting in the face of many airmen leaving the service, doubled the size of Fighter Command and implemented arrangements for the Berlin Airlift in 1948. He was granted a peerage as Baron Tedder, of Glenguin in the County of Stirling on 8 February 1946 and received the American Distinguished Service Medal on 14 June 1946. In 1947 he delivered the Lees Knowles Lecture, which was then published as &quot;Air Power in War&quot;. He moved on to become chairman, British Joint Services Mission in Washington in January 1950 before retiring in May 1951. In 1951 Tedder accepted an invitation to chair the Royal Commission on University Education in Dundee which ultimately led to the creation of the Queen&#x27;s College, Dundee as a college of the University of St Andrews. His son John would later be a professor at both the University of Dundee (as Queen&#x27;s College eventually became) and at St Andrews.

==Later life==
Tedder was the author of a highly regarded essay on the history of the Royal Navy and also composed his war memoirs. In November 1950 he was elected Chancellor of the University of Cambridge. He also served as Chairman of the Standard Motor Company from 1954 to 1960 and vice-chairman of the Board of Governors of the BBC. In his later years he developed Parkinson&#x27;s disease and died at his home at Banstead in Surrey on 3 June 1967.

His ashes are buried in St Clement Danes in London, the RAF church. His name can be seen on a memorial in Westminster Abbey.

==Family life==
In 1915 Tedder married Rosalinde Maclardy; they had two sons and a daughter. Following the death of his first wife in an aircraft crash in Egypt in January 1943, Tedder married Marie (Toppy) Black (née Seton) in October 1943. Tedder was the father of: Dick (killed in France 1940), John Michael (1926–1994; Late Purdie Professor of Chemistry, University of St. Andrews), Richard (Professor of Virology at UCL) and Mena.

<doc id="918152" wikidata="Q2512624" url="?curid=918152" title="Bank holding company">
<text>A bank holding company is a company that controls one or more banks, but does not necessarily engage in banking itself. The compound bancorp (&quot;banc&quot;/&quot;bank&quot; + &quot;corp[oration]&quot;) or bancorporation is often used to refer to such companies as well, particularly in the United States.

== United States ==

In the United States, a bank holding company, as provided by the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 ( &quot;&quot;), is broadly defined as &quot;any company that has control over a bank&quot;. All bank holding companies in the US are required to register with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

===Regulation===
The Federal Reserve Board of Governors, under Regulation Y () has responsibility for regulating and supervising bank holding company activities, such as establishing capital standards, approving mergers and acquisitions and inspecting the operations of such companies. This authority applies even though a bank owned by a holding company may be under the primary supervision of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency or the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

===Bank holding company status===
Becoming a bank holding company makes it easier for the firm to raise capital than as a traditional bank. The holding company can assume debt of shareholders on a tax free basis, borrow money, acquire other banks and non-bank entities more easily, and issue stock with greater regulatory ease. It also has a greater legal authority to conduct share repurchases of its own stock.

The downside includes responding to additional regulatory authorities, especially if there are more than 2,000 shareholders (note: prior to the Jobs Act or Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, the shareholder number was 300), at which point the bank holding company is forced to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission. There are also added expenses of operating with an extra layer of administration.

===2007–2008 financial crisis===
As a result of the 2007–2008 financial crisis, many traditional investment banks and finance corporations such as Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, American Express, CIT Group and GMAC (now Ally Financial) converted to bank holding companies to gain access to the Federal Reserve&#x27;s credit facilities.

== United Kingdom ==
In the United Kingdom, the Bank of England refers to bank holding companies as “parent financial holding companies” or “parent mixed financial holding companies.”

<doc id="918153" wikidata="Q5765015" url="?curid=918153" title="Himalayan Mountaineering Institute">
<text>The Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI Darjeeling) was established in Darjeeling, India on 4 November 1954 to encourage mountaineering as an organized sport in India. 

==History==
The first ascent of Mount Everest in 1953 by Tenzing Norgay and Edmund Hillary sparked a keen interest in establishing mountaineering as a well-respected endeavor for people in the region. With the impetus provided by the first prime minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, HMI was established in Darjeeling. Narendra Dhar Jayal, the pioneer of Indian Mountaineering, was the founding principal of the institute. Tenzing Norgay was the first director of field training for HMI. The buildings for the Institute were designed by the architect Joseph Allen Stein, who then taught at the Bengal Engineering College near Calcutta. It was the first building in a career in India that lasted half a century.

HMI regularly conducts &quot;Adventure&quot;, &quot;Basic&quot;, and &quot;Advanced Mountaineering&quot; courses. These are very comprehensive courses. They are also highly subsidised to encourage mountaineering as a sport.

Tenzing Norgay became the first Director of Field Training of the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute in Darjeeling, when it was set up in 1954.

<doc id="918156" wikidata="Q3154745" url="?curid=918156" title="Isaac Holden">
<text>Sir Isaac Holden, 1st Baronet (7 May 1807 – 13 August 1897) was an inventor and manufacturer, who is known both for his work in developing the Square Motion wool-combing machine and as a Radical Liberal Member of Parliament.

==Life==
Holden was born in the village of Hurlet near Glasgow. He was largely self-educated: his formal education was often disrupted. He was apprenticed from the age of ten for a short period as a draw boy for two hand weavers, but attended the grammar school run by the &#x27;Old Radical&#x27; John Fraser. He became a pupil-teacher and then sought to become a Wesleyan Minister, before teaching at schools in Slaithwaite and Leeds.

In 1829 Holden obtained a post at the Castle Academy in Reading, Berkshire. It was here that he developed a version of the Lucifer match, but his invention was superseded by John Walker of Stockton-on-Tees in 1827, who did not patent the invention. The following year Holden returned to Scotland to set up a night school in Glasgow, but after a brief period of teaching he moved in 1830 to become a bookkeeper at Townsends&#x27; worsted factory in Cullingworth near Bingley. Transferring to the technical side and becoming a manager, he spent his time at seeking to improve the process of combing wool.

Holden left Townsends in 1846 to set up a factory making Paisley shawl middles at Pit Lane in Bradford. When the business failed two years later he formed a partnership with Samuel Lister. They worked together to develop the square motion wool-combing machine, which was patented by Lister in 1848, although Holden had drafted the patent. The origins of the machine became the subject of a lifelong dispute between the two men.
In 1848, trading as Lister &amp; Holden, Isaac Holden set up a factory in the St Denis district of Paris, where over the next few years he perfected the square motion machine. He then set up factories in France, at Croix near Lille and at Reims, run by his nephews Isaac Holden Crothers and Jonathon Holden. In 1857 he bought out Lister and the firm was renamed Isaac Holden et Fils. In 1860 he and his sons, Angus and Edward, set up an experimental factory at Penny Oaks in Bradford and then in 1864 they opened the massive Alston Works at Bradford.

By the 1870s Holden&#x27;s factories in England and France had become the largest wool combers in the world. He celebrated his success by building a large Italianate mansion at Oakworth near Keighley in Yorkshire. As a leading Wesleyan, Holden&#x27;s philanthropy was largely concentrated on building Wesleyan chapels. He pledged £5000 to build 50 chapels in London.

In 1865 Holden was elected to serve as a Liberal Member of Parliament for Knaresborough from 1865 to 1868, and later for the Northern West Riding of Yorkshire from 1882 to 1885 and for Keighley from 1885 to 1895. In his political life he campaigned for electoral reform, church disestablishment and Irish Home Rule. In 1893, at the age of 86, he was created a Baronet, of Oakworth House in the County of York.

Holden died in August 1897, aged 90, and was buried in Undercliffe Cemetery, Bradford.
He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his eldest son Angus Holden.
His daughter Margaret had married Alfred Illingworth who succeeded him as MP for Knaresborough.
In 1908 his son was raised to the peerage as Baron Holden.

Oakworth House burned down in 1907 and in 1927 its grounds were given by the family to the people of Oakworth as a public park. It is called Holden Park.

==Family==

Holden was twice married: firstly in 1832 to Marion Love (1811-1847) with whom he had four children; secondly in 1850 to Sarah Sugden (1804–1890) by whom he had no further children.

<text>Direct applicability refers to the fact that EU Regulations require no implementing legislation within individual member states - they take effect as soon as they are published by the European Commission.

== Legal basis ==
Direct applicability is a concept of European Union constitutional law that relates specifically to &quot;regulations&quot;, direct applicability (or the characteristic of regulations to be &quot;directly effective&quot;) is set out in Article 288 (ex Article 249) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (as amended by the Lisbon Treaty).

== Relation to direct effect ==
Direct applicability is often confused with the doctrine of direct effect. This confusion is perhaps explained by reference to the treaty provision governing regulations which provides that they, and only they, have &quot;direct applicability&quot; within the member states. The early jurisprudence of the ECJ suggested that &#x27;direct effect&#x27; was a consequence of direct applicability as it was thought that the drafters of the original treaty intended regulations, and only regulations, to be directly effective. However, the expansion of the doctrine of direct effect to include directives and other measures served to create a distinction between direct applicability and direct effect. &quot;Direct applicability&quot; is now taken to mean that regulations require no domestic implementation - if direct effect was only ever intended to be a consequence of direct applicability then the relationship has been severed by a series of ECJ cases.

<text>Eddie Casiano Ojeda (born September 20, 1972) is a Puerto Rican former professional basketball player and is currently the head coach for Atléticos de San Germán. He also was the head coach of the Puerto Rican national team.

He was born in Manhattan, New York, but raised in Puerto Rico. Casiano played for the Atléticos de San Germán, Leones de Ponce, and Indios de Mayagüez in the Baloncesto Superior Nacional in a career spanning from 1988 to 2008. Casiano was also a member of the Puerto Rican national basketball team, he played minimally in 1992 against the dream team and was also a part of the 2004 team that defeated the United States at the 2004 Olympic Games in Greece.

Casiano was an integral part of the San Germán team that won three championships during the 1990s. After being traded to Ponce, Casiano won two more championships with them. After retiring from basketball, Casiano became head coach of the Indios de Mayagüez in 2009. In 2012, he led his team to its first championship in history.

From 2016 to 2021, Casiano was the head coach of the Puerto Rico national basketball team.

==Early years and education==
Eddie Casiano was born in Manhattan, New York City to Puerto Rican parents. At the age of 7, he moved to the island with his mother Carmen Ojeda. After establishing in Bayamón, Casiano started practicing basketball with the support of his mother and grandparents.

Casiano went to Lawrence North High School in Indianapolis and was teammates with North Carolina standout Eric Montross.

Casiano and Nelson Quiñones were teenagers at the time (fifteen and seventeen, respectively) and hadn&#x27;t finished high school yet, when they were signed by the Atleticos de San German BSN team. During his first years, Casiano was kept mostly on the bench and his contributions were minimal. In 1991, with the departures of Bobby Ríos and Ernesto Malcolm from San Germán, Casiano and Quiñones became starters with 18 and 20 years respectively. Because of their age at the time, the team was nicknamed by the media as &quot;Los Nenes de San German&quot; (&quot;San German&#x27;s Boys&quot;). Their sharpshooting style led the team to three championships during the 1990s (1991, 1994, 1997). During this time, Casiano also participated in his first Olympic Games, joining Atleticos teammate Jose Ortiz as a member of the Puerto Rican National Basketball Team.

After the 2000 season, Casiano was traded to the Leones de Ponce along with Bobby Joe Hatton and Carlos Cortés. As a member of the Leones, Casiano won two more championships (2002 and 2004).

Casiano spent the last two years of his career with the Indios de Mayagüez, retiring in 2008 after 20 years of career.

==Coaching career==
After retiring from the BSN, Casiano became the head coach of the Indios de Mayagüez. He led the team to their first championship in 2012. Casiano also served as head coach in the Mexican professional basketball league.

In March 2016, Casiano joined the coaching team of the Cangrejeros de Santurce. He served as assistant to then head coach Julio Toro.

<text>Collegium Vocale Gent is a Belgian musical ensemble of vocalists and supporting instrumentalists, founded by Philippe Herreweghe. The group specializes in historically informed performance.

== Founding and program ==
Collegium Vocale Gent was founded in 1970 by a group of friends studying at the University of Ghent, on Philippe Herreweghe’s initiative. They were one of the first vocal ensembles to use new ideas about baroque performance practice. Their authentic, text-oriented and rhetorical approach gave the ensemble the transparent sound with which it would acquire world fame and perform at major concert venues and music festivals of Europe, Israel, the United States, Russia, South America, Japan, Hong Kong and Australia.

== Repertoire ==

Collegium Vocale Gent has grown organically into an ensemble whose wide repertoire encompasses a range of different stylistic periods. German Baroque music, particularly J. S. Bach’s vocal works, quickly became a speciality of the group. The group performs this music with a small ensemble in which the singers take both the chorus and solo parts. Collegium Vocale has specialized more and more in the Romantic, modern and contemporary oratorio repertoires. To this end, Collegium Vocale Gent enjoyed the support of the European Union’s Cultural Programme since 2011. The result is a shared symphonic choir recruiting singers from all of Europe, in which experienced singers perform alongside young talent. Moreover, Collegium Vocale Gent fulfils an important educational position.

== Collaboration ==
Besides using its own baroque orchestra, Collegium Vocale Gent has worked with several historically informed instrumental ensembles, including the Orchestre des Champs Elysées, Freiburger Barockorchester and Akademie für Alte Musik Berlin. It also works with prominent symphony orchestras such as deFilharmonie (Royal Flemish Philharmonic), the Rotterdam Philharmonic Orchestra, the Budapest Festival Orchestra and Amsterdam’s Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. The ensemble has worked with Nikolaus Harnoncourt, Sigiswald Kuijken, René Jacobs, Paul Van Nevel, Iván Fischer, Marcus Creed, Kaspars Putnins, Yannick Nézet-Séguin and other leading conductors. The vocalists of Collegium Vocale Gent are trained by Christoph Siebert who has also conducted performances at international festivals.

Collegium Vocale Gent enjoys the financial support of the Flemish Community, the Province of East Flanders and the city of Ghent. From 2011-2013 the ensemble has been Ambassador of the European Union.

== Discography ==
Under Herreweghe’s direction, Collegium Vocale Gent has made more than 80 recordings, most of them with the Harmonia Mundi and Virgin Classics labels.These included twelve volumes of Bach cantatas in the 1990s.

In 2010, Philippe Herreweghe started his own label φ (phi) together with Outhere Music. Since then the following recordings were published:

<text>The Ostmärkische Sturmscharen (; &#x27;Eastern March Stormtroopers&#x27;) was a right-wing paramilitary group in Austria, founded on 7 December 1930. Recruited from the Katholische Jugend (Catholic Youth), later from journeymen and teacher organisations, it formed an opposition to both to the nationalist Heimwehr forces and the Social Democratic Republikanischer Schutzbund. The Christian Social politician Kurt Schuschnigg was its &quot;Reichsführer&quot;.

Founded in Innsbruck, Tyrol, the Ostmärkische Sturmscharen spread over the entire Austrian territory when the association&#x27;s headquarters were relocated to Vienna in 1933. The organisation then comprised about 15,000 members according to their own figures, though it never became very popular. Nevertheless, in Lower Austria they incorporated the local Heimwehr and received massive support from the Austrian Bauernbund (Farmers&#x27; League) organisation. The Bauernbund chairman Leopold Figl, post-war Chancellor of Austria, acted as Lower Austrian &quot;Landesführer&quot;.

On the eve of the Austrian Civil War, the Märkische Sturmscharen increasingly adopted a Catholic clerical fascist and antisemite stance. Martial sports and military training became fundamental, and the association began to deploy paramilitary task force formations. Engelbert Dollfuss, Austrian chancellor since 1932, attempted to strengthen them as a counterweight to the radical Heimwehr forces. Sturmscharen troopers also participated in the violent suppression of the Schutzbund revolt in February 1934.

After the Austrofascist Federal State of Austria was established in 1934, Schuschnigg became chancellor upon Dollfuss&#x27; assassination during the Nazi July Putsch and the Austrian right-wing paramilitary forces were gradually absorbed by the Fatherland Front (&quot;Vaterländische Front&quot;, VF) unity party. On 11 April 1936, the Ostmärkische Sturmscharen declared themselves a cultural organisation, hence the final merger of all defence forces into the VF by decree of Chancellor Schuschnigg in October was for them merely a formality. After the Austrian &quot;Anschluss&quot; to Nazi Germany in 1938, some former members of the Sturmscharen engaged in resistance to Nazism.

<text>Howard Cruse (May 2, 1944 – November 26, 2019) was an American alternative cartoonist known for the exploration of gay themes in his comics. First coming to attention in the 1970s, during the underground comix movement with &quot;Barefootz&quot;, he was the founding editor of &quot;Gay Comix&quot; in 1980, created the gay-themed strip &quot;Wendel&quot; during the 1980s, and reached a more mainstream audience in 1995 when an imprint of DC Comics published his graphic novel &quot;Stuck Rubber Baby.&quot;

==Early life==
Cruse was born on May 2, 1944, in Birmingham, Alabama, and raised in nearby Springville, the son of a preacher and a homemaker. His earliest published cartoons were in &quot;The Baptist Student&quot; when he was in high school. His work later appeared in &quot;Fooey&quot; and &quot;Sick&quot;. He attended high school at Indian Springs School in (what is now) Indian Springs, Alabama, and college at Birmingham-Southern College, where he studied drama.

Cruse worked for about a decade in television. In 1977, Cruse moved to New York City, where he met Eddie Sedarbaum, his life partner, in April 1979. Sedarbaum founded the New York activist group Queens Gays and Lesbians United. The couple moved to North Adams, Massachusetts, in 2003, and were married there the following year.

==Career==
Cruse&#x27;s cartooning first attracted nationwide attention in the 1970s, when he contributed to underground comix publications. His best-known character from this period was &quot;Barefootz&quot;, the title character of a surreal series about a good-natured, well-dressed young man with large bare feet. Although dismissed by many underground fans as overly &quot;cutesy&quot;, others found it a refreshing change of pace from &quot;edgier&quot; comix.

Cruse had been open about his homosexuality throughout the 1970s, but aside from having a gay supporting character (Headrack) in &quot;Barefootz&quot;, did not acknowledge it in his work. This changed in 1979, when publisher Denis Kitchen asked him to edit &quot;Gay Comix&quot;, a new anthology featuring comix by openly gay and lesbian cartoonists. For much of the 1980s, he created &quot;Wendel&quot;, a strip (1–2 pages per episode) about an irrepressible and idealistic gay man, his lover Ollie, and a cast of diverse urban characters. It was published in the gay newsmagazine &quot;The Advocate&quot;, which allowed Cruse substantial freedom in terms of language and nudity, and to address content such as AIDS, gay rights demonstrations, gay-bashing, closeted celebrities, and same-gender relationships, with a combination of humor and anger. Two collections of these strips have been published, as well as an all-in-one volume.

Cruse spent the first half of the 1990s creating &quot;Stuck Rubber Baby&quot;, a 210-page graphic novel commissioned by editor Mark Nevelow for his DC Comics imprint Piranha Press but eventually published by DC&#x27;s Paradox Press. It is the story of Toland Polk, a young man growing up in the American South in the 1960s, and his growing awareness of both his own homosexuality and the racial injustice of American society. The book features Cruse&#x27;s most detailed and realistic comics art and his most serious and complex storytelling. It received numerous awards and nominations.

Cruse briefly wrote a column in a comic book review magazine, &quot;Comics Scene&quot;, under the rhyming masthead &quot;Loose Cruse&quot;.

In 2003, the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art featured Cruse alongside Bill Schmeling, Michael Kirwan, Rob Clarke, and Adam (Jack Bozzi) in its &quot;Deliciously Depraved&quot; exhibit.

Cruse contributed to the queer comics anthology series &quot;Juicy Mother&quot;, edited by Jennifer Camper, which first appeared in 2005 and then in 2007.

In August 2009, Howard Cruse self-published &quot;From Headrack to Claude&quot;, a collection of all his gay-themed strips accompanied by commentaries on his career and life, including the never-reprinted 1976 &quot;Barefootz&quot; story where the character Headrack came out, and some unpublished stories.

On March 17, 2010, an original one-off titled &quot;Lubejob&quot; penned by Cruse was published in &quot;Nib-Lit&quot; comics journal. In 2011, Cruse&#x27;s &quot;The Complete Wendel&quot; was republished by Rizzoli&#x27;s Universe Books imprint.

Cruse was chosen as a keynote speaker, alongside Alison Bechdel, for the inaugural Queers &amp; Comics conference in 2015.

Howard Cruse died on November 26, 2019, from lymphoma in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Shortly before, it had been announced that a 25th anniversary edition of &quot;Stuck Rubber Baby&quot; was scheduled for publication from First Second Books.

Howard Cruse is one of 5 queer cartoonists featured in the award-winning documentary film &quot;No Straight Lines: The Rise of Queer Comics&quot; (released in 2021 at the Tribeca Film Festival and broadcast on national PBS in 2023).

<text>Manuel Teixeira Gomes, GCSE (; 27 May 1860 – 18 October 1941) was a Portuguese politician and writer who served as the seventh president of Portugal between 5 October 1923 and 11 December 1925.

==Personal life==
Manuel Teixeira Gomes was born in Vila Nova de Portimão, the son of José Líbano Gomes (from Mortágua), and his wife Maria da Glória Teixeira, who was born in Lagoa, Ferragudo. A wealthy landowner, his father was also an important dried fruit trader, a much travelled man, who had been educated in France and witnessed the 1848 revolution, had republican leanings and had been Belgian Consul in the Algarve.

Teixeira Gomes attended the Colégio de São Luís Gonzaga, Portimão, and the Coimbra seminary. At the age of 16 he enrolled at the University of Coimbra to study medicine, but he abandoned studies one year later and moved to Lisbon, where he established closed ties with local intellectual circles (namely Fialho de Almeida and João de Deus). After completing military service, he went to Porto (1881), where he became friendly with Sampaio Bruno, Basílio Teles, António Soares dos Reis and others. Together with Joaquim Coimbra and Queirós Veloso he founded &quot;Gil Vicente&quot;, a theatrical newspaper. He also wrote for &quot;Primeiro de Janeiro&quot; and &quot;Folha Nova&quot;.

In 1891 his father and other partners had set up a company called &quot;Sindicato de Exportadores de Figos do Algarve&quot; (Algarve Fig Exporters Union), which lasted three years. Manuel was told to find markets in France, Belgium and the Netherlands. He travelled extensively, toured Europe and lingered in Italy. He extended his cultural horizon by wandering through North Africa and Asia Minor.

The company was closed but father and son continued the business on their own. Soon their success meant that they had to enlarge their market to new areas that were familiar to them, North Africa and the Middle East, but meant that Manuel had to travel nine months of the year, returning to Portugal only during the fig picking season.

After 1895 he established new contacts with the literary circles of Lisbon. Through Fialho de Almeida he met Marcelino Mesquita, Gomes Leal and others. Alfredo Mesquita, Luís Osório and António Nobre encouraged him to publish his first book, &quot;O Inventário de Junho&quot;, which came out in 1899.

Due to his father&#x27;s deteriorating health and advanced age, he spent longer periods in Portimão. During this time, he published &quot;Cartas sem Moral Nenhuma&quot; and &quot;Agosto Azul&quot;, in 1904, &quot;Sabrina Freire&quot; in 1905, &quot;Desenhos e Anedotas de João de Deus&quot; in 1907 and &quot;Gente Singular&quot; in 1909.

After he resigned his presidency on 11 December 1925, on the pretext of poor health, he went into voluntary exile on 17 December 1925, travelling to Oran, Algeria, and never returned to Portugal. In 1931 he moved to Bougie, where he lived the rest of his life, always opposing the authoritarian Estado Novo regime.

He had two natural daughters by Belmira das Neves (5 August 1886 – 26 January 1967), daughter of fisherman João de Deus and wife Quitéria das Dores, named Ana Rosa, who was born in Portimão and married José Calapez, also born in Portimão, and Maria Manuela, who was born on 7 September 1910 and married José Pearce de Azevedo (born and died Portimão). He intended to marry her but his parents did not allow him to do so.

==Politics==
A devout republican, he collaborated with the daily newspaper &quot;A Lucta&quot;, edited by Brito Camacho.

Following the implantation of the republic he was invited to be Portuguese Minister in London. In April 1911 he travelled to Britain and presented his credentials to King George V on 11 October, serving as plenipotentiary to the United Kingdom (1911–1918, 1919–1923).

Teixeira Gomes ingratiated himself thoroughly with the British Foreign Office, acting as the principal negotiator for all matters relating to Portugal. He gave particular attention to problems concerning the Anglo-German negotiations on the division of the Portuguese colonies. At the formal request of Great Britain, he cooperated with the Portuguese governments regarding the Portuguese participation on the war.

Teixeira Gomes returned to Portugal in January 1918 and was put under house arrest during the dictatorship of Sidónio Pais. He returned to diplomacy after the fall of Sidonist regime and became minister to Spain (1919) and then again to the United Kingdom (1919–1923). He was a member of the Portuguese Delegation at the Paris Peace Conference (1919–1920) and an unsuccessful candidate of the Democratic Party (Partido Democrático) at the presidential elections of 6 August 1919 won by António José de Almeida. He was a delegate to the League of Nations, serving as Vice-President of the General Assembly (6 September 1922 – 30 September 1922) and was elected in-absentia President of the Republic (6 August 1923), arriving at the port of Lisbon on 3 October 1923.

During his term Teixeira Gomes made unsuccessful attempts to combat terrorism and suppressed at least four major revolts (1924–1925) organized by radicals and the military. He was constantly harassed by the Nationalist Party and, unable to manage political crises, he resigned on 11 December 1925 on the pretext of poor health. He went into voluntary exile on 17 December 1925 and died in Bougie in 1941.

<text>The Winter Palace Hotel, also known as the Old Winter Palace Hotel, is a historic British colonial-era 5-star luxury resort hotel located on the banks of the River Nile in Luxor, Egypt, just south of Luxor Temple, with 86 rooms and 6 suites.

==History==
The hotel was built by Benjamin Herbst in the Upper Egypt Hotels Co, an enterprise founded in 1905 by Cairo hoteliers Charles Baehler and George Nungovich in collaboration with Thomas Cook &amp; Son (Egypt). It was inaugurated on Saturday 19 January 1907, with a picnic at the Valley of the Kings followed by dinner at the hotel and speeches.

The architect was Leon Stienon, the Italian construction company G.GAROZZO &amp; Figli Costruzioni in Cemento Armato, Sistema SIACCI brevettato. 

During World War I the hotel was temporarily closed to paying guests and employed as a hospice for convalescing soldiers. A regular guest at the hotel from 1907 on was George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon, better known simply as Lord Carnarvon. Carnarvon was the patron of Egyptologist Howard Carter, who in 1922 discovered the intact tomb of Tutankhamun. After the discovery was announced the Winter Palace played host to the international press corps and foreign visitors there to follow the story. Carter used the hotel&#x27;s noticeboard to deliver occasional news and information on the discovery.

In 1975 the complex was expanded with the construction of the &quot;New Winter Palace&quot;. The addition, classified as a 3-star hotel, was joined by corridors to the original. It was demolished in 2008.

In 1996, the Pavillon, a 4-star annex with 116 rooms, was built in the rear garden of the Winter Palace, close to the swimming pool. The Pavillon shares many amenities with the Winter Palace, including the gardens, pools, tennis courts, terraces and restaurants.

The hotel is owned by the Egyptian General Company for Tourism &amp; Hotels (&quot;EGOTH&quot;) of Egypt and managed by Accor, a French Hotel company, where it is part of the prime division Sofitel, in 20 December 2023, Icon Company, a subsidiary of Talaat Moustafa Group, acquired 51% of Legacy Hotels Company, which owns the hotel.

The Hotel is featured on the exclusive Palace Hotels of the World.

The Winter Palace has 5 restaurants. The &quot;1886 Restaurant&quot; (French cuisine), and the &quot;la Corniche Restaurant&quot; (international cuisine), are both located in the historic &quot;Palace&quot; wing. The &quot;Bougainvilliers&quot; (international cuisine) is in the &quot;Pavilion&quot; wing, while the &quot;Palmetto&quot; (Italian cuisine and snacks) and the &quot;El Tarboush&quot; (Egyptian cuisine) are in the garden close to the swimming pool.

<text>The Baghdad Bulletin was an independent biweekly English-language news magazine published in Iraq.

==History and profile==
The &quot;Baghdad Bulletin&quot; was first published on 9 June 2003. It was one of an estimated seventy newspapers that were launched in Iraq following the fall of Saddam Hussein after the US-led invasion of Iraq. The founders were Ralph Hassall, a British journalist, David Enders, an American journalist, and Shadi Alkasim, a Jordanian journalist, and Sebastian Woods-Walker and Mark Gordon-James, both British journalists. David Enders was also the editor.

Printed in Baghdad and distributed throughout Iraq, the magazine reported on a variety of issues affecting life during the rebuilding of the country. The &quot;Bulletin&quot; had the stated purpose of &quot;questioning and debating the process and progress of Iraq&#x27;s redevelopment&quot; post-Saddam It strove to overcome an information blackout in Iraq suffered by an increasingly large community of aid workers, journalists, American and British officials, as well as Iraqi English speakers.

The magazine had a full-time reporting pool of Iraqis and Westerners, many of whom were young Oxbridge graduates who had previously written for Associated Press, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Reuters, and the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;. The publication believed that &quot;the presence of a free press offering a forum for all sides is an inalienable human right.&quot;

It aimed to remain non-partisan and provided a forum for an eclectic range of guest writers to debate issues related to the redevelopment of the country. The format was a mix of news and features, with the first edition focusing on issues such as the gun amnesty, the true extent of crime, and the dilapidated state of Baghdad&#x27;s electricity supply.

Printing of &quot;Baghdad Bulletin&quot; was indefinitely halted on 15 September 2003 due to financial and security concerns. The magazine published a total of seven editions and its claimed circulation was 10,000 copies. It was mostly delivered free.

<doc id="918219" wikidata="Q3330049" url="?curid=918219" title="Mummification Museum">
<text>The Mummification Museum is an archaeological museum in Luxor, Upper Egypt. It is dedicated to the art of Ancient Egyptian mummification.

==Location==
The museum is located in the city of Luxor, the ancient Thebes. It stands on the corniche in front of the Mina Palace Hotel, situated to the north of the Luxor Temple overlooking the Nile river.

==Aim==
The museum is intended to provide visitors with an understanding of the ancient art of mummification. The Ancient Egyptians applied embalming techniques to many species, not only to dead humans. Mummies of cats, fish and crocodiles are on display in this unique museum, where one can also get an idea of the tools used.

==History==
The story of this museum began when the Egyptian president decreed that the responsibility of the former visitor centre building was to be transferred from the tourism ministry to that of culture (and, specifically, the Supreme Council of Antiquities). 
It was opened by President Hosni Mubarak in 1997.

==Halls==

The museum, located in the former visitor center, covers an area of 2035 m2 
and contains the following elements:

*Hall of artifacts 
*Lecture hall

<text>The School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) is a graduate school of Johns Hopkins University based in Washington, D.C. The school also maintains campuses in Bologna, Italy and Nanjing, China. 

The school is devoted to the study of international relations, diplomacy, national security, economics, and public policy. The school has hosted world leaders on a regular basis for public debate in international affairs.

The school was established in 1943 by Paul Nitze and Christian Herter who were seeking new methods of preparing men and women to cope with the international responsibilities that would be thrust upon the United States in the post-World War II world. Nitze feared the diplomatic and economic expertise developed in World War II might get lost if the nation became isolationist. Originally founded as a standalone graduate school, it became a part of Johns Hopkins University in 1950.

The school&#x27;s DC campus is located in the 420,000-square-foot 555 Pennsylvania Avenue building, which was purchased by the university in 2019 and has undergone extensive renovation. Previously, the school was based on Embassy Row at Massachusetts Avenue.

== History ==

The School of Advanced International Studies was established in 1943 by Paul H. Nitze and Christian Herter who were seeking new methods of preparing men and women to cope with the international responsibilities that would be thrust upon the United States in the post-World War II world. Nitze feared the diplomatic and economic expertise developed in World War II might get lost if the nation became isolationist. Originally founded as a standalone graduate school, it became a part of Johns Hopkins University in 1950.

The founders assembled a faculty of scholars and professionals (often borrowed from other universities) to teach international relations, international economics, and foreign languages to a small group of students. The curriculum was designed to be both scholarly and practical. The natural choice for the location of the school was Washington, D.C., a city where international resources are abundant and where American foreign policy is shaped and set in motion. When the school opened in 1944, 15 students were enrolled.

In 1955, the school created the Bologna Center in Italy, the first full-time graduate school located in Europe under an American higher-education system. By 1963, Johns Hopkins SAIS outgrew its first quarters on Florida Avenue and moved to a location on Massachusetts Avenue. In 1986, the Hopkins–Nanjing Center was created in Nanjing, China, expanding the school&#x27;s global presence. In January 2019, Johns Hopkins University announced that it had purchased the Newseum building on Pennsylvania Avenue NW and would remodel the building to house SAIS and other Washington, D.C.-based programs.

The school is a member of the Association of Professional Schools of International Affairs (APSIA), a group of schools of public policy, public administration, and international studies.

== Organization and academic programs ==

Johns Hopkins SAIS is a global school with campuses on three continents. It has nearly 700 full-time students in Washington, D.C.; 190 full-time students in Bologna, Italy; and about 160 full-time students in Nanjing, China. Of these, 60 percent come from the United States and 37 percent from more than 70 other countries. Around 50% are women and 22% are from U.S. minority groups. SAIS Europe is home to the Bologna Center and the only full-time international relations graduate program in Europe that operates under an American higher-education system, and the Hopkins–Nanjing Center, which teaches courses in both Chinese and English, is jointly administered by Johns Hopkins SAIS and Nanjing University.

The school offers multidisciplinary instruction leading to the degrees of Master of Arts for early and mid-career professionals, as well as a Doctor of Philosophy program. Approximately 300 students graduate from the Washington, D.C., campus each year from the two-year Master of Arts program in international relations and international economics. Unlike most other international affairs graduate schools that offer professional master&#x27;s degrees, Johns Hopkins SAIS requires its Master of Arts candidates to be proficient in another language outside their mother tongue and fulfill the International Ecopass, a one-hour capstone oral examination synthesizing and integrating knowledge from the student&#x27;s regional or functional concentration and international economics. The oral examination and international economics requirements of the Master of Arts curriculum have been the signature aspects of the school&#x27;s education.

==Rankings==
A study conducted in 2005 examined graduate international relations programs throughout the United States, interviewing over a thousand professionals in the field, with the results subsequently published in &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine as &quot;Inside the Ivory Tower&quot; rankings. 65 percent of respondents named Johns Hopkins University–SAIS as the best terminal master&#x27;s program in international relations. SAIS received the most votes, followed by Georgetown University&#x27;s School of Foreign Service, Harvard University&#x27;s John F. Kennedy School of Government, Tufts University&#x27;s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, and the School of International and Public Affairs at Columbia University. The latest edition of the study was produced in 2014, with the master&#x27;s program at SAIS ranking second globally after the Georgetown School of Foreign Service. SAIS students and alumni have been informally known as the ‘SAIS Mafia’ among international relations circle especially by networks inside the Beltway owing to their presence within the field and close-knit community.

Since 1990, SAIS and the Fletcher School have been the only non-law schools in the United States to participate in the Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition. Competing against full-time law students, SAIS generalists have performed very well. SAIS has twice placed second overall out of 12 schools and advanced to the &quot;final four&quot; in its region. In head-to-head competitions, SAIS has defeated schools such as Georgetown University Law Center and the University of Virginia School of Law.

SAIS students have successfully competed in the Sustainable Innovation Summit Challenge hosted by Arizona State University&#x27;s Thunderbird School of Global Management. Two different SAIS teams won first place in both 2007 and 2008.

A joint team from SAIS and the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania received second place in the first &quot;Global Challenge&quot; competition, a first-of-its-kind competition that challenged teams of MBA and other graduate students to develop a public–private venture to support development and the tourism industry in Asia. The competition was organized in 2010 by the Robert H. Smith School of Business at the University of Maryland and the U.S. Agency for International Development.

Notable economists affiliated with the school include former World Bank Chief Economist Anne Krueger, and former Fulbright Chair in Economics at Harvard University Michael D. Plummer. Many influential political scientists are also affiliated with the school, including Pulitzer-prize winning historian Anne Applebaum, United States Institute of Peace Board Member Eric Edelman, member of the International Board of Advisors at Oxford University Blavatnik School of Government Vali R. Nasr, former Counselor of the United States Department of State Eliot Cohen, former Chair in Southeast Asian Studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Vikram Nehru, former Chairperson of the United Nations Human Rights Council Advisory Committee Obiora Okafor, and former MIT Frank Stanton Chair in Nuclear Security Policy Studies Francis J. Gavin.

== Annual themes ==
From 2005 to 2012, Johns Hopkins SAIS dedicated a substantive theme for each academic year in order to encourage its students, faculty, academic programs, policy centers, and alumni to examine the role of the particular theme within international affairs. These specific themes provided opportunities for the school to review scholarship and exchange views through special lectures, conferences, and guest speakers. The school hosted public events during the following themes of Energy (2005–06), China (2006–07), Elections and Foreign Policy (2007–08), Year of Water (2008–09), Religion (2009–10), Demography (2010–11), and Agriculture (2011–12) and enhanced its fundraising with high-profile public events such as the lecture delivered by then–vice president of BP, Nick Butler, during the Year of Energy in 2005.

== Child Protection Project ==
In June 2009, The Protection Project at SAIS partnered with the Koons Family Institute of the International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children (ICMEC), creating the Child Protection Project, to draft a model law focusing on the issues of child protection; in particular: &quot;neglect, abuse, maltreatment, and exploitation&quot;. The primary objectives of the Child Protection Project are to &quot;research existing child protection laws in the 193 member states of the United Nations (UN); convene a series of regional expert working group meetings to establish a common definition for &#x27;child protection&#x27;; create a database of national legislation and case law on child protection issues from around the world; and draft, publish, and globally disseminate model child protection legislation&quot;.

The drafting process included six expert group meetings, held in Singapore, Egypt, Costa Rica, Spain, Turkey, and the U.S. The final version of the Child Protection Model Law was published in January 2013. It was presented to the members of the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child during its 62nd Session in Geneva, Switzerland, in January 2013. It was also presented before the 129th Assembly of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) in Geneva in October 2013. Accompanying the Child Protection Model Law, ICMEC and The Protection Project published a companion &quot;100 Best Practices in Child Protection&quot; guide in 2013.

<doc id="918225" wikidata="Q2023636" url="?curid=918225" title="On Our Backs">
<text>On Our Backs was the first women-run erotica magazine and the first magazine to feature lesbian erotica for a lesbian audience in the United States. It ran from 1984 to 2006.

==Origin==
The magazine was first published in 1984 by Debi Sundahl and Myrna Elana, with the contributions of Susie Bright, Nan Kinney, Leon Mostovoy, Honey Lee Cottrell, Dawn Lewis, Shelby Sharie Cohen, Happy Hyder, Tee Corinne, Jewelle Gomez, Judith Stein, Joan Nestle, Patrick Califia, Morgan Gwenwald, Katie Niles, Noreen Scully, Sarita Johnson, and many others. Susie Bright became editor-in-chief for the next six years. Later editors included Diane Anderson-Minshall, Shar Rednour, Tristan Taormino, and Diana Cage. &quot;On Our Backs&quot; defined the look and politics of lesbian culture for the 80s, as well as playing a definitive role in the feminist sex wars of the period, taking the side of sex-positive feminism.

The title of the magazine was a satirical reference to &quot;off our backs&quot;, a long-running feminist newspaper that published the work of many anti-pornography feminists during the 1980s, and which the founders of &quot;On Our Backs&quot; considered prudish about sexuality. &quot;off our backs&quot; regarded the new magazine as &quot;pseudo-feminist&quot; and threatened legal action over the logo &quot;OOB&quot;.

==Operations==
In 1985, Sundahl and Kinney spun off the first in a series of precedent-making lesbian erotic videos, called &quot;Fatale Video.&quot; Distribution of the magazine in Australia began in 1986. By the late 1980s, Fatale Media was the largest producer of lesbian pornography in the world.

In 1994, the magazine experienced financial problems, and filed for bankruptcy in May 1996. After being bought out by a new publisher, Melissa Murphy (who released only one issue) , it was acquired by HAF Enterprises (publisher of &quot;Girlfriends&quot;). The original creators moved on to other projects .

==Publishing==

&quot;On Our Backs&quot; was one of the few sex-positive lesbian magazines that were being published at the time; the others being &quot;Bad Attitude&quot;, which lasted from 1984 to 2006; and &quot;Lesbian Contradiction,&quot; which lasted from 1982 to 1994. 

&quot;On Our Backs&quot; was known for its &quot;fleshy photos,&quot; according to philosopher and gender studier Judith Butler. It was meant to represent the perceived lesbian experience and political atmosphere in mainstream culture. It was a publication that existed during the lesbian sex wars. 

==End of publication and availability online==
H.A.F.&#x27;s publication of &quot;On Our Backs&quot; and its sister publication, &quot;Girlfriends,&quot; both ceased publication in March 2006 after being bought out by the publishers of &quot;Velvetpark Magazine.&quot; Reveal Digital, a digital publisher, digitized issues of &quot;On Our Backs&quot; from July 1984 to December 2004; however, due to concerns regarding access by minors and contributor privacy, the scans were removed (at least temporarily) from Reveal Digital&#x27;s Independent Voices collection.

<doc id="918235" wikidata="Q1747305" url="?curid=918235" title="Robin Leigh-Pemberton, Baron Kingsdown">
<text>Robert &quot;Robin&quot; Leigh-Pemberton, Baron Kingsdown (5 January 1927 – 24 November 2013) was a British peer and banker, who served as Governor of the Bank of England from 1983 to 1993.

==Education and career==

Leigh-Pemberton was educated at St Peter&#x27;s Court, then at Eton College. He attended Trinity College, Oxford, graduating in 1950. In 1954, he was called to the Bar, and he practised law for several years before returning to Kent to manage the family estate of Torry Hill. He served as a Justice of the Peace and as Leader of Kent County Council. He eventually became chairman of the National Westminster Bank, then Governor of the Bank of England from 1983 until 1993.

===Honours===
He was appointed to the Privy Council in 1987, and created a life peer on 14 July 1993, as Baron Kingsdown, of Pemberton in the County of Lancashire. He became a Knight Companion of the Order of the Garter in 1994, and was also the Lord Lieutenant of Kent from 1982 to 2002. Between 1979 and 1992, he served as Honorary Colonel of the Kent and Sharpshooters Yeomanry and between 1977 and 1984 he served as Pro-chancellor of the University of Kent. He also served on the board of directors of the Bank of International Settlements

==Personal life==

His family has a long association with Kingsdown and Torry Hill, near Doddington, Kent, where he rebuilt the family mansion in the 1960s. It features a striking view north towards the Isle of Sheppey, the Swale and the Thames estuary. On the grounds of the estate, there is also what is believed to be the only Eton Fives court attached to a private dwelling; it was built in 1925. Lord Kingsdown&#x27;s father also built a private miniature railway in the 1930s. This still runs for several miles on his estate.

One of his sons, James Leigh-Pemberton, continues the family&#x27;s association with the Duchy of Cornwall (beginning with its Chancellor, the 1st Baron Kingsdown) as Receiver-General. His brother Jeremy Leigh-Pemberton is a Deputy Lieutenant of Kent and is the parish chairman for the neighbouring parish of Wormshill.

His younger brother is the opera singer Nigel Douglas.

<doc id="918236" wikidata="Q842853" url="?curid=918236" title="Anthems in Animal Farm">
<text>George Orwell&#x27;s 1945 allegorical novel &quot;Animal Farm&quot; contains various anthems adopted by the eponymous farm, most notably the original anthem &quot;Beasts of England&quot; and its later replacement &quot;Comrade Napoleon&quot;.

The later song &quot;Comrade Napoleon&quot; praises Napoleon and fails to represent freedom at all. This change is used to show the corruption of the principles of the animals&#x27; rebellion by Animal Farm&#x27;s leader Napoleon. Both &quot;The Internationale&quot; and &quot;Beasts of England&quot; reflected the principles of Marxism and Animalism, respectively. Their replacement by different anthems reflects how these ideologies were arguably distorted by Stalin and Napoleon and thus had to be replaced and suppressed.

The development corresponds to the historical events of 1943, when Joseph Stalin had &quot;The Internationale&quot;, previously the anthem of the Soviet Union, replaced with a new, more patriotic national anthem. However, while &quot;Beasts of England&quot; was outlawed in the novel, &quot;The Internationale&quot; was not banned by the Soviet Union at any time and remained as the anthem of the Communist Party.

==&quot;Beasts of England&quot;==

&quot;Beasts of England&quot;, the original anthem of the &quot;Animal Farm&quot; corresponds to the famous socialist anthem, &quot;The Internationale&quot;, but also alludes to Shelley&#x27;s &quot;Men of England&quot;.

In the book, the pig Old Major explains his dream of an animal-controlled society three nights before his death. The song&#x27;s tune is described in the novel as sounding like a combination of &quot;La Cucaracha&quot; and &quot;Oh My Darling Clementine&quot;.

The animals sing &quot;Beasts of England&quot; frequently after the rebellion, especially after meetings. At one point when Clover the horse questions the direction of Animal Farm, she sings &quot;Beasts of England&quot; which causes the other animals to join in.

After &quot;Beasts of England&quot; has been used to express criticism of the direction of Animal Farm, Napoleon tries to supplant the song, arguing that such an anthem is antiquated and no longer needed after the rebellion has been completed. The anthem is first replaced by the short &quot;Animal Farm!&quot; and later by &quot;Comrade Napoleon&quot;, while &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is eventually outlawed. The phasing out of &quot;Beasts of England&quot; as the anthem of Animal Farm corresponds to the Soviet Union&#x27;s 1944 replacement of &quot;The Internationale&quot; with the National Anthem of the Soviet Union. However, while &quot;Beasts of England&quot; was banned in &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, &quot;The Internationale&quot; was not in the Soviet Union at any time and remained the anthem of the Communist Party.

Suzanne Gulbin compares the role of &quot;Beasts of England&quot; to that of the conch in William Golding&#x27;s &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;: it serves to create enthusiasm and unity, and its banning represents the loss of hope for a better life. Florence and William Boos read the fact that the animals continue to sing &quot;Beasts of England&quot; after it is banned as a testimony to the power of the memory of Old Major.

==&quot;Animal Farm!&quot;==
&quot;Animal Farm!&quot; is the anthem first replacing &quot;Beasts of England&quot; after Squealer manages to convince the other animals that the original anthem is not required. Its purpose is to inspire loyalty to the farm, and also to the new leadership. Minimus the poet composes a short, new anthem which starts:

:&quot;Animal Farm, Animal Farm,
:&quot;Never through me shall thou come to harm!&quot;

But it is noted that it does not inspire the animals as much as &quot;Beasts of England.&quot;

Paul Kirschner writes that the switch from &quot;Beasts of England&quot; to &quot;Animal Farm!&quot; is a parody of the transition from Lenin&#x27;s proletarian internationalism to Stalin&#x27;s &quot;Socialism in One Country&quot;. The song itself is most likely a reference to the State Anthem of the Soviet Union.

==&quot;Comrade Napoleon&quot;==

As Napoleon became more powerful, he replaced &quot;Beasts of England&quot; with another anthem, again written by Minimus. The anthem praised and glorified Napoleon, attributing many of the successes on the farm to him, even though he had little or no role in them. The poem marked the general happy feeling towards the rule of Napoleon at the time in the book and was painted on the wall of the big barn opposite the Seven Commandments. It was capped by a portrait of Napoleon drawn by Squealer in white paint.

==1999 film adaptation==
In the 1999 film adaptation, &quot;Beasts of England&quot; is replaced with a song &quot;Beasts of the World&quot;, which has its own tune and different lyrics. &quot;Comrade Napoleon&quot; is replaced by a song titled &quot;Glorious Leader Napoleon&quot;, put to the tune of the Russian song &quot;V Put&quot;. In the same film, a new song was written for Napoleon by a &quot;grateful duck&quot;, called &quot;Napoleon, Mighty Leader&quot; (known as &quot;The Song of the Grateful Duck&quot; in the soundtrack).

<text>Bang () is a Korean word meaning &quot;room&quot;. In a traditional Korean house, a &quot;sarangbang&quot; is the study or drawing room, for example.

In modern Korea (especially in the South), the concept of a &quot;bang&quot; has expanded and diversified from being merely a walled segment in a domestic space, to including buildings or enterprises in commercial, urban, space, such as a PC bang (an internet café), a noraebang (a karaoke room), sojubang (a soju room, i.e. a pub), manhwabang (a manhwa room, where people read or borrow manhwa) and a jjimjilbang (elaborate Korean public bathhouse). This can be compared with the similar expansion of the concept of a &quot;house&quot; to include upper houses, opera houses, coffee houses, and publishing houses.

Phonetically more tensed word &quot;ppang&quot; () is used as an abbreviation of a noun &quot;gambang&quot; (), meaning &quot;jail&quot;.

==Multibang==

&quot;Multibang&quot; is a kind of entertainment venue in South Korea where people can play video games and board games. In addition, they can eat snacks, drink non-alcoholic beverages, sing, and watch films.

<doc id="918245" wikidata="Q4574652" url="?curid=918245" title="Swedish neutrality">
<text>Sweden had a policy of neutrality in armed conflicts from the early 19th century, until 2009, when it entered into various mutual defence treaties with the European Union (EU), and other Nordic countries. The policy originated largely as a result of Sweden&#x27;s involvement in the Napoleonic Wars, during which over a third of the country&#x27;s territory was lost in the Finnish War (1808–1809), including the traumatic loss of Finland to Russia, which it remained part of until Finland gained independence in 1917. Resentment towards the Swedish king Gustav IV Adolf, who had consistently pursued an anti-Napoleonic policy and thereby caused the war, precipitated a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; known as the Coup of 1809. The new regime deposed the king and introduced the Instrument of Government (1809), later formulating a new foreign policy that became known as &quot;The Policy of 1812&quot;.

Since the Napoleonic Wars, Sweden has not initiated any direct armed conflict. However, Sweden&#x27;s military and government have been involved in major peacekeeping actions and other military support functions around the world. The accession to the European Union in 1995 meant that neutrality as a principle was abolished. Sweden remained a non-aligned country in regard to foreign and security policy until joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in 2024.

Swedish neutrality during World War II has been much debated in the years since. Despite the British naval blockade of Nazi Germany, and the official posturing of the Swedish government, Sweden exported iron ore to supply Nazi Germany&#x27;s war industry via the Norwegian port of Narvik. The German war industries&#x27; dependence on Swedish iron ore shipments was the primary reason for the United Kingdom and its allies to launch Operation Wilfred and the Norwegian Campaign in early April 1940. By early June 1940, the Norwegian Campaign stood as a failure for the Allies, and by securing access to Norwegian ports by force, the Nazis were able to obtain the Swedish iron ore it needed for war production, even with the British naval blockade still in place. Sweden also supplied the Nazi German war industry with steel and machined parts throughout the war and provided transportation for armed German reinforcement troops, the 163rd Infantry Division/Division Engelbrecht commanded by General Erwin Engelbrecht, and military equipment through Swedish territory by train from Norway to the eastern front in Finland.

Sweden maintained its policy of neutrality after World War II, despite substantial cooperation with the West. Former Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt has noted that this policy was in response to fears that if Sweden were to join NATO the Soviet Union might respond by invading Finland, with which Sweden retained close relations.

In 2022, Sweden applied to join NATO. Sweden became the 32nd member of NATO on 7 March 2024.

== The Policy of 1812 ==

The new foreign policy, often called &quot;The Policy of 1812,&quot; was directed by Jean Baptiste Bernadotte, the recently elected Crown Prince, who had served as Regent since 1811. The policy of 1812 was in sharp contrast to Sweden&#x27;s previous foreign policy, during which Sweden had been involved in many conflicts, especially with its arch enemy, Russia. However, in 1812, with Napoleon starting a campaign against Russia and Emperor Alexander, the Emperor was in need of allies, and so met with the Swedish Crown Prince in Åbo. At the meeting it was agreed that Sweden would accept that Finland was part of Russia in exchange for the Tsar&#x27;s help in pressuring Denmark to cede Norway to Sweden.

Swedish troops led by Bernadotte took part in the Napoleonic Wars in 1813 and 1814, wherein the Crown Prince authored the Allied Campaign Plan, known as the Trachenberg Plan, and commanded the Allied Army of the North. Bernadotte&#x27;s army fought against the French in the fall of 1813 and defeated them at the Battle of Grossbeeren, Battle of Dennewitz and played a key role in the mammoth Battle of Leipzig. Bernadotte then led an invasion of Denmark. Sweden forced Denmark to hand over Norway by the Treaty of Kiel. This was recognised by the Allied powers at the Congress of Vienna. Since this time Sweden has not taken part in armed warfare (with the exception of peacekeeping).

==Schleswig Question==
During the First War of Schleswig, from 1848 to 1851, Swedish troops were located in Jutland as support for Denmark against Prussian-supported rebels; the Swedish regular troops, however, never experienced any combat. Hundreds of Norwegian and Swedish volunteers joined and fought in the Danish army.

After 40 years of successful trust-building with Russia, Sweden took no serious policy risks in the Crimean War, despite the possibility of a revision of the harsh peace of 1809. Although Sweden concluded an alliance with Britain and France, (November 25, 1855), the country did not engage in warfare.

At the Second war of Schleswig, the Riksdag of the Estates refused to fulfill King Charles XV&#x27;s promises of military support; and Sweden observed a strict neutrality, which would prove to be advantageous. Prussia would soon forge and dominate Imperial Germany, an unmatchable foe for Sweden—whose relative strength had diminished strikingly since its zenith during the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

== World War I ==
Prussia&#x27;s dominance had made the following forty years peaceful in the Baltic region, and by the outbreak of World War I, neutrality seemed a natural state to many Swedes. Although feelings of cultural and scientific kinship with the German Empire were strong in Sweden, mercantile and personal ties with Britain and France were strong as well. Opinion was split between Conservatives, with sympathies for Germany, and Liberals, with more mixed sympathies. Organized but politically less influential were the Social Democrats, antimilitarists and opposed to the war. The neutralist stance was reinforced when Denmark and Norway remained neutral. Voices for neutrality dominated the public debate, but Queen Victoria and some conservatives were strong advocates for entrance in the war on the German side, and the government&#x27;s policy had a clear pro-German bias.

In 1916, the pro-German policy was abandoned, having resulted in famine, rebellious opinions, and no tangible advantages. Once again, the conviction that strict neutrality was most suitable for Sweden dominated Swedish society. A new, less German-minded Conservative cabinet was appointed, and to calm the social unrest, democratic reforms were promptly initiated that cemented Sweden&#x27;s neutralist policy and would soon lead to the political hegemony of Social Democrats lasting up to the 21st century.

==Åland Islands==
The politician who stood as the biggest thorn in the side of the government was the Swedish Foreign Minister, Rickard Sandler (1932–1936 and 1936–1939). Sandler strongly opposed the government&#x27;s policy of strict neutrality, feeling it necessary that the government relax its stringent policy. Sandler expressed a desire to defend Åland from either German or Soviet control, by mining the area around the islands in conjunction with the Finnish government.
The Åland Islands are of extreme strategic importance in the Baltic. Lying at the base of the Gulf of Bothnia, the Åland Islands are situated alongside all the sea traffic lanes that come in and out of the Gulf, and are within range of Sweden, Finland and the Baltic states to the east.

Prior to 1809, the Åland Islands were part of Sweden, who was forced to give them up, along with the mainland area of Finland, in the Treaty of Fredrikshamn on September 17, 1809, to Russia. Out of the ceded areas, including the Åland islands, Russia formed the Grand Duchy of Finland. With the Treaty of Paris of April 18, 1856, at the conclusion of the Crimean War, Russia was required to stop the construction of any new fortifications on the islands, which Russia obeyed, despite unsuccessfully attempting to change the status of the islands in 1908.

In 1914, however, the Russian government turned the islands into a submarine base for the use of British and Russian submarines during the First World War. In December 1917, the Finnish government proclaimed that Finland was a sovereign state and a dispute over whether the islands belonged to Sweden or Finland ensued. In 1921, again despite the fact that almost 100 percent of the islands&#x27; population was Swedish—and that they expressed a desire of being incorporated into Sweden—the League of Nations decided that the Åland Islands should remain a part of Finland.

Despite Sweden&#x27;s grievances over failing to gain control of the islands in 1921, all difficulties between Sweden and Finland were resolved by the mid-1930s. The fear of the Åland islands falling under German or Soviet influence was very real, and that is why Sandler proposed defending the status of the islands.

However, the Swedish government opposed Sandler&#x27;s proposal, in that it was felt that this would set a precedent for further moves—moves that might provoke an invasion from either Germany, the Soviet Union or both. When a new coalition was formed to represent Sweden&#x27;s policy of neutrality, in light of the Winter War, Sandler was dropped from the new lineup of ministers. It was initially believed that the Swedish government had dropped Sandler due to his outspoken comments on the government&#x27;s policies, and the German press&#x27; allegations that Sandler was pro-British; however, in reality it was Sandler who requested permission to retire from the Swedish cabinet, because the government did not represent Sandler&#x27;s anti-neutral views.

==Armed neutrality==

The 1930s marked a new period when Sweden&#x27;s long-standing policy of neutrality was severely tested on numerous occasions, most of which came from a strongly rejuvenated nationalistic Germany. Since the founding of the League of Nations in 1919 and up to the year 1935, Sweden had been a strong supporter of the League, and most of Sweden&#x27;s energy on the international stage had been put into its preservation.

As the collective security system of the League of Nations started to crack with the Abyssinia crisis, and the approach of World War II, Sweden could look back on 120 years of successful neutralist politics – with one singular exception: the volunteer force stationed on Funen to assist the Danes during the First Schleswig War. Sweden now pursued a policy of forging a bloc of neutralist countries in Northern Europe. Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Finland and the Baltic States were all members of this club of neutral states. Of them, only Sweden would be fortunate enough to remain unattacked during World War II.

Opposition to this new policy of armed neutrality was weak in that all major parties, such as the Conservatives, Agrarians and Liberal People&#x27;s Party, supported the government&#x27;s position. On a regular basis, beginning in 1936, the Swedish government requested increases in its defence budget to strengthen its military preparedness as the international situation continued to worsen. The actual military budget from 1936 to 1939 increased many times over. In 1936, military spending was $37,000,000; 1937, $50,000,000; 1938, $58,575,000; and in 1939 it was at $322,325,000. After the war began, military spending peaked in 1942 at $527,575,000 in one year alone. With the increased need of an expanded military, Swedish industry was required to not only supply the increased demand for domestic products, exacerbated by the German blockade of the North Sea, but also had to meet an increased demand in military armaments for the Swedish government. Before the war, production of armaments did not exceed more than tens of millions of Swedish kronor, but during the war, production exceeded the cost of one billion Swedish kronor ($240,000,000).

===Significance of the neutrality policy===
The fate of the Swedish nation largely rested upon the outcomes of distant battles and the policies of distant governments—events outside the control of Swedish politicians and diplomats. Had certain battles or policies during the war been different, Sweden&#x27;s ability to attain a successful policy of neutrality might very well not have succeeded. Finland was invaded by the Soviet Union in the Winter War, fought from December 1939–March 1940. In April 1940, Germany invaded Norway in the Norwegian campaign and occupied Denmark. The British and French sent reinforcements to the Norwegians, but the Battle of France caused a reassessment in priorities, and Norway was abandoned to the Germans. Sweden&#x27;s position was tenuous, with German-occupied territory all around it. Whether from fear of a German invasion if they did not comply with German desires for iron or genuine sympathy, Sweden under Prime Minister Hansson was deferential to the Nazi government. After Germany invaded the USSR in 1941 with Operation Barbarossa, Finland joined in with the Continuation War against the USSR. Sweden was now entirely surrounded by Nazi allies, but the German war machine would also be distracted for the remainder of the war with their struggle with the Red Army. If there were ever serious plans for a Nazi invasion of Sweden, they were put indefinitely on hold due to the more pressing struggle with the Soviets. Sweden would avoid the devastating losses and destruction that so much of Europe suffered during World War II, although how much was due to luck and how much was due to their diplomatic stance may never be clear.

One beneficial consequence of Sweden&#x27;s neutrality was that Sweden was able to act as a refuge to people from occupied lands. Approximately 70,000 Finnish children were evacuated and placed with families in Sweden. There were also refugees from the Baltic nations and the other Scandinavian countries. Nearly all of Denmark&#x27;s Jewish population was able to escape to Sweden on fishing boats in a coordinated effort by the Danish people and the Swedes who gave them shelter on the other side. Sweden&#x27;s neutral stance allowed Swedish diplomats access to Germany, allowing for espionage which benefited the Swedish intelligence as well as the Allies. The Swedish diplomats Raoul Wallenberg and Count Folke Bernadotte saved over 10,000 European Jews from the concentration camps, although they did this largely as individuals rather than being directed to do so as part of an official Swedish policy.

==Scandinavian defence union==
A Scandinavian defence union that would have included Sweden, Norway and Denmark was considered among the three countries after World War II. They would remain separate sovereign countries but act as a single bloc in foreign policy and security issues. The proposed union was discussed by a joint Scandinavian committee during the winter of 1948–1949, but in the end the Cold War tension between the United States and the Soviet Union and preparations for a western alliance that would result in the North Atlantic Treaty superseded the Scandinavian negotiations.

When it became known that the western alliance&#x27;s own pressing needs would prevent them from supplying the Scandinavian countries with armaments, Norway, wanting access to those arms, decided that it would be more advantageous to be a member of NATO and resigned from the talks. Denmark was still willing to enter into an alliance with Sweden, but the Swedes saw few advantages in this and the proposal failed. Norway and Denmark subsequently became signatory parties to the North Atlantic Treaty and members of NATO, while Sweden remained neutral.

==The Cold War==
Sweden maintained its policy of neutrality after WWII, despite substantial cooperation with the West. Former Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt has noted that this policy was in response to fears that if Sweden were to join NATO the Soviet Union might respond by invading neighbouring Finland, with which Sweden retained close relations. While nominally independent, Finland adopted a policy of neutrality on foreign affairs during the Cold War in deference to the neighbouring Soviet Union, which was commonly referred to as Finlandization. During the early Cold War, Sweden&#x27;s neutrality policy was maintained even though its leaders understood that neutrality would probably fail in a third world war. The aim of the policy was to avoid the violent initial nuclear exchange between the superpowers. This was the rationale behind Sweden&#x27;s policy of neutrality until the late 1960s with the advent of second strike capability and nuclear parity.

Initially after the end of World War II, Sweden quietly pursued an aggressive independent nuclear weapons program involving plutonium production and nuclear secrets acquisition from all nuclear powers, until the 1960s, when it was abandoned as cost-prohibitive. During the Cold War Sweden appeared to maintain a dual approach to thermonuclear weapons. Publicly, the strict neutrality policy was forcefully maintained, but unofficially strong ties were purportedly kept with the U.S. Sweden, for instance, cooperated extensively with U.S. intelligence: &quot;Though officially neutral, Sweden in fact built very close ties to both NATO and the US security establishment in the late 1940s and early 1950s and was deeply involved in cold war spying operations.&quot;

It was hoped that the U.S. would use conventional and nuclear weapons to strike at Soviet staging areas in the occupied Baltic states in case of a Soviet attack on Sweden. Over time and due to the official neutrality policy, fewer and fewer Swedish military officials were aware of the military cooperation with the west, making such cooperation in the event of war increasingly difficult. At the same time Swedish defensive planning was completely based on help from abroad in the event of war. Later research has shown that every publicly available war-game training included the scenario that if Sweden was under attack from the Soviets, it would rely on NATO forces for defence. The fact that it was not permissible to mention this aloud eventually led to the Swedish armed forces becoming highly misbalanced. For example, a strong ability to defend against an amphibious invasion was maintained, while an ability to strike at inland staging areas was almost completely absent.

In the early 1960s U.S. nuclear submarines armed with mid-range nuclear missiles of type Polaris A-1 were deployed outside the Swedish west coast. Range and safety considerations made this a good area from which to launch a retaliatory nuclear strike on Moscow. The submarines had to be very close to the Swedish coast to hit their intended targets though. As a consequence of this, in 1960, the same year that the submarines were first deployed, the U.S. provided Sweden with a military security guarantee. The U.S. promised to provide military force in aid of Sweden in case of Soviet aggression. This guarantee was kept from the Swedish public until 1994, when a Swedish research commission found evidence for it. As part of the military cooperation the U.S. provided much help in the development of the Saab 37 Viggen, as a strong Swedish air force was seen as necessary to keep Soviet anti-submarine aircraft from operating in the missile launch area.

== Post–Cold War == 

After the end of the Cold War and the fall of the Soviet Union, Sweden dropped its official policy of military neutrality, but continued to behave as a neutral and non-aligned country. In 1995 Sweden joined the European Union (but declined Eurozone membership) and has since the mid-1990s continued to reduce its armed forces and became involved in more international missions in countries like Bosnia and Afghanistan. The continued reduction of its own national defence and the question of whether the country really could defend itself against an aggressor has led to some criticism.

In 2009 Sweden agreed to enter into mutual self-defence treaties with the EU, and with other Nordic countries, thus ending a nearly 200 year long period of official military neutrality. As a result of a 2010 U.S. diplomatic cables leak, it was learned that the United States government had described Sweden&#x27;s &quot;official security policy&quot; as &quot;non-participation in military alliances during peacetime and neutrality during wartime.&quot; However, Sweden does contribute to various NATO and EU battlegroups and is involved in international organizations. From March–October 2011, Sweden was a participant in the NATO-led international contingent in the War in Libya. In May 2016, a survey showed for the first time that more Swedes favored NATO membership than opposed it. All of the political parties that are part of the right-of-centre coalition favor full NATO membership.

After the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine that began on 2022, more Swedes favored NATO membership than opposed it. On May 16, the Swedish government announced its decision to apply to join NATO after staying militarily non-aligned for 200 years. and after all 31 NATO members ratified the application, Sweden became the 32nd member of NATO on March 7, 2024.

=== Global surveillance disclosure ===
Despite Sweden&#x27;s formal neutrality, Edward Snowden&#x27;s disclosures suggest intelligence links with the US and its allies. In an alleged internal document dating from the year 2006, the U.S. National Security Agency acknowledged that its &quot;relationship&quot; with Sweden is &quot;protected at the Top Secret level because of that nation&#x27;s political neutrality.&quot; Specific details of Sweden&#x27;s cooperation with members of the UKUSA Agreement include how:

* The National Defence Radio Establishment of Sweden (FRA) has been granted access to XKeyscore, an analytical database of the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA).
* Sweden updated the NSA on changes in domestic Swedish legislation that provided the legal framework for information sharing between the FRA and the Swedish Security Service.
* Since January 2013, a counterterrorism analyst of the NSA has been stationed in the Swedish capital of Stockholm

Several years before the Riksdag passed a controversial bill proposing a change in legislation of the FRA, Britain&#x27;s Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the NSA and the FRA signed an agreement in 2004 that allows the FRA to directly collaborate with the NSA without having to consult the GCHQ. As part of the UKUSA Agreement, a secret treaty was signed in 1954 by Sweden with the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, regarding collaboration and intelligence sharing.

<doc id="918246" wikidata="Q844583" url="?curid=918246" title="Boxer (Animal Farm)">
<text>Boxer is a character from George Orwell&#x27;s 1945 novel &quot;Animal Farm&quot;. He is shown as the farm&#x27;s dedicated and loyal laborer. Boxer serves as an allegory for the Russian working-class who helped to oust Tsar Nicholas and establish the Soviet Union, but were eventually betrayed by the government under Joseph Stalin.

He is described as &quot;faithful and strong&quot;; and he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder. David Low used a cart horse as a symbol for the T.U.C. in cartoons for many years before Orwell began to write &quot;Animal Farm&quot;.

Boxer can only remember four letters of the alphabet at a time but sees the importance of education and aspires to learn the rest of the alphabet during his retirement (which never happens). Boxer is a loyal supporter of Napoleon, and he listens to everything the self-appointed ruler of the farm says and assumes, sometimes with doubt, that everything Napoleon tells the farm animals is true, hence &quot;Napoleon is always right&quot;.

Boxer&#x27;s strength plays a huge part in keeping Animal Farm together prior to his death: the rest of the animals trusted in it to keep their spirits high during the long and hard laborious winters. Boxer was the only close friend of Benjamin, the cynical donkey.

Boxer fights in the Battle of the Cowshed and the Battle of the Windmill. He kicks a stable boy during a fight, believing he has killed the boy. Though he dislikes humans, he hates himself for doing so, thinking that he went too far (shortly afterward, it revealed the boy was only stunned, and soon fled to freedom). When Boxer defends Snowball&#x27;s reputation from Squealer&#x27;s revisionism, the pigs designate him as a target for the Great Purge. However, when the dogs attack, Boxer pins one under his hooves, causing the other dogs to flee and the captured dog spared at Napoleon&#x27;s request. When he collapses from overwork, the pigs say they have sent him to a veterinarian, when they have sent him to the knacker&#x27;s yard to be slaughtered, in exchange for money to buy a case of whiskey for the pigs to drink. Benjamin, who is described as &quot;devoted to Boxer&quot;, recognizes that the dogcart Boxer is taken away in is the knacker&#x27;s; however, Squealer deceives the other animals by saying that the dogcart was possessed by a veterinarian who failed to repaint the dogcart. Squealer concocts a sentimental tale of the death of Boxer, saying that he was given the best medical care possible, paid for by the &quot;compassionate&quot; Napoleon. Boxer&#x27;s death is turned into a day of honoring him. Squealer says that his sayings, &quot;Comrade Napoleon is always right&quot; and &quot;I will work harder!&quot; should live on in all the animals; ergo another excuse to make the animals work even harder.

During Old Major&#x27;s speech, which inspired the principles of Animalism, a specific reference is made to how Boxer would be turned into glue under Farmer Jones&#x27; rule, thus implying that it would not happen to him under Animalism. &quot;You, Boxer, the very day that those great muscles of yours lose their power, Jones will send you to the knacker, who will cut your throat and boil you down for the foxhounds.&quot;

==Real life model==
Boxer is based on a coal miner named Alexey Stakhanov who was famous for working over his quota. The Joseph Stalin Regime built a cult of personality around him that rewarded workers who showed a similar heroic dedication to production and efficiency. Unlike Boxer, Stakhanov was allowed to retire and ultimately outlived Stalin. He is a cart horse

==Films==
In the 1954 film adaptation of &quot;Animal Farm&quot;, Boxer is voiced by Maurice Denham. In the 1999 film adaptation, he is voiced by Paul Scofield.

<text>Yuan Shu-chi (; born 9 November 1984 in Nantou County) is an athlete from Chinese Taipei. She competes in archery.

==2004 Summer Olympics==
Yuan represented the Republic of China (as Chinese Taipei) at the 2004 Summer Olympics. She was placed 6th in the women&#x27;s individual ranking round, with a 72-arrow score of 658. In the first elimination round, she faced 59th-ranked Kateryna Palekha of Ukraine. Yuan defeated Palekha 162–158 in the 18-arrow match to advance to the round of 32. In that round, she faced 27th-ranked Polish archer Małgorzata Sobieraj, defeating her 158–149. Yuan then defeated 43rd-ranked Reena Kumari of India 166–148, advancing to the quarterfinals. In the quarterfinals, Yuan faced Yun Mi-jin of South Korea, defeating the 3rd-ranked archer 107–105 in the 12-arrow match to end the Korean team&#x27;s hopes of sweeping the medals. Yuan advanced to the semifinals, where she was defeated by Korean Lee Sung-jin 104–98, moving Yuan to the bronze medal match. In the final 12-arrow match, she lost by one point to 21st-ranked Alison Williamson of Great Britain, finishing just out of the medals at 4th place in women&#x27;s individual archery. Yuan was also a member of the team that won the bronze medal for Chinese Taipei in the women&#x27;s team archery competition.

==2008 Summer Olympics==
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Yuan finished her ranking round with a total of 652 points. This gave her the sixth seed for the final competition bracket, in which she faced Lexie Feeney in the first round, beating the archer from Australia 104–101. In the second round, Yuan was surprised by 27th seed and local Chinese favourite Zhang Juanjuan with the Chinese winning the match 110–105. Zhang would eventually go on to win gold in the tournament. Together with Wu Hui-ju and Wei Pi-hsiu she also took part in the team event. With her 652 score from the ranking round combined with the 634 of Wu and the 585 of Wei the Chinese Taipei team was in eighth position after the ranking round. In the first round they faced the Italian team, but were unable to beat them. Italy advanced to the quarter-finals with a 215–211 score.

==Asian Games==
She also competed in the 2002 Asian Games, where she won a gold medal in the individual event and a silver medal in the team event, and in the 2006 Asian Games where she won a bronze medal in the team event.

<doc id="918253" wikidata="Q6747654" url="?curid=918253" title="Mancopter">
<text>Mancopter is a video game developed by Nichibutsu USA and published by Datasoft for the Commodore 64 in 1984. It was programmed by Scott Spanburg, and the music was composed by John A. Fitzpatrick. The player controls a person piloting a helicopter-like flying device over an ocean competing with computer-controlled pilots. 

==Gameplay==
The player flies the copter by rapidly pressing the fire button on the joystick. If the player stops pressing the button, or runs into some sort of obstacle, then the copter falls into the sea. For a few of these falls, the player is saved by a whale who surfaces with the copter on its head and allows the player to continue the game. If the player runs out of &quot;Fish,&quot; (which can be stolen or recaptured from flying pelicans,) then a &quot;Jaws&quot;-inspired shark eats the player instead and the game is over.

==Reception==
&quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot; called &quot;Mancopter&quot; &quot;challenging enough for adults and picturesque enough for children ... The game is challenging and graphically entertaining&quot;.

<doc id="918255" wikidata="Q6569987" url="?curid=918255" title="List of Ender's Game characters">
<text>&quot;This literature-related list is ; you can help by to include characters from the First Formic War trilogy.&quot;
This is a partial list of characters in the &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; series.

==Wiggin family==
*Andrew &quot;Ender&quot; Wiggin is the protagonist of the Ender quintet and is present in the Bean quartet. He is enlisted in the International Fleet&#x27;s Battle School for his strategic ability and leadership skills. He is eventually tricked into leading battles in the war against the Formics, resulting in the almost-complete destruction of that race. He spends most of his life attempting to find absolution for his unknowing act of &quot;xenocide&quot; by becoming a Speaker for the Dead.
* is Ender&#x27;s older brother. A sociopath, he takes sadistic pleasure in manipulating and brutalizing other children, especially Ender. Peter is rejected from Battle School ostensibly due to his violence, but it is later revealed that his rejection was due to Graff believing that his men would never love him as a commander. In &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, he helps end a global war (with Valentine&#x27;s reluctant assistance). In later books, he becomes Hegemon of the free world and founds the Free People of Earth, the Enderverse&#x27;s first world government.
* Wiggin is Ender&#x27;s older sister, being the middle child of the Wiggin family. Rejected from Battle School for being too sensitive, she serves as the intermediary between Ender and Peter during the former&#x27;s childhood. Later, she helps Peter on his rise to power by becoming &quot;Demosthenes&quot;, an essayist whose rabble-rousing demagoguery is contrasted strongly against Peter&#x27;s statesmanlike essays as &quot;Locke&quot;. After the end of the Formic War, she leaves with Ender on an odyssey through time and space, turning Demosthenes into a historian whose essays are considered the definitive word on whatever subject they address. After marrying on the planet Trondheim, she eventually uproots her family to follow Ender to Lusitania, where she helps to defuse the onrushing Lusitania Fleet and save the alien inhabitants from xenocide.
*&#x27; and &#x27; are Ender&#x27;s parents. &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; portrays them as being dull and oblivious despite the genius children they raised. However, both characters were expanded upon in later works and revealed to be more intelligent than even their children imagined. John Paul is Catholic and Theresa Mormon. Furthermore, Colonel Graff revealed that Ender&#x27;s father was baptized with the surname Wieczorek, hinting at his Polish roots, and was born the seventh of nine children, a serious offense in the Enderverse&#x27;s overpopulation sanctions, both of which he has cast himself away from. It is also later revealed that John Paul was originally accepted to Battle School, but he declined, causing Graff to move him to America in the hopes that he might marry someone brilliant and foster children worthy of leading the war against the Formics.

==Battle School students==
Ender&#x27;s army is a collection of his closest friends at Battle School, particularly those who serve under him in the Dragon Army in Battle School before serving as team leads under his command during the Third Invasion, ending with the destruction of the Formic homeworld. As chronicled in the Bean Quartet, many of them move into positions of international significance during the chaotic years after the end of the Formic War, particularly due to the machinations of Achilles de Flandres. Ender&#x27;s jeesh is the group that works under Ender in fighting the Formics.

* (pronounced &quot;ah-lie&quot;) is a Muslim of North African descent. In Battle School, he was an exceptional student, adroit in the battle room, and was one of the first children to befriend Ender, with the word &quot;salaam&quot; and a kiss on the cheek. They became the best of friends. He also helped lead the special training sessions Ender conducted, and later, during the Third Invasion, became one of the most trusted members of Ender&#x27;s jeesh, due to his innate talent. After his return to Earth, he is eventually elected Caliph of a unified Muslim world.
* is a student of Greek and Igbo descent from the streets of Rotterdam. Though the smallest and youngest member of the jeesh, he is also the smartest and most fair-minded. Ender initially notes that he isolates Bean as Ender himself was once isolated to force Bean to flourish. Though only a supporting character in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, Bean (real name Julian Delphiki II) is the lead character of the parallel storyline book series known as the &quot;Bean Quartet&quot; or &quot;Shadow Quartet&quot;, revealing his role as the behind-the-scenes facilitator of most of the main events of that time period (the victory against the Formics, the uniting of Earth under Peter Wiggin, and so on); being &quot;behind the scenes&quot; is a central theme in these works.
* Meeker is a Battle School student of Dutch descent. He is portrayed as one of those who refuses to play the teacher&#x27;s game. He says that he was offered command of an army twice, but refused to play. He was paranoid about the game, convinced that the teachers were the enemy and that the Bugger War was fake so that all children with the ability for command were in the hands of the International Fleet; however, he loved the game, so he stayed as a toon leader. Eventually, he agreed to become a commander in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot;.
* Carby is an Australian veteran who commands Rabbit Army. In the original short story version of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, Ender held a low opinion of him: In the novel, when Bean was transferred into Rabbit Army, Ender says, &quot;How can they put you under an idiot like Carby!&quot;, but in the expanded novel, Ender&#x27;s reply is, &quot;Carby&#x27;s a good man; I hope he recognizes you for what you&#x27;re worth.&quot; Carby&#x27;s Rabbit Army was the first to battle Ender&#x27;s Dragon Army and was beaten badly. When Carby told the other commanders of Ender&#x27;s new tactics, they didn&#x27;t believe him, so Carby told Ender &quot;to beat the snot out of them&quot; in battle, as a personal favor. His honest and sympathetic behavior made Ender &quot;mentally [add] him to his private list of people who also qualified as human beings&quot;. He is transferred to Command School and serves under Ender during the Third Invasion, one of the few Army members who were never in an army with Ender during Battle School.
* is a British student. He is a veteran soldier who leads &quot;C&quot; Toon in Dragon Army. He got his nickname due to his temperament, as he couldn&#x27;t stand working under commanders he considered stupid. He wrecked rooms and once sent a message to every kid in the school about how bad his commander was.
* is the leader of &quot;E&quot; toon in Dragon Army. He is described by Bean as being among the most worshipful of Ender. Along with the other toon leaders, he is part of Ender&#x27;s jeesh. He is of Peruvian descent, and his real name is Champi T&#x27;it&#x27;u.
* is a Filipino veteran soldier who leads &quot;A&quot; Toon in Dragon Army. He is portrayed initially as being contemptuous of Ender&#x27;s five-toon formation but later accepts it as wise, after arguing the concept with Bean. He was acting blatantly insubordinate and saying that it was a real &quot;loser strategy&quot;, and when Bean stood up for Ender, who was at the time a very young commander, he got mad and almost hurt Bean, but finally, he had to accept that Bean was smarter than he was and that it was a good strategy.
* (nicknamed Hot Soup) is a veteran soldier from China who leads &quot;D&quot; Toon in Dragon Army. Eventually, he was shipped to Command School to become a member of Ender&#x27;s Army and was one of the commanders that served under him during the end of the Formic War. After the war, Han Tzu returned to China before being kidnapped by Achilles. He later returned and became involved in military planning. He is the subject of the 2006 short story &#x27;Cheater&#x27; and a descendant of Yuan Shikai.
* is an Armenian student who is the only female in the jeesh. During Earth&#x27;s invasion of the Bugger worlds, Ender relies on her heavily, often giving her complicated and critical assignments; she is the first student to burn out, falling asleep during a battle. She is a major character later on in the Shadow Series. She and Bean travel around the world to stay alive and eventually get married. Together they have children (nine embryos, one implanted in Petra and the other eight stolen by Achilles; all but one are recovered by the end of &quot;Shadow of the Giant&quot;) and facilitate the downfall of Achilles.
* is a Japanese student who is part of Ender&#x27;s group of launchies. He is introduced as the kid who has a big butt that wriggles when he walks and is constantly mocked by Bernard and his gang. Ender steps in and sends a number of messages under pseudonyms (such as &quot;Cover your butt. Bernard is watching. - God&quot;) to break Bernard&#x27;s control over the room. He becomes Ender&#x27;s first friend in Battle School. He later guides Bean and tells him why the students love Ender.
* was born in Belarus under the New Warsaw Pact. He is known as being a solid student who was always passed up in favor of more ambitious students in the various Battle School armies. Vlad is one of the 40 students chosen to serve in the Dragon Army under Ender&#x27;s command, where he is made leader of &quot;B&quot; Toon. Vlad is one of the eleven students chosen to be in Ender&#x27;s jeesh, helping command the warships of the International Fleet against the Formics in the Third Invasion.

===Other Battle School students===
* de Flandres is the main villain of the Bean Quartet. Like Bean, he grew up in Rotterdam, an orphan on the streets; like Peter, he displays sociopathic tendencies, particularly by murdering anyone who has ever seen or made him helpless. During the years after the Formic War, he takes steps to begin unifying the world under his rule, causing a series of costly wars between India, China, Russia, a united Islam, and large parts of Europe and southeast Asia. He gets assassinated at the end of &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot; by Bean after he gets tricked by Suriyawong who didn&#x27;t kill Bean as promised.
* is a Battle School grad from Thailand who becomes Bean&#x27;s friend during the wars caused by Achilles. He was known as &quot;Surly&quot; due to his pugilistic disposition, but during his time with Bean, he develops into a mature and capable commander.
* is a Battle School grad from India who is instrumental in rousting Achilles from his power base in India. In &quot;Shadow Puppets&quot;, as the conflict between China and India increases, she returns to rural India to devise and encourage civil disobedience there, where she begins to cultivate a divine image. In &quot;Ender in Exile&quot;, she becomes governor of an Indian colony on the planet Ganges.
* is a minor character who is primarily notable due to his involvement in one of the more unusual battles in the &quot;Battle Room&quot;. In the Battle School&#x27;s first numerically handicapped battle, Ender Wiggin, commander of Dragon Army, was required to face both Bee&#x27;s Griffin Army, as well as Talo Momoe&#x27;s Tiger Army. 
* is part of Ender&#x27;s launch group and treats the precocious Ender with great contempt (mostly because Ender had broken Bernard&#x27;s arm on the shuttle to the Battle School). Bernard is also seen as a ringleader and the main antagonist in the first few chapters of the book, and he takes great delight in picking on Ender and Shen, a young boy who is also in the launch group. However, his stranglehold on the clique falls apart when Ender and Alai become friends in the battle room, and after Ender manages to hack into the computer system and posts a message saying &quot;Cover your butts, Bernard is watching,&quot; signed &quot;God&quot;. Later Ender also writes another note, seemingly by Bernard, saying &quot;I love your butt, let me kiss it. - Bernard.&quot; Bernard is one of the six students who accompanies Bonzo Madrid when he fights Ender in the bathroom.
* Delphiki is a major character of the book Ender&#x27;s Shadow and a side character in Shadow of the Hegemon by Orson Scott Card. Nikolai is one of twenty-four fertilized eggs produced by Greek natives Elena Delphiki and Julian Delphiki Sr. A defect in one of Elena&#x27;s fallopian tube and an ectopic pregnancy in the other made it impossible for her to conceive. In their hopes for a child, Elena had several eggs taken out, and Julian&#x27;s sperm was harvested to produce numerous fertilized eggs. The healthiest were cloned, and then the twenty-four healthiest of those were chosen. One was implanted, producing Nikolai. 
* is an antagonistic supporting character, serving to bring out Ender&#x27;s brutal nature while at Battle School. Bonzo, whose real name is Bonito de Madrid, is described as a strikingly beautiful boy of aristocratic Spanish lineage from the town of Cartagena. As commander of Salamander Army, the autocratic Bonzo suddenly has Ender Wiggin thrust upon him when Ender is promoted from his launch group. He is accidentally killed in a confrontation with Ender, bringing six students with him to attack Ender in a bathroom. In the 2013 film adaptation, he survives with a career ending head injury.
*Talo Momoe is the commander of one of the numerous armies at Battle School. He is paired up with William Bee&#x27;s army in a battle against Ender&#x27;s undefeated Dragon Army. Momoe favors a very direct approach, and argues with Bee that, because they outnumber Ender, they should do a frontal assault. Bee&#x27;s disagreement leads to a prolonged war of words. After Ender comes out with a formation, Momoe orders his army to rebound and assault the army directly.
* de Nose, although his first name is Rosen, is the commander of Rat Army when Ender is transferred there. Rose de Nose is also the only Jewish commander at the time in Battle School, which he uses as a crutch of sorts, as military legend has it that Jewish commanders never lose. Rose de Nose treats Ender with considerably more decency than does Bonzo Madrid, the commander of Ender&#x27;s first army, Salamander Army. He is also much more lax about rules; the Rat Army barracks are messy when compared to the discipline and order of Salamander. Rose attempts to impose rules on Ender, but Dink Meeker tells Ender not to listen. As a result, Rose sends Ender out on what is, in essence, a suicide run at the beginning of Ender&#x27;s first battle with Rat Army so that he will get immediately frozen. Instead, due to his unique &quot;legs first&quot; strategy, he is able to disable or freeze many of the enemies&#x27; soldiers to give Rat Army a sizable advantage. Rose gives up picking on Ender, and leaves him to do things his own way. By the time Ender and his group of companions rise to prominence, Rose de Nose has already graduated from Battle School.
* is a recurring commander that Ender twice faces at Battle School. In their first known battle, Ender was still a soldier in Bonzo&#x27;s Salamander Army and Slattery was the new commander of the lowly Leopard Army. What everyone expected to be an easy battle turned into an upset by Slattery. Ender, who had been given orders by Bonzo to stay in the corridor until four minutes after everyone had gone through and then stay in the corner of the battle room, begins to observe Slattery&#x27;s strategies and is impressed. Despite being young, Slattery is sharp and has new ideas; he always keeping his army moving against the stolid Salamanders who are unable to adapt to the situation. Eventually Leopard annihilates the entire Salamander Army, not including Ender. When Slattery is about to send his remaining men to open the gates, Ender ambushes them and takes out enough men to end the game in a draw. Despite helping Salamander Army achieve a tie, Bonzo is furious at Ender for disobeying his orders and would later cause more troubles for Ender.
* (Zechariah Morgan) is an American boy, mentioned only in the novella, A War of Gifts. Zeck is a member of Rat army, but due to his orthodox Christian upbringing, is a pacifist and refuses to fire in the Battleroom. Throughout the novella, he comes into conflict with Dink and Ender, ruining Dink&#x27;s latest rebellion, but at the end, he is accepted as a person and treated as such. His future after Battle School&#x27;s closing is unknown.
*Pinual is a minor character mentioned briefly when Ender encounters the Giant&#x27;s Drink puzzle in the &quot;Mind Game&quot;, a fantasy game meant to evaluate the students personality for the benefit of the Battle School teachers and commanders. Major Anderson mentions that Ender seems like Pinual because he keeps returning to the Giant&#x27;s Drink, to which Hyrum Graff replies that &quot;Everybody looks like Pinual at one time or another. But he&#x27;s the only one who killed himself.&quot; When Ender returns to Earth after Bonzo Madrid&#x27;s death, Major Imbu mentions that Pinual is the only student in the history of the Battle School to have committed suicide.
*Wu is the only girl in Dragon Army. She is given the nickname &quot;Woo-hoo&quot; during her time in battle school. Because of her name, she is most likely of Asian origin. She is one of the few soldiers whom Bean managed to nab for the Dragon Army roster. Wu is a brilliant soldier both academically and physically, but always refuses to become a Toon Leader. When a commander asks her to, she puts in a transfer request and refuses to fight until it is granted.

==International Fleet personnel==
* is the principal of Battle School, and personally supervised much of Ender&#x27;s training. After the war he is put on trial for his controversial actions there, but is given a position within the Hegemony as Minister of Colonization, responsible for sending humanity out to colonize the now-deserted worlds formerly held by the Formics.
* is the half-Māori captain who singlehandedly stopped the Second Invasion by realizing that the Buggers are a hive mind. Due to his inability to pass on his knowledge, he was forced to spend fifty years at relativistic speeds (eight years for Rackham) so that he could train the next commander, Ender Wiggin. After the end of the war, he joins Graff&#x27;s crusade to keep the human race from destroying itself.
*Major Anderson was Graff&#x27;s second-in-command at Battle School, generally seen in the epistolary conversations from &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; attempting to moderate his superior&#x27;s unorthodox training of Ender. His passion is the Battle Room; after the war&#x27;s end, he accepts the post of commissioner for an American football league, and does not appear in the latter three books of either the Ender or Bean quartets. In the film, Major Gwen Anderson is a psychologist who looks after the Battle School students, and is portrayed by Viola Davis.
* is the ranking Admiral at Eros, the International Fleet&#x27;s headquarters, during the final stages of the Formic War; he was not Polemarch during that time, and has assumed that post by the time Achilles de Flandres begins his power plays.

==Other &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot; characters==
* is the physical embodiment of the central consciousness of the Formics.
* Victor Delgado is a mechanic born on the free mining ship El Cavador, that mined asteroids in the Kuiper Belt. When the Formic&#x27;s scout ship was discovered and deemed as a real threat, he was sent on a quick ship to Luna to report the news. On Luna, he was promptly arrested, but freed by Imala. After, he and Imala began teaming up with Lem Jukes to infiltrate the Formic ship and were successful in doing so. They were able to replicate the infiltration mission with a team of MOPs and were successful in destroying the Formic scout ship.
*Jane is an AI that exists within the ansible network.
* Stilson is a bully in &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;. In the very first chapter of the book, he and three friends gang up on Ender, who decides to win thoroughly. Ender&#x27;s counterattacks are so effective that Stilson, unbeknownst to Ender, suffers enough injuries to later die in hospital.

== Characters introduced in &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot; ==
Characters from the planet Lusitania as introduced in the book &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;

=== Figueira family ===
* Pipo Figueira (PEE-po fee-GAY-ra; born João Figueira Alvarez; died 1948) is the first xenologer of Lusitania. He is one of the few people on the planet who treats Novinha as a real person, and becomes her beloved father-figure during her teenage years. He is the first human killed by the piggies, an alien species, and his death prompts Novinha to call for a speaker for the dead.
* Conceição Figueira, is Pipo&#x27;s wife and the archivist of Lusitania.
* Libo (LEE-bo; Liberdade Graças a Deus Figueira de Medici; 1931-1965) is Pipo&#x27;s son and the xenologer after his death. Libo is Novinha&#x27;s first love. Unfortunately, like his father he is vivisected by the pequeninos. His apprentice, Miro, calls for a speaking of his death, which Ender performs. Libo is the father of Novinha&#x27;s children.
** Pipinho (João) is Libo&#x27;s sibling.
**Maria (d. 1936) was Libo&#x27;s sibling who died of the &quot;Descolada&quot;.
**Bimba (Abençoada) is Libo&#x27;s sibling.
**Patinha (Isolde) is Libo&#x27;s sibling.
**Rã (Tomãs) is Libo&#x27;s sibling.
* Bruxinha (Portuguese for &quot;little witch&quot;; born Cleopatra Figueira) is Libo&#x27;s wife.
* Ouanda Quenhatta Figueira Mucumbi (b. 1951), is Libo and Bruxinha&#x27;s eldest child and a xenologer, who falls in love with Miro.
** China Figueira is Ouanda&#x27;s sibling.
** Prega Figueira is Ouanda&#x27;s sibling.
** Zinha Figueira is Ouanda&#x27;s sibling.

=== Os Venerados family ===
* Gusto (Vladimir Tiago Gussman; d. 1936) was Cida&#x27;s husband, Novinha&#x27;s father, and a xenobiologist of Lusitania. He helped cure the &quot;Descolada&quot; virus before succumbing to it. He and his wife Cida were known as Os Venerados after their beatification.
* Cida (Ekaterina Maria Aparecida do Norte von Hesse-Gussman; d 1936) was Gusto&#x27;s wife, Novinha&#x27;s mother, and a xenobiologist of Lusitania. She helped cure the &quot;Descolada&quot; virus before succumbing to it themselves. She and her husband were known as Os Venerados after their beatification.
* Novinha (no-VEEN-ya; born Ivanova Santa Catarina von Hesse; b. 1931) is the daughter of Lusitania&#x27;s xenobiologists. Orphaned, Novinha became distant and formal until finding a scientific sanctuary with Pipo and Libo. Though she and Libo are in love, she refuses to marry and give him legal access to her xenobiology files, which she believes caused Pipo&#x27;s death. She instead marries the abusive Marcão. Her pain, sorrow, and isolation draws Ender Wiggin to Lusitania, and the two eventually marry. Despite this, Novinha never loses her fragility and fear of losing those dearest to her.
** Mingo (d. 1936) was Novinha&#x27;s sibling who died of the &quot;Descolada.&quot;
** Amado (d. 1936) was Novinha&#x27;s sibling who died of the &quot;Descolada.&quot;
** Guti (d. 1936) was Novinha&#x27;s sibling who died of the &quot;Descolada.&quot;
* Marcão (mar-COWNG; born Marcos Maria Ribeira; aka &quot;Big Marcos&quot;; d. 1970), is Novinha&#x27;s late husband. He is known for his fearsome stature, surly temper, and habit of beating his wife, traits which earned him the epithet &quot;cão&quot;, dog; he dies a few weeks before Ender arrives at Lusitania, of a congenital disease which caused his glands to turn to fatty tissues. Among other things, this rendered him sterile, and it is revealed during Ender&#x27;s speaking of his death that none of Novinha&#x27;s children are actually his, but rather Libo&#x27;s; the two agreed to this form of cuckoldry before getting married.
* Miro (MIE-roe; Marcos Vladimir Ribeira von Hesse; b. 1951) is Novinha&#x27;s eldest child. He follows Libo into xenology and falls in love with Ouanda, Libo&#x27;s firstborn daughter by his (actual) wife. In response to this and other factors, he attempts to cross the nerve-stimulating fence separating the piggies from the human compound, suffering brain damage and becoming crippled. He is sent out into space to greet Valentine Wiggin and her family, and later becomes a key player in the events leading up to the almost-second Xenocide. Miro is later healed by Jane.
* Ela (EH-la; Ekaterina Elanora Ribeira von Hesse, b. 1952) is Novinha&#x27;s second child. Like all the females in her line, she becomes a xenobiologist, and is one of the first members of the Ribeira family to warm to Ender. Later in life, she is instrumental in the destruction of the descolada virus, and its replacement with a far-more-benign variant, the &quot;recolada&quot;.
* Quim (KEENG; Estevão Rei Ribeira von Hesse; b.1955) is Novinha&#x27;s third child. He is extremely pious and at first resists Andrew Wiggin on grounds of his atheistic avocation, but later warms to the Speaker, partially for his reputation as a crusader. He later becomes the first Christian evangelist to the pequeninos and holds great respect among them, but is martyred by a particularly heretical forest who believe that the descolada is the Holy Ghost and that it is the pequeninos&#x27; duty to judge all humans with it.
* Olhado (ol-YAH-doe; Lauro Suleimão Ribeira von Hesse, b. 1958) is Novinha&#x27;s fourth child. He is also called &quot;the guy with the eyes&quot;, because a freak laser accident blinded him in his youth, requiring the implant of metal replacements. He has reduced binocular vision and depth perception but can plug a computer jack directly into one eye to upload visual recordings. Due to the resulting ostracism, he becomes a keen observer of human nature and interaction. Later in life he becomes a brickmaker (or at least a manager of them) because, to him, family is a far more important calling than the sciences that took his relatives; nonetheless he has revolutionary ways of looking at physics and metaphysics, and is crucial in the development of faster-than-light travel (via a modified hyperspace mechanic related to philotic theory). Like Ela, he quickly warms to Ender; as he relates to Valentine in &quot;Xenocide&quot;, his greatest secret is that, while alone with Ender, they call each other &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Son&quot;.
* Quara (KWA-rah; Lembrança das Milagres de Jesus Ribeira von Hesse, 1963) is Novinha&#x27;s fifth child. Throughout her life she exhibits stubbornness and contrariness, generally doing whatever the people who love her &quot;don&#x27;t&quot; want her to do. She also becomes a xenobiologist, and assists Ela in &quot;truncating&quot; the descolada, despite discovering that the virus is quite possibly sentient and is certainly able to communicate with other individuals of its species.
* Grego (GRE-goe; Gerão Gregorio Ribeira von Hesse, b. 1964) is Novinha&#x27;s sixth child, only six years old when Ender arrives. As a child he showed a disturbing capacity for destruction, modeled on his father&#x27;s habit of domestic violence, a temper which does not subside during later years. After Quim&#x27;s death, he attempts to whip a mob into a frenzy to attack the responsible forest, only to have them jump on the nearest one to hand Human and Rooter&#x27;s forest after being chewed out by Valentine, Grego tries to end the massacre with as little bloodshed as possible, eventually placing himself between the surviving piggies and his own riot. He later collaborates with Olhado on faster-than-light travel.

=== Other colonists ===
* Bosquinha (Faria Lima Maria do Bosque) is governor of Lusitania and mayor of the colony Milagre.
* Peregrino (Armão Cebola) is the Bishop of the Catholic church of Lusitania.
* Dom Cristão (Amai a Tudomundo Para Que Deus Vos Ame, Portuguese for &quot;Ye Must Love Everyone So That God Will Love You&quot;) is the abbott the Filhos de Mente de Cristo, Children of the Mind of Christ.
* Dona Cristã (Detestai o Pecado e Fazei o Direito, Portuguese for &quot;Hate Sin and Do the Right&quot;) is the principal monk of the order of the Children of the Mind of Christ.

===Pequeninos===
The Pequeninos (Portuguese for &quot;Little Ones&quot;), also known as Lusitanian Aborigines or piggies, are an alien species in the category ramen, or sentient non-human. They are forest-dwelling and technologically primitive, but incredibly intelligent species able to learn languages extremely quickly. They are given the nickname &quot;piggy&quot; by the colonists of the planet Lusitania where part of the series is set due to their pig-like appearance.

*: One of the first pequeninos introduced in the series, Rooter was the most inquisitive of the piggies and had a strong relationship with Libo before he was abruptly brought into his third life as a father-tree. 
*Mandachuva: When Pipo discovered that the Descolada virus, which had nearly destroyed the human population of Lusitania, was a part of the pequeninos&#x27; normal physiology, he went to share that information with the pequeninos. The pequenino Mandachuva brought that news back to the wives, along with the implication that the humans were not all-powerful and godlike, and that in some respects pequeninos were even more powerful than humans. It was a revelation to be rewarded, but when Pipo was asked to bring Mandachuva to the &quot;third life&quot;, Pipo, not understanding the nature of pequenino transformation, thought he was being asked to kill Mandachuva. He refused, preferring to lose his own life in the process. Mandachuva, and the pequeninos in general, thought that they were rewarding Pipo by killing him, bringing him on to his third life, not understanding that no such thing existed for humans. The first crisis in human-pequenino relations occurred with the death of the first xenologer, Pipo Figueira, at the hands of the pequeninos.
*Leaf-eater: Seventeen years after the incident involving Pipo and Mandachuva, the new xenologer and Pipo&#x27;s son, Libo Figueira, suffered a similar fate. The piggy Leaf-eater had convinced the wives to let many more little mothers conceive than normal and then convinced Libo to help them out with the famine that they were sure to face. It was an enormous risk because if Libo refused to help that whole generation of pequeinos would have starved, but the humans did in fact step in and provide assistance. After the first amaranth harvest, Libo was, like Pipo before him, asked to bring Leaf-eater to the third life, and, like his father, refused, thinking that he was saving Leaf-eater&#x27;s life. Leaf-eater killed Libo, thinking on his part that he was helping Libo achieve his third life even though humans did not have a third life.
*Human: One of the sons of Rooter. Human was offered a chance to be brought into the third life as a fathertree, but only if Ender performed the ritual. Like Pipo and Libo before him, Ender showed extreme distaste at the concept, but he managed to do so with a full understanding of the consequences of his actions. Soon after, Ender wrote a biography called &quot;Life of Human&quot; in memory of his friend. The name &quot;Human&quot; was given to him by the Pequeninos &quot;because he was very smart&quot;.
*Star-looker: One of the wives. She represented the pequeninos in their treaty with the humans. She is also called &quot;Shouter&quot; by the brothers behind her back because of her loud voice.
*: A pequenino that died and entered the &quot;third life&quot; as a tree. He convinced a tribe of Pequeninos that the Descolada virus was a form of the Holy Ghost of Christ and that it should be spread to all humans on the Hundred Worlds. The tribe kidnapped and tortured Father Estevão, Ender&#x27;s stepson, by exposing him to the virus for several days without medication. This event triggered a massacre of the pequeninos by the humans of Lusitania.
*Planter: A pequenino featured prominently in &quot;Xenocide&quot;. When it was revealed to him that the descolada was manipulating pequenino behavior, he became almost suicidal, insisting that he be deprived of the descolada until death to prove that the pequenino&#x27;s sentience was not caused by the descolada. Although he never entered the third life as a fathertree, he was awarded the honor of retaining his name after being planted, something which no other brothertree was given.
*Glass: Similar to Planter, Glass was the subject of a descolada deprivation test. However, Glass&#x27;s experiment was the testing of Ela&#x27;s new recolada virus. He successfully made the transition into the third life as fathertree.
*Fire-quencher: The pequenino representative who travels to the planet of the descoladores with Miro, Val, and the others in &quot;Children of the Mind&quot;.
*Arrow: A pequenino mentioned in &quot;Speaker for the Dead&quot;. His name shows how humans affected pequenino culture.

== Characters introduced in &quot;Xenocide&quot; ==
Several of the key characters in the &quot;Xenocide&quot; novel are from the planet of Path. They include:
* is a &quot;godspoken&quot; man from the planet of Path, and a reluctant follower of his religion. His treaty ended a burgeoning rebellion within the Hundred Worlds some three thousand years after Ender&#x27;s Xenocide. Since then he has been retained as an advisor to Starways Congress.
* was the wife of Han Fei-tzu. She was named after an ancient revolutionary leader and was a loving godspoken follower of her religion. She died of a brittle bone disease when Qing-jao was four years old.
* is the daughter of Han Fei-tzu and Han Jiang-qing, also godspoken like her parents. When confronted with evidence that the godspoken affliction is not a sign of deitic favor but rather a genetic modification, giving her and all other godspoken both genius-level intelligence and obsessive-compulsive disorder, she is unable to cope with the truth and clings to her old traditions, spending the rest of her life doing nothing but carrying out her obsessive-compulsive ritual of tracing grains in wooden floors. Some of the phrases she mutters while doing so were later compiled into a book. Her name means &quot;Gloriously Bright&quot;.
* is Qing-jao&#x27;s &quot;secret maid&quot;, an ambitious and extremely bright commoner whom Qing-jao takes under her wing. She met Qing-Jao after she encountered her working in the rice paddy field after bribing her guard with sex. She is named after the Queen Mother of the West, a powerful figure in Chinese mythology. When the godspoken genes are studied in hopes of retaining the genius-level intellect but removing the OCD, it is discovered that Wang-mu has naturally mutated into such a condition, and her genes are treated as a model of what the revision is intended to do. Later, she accompanies the reborn Peter Wiggin on his quest to stop the destruction of Lusitania, and eventually marries him.

== Characters from &quot;Ender in Exile&quot; ==

=== Shakespeare planet ===
*Alessandra Toscano is an Italian girl whose mother encourages her to seduce Ender. Ender rebuffs her attempts, and at the end of &quot;Ender in Exile&quot; she opts to stay on Shakespeare instead of travelling with her mother. 
*Sel Menach is a xenobiologist who was involved in numerous discoveries about the ecology of Shakespeare and eventually was honored with a currency named after him. On the flight to Shakespeare, he is alerted to Quincy Morgan&#x27;s plans to become governor instead of Ender.
*Vitaly Denisovitch Kolmogorov is an admiral who alerted Menach to Quincy Morgan&#x27;s plans.
*Ix Tolo
*Po
*Abra is the boy who Ender was with at the end of &quot;Ender&#x27;s Game&quot;, when Ender discovered the cocooned Hive Queen at the End of the World the Buggers built for him. In &quot;Ender in Exile&quot;, Abra is revealed to be a bright boy of eleven years old who can fix nearly any machine. Abra is not really accepted by the children of his age because he is seen as someone who is at the level of an adult, while the adults mostly see him as a child.
*Quincy Morgan is the captain of the ship travelling to Shakespeare. He attempts to usurp Ender as the governor of the colony, but is forced to stay aboard his ship upon landing and leaves the planet thwarted.

=== Ganges planet ===

* Randall Firth: Originally named Achilles Flanders II, Firth is the missing ninth child of Bean and Petra. Randall was born prematurely and appears to have Anton&#x27;s Key turned. His mother, Nichelle Firth, also known as Randi, believes Achilles is a hero assassinated by foul enemies. Nichelle allows Achilles to implant an embryo, believing that she would be carrying Achilles&#x27; child. To avoid persecution by Peter Wiggin, Randi determines to leave Earth and live in a colony, where she can raise her child and return him to Earth later to become the new Achilles. Nichelle ends up as a part of the colony Ganges led by Virlomi. Randall, called &quot;Achilles&quot; by Nichelle, is raised to see Peter the Hegemon and Julian Delphiki (otherwise known as Bean) as monsters, and to believe that Achilles was a true hero. Randall was one of the first to read &quot;The Hive Queen&quot; and treat it like a holy book, and thus he was also the first to paint Ender in a negative light, as Ender &quot;The Xenocide&quot;. When Ender encounters Randall on Ganges, Randall plots to provoke Ender so that Ender will strike out and kill Randall. He thinks if this can be done, the universe will realize that Ender was a dangerous criminal. However, Ender does not strike out and instead tells Randall about his true mother and father: Petra Arkanian and Julian Delphiki. Randall is so enraged by this that he proceeds to brutally beat Ender, but Ender does not retaliate at all. Just before he delivers the final blow, Randall realizes that what Ender has told him is true, and he takes Ender to a doctor immediately. Randall then decides to rename himself Arkanian Delphiki, after his true parents.
*Virlomi: see Other Battle School students

== Characters introduced in the &quot;Ender&#x27;s Shadow&quot;/Bean Quartet series ==
* Anton is a scientist of European descent who discovers two genetic modifications which will allow the human brain unlimited growth, at the cost of unlimited &quot;physical&quot; growth. This discovery is named &quot;Anton&#x27;s Key&quot; in his honor. However, research into human genetic engineering was outlawed by the international community, and when the nature of his work was discovered, he was subjected to classical conditioning to make it difficult for him to continue or even discuss his research.
* is an unethical scientist of European descent, and the brother of Bean&#x27;s father. He stole Bean&#x27;s parent&#x27;s embryos and illegally modified all 23, &quot;turning&quot; Anton&#x27;s Key within them; only one, Bean himself, ever grew to maturity. Volescu was later discovered and had to destroy all his &quot;research,&quot; but Bean escaped him by, at the age of 9 months, hiding himself in the tank of a toilet. Volescu was later imprisoned for his crimes.
* is an orphan girl from the streets of Rotterdam, the leader of a &quot;crew&quot; of fellow orphans who eventually take in Bean — and Achilles. Poke gave Bean his name, which he was originally unfond of, but later recognizes himself as Bean and ignores Colonel Graff, who tells Bean his true identity as Julian Delphiki. In Rotterdam, Bean, on some instinct, tells Poke to kill Achilles when she has the chance; she refuses, and Achilles later kills her, after kissing her, by stabbing her in the eye and then throwing her in the Rhine. Bean witnessed the kiss in the dark and, after leaving the scene, came to the realization that Poke was unsafe. He rushes back to find Poke already dead; Bean then blames himself for Poke&#x27;s death. When Bean tells the story of Poke to Ender&#x27;s jeesh on the journey to Eros, he decides to trust Petra, saying to her, &quot;You cried for Poke, and that makes us friends.&quot;
*Sergeant is the second in command of Poke&#x27;s crew, and later Achilles&#x27; family. He finds out Achilles killed Poke, but keeps this a secret for his, and everyone else&#x27;s, protection.
* is a Catholic nun who works as a recruiter for Battle School. Like Poke, she takes in both Bean and Achilles; however, her battery of psychological tests manage to identify Achilles for who he truly is. Later, when he escapes from a mental institution in Belgium and begins his reign of terror, she and Bean go undercover to oppose him, eventually linking up with Peter Wiggin. She, like Poke, meets her death at Achilles&#x27; hands; Bean is never able to forgive himself for these deaths.
*Ullysses is a bully in Rotterdam. To help his family receive food from a soup kitchen, Achilles makes a point of beating up Ullysses. When he is released from a hospital he gloats about getting even with him. Ullysses is later killed by Achilles.
*Andrew &#x27;Ender&#x27; Delphiki is Bean and Petra&#x27;s son who travels in the relativistic spaceship with Bean and his two siblings. He is one of four children in which Anton&#x27;s Key is turned. He is determined to find a cure for Anton&#x27;s Key. When he and his siblings find a new world to settle in, he devises and administers a virus that will develop an organelle to shut off their growth genome, leaving their intelligence intact but saving them from the giantism half of Anton&#x27;s Key.
*Rymus Ojman is the chairman of the cabinet of Starways Congress around the year 1970 S.C..
*Jakt is Valentine Wiggin&#x27;s husband. He is originally from Trondheim, where he was one of the most respected lords of a fishing fleet on the planet. He chooses to depart from Trondheim with Valentine while in his sixties.
*Syfte is Jakt and Valentine&#x27;s daughter. She departs her homeworld of Trondheim with her parents and newlywed husband Lars.
*Ro is Jakt and Valentine&#x27;s child.
*Varsam is Jakt and Valentine&#x27;s child.
*Plikt is a young student of Ender&#x27;s from Trondheim. After his departure, she independently figures out that the man she knows as Andrew Wiggin is the original Speaker for the Dead as well as Ender Wiggin the Xenocide. She becomes a long-time friend and tutor of Valentine&#x27;s family and departs Trondheim with them.

<text>.nu is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) assigned to the island state of Niue. It was one of the first ccTLDs to be marketed to the Internet at large as an alternative to the gTLDs .com, .net, and .org. 

Playing on the phonetic similarity between &quot;nu&quot; and &quot;new&quot; in English, and the fact that means &quot;now&quot; in several northern European languages, it was promoted as a new TLD with an abundance of good domain names available. The .nu domain is now controlled by the Internet Foundation in Sweden amid opposition from the government of Niue.

Google treats .nu as a generic top-level domain (gTLD) because &quot;users and website owners frequently see [the domain] as being more generic than country-targeted.&quot;

==Administration==
Unlike most ccTLDs, .nu is not administered by a representative of its country.

In 1997, IANA awarded administration of .nu to The IUSN Foundation (formerly &#x27;Internet Users Society - Niue&#x27;), a Massachusetts-based non-profit organisation. The administration and technical operation of the domain were transferred to The Internet Foundation in Sweden (IIS) in September 2013. The IIS said that 66.7 percent of &quot;active&quot; .nu domains at the time were registered to Swedish users.

The government of Niue has been trying to administer the .nu ccTLD since at least 2003. In November 2018, the government of Niue initiated a lawsuit against the IIS in the Stockholm District Court to obtain control over the domain. It stated that the Foundation had &quot;taken over Niue&#x27;s .nu domain without consent in 2013&quot;, resulting in a significant loss of revenue for the country. Niue&#x27;s government stated that the .nu domain was a &quot;national asset of Niue&quot; and had been taken over &quot;unfairly&quot;, estimating that it had earned between $27 million and $37 million for the IIS. A later estimate by Niue&#x27;s legal team stated that the country had missed out on a total of during the combined time that the domain had been administered by IUSN and the IIS. The IIS responded by saying that &quot;It was and is essential for the Swedish internet infrastructure that .nu works in a stable and secure way&quot;, and that it had &quot;done the necessary investigations before deciding to become the registry in 2013, involving several leading legal specialists and a direct contact with the relevant governmental institutions&quot;.

The government of Niue continues the legal discussion on two fronts: directly with ICANN to get the domain name back, and with the Swedish government to reclaim the lost profits. Toke Talagi, the Premier of Niue from 2008 to 2020, called it a form of neo-colonialism.

While Niue lost its case in the lower court of Södertörns Tingsrätt, they appealed, and the court date for the appeal has been set to 19 and 20 May 2025 in Svea Hovrätt.

==Usage of .nu==
The .nu domain is particularly popular in Sweden, Denmark, and the Benelux region, as is the word for &quot;now&quot; in Swedish, Danish and Dutch – an example of a domain hack. Although in Norwegian is an archaic word for &quot;now&quot;, with being used instead, .nu was initially more popular than .no, with 43,000 .nu addresses being registered in Norway in 1999 compared to 30,000 .no ones. Partially owing to restrictive domain rules for the ccTLD assigned to Sweden, .se, .nu was used for creative marketing of websites such as &quot;www.tv.nu&quot; to show what is currently showing on TV, and in the Netherlands for websites like &quot;waarbenjij.nu&quot; ().

A former political party in Israel, Kulanu, used the domain &quot;www.koola.nu&quot; until its dissolution in 2020.

==Internationalised domains==
In March 2000, .NU Domain Ltd became the first TLD to offer registration of Internationalized domain names, supporting the full Unicode character set. Unlike other TLDs, no browser plugin or punycode capable browser was required on the client side for use of these names, as .NU Domain&#x27;s web servers converted and redirected any web queries issued in a variety of international character encodings. However, in March 2010, .NU Domain announced at ICANN that they had recently disabled their general wildcard domain name resolution technology, and thus were implementing IDNs only by the now standard punycode implementation, and were reducing the accepted set of IDN characters for .NU Domain names to a subset of the ISO-8859-1 western European characters.

==Domain revocation policy==
.NU domain names are revoked without refund for displaying images of child pornography, being involved with phishing, spamming, email theft, search engine abuse, or any unlawful purpose.

In February 2012, library.nu, a site listing links to scanned books, a substantial number of which are claimed to be pirated copyrighted material, went offline after a coalition of the world&#x27;s largest book publishers obtained an injunction against the site. A few days later the site also had its domain name revoked by domain registrar Nunames. The domain revocation was recorded in screenshots taken at the time.

==Litigation==
A 2005 UDRP case regarding nudomain.com made the assertion under &quot;Factual background&quot; that &quot;The Complainants [WorldNames, Inc. and NU Domain Ltd] own and operate the .NU ccTLD&quot;. The companies in question are operating the registry for .nu on behalf of the Internet Users Society, but it is incorrect to state that they &quot;own&quot; the TLD, as TLDs in general are delegated and managed rather than &quot;owned&quot;. The case does, however, point out that these companies own a registered trademark to &quot;.nudomain&quot; in several countries.

<text>Alison Jane Williamson MBE (born 3 November 1971) is a retired British archer who represented Great Britain at six consecutive Olympic Games from 1992 to 2012. She won a bronze medal in the women&#x27;s individual event at the 2004 Summer Olympics, becoming the first British woman to win an Olympic archery medal in ninety-six years. Williamson achieved two medals at the World Archery Championships and represented England at the 2010 Commonwealth Games, winning two silver medals.

Williamson was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in 2012. She announced her retirement from archery in 2014.

==Early and personal life==
Alison Williamson was born on 3 November 1971 in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. She was introduced to archery at the age of seven by her parents, who both practised the sport recreationally. As of 2012, both her parents remained active in the sport, her father holding the position of president of the British archery&#x27;s governing body, Archery GB, and her mother working as a coach. At the age of ten Williamson won a silver medal at the 1981 Wenlock Olympian Games and at fourteen she qualified for her first international tournament.

To garner publicity ahead of the 1996 Summer Olympics, Williamson posed nude as part of a series of photographs showcased in the National Portrait Gallery. In 2003 she received funding from the National Lottery for the first time, allowing her to divide archery practice with part-time work as a primary school teacher. The grants allowed her to become a full-time athlete in 2006.

In May 2012 she participated in the Olympic torch relay, acting as a torchbearer as it passed through the Shropshire town of Much Wenlock on the twelfth day of the route. The following month Williamson was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire for services to archery in the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

Williamson married husband Will Conaghan in 2013. She is a member of the Long Mynd Archers club based in Shropshire. She is a graduate of Arizona State University and in 2000 listed Jamaican sprinter Merlene Ottey as her favourite sportsperson.

==Career==
===Olympic career===
;1992, 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics
Williamson made her Olympic debut at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, finishing the women&#x27;s individual event in eighth place. Four years later at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, she ended the individual competition in tenth position.

Williamson entered her third Olympic Games in 2000 with expectations that she would be a contender for a medal. She was however eliminated in the last sixteen of the women&#x27;s individual event by the eventual gold medalist Yun Mi-jin of South Korea, who posted a new Olympic record score of 173 for an eighteen-arrow match to beat Williamson&#x27;s own tournament best by nine points. Williamson had considered herself fortunate to have progressed as one of the last sixteen archers.

;2004 Summer Olympics
The 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens marked the fourth time Williamson had contested an Olympic archery event. After advancing through the opening elimination rounds Williamson won a controversial quarter-final against China&#x27;s He Ying, who shot her ninth arrow outside of the imposed time limit and had her tenth arrow&#x27;s score voided as a penalty. Williamson was later defeated in the semi-finals by South Korea&#x27;s Park Sung-hyun, and faced fellow losing semi-finalist Yuan Shu Chi of Chinese Taipei in the bronze medal match. After eleven arrows the pair were tied on points, but Williamson outshot Yuan on the twelfth and final arrow to win by a single point and claim her maiden Olympic medal. Her achievement marked the first Olympic archery medal won by Great Britain since 1992 and the first for a British woman since Sybil Newall in 1908.

;2008 Summer Olympics
Williamson was announced to the British Olympic team for her fifth Olympics in June 2008. She was joined by Naomi Folkard and Charlotte Burgess in the women&#x27;s individual and women&#x27;s team events, the three having won gold medal at the 2008 Archery World Cup stage in the Dominican Republic earlier that year. In Beijing the three were successful in reaching the semi-finals of the women&#x27;s team competition before a loss to China relegated them to the bronze medal match against France. Amid difficult weather conditions which postponed the match for 50 minutes, Williamson and her teammates performed below expectations and France emerged as the winners by two points over twenty-four arrows. Williamson was later eliminated from the women&#x27;s individual event in a surprise defeat to Khatuna Lorig of the United States, who in their twelve-arrow encounter shot a score just two points shy of the Olympic record.

Speaking to the BBC after her defeats, Williamson admitted she was contemplating retiring from the sport. She however decided to continue to pursue a place at the 2012 Summer Olympics held in London, saying four years later that she felt &quot;a real determination to take part because it was a home games.&quot;

;2012 Summer Olympics
After having what the BBC called a &quot;mixed&quot; year in 2011, Williamson stated her goal going into 2012 was to qualify for the upcoming Summer Olympics held in London and expressed a particular desire to win gold medal in the women&#x27;s team event. In June 2012 Williamson was again successful in being selected for the British Olympic team, equalling the British record set by fencer Bill Hoskyns and athlete Tessa Sanderson in competing in six consecutive Summer Olympic Games.

Williamson did not have a strong showing in London. She finished the preliminary ranking round for the women&#x27;s individual event in forty-seventh place, a position the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; described as &quot;disappointing&quot;, before being eliminated by Mongolia&#x27;s Bishindee Urantungalag in the opening elimination round. Her participation in the women&#x27;s team event also ended at the first stage after she and her teammates Naomi Folkard and Amy Oliver were defeated by Russia. After her defeat to Urantungalag, Williamson said she was undecided about whether to challenge for selection to a seventh Olympic Games in 2016.

===Other competitions===

;World Archery Championships
Williamson has won two medals at the World Archery Championships. In 1999 she finished with a silver medal, later calling it her &quot;worst sporting moment&quot; in an interview with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in 2004 after shooting below her expectations. In 2007 she and teammates Naomi Folkard and Charlotte Burgess secured bronze medal in the women&#x27;s team recurve tournament, defeating Italy in the third-place match. By reaching the semi-finals they guaranteed a full berth of three female archers for the British team at the 2008 Summer Olympics.

;2010 Commonwealth Games
Williamson won two silver medals at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, reaching the final of both the women&#x27;s individual and women&#x27;s team recurve events. Despite the controversy over the conduct of the Indian crowd during the final of the team event, in which the spectators were criticised for distracting Williamson&#x27;s teammate Amy Oliver while she shot her final arrow of the match, Williamson acknowledged that the opposing Indian team were &quot;worthy winners&quot; of the gold medal, saying &quot;if you&#x27;d offered us silver on the plane on the way over here we possibly would have taken it&quot;. Her second silver medal came in the final of the individual competition, with India&#x27;s Deepika Kumari defeating Williamson by six set points to zero.

===Retirement===
Following the 2012 Summer Olympics, Williamson said she no longer had the same motivation that had driven her to compete at previous Olympic Games, although victory at the national championships shortly afterwards forestalled an immediate retirement. After committing to a break from competitive archery before deciding whether to attempt for a record-breaking seventh Olympic Games, Williamson announced her retirement in April 2014. She cited her inability to &quot;continue to dedicate the hours that are needed&quot;, adding &quot;now the time is right to just concentrate on the day job&quot;.

<doc id="918292" wikidata="Q535856" url="?curid=918292" title="Terry McMillan">
<text>Terry McMillan (born October 18, 1951) is a celebrated American novelist known for her vivid portrayals of African American women’s lives, relationships, and journeys of self-discovery. Her best-selling works, including &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; and &quot;How Stella Got Her Groove Back&quot;, have resonated widely for their humor, authenticity, and emotional insight. McMillan’s contributions have influenced contemporary fiction and continue to shape the representation of Black women in literature and film.

==Early life and education==
The oldest of five children, McMillan was born in Port Huron, Michigan. Her father died when she was a teenager, and McMillan was raised by her single mother, who worked for Ford Motor Co. and who stressed the importance of education. McMillan was introduced to literature while working at the local Port Huron library at age 16–previously, she had only had access to assigned school readings and the Bible. After high school, she moved to Los Angeles where she stayed with a cousin who lived across the street from Los Angeles City College. Upon learning that she could attend for free, McMillan enrolled and began taking writing classes there while working as a secretary for Prudential Insurance Company. She is the first in her family to attend college. McMillan began writing in earnest at the college after a friend asked if he could publish a poem of hers for his new Black literary magazine.

After transferring to the University of California at Berkeley with a scholarship, McMillan considered majoring in sociology because she &quot;care[d] about the human race&quot;; however, an advisor, who had read her articles in &quot;The Daily Californian&quot;, the school newspaper, encouraged her to consider a major related to writing. Initially skeptical that she could make money as a writer, McMillan did go on to receive a B.A. degree in journalism in 1977. She later realized that journalism was not the best pathway either as one has to &quot;tell the truth,&quot; and she wanted to tell stories. McMillan attended the Master of Fine Arts program in film at Columbia University. McMillan stated that she dropped out due to racism she experienced there.

==Career==
In 1976 McMillan published her first short story, &quot;The End,&quot; while still in college. She then submitted a collection of short stories to Houghton Mifflin, and they expressed interest in a novel she had mentioned but declined to publish her collection. 

McMillan&#x27;s first book, &quot;Mama&quot;, was published in 1987. The Harlem Writers Guild had encouraged her to expand one of her short stories of the same name into the novel format. McMillan worked for a month and a half at the MacDowell and Yaddo artist colonies while writing. Unsatisfied with her publisher&#x27;s limited promotion of &quot;Mama&quot;, McMillan promoted her own debut novel by writing to thousands of booksellers, particularly African-American bookstores, and the book soon sold out of its initial first hardcover printing of 5,000 copies. Many of these were presales, and she set up readings and her own book tour to continue the book&#x27;s promotion as well.

In 1987, McMillan taught at the University of Wyoming, moving to the University of Arizona in 1989. That year, she published &quot;Disappearing Acts&quot;, inspired by a prior relationship and focusing on examining doomed Black romantic relationships.

In 1990, McMillan created an anthology of Black writing in &quot;Breaking Ice: An Anthology of African-American Fiction&quot;. She had been dismayed by the lack of Black writers in school curricula as a child, and now as a professor, and wanted to showcase acclaimed and up-and-coming Black authors for people to engage with.

McMillan achieved national attention in 1992 with her third novel, &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;. At the time, it was the second largest paperback book deal in publishing history. The book remained on &quot;The New York Times&quot; bestseller list for many months and by 1995 it had sold more than three million copies. The novel contributed to a shift in Black popular cultural consciousness and the visibility of a female Black middle-class identity in popular culture. McMillan was credited with having introduced the interior world of Black women professionals in their thirties who are successful, alone, available, and unhappy. In 1995, the novel was adapted into a film of the same title, directed by Forest Whitaker and starring Whitney Houston, Angela Bassett, Loretta Devine, and Lela Rochon.

In 1998, another of McMillan&#x27;s novels, &quot;How Stella Got Her Groove Back&quot;, was adapted into a film by the same name starring Angela Bassett and Taye Diggs.

McMillan&#x27;s novel &quot;Disappearing Acts&quot; was subsequently produced as a direct-to-cable feature by the same name in 2000, starring Wesley Snipes and Sanaa Lathan and directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood. In 2014, Lifetime brought McMillan&#x27;s &quot;A Day Late and a Dollar Short&quot; to television audiences, starring Whoopi Goldberg and an ensemble cast featuring Ving Rhames, Tichina Arnold, Mekhi Phifer, Anika Noni Rose, and Kimberly Elise. McMillan also wrote &quot;The Interruption of Everything&quot; (2006) and &quot;Getting to Happy&quot; (2010), the sequel to &quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot;. In 2024, McMillian signed a partnership with Lifetime to executive produce a series of movies which would appear under the banner of “Terry McMillan Presents.”

==Personal life==
McMillan married Jonathan Plummer in 1998, who came out as gay during their marriage. In March 2005, she filed for divorce.

On July 13, 2012, she sold her 7,000-square-foot home in Danville, California, before moving to Los Angeles, California.

McMillan has one child, a son, Solomon.

*(Editor) 
**&quot;Waiting to Exhale&quot; played an instrumental part in promoting a more honest, reflective representation of contemporary black womanhood and played an instrumental role in creating a dialogue in R&amp;B music that was relatable to black women. Her book discussed the everyday needs as well as the sexual desires and pleasures of women that had largely been missing to that point. Daphne A. Brooks argues in her piece &quot;Its not right but its okay&quot; that McMillan&#x27;s work informed and influenced the woman-centered R&amp;B movement that has become very popular today. In today&#x27;s R&amp;B, artists such as SZA, Summer Walker, Jazmine Sullivan, among many others, articulate the experiences of black women, a trend that was jumpstarted by the work of McMillan and the R&amp;B artists who innovated the genre.

<doc id="918293" wikidata="Q343453" url="?curid=918293" title="Chris Klein (actor)">
<text>Frederick Christopher Klein (born March 14, 1979) is an American actor. In film, Klein is best known for his lead role as Chris &quot;Oz&quot; Ostreicher in the &quot;American Pie&quot; film series (1999–2001; 2012). Other lead roles include &quot;Here on Earth&quot; (2000), &quot;Say It Isn&#x27;t So&quot; (2001), &quot;Rollerball&quot; (2002), &quot;Day Zero&quot; (2007), &quot;Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li&quot; (2009), and &quot;Authors Anonymous&quot; (2014). His notable supporting roles include &quot;Election&quot; (1999), &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; (2002), &quot;The United States of Leland&quot; (2003), &quot;Just Friends&quot; (2005), and &quot;American Dreamz&quot; (2006).

In television, Klein has had main roles as Marty Tanner on the CBS sitcom &quot;Welcome to The Captain&quot; (2008) and Orlin Dwyer / Cicada on the CW superhero series &quot;The Flash&quot; (2018–2019). From 2020-2024, he had a main role as Bill Townsend on the Netflix series &quot;Sweet Magnolias&quot;. Klein had a recurring role as Drew on the FX sitcom &quot;Wilfred&quot; (2011–2014).

==Early life==
Klein was born in Hinsdale, Illinois, and moved to Omaha, Nebraska, at age 13, and later attended Millard West High School. In his senior year, Klein was offered his first professional acting job by director Alexander Payne, who was scouting Omaha, his hometown, as a potential filming location for the film &quot;Election&quot;. He attended Texas Christian University (TCU) in Fort Worth, Texas.

==Career==

After auditioning for &quot;Election&quot;, Payne chose Klein and they began filming. The film was released in April 1999, to positive reviews. Soon after, Klein found steady work in the film industry while briefly attending TCU, where he studied theater and was a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity. He was next seen in &quot;American Pie&quot;, acting as Christopher Russell Ostreicher, which opened on July 9, 1999, and was a box office success. The following year Klein starred in &quot;Here on Earth&quot; alongside LeeLee Sobieski and Josh Hartnett (2000). Klein reprised his role in &quot;American Pie 2&quot; (2001) and &quot;American Reunion&quot; (2012), but was not in &quot;American Wedding&quot; reportedly due to scheduling conflicts. In 2002, Klein had a role in the Mel Gibson Vietnam War film &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot;. Klein starred in the 2002, remake of the film &quot;Rollerball&quot;, but the film was a massive critical and financial failure. Klein has also appeared in several teen movies, including &quot;Just Friends&quot; (2005) and &quot;American Dreamz&quot; (2006).

In 2014, Klein was cast as an American pilot in the Damien Lay film &quot;The Uberkanone&quot;. He co-starred in the 2014, comedy indie film &quot;Authors Anonymous&quot; with Kaley Cuoco. In 2018, Klein was cast as Cicada, the main villain of the fifth season of superhero television series &quot;The Flash&quot;.

==Personal life==
In January 2000, Klein and actress Katie Holmes began dating. The couple became engaged around Christmas of 2003. The couple called off the engagement and ended their relationship in March 2005.

Klein met Laina Rose Thyfault, a travel agent, in 2011 at a mutual friend&#x27;s wedding. They got engaged in December 2014, after three years of dating and married eight months later on August 9, 2015, in Montana. In March 2016, Klein announced in a tweet that he and his wife were expecting their first child together. Their son was born in 2016. The couple also has a daughter, born in 2018.

Klein was arrested for drunk driving on February 5, 2005, in San Diego County and again in Los Angeles on June 16, 2010. On June 21, 2010, it was announced that Klein had checked into the Cirque Lodge to begin a 30-day alcohol addiction program. Klein&#x27;s publicist explained that, &quot;after recent events, Chris was forced to take a clear look at a problem he has been trying to deal with himself for years. He understands now that he cannot beat this addiction alone.&quot;

<doc id="918296" wikidata="Q6675184" url="?curid=918296" title="Look to the Lilies">
<text>Look to the Lilies is a stage musical with a book by Leonard Spigelgass, lyrics by Sammy Cahn, and music by Jule Styne.

Based on both the 1962 novel and film versions of &quot;Lilies of the Field&quot;, it tells the story of a group of German nuns, headed by a determined, dauntless Mother Superior, who manage to get an African American itinerant handyman/jack-of-all-trades named Homer Smith to build a chapel for the New Mexico community in which they live, despite not having money to pay him.

==Background==
Styne composed his score with Ethel Merman in mind, but director Joshua Logan cast Shirley Booth instead. Sammy Davis Jr.&#x27;s salary demands put him out of the running, and the role of Homer went to Al Freeman Jr., whom Logan later described as &quot;difficult&quot; and &quot;antagonistic.&quot;

==Production history==
The musical premiered on Broadway on March 29, 1970 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre, where it ran for 25 performances and 31 previews. The musical was the last for Booth, over 70 years old at the time of the premiere, but she garnered unanimous critical raves from the critics. 

Raymond Bordner wrote: &quot;Miss Booth is simply marvelous all the way, and it is a real treat to see her again on Broadway&quot;. Richard Watts, in the &quot;New York Post&quot;, mentioned &quot;Miss Booth&#x27;s warm and gracious appeal.&quot; They also praised designer Jo Mielziner&#x27;s use of desert tones, projections, scrims, and lighting to create the atmosphere and mood of the desert Southwest, but found little else of merit in the show.

<doc id="918323" wikidata="Q495221" url="?curid=918323" title="Lee Sung-jin">
<text>Lee Sung-jin (; born March 7, 1985) is a recurve archer from South Korea. She is a two-time Olympic gold medalist, winning in the women&#x27;s team event at the 2004 and 2012 Summer Olympics. In 2005, she became the women&#x27;s individual recurve champion at the World Championships and achieved the world number one spot for female recurve archers in the World Archery Rankings. In 2016, the World Archery Federation named her as the ninth best Olympic archer in the history of the Games.

==Career==
===Olympic Games===
====2004 Olympics====
Lee made her Olympic debut aged nineteen at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, joining the defending Olympic champion Yun Mi-jin and the 2001 World Champion Park Sung-hyun on the South Korean women&#x27;s team. In the preliminary ranking round, which determined the seedings for the elimination rounds of the individual and team events, Lee, Park, and Yun broke the world record for the combined team score over 216 arrows, their total of 2,030 points from a maximum of 2,160 eclipsing the previous best set by the South Korean team at the 2000 Olympics. The score was nevertheless not classified as a new Olympic record because the ranking round took place prior to the opening ceremony. Lee&#x27;s personal 72-arrow score additionally earned her the second seed for the women&#x27;s individual event.

In the first round of elimination, she faced 63rd-ranked Lamia Bahnasawy of Egypt. Lee defeated Bahnasawy 164–127 in the 18-arrow match to advance to the round of 32. In that round, she faced 34th-ranked Greek archer Elpida Romantzi, defeating her 166–146. Lee then defeated 15th-ranked Margarita Galinovskaya of Russia 165–163, advancing to the quarterfinals.

In the quarterfinals, Lee faced Wu Hui-ju of Chinese Taipei, narrowly defeating the 10th-ranked archer 104–103 in the 12-arrow match. Lee advanced to the semifinals, where she defeated Yuan Shu-chi, also of Chinese Taipei, 104–98. This moved Lee to the gold medal match, pitting her against fellow Korean Park Sung-hyun. In the final 12-arrow match, Lee lost by two points to the 1st-ranked Park, finishing with a silver medal in women&#x27;s individual archery while Park won the gold medal.

Lee was also a member of the team that won the gold medal for Korea in the women&#x27;s team archery competition.

====2012 Olympics====
Lee took part in her second Olympics at the 2012 London Games as part of the South Korean women&#x27;s archery team alongside Choi Hyeon-ju and Ki Bo-bae. South Korea were the heavy favourites to win the women&#x27;s team event, and the trio comfortably defeated Denmark, Japan, and China to win South Korea&#x27;s seventh successive Olympic gold medal in the discipline.

===World Championships===
Lee joined Park Sung-hyun and Lee Tuk-young on the women&#x27;s recurve squad for the 2005 Championships in Madrid, where the South Korean team won gold medal in all four recurve competitions for the first time since 1997. Lee herself won two gold medals, the first coming in the women&#x27;s team event when she, Park, and Lee Tuk-young defeated Ukraine by a margin of fourteen points. She achieved her second gold medal in the women&#x27;s individual event, where she advanced to the final after defeating Park in their semi-final encounter, an outcome described by the &quot;Korea JoongAng Daily&quot; as retribution for the loss Park had inflicted upon her at the 2004 Olympics. Lee defeated Lee Tuk-young in the final by two points, commenting afterwards that the calm weather helped her post a strong points total.

<text>Temptation Island is an American reality television series originally broadcast by Fox. The series premiered on January 10, 2001, and it concluded with its third season on September 29, 2003. &quot;Temptation Island&quot; depicted four unmarried couples who traveled to a tropical island to have their fidelity tested. The couples were separated from one another for two weeks, in which they were required to commingle with a group of single members of the opposite sex whose purpose was to persuade the couples to have an affair. The series drew intense backlash due to its controversial premise; however, it averaged high ratings over the course of its first season. The series is hosted by American television presenter Mark L. Walberg.

In 2018, USA Network announced that it planned to revive &quot;Temptation Island&quot;. The first season of this revival premiered on January 15, 2019. In 2024, the series moved from USA to Netflix.

==Production==
The first season of the show was filmed on Ambergris Caye in Belize. Season 1 premiered on January 10, 2001, and aired its finale on February 28, 2001. The debut episode drew 16 million viewers. The show attracted controversy from the outset, which Fox hoped would drive ratings. Four male contestants lived in one section with a dozen female models, and the four female contestants lived in another section with a dozen attractive men. The initial couples were Kaya Wittenburg and Valerie Penso, Mandy Lauderdale and Billy Cleary, Ytossie Patterson and Taheed Watson, and Andy Lukei and Shannon Roghair. Producers removed Patterson and Watson from the show when they learned that the pair had children together. The remaining three couples continued.

Season 2 premiered on October 31, 2001, and delivered poor ratings. After a nearly two-year layoff, a third edition of the series premiered on August 28, 2003. Like Season 2, Season 3 also delivered poor ratings.

Mark L. Walberg hosted all three editions. Reruns once aired on Hulu, but are no longer available there.

A revamped version of the show, once again hosted by Walberg, premiered on the USA Network on January 15, 2019. USA Network announced the show was renewed for a fifth season on February 26, 2019. On August 22, 2019, it was announced that the fifth season would premiere on October 10, 2019.

On January 28, 2021, it was announced that the sixth season would premiere on February 16, 2021.

On January 26, 2024, it was reported that the series would be moving from USA Network to Netflix.

==Reception==
&quot;Temptation Island&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. Michael Speier of &quot;Variety&quot; negatively compared the series to &quot;Survivor&quot;, referring to it as &quot;merely a lightweight libido experiment.&quot; Ken Tucker of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; believed the series to be &quot;creepy-cheesy&quot;, in which he assigned it a grade of C-.

<doc id="918336" wikidata="Q1143075" url="?curid=918336" title="An Ideal Husband">
<text>An Ideal Husband is a four-act play by Oscar Wilde that revolves around blackmail and political corruption, and touches on the themes of public and private honour. It was first produced at the Haymarket Theatre, London in 1895 and ran for 124 performances. It has been revived in many theatre productions and adapted for the cinema, radio and television.

==Background and first production==

In June 1893, with his second drawing room play, &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot;, running successfully at the Haymarket Theatre, Oscar Wilde began writing &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; for the actor-manager John Hare. He completed the first act while staying at a house he had taken in Goring-by-Sea, after which he named a leading character in the play. Between September 1893 and January 1894 he wrote the remaining three acts. Hare rejected the play, finding the last act unsatisfactory; Wilde then successfully offered the play to Lewis Waller, who was about to take temporary charge of the Haymarket in the absence in America of its usual manager, Herbert Beerbohm Tree.

The play was put into rehearsal in December 1894 and opened on 3 January 1895, billed as &quot;A new and original play of modern life&quot;. It ran at the Haymarket for 111 performances, regarded as a good run at the time. In April, on the last day of the Haymarket run, Wilde was arrested for gross indecency; his name was removed from the playbills and programmes when the production transferred to the Criterion Theatre, where it ran for a further 13 performances, from 13 to 27 April. The play could have run longer at the Criterion, but the theatre was required by its proprietor, Charles Wyndham, for a new production.

The play was published in 1899 in an edition of 1000 copies; Wilde&#x27;s name was not printed: the work was published as &quot;By the author of &quot;Lady Windermere&#x27;s Fan&quot;&quot;. It is dedicated to Frank Harris, &quot;A slight tribute to his power and distinction as an artist, his chivalry and nobility as a friend.&quot; The published version differs slightly from the performed play, as Wilde added many passages and cut others. Prominent additions included written stage directions and character descriptions. Wilde was a leader in the effort to make plays accessible to the reading public.

==Plot==
===Act I===
;The Octagon Room in Sir Robert Chiltern&#x27;s house in Grosvenor Square

Sir Robert – a member of the House of Commons and junior government minister – and his wife, Lady Chiltern, are hosting a gathering that includes his friend Lord Goring, a dandified bachelor, Chiltern&#x27;s sister Mabel and other guests. During the party, Mrs Cheveley, an enemy of Lady Chiltern from their schooldays, attempts to blackmail Sir Robert into supporting a fraudulent scheme to build a canal in Argentina. Her late mentor and lover, Baron Arnheim, induced the young Chiltern to sell him a Cabinet secret – which enabled Arnheim to buy shares in the Suez Canal Company three days before the British government announced its purchase of the company. Arnheim&#x27;s payoff was the basis of Sir Robert&#x27;s fortune, and Mrs Cheveley has Robert&#x27;s letter to Arnheim as proof of his crime. Fearing the ruin of both career and marriage, Sir Robert submits to her demands.
When Mrs Cheveley pointedly informs Lady Chiltern of Sir Robert&#x27;s change of heart regarding the canal scheme, the morally inflexible Lady Chiltern, unaware of both her husband&#x27;s past and the blackmail plot, insists that Sir Robert renege on his promise to Mrs Cheveley. For Lady Chiltern, their marriage is predicated on her having an &quot;ideal husband&quot;—that is, a model spouse in both private and public life whom she can worship; thus, Sir Robert must remain unimpeachable in all his decisions. Sir Robert complies with her wishes and apparently seals his doom.

Toward the end of Act I, Mabel and Lord Goring come upon a diamond brooch that Goring gave someone many years ago. He takes the brooch and asks Mabel to tell him if anyone comes to retrieve it.

===Act II===
;Morning room in Sir Robert Chiltern&#x27;s house
Goring urges Chiltern to fight Mrs Cheveley and admit his guilt to his wife. He also reveals that he and Mrs Cheveley were once engaged. After finishing his conversation with Chiltern, Goring engages in flirtatious banter with Mabel. He also takes Lady Chiltern aside and obliquely urges her to be less morally inflexible and more forgiving. Once Goring leaves, Mrs Cheveley appears, unexpected, in search of a brooch she lost the previous evening. Incensed at Chiltern&#x27;s reneging on his promise, she exposes him to his wife. Lady Chiltern denounces her husband and refuses to forgive him.

===Act III===
;The library of Lord Goring&#x27;s house in Curzon Street
Goring receives a letter from Lady Chiltern asking for his help – a letter that could be misinterpreted as a compromising love note. Just as Goring receives this note, his father, Lord Caversham, drops in and demands to know when his son will marry. A visit from Chiltern, who seeks further counsel from Goring, follows. Meanwhile, Mrs Cheveley arrives unexpectedly and, misrecognised by the butler as the woman Goring awaits, is ushered into Lord Goring&#x27;s drawing room. While she waits, she finds Lady Chiltern&#x27;s letter. Chiltern discovers Mrs Cheveley in the drawing room and, convinced of an affair between these two former lovers, he storms out of the house.

When Mrs Cheveley and Lord Goring confront each other, she makes a proposal. Claiming to still love Goring from their early days of courtship, she offers to exchange Chiltern&#x27;s letter for her old beau&#x27;s hand in marriage. Lord Goring declines, accusing her of defiling love by reducing courtship to a vulgar transaction and ruining the Chilterns&#x27; marriage. He then springs his trap. Removing the diamond brooch from his desk drawer, he binds it to Cheveley&#x27;s wrist with a hidden lock. Goring then reveals how the item came into her possession: she stole it from his cousin, Mary Berkshire, years ago. To avoid arrest, Cheveley must trade the incriminating letter for her release from the bejewelled handcuff. After Goring obtains and burns the letter, Mrs Cheveley steals Lady Chiltern&#x27;s note from his desk. Vengefully she plans to send it to Chiltern as, ostensibly, a love letter from Lady Chiltern to Goring. Mrs Cheveley exits the house in triumph.

===Act IV===
;Same as Act II
Lord Goring proposes to and is accepted by Mabel. Lord Caversham tells his son that Chiltern has denounced the Argentine canal scheme in the House of Commons. Lady Chiltern appears, and Lord Goring tells her that Chiltern&#x27;s letter has been destroyed but that Mrs Cheveley has stolen her note and plans to use it to destroy her marriage. At that moment, Chiltern enters while reading Lady Chiltern&#x27;s letter, but as the letter does not have the name of the addressee, he assumes it is meant for him, and reads it as a letter of forgiveness. The two are reconciled. Lady Chiltern initially agrees to support Chiltern&#x27;s decision to renounce his career in politics, but Goring dissuades her from allowing her husband to resign. When Chiltern refuses Goring his sister&#x27;s hand in marriage, still believing he has taken up with Mrs Cheveley, Lady Chiltern is forced to explain last night&#x27;s events and the true nature of the letter. Chiltern relents, and Goring and Mabel are permitted to marry. Lady Chiltern reaffirms her love for her husband and says, &quot;For both of us a new life is beginning&quot;.

==Reception==
In &quot;The Pall Mall Gazette&quot;, H. G. Wells wrote of the play:
William Archer wrote, &quot;&quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; is a very able and entertaining piece of work, charmingly written, wherever Mr. Wilde can find it in his heart to his wit. There are several scenes in which the dialogue is heavily overburdened with witticisms, not always of the best alloy. ... &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;, however, does not positively lack good things, but simply suffers from a disproportionate profusion of inferior chatter.&quot; A. B. Walkley called the play &quot;a , polychromatic, scintillant affair, dexterous as a conjurer&#x27;s trick of legerdemain, clever with a cleverness so excessive as to be almost monstrous and uncanny&quot;. He found the plot unbelievable, and thought that although the play, &quot;by sheer cleverness, keeps one continually amused and interested&quot;, Wilde&#x27;s work was &quot;not only poor and sterile, but essentially vulgar&quot;. George Bernard Shaw praised the play: &quot;In a certain sense Mr Wilde is to me our only thorough playwright. He plays with everything: with wit, with philosophy, with drama, with actors and audience, with the whole theatre. Such a feat scandalizes the Englishman...&quot;.

In 1996 the critic Bindon Russell wrote that &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; is &quot;the most autobiographical of Wilde&#x27;s plays, mirroring, as it does, his own situation of a double life and an incipient scandal with the emergence of terrible secrets. Whilst Lord Goring is a character with much of Wilde&#x27;s own wit, insight and compassion, Gertrude Chiltern can be seen as a portrait of Constance [Wilde]&quot;.

==Production history==
===Britain===
The first West End revival was presented by George Alexander in May 1914 at the St James&#x27;s Theatre, and featured Arthur Wontner as Sir Robert Chiltern, Phyllis Neilson-Terry as Lady Chiltern, Hilda Moore as Mrs Cheveley and Alexander as Lord Goring. The play was next staged in London at the Westminster Theatre in 1943–44, with Manning Whiley as Sir Robert Chiltern, Rosemary Scott as Lady Chiltern, Martita Hunt as Mrs Cheveley, Roland Culver as Lord Goring and Irene Vanbrugh as Lady Markby, set design by Rex Whistler.

A London revival in 1965–66 ran at three West End theatres in succession; it starred Michael Denison as Sir Robert Chiltern, Dulcie Gray as Lady Chiltern, Margaret Lockwood as Mrs Cheveley and Richard Todd as Lord Goring. The play was again seen at the Westminster in 1989 in a short-lived revival, and in 1992 a new production was presented at the Globe Theatre which was subsequently seen in four other London theatres and on Broadway between November 1992 and March 1999. It was directed by Peter Hall, and the original cast featured David Yelland as Sir Robert Chiltern, Hannah Gordon as Lady Chiltern, Anna Carteret as Mrs Cheveley, Martin Shaw as Lord Goring, Michael Denison as Lord Caversham and Dulcie Gray as Lady Markby. The various stagings of the production ran for an aggregate three years, the longest running production of a Wilde play.

A production at the Vaudeville Theatre, London in 2010–11 featured Alexander Hanson as Sir Robert Chiltern, Rachael Stirling as Lady Chiltern, Samantha Bond as Mrs Cheveley and Elliot Cowan. A revival at the same theatre in 2018 featured Nathaniel Parker and Sally Bretton as the Chilterns, the father and son combination of Edward Fox as Lord Caversham and Freddie Fox as Lord Goring, and Frances Barber as Mrs Cheveley, and Susan Hampshire as Lady Markby.

===International===
The play was seen in the US in March 1895, running at the Lyceum Theatre on Broadway for 40 performances. It was revived on Broadway at the Comedy Theatre in 1918 with a cast including Norman Trevor and Beatrice Beckley as the Chilterns, Julian L&#x27;Estrange as Lord Goring and Constance Collier as Mrs Cheveley. The next (and at 2021 the most recent) Broadway presentation was Peter Hall&#x27;s production, seen at the Ethel Barrymore Theatre in 1996–97, featuring its original West End lead players, except for the Lady Chiltern, now played by Penny Downie.

&quot;An Ideal Husband&quot; was produced in Australia in April 1895 by the Brough-Boucicault company; they gave the play its New Zealand premiere later in the same year. The Irish premiere was in Dublin in 1896, given (with no mention of the author&#x27;s name) by a touring company managed by Hawtrey, at the Gaiety Theatre. The cast included Alma Stanley as Mrs Cheveley and Cosmo Stuart, promoted from his small role in the London production, as Lord Goring.

A French translation was given in Geneva in 1944. The first performance in France recorded by Les Archives du spectacle was in 1955; the site records seven French productions between then and 2016.

===Commemoration===
To mark the centenary of the first production, Sir John Gielgud unveiled a plaque at the Haymarket Theatre in January 1995, in the presence of, among many others, Wilde&#x27;s grandson Merlin Holland and the Marquess of Queensberry.

==Adaptations==
===Films===
There have been at least five adaptations of the play for the cinema:
===Radio and television ===
The BBC has broadcast seven radio adaptations since its first, in 1926: a 1932 version starring Leslie Perrins and Kyrle Bellew; a radio version of the 1943 Westminster Theatre production; a Bristol Old Vic version in 1947 featuring William Devlin, Elizabeth Sellars, Catherine Lacey and Robert Eddison; a 1950 production with Griffith Jones, Fay Compton and Isabel Jeans; a 1954 version produced by Val Gielgud; a 1959 adaptation starring Tony Britton and Faith Brook; a 1970 version with Noel Johnson, Ronald Lewis, Jane Wenham and Rosemary Martin; and a 2007 adaption with Alex Jennings, Emma Fielding, Janet McTeer and Jasper Britton.

BBC television adaptations were broadcast in 1958 (with Ronald Leigh-Hunt, Sarah Lawson, Faith Brook and Tony Britton) and 1969 (with Keith Michell, Dinah Sheridan, Margaret Leighton and Jeremy Brett).

A television version (&quot;Ein Idealer Gatte&quot;) in German was broadcast in June 1958 by Nord und Westdeutscher Rundfunkverband (NWRV) with Marius Goring as Lord Goring and Albert Lieven as Sir Robert Chiltern.

<text>.to is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) of the Kingdom of Tonga.

The government of Tonga sells domains in its ccTLD to any interested party. The .to ccTLD is administered by the Tonga Network Information Center (Tonic).

== Background ==
The .to top-level domain was widely commercialized in 1997 by the San Francisco company Tonic Corp. (founded by Eric Gullichsen and Eric Lyons) which would sell domains at $100 per unit. They operated with the approval of Prince Siaosi, then-Crown Prince of Tonga. Network Solutions was already selling .to domains, but in a very chaotic fashion. Domain requests were processed by the Tongan consulate in San Francisco.

The top-level domain &quot;to&quot; itself had an A record and an HTTP server since at least 1998.

== Description ==
Because is a common English preposition, it became popular to craft memorable URLs called domain hacks that take advantage of this; URL shortening/redirection services and torrent aggregators (e.g. isohunt.to) are popular uses. Other domain hacks do not use the &quot;to&quot; as a preposition but rather as a syllable inside of a word, including Daniel J. Bernstein&#x27;s website cr.yp.to, London web development company Potato p.ota.to. 

&quot;T.O.&quot; is also a common nickname for Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and is used as a city domain. This domain is also used for the city of Torino (Turin), Italy, and also as a domain hack in Slavic languages (&quot;to&quot; meaning &quot;it&quot; or &quot;that&quot;) – such as the uploading service uloz.to (&quot;ulož to&quot; means &quot;save it&quot; in Czech and Slovak).

As the .to domains are purchased, all normal DNS operations are possible and registered sites are not required to display ads on behalf of the registrar. Some domains are free, like .edu.to, but only to real Tongan educational institutions. At this moment businesses registered in Tonga can also get free domains. People who sell on .to domains can claim a commission.

.to is one of the few ccTLDs that (officially) does not maintain a (public) WHOIS database for providing registrant information. It is possible to contact domain registrants via tonic.to by typing the domain in the domain search field under &quot;New Domain Name&quot;. This has resulted in limited popularity for the use of .to for websites involved in copyright infringement.

The .to registry allows the creation of emoji domain names. A former .to registrar, Register.TO, did support the search and registration of .to emoji domain names. Register.TO is no longer an authorized registrar for .to domain names, following the death of its owner in early 2023 as stated by the NIC of Tonga.

<doc id="918360" wikidata="Q233884" url="?curid=918360" title="Park Sung-hyun (archer)">
<text>Park Sung-hyun (; born 1 January 1983) is an archer from South Korea who competed in two Olympic Games, winning three gold medals. Park made her international archery debut in 2001, winning the women&#x27;s recurve title at that year&#x27;s World Archery Championships. Her Olympic debut came at the 2004 Summer Olympics, where she won gold medals in both the women&#x27;s individual and women&#x27;s team events. She won two further medals at the 2008 Summer Olympics, achieving her third Olympic gold in the women&#x27;s team event before earning the silver medal as the runner-up in the women&#x27;s individual event.

During her career Park achieved success in a variety of international competitions. She was the first South Korean archer to achieve gold medals at the Olympics, the World Championships, the Asian Games, and the Asian Championships. She was the first recurve archer to post at least 1,400 points in a 144-arrow round, and was from 2004 to 2015 the world record holder for the women&#x27;s 72-arrow round. In 2016 the World Archery Federation named her as the greatest Olympic archer of the 21st century and the third greatest archer of all time.

==Early and personal life==
Park was born on 1 January 1983 in Incheon. She married fellow archer and Olympic gold medalist Park Kyung-mo in December 2008, disclosing their intention to wed following the 2008 Summer Olympics to avoid disrupting the national team during the Olympic competitions. As of the 2008 Summer Olympics Park lived in Gunsan in western South Korea. She has three daughters.

==Career==
===Olympic career===
====2004 Summer Olympics====
Park began the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens with a new women&#x27;s world record for the preliminary 72-arrow ranking round, scoring 682 points (from a maximum of 720) to surpass the previous best of 679 set by Italy&#x27;s Natalia Valeeva three months earlier. The score did not count as Olympic record because the ranking round took place prior to the Olympic opening ceremony. With teammates Lee Sung-jin and Yun Mi-jin she also set a new world record for the women&#x27;s team event over 216 arrows, the three scoring a combined total of 2,030 points from a maximum of 2,160. Because the ranking round took place prior to the opening ceremony, neither score was classified as a new Olympic record.

Park and Lee both advanced to the final of the women&#x27;s individual competition, where Park defeated her teammate by a score of 110–108 over twelve arrows to take the gold medal, South Korea&#x27;s sixth in the event. Park won her second gold two days later when she, Lee, and Yun outscored China by a single point in the final of the women&#x27;s team event to achieve their nation&#x27;s fifth consecutive gold medal in the discipline. As the designated final shooter in the team, Park was responsible for scoring the ten points on the last arrow required to win the match.

====2008 Summer Olympics====

Heading into the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Park was favoured to defend her Olympic titles. She and her teammate Yun Ok-hee were named as the favourites to take the women&#x27;s individual gold medal, and the South Korean team were highly tipped to retain their women&#x27;s team title for a sixth consecutive Olympic Games. Park began by scoring 673 points in the ranking round for the women&#x27;s individual event, concluding the round in first place and equalling the existing Olympic record set by Ukraine&#x27;s Lina Herasymenko at the 1996 Summer Olympics. With a combined tally of 2,004 points, Park, Yun, and Joo Hyun-jung also achieved a new Olympic record for the women&#x27;s team event. The trio went on to defeat Italy, France, and China in succession to take a sixth successive Olympic title in the women&#x27;s team competition.

Park was also successful in progressing to her second Olympic women&#x27;s individual final. Her opponent was China&#x27;s Zhang Juanjuan, who had finished the ranking round in twenty-seventh position and had earlier eliminated Park&#x27;s teammates Yun and Joo en route to the gold medal match. The match marked the third time the pair had met in an Olympic final after contesting the last two finals of the women&#x27;s team event. In a close match Zhang defeated Park one point, becoming the first archer from outside South Korea to win the women&#x27;s individual title in twenty-four years and breaking what was then the sixth-longest Olympic winning streak. In a press conference following the match Park expressed disappointment about failing to maintain South Korea&#x27;s winning record, but spoke of her silver medal result giving her the motivation and drive to seek further gold medals. She also felt that her loss would lighten the pressure placed on Korean archers to see victory as the only acceptable result in future competitions. Speaking about her defeat in 2016, Park reflected that she &quot;was maybe too greedy about getting the gold medal. I ended up not being careful enough with my actions.&quot;

===World Championships===
Park contested every edition of the biennial World Archery Championships from 2001 to 2007, winning a medal in each of her four appearances. She became the women&#x27;s recurve world champion at the age of eighteen in 2001, and with teammates Yun Mi-jin and Lee Hyun-jung dominated the women&#x27;s individual event at the 2003 Championships in New York City. Having finished the ranking round in the top three positions, Park, Yun, and Lee all advanced to the medal matches, where Park lost to Yun in the final to finish with the silver medal as runner-up.

Park was joined by Lee Sung-jin and Lee Tuk-young for the 2005 Championships in Madrid. The South Korean team was dominant once more, winning the gold medal in all four recurve competitions for the first time since 1997. Park, Lee, and Lee retained the women&#x27;s team title with victory over Ukraine, though a semi-final loss to Lee Sung-jin eliminated Park from gold medal contention in women&#x27;s individual event. Park later defeated Natalia Valeeva of Italy to win the bronze medal. The 2007 Championships in Leipzig saw Park contribute to South Korea&#x27;s third consecutive women&#x27;s team title with Lee Tuk-young and Choi Eun-young.

===Asian Games===
Park competed at the 2002 Asian Games, where she won a gold medal in the team event. At the 2006 Asian Games in Doha Park achieved two gold medals. Her first came in the women&#x27;s individual event, where she defeated compatriot Yun Ok-hee in the final to claim her first individual title at the Games. Park&#x27;s second gold medal was won in the women&#x27;s team event where she, Yun, and Yun Mi-jin defeated China to win a third consecutive title for South Korea, setting a new Asian Games record for a 24-arrow match in the process. Afterwards Park said she felt greater satisfaction in winning the team event and expressed joy that the tournament was over in light of the pressure placed upon the South Korean team.

==Records==
At the 2004 Summer Olympics Park set a new world record for the women&#x27;s 72-arrow round with 682 points from a maximum of 720. Her score would remain unbroken for almost eleven years before her compatriot Ki Bo-bae scored 686 points during the Summer Universiade in July 2015. At the 2008 Olympics Park scored an Olympic-record 115 points from a possible 120 for the 12-arrow match, a tally matched hours later by Zhang Juanjuan, her eventual opponent in the gold medal match.

Park was the first recurve archer to break the 1,400-point barrier in the 144-arrow round after posting a total of 1,405 points in October 2004. She remained the only archer to achieve this feat for almost fifteen years before compatriot Ryoo Su Jung scored 1,400 points at a national tournament in South Korea in July 2019.

<text>Marcus LeMarr Allen (born March 26, 1960) is an American former professional football running back who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 16 seasons, primarily with the Los Angeles Raiders. Considered one of the greatest goal line and short-yard runners in NFL history, he was selected 10th overall by the Raiders in the 1982 NFL draft, following a successful college football career with the USC Trojans. He was a member of the Raiders for 11 seasons and spent his last five seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs.

During his professional career, Allen ran for 12,243 yards and caught 587 passes for 5,412 yards. He also scored 145 touchdowns, including a then-league-record 123 rushing touchdowns, and was elected to six Pro Bowls. While with the Raiders, he helped the team win Super Bowl XVIII. He was the first NFL player to gain more than 10,000 rushing yards and 5,000 receiving yards during his career. Allen has the distinction of being the only player to have won the Heisman Trophy, named Unanimous All-American, won an AFCA National Championship Trophy, the Super Bowl, and be named NFL MVP and Super Bowl MVP. He was inducted to the College Football Hall of Fame in 2000, the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2003, and the International Sports Hall of Fame in 2021.

==Early life==
Allen played football at Abraham Lincoln High School in San Diego, California, where he played the quarterback and safety positions. Watching Allen in the 1977 CIF Title game against Kearny High School, one saw the emergence of a superstar. Allen led the Lincoln team to a 34–6 victory, scoring five touchdowns, including one after intercepting a pass. Allen rushed for 195 yards. Allen won the Cal-Hi Sports Mr. Football, awarded to California&#x27;s best high school football player, in 1977.

==College career==
Allen played running back at the University of Southern California (USC) from 1978 to 1981, playing on the same team as fellow hall of famer Ronnie Lott for his first three seasons and hall of famer Anthony Munoz for his first two. He was recruited as a safety, but head coach John Robinson switched him to tailback. As a freshman in 1978, Allen was a member of the Trojans&#x27; National Championship team (as recognized by the coaches poll), playing as a backup to eventual Heisman Trophy winning running back Charles White.

In 1979, he was moved to fullback, recording 879 yards from scrimmage. Eventually, in 1980, Allen became the starter at tailback and rushed for 1,563 yards, the third-most in the nation that year (behind George Rogers of S. Carolina – 1,781 yards and Herschel Walker of Georgia – 1,616). In 1981, Allen rushed for 2,342 yards, becoming only the second player in NCAA history to rush for over 2,000 yards in one season, passing the 2,000-yard mark in a win at Cal. He also gained a total of 2,683 offensive yards, led the nation in scoring, and won the Heisman Trophy, the Maxwell Award, and Walter Camp Award. He was also the Pac-10 Player of the Year. Allen shares the NCAA record for most 200-yard rushing games with Ricky Williams and Ron Dayne, each completing the feat twelve times.

Allen finished his four college seasons with 4,664 rushing yards, 5,232 total yards, and 46 touchdowns, while averaging 5.2 yards per carry.

USC has retired his jersey No. 33.

==Professional career==

Allen was drafted as the 10th overall pick in the 1982 NFL draft by the Los Angeles Raiders. Allen was pleased that he didn&#x27;t have to travel as the team had just relocated from Oakland. Allen has recalled that shortly before being drafted the Raiders asked him his weight (he answered 200 or 212) and then drafted him soon after. Though his rookie season was shortened by a league strike, Allen rushed for 697 yards and led the Raiders to the best record in the AFC at 8–1. He was voted the NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year. The Raiders lost to the New York Jets in the AFC Divisional Playoffs.

The next season, Allen broke the 1,000-yard mark for the first time, an accomplishment he would repeat the two following years. During the 1985 season, he rushed for 1,759 yards and scored 11 touchdowns on 380 carries, leading the Raiders to a 12–4 record and the AFC West Division Championship. In addition, Allen was named the NFL MVP.

In Super Bowl XVIII on January 22, 1984, Allen ran for 191 yards, caught two passes for 18 yards, and scored two touchdowns in the Raiders&#x27; 38–9 victory over the Washington Redskins. Included in his stats was a 74-yard touchdown run, a feat that remained the longest run in Super Bowl history until Willie Parker&#x27;s 75-yard run in Super Bowl XL. Allen&#x27;s 191 rushing yards were also a Super Bowl record, which stood until Timmy Smith of the Redskins topped it with 204 yards in Super Bowl XXII. Upon winning the game, Allen joined a small group of players to win both the Heisman Trophy and Super Bowl MVP (Roger Staubach, Jim Plunkett, and later Desmond Howard). In total, Allen rushed 58 times for 466 yards and four touchdowns during the playoffs. He also added 118 yards and one touchdown on 14 receptions.
Allen ended the 1985 season on a strong note, finishing the year as the NFL rushing leader with 9 consecutive 100-yard games.

From 1987 through 1990, Allen shared the backfield with Bo Jackson. Initially, Allen was commended for his gracious nature and team spirit for sharing the spotlight during the prime of his career. In later seasons with the Raiders, Allen had a stormy relationship with owner Al Davis stemming from a contract dispute; Davis referred to Allen as a &quot;cancer to the team.&quot; He also missed most of the 1989 season with a knee injury. Allen was relegated to back-up duty in his final three seasons with the Raiders and, at one time, fell to fourth on the depth chart. Allen&#x27;s strained relationship with Davis reached an all-time low in December 1992. During halftime of the Raiders-Dolphins game on Monday Night Football, a taped interview between Al Michaels and Allen was broadcast in which Allen said that Davis &quot;told me he was going to get me&quot;, adding, &quot;I think he [Davis] tried to ruin the latter part of my career, tried to devalue me. He&#x27;s trying to stop me from going to the Hall of Fame. They don&#x27;t want me to play.&quot;

Allen eventually left Los Angeles and joined the Kansas City Chiefs in 1993. Although he only rushed for 764 yards that year, he scored 12 touchdowns, leading the AFC, as he and Joe Montana led the Chiefs to the AFC Championship Game. Allen scored touchdowns in all three Chiefs playoff games that year, and was named the NFL Comeback Player of the Year by the Pro Football Writers Association. With the retirement of Eric Dickerson in 1993, Allen became the active leader in career rushing yards, a position he maintained until being passed by Barry Sanders in Game 1 of 1997. Allen went on to play for the Chiefs for four more seasons, leading the team in rushing every year but his last.

Allen retired after the 1997 season. In 1999, he was ranked 72nd on &quot;The Sporting News&quot;&#x27; list of the 100 Greatest Football Players. Allen was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2003. Allen was also inducted into the California Sports Hall of Fame in 2007.

In 1999, Allen was also inducted into the San Diego Hall of Champions Breitbard Hall of Fame.

In 2008, Allen joined as a spokesman for the sports website OPENSports.com, the brainchild of Mike Levy, founder and former CEO of CBS Sportsline.com. Allen wrote a blog and occasionally answered member questions for the company during this time.

==Personal life==

In 1986, Allen met Kathryn Eickstaedt and the two later got engaged. They married in 1993 at O.J. Simpson&#x27;s Rockingham estate, since Allen was friends with Simpson. Allen played the role of Rick Lambert in the sitcom &quot;1st &amp; Ten&quot; with Simpson in the mid-80&#x27;s. Allen and Eickstaedt&#x27;s engagement was mentioned in Faye Resnick&#x27;s book, &quot;Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted&quot;, which was published during Simpson&#x27;s murder trial. Resnick claimed Nicole Brown Simpson was having an affair with Allen, and Eickstaedt was aware of Allen&#x27;s womanizing ways, and if she knew of the affair, she would have to call off the wedding. Sports agent Mike Gilbert (who had represented both Allen and Simpson) and actress Robin Greer both also claimed in &quot;O.J.: Made in America&quot; that Simpson and Allen had had a romantic relationship. Allen and Eickstaedt were summoned to testify in the trial but fought the subpoena as they wanted to stay out of it. The couple divorced in 2001.

Allen is the older brother of Canadian Football Hall of Fame quarterback Damon Allen.
