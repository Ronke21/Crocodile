<text>Harry Enns (November 30, 1931 – June 24, 2010) was a Manitoba politician. He served as a Cabinet Minister in the governments of Dufferin Roblin, Walter Weir, Sterling Lyon and Gary Filmon, and was an unsuccessful candidate for the leadership of the Progressive Conservative Party of Manitoba in 1971. A long-serving member of the Manitoba legislature, he retired from public life in 2003.

The son of Reverend John Herman Enns, a minister for the First Mennonite Church, and Agathe Unruh, Enns was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and worked as a rancher before entering politics. He was married to Eleanor Jones. His brother Siegfried John Enns served in the Canadian House of Commons.

==Legislative career==
A Progressive Conservative, Enns was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in 1966, for the rural riding of Rockwood-Iberville.

In 1969, redistribution placed Enns in the riding of Lakeside, where he defeated Liberal leader Robert Bend by about 350 votes. However, he would never face another election nearly that close, and was reelected in 1973, 1977, 1981, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1995 and 1999. He held the seat for 34 years; his predecessor, former Premier of Manitoba Douglas Campbell, had held it for 47 years.

==Career as cabinet minister==
Enns was appointed Minister of Agriculture by Dufferin Roblin on July 22, 1967. He retained this position when Walter Weir replaced Roblin as Premier later in the year, also becoming the Acting Minister of Highways (Enns had supported Weir in the party&#x27;s leadership contest). On September 5, 1968, he was moved to the Ministry of Mines and Natural Resources.

Enns found himself at the centre of a significant controversy in early 1969, when he announced that the Manitoba government would allow Manitoba Hydro to flood South Indian Lake in the northern part of the province. This announcement was widely criticized, as the plan threatened serious disruption for indigenous communities in the area. Some critics argued that the plan itself was unviable, while others argued that the government did not adequately consult with the affected communities. The Manitoba Indian Brotherhood came out in opposition to the scheme, as did the Liberals and New Democrats, and the planned flooding became a significant issue in the 1969 provincial election.

In the government of Sterling Lyon, Enns served as Minister of Public Works and Minister of Highways from October 24, 1977 to October 20, 1978; Minister of Highways and Transport (a renamed position) from October 20, 1978 to November 15, 1979; Minister of Government Services from April 12, 1979 to January 16, 1981; and Minister of Natural Resources from January 16, 1981 to November 30, 1981. He was not a candidate to succeed Lyon as party leader in 1983, however.

Enns was not named to Gary Filmon&#x27;s first cabinet, but became Minister of Natural Resources on April 21, 1989. He held this position until September 10, 1993, when he became Minister of Agriculture for a second time (after a gap of twenty-five years). He continued to hold this portfolio until the Filmon government was defeated in 1999, and was responsible for managing the AIDA and NISA files during the flood emergency of 1997.

==Intraparty activity==
In 1971, Enns declared himself a candidate to replace Weir as leader of the Manitoba Progressive Conservatives. The contest highlighted the ideological divisions of the party: Enns, who represented its rural and conservative wing, lost to urban progressive Sidney Spivak by 46 votes.

In 2000, he supported Stockwell Day for the leadership of the Canadian Alliance party.

==Politics and controversies==
In 1976, Enns nearly derailed plans by the Schreyer government to bring a series of Russian artworks from Leningrad&#x27;s Hermitage and the State Russian Museum to Manitoba, during a North American tour. His position was grounded in an opposition to Communism and the Soviet Union, though he eventually withdrew his objections.

During the mid-1980s, Enns was a vocal opponent of officially re-entrenching French-language services in Manitoba (a policy being pursued by the New Democratic government of Howard Pawley). Ironically, his seat was targeted by the anti-bilingualism Confederation of Regions Party in 1986, although this challenge ultimately came to very little.

A philosophical conservative, Enns was also responsible for weakening market board control over Manitoba&#x27;s hog farms, and appears to have had similar intentions regarding its fishing industry. In 1995-96, he was accused of approving illegal fishing activities by the Spirit River Fish Company, though he denied this charge.

Perhaps his greatest contribution to Canada, was the role he played in the legalizing of industrial hemp. At a time when the public mood was anti cannabis, Harry was the first politician of power, to stand and risk his reputation, in order to help Manitoba farmers.
The three experimental hemp plot trials he sanctioned in 1995, 1996, and 1997 yielded key information that convinced Health Canada to allow hemp crops to go to seed, which birthed the hemp food industry.

== Later life ==
Enns died following heart surgery at the age of 78.

<text>Route 2 is a major provincial highway in the Canadian province of New Brunswick, carrying the main route of the Trans-Canada Highway in the province. The highway connects with Autoroute 85 at the border with Quebec, Highway 104 at the border with Nova Scotia, as well as with traffic from Interstate 95 in the U.S. state of Maine via the short Route 95 connector. A core route in the National Highway System, Route 2 is a four-lane freeway in its entirety, and directly serves the cities of Edmundston, Fredericton, and Moncton.

A 20-year project to replace the original 1960s-era two-lane Trans-Canada Highway with a four-lane freeway was completed on November 1, 2007. The final upgrade to Route 2 and Route 95 extended the continuous freeway network of North America east to New Glasgow, Nova Scotia. Once Autoroute 85 in Quebec is completed, Route 2 will also connect with the freeway networks of Central Canada without passing through the United States.

==Route description==
 As a provincial portion of the Trans-Canada, the highway&#x27;s western terminus is at the interprovincial boundary with Quebec 15 km north of Edmundston. It follows the lower section of the Madawaska River valley and enters the Saint John River valley where it passes north of Edmundston, running several kilometres inland from the east bank of the Saint John River, crossing the Rivière Verte as it continues past Saint-Léonard.

At Grand Falls, the highway crosses to the west bank of the river and passes by Perth-Andover, Florenceville, and Hartland. At Woodstock the Saint John River turns east and the highway continues to parallel the river on a ridge several kilometres inland along the western bank. It passes south of Fredericton and Oromocto before crossing the northeastern edge of CFB Gagetown.

The Saint John River turns south near Jemseg where the highway crosses the river on the Saint John River High Level Crossing and continues east over the Jemseg River using the Jemseg River Bridge.

The highway leaves the river valleys as it continues east across the rolling hills south of Grand Lake and passes by Havelock, River Glade and Salisbury.

The highway passes north and east of Moncton and Dieppe before turning south and passing by Memramcook, Sackville, and Aulac before reaching the eastern terminus at the interprovincial boundary with Nova Scotia at the Missaguash River.

==History==

Route 2 was once part of an interprovincial &quot;Highway 2&quot; running from Windsor, Ontario to Halifax, Nova Scotia. It was one of the initial routes defined in 1927, running from Quebec as a continuation of Quebec Route 2 via Edmundston, Grand Falls, Woodstock, Fredericton, Saint John and Moncton, After a short crossing of the New Brunswick Panhandle alongside the Madawaska River to Edmundston, Route 2 closely followed the Saint John River all the way to Saint John, crossing three times - from the east to the west at Grand Falls, back to the east at Perth-Andover, and back to the west at Hartland (on the Hartland Covered Bridge). The road on the east side of the river between Edmundston and Grand Falls had just been opened in about 1926; previously travelers had to pass through Maine (US 1, SR 165, and Boundary Road) on the west side. A Route 2A cut the distance between Fredericton and Saint John via a poorer-quality but more direct road, intersecting Route 2 at Oromocto and Westfield. Beyond Saint John, Route 2 went northeast via Sussex to Moncton, and then turned southeast to cross the Nova Scotia border near Aulac and continue as Nova Scotia Trunk 2. The original course through Aulac to the Nova Scotia border is now bypassed, with the old interprovincial bridge over the Missaguash River now demolished. The original route between Quebec and Sussex is now approximately the River Valley Scenic Drive.

When the route of the Trans-Canada Highway was defined in about 1950, it did not follow Route 2 via Saint John between Fredericton and Sussex, but took the more direct Route 9. Through the late 1950s and 1960s, a number of bypasses and realignments, mostly two-lane, were built to improve Route 2 with federal Trans-Canada Highway funds. The first, built in the 1950s, was around Moncton, between southwest of Salisbury and Sackville. The old road through Moncton became Route 2A, then Route 6 in 1965, and is now Route 106.

Next was the bypass around Woodstock. The road from Route 42 (now Route 560) at Jacksonville northeast to Route 2 (now Route 103) at Somerville was Route 2B by the late 1950s; with the 1960 completion of the Hugh John Flemming Bridge, just upstream from the Hartland Covered Bridge, and the extension of Route 2B south from Jacksonville to Route 2 (now Route 165) south of Woodstock, Route 2B became a realignment of Route 2, with old Route 2 through Woodstock becoming Route 2A (renumbered Route 103 in 1965).

The initial bypass of Fredericton was also built in about 1960, including the 1959 Princess Margaret Bridge across the Saint John River, which replaced the Carleton Street Bridge for traffic to Route 8, 9, and Route 10. Traffic remaining on Route 2 to Saint John exited the bypass at what is now exit 7 for Route 7.

Route 2 was moved to be concurrent with the Trans-Canada Highway, absorbing Route 9, in the 1965 renumbering of several New Brunswick highways. The old alignment via Saint John, where it did not become Route 7 (which replaced Route 2A) or an extension of Route 1, was renumbered as the new Route 102 between Oromocto and Westfield.
The majority of road development in New Brunswick follows settlement patterns which pre-dated motor transport, thus most communities developed along navigable waterways or were served by railways. The development of controlled access expressways only began in the 1960s and only around the largest communities. The majority of early provincial highway improvements merely consisted of upgrading local roads.

Route 2 initially followed present-day Route 144 from the N.B.-Quebec interprovincial boundary to Edmundston and down the Saint John River Valley to Grand Falls. There, it crossed to the west bank of the Saint John River, and continued south to Florenceville where it crossed to the east bank to continue along present-day Route 130 to Hartland, then recrossed the river to the west bank which it followed present-day Routes 590, 165, and 102 to Fredericton in a southeast direction.

At Fredericton a controlled-access 4-lane section was built around the city, and the highway crossed the Saint John River on the Princess Margaret Bridge to the east bank just south of the central business district. Following the river&#x27;s east bank just metres above its water level (frequently flooded in spring freshets), the route continued south to Jemseg where the highway turned east along the southeast shore of Grand Lake to Youngs Cove Road where the highway turned south to Coles Island and on to Sussex.

At Sussex the highway turned east again and passed by Three Rivers and then by Salisbury. East of Salisbury, Route 2 followed local roads over a series of low hills north of Moncton, cresting at Lutes Mountain, before descending and following a controlled access section bypassing the city and Dieppe, skirting the edge of the Memramcook River valley and on to Sackville, then Aulac, and finally the N.B.-N.S. inter-provincial boundary.

===Four-lane construction===
From the early upgrades of these local roads in the 1960s under Trans-Canada Highway funding (which became designated Route 2) until the mid-1980s, very little was done to improve New Brunswick highways (aside from some re-alignment of Route 2 west of Fredericton with the flooding created by the Mactaquac Dam construction in 1968), leading to significant deterioration of the Trans-Canada Highway in New Brunswick. By the mid-1980s Route 2 was a significant traffic hazard and a major embarrassment to the province.

The provincial government changed in 1987 with the election of Premier Frank McKenna who was focused on improving the province&#x27;s business climate. One of the government&#x27;s major tasks was to revamp provincial transportation infrastructure and McKenna entered into aggressive negotiations with the federal government of prime minister Brian Mulroney to secure federal funding of new highway projects. McKenna viewed Route 2 (the Trans-Canada Highway) and Route 1 in New Brunswick as being partially a federal responsibility since they funnelled the majority of Atlantic Canada&#x27;s highway traffic to the U.S. and central Canada. The signing of the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement in 1989, coupled with federal approval for numerous railway line abandonments in the Maritimes during the 1980s, led to predictions of further highway traffic growth on New Brunswick highways in the 1990s.

Under the remainder of the McKenna administration&#x27;s years of power (until 1997), Route 2 saw significant upgrading to become a 4-lane expressway on heavily-travelled portions of the highway between the N.B.-N.S. inter-provincial boundary and Penobsquis (east of Sussex). Other isolated sections were also upgraded south of Grand Lake and between Edmundston and St. Leonard, as well as at Woodstock where an interchange connected to Interstate 95.

===Major re-alignments===

Despite the upgrades, the uncontrolled-access sections of Route 2 were still a significant traffic hazard. Intensive lobbying from other provincial governments in the Atlantic provinces, as well as various trucking companies and business and transportation interests, asked that Route 2 be further upgraded. Unfortunately provincial finances could not handle the relatively large price tag required, even with the federal funding at the time.

====Fredericton–Moncton Highway====
As a result, the final years of the McKenna administration saw a significant realignment of Route 2 proposed, running from Longs Creek, west of Fredericton, bypassing it and Oromocto to the west, and continuing southeast to Jemseg, where it would cross the Saint John River and connect with an existing four-lane section south of Grand Lake. From there the highway would again depart from its original alignment (which headed south to Sussex) and instead head due east to meet the existing Route 2 alignment at River Glade, east of Three Rivers.

 of new, four-lane, controlled-access expressway would be privately financed and built, with the builder charging tolls for a 25-year period before the provincial government would gain control of the highway. In the late 1990s, an agreement was signed with a private consortium called &quot;Maritime Road Development Corporation&quot; (led by former provincial Liberal leader and former federal Minister of Transport Douglas Young) to build the new Route 2 alignment at an estimated cost of $1 billion (CAD).

The toll issue was not without controversy as it, along with several other issues, led to the downfall of McKenna&#x27;s successor, Camille Thériault, in 1999 to PC leader Bernard Lord. The highway was built, but tolls were removed from most portions of the highway before they opened. This portion of the privately built realignment of the Trans-Canada Highway has a hidden toll calculated by sensors in the pavement. The toll is instead charged to the provincial government, thus motorists do not directly pay for their highway usage. Along with a payment worth millions of dollars to get out of the original contract, the provincial government now makes all provincial taxpayers cover the cost of the highway when the original plan had been for a user-pay system under a toll structure.

The new alignment of the Trans-Canada Highway opened in fall 2001 and at this time the portion of the old Route 2 alignment which ran between Sussex and River Glade was re-designated as part of Route 1, extending the eastern terminus of that highway approximately . The re-alignment also had the effect of shortening the total length of Route 2 in the province by approximately . Other re-designations included a section between Youngs Cove and Sussex which became part of Route 10, a section between Youngs Cove and Fredericton became part of Route 105, and section across the Princess Margaret Bridge and Fredericton bypass became part of Route 8.

The re-alignment and construction of Route 2 between Longs Creek and River Glade catapulted New Brunswick highways forward by decades virtually overnight. The road was designed with medians, extensive wildlife fencing and underpasses, rumble strips along emergency breakdown lanes, paved emergency U-turn areas, sensors beneath the asphalt for monitoring truck weights as well as local weather and road surface conditions, extensive guard rails and reflectors, as well as two major bridges: the Saint John River High Level Crossing and the nearby Jemseg River Bridge.

With the completion of the new alignment, it was now possible to travel from Fredericton into Nova Scotia (and on to Halifax or New Glasgow) completely on a four-lane controlled access highway.

The Fredericton-Moncton section was officially opened to traffic at 10am on October 24, 2001, five weeks ahead of schedule.

====Fredericton––Grand Falls====
The high quality of construction of the new Route 2 alignment and improvement in the provincial highway system was not unnoticed by the new government of premier Bernard Lord. Throughout 2000–2003, several small four-lane controlled access sections on Route 2 between Fredericton and Edmundston were opened, most requiring construction of a new alignment.

During this same period, negotiations were undertaken with the federal government to secure funding to complete the last, and one of the most costly parts of the new construction—a gap between Woodstock and Grand Falls over the Appalachian Mountains (bypassing present-day Routes 165, 103 and 130), and a gap between Longs Creek and Pokiok (bypassing present-day Route 102), west of Fredericton.

In August, 2003 a joint announcement was made by Premier Lord and Prime Minister Jean Chrétien for a $400 million (CAD) agreement to complete upgrades to the last remaining non-controlled access section of Route 2.

The Pokiok-Longs Creek section had been independently contracted by the provincial government and opened in November 2006. However, the provincial government sought to construct the remaining gap as part of a complete &quot;design-build-finance-operate-maintain-rehabilitate&quot; plan which would see large private sector consortia bid for the right to design and construct the 98 km of new highway for Route 2, as well as to operate the entire section of Route 2 between Longs Creek, where it abuts the hidden-toll highway section built and operated by Maritime Road Development Corporation, and the Quebec–New Brunswick border as well as all of Route 95.

The winning consortium was &quot;Brun-Way Group&quot;, a joint venture by Atcon Construction and SNC-Lavalin. Brun-Way Group has two subsidiaries, Brun-Way Construction Inc., which received the ~$540 million to complete the 98 km of new construction as well as selected upgrades to other sections of Route 2 between Longs Creek and the Quebec border, and Brun-Way Highway Operations Inc., which will receive an annual payment from the government of New Brunswick until 2033 to operate and maintain this section of the highway. This agreement will place fully 85% of the maintenance of Route 2 and 100% of Route 95 in the hands of the consortia Brun-Way and MRDC.

The construction of the last segment of four-lane Route 2 was completed by Brun-Way on November 1, 2007. This construction saw a completely new alignment built north of Woodstock, staying several kilometres inland from the Saint John River&#x27;s west bank, and paralleling the Canada–United States border north to Grand Falls, where it crosses to the east bank of the river and connects with existing four-lane upgrades to Route 2 through to the Quebec boundary. In addition to upgrades to Route 2, Brun-Way is also contracted to perform similar upgrades to Route 95, a short connecting route between the Trans-Canada Highway at Woodstock and the Canada U.S. border at Houlton where it meets Interstate 95.

Upon the opening of this section to traffic on November 1, 2007, the entire length of Route 2 and Route 95 are four-lane controlled-access freeways with a posted speed limit of 110 km/h (70 mph) and a design speed of up to 120 km/h (75 mph).

===Highway of Heroes===
On August 12, 2012 Highway 2 was officially named &quot;Highway of Heroes&quot; by Premier David Alward.

<text>Solomon Sibley (October 7, 1769 – April 4, 1846) was an American politician and jurist in the Michigan Territory who became the first mayor of Detroit.

==Early life: 1769–1815==
Sibley was born in Sutton, Massachusetts, the son of Ruth and Reuben Sibley. After completing preparatory studies, he graduated from the College of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations (now Brown University) at Providence in 1794. He studied law, was admitted to the Bar in 1795 and began a practice in Marietta, Ohio, which was then part of the Northwest Territory. He soon moved to Cincinnati and then moved again to Detroit, Michigan, in 1797, shortly after the British handed over the fort in 1796. When he arrived, Sibley was one of only two lawyers in Detroit. Being a pioneer lawyer was a physically challenging profession, often requiring long travel by horseback through wilderness over Indian trails in all types of weather to attend the territorial courts in Cincinnati, Marietta, or Chillicothe, Ohio.

In December 1798, Detroit elected a delegate to the legislature of the Northwest Territory. This, the first election in Michigan under United States control, was held in a Detroit tavern. Although Sibley was elected, his opponent, James May, claimed he had won by providing liquor for the voters. Despite the protestation, Sibley represented Wayne County in the first legislature of the Northwest Territory, commencing his term in January 1799.

Sibley was instrumental in passing the legislation in 1802 by which Detroit was incorporated as a town. Sibley was elected first as Chairman of the Board of Trustees, and then under the first city charter of 1806 as the first mayor of Detroit. In December of 1811, following the Battle of Tippecanoe, Sibley chaired a public meeting which drafted a memorial to the President and Congress, concerning the defenses of Michigan Territory. This memorial called on Congress to prioritize the defense of settlers over the protection of trade routes with Native Americans. After the start of the War of 1812, forts were established at the sites recommended by Sibley. During the war, Sibley commanded a company of riflemen in defense of Detroit, though the British attack was successful and William Hull surrendered the fort. After the war, Sibley served as Auditor of Public Accounts for the Michigan Territory from 1814 to 1817.

==Congressional delegate: 1815–1823==
Sibley was appointed as the first United States Attorney for the Michigan Territory by U.S. President James Madison, serving from 1815 to 1823. When William Woodbridge resigned on August 9, 1820, as territorial Delegate to the 16th United States Congress, Sibley was elected to fill the vacancy. Sibley won re-election to the 17th Congress, serving in total from November 20, 1820, to March 3, 1823. Sibley continued to serve as U.S. Attorney, and thus held concurrent legislative and executive positions. During this period, Sibley was also commissioned, along with Lewis Cass, to negotiate the August 29, 1821, Treaty of Chicago with the Ottawa, Potawatomi, and Chippewa, in which the tribes ceded most of their territory south of the Grand River.

==Michigan Supreme Court: 1824–1837==
Sibley was not a candidate for re-election to Congress in 1822. In 1824, he was appointed as one of three justices on the Michigan Territorial Supreme Court by U.S. President James Monroe, becoming the sixth Territorial Justice. Sibley was chief justice of the court from 1827 until 1837, when he had to resign due to his deafness.

==Retirement and personal life: 1837–1846==
Sibley married Sarah Whipple Sproat Sibley (1782–1851), the only daughter of Colonel Ebenezer Sproat, a veteran of the American Revolutionary War. They had eight children, one of whom, Henry Hastings Sibley (b. 1811), was a territorial delegate from Wisconsin Territory 1848–1849, and from Minnesota Territory 1849–1853, and the first Governor of Minnesota 1858–1860. A second son, Alexander H. Sibley (b. 1817), was the president of the Silver Islet Mining Company which operated a silver mine in Ontario. A daughter, Catherine Whipple Sibley, married Charles Christopher Trowbridge, mayor of Detroit in 1834 and unsuccessful candidate for Governor of Michigan in 1837.

Sibley died in Detroit and is interred in Elmwood Cemetery there. Upon his death, many members of the Bar wore a badge of mourning for 30 days. Shortly after his death, his widow Sarah built the Sibley House on Jefferson, which still stands.

<text>The United States District Court for the District of South Carolina (in case citations, D.S.C.) is the federal district court whose jurisdiction is the state of South Carolina. Court is held in the cities of Aiken, Anderson, Beaufort, Charleston, Columbia, Florence, Greenville, and Spartanburg.

Appeals from the District of South Carolina are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

The United States attorney for the District of South Carolina represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. , the acting United States attorney is Brook B. Andrews.

== History ==
The District of South Carolina was one of the original 13 courts established by the Judiciary Act of 1789, , on September 24, 1789. It was subdivided into the &quot;United States District Court for the Eastern District of South Carolina&quot; and the &quot;United States District Court for the Western District of South Carolina&quot; Districts on February 21, 1823, by . The Eastern District was headquartered at Florence, and the Western District was headquartered in Greenville. The division was solely for the purposes of holding court – a single judge presided over both districts, and the act authorized no additional court staff.

In 1898 the United States Supreme Court held in &quot;Barrett v. United States&quot; that South Carolina legally constituted a single judicial district. Congress made another effort to subdivide the District on March 3, 1911, by and . South Carolina was again split into Eastern and the Western Districts, with one judgeship authorized to serve both districts, effective January 1, 1912. Congress finally authorized an additional judgeship for the Western District, and assigned the sitting judge exclusively to the Eastern District, on March 3, 1915, by . However, on October 7, 1965, by , South Carolina was reorganized as a single judicial district with four judgeships authorized for the district court. It has since remained a single District.

<doc id="915549" wikidata="Q455484" url="?curid=915549" title="Areva">
<text>Areva S.A. was a French multinational group specializing in nuclear power, active between 2001 and 2018. It was headquartered in Courbevoie, France. Before its 2016 corporate restructuring, Areva was majority-owned by the French state through the French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission (54.37%), Banque publique d&#x27;investissement (3.32%), and Agence des participations de l&#x27;État (28.83%). Électricité de France, in which the French government has a majority ownership stake, owned 2.24%; Kuwait Investment Authority owned 4.82% as the second largest shareholder after the French state.

As a part of the restructuring program following its insolvency, Areva sold or discontinued its renewable energy businesses and sold its reactors subsidiary Areva NP (which has reverted to its original name, Framatome) to EDF. Its nuclear propulsion and research reactors subsidiary Areva TA (now TechnicAtome) was sold to the Agence des participations de l&#x27;État and its nuclear cycle business was reorganized into a separate company New Areva (becoming Orano). A new holding, Areva S.A., was also created to act as a hive-off vehicle for Areva&#x27;s ongoing “at-risk” activities, including the completion and delivery of the Olkiluoto 3 in Finland, execution of Areva&#x27;s remaining renewable energy projects, and finalization of the sale of Areva NP to EDF.

In 2017, the sale of Areva TA was finalized and in January 2018, so was that of Areva NP, while New Areva was rebranded Orano; these developments marked the end of the Areva group.

==History==
===Creation===

Areva was created on 3 April 2001 by the merger of Framatome (later: Areva NP, now: Framatome), Cogema (later: Areva NC, now: Orano Cycle) and Technicatome (later: Areva TA, now: Technicatome). It was based on the structure of its precursor, CEA-Industrie. Anne Lauvergeon became its first CEO. 

Jean-Pierre Raffarin, the former Prime Minister of France, announced the privatization of Areva in 2003, but it was postponed several times, the French government opting finally for the privatization of GDF and EDF. At the end of October 2005, French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin announced that he had suspended the privatization process.

In 2003, Areva secured a contract for the Olkiluoto 3 project, which foresaw construction of the third generation EPR-type pressurised water reactor. In 2004 a contracted fixed price was established as €3.2 billion. Construction started in 2005.

In 2004, Areva acquired Alstom&#x27;s transmission and distribution activities, which became Areva T&amp;D. It was sold back to Alstom and Schneider Electric in June 2010.

On 15 September 2005, Areva and Constellation Energy of Baltimore announced a joint venture called UniStar Nuclear to market the commercial EPR in the United States. The joint venture later became UniStar Nuclear Energy in 2007. In 2010, EDF acquired 100% of UniStar Nuclear Energy. However these plans failed to come to fruition, and in February 2015 Areva suspended the EPR Design Certification Application Review process at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

In 2006, Areva created its renewable energies business group. Creusot Forge and Creusot Mécanique merged into the Areva group, even though there were quality concerns over Creusot Forge&#x27;s work. In 2007, Areva purchased 51% of offshore wind turbine manufacturer Multibrid. Multibrid has been a start-up and German offshore wind pioneer, producing wind turbines in Bremerhaven. The innovative M5000 wind turbine has a compact medium speed drive train and carbon rotor blades. The patented air treatment to prevent corrosion was unique. The turbine was designed by aerodyn Energiesysteme GmbH. 
In 2015 the renewable unit of Areva changed into ADWEN GmbH.

In June 2010, Areva purchased the remaining 49% and formed Areva Wind. In February 2010, Areva bought Ausra, and renamed it Areva Solar.

In 2007, Areva purchased UraMin, which later became Areva Resources Southern Africa (now part of Orano).

In 2007, Areva started construction of the Flamanville 3 EPR reactor. In addition, in November 2007 Areva agreed to an €8 billion deal with the China Guangdong Nuclear Power Group to supply them with two EPRs for Taishan Nuclear Power Plant. Under the terms of the agreement, Areva also had to help operate the plant, including the reprocessing of spent fuel. Also in 2007, Areva and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries created a joint venture named Atmea to develop a 1,100 MWe Atmea-1 pressurised water reactor (Generation III reactor). In 2009, Siemens sold its remaining shares of Areva NP and Arvea NP became wholly owned by Areva. At the same year, Areva NP acquired 30% stake in the Mitsubishi Nuclear Fuel company.

On 6 May 2008, Areva announced that it would seek all necessary approvals to build an enrichment facility in Bonneville County, Idaho. The project was later cancelled. Also in 2008, Areva was awarded an operations contract to clean up the Sellafield nuclear reprocessing site as part of the Nuclear Management Partners consortium, made up of URS, Amec and Areva.

In June 2008, Areva reached an agreement with Kazatomprom to create a joint-venture Katco.

On 4 February 2009, Areva signed a memorandum to supply two to six nuclear reactors to the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited for the Jaitapur Nuclear Power Project in the Indian state of Maharashtra.

In March 2010, Areva indicated work was being done on a new type of burner reactor type capable of breaking down actinides created as a product of nuclear fission.

In 2011, Areva was listed on the Euronext stock exchange in Paris.

===Post-Fukushima problems===

In December 2011, Areva suspended building work at several sites in France, Africa and the United States, one day after forecasting a €1.6 billion ($2.1 billion) loss.
Areva halted &quot;capacity extensions&quot; at its La Hague Reprocessing Plant, in northern France, at its Melox factory in the southwest, and at two sites attached to its Tricastin power plant in the south. Work has also stopped on extensions to uranium mines in Bakouma in the Central African Republic, Trekkopje in Namibia, and Ryst Kuil in South Africa, and caused a potential delay in construction until a capital solution is secured for the Eagle Rock Enrichment Facility in the United States. Areva wrote off most of the $2.5 billion purchase cost of Canadian uranium mining company Uramin, purchased in 2007, after concluding that its uranium ore deposits were of negligible value.

In September 2014 Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s stated it might downgrade Areva&#x27;s credit rating following weak first-half results, leading to Areva indicating it would cut capital spending and dispose of some assets. In March 2015 Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s further downgraded Areva&#x27;s credit rating to BB− after Areva posted a €4.8 billion loss for 2014.

In 2012, Areva acquired the hydrogen technology developer &quot;Compagnie européenne des technologies de l&#x27;hydrogène&quot; (CETH) and renamed it Areva H2Gen. In the same year, it inaugurated a hydrogen storage system called the MYRTE platform near Ajaccio, Corsica (MYRTE is the French acronym for &quot;Mission Hydrogène Renouvelable pour l’intégration au réseau électrique&quot;). The system aims to establish the feasibility of a storage solution for solar energy using hydrogen technologies, which would serve as a back-up system to stabilize Corsica&#x27;s power grid. In 2014, Areva&#x27;s energy storage and management system, the Greenergy Box, was added to the existing installation, in operation since early 2013. In January 2014, Areva and Spain&#x27;s wind turbine manufacturer Gamesa Corporación Tecnológica created on the basis of Areva Wind a joint venture Adwen. In August 2014, Areva exited the solar industry.

In October 2013, Areva won a $2.7 billion contract to supply two EPR nuclear reactors with nuclear steam supply and control systems at the Hinkley Point C plant in Somerset, England. It will also provide uranium extraction and enrichment for the fuel fabrication stage.

In December 2013, Areva and China General Nuclear Power (CGN) agreed to a partnership in renewable energy, with a focus on offshore wind, biomass, concentrated solar power, and energy storage.

In October 2014, CEO Luc Oursel took a leave of absence for health reasons. He died in December of the same year. On 20 November 2014 Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s downgraded Areva long-term debt to BB+ and short-term-debt to A-3.

In May 2014, Areva, through its subsidiary CETH2, and the ADEME (French Environment and Energy Management Agency), announced the creation of the AREVA H2-Gen joint venture.

In December 2015 operations at Le Creusot Forge were stopped following a discovery at the Flamanville Nuclear Power Plant. About 400 large steel forgings manufactured by Le Creusot Forge since 1965 found to have carbon-content irregularities that weakened the steel. A widespread programme of reactor checks was started involving a progressive programme of reactor shutdowns. This caused power price increases in Europe as France increased electricity imports, especially from Germany, to augment supply. In December 2016 international inspectors found evidence of recent doctored paperwork, which had not been detected by Areva&#x27;s independent quality control checks. In April 2017 Autorité de sûreté nucléaire (ASN) published the requirements for forging to resume at Le Creusot Forge. In August 2017 ASN published a draft decision requiring the examination of Le Creusot Forge manufacturing records of all components during scheduled reactor refuelling outages.

===Restructuring===
In June 2016 Areva&#x27;s restructuring plans were made public, including the sale of the majority of its reactor business to EDF in 2017, excluding the Olkiluoto 3 EPR under construction in Finland which will remain with Areva SA. In December 2017, Areva and EDF signed agreements on the transfer of Areva NP&#x27;s nuclear reactor operations. As part of the restructuring plan, Areva created a new fuel cycle company, dubbed as New Co or New Areva. The new company combined Areva Mines, Areva NC, Areva Projects, and Areva Business Support companies. It was created as a wholly owned subsidiary of Areva; however, Areva lost control over the company as the French government invested to recapitalize the company. On 23 January 2018 that company changed its name to Orano. In January 2017, Areva sold its stake in the wind turbine manufacturer Adwen. In March 2017, Areva sold its nuclear propulsion and research reactor subsidiary Areva TA to &quot;Agence des Participations de l&#x27;Etat&quot;.

==Current operations==

, Areva S.A. is responsible only for the liabilities related to the Olkiluoto 3 project. The reactor, which is one of the first of the new Generation III reactors, was initially expected to begin producing electricity in 2009, but project completion was delayed eventually until 2023, and it has faced several price increases. Areva and TVO have reached an agreement, according to which Areva would pay €450 million in compensation over the delays and lost income. The agreement would settle all legal actions between the two companies.

Areva also holds of 40% stake in Orano.

==Past operations==
Areva was a company with a presence in each industrial activity linked to nuclear energy: mining, chemistry, enrichment, fuel assembly, reprocessing, engineering, nuclear propulsion and reactors, treatment, recycling, stabilization and dismantling. Areva also offered technological solutions for renewable energy. Areva&#x27;s activities were divided into five business groups.

===Nuclear operations===
The mining business group managed the exploration of uranium ore, its extraction, and processing, as well as the restoration of sites after mine closure. It had staff on five continents and operated uranium production sites in Canada, Kazakhstan, and Niger. As of the end of 2013, the Mining Business Group employed 4,463 people. Uranium production accounted for 19% of Areva&#x27;s consolidated revenue in 2013. It is now part of Orano.

The front end business group provided access to fuel for Areva&#x27;s customers, and oversees operations to convert uranium into nuclear fuel, including the chemical conversion of ore into uranium hexafluoride, the enrichment of uranium, and the design and production of fuel for nuclear reactors. As of the end of 2013, 8,555 people worked for Areva&#x27;s front end business group. It accounted for 24% of Areva&#x27;s consolidated revenue in 2013. It is now part of Orano.

The reactors and services business group designed and built pressurized water reactors and boiling water reactors, and offers products to service nuclear reactors. It is now part of Framatome. The business group also designed and built naval propulsion and research reactors, which is now Technicatome. The business group had 15,592  employees at the end of 2013 and generated 36% of Areva&#x27;s revenue in the same year.

The back end business group developed recycling solutions for used fuel for reuse in reactors. It also offered storage and transportation solutions for radioactive material, and site rehabilitation at nuclear facilities. It is now part of Orano. At the end of 2013, it had 11,583 employees and made up for 19% of Areva&#x27;s revenue. In 2017 the NUHOMS Matrix advanced used nuclear fuel storage overpack, a high-density system for storing multiple spent fuel rods in canisters, was launched.

===Renewable energy operations===
Areva created its global renewable energies business group in 2006 as an expansion of its clean energy portfolio with renewable energy. This group represented four business lines: concentrated solar power, offshore wind power, biomass power, and hydrogen power storage and distribution. Areva built biomass power plants worldwide, representing 2.5 GWe of installed capacity. These plants are located in Brazil, Chile, Germany, the Netherlands, India and Thailand. Its subsidiary Areva Renewables Brazil built biomass power plants based on bagasse (organic waste from sugar cane). In the United States, Areva formed a partnership with Duke Energy to build and operate 55 MW biomass power plants based on wood waste.

Areva acquired a bio-coal production technology called Thermya, which produces a biofuel issued from biomass torrefaction that can replace coal to generate thermal energy and electricity. Areva also developed AdCub, a modular concept for compact power plants targeting small-scale biomass resources that addresses relatively untapped growth opportunities in Europe. The objective is to combine innovative solutions which optimize customer costs for small-scale power plants (between 3 and 6 MW) and reduce construction time. This new biomass plant concept also aims to improve upstream technologies for multi-fuel acceptance and higher availability.

Areva designed, manufactured and industrialized turnkey energy storage solutions and products to generate electricity with fuel cells and produce hydrogen by electrolysis. Areva supported research in the hydrogen field through partnerships with a number of industrial companies and national research organizations including &quot;Agence Nationale de la Recherche&quot;, the Horizon Hydrogen Energy (H2E) program, PAN-H (&quot;Plan d&#x27;Action National sur l&#x27;Hydrogène et les piles à combustible&quot;) and Pôle Capenergies, an innovation cluster dedicated to the development of renewable forms of energy without greenhouse gas emissions.

===Other operations===
Areva was involved in military technology, such as designing the nuclear reactor for the French Barracuda class submarine. One of Areva&#x27;s subsidiaries, Euriware (founded in 1991) was specialized in consulting and IT services and employs 2,200 people. Areva also owned 1.99% of Safran and 1.4% of Suez Environnement.

CERCA, a subsidiary of Areva that produces fuel for research reactors, was also involved in TRIGA, a research reactor established in 1996 with the US firm General Atomics that is used for training, research, and the production of radioisotopes.

Areva was a former corporate member of the Bruegel think tank.

==Notable incidents==
===2007 fine===
In January 2007, Areva was fined €53 million by the European Commission for rigging EU electricity markets through a cartel involving 11 companies, including ABB, Alstom, Fuji, Hitachi Japan, AE Power Systems, Mitsubishi Electric Corp, Schneider Electric, Siemens, Toshiba and VA Tech ELIN. According to the commission, &quot;between 1988 and 2004, the companies rigged bids for procurement contracts, fixed prices, allocated projects to each other, shared markets and exchanged commercially important and confidential information.&quot;

Areva is not accused of any cartel involvement other than through the acquisition of an Alstom unit in January 2004. &quot;This subsidiary was acquired by the Areva group towards the end of the infringement, in January 2004. The parent entities of the Areva group share a joint liability with that subsidiary for the period after its acquisition.&quot; &quot;A few months before the cartel ended, Alstom sold the unit involved to Areva, which knew nothing of the cartel. It [Areva] and Alstom have joint liability for 53.6 million, which they must decide how to split.&quot;

EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes declared that &quot;The commission has put an end to a cartel which has cheated public utility companies and consumers for more than 16 years&quot;.

=== Libya deal ===
On 13 August 2007, the French newspaper &quot;Le Parisien&quot; alleged that the Franco-Libyan civil nuclear power agreement signed by President Nicolas Sarkozy did not concern desalinization of sea water, as claimed by the French government, but instead focused in particular on selling the EPR to Libya, a contract potentially worth $3 billion. &quot;Le Parisien&quot; cited Philippe Delaune, deputy to the deputy director of international affairs for the CEA atomic agency, which is the main share-holder in Areva. Following allegations that the deal had been related to the release of the Bulgarian nurses, the French Socialist Party, through the spokesperson Jean-Louis Bianco, declared that this deal was &quot;geopolitically irresponsible&quot;. The German government also denounced the agreement.

===Bakouma assault===
On 24 June 2012, an armed group assaulted a uranium plant operated by Areva at Bakouma in the southeast of the Central African Republic. A statement by the military described that &quot;a violent clash on Sunday afternoon pitted&quot; Central African troops against &quot;an unidentified group of armed men attempting to launch an assault on the site of mining company Areva&quot;.

According to the report the army successfully repelled the attack, but &quot;the enemy did some material damage and pulled back while taking a sizeable quantity mainly of food with them.&quot; The Areva group issued no immediate statement regarding the attack. Central African military sources believe that the attack was organized by members of the Chadian rebel group Popular Front for Recovery (FPR) led by &#x27;General&#x27; Baba Ladde, which has been active in the region since 2008. The army says it is conducting further operations to neutralize the remaining armed rebels in the region of Bakouma.

===Attack in Niger===
In May 2013, the company&#x27;s uranium mine in Niger was damaged and one civilian was killed in an Al-Qaeda-linked suicide bomb attack. The mine reached full production again in August 2013.

===Tuareg people===
In November 2009, Greenpeace released a report indicating that two villages near Areva&#x27;s mining operations in Niger had dangerously high levels of radiation.

In January 2014, Al Jazeera produced &quot;Orphans of the Sahara&quot;, three-part series on the Tuareg people of the Sahara desert, in which claims were brought to light that Areva mining and consequent irradiations are causing diseases and deaths among their people.

Al Jazeera also published Areva&#x27;s response, in which the company said it submits regular reports on its environmental monitoring of water, air and soil to the Nigerien Office of Environmental Assessments and Impact Studies (BEEEI) which indicate that there is no pollution around the sites in question.

==Corporate issues==
===Sport sponsorship===
Areva sponsored several sporting events over the years. In 2009, Areva launched Athlenergy.com, an online resource for runners, and became the sponsor of the French Athletics Federation and the official sponsor of Meeting Areva, a track and field competition held annually at the Stade de France in Saint-Denis, France. In May 2014, Athlenergy.com became Arevarun. Areva also sponsors several running events, including the Paris Half Marathon and Saintélyon, a night run from Sainte Etienne to Lyon, in France.

In 2008, Areva signed a contract to sponsor the German football club FC Nürnberg until 2012. The contract was completed in 2012.

Areva sponsored the French &quot;Defi Areva&quot; team in the 2002 America&#x27;s Cup race, and the French &quot;Areva Challenge&quot; team in the 2007 America&#x27;s Cup race. In 2002, during its first public appearance, in Lorient, France, the &quot;Defi Areva&quot; yacht collided with a dinghy carrying four Greenpeace protesters, and the impact knocked a hole in the side of the 80-foot boat.

<text>Carl Gottfried Neumann (also Karl; 7 May 1832 – 27 March 1925) was a German mathematical physicist and professor at several German universities. His work focused on applications of potential theory to physics and mathematics. He contributed to the mathematical formalization of electrodynamics and analytical mechanics. Neumann boundary conditions and the Neumann series are named after him. 

== Biography ==
Carl Gottfried Neumann was born in Königsberg, Prussia, as one of the four children of the mineralogist, physicist and mathematician Franz Ernst Neumann (1798–1895), who was professor of mineralogy and physics at the University of Königsberg. His mother Luise Florentine Hagen (born 1800) was the sister-in-law of mathematician Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel. Carl Neumann is brother of Ernst Christian Neumann, a German physician.

Carl Neumann studied primary, secondary and university studies in Königsberg. He attended many physics and mathematics seminars organized by his father, including a famous seminar by Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi of 1834. His doctoral thesis of 1856 was supervised by mathematician Friedrich Julius Richelot and focused on the application of the theory of hyperelliptic integrals to classical mechanics.

Two years later, he wrote his habilitation in the University Halle on the mathematical treatment of the Faraday effect, supervised by mathematician Eduard Heine. This work earned him the position of lecturer (&quot;Privatdozent&quot;) and in 1863 was appointed as extraordinary (&quot;ausserordentlicher&quot;) professor at the University of Halle. The same year he was promoted to full professorship at the University of Basel where he stayed for two years. He then was appointed professor at the University of Tübingen for three years, and in 1868 to the Leipzig University. The same year, together with Alfred Clebsch, Neumann founded the mathematical research journal &quot;Mathematische Annalen&quot;.

In Leipzig, he became acquainted with Jacobi&#x27;s work on mechanics, which inspired his work. Wilhelm Eduard Weber described Neumann&#x27;s professorship at Leipzig as for &quot;higher mechanics, which essentially encompasses mathematical physics,&quot; and his lectures did so. 

Neumann&#x27;s wife died in 1876 and Neumann retired from the Leipzig University in 1911. He died in Leipzig in 1925.

=== Electrodynamics ===
Neuman&#x27;s work on electrodynamics was focused on formalizing mathematically the theories of electrodynamics. However for a long time, Neumann&#x27;s supported Weber electrodynamics over Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

Neumann&#x27;s research on electrodynamics started in the 1860s. He published three first majors works on electrodynamics in 1868 and 1873 and 1874. His work was stimulated by the work of his father and Wilhelm Eduard Weber. He rederived Ampère&#x27;s force law and Ampère&#x27;s circuital law from his own formalism. He also derived Weber law in terms of retarded potentials, avoiding problems with action at a distance. 

Hermann von Helmholtz criticized Weber electrodynamics, including Neumann&#x27;s work, for violating of the conservation of energy in the presence of velocity-dependent forces. This criticism started a debate between Neumann and Helmholtz. Neumann attempted to modify Weber&#x27;s law by introducing an electric potential that was inversely proportional to the distance at long distances and different at short distances in analogy with the theory of capillary action and the luminiferous aether. Helmholtz theory based on James Clerk Maxwell&#x27;s theory did not need these assumptions, but Helmholtz found himself unable to convince his peers at the time over one theory or the other. Due to the lack of experiments to settle the matter, Neumann&#x27;s temporarily abandoned electrodynamics in the 1880s.

In 1893, he returned to his electrodynamics research. He analyzed the mathematical similarity between fluid dynamics and electrodynamics, relating several common theorems. He also proposed that electrodynamics and thermodynamics could not be explained in terms of purely mechanical theories. Neumann remained critical of the works of Helmholtz and Heinrich Hertz on Maxwell&#x27;s electrodynamics, but appreciated their action principles. 

In 1901-1904, Neumann&#x27;s finally discussed Maxwell&#x27;s theory and praised the extension given by Hertz relating electrodynamics to the theory of thermal conduction. However Neumann worked on possible transformations of Maxwell&#x27;s equations and was worried of the equations not being invariant for different reference frames. He also argued that for Newtonian mechanics to make sense there should exist an imovable object in the universe called the body Alpha, from which all speeds can be measure relative to it. The problems of reference frames was solved in 1905 by Albert Einstein&#x27;s special relativity.

=== Mathematics ===
Neumann has a series of publications on the Dirichlet problem. In 1861, Neumann solved the Dirichlet problem in a plane in using a logarithmic potential, a term that he coined. This work was extended in 1870 to solve a more general Dirichlet problem by introducing his method of the arithmetic mean. Due to his work on the Dirichlet principle of potential theory, Neumann might be considered one of the initiators of the theory of integral equations. The Neumann series, which is analogous to the geometric series
:formula_1

but for infinite matrices or for bounded operators, is named after him. The Neumann boundary condition for certain types of ordinary and partial differential equations is named after him.

In 1865, he wrote &quot;Vorlesungen über Riemanns Theorie der Abelschen Integrale&quot; on abelian integrals. This book popularized Bernhard Riemann’s work on multivalued functions among mathematicians.

== Awards and honors ==
Neumann was elected a member of the Göttingen Academy of Sciences in 1864 and became a foreign member of that Society 1868. He also was elected member of the Prussian Academy of Sciences of Berlin in 1893, member of the Bavarian Academy of Sciences of Munich in 1895, and full member of the Mathematical-Physical Class of the Saxon Academy of Sciences in 1919.

In 1897, as his father before, Neumann obtained the Pour le Mérite, a Prussian Order of Merit.

Several objects developed later in mathematics are named after his Neumann problem including the Neumann–Neumann methods and the Neumann–Poincaré operator by Henri Poincaré.

<text>The &#x27;Maggie&#x27; (U.S. title: High and Dry; also known as Highland Fling) is a 1954 British comedy film directed by Alexander Mackendrick and starring Paul Douglas, Alex Mackenzie and James Copeland. It was written by William Rose and produced by Ealing Studios. It is a story of a clash of cultures between a hard-driving American businessman and a wily Scottish Clyde puffer captain.

The story was inspired by Neil Munro&#x27;s short stories of the &quot;Vital Spark&quot; and her captain, Para Handy.

==Plot==
The &quot;Maggie&quot; is an aged Clyde puffer, a small, coal fired cargo boat. Peter MacTaggart, her rascal of a captain, is in dire need of £300 to repair the boat&#x27;s plates and renew its loading licence. At the offices of a shipping company in Glasgow, he overhears Mr Pusey, an Englishman complete with bowler hat and umbrella, trying to arrange transportation of some personal items of furniture for his boss, American Calvin B. Marshall. The reputable shipping company has nothing immediately available, so MacTaggart gets the job when Pusey mistakenly believes that he works for the company and that the more modern vessel docked next to the &quot;Maggie&quot; is MacTaggart&#x27;s.

Marshall is a wealthy industrialist, a stubborn and determined self-made man. When he eventually learns the truth, he sets out in pursuit by aeroplane and hired car. Catching up with the puffer, he puts Pusey on board to ensure the cargo is transferred to another boat. Pusey is no match for the captain and ends up in jail on a charge of poaching, after pushing the Laird in the canal. Marshall realizes that he will have to handle the matter personally. After another costly chase, he boards the boat himself to hasten the cargo transfer. The route and timing of the voyage however, are governed by MacTaggart, tidal variations, fog and local community priorities.

Marshall&#x27;s hostile attitude gradually softens somewhat. He is particularly touched by the loyalty of the &quot;wee boy&quot;, Dougie, to his captain. At one point, when Marshall threatens to buy the boat from the owner, MacTaggart&#x27;s sister, and sell it for scrap, Dougie releases a folding table on him, knocking him unconscious. His mood changes again when the wily MacTaggart moors the puffer under a wooden jetty; as the tide rises, the jetty (due for dismantling anyway) is damaged, making it impossible to transfer the furniture to the deeper draught vessel when it arrives.

At one of the unscheduled stops, the crew attend the hundredth birthday party of an islander, and Marshall chats with a nineteen-year-old girl who is pondering her future. She has two suitors, an up-and-coming, ambitious store owner and a poor fisherman. The American advises her to choose the former, but she believes she will marry the latter, explaining that he will give her his time, rather than just things. This strikes a chord with Marshall. He is having marital difficulties, and the furniture is an attempt to patch things up with his wife.

As they finally near their destination, the engine fails. Marshall uses his engineering knowledge to repair the old, poorly maintained machinery. The engine fires up but only serves to drive the &quot;Maggie&quot; onto some rocks. Marshall asks MacTaggart if they can save her by jettisoning the cargo. MacTaggart then apologetically informs him that he neglected to insure the furniture, but Marshall orders it thrown overboard anyway. The &quot;Maggie&quot; is saved.

At journey&#x27;s end, Marshall, with some prodding by Dougie, even allows MacTaggart to keep the money he so desperately needs. In appreciation of his magnanimity, MacTaggart renames the puffer the &quot;Calvin B. Marshall&quot;.

==Production==

The &quot;Maggie&quot; was played by two J.J. Hay boats in the film, the &quot;Boer&quot; and the &quot;Inca&quot;. Much of the film was shot on location at Crinan and Islay. The film uses real place names as far as the Crinan Canal, then switches to fictional placenames once they get through it (apart from Oban, Applecross and Portree). The film&#x27;s working title was &quot;Highland Fling&quot;, during filming in the summer of 1953, but was changed to &quot;The Maggie&quot; before its release in early 1954.

==Reception==

=== Box office ===
According to &quot;Kinematograph Weekly&quot; the film was a &quot;money maker&quot; at the British box office in 1954.

=== Critical ===
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote: &quot;&quot;The Maggie&quot; is a small, charming film which concentrates most of its attention on the character of its Scottish sailors. Here the director has been very successful in capturing the particular mixture of canniness and humour, petty deceitfulness and honesty. The performances of the Scottish players are wonderfully vivid: Alex Mackenzie plays MacTaggart with great assurance and quiet humour, and the boy actor Tommy Kearins gives a beautifully sincere performance, real and touching. William Rose&#x27;s script provides some ingeniously contrived escapades, has, on the whole, excellent dialogue, but allows the pace to fall off a little in the final sequences. ... &quot;The Maggie&quot;, while retaining the verve and sympathies of &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; (Mackendrick&#x27;s first film, with a similar setting and theme), is more firmly directed, and marks a welcome return to form among Ealing comedies.&quot;

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;The yarn has been subtly writen as a piece of gentle and casual humor. The pace is always leisurely, and the background of Scottish lakes and mountains provides an appropriate backcloth to the story. The picture has been directed without any attempt to force the pace. Fine camera work highlights the natural scenery.. ... General technical credits are up to standard although a little more scissoring in later stages would be an asset.&quot;

In &quot;British Sound Films: The Studio Years 1928–1959&quot; David Quinlan rated the film as &quot;average&quot;, writing: &quot;Warm, whimsical comedy, occasionally very funny.&quot;

Leslie Halliwell said: &quot;Mildly amusing comedy about the wily Scots; not the studio at its best, but pretty fair.&quot;

&quot;The Radio Times Guide to Films&quot; gave the film 4/5 stars, writing: &quot;Ostensibly, this most underestimated of Ealing comedies is a whimsical story about a crew of canny Clydebankers giving a brash American a torrid time after being assigned to carry his property aboard their clapped-out steamer. Don&#x27;t be fooled, however, by the leisurely pace, the gentle humour and the relatively good-natured conclusion. This is a wicked little satire on the mutual contempt that underlies Euro-American relations, and few could have handled it with such incisive insight as American-born Scot Alexander Mackendrick. Cruel rather than quaint.&quot;

In 1963 Colin McArthur criticised its representation of Scotland and its relationship with American capital, and of the failure of contemporary commentators to interrogate the narrative about the Scotland it constructed.

==Home video==
Issued in the UK on VHS in 2002, a DVD followed in 2006 and was included alongside three other films in &quot;The Definitive Ealing Studios Collection: Volume Four&quot;. A digitally-restored version was issued on Blu-ray and DVD in 2015, which contains subtitles and extra features. &quot;The Maggie&quot; was released in the US on 10 March 2020 as part of an Ealing Comedy double feature entitled &quot;Whisky Galore! &amp; The Maggie: Two Films by Alexander Mackendrick&quot;.

<text>In mathematics, Property B is a certain set theoretic property. Formally, given a finite set &quot;X&quot;, a collection &quot;C&quot; of subsets of &quot;X&quot; has Property B if we can partition &quot;X&quot; into two disjoint subsets &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; such that every set in &quot;C&quot; meets both &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot;. 

The property gets its name from mathematician Felix Bernstein, who first introduced the property in 1908.

Property B is equivalent to 2-coloring the hypergraph described by the collection &quot;C&quot;. A hypergraph with property B is also called 2-colorable. Sometimes it is also called bipartite, by analogy to the bipartite graphs.
Property B is often studied for uniform hypergraphs (set systems in which all subsets of the system have the same cardinality) but it has also been considered in the non-uniform case.

The problem of checking whether a collection &quot;C&quot; has Property B is called the set splitting problem.

== Smallest set-families without property B ==

The smallest number of sets in a collection of sets of size &quot;n&quot; such that &quot;C&quot; does not have Property B is denoted by &quot;m&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).

=== Known values of m(n) ===
It is known that &quot;m&quot;(1) = 1, &quot;m&quot;(2) = 3, &quot;m&quot;(3) = 7 (as can by seen by the following examples), and &quot;m&quot;(4) = 23 (Östergård), although finding this result was the result of an exhaustive search. An upper bound of 23 (Seymour, Toft) and a lower bound of 21 (Manning) have been proven. At the time of this writing (March 2017), there is no OEIS entry for the sequence &quot;m&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) yet, due to the lack of terms known.

; &quot;m&quot;(1)
: For &quot;n&quot; = 1, set &quot;X&quot; = {1}, and &quot;C&quot; = . Then C does not have Property B.

; &quot;m&quot;(2) 
: For &quot;n&quot; = 2, set &quot;X&quot; = {1, 2, 3} and &quot;C&quot; = (a triangle). Then C does not have Property B, so &quot;m&quot;(2) &lt;= 3. However, &quot;C&quot;&#x27; = does (set &quot;Y&quot; = {1} and &quot;Z&quot; = {2, 3}), so &quot;m&quot;(2) &gt;= 3.

One may check all other collections of 6 3-sets to see that all have Property B.

; &quot;m&quot;(4)

=== Asymptotics of &quot;m&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) ===
Erdős (1963) proved that for any collection of fewer than formula_1 sets of size &quot;n&quot;, there exists a 2-coloring in which all set are bichromatic. The proof is simple: Consider a random coloring. The probability that an arbitrary set is monochromatic is formula_2. By a union bound, the probability that there exist a monochromatic set is less than formula_3. Therefore, there exists a good coloring.

Erdős (1964) showed the existence of an &quot;n&quot;-uniform hypergraph with formula_4 hyperedges which does not have property B (i.e., does not have a 2-coloring in which all hyperedges are bichromatic), establishing an upper bound. 

Schmidt (1963) proved that every collection of at most formula_5 sets of size &quot;n&quot; has property B. Erdős and Lovász conjectured that formula_6. Beck in 1978 improved the lower bound to formula_7, where formula_8 is an arbitrary small positive number. In 2000, Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan improved the lower bound to formula_9. They used a clever probabilistic algorithm.

<text>The Vital Spark is the best known name associated with Clyde puffer boats, having been used in the fictional works created by Scottish writer Neil Munro. Several Clyde puffers were used in televised versions of Munro&#x27;s stories and subsequently for purposes such as events and tourism. As the numbers of surviving puffers diminished the boats &quot;Auld Reekie&quot; and &quot;Eilean Eisdeal&quot; were both portrayed as &quot;Vital Spark&quot;.

==Background==
Puffers seem to have been regarded fondly even before Munro began publishing his short stories in the &quot;Glasgow Evening News&quot; in 1905. This may not be surprising, for these small steamboats were then providing a vital supply link around the west coast of Scotland and Hebrides. The charming rascality of the stories went well beyond the reality of a commercial shipping business, but they brought widespread fame. They appeared in the newspaper over 20 years, were collected in book form by 1931, inspired the 1953 film &quot;The Maggie&quot;, and came out as three popular television series, dating from 1959 to 1995.

==Description==

In her captain&#x27;s own (islands accented) words, the &quot;Vital Spark&quot; is &quot;aal hold, with the boiler behind, four men and a derrick, and a watter-butt and a pan loaf in the foc&#x27;sle&quot;. The way these &quot;steam lighters&quot; with their steam-powered derricks could offload at any suitable beach or small pier is featured in many &quot;Vital Spark&quot; stories, and allows amusing escapades in the small west coast communities. The cargoes carried in the hold vary from gravel or coal to furniture to livestock, the crew&#x27;s quarters in the forecastle are taken as lodgings by holidaymakers or lost children and the steam engine struggles on under the dour care of the engineer Macphail. Tales are recounted of improbably dramatic missions in World War I. Others scoff at her as a &quot;coal gaabbert&quot;, reflecting the origins of the puffers, but an indignant Para Handy is always ready to defend his boat, comparing her speed and her looks with the glamorous Clyde steamers. As its captain, the redoubtable Para Handy, often says: &quot;the smertest boat in the coastin&#x27; tred&quot;.

==TV series featuring &quot;Vital Spark&quot;==
The original BBC Series &quot;Para Handy - Master Mariner&quot;, which ran from 1959–60, starred Duncan Macrae (Para Handy), Roddy McMillan (The Mate), and John Grieve (Dan Macphail, the engineer). Six episodes were made, none of which survive.

In 1963 Macrae, McMillan and Grieve, accompanied by Alex Mackenzie and guitarist George Hill, recorded an album of songs, &quot;Highland Voyage&quot;. A short film was made to accompany the recording, filmed on board a puffer as it cruised around the Firth of Clyde. Macrae and McMillan appear as The Captain and The Mate, while Mackenzie appears as The Engineer, causing Grieve to move to play The Cook. Although very obviously based on Munro&#x27;s characters, the names of Para Handy, the &quot;Vital Spark&quot;, etc. are never mentioned, probably due to copyright issues.

In the second version, &quot;The Vital Spark&quot;, McMillan took the role of Para Handy, and Grieve reprised his role as Macphail; Walter Carr (Dougie the Mate) and Alex McAvoy (Sunny Jim) completed the crew, and the series ran for three series between 1965 and 1974. The third series, made several years after the first two, was in colour and consisted of remakes of selected earlier episodes.

In 1994 BBC Scotland produced &quot;The Tales of Para Handy&quot; which starred Gregor Fisher in the lead role alongside Sean Scanlan as Dougie, Andrew Fairlie as Sunny Jim and Rikki Fulton as Dan Macphail. This ran for two series, a total of nine episodes, in 1994 and 1995. The series also featured David Tennant in one of his first acting roles. Alex McAvoy, who played Sunny Jim in &quot;The Vital Spark&quot;, appears in one episode as a fellow captain of Para Handy in the coastal trade.

==Ships depicting &quot;Vital Spark&quot;==

The stories sparked considerable interest in the puffers, and many books explore their now vanished world. 

The Clyde puffer &quot;Gael&quot; was used as the &quot;Vital Spark&quot; in the series aired in 1959.

The puffer &quot;Saxon&quot;, owned by Walter Kerr was used to film the BBC&#x27;s 1965-6 television series &quot;Para Handy&quot;, then scrapped in 1967.

The puffer &quot;Skylight&quot; was used in the filming for the 1973 and 1974 BBC series. She was renamed &quot;Vital Spark&quot; for the filming, then returned to haulage renamed as Sitka. The vessel was saved from the breaker&#x27;s yard in 1977 when it was purchased by a couple from Gourock. The vessel&#x27;s steam engine was removed to the Maritime Museum in Irvine. From the early 1980s, the engineless boat was moored in Bowling, West Dunbartonshire but within a few years had been vandalised and fallen ito a bad state. There was interest around the potential for it becoming a tourist attraction from both Inverclyde and Bute, despite the cost that would be involved. The vessel was raised in 1987, with the intent for restoration.

The puffer &quot;Auld Reekie&quot; (VIC 27) was converted to appear as the &quot;Vital Spark&quot; at the Glasgow Garden Festival which was held in 1988. A community project had helped restore it. She then appeared as the &quot;Vital Spark&quot; in the BBC&#x27;s third television series, &quot;The Tales of Para Handy&quot;. By 2016, she was moored at Crinan awaiting restoration. A three-part BBC Alba television documentary series followed restoration efforts on the vessel.

The vessel &quot;VIC 72&quot; later sailed under the name &quot;Eldesa&quot;. She was purchased by Easdale&#x27;s laird Chris Nicholson to be used as a tourist attraction. After a £30,000 refit, she was launched in 1984 and renamed &quot;Eilean Eisdeal&quot;. It continued to operate as a commercial vessel until 1995. She was then on permanent loan to the Inveraray Maritime Museum. The vessel ventured from her home at the Inveraray Maritime Museum to visit the Glasgow River Festival in 2005 and 2006, bearing the name &quot;Vital Spark&quot;. In 2006 she was re-registered as the &quot;Vital Spark of Glasgow&quot;. In December 2007, as part of celebrations of the 150th anniversary since the first puffer was launched, the vessel returned to the Forth and Clyde Canal, to be moored at Bowling, West Dunbartonshire. The vessel was used by BBC for filming a programme about the original Vital Spark series. In 2023 it was having further refurbishment.

==In popular culture==

The Argyll brewer Fyne Ales, near Inveraray, where the current boat rests and Neil Munro was born, have since 2010 brewed a dark ale that they named Vital Spark in tribute to the series.

A sculpture of a Clyde puffer &quot;The Vital Spark&quot; by George Wyllie is displayed outside Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum.

<text>The United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island (in case citations, D.R.I.) is the federal district court whose jurisdiction is the state of Rhode Island. The District Court was created in 1790 when Rhode Island ratified the Constitution. The Federal Courthouse was built in 1908.

Appeals from the District of Rhode Island are taken to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

The United States attorney for the District of Rhode Island represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. the United States attorney is Zachary A. Cunha.

== Legislative history ==
The United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island was established on June 23, 1790, by . Congress authorized one judgeship for the Court, and assigned the district to the Eastern Circuit. On February 13, 1801, the outgoing lame duck Federalist-controlled Congress passed the controversial Judiciary Act of 1801 which reassigned the District of Rhode Island to the First Circuit.

The incoming Congress repealed the Judiciary Act of 1801, but in the Judiciary Act of 1802, Congress again assigned the District of Rhode Island to the First Circuit.

A second seat on the Court was created on March 18, 1966, by . A third seat was added on July 10, 1984, by .

<text>&quot;High and Dry&quot; and &quot;Planet Telex&quot; are songs by the English rock band Radiohead. They were released as a double A-side single from Radiohead&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995), on 27 February 1995 by Parlophone and Capitol Records.

&quot;High and Dry&quot; was recorded as a demo during the sessions of Radiohead&#x27;s first album, &quot;Pablo Honey&quot; (1993)&quot;,&quot; and remastered for inclusion on &quot;The Bends.&quot; It is credited as an influence on the bands Travis and Coldplay. &quot;Planet Telex&quot; developed from studio experimentation with drum loops. Two music videos were produced for &quot;High and Dry&quot;.

== &quot;High and Dry&quot; ==
The Radiohead songwriter, Thom Yorke, performed an early version of &quot;High and Dry&quot; with another band, Headless Chickens, while attending the University of Exeter in the late 1980s. He said the lyrics were about &quot;some loony girl I was going out with&quot;, but became &quot;mixed up with ideas about success and failure&quot;. 

In 1993, Radiohead recorded a demo at Courtyard Studios, Oxfordshire, with their live engineer, Jim Warren. They dismissed it as &quot;too Rod Stewart&quot;. The demo was rediscovered and remastered for inclusion on their second album, &quot;The Bends&quot; (1995). In 2006, Yorke said &quot;High and Dry&quot; was &quot;very bad&quot; and that Radiohead&#x27;s record label at the time, EMI, had pressured him to release it.

== &quot;Planet Telex&quot; ==
Radiohead wrote and recorded &quot;Planet Telex&quot; in a single session at RAK Studios while working on &quot;The Bends&quot;. It developed from experiments with a drum loop taken from another song, the B-side &quot;Killer Cars&quot;, to which Radiohead added piano processed with multiple delay effects. The band had recently returned from a restaurant, and Yorke recorded his vocals drunk, slumped in a corner. According to the producer, John Leckie, &quot;We had the whole thing down within a couple of hours, which was really refreshing and fun to do.&quot; The original title was &quot;Planet Xerox&quot;, but Radiohead were denied permission to use the Xerox trademark.

==Music videos==
The first music video for &quot;High and Dry&quot; featured Radiohead performing at the Vasquez Rocks outside Los Angeles. For the American market, Radiohead&#x27;s American record label, Capitol, commissioned a new video inspired by the 1994 film &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot;, set in a roadside diner. After MTV objected, the video was edited to remove a shot of an exploding car.

==Critical reception==
Pete Stanton from &quot;Smash Hits&quot; gave &quot;High and Dry&quot; four out of five, writing: &quot;It has a Suede-ish vibe to it, minus the whining, and is a mellow-but-not-boring track.&quot; In 2017, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; credited &quot;High and Dry&quot; and another &quot;Bends&quot; song, &quot;Fake Plastic Trees&quot;, for influencing the &quot;airbrushed&quot; post-Britpop of Coldplay and Travis. The &quot;Irish Times&quot; said that &quot;High and Dry&quot; had &quot;essentially invented Coldplay&quot;.

<doc id="915567" wikidata="Q2907709" url="?curid=915567" title="Bob Hoover">
<text>Robert Anderson Hoover (January 24, 1922 – October 25, 2016) was an American fighter pilot, test pilot, flight instructor, and record-setting air show aviator. 

Hoover flew Spitfires in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and was shot down in 1944 off the coast of France. He was held for over a year in a German POW camp before eventually escaping and flying to safety in a stolen enemy aircraft. He then worked as a United States Air Force and civilian test pilot after the war, flying chase for Chuck Yeager&#x27;s Bell X-1 supersonic flight in 1947, and as a flight instructor for North American Aviation during the Korean War.

He is best known as an air show display pilot, who flew for nearly 50 years until his retirement in 1999. Referred to as the &quot;pilot&#x27;s pilot&quot;, Hoover revolutionized modern aerobatic flying and has been described in many aviation circles as one of the greatest pilots of all time. He received the Distinguished Flying Cross and Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy, and was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1988 and Aerospace Walk of Honor in 1992, along with several other military and civilian awards and accolades. In 2013, &quot;Flying&quot; magazine ranked him 10th on its list of the 51 Heroes of Aviation.
== Aviation career ==
Hoover learned to fly at Berry Field in Nashville, Tennessee while working at a local grocery store to pay for the flight training. He enlisted in the Tennessee National Guard and was sent for pilot training with the United States Army. Assigned to the 98th Fighter Squadron, he was assigned to advanced training in Florida, flying P-40Ks, and was accidentally shot down by a fellow pilot over Mullet Key Bay, Florida, on November 9, 1942.

During World War II, Hoover was sent to Casablanca, where his first major assignment was flight testing the assembled aircraft ready for service. He was later assigned to the Supermarine Spitfire-equipped 52d Fighter Group in Sicily. On February 9, 1944, on his 59th mission, his malfunctioning Mark V Spitfire was shot down by Siegfried Lemke, a pilot of Jagdgeschwader 2 in a Focke-Wulf Fw 190 off the coast of Southern France, and he was taken prisoner. He spent 16 months at &quot;Stalag Luft 1&quot;, a German prisoner-of-war camp in Barth, Germany.

One night due to the conditions in the camp there was a riot and fight involving several thousand inmates and Hoover used this opportunity to scale the fence and escape, despite the fact that Dwight Eisenhower had issued the order for prisoners to no longer attempt to escape due to the rapid advance of the Allies. He was joined by two other POWs and together they made their way down a dirt road to a German farmhouse where a lone woman made the starving men some food. As they were leaving Hoover wrote a note for her to give to the American army in the coming weeks stating that she had assisted the three of them, and to treat her kindly. The woman also gave the trio a handgun with several extra magazines.

The men then obtained bicycles and rode for several miles before they came across a seemingly abandoned airfield. Hoover being a pilot began inspecting the planes but they all seemed damaged and incapable of flight. He eventually found a reconnaissance plane, a Focke-Wulf Fw 190, with some damage, but a full tank of fuel. A German mechanic stunned the trio sneaking up on them demanding they halt but almost immediately had a gun pointed at him as Hoover demanded he start the engine of the plane that he was investigating. With the engine started Hoover made the deal that since the aircraft only had room for one occupant that the other two POWs would keep the gun to aid in their escape. He did not even taxi towards the runway, simply hitting the throttle and heading straight out across a field to take off.

Hoover did not have a parachute and was in an enemy aircraft flying towards Allied lines knowing he would be an easy target for an American or British fighter pilot. He did not even have a means to tell whether he had safely reached Allied territory; he simply knew to look for the windmills of Holland and land when he saw them. After flying all the way across The Netherlands to the Zuider Zee he finally spotted windmills and landed in a field, at which point he was surrounded by angry Dutch farmers armed with pitchforks who were under the impression they had just captured a German. Eventually a British supply truck came by at which point Hoover was able to explain who he was.

After the war, he was assigned to flight-test duty at Wilbur Wright Field near Dayton, Ohio. There he impressed and befriended Chuck Yeager. When Yeager was later asked whom he wanted for flight crew for the supersonic Bell X-1 flight, the first flight to break the sound barrier, he named Hoover. Hoover became Yeager&#x27;s backup pilot in the Bell X-1 program and flew chase for Yeager in a Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star during the Mach 1 flight. He also flew chase for the 50th anniversary of the Mach 1 flight in a General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon.

Hoover left the air force for civilian jobs in 1948. After a brief time with the Allison Engine Company, he worked as a test/demonstration pilot with North American Aviation, in which capacity he went to Korea to teach pilots flying combat missions in the Korean War how to dive-bomb with the North American F-86 Sabre. During his six weeks in Korea, Hoover flew many combat bombing missions over enemy territory, but was denied permission to engage in air-to-air combat flights.

During the 1950s, Hoover visited many active-duty, reserve, and Air National Guard units to demonstrate the capabilities of various aircraft to their pilots. Hoover flew flight tests on the North American FJ-2 Fury, F-86 Sabre, and the North American F-100 Super Sabre.
In the early 1960s, Hoover began flying a North American P-51 Mustang at air shows around the country. The Hoover Mustang (registration &quot;N2251D&quot;) was purchased by North American Aviation from Dave Lindsay&#x27;s Cavalier Aircraft Corp. in 1962. A second Mustang (&quot;N51RH&quot;), later named &quot;Ole Yeller&quot;, was purchased by North American Rockwell from Cavalier in 1971 to replace the earlier aircraft, which had been destroyed in a ground accident when an oxygen bottle exploded after being overfilled. Hoover demonstrated the Mustang and later an Aero Commander at hundreds of air shows until his retirement in the 1990s. In 1997, Hoover sold &quot;Ole Yeller&quot; to his good friend John Bagley of Rexburg, Idaho. &quot;Ole Yeller&quot; still flies frequently and is based at the Legacy Flight Museum in Rexburg.

Hoover set transcontinental, time-to-climb, and speed records, and personally knew such great aviators as Orville Wright, Eddie Rickenbacker, Charles Lindbergh, Jimmy Doolittle, Chuck Yeager, Jacqueline Cochran, Neil Armstrong and Yuri Gagarin.

In 1969, Hoover was president of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots (SETP), and he had been a personal friend of Charles Lindbergh since the early 1950s, when the reclusive Lindbergh was using the pseudonym &quot;Mr Schwartz&quot;. Hoover persuaded Lindbergh to attend the SETP annual symposium and banquet at the Beverley Hilton, as his guest. At the top table, they were joined by Neil Armstrong, who had just been released from quarantine after the Apollo 11 mission. Hoover introduced both Lindbergh and Armstrong, to the surprise of the press and other attendees, and many photos were published of Hoover&#x27;s wife Colleen flanked by both &#x27;heroes&#x27; of aviation. The story of the occasion was later narrated by Hoover in the 2014 documentary film &quot;Flying the Feathered Edge: The Bob Hoover Project&quot;.
Hoover was best known for his civil air show career, which started when he was hired to demonstrate the capabilities of Aero Commander&#x27;s Shrike Commander, a twin piston-engine business aircraft that had developed a staid reputation due to its bulky shape. Hoover showed the strength of the aircraft as he put it through rolls, loops and other maneuvers, which most people would not associate with executive aircraft. As a grand finale, he would shut down both engines and execute a loop and an eight-point hesitation slow roll as he headed back to the runway. Upon landing he would touch down on one tire followed gradually by the other. After pulling off the runway, he would restart the engines to taxi back to the parking area. On airfields with large enough parking ramps, such as the Reno Stead Airport, where the Reno Air Races take place, Hoover would sometimes land directly on the ramp and coast all the way back to his parking spot in front of the grandstand without restarting the engines. 

He was also known for creating the stunt of successfully pouring a cup of tea while performing a 1G barrel roll.

== End of career ==
His air show aerobatics career ended in 1999, but was marked by issues with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) over his medical certification that began when Hoover&#x27;s medical certificate was revoked by the FAA in the early 1990s.

Shortly before his revocation, Hoover experienced serious engine problems in a North American T-28 Trojan off the coast of California. During his return to Torrance, California, he was able to keep the engine running intermittently by constantly manipulating the throttle, mixture, and propeller controls. The engine seized at the moment of touchdown. Hoover believed his successful management of this difficult emergency should have convinced the FAA that he hadn&#x27;t lost any ability. Meanwhile, Hoover was granted a pilot license and medical certificate by Australia&#x27;s aviation authority. Hoover&#x27;s United States medical certificate was restored shortly afterward and he returned to the American air show circuit for several years before retiring in 1999. At 77 years old Hoover still felt capable of performing and passed a FAA physical post-retirement, but he was unable to obtain insurance for air shows. Although he had had free insurance for several years as part of air show sponsorship deals, he was forced in 1999 to pay for it out of his own pocket and could not get coverage under $2 million. His final air show was on November 13, 1999, at Luke Air Force Base. His last flight in his famous Shrike Commander was on October 10, 2003, from Lakeland, Florida, to the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C., with long-time friend Steve Clegg.

Following Hoover&#x27;s retirement, his Shrike Commander was placed on display at the Steven F. Udvar-Hazy Center of the National Air and Space Museum, in Dulles, Virginia.

In 2007, Hoover was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

== Death ==
He died on October 25, 2016, near his home in Los Angeles at the age of 94 from heart failure.

A memorial service and celebration of life honoring Bob Hoover was held on November 18, 2016, hosted by aerobatic legend Sean D. Tucker and world renowned pilot Clay Lacy at the Van Nuys Airport in California. Nearly 1,500 family and friends attended the memorial, with speakers such as Hollywood actor and pilot Harrison Ford, film producer David Ellison, Jonna Doolittle (granddaughter of Jimmy Doolittle) and many others. The event culminated with a United States Air Force Honor Guard presenting an American flag to the family, coincident with a three-element fly-over. The lead element featured a Rockwell Sabreliner, similar to another aircraft that Hoover flew during air shows, along with two F-16 Fighting Falcons from the United States Air Force Thunderbirds aerobatic team and a Canadair CT-114 Tutor from the Royal Canadian Air Force Snowbirds aerobatic team. The second element featured the USAF Heritage Flight with a Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor and two F-86 Sabres, and the third and final installment featured a four-ship World War II warbird flight, with the P-51 &quot;Ole Yeller&quot; pulling up in the missing man formation on the final note of &quot;Taps&quot;.

== Honors and recognition ==

Hoover was considered one of the founding fathers of modern aerobatics and was described by General Jimmy Doolittle as &quot;the greatest stick-and-rudder man who ever lived&quot;. In the 2003 Centennial of Flight edition of &quot;Air &amp; Space/Smithsonian&quot;, he was named the third greatest aviator in history.

During his career, Hoover was awarded the following military medals: the Distinguished Flying Cross, the Soldier&#x27;s Medal for non-combat valor, the Air Medal with several oak leaf clusters, the Purple Heart and the French Croix de Guerre. He was also made an honorary member of the United States Navy aerobatic team the Blue Angels, the United States Air Force Thunderbirds, the Canadian Forces Snowbirds, the American Fighter Aces Association and the original Eagle Squadron, and received an Award of Merit from the American Fighter Pilots Association. He was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 1988 and to the Aerospace Walk of Honor in 1992.

Hoover received the Living Legends of Aviation Freedom of Flight Award in 2006, which was renamed the Bob Hoover Freedom of Flight Award the following year. In 2007, he received the Smithsonian&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum Trophy and was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

On May 18, 2010, Hoover delivered the 2010 Charles A. Lindbergh Memorial Lecture at the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. The U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School conferred an honorary doctorate on Hoover at the school&#x27;s December 2010 graduation ceremony. &quot;Flying&quot; magazine placed Hoover number 10 on its list of &quot;The 51 Heroes of Aviation&quot; in 2013.

On December 12, 2014, at the Aero Club of Washington&#x27;s 67th annual Wright Memorial Dinner, Hoover was awarded the National Aeronautic Association&#x27;s Wright Brothers Memorial Trophy.

The AOPA R.A. &quot;Bob&quot; Hoover Trophy is named in honor of him, and awarded to those who have demonstrated the airmanship, leadership, and passion that Hoover did during his career and life. The Bob Hoover Academy was also named after him, which was founded by Sean Tucker in 2017 and acts as a charitable education and aviation program for at-risk teens, largely backed by the local California school district and Harrison Ford.

On March 11, 2017, at the 2017 United States Air Force Academy Recognition Dinner, Hoover was announced as the Class Exemplar for the USAFA Class of 2020.

== &quot;Flying the Feathered Edge&quot; ==

Hoover&#x27;s decades of revolutionary flying formed the framework for the 2014 documentary film, &quot;Flying the Feathered Edge: The Bob Hoover Project&quot;, directed by Kim Furst, which centers around Hoover&#x27;s life and legacy. It was premiered at the EAA AirVenture Oshkosh convention in July 2014.

Harrison Ford and Sean Tucker frame the documentary about the aviation pioneer. The film begins with a tribute to Hoover&#x27;s flying skills by Neil Armstrong and features Burt Rutan, Dick Rutan, Carroll Shelby, Gene Cernan, Medal of Honor recipient Col. George E. &quot;Bud&quot; Day, Clay Lacy and Hoover himself, among others.

&quot;Flying the Feathered Edge&quot; was a three-year project and tells Hoover&#x27;s story from his first flying lessons before World War II to his combat and postwar careers as a test pilot and air show legend. Reporter Fred George&#x27;s review in the Aviation Week Network stated, &quot;After 90 minutes there were few dry eyes in the house as the credits rolled at the end of the documentary ... in Aviation Week&#x27;s opinion, a film well worth our reader&#x27;s viewing time when it appears in nearby theaters.&quot;

The official film premiere was held in August 2014 at the Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Providence, Rhode Island during the Rhode Island International Film Festival, winning the Grand Prize &quot;Soldiers and Sacrifice Award&quot;. The film received the Combs Gates Award from the National Aviation Hall of Fame in 2015 for &quot;excellence in preserving aerospace history&quot;.

== Hoover nozzle and Hoover ring ==
The &quot;Hoover nozzle&quot;, used on refueling equipment dispensing jet fuel, is designed with a flattened bell shape. It cannot be inserted in the filler neck of a gasoline-powered aircraft with the &quot;Hoover ring&quot; installed, thus preventing the tank from accidentally being filled with jet fuel.

This system was given this name following an accident in which Hoover was seriously injured, when both engines on his Shrike Commander failed during takeoff. Investigators found that the aircraft had just been fueled by line personnel who mistook the piston-engine Shrike for a similar turboprop model, filling the tanks with jet fuel instead of avgas (aviation gasoline). There was enough avgas in the fuel system for the aircraft to taxi to the runway and take off, but then the jet fuel was drawn into the engines, causing them to stop.

Once Hoover recovered, he widely promoted the use of the new type of nozzle with the support and funding of the National Air Transportation Association, the General Aviation Manufacturers Association and various other aviation groups. The nozzle is now required on jet fuel dispensing equipment in the United States by federal government regulation.

<text>Kargopol () is a town and the administrative center of Kargopolsky District in Arkhangelsk Oblast, Russia, located on both sides of the Onega River, several miles north of Lake Lacha, in the southwestern corner of the oblast. Population: 

==History==
It is not clear when Kargopol was founded, but, when first chronicled in 1146, it was a trade station of the Novgorod Republic and one of the most northerly permanent Slavic settlements. Although documentation for its early history is scarce, it is believed that Kargopol was the most significant trade center of Bjarmaland throughout the 13th and 14th centuries. In 1447, it was the place where Dmitry Shemyaka found refuge from Vasily II&#x27;s ire.

Situated on the ancient route between Moscow and Arkhangelsk (then the only Russian seaport), Kargopol became one of the most prosperous cities of Russia, especially after the Muscovy Company started to operate in the mid-16th century. During the Time of Troubles it withstood a siege by Polish and Lithuanian brigands. The peasant rebel Ivan Bolotnikov was executed in Kargopol in 1608.

After Russia regained access to the Baltic Sea and St. Petersburg was founded, Kargopol gradually faded to obscurity. However, the people of Kargopol were still active in the exploration of Asian Russia. Alexander Baranov, the first governor of Russian America (Alaska), was born in this town.

==Administrative and municipal status==
Within the framework of administrative divisions, Kargopol serves as the administrative center of Kargopolsky District. As an administrative division, it is incorporated within Kargopolsky District as the town of district significance of Kargopol. As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Kargopol, together with the village of Zazhigino in Pavlovsky Selsoviet of Kargopolsky District, are incorporated within Kargopolsky Municipal District as Kargopolskoye Urban Settlement.

==Economy==
===Industry===
Timber industry serves as the basis of the industry of Kargopolsky District. The linum production factory, which used to exist in Kargopol until the 1970s, is defunct.

===Transportation===
Kargopol is connected by a paved road with Nyandoma and further east the principal highway in the region, M8 connecting Moscow and Arkhangelsk.
There is a road to the north, which connects to M8 via Plesetsk and Brin-Navolok. This is the historic trading route which connected Kargopol with Arkhangelsk before the railroad was built and long stretches of this road are still unpaved. The stretch between Kargopol and Plesetsk was paved in 2011. Another unpaved road in the western direction crosses the border with the Republic of Karelia and heads to Pudozh.

There is no railroad in Kargopol, even though at the time of construction of the railway between Vologda and Arkhangelsk—a decision taken by Tsar Alexander III in June 1894—it was the biggest town in the region, and the railway was constructed through unpopulated areas. There is an urban legend stating that Kargopol merchants were unhappy with the prospective of the railway construction in Kargopol, thinking it would deteriorate the trade, and therefore requested the railway to be built in detour. As a matter of fact, the local governance body, the Kargopol Duma, in September 1894 twice discussed the issue, came to the conclusion that the railroad construction indeed would deteriorate the trade, but that if it does not pass Kargopol, the damage would be much stronger. Therefore, on both occasions, the Duma sent a petition requesting that the railway would be rerouted via Kargopol. This did not occur since the construction had already started in August 1894, and since the detour would have been too big, as Kargopol is not on a straight line connecting Vologda with Arkhangelsk.

The Onega is only navigable between Kargopol and Lake Lacha, since there are rapids downstream of Kargopol.

There is an airport in Kargopol, but since at least the early 1990s it has only been used for transporting cargo.

==Geography==
The town is located on both sides of the Onega River, several miles north of Lake Lacha, in the southwestern corner of the oblast.

===Climate===
==Culture and recreation==

Today, Kargopol is a sleepy historical town adjoining the Kenozersky National Park. It is best known in Russia for Kargopol toys (&quot;Kargopolskiye igrushki&quot;), which are small, simple clay figures painted in traditional style.

During its golden age in the 17th century, Kargopol became home to a highly localized brand of medieval Russian architecture. Quite a few wooden and white stone churches survive in the town and its vicinity. The earliest of these buildings is the black-domed Cathedral of the Nativity of Christ, built of dolomite by Novgorodians and consecrated in 1562. The interior features a curious iron hand sticking from the drum. A hallmark of Kargopol churches is delicate stone carving.

The Kargopol stone churches are classified as historical and architectural heritage and include:
*Cathedral of the Nativity of Christ (1552–1562) with the bell-tower (1766–1767)
*Resurrection Church (end of the 17th century)
*Church of the Nativity of Saint John the Baptist (1740–1751)
*Holy Trinity Church (1790–1802)
*Presentation Church (1803)
*an ensemble of three churches: the Annunciation Church (1692), the Saint Nicholas Church (1741), and the Church of the Nativity of the Theotokos (1678–1680)

Kargopol is classified as a historical town by the Ministry of Culture of Russian Federation, which implies certain restrictions on construction in the historical center.

The only state museum in the town is the Kargopol State Museum of History, Art, and Architecture, founded in 1919. This is a cloak organization, which not only holds ethnographic, art, and historic exhibits, but also protects some of the architectural monuments in Kargopol and surroundings. Fifteen buildings, including a number of churches, are museum property. There are also two private museums in Kargopol.

<text>Lake Lacha () is a freshwater lake, located in the south of Kargopolsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast in Russia, south of the town of Kargopol. It is the largest lake in Arkhangelsk Oblast, with a surface area of and a basin area of . Lake Lacha is the source of the Onega, one of the major waterways of the White Sea basin.

The etymological origin of the name is unclear.

The river basin of Lake Lacha includes the southern and western parts of Kargopolsky District of Arkhangelsk Oblast, as well as north-west of Vologda Oblast. In particular, it includes two of the biggest lakes of Arkhangelsk and Vologda Oblasts, Lake Vozhe and Lake Lyokshmozero. The southern part of the Kenozersky National Park also drains into Lake Lacha.

The stretch between Kargopol and the lake is navigable, however, neither the Svid upstream from the lake nor the Onega downstream are navigable because of the rapids. There are occasional recreational boat trips from Kargopol to the lake but no passenger or cargo navigation.

Several villages are located on or close to the banks, including Morshchikhinskaya, Tobolkino, and Filosofskaya. The latter pair are located on the road connecting Kargopol with Lipin Bor via Sovza. Another unpaved road runs from Kargopol along the right bank of the Onega to the lake and then to the village of Bolshaya Kondratovskaya, several kilometers from the lakeshore.

=== Las Vegas ===

The Lloyd D. George Federal District Courthouse is the home for the district court in Las Vegas. The building of the courthouse was completed in 2002 and was the first federal building built to comply with the post-Oklahoma City blast resistance requirements. Blast-resistance tests for the project were conducted at the Department of Defense’s Large Blast Thermal Simulator (LBTS) in White Sands, New Mexico to validate building performance under blast loads. The LBTS facility was designed, built, and equipped in the early 1990s to perform tests on structural models, vehicles, and components, subjected to simulated high pressures combined with high temperatures, as in a major blast.

On January 4, 2010, a single gunman, identified as Johnny Lee Wicks, aged 66, went inside the lobby of the courthouse and opened fire, fatally wounding Special Deputy U.S. Marshal Stanley Cooper who was on duty as a Court Security Officer. Wicks was killed by return fire from other security officers and U.S. Marshals. The Entry Rotunda is named in the Honor of Deputy Cooper and the City of Las Vegas named a street near the court in his honor as well. 

Senators Harry Reid and John Ensign, both of whom had offices in the courthouse building, were not present when this happened. Wicks was apparently angry over the outcome of a legal dispute over his Social Security benefits.

=== Reno ===
The Bruce R. Thompson Courthouse and Federal Building was completed in 1996. The building&#x27;s primary tenants are the U.S. District Court, U.S. Marshals Service, U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services, Nevada Senators, and the Corporation for National Community Services.

Widely considered the greatest sprint swimmer in history, Popov won gold in the 50-metre and 100 m freestyle at the 1992 Olympics and repeated the feat at the 1996 Olympics, and is the only male in Olympic games history to defend both titles. He held the world record in the 50 m for eight years, and the 100 m for six. In 2003, aged 31, he won 50 m and 100 m gold at the 2003 World Championships.

==Swimming==
Popov began swimming at age 8 at the Children and Youth Sports School of Fakel Sports Complex in Lesnoy, at that time afraid of water. However, his father insisted on him taking swimming lessons in that sports school, and in his own words, he has &quot;been stuck there ever since&quot;. Popov started out as a backstroker but switched to freestyle when he joined Gennadi Touretski&#x27;s squad in 1990 on the initiative by the head coach of the USSR National Team Gleb Petrov. He later moved from Russia to Australia to be with his coach.

Popov won the men&#x27;s 50 m and 100 m freestyle in the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, and repeated his victories in the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, becoming the first man to do so since Johnny Weissmuller. He presented Touretski with his 1996 Olympic gold medal from the 100 m freestyle. &quot;I have a title and I&#x27;m on the paper, but, you know, Gennadi hasn&#x27;t gotten anything from Atlanta or from Barcelona,&quot; Popov said. &quot;But I know how much this particular medal means for him, is worth for him.&quot;

One month after the Atlanta Olympics, he was stabbed in the abdomen with a knife during a dispute with three Moscow street vendors. The knife sliced his artery, grazed one of his kidneys and damaged the pleura, the membrane that encases the lungs. He had emergency surgery and spent three months in rehabilitation. At the 1997 European Championships in Seville, Spain, he successfully defended his 50 m and 100 m freestyle titles.

In 2000, he beat the world record in the 50-metre freestyle in a time of 21.64 at Russia&#x27;s Olympic Trials in Moscow. Popov, considered one of the most technically sound swimmers of all time, took just 31 strokes to set the world mark, which would last nearly eight years.

Popov finished second in the 100 meter freestyle at the 2000 Olympics.

At the 2003 Barcelona World Championships, Popov once again made a clean sweep of the men&#x27;s 50 m and 100 m freestyle events, citing that Barcelona would always be special to him, for it was there that for him, everything first began.

He announced his participation in the 2004 Athens Olympics. Moreover, he was the Flagbearer of Russia in the opening ceremony. Popov was the oldest competitor at the pool, and finished 9th in the men&#x27;s 50 m and 18th in the 100 m freestyle.

He announced his retirement from the sport in January 2005.

==Post swimming==

Popov was elected a full member of the International Olympic Committee in December 1999. He also represents the athletes on the IOC Sport for All Commission and was elected directly as one of seven athletes to the IOC Athletes&#x27; Commission by the athletes participating in the 1996 Olympics. He was re-elected to the Athletes Commission at the 2000 Games and is now Honorary Secretary. He was awarded the 1996 Russian Medal of Honour for contributions to sport. He was also named Russian Athlete of the Year and European Sports Press Union Athlete of the Year in 1996.

In June 2003, he confirmed that he was permanently leaving Australia in early 2004 to live in Solothurn, Switzerland. He said the move followed the offer of a business proposition in Switzerland, once he had retired from swimming. He retained Touretski as a long-distance coach.

Popov earned both a bachelor&#x27;s and a master&#x27;s degree in sports coaching from the Russian Academy.

He is a spokesman for Omega SA alongside other swimmers such as Ian Thorpe.

He appeared at the closing ceremony of the Beijing Olympics after being elected a member of the IOC, presenting flowers to volunteers. He was named to the Evaluation Commission for the 2016 Summer Olympics.

In 2009, he served as the chairman of the RC Lokomotiv Moscow rugby league club.

Since May 2009 he has been a member of the supervisory board of Adidas.

==Personal life==
In 1997, Popov he married Darya Shmeleva, a Russian Olympic swimmer he had dated since 1995. They have two sons, Vladimir (born 1997) and Anton (born 2000), and a daughter, Mia (born 2010).

Popov is a friend of wrestler Aleksandr Karelin.

==Controversy==
On 4 July 2019, the International Olympic Committee accused Alexander Popov, and eight other members of the IOC, of accepting bribes in order to secure their votes for Rio de Janeiro as host of the 2016 Summer Olympics. The former governor of Rio de Janeiro, Sérgio Cabral, contended in court that he paid $2 million to Lamine Diack, the former president of the International Association of Athletics Federation, which it was known as at the time, in order to secure votes. On 5 July 2019, Popov denied these allegations, citing that he did not take any money in return for his vote.

<doc id="915626" wikidata="Q440782" url="?curid=915626" title="Alexander Andreyevich Baranov">
<text>Alexander Andreyevich Baranov (; 1747 – 1819), sometimes spelled Aleksandr or Alexandr and Baranof, was a Russian trader and merchant, who worked for some time in Siberia. He was recruited by the Shelikhov-Golikov Company for trading in Russian America, beginning in 1790 with a five-year contract as manager of the outpost. He continued to serve past the end date of his contract.

In 1799 Baranov was promoted, appointed by the recently chartered Russian-American Company as Chief Manager, effectively the first governor of Russian America. He served until 1818. This was the early colonial period of expansion of settlements. He founded Pavlovskaya (Kodiak) and later New Archangel (Sitka), Russian colonies that were bases of the company in present-day Alaska. In addition, he oversaw the expansion of the lucrative fur trade with Alaska Natives. He engaged in brutal tactics to extract wealth from Alaska. He demanded tribute in the forms of furs from native peoples, a practice known as Yasak. To enforce the demands for tribute, he took hostages and demanded furs in exchange for release of hostages.

He continued to support his Russian wife and children, who had moved from Siberia back to live near St. Petersburg. In Pavlovskaya, Baranov took an Aleut woman as mistress and had three mixed-race children with her. After learning that his wife had died in 1807 in Russia, he married his mistress, legitimizing their children. In 1817 Irina, his oldest daughter born in Alaska, married Semyon Yanovsky, a Russian naval officer. Late in 1818, Yanovsky was appointed as Chief Manager and successor to Baranov. That year Baranov departed to sail back to Russia, but he died in April 1819 and was buried at sea.

==Early life and family==
Alexander Andreyevich Baranov was born in 1747 in Kargopol, in St. Petersburg Governorate of the Russian Empire. He was the son of 
Andrey Baranov, a lower-class merchant or &quot;mestchanin&quot;, in the Russian stratified order of classes. Baranov ran away from home at the young age of fifteen and went to Moscow, where he became a clerk before returning home.

After he married and his first child (a daughter) was born, Baranov took his young family to Siberia for its frontier opportunities. In Irkutsk, he became a trader and tax collector with his brother. Eventually, his wife left Baranov and returned to Kargopol with their daughter and two young children they had adopted. There was no divorce in the Russian Orthodox Church. Baranov supported them all from afar.

==Establishment of Russian America==
Due to business reverses that had left Baranov nearly bankrupt, he was lured to Russian America by opportunities offered by Grigory Ivanovich Shelikhov, a merchant and developer who had established a settlement on Kodiak Island to enhance the growing Russian maritime fur trade there. Baranov accepted a five-year contract starting in the fall of 1790 to be the chief manager of the Shelikhov-Golikov Company, and to establish and manage additional trading posts in the Kodiak Island region.

En route in 1790 from Okhotsk, Siberia to Kodiak Island of Russian America, Baranov suffered the wreck of his ship in October on Unalaska Island, an Aleutian Island close to the Alaska Peninsula. It was about 600 miles from Kodiak. With critical help from the local indigenous Aleut people, Baranov and his shipmates survived the winter. They continued their journey via Native sea-going boats in the spring of 1791 and reached Kodiak Island.

In 1792, Baranov moved the Russian settlement from Three Saints Bay, which had too constrained an area to succeed, to what they called &quot;Pavlovskaya&quot; (later renamed as Kodiak). In 1793, he founded the port of Voskresenskii, modern-day Seward. In 1794, under the direction of a British sea captain working for the Russian-American Company (RAC) a sea-going sailing ship was built at Resurrection Bay. This was important for the colonies in fulfilling their transportation needs. Shortly after, a group of Russian Orthodox clergy arrived in Russian America. Their views were often at odds with Baranov&#x27;s methods of management, especially of the native workers.

He founded a settlement in Yakutat Bay in 1795 for 30 serf farming families from Russia. By 1797, Baranov was two years overdue to be replaced, and he had no word of relief. That year, Baranov&#x27;s Aleut mistress gave birth to their son, Antipatr. He had two more mixed-race Aleut-Russian children with his mistress, also giving them Russian names: Irina and Ekaterina. After learning that his wife in Russia had died, Baranov married the Aleut woman, legitimizing their children.

==Russian-American Company==
In Saint Petersburg, then capital of Russia, Nikolai Rezanov was a high official, Chamberlain to the Tsar. He was also Chairman of the RAC, successor of the Shelikhov Company, through which Russia occupied and ruled Alaska. Due to Rezanov&#x27;s influence at the royal court, in 1799 Baranov was appointed as Chief Manager – to manage all of the RAC&#x27;s interests in the field, including the Aleutian and Kuril Islands. However, due to the one-year travel time each way between St. Petersburg and Alaska, it was late 1800 before Baranov learned of his promotion and expanded responsibilities.

Communication with the government in St. Petersburg was so difficult that Baranov was left almost entirely on his own to decide any pressing issues. For all practical matters, he was the government of Alaska. In 1799, Baranov had decided that perceived British encroachment on Russia&#x27;s holdings in southeastern Alaska required him to build a defensive fort in that area. While the Russians maintained that he bought a portion of land from the Tlingit and built a fort and settlement on Sitka Island overlooking Sitka Sound, the Tlingit believed that land could not be owned, therefore meaning that the land occupied by the Russians was never purchased. He believed it was important in order to ensure that the region remained under Russian instead of British control.

In 1802, after Baranov had returned to Kodiak to tend to matters there, the Tlingit tribe on Sitka Island decided to expel the Russians. The latter disregarded the Tlingit warnings to evacuate. Led by war chief Katlian (spelled &quot;Kot-le-an&quot; in Michener&#x27;s &quot;Alaska&quot;), the Tlingit attacked and massacred nearly everyone at the Sitka settlement. Baranov responded by gathering naval forces and an army of about 700 Aleut warriors to attack Katlian&#x27;s new fort on Sitka at Indian River. He intended to push the Tlingit off Sitka Island temporarily in order to build a new Russian fort at the most strategic site on Sitka Sound. This would be at a place that had been long occupied by the Tlingit, who also knew its strategic value.

To Baranov&#x27;s great surprise and satisfaction, as he prepared for battle, a decree arrived from Tsar Alexander I promoting him to the rank of Collegiate Counselor—a rank in the middle of the Russian ranks of nobility. From the lowly class of &quot;mestchannin&quot;, far below nobility, he had been elevated to a rank equal or superior to the Imperial Russian Navy ship captains, who had treated him with condescension because of his low social rank.

===Battle of Sitka===

In September 1804, Baranov sailed into Sitka Sound with his forces, including the frigate &quot;Neva&quot;. Baranov met with Katlian and other Native chiefs and tried to negotiate a peaceful resolution, without success. Just before the Battle of Sitka began, most of the Tlingit gunpowder (acquired from the British and Americans) exploded. It was hit by Russian gunfire while being moved by Tlingit warriors in a war canoe to their main fort from storage on a small island. This loss greatly weakened the Tlingit defenses.

The Russian ground forces unsuccessfully launched a frontal attack on the Tlingit fort at Indian River. Thereafter, they concentrated on naval bombardment from the big guns of the frigate &quot;Neva.&quot; After several days, the Tlingit abandoned their fort and escaped in a &quot;survival march&quot; to the adjoining Chichagof Island to the north. Baranov immediately began construction of a new fort on top of a rock outcropping at the eastern edge of Sitka Sound. Food soon became scarce for the Russians. Baranov sent a 50-foot sailboat, under the command of his deputy Ivan Kuskov, the 2800 miles to Hawaii to get urgently needed food supplies from King Kamehameha, a long-time trading friend. Kuskov returned with the supplies in time to narrowly avert starvation of the Russians at Sitka.

===Rezanov Inspection===
In 1805, Tlingit warriors attacked and massacred the Russian settlement at Yakutat, which Baranov decided to abandon. Late that year, Nikolai Rezanov, the Tsar&#x27;s Chamberlain and Chairman of the RAC, arrived in Russian America for an inspection trip. He had heard rumors that Baranov was mismanaging affairs. But Rezanov&#x27;s resulting reports to the Tsar praised Baranov&#x27;s management and attributed rumors against the governor to malcontents.

Baranov asked to be relieved of his position so that he could return to Russia and see his family there again. Believing Baranov to be indispensable to the RAC colonies, Rezanov avoided a definite answer.

The American maritime fur trader John DeWolf was at Sitka when Rezanov arrived. DeWolf, noting the difficulty the RAC had in acquiring decent ships, offered to sell his ship &quot;Juno&quot; to the RAC. Rezanov readily agreed.

In the spring of 1806, Rezanov sailed the &quot;Juno&quot; from Sitka to San Francisco in Spanish-held California to obtain urgently needed food supplies in exchange for otter furs. He also tried to establish an alliance with the Spanish against the United Kingdom and United States. During this visit with the Spanish of Northern California, he became enamored of María de la Concepción &quot;Conchita&quot; Argüello, the famously beautiful daughter of the commander of the Spanish garrison at San Francisco. They became engaged to be married, subject to religious approvals, as she was Roman Catholic and he was Russian Orthodox. Rezanov thought this potential match would be a boon to Russian/Spanish cooperation in North America.

He returned to Sitka with the needed food. From there, he sailed to Siberia to begin the thousands of miles of overland travel to St. Petersburg to seek the necessary religious approvals from Russian Orthodox clergy for his marriage. During the harsh winter trek on horseback across Siberia, Rezanov became ill and died. His great dream of a joint Russian-Spanish empire of the Pacific ended there.

===Later years===
In 1807 Baranov was awarded the Order of St. Anna, 2nd class for his successful perseverance and leadership. That year he received news that his Russian wife had died. Baranov married his Native mistress in the Russian Orthodox church and had their three children legitimized. Despite his success in reestablishing a solid presence at present-day Sitka, to which Baranov had moved the capital of Russian America from Kodiak, there was local opposition to his rule.

He wore a shirt of iron mail beneath his outer shirt to protect himself. The Tlingit made several unsuccessful attempts at assassination, and were amazed by his survival, not knowing of his armor. In 1810, Baranov was at risk of assassination by some of his own disgruntled Russian soldiers, but he was warned and the attempt was thwarted. Meanwhile, he learned that men who had been appointed by the RAC to relieve Baranov died en route to Alaska, to his great disappointment.

Activity in the region flourished as trading in sea otter and seal furs boomed. Baranov convinced Native hunters to expand their range to include the coasts of California. Baranov also advocated more educational opportunities for the Alaska Native Americans. Under his leadership, schools were created and frontier communities became less isolated. During Baranov&#x27;s rule, Russian Orthodox missionaries operated widely in Russian America. They translated the Bible into Tlingit and other Native languages, conducted mass in those languages, and inoculated Natives against smallpox.

In 1812, Baranov established Fort Ross in California about 50 miles north of San Francisco. It was intended to develop farm products to feed the Alaskan communities.

===Schäffer affair===

In 1815, Baranov sent Dr. Georg Schäffer, a physician, to Hawaii to establish a way station to accommodate Russian ships carrying furs from Alaska to the booming fur markets of Canton, China. Schaffer got involved with Hawaiian politics to the displeasure of King Kamahameha; he was forced to depart for China and leave the Russian forts on Kauaʻi abandoned. The Hawaiian project was Baranov&#x27;s greatest failure, causing considerable expense to the RAC.

As a result of this failure, concern about Baranov&#x27;s age (70), and allegations against him by navy officers returning from Alaska, the RAC Board of Directors decided to commission Russian Navy Capt. Lt. Ludwig von Hagemeister (also known as Leontij in Russian) to go to Alaska, investigate the charges against Baranov, and replace him as Chief Manager and governor. He did not reach Alaska until 1817, and replaced Baranov in early 1818. 
===Retirement and death===
Hagemeister arrived at Sitka in November 1817 with an accountant, Kirill Khlebnikov (later Baranov&#x27;s first biographer), to audit the financial records of Russian America for any evidence of Baranov&#x27;s alleged wrongdoing. Hagemeister succeeded Baranov as Chief Manager and governor in January 1818. Khlebnikov was appointed Office Manager, receiving company capital totaling two and a half million rubles. Khlebnikov&#x27;s audit showed that the books balanced to the ruble, with all income and disbursements accounted for. There was no evidence of malfeasance by Baranov. The audit showed that Baranov was personally almost insolvent because he had made it a practice to help others in financial distress with his own funds throughout his rule.

In late July 1818, a Russian Imperial Navy ship sailing around the world arrived in Sitka for a brief visit of less than a month. On board was Mikhail Tikhanov, a Navy artist assigned to document the voyage. In August 1818, Tikhanov painted an oil portrait of Baranov and a watercolor of Tlingit chief Katlian and his wife. These were the only likenesses ever made during their lifetimes of the two long-time antagonists who had finally made peace. It was painted when he was 71, six months before he died. In the Katlian painting, the chief is about age 45. He is shown with an &quot;Allies of Russia&quot; silver medal hanging on a light chain from his neck, and with Baranov&#x27;s &quot;Castle&quot; fortress in the distance behind the chief. The two paintings together, by the same artist at the same time, offer a remarkable narrative on war and peace.

In October 1818, Hagemeister appointed his second-in-command Navy Lt. Semyon Yanovsky, by then husband of Irina Baranov and thus Baranov&#x27;s son-in-law, to act as Chief Manager and governor. Yanovsky was replaced in 1820 with Matvey Muravyev who had been appointed directly by the Board of the RAC. On 27 November, Baranov and Hagemeister left Alaska together on the Navy ship &quot;Kutuzov&quot; for Russia. The ship headed south on a route that would take it west around the Cape of Good Hope at the foot of the African continent, to sail northward to St. Petersburg. En route, the ship made an extended stopover in March 1819 in the Dutch settlement of Batavia, on the island of Java, then part of the colonial Dutch East Indies (present day Indonesia). Baranov became ill there, and soon after the ship resumed its journey, he died on 16 April 1819. He was buried at sea in the Sunda Strait off Panaitan, never reaching his homeland or his family.

<text>A color wheel or color circle is an abstract illustrative organization of color hues around a circle, which shows the relationships between primary colors, secondary colors, tertiary colors etc.

Some sources use the terms &quot;color wheel&quot; and &quot;color circle&quot; interchangeably; however, one term or the other may be more prevalent in certain fields or certain versions as mentioned above. For instance, some reserve the term &quot;color wheel&quot; for mechanical rotating devices, such as color tops, filter wheels or the Newton disc. Others classify various color wheels as &quot;color disc&quot;, &quot;color chart&quot;, and &quot;color scale&quot; varieties.

==History==
In his book &quot;Opticks&quot;, Isaac Newton presented a color circle to illustrate the relations between these colors. The original color circle of Isaac Newton showed only the spectral hues and was provided to illustrate a rule for the color of mixtures of lights, that these could be approximately predicted from the center of gravity of the numbers of &quot;rays&quot; of each spectral color present (represented in his diagram by small circles). The divisions of Newton&#x27;s circle are of unequal size, being based on the intervals of a Dorian musical scale. Most later color circles include the purples, however, between red and violet, and have equal-sized hue divisions. Color scientists and psychologists often use the additive primaries, red, green, and blue; and often refer to their arrangement around a circle as a color circle as opposed to a color wheel.

Thomas Young postulated that the eye contains receptors that respond to three different primary sensations, or spectra of light. James Clerk Maxwell showed that all hues, and almost all colors, can be created from three primary colors such as red, green, and blue, if they are mixed in the right proportions. Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Theory of Colours&quot; provided the first systematic study of the physiological effects of color (1810). His observations on the effect of opposed colors led him to a symmetric arrangement of his color wheel anticipating Ewald Hering&#x27;s opponent color theory (1872).
==Colors of the color wheel==
===Trichromatic model===
Most color wheels are based on three primary colors, three secondary colors, and the six intermediates formed by mixing a primary with a secondary, known as tertiary colors, for a total of 12 main divisions; some add more intermediates, for 24 named colors. They make use of the trichromatic model of color.

====Subtractive====

The typical artists&#x27; paint or pigment color wheel includes the blue, red, and yellow primary colors. The corresponding secondary colors are green, orange, and violet or purple. The tertiary colors are green-yellow, yellow-orange, orange-red, red-violet/purple, purple/violet-blue and blue-green.

Non-digital visual artists typically use red, yellow, and blue primaries (RYB color model) arranged at three equally spaced points around their color wheel. Printers and others who use modern subtractive color methods and terminology use cyan, magenta, and yellow as subtractive primaries. Intermediate and interior points of color wheels and circles represent color mixtures. In a paint or subtractive color wheel, the &#x27;center of gravity&#x27; is usually (but not always) black, representing all colors of light being absorbed.

====Additive====
A color wheel based on RGB (red, green, blue) additive primaries has cyan, magenta, and yellow secondaries. Alternatively, the same arrangement of colors around a circle can be described as based on cyan, magenta, and yellow subtractive primaries, with red, green, and blue being secondaries. Sometimes a RGV (red, green, violet) triad is used instead. In an additive color circle, the center is white or gray, indicating a mixture of different wavelengths of light (all wavelengths, or two complementary colors, for example).
The HSL and HSV color spaces are simple geometric transformations of the RGB cube into cylindrical form. The outer top circle of the HSV cylinder – or the outer middle circle of the HSL cylinder – can be thought of as a color wheel. There is no authoritative way of labelling the colors in such a color wheel, but the six colors which fall at the corners of the RGB cube are given names in the X11 color list, and are named keywords in HTML.

===Opponent process model===
Some color wheels are based on the four opponent process colors - red, yellow, blue and green. This includes those of the Natural Color System.

==The color circle and color vision==

A color circle based on spectral wavelengths appears with red at one end of the spectrum and is 100% mixable violet at the other. A wedge-shaped gap represents colors that have no unique spectral frequency. These extra-spectral colors, the purples, form from an additive mixture of colors from the ends of the spectrum.

In normal human vision, wavelengths of between about 400 nm and 700 nm are represented by this incomplete circle, with the longer wavelengths equating to the red end of the spectrum. Complement colors are located directly opposite each other on this wheel. These complement colors are not identical to colors in pigment mixing (such as are used in paint), but when lights are additively mixed in the correct proportions appear as a neutral grey or white.

The color circle is used for, among other purposes, illustrating additive color mixture. Combining two colored lights from different parts of the spectrum will produce a third color that appears like a light from another part of the spectrum, even though dissimilar wavelengths are involved. This type of color matching is known as metameric matching. Thus, a combination of green and red light will produce the color yellow in apparent hue. The newly formed color lies between the two original colors on the color circle.

Objects may be viewed under a variety of different lighting conditions. The human visual system is able to adapt to these differences by chromatic adaptation. This aspect of the visual system is relatively easy to mislead, and optical illusions relating to color are therefore a common phenomenon. The color circle is a useful tool for examining these illusions.

Arranging spectral colors in a circle to predict admixture of light stems from work by Sir Isaac Newton. Newton&#x27;s calculation of the resulting color involves three steps: First, mark on the color circle the constituent colors according to their relative weight. Second, find the barycenter of these differently weighted colors. Third, interpret the radial distance (from the center of the circle to the barycenter) as the saturation of the color, and the azimuthal position on the circle as the hue of the color. Thus, Newton&#x27;s color circle is a predecessor of the modern, horseshoe-shaped CIE color diagram.

The psychophysical theory behind the color circle dates to the early color triangle of Thomas Young, whose work was later extended by James Clerk Maxwell and Hermann von Helmholtz.

==Color wheels and paint color mixing==

There is no straight-line relationship between colors mixed in pigment, which vary from medium to medium. With a psychophysical color circle, however, the resulting hue of any mixture of two colored light sources can be determined simply by the relative brightness and wavelength of the two lights. A similar calculation cannot be performed with two paints. As such, a painter&#x27;s color wheel is indicative rather than predictive, being used to compare existing colors rather than calculate exact colors of mixtures. Because of differences relating to the medium, different color wheels can be created according to the type of paint or other medium used, and many artists make their own individual color wheels. These often contain only blocks of color rather than the gradation between tones that is characteristic of the color circle.

===Color wheel software===

A number of interactive color wheel applications are available both on the Internet and as desktop applications. These programs are used by artists and designers for picking colors for a design.

==Color schemes==

In color theory, a color scheme is the choice of colors used in design for a range of media. For example, the use of a white background with black text is an example of a common default color scheme in web design.

Color schemes are logical combinations of colors on the color wheel. Color schemes are used to create style and appeal. Colors that create an aesthetic feeling together commonly appear together in color schemes. A basic color scheme uses two colors that look appealing together. More advanced color schemes involve several colors in combination, usually based around a single color—for example, text with such colors as red, yellow, orange and light blue arranged together on a black background in a magazine article. Color schemes can also contain different shades of a single color; for example, a color scheme that mixes different shades of green, ranging from very light (almost white) to very dark.

Complementary colors are two colors directly across from each other; for example, red and green are complementary colors. Tetradic color palettes use four colors, a pair of complementary color pairs. For example, one could use yellow, purple, red, and green. Tetrad colors can be found by putting a square or rectangle on the color wheel.
An analogous color scheme is made up of colors next to each other on the wheel. For example, red, orange, and yellow are analogous colors. Monochromatic colors are different shades of the same color. For example, light blue, indigo, and cyan blue. Complementary colors are colors across from each other on a color wheel. For example, blue and orange. Triadic colors are colors that are evenly across from each other, in a triangle over the color wheel. For example, the primary colors red, yellow, and blue are triadic colors.

<text>The United States District Court for the District of Wyoming (in case citations, D. Wyo.) is the federal district court whose jurisdiction comprises the state of Wyoming and those portions of Yellowstone National Park situated in Montana and Idaho; it is the only federal court district that includes portions of more than one state, creating a possible &quot;Zone of Death&quot; where it would be difficult to prosecute crimes. The court has locations in Cheyenne and Casper.

Appeals from this court are heard by the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

The United States Attorney&#x27;s Office for the District of Wyoming represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court. As of , the acting United States attorney is Eric Heimann.

== Zone of death ==
Law professor Brian C. Kalt has argued that it may be impossible to impanel a jury in compliance with the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution for a crime committed solely in the Idaho portion of Yellowstone National Park (and that it would be difficult to do so for a crime committed solely in the Montana portion). This has been referred to as the Zone of Death.

<doc id="915633" wikidata="Q3938475" url="?curid=915633" title="Robert X. Cringely">
<text>Robert X. Cringely is the pen name of both technology journalist Mark Stephens and a string of writers for a column in &quot;InfoWorld&quot;, the one-time weekly computer trade newspaper published by IDG.

== InfoWorld ==

Mark Stephens contributed to &quot;InfoWorld&quot; under the Cringely pseudonym. During Stephens&#x27; lengthy tenure (1987–1995), the character of Cringely changed dramatically (morphing from a private eye type to a slick, womanizing tech insider) and became an increasingly popular tech pundit after he published the book &quot;Accidental Empires: How the Boys of Silicon Valley Make Their Millions, Battle Foreign Competition and Still Can&#x27;t Get a Date&quot; (1992, ).

After a financial disagreement in 1995, Stephens was dismissed from &quot;InfoWorld&quot; and was promptly sued by IDG to prevent him from continuing to use the Cringely trademark. A settlement was reached out of court that allowed him to use the name, so long as he did not contribute to competing technology magazines.

== Mark Stephens ==

=== Biography ===

Stephens was born in 1953, in Apple Creek, Ohio. He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the College of Wooster in Ohio in 1975 and a Master&#x27;s degree in Communication from Stanford University in 1979, where he also pursued work toward a doctorate. He served on the &quot;Public&#x27;s Right to Information Task Force&quot; as part of the President&#x27;s Commission on the Accident at Three Mile Island. He has claimed he was employee #12 at Apple, Inc., though Daniel Kottke also claims this number.

Stephens&#x27; writing as Robert X. Cringely regularly appeared in publications such as &quot;Forbes&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, &quot;Success&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Upside&quot;, and &quot;Worth&quot;. Stephens has also appeared as Cringely in two documentaries based on his writings: &quot;Triumph of the Nerds: The Rise of Accidental Empires&quot; (1996) and &quot;Nerds 2.0.1: A Brief History of the Internet&quot; (1998) and in a three-part documentary on PBS called &quot;Plane Crazy&quot;, in which he attempted to build an aircraft in 30 days and fly it when completed. The project quickly fell behind schedule and he became angry with the film crew. Eventually, Cringely admitted defeat and cut up the aircraft. In the final episode, he builds an existing kit designed and assisted by Fisher Aero.

As Cringely, Stephens produced and hosted an Internet television show called &quot;NerdTV&quot; (2005–06) for PBS and, until late 2008, wrote an online column for the PBS website called &quot;I, Cringely: The Pulpit&quot;. On November 14, 2008, Stephens announced that he would stop contributing columns to PBS as of that December 15. He indicated that the move was his own decision &quot;and not that of PBS, which has been nothing but good to me these many years&quot;. He also blogged for the Technology Evangelist site during 2007.

From 2009 through 2023, he posted articles on his own &quot;I, Cringely&quot; site.

U.S. attorneys for Vermont since it attained statehood in 1791 include:


==U.S. marshals==
===Duties and responsibilities===
The United States Marshal for the District of Vermont oversees all Marshals Service operations in Vermont. The Vermont district maintains offices in Burlington and Rutland, enabling the Marshals Service to carry out its role with respect to public safety in Vermont. The U.S. Marshal for Vermont is responsible for federal law enforcement activities within the state, including apprehending fugitives and sex offenders, managing transport of federal prisoners, and protecting federal courthouses.

===History===
The offices of U.S. Marshal and Deputy Marshal were created by the 1st U.S. Congress when it passed the Judiciary Act of 1789. Marshals were presidential appointees and their duties included supporting the federal courts within their districts and executing the orders of the president, Congress and federal judges. Support of the courts included serving subpoenas, summonses, writs, and warrants, making arrests, and handling prisoners. Marshals were also responsible for the finances and administration of the courts, including paying fees, expenses, and salaries for court clerks, U.S. Attorneys, jurors, and witnesses. Marshals serve at the pleasure of the president, and when the positions were created, Congress created a time limit on Marshals&#x27; service. Marshals are limited to four-year, renewable terms that expire unless they are reappointed.

In the country&#x27;s early years, Marshals rented courtroom and jail space, and hired and supervised bailiffs, criers, and janitors. They also handled the day-to-day activities of court proceedings, including ensuring that defendants were present, jurors were available, and witnesses appeared as required. Marshals were also called upon to carry out federal death sentences and investigate counterfeiting. Because they were paid on a fee system, the positions were lucrative and highly sought after.

Marshals also filled a gap in the federal government as it was originally designed, executing numerous tasks because no other agency was available to do them. These duties included taking the national census every 10 years until 1870, distributing Presidential proclamations, collecting statistical data for use by federal agencies, and supplying data on federal employees for including in a national register, deporting foreigners who entered the country illegally, and capturing fugitive slaves.

Over time, the duties of Marshals grew to include activities such as enforcement of the Eighteenth Amendment, the prohibition of the sale and transport of alcoholic beverages. In the modern era, the duties and responsibilities of U.S. Marshals include witness protection and apprehension of federal fugitives.

<text>The Alexander Archipelago () is a long archipelago (group of islands) in North America lying off the southeastern coast of Alaska. It contains about 1,100 islands, the tops of submerged coastal mountains that rise steeply from the Pacific Ocean. Deep channels and fjords separate the islands and cut them off from the mainland. The islands shelter the northern part of the Inside Passage as it winds its way among them.

The islands have irregular, steep coasts and dense evergreen and temperate rain forests; most are accessible only by boat or by airplane. The vast majority of the islands are part of the Tongass National Forest.

In order of land area, the largest islands are Prince of Wales Island, Chichagof Island, Admiralty Island, Baranof Island, Revillagigedo Island, Kupreanof Island, Kuiu Island, Etolin Island, Dall Island, Wrangell Island, Mitkof Island, Zarembo Island, Kosciusko Island, Kruzof Island, Annette Island, Gravina Island, and Yakobi Island. All the islands are rugged, densely forested, and have an abundance of wildlife.

The Tlingit and Kaigani Haida people are native to the area. The Tsimshian people found on Annette Island are not originally from the area, having immigrated to the region from British Columbia in the late 19th century.

Ketchikan on Revillagigedo Island and Sitka
on Baranof Island are the largest towns on the islands. The most populous neighborhoods of the largest town in the region, Juneau, stand on the mainland, though portions of the city also lie on Douglas Island, which is a part of the archipelago.

Tourism, fishing, and logging are the main industries of the islands.

== History ==
The first European to visit the archipelago was the Russian navigator Aleksei Chirikov in 1741, who sighted the coasts of Noyes and Baker Islands (both off the west coast of Prince of Wales Island), as well as Baranof, Chichagof, Kruzof and Yakobi Islands. In 1774 Juan José Pérez Hernández sighted the south coast of Dall Island, while Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra entered Bucareli Bay off Prince of Wales Island the following year. In 1792 Jacinto Caamaño sighted Revillagigedo Island and the Gravina Islands, discovering Clarence Strait. George Vancouver and his men made an extensive survey of the archipelago in 1793 and 1794, circumnavigating both Revillagigedo and Admiralty Islands, charting the entirety of Kuiu Island, the east sides of Baranof and Chichagof Islands, and Etolin, Wrangell, Zarembo, Mitkof, and Kupreanof Islands. Within a decade the Russians had traversed Peril Strait separating Chichagof and Baranof Islands, and in the following decades found the straits and passages separating several of the other major islands. An 1844 Russian chart shows Kupreanof separated from Mitkof Island and Etolin, Wrangell, Woronkofski, and Zarembo Islands separated from each other.

The archipelago was a locus of the Maritime Fur Trade during the early 19th century. Control of the islands passed from Russia to the United States with the Alaska Purchase in 1867.

According to Donald Orth&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of Alaska Place Names&quot; (p. 64), the Alexander Archipelago received its name from the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1867. The island chain is named for Tsar Alexander II of Russia.

On an 1860 map of Russian America (Alaska), the island group is called the King George III Archipelago.

<doc id="915644" wikidata="Q1189806" url="?curid=915644" title="Corneal endothelium">
<text>The corneal endothelium is a single layer of endothelial cells on the inner surface of the cornea. It faces the chamber formed between the cornea and the iris.

The corneal endothelium are specialized, flattened, mitochondria-rich cells that line the posterior surface of the cornea and face the anterior chamber of the eye. The corneal endothelium governs fluid and solute transport across the posterior surface of the cornea and maintains the cornea in the slightly dehydrated state that is required for optical transparency.

==Embryology and anatomy==
The corneal endothelium is embryologically derived from the neural crest. The postnatal total endothelial cellularity of the cornea (approximately 300,000 cells per cornea) is achieved as early as the second trimester of gestation. Thereafter the endothelial cell density (but not the absolute number of cells) rapidly declines, as the fetal cornea grows in surface area, achieving a final adult density of approximately 2400 - 3200 cells/mm2. The number of endothelial cells in the fully developed cornea decreases with age up until early adulthood, stabilizing around 50 years of age.

The normal corneal endothelium is a single layer of uniformly sized cells with a predominantly hexagonal shape. This honeycomb tiling scheme yields the greatest efficiency, in terms of total perimeter, of packing the posterior corneal surface with cells of a given area. The corneal endothelium is attached to the rest of the cornea through Descemet&#x27;s membrane, which is an acellular layer composed mostly of collagen IV.

==Physiology==

The principal physiological function of the corneal endothelium is to allow leakage of solutes and nutrients from the aqueous humor to the more superficial layers of the cornea while at the same time pumping water in the opposite direction, from the stroma to the aqueous. This dual function of the corneal endothelium is described by the &quot;pump-leak hypothesis.&quot; Since the cornea is avascular, which renders it optimally transparent, the nutrition of the corneal epithelium, stromal keratocytes, and corneal endothelium must occur via diffusion of glucose and other solutes from the aqueous humor, across the corneal endothelium. The corneal endothelium then transports water from the stromal-facing surface to the aqueous-facing surface by an interrelated series of active and passive ion exchangers. Critical to this energy-driven process is the role of Na+/K+ATPase and carbonic anhydrase. Bicarbonate ions formed by the action of carbonic anhydrase are translocated across the cell membrane, allowing water to passively follow.

==Mechanisms of corneal edema==
Corneal endothelial cells are post-mitotic and divide rarely, if at all, in the post-natal human cornea. Wounding of the corneal endothelium, as from trauma or other insults, prompts healing of the endothelial monolayer by sliding and enlargement of adjacent endothelial cells, rather than mitosis. Endothelial cell loss, if sufficiently severe, can cause endothelial cell density to fall below the threshold level needed to maintain corneal deturgescence. This threshold of endothelial cell density varies considerably amongst individuals, but is typically in the range of 500 - 1000 cells/mm2. Typically, loss of endothelial cell density is accompanied by increases in cell size variability (polymegathism) and cell shape variation (polymorphism). Corneal edema can also occur as the result of compromised endothelial function due to intraocular inflammation or other causes. Excess hydration of the corneal stroma disrupts the normally uniform periodic spacing of Type I collagen fibrils, creating light scatter. In addition, excessive corneal hydration can result in edema of the corneal epithelial layer, which creates irregularity at the optically critical tear film-air interface. Both stromal light scatter and surface epithelial irregularity contribute to degraded optical performance of the cornea and can compromise visual acuity.

==Causes of endothelial disease==
Leading causes of endothelial failure include inadvertent endothelial trauma from intraocular surgery (such as cataract surgery) and Fuchs&#x27; dystrophy. Surgical causes of endothelial failure include both acute intraoperative trauma as well as chronic postoperative trauma, such as from a malpositioned intraocular lens or retained nuclear fragment in the anterior chamber. Other risk factors include narrow-angle glaucoma, aging, and iritis.

A rare disease called X-linked endothelial corneal dystrophy was described in 2006.

==Treatment for endothelial disease==
There is no medical treatment that can promote wound healing or regeneration of the corneal endothelium. In early stages of corneal edema, symptoms of blurred vision and episodic ocular pain predominate, due to edema and blistering (bullae) of the corneal epithelium. Partial palliation of these symptoms can sometimes be obtained through the instillation of topical hypertonic saline drops, use of bandage soft contact lenses, and/or application of anterior stromal micropuncture. In cases in which irreversible corneal endothelial failure develops, severe corneal edema ensues, and the only effective remedy is replacement of the diseased corneal endothelium through the surgical approach of corneal transplantation.

Historically, penetrating keratoplasty, or full thickness corneal transplantation, was the treatment of choice for irreversible endothelial failure. More recently, new corneal transplant techniques have been developed to enable more selective replacement of the diseased corneal endothelium. This approach, termed endokeratoplasty, is most appropriate for disease processes that exclusively or predominantly involve the corneal endothelium. Penetrating keratoplasty is preferred when the disease process involves irreversible damage not just to the corneal endothelium, but to other layers of the cornea as well. Compared to full-thickness keratoplasty, endokeratoplasty techniques are associated with shorter recovery times, improved visual results, and greater resistance to wound rupture. Although instrumentation and surgical techniques for endokeratoplasty are still in evolution, one commonly performed form of endokeratoplasty at present is Descemet&#x27;s Stripping (Automated) Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSEK [or DSAEK]). In this form of endokeratoplasty, the diseased host endothelium and associated Descemet&#x27;s membrane are removed from the central cornea, and in their place a specially harvested layer of healthy donor tissue is grafted. This layer consists of posterior stroma, Descemet&#x27;s membrane, and endothelium that has been dissected from cadaveric donor corneal tissue, typically using a mechanized (or &quot;automated&quot;) instrument.

Investigational methods of corneal endothelial surgical replacement include Descemet&#x27;s Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty (DMEK), in which the donor tissue consists only of Descemet&#x27;s membrane and endothelium, and corneal endothelial cell replacement therapy, in which in vitro cultivated endothelial cells are transplanted. These techniques, although still in an early developmental stage, aim to improve the selectivity of the transplantation approach by eliminating the presence of posterior stromal tissue from the grafted tissue.

First flown in 1959, the PC-6 was produced at Pilatus Flugzeugwerke in Stans, Switzerland. It has been built in both piston engine- and turboprop-powered versions, and was produced under licence for a time by Fairchild Hiller in the United States.
After 604 deliveries in 63 years, Pilatus ended production in 2022.

==Development==
On 4 May 1959, the first prototype, powered by a 254 kW (340 shp) piston engine, made its maiden flight. In early May 1961, the first &quot;Turbo Porter&quot;, powered by a Turbomeca Astazou II turboprop engine, performed its initial flight. In comparison to its earlier piston engine-powered incarnation, the Astazou II-equipped &quot;Turbo Porter&quot; had an increased gross capacity and top speed, as well as benefitting from the engine&#x27;s automatic handling functions. These benefits came at the expense of the greater initial purchase cost and higher fuel consumption. Both the piston and turbine-engine versions of the PC-6 became quickly known for their Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) capabilities, requiring only a very short takeoff run before being ready for rotation prior to taking off.
Its unit cost in 1962 was $55,000

The initial turbine-powered models of the PC-6 were equipped with the Astazou II powerplant, however complaints on the reliability of this engine led to another early turboprop powerplant becoming available for the PC-6. This was the Garrett Air Research TPE 331. Some operators such as Air America chose to retrofit their Astazou II-powered PC-6s with the TPE 331 engine. In May 1966, the first PC-6 to be equipped with the Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A engine performed its maiden flight.

To offset rising labour and manufacturing costs in Switzerland, Pilatus distributed manufacturing work on the PC-6 to other countries; in 1993, Czech Republic–based Letov Kbely began manufacturing activity upon the type. Its unit cost in 2010 was $1,900,000. In 2013, Pilatus formed a joint venture with Beijing Tian Xing Jian Yu Science Co., Ltd. to locally manufacture the PC-6 and the newer Pilatus PC-12 in Chongqing, China; initially this facility performed subassembly work on the fuselage, and later other elements such as the wings and moving surfaces, which were transported to Pilatus&#x27; final assembly facility in Stans, Switzerland. Global production of the PC-6 will eventually be transferred to the Chongqing facility. On 11 December 2014, the first Chinese-assembled PC-6 fuselage was completed. In 2014, the majority of PC-6s delivered that year were to Chinese customers. By April 2016, around 20 PC-6s were in operation in the Chinese market; the type has often been used to replace the Antonov An-2, being reportedly cheaper to operate.

The Porter was also manufactured under license by Fairchild Hiller in the United States. Roughly 100 of these licence-produced aircraft would be completed, being mainly purchased by civil operators within the US. A number of Fairchild Hiller-built PC-6s were also procured for military operations during the Vietnam War. It received the designation &quot;AU-23A Peacemaker&quot; for service with the U.S. Air Force. The Peacemaker was fitted with a side-firing 20mm XM-197 Gatling cannon, four wing pylons and a centre fuselage station for external ordnance. However, the AU-23A proved to be troublesome in service. All of them were returned to the continental U.S. and placed into storage after only a single year of operation. In 1979, a pair of UV-20s were assigned to the aviation detachment of the Berlin Brigade in Germany due to their suitability for operating within the heavily restricted airspace; they were fitted for carrying either cargo, up to eleven passengers, or three litters with four medical attendants.

After nearly 600 deliveries in six decades including about 90 Fairchild-Hiller built and 425 PT6-powered, but only 52 in the last ten years, Pilatus will close the orderbook from summer 2018 and will roll off the last one in early 2019 while parts production will continue for at least 20 years.
Due to pandemic delays, the last PC-6 Porter was instead delivered in December 2022 after 604 produced in 63 years.

==Design==

The Pilatus PC-6 Porter is a Short Takeoff and Landing (STOL) utility aircraft. The majority of aircraft are powered by a single Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A turboprop engine, which drives a fully reversible, constant-speed, three-bladed HC-B3TN-3D (or an alternative four-bladed HC-D4N-3P) Hartzell aluminium propeller via a reduction gearbox. Pilatus claims that it possesses unique STOL capabilities, capable of landing in places only otherwise accessible by rotorcraft. It is fully capable of being operated from unprepared rough airstrips, in remote areas, hot climates and at high altitudes in all-weather conditions. In particular, the undercarriage employed provides for high wing and propeller clearances, making the PC-6 less susceptible to damage than conventional nosewheel-type undercarriages. For further landing versatility, various types of landing gear may be optionally installed allowing it to operate from different types of terrain; options include floats for water landings and skis for landing on snow.

Early models of the PC-6 were equipped with a full instrument panel as standard, and were reportedly easy for unfamiliar pilots to intuit. Later-manufactured PC-6s are equipped with a Garmin G950 glass cockpit in place of analog instrumentation; the majority of earlier-produced PC-6s can also be retrofitted with a glass cockpit. In addition to its flight functionality, the G950 system acts as a remote maintenance unit and electronic flight bag all in one. Two large 10.4-inch liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) are present, functioning as the Primary Flight Display for all key flight information and the Multi-function Display for system/mission management. Fully independent secondary flight instrumentation is also provided to provide backup altitude, attitude, and airspeed information in the event of complete electrical failure. The cockpit has been designed for single pilot operations; additional flight controls for a co-pilot can be optionally fitted. Other optional features include an autopilot (capable of operating within all phases of flight), traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), terrain awareness and warning system (TAWS), weather radar, satellite phone, LIDAR, forward-looking infrared (FLIR) and lightning detector; in addition, onboard electrical and avionics equipment are readily modifiable to conform with customer requirements.
The airframe is of a rugged and low-maintenance construction; featuring high levels of accessibility, interchangeability, and favourable manning levels. The wings, fuselage, and empennage are manufactured using conventional semi-monocoque construction techniques, the primary structure being composed of aluminium; the central structure retains critical strength despite the cutout areas for the sliding doors of the main cabin. Corrosion resistance is achieved via a combination of plating and a polyurethane-based enamel paint. The simple nature of the structure allows for ease of repair in the field. Features such as low-pressure tyres, twin-caliper disc brakes, and a highly energy-absorbent undercarriage enable the aircraft to be capable of operating from rough or otherwise challenging terrain.

For role flexibility, individual aircraft can be easily converted between various mission types, such as transport, paradrop, aerial photography, surveillance, air medical services and search and rescue duties. A maximum of ten passengers, or a 2,200 lb payload, may be carried within the aircraft&#x27;s main cabin area within the rear section of the fuselage; the standard passenger seats are designed to allow for rapid removal and may be stowed within an optional separate externally-accessed seat stowage compartment behind the main cabin. The main cabin area is furnished with soundproofing measures, ventilation, and heating as standard. A maximum of three fuel tanks can also be carried in the main cabin, accordingly reducing payload capacity, to increase the aircraft&#x27;s flight endurance. In addition to the large sliding doors at either side of the main cabin, separate hinged doors are present on either side of the cockpit; an optional pilot-controlled trapdoor, to accommodate supply drops or surveillance payloads, may also be installed in the center of the cabin floor without any design changes required. Additional equipment include a firefighting system, aerial application system, underwing tanks, sand filters, propeller de-icing system, mudguard, tailwheel debris guard, oxygen system, and additional power distribution system.

==Operational history==

The PC-6 is noted for its &quot;Short Takeoff and Landing&quot; (STOL) performance on almost any type of terrain - it can take off within a distance of and land within a distance of while carrying a payload of 2,646 lbs (1,200 kg). Thanks to its STOL performance, the PC-6 holds the world record for highest landing by a fixed-wing aircraft, at , on the Dhaulagiri glacier in Nepal.

Due to the type&#x27;s favourable STOL characteristics, described by the magazine &quot;Flying&quot; as being &quot;one of the most helicopter-like airplanes in terms of takeoff performance&quot;, Pilatus has deliberately marketed the PC-6 towards helicopter operators at times, feeling the type to be complementary to their typical mode of operation. According to Pilatus, the PC-6 can provide very similar surveillance capabilities to a rotorcraft at a significantly lower cost to operate and procure.
During its early service, the PC-6 Porter was noted for its high level of comfort and usability against competing aircraft. The type has also proven to have a long service life; by 1993, roughly 440 of the 500 PC-6 Turbo Porters completed by that point were still in service.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the Central Intelligence Agency-controlled airline Air America operated up to 23 PC-6s at a time. Many of these were operated in the South-East Asia region, including South Vietnam during the Vietnam War. The type was used for various missions, including paradropping supplies to troops, passenger transport, psychological warfare, reconnaissance, prisoner conveyance, airborne radio relay, and other intelligence operations.

Since 1976, the Austrian Air Force has operated a fleet of 12 PC-6 Porters as the mainstay of their fixed-wing transport fleet; the type has been used in various support roles, including transport, search and rescue, firefighting, observation, target-towing and paradropping.
According to &quot;Flying&quot; magazine, around 40 per cent of all PC-6s in use in Europe during the early 1990s were being used by skydivers.

In 1996, during the First Congo War, Zaire&#x27;s president Mobutu Sese Seko hired Western European mercenaries (mostly French and Belgian) in an attempt to stop a Rwandan-led offensive. This contingent (part of the White Legion) was supported by a BAE Andover and a Pilatus PC-6B Turbo Porter transports and four Mil Mi-24 attack helicopters. The Porter was lost after colliding with a tall anthill which damaged the plane&#x27;s landing gear, causing it to crash-land just a few days after arriving in Zaire.

<text>Melicoccus is a genus of ten species of flowering plants in the family Sapindaceae, native to tropical regions of northern and western South America.

They are evergreen trees growing to tall, with alternate pinnate leaves with 4 or 6 opposite leaflets (no terminal leaflet). The fruit is a drupe. Several species, but principally &quot;M. bijugatus&quot;, are widely cultivated in their native areas and elsewhere in Central America and the Caribbean for their fruit.

Some species of the related genus &quot;Talisia&quot; are sometimes included in &quot;Melicoccus&quot;.

;Species
*&quot;Melicoccus antioquensis&quot; — Colombia
*&quot;Melicoccus aymardii&quot; — Venezuela
*&quot;Melicoccus bijugatus&quot; – Mamoncillo (Colombia, Venezuela)
*&quot;Melicoccus espritosantensis&quot; — eastern Brazil
*&quot;Melicoccus jimenezii&quot; — Dominican Republic
*&quot;Melicoccus lepidopetalus&quot; – Motoyoé or Yva Povo (Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay), Argentina
*&quot;Melicoccus novogranatensis&quot; — Colombia and Ecuador
*&quot;Melicoccus oliviformis&quot; — Mexico, Central and South America and Trinidad
*&quot;Melicoccus pedicellaris&quot; Suriname, French Guiana and Brazil
*&quot;Melicoccus petiolutatus&quot; — Peru

== Taxonomy ==
The genus &quot;Melicoccus&quot; was first described by Patrick Browne, an Irish doctor and botanist, in 1756. This description was based on &quot;M. bijugatus&quot; trees which were cultivated in Jamaica. In 1760, Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin described the first species in Browne&#x27;s genus, which he named &quot;M. bijugatus&quot;. In 1762 Linnaeus used a spelling variation of the name &quot;Melicocca bijuga&quot;. Over the next two centuries, Linnaeus&#x27; spelling variation was used in almost all publications. A proposal was made in 1994 to conserve &quot;Melicocca&quot; over &quot;Melicoccus&quot;, but the proposal was rejected, leading to a restoration of the original version of the name.

In 1888 German taxonomist Ludwig Radlkofer placed &quot;Melicoccus&quot; in the tribe Melicocceae together with eight other genera. In his monograph on the Neotropical members of the tribe (&quot;Talisia&quot; and &quot;Melicoccus&quot;) Pedro Acevedo-Rodríguez suggested that although &quot;Talisia&quot; and &quot;Melicoccus&quot; appeared to form a monophyletic group, the other (Old World) genera probably did not belong to the same lineage.

<text>Blighia is a genus of three species of flowering plants in the soapberry family, Sapindaceae. They are trees or large shrubs native to tropical Africa from Guinea east to Kenya, and south to Angola and KwaZulu-Natal. The fruit is partly edible, with the Ackee (&quot;B. sapida&quot;) being grown commercially for fruit production. The genus is named for Captain William Bligh (formerly of ), who brought samples back to England.

The species are evergreen trees growing to tall, with pinnate leaves. The flowers are produced in small panicles. The fruit is an oval capsule long containing three seeds, each surrounded by an edible fleshy yellow aril, and a thick, leathery orange or red skin; the fruit apart from the aril is very poisonous.

==Species==
3 species are accepted:
* &quot;Blighia sapida&quot; - Ackee

==Uses==
Several uses are recorded. The fruit of several species are edible, with &quot;P. cupana&quot; (Guaraná) being the most popular. Other species, notably &quot;P. yoco&quot; (Yoco), are used as herbal medicine for various treatments. The sap of some species, notably &quot;P. cururu&quot; is highly toxic, and is used as an arrow poison by Native American tribes in South America. Similarly, the long flexible stems of &quot;Paullinia pinnata&quot; are used to poison fish in shallow pools, as described by the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates in his book &quot;The Naturalist on the River Amazons&quot;.

<text>The United States District Court for the District of Montana (in case citations, D. Mont.) is the United States District Court whose jurisdiction is the state of Montana (except the part of the state within Yellowstone National Park, which is under the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Wyoming). The court is located in Billings, Butte, Great Falls, Helena and Missoula.

Cases from the District of Montana are appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (except for patent claims and claims against the U.S. government under the Tucker Act, which are appealed to the Federal Circuit).

The United States Attorney&#x27;s Office for the District of Montana represents the United States in civil and criminal litigation in the court.

==History==
The District of Montana was organized on February 22, 1889, by 25 Stat. 676, following Montana&#x27;s admission to statehood. Congress organized Montana as a single judicial district, and authorized one judgeship for the district court, which was assigned to the Ninth Circuit. A temporary second judgeship was added on September 14, 1922, by 42 Stat. 837, and was made permanent on May 31, 1938, by 52 Stat. 584. On July 10, 1984, by 98 Stat. 333, the third judgeship was authorized.

<text>John Gagliardi ( ; November 1, 1926 – October 7, 2018) was an American football coach. He was the head football coach at Saint John&#x27;s University in Collegeville, Minnesota, from 1953 until 2012. From 1949 to 1952, he was the head football coach at Carroll College in Helena, Montana. With a career record of 489–138–11, Gagliardi has the most wins of any coach in college football history. His Saint John&#x27;s Johnnies teams won four national titles: the NAIA Football National Championship in 1963 and 1965, and the NCAA Division III Football Championship in 1976 and 2003. Gagliardi was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 2006.

==Early life==
John Gagliardi was born to Ventura and Antonietta Gagliardi in Trinidad, Colorado, in 1926. He began coaching football at Trinidad Catholic High School in 1943, at the age of 16, when his high school coach was called into service during World War II. He was a player-coach his senior year of high school and continued to coach high school football at St. Mary&#x27;s High School while obtaining his college degree at Colorado College in Colorado Springs.

==College coaching career==
At the age of 22, with six years of high school coaching, Gagliardi was hired at Carroll College in Helena, Montana. In four seasons as head coach at Carroll, Gagliardi compiled a 24–6–1 record, winning three Montana Collegiate Conference championships. After the 1952 season, Gagliardi left Carroll for Saint John&#x27;s University in Collegeville, Minnesota.

Pro Football Hall of Fame player Johnny &quot;Blood&quot; McNally coached football at St. John&#x27;s from 1950 to 1952. On leaving the job he said &quot;Nobody can win at St. John&#x27;s.&quot;

In 60 seasons coaching the Saint John&#x27;s Johnnies, Gagliardi won a school and conference record 27 Minnesota Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (MIAC) titles and four national championships: in 1963 (at the Camellia Bowl),
1965, 1976, and 2003. His record at Saint John&#x27;s was 465–132–10, bringing his career college football mark to 489–138–11.

On November 8, 2003, Gagliardi broke the record for career coaching wins with his 409th victory, passing Grambling State&#x27;s Eddie Robinson. The 13,107 fans who witnessed the victory over Bethel at Saint John&#x27;s Clemens Stadium were the largest crowd in NCAA Division III history. The win also gave Saint John&#x27;s its 23rd MIAC championship and an automatic berth in the NCAA Division III playoffs. The Johnnies went on to win the national championship with a 24–6 victory over Mount Union.

In 1993, Jostens and the J Club of St. John&#x27;s University began awarding the Gagliardi Trophy annually to the most outstanding player in NCAA Division III. On August 11, 2006, Gagliardi and Florida State&#x27;s Bobby Bowden became the first active head coaches to be enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame. (Nevada&#x27;s Chris Ault had been inducted in 2002 and returned to coaching two years later.)

Gagliardi was known for his unique coaching approach, which he called &quot;Winning with No&#x27;s.&quot; He instructed his players not to call him &quot;coach&quot;, did not use a whistle or blocking sleds, prohibited tackling in practices, did not require his players to lift weights, and limited his team practices to 90 minutes.

Gagliardi announced his retirement from coaching on November 19, 2012. Gagliardi died on October 7, 2018, at the age of 91.

==Awards==
In 2003, Gagliardi received the Amos Alonzo Stagg Coaching Award from the United States Sports Academy. He won the 2007 Liberty Mutual Division III Coach of the Year. In 2009, Gagliardi won the Amos Alonzo Stagg Award from the American Football Coaches Association. Gagliardi received the National College Football Awards Association&#x27;s (NCFAA) Contributions to College Football Award in 2013. He was inducted into the National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics Hall of Fame in 2006, the Colorado Sports Hall of Fame in 2015, and Saint John&#x27;s University&#x27;s J-Club Hall of Honor in 2018.

<text>Ivan Nikolayevich Kramskoi (; – ) was a Russian Realist painter and art critic. He was an intellectual leader of the art movement known as the Peredvizhniki between 1860 and 1880.

==Life==

Kramskoi came from an impoverished petit-bourgeois family. From 1857 to 1863 he studied at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts; he reacted against academic art and was an initiator of the &quot;Revolt of the Fourteen&quot; which ended with the expulsion from the Academy of a group of its graduates, who organized the &quot;Artel of Artists&quot; (&quot;&quot;).

Influenced by the ideas of the Russian revolutionary democrats, Kramskoi asserted the high public duty of the artist, principles of realism, and the moral substance and nationality of art. He became one of the main founders and ideologists of the Company of Itinerant Art Exhibitions (or Peredvizhniki). In 1863–1868, he taught at the drawing school of a society for the promotion of applied arts. In 1871, ten years after Taras Shevchenko&#x27;s death, Kramskoi created a portrait of the poet that became widely popular. He created a gallery of portraits of important Russian writers, scientists, artists and public figures (Lev Nikolaevich Tolstoy, 1873, Ivan Shishkin, 1873, Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov, 1876, Mikhail Saltykov-Shchedrin, 1879, Sergei Botkin, 1880) in which expressive simplicity of composition and clarity of depiction emphasize profound psychological elements of character. Kramskoi&#x27;s democratic ideals found their brightest expression in his portraits of peasants, which portrayed a wealth of character-details in representatives of the common people.

In one of Kramskoi&#x27;s most well known paintings, &quot;Christ in the Desert&quot; (1872, Tretyakov gallery), he continued Alexander Ivanov&#x27;s humanistic tradition by treating a religious subject in moral–philosophical terms. He imbued his image of Christ with dramatic experiences in a deeply psychological and vital interpretation, evoking the idea of his heroic self-sacrifice.

Aspiring to expand the ideological expressiveness of his images, Kramskoi created art that existed on the cusp of portraiture and genre-painting (&quot;Nekrasov during the period of &#x27;Last songs,&#x27;&quot; 1877–78; &quot;Unknown Woman,&quot; 1883; &quot;Inconsolable grief,&quot; 1884; all in Tretyakov gallery). These paintings disclose their subjects&#x27; complex and sincere emotions, their personalities and fates. The orientation of Kramskoi&#x27;s art, his acute critical judgments about it, and his persistent quest for objective public criteria for the evaluation of art exerted an essential influence on the development of realist art and aesthetics in Russia in the last third of the nineteenth century.

Kramskoi was considered an eccentric for giving his works to customers in expensive frames and not charging money for it. He died from an aortic aneurysm while working at his easel, aged only forty-nine.

<text>Den Oudsten Bussen B.V. was a Dutch coachbuilder and components manufacturer. The company was founded in 1926 by a local carriage-builder, Marinus den Oudsten. Its headquarters were just outside the city of Woerden. It eventually ceased all activities after being declared bankrupt in 2002.

The company, which was family-owned, had a profound influence on public transport in the Netherlands from the 1960s right up until the late 1990s. It mainly built coaches and bodyparts for buses that were assembled on chassis made by DAF, Leyland, Volvo, and Iveco.

In 1986 one of the family members, Jan den Oudsten, acquired a Canadian bus manufacturer and renamed it New Flyer Industries Ltd.. Den Oudsten Bussen BV was considered a separate company and had no institutional relations with New Flyer Industries. The official emblems of both companies were nevertheless identical. The Dutch company also cooperated with manufacturer Nova Bus Ltd to introduce and manufacture low-floor buses in North America.

Many older models of Den Oudsten buses that are no longer used in the Netherlands were shipped to other countries, where they can still be seen on local public transport duties. Den Oudsten buses have been spotted as far afield as Poland, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Nigeria, Vietnam, Trinidad and Tobago, Romania and Cuba. These exports were sometimes repainted, while others retained their original Dutch advertisements, numberplates, or transport company emblems.

The eventual bankruptcy of the company is believed to have been caused by the increasingly competitive nature of the market. Its household effects were sold in a public auction in 2002; the most notable highlights were the company&#x27;s original 1962 Chevrolet Apache fire-engine and an unfinished prototype for its latest low-floor line.

Many bus enthusiasts in the Netherlands are attempting to preserve several of the old models for posterity.

<text>Bulb Records is a Michigan-based record label that was formed in 1993 by Peter Larson (now of the two-piece metal rock band 25 Suaves), and James Magas (now known simply as Magas).

The label had originally started putting out records by local Michigan avant-garde musical acts, but had later added extended its roster to nationally and internationally known artists.

==Artists==

*Andrew W.K.
*Wolf Eyes
*Deuce (singer)
*Couch
*Danse Asshole

*Mr. Quintron
*Forcefield

*Mindflayer
*Oakley Hall
*Black Elf Speaks
*Elvish Presley
*The USA Is A Monster
*King Brothers
*Galen
*Prehensile Monkeytailed Skink.
==Discography==
Bulb Records&#x27; first release was actually catalog number BLB-026. Larson and Magas chose this number to make it appear as though they had more records out at the time. This has resulted in many gaps in the Bulb catalog, and much confusion over release dates.

<doc id="915695" wikidata="Q368782" url="?curid=915695" title="LHA (file format)">
<text>LHA or LZH is a freeware compression utility and associated file format. It was created in 1988 by , a doctor, and originally named LHarc. A complete rewrite of LHarc, tentatively named &quot;LHx&quot;, was eventually released as &quot;LH&quot;. It was then renamed to &quot;LHA&quot; to avoid conflicting with the then-new MS-DOS 5.0 (&quot;load high&quot;) command. The original LHA and its Windows port, LHA32, are no longer in development because Yoshizaki is busy at work.

Although no longer much used in the west, LHA remained popular in Japan until the 2000s. It was used by id Software to compress installation files for their earlier games, including &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;. Because some versions of LHA have been distributed with source code under the permissive license, LHA has been ported to many operating systems and is still the main archiving format used on the Amiga computer, although it competed with LZX in the mid-1990s. This was due to Aminet, the world&#x27;s largest archive of Amiga-related software and files, standardising on Stefan Boberg&#x27;s implementation of LHA for the Amiga.

Microsoft released the Microsoft Compressed (LZH) Folder Add-on, which was designed for the Japanese version of Windows XP. The Japanese version of Windows 7 ships with the LZH folder add-on built-in. Users of non-Japanese versions of Windows 7 Enterprise and Ultimate can also install the LZH folder add-on by installing the optional Japanese language pack from Windows Update.

==Compression methods==
In an LZH archive, the compression method is stored as a five-byte text string, e.g. . These are the third through seventh bytes of the file.

===Canonical LZH===
LHarc compresses files using an algorithm from Yoshizaki&#x27;s earlier LZHUF product, which was modified from LZARI developed by , but uses Huffman coding instead of arithmetic coding. LZARI uses Lempel–Ziv–Storer–Szymanski with arithmetic coding.

;lh0
:No compression method is applied to the source data.
;lh1
:This method is introduced in LHarc version 1.
:It supports 4 KiB sliding window, with support of maximum 60 bytes of matching length. Dynamic Huffman encoding is used.
;lh2
:lh1 variant. This method supports 8 KiB sliding window, with support of maximum 256 bytes of matching length. Dynamic Huffman encoding is used.
;lh3
:lh2 variant with Static Huffman.
;lh4, lh5, lh6, lh7
:Methods 4, 5, 6, 7 support 4, 8, 32, 64 KiB sliding window respectively, with support of maximum 256 bytes of matching length. Static Huffman encoding is used. lh5 is first introduced in LHarc 2, followed by lh6 in LHA 2.66 (MSDOS), lh7 in LHA 2.67 beta (MSDOS). LHA itself never compresses into lh4.
;lhd
:Technically it is not a compression method, but it is used in .LZH archive to indicate that the compressed object is an empty directory.

===Joe Jared extensions===
Joe Jared extended LZSS to use larger dictionaries.

;lh8, lh9, lha, lhb, lhc, lhe
:Dictionary (sliding window) sizes are 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, 2048 KiB respectively.

Jared ported LZH to Atari. The fact that lh8 is the same as lh7 was an oversight. Files using larger numbered methods may as well not exist, as Jared only considers them planned features.

===UNLHA32 extensions===
UNLHA32.DLL uses its own method for testing purposes.

;lhx
:It uses 128–256 KiB dictionary.

===PMarc extensions===
These compression methods are created by PMarc, a CP/M archiver created by Miyo. The archive usually has a .PMA extension.

;pc1
:PopCom compressed executable archive. Details unknown.
;pm0
:No compression method is applied to the source data.
;pm1
:8 KB sliding window, static huffman. Seldom generated, decompressor is reverse-engineered.
;pm2
:lh5 variant, 4K sliding window.
;pms
:Used to indicate PMarc self-extracting archive. Should be skipped to reveal the real format.

===LArc extensions===
LArc uses the same file format as .LZH, but was written by Kazuhiko Miki, Haruhiko Okumura and Ken Masuyama, with extension name &quot;.LZS&quot;. The program seems to have come before LZH. It uses a binary search tree in the LZ matching.

;lzs
:It supports 2 KiB sliding window, with support of maximum 17 bytes of matching length.
;lz2
:It is similar to lzs, except dictionary size and match length can be changed. 
;lz3
:Unknown.
;lz4
:No compression method is applied to the source data.
;lz5
:It supports 4 KiB sliding window, with support of maximum 17 bytes of matching length.
;lz7
;lz8
:Unknown.

Common implementations appear to only support lzs, lz5, plus the storage-only lz4.

==Issues==
===LHICE/ICE===
There are copies of LHICE marked as version 1.14. According to Okumura, LHICE is not written by Yoshizaki.

===Y2K11 bug===
Because of a bug, DOS time stamps from Level 0 and 1 headers after the year 2011 will be set to 1980, meaning that some utilities need to be patched. This is caused by a bug that interprets the unsigned 7-bit year number bitfield as a 5-bit number. The maximum year should be 2107 instead.

The newer Level 2 and 3 headers use a 32-bit Unix time instead. It suffers from the Year 2038 problem.

===Header size===
According to Micco, the author of a popular LHA library UNLHA32.DLL, many LHA implementations do not check for the length of LHA file headers when reading the archive. Two problems could emerge from this scenario: a buffer-overrun may occur for naive implementations assuming a 4KB max size from the original specification; antivirus software may skip over files with such large headers and fail to scan for a virus. A similar problem exists with ARJ. Micco reported this problem to Japanese authorities, but they do not consider it a valid vulnerability.

Micco went so far to conclude the development of UNLHA32 and advise people to give up on the format. Nevertheless, they came back in 2017 to fix a DLL hijacking issue.

<doc id="915700" wikidata="Q1610085" url="?curid=915700" title="Landing helicopter assault">
<text>Landing helicopter assault (LHA) is the United States Navy&#x27;s hull classification symbol for the general-purpose helicopter-carrying amphibious assault ships of the &quot;Tarawa&quot; and &quot;America&quot; classes.

Their purpose is to project power and maintain presence by serving as the cornerstone of the amphibious ready group or expeditionary strike group. They are used to transport Fleet Marine Force personnel and equipment while operating in a deployed marine expeditionary unit (MEU) or marine expeditionary brigade (MEB). They normally travel in task forces called &quot;amphibious ready groups&quot;. These ships and their escorts are capable of anything from military landing operations to humanitarian operations.

These vessels are built with a full flight deck similar in appearance to an aircraft carrier to operate utility and attack helicopters. They can also operate tilt rotor aircraft such as the MV-22 Osprey and STOVL aircraft such as the AV-8 Harrier and the F-35B Lightning II.

The Tarawa-class LHAs provided the Marine Corps with a means of ship-to-shore movement by helicopter in addition to movement by landing craft. They were the first ships designed to do both things efficiently at the same time.

The first two ships of the new &quot;America&quot; class, LHA-6 and LHA-7, differ from both the older &quot;Tarawa&quot;-class LHAs and LHDs in that they have no well deck; LHA-8 and following ships include well deck facilities. LHAs that contain a well deck are able to support the use of landing craft, air cushions (LCACs) and other watercraft.

Three Tarawa Class LHAs were active during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Since then, LHAs have participated in US Navy operations as launch platforms for Marine Corps expeditionary forces into Afghanistan during Operation Enduring Freedom (2001/02), Iraq in Operation Iraqi Freedom (2003) and humanitarian support after the tsunami in 2004. In 2004, LHAs were used to transport marines and their equipment to Iraq and Afghanistan for combat operations.

<text>A tikkun or tiqqun () is a book used by Jews to prepare for reading or writing a Torah scroll. There are two types of tikkun, a &quot;tikkun kor&#x27;im&quot; and a &quot;tikkun soferim&quot;.

==Tikkun qor&#x27;im==

A &quot;tikkun kor&#x27;im&quot; or &quot;tiqqun qor&#x27;im&quot; (readers&#x27; &quot;tikkun&quot;) is a study guide used when preparing to chant [lein] the Torah reading from the Torah in a synagogue. Each tikkun contains two renditions of the Masoretic Text in Hebrew. The right side of each page is written with the cantillation marks and vowel points, while the left is written in unpointed Hebrew, as it appears in the scroll. People who chant from the Torah must learn the tune and the pronunciation of the words beforehand, as the scroll itself has neither points nor cantillation marks, and because there are places where the word to be read (the &quot;qere&quot;) differs from that written (the &quot;kethib&quot;) in the scroll.

==Tikkun soferim==
A &quot;tiqqun soferim&quot; (scribes&#x27; &quot;tikkun&quot;) is similar, but is designed as a guide or model text for scribes writing a copy of the Torah by hand. It contains additional information of use to scribes, such as directions concerning writing particular words, traditions of calligraphic ornamentation, and information about spacing and justification. For instance, it helps the scribe to know how many letters there are per line, so a tikkun soferim gives the size of each line, measured in yud-widths (because yud is the smallest Hebrew letter).

<text>Mark Martin (born January 21, 1956) is an American cartoonist known for lighthearted humor and satire. He grew up in Leeds, Alabama.

==Career==
Martin&#x27;s first major work in the 1980s was &quot;Gnatrat&quot;, a parody of Batman, featuring a rat who dresses as a gnat to fight crime. He went on to work on the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; series, and created &quot;20 Nude Dancers 20,&quot; a long-running humor strip featured in &quot;Comics Buyer&#x27;s Guide&quot;.

As an editor, Martin created the anthology &quot;Hyena&quot; and briefly oversaw a humor section in &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;. He also edited the first edition of Scott McCloud&#x27;s &quot;Understanding Comics&quot;.

Martin then moved toward working almost exclusively in children&#x27;s comics, often for Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Nickelodeon Magazine&quot;, while producing other work for his website.

His collaborations with long-time friend Jim Woodring include the children&#x27;s series &quot;Tantalizing Stories&quot;, and several minicomics featuring their characters Frank and Montgomery Wart.

Martin is often mistaken for the race-car driver Mark Martin; this is a frequent subject of his comics in recent years.

<doc id="915720" wikidata="Q166604" url="?curid=915720" title="David S. Broder">
<text>David Salzer Broder (September 11, 1929 – March 9, 2011) was an American journalist, writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; for over 40 years. He was also an author, television news show pundit, and university lecturer.

For more than half a century, Broder reported on every presidential campaign, beginning with the 1956 United States presidential election between Dwight D. Eisenhower and Adlai Stevenson II. Known as the dean of the Washington, D.C. press corps, Broder made over 400 appearances on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. The &quot;Forbes Media Guide Five Hundred, 1994&quot; stated: &quot;Broder is the best of an almost extinct species, the daily news reporter who doubles as an op-ed page columnist...With his solid reporting and shrewd analysis, Broder remains one of the sager voices in Washington.&quot;

== Early life and education ==

David Salzer Broder was born to a Jewish family in Chicago Heights, Illinois, the son of Albert &quot;Doc&quot; Broder, a dentist, and Nina Salzer Broder.

He earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in liberal arts from the University of Chicago in 1947 and continued his studies there, receiving a master&#x27;s degree in political science in 1951. While at Chicago, he met fellow student Ann Creighton Collar, and they were married in Crawfordsville, Indiana, in 1951. They had four sons—George, Joshua, Matthew, and Michael—and seven grandchildren.

== Early journalism ==

Broder began working as a journalist while pursuing his master&#x27;s degree, serving as editor of &quot;The Chicago Maroon&quot; and later at the &quot;Hyde Park Herald&quot;. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1951, where he wrote for the newspaper &quot;U.S. Forces Austria (USFA) Sentinel&quot;, until he was discharged from the Army in 1953.

In 1953 Broder reported for &quot;The Pantagraph&quot; in Bloomington, Illinois, covering Livingston and Woodford counties in the central part of the state. From there he moved to the &quot;Congressional Quarterly&quot; in Washington D.C., in 1955, where he apprenticed under senior reporter Helen Monberg and got his first taste of covering congressional politics. During his four-and-a-half years at &quot;CQ&quot;, Broder also worked for &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a freelance writer.

In 1960 Broder joined &quot;The Washington Star&quot; as a junior political writer covering the presidential election that year between John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon. During his five years at the &quot;Star&quot;, he was promoted to a national political news reporter and was a weekly contributor to the paper&#x27;s op-ed page.

Broder left the &quot;Star&quot; for &quot;The New York Times&quot; in 1965, hired by well-known &quot;Times&quot; political reporter and columnist Tom Wicker to serve in its Washington bureau.

== &quot;The Washington Post&quot; columnist ==

After 18 months at &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Broder moved to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, where he would remain for over 40 years, beginning as a reporter and weekly op-ed contributor. Later, he was given a second weekly column. Broder&#x27;s columns were distributed initially through The Washington Post Wire Service and then later syndicated through The Washington Post Writers Group. More than 300 newspapers carried his columns for many years.

The longtime columnist was informally known as the dean of the Washington press corps and the &quot;unofficial chairman of the board&quot; by national political writers.

In May 2008, Broder accepted a buyout offer from The Washington Post Co., effective January 1, 2009, but continued to write his twice-weekly &quot;Post&quot; column as a contract employee. In a letter to the publications that ran his column, Broder said: &quot;This change will allow me to focus entirely on the column while freeing up the &quot;Post&quot; to use its budget for other news-section salaries and expenses.&quot;

In June 2008, Ken Silverstein, a columnist at &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, alleged that Broder had accepted free accommodations and thousands of dollars in speaking fees from various business and healthcare groups, in one instance penning an opinion column supporting positions favored by one of the groups. Deborah Howell, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;&#x27;s ombudsman at the time, wrote that Broder&#x27;s acceptance of speaking fees appeared to be a violation of the paper&#x27;s policy on outside speeches, as was the fact that some of the groups that paid Broder also lobby Congress. Howell pointed out that Broder said &quot;he had cleared his speeches with Milton Coleman, deputy managing editor, or Tom Wilkinson, an assistant managing editor, but neither remembered him mentioning them.&quot;

== Pulitzer Prize ==

Broder won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary in 1973 and was the recipient of numerous awards and academic honors before and after. In his Pulitzer Prize acceptance speech, Broder said:

== &quot;Meet the Press&quot; and other broadcast media ==

For many years Broder appeared on &quot;Washington Week&quot;, &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, and other network television and radio news programs. It was announced at the close of August 10, 2008, broadcast of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that Broder was celebrating his 400th appearance on that program, on which he first appeared July 7, 1963. He appeared far more often than any other person, other than the program&#x27;s hosts. The next closest person to Broder was Bob Novak, who had appeared on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; fewer than 250 times.

Broder was a weekly guest on XM/Sirius Satellite Radio&#x27;s &quot;The Bob Edwards Show&quot; starting in October 2004. On the premiere broadcast, Broder was joined by CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite as the program&#x27;s first guest. Broder also contributed to &quot;The Bob Edwards Show&quot; as a political commentator.

== Lecturer and author ==

In 2001 Broder became a lecturer at the University of Maryland&#x27;s Philip Merrill College of Journalism while continuing to write full-time at &quot;The Washington Post.&quot; He generally lectured one class a year on politics and the press, the class meeting at the newspaper. Merrill College Dean Thomas Kunkel described Broder as the nation&#x27;s &quot;most respected political journalist&quot; when he announced Broder&#x27;s hire. Broder also lectured at Duke University (1987–88).

He is author or co-author of eight books:
* &quot;Democracy Derailed: Initiative Campaigns and the Power of Money&quot; (Harcourt, 2000) 
* &quot;The System: The American Way of Politics at the Breaking Point&quot; with Haynes Johnson (Little, Brown and Company, 1996) 
* &quot;The Man Who Would be President: Dan Quayle&quot; with Bob Woodward (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1992) 
* &quot;Behind the Front Page: A Candid Look at How the News Is Made&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster 1987) 
* &quot;Changing of the Guard: Power and Leadership in America&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster, 1980) 
* &quot;The Party&#x27;s Over: The Failure of Politics in America&quot; (Harper and Row, 1972) 
* &quot;The Republican Establishment: The Present and Future of the G.O.P.&quot; with Stephen H. Hess (Harper and Row, 1967) 
* &quot;The Pursuit of the Presidency 1980&quot; with the staff of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; (Berkeley Books, 1980) 
* Authored the foreword for &quot;The Ticket-Splitter: A New Force in American Politics 1972&quot; Co-Authors: Walter DeVries and V. Lance Tarrance

== Death ==

Broder died of complications from diabetes on March 9, 2011, at the age of 81. Upon Broder&#x27;s death, President Barack Obama called him the &quot;most respected and incisive political commentator of his generation&quot;.

== Criticism ==

&quot;The New Yorker&quot;&#x27;s political commentator Hendrik Hertzberg called Broder &quot;relentlessly centrist.&quot; Frank Rich of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Broder as the nation&#x27;s &quot;bloviator in chief.&quot;

While on vacation, Broder would write his column from his retreat on Beaver Island, Michigan. Writing for &quot;Slate&quot;, Timothy Noah found Broder&#x27;s attempts to merge national affairs with summertime reflections &quot;mind-bendingly dull.&quot; Writing in the &quot;Washington City Paper&quot;, Jack Shafer felt that Broder managed to merge &quot;the cosmic and common in a stupefying slop of prose.&quot;

The left-wing blogger Atrios, a frequent critic of Broder&#x27;s work, coined the term High Broderism:We normally think of &quot;High Broderism&quot; as the worship of bipartisanship for its own sake, combined with a fake &quot;pox on both their houses&quot; attitude. But in reality, this is just the cover Broder uses for his real agenda, the defense of what he perceives to be &quot;the establishment&quot; at all costs.

== Depictions in popular culture ==

He earned substantial attention in two books chronicling the media&#x27;s coverage of the 1972 presidential campaign between Richard Nixon and George McGovern, including Timothy Crouse&#x27;s &quot;The Boys on the Bus&quot; and Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson&#x27;s &quot;Fear and Loathing: On the Campaign Trail &#x27;72&quot;.

Broder&#x27;s work was also cited in two autobiographies by key figures in the history of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;: &quot;Personal History&quot; by &quot;Post&quot; publisher Katharine Graham in 1997 and &quot;A Good Life: Newspapering and Other Adventures&quot; by &quot;Post&quot; executive editor Ben Bradlee in 1995. More recently, Broder was included in former &quot;Post&quot; columnist Dave Kindred&#x27;s 2010 book on the paper&#x27;s struggles in the changing media landscape: &quot;Morning Miracle: A Great Newspaper Fights for Its Life&quot;. Broder is also mentioned in President Bill Clinton&#x27;s biography &quot;First in His Class&quot; by David Maraniss.

Broder earned a place in works of fiction, meriting a mention by a White House senior staffer to fictional U.S. president Jed Bartlet (portrayed by actor Martin Sheen) on the NBC-TV series &quot;The West Wing&quot;, and in Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;The Post&quot;. In the 2018 film &quot;The Front Runner&quot;, he is portrayed by John Bedford Lloyd.

<text>The God Makers (1972) is a science fiction novel by Frank Herbert. Some later editions used a variant title, &quot;The Godmakers&quot;.

==Publication history==

The novel &quot;The Godmakers&quot; expands upon a storyline appearing in four short stories over a decade earlier:
* &quot;You Take the High Road&quot;. Appeared in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, May 1958;
* &quot;Missing link&quot;. Appeared in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; February 1959;
* &quot;Operation Haystack&quot;. Appeared in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot;, May 1959; and
* &quot;The Priests of Psi&quot;. Appeared in &quot;Fantastic Science Fiction Stories&quot;, February 1960.

==Plot summary==
The story focuses on Lewis Orne, an agent for a government agency which develops &#x27;lost planets.&#x27; After correctly identifying a warlike civilization on the planet Hamal, he is drafted into Investigative Adjustment (I-A), which manages dangerous planets. Under the auspices of I-A, he travels to various planets in order to maintain peace throughout the galaxy. At the same time, the priests of the planet Amel, who practice &#x27;religious engineering&#x27;, set about creating a god, something they have done numerous times before: We do not know from what creature or thing the god will be born&#x27;, the Abbod said. &#x27;It could be one of you. After resolving a number of dangerous situations, Lewis is injured and has a near-death experience. Following this, his psychic powers develop, and after passing a series of tests he becomes a god.

==Reception==

Colin Greenland reviewed &quot;The Godmakers&quot; for &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine, and stated that &quot;For all his ever-expanding cosmic perspective, Herbert still writes characters who look and sound as if they&#x27;d been cut off the backs of cornflake packets.&quot;

<text>Sheldon Jackson (May 18, 1834 – May 2, 1909) was a Presbyterian minister, missionary, and political leader. During this career he travelled about one million miles (1.6 million km) and established more than one hundred missions and churches, mostly in the Western United States. He performed extensive missionary work in Colorado and the Alaska Territory, including his efforts to suppress Native American languages.

==Youth, education, early career==
Sheldon Jackson was born in 1834 in Minaville in Montgomery County in eastern New York. His mother Delia (Sheldon) Jackson was a daughter of New York State Assembly Speaker Alexander Sheldon.

Jackson graduated in 1855 from Union College in Schenectady, New York, and from the Presbyterian Church&#x27;s Princeton Theological Seminary in 1858. That same year, he became an ordained Presbyterian minister and married the former Mary Vorhees.
He wanted to become a missionary overseas, but the Presbyterian board told the five foot tall Jackson, who had weak eyesight and was often ill, that he would be better suited for duty in the United States. He first worked in the north-central and western United States, which were still vast and lightly populated areas during the American Civil War and thereafter. Jackson&#x27;s first assignment was at the Choctaw mission in Oklahoma Territory, where he worked until poor health forced him to go back East in 1859.

After his recovery, Jackson was appointed to La Crescent in Houston County in southeastern Minnesota, where he extended his field hundreds of miles beyond the actual station. He spent ten years in Minnesota and Wisconsin, having organized or assisted in the establishment of twenty-three churches.

Jackson traveled as a missionary throughout the American West. With the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, a huge territory was opened to him. In the summer of 1869, Jackson went on a missionary tour using the railroad and stage lines, establishing a church a day.

==North to Alaska==

Jackson found his major life&#x27;s work in the new territory of Alaska. In 1867, US Secretary of State William H. Seward, during the administration of U.S. President Andrew Johnson, had negotiated the Alaska Purchase from Russia. The huge territory, with 20,000 miles of coastline, was initially called by many skeptics &quot;Seward&#x27;s Folly&quot;.

In 1877, Jackson began his work in Alaska. He became committed to the Protestant Christian spiritual, educational, and economic wellbeing of the Alaska Natives, according to his conception of well-being. He founded numerous schools and training centers that served these native people. At those schools, however, children were punished for speaking in their native languages. His protégés included Edward Marsden, a Tsimshian missionary among the Tlingit.

Jackson had considerable common ground with another important American in the region. Captain Michael A. Healy of the United States Revenue Cutter Service, commander of the USRC &quot;Bear&quot;, was also known for his concern for the native Alaskan Inuit. During this time, Captain Healy, primarily of European-American ancestry and the first person of African descent to command a U.S. ship, was essentially the law enforcement officer of the U.S. government in the vast territory. In his twenty years of service between San Francisco and Point Barrow, Healy acted as a judge, doctor, and policeman to Alaskan Natives, merchant seamen and whaling crews. His ship also carried doctors and provided the only available trained medical care to many isolated communities. The Native people throughout the vast regions of the north came to know and respect this skipper and called his ship &quot;Healy&#x27;s Fire Canoe&quot;. The &quot;Bear&quot; and Captain Healy reportedly inspired author Jack London, and are featured prominently, along with Jackson, in James A. Michener&#x27;s novel, &quot;Alaska&quot;.

Healy and Jackson became allies of a sort. During visits to Siberia (across the Bering Sea from the Alaskan coast), Healy had observed that the Chukchi people in the remote Asian area had domesticated reindeer and used them for food, travel, and clothing. Recognizing the decline in the seal and whale populations for native consumption because of growing commercial fishing activities, and to aid Eskimos in transportation, Jackson and Healy made numerous trips into Siberia and helped import nearly 1,300 reindeer to bolster the livelihoods of Native people. These became valuable tools in the provision of food, clothing and other necessities for Native peoples. This work was noted in the &quot;New York Sun&quot; newspaper in 1894.
Jackson was convinced that Americanization was the key to the future of Alaskan Natives. He discouraged the use of indigenous languages, traditional cultural practices, and spiritual celebrations. Because he was worried that Native cultures would vanish with no records of their past (a process which his own educational efforts accelerated), he collected artifacts from those cultures on his many trips throughout the region.

Jackson believed he could further his goals for the Alaskan natives through politics. He became a close friend of U.S. President Benjamin Harrison. He worked toward the passage of the Organic Act of 1884, which ensured that Alaska would begin to set up a judicial system and receive aid for education. As a result, Sheldon Jackson was appointed as the First General Agent of Education in Alaska.

==Education policy==
In 1885, Jackson was appointed General Agent of Education in the Alaska Territory. Concurrent with the values of the expanding colonial administration, Jackson undertook a policy of deliberate acculturation. In particular, Jackson advocated an English-only policy which forbade the use of indigenous languages. In allocating $25,000 of federal education monies in 1888 he wrote, &quot;[N]o books in any Indian language shall be used, or instruction given in that language to Indian pupils.&quot; In a letter to newly hired teachers in 1887 he wrote:
: It is the purpose of the government in establishing schools in Alaska to train up English speaking American citizens. &quot;You will therefore teach in English and give special prominence to instruction in the English language&quot;…. [Y]our teaching should be pervaded by the spirit of the Bible.&quot; (emphasis added)
The legacy of Jackson&#x27;s educational policy is clearly evident in the now precarious state of Alaska&#x27;s indigenous languages. His policy prohibiting indigenous languages in Alaska schools was enforced from 1910 to 1968. Decades of punishment for speaking Native languages resulted in greatly decreased transmission from one generation to the next, with the result that relatively few indigenous Alaskans speak Native languages in the 21st century.

In March 1885, Judge Ward McAllister Jr. ruled that the contracts Jackson had secured with Tlingit parents, giving up their children for a period of five years for a small sum of money, to be null and void. This greatly reduced the number of students at Jackson&#x27;s school. Jackson repeatedly sparred with McAllister and the district attorney, and mounted a campaign with President Grover Cleveland&#x27;s family members to have the officials dismissed. The president dismissed them between May and August 1885. In May 1885, Jackson was indicted by a grand jury of Russian-Tlingit creoles, in a controversy over land rights. Jackson then found himself in jail for several hours.

==Death and legacy==
Jackson died on May 2, 1909, in Asheville, North Carolina. He is interred in his hometown of Minaville, New York.

The former Sheldon Jackson College in Sitka, Alaska, was named after him. The Sheldon Jackson Museum, on the Sheldon Jackson College grounds, is the oldest concrete building in the state, and houses much of Sheldon Jackson&#x27;s collection as well as other examples of Tlingit, Inuit, and Aleut culture.

Sheldon Jackson Street is found in the College Village subdivision of Anchorage, a neighborhood next to the University of Alaska Anchorage campus where the streets are named for colleges and universities (the street forms a loop with Emory Street).

In 1874, while in Fairplay in Park County, Colorado, Jackson built the still standing Sheldon Jackson Memorial Chapel, renamed the South Park Community Church, a one-room Victorian Gothic structure, listed in 1977 on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Archival collections==
The Presbyterian Historical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, has a collection of Jackson’s correspondence, journals, photographs, photographs, scrapbooks, notebooks and miscellaneous indices and ephemera. Additional correspondence by Sheldon Jackson is also held at Princeton Theological Seminary.

Jackson’s personal papers include photographs by Eadweard Muybridge and H.H. Brodeck. The Presbyterian Historical Society also holds the Sheldon Jackson Library, which was Jackson’s personal library donated by him to the historical society. The Sheldon Jackson Museum in Sitka maintains three to four thousand Alaskan artifacts collected by Jackson during his lifetime.

<text>Sheldon Jackson College (SJC) was a small private college located on Baranof Island in Sitka, Alaska, United States. Founded in 1878, it was the oldest institution of higher learning in Alaska and maintained a historic relationship with the Presbyterian Church. The college was named in honor of Rev. Sheldon Jackson, an early missionary and educational leader in Alaska.

Due to declining enrollment, the college closed in 2007; four years later, ownership of its campus was transferred to the organization behind the Sitka Fine Arts Camp. In addition to the fine arts camp, the Sheldon Jackson Museum, the Sitka Sound Science Center, the Sitka Summer Music Festival, the Sitka International Hostel, Outer Coast College, and several other organizations are located in buildings on the campus of the former school. The school buildings are part of the Sheldon Jackson School National Historic Landmark District.

==History==
Similar to the Carlisle Indian School, Sheldon Jackson College (SJC) was initially formed as a &quot;training&quot; school for Alaska Native boys. The school was founded in 1878 by Fannie Kellogg and future Governor of Alaska John G. Brady for the Tlingit people. Initially known as the Sitka Industrial and Training School, it nearly closed in 1882 after its original facility, located over a military barracks, burned down. The Presbyterian missionary Sheldon Jackson came to the rescue of the school, raising funds through a national campaign, leading to the construction of a new building on the site of the present campus. In 1910, after Rev. Jackson died, the school was renamed in his honor.

The institution added a boarding high school in 1917, and a college program in 1944. The college program gained accreditation in 1966 and the high school was closed the following year.

===Closure===
The school&#x27;s educational accreditation was reviewed by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities and State of Alaska, a process that happens nationally with colleges and universities. About this process, President David Dobler said, &quot;SJC’s current authorization to operate as an Alaska post-secondary institution has been extended until July 2006, and SJC, at that time, will be required to provide the Alaska Commission on Postsecondary Education (ACPE) with documentation of financial and administrative capacity in order for authorization to be renewed.&quot; (Dobler left the office of President in 2002.) Similarly, the college was under a &quot;show cause&quot; order from the Northwest Commission and was required to &quot;show cause&quot; why its regional accreditation should not be revoked.

On June 29, 2007, all academic operations were suspended and all faculty and staff were dismissed due to cash flow shortages. The Board of Trustees gathered all staff and informed them that June 29 would be the final day of employment. They were also informed all health insurance coverage would cease at that time.

On July 17, 2007, the Alaska Commission on Post-secondary Education announced the cancellation of Sheldon Jackson College&#x27;s authorization to operate a college in Alaska. The college appealed the decision, but was ultimately shut down.

In March 2008, the official website for the school went off-line. In the summer of 2008, the college opened its dorms and facilities for use by local workers and companies.

In 2010 the school library collection of rare books and artwork was boxed and stored.

On February 1, 2011, the Board of Trustees transferred the main campus to Alaska Arts Southeast, Inc., the non-profit parent organization to the Sitka Fine Arts Camp.

Beginning in 2018, Outer Coast College students, professors and faculty members have been hosted on the main campus.

==Notable alumni==
* Benjamin A. Haldane Tsimshian photographer, musician, businessman
* Byron Mallott, Tlingit leader and rights activist, 12th Lieutenant Governor of Alaska
* Sandra Marbut, Head Coach of women&#x27;s basketball at California Institute of Technology
* Edward Marsden Presbyterian minister, Tsimshian activist
* Scott McAdams, mayor of Sitka, U.S. Senate candidate
* Elizabeth Peratrovich, civil rights activist
* Walter Soboleff, Tlingit scholar, Alaska Native Brotherhood Grand President Emeritus

==Architecture and historic designation==
The Sheldon Jackson Museum was the first building in Alaska built with concrete. Its octagonal shape may have been influenced by architectural philosophies of O.S. Fowler.. In 1972, the Sheldon Jackson Museum building was added as a single property to the National Register of Historic Places. 
The main campus buildings were designed by the, then just starting, firm of Ludlow and Peabody of Boston with aspects of western stick style. Beams were of Douglas fir and design was kept simple and exposed for easy construction and to demonstrate &quot;honesty in building&quot;.

The entire campus, comprising 18 contributing properties and 3 non-contributing buildings, was designated a National Historic Landmark District in 2001.

===Campus buildings===

==Stratton Library==
Stratton Library was an academic library at the college. Prior to the construction of the building the university&#x27;s collection was held in the Yaw Building. Prior to the 1955 construction of the Yaw Building, the books were held in a prefabricated army building that had been abandoned and moved onto campus in 1947. The Stratton library building contained 48,000 items in its collection with over 10 percent of all material being directly related to Alaska&#x27;s history, including many first edition books and rare periodicals. In December 2010 the collection was broken up. Rare glass plate photographic negatives were loaned to the National Park Service, other &quot;Alaskana&quot; was split among local public and academic libraries, and the remainder of the collection was offered for sale to the general public. The building itself was sold to the State of Alaska.

==Sheldon Jackson Museum==
The Sheldon Jackson Museum is a Native American museum located on the former campus of Sheldon Jackson College. Many of the artifacts were originally collected by Rev. Sheldon Jackson in his travels through rural Alaska. Sheldon Jackson Museum was founded in 1887, making it the oldest museum in the state of Alaska. When it outgrew its temporary quarters, a new specially dedicated concrete structure was constructed between 1895 and 1897 and, upon completion, became the first concrete structure built in Alaska.

The museum, collection, and grounds are owned and administered by the State of Alaska. Organized within the Alaska Department of Education &amp; Early Development, Division of Libraries, Archives and Museums, the Sheldon Jackson Museum was purchased by the State in the mid-1980s during the administration of Governor Bill Sheffield.

===Collection===
Over 5,000 artifacts are housed in the museum. 1,800 are on permanent display in the gallery. Over 3,000 of the objects were originally collected by Rev. Sheldon Jackson in his travels throughout Alaska. The museum&#x27;s collection exclusively focus on Alaskan Native groups such as the Aleuts, Athabascans, Eskimos, and Tlingit/Tsimshian.

An affiliated advocacy group, Friends of the Sheldon Jackson Museum, sponsors several museum programs including the Alaska Native Artist Residency Program during the summer months and the Share Your Culture/ Share Your Research speaker series during the winter.

<text>Tshering Choden (born 1 January 1979 or 6 July 1980) is an archer from Bhutan who competed at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics.
Choden entered the 2004 Summer Olympics with a world ranking of 176. She was one of two Bhutanese athletes taking part in the Games, the other being with fellow archer Tashi Peljor, and was selected as Bhutan&#x27;s flagbearer for the Games&#x27; opening ceremony. Choden began the women&#x27;s individual event with fifty-fourth place in the preliminary 72-arrow ranking round, scoring 600 points from 720. She delivered a surprise result in the opening elimination round with victory over China&#x27;s Lin Sang by a margin of three points, becoming the first Bhutanese archer ever to win a match at the Olympics. Choden faced India&#x27;s Reena Kumari in the second round, the pair posting identical scores of 134 points over the regulation eighteen arrows. On the subsequent tie-breaking arrow Kumari outscored Choden by seven points to four. Choden blamed her nerves for shooting so low.

Choden retired from archery in 2005 but returned to the sport as a coach in 2007. She coached the only Bhutanese archer at the 2012 Olympic Games, Sherab Zam.

She appeared in the 2004 Arte documentary &quot;Die Bogenschützin von Bhutan&quot;.

<doc id="915748" wikidata="Q2832406" url="?curid=915748" title="Alectryon (plant)">
<text>Alectryon is a genus of about 30 species of trees and shrubs from the family Sapindaceae. They grow naturally across Australasia, Papuasia, Melanesia, western Polynesia, east Malesia and Southeast Asia, including across mainland Australia, especially diverse in eastern Queensland and New South Wales, the Torres Strait Islands, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Vanuatu, Fiji, Samoa, Hawaii, Indonesia and the Philippines. They grow in a wide variety of natural habitats, from rainforests, gallery forests and coastal forests to arid savannas and heaths.

Mainland Australia, especially the eastern Queensland and New South Wales rainforests and the monsoon tropics, harbours the global centre of &quot;Alectryon&quot; species diversity, having 15 species, 12 of them endemic to Australia. In the continent of, combined New Guinea including Papua New Guinea and West Papua, Australia and all of their continental islands, including the Torres Strait Islands, known collectively in biogeography as the Sahul continent, lives the even greater diversity and endemism of 21 and 19 species, respectively.

==Conservation==

&quot;Alectryon macrococcus&quot; scarce remaining small trees across the Hawaiian islands and in both its varieties, have obtained the &quot;critically endangered&quot; species global conservation status of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

In Australia:
* &quot;A. ramiflorus&quot; small trees only remain naturally growing in a very restricted area of southeastern Queensland, thus they have obtained the &quot;endangered&quot; species global conservation status of the IUCN (1998) and 2013 national and state conservation statuses of the Australian and Queensland governments.
* &quot;A. repandodentatus&quot; small trees in northeastern Qld, the Torres Strait Islands and New Guinea have obtained the &quot;vulnerable&quot; species global conservation status of the IUCN (1998), and the Queensland state government&#x27;s 2013 &quot;endangered&quot; species conservation status.
* &quot;A. semicinereus&quot; small trees in eastern Qld have obtained the Qld government &quot;near threatened&quot; species conservation status.

==Naming and classification==

German botanist Joseph Gaertner formally named and described this genus and the New Zealand type species &quot;A. excelsus&quot; in 1788.

The name &quot;Alectryon&quot; is derived from Greek word for &quot;rooster&quot;. This refers to the cockscomb appearance of aril on the fruit. See also: Alectryon (mythology)

During the 1800s German–Australian botanist Ferdinand von Mueller published formal scientific descriptions of numerous Australian species under the now synonym genus name &quot;Spanoghea&quot;. In 1879 Bavarian botanist Ludwig A. T. Radlkofer published updates of numerous species to names within &quot;Alectryon&quot;. In 1988 Pieter W. Leenhouts published a revision of the genus across Malesia.

Its closest relative is &quot;Podonephelium&quot; from New Caledonia.

==Description==
Species height varies form low shrubs to trees of 30 m. Their leathery leaves may be simple or pinnate foliage. Small flowers, form usually at the ends of the stems. Fruiting follows, when ripe each fruit opens along a rough–edged split revealing a seed, often black, surrounded by a fleshy aril, often red. These juicy aril appendages attract birds and other seed dispersing animals.

<text>Ham Lin̄i Vanuaroroa (born 8 December 1951) is a ni-Vanuatu politician. He is a former MP from Pentecost Island in Penama Province. He was Prime Minister of Vanuatu from 11 December 2004 until 22 September 2008, and is the current Deputy Prime Minister since 16 May 2014. Lin̄i is the brother of Walter Lin̄i, one of the founders of the modern Republic of Vanuatu. Ham Lin̄i is the current leader of the National United Party (VNUP).

== Prime Minister of Vanuatu ==
The VNUP became the largest party in parliament in the July 2004 parliamentary elections, with 10 of 52 seats. Ham Lin̄i became a candidate for prime minister, but was defeated by Serge Vohor, though Lin̄i also had the support of the largest faction of the Vanua&#x27;aku Pati, led by outgoing Prime Minister Edward Natapei. He continued to dispute the results and lead the opposition to the Vohor government until 20 August 2004, when Vohor and Lin̄i formed a National Unity Government, in which Vohor remained prime minister and Lin̄i became deputy prime minister and minister of internal affairs.

In December 2004, Vohor was ousted after only a few months in office in a no confidence vote for unilaterally establishing relations with Taiwan (Republic of China), and Lin̄i was elected Prime Minister by the Parliament. One of Lin̄i&#x27;s first actions after taking office was the re-establishment of full diplomatic relations with the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

On 21 March 2006, Lin̄i survived a no confidence vote in Parliament by a vote of 30 to 20. The opposition, led by former prime minister Serge Vohor, had accused the Lin̄i government of weaknesses from a controversial proposal to monopolize kava exports. The Opposition had believed that some parliament members who had supported the government would defect, but few did.

Lin̄i and Vanuatu&#x27;s council of ministers declared a state of emergency for the capital city of Port Vila in March 2007 following tribal clashes between people from the islands of Tanna and Ambrym. The clashes, which took place in Blacksands squatter settlement area on the outskirts of Port Vila, killed two people. The fighting broke out when people from Tanna alleged that an Ambrym man used black magic to harm a Tannese person.

== Subsequent political career ==
Lin̄i failed to gain a second term as prime minister after his National United Party suffered losses in Parliament during the general election held on 2 September 2008, although he was re-elected to his own parliamentary seat. Edward Natapei of the Vanuaku Pati narrowly defeated his nearest opponent, Maxime Carlot Korman, leader of the Vanuatu Republican Party, with 27 to 25 votes in Parliament in a vote three weeks later on 22 September, succeeding Lin̄i as prime minister.

Natapei pledged to continue many of Lin̄i&#x27;s policies and incorporate them in his new government. These included anti-corruption measures, transparency, political stability and good governance. Natapei named Lin̄i to his cabinet as Minister of Infrastructure and Public Utilities on 22 September 2008.

In Natapei&#x27;s first reshuffle Lin̄i was given the post of Minister of Justice &amp; Social Welfare whilst remaining as Deputy Prime Minister. However, in Natapei second major cabinet reshuffle, which took place in November 2009, Lin̄i was removed as Deputy Prime Minister and replaced by Sato Kilman. Natapei had learned that Lin̄i&#x27;s Vanuatu National United Party and the Vanuatu Republican Party were planning a vote of no confidence measure against him. In response to the no confidence plan, Natapei sacked half his cabinet members, including Lin̄i, and removed the Vanuatu National United Party and the Vanuatu Republican Party from his cabinet, replacing them with sixteen members of the opposition.

Ham Lin̄i returned to government when Sato Kilman became Prime Minister on 2 December 2010, having ousted Natapei in a parliamentary vote of no confidence. Kilman appointed Lin̄i Deputy Prime Minister, as well as Minister for Trade, Commerce, Industries and Tourism. Lin̄i held the position until 24 April 2011, when Kilman was in turn ousted in turn in a vote of no confidence, and replaced by Serge Vohor. Vohor did not appoint Lin̄i to his cabinet.

Three weeks later, however, on 13 May, Vohor&#x27;s election and premiership were voided by the Court of Appeal, and the Kilman government was restored, complete with Ham Lin̄i as Deputy Prime Minister. This lasted for only a month; on 16 June, the Kilman premiership was voided on constitutional grounds by the Supreme Court&#x27;s Chief Justice Vincent Lunabek, and Lin̄i lost office once more. He regained it on 26 June when Kilman was restored as prime minister by Parliament, and reinstated his Cabinet. Kilman&#x27;s government fell on 21 March 2013 when it lost the confidence of Parliament, and Lin̄i found himself in Opposition to Prime Minister Moana Carcasses Kalosil&#x27;s new government.

On 15 May 2014, Carcasses was ousted in a motion of no confidence. New prime minister Joe Natuman appointed Lin̄i his deputy prime minister and minister for trade and commerce. Lin̄i lost office on 11 June 2015 when the Natuman government was ousted in a motion of no confidence.

<text>Sandy Skoglund (born September 11, 1946) is an American photographer and installation artist. Her contributions to photography have advanced the medium as a form of conceptual art. She is well known for her intricately designed environments, which utilize painterly and sculptural techniques within staged and performative scenes. Photography critic Andy Grundberg notes that Skoglund&#x27;s work contains &quot;all the hallmarks of the new attitude toward photographs: they embrace blatant artificiality; they allude to and draw from an &#x27;image world&#x27; of endless pre-existing photographs, and they reduce the world to the status of a film set.&quot;

The impact of Skoglund&#x27;s juxtaposition of commercial aspects, dramatization, and conceptual art elements, is described by curator Marvin Heiferman, who explains that &quot;The work simmers down and reminds viewers of their smallness in a big, overdetermined world where consumer culture, nature, science, and their interior gyroscopes regularly spin out of control.&quot;

==Biography==
Skoglund was born in Weymouth, Massachusetts on September 11, 1946. She spent her childhood all over the country including the states Maine, Connecticut, and California. She studied both art history and studio art at Smith College in Northampton, Massachusetts, graduating in 1968. In 1967, she studied art history through her college&#x27;s study abroad program at the Sorbonne and École du Louvre in Paris, France. After graduating from Smith, Skoglund taught middle-school art in Batavia, Illinois for a year before attending graduate school at the University of Iowa, where she studied filmmaking, multimedia art, and printmaking. In 1971, she earned her Master of Arts and in 1972 a Master of Fine Arts in painting from Iowa. Skoglund was an art professor at the University of Hartford between 1973 and 1976.

Skoglund holds a faculty position at the Department of Arts, Culture and Media of Rutgers University–Newark in Newark, New Jersey.

In 1972, Skoglund began working as a conceptual artist in New York City. She taught herself photography to document her artistic endeavors, and experiment with the theme of repetition. She also become interested in advertising and high technology—trying to re-frame mass media aesthetics for a noncommercial purpose via combining the technical focus found in the commercial world and bringing that into the fine art studio. In an interview with curator Luca Panaro, she imparts that, &quot;Mixing of the natural and the artificial is what I do everyday of my life&quot;,&quot; and I hope that I am not alone in this process.&quot; 

== Artworks, style, and themes ==
Skoglund often creates compositions by building elaborate sets or tableaux, and embellishing them with carefully selected colored furniture and other objects, as well as live models. She then photographs the set. The works are characterized by a formidable amount of one particular object, painterly mark-making, and either bright contrasting colors or a monochromatic color scheme. Skoglund&#x27;s works are quirky and idiosyncratic, and as former photography critic for The New York Times Andy Grundberg describes, they &quot;evoke adult fears in a playful, childlike context&quot;.

Food and animals are common elements in Skoglund&#x27;s work. She explains the significance and allure to both food and animal imagery, stating that: &quot;I think of Food as a universal language. Everyone eats. For the camera, food has colors and textures that can be manipulated to fabulous effect. I love the childish behavior of sculpting and painting with food. Food as a material allows me to explore the boundaries between nature and artifice...In my works with animals, I like to ask: who is looking at whom? I am especially interested in exploring consciousness as seen from a non-human perspective. Animal life presents people with a relief from themselves.&quot;

Skoglund&#x27;s 1992 installation, &quot;The Cocktail Party&quot; and &quot;Raining Popcorn&quot; (2001) are indicative of her sentiments about using food as raw artistic material. Each playfully employs an extensive amount of popular snack foods in order to create fantastical scenes that also address popular culture and history. In &quot;The Cocktail Party&quot;, Cheez Doodles preserved in Epoxy resin are affixed to human models and inanimate living room objects to create rich textural surfaces and a palette of mostly orange, but with slivers of purple to create a complimentary color relationship. The piece is a witty commentary on the artificial nature of certain social gatherings.

&quot;Raining Popcorn&quot; (2001), draws on Skoglund&#x27;s experience living in Iowa, as a student at the University of Iowa, where she witnessed seemingly endless fields of corn. The work was commissioned by Grinnell College of Art in 2001, and was on view at the school&#x27;s art museum from June 1 through September 16, 2001. It depicts a woodland composition where live models and the surrounding environment are enveloped in starch white popcorn. Skoglund researched the history of popcorn in the Americas from its Indigenous and colonial use in celebrations and rituals, to its more recent association as a snack of leisure and entertainment. The resulting composition is indicative of corn&#x27;s complicated relationship to the history and progression of American culture.

The utilization of repetitive, process-oriented techniques began early on in Skoglund&#x27;s career. Her 1973 composition &quot;Crumpled and Copied&quot; was manifested by repeatedly crumpling and photocopying a piece of paper. &quot;The Holes in a Saltine Cracker&quot; (1974) portrays how self-regulating repetition influences an object&#x27;s aesthetic value. Photographing a single saltine cracker and then reproducing that image 77 times, resulted in a composition that became abstracted and obscured in accordance with the subtle mechanical shifts derived from the Xeroxing process.

In 1978, Skoglund expanded on this theme by producing a series of repetitive food item still life images. These photographs of food were presented in geometric and brightly colored environments so that the food becomes an integral part to the overall patterning, as in &quot;Cubed Carrots and Kernels of Corn&quot; (1978), with its checkerboard of carrots on a white-spotted red plate placed on a cloth in the same pattern.

One of Skoglund&#x27;s best known works, titled &quot;Radioactive Cats&quot; (1980), features life-size, bright green-painted clay cats running amok in a gray kitchen. An older man sits in a chair with his back facing the camera while his elderly wife looks into a refrigerator that is the same color as the walls. The cats were sculpted using chicken wire and plaster. The kitchen is furnished with used furniture Skoglund acquired, and the man and woman that Skoglund used as models were her neighbors at the time. The end product is a very evocative photograph. In a 2013 online forum by the Getty Center for Education in the Arts, Terry Barrett and Sydney Walker identified two viable interpretations of Radioactive Cats. The first is about social indifference to the elderly and the second is nuclear war and its aftermath, suggested by the artist&#x27;s title.

Her 1989 artwork, &quot;Fox Games&quot;, has a similar imaginative feel to &quot;Radioactive Cats&quot;. The composition envisions a restaurant scene where the tables, chairs, windows, chandelier, and food items are painted in grayscale. In the back corner of the dining room, two individuals are served by a waiter, while bright red foxes are depicted as being playfully in motion around the room.

Another well recognized composition of Skoglund&#x27;s, is a fantastical arrangement featuring numerous goldfish hovering above two people in bed late at night, called &quot;Revenge of the Goldfish&quot; (1981). The artwork was used as cover art for the Inspiral Carpets 1992 album, also titled &quot;Revenge of the Goldfish&quot;. &quot;Revenge of the Goldfish&quot; utilizes a variety of elements of art and design, including the juxtaposition of complementary colors, scale, and balance. All of these aspects contribute to the artworks&#x27; dramatic effect. The background consists of a monochromatic deep blue, which is reminiscent of both nighttime and the ocean. This blue is contrasted by bright orange goldfish floating through the room. Skoglund arranged the human models from a vantage point that makes their identities ambiguous to the viewer.

In 1985, Skoglund completed a series titled &quot;True Fiction One&quot;. The process of creating the series incorporated the photomontage technique. Skoglund began by taking photographs of candid street and domestic scenes in black and white, later adding color to them in the darkroom. Then she cut and pasted pieces of the photographs into collaged compositions and rephotographed them using an 8 by 10 large format camera. In 2005, she revisited the series, this time utilizing digital tools like Photoshop to alter the images. The revamped series of compositions is called &quot;True Fiction Two.&quot;

In 2002, Skoglund designed the men&#x27;s bathroom for the Smith College Museum of Art, as an installation called &quot;Liquid Origins, Fluid Dreams&quot;. For this unique setting, she created and arranged symbolic motifs on ceramic tile based on mythology and folklore.

In 2008, Skoglund began a series of nature themed artworks, titled &quot;The Project of the Four Seasons.&quot; The series includes &quot;Fresh Hybrid&quot; and &quot;Winter&quot;. &quot;Fresh Hybrid&quot; (2008) is an artificial landscape, where organic materials like blades of grass and bark are replaced by pipe cleaners and wool fibers. The making of &quot;Winter&quot; began through the familiar process of installation and photography, but Skoglund eventually decided to create a work that was fully rendered digitally. She notes that: &quot;With the theme of winter, I imagined snowflakes. Initially, I made them from clay, because I have experience with ceramics, and I liked the idea of fragility. I worked for two years on these, and then hated them. I experimented with materials. In the end I cut them digitally. In a certain sense, &quot;Winter&quot; is a completely digital work, but at the same time it exists physically.&quot;

In 2015, the Ryan Lee Gallery in New York City, presented a window installation of Skoglund&#x27;s 1979 work &quot;Hangers&quot;. The work was initially displayed at the Castelli Gallery. The composition of a man in yellow pajamas entering a dreamlike setting of rubber duckies, plastic chairs and blue plastic hangers arranged on a yellow wall, was created inside her former tenement studio on Elizabeth Street in lower Manhattan. Skoglund recreated the work as a site-specific installation that was prominently on view for anyone walking along the High Line, which is adjacent to Ryan Lee Gallery&#x27;s window display. Every Saturday during the installation&#x27;s run, a performer meandered around the space.

== Collections and exhibitions ==
&quot;Revenge of the Goldfish&quot; was featured in the 1981 Whitney Biennial, as well being exhibited Saint Louis Art Museum in 1981. Photographs of the artwork have been on view and collected by several institutions including, Smith College Museum of Art, which also owns the original installation.

In 2000, the Galerie Guy Bärtschi in Geneva, Switzerland held an exhibition of 30 works by Skoglund. The photographs ranged her late 1970s series of plates on tablecloths to works from the 1980s and 1990s. A critic who reviewed the exhibition, Richard Leydier, commented that Skoglund criticism is littered with interpretations of all kinds, whether feminist, sociological, psychoanalytical or whatever. Skoglund has been nonchalant about how her work is read, while being forthcoming about the intent behind her work, saying, &quot;What is the meaning of my work? For me, it&#x27;s really in doing it.&quot;

Another career retrospective of Skoglund&#x27;s work was on view in 2019 at the Centro Italiano per la Fotografia in Turin, Italy. The title of the exhibition was &quot;Sandy Skoglund: Visioni Ibride&quot;, which translates to &quot;Hybrid Visions&quot;, a symbolic reference to her fusion of diverse media and imagery. The exhibition was curated by Germano Celant, who also published a comprehensive monograph on Skoglund&#x27;s work from the 1970s to the present (2019).

Skoglund&#x27;s works are held in numerous museum collections including The Whitney Museum of American Art, Brooklyn Museum, Denver Art Museum, the Museum of Contemporary Photography, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Montclair Art Museum, Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, McNay Art Museum, St. Louis Art Museum, the High Museum of Art, the Getty Museum, Colleges and Historic Deerfield Museum Consortium, Smith College, Grinnell College Museum of Art, and the Dayton Art Institute.

<text>Pimecrolimus is an immunosuppressant drug of the calcineurin inhibitor class used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema). 

It is available as a topical cream. It was developed and formerly marketed by Novartis under the trade name Elidel.

==Medical uses==
It has been proven to be effective in various inflammatory skin diseases, e.g., seborrheic dermatitis,
cutaneous lupus erythematosus,
oral lichen planus,
vitiligo,
and psoriasis.
Tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are both calcineurin inhibitors and function as immunosuppressants.

=== Atopic dermatitis ===
If topical corticosteroids and moisturisers fail in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, short-term treatment with topical calcineurin inhibitors such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus may be tried. Both tacrolimus and pimecrolimus are effective and safe to use in AD.

==Side effects==
In January 2006, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that Elidel packaging would be required to carry a black box warning regarding the potential increased risk of lymph node or skin cancer, as for the similar drug tacrolimus, whereas current practice by UK dermatologists is not to consider this a significant real concern and they are increasingly recommending the use of such new drugs.

Importantly, although the FDA has approved updated black-box warning for tacrolimus and pimecrolimus, the recent report of the American Academy of Dermatology Association Task Force finds that there is no causal proof that topical immunomodulators cause lymphoma or nonmelanoma skin cancer, and systemic immunosuppression after short-term or intermittent long-term topical application seems an unlikely mechanism.
Another recent review of evidence concluded that postmarketing surveillance shows no evidence for this systemic immunosuppression or increased risk for any malignancy.

A 2023 systematic review and meta-analysis published in &quot;The Lancet Child &amp; Adolescent Health&quot; further concluded with moderate-certainty evidence that the two drugs were not associated with any increased risk of cancer.
However, strong debates and controversies continue regarding the exact indications of immunomodulators and their duration of use in the absence of active controlled trials.
Dermatologists&#x27; and allergists&#x27; professional societies, the American Academy of Dermatology,
and the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, have protested the inclusion of the black box warning. The AAAAI states &quot;None of the information provided for the cases of lymphoma associated with the use of topical pimecrolimus or tacrolimus in AD indicate or suggest a causal relationship.&quot;

==Pharmacology==
Pimecrolimus is an ascomycin macrolactam derivative. It has been shown &quot;in vitro&quot; that pimecrolimus binds to FKBP1A and also inhibits calcineurin. Thus pimecrolimus inhibits T-cell activation by inhibiting the synthesis and release of cytokines from T-cells. Pimecrolimus also prevents the release of inflammatory cytokines and mediators from mast cells.

Pimecrolimus, like tacrolimus, belongs to the ascomycin class of macrolactam immunosuppressives, acting by the inhibition of T-cell activation by the calcineurin pathway and inhibition of the release of numerous inflammatory cytokines, thereby preventing the cascade of immune and inflammatory signals.
Pimecrolimus has a similar mode of action to that of tacrolimus but is more selective, with no effect on dendritic (Langerhans) cells.
It has lower permeation through the skin than topical steroids or topical tacrolimus although they have not been compared with each other for their permeation ability through mucosa. In addition, in contrast with topical steroids, pimecrolimus does not produce skin atrophy.

==Development and production==

Pimecrolimus was developed by Novartis. Its development number was ascomycin derivative &quot;ASM 981&quot;.

The New Drug Application (NDA) was filed December 15, 2000. It received US FDA approval on December 13, 2001.
At its US approval, it was one of the first new eczema treatments introduced since the topical corticosteroids of the 1950s. 
It is available as a topical cream, once marketed by Novartis. Since early 2007, Galderma has been promoting the compound in Canada. The trade name is Elidel.

<text>Push processing in photography, sometimes called uprating, refers to a film developing technique that increases the effective sensitivity of the film being processed. Push processing involves developing the film for more time, possibly in combination with a higher temperature, than the manufacturer&#x27;s recommendations. This technique results in effective overdevelopment of the film, compensating for underexposure in the camera. 

==Visual characteristics==
Push processing allows relatively insensitive films to be used under lighting conditions that would ordinarily be too low for adequate exposure at the required shutter speed and aperture combination. This technique alters the visual characteristics of the film, such as higher contrast, increased grain and lower resolution. Saturated and distorted colours are often visible on colour film that has been push processed. 

&quot;Pull processing&quot; involves overexposure and underdevelopment, effectively decreasing the sensitivity of the processed film. It is achieved by developing the film for a shorter time, and possibly at a lower temperature. Film that has been pull processed will display the opposite change in visual characteristics. This may be deliberately exploited for artistic effect.

==Exposure index==
When a film&#x27;s effective sensitivity has been varied, the resulting sensitivity is called the exposure index; the film&#x27;s speed remains at the manufacturer&#x27;s indication. For example, an ISO 200/24° film could be push processed to EI 400/27° or pull processed to EI 100/21°.

==In cinema==
Andy Warhol&#x27;s 1965 8-hour art film Empire, was shot on ASA 400 Tri-X 16mm film stock, which was then push processed to ASA 1000 to compensate for the dark conditions of filming the Empire State Building during the night.

John Alcott won an Oscar &quot;for his gorgeous use of natural lighting&quot; in Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s 1975 period film &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, set in the 18th century, where he succeeded in filming scenes lit only by candlelight through the use of special wide-aperture Carl Zeiss Planar 50mm f/0.7 lenses designed for the low-light shooting on NASA&#x27;s moon landings, and then push-processing the film stock.

Larry Smith, the cinematographer for Kubrick&#x27;s 1999 film &quot;Eyes Wide Shut&quot;, used push-processing to increase the intensity of the color.

Paul Thomas Anderson and Michael Bauman used this technique on their 35mm film stock for the 2017 film &quot;Phantom Thread&quot;, also filling its frames with &quot;theatrical haze&quot; to &quot;dirty up&quot; the look of the film.

<text>Lighthouse is a Canadian rock band formed in 1969 in Toronto, Ontario, whose repertoire included elements of rock music, jazz, classical music, and swing and featured horns, string instruments, and vibraphone. They won Juno Awards for Best Canadian Group of the Year in 1972, 1973, and 1974.

==Band history==
===Formation===
Lighthouse was formed in 1969 in Toronto by vocalist/drummer Skip Prokop, previously of the Paupers, and keyboardist Paul Hoffert. The two met on a flight from New York City to Toronto, and discussed forming a band structured around a rock rhythm section, jazz horn section, and classical string section. Prokop had admired Ralph Cole&#x27;s playing when they shared the bill at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit, so he invited him to Toronto to be the band&#x27;s guitarist. Prokop and Hoffert assembled the rest of the group from friends, studio session musicians, and Toronto Symphony Orchestra members, and proceeded to make a demo recording.

Prokop and Hoffert took the demo to MGM Records in New York, who signed the band. Two days later they had a manager, Vinnie Fusco, from Albert Grossman&#x27;s office, who overturned the MGM contract and made a deal with RCA Victor.

Lighthouse made its performing debut on May 14, 1969, at The Rock Pile in Toronto, introduced by Duke Ellington with the words, &quot;I&#x27;m beginning to see the Light...house&quot;. The band originally consisted of 13 members:
*Skip Prokop: drums and vocals
*Paul Hoffert: keyboards and vibraphone
*Ralph Cole: guitar and vocals
*Grant Fullerton: bass and vocals
*Vic &quot;Pinky&quot; Dauvin: percussion and lead vocals
*Ian Guenther: violin
*Don Dinovo: violin and viola
*Don Whitton: cello
*Leslie Schneider: cello
*Freddy Stone: trumpet and flugelhorn
*Arnie Chycoski: trumpet and flugelhorn
*Howard Shore: alto saxophone
*Russ Little: trombone
One of the first Lighthouse concerts was at Carnegie Hall, and in its first year the band also played at Fillmore East, Fillmore West, Toronto, Boston, the Atlantic City Pop Festival, and the Monterey and Newport Jazz Festivals. A free concert at Toronto City Hall in the summer of 1969 drew a reported crowd of 25,000.

===First albums===
Their first album, &quot;Lighthouse&quot;, was released in June 1969 by RCA recorded in RCA&#x27;s Toronto Eastern Sound Studio. It features &quot;If There Ever Was a Time&quot;, which was a minor hit on the popular Toronto radio station CHUM 1050.

Their next album, &quot;Suite Feeling&quot;, was released in November 1969, recorded at Toronto Eastern Sound Studio. It features two cover songs: The Band&#x27;s &quot;Chest Fever&quot; and The Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Day In The Life&quot;. The single &quot;Feel So Good&quot; was a hit, peaking at #5 on the Canadian Content chart and #55 on the Canadian Top 100. Lighthouse was invited to perform at Woodstock that year, but turned it down.

Their third and final album for RCA was also the last for original lead singer Pinky Dauvin. &quot;Peacing It All Together&quot; was recorded in RCA&#x27;s Music Centre of the World Hollywood Studios. It includes the Top 40 hit, &quot;The Chant&quot;.

In the summer of 1970, Lighthouse represented Canada and Ontario at Expo &#x27;70 in Japan. The band appeared at the Strawberry Fields Festival in August 1970, followed by the Isle of Wight Festival where they performed two nights, along with The Doors, Joni Mitchell, Chicago, Miles Davis, and The Who.

===New record label===
At the end of 1970, due to less than expected sales, Lighthouse was dropped from RCA and moved to Evolution in the US and GRT in Canada, recording at Toronto&#x27;s Thunder Sound Studios. There were some lineup changes; the band dropped from thirteen musicians to eleven, including five original members (Prokop, Hoffert, Cole, Dinovo, and Shore), and Bob McBride became the band&#x27;s new lead singer.

===&quot;One Fine Morning&quot; and commercial success===
In July 1971, Lighthouse released &quot;One Fine Morning&quot; on Evolution/GRT. The title track from &quot;One Fine Morning&quot; was a hit in Canada, peaking at #2 on Canada&#x27;s Singles Chart, eventually going platinum. The song was also an international and American hit, peaking at #24 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, going gold, and the &#x27;bubbling under&#x27; chart in the Netherlands. It was preceded on the Canadian charts by &quot;Hats Off to the Stranger&quot; (#9), yet another gold single. That year the band performed at the anniversary celebration concert in the city of Hamilton.

In between recording albums and touring 300 days a year, the band was involved in the first performances by a rock band with symphony orchestras, a collaboration with the Royal Winnipeg Ballet company, &quot;Ballet High&quot;, which toured across Canada, and a CBC production of &quot;Prometheus Bound&quot; with actress Irene Worth.

===&quot;Thoughts of Movin&#x27; On&quot;===
&quot;Thoughts of Movin&#x27; On&quot; was released on December 8, 1971. The lead single &quot;Take It Slow (Out In The Country)&quot; went to #12 on the Canadian Top 100, going gold. The album also features the hits &quot;I Just Wanna Be Your Friend&quot; (#54) and &quot;I&#x27;d Be So Happy&quot; (#32), the latter covered by Three Dog Night on their 1974 album &quot;Hard Labor&quot;. Both &quot;Thoughts of Movin&#x27; On&quot; and &quot;One Fine Morning&quot; eventually went platinum in Canada.

===&quot;Lighthouse Live!&quot; and &quot;Sunny Days&quot;===
&quot;Lighthouse Live!&quot; was recorded live at Carnegie Hall in February 1972 and released on Evolution/GRT. This was the first time a Canadian album went platinum.

The band returned to the studio later that year releasing another gold album, &quot;Sunny Days&quot;, on Evolution/GRT. The title track became the band&#x27;s second Top 5 Canadian hit single and second to go platinum. It was also a Top 40 hit on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at #34 on December 9, 1972. Hoffert, tired of life on the road, left the band shortly after but continued as the band&#x27;s executive producer.

During this period of recording from 1970 to 1972 with Evolution/GRT, RCA Records released a double album best-of in 1972 consisting of selections from the first three albums recorded with RCA entitled &quot;One Fine Light&quot;.

===&quot;Can You Feel It&quot;===
Bob McBride failed to appear at The Record Plant in New York City for the recording of their next album, &quot;Can You Feel It&quot;, and was fired. Prokop and Cole wanted to scrap the sessions but producer Jimmy Ienner insisted they continue. He decided that whoever wrote the song would sing it. Evolution sold the band&#x27;s recording contract to Polydor in the US, which reportedly cost the label &quot;six figures&quot;. With the exception of &quot;No More Searching&quot;, written and sung by new sax player Dale Hillary, Prokop and Cole sang all the vocals and harmonies on the album. The result was one of the band&#x27;s biggest single releases, &quot;Pretty Lady&quot;, which was a Top 10 Canadian hit, and was their final Hot 100 hit in the US, reaching #53. It did better in Hawaii however, where it reached #1 for six consecutive weeks. Both the album and the single went gold in Canada.

===&quot;Good Day&quot; and dissolution===
&quot;Good Day&quot;, also on Polydor, was released in mid-September 1974. As with the previous album, the lead vocals were divided between Skip Prokop and Ralph Cole, but Prokop switched to guitar full-time and the drummer was Billy King. The album went gold and produced a minor hit with the title track. It also contains &quot;Wide-Eyed Lady&quot;, a song co-written by Bob McBride.

At Thunder Sounds Recording Studios, the band began work on the next album, and had recorded several tracks when Prokop called it quits and left the band. The album was never completed.

Janus/GRT released &quot;Best of Lighthouse&quot; in January 1975 to capitalize on their past success. The album went gold in Canada.

Paul Hoffert recruited new members and Ralph Cole took the band out for another couple of tours with Doug Billard (formerly a member of Pepper Tree, Central Nervous System, and Five Sounds) as lead vocalist but in 1976 Lighthouse disbanded. Cole toured as Lighthouse once again from 1978 to 1980 with a nearly completely new lineup consisting of only one other previous Lighthouse member, Dale Hillary.

===Reunion===
Prokop, Hoffert, Cole, and McBride reunited along with many of the Lighthouse alumni in September 1982 for a weekend of four large concerts at Ontario Place. Afterwards the members went their separate ways and made no future plans.

In 1989, Denon Records bought the rights to the Evolution/GRT recordings and released a greatest hits collection in Canada, &quot;The Best of Lighthouse - Sunny Days Again&quot;. The re-mix of the album was produced by Hoffert, Cole, Prokop, and McBride.

In 1992, the band reunited with a ten-member line-up which included founders Prokop, Hoffert, and Cole with McBride on vocals. McBride was dismissed several months later. He was replaced by Dan Clancy.

Three years later &quot;Song of the Ages&quot;, the band&#x27;s first new studio album in 22 years, was released by Breaking Records. The single, &quot;Remember the Times&quot;, was a top-thirty hit in Canada. In 1998 the original master tapes of &quot;The Best of Lighthouse - Sunny Days Again&quot; were digitally re-mastered and released on CD by True North Records who also re-released &quot;Song of the Ages&quot; in 1999.

==After disbandment==
After Lighthouse disbanded in the 1970s, many of the members continued with their musical careers while some went in different directions.

Paul Hoffert has continued his career as a film composer, winning a Genie Award in 1978 for his score for the cult-hit movie &quot;Outrageous!&quot;; headed up the Ontario Arts Council from 1994 to 1997; created and was the Director of CulTech from 1992 to 2000, a Research Centre at York University, and has written five books exploring the intersection of culture and technology. In 2004 he received the Order of Canada.

Prokop and Cole formed other bands with some success before hitting their stride in the advertising world and as record producers. Saxophonist Howard Shore became the music director for &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and began a career in film composition, emerging as one of Hollywood&#x27;s most sought after composers. Shore won three Academy Awards for &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy. Don DiNovo bought a church in Arthur, Ontario, and turned it into a recording studio. Dick Armin continued his work as a creator of electronic string instruments.

Russ Little has continued as a musician and composer. He can be heard on numerous releases including his own albums, Snapshot, Footwork, and On the Shoulders of Giants. He was voted Best Trombonist of 2007 by Canada&#x27;s National Jazz Awards. John Naslen became a recording engineer (he engineered the 1994 Lighthouse &quot;Song of the Ages&quot; release). Grant Fullerton continues to perform with his own band.

Louie Yacknin opted out of music altogether and bought a tire installation company. Larry Smith moved to Israel and created a software company for language translation. Bob McBride became a top studio session singer and was heard on numerous commercials but he suffered from drug abuse and serious illness, and died February 20, 1998, of heart failure in Toronto.

Arnie Chycoski, Don DiNovo, Keith Jollimore, Alan Wilmot, Dale Hillary, Freddy Stone, Pinky Dauvin, Joe Ambrosia and Skip Prokop are all deceased.

Lighthouse has remained together since they reunited in 1992. Since that time they have recorded one new studio album, &quot;Song of the Ages&quot;, released in 1996. The rhythm section for the ten-member group features the original founders, Prokop (drums), Hoffert (keyboards and vibraphone), and Cole (guitar) with Don Paulton (keyboard), Doug Moore (bass), and Dan Clancy (vocals). The horn section is made up of original member, trombonist Russ Little, Simon Wallis (saxophones and flute), Chris Howells (trumpet), and saxophonist Steve Kennedy who performed with the band at Ontario Place in 1982. Lighthouse continues to perform and create innovative works including a reunion concert with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra that was broadcast nationally, a tour of Brazil with an original multimedia stage show in collaboration with the Desrosiers Dance Theatre, and a series of concerts in which sections of the band performed in different locations across Toronto linked together by broadband cable. In 1995 Lighthouse was inducted into the Q107 Canadian Rock ‘n’ Roll Hall of Fame.

Lighthouse songs have been used in films and covered by other artists including Three Dog Night, Shobha, and Carlos Santana. Rap artist Akon has sampled &quot;I&#x27;d Be So Happy&quot; and Japanese rock stars Theatre Brook perform &quot;One Fine Morning&quot; in their stage show.

==Recent activity==
For Lighthouse&#x27;s 40th anniversary, Ole/Universal Records released &quot;40 Years of Sunny Days&quot;, a retrospective of their biggest hits, featuring digitally remastered tracks, and a DVD of new performances recorded at Q Music in 5.1 Surround Sound.

On July 19, 2013, it was announced that the band would be appearing on the second annual Moody Blues Cruise in April, 2014 on the cruise ship MSC Divina.

In April 2013, Skip Prokop suffered from ventricular tachycardia. A device was implanted to regulate his heart. Prokop toured with Lighthouse throughout 2013 but was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, then suffered more heart trouble requiring bypass surgery. He officially retired from music in 2016 and died at the age of 73 on August 30, 2017, from heart complications. He was replaced by his son, Jamie Prokop.

The band&#x27;s most recent compilation album, &quot;Icon&quot;, was released on August 10, 2018.

They continue to perform and tour extensively across Canada.

<text>The British Dietetic Association (BDA) is a trade union for dietitians in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1936 and became a certified union in 1982. It is affiliated to the Trades Union Congress and the Scottish Trades Union Congress.

==History of Dietetics and the BDA==
Modern dietetics first began in the middle of the nineteenth century when Florence Nightingale observed the importance of diet and nutrition in warfare, during her time as a nurse in the Crimean War.

Following the appearance of the first dietitians in the United States at the start of the twentieth century, the first UK dietitians came from nursing sisters, then working in hospitals. The Edinburgh Royal Infirmary was the first hospital known to develop a dietetic department in 1924. The Infirmary launched the first dietetic diploma course around ten years after the creation of its dietetic department.

During this time, the BDA was formed - with their first meeting held on 24 January 1936 at St Thomas’ Hospital in London. The first chairperson was Margery Abrahams. Since then, BDA has grown into an internationally respected and valued organization.

==Organization and membership==
The BDA is a UK-wide membership organization representing over 11,000 dietitians and dietetic support workers. Members of the association may use the post-nominal MBDA. The association also awards fellowship status to member dietitians who have significantly contributed to the development of the field. Fellows use the post-nominal FBDA.

The BDA head office is in Birmingham. It has members from all four UK nations and some from overseas.

The majority of the BDA&#x27;s membership work in the National Health Service. Approximately one third of the membership work in other sectors, such as education, private industry, private practice and the media.

In the UK, &#x27;Dietitian&#x27; is a legally protected title. Unlike nutritionists and other food/nutrition titles, all dietitians are required to be educated to a certain level (a recognized UK degree level at least) and dietitians are the only food/nutrition professionals in the UK who must be regulated.

The BDA holds Patient Information Forum (PIF) TICK Certification. PIF TICK certification shows your information is produced to the highest possible standards, increasing public trust. Successful organizations can use the quality mark on materials to confirm that the information is from a reliable source.

==Campaigns==
The British Dietetic Association also administers the specialist register for dietitians and sports nutritionists (SENr) working with elite sportspeople.

In 2011, the BDA Chairman at the time, Helen Davidson, announced the creation of a brand new BDA national campaign. The aim of the campaign was to highlight levels of malnutrition in older people living in their own homes in the UK. Mind the Hunger Gap was deemed a great success with wide coverage and publicity across the UK, including advising the UL soap Emmerdale on a community malnutrition storyline in early 2013.

The BDA launched the campaign &#x27;Work Ready&#x27; in 2016, which aims to highlight work-based health.

The BDA has served as an advocate for consumers. In 2022, the BDA joined with other organizations calling for a halt to the sale of mislabelled baby food.

== Publications ==
The British Dietetic Association produces a monthly magazine called Dietetics Today. Its official journal is the &quot;Journal of Human Nutrition and Dietetics&quot;, which is published bimonthly by John Wiley &amp; Sons.

<doc id="915761" wikidata="Q190252" url="?curid=915761" title="Eastern European Time">
<text>Eastern European Time (EET) is one of the names of UTC+02:00 time zone, 2 hours ahead of Coordinated Universal Time. The zone uses daylight saving time, so that it uses UTC+03:00 during the summer.

A number of African countries use UTC+02:00 all year long, where it is called Central Africa Time (CAT), although Egypt and Libya also use the term &quot;Eastern European Time&quot;.

The most populous city in the Eastern European Time zone is Cairo, with the most populous EET city in Europe being Kyiv.

== Usage ==
The following countries, parts of countries, and territories use Eastern European Time all year round:

* Egypt, since 21 April 2015; used EEST (UTC+02:00; UTC+03:00 with daylight saving time) from 1988 to 2010 and 16 May – 26 September 2014. See also Egypt Standard Time.
* Kaliningrad Oblast (Russia), since 26 October 2014; also used EET in the years 1945 and 1991–2011. See also Kaliningrad Time.
* Libya, since 27 October 2013; switched from Central European Time, which was used in 2012. Used year-round EET from 1980 to 1981, 1990–1996 and 1998–2012.

The following countries, parts of countries, and territories use Eastern European Time during the winter only:

* Bulgaria, since 1894, except between 1942 and 1945
* Cyprus
* Estonia, in the years 1921–40 and since 1990
* Finland, since 1921
* Greece, since 1916
* Israel, since 1948 (see also Israel Standard Time)
* Latvia, in the years 1926–40 and since 1990
* Lebanon
* Lithuania, in 1920–40 and since 1990 with break 1998–1999
* Moldova, in the years 1918–40, 1941–44 and since 1991
** Including Transnistria
* Palestine (see also Palestine Standard Time)
* Romania
* Ukraine, in the years 1922–30 and since 1990

The following countries, parts of countries, and territories used Eastern European Time in the past:

* Moscow used EET in the years 1922–30 and 1991–92. 
* Belarus, in the years 1922–30 and 1990–2011
* Jordan used EET until permanently switching to DST in 2022.
* In Poland, this time was used in the years 1919–22.
* Crimea used EET as part of Ukraine between 1991–1994 and 1996–2014 and started using Moscow Time due to the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation in 2014.
* Syria used EET until permanently switching to DST in 2022.
* Turkey, used EET in the years 1910–1978 and re-used it again in the years 1985–2016.

Sometimes, due to its use on Microsoft Windows, FLE Standard Time (for Finland, Lithuania, Estonia, or sometimes Finland, Latvia, Estonia) or GTB Standard Time (for Greece, Turkey, Bulgaria) are used to refer to Eastern European Time.

==Anomalies==
Since political, in addition to purely geographical, criteria are used in the drawing of time zones, it follows that time zones do not precisely adhere to meridian lines. The EET (UTC+02:00) time zone, were it drawn by purely geographical terms, would consist of exactly the area between meridians 22°30&#x27; E and 37°30&#x27; E. As a result, there are European locales that despite lying in an area with a &quot;physical&quot; UTC+02:00 time, are in another time zone; likewise, there are European areas that have gone for UTC+02:00, even though their &quot;physical&quot; time zone is different from that. Following is a list of such anomalies:

===Areas outside UTC+02:00 longitudes using Eastern European Time (UTC+02:00) time===


==== Areas west of 22°30&#x27; E (&quot;physical&quot; UTC+01:00) that use UTC+02:00 ====
* The westernmost part of Greece, including the cities of Patras and Ioannina, and the Ionian Islands
* The very westernmost parts of the Bulgarian provinces of Vidin and Kyustendil
* The westernmost part of Romania, including most of the area of the counties of Caraș-Severin, Timiș (capital Timișoara), Arad, and Bihor, as well as the westernmost tips of the counties of Mehedinți and Satu Mare
* The extreme westernmost tip of Ukraine, near the border with Hungary and Slovakia, at the Ukrainian Transcarpathian Oblast (Zakarpattia Oblast), essentially comprising the city of Uzhhorod and its environs
* Most of the Kaliningrad Oblast, including the cities of Kaliningrad and Baltiysk
* Western Lithuania, including the cities of Klaipėda, Tauragė, and Telšiai
* Western Latvia, including the cities of Liepāja and Ventspils
* The westernmost parts of the Estonian islands of Saaremaa and Hiiumaa, including the capital of the Saare County, Kuressaare
* The southwestern coast of Finland, including the city of Turku; also the Åland islands (of Finnish jurisdiction) – the Åland islands are the westernmost locale applying EET in the whole of Europe
*Most of Libya including the capital Tripoli
*The western half of the munincipality of Enontekiö in northwestern Finland

Areas east of 37°30&#x27; E (&quot;physical&quot; UTC+03:00) that use UTC+02:00

* Eastern parts of Ukraine, including the city of Mariupol

=== Areas within UTC+02:00 longitudes (22°30&#x27; E – 37°30&#x27; E) using other time zones ===
==== Areas that use UTC+01:00 ====
These areas have sunrises and sunsets at least half an hour earlier than places on the UTC+01:00 meridian.

*The easternmost part of North Macedonia, including the city of Strumica.
*The absolutely easternmost part of Serbia, in the Pirot District, including the city of Pirot.
*The extreme easternmost tips of Hungary and Slovakia, bordering to the north and south respectively the Ukrainian Transcarpathian Oblast (Zakarpattia Oblast), a bit to the east of the Vásárosnamény, Hungary – Uzhhorod, Ukraine (both at 22°18&#x27; E) line
*The easternmost part of Poland, including the cities of Lublin and Białystok
*The extreme northeast of Sweden, in the Norrbotten province, including the cities of Kalix and Haparanda
*The northeast of Norway, lying north of Finland, roughly coinciding with the county of Finnmark. The easternmost town in Norway, Vardø, lies at 30°51&#x27; E, which is east of the central meridian of UTC+02:00, i.e. east of Istanbul and Alexandria. The Norwegian-Russian border and Belarus–Poland border are the only places where CET (UTC+1) borders Moscow time (UTC+03:00), resulting in a one (or two in winter) hour time change when crossing that border. There is a &quot;tri-zone&quot; point (where UTC+01:00, UTC+02:00, and UTC+03:00 meet) at the Norway-Finland-Russia tripoint, near the town of Rayakoski.

==== Areas that use UTC+03:00 ====
Most of the following countries use winter time year round, so they coincide with Eastern European Summer Time in summer.
* Belarus is between 23°11′E and 32°47′E and is thus fully within the physical UTC+02:00 area, but it uses UTC+03:00 year around.
* Practically all European Russia west of Moscow (except Kaliningrad Oblast); this includes the chunk of land from Murmansk all the way south to Belgorod, including the cities of St. Petersburg, Novgorod, and Pskov, to name only a few. (The westernmost point of contiguous Russia, near Lavry, Pskov Oblast, 27°19&#x27; E, is the westernmost point in European Russia where UTC+03:00 is applied.) This also includes the city of Anapa, at the westernmost tip of the Krasnodar Krai near the entrance to the Sea of Azov, at 37°22&#x27; E.
* Parts of western Syria, including the capital Damascus
* Most of Jordan, including the capital Amman
* Western half of Turkey, including the capital Ankara and the most populous city Istanbul

=== Tripoints and borders between zones ===
* The Norway–Russia–Finland &quot;tri-zone&quot; point at Muotkavaara (see Central European Time) is surrounded by three different times in winter, two in summer. It had three time zones year-around before 2014.
* Two of the four tripoints of Belarus and the tripoint of the Kaliningrad Region are surrounded by three different times in winter.

<text>Elpida Romantzi (born July 17, 1981 in Thessalonica) is an archer from Greece.

She placed 34th in the women&#x27;s individual ranking round with a 72-arrow score of 624 at the 2004 Summer Olympics. In the first round of elimination, she faced 11th-ranked Bérengère Schuh of France. Romantzi defeated Schuh, winning 151-143 in the 18-arrow match to advance to the round of 32. In that round, she faced Lee Sung Jin of Korea, losing to the 2nd-ranked and eventual silver medalist archer 166-146. Romantzi finished 31st in women&#x27;s individual archery. Romantzi was also a member of the 5th-place Greek team in the women&#x27;s team archery competition.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Romantzi finished her ranking round with a total of 614 points. This gave her the 49th seed for the final competition bracket in which she faced 16th seed Zekiye Keskin Satir in the first round, beating the archer from Turkey with 105-103. In the second round she was too strong for Kristine Esebua after both archers scored 102 points in the regular match and a 10-9 score in the decisive extra round. Romantzi was eliminated in the third round by first seed Park Sung-hyun with 115-103, with the 115 being a new Olympic Record.

<doc id="915786" wikidata="Q5158318" url="?curid=915786" title="Concentration (game show)">
<text>Concentration is an American television game show based on the children&#x27;s memory game of the same name. It was created by Jack Barry and Dan Enright. Contestants matched prizes hidden behind spaces on a game board, which would then reveal portions of a rebus puzzle underneath for the contestants to solve.

The show was broadcast on and off from 1958 to 1991, presented by various hosts, and has been made in several different versions. The original network daytime series, &quot;Concentration,&quot; appeared on NBC for 14 years, 7 months, and 3,770 telecasts (August 25, 1958 – March 23, 1973), the longest continuous run of any game show on that network. This series was hosted by Hugh Downs and later by Bob Clayton, but for a six-month period in 1969, Ed McMahon hosted the series. The series began at 11:30 am Eastern, then moved to 11:00 and finally to 10:30. Nearly all episodes of the NBC daytime version were produced at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City.

A weekly nighttime version appeared in two separate broadcast runs: the first aired from October 30 to November 20, 1958, with Jack Barry as host, while the second ran from April 24 to September 18, 1961, with Downs as host. The second version of &quot;Concentration&quot;, the first to be made in Southern California, ran in syndication from September 10, 1973, to September 8, 1978, with Jack Narz as host and Paola Diva as model. The last version of the show to air was &quot;Classic Concentration&quot;, which ran on NBC from May 4, 1987 to September 20, 1991. Alex Trebek was the host of this version, with Diana Taylor and Marjorie Goodson-Cutt as models.

==Development==

Veteran game-show host Jack Barry and his producing partner Dan Enright, along with Robert Noah and Buddy Piper, created &quot;Concentration&quot;, but others working at Barry &amp; Enright Productions also contributed to the show&#x27;s development. The full end credit roll after the NBC takeover had a title that read &quot;Based on a concept by Buddy Piper&quot;.

The creation involved the combination of two key creative concepts: the children&#x27;s game of matching cards also known as concentration, and the use of a rebus puzzle that was revealed as matching cards were removed from the board. In place of the playing cards, the game board featured a board consisting of 30 trilons, or three-sided motorized boxes, with numbers on the first of their three sides; prizes, that were to be matched, on the second; and &quot;puzzle places&quot; on the third. The gradual matching of card pairs slowly revealed elements of the rebus, a picture puzzle described below.
==Rebuses==

The rebus form is centuries old and has been used in various forms. The most popular contemporary form prior to &quot;Concentration&quot; involved pictures, letters and numbers as well as plus and minus signs to add or delete parts of a word or phrase. Norm Blumenthal developed the rebuses for the original series.

==Rules==
Two contestants (one usually a returning champion) sat before a board of 30 numbered squares. Each square was composed of a trilon that concealed a piece of the rebus, and either the name of a prize, or a special square.

One at a time, the contestants called out two numbers. If the prizes or special action did not match, the opponent took a turn. However, if the contestant did match, whatever prize was printed on the card was placed on a board behind the contestant; or, he/she could perform an action. A match also revealed two pieces of the rebus, which identified a person, phrase, place, thing, title, etc. The contestant could try to solve the rebus by making one guess or choose two more numbers. There was no penalty for a wrong guess; even if he/she was wrong, he/she kept control. Usually, a contestant waited to solve the puzzle until he/she had exposed a good portion of the rebus through several matches, but some contestants weren&#x27;t bashful about making a wild guess after the first match. In rare instances, the puzzle was solved with only a few clues showing: one contestant solved &quot;Night Court&quot; with two squares exposed and just the top of an apple core revealed.

Also included were two or three joke or gag prizes (such as a banana peel or a tattered sock). Over the years, the gag prizes included some creatively bad puns and wordplay. These actually served as protection against matching the forfeit cards upon which he/she might stumble.

===Special squares===
In addition to the prize cards, there were the following action cards:

* The Wild Card provided an automatic match. In the original game this left the natural match &quot;orphaned,&quot; only able to be matched by the other Wild Card, of which there were only two on the board. If the contestant matched the same prize to both Wild Cards, a check mark was placed next to the prize on the contestant&#x27;s board, and that contestant would win two of that prize if they solved the puzzle. Contestants uncovering both Wild Cards simultaneously also won a bonus that was theirs to keep regardless of the game&#x27;s outcome. Originally, this was $500 but late in the run was changed to a new car. Only one car was awarded to any contestant calling a double Wild Card. If a contestant called a double Wild Card a second time, they were awarded $500.
* Take One Gift: Appeared on two cards in each game. If a contestant matched them, he/she could take his/her choice of any of the prizes listed on their opponent&#x27;s prize board. Of course, the game had to be won to receive all prizes listed on his/her prize board.
* Forfeit One Gift: Appeared on six cards in each game. Any contestants who matched two of them had to forfeit one prize to their opponent.
* Bonus Number: Appeared on four cards in many games. If a contestant matched two of these cards and chose two numbers on a later turn that did not match, they were allowed to choose a third number. This was used only in the 1973–1978 syndicated edition hosted by Jack Narz.

===Solving the puzzle===
If a contestant solved the puzzle, he/she won all of his/her accumulated prizes. If there were no legitimate prizes in the rack, he/she was awarded $100. The loser forfeited all his/her gifts accumulated in that game, but still received token parting gifts as well as a copy of the show&#x27;s home game. There was no bonus round in the original version of the show.

Occasionally, a game ended with only two prize cards left on the board, which because of the wild cards often did not match. In such instances, the unmatched cards were turned over to reveal the entire puzzle, and the contestant who made the last match was allowed one guess to try to solve it first. If he/she guessed incorrectly, his/her opponent was allowed to make one guess. If both guessed incorrectly, the game ended in a draw. A new game was played and each contestant was allowed to carry over a maximum of three prizes.

Occasionally, a game could not be completed due to time constraints. A sequential two-tone sound resembling a doorbell would be heard signaling time was up for that episode, and play was suspended. Play would resume at the start of the following episode with the board reset to the point where time was called. A new rebus puzzle was substituted and the prizes remained the same, but were behind different numbers.

Champions continued until they either were defeated or had won 20 games.

==NBC (1958–1973)==
&quot;Concentration&quot; was originally slated to debut on NBC on July 28, 1958, but its debut ended up being delayed until August 25, 1958. &quot;Concentration&quot; was first hosted by Hugh Downs, who was also the announcer for &quot;Tonight Starring Jack Paar&quot; and working as one of the NBC Radio Monitor staff. &quot;Concentration&quot; was broadcast at the time that &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; had been aired; NBC moved &quot;Truth or Consequences&quot; to its afternoon schedule.

&quot;Concentration&quot; remains the longest-running game show on NBC and held the record for longest continuous daytime run on network television until it was eclipsed in March 1987 by the CBS daytime version of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; (beginning September 4, 1972). &quot;Concentration&quot; is currently the sixth longest-running daytime/syndicated game show behind &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; and the syndicated versions of &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot; (1983–present), &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; (1984–present), &quot;Family Feud&quot; (1999–present), and &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire&quot; (2002-2019).

&quot;Concentration&quot; was an NBC in-house production, apart from the earliest episodes. As a result of the 1950s quiz scandals, the network purchased the rights to &quot;Concentration&quot; and three other games (&quot;Twenty-One&quot;, &quot;Dough Re Mi&quot; and &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot;) from producers Barry and Enright. NBC/Universal still holds exclusive rights to both the format and extant episodes of &quot;Concentration&quot;; however, due to Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, this version is owned by CBS Media Ventures.

The show was produced and broadcast live at 11:30 am Eastern on weekdays in black-and-white, and quickly became the most-watched daytime series in NBC&#x27;s lineup. The announcer was Art James, who sometimes served as a substitute host and later became a game show host in his own right. The series was produced in NBC&#x27;s Studio 3A which now houses NBC News and MSNBC.

In 1958 and 1961, the show had two brief runs in prime time: one hosted by Jack Barry, the other by Downs.

The series then moved to 11:00 am and slowly introduced color broadcasts. For a picture puzzle game whose rebuses were designed and painted in monochrome, this required some design changes: The colors of the numbered cards might otherwise interfere with the colors used on the rebus, a critical issue for contestants playing in the studio and for viewers who played along at home. During this period, the series was produced in NBC&#x27;s Studio 6A. Hugh Downs, by this time also an anchor correspondent on NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today Show&quot;, remained host, and the announcer became Jim Lucas, who also worked on NBC&#x27;s local New York radio station, WNBC (AM). In September 1965, the show moved to 10:30 am where it would spend the remainder of its run on NBC. The show fully converted to color on November 7, 1966.

In January 1969, Downs stepped down to devote his entire attention to &quot;Today.&quot; Bob Clayton, who had succeeded Jim Lucas as announcer, took over the hosting duties; he was introduced as the new host at the program&#x27;s 1968 Christmas episode, dressed as Santa Claus. NBC staffer Wayne Howell moved to the announcer&#x27;s booth during Clayton&#x27;s tenure as host. However, in March, advertiser pressure led NBC to set Clayton aside in favor of Ed McMahon; after viewer complaints and declining ratings, Clayton returned in September and remained host until the series ended on March 23, 1973. (On the Monday following &quot;Concentration&quot;&#x27;s cancellation, Clayton became the announcer for &quot;The $10,000 Pyramid&quot; on CBS.)

===Special features===
Seen daily for nearly 15 years, and consistently one of the most popular series on NBC, the original series included many special features. Among the series&#x27; popular special features:

* The Envelope and its Mysterious Contents — The winning contestant opened a sealed envelope and read its message aloud (as if he/she were the show announcer). Generally, it mentioned an inexpensive prize and further reading proved it to be an expensive prize, such as large amount of cash or a new car.
* The Cash Wheel — A contestant spun a carnival wheel containing various dollar amounts with a top prize of $2,000.
* Christmas shows featured children from United Nations countries. Secret Santas included Joe Garagiola, Victor Borge, and other celebrities. Proceeds went to C.A.R.E., which built two schools in Africa from funds raised by the series (Blumenthal and Downs received awards from the organization for the proceeds).
* International Salutes – All prizes in these games were from the specific country saluted. For example, a salute to Mexico had contestants wearing sombreros, Downs dressed as a matador, and model Paola Diva playing a colorfully costumed señorita driving a mule-driven cart.
* An annual Boy Scout Show, saluting famous Americans who were scouts. Den Mothers and Scouts played the game and won prizes for themselves and their troops. Girl Scout shows also became an annual event.
* The Challenge of Champions – Beginning in 1963, &quot;Concentration&quot; inaugurated a tournament of champions, which pitted the top four contestants of the previous 12 months in a best-of-seven tournament (styled in a tournament similar to the World Series). The grand prize was $1,000, a trip around the world and a special trophy dubbed &quot;The Connie&quot;, modeled after Auguste Rodin&#x27;s &quot;The Thinker&quot;. One of the participants in the very first tournament was Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca, who won 17 games on the show.

Throughout the competition, participants, including Downs, Clayton, and Blumenthal, wore blue blazers with the show&#x27;s logo embroidered in gold on the breast pocket, a surrealistic amalgamation of all thirteen letters in the word &quot;Concentration&quot;; this was known as the &quot;Mystery Logo&quot;. The logo and the blazers continued to be a part of the host&#x27;s wardrobe until the network version of the show ended in 1973. The logo was not used in the syndicated version of the show (1973–78).

During another contest (c. 1970), home viewers could win a prize based on the initial of their last names corresponding to a number on the board. To enter the contest, one merely had to send a postcard to the address given. These postcards were placed in a rotary drum and Clayton would draw a card and read the name. If the prize card was for a gag prize or &quot;Forfeit 1 Gift&quot;, the home viewer received $100. If it was &quot;Take 1 Gift&quot;, a $250 prize was awarded. If it happened to be a Wild Card, the home viewer won $500. The contest was held at least once a week, and frequently with several drawings per show.

Through nearly all of the original series&#x27; run, the program was produced by Norm Blumenthal. He not only created every one of the 7,300 puzzles used on the show (with no repeated puzzles), but also every puzzle utilized in all 24 editions of the Milton Bradley home game.

===Prizes===
The prize values on the original series were deliberately much smaller than those of Barry and Enright&#x27;s other games, especially the big-money games (not just their own) implicated as part of the 1950s quiz show scandals. The winnings were kept at a low amount on purpose to avoid any suggestion that &quot;Concentration&quot; was also tainted. When the network took over production shortly after the series began in 1958, NBC maintained this policy, although this may have been for reasons unrelated to the scandals.

Usually, there was at least one prize worth more than $1,000. However, nearly all the other prizes were worth less than $500, with many in the $10–$100 range. A board of prizes rarely totaled more than $2,000–$3,000 and champions rarely took home more than that in merchandise during their stay (though some longer-reigning champions approached $10,000).

Additionally, there were countless gift certificates, travel trailers, airplanes, swimming pools, furniture, kitchen appliances (large and small), rooms of furniture, clothing, stereos and televisions, fantastic nights out on the town and virtually any other item seen in any mail-order catalog. One history of the original NBC version reported the total prize giveaway at $10,000,000.

===Cancellation===
For most of its run, &quot;Concentration&quot; faced sitcom reruns on CBS and local programming on ABC affiliates, easily dominating them in the ratings. However, in September 1972, CBS launched &quot;The New Price Is Right&quot; at 10:30/9:30 and drained off more than half of the &quot;Concentration&quot; audience. Rather than move the game, NBC concluded that it had reached the end of its life and cancelled it in March 1973.

While the first puzzle on the debut was &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, the last puzzle on the finale was &quot;You&#x27;ve Been More Than Kind&quot;. After Clayton said a final goodbye, the credits rolled over a rendition of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot;.

&quot;Baffle&quot;, a Merrill Heatter-Bob Quigley production hosted by Dick Enberg, replaced it at that time slot and ran until March 29, 1974.

==Syndication (1973–1978)==
Five months after NBC canceled &quot;Concentration,&quot; the network called upon Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions to produce a new edition of the series for syndication. This marked the first time Goodson-Todman was asked to produce a format owned by another production company; each of their previous productions were conceived by people on their own staff.

The new syndicated &quot;Concentration&quot; premiered on September 10, 1973, and ran for five years. Jack Narz was host, with Johnny Olson serving as announcer. This version of &quot;Concentration&quot; was produced at Metromedia Square in Hollywood, and aired primarily on NBC stations that had carried the original series. It was produced as a daily series but at the time, many game shows aired once per week in syndication and some stations airing &quot;Concentration&quot; aired it in this manner as well.

===Rules===
Two new contestants competed each day, with no returning champions; and games did not straddle episodes as on the network version (as some affiliates only broadcast the program one evening a week). For the first two years, the basic game was identical to the NBC version with the addition of four &quot;head starts&quot; that revealed half the locations of four prizes on the board. In addition, the gag prizes disappeared and only one pair of &quot;Forfeit 1 Gift&quot; cards remained; three pairs of &quot;Take 1 Gift&quot; cards were hidden on the board.

&quot;Concentration&quot;&#x27;s new board had become very colorful. The 30 numbers (now larger) were in red with yellow backgrounds and red frames and the mechanical trilons turned a little faster than in the NBC version. Many prize, Forfeit, Take, and Wild Card spaces had actually come from New York with the original board and were reverse-printed (white lettering on a black background). The rebus was in full color on a sky blue background.

The cash prize if a contestant solved the puzzle with no prizes on his/her side of the board was increased from $100 to $250. The bonus for calling two Wild Cards on the same turn reverted to $500 as opposed to a new car as last offered by NBC; the bonus was once again theirs to keep regardless of the game&#x27;s outcome. In addition, unlike in the original NBC version, the contestant no longer received the opportunity to match the wild card spaces and reveal four parts of the puzzle. While the same types of merchandise prizes were available, the syndicated series also featured prizes that would normally be consolation prizes on other shows (such as supplies of Rice-A-Roni or Bon Ami cleanser).

The first player to solve the rebus played the Double Play bonus round. If there were no more matching pairs left on the board, or if time was running short, the remaining boxes were turned over and the complete rebus revealed. The first player to buzz in with the correct solution won the game. If neither player solved the rebus, the Double Play round was not played for that particular game.

Later, four &quot;Bonus Number&quot; cards (eliminating one prize pair and one of the &quot;Take 1 Gift&quot; pairs) appeared during each game. If a contestant matched two Bonus Number cards or combined one with a wild card, then the next time they selected two numbers which failed to match, they were permitted to select a third number. If a match was made, the unmatched number would be turned back over unless it was a Wild Card.

If time permitted, a third game was played. This time, the object was to match amounts of foreign currency and no head starts were given. All of the special squares (Take 1 Gift, Bonus Number, Wild Card, etc.) remained on the board for this game. The first player to solve the rebus won $100 plus the amount of their currency matches in American dollars, and if time ran out during the game the same rules as noted above applied.

Beginning in the fall of 1975 and continuing through the spring of 1976, a series of changes were implemented to speed up game play. The &quot;Forfeit 1 Gift&quot; cards were removed from play and two more Wild Cards were added to the board, with the prize for matching them reduced to $250. The first game of each episode became a &quot;Three-Call&quot; game, in which a contestant who failed to make a match with his/her first two picks was allowed to call a third number. If this third pick was a Wild Card, the contestant could match it to either of the two already-revealed prizes. The Three-Call rule was later implemented in the second game as well. In addition, two &quot;Free Look&quot; spaces were added to the board during the first game; if one was uncovered, the contestant saw the piece of the puzzle behind it and got a free guess without having to match cards. All of the remaining original trilon cards were scrapped and replaced with new graphics. The rebuses were also made shorter and easier.

===Double Play===
The Double Play round was the first bonus round played on a &quot;Concentration&quot; series. The round was usually played twice per episode.

The winner of each game was tasked with solving two rebuses within ten seconds. After the audience and the viewers were shown the solution to the first rebus, the puzzle was shown to the contestant. If he/she solved it, the contestant won $100 and the clock stopped while the second rebus was set in place. The process then repeated itself, with the contestant needing to solve the second rebus before the clock hit zero. Doing so won a prize, which for the first four seasons was a new car. For the final season, a nine square board was used to determine the contestant&#x27;s potential prize(s). The car, along with three other prize packages, were available to choose from and the first prize the contestant matched was the reward for winning the round. The ninth space on the board concealed a wild card, which automatically matched any revealed prize(s) chosen before it; this allowed the contestant to play for more than one prize if there was more than one displayed on the board when the wild card came up.

If there was time left in the show for another round but not enough time to play the third game with the money amounts described above, a third Double Play round was played. Two rebuses were played, with each contestant playing one, and solving a rebus within ten seconds won the player that did so an extra $50.

The music for a Double Play win was later used on &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; during prize descriptions of a car. Many other cues from &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; were used on &quot;Concentration&quot; as well, including music used for the head starts and Double Play prize descriptions.

===Cancellation===

Despite these changes, the show&#x27;s ratings fell and many stations (including former flagship WNBC in New York) moved the show to either pre-dawn hours or other non-prime time access slots and dropped it in spring 1976. Some independent stations then picked up the show for its final two years.

On September 8, 1978, the second version of &quot;Concentration&quot; aired its final episode and left the airwaves, with the exception of several markets who opted to air reruns for an entire season until fall 1979.

===Buzzr===
On March 6, 2020, Buzzr announced that reruns of the Narz version, starting with 1976 episodes, would air on their network starting on March 30.

==&quot;Classic Concentration&quot; (1987–1991)==

In 1985, Mark Goodson Productions sought permission from NBC to relaunch &quot;Concentration&quot;. The new series, which eventually became known as &quot;Classic Concentration&quot;, debuted on NBC on May 4, 1987. Production was now done at NBC Studios in Burbank, California. Alex Trebek (who concurrently was also hosting &quot;Jeopardy!&quot;) hosted and Diana Taylor was the series&#x27; prize model. On July 22 of that year, Mark Goodson&#x27;s daughter, Marjorie Goodson-Cutt, replaced Taylor and remained for the entire series. Gene Wood was the announcer, with Art James substituting for him on the July 9–31, 1991 episodes. The new &quot;Concentration&quot; ran once again at 10:30 am EST and remained in that slot for its entire run. &quot;Classic Concentration&quot;″s final new episode aired on September 20, 1991, but reruns continued to air on NBC from October 28, 1991 until December 31, 1993.

===Gameplay===

====Main game====
This version featured a computer-generated game board with contestants viewing it on an off-screen rear-projection screen. The number of squares on the board was reduced from a 6×5 30-square layout to a 25-square layout in a 5×5 pattern.

Each game used up to three Wild Cards. Choosing two Wilds in one turn credits the contestant a $500 bonus, and if the third was chosen in the same turn, an additional $500 was credited. During a Twins Week on November 13, 1989, a second cash bonus was added to the board with the introduction of the &quot;Cash Pot&quot;, a progressive jackpot that started at $500 and increased by $100 each game it was not won. As with any other prize on the puzzle board, cash bonuses could only be won if the contestant solved the rebus. When a Wild card match was made, the natural match was also shown, resulting in three puzzle parts being revealed (or more if multiple Wild cards were found in one turn). The contestant who correctly solved the puzzle won the game and kept whatever prizes he/she matched to that point.

In the earliest episodes there were no &quot;Take 1 Gift&quot; cards on the board. On November 4, 1987, two green &quot;TAKE!&quot; squares were added; upon matching these, a contestant received a card that could be used to steal one prize from the opponent&#x27;s column. On February 2, 1988, two red &quot;TAKE!&quot; squares were put into play. In order to claim a &quot;TAKE!&quot; card, a contestant now had to match two squares of the same color. Unlike in previous versions of &quot;Concentration&quot;, a contestant did not have to use a card immediately after claiming it, but could wait and steal a desired prize after making a match at any later time during the round. However, unused cards did not carry over from round to round. The &quot;Forfeit 1 Gift&quot; cards from the previous versions were never used in the &quot;Classic&quot; version, having been eliminated for good during the previous syndicated series.

In the event time ran short during a game, any remaining prizes, Wild Cards and unclaimed/unused &quot;TAKE!&quot; cards were taken out of play and the puzzle was revealed one square at a time, in numerical order. The first contestant to buzz-in with a correct solution won the game. If incorrect, the contestant was locked out and the rest of the puzzle was revealed for the opponent to receive a free guess. If both contestants were incorrect and/or offered no guess, either of them could buzz in after Trebek began describing the puzzle, giving clues to the solution of the puzzle until one contestant guessed correctly.

====Bonus round====
The bonus round, dubbed the &quot;Winner&#x27;s Circle&quot;, was played for one of eight cars that were displayed in the studio. The contestant was shown a board of 15 numbered panels, behind which seven of the eight cars had matching pairs; the eighth was always used as a decoy. Contestants were given a base time of 35 seconds to play the round, with five seconds added for each time the round was not won. If a contestant made all seven matches before time ran out, they won the last car matched. Each time a car was won, the clock was reset to 35 seconds for the next round. On June 29, 1990, the format of the clock was changed so that new champions were given a base time of 35 seconds and were given an additional five seconds for each return to the bonus round until they won a car.

Early in the show&#x27;s run, a contestant could win the game and play the bonus round up to five times before being retired. Beginning on December 30, 1987, contestants were retired undefeated only after winning one car. From the premiere to June 28, 1990, contestants could win up to five matches.

Beginning on September 13, 1990, a bonus square called &quot;5 Bonus Car Seconds&quot; was added. Any contestant who had matched this prize and solved the puzzle earned five additional seconds in their next attempt at the bonus round.

===Returning champions===
In the beginning of the run, each match consisted of one game with the winner advancing to the bonus round. A losing contestant left with parting gifts except if their game was interrupted, in which case he/she would return for the first game on the next show.

On July 5, 1988, the show experimented with a best two-out-of-three match format during their special summer college student week, with the first contestant to solve two puzzles winning the match and playing the bonus round; the format became permanent on August 9, 1988. Unlike most game shows whose episodes tended to straddle playing a best two-out-of-three match, &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; had each match and bonus round fit into one complete episode. The first game was split over the first two segments, with the second and/or third game (if needed) taking up the third, and the bonus round played during the fourth.

From June 29, 1990 until the series finale, the game was changed once more to a &quot;two-strike&quot; format in which contestants were allowed to keep playing until they either won a car or lost two games, whichever came first. With this format, the show went back to playing the main game and the bonus round twice each day. In each half of the show, whichever contestant solved the puzzle went on to the bonus round while their opponent received a &quot;strike&quot; on a small box on top of his/her contestant podium (an illuminated gold square with a black X in the middle). If a contestant got two strikes (lost two games), they were eliminated from the game completely, but they still got to keep whatever cash and/or prizes they won up to that point, if any. This format was previously used briefly from March 15, 1988 to August 8, 1988.

===Audience Game===
If there was time remaining during some shows, an audience member preselected before taping began played the bonus round for up to $500. Instead of the names of cars, dollar amounts of $5, $10, $15, $20, $25, $50, $75, and $100 were hidden behind the 15 numbers. The audience member was given 60 seconds and kept the total of all amounts matched ($295 being the most that they could win without clearing the board), or $500 for clearing the board.

===Tournament of Champions===
For two consecutive years (April 1989 and November 1990, respectively), &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; held a week-long tournament of champions involving ten contestants who won cars in the fastest times of all the contestants who appeared on the show during each calendar year. They returned to compete for additional prizes on top of what they already won in their original appearances, as well as a second new car and a large cash bonus ($25,000 in the first tournament and $10,000 in the second). In both tournaments, each episode featured two different contestants that played for the entire half-hour. The main game was played the same way as it normally was, but the bonus round was played differently.

In the 1989 tournament, since the game was played as a best two-out-of-three match, the winner of each day&#x27;s game played the bonus round with the clock counting upwards from zero until he/she matched up the seven paired cars on the board. The contestant who completed the bonus round in the shortest length of time won the tournament and $25,000, and all contestants who made seven matches within 45 seconds won the last car they matched.

However, the 1990 tournament operated slightly differently due to the two-strike format (the strikes did not count during the tournament). The first contestant to play the bonus round during that week tried to make all seven matches as quickly as possible, with the clock counting upward from zero; for all subsequent bonus rounds, the clock counted down from that time. If a contestant completed the round in a shorter time, his/her result became the new time to beat. Only the contestant who posted the shortest time over the entire week won the car he/she had matched last and the $10,000.

In each tournament, all ten contestants got to keep whatever cash and/or prizes they won in the main game, regardless of who won the tournament.

==Home games==
The Milton Bradley Company introduced the first commercial version of &quot;Concentration&quot; in 1958 and subsequently released 24 editions of the game until 1982. Owing to common superstition, these releases were numbered 1–12 and 14–25, skipping 13. It was tied with &quot;Password&quot; as the most prolific of Milton Bradley&#x27;s home versions of popular game shows, and was produced well after the Jack Narz era ended in 1978 (albeit without ever including elements from that version).

Pressman Games published two editions of the &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; home game in 1988. More recently, Endless Games has released two versions of &quot;Concentration&quot; since 1998. The Endless versions were modeled similar to &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; home game with the rebuses designed by Steve Ryan, who created puzzles for &quot;Classic Concentration&quot;.

Two computer versions of &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; were released by Softie for MS-DOS systems, as well as the Apple II and Commodore 64. A Nintendo Entertainment System version was also released by GameTek. Tiger Electronics also marketed a hand-held version of the game in 1999 using the Narz-era theme and the 1960s–1978 logo.

There were also books based on the TV shows. Three issues for the original were released in 1971, written and designed by Norman Blumenthal. Each issue of this collection featured 36 rebus puzzles, 30 standard and six &quot;super puzzles&quot;.

In 1991, the book &quot;Classic Concentration: The Game, The Show, The Puzzles&quot;, written by the show&#x27;s puzzle designer Steve Ryan (and plugged on the air), was released. The book features 152 puzzles that were used on the show; the first 48 puzzles are exposed in their entirety, whereas the remaining 104 are first presented partially revealed on one page, then fully revealed on the next, with all puzzle solutions featured in the back of the book. The book also features a detailed history of &quot;Concentration&quot; and an introduction by executive producer Mark Goodson.

A video slot machine based on the 1958–1973 version was released for American casinos by Bally Gaming Systems.

In 2007, Reflexive Arcade released a downloadable version of &quot;Concentration&quot; based on the &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; format and bonus round with newer puzzles and prizes. In 2008, Glu Mobile released a mobile version of &quot;Concentration&quot; based on the PC downloadable version, with the look of the original 1958–1973 series.

==Episode status==
Some kinescope recordings of the 1958–1973 version are held at the Library of Congress. Shokus Video (a service specializing primarily in public domain offerings) offers a Hugh Downs-hosted tournament episode from 1967.

Buzzr currently airs episodes of &quot;Classic Concentration&quot; and, since March 30, 2020, episodes of the 1970s syndicated version, starting from episodes from 1976.

==International versions==
&quot;Concentration&quot; is one of only three Barry &amp; Enright game shows known to have foreign adaptations, the others being &quot;Tic-Tac-Dough&quot; and &quot;Twenty-One&quot;.

<text>Małgorzata Sobieraj, formerly Ćwienczek (2005–2011) (born 16 October 1982 in Strzelin) is a Polish archer. She represented Poland at the 2004 and 2008 Summer Olympics.

==2004 Summer Olympics==
Sobieraj represented Poland at the 2004 Summer Olympics under her maiden name. She placed 27th in the women&#x27;s individual ranking round with a 72-arrow score of 628. In the first round of elimination, she faced 38th-ranked Daw Thin Thin Khaing of Myanmar. Sobieraj defeated Daw Thin in a tight match, tying the score at 151 after the regulation 18 arrows and matching Daw Thin arrow for arrow through the three tie-breaking arrows. Sobieraj&#x27;s final arrow was slightly closer to the target, giving her the win and allowing her to advance to the round of 32. In that round, she faced Yuan Shu Chi of Chinese Taipei, losing to the 6th-ranked and eventual semifinalist archer 158-149 in the regulation 18 arrows. Sobieraj finished 29th in women&#x27;s individual archery. Sobieraj was also a member of the 15th-place Polish women&#x27;s archery team.

==2008 Summer Olympics==
At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing Ćwienczek finished her ranking round with a total of 645 points. This gave her the 13th seed for the final competition bracket in which she faced Louise Larsen in the first round, beating the archer from Denmark with 113-100. In the second round she came close, but was eliminated by 20th seed Mariana Avitia with 110-109. Together with Justyna Mospinek and Iwona Marcinkiewicz she also took part in the team event. With her 645 score from the ranking round combined with the 643 of Mospinek and the 620 of Marcinkiewicz the Polish team was in fourth position after the ranking round, which gave them a straight seed into the quarter-final. There they were beaten by the French team with 218-211. The French eventually won the bronze medal.

<text>This Type of Thinking (Could Do Us In) is the third studio album by American rock band Chevelle. Debuting at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 based on nearly 90,000 copies sold in its first week, it charted higher than its predecessor, &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot; but did not exceed its debut position. The album did not manage to match its predecessor&#x27;s commercial success, but was certified platinum. &quot;This Type of Thinking&quot; follows generally the same heavy style as &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot; with popular singles like &quot;Vitamin R&quot; and &quot;The Clincher&quot;. It would be the first of two records produced by Michael &quot;Elvis&quot; Baskette. This was also the final album that all of the Loeffler brothers involved together, following the departure of bassist Joe Loeffler from the band in 2005.

==Background and recording==
Coming off a highly successful major label debut, Chevelle finishing touring on December 17, 2003. They set out to write a follow-up album from scratch at the onset of the following year in what drummer Sam Loeffler described as a different approach to writing. He also noted how the band felt significant pressure from their label to not simply match but topple the platinum success of &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot;. In a 2004 interview, Loeffler described the process of approaching &quot;This Type of Thinking&quot;:
:&quot;We went home for Christmas and after New Year&#x27;s we went into the studio and we said, &#x27;All right, we have to write a whole record in basically four months.&#x27; We had no songs, so we had to write that whole record and we ended up taking five months. We wanted to go heavy, we wanted to do a lot of double-bass drum, kind of syncopated rhythms, and we wanted to basically write songs that we could bob our heads to. That was sort of where we started. We&#x27;re a heavy melodic rock band, that&#x27;s what we like to write, and that&#x27;s what we like to play. And that&#x27;s what we did.&quot;

This time around, Chevelle opted to produce their own album with the help of Michael &quot;Elvis&quot; Baskette. &quot;This Type of Thinking&quot; would continue the balance of melody and heaviness of its predecessor. And much like the final track on &quot;Wonder What&#x27;s Next&quot;, &quot;Bend the Bracket&quot; would be recorded simply as an acoustic demo for its unpolished presentation.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic editor Johnny Loftus observes the album as &quot;...flatly mixed, lost in depression, and obsessed with rewriting &quot;Sober&quot; for a new generation of lank-haired misunderstoods.&quot;

&quot;Melodic&quot; calls it &quot;...a real quality album that you will never get bored of.&quot;, praising the songs &quot;The Clincher&quot;, &quot;Vitamin R (Leading Us Along)&quot; and &quot;Another Know It All&quot;.

<text>Gérard Souzay (8 December 1918 – 17 August 2004) was a French baritone, regarded as one of the very finest interpreters of mélodie (French art song) in the generation after Charles Panzéra and Pierre Bernac.

==Background and education==

He was born Gérard Marcel Tisserand, but later adopted the stage name of Souzay from a village on the river Loire, now part of the commune Souzay-Champigny. He came from a musical family in Angers, France. His parents had met at one of the first performances of &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; in 1902; his mother and two brothers were singers, and his sister, 15 years older, was the soprano Geneviève Touraine, who gave the first performance of Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Fiançailles pour rire&quot; in 1942. After his schooling at the Collège Rabelais in Chinon, he went to the Sorbonne in Paris to study philosophy, and while there he met the singer Pierre Bernac, who encouraged him to study singing.

Souzay entered the Paris Conservatoire in 1940, studying with Claire Croiza and Jean-Emil Vanni-Marcoux. He actually began singing as a tenor, but in 1943, with advice from the leading operatic singer Henri Etcheverry, he became a baritone. He graduated from the Conservatoire in 1945 with two first prizes, the &quot;Prix de chant&quot; and the &quot;Prix de vocalise&quot;. While at the Conservatoire, he also tried his hand at composition and in 1942 three of his settings of poems by Paul Valéry were given a performance by Pierre Bernac. He went on to study voice with Bernac, although he subsequently expressed some differences with the latter&#x27;s methods and ideas on pronunciation. He was eager not to limit himself to being a specialist in the French repertoire, and he made a detailed study of German lieder with Lotte Lehmann.

==Career==
Gérard Souzay&#x27;s public appearances began in 1945 with recitals and concerts, including a performance of Fauré&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; in a centenary tribute to the composer at the Royal Albert Hall in London. He rapidly established an international career as a recitalist, admired not only in French music but also for his command of the German repertoire, especially Schubert and Schumann. In recital, his first accompanist was Jacqueline Bonneau (who had been his contemporary at the Paris Conservatoire), but she was reluctant to travel and from 1954 onwards he formed a close musical and romantic partnership with the American pianist Dalton Baldwin which continued for the rest of his career. 
The two completed three tours of Southern Africa (1958–1973) to wildly enthusiastic audiences
Souzay&#x27;s exceptional linguistic gifts enabled him to sing convincingly in 13 different languages including Hebrew, Portuguese and Russian. In contemporary music he performed in Honegger&#x27;s &quot;La danse des morts&quot; and in the world première of Stravinsky&#x27;s &quot;Canticum Sacrum&quot;. The composer Jacques Leguerney (1906–1997) wrote many songs for Souzay and for his sister. Souzay also sang Jocelyne Binet&#x27;s &quot;Cycle de Mélodies&quot; on seven poems by Paul Éluard in a 1955 recital program.

His operatic career began in 1947 in Cimarosa&#x27;s &quot;Il matrimonio segreto&quot; at the Festival d&#x27;Aix-en-Provence, but it was not until the late 1950s that he extended his stage work – though even then it did not take precedence over his recitals. His roles included Monteverdi&#x27;s Orfeo, Mozart&#x27;s Don Giovanni and Almaviva in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, Lescaut in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Manon&quot;, and Méphistophélès in Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;La Damnation de Faust&quot;. One of his favorite and most successful roles was Golaud in Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot;.

He did little operatic work after the 1960s, but continued his recital career, finally retiring from performance in the late 1980s. He spent the last years of his life giving master classes in the United States, Europe, and Japan: he was an inspiring teacher, preferring to work on phrasing and the mood of a song rather than French diction.

He was a keen abstract painter, and in 1983 he published a book &quot;Sur mon chemin: pensées et dessins&quot; in which a selection of his paintings was accompanied by his written commentary, on art and life. He died at his home in Antibes in the south of France on 17 August 2004.

==Recordings==
Gérard Souzay&#x27;s first recordings were made in 1944 with the sopranos Germaine Lubin and Geneviève Touraine. (These and some later ones with Elly Ameling were his only recorded duets.) He made other recordings in the 1940s for the small French company Boîte à Musique, and then signed a contract with English Decca. He subsequently recorded for Philips and EMI. A discography of his recordings has been published, listing over 750 titles He participated in complete recordings of the songs of Fauré and Poulenc. On three occasions he won the prestigious Grand Prix du Disque, including one for his recording of the songs of Ravel. Later in his career, he sought to disown his early recordings and to veto the radio from broadcasting them, preferring his later versions of some of the same works. Much to the relief of admirers of the smooth and beautiful quality of his younger voice, he was not widely heeded, and many of his early recordings have been re-released to considerable acclaim.

==Reputation==
While critics agree the size of the voice was often found wanting, Souzay&#x27;s musicianship, perfect diction, sense of style (particularly of the French &quot;mélodie&quot;) and detailed interpretation were never questioned, and found a perfect niche on the recital platform. When Gérard Souzay died he had only been a connoisseur&#x27;s delight, being somewhat forgotten by audiences and younger singers. On the other hand, the obituary notices were quick in recognising the importance of his contribution to 20th century singing. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; said that he &quot;rivalled Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau for the title of the greatest lyrical baritone of his age.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; described his voice as &quot;not huge, but rich in color and tone, supple and sensual and lovely.&quot; Souzay was &quot;a sensualist, reacting viscerally to the music and allowing it to carry him in new directions in a given concert.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; judged that &quot;the basis of his popularity in recital lay in his easily produced, vibrant, warm baritone. It was used by its owner with an innate sensibility and an unfaltering sense of style. His attractive art was founded, above all, on a very French approach, at once balanced and urbane, yet inwardly poetic.&quot;

In the 1950s, Souzay&#x27;s style of singing became the object of some unexpected criticism when it was cited by Roland Barthes in one of his essays in &quot;Mythologies&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;art vocal bourgeois&quot;. Referring to a recording of Fauré songs, Barthes complained that Souzay invested particular words with superfluous emotion by means of an exaggerated phonetic dramatisation, and that by imposing his own &quot;signs&quot; of emotion he stifled the meaning of the words and music. Not everyone has agreed with Barthes&#x27;s description of the style, let alone with the force of his argument, but these are strictures which would attach to many other singers besides Souzay and go to the heart of how vocal performance should be approached. (Indeed, some years later, Barthes made similar criticisms against the singing of Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.)

Souzay regarded himself as a romantic. Never analytical or detached in his performances, he said: &quot;For me music is limpid and speaks for itself. I can only offer my emotions when I sing&quot;.

<text>The Craig retroazimuthal map projection was created by James Ireland Craig in 1909. It is a modified cylindrical projection. As a retroazimuthal projection, it preserves directions from everywhere to one location of interest that is configured during construction of the projection. The projection is sometimes known as the [[Mecca]] projection because Craig, who had worked in Egypt as a cartographer, created it to help Muslims find their qibla. In such maps, Mecca is the configurable location of interest.

Given latitude &quot;φ&quot; to plot, latitude &quot;φ&quot; of the fixed location of interest, longitude &quot;λ&quot; to plot, and the longitude &quot;λ&quot; of the fixed location of interest, the projection is defined by:

:formula_1

But when &quot;λ&quot; − &quot;λ&quot; = 0, &quot;y&quot; above is undefined, so instead use the ratio&#x27;s continuous completion:

<doc id="915830" wikidata="Q917399" url="?curid=915830" title="Usher syndrome">
<text>Usher syndrome, also known as Hallgren syndrome, Usher–Hallgren syndrome, retinitis pigmentosa–dysacusis syndrome or dystrophia retinae dysacusis syndrome, is a rare genetic disorder caused by a mutation in any one of at least 11 genes resulting in a combination of hearing loss and visual impairment. It is the most common cause of deafblindness and is at present incurable.

Usher syndrome is classed into three subtypes (I, II, and III) according to the genes responsible and the onset of deafness. All three subtypes are caused by mutations in genes involved in the function of the inner ear and retina. These mutations are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern.
The occurrence of Usher syndrome varies across the world and across the different syndrome types, with rates as high as 1 in 12,500 in Germany to as low as 1 in 28,000 in Norway. Type I is most common in Ashkenazi Jewish and Acadian populations, and type III is rarely found outside Ashkenazi Jewish and Finnish populations. Usher syndrome is named after Scottish ophthalmologist Charles Usher, who examined the pathology and transmission of the syndrome in 1914.

==Types==
===Usher syndrome I===

People with Usher I are born profoundly deaf and begin to lose their vision in the first decade of life. They also exhibit balance difficulties and learn to walk slowly as children, due to problems in their vestibular system.

Usher syndrome type I can be caused by mutations in any one of several different genes: &quot;CDH23, MYO7A, PCDH15, USH1C&quot; and &quot;USH1G&quot;. These genes function in the development and maintenance of inner ear structures such as hair cells (stereocilia), which transmit sound and motion signals to the brain. Alterations in these genes can cause an inability to maintain balance (vestibular dysfunction) and hearing loss. The genes also play a role in the development and stability of the retina by influencing the structure and function of both the rod photoreceptor cells and supporting cells called the retinal pigmented epithelium. Mutations that affect the normal function of these genes can result in retinitis pigmentosa and resultant vision loss.

Worldwide, the estimated prevalence of Usher syndrome type I is 3 to 6 per 100,000 people in the general population. Type I is more common in people of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry (central and eastern European) and in the French-Acadian populations (Louisiana). Among Acadians, research into haplotype data is consistent with one single mutation being responsible for all cases of Usher syndrome type I.

===Usher syndrome II===

People with Usher II are not born deaf and are generally hard-of-hearing rather than deaf, and their hearing does not degrade over time; moreover, they do not seem to have noticeable problems with balance. They also begin to lose their vision later (in the second decade of life) and may preserve some vision even into middle age.

Usher syndrome type II may be caused by mutations in any of three different genes: &quot;USH2A, GPR98&quot; and &quot;DFNB31&quot;. The protein encoded by the&quot; USH2A &quot;gene, usherin, is located in the supportive tissue in the inner ear and retina. Usherin is critical for the proper development and maintenance of these structures, which may help explain its role in hearing and vision loss. The location and function of the other two proteins are not yet known.

Usher syndrome type II occurs at least as frequently as type I, but because type II may be underdiagnosed or more difficult to detect, it could be up to three times as common as type I.

===Usher syndrome III===
People with Usher syndrome III are not born deaf but experience a progressive loss of hearing, and roughly half have balance difficulties.

Mutations in only one gene, &quot;CLRN1&quot;, have been linked to Usher syndrome type III. &quot;CLRN1&quot; encodes clarin-1, a protein important for the development and maintenance of the inner ear and retina. However, the protein&#x27;s function in these structures, and how its mutation causes hearing and vision loss, is still poorly understood.

The frequency of Usher syndrome type III is significant only in the Finnish population as well as the population of Birmingham, UK, and individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish heritage. It has been noted rarely in a few other ethnic groups.

== Symptoms and signs==
Usher syndrome is characterized by hearing loss and a gradual visual impairment. The hearing loss is caused by a defective inner ear, whereas the vision loss results from retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a degeneration of the retinal cells. Usually, the rod cells of the retina are affected first, leading to early night blindness (nyctalopia) and the gradual loss of peripheral vision. In other cases, early degeneration of the cone cells in the macula occurs, leading to a loss of central acuity. In some cases, the foveal vision is spared, leading to &quot;doughnut vision&quot;; central and peripheral vision are intact, but an annulus exists around the central region in which vision is impaired.

==Cause==
Usher syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Several genes have been associated with Usher syndrome using linkage analysis of patient families (Table 1) and DNA sequencing of the identified loci. A mutation in any one of these genes is likely to result in Usher syndrome.

The clinical subtypes Usher I and II are associated with mutations in any one of six (&quot;USH1B-G&quot;) and three (&quot;USH2A, C-D&quot;) genes, respectively, whereas only one gene, &quot;USH3A&quot;, has been linked to Usher III so far. Two other genes, &quot;USH1A&quot; and &quot;USH2B&quot;, were initially associated with Usher syndrome, but &quot;USH2B&quot; has not been verified, and&quot; USH1A&quot; was incorrectly determined and does not exist. Research in this area is ongoing.

Using interaction analysis techniques, the identified gene products could be shown to interact with one another in one or more larger protein complexes. If one of the components is missing, this protein complex cannot fulfill its function in the living cell, and it probably comes to the degeneration the same. The function of this protein complex has been suggested to participate in the signal transduction or in the cell adhesion of sensory cells.

A study shows that three proteins related to Usher syndrome genes (PCDH15, CDH23, GPR98) are also involved in auditory cortex development, in mouse and macaque. Their lack of expression induces a decrease in the number of parvalbumin interneurons. Patients with mutations for these genes could have consequently auditory cortex defects.

== Pathophysiology ==
The progressive blindness of Usher syndrome results from retinitis pigmentosa. The photoreceptor cells usually start to degenerate from the outer periphery to the center of the retina, including the macula. The degeneration is usually first noticed as night blindness (nyctalopia); peripheral vision is gradually lost, restricting the visual field (tunnel vision), which generally progresses to complete blindness. The qualifier &quot;pigmentosa&quot; reflects the fact that clumps of pigment may be visible by an ophthalmoscope in advanced stages of degeneration.

The hearing impairment associated with Usher syndrome is caused by damaged hair cells in the cochlea of the inner ear inhibiting electrical impulses from reaching the brain. It is a form of dysacusis.

==Diagnosis==
Since Usher syndrome is incurable at present, it is helpful to diagnose children well before they develop the characteristic night blindness. Some preliminary studies have suggested as many as 10% of children with congenital severe to profound deafness may have Usher syndrome. However, a misdiagnosis can have bad consequences.

The simplest approach to diagnosing Usher syndrome is to test for the characteristic chromosomal mutations. An alternative approach is electroretinography, although this is often disfavored for children since its discomfort can also make the results unreliable. Parental consanguinity is a significant factor in diagnosis. Usher syndrome I may be indicated if the child is profoundly deaf from birth and especially slow in walking.

Thirteen other syndromes may exhibit signs similar to Usher syndrome, including Alport syndrome, Alström syndrome, Bardet–Biedl syndrome, Cockayne syndrome, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia congenita, Flynn–Aird syndrome, Friedreich ataxia, Hurler syndrome (MPS-1), Kearns–Sayre syndrome (CPEO), Norrie syndrome, osteopetrosis (Albers–Schonberg disease), Refsum disease (phytanic acid storage disease) and Zellweger syndrome (cerebrohepatorenal syndrome).

===Classification===
Although Usher syndrome has been classified clinically in several ways, the prevailing approach is to classify it into three clinical sub-types called Usher I, II and III in order of decreasing severity of deafness. Although it was previously believed that there was an Usher syndrome type IV, researchers at the University of Iowa recently confirmed that there is no USH type IV. As described below, these clinical subtypes may be further subdivided by the particular gene mutated; people with Usher I and II may have any one of six and three genes mutated, respectively, whereas only one gene has been associated with Usher III. The function of these genes is still poorly understood.

Usher syndrome is a variable condition; the degree of severity is not tightly linked to whether it is Usher I, II, or III. For example, someone with type III may be unaffected in childhood but go on to develop a profound hearing loss and a very significant loss of sight by early-to-mid adulthood. Similarly, someone with type I, who is therefore profoundly deaf from birth, may keep good central vision until the sixth decade of life or even beyond. People with type II, who have useful hearing with a hearing aid, can experience a wide range of severity of the RP. Some may maintain good reading vision into their 60s, while others cannot see to read while still in their 40s.

Since Usher syndrome is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, both males and females are equally likely to inherit it. Consanguinity of the parents is a risk factor.

==Treatment==

Since Usher syndrome results from the loss of a gene, gene therapy that adds the proper protein back (&quot;gene replacement&quot;) may alleviate it, provided the added protein becomes functional. Recent studies of mouse models have shown one form of the disease—that associated with a mutation in myosin VIIa—can be alleviated by replacing the mutant gene using a lentivirus. However, some of the mutated genes associated with Usher syndrome encode very large proteins—most notably, the &quot;USH2A&quot; and &quot;GPR98&quot; proteins, which have roughly 6000 amino-acid residues. Scientists have successfully treated mice with Usher syndrome type 1C, which has a relatively small affected gene.

== Epidemiology ==
Usher syndrome is responsible for the majority of deafblindness. It occurs in roughly 1 in 23,000 people in the United States, 1 in 28,000 in Norway, and 1 in 12,500 in Germany. People with Usher syndrome represent roughly one-sixth of people with retinitis pigmentosa.

== History ==

Usher syndrome is named after the Scottish ophthalmologist Charles Usher, who examined the pathology and transmission of this illness in 1914 based on 69 cases. However, it was first described in 1858 by Albrecht von Gräfe, a pioneer of modern ophthalmology. He reported the case of a deaf patient with retinitis pigmentosa, who had two brothers with the same symptoms. Three years later, one of his students, Richard Liebreich, examined the population of Berlin for disease patterns of deafness with retinitis pigmentosa. Liebreich noted Usher syndrome to be recessive since the cases of blind-deafness combinations occurred particularly in the siblings of blood-related marriages or in families with patients in different generations. His observations supplied the first proofs for the coupled transmission of blindness and deafness since no isolated cases of either could be found in the family trees.

Animal models of this human disease (such as knockout mice and zebrafish) have been developed recently to study the effects of these gene mutations and to test potential cures for Usher syndrome.

===Notable cases===
* Rebecca Alexander, a psychotherapist, author, and recipient of the Helen Keller Achievement Award.
* Christine &quot;Coco&quot; Roschaert, director of the Nepal Deafblind Project, kick-off speaker for Deaf Awareness Week at the University of Vermont, and participant in the Gallaudet United Now Movement.
* Catherine Fischer wrote her autobiography of growing up with Usher syndrome in Louisiana, entitled &quot;Orchid of the Bayou&quot;.

* Christian Markovic, and blind-deaf illustrator and designer; Fuzzy Wuzzy Designs.
* John Tracy, the son of actor Spencer Tracy and namesake of the oralist John Tracy Clinic.
* The Israeli Nalaga&#x27;at (do touch) Deaf-blind Acting Ensemble consists of 11 deaf-blind actors, most of whom are diagnosed with Usher syndrome. The theater group has put on several productions and appeared both locally in Israel and abroad in London and Broadway.
* Katie Kelly, a gold medal-winning paralympian.
* Teigan Van Roosmalen, paraolympian.
* Cyril Axelrod, Catholic priest.

<text>Jasmin Lanaran Figueroa-Dungca (born 20 March 1985 in Tondo, Manila, Philippines) is an athlete from the Philippines. She competed in archery and is a former student of the University of Makati.

Figueroa took up archery in 1995 and started representing the Philippines in international tournaments in May 2003. Figueroa was the sole athlete competing for the Philippines at the 2004 Summer Olympics in archery. She was coached by Henry Manalang. She placed 56th in the women&#x27;s individual ranking round with a 72-arrow score of 600. In the first round of elimination, she faced 9th-ranked Natalia Valeeva of Italy. In an upset, Figueroa secured a narrow 132-130 win over Valeeva in the 18-arrow match to advance to the round of 32.In that round, she faced Almudena Gallardo of Spain, losing to the 24th-ranked archer 152-150 in the regulation 18 arrows. Figueroa finished 27th in women&#x27;s individual archery.

Figueroa was awarded the International Olympic Committee Trophy for Fair Play.

Figueroa retired from active competition shortly after the 2005 South East Asian Games.

Figueroa started working at Pampanga State Agricultural University in 2006 as assistant coach in archery to her Olympic coach, Henry Manalang. Figueroa was then promoted to head coach in 2007 after Manalang left to work at La Union. Figueroa left Pampanga State Agricultural University in 2015. From early 2016 to early 2017, she worked at Kodanda Archery Range (Mall of Asia branch) as a coach. She is now a private coach.

She married Jerald Dungca on August 31, 2010. They have 4 children, 3 boys and 1 girl.

Schiller was born in New York City. He attended Guggenheim Elementary, Sousa Jr. High School and later Paul D. Schreiber High School. He graduated from the University of Chicago 1976, later teaching both there and at Wayne State University. In 1991, he earned his PhD in linguistics from the University of Chicago.

After his undergraduate years, Schiller turned to music performance and founded a music group called the &quot;Long Island Sound Ensemble&quot; and studied conducting in Vienna, Salzburg and Hancock, Maine. He was a frequent attendant at NY Philharmonic rehearsals until 1981.

==Chess career==
In 1974, Schiller was the Illinois Junior Champion. Schiller played for the University of Chicago team several times at the Pan American Intercollegiate Team Chess Championship. Schiller was the Hawaii action and blitz champion for 1988/89. He was an organizer of the Hawaii International chess festivals 1994–98, including 1998 US Open California Champion 1995. Later that year, he appeared as a chess advisor for the music group Phish on some of the stops for their &quot;Chess Tour&quot; where they played an ongoing game of two chess moves per tour stop and some &quot;band vs. audience&quot; partial games as part of their stage performance. Schiller was an arbiter at several notable games and championships including the FIDE World Chess Championship 2000. While Vladimir Kramnik and Garry Kasparov opted not to participate in the event, they had both endorsed Schiller for this sensitive role during the planning stages.

Schiller was an International Arbiter and International Trainer.

Schiller organized several chess tournaments. He was often a news reporter, reporting on Chess Olympiads and World Chess Championship matches. Schiller was the arbiter for the Staunton Memorial tournament in London in 2005, 2007 and 2008, and the 2006 Gibtelecom International Chess Festival in Gibraltar.

As of July 2017, Schiller&#x27;s FIDE Elo rating for chess at standard time controls was 1989. At his peak, his rating was 2370.

==Chess author==
Schiller wrote over 100 chess books, more than any other author of the genre in the 20th century except Fred Reinfeld and Raymond Keene. John L. Watson, who co-wrote three books with Schiller, considers some of Schiller&#x27;s output to be well suited to its amateur audience. Watson wrote of &quot;Complete Defense to King Pawn Openings&quot; and &quot;Complete Defense to Queen Pawn Openings&quot; that &quot;these books are explicitly aimed at the developing student, not the advanced player, and I think they both do a particularly good job of gently guiding an inexperienced player through a new opening. ... While Schiller probably deserves some of the criticism he gets, a consequence of writing too many books too quickly, he should also get credit when he does a good job.&quot; International Master Jeremy Silman wrote of Watson and Schiller&#x27;s &quot;The Big Book of Busts&quot;, &quot;I am forced to swallow my bigoted view of Schiller&#x27;s work (or does this just validate my opinion of Watson?) and admit that this is a great book&quot;.

Schiller also worked as chess developer mainly developing teaching tools, like all the tutorials for computer software &quot;Kasparov&#x27;s Gambit&quot;, chapters of the reference manual of the same game and developing teaching tools included in Chessmaster 5000.

Amongst Schiller&#x27;s large output, some of his books have received poor reviews. Chess historian Edward Winter has criticized many of Schiller&#x27;s earlier books for large numbers of spelling, factual and typographical errors, and even claimed plagiarism. Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Unorthodox Chess Openings&quot; received a noted two-word review from Tony Miles in &quot;Kingpin&quot;: &quot;Utter crap.&quot; Carsten Hansen wrote of Schiller&#x27;s book on the Frankenstein–Dracula Variation of the Vienna Game that it was &quot;by far the worst book that I have ever seen.&quot;

==Career in linguistics==
Schiller&#x27;s PhD thesis was entitled &quot;An autolexical account of subordinating serial verb phrase constructions&quot;. He was a published author in linguistics, specializing in Mon-Khmer languages. Schiller was a co-founder of the Southeast Asian Linguistic Society and was an officer of the Chicago Linguistic Society. He maintained a web page with a lengthy list of his linguistic publications at this URL.

Books by Schiller on linguistics include:
* &quot;Autolexical Theory: Ideas and Methods&quot;, Eric Schiller, Elisa Steinberg &amp; Barbara Need (eds.), Mouton de Gruyter, 1995. .
* &quot;The Best of CLS: A selection of out of print papers from 1968 to 1975&quot;, Eric Schiller, et al. (eds.), Chicago Linguistic Society, 1988. .

==Personal life==
Since 2008, Schiller experienced some health setbacks, including having his right hand and foot amputated due to complications from diabetes. Nonetheless, he remained active and ambulatory with the aid of a walker and taught chess at several elementary schools in and near Mountain View, California, in affiliation with Bay Area Chess, where he lived in the last years of his life. He offered chess tutoring over the Internet via videoconferencing. He died on November 3, 2018, from complications of cardiovascular disease.

<text>Numedal () is a valley and a traditional district in Eastern Norway located within the county of Buskerud. It traditionally includes the municipalities Flesberg, Nore og Uvdal and Rollag. Administratively, it now also includes Kongsberg.

== Geography ==
Numedal is the southernmost valley of the major valleys in Eastern Norway. Numedal is largely a U-shaped valley. Most of the area is mountainous, especially west of the main valley, with steep valley sides. Running north–south, it extends between Flesberg in the south to Rødberg in the north, passing through the municipalities of Flesberg, Rollag and Nore og Uvdal. The Numedalslågen, the third-longest river in Norway, flows through the valley before discharging into Oslofjord at Larvik.

National Road 40 runs from Larvik. National Road 7 crosses Hardangervidda to Geilo. Numedal Line Railway (&quot;Numedalsbanen&quot;) was opened in 1927 and stopped operations in 1988. The former railroad track from Veggli to Rødberg is now used principally for cycling.

== Economy ==
Agriculture and forestry are important industries in the valley along with hydropower generation, as well as growing tourist traffic.

== Etymology ==
The name comes from &#x27;, the Old Norse name for the Numedalslågen, and &#x27; meaning &quot;valley&quot;. The origin and meaning of the name are the same as that of Namdalen.

== Attractions ==

The area along the Numedalslågen from Flesberg up to the Hardangervidda through the valley has a large number of examples of Medieval Scandinavian architecture. There are still over 40 historic timber buildings and four stave churches: Flesberg Stave Church, Rollag Stave Church, Nore Stave Church and Uvdal Stave Church.

Numedal was also the location of one of the &quot;Nordmann&#x27;s trails&quot; (&quot;Nordmannsslepene&quot;), which were the old main roads between east and west over Hardangervidda. On the marked paths, remains of Stone Age dwelling places, bog iron works and grave mounds can be seen.

Numedal also has several museums including Nore og Uvdal Open Air Museum (&quot;Nore og Uvdal Bygdetun&quot;) in Uvdal, Rollag Open Air Museum (&quot;Rollag Bygdetun&quot;) in Rollag, and Dåset Open Air Museum (&quot;Dåset bygdetun&quot;) at Flesberg. These are collections of historic buildings, mostly built in the traditional style common for the valley.

== Climate ==
Numedal has a subarctic climate (Dfc) with short, mild, and wet summers with cool nights and long, cold, and snowy winters.

<doc id="915856" wikidata="Q220779" url="?curid=915856" title="Poland at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Poland competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s eighteenth appearance at the Summer Olympics, except the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, because of the Soviet boycott. The Polish Olympic Committee (, &quot;PKO&quot;) sent a total of 194 athletes to the Games, 132 men and 62 women, to compete in 21 sports. Men&#x27;s volleyball was the only team-based sport in which Poland had its representation in these Olympic Games. There was only a single competitor in women&#x27;s taekwondo.

The Polish team featured six defending Olympic champions from Sydney: race walker Robert Korzeniowski, rifle shooter Renata Mauer-Różańska, rowing pair Tomasz Kucharski and Robert Sycz, and hammer throwers Kamila Skolimowska, and Szymon Ziółkowski. Greco-Roman wrestler and 1996 Olympic champion Ryszard Wolny and sprint canoeist Michał Śliwiński (previously competed for the Soviet Union, Unified Team, and Ukraine) had made their fifth Olympic appearance as the most sophisticated athletes of the team. Show jumper Grzegorz Kubiak, aged 41, was the oldest athlete of the team, while rhythmic gymnast Martyna Dąbkowska was the youngest at age 15. Swimming star Bartosz Kizierowski, who finished fifth in Sydney four years earlier in the men&#x27;s 50 m freestyle, became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony.

Poland left Athens with a total of ten medals, three golds, two silver, and five bronze, the lowest in Summer Olympic history since 1956. Seven of these medals were dominated by women, who constituted less than a third of all Polish athletes at these Games. Among the nation&#x27;s medalists, two of them climbed the Olympic podium for the first time: Anna Rogowska, who beat her teammate Monika Pyrek to take home the bronze in women&#x27;s pole vault, and Otylia Jędrzejczak, who became the most decorated Polish athlete at these Games with three medals, including the nation&#x27;s first gold in swimming. Kucharski and Sycz managed to repeat their golden streak in the men&#x27;s double sculls, while Korzeniowski ended an illustrious Olympic career with a historic milestone as the first athlete to defend his Olympic title in men&#x27;s 50 km race walk for the third consecutive time.

<text>The Russian-American Company Under the High Patronage of His Imperial Majesty was a state-sponsored chartered company formed largely on the basis of the United American Company. Emperor Paul I of Russia chartered the company in the Ukase of 1799. It had the mission of establishing new settlements in Russian America, conducting trade with natives, and carrying out an expanded colonization program.

Russia&#x27;s first joint-stock company, it came under the direct authority of the Ministry of Commerce of Imperial Russia. Count Nikolai Petrovich Rumyantsev (Minister of Commerce from 1802 to 1811; Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1808 to 1814) exercised a pivotal influence upon the early activities of the company. In 1801 the company&#x27;s headquarters moved from Irkutsk to Saint Petersburg, and the merchants who were initially the major stockholders were soon replaced with Russia&#x27;s nobility and aristocracy.

Count Rumyantsev funded Russia&#x27;s first naval circumnavigation of the globe under the joint command of Adam Johann von Krusenstern and Nikolai Rezanov in 1803–1806. Later he funded and directed the &quot;Ryurik&quot;″s circumnavigation of 1814–1816, which provided substantial scientific information on Alaska&#x27;s and California&#x27;s flora and fauna, and important ethnographic information on Alaskan and Californian (among others) natives. During the Russian-California period (1812–1842) when they operated Fort Ross, the Russians named present-day Bodega Bay, California as &quot;Rumyantsev Bay&quot; () in his honor.

==Early history==

In 1799 the Russian government appointed an official, with the title &#x27;Correspondent&#x27;, to maintain oversight of company affairs, the first being Nikolai Rezanov. This role was soon expanded to a three-seat board of directors, with two elected by the stockholders and one appointed by the government. Additionally the directors had to send reports of the company&#x27;s activities directly to the tsar. They also appointed a Chief Manager of the company, who was stationed in North America to directly administer the forts, trade stations and outposts.

Alexander Andreyevich Baranov was appointed as the first Chief Manager. During his tenure, he founded both Pavlovskaya and later New Archangel, settlements that became operating bases for the company. He was replaced in 1818 by an officer appointed from the Imperial Russian Navy. The position of Chief Manager was thereafter reserved for Imperial Naval officers.

The Ukase of 1799 (decree by the Tsar) granted the company a monopoly over trade in Russian America, defined with a southern border of 55° N latitude. Tsar Alexander I in the Ukase of 1821 asserted its domain to 45°50′ N latitude, revised by 1822 to 51° N latitude. This border was challenged by both Great Britain and the United States, which ultimately resulted in the Russo-American Treaty of 1824 and the Russo-British Treaty of 1825. These established 54°40′ as the ostensible southward limit of Russian interests.

The only attempt by the Russians to enforce the ukase of 1821 was the seizure of the U.S. brig &quot;Pearl&quot; in 1822, by the Russian sloop &quot;Apollon&quot;. The &quot;Pearl&quot;, a vessel of the maritime fur trade, was sailing from Boston, Massachusetts to New Archangel/Sitka. When the U.S. government protested, the Russians released the vessel and paid compensation. Due to treaty violations in 1833 with the British by the company&#x27;s governor, Baron Ferdinand von Wrangel, the Russians later leased the southeastern sector of what is now the Alaska Panhandle, to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in 1838 as part of a damages settlement. The lease gave the HBC authority as far north as 56° 30&#x27; N.

Under Baranov, who governed the region between 1790 and 1818, a permanent settlement was established in 1804 at &quot;Novo-Arkhangelsk&quot; (New Archangel, today&#x27;s Sitka, Alaska), and a thriving maritime trade was organized. Alutiiq and Aleut men from the Kodiak and the Aleutian Islands were forcibly conscripted to work for the company for three-year periods because they were &quot;among the most sophisticated and effective sea otter hunters in the world.&quot; During its initial years, the company had problems in maintaining a pool of skilled crewmen for its ships. The limited number of Russian men proficient in naval craft in the Empire usually sought employment in the Imperial Russian Navy. The RAC (Russian-American Company) had difficulty recruiting men for naval training, in part due to the continued practice of serfdom in the Empire, which kept most peasants tied to the land. In 1802 the Imperial government directed the Imperial Navy to send officers for employment in the RAC, with half of their pay to come from the company.

Russian merchants were excluded from the port of Guangzhou and its valuable markets, something the RAC endeavored to change. The company funded a circumnavigation that lasted from 1803 to 1806, with the goals of expanding Russian navigational knowledge, supplying the RAC stations, and opening commercial relations with the Qing Empire. While the expedition did sell its wares at the Chinese port, &quot;no noticeable progress&quot; towards securing Russian trading rights was made during the next half century. Due to the closed Chinese ports, the RAC had to ship its furs to the Russian port of Okhotsk. From there caravans typically took more than a year to reach Ayan, Irkutsk, and the Siberian Route. The majority of the pelts were traded in Kyakhta, where Chinese trade goods, principally cotton, porcelain and tea, were traded.

In 1817, Fort Elizabeth was built in Hawaii by Georg Anton Schäffer, an agent of the RAC. His actions to attempt to overthrow the Kingdom of Hawaii is known as the Schäffer affair.

===American merchants===
Over the course of the RAC&#x27;s first decade of enterprise, its officials became increasingly concerned about American ships trading in adjacent coastal regions, especially their sale of firearms to natives. Throughout 1808 to 1810, Imperial officials appealed to the United States government to ban this trade. The American government took no action to satisfy Russian concerns. Discussions were held with American ambassador John Quincy Adams in 1810 to determine the southern limits of the Russian&#x27;s claimed land. Government agents of the Russian Empire &quot;claimed the whole coast of America on the Pacific, and the adjacent islands, from Bering&#x27;s Strait southward toward and beyond the mouth of the Columbia River&quot;. The pronouncement stalled attempts at settling a southern border of Russian America for over a decade.

American fur trader John Jacob Astor sent a ship in 1810 to present-day Alaska with the intention of supplying New Archangel. The supplies were welcomed by Baranov, and he hired the ship to transport furs to Guangzhou. Upon learning of the pressing issue of American sales of firearms, Astor conceived of plan beneficial to both his American Fur Company and the RAC. In return for a monopoly to supply Russian stations through his subsidiary Pacific Fur Company and the right to transport RAC furs to the Qing Empire, Astor promised to refrain from selling firearms to Alaskan natives. The Russian Minister to the United States, Count Fyodor Palen, was informed of the proposal. He contacted the Imperial government, noting that the deal would likely be more effective at ending the firearm sales than through diplomatic channels with the United States. Astor&#x27;s son-in-law, Adrian B. Benton, traveled to Saint Petersburg in 1811 to negotiate with company and government officials.

The proposed agreement was favorably received by the board of directors, outside one contentious clause. Astor requested to be allowed to transport a minor amount of furs into Russia import free, a benefit which only the RAC had enjoyed. Shareholders of the company, such as the minister of both the Foreign and Commercial offices, Count Nikolay Rumyantsev, expressed opposition to this provision. He believed that Astor had arranged all the negotiations to secure this trading right. Eventually the Americans dropped the provision and on 2 May 1812, the parties signed a four-year agreement. The two companies agreed to cease trading with other merchants and prevent the trading operations on the coast by their competitors. But the onset of the War of 1812 between Great Britain and the United States, and the capture of Astoria by the North West Company of Canada, ended Astor&#x27;s operations on the Pacific coast.

==Outside Russian America==
The Russian-American Company grew interests in other parts of North America, principally Alta California, with smaller focus on Baja California and the Oregon Country. Additionally, some efforts were spent on increasing relations with the Kingdom of Hawaii, with the Schäffer affair being an attempt at colonizing the islands by a company agent acting alone.

===Lower Pacific Northwest===

====Juno====
While sailing south from Russian America for Alta California, the crew of the &quot;Juno&quot;, a New England ship purchased from John DeWolf, attempted entering the Columbia River. Grigory Langsdorff reported that &quot;Count Rezanov had already formed his plans for the removal of the Russian settlement [New Archangel] to the river Columbia, and was now planning to build a shipyard there.&quot; The company directors were previously advised by Rezanov to establish a company settlement on the river, in a plan aiming for company expansion south &quot;to include the coast of California in the Russian possession.&quot; Bad weather made passing the mouth of the Columbia too difficult to pursue.

====Saint Nikolai expedition====
A company vessel, the &quot;Nikolai&quot;, was dispatched to the Oregon Country by Chief Manager Baranov in November 1808 with instructions to &quot;if possible discover a site for a permanent Russian post in the Oregon Country.&quot; On 1 November, a weather system of strong gales and large waves marooned the ship on a beach north of the Quillayute River and James Island. Conflict arose with the neighboring Hoh nation and the crew had to flee into the interior of the Olympic Peninsula. Clashes with the indigenous population continued over the next year, the Russians having to resort to raiding villages for food. Eventually most of the crew became willing slaves to the Makah on the understanding they would be released when the next European vessel would arrive. American Captain Brown of the &quot;Lydia&quot; purchased the &quot;Nikolai&quot; crew and they sailed for New Archangel, arriving there on 9 June. During their time marooned on the Olympic Peninsula, seven of the crew died, including expedition commander Nikolai Bulygin and his 18-year-old wife, Anna Bulyagina.

===Californias===
The first ship to trap furs in either Alta or Baja California for the RAC was in 1803. An American vessel owned by James O&#x27;Cain, the &quot;O&#x27;Cain&quot;, was contracted to trap sea otters on the Baja California peninsula, with half of the furs caught property of the RAC. On board the ship besides its American crew were 2 RAC staff and 40 natives, principally Aleuts, along with some Alutiiq of Kodiak Island. The hunting equipment used in the expedition was of indigenous origin, including the notable iqyax boats. Based out of San Quintín, Alaskan natives caught sea otters from Misión de El Rosario de Abajo to Santo Domingo (located in the modern Comondú Municipality). Returning Kodiak island in June 1804, the &quot;O&#x27;Cain&quot; contained a total of 1,800 sea otter skins caught by the natives or purchased from Spanish. Under similar terms other American captains were employed over the years, with Aleuts continually used to trap California Sea otters, specific operations employing upwards of 300. During the period between 1805 and 1812 Baranov supplied Aleut laborers to 10 American ships sent to California, with over 22,000 pelts gathered.

In Aug. 1805, Nikolai Rezanov arrived at New Archangel, then visiting the scattered RAC possessions. Provisions were at the time sorely needed by the RAC posts to feed its workforce, an issue that would plague the company for decades. After Rezanov purchased the &quot;Juno&quot;, an American ship, he and its crew departed from New Archangel in February 1806 south to attempt purchasing supplies in Alta California. Upon entering the Californias, Rezanov negotiated with Spanish authorities in the name of the Tsar, presenting himself as a minister plenipotentiary. Despite his claims, he was never given such a commission by the Imperial Government. Efforts were made at cultivating relations with prominent official José Darío Argüello, in order secure a contract for provisions, Rezanov even having a romance with his daughter, Concepción Argüello. However the officials were only willing to forward the request of the Russians to Mexico City, none wanting to disobey a decree by the Spanish Empire that outlawed trade with foreigners. After several months the Russians departed for New Archangel without an agreement for provisions.

Valuable reconnaissance however was gained, with Rezanov seeing first hand the lack of Spanish &quot;presidios&quot; or settlements until the southern shore of the San Francisco Bay. Several ships owned by Americans were contracted to begin operations in Alta California almost immediately after the Juno&#x27;s return to New Archangel. One ship was based in Bodega Bay, with its Indigenous Alaskan workforce operating from the coast of modern Mendocino County to the Farallon Islands. While catching otters on the northern shores of the San Francisco Bay, Luis Antonio Argüello, the commandant ordered a cannon be shot at the trappers&#x27; baidarkas, dispersing the Aleut and Alutiiq trappers from the Bay. Reports from the American captains and Rezanov on the conditions in California encouraged Chief Manager Baranov to plan a coastal settlement in the territory. There were numerous sea otter populations to hunt, a lack of Spanish military posts above San Francisco Bay, and the possibility to trade with the Spanish Missions.

====Fort Ross====

Built in 1812 and located on the coast of California in modern-day Sonoma County, Fort Ross was the southernmost outpost of the company. Several additional posts were operated by the company, including Port Rumyantsev on Bodega Bay, and several ranches south of the Russian River valley. Though on disputed Spanish and then subsequently Mexican territory, the legitimacy of these claims was contested by both the Company and the Russian Government until the sale of the settlement in 1841, basing the legitimacy of their claims on prior English (New Albion) claims of territorial discovery. It is now partially reconstructed and an open-air museum, with the Rotchev House being the only remaining original building.

====Proposed colonization====
An expansive colonization program of California was presented to the Imperial Court by the &quot;garrulous and unreliable&quot; 20-year-old junior officer and former Decembrist Dmitry I. Zavalishin in late 1824. He had been a crew member of an expedition that during 1823 and 1824 to examine the Russian possessions in North America. His memorandum proposed that the Californios be encouraged to secede from Mexico in order to create a political alliance. Zavalishin wanted the Russian-American Company to receive a grant of land extending north to the border of the Oregon Country, south to the San Francisco Bay and east to either the Sierra Nevada mountains or the Sacramento River. In return the Russians were to maintain a naval presence in San Francisco Bay, protect the California Mission&#x27;s right to maintain neophyte labor, allow &quot;Californios&quot; to settle within the grant and establish Spanish language schools throughout California. A council of the inner Russian government debated the merits of Zavalishin&#x27;s plan. Foreign Minister Count Karl Nesselrode feared the scheme would anger the United States and the United Kingdom, and consequently was against it. The court representative of the RAC, Count Nikolay Mordvinov, defended the memorandum and voiced Zavalishin&#x27;s stance that &quot;too much leniency and effort to avoid conflict sometimes only precipitate a conflict.&quot;

Building on Zavalishin&#x27;s proposal, Mordvinov planned on buying serfs from Russian landlords and sending them to California. The freed serfs were to be supported by the company and had to remain as settlers for seven years in its service. After the expiration of their contracts, all farming implements provided and land farmed upon would become the property of the freemen. A banquet was held for Zavalishin to draw support for his plan, with many prominent officials of the Empire attending. Mikhail Speransky, a former Governor-General of Siberia, saw California as a future grain supplier to Russian Pacific possessions in Alaska, Sakhalin and the Siberian coast. The Assistant Foreign Minister, Poletica, while at first against Zavalishin&#x27;s program of Californian expansionism, by the end of the reception became fully supportive of it. Additionally the Minister of Education, Shishkov, while not present at the banquet warmly received the memorandum.

Zavalishin became fearful the treaties made in 1824 and 1825 that delineated Russian America&#x27;s borders would restrict the Empire from a proactive policy in North America. He beseeched Tsar Alexander I for an audience to defend his memorandum, but a meeting was never arranged. Eventually Tsar Alexander echoed Nesselrode&#x27;s position and refused to send Zavalishin back to California. The political upheaval of Alexander I&#x27;s death and the subsequent Decembrist Uprising halted the considerations for an extensive commercial colonisation of California by the RAC. In 1853 Governor General N. N. Muravyov recounted to Tsar Alexander II that: California during the 1820s &quot;was unoccupied and virtually unprocessed by anybody&quot;, though he found that a &quot;foothold in California&quot; would &quot;sooner or later&quot; have to be turned over to the advancing Americans.

==Later period==
In 1818 the Russian government had taken control of the Russian-American Company from the merchants who held the charter. Starting in the 1820s the company&#x27;s profitability slumped due to declining populations of fur-bearing animals. It had already had bad annual returns, in 1808 slightly less than half of the 2,300,000 rubles of expense were covered. Between 1797 and 1821 the RAC or its forerunner the United American Company collected the following inventory of furs, worth in total 16 million rubles: 1.3 million foxes of several species, 72,894 sea otters, 59,530 river otters, 34,546 beavers, 30,950 sables, 17,298 wolverines, 14,969 fur seals along with smaller numbers of lynx, wolf, sea lion, walrus and bears.

In 1828, Emperor Nicholas I of Russia ordered the RAC to begin to supply the Russian settlements on the Kamchatka Peninsula, such as Petropavlovsk, with salt. The company was expected to ship between 3,000 and 5,000 poods of salt annually. Continual difficulties in securing large amounts of cheap salt in the Kingdom of Hawaii and Alta California led officials to consider Baja California instead. Arvid Etholén was dispatched in the winter of 1827, and soon secured permission from Mexican authorities to gather salt around San Quintín. Transportation was arranged with the Misión Santo Tomás.

The explorer and naval officer, Baron Ferdinand Petrovich von Wrangel, who had been administrator of imperial government interests in Russian America a decade before, was the fifth governor (in office: 1830 to 1835) during the government period. Eventually during the 1840s the governing board of the company was replaced with a five-member administration of imperial naval officers.

During the Crimean War of 1853 to 1856, when the United Kingdom fought against the Russian Empire from 1854 to 1856, officials of the RAC began to fear an invasion of their Alaskan settlements by British forces. The RAC began discussions with the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in the spring of 1854, with each company pledging to continue peaceable relations and to press their respective governments to do the same. The United Kingdom and the Russian Empire accepted the deal by the companies, but both governments specified that naval blockades and seizure of vessels were acceptable actions. The British HMS &quot;Pique&quot; and the French &quot;Sibylle&quot; attacked an RAC outpost on Urup Island in the Kuriles in 1855, in the belief that the agreement did not cover the Kuriles.

The company built a whaling station at Mamga in Tugur Bay in the Sea of Okhotsk in 1862. It operated from 1863 to 1865 before being sold to Otto Wilhelm Lindholm. Two schooners used the station as a base, sending out whaleboats to catch bowhead whales, which were towed ashore and processed at a nearby tryworks.

The Russian-American Company has been appraised as being run with &quot;poorly chosen and inadequately skilled staff&quot;, floundering in part from &quot;the lack of experience of the executives handling an organization which overreached itself through its expansion across the Pacific and along the American coast into California...&quot; The company ceased its commercial activities in 1881. In 1867, the Alaska Purchase had transferred control of Alaska to the United States and the commercial interests of the Russian-American Company were sold to Hutchinson, Kohl &amp; Company of San Francisco, California, who then renamed their company to the Alaska Commercial Company.

== Currency ==

From 1816 to 1867 the Company circulated ruble or assignat () equivalents - &quot;marki&quot; () - printed on tanned skins.

==Russian-American Company flag==

The Russian commercial flag (civil ensign) was used between 1799 and 1806 by the company on its ships and establishments. Tsar Alexander I approved a design for a separate flag for the RAC on 10 October 1806 O.S., writing &quot;So be it&quot; upon the report. After being sent to the State Council, it was forwarded to the Finance and Naval ministries, along with the Saint Petersburg office of the RAC on 19 October 1806 O.S. The memorandum described the flag as having &quot;three stripes, the lower red, the middle blue, and the upper and wider stripe white, with the facsimile on it of the All-Russia state coat-of-arms below which is a ribbon hanging from the talons of the eagle with the inscription thereon &#x27;Russo-American Company&#x27;&quot;.

The company flag eventually had several variations, in part from the nature of individual production and the changing designs of the Imperial flag. As researcher John Middleton noted, &quot;There continues to be much discussion concerning the design of the company flag, mostly centered around the design and placement of the eagle.&quot; The various flags flew over the company&#x27;s holdings in California until 1 January 1842, and over Alaska until 18 October 1867, when all Russian-American Company holdings in Alaska were sold to the United States. The flag continued to represent the company until its Russian holdings were liquidated in 1881.

==Chief managers==
Below is a list of the general managers (or chief managers, usually known in English as governors) of the Russian-American Company. Many of their names occur as place names in Southeast Alaska. Note that the English spelling of the names varies between sources. The position administered the commercial operations of the company, centered on Russian America. Alexander Andreyevich Baranov was the first and longest serving chief manager, previously managing the United American Company. After Baranov&#x27;s tenure, appointees were chosen from the Imperial Russian Navy and generally served terms of five years. Thirteen naval officers acted as chief managers over the course of the company.

<text>The Philippines competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s eighteenth appearance at the Olympics, except the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of its partial support to the United States boycott.

The Philippine Olympic Committee (POC) sent a total of 16 athletes, 12 men and 4 women, competing in 6 sports. Five Filipino athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including taekwondo jin and SEA Games champion Donald Geisler and boxing veteran Romeo Brin, who became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Brin&#x27;s teammate and boxer Christopher Camat was originally selected by the committee to carry the flag, but surpassed his lifetime privilege to the veteran, as he decided to witness his action and prepare for the next day&#x27;s opening bout.

Philippines left Athens without a single Olympic medal for the second consecutive time. Among all the athletes, welterweight taekwondo jin Mary Antoinette Rivero only progressed further into the semifinals, where she lost the match to host nation&#x27;s Elisavet Mystakidou and the second repechage bout to South Korea&#x27;s Hwang Kyung-Seon, leaving the Filipino squad without a single Olympic medal for the second straight time.

<doc id="915866" wikidata="Q355894" url="?curid=915866" title="John Melcher">
<text>John David Melcher (September 6, 1924 – April 12, 2018) was an American politician of the Democratic Party who represented Montana for four terms as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1969 to 1977 and as a United States Senator for two terms from 1977 until 1989.

==Early life==
Melcher was born in Sioux City, Iowa; his paternal grandparents were from Germany. He attended the University of Minnesota before joining the military. He served in the United States Army during World War II, and participated in the D-Day Invasion of Normandy with the 76th Infantry Division in Europe during World War II. He was wounded in action in Germany and awarded the Purple Heart, Combat Infantryman&#x27;s Badge and the Bronze Star.

Melcher married Ruth Klein in 1945. They had six children.

He graduated from Iowa State University in 1950. Later he moved to Forsyth, Montana, and established a veterinary clinic.

==Political career==
Melcher served on the Forsyth City Council. He then served as mayor of Forsyth in 1955, for three terms. In 1960, he was elected to the Montana House of Representatives for Rosebud County.

In 1962, he was elected to the Montana Senate.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
He was elected to the United States House of Representatives by special election on June 24, 1969, to fill a vacancy created when the incumbent, Republican James F. Battin, resigned to accept an appointment to the Federal bench. Melcher was re-elected to the three succeeding Congresses and served from June 24, 1969, to January 3, 1977.

=== U.S. Senate ===
In 1976, he was elected to the United States Senate to succeed retiring Democratic Senator Mike Mansfield.

Melcher was re-elected in 1982 against Republican Larry R. Williams. Melcher had been targeted by National Conservative Political Action Committee (NCPAC) as potentially vulnerable, and he was subjected to attack ads depicting him as &quot;too liberal for Montana&quot;. Melcher&#x27;s response became a classic of campaign advertising, featuring a shot of an &quot;out-of-stater&quot; carrying a briefcase full of money, followed by a conversation among several cows deploring their intervention in the race.

=== After Congress ===
His campaign for re-election in 1988 was unsuccessful; he was defeated by Republican Conrad Burns. Melcher attributed the loss to a lack of time spent campaigning. A wilderness management bill he co-sponsored was vetoed by President Ronald Reagan only days before the 1988 election.

Melcher was a candidate again for the same seat in the 1994 Senate election for an attempted rematch with Burns, but lost to Jack Mudd in the primary, who in turn was also defeated by Burns by 62% - 38%.

===Political positions and legislative contributions===
Melcher had generally liberal views on environmental issues, but was pro-life and supported prayer in public schools. He was a co-sponsor of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, which regulated coal strip mining.

Melcher was responsible in 1984 for an amendment to the Animal Welfare Act that required psychological well-being to be protected in primate research. This legislation was praised by Jane Goodall, and in 1987 he was the presenter to her of the Schweitzer Medal of the Animal Welfare Institute.

== Later life ==

After serving in the Senate, Melcher worked as a lobbyist for multiple organizations, including the American Veterinary Medical Association.

Melcher died on April 12, 2018, in Missoula, Montana, at the age of 93.

<doc id="915870" wikidata="Q1499127" url="?curid=915870" title="Miser">
<text>A miser is a person who is reluctant to spend money, sometimes to the point of forgoing even basic comforts and some necessities, in order to hoard money or other possessions. Although the word is sometimes used loosely to characterise anyone who is mean with their money, if such behaviour is not accompanied by taking delight in what is saved, it is not properly miserly.

Misers as a type have been a perennial object of popular fascination and a fruitful source for writers and artists in many cultures.

==Accounting for misers==
One attempt to account for miserly behaviour was Sigmund Freud&#x27;s theory of anal retentiveness, attributing the development of miserly behaviour to toilet training in childhood, although this explanation is not accepted by modern evidence-based psychology.

In the Christian West the attitude to those whose interest centred on gathering money has been coloured by the teachings of the Church. From its point of view, both the miser and the usurer were guilty of the cardinal sin of avarice and shared behaviours. According to the parable of the Elm and the Vine in the quasi-Biblical Shepherd of Hermas, the rich and the poor should be in a relationship of mutual support. Those with wealth are in need of the prayers of the poor for their salvation and can only earn them by acts of charity. A typical late example of Christian doctrine on the subject is the Reverend Erskine Neale&#x27;s &quot;The Riches that Bring No Sorrow&quot; (1852), a moralising work based on a succession of biographies contrasting philanthropists and misers.

Running parallel has been a disposition, inherited from Classical times, to class miserly behaviour as a type of eccentricity. Accounts of misers were included in such 19th century works as G. H. Wilson&#x27;s four-volume compendium of short biographies, &quot;The Eccentric Mirror&quot; (1807). Such books were put to comic use by Charles Dickens in &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; (serialised 1864–1865), with its cutting analysis of Victorian capitalism. In the third section of that novel, Mr Boffin decides to cure his ward Bella Wilfer of her obsession with wealth and position by appearing to become a miser. Taking her with him on a round of the bookshops,
In the following chapter, Mr Boffin brings a coachload of the books to his premises and readers are introduced to a selection of typical titles and to the names of several of the misers treated in them. Among the books appear James Caulfield&#x27;s &quot;Portraits, Memoirs, and Characters of Remarkable Persons&quot; (1794–1795); &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Wonderful Museum of Remarkable Characters&quot; (1803);
Henry Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Wonderful Characters&quot; (1821); and F. Somner Merryweather&#x27;s &quot;Lives and Anecdotes of Misers or The Passion of Avarice displayed in the parsimonious habits, unaccountable lives and remarkable deaths of the most notorious misers of all ages&quot; (1850).

The majority of the misers are 18th century characters, with John Elwes and Daniel Dancer at their head. The first account of Elwes&#x27; life was Edward Topham&#x27;s &quot;The Life of the Late John Elwes: Esquire&quot; (1790), which was initially published in his paper &quot;The World&quot;. The popularity of such accounts is attested by the seven editions printed in the book&#x27;s first year and the many later reprintings under various titles. Biographies of Dancer followed soon after, at first in periodicals such as the &quot;Edinburgh Magazine&quot; and the
&quot;Sporting Magazine&quot;, then in the compendiums &quot;Biographical Curiosities&quot; (which also included Elwes) and &quot;The Strange and Unaccountable Life of Daniel Dancer, Esq. ... with singular anecdotes of the famous Jemmy Taylor, the Southwark usurer&quot; (1797), which was often to be reissued under various titles.
Jemmy Taylor&#x27;s name also appears in the list of notable misers that Mr Boffin enumerates. He is coupled with the banker Jemmy Wood of Gloucester, a more recent miser about whom Dickens later wrote an article in his magazine &quot;All the Year Round&quot;. Others include John Little (who appears in Merryweather), Reverend Mr Jones of Blewbury (also in Merryweather) and Dick Jarrel, whose surname was really Jarrett and an account of whom appeared in the Annual Register for 1806. The many volumes of this publication also figured among Mr Boffin&#x27;s purchases.

Two more of the misers mentioned made their way into other literary works. John Hopkins, known as Vulture Hopkins, was the subject of a scornful couplet in the third of Alexander Pope&#x27;s Moral Essays, &quot;Of the Use of Riches&quot;:
John Overs, with a slight change to his name, became the subject of a three-act drama by Douglas William Jerrold, &quot;John Overy or The Miser of Southwark Ferry&quot; (1828), roughly based on an incident when he feigned death to save expenses and was killed by accident.

Another public source of information about misers, in Scotland at least, was the prose broadside. One example concerns Isobel Frazer or Frizzle, who died in Stirling on 26 May 1820. Much of the broadside is taken up with detailing the contents of her three rooms, into which she had let no one enter. Not more than £8 in currency was discovered there, but she had bought and hoarded many articles of dress over the years, although rarely wearing them. She had also carefully picked up every pin that fell in her way, till she nearly filled one hundred pincushions. In addition to much other bric-a-brac, there were a great number of buttons, which had been cut off old coats. This makes her sound more like a compulsive hoarder than the &quot;Female Miser&quot; that she is called in the report. The title was more deserved by Joseph MacWilliam, who was found dead of a fire on 13 June 1826. A servant whose home was a damp Edinburgh cellar without either bed, chair or table, his colleagues and neighbours claimed to have seen him in the same threadbare clothes for 15 years. After his death, property to the value of more than £3,000 was found in the cellar, some in the form of property deeds, and more in bank receipts.

Later in the 19th century there were small regional publications dealing with single individuals of local interest. Examples of such works include Frances Blair&#x27;s 32-page &quot;Memoir of Margery Jackson, the Carlisle miser and misanthrope&quot; (Carlisle 1847) and in the United States the 46-page &quot;Lochy Ostrom, the maiden miser of Poughkeepsie; or the love of a long lifetime. An authentic biography of Rachel Ostrom who recently died in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., aged ninety years, apparently very poor, but really wealthy&quot; (Philadelphia 1870).

One trait of misers arising out of the accounts about them was their readiness to incur legal expenses where money was involved. Daniel Dancer was notorious for spending five shillings in an unsuccessful effort to recover three pence from a shop woman. He was also involved in a lawsuit with his equally miserly brothers when his sister died intestate, although this time he was more successful. In the same century, Margery Jackson was involved in an epic Chancery suit between 1776 and 1791 over a family inheritance. The American Hetty Green, who despite being a multimillionaire had also a reputation as a miser, involved herself in a six-year lawsuit to obtain her aunt&#x27;s fortune, only to have it proved against her that she had forged the will. More modern times yield the Chinese example of an 80-year-old affronted by being called a miser in a poem by his son-in-law. Blaming his hospitalization with Parkinson&#x27;s disease three years later on this, he sued his daughter for medical fees and &#x27;spiritual compensation&#x27;.

==Misers in literature==

===Fables===
There were two famous references to misers in ancient Greek sources. One was Aesop&#x27;s fable of &quot;The Miser and his Gold&quot; which he had buried and came back to view every day. When his treasure was eventually stolen and he was lamenting his loss, he was consoled by a neighbour that he might as well bury a stone (or return to look at the hole) and it would serve the same purpose. The other was a two-line epigram in the Greek Anthology, once ascribed to Plato. In this a man, intending to hang himself, discovered hidden gold and left the rope behind him; on returning, the man who had hidden the gold hanged himself with the noose he found in its place. Both these stories were alluded to or retold in the following centuries, the most famous versions appearing in La Fontaine&#x27;s Fables as &quot;L&#x27;avare qui a perdu son trésor&quot; (IV.20) and &quot;Le trésor et les deux hommes&quot; (IX.15) respectively. Yet another of La Fontaine&#x27;s fables was the late addition, &quot;&quot;The miser and the monkey&quot; (XII.3), used as a cautionary tale for financiers. Here a man keeps his hoard in a sea-encircled tower until a pet monkey amuses itself one day in throwing the coins out of the window.

In Asia, misers were the butt of humorous folklore. One very early cautionary tale is the &quot;Illisa Jataka&quot; from the Buddhist scriptures. This includes two stories, in the first of which a rich miser is miraculously converted to generosity by a disciple of the Buddha; following this, the Buddha tells another story of a miser whose wealth is given away when the king of the gods impersonates him, and when he tries to intervene is threatened with what will happen if he does not change his ways. Two 16th century stories concerning misers are included among the witticisms attributed to Birbal during Mughal times. In one he extracts from a casuistical miser a fee for a poem written in his praise. In the other the miser is forced to reward a merchant who rescued his hoard from a fire with the whole of it. Arabs similarly made extensive use of misers in their literature. The most famous being the 600 page collection of anecdotes called &quot;Kitab Al Bukhala&quot; or Book of Misers by Al-Jāḥiẓ. He lived in 800 CE during the Abbasid Caliphate in Basra, making this the earliest and largest known work on the subject in Arabic literature.

When there was renewed European interest in Aesop during the early Renaissance, the Neo-Latin poet Laurentius Abstemius wrote two collections of original fables, among which appeared &quot;Avarus et poma marcescentia&quot; (The miser and the rotten apples, fable 179), published in 1499. This was eventually translated into English by Roger L&#x27;Estrange and published in his fable collection of 1692. It concerns a miser who cannot bring himself to eat the apples in his orchard until they start to go rotten. His son invites in his playmates to pick the fruit but asks them not to eat the rotten ones since his father prefers those. The 18th century French fabulist Claris de Florian was to adapt the story in his &quot;L&#x27;avare et son fils&quot; (The miser and his son, IV.9). In this version the miserly father hoards his apples and only eats those going rotten. His son, upon being caught raiding them, excuses himself on the grounds that he was confining himself to eating just the sound ones.

In 18th century Britain, when there was a vogue for creating original fables in verse, a number featured misers. Anne Finch&#x27;s &quot;Tale of the Miser and the Poet&quot; was included among others in her 1713 Miscellany. There an unsuccessful poet meets Mammon in the guise of a miser digging up his buried gold and debates with him whether the life of wit and learning is a better calling than the pursuit of wealth. Eventually the poet is convinced that keeping his talent hidden until it is better regarded is the more prudent course. It was followed by John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Miser and Plutus&quot;, published in his collection of fables in 1737. A miser frightened for the security of his hoard denounces gold as the corruptor of virtue and is visited by the angry god of wealth, who asserts that not gold but the attitude towards it is what damages the personality.

While these are more or less original interpretations of the theme, French fabulist Antoine Houdar de la Motte harks back to the light-hearted approach of the Greek Anthology in &quot;The Miser and Minos&quot;, first published in his fables of 1719. Descending to the Classical underworld at his death, the miser is brought before the judge of the dead and is given the extreme punishment of returning to earth to witness how his wealth is now being spent. The Scottish poet Allan Ramsay adapted this into dialect two years later, and Charles Denis provided a version in standard English in his &quot;Select Fables&quot; (1754), reversing the title to &quot;Minos and the Miser&quot;.

Misers are frequent figures of fun in the epigrams of the Greek Anthology. It is charged of them that they are not masters of their own money if they do not spend it. Niarchus tells of one who does not commit suicide because of the cost of the rope to do so; Lucillius tells of another who dies because funeral expenses are cheaper than calling in a doctor. Elsewhere in the anthology is another epigram by Lucillius of a miser&#x27;s encounter with a mouse that assures him he only wants lodging, not board. In one more, a miser dreams that he is in debt and hangs himself.

The Latin writer Horace put miserly behaviour at the centre of the first poem in his first collection of satires, dealing with extremes of behaviour. In writing an imitation of it, an English poet who provides only his surname, Minshull, was to emphasise this by titling his work &quot;The Miser, a Poem&quot; (London, 1735).

In Dante Alighieri″s &quot;Inferno&quot;, misers are put in the fourth circle of hell, in company with spendthrifts as part of their mutual punishment. They roll weights representing their wealth, constantly colliding and quarreling.

During the 16th century, emblem books began using an illustration of an ass eating thistles as symbol of miserly behaviour, often with an accompanying poem. They appeared in various European languages, among them the illustrated trencher by Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger, dating from about 1630, on which an ass laden with rich foods is shown cropping a thistle, surrounding which is the quatrain:
In the third book of &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, Edmund Spenser created a portrait of a man trapped between conflicting desires in Malbecco, who appears in cantos 9–10. He is torn between his miserliness and love for his wife Hellenore. Wishing to escape with a lover, she sets fire to his storeroom and forces him to choose between them:

Eventually losing both, he becomes the embodiment of frustrated jealousy.

The 18th century, so culturally rich in miser lore, furnished some notable poetic examples. Allan Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;Last speech of a wretched miser&quot; dates from 1728 and is written in modified Scots dialect. The miser bids farewell to his riches in a comic monologue and details some of his shifts to avoid expense. Alexander Pope created another masterly portrait in the character of Cotta in his &quot;Epistle to Bathurst&quot; (1733). Reluctance to spend confines this aristocrat to his ancestral hall, where he refuses to engage with the world. Later in the century another Scottish poet, William Stevenson (1719–83), included nine satirical epitaphs on misers among his collected works, of which the last begins: 
Poetic titles from the 19th century include the Irish Arthur Geoghegan&#x27;s &quot;The Old Miser and Mammon: an Incident Poem&quot; (Newry 1818) and Frederick Featherstone&#x27;s &quot;New Christmas Poem entitled The Miser&#x27;s Christmas Eve&quot; (1893). There was also an anonymous didactic poem titled &quot;The Miser&quot; (London 1831). Although miserly behaviour is referenced during the course of its 78 pages, the real focus there is the attraction of money in all its manifestations.

===Broadside ballads===

In the realm of popular poetry, there were a range of narrative broadside ballads concerning misers from the 17th century onward. Some of the earliest deal with the grain speculators who caused such suffering to the poorest. A representative example is &quot;The Wretched Miser&quot; (1682), prefaced as &quot;a brief Account of a covetous Farmer, who bringing a Load of Corn to Market, swore the Devil should have it before he would take the honest Market price&quot;. The devil closes with the bargain and on accounting day carries off the farmer as well. The social message is carried by the refrain that follows each stanza: &quot;O Farmers, covetous Farmers,/ why would you pinch the Poor?&quot; The religious aspect is dealt with in the contemporary &quot;A Looking-glass for a covetous Miser&quot; by Thomas Jordan. Here a West Country entrepreneur and a poor husbandman debate the respective merits of anxious profit-making and contentment. The miser laments the current low price of grain and resolves not to sell or plant more until the price rises. The theme continued into the early 19th century, where a farmer is again the subject of &quot;The life and awful death of a rich miser &quot;.

Another common subject of these ballads was the dilemma of the miser&#x27;s daughter unable to marry the man of her choice and the stratagems employed to overcome her father. In &quot;Bite Upon the Miser&quot;, printed in the late 18th century, a sailor dresses up as the devil and scares the miser and the parson he intended as her husband into allowing the match. Much the same situation occurs in &quot;The Politic Lovers or the Windsor Miser Outwitted&quot;, where it is a butcher who impersonates the devil and scares the miser into handing over his riches. In about 1800 there appeared an English broadside ballad called &quot;The old miser&quot; which was to serve as basis for what grew into a folk song with multiple versions. The scene is set in London, where a miser&#x27;s daughter is courted by a sailor and the father arranges for him to be press-ganged to get him out of the way. As well as persisting in England, there are also versions in the US and Tristan de Cunha. Misers were notorious tricksters, so ingenuity transcending barely credible impersonations was generally needed. &quot;Bite upon bite or the miser outwitted by the country lass&quot; (1736–63) does not feature the miser&#x27;s daughter but another sort of damsel in distress. A girl bears a child out of wedlock and is advised by her mother to name it Maidenhead and offer it for sale. A rich miser closes the bargain and is eventually forced to support the child by the magistrate.

Still another ballad theme was the privations of the miser&#x27;s servant, a comic situation in drama and fiction also, and here principally concerned with how little food the household has to live on. One example is &quot;The Miser&#x27;s Man (dating from between 1863 and 1885). At the start of the 19th century, the theme had figured as an episode in Robert Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Croglin Watty&quot;. A simple-minded countryman down from the fells, Watty was hired by the real-life Carlisle miser Margery Jackson (1722–1812) and served her for a quarter. The ballad mixes sung verses with prose description, both in Cumberland dialect: 

Dame Margery is not named in the poem because at the time of writing (1805) she was still alive and known to be litigious. We know that it is meant to be her from the fact that in William Brown&#x27;s painting of the ballad, &quot;Hiring Croglin Watty at Carlisle Cross&quot;, it is she who figures in the foreground. About 1811, just before her death, Brown had already devoted another painting to her alone as she tramped through the town. That she is still amusedly remembered there is witnessed by the modern &quot;Miser! The Musical&quot; (2011), based on her life.

===Drama===
Misers were represented onstage as comic figures from Classical times. One of the earliest appears in the comic Phlyax plays developed in the Greek colonies in Italy during the 4th century BCE, which are known only from rare fragments and titles. They were also popularly represented on Greek vases, often with the names of the characters written above them. In one of these by Asteas two men are depicted robbing a miser. At the centre the miser Charinos has settled for sleep on top of his strongbox in the comfort of two blankets. He is rudely awoken by two rascals mishandling him in an effort to lay their hands on his riches. On the left, Gymnilos has already pulled away the blanket on top of him while, on the right, Kosios drags out the blanket beneath. On the far right, the miser&#x27;s slave Karion stands with outstretched arms and knocking knees.

Such stock figures eventually provided inspiration for the Latin dramas of Plautus.
The character of Euclio in his &quot;Aulularia&quot; was to be particularly influential, as was the complicating subplot of a marriageable daughter. One of the earliest Renaissance writers to adapt the play was the Croatian Marin Držić in about 1555, whose &quot;Skup&quot; (The Miser) is set in Dubrovnik. Ben Jonson adapted elements from Plautus for his early comedy &quot;The Case is Altered&quot; (c. 1597). The miser there is the Milanese Jaques de Prie, who has a (supposed) daughter, Rachel. Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft and Samuel Coster followed with their very popular Dutch comedy &quot;Warenar&quot; (1617). The play is named from the miser, whose daughter is Claartje. Molière adapted Plautus&#x27; play into French as &quot;L&#x27;Avare&quot; (The Miser, 1668) while in England Thomas Shadwell adapted Molière&#x27;s work in 1672 and a version based on both Plautus and Molière was produced by Henry Fielding in 1732. Among later adaptations there was Vasily Pashkevich&#x27;s 18th-century Russian comic opera &quot;The Miser&quot; and pioneering dramatic works in Arabic by Marun Al Naqqash (1817–55) and in Serbian by Jovan Sterija Popović.
There were also independent dramatic depictions of misers, some of them being variations of the Pantaleone figure in 16th-century Italian commedia dell&#x27;arte. He is represented as a rich and miserly Venetian merchant, later to become the father of Columbina. The Venetian characters who reappear in English drama include the Jewish moneylender Shylock in William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (1598) and the title character of Ben Jonson&#x27;s &quot;Volpone&quot; (1606). In Aubrey Beardsley&#x27;s title page for the latter, Volpone is shown worshiping his possessions, in illustration of the lines from the play, &quot;Dear Saint, / Riches, the dumb god that giv&#x27;st all men tongues.&quot; A similar scene takes place in the second act of Alexander Pushkin&#x27;s short tragedy &quot;Skupoi rytsar&quot; (1836). This concerns a son, Albert, kept short of funds by his father, the Baron. Under the title The Miserly Knight, it was made an opera by Sergei Rachmaninoff in 1906. In the corresponding act in the latter, the Baron visits his underground storehouse, where he gloats at a new addition to his coffers and moodily contemplates the extravagance of his son during a 15-minute solo.

Following on from the continuing success of Molière&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Avare&quot;, there was a spate of French plays dealing with misers and their matrimonial plans over the next century and a half. What complicates matters is that several of these had the same title but were in fact separate plays written by different authors. &quot;L&#x27;Avare Amoureux&quot; (The Miser in Love) by Jean du Mas d&#x27; Aigueberre (1692–1755) was a one-act comedy acted in Paris in 1729. It is not the same as the anonymous one-act comedy of the same title published in 1777.

Another set of plays borrows a title from the Italian dramatist Carlo Goldoni, who was working in France at the end of his life. He had already produced a one-act comedy titled &quot;L&#x27;avaro&quot; (The Miser) in Bologna in 1756. In 1776 he produced in France the five-act &quot;L&#x27; avare fastueux&quot; (The Spendthrift Miser). The same title was used by L. Reynier for his five-act verse drama of 1794 and by Claude Baron Godart d&#x27;Aucourt de Saint Just (1769-1826) for his three-act verse drama of 1805.

The early 19th century saw misers become the subject of the musicals then fashionable in France. Eugène Scribe and Germain Delavigne collaborated on
&quot;L&#x27;avare en goguette&quot; (The miser&#x27;s spree) in 1823, while Jean-François Bayard and Paul Duport collaborated on the two-act &quot;La fille de l&#x27;avare&quot; (The Miser&#x27;s Daughter) in 1835. The latter play was freely adapted in 1835 by John G. Millingen under the title of &quot;The Miser&#x27;s Daughter&quot;. Two further adaptations of the French play were to follow later: &quot;Love and Avarice&quot; (1859) by J. V. Bridgeman (1819–89), and John Palgrave Simpson&#x27;s &quot;Daddy Hardacre&quot; in 1857. Meanwhile, William Harrison Ainsworth&#x27;s period novel &quot;The Miser&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (first serialised in 1842) was spawning a fresh crop of dramas of that title. Two were played in 1842 and a further adaptation called &quot;Hilda&quot; in 1872. A similarly titled play was the five-act comedy partially in verse, &quot;The Miser&#x27;s Daughter or The Lover&#x27;s Curse&quot; of 1839, a schoolboy indiscretion of the future controversial churchman, Rev.John Purchas. And on the other side of the Atlantic there was a stage production of &quot;Julietta Gordini:The Miser&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, a verse play in five acts, which claimed to derive its plot &#x27;from an Italian story&#x27;.

Douglas William Jerrold&#x27;s &quot;John Overy or The Miser of Southwark Ferry&quot;, (1828) also brings in a daughter whom the miser attempts to sell off as a mistress to her disguised lover. Earlier Jerrold had written a one-act farce, &quot;The Smoked Miser or The Benefit of Hanging&quot; (1823), in which a miser tries to marry off his ward to advantage. Another farce produced in Canada, Major John Richardson&#x27;s &quot;The Miser Outwitted&quot; (1841), had an Irish theme and dealt with a plot to trick a miser out of his money. The later Thomas Peckett Prest&#x27;s &quot;The Miser of Shoreditch or the Curse of Avarice&quot; (1854) was based on a penny dreadful story by him; later he adapted it as a two-act romantic drama set in time of Henry VIII.

The popularity of these theatrical misers is evident from the number of paintings and drawings based on them, many of which were then adapted as prints. In 18th-century England, it was Fielding&#x27;s &quot;The Miser&quot; that attracted most attention. Samuel Wale&#x27;s drawing of the second act was also made into a print. But it was principally depictions of various actors in the character of Lovegold, the play&#x27;s anti-hero, which attracted artists. Samuel De Wilde pictured William Farren in the role at the Theatre Royal, Bath. Several other works became plates in one or another book dedicated to English drama. James Roberts II (1753 – c. 1810) executed a pen and ink watercolour of Edward Shuter in character which was adapted as a print for the six-volume play collection, &quot;Bell&#x27;s British Theatre&quot;. Charles Reuben Ryley made a print of Thomas Ryder in the role for &quot;Lowndes&#x27; British Theatre&quot; (1788), while Thomas Parkinson&#x27;s painting of Richard Yates as Lovegold was adapted for the 1776 edition of that work. In the following century, Thomas Charles Wageman&#x27;s dramatic head and shoulders drawing of William Farren as Lovegold illustrated William Oxberry&#x27;s collection of texts, &quot;The New English Drama&quot; (1820). From this time too dates the coloured print of Samuel Vale acting the part of Goliah Spiderlimb, the comic servant in Jerrold&#x27;s &quot;The Smoked Miser&quot;.

Molière&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Avare&quot; was not altogether eclipsed in England by the work adapted from it. A drawing by William Hogarth of the play&#x27;s denouement was included as a print in the translation of Molière&#x27;s work and prints based upon it were made by various other engravers. William Powell Frith devoted one of his theatrical paintings to a scene from L&#x27;Avare in 1876 while the French actor Grandmesnil in the role of Harpagon was painted by Jean-Baptiste François Desoria.

In addition, the challenging and complex part of Shylock was favoured by English artists. Johann Zoffany painted Charles Macklin in the role that had brought him fame at the Covent Garden Theatre (1767–68) and Thomas Gray portrayed a confrontation between Shylock and his daughter Jessica (1868). Character portraits of other actors in Shylock&#x27;s role have included Henry Urwick (1859–1931) by Walter Chamberlain Urwick (1864-1943), Herbert Beerbohm Tree by Charles Buchel and Arthur Bourchier, also by Buchel.

===Fiction===
Characterisation of misers has been a frequent focus in prose fiction:
* The miserly priest who was Lazarillo de Tormes&#x27; second master in the Spanish picaresque novel published in 1554.
* Yan Jiansheng in an episode of &quot;The Scholars&quot; by Wu Jingzi (吳敬梓), written about 1750. This miser was unable to die easily until a wasteful second wick was removed from the lamp at his bedside.
*Jean-Esther van Gobseck – an affluent usurer in the novel &quot;Gobseck&quot; (1830) by Balzac.
*Felix Grandet – whose daughter is the title character in the novel &quot;Eugénie Grandet&quot; (1833) by Balzac.
*Fardarougha Donovan in the Irish William Carleton&#x27;s &quot;Fardarougha the Miser&quot; (1839).
*John Scarve – in the novel &quot;The Miser&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1842) by William Harrison Ainsworth. 
*Ebenezer Scrooge – the lead character of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; (1843) by Charles Dickens. He may have been partly based on John Elwes. The story has been adapted many times for stage and screen.
*Mr. Prokharchin – title character of the short story &quot;Mr. Prokharchin&quot; (1846) by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.
*Uncle Jan and his nephew Thijs in Hendrik Conscience&#x27;s novel of Flemish peasant life, &quot;De Gierigaard&quot; (1853, translated into English as &quot;The Miser&quot; in 1855).
*Silas Marner – title character of George Eliot&#x27;s novel &quot;Silas Marner&quot; (1861), who eventually abandons his avaricious ways.
*Ebenezer Balfour the villain of Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1886), which is set during the Jacobite disturbances in 18th century Scotland. Attempting to deprive his nephew David (the hero of the novel) of his inheritance, he arranges to have the young man kidnapped.
*Francisco Torquemada, the main character in Perez Galdós&#x27; &quot;Torquemada en la hoguera&quot; (Toquemada on the pire, 1889). The novel is centred on a Madrid moneylender who had appeared incidentally in earlier novels of his and now had three more devoted to him: &quot;Torquemada en la cruz&quot; (Toquemada on the cross, 1893), &quot;Torquemada en el purgatorio&quot; (Toquemada in Purgatory, 1894) and &quot;Torquemada y San Pedro&quot; (Torquemada and Saint Peter, 1895). All of these deal with Spanish social trends in the closing years of the 19th century.
*Trina McTeague, the miserly wife in &quot;McTeague: a story of San Francisco&quot; (1899) by Frank Norris. As avarice slowly overtakes her, she withdraws her savings so that she can gloat over the money and even roll about in it. The book was the basis for a silent film in 1916 and Erich von Stroheim&#x27;s &quot;Greed&quot; in 1924. More recently, it was also the basis for William Bolcom&#x27;s opera &quot;McTeague&quot; (1992).
*Henry Earlforward in Arnold Bennett&#x27;s novel &quot;Riceyman Steps&quot; (1923), who makes life miserable for the wife who married him in the hope of security.
*Séraphin Poudrier, the central figure in Claude-Henri Grignon&#x27;s &quot;Un Homme et son péché&quot; (1933). This French-Canadian novel was translated into English as &quot;The Woman and the Miser&quot; in 1978. Set at the end of the 19th century, the novel broke with the convention of extolling rural life and depicts a miser who mistreats his wife and lets her die because calling in a doctor would cost money. There have been adaptations for stage, radio, TV and two films, of which the most recent was &quot;Séraphin: un homme et son péché&quot; (2002), titled Séraphin: Heart of Stone in the English-language version.

There were beside many other prolific and once popular novelists who addressed themselves to the subject of miserliness. For the most part theirs were genre works catering to readers in the circulating libraries of the 19th century. Among them was the gothic novel &quot;The miser and his family&quot; (1800) by Eliza Parsons and Catherine Hutton&#x27;s &quot;The miser married&quot; (1813). The latter was an epistolary novel in which Charlotte Montgomery describes her own romantic affairs and in addition those of her mother, an unprincipled spendthrift who has just married the miser of the title. Another female novelist, Mary E. Bennett (1813–99), set her &quot;The Gipsy Bride or the Miser&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1841) in the 16th century. Mary Elizabeth Braddon&#x27;s Aurora Floyd (1863) was a successful sensation novel in which banknotes rather than gold are the object of desire and a motive for murder. It was dramatised the same year and later toured the US; in 1912 it was made a silent film. Later examples include Eliza Lynn Linton&#x27;s &quot;Paston Carew, Millionaire and Miser&quot; (1886); &quot;Miser Farebrother&quot; (1888) by Benjamin Leopold Farjeon; and &quot;Dollikins and the Miser&quot; (1890) by the American Frances Eaton. In 1904 Jerome K. Jerome created &quot;Nicholas Snyders, The Miser of Zandam&quot; in a sentimental story of the occult in which the Dutch merchant persuades a generous young man to exchange souls with him.

==Misers in art==
Mediaeval art works of Christian origin take a clear moral stance on the sin of avarice in its various manifestations. The frieze on the west wall of Lincoln Cathedral depicts the torments of Hell visited on those guilty of this sin, while Sassetta made &quot;The Blessed Ranieri showing the friars the soul of the Miser of Citerna carried to hell by demons&quot; a panel of an altarpiece (now in the Louvre).
But the bracketing of the miser and the usurer as equally culpable types, mentioned earlier, makes it difficult to interpret the subject of later moralistic paintings, since they may represent either a hoarder, a money lender or even a tax collector.

Such paintings cluster into recognisable genres, all of which point to the sinful nature of preoccupation with money for its own sake. Hieronymus Bosch&#x27;s panel of Death and the Miser, dating from the 1490s, started a fashion in depicting this subject among Low Countries artists. Bosch shows the miser on his deathbed, with various demons crowding about his possessions, while an angel supports him and directs his attention to higher things. The link between finance and the diabolical is also drawn by another Fleming, Jan Matsys, in his portrayal of the man of affairs being assisted in his double bookkeeping by a demon. The same connection is made in &quot;The devil and the usurer&quot; in the Valenciennes Musée des beaux-arts, formerly attributed to Pieter Bruegel the Younger, in which two devils pluck at the sleeve of a poorly dressed moneylender.

The Gospel Parable of the Rich Fool lies behind another series of paintings which stem ultimately from mediaeval illustrations of the Dance of Death. There a skeleton compels those from all walks of life, but particularly types of the rich and the powerful, to join him in his dance to the grave. In 1538 Hans Holbein the Younger initiated a popular treatment of this subject in which each type is separately illustrated, of which there were many imitations in succeeding centuries. Among the depictions is a man starting up in protest behind a table piled with wealth on which a skeleton is laying hands. In his print of 1651, Wenceslas Hollar makes the connection with the parable clear by quoting from it in the frame. A variation is provided by Jan Provoost&#x27;s 16th century diptych in which death confronts the man of affairs with his own account. A century later, Frans Francken the Younger treats the theme twice, in both versions of which a skeleton serenades a luxuriously dressed greybeard sitting at a table. Another curious variation occurs in Pieter Quast&#x27;s print of &quot;The Miser and Death&quot; (1643). Here the man sits at table clasping his money bags while contemplating a skull wearing a plumed hat, beside which is an hour-glass. The visitation of death is carried forward in the 19th century in similarly titled works. They include a portrayal by Franz Häussler (1845-1920) of an old man standing at his desk who peers round fearfully as he glimpses a skull reflected in a mirror. The charcoal and watercolour drawing by the Austrian Albert Plattner (1869–1919) is more ambiguous and has the figures facing away from each other in a cramped space.

Yet another genre was the Allegory of Avarice, of which one of the earliest examples is Albrecht Dürer&#x27;s painting of a naked old woman with a sack of coins (1507). This makes the point that age comes to all and confiscates all consolations. A woman is chosen as subject because the Latin &quot;avaritia&quot; is of the feminine gender. Low Countries artists who took up the allegorical theme added the variation of making the woman examine a coin by the light of a candle or lantern, as in the paintings by Gerrit van Honthorst and Mathias Stomer. In his own allegorical treatment, Paulus Moreelse made the link with the dance of death genre by introducing a young boy slyly fingering the coins while keeping a wary eye on the woman to see if she has noticed. These Dutch variations were mostly painted during the 1620s, when Rembrandt too borrowed the imagery, but his candlelit examiner of a coin is male and the piece is variously titled &quot;The Money Changer&quot; or &quot;The Rich Fool&quot;, in reference to the parable already mentioned. Jan Steen, on the other hand, makes his subject very obviously a miser who hugs a small sack of coins and holds one up for intent inspection.

In the Hieronymus Bosch &quot;Death and the Miser&quot;, the pull between spirituality and materialism is highlighted by making the deathbed a scene of conflict between the angel and demons. Quentin Matsys suggests the same polarity in his &quot;The moneylender and his wife&quot; (1514). Here the woman is studying a religious book while her husband is testing coins by weight. In the hands of the later Marinus van Reymerswaele the contrast disappears. The wife of his moneylender is shown helping with the bookkeeping and leaning sideways, as mesmerised as her husband by the pile of coins. Gillis van Tilborch&#x27;s painting of much the same scene is titled &quot;The Misers&quot; and again demonstrates the ambivalent targets of the moral message. The only difference is that the couple engaged in inspecting their money are old, as was the case in all the allegories of avarice. David Teniers the Younger depicted a couple similarly engaged in 1648 which was later engraved in France by Pierre-François Basan under the title &quot;Le plaisir des vieillards&quot; (the pleasures of old age). Verses as the bottom underline the moral: &quot;Why do you make/ such piles of gold?/ Soon you&#x27;ll grow old/ and Death takes all.

Another area of ambivalence centres on the kind of clothes worn by the so-called misers. The subject of Hendrik Gerritsz Pot&#x27;s painting from the 1640s in the Uffizi is fashionably dressed and wearing a ring. He may be inspired by the wealth and jewelry piled on his table, but he obviously has no objection to advertising his well-to-do status. On the other hand, the &quot;Miser Casting His Accounts&quot; presented by Jan Lievens is poorly dressed and his interest in hoarding is indicated by the way he gloats on the key that will lock his money away. The same dichotomy occurs in later centuries. Jean-Baptiste Le Prince&#x27;s miser is also richly robed as he sits surrounded by his possessions, while Theodore Bernard Heuvel&#x27;s miser sits on the chest containing his hoard and looks anxiously over his shoulder. Paul Gavarni&#x27;s miser shows much the same apprehension as he leans on the table where his money is piled and glances round suspiciously.

A sub-theme of this kind of contrast occurred in Hans Holbein the Younger&#x27;s &quot;The Miser and his Mistress&quot;. There a young woman in luxuriant Renaissance dress stands behind an ugly miser, reaching across him to take coins from the money bags he clutches to his chest, while he looks up at her, crying out with a grimace and trying to push away her hand. An updated version by Philip Dawe was published as a print in 1773 under the title of &quot;The Scramble, or Old Gripus plunder&#x27;d by his Young Wife&quot;. Underneath is a verse commentary: 
:::How hard is the conflict, yet claims ridicule,
:::When doting and avarice possess an old fool!
:::His wife while she plunders with smiles and caresses,
:::At once cools his love and his avarice distresses.
Literary manifestations of the theme of the mismatched couple include the Malbecco episode in &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; and Catherine Hutton&#x27;s novel &quot;The Miser Married&quot;.

English depictions of misers in the 18th century begin as genre paintings. Gainsborough Dupont&#x27;s poorly dressed character clutches a bag of coin and looks up anxiously in the painting in the Ashmolean Museum. John Cranch (1751-1821) pictures two armed desperadoes breaking in on his. However, it is in the realm of satirical prints that the most inventiveness is found. James Gillray does not neglect the moral dimension either in his &quot;The miser&#x27;s feast&quot; (1786). He is pictured seated at a table eating a meager meal, attended by Death in the guise of an emaciated and naked manservant holding in his right hand a tray with a bone on it and behind him, in his left hand, the dart of death. Famine, a withered hag naked to the waist, is also in attendance wearing a large hat and fashionable skirt. These characters are identified by the verse at the bottom: &quot;What else can follow but destructive fate,/When Famine holds the cup and Death the plate?&quot;

Among other details in Gillray&#x27;s crowded print is a fashionably dressed prostitute coming through the door. Lechery was supposed to be an attribute of some misers, exposing them to a contest between satisfying this weakness and their overmastering passion to save expense, as exemplified in the Old Gripus print. Thomas Rowlandson points to one solution of his dilemma in a print showing a miser engaged with two nude prostitutes whom has hired for the price of one. In another Rowlandson revisits the theme of the meager feast, depicting his miser crouched by an empty grate and keeping himself warm by hugging his money-bags. A hag enters, bringing a tiny portion to eat on a plate which a famished cat scrambles to reach. One more dichotomy explored by Rowlandson appears in his watercolour of &quot;The spendthrift and the miser&quot;. The drunken young man alarming the miser there is probably his son, taking up a literary theme to be found, among other places, in Allan Ramsay&#x27;s comic monologue. It will be remembered too that the thriftless ne&#x27;er-do-well of &quot;A Rake&#x27;s Progress&quot; inherited his money from a miserly father.

By the end of the 19th century the theme of the miser was distancing itself from the simple moralities of journeyman painters and becoming a subject for aristocratic amateurs. The Empress Maria Feodorovna&#x27;s miser of 1890 handles a small strongbox. The Indian Raja Ravi Varma paints a Jewish character type for his miser, dated 1901, while the Hungarian nobleman Ladislav Medňanský titles his humanised study &quot;Shylock&quot; (1900). Apart from them, there is an etching by James Abbott McNeill Whistler which emphasises the essential isolation of such figures. His enigmatic &quot;The Miser&quot; of 1860 pictures an individual of indeterminate gender seated with its back to the viewer in the corner of a bare room next to the window. He is looking down as if examining something and the room behind him is spartanly furnished with just a table and bench, while a broadsheet is tacked to the wall.

<text>Pierre Louis Bernac (né Bertin; 12 January 1899 – 17 October 1979) was a French singer, a baryton-martin, known as an interpreter of the French mélodie. He had a close artistic association with Francis Poulenc, with whom he performed in France and abroad. Poulenc wrote 90 songs for him during their 25-year musical partnership.

Bernac was well known as a teacher; among the singers who studied with him were Elly Ameling, Grace Bumbry, Mattiwilda Dobbs, Carol Neblett, Jessye Norman and Gérard Souzay. He gave masterclasses in France, Britain and the US.

In retirement, Bernac wrote two highly regarded books about the interpretation of mélodies in general and Poulenc&#x27;s in particular.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Born Pierre Bertin in Paris on 12 January 1899, he started his working career in his father&#x27;s brokerage house. He later changed his surname to Bernac to avoid confusion with the actor Pierre Bertin. He began taking singing lessons at the age of 18, and was first taught by the composer André Caplet. He was later coached by Yvonne Gouverné, who accompanied him at his first recital, in Paris, in 1925. He studied German lieder with Reinhold von Warlich in Salzburg, but it was as an interpreter of French mélodie that he became best known.

Bernac&#x27;s name came to be closely linked with that of the composer and pianist Francis Poulenc. They gave the first performance of Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Chansons gaillardes&quot; in 1926, but it was another eight years before they worked together again. In 1933 Bernac made the first of only two excursions into opera, as Pelléas in &quot;Pélleas et Mélisande&quot; at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées. His only other operatic appearance was in the same role in Geneva, conducted by Ernest Ansermet in 1936.

In 1934 Bernac, visiting the Salzburg Festival, was asked at short notice to give a Debussy recital. Having no accompanist and knowing that Poulenc was in Salzburg, Bernac sent him a three-line note: &quot;I have been asked to sing some Debussy in three days&#x27; time. Would you agree to accompany me? Handsome fee, give me your reply quickly&quot;. Poulenc agreed, and they found their musical rapport so great that they decided to form a musical partnership.

===Partnership with Poulenc===
Bernac and Poulenc introduced their partnership to Paris at the École normale de musique on 3 April 1935, when they gave the premiere of Poulenc&#x27;s &quot;Cinq poèmes de Paul Eluard&quot;. They continued to perform together for 25 years, in France and abroad, until Bernac retired. They built up a repertory, based on Poulenc&#x27;s own songs, but also exploring the works of other prominent French songwriters from the 17th to the 20th centuries, and including songs by Brahms, Mompou, Schubert, Schumann, Verdi and others.

They began performing outside France quite soon after launching their partnership: in November 1935 they performed at the French embassy in London at a reception for the Duke and Duchess of York, the following year they broadcast the first of many recitals together on the BBC, and their first British tour, in 1939, took in four cities in addition to London. The Second World War delayed their American debut until 1948; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said of Bernac, &quot;the integrity and elegance of his singing quickly won him a following among connoisseurs of art song interpretation&quot;.

Poulenc wrote 90 songs for Bernac, &quot;his style influenced by the baritone&#x27;s peculiarly refined artistry&quot;, according to &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;. Although Bernac avoided the operatic stage after 1936, Poulenc relied on him for technical advice on vocal matters when writing his opera &quot;Dialogues des Carmélites&quot;, and his late Gloria. Poulenc said that his association with Bernac was the reason why he wrote so many songs. &quot;No one will ever sing them better than Bernac, who knows the inner secrets of my music. It was also through accompanying him in Schubert, Schumann, Fauré, Debussy and Ravel that I learnt my trade as a melodist.&quot; Other composers who wrote for Bernac include, from France, André Jolivet, Henri Sauguet and Jean Françaix; from Germany, Paul Hindemith; from England, Lennox Berkeley; and from the US, Samuel Barber.

Bernac retired from the concert platform in 1959, when he was 60.

===Teacher===
While still active as a singer, Bernac was also a teacher. In &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary&quot;, Alan Blyth says of Bernac, &quot;Among his many pupils the most distinguished was Gérard Souzay, whose style owed much to Bernac&#x27;s example&quot;. Others who studied with Bernac include Elly Ameling, Grace Bumbry, Mattiwilda Dobbs, Carol Neblett and Jessye Norman.
&quot;The Musical Times&quot; called him &quot;an outstanding teacher of song interpretation – visionary, precise, tireless and loving.&quot; In retirement, Bernac conducted masterclasses in France, Britain and the US and was on the faculty of the American Conservatory, Fontainebleau.

===Writer===

====&quot;The Interpretation of French Song&quot; (1970)====

Bernac wrote two books: &quot;The Interpretation of French Song&quot; (1970) and &quot;Francis Poulenc: The Man and His Songs&quot; (1977). He wrote the first in English for the guidance of English-speaking singers. He explained in his preface that he had space for only the most outstanding composers; nevertheless the book covers 200 mélodies by 18 composers, from Berlioz to Poulenc, via Gounod, Franck, Lalo, Saint-Saëns, Delibes, Bizet, Massenet, Duparc, Chabrier, Chausson, Fauré, Debussy, Satie, Caplet, Roussel and Ravel.

In the first of the three introductory chapters Bernac describes the role of the concert singer and the significance of &quot;interpretation&quot; – bringing the words and music to life through imagination and personal vision, with unceasing respect for the composer&#x27;s indications and for the inseparability of the text and its music. The second chapter consists of technical advice on French vowel and consonant sounds and their proper vocal production. The third analyses the differences between the French mélodie and the German lied. The bulk of the book consists of analyses of the various composers&#x27; techniques, with detailed advice to singers. The reviewer in the American journal &quot;Notes&quot; called the book a masterpiece, and his counterpart in the British &quot;Music &amp; Letters&quot; called it &quot;a &#x27;must&#x27; for any serious student of the French repertory&quot;.

====&quot;Francis Poulenc: The Man and His Songs&quot; (1977)====

The second book was written in French, but first published in English translation. In 1977 Gollancz in London and Norton in New York published a translation by Winifred Radford. The original French text was published in Paris by Buchet-Chastel the following year as &quot;Francis Poulenc et ses mélodies&quot;. Bernac used an approach similar to that in his earlier book: a short biographical study of Poulenc is followed by a discussion of the composer&#x27;s style and the singer&#x27;s approach to it, and the bulk of the book considers the songs individually, grouped by the various poets&#x27; names. Reviewing the English edition, &quot;The Musical Times&quot; said &quot;This is not just a book about Poulenc songs. With its fine literary style … it is an unselfconscious exposé of the spirit of being French, and an object lesson in how to approach any musical repertory with a high degree of rationale, but above all a warm heart&quot;. The English edition has a preface by Sir Lennox Berkeley and the French by Henri Sauguet.

===Last years and legacy===
Bernac did not marry and had no children. He died, following a series of heart attacks, in Villeneuve-lès-Avignon on 17 October 1979, aged 80.

The Friends of the Académie Ravel in Saint-Jean-de-Luz awards the Pierre Bernac Prize in Song (Prix de chant Pierre Bernac). In 1980 Berkeley became the first president of &quot;The Friends of Pierre Bernac&quot;, a charitable trust set up to promote the reissue of Bernac&#x27;s recordings.

<text>Virgilio Barco Vargas (17 September 1921 – 20 May 1997) was a Colombian politician and civil engineer who served as the 27th President of Colombia serving from 7 August 1986 to 7 August 1990.

==Early life==
Barco was born in Cúcuta in the Norte de Santander Department of Colombia to Jorge Enrique Barco Maldonado and Julieta Vargas Durán. He studied Civil Engineering at the National University of Colombia and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from which he graduated in 1943. He entered politics in 1943 when he became a city council member for the Liberal Party in the town of Durania. He was then elected to the lower house of Congress, but went into exile to the US in 1950 because of violence between liberals and conservatives. His daughter, Carolina Barco Isakson (who would later become a Colombian politician herself) was born there. He obtained an M.A. in economics at MIT, where he took classes under Nobel Prize winners Robert Solow and Paul Samuelson in 1952. In 1954 he obtained a PhD in economics from Boston University.

Barco is the grandson of Colombian General Virgilio Barco M., who developed one of the country&#x27;s largest oil concessions in 1905.

Barco returned to Colombia in 1954 to help negotiate the peace process which allowed the formation of the National Front between liberals and conservatives, which lasted two decades. He became a member of the Senate, the upper house of Congress in 1958, left to become the ambassador to Britain in 1961, and returned to Colombia in 1962. He served another term in the Senate until 1966, when he was elected mayor of Colombia&#x27;s capital, Bogotá. He served in that position until 1969, when he became a director of the World Bank until 1974. He then served as ambassador to the United States from 1977 until 1980.

===Presidency===

Barco was elected president of Colombia with 58% of the vote in 1986. He supported anti-poverty programs, renewed dialogue with leftist guerillas and fought drug traffickers. Though he was popular within the international community, he became less popular in Colombia because the drug traffickers became more violent after he started to move against them. His restrictive economic policies at first doomed the country. After two years of this, The Economic Openness program was initiated by his administration, which would open Colombian markets to the world and recharge the country&#x27;s economy. He served one 4-year term.

==Post-Presidency and death==
When he left the Presidency in 1990, he served as ambassador to Britain again until 1992.

Barco was diagnosed with cancer and he died on May 20, 1997, in Bogotá when he was 75. He is now buried in the Central Cemetery of Bogotá.

== Popular culture ==
* Barco is portrayed by the colombian actor Jorge Zúñiga as the character of Ramiro Vargas in TV series &quot;Pablo Escobar, The Drug Lord&quot;.

<doc id="915891" wikidata="Q173912" url="?curid=915891" title="Gary Hall Sr.">
<text>Gary Wayne Hall Sr. (born August 7, 1951) is an American former competitive swimmer, three-time Olympic medalist, and former world record-holder in five events. He is also a former ophthalmologist.

==Background==
Hall attended Indiana University, where he swam for the Indiana Hoosiers swimming and diving team under coach Doc Counsilman. As a college swimmer, he specialized in the individual medley. Hall was elected captain of the Hoosiers swimming team in his senior year. In academics, Hall excelled in the classroom and was consistently cited by the NCAA as an outstanding example of student-athlete. He was accepted for medical school at the University of Cincinnati. He later became an ophthalmologist, and practiced in Phoenix, Arizona.

Hall first represented the United States in the 1968 Summer Olympics held in Mexico City, Mexico, where he won a silver medal for his second-place finish in the men&#x27;s 400-meter individual medley. Two years later he broke the world record in the 200-meter butterfly.

Hall made it a point to vigorously exercise in the swimming pool after daily med school classes. His wife, the former Mary Keating, being from a swimming family, understood his love of the water.

At the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, he earned a silver medal in the men&#x27;s 200-meter butterfly. His final Olympic appearance was at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, Canada, capping his Olympic career with a bronze medal in the men&#x27;s 100-meter butterfly. At the end of the Montreal Olympics, his fellow American athletes from all sports disciplines chose him to be the U.S. flagbearer in the closing ceremony.

==Ophthalmologist career==
Hall graduated from the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, located in Cincinnati, Ohio. He practiced as Gary Hall, MD as an ophthalmologist in Phoenix, Arizona at the Gary Hall Lasik Center. Common conditions he treated in ophthalmology included macular degeneration and cataracts. Hall was a recipient of the NCAA Silver Anniversary Award for his outstanding career in ophthalmology. 

==History of malpractice in ophthalmology==

In January 1996, Hall was ordered by the Arizona Medical Board to spend three years on probation and to pay the board $10,000 to cover the costs of an investigation, the details of which are no longer on the board&#x27;s site. In October 1999, he was placed on probation for three more years and was censured for unprofessional conduct, permanently prohibited from performing certain procedures, forced to take additional educational courses, and pay a penalty of $15,000. In April 2005, the Arizona Medical Board placed Hall on probation for another five years, with the demand that he never perform surgery again.

In October 2009, after being found in violation of the Arizona Medical Board&#x27;s demands, the board stripped Hall of his medical license. The Board found that Hall had been guilty of unprofessional conduct, negligence, and incompetence in his practice.

A 1998 article from the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot; indicated that Hall had 121 complaints lodged against him to the Arizona Medical Board since he began practicing in 1982. It is unknown how many complaints he had accumulated by 2009 when his license was finally revoked.

An article from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that as of June 2000, Hall had paid over $5.3 million in medical malpractice claims and was listed 27 times in the federal database for medical malpractice.

==International Swimming Hall of Fame==
In 1981, Hall was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame as an &quot;Honor Swimmer.&quot; Later on, he also became a local celebrity in Phoenix, as an ophthalmologist – appearing in his office&#x27;s television ads and billboard campaigns.

His son Gary Hall Jr. became a famous Olympic swimmer as well, starting in the Atlanta 1996 Olympic Games, getting various gold medals at the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. With his son&#x27;s participation at the 2004 Olympics in Athens, Greece, the Halls became the first father-and-son pair to make three Olympic appearances.

== Swimming camps==
Gary Hall Sr. currently lives in San Diego and operates The Race Club swimming camps. The Race Club is a swimming club founded by Hall and his son Gary Hall Jr. The swimming club, originally known as &quot;The World Team,&quot; was designed to serve as a swimming training group for elite swimmers across the world in preparation for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games. To be able to train with The Race Club, one must either have been ranked in the top 20 in the world the past three calendar years or top three in their nation in the past year. The Race Club included such well-known swimmers as Roland Mark Schoeman, Mark Foster, Ryk Neethling, Milorad Čavić and Therese Alshammar. They were coached by University of Michigan coach Mike Bottom.

The Race Club provides facilities, swimming techniques coaching, swimming training programs, technical instruction, swimming technique videos, fitness and health programs for swimmers of all ages and abilities. The club&#x27;s summer swim camps are designed and tailored to satisfy each swimmer&#x27;s needs, whether one is trying to reach the Olympic Games or simply improve one&#x27;s swimming techniques or fitness level. The swimming camps programs are suitable for beginner swimmers, pleasure swimmers, fitness swimmers, USA swimming or YMCA swimmers, or triathletes; anyone who wants to improve swimming skills.

==Charles Keating IV==
Hall&#x27;s nephew is Chief petty officer Charles Keating IV, a Navy SEAL, who was killed at age 31 in combat with ISIS in Iraq in 2016. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross for his actions in combat.

<doc id="915901" wikidata="Q452379" url="?curid=915901" title="Diego Columbus">
<text>Diego Columbus (; ; ; 1479/1480 – February 23, 1526) was a navigator and explorer under the Kings of Castile and Aragón. He served as the 2nd Admiral of the Indies, 2nd Viceroy of the Indies and 4th Governor of the Indies as a vassal to the Kings of Castile and Aragón. He was the eldest son of Christopher Columbus and his wife Filipa Moniz Perestrelo.

He was born in Portugal, either in Porto Santo in 1479 or 1480, or in Lisbon in 1474. He spent most of his adult life trying to regain the titles and privileges granted to his father for his explorations and then denied in 1500. He was greatly aided in this goal by his marriage to María de Toledo y Rojas, niece of the 2nd Duke of Alba, who was the cousin of King Ferdinand.

==Early life==
Diego was made a page at the Spanish court in 1492, the year his father embarked on his first voyage. Diego had a younger half-brother, Fernando, by Beatriz Enríquez de Arana. 

Diego Columbus was taught by Christopher Columbus&#x27;s mistress, Beatriz De Arana, until he transferred to the Franciscan monastery of La Rabida, at the urging of Father Juan Perez and friar Horacio Crassocius, prominent Franciscans and occasional priests to his father. 

Ferdinand and Diego had been pages to Prince Don Juan, then became pages to Queen Isabella in 1497.

==Viceroy of the Indies==

In August 1508, he was named Governor of the Indies, the post his father had held, arriving in Santo Domingo in July 1509. He established his home (the Alcázar de Colón), which still stands in Santo Domingo, in what is now the Dominican Republic. In 1511 as Viceroy of the Indies, Diego Columbus commissioned Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar to go on an expedition from Santo Domingo to the newly acquired Spanish island of Cuba.

According to Floyd, Diego &quot;...was accompanied by a splendid entourage: his wife, Doña Maria, the first &quot;gran dama&quot; of the New World, the Duke of Alba&#x27;s niece, with her own suite of &quot;doncellas&quot;; and his immediate relatives - Fernando his half-brother, his two uncles, Diego and Bartolomé, and his cousins, Andrea and Giovanni. Also on the expedition were his criados and his father&#x27;s old retainers: Marcos de Aguilar, his forthright &quot;alcalde mayor&quot;, Diego Mendez, his business manager, and Gerónimo de Agüero, his former tutor. Other loyal &quot;Colombistas&quot; met him at Santo Domingo - his uncle by marriage, Francisco de Garay, whom he named &quot;alguacil mayor&quot;, and Bartolomé&#x27;s &quot;criados&quot;, Miguel Díaz, Diego Velázquez, and Juan Cerón. His coming represented the permanent establishment of the most titled and notable family in the islands, at least for many years.&quot;

In 1511, a royal council declared Hispaniola, Puerto Rico, Jamaica and Cuba under Diego&#x27;s power &quot;by right of his father.&quot; However, Uraba and Veragua were deemed excluded, since the council regarded them as being discovered by Rodrigo de Bastidas. The council further confirmed Diego&#x27;s titles of Viceroy and admiral were hereditary, though honorific. Furthermore, Diego had the right to one-tenth of the net royal income. However, factions soon formed between those loyal to Diego and Ferdinand&#x27;s royal officials. Matters deteriorated to the point that Ferdinand recalled Diego in 1514. Diego then spent the next five years in Spain &quot;futilely pressing his claims.&quot; Finally, in 1520, Diego&#x27;s powers were restored by Charles.

Diego returned to Santo Domingo on 12 November 1520 in the midst of a native revolt against Spanish rule in the area of the Franciscan missions on the Cumana River, which was the site of Spanish slave raids, alongside the salt and pearl trades. Diego sent Gonzalo de Ocampo on a punitive expedition with 200 men and 6 ships. Then in 1521, Diego invested in Bartolomé de las Casas&#x27; enterprise to settle the Cumana area. That failure, blamed on Diego, meant the loss of the king&#x27;s confidence. That loss, plus Diego&#x27;s defiance of royal power on Cuba, forced Charles to reprimand Diego in 1523 and recall him back to Spain.

The first major slave rebellion in the Americas occurred in Santo Domingo on 26 December 1522, when enslaved Jolof laborers working on Diego&#x27;s sugar plantation started a revolt. During the rebellion, many formerly enslaved insurgents managed to escape into the mountainous interior of the colony, where they established independent maroon communities amongst the surviving Taíno. However, a lot of rebels were captured, and the Admiral had them hanged.

==Death and legacy==
After his death, a compromise was reached in 1536 in which his son, Luis Colón de Toledo, was named Admiral of the Indies and renounced all other rights for a perpetual annuity of 10,000 ducats, the island of Jamaica as a fief, an estate of 25 square leagues on the Isthmus of Panama, then called Veragua, and the titles of Duke of Veragua and Marquess of Jamaica.

After Columbus&#x27;s death on February 23, 1526, in Spain, the rents, offices and titles in the New World went into dispute by his descendants.

==Marriage and children==
He initially planned to marry Mencia de Guzman, daughter of the Duke of Medina Sidonia., but he was forced by King Fernando to marry the king&#x27;s cousin María de Toledo y Rojas (c. 1490 – May 11, 1549), who secured the transportation and burial of her father-in-law, Christopher Columbus, in Santo Domingo. She was the daughter of Fernando Alvarez de Toledo, 1st Lord of Villoria, son of García Álvarez de Toledo, 1st Duke of Alba, and his first wife María de Rojas, and had the following children:

* Juana Colón de Toledo (died c. 1592), married her cousin Luis de La Cueva y Toledo; their only child was María Colón de la Cueva (c. 1548-c.1600) who claimed the duchy of Veragua and died in New Spain (México).
* Isabel Colón de Toledo (c. 1515 –), married Don Jorge Alberto de Portugal y Melo (1470 –), 1st Count of Gelves (who married secondly; his 1st marriage to Dona Guiomar de Ataíde remained childless), son of Don Álvaro de Bragança, Lord of Tentúgal, Póvoa, Buarcos and Cadaval and Chancellor-Major of the Realm of Portugal. Their grandson, D. Nuno Álvares Pereira Colón y Portugal, Duke of Veragua and Admiral of the Indies became regent of the Kingdom of Portugal from 1621 until his death.
