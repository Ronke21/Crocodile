<text>Ion Luca Caragiale (; – 9 June 1912), commonly referred to as I. L. Caragiale, was a Romanian playwright, short story writer, poet, theater manager, political commentator and journalist. Leaving behind an important cultural legacy, he is considered one of the greatest playwrights in Romanian language and literature, as well as one of its most important writers and a leading representative of local humour. Alongside Mihai Eminescu, Ioan Slavici and Ion Creangă, he is seen as one of the main representatives of &quot;Junimea&quot;, an influential literary society with which he nonetheless parted during the second half of his life. His work, spanning four decades, covers the ground between Neoclassicism, Realism, and Naturalism, building on an original synthesis of foreign and local influences.

Although few in number, Caragiale&#x27;s plays constitute the most accomplished expression of Romanian theatre, as well as being important venues for criticism of late-19th-century Romanian society. They include the comedies &quot;O noapte furtunoasă&quot;, &quot;Conu Leonida față cu reacțiunea&quot;, &quot;O scrisoare pierdută&quot;, and the tragedy &quot;Năpasta&quot;. In addition to these, Caragiale authored a large number of essays, articles, short stories, novellas and sketch stories, as well as occasional works of poetry and autobiographical texts such as &quot;Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur&quot;. In many cases, his creations were first published in one of several magazines he edited — &quot;Claponul&quot;, &quot;Vatra&quot;, and &quot;Epoca&quot;. In some of his later fiction writings, including &quot;La hanul lui Mânjoală&quot;, &quot;Kir Ianulea&quot;, &quot;Abu-Hasan,&quot; &quot;Pastramă trufanda&quot; and &quot;Calul dracului&quot;, Caragiale adopted the fantasy genre or turned to historical fiction.

Ion Luca Caragiale was interested in the politics of the Romanian Kingdom, and oscillated between the liberal current and conservatism. Most of his satirical works target the liberal republicans and the National Liberals, evidencing both his respect for their rivals at &quot;Junimea&quot; and his connections with the literary critic Titu Maiorescu. He came to clash with National Liberal leaders such as Dimitrie Sturdza and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, and was a lifelong adversary of the Symbolist poet Alexandru Macedonski. As a result of these conflicts, the most influential of Caragiale&#x27;s critics barred his access to the cultural establishment for several decades. During the 1890s, Caragiale rallied with the radical movement of George Panu, before associating with the Conservative Party. After having decided to settle in Berlin, he came to voice strong criticism for Romanian politicians of all colours in the wake of the 1907 Romanian Peasants&#x27; Revolt, and ultimately joined the Conservative-Democratic Party of Tache Ionescu.

He was both a friend and rival to writers such as Mihai Eminescu, Titu Maiorescu, and Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, while maintaining contacts with, among others, the &quot;Junimist&quot; essayist Iacob Negruzzi, the socialist philosopher Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea, the literary critic Paul Zarifopol, the poets George Coșbuc and Mite Kremnitz, the psychologist Constantin Rădulescu-Motru, and the Transylvanian poet and activist Octavian Goga. Ion Luca was the nephew of Costache and Iorgu Caragiale, who were major figures of the 19th century Romanian theatre. His sons Mateiu and Luca were both modernist writers.

==Biography==

===Background and name===
Ion Luca Caragiale was born into a family of Greek descent, whose members first arrived in Wallachia soon after 1812, during the rule of Prince Ioan Gheorghe Caragea—Ștefan Caragiali, as his grandfather was known locally, worked as a cook for the court in Bucharest. 

Ion Luca&#x27;s father, who reportedly originated from the Ottoman capital of Istanbul, settled in Prahova County as the curator of the Mărgineni Monastery (which, at the time, belonged to the Greek Orthodox Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery of Mount Sinai). Known to locals as Luca Caragiali, he later built a reputation as a lawyer and judge in Ploiești, and married Ecaterina, the daughter of a merchant from the Transylvanian town of Brașov. Her maiden name was given as &quot;Alexovici&quot; (&quot;Alexevici&quot;) or as &quot;Karaboa&quot; (&quot;Caraboa&quot;). She is known to have been Greek herself, and, according to historian Lucian Nastasă, some of her relatives were Hungarian members of the Tabay family. The couple also had a daughter, named Lenci.

Ion Luca&#x27;s uncles, Costache and Iorgu Caragiale, managed theater troupes and were very influential figures in the development of early Romanian theatre — in Wallachia and Moldavia alike. Luca Caragiali had himself performed with his brothers during his youth, before opting to settle down. All three had stood criticism for not taking part in the Wallachian Revolution, and defended themselves through a brochure printed in 1848. The Caragiali brothers had two sisters, Ecaterina and Anastasia.

Especially in his old age, the writer emphasized his family&#x27;s humble background and his status as a self-made man. On one occasion, he defined the landscape of his youth as &quot;the quagmires of Ploiești&quot;. Although it prompted his biographer Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea to define him as &quot;a proletarian&quot;, Caragiale&#x27;s account was disputed by several other researchers, who noted that the family had a good social standing.

Ion Luca Caragiale was discreet about his ethnic origin for the larger part of his life. In parallel, his foreign roots came to the attention of his adversaries, who used them as arguments in various polemics. As his relations with Caragiale degenerated into hostility, Mihai Eminescu is known to have referred to his former friend as &quot;that Greek swindler&quot;. Aware of such treatment, the writer considered all references to his lineage to be insults. On several occasions, he preferred to indicate that he was &quot;of obscure birth&quot;.
Nevertheless, as literary critic Tudor Vianu noted, Caragiale&#x27;s outlook on life was explicitly Balkanic and Oriental, which, in Vianu&#x27;s view, mirrored a type &quot;which must have been found in his lineage&quot;. A similar opinion was expressed by Paul Zarifopol, who speculated that Caragiale&#x27;s conservative mindset was possibly owed to the &quot;lazyness of one true Oriental&quot; (elsewhere, he referred to the writer as &quot;a lazy southerner, fitted with definitely supranormal intelligence and imagination&quot;).

In his main work on the history of Romanian literature, George Călinescu included Caragiale among a group of &quot;Balkan&quot; writers, whose middle class status and often foreign origin, he argued, set them apart irrespective of their period—others in this category were, in chronological order, Anton Pann, Tudor Arghezi, Ion Minulescu, Urmuz, Mateiu Caragiale, and Ion Barbu. In contrast, critic Garabet Ibrăileanu proposed that Caragiale&#x27;s Wallachian origin was of particular importance, serving to explain his political choices and alleged social bias.

On one occasion, Caragiale mentioned that his paternal grandfather was &quot;a Greek cook&quot;. In several contexts, he referred to his roots as being in the island of Hydra. In one of his photographs, he posed in Oriental costume and sitting cross-legged, which was interpreted by Vianu as an additional reference to his Balkan background. Two of his biographers, Zarifopol and Șerban Cioculescu, noted that a section of Caragiale&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;Kir Ianulea&quot; was a likely self-reference: in that fragment of text, the Christian Devil, disguised as an Arvanite trader, is shown taking pride in his Romanian language skills.

Investigations carried out by the Center of Theatric Research in Athens, Greece and made public in 2002 offered an alternative take on the Caragiales&#x27; origin. According to this perspective, Ștefan Caragiali was a native of Kefalonia, and his original surname, &quot;Karaialis&quot;, was changed on Prince Caragea&#x27;s request. Various authors also believe that Caragiale&#x27;s ancestors were Albanian or Aromanian.

Originally, Ion Luca was known as &quot;Ioanne L. Caragiali&quot;. His family and friends knew him as &quot;Iancu&quot; or, rarely, &quot;Iancuțu&quot;—both being antiquated hypocoristics of &quot;Ion&quot;. The definitive full version of his name features the syllable &quot;ca&quot; twice in a row, which is generally avoided in Romanian due to its scatological connotations. It has however become one of the few cacophonies accepted by the Romanian Academy.

===Early years===

Born in the village of Haimanale, Prahova County (the present-day I. L. Caragiale commune, Dâmbovița County), Caragiale was educated in Ploiești. During his early years, as he later indicated, he learned reading and writing with a teacher at the Romanian Orthodox Church of Saint George. Soon after, he was taught literary Romanian by the Transylvanian-born Bazilie Dragoșescu (whose influence on his use of the language he was to acknowledge in one of his later works). At the age of seven, he witnessed enthusiastic celebrations of the Danubian Principalities&#x27; union, with the election of Moldavia&#x27;s Alexandru Ioan Cuza as Prince of Wallachia; Cuza&#x27;s subsequent reforms were to be an influence on the political choices Caragiale made in his old age. The new ruler visited his primary school later in 1859, being received with enthusiasm by Dragoșescu and all his pupils.

Caragiale completed gymnasium at the Sfinții Petru și Pavel school in the city, and never pursued any form of higher education. He was probably enlisted directly in the second grade, as records do not show him to have attended or graduated the first year. Notably, Caragiale was taught history by Constantin Iennescu, who was later the mayor of Ploiești. The young Caragiale opted to follow in his uncles&#x27; footsteps, and was taught declamation and mimic art by Costache at the latter&#x27;s theater school in Bucharest, where he was accompanied by his mother and sister. It is also probable that he was a supernumerary actor for the National Theater Bucharest. He was not able to find full employment in this field, and, around the age of 18, worked as a copyist for the Prahova County Tribunal. Throughout his life, Caragiale refused to talk about his training in the theater, and hid it from the people closest to him (including his wife Alexandrina Burelly, who came from an upper middle class environment).

In 1866, Caragiale witnessed Cuza&#x27;s toppling by a coalition of conservatives and liberals — as he later acknowledged in his &quot;Grand Hotel &quot;Victoria Română&quot;&quot;, he and his friends agreed to support the move by voting &quot;yes&quot; during a subsequent plebiscite, and, with tacit approval from the new authorities, even did so several times each. By the age of 18, he was an enthusiastic supporter of the liberal current, and sympathized with its republican ideals. In 1871, he witnessed the Republic of Ploiești — a short-lived stated created by the liberal groups, in an attempt to oust &quot;Domnitor&quot; Carol I (the future King of Romania). Later in life, as his opinions veered towards conservatism, Caragiale ridiculed both the attempted &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and his participation in it.

He returned to Bucharest later that year, after manager Mihail Pascaly hired him as one of the prompts at the National Theater in the capital, a period about which he reminisced in his &quot;Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur&quot;. The poet Mihai Eminescu, with whom Ion Luca was to have cordial relations as well as rivalries, had previously been employed for the same position by the manager Iorgu Caragiale. In addition to his growing familiarity with the repertoire, the young Caragiale educated himself by reading the philosophical works of Enlightenment-era &quot;philosophes&quot;. It was also recorded that, at some point between 1870 and 1872, he was employed in the same capacity by the Moldavian National Theater in Iași. During the period, Caragiale also proofread for various publications and worked as a tutor.

===Literary debut===

Ion Luca made his literary debut in 1873, at the age of 21, with poems and humorous chronicles printed in G. Dem. Teodorescu&#x27;s liberal-inspired satirical magazine, &quot;Ghimpele&quot;. He published relatively few articles under various pen names — among them &quot;Car.&quot;, the contraction of his family name, and the more elaborate &quot;Palicar&quot;. He mostly performed basic services for the editorial staff and its printing press, given that, after Luca Caragiali died in 1870, he was the sole provider for his mother and sister. Following his return to Bucharest, he became even more involved with the radical and republican wing of the liberal trend—a movement commonly referred to as &quot;the Reds&quot;. As he later confessed, he frequently attended its congresses, witnessing the speeches held by Reds leader C. A. Rosetti; he thus became intimately acquainted with a Populist discourse, which he later parodied in his works. Working for &quot;Ghimpele&quot;, he made the acquaintance of republican writer N. T. Orășanu.

Several of his articles for &quot;Ghimpele&quot; were sarcastic in tone, and targeted various literary figures of the day. In June 1874, Caragiale amused himself at the expense of N. D. Popescu-Popnedea, the author of popular almanacs, whose taste he questioned. Soon after, he ridiculed the rising poet Alexandru Macedonski, who had publicized his claim that he was a &quot;Count Geniadevsky&quot;, and thus of Polish origin. The article contributed by Caragiale, in which he speculated that Macedonski (referred to with the anagram &quot;Aamsky&quot;) was using the name solely because it reminded people of the word &quot;genius&quot;, was the first act in a long polemic between the two literary figures. Caragiale turned Aamsky into a character on his own, envisaging his death as a result of overwork in editing magazines &quot;for the country&#x27;s political development&quot;.

Caragiale also contributed poetry to &quot;Ghimpele&quot;: two sonnets, and a series of epigrams (one of which was another attack on Macedonski). The first of these works, an 1873 sonnet dedicated to the baritone Agostino Mazzoli, is believed to have been his first contribution to the &quot;belles-lettres&quot; (as opposed to journalism).

In 1896, Macedonski reflected with irony:&quot;As early as 1872, the clients of some beer gardens in the capital have had the occasion to welcome among them of a noisy young man, a bizarre spirit who seemed destined, were he to have devoted himself to letters or the arts, to be entirely original. Indeed, this young man&#x27;s appearance, his hasty gestures, his sarcastic smile [...], his always irritated and mocking voice, as well as his sophistic reasoning easily attracted attention.&quot;

Over the following years, Caragiale collaborated on various mouthpieces of the newly created National Liberal Party, and, in May 1877, created the satirical magazine &quot;Claponul&quot;. Later in 1877, he also translated a series of French-language plays for the National Theater: Alexandre Parodi&#x27;s &quot;Rome vaincue&quot; (it was showcased in late 1877-early 1878), Paul Déroulède&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Hetman&quot;, and Eugène Scribe&#x27;s &quot;Une camaraderie&quot;. Together with the French republican Frédéric Damé, he also headed a short-lived journal, &quot;Națiunea Română&quot;.

It was also then that he contributed a serialized overview of Romanian theater, published by the newspaper &quot;România Liberă&quot;, in which Caragiale attacked the inferiority of Romanian dramaturgy and the widespread recourse to plagiarism. According to literary historian Perpessicius, the series constituted &quot;one of the most solid critical contributions to the history of our theater&quot;.

Macedonski later alleged that, in his contributions to the liberal newspapers, the young writer had libeled several Conservative Party politicians—when researching this period, Șerban Cioculescu concluded that the accusation was false, and that only one polemical article on a political topic could be traced back to Caragiale.

===&quot;Timpul&quot; and &quot;Claponul&quot;===

The young journalist began drifting away from National Liberal politics soon after 1876, when the group came to power with Ion Brătianu as Premier. According to many versions, Eminescu, who was working on the editorial staff of the main Conservative newspaper, &quot;Timpul&quot;, asked to be joined by Caragiale and the Transylvanian prose writer Ioan Slavici, who were both employed by the paper. This order of events remains unclear, and depends on sources saying that Eminescu was employed by the paper in March 1876. Other testimonies indicate that it was actually Eminescu who arrived last, beginning work in January 1878.

Slavici later recalled that three of them engaged in lengthy discussions at &quot;Timpul&quot;&#x27;s headquarters on Calea Victoriei and in Eminescu&#x27;s house on Sfinților Street, where they planned to co-author a massive work on Romanian grammar. According to literary historian Tudor Vianu, the relationship between Caragiale and Eminescu partly replicated that between the latter and the Moldavian Ion Creangă.

Over that period, &quot;Timpul&quot; and Eminescu were engaged in a harsh polemic with the Reds, and especially their leader Rosetti. It was also then that Romania entered the Russo-Turkish War as a means to secure her complete independence from the Ottoman Empire. Caragiale reportedly took little interest in editing &quot;Timpul&quot; over that period, but it is assumed that several unsigned chronicles, covering foreign events, are his contributions (as are two short story adaptations of works by the American author Edgar Allan Poe, both published by &quot;Timpul&quot; in spring-summer 1878). The newspaper was actually issued as a collaborative effort, which makes it hard to identify the authors of many other articles. According to Slavici, Caragiale occasionally completed unfinished contributions by Eminescu whenever the latter had to leave unexpectedly.

He concentrated instead on &quot;Claponul&quot;, which he edited and wrote single-handedly for the duration of the war. Zarifopol believed that, through the series of light satires he contributed for the magazine, Caragiale was trying out his style, and thus &quot;entertaining the suburbanites, in order to study them&quot;. A piece he authored of the time featured an imaginary barber and amateur artist, Năstase Știrbu, who drew a direct parallel between art, literature and cutting hair—both the theme and the character were to be reused in his later works. Similarly, a fragment of prose referring to two inseparable friends, Șotrocea and Motrocea, was to serve as the first draft for the Lache and Mache series in &quot;Momente și schițe&quot;. Another notable work of the time is &quot;Pohod la șosea&quot;, a rhyming reportage documenting the Russian Army&#x27;s arrival to Bucharest, and the street reactions to the event. &quot;Claponul&quot; ceased publication in early 1878.

===&quot;Junimea&quot; reception===
It was probably through Eminescu that Ion Luca Caragiale came into contact with the Iași-based &quot;Junimea&quot;, the influential literary society which was also a center for anti-National Liberal politics. Initially, Caragiale met with &quot;Junimea&quot; founder, the critic and politician Titu Maiorescu, during a visit to the house of Dr. Kremnitz, physician to the family of &quot;Domnitor&quot; Carol I. The doctor&#x27;s wife and Maiorescu&#x27;s sister-in-law, Mite Kremnitz, was herself a writer, and later became Eminescu&#x27;s lover. During several meetings, Caragiale was asked by Maiorescu to write down a series of aphorisms in an album. His concise musings are contemplative in tone, and some of them have been construed by some present-day reviewers to contain evidence of misanthropy and, to a certain degree, misogyny.

In 1878, Caragiale and Maiorescu left for Iași, where they attended &quot;Junimea&quot;″s 15th anniversary, and where Caragiale read his first draft of the celebrated play &quot;O noapte furtunoasă&quot;. The work, ridiculing the &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot;″s mix of liberal values and demagogy over a background of superficial culture, immediately struck a chord with the majority-conservative grouping. Its reception was one of the pivotal moments in the second period of &quot;Junimea&quot; activities, characterized by the society&#x27;s expansion to Bucharest and its patronage of the arts. Other writers who marked this stage were Creangă, Slavici, Vasile Alecsandri and Vasile Conta—together with Caragiale, they soon became the foremost representatives of &quot;Junimea&quot;″s direct influence on literature. To varying degrees, they all complimented the main element of &quot;Junimist&quot; discourse, Maiorescu criticism of &quot;forms without a foundation&quot;—the concept itself referred to the negative impact of modernization, which, &quot;Junimea&quot; argued, had by then only benefited the upper strata of Romanian society, leaving the rest with an incomplete and increasingly falsified culture.

Ion Luca Caragiale also associated with &quot;Junimea&quot;&#x27;s mouthpiece, &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot;, and continued to contribute there even after 1885, when the society began to decline in importance. It was here that all his major comedies were first presented to the public. He did not, however, join Petre P. Carp&#x27;s movement, which aimed to consolidate &quot;Junimea&quot; as a third force in Romanian politics, and remained a staunch independent over the following years. Caragiale was nevertheless associated with the &quot;Junimist&quot; journal &quot;Constituționalul&quot;.

In early January 1879, &quot;O noapte furtunoasă&quot; was first staged by the National Theater. Its production brought the first association between Caragiale and comedian Mihai Mateescu, who went on to portray some of his most popular characters. The play was a hit, and acclaim reached Caragiale despite the fact that he had refused to have his name printed on the posters. Caragiale was soon outraged to discover that, by the second staging, his text had been toned down by the government-appointed Head of Theaters, the National Liberal Ion Ghica. When he asked for an official explanation, &quot;O noapte furtunoasă&quot; was removed from the season&#x27;s program. Over the following years, independent troupes staged the play or its plagiarized versions for their own benefit. It was restored to the National Theater&#x27;s repertoire in 1883, and was so successful that state theaters in cities such as Craiova and Iași made efforts to have it included in their own programs.

Caragiale subsequently took part in directing his plays at the National Theater, where his main collaborator was actor and manager Constantin I. Nottara. Together, they are credited with having put a stop to the techniques favored by Mihail Pascaly, replacing emphatic declamation with a more natural and studied perspective on acting.

===Inspector general===
In 1880, he printed &quot;Conu Leonida față cu reacțiunea&quot; — a play centered on an uncultured &quot;Red&quot; pensioner and his naive wife, who overhear a street brawl and believe that a revolution is imminent. It was also then that his first memoirs from the world of theater were published, which coincided with the release of Ion Creangă&#x27;s own book of memoirs, the well-known volume &quot;Amintiri din copilărie&quot;.

Accompanied by Maiorescu, Caragiale left for Austria-Hungary. In Vienna, the two of them attended a staging of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, hosted by the Burgtheater. He was practically unemployed after returning, and, in 1881, gave up his position at &quot;Timpul&quot;. Nevertheless, that autumn, V. A. Urechia, Minister of Education in the Ion Brătianu National Liberal cabinet, assigned him the office of inspector general for the Moldavian counties of Suceava and Neamț. Profiting from the proximity between his new residence and Iași, Ion Luca Caragiale became a regular participant in &quot;Junimea&quot;&#x27;s activities, becoming good friends with some of its most important representatives (Iacob Negruzzi, Vasile Pogor, and Petru Th. Missir). With Negruzzi, he dramatized &quot;Hatmanul Baltag&quot;, a short story by Nicolae Gane.

He became close to Veronica Micle, a woman writer who was also Eminescu&#x27;s mistress. For a while, Caragiale and Micle had a love affair, although she continued to see the poet. This caused the friendship between Eminescu and Caragiale to sour. The former was jealous of Cargiale&#x27;s relations with Micle, while she resented the poet&#x27;s affair with Mite Kremnitz.

Just one year after, Caragiale was moved back to Wallachia, becoming inspector general in Argeș and Vâlcea. He was ultimately stripped of this position in 1884, and found himself on the verge of bankruptcy; he thus accepted the lowly position of clerk for the civil registry administration. It is probably during this period that his melodrama &quot;O soacră&quot; was written and published — Caragiale, who was aware of its faults, indicated that it was a work from his youth, and dated it to 1876. His account is challenged by several details in the text.

In June 1883, while visiting Maiorescu&#x27;s house, he received news that Eminescu had suffered the first in a series of dementia attacks (owing to a disease that was to kill him in 1889). Caragiale reportedly broke into tears. This succession of events also saw him becoming involved in conflicts among &quot;Junimea&quot; members: like Pogor, Caragiale objected to the style of Vasile Alecsandri, an aged &quot;Junimist&quot; poet, and was shocked to find out that he was ridiculing the much younger Eminescu. He thus decided to criticize Alecsandri in public, during a March 1884 meeting of the society—Maiorescu recorded in his private notes that &quot;[...] Caragiale [was] aggressive and rude toward Alecsandri.&quot;

Caragiale&#x27;s wealthy relative, Catinca Momulo Cardini (commonly known Catinca Momuloaia), who was the widow of a famous restaurateur and the cousin of his mother Ecaterina, died in 1885, and the writer had the prospect of inheriting a large fortune. He nonetheless became involved in a trial with Momuloaia&#x27;s other relatives, which prolonged itself until the early 20th century.

===First major successes===
Months after this, his new comedy, &quot;O scrisoare pierdută&quot;, was first shown to the public. A fresco of conflicting political machines, provincial corruption, petty ambitions, and incoherent demagogy, it was an instant hit with the public. Arguably the high point of Caragiale&#x27;s career, it became one of the best-known works of its kind in Romanian literature. Maiorescu was pleased by its success, and believed that it was a sign of maturity in Romanian society, which, as he put it, was &quot;starting to laugh&quot; at the National Liberal rhetoric.

Ion Luca Caragiale was romantically involved with an unmarried young woman, Maria Constantinescu, who worked for the Bucharest Town Hall
— in 1885, she gave birth to Mateiu, whom Caragiale recognized as his son.

During the same year, Caragiale&#x27;s &quot;D-ale carnavalului&quot;, a lighter satire of suburban morals and amorous misadventures, was received with booing and heckling by members of the public — critics deemed it &quot;immoral&quot;, due to its frank depiction of adultery gone unpunished. The controversy saw Maiorescu taking his friend&#x27;s side and publishing an essay highly critical of National Liberal cultural tenets (titled &quot;Comediile domnului Caragiale&quot;, it was to be reprinted in 1889, as a preface to Caragiale&#x27;s collected plays). In it, the critic, who was influenced by the ideas of Arthur Schopenhauer, argued that Caragiale had not failed in uplifting the human spirit, precisely because he had risen above both didacticism and egotism (&quot;see Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s aesthetics&quot;). In reference to accusations that the play was unpatriotic, Maiorescu answered:
&quot;[...] the present-day poems with a political intent, the odes on solemn days, the theatrical compositions for dynastic glorifications are a simulacrum of art, and not the real art. Even patriotism, the most important sense for the citizen of a state in his actions as a citizen, has no place in art as an ad-hoc form of patriotism [...]. Is there a single lyric of French patriotism in Corneille? Is there any national spouting in Racine? Is there one in Molière? Is there one in Shakespeare? Is there one in Goethe?&quot;

The article played an essential part in reconciling the dramatist to the general public, but also led to a polemic between Maiorescu and the philosopher Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea (a Marxist who claimed that Maiorescu was contradicting himself). Dobrogeanu-Gherea argued in favor of Caragiale&#x27;s work, but considered &quot;D-ale carnavalului&quot; to be his weakest play.

===Theater leadership and marriage===
Despite his earlier conflicts with the National Liberals, Caragiale, who still faced problems in making a living, agreed to contribute pieces for the party press, and thus briefly associated with &quot;Voința Națională&quot; (a journal issued by historian and politician Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol). Under the pen name &quot;Luca&quot;, he contributed two theater chronicles. In parallel, he taught classes at the privately run Sfântul Gheorghe High School in Bucharest. This episode of his career ended in 1888, when Maiorescu ascended to the office of Minister of Education in the Teodor Rosetti cabinet (formed by a group of &quot;Junimist&quot; Conservatives). Caragiale requested to be appointed Head of Theaters, which also implied leadership of the National Theater. Although Maiorescu was initially opposed, Caragiale eventually received the post. The ultimate decision was attributed to Romania&#x27;s Queen Elisabeth having asked Maiorescu to reconsider, or, alternatively, to the support offered by the influential &quot;Junimist&quot; Petre P. Carp.
The appointment caused some controversy at the time: Ion Luca Caragiale, unlike all his predecessors (the incumbent C.I. Stăncescu included), was both a professional in the field and a person of modest origins. As the National Liberals intensified their campaign against him, the dramatist drafted an open letter for the Bucharest press, outlining his intentions and explaining the circumstances of his appointment. In it, he attributed his own rise to the interest &quot;Junimea&quot; had taken in his work, while defending the literary society, which was, as he put it, &quot;lost from the public eye at a time of political obscurity&quot;. Reviewing his own merits as a writer and manager, he elaborated and later put into practice a program for state-run theaters — according to Vianu, it signified &quot;punctuality and rigor&quot;. He nonetheless resigned at the end of the season, and resumed his literary activities.

In January 1889, he married Alexandrina, the daughter of architect Gaetano Burelly. She was a member of the Bucharest elite, which served to improve Ion Luca Caragiale&#x27;s social standing. They had two children of their own: Luca (known as Luky; born 1893) and Ecaterina (or Tușchi; born 1894; later married name: Logadi). Several years later, the Caragiales brought Mateiu into their home, and Ion Luca enrolled him at Anghel Demetrescu&#x27;s Sfântul Gheorghe College.

===Clash with the Academy===
Early in 1890, at the same time as his volume of collected works, Caragiale published and staged his rural-themed tragedy &quot;Năpasta&quot; — both writings were presented for consideration to the Romanian Academy, in view of receiving its annual prize, the Ion Heliade Rădulescu Award. Caragiale&#x27;s conflict with the National Liberals reached its peak, as two of their representatives inside the forum, historian Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu and future Premier Dimitrie Sturdza, reported unfavorably. Additional criticism was voiced by the poet Gheorghe Sion, who also defended the a work by Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea (itself up for review). When the &quot;Junimist&quot; Iacob Negruzzi defended his friend, Sturdza contrasted Caragiale&#x27;s works with his own version of didacticism, claiming that it altogether lacked a moral and national quality.

Both Hasdeu and Sturdza hinted at the influence exercised over Caragiale by their adversary Maiorescu, and went on to compare the dramatist with foreign writers such as Mite Kremnitz and Joseph Brociner; the latter was Jewish. For the two liberal leaders, Kremnitz and Brociner, who had authored works critical of the Romanian establishment, were aiding to construct a negative image of the Romanian nation. Hasdeu insisted that Caragiale was himself creating problems for the country, while Sturza, showing himself more lenient in this respect, insisted that Caragiale&#x27;s plays had failed to display a love for &quot;the truth, the beautiful and the good&quot;. He stressed:&quot;Mr. Caragiale should learn how to respect his nation, and not mock it.&quot;

Sturdza&#x27;s discourse contributed to the academy&#x27;s negative vote (20 votes against and 3 in favor), and rose Caragiale&#x27;s anger. In parallel, Dobrogeanu-Gherea&#x27;s candidature for the prize was rejected with 16 votes against and 8 for. In 1897, writing for the Conservative paper &quot;Epoca&quot;, the writer lashed out at Sturdza and his partisans, claiming that they viewed all humorous talents as &quot;unholy&quot;, &quot;useless to the nation&quot;, and &quot;downright perilous&quot;. Vianu noted that Caragiale&#x27;s article directly aimed at Sturdza&#x27;s reverence for Jacobinism, collectivism, and nationalism, which, in Caragiale&#x27;s own words,
&quot;manipulated the baggage of big words with which the phony liberal school has been filling empty heads for fifty years on end&quot;.

===Split with &quot;Junimea&quot;===

During the controversy, Caragiale published two memoirs of Eminescu—the poet had died in June 1889. One of them was titled &quot;În Nirvana&quot; (&quot;Into Nirvana&quot;), and notably expanded on the early years of their friendship and on one of Eminescu&#x27;s earliest amorous disappointments. In an essay of the following year, he showed himself critical of a wave of Eminescu imitators, commenting: &quot;A lot of reasonable people will walk the path and [...] of the people that know them only a few will raise their hats; whereas an insane person [...] will be followed by all the people. That is why the success of the [1890 Eminescu edition] has overcome all the editors&#x27; expectations&quot;. He also reprinted his recollections from the world of theater, alongside pieces originally published in &quot;Claponul&quot; and various new satirical pieces.

Although this attack owed much to &quot;Junimea&quot;&#x27;s discourse, Caragiale had by then turned against Maiorescu, probably due to his perception that the society had failed to support his cause at the Academy. In May 1892, he used a public conference at the Romanian Athenaeum as a venue to make known his claims against the former Minister of Education and his associates, which caused a definitive rift between the two public figures. Caragiale also wrote &quot;Două note&quot; (&quot;Two Notes&quot;), an article accusing Maiorescu of having modified and censored some of Eminescu&#x27;s poems, and of having exploited the poet for financial gain. Around that time, he ceased contributing to &quot;Convorbiri Literare&quot;.

Late in 1892, Caragiale published two volumes of prose, including his new novellas &quot;Păcat&quot;, &quot;O făclie de Paște&quot; and &quot;Om cu noroc&quot;. The following year, he began frequenting socialist circles as an outsider to the cause, and soon became good friends with the Imperial Russian-born Marxist thinker Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. Financial constraints forced Caragiale to become an entrepreneur, and, in November of that year, opened a beer garden near Gabroveni Inn, in Bucharest&#x27;s Lipscani area. He probably moved on soon after, and purchased a pub on a neighboring street. In a letter he wrote at the time, the writer showed that he was planning to move to Transylvania, and considered starting a career as a teacher.

In November 1893, as a gesture of goodwill towards his adversary, Alexandru Macedonski authored an article in &quot;Literatorul&quot;, in which he asked authorities if it was normal for a former Head of Theaters not to have a stable source of income—the intended recipient did not acknowledge this offer, and the Caragiale-Macedonski conflict escalated after he continued to attack the latter in the press. One year later, Caragiale leased the restaurant catering to the train station in Buzău (just like Dobrogeanu-Gherea had done in Ploiești). His successive businesses were all struggling, and Caragiale was often on the verge of bankruptcy. Although he invested time and work in the enterprise, and even affiliated with the International Association of Waiters for a short period, he eventually decided not to renew his contract upon the years&#x27; end. His period in Buzău was noted for its other results: in February 1895, the press reported that Caragiale had given a public lecture on &quot;the causes of human stupidity&quot;.

===&quot;Moftul Român&quot; and &quot;Vatra&quot;===

Together with the socialist activist Tony Bacalbașa and the illustrator Constantin Jiquidi, he established the satirical magazine &quot;Moftul Român&quot;, which ceased print after a few months, before being revived in 1901 and becoming an important venue for social criticism. The new publication&#x27;s spirit was indebted to &quot;Junimist&quot; discourse. Its title, translatable as &quot;the Romanian trifle&quot; or &quot;the Romanian nonsense&quot;, alluded to the cynicism and self-importance of the emerging modern Romanian society. According to Vianu, this was a theme first debated by &quot;Junimea&quot;&#x27;s Theodor Rosetti. &quot;Moft!&quot; thus mimicked the common answer to any important or merely exacerbated problem, and Caragiale also used it to illustrate what he saw as a common national feature. In one of his early editorials for the magazine, he claimed that &quot;moft&quot; was to Romanians what spleen (melancholy) was to the English people, nihilism to the Russians, chauvinism to the Hungarians, and &quot;vendetta&quot; to the Italians.

In parallel, Cargiale resumed his contacts with Transylvanian intellectuals: with George Coșbuc and Ioan Slavici, he founded the magazine &quot;Vatra&quot; (1 January 1894), before withdrawing from its leadership. During his short stay, he printed an unsigned sketch story, &quot;Cum se înțeleg țăranii&quot; (&quot;How Peasants Communicate&quot;), which mockingly recorded a lengthy and redundant dialog between two villagers, as well as a portrait of the deceased politician Mihail Kogălniceanu, and a fairy tale inspired by the writings of Anton Pann. He also translated a novella authored by his friend, Queen Elisabeth, under the title &quot;Răzbunare&quot; (&quot;Revenge&quot;)—he is known to have been annoyed by the longueurs of the piece, and struck out large portions of it to improve the flow.

During the same period, Caragiale had the initiative to publish short fragments he had translated from classical pieces, leaving readers to guess who their authors were—Vianu, citing the speculations made by other critics, presumed that these were writers admired by both Caragiale and his friend, schoolteacher Anghel Demetrescu (Thomas Carlyle, Alexis de Tocqueville, Thomas Babington Macaulay, François Guizot and Augustin Thierry). It was also then that he authored a piece on Prince Ferdinand, the heir apparent, who had fallen severely ill — it shows Caragiale to be a passionate defender of the Romanian monarchy, praying for Ferdinand&#x27;s health. In 1898, he wrote a lengthy essay on the state of Romanian theater, in which he notably praised the actor Ion Brezeanu, who made his name through portrayals of Caragiale&#x27;s characters, for, among others, his &quot;sober and refined interpretation&quot;. Later that year, he published a new novella, &quot;În vreme de război&quot;, a fantasy set to the background of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878.

===Radical Party===
In 1895, at the age of 43, Caragiale decided to join the Radical Party, led at the time by former &quot;Junimist&quot; George Panu; one year later, he began contributing to its mouthpiece, the newspaper &quot;Ziua&quot;. He was also briefly associated with the newspaper &quot;Sara&quot;, published in Iași. Despite this, Caragiale was again an associate of the National Liberals later the same year, when the Conservative cabinet of Lascăr Catargiu was replaced with one led by Dimitrie Sturdza. Articles he contributed to &quot;Gazeta Poporului&quot;, a National Liberal newspaper, were centered on new attacks against &quot;Junimea&quot; and were signed with the pseudonyms &quot;i&quot; and &quot;Ion&quot;. In mid-November 1895, &quot;Gazeta Poporului&quot; published an unsigned article which discussed the suicide of writer Alexandru Odobescu, investigating the mundane reasons behind it—the piece is generally attributed to Caragiale. The writer placed the blame for Odobescu&#x27;s death on his much younger lover, Hortensia Racoviță, and hailed his wife, Sașa Odobescu, as a model of devoted womanhood.

This episode of his life coincided with a period when relations between Romania and Austria-Hungary were extremely tense. Three years before, ethnic Romanian leaders in Austro-Hungarian-ruled Transylvania had signed the &quot;Transylvanian Memorandum&quot;, which inflamed passions among the Hungarians and led the authors to be indicted. Conservative Party politicians in Romania had succeeded in negotiating an amnesty, but their policies were overturned by the National Liberals, who appealed to nationalist and irredentist sentiment.

Thus, Sturdza offered a measure of support to Eugen Brote, &quot;Tribuna&quot; editor and National Romanian Party activist. Brote, who fled Transylvania and planned to directly implicate the Romanian Kingdom into the conflict, attempted to replace the pro-Conservative leadership of the National Party with a selection of politicians favored by the National Liberals. As Sturdza came to lead the cabinet, both he and Brote retracted their previous statements, but again provoked the National Party by alleging that its leaders were the actual radicals. In harsh terms, Caragiale exposed the understanding Sturdza had with Brote. Soon after, he authored a short story about a con artist who traveled to the imagined Transylvanian town of Opidul-nou, posing as the nationalist Romanian writer Alexandru Vlahuță as a means to live off the local intelligentsia. In October 1897, he was outraged by news that Sturdza had given in to Austro-Hungarian demands, and that he had expelled Transylvanian nationalists from Romania: Caragiale held a speech in which he argued that Romanians living abroad were &quot;indispensable&quot; to the Romanian state.

===&quot;Epoca&quot;===

In 1895, the writer followed the Radical group into its unusual merger with the Conservative Party. This came at a time of unified opposition, when the &quot;Junimists&quot; themselves returned to their group of origin. Caragiale came to identify with the policies endorsed by a new group of Conservative leaders, Nicolae Filipescu and Alexandru Lahovari among them. He was upset when Lahovari died not too long after, and authored his obituary.

Caragiale also became a collaborator on Filipescu&#x27;s journal &quot;Epoca&quot; and editor of its literary supplement. A chronicle he contributed at the time discussed the philosophical writings of Dobrogeanu-Gherea: while sympathetic to his conclusions, Caragiale made a clear statement that he was not interested in the socialist doctrine or any other ideology (&quot;Any idea, opinion or system is absolutely irrelevant to me, in the most absolute sense&quot;). He also published an article criticizing Dimitrie Sturdza; its title, &quot;O lichea&quot; (roughly: &quot;A Scoundrel&quot;), was reluctantly accepted by &quot;Epoca&quot;, and only after Caragiale claimed that it reflected the original meaning of the word &quot;lichea&quot; (&quot;stain&quot;), explaining that it referred to Sturdza&#x27;s unusual persistence in politics.

When answering to one of &quot;Epoca&quot;&#x27;s inquiries, he showed that he had yet again come to reevaluate &quot;Junimea&quot;, and found it to be an essential institution in Romanian culture. Nevertheless, he was distancing himself from the purest &quot;Junimist&quot; tenets, and took a favorable view of Romantic writers whom the society had criticized or ridiculed — among these, he indicated his personal rival Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, whom he acknowledged to be among &quot;the most remarkable figures of our literature&quot;, and Alexandru Odobescu. As editor of &quot;Epoca&quot;, he published works by Hasdeu alongside those of his other contemporaries and predecessors — Grigore Alexandrescu, Nicolae Filimon, Dinicu Golescu, Ion Heliade Rădulescu, Cilibi Moise, Costache Negruzzi, and Anton Pann. He also took a more sympathetic but still distant view of Maiorescu. At the time, he befriended the young poet Cincinat Pavelescu, and helped to promote his works in the press.

===&quot;Universul&quot;===
Around that time, Caragiale began collaborating with the formerly &quot;Junimist&quot; figure Mihail Dragomirescu, who enlisted his anonymous contributions to the magazine &quot;Convorbiri Critice&quot;. Again pressed by financial problems, he returned to a bureaucratic post—this time with the administration of government monopolies, and appointed by the Conservative cabinet of Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino in June 1899. In 1901, the position was suppressed due to cutbacks in budget spending. This coincided with Sturdza&#x27;s third mandate as Premier, and further aggravated the conflict between the two figures.

At the same time, Caragiale was contributing to Luigi Cazzavillan&#x27;s newly founded daily, &quot;Universul&quot;, where he was assigned the column &quot;Notițe critice&quot; (&quot;Critical Notes&quot;). This material formed the bulk of his collected short prose volume, &quot;Momente și schițe&quot;, and notably comprised satirical pieces ridiculing the Romanian press&#x27; reaction to the activities of Boris Sarafov, a Macedonian-Bulgarian revolutionary who had attempted to set up a base in Romania.

He continued to pursue a business career, and, in 1901, inaugurated his own company, &quot;Berăria cooperativă&quot;, which took over the &quot;Gambrinus&quot; pub in front of the National Theater. It soon became the site of a literary circle, which included, among others, Tony Bacalbașa and Ion Brezeanu, the satirist Dumitru Constantinescu-Teleormăneanu (known as &quot;Teleor&quot;), and the academic I. Suchianu. At the time, the Caragiales rented a house in Bucharest, near the present-day Bulevardul Magheru.

In early 1901, as Ion Luca Caragiale entered his 25th year in literature, his friends offered him a banquet at &quot;Gambrinus&quot;, where speeches were given by Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea and the Conservative politician Take Ionescu, and where a special single-issue magazine, &quot;Caragiale&quot;, was circulated among the guests. Hasdeu put aside his differences in opinion and sent in a congratulatory letter. In it, he deemed the dramatist &quot;Romania&#x27;s Molière&quot;. Nevertheless, on 23 March 1902, the National Liberal majority in the Romanian Academy, headed by Sturdza, refused to consider &quot;Momente și schițe&quot; for the Năsturel Herăscu Award — despite a favorable report from Dimitrie C. Ollănescu-Ascanio.

===Caion scandal===

Soon after, Caragiale became involved in a major literary scandal. Constantin Al. Ionescu-Caion, a journalist and student whom Tudor Vianu described as &quot;a real pathological character&quot;, issued a claim that, in his &quot;Năpasta&quot;, the Romanian dramatist had plagiarized the work of a Hungarian author, István Kemény. Caion expanded on this in articles published by &quot;Revista Literară&quot;, where he provided direct comparisons between the two texts. This was received with enthusiasm by Caragiale&#x27;s old rival, Alexandru Macedonski, who publicized the controversy through one of his journals, &quot;Forța Morală&quot;. Initially amazed by the similarity between the two texts, Caragiale carried out his own investigations, and, in the end, discovered that neither the writing nor Kemény had ever existed. Employing Ștefănescu Delavrancea as his lawyer, he brought Caion to trial: a court sentenced Caion for calumny, but he was acquitted after an appeal in June 1902. Several commentators believe that this was owed to a strong National Liberal presence among members of the jury. During the retrial, Caion retracted all his previous claims, and instead argued that &quot;Năpasta&quot; plagiarized Leo Tolstoy&#x27;s &quot;The Power of Darkness&quot;.

Macedonski supported the lost cause until the very end, and refused to distance himself from Caion even as the latter admitted to the court that he had invented the story. His magazine also accused Caragiale of having copied Victorien Sardou&#x27;s &quot;Rabagas&quot; for his &quot;O scrisoare pierdută&quot;, as well as Henri Chivot and Alfred Duru&#x27;s &quot;Le Carnaval d&#x27;un Merle Blanc&quot; in &quot;D-ale carnavalului&quot;. In one memorable incident of 14 February 1902, while he was hosting a literary festivity at the Bucharest Athenaeum, Macedonski was heckled and responded by blowing a whistle. &quot;Forța Morală&quot; was shut down soon after this episode. In parallel, the National Theater offered Caragiale a degree of satisfaction, when it decided to showcase &quot;Rabagas&quot;, leaving the public to see that it was only remotely similar to his play.

In the wake of the scandal, Caragiale attempted to resume contacts with Maiorescu, and visited him several times. His former mentor was reticent, and finally rejected the offer for reconciliation – writing in his diary, he defined Caragiale&#x27;s attempts as &quot;apple-polishings&quot; and &quot;paradări&quot; (&quot;affectations&quot;).

===Move to Berlin===
Having gained access to the Momulo Cardini inheritance, Caragiale became a rather wealthy man. According to Șerban Cioculescu, the writer soon lost most of the funds earned, transferring them to Mateiu Caragiale and his mother, but was again made rich by the death of his sister Lenci in autumn 1905—she left him the administrator of 160,000 lei. The latter event caused tensions between Mateiu and his father—Caragiale-son believed that he had been cheated out of the inheritance, and was angered by Ion Luca&#x27;s decision to stop subsidizing him after he failed to complete his studies.

He was by then enchanted with the idea of moving into a Western or Central European country, where he hoped to lead a more comfortable life and be closer to the centers of culture. He was especially interested in gaining easier access to the major stages for classical music, as a means to satisfy his desire for quality in that field (he had by then come to adore the compositions of Ludwig van Beethoven). According to Tudor Vianu, Caragiale was also showing signs that he was about to enter a vaguely misanthropic phase of his life.

In 1903–1904, the Caragiales traveled through various European countries, while the dramatist again considered establishing his residence in Transylvania. They eventually moved to Berlin, the Imperial German capital, settling down in spring 1905. The choice was considered unusual, since the writer knew only some basic German expressions. This has led some commentators to speculate that the move was politically motivated. Mihail Dragomirescu believed that Caragiale was living at the expense of the German state. Cioculescu rejected this assessment, arguing that it relied on hearsay and pointing out that the chronological order provided by Dragomirescu was inaccurate. In 1992, historian Georgeta Ene proposed that Caragiale was acting as a spy for Romania in Germany.

The family lived in an apartment in Wilmersdorf and later at a villa in Schöneberg. Paraphrasing a Romanian proverb which speaks of &quot;the black bread of exile&quot;, the dramatist jokingly referred to his relocation as &quot;the white loaf&quot; (&quot;franzela albă a surghiunului&quot;). He did not however isolate himself completely, becoming very close to the group of Romanian students attending the University of Berlin and to other young people: among them were poet and essayist Panait Cerna, sociologist Dimitrie Gusti, musician Florica Musicescu, and Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea&#x27;s son-in-law, the literary critic Paul Zarifopol. Caragiale was also close to the linguist Gustav Weigand. He frequently traveled to Leipzig, where he would meet with Zarifopol, as well as vacationing in Travemünde. In 1906, together with Zarifopol, he visited Beethoven&#x27;s house in Bonn. He was close to the dramatist Ronetti Roman, and, in 1908, confessed that he was devastated by news of his death.

Caragiale was also visited by Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, who, as a Francophile, vehemently rejected the aesthetics of Berlin in their conversations. Delavrancea was accompanied by his daughter, Cella, a celebrated pianist.

He also traveled back into Romania for intervals—when in Iași, he associated with the maverick Conservative Alexandru Bădărău and his journal &quot;Opinia&quot;. He had closely followed Bădărău&#x27;s career up to that point, and, in July 1906, authored an epigram on his ousting from the Gheorghe Grigore Cantacuzino Conservative cabinet—comparing Bădărău to Jonah and the Conservatives to a great fish that spat him out. A poem he published during the same year ridicules King Carol I on the occasion of his fortieth year in power, while parodying the style of republican poet N. T. Orășanu; without making direct references to the monarch, it features the lyrics &quot;Ca rol fu mare, mititelul&quot; (&quot;Taking in view his role, he was grand, the little one&quot;), with &quot;ca&quot; and &quot;rol&quot; spelling out his name (and thus allowing the poem to read &quot;Carol was grand, the little one&quot;). He continued to publish various works in several other newspapers and magazines, including various Tranylvanian papers and the Iași-based &quot;Viața Românească&quot;.

His subsequent work comprised mostly correspondence with other literary figures, such as Dobrogeanu-Gherea, Mihail Dragomirescu, Alceu Urechia, and Zarifopol. He was also in touch with psychologist and philosopher Constantin Rădulescu-Motru. At the time, Caragiale planned to start work on &quot;Titircă, Sotirescu et C-ie&quot;, meaning to combine the characters of his two most successful comedies (&quot;O noapte furtunoasă&quot; and &quot;O scrisoare pierdută&quot;) into one play—this was never accomplished.

===1907===
In 1907, Caragiale was shaken by the outbreak and violent repression of the Romanian Peasants&#x27; Revolt, and decided to write a lengthy essay, in which he condemned the agrarian policies of both National Liberal and Conservative governments from a patriotic perspective. According to Vianu, the resulting &quot;1907, din primăvară până în toamnă&quot; (&quot;1907, From Spring to Autumn&quot;) was, alongside earlier essays by Eminescu and Maiorescu, the most important works of social analysis to be written by that generation.

The essay, written in harsh tones, listed what Caragiale saw as the major social problems tolerated by Romanian administrations: he discussed the landowning class, successor to the boyars, having maintained as much possible from the legacy of serfdom; he noted that, while the commerce was dominated by foreigners, the administration was gripped by a no longer aristocratic oligarchy and its far-reaching political machine. As several commentators noted, many of the topics brought up by Caragiale built on the critical overview adopted by &quot;Junimea&quot;. To the social and political problems, the text offered a monarchist solution—Caragiale expected Carol I to carry out a &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; against the Romanian political establishment, replacing the Constitution of 1866, which left some room for privilege through the census suffrage, with a more democratic one.

&quot;1907, din primăvară până în toamnă&quot;, first published in German under the pseudonym &quot;Ein rumänische Patriot&quot; (&quot;A Romanian patriot&quot;), was originally hosted by the Vienna-based newspaper &quot;Die Zeit&quot;. The translation had been completed by his friend Mite Kremnitz. In its original, the work was later printed under Caragiale&#x27;s signature by the left-wing Romanian journal &quot;Adevărul&quot;. The author had agreed to make himself known after &quot;Die Zeit&quot; reached Romania and had caused the local press to wonder who had condemned the system in such harsh words.

The brochure attracted instantaneous attention in his native country, and its success was notable: it sold around 13,000 copies. There were notable differences between the two versions, which were the result of Caragiale&#x27;s answer to criticism and suggestions from Christian Rakovsky, a prominent internationalist socialist who had been expelled from Romania early in the year. Caragiale elaborated on some of the essay&#x27;s themes in a series of fables he published soon after.

This chain of events prompted Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea to offer him a position in the Conservative Party, as a means to reform the system from within. Caragiale rejected the offer: by then, he had grown disillusioned with the traditional political groupings, and had decided to sever all his links with them. Instead, in 1908, he joined the Conservative-Democratic Party, a rising force of the entrepreneurial middle class, led by Take Ionescu. He briefly returned to Romania several times after 1908, campaigning in favor of the Ionescu and being himself proposed for a seat in the Chamber of Deputies (before the Conservative-Democrats decided another person was more suited for the position). His involvement in politics engendered a collateral conflict with his son Mateiu, after the latter expressed a wish to become part of the administration (a project ridiculed by Caragiale-father).

In December 1907, after &quot;Opinia&quot; became a mouthpiece of Ionescu&#x27;s party, Caragiale received news that its headquarters had been vandalized by A. C. Cuza and his nationalist supporters (who were students at the University of Iași). Just days after, when Cuza&#x27;s group offered to host a Caragiale festival, he refused to participate, citing his respect for the freedom of the press. It was also during the period that he published his &quot;Din carnetul unui vechi sufleur&quot;, grouping short pieces about cultural figures such as Iorgu Caragiale, Pantazi Ghica, and Matei Millo.

===Final years===
Beginning in 1909, Caragiale resumed his contributions to &quot;Universul&quot;. The same year, his fantasy piece &quot;Kir Ianulea&quot;, which explored the history of Bucharest during the early 19th century and the late stages of the Phanariote period, was published by &quot;Viața Românească&quot;. The novella partly built on &quot;Belfagor arcidiavolo&quot;, by Renaissance author Niccolò Machiavelli, and was occasionally classified as an example of historical fiction. Similar stories use themes from the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; (&quot;Abu-Hasan&quot;) and popular anecdotes (&quot;Pastramă trufanda&quot;). Another work of the time was &quot;Calul dracului&quot;, a rural-themed account of demonic temptation, which Vianu called &quot;one of the most perfect short stories to have been written in Romanian language&quot;.

His last collection of writings, titled &quot;Schițe nouă&quot; (&quot;New Sketches&quot;) saw print in 1910. During that period, after giving endorsement to a project outlined by his fellow dramatist Alexandru Davila, he aided in the creation of a new privately run Bucharest theater, and recorded its inauguration in his reportage &quot;Începem&quot; (&quot;We Begin&quot;).

By that time, Ion Luca Caragiale became remarkably close to a new generation of ethnic Romanian intellectuals in Austria-Hungary. In 1909, he recalled the union of the two Danubian Principalities under Alexander John Cuza, and predicted the union of Transylvania with Romania. He visited Budapest to meet with Transylvanian students at the local university, and was the subject of a PhD thesis authored by Horia Petra-Petrescu (which was also the first monograph on his work). He decided to support the poet and activist Octavian Goga, who, after questioning ethnic policies in Transleithania, had been jailed by Hungarian authorities—writing for &quot;Universul&quot;, Caragiale stressed that such persecutions carried the risk of escalating tensions in the region. Later, he visited Goga in Szeged, where he was serving time in jail.

Caragiale also contributed to the Arad-based journal &quot;Românul&quot;, becoming friends with other Romanian activists—Aurel Popovici, Alexandru Vaida-Voevod and Vasile Goldiș. His articles expressed support for the National Romanian Party, calling for its adversaries at &quot;Tribuna&quot; to abandon their dissident politics. In August 1911, he was present in Blaj, where the cultural association ASTRA was celebrating its 50th year. Caragiale also witnessed one of the first aviation flights, that of the Romanian Transylvanian pioneer Aurel Vlaicu. In January 1912, as he turned 60, Caragiale declined taking part in the formal celebration organized by Emil Gârleanu&#x27;s Romanian Writers&#x27; Society. Caragiale had previously rejected Constantin Rădulescu-Motru&#x27;s offer to carry out a public subscription in his favor, arguing that he could not accept such financial gains.

He died suddenly at his home in Berlin, very soon after returning from his trip. The cause of death was indicated as myocardial infarction. His son Luca recounted that, on that very night, Caragiale-father was rereading William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;, which he found to be a moving narrative.

Caragiale&#x27;s body was transported to Bucharest in a freight train, which lost its way on the tracks and arrived with a major delay. He was eventually buried in Bellu cemetery on 22 November 1912. His longtime rival Alexandru Macedonski was saddened by the news of his death, and, in a letter to &quot;Adevărul&quot;, argued that he preferred Caragiale&#x27;s humor to that of the American Mark Twain, stressing that &quot;[we] attacked each other often because we loved each other a lot.&quot;

==Style and cultural tenets==
According to Tudor Vianu, Caragiale&#x27;s writings signify &quot;the highest expression&quot; of Romanian theatre, mirroring and complimenting the contribution Mihai Eminescu had to Romanian-language poetry. Vianu nonetheless pointed out the immense difference in style and approach between the Eminescu and Caragiale, noting that, to Eminescu&#x27;s metaphysical interests and &quot;Romantic genius&quot;, the dramatist opposed his &quot;great classical and realist endowment, a social, voluble and epicurean nature&quot;.

Critics and historians place Caragiale&#x27;s style midway between the delayed Classicism of 19th century Romanian literature and Realism (with its &quot;fin de siècle&quot; development, Naturalism). The writer, who abided by the classical unities, rejected Romantic tenets, and, as early as the 1870s, opposed the lyricism present in the dramas of Victor Hugo and Friedrich Schiller. Neoclassicism in his works is further enhanced in his drama and comedies by his adherence to Eugène Scribe&#x27;s principles (&quot;see Well-made play&quot;). Paul Zarifopol argued that, for most of his life, Caragiale, the opponent of didacticism, advocated Maiorescu&#x27;s principles of art for art&#x27;s sake. He often sketched out alternative endings to his stories, and selected the ones he felt came most natural. Nevertheless, Zarifopol also noted that, late in his life, the writer contemplated adding a didactic message to one of his writings, which was to remain unfinished.

His role in the Romanian context was likened to those of Honoré de Balzac in France, Charles Dickens in the United Kingdom, and Nikolai Gogol in the Russian Empire. Literary critic Pompiliu Constantinescu credited Caragiale&#x27;s sense of irony with having corrected the tendencies of his day, and, through this, with helping create an urban literature. Caragiale&#x27;s interest in Realism was however denied by some of his &quot;Junimist&quot; advocates, who attempted to link his entire work with Maiorescu&#x27;s guidelines: on the basis of Schopenhauerian aesthetics, critic Mihail Dragomirescu postulated that his humor was pure, and did not draw on any special circumstance or context.

Through many of his traits, Caragiale was connected to a Balkan environment of virtually permanent human contact, with its humor condensed in anecdotes, mimicry, and witty comebacks. Zarifopol quoted him saying that he admired the traditional forms of entertainment, and that he admired the &quot;soitarìi&quot; (&quot;buffoons&quot;).

Largely reflecting his primordial study of dramaturgy, Caragiale&#x27;s literature is indebted to dialog, as well as, in rarer cases, to internal monologue and free indirect speech (the favorite technique of Naturalists). Language takes the central role in his work, often compensating for the lack of detail. To this was added his tendency to reduce texts to their essence—he shortened down not only his own text, but also his occasional translations of stories by Queen Elisabeth and even Miguel de Cervantes or Edgar Allan Poe. At times, he added a lyrical, meditative or autobiographical, perspective to his works: this trait was especially obvious in his later fantasy works (&quot;Kir Ianulea&quot; and &quot;Calul dracului&quot; among them), all marked by Neoromantic inspiration. Zarifopol claimed that, although Caragiale often rejected the tendency of other writers to capitalize on picturesque images, he often used them in his own writings.

Caragiale arguably won as much acclaim for his rigorous approach to playwriting as for his accomplished style. With Alexandru Vlahuță, George Coșbuc and others, he belonged to the first generation of Romanian authors to take a noted interest in imposing professionalism. He was specific about this requirement—on one occasion, he used sarcasm to overturn a common misconception, saying: &quot;Literature is an art that needs not be learned; whoever knows how to turn letters into syllables and the latter into words has had sufficient preparation to engage in literature.&quot; Commenting on this, Vianu stressed: &quot;[...] even under the appearance of ease, [Caragiale] lets us catch sight of the severe law of his art&quot; (adding elsewhere that &quot;[Caragiale] was a scrupulous and tormented artist&quot;).

Caragiale compared writers who could not dissimulate their intent and generate a good story with &quot;a cross-eyed who tells you which way to go: one doesn&#x27;t known if he is to go down the road he points to, or down the road he is looking at&quot;. Speaking in the late 1890s, he also likened writing for the stage with architecture:
&quot;In truth, just as much as the architect&#x27;s plan is not yet the final accomplishment of his intent—that is to say, the monument—but only its conventional recording [...], so too is the dramaturg&#x27;s writing not yet the accomplishment of his intent — that is to say, the comedy — but the conventional recording, to which will be added the personal elements, in order to depict a development of human circumstances and deeds. In short: just as an architect&#x27;s plan bears little resemblance to a painting, so does drama bear little resemblance to a poem.&quot;

==Political and social vision==

===Liberalism and republicanism===

His interest in first-hand investigation of the human nature was accompanied, at least after he reached maturity, by a distaste for generous and universalist theories. Caragiale viewed their impact on Romanian society with a critical eye. Like &quot;Junimea&quot;, he was amused by the cultural legacy of 1848 Wallachian revolutionaries, and by its image in National Liberal discourse. Nevertheless, he claimed that there was a clear difference between the first generation of liberal activists—Ion Câmpineanu, Ion Heliade Rădulescu, and Nicolae Bălcescu—and the new liberal establishment, which, as he believed, had come to cultivate hypocrisy, demagogy, and political corruption. He exemplified the latter group by citing some of its prominent members: Pantazi Ghica and Nicolae Misail. At one point, he argued that, had they not died young, the leaders of 1848 could have found themselves best represented by the Conservatives. He recorded the way in which National Liberal politicians claimed to take inspiration from the revolt, and pointed out that the 1848 slogans had become rallying calls for the most banal causes.

His almost lifelong critique of the liberal current, marked by his conflicts with Dimitrie Sturdza and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu, was partly inspired by the &quot;Junimea&quot; guidelines — in line with the &quot;Junimists&quot;, Caragiale perceived liberals as agents of Populism, popular Romanticism, and Idealism, as tenets prevalent in the literature of his day. For Caragiale, the resulting liberal-inspired literary works were &quot;spanac&quot; (&quot;spinach&quot;). The writer thus identified late 19th-century Romanian liberalism &quot;empty talk&quot;, and his attacks on demagogy partly mirrored Maiorescu&#x27;s views about the National Liberals&#x27; &quot;inebriation with words&quot;.

Caragiale centered some of his first attacks on the &quot;Reds&quot; and their leader C. A. Rosetti, in whose republicanism and inflammatory rhetoric he saw the main threat to Romanian society. The writer believed that, ever since having ousted Alexander John Cuza from his throne, both Rosetti and Ion Brătianu were using their republican basis as an asset, inciting to rebellion only when their demands were not met. He frequently ridiculed the cult with which Rosetti surrounded figures of international republicanism, such as Giuseppe Garibaldi and Léon Gambetta, and indicated that the National Liberal public had very vague and impractical notions of what a republican state actually implied.

The republican agitation is no longer emphasized in Caragiale&#x27;s later works, as republicanism slowly faded out of the mainstream liberal discourse. Noting this, several critics believe that, in his &quot;O scrisoare pierdută&quot;, which depicts the battle between two unnamed political camps, the dramatist alluded to the conflict between Brătianu&#x27;s moderates and Rosetti&#x27;s extremists (as indicated by the fact that all the main characters attend the same rallies). This view was disputed by Zarifopol, who argued that the more pragmatic grouping stands for the Conservatives, and the demagogic one for the National Liberals as a whole.

===Nationalism===
Ion Luca Caragiale was a vocal critic of antisemitism, which was mostly represented by the National Liberals and A. C. Cuza&#x27;s emerging movement. At a time when the Jewish community was denied emancipation, he advocated its full integration into Romanian society, calling for civil rights to be extended to all residents of Romania. Around 1907, he tried his hand at writing a legislative proposal, according to which the Romanian state was to extend citizenship all resident stateless persons who did not enjoy foreign protection—in its manuscript form, this document was kept by his friend Dimitrie Gusti. According to Garabet Ibrăileanu, his rejection of antisemitic views was owed either to his failure to relate with the middle class and its anti-Jewish stances, or to his &quot;powerful intelligence&quot;, which contrasted with the &quot;instinctual, almost zoological nature&quot; of the antisemitic discourse.

His criticism of both the nationalist discourse and liberal-inspired education generated subjects for several of his shorter satirical writings. Caragiale thus authored a mock-pamphlet advertising the program of a new cultural society, &quot;Românii Verzi&quot; (the &quot;Green Romanians&quot;), who took its racialist proposals to the point of arguing that &quot;[...] a nation must always fear other nations&quot;. Like &quot;Junimea&quot;, he was entirely opposed to the group of August Treboniu Laurian and other Transylvanian intellectuals, who attempted to reform the Romanian language by introducing new forms of speech and writing that aimed to return it closer to its Latin roots. In his stories, Caragiale created the teacher Marius Chicoș Rostogan, a caricature of both the liberal educators and the Transylvanian &quot;Latinists&quot;. While in Berlin, the writer also persiflaged some of Vasile Alecsandri&#x27;s liberal and patriotic writings—he completed Alecsandri&#x27;s nationalist poem &quot;Tricolorul&quot; with sarcastic verses that were meant to enhance its xenophobic feel (showing the Romanians ready to do battle against all their perceived enemies in Eastern Europe).

Nevertheless, various authors believe that a young Caragiale did indeed support nationalist liberal policies, and presume that he was behind a series of anti-Jewish columns, published by &quot;Voința Națională&quot; during the early 1880s. This was for long disputed: rabbi and literary historian Moses Gaster attributed the pieces to Nicolae Xenopol, while researcher Șerban Cioculescu, who originally doubted them, eventually agreed that they formed an integral part of Caragiale&#x27;s work.

===Conservatism and traditionalism===

In some of his early articles, and again as he distanced himself from &quot;Junimea&quot;, the writer showed himself to be a vocal critic of the Conservative doctrine and its &quot;Junimist&quot; representatives. This is especially evident in his 1907 essay and in some of his stories. Caragiale claimed that both Titu Maiorescu and Petre P. Carp were &quot;boyars&quot; who prioritized the interest of their social class (which was by then nonetheless defunct, as traditional privilege had been formally abolished a generation earlier). Cioculescu attributed this to an &quot;inferiority complex&quot; Caragiale felt in respect to his former patrons.

Despite his brief association with the mainstream Conservatives, Caragiale was probably never their partisan, and only hoped that the party could open the way for the reforms advertised by George Panu and Alexandru Lahovari. When disappointed with their failure to promote change, he moved on to support Take Ionescu and his dissident grouping. Uniquely among students of Caragiale&#x27;s work, George Călinescu argued that the writer&#x27;s main interest was not in criticizing the liberals, but actually in an overall rejection of the most embedded &quot;Junimist&quot; tenets, which, in Călinescu&#x27;s view, had engendered &quot;a lack of faith in the country&#x27;s own powers&quot;. Paul Zarifopol believed that several of his &quot;Momente și schițe&quot; characters, including the effeminate high life chronicler Edgar Bostandaki, are caricatures of the Conservatives.

Caragiale contrasted the other major writers of his generation, including his friends Mihai Eminescu, Ioan Slavici, Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, and &quot;Sămănătorul&quot; journal founder Alexandru Vlahuță, all of whom were advocating a return to the rural sphere and peasant traditionalism. In &quot;Moftul Român&quot;, he parodied the archaisms favored by Ștefănescu Delavrancea; during his final years, he also questioned the aesthetic value of Ștefănescu Delavrancea&#x27;s medieval-themed play &quot;Apus de soare&quot;. Prominent nationalists and traditionalists tended to be reserved in their assessment of Caragiale&#x27;s literary contributions—they include his friend Eminescu and historian Nicolae Iorga.

Nonetheless, Ion Luca Caragiale was, according to Zarifopol, a passionate advocate of tradition in front of innovation, and &quot;a defender of the well-established truths&quot;. Tudor Vianu also evidenced that Caragiale treasured his Orthodox identity, frequently appealing to God and the saints in both his private life and his writings. According to Ioan Slavici, Caragiale defined himself as &quot;a right-believing Christian&quot;, and disagreed with Eminescu on the nature of religion (at a time when the poet was a passionate student of Buddhism). Cioculescu called this trait &quot;primitive religiosity&quot;. The writer is also known to have convinced that luck and destiny manifested themselves in life, and his &quot;Cănuță om sucit&quot;, a short story about a proverbially unlucky fellow, is thought to have referred to its author. His superstitions were accompanied by a series of phobias, particularly pyrophobia and nosophobia.

===Caragiale and the modernists===
Ion Luca Caragiale was mostly critical of literary experiments and the newer stages of Modernism. On this basis, he persistently ridiculed Alexandru Macedonski&#x27;s style, especially after the latter adopted Symbolism. Much of his own poetry, especially pieces published in &quot;Moftul Român&quot; after 1901, parodied the Romanian Symbolist clubs and the Parnassianism of Macedonski&#x27;s &quot;Literatorul&quot; (among the best-known of these targets was poet Cincinat Pavelescu, who was coeditor at &quot;Literatorul&quot;).

As editor of &quot;Epoca&quot;&#x27;s literary supplement, Caragiale refused to publish a descriptive poem by the young Gala Galaction, claiming that it was not poetry (when Nicolae Filipescu asked him to reconsider, he threatened to quit). Late in his life, he reserved explicit criticism for the new generation of Symbolists, whose work, he argued, belonged to &quot;the church&quot; of Belgian poet Maurice Maeterlinck. Zarifopol also noted that, for as long as he lived, the writer derided the innovative works of Henrik Ibsen and August Strindberg, but pointed out that Caragiale had never actually read or seen their plays.

Nevertheless, Caragiale was not entirely opposed to newer trends in poetry and art. Literary critic Matei Călinescu believes that he genuinely admired &quot;În orașul cu trei sute de biserici&quot; (&quot;In the City with Three Hundred Churches&quot;), a free verse poem by the Symbolist Ion Minulescu. This work is believed to have inspired a 1908 parody by Caragiale, in which the writer proclaimed his support for Take Ionescu. According to poet and essayist Tudor Arghezi, Caragiale also admired the works of Ștefan Luchian, a Postimpressionist whose paintings were often exhibited in Bucharest galleries.

===Caragiale and the Left===
Moving toward the Left during the final decades of his life, the writer maintained connection with the socialists, but was nonetheless ambivalent to their goals. As Cioculescu noted, he welcomed the Bucharest celebration of May Day in one of his &quot;Moftul Român&quot; pieces, and probably agreed to lecture for the Workers&#x27; Club in the capital. Some of his writings were hosted by the socialist journal &quot;România Muncitoare&quot;. According to Garabet Ibrăileanu, himself a socialist at the time, &quot;sometime after 1890, Caragiale briefly flirted with socialism.&quot;

However, over the same period, Caragiale ridiculed several socialist militants, referring to one of their leaders with the derisive nickname &quot;Edgard Spanachidi&quot; (itself a derivative of &quot;spinach&quot;). Instead, his loose association with George Panu signified a return to radicalism, and saw him campaigning in favor of universal suffrage and a complete land reform—this clashed with the views he had expressed earlier in life, and Caragiale was careful not to let it seem that he had returned to the &quot;Red&quot; liberalism of his youth.

In one of his articles, Ion Luca Caragiale commented with irony on the Marxist views of his friend Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea: he compared the latter&#x27;s way of dining on a leg of veal, laboriously carving it into sections, to his philosophical approach. Caragiale thus noted that philosophical skepticism was equivalent to stripping the bone of its flesh piece by piece, and then throwing it to the dogs—without having been able to fully document the leg of veal or its substance. Nevertheless, as Tudor Vianu indicated, although Caragiale preferred observation and spontaneity to speculation, he was not averse to pure philosophical analysis, and frequently quoted the classics in defense of his aesthetic guidelines. Late in his life, Caragiale also sparked debates after deriding the emerging Poporanism, a school of thought which took its inspiration from socialism, agrarianism and traditionalism. He is also known to have been amused by the German election of 1907 and the resulting defeat registered by the Social Democratic Party.

Caragiale maintained a friendship with Dobrogeanu-Gherea for much of his life. He was especially interested in news of Dobrogeanu-Gherea having become involved in the 1905 Russian battleship Potemkin scandal, after the aging socialist decided to offer his help to the refugee sailors as they arrived in Constanța. During his time in Berlin, he repeatedly tried to convince the Dobrogeanu-Ghereas to leave their home in Romania and join him abroad. Nonetheless, he criticized the philosopher when the latter refused to be decorated by King Carol I (1909). Around 1907, the dramatist was also interested in the activities of Christian Rakovsky, who was trying to make his way back into Romania, and closely followed news of street clashes between his supporters and the authorities.

==Settings==

The writer had an unprecedented familiarity with the social environments, traits, opinions, manners of speech, means of expression and lifestyle choices of his day — from the rural atmosphere of his early childhood, going through his vast experience as a journalist, to the high spheres of politics (National Liberal as well as Conservative, &quot;Junimist&quot; as well as socialist). An incessant traveler, Caragiale carefully investigated everyday life in most areas of the Romanian Old Kingdom and Transylvania. He was an unusually sociable man: in one of his letters from Berlin, he asked Alceu Urechia to send his regards to over 40 of his acquaintances in Sinaia (from Austro-Hungarian diplomats to street vendors or beggars).

Several of his major works have a rural setting—they include &quot;Năpasta&quot;, &quot;În vreme de război&quot;, &quot;La hanul lui Mânjoală&quot;, &quot;Calul dracului&quot;, &quot;Păcat&quot;, and &quot;O făclie de Paște&quot;, as well as fragments of the pseudo-fairy tales he authored late in life. Nevertheless, Caragiale is foremost known and acclaimed for his urban themes, which form the background to the vast majority of his most accomplished writings.

The author depicted the city in all stages of its development and in all its atmospheres — from nightlife to &quot;Căldură mare&quot;&#x27;s midday torpor, from noisy slums and the &quot;Târgul Moșilor&quot; fête in Obor to the English-inspired tea parties of the urban elite. This large fresco drew comparisons with his generation colleague Ion Creangă, who was argued to have done the same for the countryside. Caragiale was especially proud of the opening paragraph in his &quot;Ultima emisiune...&quot; story, part of &quot;Momente și schițe&quot;, which, he believed, the &quot;corner of a slum&quot; was suggested to perfection.

Tudor Vianu also noted that, among cities and towns, Caragiale preferred Bucharest and those provincial centers most exposed to Central European influences (specifically, the summer retreats in the Prahova Valley and other Wallachian stations on the way to Transylvania). The enclosed world of the Romanian Railways also appealed to the writer, and an impressive number of his sketches relate to it in various ways.

==Collective characters==

Confessing at some point that &quot;the world was my school&quot;, Caragiale dissimulated his background and critical eye as a means to blend into each environment he encountered, and even adopted the manners and speech patterns he later recorded in his literary work. He thus encouraged familiarity, allowing people to reveal their histories, motivations, and culture. Vianu recounted: &quot;The man was a consummate actor and a &quot;pince-sans-rire&quot;, an ironist [...] to the point where his partners of dialog were never sure if they were spoken to &#x27;seriously&#x27; [...].&quot; In one of his pieces from 1899, he welcomed the famous actors Eleonora Duse and Jean Mounet-Sully to Bucharest, imitating the exaggerated style of other theater chroniclers—the article ended with Caragiale confessing that he had not actually seen the two perform. In one other instance, as a means to comment on plagiarism, the author also parodied his own &quot;O făclie de Paște&quot;—which he turned into the sketch, &quot;Noaptea Învierii&quot;.

In &quot;1907, din primăvară până în toamnă&quot;, his late and disillusioned work, Caragiale lashed out at the traditional class of political clients, with an indictment which, Tudor Vianu believed, also served to identify the main focus of his other writings:
&quot;plebs incapable of work and lacking employment, impoverished suburban small traders and street vendors, petty dangerous agitators of the villages and of the areas adjacent to towns, bullying election agents; and then the hybrid product of all levels of schooling, semi-cultured intellectuals, lawyers and lawyerlings, professors, teachers and teacherlings, semi-illiterate and unfrocked priests, illiterate schoolteachers—all of them beer garden theorists; next come the great functionaries and the little clerks, most of them removable from office.&quot;

Direct criticism was nonetheless rare in Caragiale&#x27;s fiction: Vianu believed to have found traces of it in &quot;O scrisoare pierdută&quot; (&quot;the most cruel [of his satires]&quot;) and in &quot;Grand Hotel &quot;Victoria română&quot;&quot; (&quot;the most bitter&quot;). On several occasions, Caragiale showed or even defined himself as a sentimental, and his modesty was acknowledged by several of his friends. Vianu noted that, alongside his Christian ethos, this contributed to his distant, calm and often sympathetic overall take on society. In his words:
&quot;A wave of charm, of reconciliation with life passes above all [his characters], one which, if it only assumes light and superficial shapes, experienced by naive people with harmless manias, is a sign that the collective existence is taking place in shelter from the great trials.&quot;

In contrast with this, Poporanist critic Garabet Ibrăileanu argued that Caragiale actually hated the people who inspired his works, and claimed that the writer had made this clear during one of their conversations. His account was considered doubtful by researcher Ștefan Cazimir, who believed that Ibrăileanu was using it to back a polemic and singular overview of Caragiale&#x27;s work.

According to Vianu, there is a manifest difference between Ion Luca Caragiale&#x27;s comedies and his &quot;Momente și schițe&quot;: the former are, in his view, driven by situations and circumstances, whereas the latter sees Caragiale developing his original perspective to its fullest. This, he argues, was determined by important social changes—a move from a traditional world—awkwardly attempting to digest Westernization, modernization, and Francized culture—, to a more stable and prosperous environment. A similar division was applied by Ibrăileanu.

==Types==

===Theoretical aspects===
The form of Realism favored by Caragiale placed types of characters at the center of literary creativity, owing to the influence of Classicism. Several critics have credited &quot;Momente și schițe&quot;, as well as all his dramas, with providing some of the first truly believable portrayals in local literature. Vianu stressed that Classicist borrowings in Caragiale&#x27;s writings were limited, indicating that Caragiale parted with the notion of &quot;generic types&quot; to look for the &quot;social&quot; ones. In parallel, literary critic George Călinescu argued that &quot;[t]he typological structure is present in Caragiale&#x27;s work as a supporting structure, without being essential.&quot;

In Vianu&#x27;s assessment, the universal human nature was important to Caragiale, but not made instantly obvious (as opposed to the immediate importance his characters were meant to have in the eyes of his public). Vianu illustrated this concept after investigating the manner in which Caragiale completed his &quot;O scrisoare pierdută&quot;: the author was for long undecided about which character was to win the electoral battle on which the play centers, but opted for Agamiță Dandanache, the senile radical, because his victory was to give the play more depth. Caragiale was thus quoted saying that Dandanache was &quot;more stupid&quot; than the clueless politician Tache Farfuridi, and &quot;more of a scoundrel&quot; than the unprincipled and cunning journalist Nae Cațavencu.

In Vianu&#x27;s view, &quot;Momente și schițe&quot; was more vague in this respect, giving little insight into morals and states of mind, whereas the other, longer, novellas did depict feelings and occasionally provided additional details such as physiology or cenesthesia. Also according to Vianu, Ion Luca Caragiale, unlike the Naturalists, was generally not interested in offering the reader access to his characters&#x27; psychological background—aside from his &quot;Năpasta&quot; and &quot;Păcat&quot;, and &quot;O făclie de Paște&quot;, he only adopted the psychological technique in satirical contexts, as a means to parody its use. A similar view was expressed by Vianu&#x27;s predecessor, Silvian Iosifescu, who also stressed that Caragiale always avoided applying the Naturalist technique to its fullest, while George Călinescu himself believed that the characters&#x27; motivations in &quot;O făclie de Paște&quot; are actually physiological and ethnological.

Maiorescu was especially fond of the way in which Caragiale balanced his personal perspective and the generic traits he emphasized: speaking of Leiba Zibal, the Jewish character in &quot;O făclie de Paște&quot; who defends himself out of fear, he drew a comparison with Shakespeare&#x27;s Shylock. He thus noted that, for all the differences in style between the two authors, both their characters stood for the Jewish people as a whole. This assessment was backed by Maiorescu&#x27;s adversary, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. George Călinescu also believed that, aside from his individual nature, Zibal provided readers with an accurate insight into Jewish reactions to systemic persecution and death threats. Such assessments were rejected by Paul Zarifopol, who opposed generalizations and commented that the work only referred to &quot;[t]he ingenious cruelty of a man maddened by fear&quot;.

===Allegories===
One of Caragiale&#x27;s main and earliest types is that of the young man gripped by love, expressing himself through emphatic and Romantic clichés—its main representative is &quot;O noapte furtunoasă&quot;&#x27;s Rică Venturiano. As Vianu commented, Caragiale exploited the theme to so much success that it took another generation for youthful love to be presented in a non-comedic context (with the common signature writings of Ștefan Octavian Iosif and Dimitrie Anghel). At the other end are patriarchal figures, heads of families who seem unable or unwilling to investigate their wives&#x27; adulterous relations with younger men. This behavior is notably present in &quot;O noapte furtunoasă&quot;, where the aged Dumitrache fails to note even the most obvious signs that his wife Veta is in love with his good friend Chiriac. A more complex situation is present in &quot;O scrisoare pierdută&quot;, where political boss Trahanache cannot tell that his wife Joițica is having an affair with Tipătescu, and, when confronted with the evidence, is more interested in proving that she is not.

With Venturiano, Caragiale also introduces criticism of the liberal journalist and lawyers. A law school student, Venturiano contributes long and exaggerated articles to the republican press, which recall those authored by C. A. Rosetti and his collaborators. A more elaborate such character is Nae Cațavencu, who plays a major part in &quot;O scrisoare pierdută&quot;, and who, using a &quot;Red&quot; discourse, attacks politicians on all sides with turbulent remarks and recourse to blackmail. He profits from the more moderate attitudes of his adversaries to proclaim himself a progressive politician, and he is successful in doing so—Cațavencu rallies around him a group of teachers and other state employees. The only person who is able to stop his rise is Agamiță Dandanache, an old 1848 revolutionary. Danadanche, shown to have been sidelined from politics, makes a comeback at a time when the factions needs his inoffensive presence as a third-party, and, although senile, has a vast experience in blackmailing. Ștefan Cazimir linked Dandanache to a new aristocracy, created around the first generation of Romanian liberals, and likened him to a hidalgo. Tache Farfuridi, a competitor to both, has been described by Cazimir as a conformist self-seeker, in the manner of M. Joseph Prudhomme, a character made famous by Henri Monnier&#x27;s prose.

Written between the two other comedies, &quot;Conu Leonida față cu reacțiunea&quot; depicts the long-term effects of republican discourse on its fascinated audience, through the sayings and actions of Leonida. The latter, whose source of income is a state pension, notably supports the notion that the &quot;Red&quot; republic will provide each clerk with a salary, a pension, as well as a debt moratorium—Șerban Cioculescu noted that this request had already been voiced in real life, and issued as a political program by an obscure Utopian socialist named Pițurcă. Eventually, Leonida is convinced that revolution cannot be on the rise, since the authorities have banned the firing of weapons within city limits. Similar fallacies are uttered by one of the secondary characters in &quot;D-ale carnavalului&quot;, known to the other protagonists as &quot;Catindatul&quot;, who has a vague familiarity with both subjective idealist and materialist tenets, the sources for his absurd theories about suggestibility and &quot;magnetism&quot;—two processes in which he sees the universal source for all discomfort or disease. In parallel, Zarifopol argued, the writer had even allowed ironic reflections on the impact of various theories to seep into a more serious work, &quot;O făclie de Paște&quot;, where two students terrify the innkeeper Zibal by casually discussing anthropological criminology.

Several other of Caragiale&#x27;s characters have traditionally been considered allegories of social classes and even regional identities. One of the most famous ones is Mitică, a recurring character who stands for ordinary Bucharesters, Wallachians or Muntenians in general. A hypocritical and seemingly superficial man, Mitică expresses himself through either platitudes or clichés he believes are clever, and, illustrating a tendency Caragiale first recorded in his &quot;Moftul Român&quot;, quickly dismisses all important things he is confronted with. Similarly, the teacher Marius Chicoș Rostogan, who is present or named in several sketches, stands for those Transylvanian expatriates in Romania whose sympathies went to the liberal current. His discourse, through which Caragiale sarcastically illustrates liberal tenets in respect to Romanian education, is centered on a disregard for content and a rigor for memorizing irrelevant details. It has been proposed that Rostogan is at least partly based on Vasile Grigore Borgovan, a Transylvanian-born educator and resident of Turnu Severin.

&quot;Cetățeanul turmentat&quot;, an unnamed inebriated man who makes brief but relevant appearances in &quot;O scrisoare pierdută&quot;, is thought to symbolize simple townsfolk, utterly confused by the political battle going on around them, and ignored by all the notabilities. Like his counterpart, the police agent Ghiță Pristanda, the inebriated elector has no relevant personal ambition, and stands for the so-called &quot;government dowry&quot;—people afraid of losing their offices, and ready to back whoever is in power. According to Călinescu, the inebriated citizen worships authority as a &quot;supreme god&quot;, despite all its absurdities. He repeatedly claims to have served Trahanache during Alexander John Cuza&#x27;s ousting, but his supposed patron only acknowledges him once, when asking party members to &quot;escort this honorable person outside&quot;.

In a number of his short stories and sketches, Caragiale makes use of another particularly &quot;Junimist&quot; theme, and investigates the glamorous but superficial impact of modernization on high society. In one sketch, a couple of ladies dine in an opulent salon, while cursing their maid, gossiping, and showing interest in vulgar subjects. The characters in these writings tend to resemble each other, evidencing the generic traits of the well-to-do.

===Other traits and characters===
Anxieties take the central stage in several of Caragiale&#x27;s writings. From early on, Caragiale&#x27;s minute analysis of mounting terror in &quot;O făclie de Paște&quot; won the praise of Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea. In several of his sketches and stories, characters are driven to despair by their inability to cope with real or presumed changes in their environment. This is shown to have happened to characters such as Leiba Zibal, Stavrache—the pub owner in &quot;În vreme de război&quot;—, as well as Anghelache (the suicide victim in &quot;Inspecțiune...&quot;, part of &quot;Momente și schițe&quot;). Șerban Cioculescu referred to the latter three as &quot;great neurotics&quot;, while Iosifescu defined Zibal and Stavrache as &quot;demented&quot;. Among the group of insane characters in Caragiale&#x27;s work, Călinescu counted those of sketches and stories like &quot;1 Aprilie&quot; (&quot;1st of April&quot;), where an April Fool ends with a murder, and &quot;Două loturi&quot;, where the clerk Lefter Popescu goes through the tribulations of having lost his winning ticket.

Anxiety over imminent events grips the main characters in &quot;Conu Leonida față cu reacțiunea&quot;, and plays a part in female behavior as depicted in all his other comedies. A special kind of fear animates the main protagonists of &quot;D-ale carnavalului&quot;, whose jealousy leads them to act irrationally. Thus, Iancu Pampon, an assistant-barber and former police officer, and his female counterpart, the republican suburbanite Mița Baston, are determined to uncover their partners&#x27; amorous escapades, and their hectic inquiry combines real clues with figments of imagination, fits of passionate rage with moments of sad meditation, and violent threats with periods of resignation. Glimpses into this type of behavior have been noted in other plays by Caragiale: Cazimir placed emphasis on the fact that Farfuridi is shown to be extremely cautious towards all unplanned changes, and consumes much of his energy in preserving a largely pointless daily routine.

Many of Caragiale&#x27;s writings reproduce discussions between clerks on their time off, which usually take the shape of generic and awkward forays into culture or politics. Several of the characters in his sketches spuriously claim to be personal friends of major political figures of the day, or to have access to the back-rooms of politics and journalism. Although often alarmed by political or social developments, they tend to accommodate them quickly, and often encourage each other during very long stays at the beer garden. Gravitating in this environment are the petty journalists, who boast access to unlikely scoops, such as Bulgaria having decided to invade Romania. In one instance, Caragiale invents Caracudi, a newspaperman who writes his sensationalist articles while relaxing in the park.

Caragiale&#x27;s persona is placed in numerous of his works. Aside from deduced self-portraits in &quot;Cănuță om sucit&quot; and elsewhere, he created the famous background character Nenea Iancu (&quot;Uncle Iancu&quot;), building on his colloquial name and his status as a regular client of the beer gardens. He introduces several of his &quot;Momente și schițe&quot; characters as personal friends, and garnishes the stories with intimate details. Late in his life, he even confessed that the affair involving Venturiano, Dumitrache, and Dumitrache&#x27;s wife Veta was partly based on an amorous misadventure he experienced as a young man.

==Literary influences==

Aside from the many authors whose works he quoted, translated or parodied, Ion Luca Caragiale built on a vast literary legacy. According to literary historian Ștefan Cazimir: &quot;No writer ever had as large a number of precursors [as Caragiale], just as no other artistic synthesis was ever more organic and more spontaneous.&quot;

A man of the theater first and foremost, Caragiale was well-acquainted with the work of his predecessors, from William Shakespeare to the Romantics, and heavily impressed by the French &quot;comédie en vaudeville&quot;. He applied the notion of well-made plays, as theorized by Eugène Scribe, and was also influenced by the dramaturgy of Eugène Marin Labiche and Victorien Sardou. Reportedly, Labiche was his favorite author.

The writer himself cited Cilibi Moise, a Wallachian Jewish peddler and aphorist, as an early influence, recalling how, as a child, he used to read his one-liner jokes, and treasured them as exceptional samples of concise humor. He was similarly impressed by the works of Moise&#x27;s contemporary, the prolific author Anton Pann, whose accomplishments he praised during talks with his fellow &quot;Convorbiri Critice&quot; contributors, and whose work served as a source for at least one of his own stories. Nicolae Filimon, whom Caragiale praised on several occasions, was the author of short stories which several authors have identified as less accomplished versions of Rică Venturiano. A similar connection has been traced between the various sketches authored by Ion Heliade Rădulescu, in which Transylvanian writers are the object of ridicule, and Caragiale&#x27;s character, Marius Chicoș Rostogan. Caragiale&#x27;s late admiration for Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu was also linked to affinities in comedic styles, as was his companionship with Iacob Negruzzi (himself the author of sarcastic pieces ridiculing the liberal politicians and lawyers).

Caragiale is believed to have used and developed several themes already present in Romanian theatre. One such precursor is the author of comedies Teodor Myller, especially through his play &quot;Fata lui Chir Troancă&quot; (&quot;Kir Troancă&#x27;s Daughter&quot;). The writer was most likely very familiar with the comedies authored by his two uncles, Costache and Iorgu Caragiale, which have been shown to develop themes he later explored in depth. Among the minor 19th century dramatists whose comedic works were familiar to Caragiale, and in many ways similar to his, own was Costache Halepliu. Another often-cited influence is his predecessor and adversary Vasile Alecsandri, whose &quot;Coana Chirița&quot; plays are an early critique of Westernization. The two authors nonetheless differ in many ways, with Caragiale assuming a more complex role, and observing a more complex society.

Ion Luca Caragiale is known to have been amused by the stock character Robert Macaire, at a time when the latter had been turned into a comedic character by Frédérick Lemaître. While in Berlin, he purchased the cartoons of French artists Honoré Daumier and Paul Gavarni (although it is not known if their separate portrayals of Macaire were familiar to him) — among these drawings was one showing notabilities embracing one another while picking each other&#x27;s pockets, which shows similarities with Caragiale&#x27;s own take on society. According to Cazimir, it is possible that he knew Daumier&#x27;s work from early on, as several other subjects caricatured by the French artist bear a remarkable resemblance to his texts.

Ion Luca Caragiale was also keenly aware and receptive of his contemporaries&#x27; works and of &quot;fin de siècle&quot; innovations. The literary creations of Émile Zola were a noted source of inspiration, and the parallel led George Călinescu to propose him and Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea as the main representatives of Zola&#x27;s style in local literature. At the same time, Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea believed that both &quot;Năpasta&quot; and &quot;O făclie de Paște&quot; showed the &quot;obvious enough influence&quot; of Fyodor Dostoevsky. Late in his life, Caragiale discovered the literature of Anatole France — according to Paul Zarifopol, France&#x27;s Humanist themes served as a model for some of Caragiale&#x27;s fantasy writings.

Discussing the latter works, Vianu noted that they reminded one of Shakespeare&#x27;s late romances, while Șerban Cioculescu believed them to have been indirectly inspired by the works of Edgar Allan Poe. In his report for the academy, Dimitrie C. Ollănescu-Ascanio also drew a parallel between Poe&#x27;s works and &quot;La hanul lui Mânjoală&quot;, but this hypothesis was rejected by Zarifopol. In addition, &quot;Kir Ianulea&quot;, partly using Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s novel as a source, was held as evidence of Caragiale&#x27;s interest in Renaissance literature.

==Cultural legacy==

The writer&#x27;s investigations into Romanian culture also resulted in an accurate record of the Romanian language as it was spoken during his day, sampling dialects, jargon, slang, verbal tics, as well as illustrating the experiments undertaken by conflicting schools of linguistics during the 19th and early 20th century, as well as the traces they left on the Romanian lexis. In Tudor Vianu&#x27;s opinion, this was partly owed to his keen musical ear.

Caragiale was an enduring influence on both Romanian humor and the views Romanians take of themselves. His comedies and various stories have produced a series of catchphrases, many of which are still present in both cultural reference. Nevertheless, his uncomfortable criticism has occasionally seen him assigned a secondary place in the Romanian curriculum and the academic discourse, a tendency notably endorsed by the Iron Guard and the Socialist Republic of Romania.

In parallel, Caragiale&#x27;s techniques have influenced 20th century dramatists such as Mihail Sorbul, Victor Ion Popa, Mihail Sebastian, and George Mihail Zamfirescu, and various directors, beginning with Constantin I. Nottara and . Several of his theatrical writings have been the subject of essays authored by director , whose interpretation of the texts made use of the Stanislavsky System. Caragiale&#x27;s short stories and novellas have inspired authors such as Ioan A. Bassarabescu, Gheorghe Brăescu, Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești, Dumitru D. Pătrășcanu, I. Peltz, and, in later decades, , Ioan Lăcustă, Horia Gârbea, and Dumitru Radu Popa. According to various authors, Caragiale was also a predecessor of Absurdism, and he is known to have been cited as an influence by the Absurdist dramatist Eugène Ionesco. Outside Romania, the impact of Ion Luca Caragiale&#x27;s literature was much reduced—the 1996 &quot;Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre&quot; attributed this to the technical problems posed by translations, as well as to the tendency of staging his works as period pieces. It was not until 2019 that one of his plays - A Lost Letter - was performed in English. The translation used on that occasion, at the Romanian Cultural Institute in London, is available here: https://www.pdf2html5.com/pdfupload/server/php/uploads/admin_oxffauqbza/lost-letter-2019/complete.php

Several authors have left memoirs of Ion Luca Caragiale. They include Octavian Goga and Ioan Slavici, I. Suchianu, Luca Caragiale, Ecaterina Logadi-Caragiale, and Cincinat Pavelescu. Among his later biographers was Octav Minar, who stood accused of having forged certain details for commercial gain. Direct or covert depictions of Caragiale are also present in several fiction works, starting with a revue first shown during his lifetime, and including novels by Goga, Slavici, N. Petrașcu, Emanoil Bucuța, Eugen Lovinescu, Constantin Stere, as well as a play by Camil Petrescu. In 1939, B. Jordan and Lucian Predescu, published a common signature novel on the writer, which was criticized for its style, tone, and inaccuracies. The short story writer Brătescu-Voinești proposed that Ion Luca Caragiale&#x27;s love affair with Veronica Micle and Eminescu&#x27;s anger provide the key to Eminescu&#x27;s poem &quot;Luceafărul&quot;, but his theory remains controversial. Caragiale is also probably present in his son Mateiu&#x27;s work &quot;Craii de Curtea-Veche&quot;, where his lifestyle and contribution to literature appear to be the subjects of derision.
The writer was elected to the Romanian Academy posthumously, in 1948, upon the proposal of novelist Mihail Sadoveanu. 2002, the 150th anniversary of Ion Luca Caragiale&#x27;s birth, was celebrated in Romania as the &quot;Anul Caragiale&quot; (the &quot;Caragiale Year&quot;). Annual theater festivals in his honor are held in Bucharest and the Moldovan capital of Chișinău. Caragiale&#x27;s work has been the subject of many productions in Romanian cinema and television—films based on his writings include the 1958 &quot;Două lozuri&quot; and Lucian Pintilie&#x27;s 1981 &quot;De ce trag clopotele, Mitică?&quot;. In 1982, a West German film, directed by Radu Gabrea and based on &quot;O făclie de Paște&quot;, was released as &quot;.

The Bucharest National Theater is currently known in full as &quot;Ion Luca Caragiale&quot; National Theater&quot;. Several educational institutions were named in his, including the University of Theatre and Film and the Ion Luca Caragiale National College in Bucharest, the national college in Ploiești, and a high school in Moreni. Among the statues raised in his honor are Constantin Baraschi&#x27;s Bucharest monument, and busts in the capital&#x27;s Cișmigiu Gardens and in Ploiești. He was the subject of portraits and caricatures by various artists, and, in 2007, upon the completion of a five-year project involving cartoonists inside and outside Romania, he was designated &quot;the most portrayed writer&quot; by the Guinness Book of Records (with over 1,500 individual drawings in a single exhibit).

In 1962, a house in Ploiești has been turned into a museum honoring Caragiale (the &quot;Dobrescu House&quot;). His native home in Haimanale was opened for the public in 1979. Memorial plaques have also been set up in Buzău and on Schöneberg&#x27;s Hohenzollerndamm. His name was given to streets, avenues, parks or quarters in many Romanian cities—such landmarks include the Bucharest street he lived on around 1900, a street in Ploiești, a quarter in Brașov, and a park in Cluj-Napoca. A street in Chișinău also bears the name Caragiale.

The novel &quot;The Republic&quot; by the Romanian-American novelist Bogdan Suceavă (Polirom Press, 2018) has as main character a 17-year old Ion Luca Caragiale, and depicts his involvement with the coup d&#x27;état attempt from 8 August 1870, in Ploiești.

<doc id="913506" wikidata="Q1883055" url="?curid=913506" title="Macross 7">
<text>is an anime television series. It is a sequel to the show &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; that takes place many years after the events of the first series following a cast of mostly new characters. The show ran from October 16, 1994, to September 24, 1995, at 11:00 a.m., and 49 episodes were aired. Although it has been distributed in the other parts of the world, for the longest amount of time it remained unlicensed in North America until July 2022 when Right Stuf along with Nozomi Entertainment announced that they would be releasing the series on home video.

&quot;Macross 7&quot; is best known for its music, and since the show began airing over a dozen albums have been released by the fictional band Fire Bomber that stars in the show. &quot;Macross 7&quot; exists in the official Studio Nue chronology and canon, with story concept by Shoji Kawamori, who also handled mechanical designs along with Kazutaka Miyatake. A theatrical episode, &quot;Macross 7: Ginga ga Ore wo Yondeiru! (Macross 7: The Galaxy&#x27;s Calling Me!)&quot;, was released in 1995. Several OVAs were also released, including &quot;Macross 7: Encore&quot; and later, &quot;Macross Dynamite 7&quot;. In 2012, a crossover movie retelling the &quot;Macross 7&quot; events by &quot;Macross F&quot; characters, &quot;Macross FB 7: Ore no Uta o Kike!&quot;, was released.

==Synopsis==

Thirty-five years after the events of the original &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot;, a spacecraft called Macross 7 leads the 37th colonial fleet on a colonization mission into deep space. The story focuses on the fleet&#x27;s encounters with an alien force called the Protodeviln, and especially events surrounding a rock and roll band called Fire Bomber, consisting of Basara Nekki (lead singer), Mylene Flare Jenius (seventh daughter of Maximilian Jenius and Milia Fallyna Jenius), Ray Lovelock, and full blooded Zentradi Veffidas Feaze.

The fleet&#x27;s flagship is the Macross 7, which is actually composed of two parts: Battle 7 and City 7. Battle 7 is the fore section of the ship. It is a fully transformable battle carrier that is able to separate itself from City 7 during battle. Battle 7 is captained by original series regular Maximilian Jenius, who is also the commander of the entire fleet. The much larger back section of the two part ship is known as City 7 and is the main civilian population center of the fleet, containing a population in excess of one million people. The mayor of City 7 is the estranged wife of Maximilian Jenius, Milia Fallyna Jenius. City 7 features a &quot;shell&quot; that can close in order to protect the civilian population during battle.

In the seventh year of their mission the Macross 7 fleet encounters an unknown alien enemy. This new mysterious enemy is composed of heavily modified Valkyries led by a man named Gigile. In the first encounter, the Macross 7 engages the enemy with squadrons of their own Valkyries. This conventional warfare does little to stop the attack however. The enemy&#x27;s tactics are different from the average rogue, or &#x27;uncultured&#x27;, Zentradi that are encountered in space travel. In the first battle with the Macross 7 fleet, the new enemy&#x27;s main tactic is to extract an energy form called &#x27;Spiritia&#x27; from the Valkyrie pilots, leaving them in a vegetative state.

Civilian musician Basara Nekki has a modified red state of the art VF-19 &quot;Fire&quot; Valkyrie of his own, and goes out to engage the enemy of his own accord. His VF-19 has an unusual control scheme that mimics a guitar, and he does not attack the enemy with weapons, choosing instead to fire speaker pods into enemy mecha, and playing his songs to the enemy. In the first few encounters, Basara&#x27;s music does little to drive the enemy away, and the Macross 7 fleet&#x27;s ace pilot, Gamlin Kizaki is bewildered and annoyed by Basara&#x27;s endeavor, claiming that it interferes with the other pilots during combat.

It is eventually revealed that Basara Nekki was given the Valkyrie by his friend and bandmate Ray Lovelock, who is a former UN Spacy Valkyrie pilot, and part of secret project inspired by the effectiveness of Lynn Minmay&#x27;s singing in the original war with the Zentradi. Eventually project head, Dr. Chiba, discovers that Spiritia deprived vegetative pilots can be revived. By playing them Fire Bomber&#x27;s music the patients eventually wake up and return to normal.

Eventually the enemy infiltrates City 7 and begins extracting Spiritia from civilians. Due to the secretive nature of the infiltrators and the state of their victims, they are dubbed &#x27;vampires&#x27; by the public forum. One of the &#x27;vampires&#x27; is captured and revealed to be a human from an earlier lost space mission. A brainwashing mechanism found inside the helmet of the &#x27;vampire&#x27; is used to control them. The captured prisoner is exposed to Fire Bomber&#x27;s music and regains his memories. The prisoner, now revealed to be a Blue Rhinoceros elite squadron pilot, Irana Hayakawa, tells his story. Harakawa stated that the Blue Rhinoceros was a team sent to investigate the fourth planet of the Varautan system, which apparently holds Protoculture secrets, or even descendants of the Protoculture themselves. They were supposed to rendezvous with the United Forces Advisor Ivano Gunther, only to find that Gunther was possessed by an alien entity called the Protodeviln. The entire mission force is taken by the Protodeviln and used to assemble the new Supervision Army that is attacking the Macross 7 fleet.

City 7 is stolen by the Protodeviln, and for a short period of time it is separated from the rest of the fleet. Eventually they are rescued. After this the elite fighter squadron Diamond Force is permanently assigned to City 7 as a special defense force.

The Sound Force is created by the UN Spacy, and all the members of Fire Bomber are given their own specially modified Valkyries. They are sent out to confront the enemy with their music whenever the fleet is attacked.

The Macross 7 fleet gathers information in an attempt to understand their new enemy, while Geperuniti, the leader of the Protodeviln, begins to take steps towards achieving his goal of creating a Spiritia Farm, capable of producing an endless supply of the energy force that the Protodeviln depend on for life. With a generous supply of Spiritia being collected by the &#x27;vampires&#x27;, other Protodevilns begin to awaken from their sleep. One of them, named Sivil, goes to attack the Macross fleet. During the first encounter between Basara and Sivil, the effectiveness of his music was proven when it drove Sivil away. Sivil becomes interested in Basara, whom she refers to as the Anima Spiritia. Gigile leaves the Protodeviln fleet and joins the &#x27;vampires&#x27; in City 7. Eventually due to constant contact with Basara and his music, Sivil begins to lose strength. She hides away in a separate &quot;forest&quot; section of City 7, and eventually goes into a state of hibernation, encasing herself in a force field. Basara discovers Sivil and sings to her daily in the hope of waking her up. Gigile watches Basara from the shadows, and collects Spiritia in order to help revive Sivil.

Around this time, Dr. Chiba discovers that Basara&#x27;s singing creates what he calls Sound Energy. He creates the &#x27;Sound Boosters&#x27;, an attachment for the Sound Force Valkyries, in order to amplify and control the projection of this energy in battle.

Meanwhile, another colonization fleet, the Macross 5, makes contact with the Macross 7 fleet. The Macross 5 fleet has found a suitable planet to inhabit, and christened it as the planet Rax. However, soon the Macross 7 fleet loses all contact with the Macross 5. Arriving at Rax, they find the whole Macross 5 fleet decimated, but oddly few dead bodies are found. They assume that the people of the Macross 5 fleet were in fact taken captive by the Protodeviln. The Protodeviln fleet surrounds the planet forcing the Macross 7 fleet to remain on its surface.

At this time the military found out about Sivil being in the forest section of City 7 and takes her away to be studied. Gigile rampages in his Battroid in an attempt to find and rescue Sivil. Together he and Basara managed to awakened Sivil, who escapes from the laboratory.

Basara decides to search the planet for Sivil. Finally, he and Gigile find her inside an active volcano. Basara begins singing and manages to awaken her. When Sivil is awakened, the volcano suddenly begin to sink into the ocean. After the dust clears a ruin rises from sea. The ruins are investigated by the non micronized Zentradi Exsedol Folmo, who is now the top science advisor in the Macross 7 fleet. He concludes that it is a ruin from the Protoculture. The ruins reveal the mysterious genesis of the Protodeviln and how they were defeated by the Protoculture using something called the &quot;Anima Spiritia&quot;. In the end, the ruins are destroyed by Geperuniti&#x27;s fleet and another pair of Protodeviln called Glavil and Gavil. This happens before the Macross crew can find out exactly what Anima Spiritia is.

Geperuniti now views Sivil and Gigile as a threat to his plans of creating a Spiritia Farm and orders his Protodeviln henchmen, Valgo, Gavil and Glavil to pursue and kill them. In the ensuing battle Gigile takes on his true form, and begins to sing Basara&#x27;s music. He discovers that he can actually generate his own Spiritia this way. Gigile defends Sivil to his death, causing the entire planet Rax to explode.

Basara and Sivil mourn for Gigile while the battle with Geperuniti intensifies. The UN Government of Earth gives the permission to Captain Maximilian Jenius to use the illegal Reaction Weaponry against the Protodeviln. Captain Jenius forms a plan called Operation Stargazer in which a few elite volunteer pilots will accompany him to the fourth planet of the Varautan system, now known to be the base of Protodeviln operations. The mission is to stealthily attack the planet and plant the Reaction Weaponry in the chamber which houses the Protodevilns&#x27; bodies. Mayor Milia Fallyna Jenius is given temporary command of the fleet during the mission. Amongst the volunteers for this mission are the entire Sound Force.

Basara decides to do things &quot;his&quot; way and starts singing as soon as he reaches the planet. Surrounded by heavy fire, Diamond Force leader Gamlin Kizaki decides to focus on defending the Sound Force. He eventually crashes his Valkyrie unto Gavil&#x27;s FBz-99G Zaubergern mecha, destroying it, but also appearing to be killed himself. When all looks lost the real plan of Operation Stargazer is revealed as Captain Jenius folds into the battle in a new advanced VF-22S Sturmvogel II Valkyrie carrying the Reaction Weapon. He races into the heart of the enemy stronghold, plants the weapon, and orders everyone to flee. But the mission is thwarted when in the last minute when the ingenious Geperuniti folds the Reaction Weapon to the location of Operation Stargazer group&#x27;s Northhampton class frigate, destroying it.

The surviving members of the operation are captured by the Protodeviln, but they eventually manage to escape their holding cells. Just then Gamlin reappears in a Varautan Mecha, and helps defend the escapees against Gavil&#x27;s attacks. While escaping, they discovered the Protodevilns have imprisoned the captured Macross 5 people, encasing them in a crystal-like chamber, and extracting their Spiritia. Basara tries to save them, but his efforts are in vain and they are forced to evacuate the area before Geperuniti destroys them. They escape using one of the Varautan space cruisers.

After escaping, Gamlin was possessed by Gavil, and he takes his VF-17D Nightmare Valkyrie and goes on a rampage through the Macross 7. The Sound Force were deployed and Basara and Mylene started singing. Gavil then captured Mylene and demands that Basara surrenders to the Protodeviln. Just then, Mylene steps out of her Valkyrie and starts singing, drawing out the possessed Gamlin out of his Valkyrie. Gavil is forced to depart from Gamlin and flees.

In another battle, the newly awakened Protodeviln twins, Zomd and Goram confronts the Macross 7 Fleet. Bringing along the crystal-like chambers containing the Macross 5 people, Basara&#x27;s music was turned against him - as his music would serve to regenerate the Spiritia of the captured Macross 5 people, which later would be extracted from them to revive the Protodeviln twins. However, Captain Maximilian Jenius devises a plan to use the fold generators on the chambers and the plan was carried out by Gamlin and Docker, the leader of the Emerald Force. When the chambers are safely folded away, all the ships in the fleet fire their Reaction Weaponries. Although the Protodeviln twins were severely injured, they miraculously regenerated. Basara begins to sing and drives them mad. Sivil shows up and drives the Protodeviln away, but her powers are drained, and she crashes into Battle 7. Basara tries to revive her, but she accidentally drains him of his Spiritia, putting him into a vegetative state.

In the last part of the series, Geperuniti takes on his true form, which is an enormous Spiritia &quot;Black Hole&quot; that will eventually drain the entire universe of Spiritia. Under the command of Captain Maximilian Jenius, Battle 7 folded to the Protodeviln&#x27;s base, begins to transform in order to fire the Sound Buster - the combination of Song Energy and the Macross Cannon. Firing several rounds of the Sound Buster, the Macross Cannon overloads and explodes. A strange reaction occurs, and Geperuniti begins to lose control of himself.

Waves of energy hit Battle 7 and prove to be too powerful for even the pinpoint barrier to withstand. Battle 7 is destroyed and the crews flee to safety. Geperuniti begins to extract Spiritia from everyone, even folding the rest of the Macross 7 fleet, including City 7 in order to extract more Spiritia. Geperuniti even goes against his own kind, killing Zomd and Goram. Gavil and Gravil, then, goes against Geperuniti, trying to convince him to stop. At the very last minute, Basara awakens when everyone begins singing to him, and goes out to fight Geperuniti. Together with Sivil they sing to Geperuniti until he also begins to sing. Geperuniti realizes that he can create his own Spiritia through music, and takes on a new form. He and his host of remaining Protodeviln then leave this galaxy to explore the rest of the universe. Sivil tells Basara that she will always remember his songs, and goes off with her kind.

====&quot;Macross 7 the Movie: The Galaxy&#x27;s Calling Me!&quot;====
&quot;Macross 7 the Movie: The Galaxy&#x27;s Calling Me!&quot; (劇場版マクロス7 銀河がオレを呼んでいる!) is a theatrical episode of &quot;Macross 7&quot;. It is estimated to be the episode around episodes 38-41 of &quot;Macross 7&quot;, (in reference to episode 42), which was shown alongside &quot;Macross Plus: Movie Edition&quot;. The story tells of how Basara Nekki and Mylene Flare Jenius&#x27; sister, Emilia Jenius became acquainted. Basara winds up on an icy planet due to a fold accident. The townsfolk he encounters say a monster lives in the mountains, which causes Basara to investigate. He then meets Emilia Jenius, a full-sized Meltlan who sings on the planet because her voice is too loud for populated worlds. Emilia, who sports Milia Fallyna Jenius&#x27; green hair, aspires to be like Lynn Minmay, flies a Queadlunn Ouilqua Power Armor—a custom variant. Emilia&#x27;s singing causes an Anima Spiritia irregularity, causing the Protodevilin, Gavil, Glavil and Natter-Valgo to investigate on orders by Lord Gepernich. Basara and Emilia fight the Protodevilin with song after Basara throws his VF-19-Kai &quot;Fire Valkyrie&quot; in the way of Emilia&#x27;s missiles attacking Glavil. With the help of the other Sound Force members who show up during the battle, along with Gamlin Kizaki, the Protodevilins are repelled and flee. However, Emilia&#x27;s custom power armor is destroyed during the battle while saving the townsfolk from a flood.

Released in 2012 in celebration of &quot;Macross&quot; 30th anniversary, &quot;Macross FB 7&quot; was a full-length theatrical movie that continued the &quot;Macross 7&quot; and &quot;Macross F&quot; series&#x27; story.

===OVAs===
====&quot;Macross 7: Encore&quot;====
The &quot;Macross 7: Encore&quot; (マクロス7 アンコール) OVA consists of 3 unrelated episodes set in the original &quot;Macross 7&quot; TV series timeline. It is speculated that the story of &quot;Macross 7: Encore&quot; takes place around episodes 39-42 of &quot;Macross 7&quot;, (in reference to episode 43; when Max and Miria talk in the Captain&#x27;s Ready room/Office). The first episode, &quot;Fleet of the Strongest Women&quot;, the Macross 7 fleet encountered a fleet of uncultured Meltlandi led by Chlore, an ace pilot rival of Milia. The second episode, &quot;On Stage&quot;, details the story behind Basara Nekki, Ray Lovelock and Veffidas Feaze and describes how the rock band, Fire Bomber, was formed. Lastly, in the third episode, &quot;Which One Do You Love?&quot;, Milia Fallyna Jenius thinks that she is dying due to her micronization, and thus desires to fulfill her last objectives before she &#x27;departs&#x27;.

A subplot that involved the sexual assault and drugging of main character Mylene Flare Jenius was removed when the OVA series was released on streaming services in Japan and overseas due to the character being a minor and the use of lesbian stereotypes.

===Manga===
====&quot;Macross 7: Trash&quot;====
&quot;Macross 7: Trash&quot; (マクロス7 トラッシュ) is an eight-volume manga series by Macross character designer Haruhiko Mikimoto, serving as a side-story to &quot;Macross 7&quot;. &quot;Trash&quot; takes place early during the year 2046, focusing on Shiva Midou (a young &quot;T-Crush&quot; athlete who is rumored to be an illegitimate son of the famous Max Jenius), Mahala Fabrio (an ex-military officer), and Enika Cherryni (Shiva&#x27;s girlfriend, who becomes the next &quot;Minmay Voice&quot; singing idol), as the three become entwined in a military plot. Unlike many other &quot;Macross&quot; manga, &quot;Trash&quot; does not feature any mecha or combat, instead focusing on the characters themselves. It was serialized for 52 monthly chapters in &quot;Shōnen Ace&quot; magazine from October 1994 to May 2001, then published as tankōbon from 1995 to 2001 by Kadokawa Shoten. In 2003, TokyoPop announced that they would be working with Harmony Gold to bring the &quot;Macross 7: Trash&quot; manga to the West with a slated spring 2004 release. However, licensing issues (likely due to legal complications regarding the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise rights in the west at the time) caused the release to get cancelled.

Trash takes place in the Macross 7 fleet early during the year 2046 of Macross timeline. The story revolves around a sport called &quot;T-Crush&quot;, similar to roller derby but with air blades (hovering roller blades) and fighting. As the story progresses, weapons are added to the equipment and it becomes a one-on-one combat tournament.

Another plot element is the &quot;Mind System&quot; used to power the weapons in the tournament. The system was in development 7 years before the story begins and it caused a fatal accident during a military training session. On the surface, the system converts the emotions of a person into energy but the true functionality of the system is hidden until late in the story.

The story starts with Mahala quitting the military and being asked by Colonel Bacelon to seek out talented people and recruit them as pilots. By chance, she meets Shiva, a T-Crush player, and she becomes the coach of his team. Bacelon supplies the teams with weapons powered with the Mind System and organizes a tournament. Mahala became suspicious of Bacelon&#x27;s intentions but is forced to cooperate after she was caught breaking into his data files. The team makes their way to the final where the truth is revealed.

===Characters===

* : Shiva&#x27;s girlfriend, who becomes the next &quot;Minmay Voice&quot; singing idol.

==International release==
Due to a current legal dispute over the distribution rights of the &quot;Macross&quot; franchise, involving Studio Nue and Big West against Harmony Gold, much of the &quot;Macross&quot; merchandise, including &quot;Macross 7&quot;, have not received an international release.

However, on March 1, 2021, Big West, Studio Nue and Harmony Gold reached an agreement on the international distribution of most &quot;Macross&quot; sequels and films. On July 2, 2022, during an Anime Expo panel held by Right Stuf and Nozomi Entertainment, they announced that &quot;Macross 7&quot; would be getting its first North American home video release on Blu-Ray via two sets being regular and collector&#x27;s edition Blu-Rays, respectively.

==Soundtrack==
&quot;Macross 7&quot; is unique from other &quot;Macross&quot; titles, as it does not have its own musical score. Instead, it relies heavily on songs by Fire Bomber as its soundtrack. The series also reuses selected BGM tracks and songs from &quot;Macross II&quot; and &quot;Macross Plus&quot;.

<text>In computer graphics, a sprite is a two-dimensional bitmap that is integrated into a larger scene, most often in a 2D video game. Originally, the term &quot;sprite&quot; referred to fixed-sized objects composited together, by hardware, with a background. Use of the term has since become more general.

Systems with hardware sprites include arcade video games of the 1970s and 1980s; game consoles including as the Atari VCS (1977), ColecoVision (1982), Famicom (1983), Genesis/Mega Drive (1988); and home computers such as the TI-99/4 (1979), Atari 8-bit computers (1979), Commodore 64 (1982), MSX (1983), Amiga (1985), and X68000 (1987). Hardware varies in the number of sprites supported, the size and colors of each sprite, and special effects such as scaling or reporting pixel-precise overlap.

Hardware composition of sprites occurs as each scan line is prepared for the video output device, such as a cathode-ray tube, without involvement of the main CPU and without the need for a full-screen frame buffer. Sprites can be positioned or altered by setting attributes used during the hardware composition process. The number of sprites which can be displayed per scan line is often lower than the total number of sprites a system supports. For example, the Texas Instruments TMS9918 chip supports 32 sprites, but only four can appear on the same scan line.

The CPUs in modern computers, video game consoles, and mobile devices are fast enough that bitmaps can be drawn into a frame buffer without special hardware assistance. Beyond that, GPUs can render vast numbers of scaled, rotated, anti-aliased, partially translucent, very high resolution images in parallel with the CPU.

== Etymology ==
According to Karl Guttag, one of two engineers for the 1979 Texas Instruments TMS9918 video display processor, this use of the word &quot;sprite&quot; came from David Ackley, a manager at TI. It was also used by Danny Hillis at Texas Instruments in the late 1970s. The term was derived from the fact that sprites &quot;float&quot; on top of the background image without overwriting it, much like a ghost or mythological sprite.

Some hardware manufacturers used different terms, especially before &quot;sprite&quot; became common:

Player/Missile Graphics was a term used by Atari, Inc. for hardware sprites in the Atari 8-bit computers (1979) and Atari 5200 console (1982). The term reflects the use for both characters (&quot;players&quot;) and smaller associated objects (&quot;missiles&quot;) that share the same color. The earlier Atari Video Computer System and some Atari arcade games used &quot;player&quot;, &quot;missile&quot;, and &quot;ball&quot;.

Stamp was used in some arcade hardware in the early 1980s, including &quot;Ms. Pac-Man&quot;.

Movable Object Block, or MOB, was used in MOS Technology&#x27;s graphics chip literature. Commodore, the main user of MOS chips and the owner of MOS for most of the chip maker&#x27;s lifetime, instead used the term &quot;sprite&quot; for the Commodore 64.

OBJs (short for &quot;objects&quot;) is used in the developer manuals for the NES, Super NES, and Game Boy. The region of video RAM used to store sprite attributes and coordinates is called OAM (Object Attribute Memory). This also applies to the Game Boy Advance and Nintendo DS.

==History==
===Arcade video games===
The use of sprites originated with arcade video games. Nolan Bushnell came up with the original concept when he developed the first arcade video game, &quot;Computer Space&quot; (1971). Technical limitations made it difficult to adapt the early mainframe game &quot;Spacewar!&quot; (1962), which performed an entire screen refresh for every little movement, so he came up with a solution to the problem: controlling each individual game element with a dedicated transistor. The rockets were essentially hardwired bitmaps that moved around the screen independently of the background, an important innovation for producing screen images more efficiently and providing the basis for sprite graphics.

The earliest video games to represent player characters as human player sprites were arcade sports video games, beginning with Taito&#x27;s &quot;TV Basketball&quot;, released in April 1974 and licensed to Midway Manufacturing for release in North America. Designed by Tomohiro Nishikado, he wanted to move beyond simple &quot;Pong&quot;-style rectangles to character graphics, by rearranging the rectangle shapes into objects that look like basketball players and basketball hoops. Ramtek released another sports video game in October 1974, &quot;Baseball&quot;, which similarly displayed human-like characters.

The Namco Galaxian arcade system board, for the 1979 arcade game &quot;Galaxian&quot;, displays animated, multi-colored sprites over a scrolling background. It became the basis for Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Radar Scope&quot; and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot; arcade hardware and home consoles such as the Nintendo Entertainment System. According to Steve Golson from General Computer Corporation, the term &quot;stamp&quot; was used instead of &quot;sprite&quot; at the time.

===Home systems===
Signetics devised the first chips capable of generating sprite graphics (referred to as &quot;objects&quot; by Signetics) for home systems. The Signetics 2636 video processors were first used in the 1978 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System and later in the 1979 Elektor TV Games Computer.

The Atari VCS, released in 1977, has a hardware sprite implementation where five graphical objects can be moved independently of the game playfield. The term &quot;sprite&quot; was not in use at the time. The VCS&#x27;s sprites are called &quot;movable objects&quot; in the programming manual, further identified as two &quot;players&quot;, two &quot;missiles&quot;, and one &quot;ball&quot;. These each consist of a single row of pixels that are displayed on a scan line. To produce a two-dimensional shape, the sprite&#x27;s single-row bitmap is altered by software from one scan line to the next.

The 1979 Atari 400 and 800 home computers have similar, but more elaborate, circuitry capable of moving eight single-color objects per scan line: four 8-bit wide &quot;players&quot; and four 2-bit wide &quot;missiles&quot;. Each is the full height of the display—a long, thin strip. DMA from a table in memory automatically sets the graphics pattern registers for each scan line. Hardware registers control the horizontal position of each player and missile. Vertical motion is achieved by moving the bitmap data within a player or missile&#x27;s strip. The feature was called &quot;player/missile graphics&quot; by Atari.

Texas Instruments developed the TMS9918 chip with sprite support for its 1979 TI-99/4 home computer. An updated version is used in the 1981 TI-99/4A.

===In 2.5D and 3D games===

Sprites remained popular with the rise of 2.5D games (those which recreate a 3D game space from a 2D map) in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A technique called billboarding allows 2.5D games to keep onscreen sprites rotated toward the player view at all times. Some 2.5D games, such as 1993&#x27;s &quot;Doom&quot;, allow the same entity to be represented by different sprites depending on its rotation relative to the viewer, furthering the illusion of 3D.

Fully 3D games usually present world objects as 3D models, but sprites are supported in some 3D game engines, such as GoldSrc and Unreal, and may be billboarded or locked to fixed orientations. Sprites remain useful for small details, particle effects, and other applications where the lack of a third dimension is not a major detriment.

==Systems with hardware sprites==
These are base hardware specs and do not include additional programming techniques, such as using raster interrupts to repurpose sprites mid-frame.

<text>The South Carolina General Assembly, also called the South Carolina Legislature, is the state legislature of the U.S. state of South Carolina. The legislature is bicameral and consists of the lower South Carolina House of Representatives and the upper South Carolina Senate. All together, the General Assembly consists of 170 members. The legislature convenes at the State House in Columbia.

Prior to the 1964 federal &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; decision by the U.S. Supreme Court, each county doubled as a legislative district, with each county electing one senator and at least one representative. Moreover, each county&#x27;s General Assembly delegation also doubled as its county council, as the state constitution made no provision for local government.

The &quot;one man, one vote&quot; provision of &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot; caused district lines to cross county lines, causing legislators to be on multiple county councils. This led to the passage of the Home Rule Act of 1975, which created county councils that were independent of the General Assembly. However, the General Assembly still retains considerable authority over local government. As a result, the legislature still devotes considerable time to local matters, and county legislative delegations still handle many matters that are handled by county governments in the rest of the country.

There are 124 members of the South Carolina House of Representatives, who are elected every two years, and the South Carolina Senate has 46 members, elected every four years concurrent to the presidential election. For both houses, there are no term limits. The General Assembly meets in joint session to elect judges, with all 170 members having an equal vote in such elections.

==Role== 
The main role of the South Carolina General Assembly is to pass laws &quot;as the common good may require.&quot; In order for a bill to become law, both the Senate and House of Representatives must vote to pass the bill by a simple majority. Then the bill must be sent to the governor. If the governor vetoes the bill, both houses can either sustain the veto or override the veto. Veto overrides require a two-thirds majority. Once he receives the bill, if the governor neither signs nor vetoes the bill, it becomes law after five days, Sundays excluded.

==Qualifications==
===Senators===

According to the South Carolina Constitution, no person may serve as a senator who:

*Is not qualified to vote in state elections
*Is not a resident of the district in which he or she seeks to represent 
*Is not at least 25 years of age
*Has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony or voter fraud or bribery unless 15 years has elapsed since the time was served.

===Representatives===

According to the South Carolina Constitution, no person may serve as a representative who:

*Is not qualified to vote in state elections
*Is not a resident of the district in which he or she seeks to represent 
*Is not at least 21 years of age
*Has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a felony or voter fraud or bribery unless 15 years has elapsed since the time was served.

<text>The Russian Academy of Arts, informally known as the Saint Petersburg Academy of Arts, was an art academy in Saint Petersburg, founded in 1757 by Ivan Shuvalov, the founder of the Imperial Moscow University, under the name &quot;Academy of the Three Noblest Arts&quot;. Catherine the Great renamed it the Imperial Academy of Arts and commissioned a new building, completed 25 years later in 1789 by the Neva River. The academy promoted the neoclassical style and technique, and sent its promising students to European capitals for further study. Training at the academy was virtually required for artists to make successful careers.

Formally abolished in 1918 after the Russian Revolution, the academy was renamed several times. It established free tuition; students from across the country competed fiercely for its few places annually. In 1947 the national institution was moved to Moscow, and much of its art collection was moved to the Hermitage. The building in Leningrad was devoted to the Ilya Repin Leningrad Institute for Painting, Sculpture and Architecture, named in honor of Ilya Repin, one of the foremost realist artists in Russia. Since 1991, it has been called the St. Petersburg Institute for Painting, Sculpture and Architecture.

== In Imperial Russia ==
The academy was initially located in the Shuvalov Mansion on Sadovaya Street. In 1764, Catherine the Great renamed it the Imperial Academy of Arts and commissioned its first rector, Alexander Kokorinov, to design a new building. It took 25 years to complete the Neoclassical edifice, which opened in 1789. Konstantin Thon was responsible for the sumptuous decoration of the interiors. He also designed a quayside in front of the building, with stairs down to the Neva River, and adorned it with two 3000-year-old sphinxes, which were transported from Egypt.

Ivan Betskoy reorganized the academy into a de facto government department; it supervised matters concerning art throughout the country, distributing orders and awarding ranks to artists. The academy vigorously promoted the principles of Neoclassicism by sending the most notable Russian painters abroad, in order to learn the ancient and Renaissance styles of Italy and France. It also had its own sizable collection of choice artworks intended for study and copying.

In the mid-19th century, the Academism of training staff, much influenced by the doctrines of Dominique Ingres, was challenged by a younger generation of Russian artists who asserted their freedom to paint in a Realistic style. The adherents of this movement became known as &quot;peredvizhniki&quot; (Itinerants, related to their desire to bring art to the people). Led by Ivan Kramskoi, they publicly broke with the Academy and organized their own exhibitions, which traveled from town to town across Russia. Ilya Repin, Mikhail Vrubel and some other painters still regarded the academy&#x27;s training as indispensable for the development of basic professional and technical skills.

===Higher Art School of the Academy of Arts===
In 1893, Imperial Academy of Arts was divided into the Academy of Arts itself, which was responsible for all the artistic work in the Russian Empire, and the Higher Art School of the Academy of Arts, which dealt only with academic affairs. The initiator of the reform was the vice-president of the Academy, Count Ivan Ivanovich Tolstoy.

The Charter, approved at the end of 1893, divided the former Academy into two institutions:
* Academy itself (Academic «Assembly» consisting of the President, Vice-president, Conference secretary, 60 Full members and 20 Honorary members of the Academy), a state institution &quot;«for the maintenance, development and dissemination of art in Russia»&quot;.
* Educational institution — Higher Art School at the Academy, managed by the «Council of Professors» with the Rector at the head.

Both institutions were located in St. Petersburg in the historic building of the Academy of Arts.

Instead of the old professors, peredvizhniki artists were invited to teaching positions at the Higher Art School. The program of study at the Higher School has changed significantly: the institute of professors and managers was established and free topics for competitive tests were established. New professors came to the academy, among whom Ilya Repin stood out. Famous artists were invited by the heads of personal workshops: Vladimir Makovsky, Ivan Shishkin, Arkhip Kuindzhi, Aleksey Kivshenko. Later came: Alexander Kiselyov, Dmitry Kardovsky, Nikolay Dubovskoy, Nikolay Samokish, Vasily Mate.

===Big Gold Medal of the Imperial Academy of Arts===

The Big Gold Medal, which granted the right to a foreign pensioner (from three to six years), was awarded in a competition to which the most talented graduates of the Academy were allowed to complete their studies, awarded to the beginning of the competition with the small gold medal of the Academy &quot;«For Success in Drawing»&quot;.
Graduates who received a large gold medal remained at the Academy of Arts for another year; they were provided with a separate workshop, materials for work and a generous cash allowance.
Those admitted to the competition were obliged to execute the &quot;«program»&quot;, to draw a picture according to the program (creative task), one for all, approved by the Council of the Academy of Arts. The task, most often on a historical theme, was made in such a way that the participant showed all the professional skills and knowledge he mastered during his studies.

== In the Soviet Union ==

After the Russian Revolution of 1917, the Imperial Academy passed through a series of transformations. It was formally abolished in 1918 and the Petrograd Free Art Educational Studios (&quot;Pegoskhuma&quot;) created in its place; this was renamed the Petrograd &quot;Svomas (Free Art Studios) in 1919, the Petrograd State Art-Educational Studios of the Reconstructed Academy of Arts in 1921, Vkhutein&quot; in 1928, the Institute of Proletarian Fine Arts in 1930, the Russian Academy of Arts in 1933, and the Academy of Arts of the USSR in 1947. After the Academy&#x27;s move to Moscow that year, the building in what was then called Leningrad was renamed Ilya Repin Leningrad Institute for Painting, Sculpture and Architecture.

The national academy has stayed in Moscow. In 1991 it was renamed the Russian Academy of Arts. The old academy&#x27;s art collection, which included major works by Poussin, David and Ingres, was removed to the Hermitage Museum across the river.

During the Soviet era, academies were free of tuition fees as they were financed by the government, but admission was intensely competitive. Many would-be students would apply to the Academy for as many as six or seven years in a row without success. With just twenty places available and thousands of applicants, the competition was brutal.

===Graduates of Ilya Repin Leningrad Institute (1930–1950)===
Well-known graduates of Ilya Repin Leningrad Institute for Painting, Sculpture and Architecture in 1930–1950s include:

== Current situation ==

The Russian Academy of Arts has been headquartered in Moscow since 1947. Its current president is Zurab Tsereteli and its vice-president is Tair Salakhov.

The historic building on the Neva River in St. Petersburg is used for the &quot;Saint Petersburg Repin Academy of Arts&quot;, in honor of one of its well-known alumni. It is also called the St. Petersburg State Academic Institute of Fine Arts, Sculpture and Architecture (as on its website).

<doc id="913524" wikidata="Q411137" url="?curid=913524" title="Benitoite">
<text>Benitoite () is a rare blue barium titanium cyclosilicate mineral, found in hydrothermally altered serpentinite. It forms in low temperature, high pressure environments typical of subduction zones at convergent plate boundaries. Benitoite fluoresces under short wave ultraviolet light, appearing bright blue to bluish white in color. The more rarely seen clear to white benitoite crystals fluoresce red under long-wave UV light.

It was discovered in 1907 by prospector James M. Couch in the San Benito Mountains roughly halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles. Due to its similar color, Couch originally believed it to be sapphire, a variety of corundum. In 1909, a sample was sent to the University of California, Berkeley, where mineralogist Dr. George D. Louderback realized it was a previously unknown mineral. Corundum (sapphire) has a defined Mohs hardness of 9, while benitoite is much softer. He named it &quot;benitoite&quot; for its occurrence near the headwaters of the San Benito River in San Benito County, California.

Benitoite occurs in a number of isolated locations globally, but gemstone quality material has only been found in California at the Benito Gem Mine where it was first discovered. It has been correctly identified in Montana, Arkansas, Japan, and Australia although they formed under slightly different conditions and only grow large enough to be considered an accessory mineral. In 1985 benitoite was named as the official state gem of California.

Benitoite typically crystallizes hexagonally. Non-gem crystals of benitoite can have a very rare, six-pointed twinned form.

==Associated minerals and locations==
Benitoite typically occurs with an unusual set of minerals, along with minerals that make up its host rock. Frequently associated minerals include: natrolite, neptunite, joaquinite, serpentine and albite.

Benitoite is a rare mineral found in very few locations including San Benito County, California, Japan and Arkansas. In the San Benito occurrence, it is found in natrolite veins within glaucophane schist within a serpentinite body. In Japan, the mineral occurs in a magnesio-riebeckite-quartz-phlogopite-albite dike cutting a serpentinite body.

<doc id="913539" wikidata="Q1321876" url="?curid=913539" title="Ejecta">
<text>Ejecta (; singular ejectum) are particles ejected from an area. In volcanology, in particular, the term refers to particles including pyroclastic materials (tephra) that came out of a volcanic explosion and magma eruption volcanic vent, or crater, has traveled through the air or under water, and fell back on the ground surface or on the ocean floor.

== Volcanology ==
Typically in volcanology, ejecta is a result of explosive eruptions. In an explosive eruption, large amounts of gas are dissolved in extremely viscous lava; this lava froths to the surface until the material is expelled rapidly due to the trapped pressure. Sometimes in such an event a lava plug or volcanic neck forms from lava that solidifies inside a volcano&#x27;s vent, causing heat and pressure to build up to an extreme with no way to escape. When the blockage breaks and cannot sustain itself any longer, a more violent eruption occurs, which allows materials to be ejected out of the volcano.

Ejecta can consist of:
# juvenile particles – (fragmented magma and free crystals)
# cognate or accessory particles – older volcanic rocks from the same volcano
# accidental particles – derived from the rocks under the volcano

These particles may vary in size; tephra can range from ash (&lt;) or lapilli (little stones from ) to volcanic bombs (&gt;).

== Planetary geology ==

In planetary geology, the term &quot;ejecta&quot; includes debris ejected during the formation of an impact crater.

When an object massive enough hits another object with enough force, it creates a shockwave that spreads out from the impact. The object breaks and excavates into the ground and rock, at the same time spraying material known as impact ejecta. This ejecta is distributed outward from the crater&#x27;s rim onto the surface as debris; it can be loose material or a blanket of debris, which thins at the outermost regions.

Ejecta features are classified based on their distance from the impact crater, the appearance of the ejected material, and the geomorphological characteristics of the terrain. Some common ejecta features include ejecta blankets, radial and concentric ejecta patterns, and secondary craters.

Ejecta Blankets: Ejecta blankets are the continuous layer of debris that surrounds the impact crater, thinning outwards from the crater&#x27;s rim. The composition of the ejecta blanket can provide valuable information about the geological composition of the impacted surface and the projectile that caused the impact. The distribution and morphology of the ejecta blanket can also provide insight into the impact angle and the dynamics of the ejecta emplacement process.

Radial and Concentric Ejecta Patterns: Radial ejecta patterns are characterized by the outward distribution of ejecta from the crater in a series of rays or streaks. These rays are often more prominent in craters formed on solid surfaces, such as the Moon or Mercury. Concentric ejecta patterns are characterized by the presence of multiple, circular layers of ejecta surrounding the impact crater. These patterns are commonly observed on icy surfaces, such as the moons of Jupiter and Saturn, and are indicative of the presence of subsurface volatiles, like water or other ices.

If enough ejecta are deposited around an impact crater, it can form an ejecta blanket; this blanket is full of dust and debris that originated from the initial impact. The size of this impact crater along with the ejecta blanket can be used to determine the size and intensity of the impacting object. On earth, these ejecta blankets can be analyzed to determine the source location of the impact.

A lack of impact ejecta around the planet Mars&#x27;s surface feature Eden Patera was one of the reasons for suspecting in the 2010s that it is a collapsed volcanic caldera and not an impact crater.

== Astronomy and heliophysics ==
In astrophysics or heliophysics, ejecta refers to material expelled in a stellar explosion as in a supernova or in a coronal mass ejection (CME).

== Artificial ==
Beside material launched by humans into space with a range of launch systems, some instances particularly nuclear produce artificial ejecta, like in the case of the Pascal-B test which might have ejected an object with a speed of Earth&#x27;s escape velocity into space.

<text>Stevenson School (also known as Robert Louis Stevenson School and abbreviated as RLS) is a coeducational, private school for boarding and day students in preschool through 12th grade. Its high school campus is in Pebble Beach, California, while its PK-8 campus is in an unincorporated area of neighboring Carmel.

==History==

In 1925, Grace Parsons Douglas (1880–1968) founded the Douglas Camp School for Girls in Pebble Beach after purchasing the land on the Monterey Peninsula from Samuel Finley Brown Morse. After operating the school for a quarter century, the school was sold in May 1952 to Robert and Marian Ricklefs and became the Del Monte School for Boys, then the Robert Louis Stevenson, which they named in honor of Robert Louis Stevenson, the well-known Scottish author who reportedly found inspiration for his tales of high adventure during his 1870s sojourn in the Monterey area. Many of the school buildings, the school newspaper, sports teams, and other features of the school are named for places or themes from Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s life or writings.

In the early years, Stevenson was a boys&#x27; school offering education in grades 7–12, though grades 7–8 were discontinued when the high school expanded.

The Pebble Beach Campus has had an Episcopal chaplain from the early days, though the school has always been open to students of all faiths. The school considers itself to be non-sectarian and explicit religious instruction is not included in the curriculum. In 1987, the Church in the Forest was established in Erdman Memorial Chapel on the Pebble Beach campus, initially with both Episcopalian and Methodist chaplains. The chapel is used by some local residents, and is where boarding students attend vespers.

Robert Ricklefs (May 23, 1909 – 20 May 1985) served as headmaster until he retired in 1970; he was succeeded by Gordon Davis, during whose term (1970–1982) the school opened its doors to girls as day students (1976).

Joe Wandke arrived in 1983, and during his administration the school has undergone a thorough renovation of the physical plant. In 1988 girls were first admitted as boarding students with the opening of the Silverado dormitory.

Also in 1988, the school was approached by the board of Briarcliff Academy, a private elementary school in the unincorporated area of Carmel Woods, north of Carmel, regarding a merger of the two schools. Stevenson then became a two-campus school comprising grades kindergarten through 12. The Carmel Campus (grades K through 8, adding Pre-K in September 2011) is located in Carmel, while the Pebble Beach Campus (grades 9–12) occupies the original school&#x27;s location in Pebble Beach.

In 2003 the Rosen Family Student Center was opened. Located in the middle of the Pebble Beach campus, the building features a college center, photography lab, tech center, activities center, wilderness center, multiple classrooms, and the new location of KSPB 91.9. The building is decorated with plush rugs and also features an amphitheater stage, which hosts school assemblies and concerts.

In 2016 Stevenson&#x27;s food service transitioned from Aqua Terra to Flik. Flik would set up tents in various places in the Carmel Campus and would have trucks come from the Pebble Beach Campus where the food was cooked. Eventually Flik would receive their own dedicated building to serve food in 2018.

In 2011 the Carmel Campus received a new turf field with the center featuring an &quot;S&quot; replacing the old grass field. In 2014 the assembly building located in the northeastern area of the campus was renovated and split up into 3 rooms. This was done to improve STEM learning by giving students spaces specifically designed for the sciences. In 2016 a new amphitheater was constructed between the lawn and blacktop resembling Wandke amphitheater at the Pebble Beach campus. Minor changes were made to the blacktop layout as well. In 2018 a new building located in the northern area of the campus began construction for Flik Dining Services to prepare and serve lunch. In 2020 renovations were made to the main playground adding a seesaw, 2 swings, a tire swing, and two climbing structures. This replaced the previous playground which consisted of 4 swings, monkey bars, a wooden house, and a central structure with slides and bridges. Similar changes were made with the Kindergarten playground. The Pre-K playground remains the same. In 2022 the blacktop received a change in layout, a new ramp, and an improved passageway to the field.

In 2018 the Pebble Beach Campus constructed a new field next to the older baseball and football field. In 2024 the science building is planned to be replaced with a new and improved science building. This is predicted to be complete in 2026.

In 2015, it was announced that Stevenson graduate Kevin Hicks would succeed Wandke as president.

In September 2022, President Hicks was placed on temporary administrative leave from Stevenson School pending an independent inquiry into certain employee concerns that were voiced to the board. In December 2022, it was announced that Hicks&#x27; employment had been terminated for undisclosed reasons, with then-Acting President Dan Griffiths accepting an offer to become the school&#x27;s next president.

==Extracurricular activities==

;Athletics

Stevenson fields varsity teams in tennis, golf, baseball, basketball, American football, lacrosse, field hockey, swimming, water polo, and sailing, among others. In 2018, Stevenson installed a new AstroTurf field for soccer and lacrosse. Historically, Stevenson has fielded strong teams in tennis, golf, lacrosse, and soccer. Stevenson&#x27;s athletic director Justin Clymo was awarded the Golden Whistle Award in February 2019.

Stevenson also hosts the Stevenson Lacrosse Camp each year in July.

;Clubs and activities

The school is home to KSPB 91.9 FM. Other clubs include international debate societies such as Model UN, music and athletic fan clubs, Amnesty International, community service groups such as the Red Cross Club, and a competitive robotics team.

;Arts

Stevenson offers courses in both the fine and performing arts including levels of drama, choir, radio and media, drawing and painting, filmmaking and ceramics. Each year the school puts on two plays and one musical in Keck Auditorium located on the Pebble Beach campus.

==Academic program==

Stevenson offers a wide range of courses geared to prepare students for further study at colleges and universities around the world. Students take courses in English, fine arts, foreign languages (currently Latin, French, Spanish, and Japanese), history, mathematics, science, technology and outdoor education. The school also has a long history of hosting AFS exchange students. Several students participate in study abroad programs each year.

Stevenson students have a long history of attending universities all over the United States. Popular choices include UCLA, USC, and LMU. Nearly 100% of Stevenson graduates continue their education elsewhere.

<text>Lewiston is a former village in the town of Norwich, Windsor County, Vermont, United States. Settlers first arrived in that area in 1765; the village&#x27;s namesake, Dr. Joseph Lewis, arrived two years later. From the late 19th century, the village was centered on a rail station that was used by both Norwich and the town directly across the Connecticut River, Hanover, New Hampshire.

Because of the rail station, built in 1884, Lewiston became important to surrounding towns on both sides of the Connecticut River and to Dartmouth College in Hanover. The coal that Dartmouth used to heat its buildings came through this station. By the 1920s, however, the economic importance of Lewiston to the neighboring regions decreased. Dartmouth began using oil instead of coal, and all the mills in Lewiston were gone by 1930. The railroad remains today, though the station is not used for its original purpose.

In 1950, lower-lying farm areas were flooded when the Wilder Dam was constructed downstream. In 1967, almost all of Lewiston was razed to make way for Interstate 91 and its access road from Hanover. The railroad, a Dartmouth College-owned pottery studio (in the house once owned by Dr. Joseph Lewis), and a small road off McKenna Road, Lewiston Hill Road, make up some of the area where the center of the village of Lewiston was situated. Many of the buildings in that area are now owned by Dartmouth.

Lewiston is located at , and its elevation is 387 feet.

<text>A parking space, parking place or parking spot is a location that is designated for parking, either paved or unpaved. It can be in a parking garage, in a parking lot or on a city street. The space may be delineated by road surface markings. The automobile fits inside the space, either by parallel parking, perpendicular parking or angled parking.

If in tandem parking. Whoever pulled in the tandem parking stall first is now technically in the back. The second car, is now in the front since they have to leave first. 

Depending on the location of the parking space, the time allowed to park may be fixed by regulation, and a fee may be required to use the parking space. It may be designated for free parking. When the demand for spaces outstrips supply, vehicles may overspill park onto the sidewalk, grass verges and other places which were not designed for the purpose.

== Patterns ==
For most motorised vehicles, there are three commonly used arrangements of parking spaces—parallel parking, perpendicular parking, and angle parking. These are self-park configurations where the vehicle driver is able to access the parking independently.

=== Parallel parking ===


With parallel parking of cars, these are arranged in a line, with the front bumper of one car facing the back bumper of an adjacent one. This is done parallel to a curb, when one is provided. Parallel parking is the most common mode of streetside parking for cars. It may also be used in parking lots and parking structures, but usually only to supplement parking spaces that use the other modes.

=== Perpendicular parking ===
With perpendicular parking, also known as bay parking, cars are parked side to side, perpendicular to an aisle, curb, or wall. This type of car parking fits more cars per length of road (or curb) than parallel parking when a wider space is available, and is therefore commonly used in car parking lots and car parking structures.

Often, in car parking lots using perpendicular parking, two rows of parking spaces may be arranged front to front, with aisles in between. If no other cars are blocking, a driver may perform a &quot;pullthrough&quot; by driving through one parking space into the connecting space to avoid having to reverse out of a parking space upon their return.

Sometimes, a single row of perpendicular car parking spaces is marked in the center of a street. This arrangement eliminates reversing from the maneuver; cars are required to drive in forwards and drive out forwards.

=== Angle parking/echelon parking ===
Angle parking, known as &quot;echelon parking&quot; in Britain, is similar to perpendicular parking for these vehicles, except that cars are arranged at an angle to the aisle (an acute angle with the direction of approach). The gentler turn allows easier and quicker parking, narrower aisles, and thus higher density than perpendicular parking. While in theory the aisles are one-way, in practice they are typically wide enough to allow two cars to pass slowly when drivers go down the aisles the wrong way.

Angle parking is very common in car parking lots. It may also be used in streetside car parking in the U.S. when there is more width available for car parking than would be needed for parallel parking of cars, as it creates a larger number of parking spaces. Some cities have utilized angled parking on-street (as compared to off-street parking facilities). This has been done mostly in residential, retail and mixed-use areas where additional parking compared to parallel parking is desired and traffic volumes are lower. Most angled parking is designed in a &quot;head-in&quot; configuration while a few cities (Seattle, Portland, Baltimore, and Indianapolis are examples) have some &quot;back-in&quot; angled parking (typically on hills or low traffic volume streets).

Angle parking is considered dangerous by cycling organizations, especially in the &quot;head-in&quot; configuration, despite the increased visibility when reversing out of the space compared with reversing out of a perpendicular parking space. When comparing to parallel parking:

# There is a significant risk to cyclists from vehicles reversing out, as approaching bicycles are in the blind spot of the reversing and turning vehicles.
# Longer vehicles project further into the road; this can inconvenience/endanger other road users,
# The &quot;surplus&quot; road space which enables angle parking could also be used for bicycle lanes.

Hence organisations such as the Cyclists Touring Club are usually opposed to all proposed echelon parking schemes, though there are some alternatives, such as back-in angle parking (slanted the &quot;wrong&quot; way, with the driver reversing into the space, rather than reversing out), which can overcome many of the issues of safety.

=== Other parking methods ===
Besides these basic modes of motor vehicle parking, there are instances where a more &quot;ad hoc&quot; approach to arranging motor vehicles is appropriate. For example, in parts of some large cities, such as Chicago and Bangalore, where land is expensive and therefore parking space is at a premium, there are formal and informal parking lots for motor vehicles where the driver leaves the keys to the vehicle with an attendant who arranges vehicles so as to maximize the number of vehicles that can be parked in the lot. Vehicles may be packed up to five vehicles deep in combinations of perpendicular and/or parallel parking with limited circulation aisles for the parking attendant. Such arrangements are known as &quot;attendant parking&quot;. When the lot or facility is provided to serve the customers of a business, it is considered valet parking.

Inner city parking lots are often temporary, the operators renting land which is vacant pending the construction of a new office building. Some inner city lots are equipped with individual lifts, allowing cars to be stored above each other.

Another &quot;ad hoc&quot; arrangement is &quot;tandem parking&quot;. This is sometimes done with residential motor vehicle parking where two motor vehicles park nose-to-end in tandem. The first motor vehicle does not have independent access, and the second motor vehicle must move to provide access. As with attendant parking, the purpose is to maximize the number of motor vehicles that can park in a limited space. Formalised tandem parking will sometimes be sanctioned by local planning authorities for staff parking arrangements require additional parking in limited spaces.

==Marks and space size==

In parking lots (car parks in British English), parking is allowed only where marked.

In the US, minimum width standards of parking spaces usually range from . Angled and perpendicular spaces may need to be wide to allow doors to open, while parallel parking spots may be narrower on low-traffic neighborhood streets.

Because the boundary between the parking space and the driving area is not always well-defined, the length of a parking space is more difficult to establish. However, most angled and perpendicular spaces are considered to be between in length. In the United States, due to vehicles being larger on average than some other countries, a parking space deep is uncommon and most parking spaces will be within , with feet deep being the standard DOT recommended depth for standard perpendicular parking. Parallel parking spaces typically range from long.

During construction, the specific dimensions of a parking space are decided by a variety of factors. A high cost of land will encourage smaller dimensions and the introduction of compact spaces. Many garages and parking lots have spaces designated for a Compact car only. These spaces are narrower than traditional spaces, thus allowing more cars to park.

According to French standard &quot;Norme NF P 91-100&quot;, minimum width of parking spaces range from (See :fr:Marquage du stationnement en France). Narrow parking spaces such as in Vevey, Switzerland, might make opening the door difficult in a larger vehicle.

Larger cars are an issue when the size of the bay is fixed. Automobile associations warn of this issue. A Swiss Association regulating parking space wants to consider this issue for 2016. 

In the United Kingdom, the recommended standard parallel bay size is wide by long. Recently there has been some controversy about most UK parking spaces being too small to fit modern cars, which have grown significantly since standards were set decades ago. A new standard size of 2.6 meters wide (8.5 ft) and 5 meters long (16.4 ft) has been proposed.

In Australia, the dimensions are defined in AS2890 and are 2.4 m wide by 5.4 m long.

==Barriers==

Parking spaces commonly contain a parking chock (wheel stop), which is used to prevent cars from pulling too far into the space and

* obstructing a neighboring parking space, curb, or sidewalk.
* contacting with and then damaging a building wall.

This barrier is usually made of concrete and will normally be a horizontal bar to stop the tires from moving forward or a vertical bar that may cause damage to the vehicle if contact is made. In a parking garage, the barrier will often be a concrete wall.

==Parking spaces for the disabled==

Some parking spaces are reserved as disabled-accessible parking, for individuals with disabilities. Disabled parking spaces are typically marked with the International Symbol of Access, though in practice, the design of the symbol varies widely.

In the United States the Access Board provides guidelines on parking spaces.

== Women&#x27;s parking spaces ==
In some countries, women&#x27;s parking spaces have been established in more visible spots to reduce the chance of sexual attacks, facilitate parking for women, or to provide spaces that are closer to shopping centers or employment.

==US curb markings==
Curb markings in the United States are prescribed by the &quot;Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices&quot; (MUTCD). Local highway agencies may prescribe special colors for curb markings to supplement standard signs for parking regulation. California has designated an array of colors for curb regulations. A white curb designates passenger pick up or drop off. The green curb is for time limited parking. The yellow curb is for loading, and the blue curb is for disabled persons with proper vehicle identification. The red curb is for emergency vehicles only - fire lanes (no stopping, standing, or parking). In Oregon and Florida, the yellow curb is utilized to indicate no parking. In Georgia either red or yellow can be used to indicate no parking. In Seattle, Washington, alternating red and yellow curb markings indicate a bus stop.

<text>The Recovery Version is a modern English translation of the Bible from the original languages, published by Living Stream Ministry, ministry of Witness Lee and Watchman Nee. It is the commonly used translation of Local Churches (affiliation).

The New Testament was published in 1985 with study aids, and was revised in 1991. Text-only editions of the New Testament and of the complete Bible became available in 1993 and 1999, respectively. The full study Bible was published in 2003. The name was chosen to reflect the restorationist theology of the authors, who believe many of the doctrines in their translation (such as justification by faith alone) were lost by the church before being recovered later.

==Translation==

The Recovery Version is a recent translation of the Bible from the revised 1980 edition of the Hebrew Scriptures, &quot;Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia&quot;, and the Nestle-Åland Greek text as found in &quot;Novum Testamentum Graece&quot; (26th edition). The translators believe that the understanding of the Bible has progressed in the past two thousand years, in part due to &quot;philological and exegetical scholarship that makes more precise the meaning of the biblical words or phrases or practices&quot; and in part due to an accumulation of Christian experience. This understanding forms the basis of this translation, with guidance from major authoritative English versions.

The Recovery Version claims to avoid biases and inaccurate judgments and to express the message of the Bible in English as accurately as possible. As such, it departs from traditional renderings in certain passages. Its translation is essentially literal/word-for-word/formal equivalent, seeking to preserve the wording of the original Hebrew or Greek text and the personal style of each biblical writer. Its translation is intended as transparent; interpretive ambiguities present in the original text are left unresolved in this translation for the readers to consider. The Recovery Version renders the Tetragrammaton as &quot;Jehovah&quot; throughout the Old Testament.

==Study aids==
* A subject line at the beginning of each book summarizes its spiritual significance.
* A detailed outline precedes each book and is embedded throughout the text, providing an overview of the structure of the book.
* Footnotes stress the translators&#x27; view of revelation of the truth, the spiritual light, and the supply of life more than history, geography, and persons. The New Testament footnotes were written by Lee, while those of the Old Testament were compiled from his literary corpus by the editorial team. Footnotes also indicate more literal (but less readable) translations, valid alternative translations, alternative ways of reading the original text, and alternative translations found in other English versions or in academic scholarship. Often, the clarity forfeited in a literal translation of the original text is addressed and compensated for in the footnotes. The Recovery Version contains over 15,000 footnotes.
* Marginal cross references lead to other verses with the same expressions and facts and to other matters related to the spiritual revelation in the Word.
* Maps show the ancient Near East in Old Testament times, Israel in Old Testament times, and the Holy Land in New Testament times and document the journeys of Paul.
* Charts present the characteristics of the different sections of the New Testament and organize details such as the prophetic seventy weeks in Daniel, the rapture of the believers, and the coming of Christ, in a visual timeline.

==Textual comparison==
==Other languages==
There are complete and partial editions of the Holy Bible Recovery Version in other languages, including Chinese (恢復本), French (Version Recouvrement), German (Wiedererlangungs-Übersetzung), Polish (Przekład Odzyskiwania), Indonesian (Alkitab Versi Pemulihan), Japanese (回復訳), Korean (회복역), Portuguese (Versão Restauração), Russian (Восстановительный перевод), Spanish (Versión Recobro), Tagalog (Salin sa Pagbabawi), and Cebuano (Hubad Pahiuli). The Recovery Version New Testament is translated into Indian languages like Telugu, Tamil, Mizo and Malayalam; the Hindi translation is in progress. Translating into different languages requires translating from Greek to the language, and the footnotes from English to the desired language.

<text>Puerto Rico competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s fifteenth consecutive appearance at the Olympics.

Puerto Rico Olympic Committee sent the nation&#x27;s largest delegation to the Games since 1992 due to the presence of the men&#x27;s basketball team. A total of 43 athletes, 32 men and 11 women, had competed in 15 sports, roughly larger by two thirds of the nation&#x27;s team size from the previous Games. Five Puerto Rican athletes had previously competed in Sydney, including four-time Olympian and Tornado sailor Enrique Figueroa and freestyle swimmer and two-time Olympic finalist Ricardo Busquets. Men&#x27;s basketball was the only team-based sport in which Puerto Rico had its representation at these Games. Because of the nation&#x27;s emerging presence to the team sport, team captain and NBA&#x27;s Utah Jazz player Carlos Arroyo was appointed by the committee to carry the Puerto Rican flag in the opening ceremony. Puerto Rico also marked its Olympic debut in synchronized swimming and taekwondo.

Puerto Rico left Athens without receiving a single Olympic medal for the second consecutive time. Figueroa and his new partner Jorge Hernández achieved the nation&#x27;s highest placement at these Games after finishing seventh in the Tornado class. Meanwhile, Mabel Fonseca originally claimed the fifth position in women&#x27;s wrestling, but she committed an anti-doping violation, as she was tested positive for the steroid stanozolol. Despite not winning a medal, the men&#x27;s basketball team secured a notable victory against the United States. The Puerto Ricans&#x27; convincing 92-73 win against the three-time defending gold medalists was the United States team&#x27;s first Olympic loss since it began including NBA players in 1992, only its third Olympic loss overall, and as of 2021, its most lopsided Olympic loss ever.

==Athletics==

<doc id="913559" wikidata="Q526518" url="?curid=913559" title="Mihail Sadoveanu">
<text>Mihail Sadoveanu (; occasionally referred to as Mihai Sadoveanu; 5 November 1880 – 19 October 1961) was a Romanian novelist, short story writer, journalist and political figure, who twice served as acting head of state for the communist republic (1947–1948 and 1958). One of the most prolific Romanian-language writers, he is remembered mostly for his historical and adventure novels, as well as for his nature writing. An author whose career spanned five decades, Sadoveanu was an early associate of the traditionalist magazine &quot;Sămănătorul&quot;, before becoming known as a Realist writer and an adherent to the Poporanist current represented by &quot;Viața Românească&quot; journal. His books, critically acclaimed for their vision of age-old solitude and natural abundance, are generally set in the historical region of Moldavia, building on themes from Romania&#x27;s medieval and early modern history. Among them are &quot;Neamul Șoimăreștilor&quot; (&quot;The Șoimărești Family&quot;), &quot;Frații Jderi&quot; (&quot;The Jderi Brothers&quot;) and &quot;Zodia Cancerului&quot; (&quot;Under the Sign of the Crab&quot;). With &quot;Venea o moară pe Siret...&quot; (&quot;A Mill Was Floating down the Siret...&quot;), &quot;Baltagul&quot; (&quot;The Hatchet&quot;) and some other works of fiction, Sadoveanu extends his fresco to contemporary history and adapts his style to the psychological novel, Naturalism and Social realism.

A traditionalist figure whose perspective on life was a combination of nationalism and Humanism, Sadoveanu moved between right- and left-wing political forces throughout the interwar period, while serving terms in Parliament. Rallying with People&#x27;s Party, the National Agrarian Party, and the National Liberal Party-Brătianu, he was editor of the leftist newspapers &quot;Adevărul&quot; and &quot;Dimineața&quot;, and was the target of a violent far right press campaign. After World War II, Sadoveanu became a political associate of the Romanian Communist Party. He wrote in favor of the Soviet Union and Stalinism, joined the Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union and adopted Socialist realism. Many of his texts and speeches, including the political novel &quot;Mitrea Cocor&quot; and the famous slogan &quot;Lumina vine de la Răsărit&quot; (&quot;The Light Arises in the East&quot;), are also viewed as propaganda in favor of communization.

A founding member of the Romanian Writers&#x27; Society and later President of the Romanian Writers&#x27; Union, Sadoveanu was also a member of the Romanian Academy since 1921 and a recipient of the Lenin Peace Prize for 1961. He was also Grand Master of the Romanian Freemasonry during the 1930s. The father of Profira and Paul-Mihu Sadoveanu, who also pursued careers as writers, he was the brother-in-law of literary critic Izabela Sadoveanu-Evan.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Sadoveanu was born in Pașcani, in western Moldavia. His father&#x27;s family hailed from the southwestern part of the Old Kingdom, in Oltenia. Their place of origin, Sadova, provided their chosen surname (lit. &quot;from Sadova&quot;), which was adopted by the family only in 1891. Mihail&#x27;s father was the lawyer Alexandru Sadoveanu (d. 1921), whom literary critic George Călinescu described as &quot;a bearded and well-to-do man&quot;; according to the writer&#x27;s own notes, Alexandru was unhappy in marriage, and his progressive isolation from public life impacted on the entire family. Mihail&#x27;s mother, Profira née Ursachi (or Ursaki; d. 1895), hailed from a line of Moldavian shepherds, all of whom, as the writer recalled, had been illiterate. Literary historian Tudor Vianu believes this contrast of regional and social identities played a part in shaping the author, opening him up to a &quot;Romanian universality&quot;, but notes that, throughout his career, Sadoveanu was especially connected with his Moldavian roots. Mihail had a brother, also named Alexandru, whose wife was the Swiss-educated literary critic Izabela Morțun (later known as &quot;Sadoveanu-Evan&quot;, she was the cousin of socialist activist Vasile Morțun). Another one of his brothers, Vasile Sadoveanu, was an agricultural engineer.

Beginning in 1887, Sadoveanu attended primary school in Pașcani. His favorite teacher, a Mr. Busuioc, later served as inspiration for one of his best-known short stories, &quot;Domnu Trandafir&quot; (&quot;Master Trandafir&quot;). While away from school, young Sadoveanu used much of his spare time exploring his native region on foot, hunting, fishing, or just contemplating nature. He was also spending his vacations in his mother&#x27;s native Verșeni. During his journeys, Sadoveanu visited peasants, and his impression of the way in which they were relating to authority is credited by critics with having shaped his perspective on society. Shortly after this episode, the young Sadoveanu left to complete his secondary studies in Fălticeni and at the National High School in Iași. While in Fălticeni, he was in the same class as future authors Eugen Lovinescu and I. Dragoslav, but, having lost interest in schoolwork, he failed to get his remove, before eventually graduating top of his class.

===First literary attempts, marriage and family===

In 1896, when he was aged sixteen, Sadoveanu gave thought to writing a monograph on Moldavian Prince Stephen the Great, but his first literary attempts date from the following year. It was in 1897 that a sketch story, titled &quot;Domnișoara M din Fălticeni&quot; (&quot;Miss M from Fălticeni&quot;) and signed &quot;Mihai din Pașcani&quot; (&quot;Mihai from Pașcani&quot;), was successfully submitted for publishing to the Bucharest-based satirical magazine &quot;Dracu&quot;. He started writing for Ovid Densusianu&#x27;s journal &quot;Vieața Nouă&quot; in 1898. His contributions, featured alongside those of Gala Galaction, N. D. Cocea, and Tudor Arghezi, include another sketch story and a lyric poem. Sadoveanu was however dissatisfied with Densusianu&#x27;s agenda, and critical of the entire Romanian Symbolist movement for which the review spoke. He ultimately began writing pieces for non-Symbolist magazines such as &quot;Opinia&quot; and &quot;Pagini Literare&quot;. In parallel, he founded and printed by hand a short-lived journal, known to researches as either &quot;Aurora&quot; or &quot;Lumea&quot;.

Sadoveanu left for Bucharest in 1900, intending to study law at the University&#x27;s Faculty of Law, but withdrew soon after, deciding to dedicate himself to literature. He began frequenting the bohemian society in the capital, but, following a sudden change in outlook, abandoned poetry and focused his work entirely on Realist prose. In 1901, Sadoveanu married Ecaterina Bâlu, with whom he settled in Fălticeni, where he began work on his first novellas and decided to make his living as a professional writer. His first draft for a novel, &quot;Frații Potcoavă&quot; (&quot;The Potcoavă Brothers&quot;), came out in 1902, when fragments were published by &quot;Pagini Alese&quot; magazine under the pseudonym &quot;M. S. Cobuz&quot;. The following year, Sadoveanu was drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, stationed as a guard near Târgu Ocna, and inspired by the experience to write some of his first social criticism narratives.

After that time, he spent much of his home in the country, where he raised a large family. Initially, the Sadoveanus lived in a house previously owned by celebrated Moldavian raconteur Ion Creangă, before they commissioned a new building, famed for its surrounding &quot;Grădina Liniștii&quot; (&quot;Garden of Quietude&quot;). He was the father of eleven, among whom were three daughters: Despina, Teodora and Profira Sadoveanu, the latter of whom was a poet and a novelist. Of his sons, Dimitrie Sadoveanu became a painter, while Paul-Mihu, the youngest (born 1920), was author of the novel &quot;Ca floarea câmpului...&quot; (&quot;Like the Flower of the Field...&quot;) which was published posthumously.

===&quot;Sămănătorul&quot;, &quot;Viața Românească&quot; and literary debut===

After receiving an invitation from poet Ștefan Octavian Iosif in 1903, Sadoveanu contributed works to the traditionalist journal &quot;Sămănătorul&quot;, led at the time by historian and critic Nicolae Iorga. He was by then also a contributor to &quot;Voința Națională&quot;, a newspaper published by the National Liberal Party and managed by politician Vintilă Brătianu—beginning December of the same year, the paper serialized &quot;Șoimii&quot; (&quot;The Hawks&quot;), an extended variant of &quot;Frații Potcoavă&quot;, with an introduction by historian Vasile Pârvan. In 1904, he regained Bucharest, where he became a copyist for the Ministry of Education&#x27;s Board of Schools, returning to Fălticeni two years later. After 1906, he rallied with the group formed around &quot;Viața Românească&quot;, which was also joined by his sister-in-law Izabela.

&quot;Sămănătorul&quot; and &quot;Viața Românească&quot;, having comparable influence over the literature of Romania, stood for a traditionalist and ruralist approach to art, even though the latter adopted a more left-wing perspective, known as &quot;Poporanism&quot;. The leading Poporanist ideologue, Garabet Ibrăileanu, became a personal friend of the young writer after inviting him on an excursion down the Râșca River. With his subsequent pieces for &quot;Viața Românească&quot;, Sadoveanu became especially known as the raconteur of hunting trips, but also sparked controversy when a young woman writer, Constanța Marino-Moscu, accused him of having plagiarized her works in his &quot;Mariana Vidrașcu&quot;, a serialized novel which was discontinued and later largely forgotten.

1904 was Sadoveanu&#x27;s effective debut year: he published four separate books, including &quot;Șoimii&quot;, &quot;Povestiri&quot; (&quot;Stories&quot;), &quot;Dureri înăbușite&quot; (&quot;Suppressed Pains&quot;) and &quot;Crâșma lui Moș Petcu&quot; (&quot;Old Man Petcu&#x27;s Alehouse&quot;). The beginning of a prolific literary career covering more than a half century and of his collaboration with Editura Minerva publishing house, this debut was marked by intense preparation, and drew on literary exercises spanning the previous decade. His &quot;Sămănătorul&quot; colleague Iorga deemed 1904 &quot;Sadoveanu&#x27;s Year&quot;, while the influential and aging critic Titu Maiorescu, leader of the conservative literary society &quot;Junimea&quot;, gave a positive review to &quot;Povestiri&quot;, and successfully proposed it for a Romanian Academy award in 1906. In a 1908 essay, Maiorescu was to list Sadoveanu among Romania&#x27;s greatest writers. According to Vianu, Maiorescu saw in Sadoveanu and other young writers the triumph of his theory on a &quot;popular&quot; form of Realism, a vision which the &quot;Junimist&quot; thinker had advocated in his essays from as early as 1882. Sadoveanu later credited Iorga, Maiorescu, and especially so the cultural promoter Constantin Banu and &quot;Sămănătorul&quot; poet George Coșbuc, with having helped him capture the interest of the public and his peers. He was by then facing adversity from opponents of &quot;Sămănătorul&quot;, primarily critic Henric Sanielevici and his &quot;Curentul Nou&quot; review, which published claims that Sadoveanu&#x27;s volumes, which depicted immoral acts such as adultery and rape, showed that Iorga&#x27;s program of moral didacticism was hypocritical. As he latter recalled, Sadoveanu was himself upset with some of Iorga&#x27;s critical judgments regarding his own work, noting that the &quot;Sămănătorist&quot; doyen had once declared him equal to Vasile Pop (one of Iorga&#x27;s protegés, and viewed as overrated by Sadoveanu).

The same year, Sadoveanu became one of &quot;Sămănătorul&quot;″s editors, alongside Iorga and Iosif. The magazine, originally a traditionalist mouthpiece founded by Alexandru Vlahuță and George Coșbuc, proclaimed with Iorga its purpose of establishing &quot;a national culture&quot;, emancipated from foreign influence. However, according to Călinescu, this ambitious goal was only manifested in a &quot;great cultural influence&quot;, as the journal continued to be an eclectic venue which grouped together ruralist traditionalists of the &quot;national tendency&quot; and adherents to the cosmopolitan currents such as Symbolism. Călinescu and Vianu agree that &quot;Sămănătorul&quot; was, for a large part, a promoter of older guidelines set by &quot;Junimea&quot;. Vianu also argues that Sadoveanu&#x27;s contribution to the literary circle was the main original artistic element in its history, and credits Iosif with having accurately predicted that, during a period of literary &quot;crisis&quot;, Sadoveanu was the person to provide innovation.

He continued to publish at an impressive rate: in 1906, he again handed down for print four separate volumes. In parallel, Sadoveanu pursued his career as a civil servant. In 1905, he was employed as a clerk by the Ministry of Education, headed by the Conservative Party&#x27;s Mihail Vlădescu. His direct supervisor was poet D. Nanu, and he had for his colleagues the geographer George Vâlsan and the short story writer Nicolae N. Beldiceanu. Nanu wrote of this period: &quot;It is a clerical packed full with men of letters, no work is being done, people smoke, drink coffee, create dreams, poems and prose [...].&quot; Having interrupted his administrative service, Sadoveanu was again drafted into the Land Forces in 1906, being granted an officer&#x27;s rank. An already overweight man, he had to march from Probota in Central Moldavia to Bukovina, which caused him intense suffering.

===1910s and World War I===

Sadoveanu returned to his administrative job in 1907, the year of the Peasants&#x27; Revolt. Kept in office by the National Liberal cabinet of Ion I. C. Brătianu, he served under the reform-minded Education Minister Spiru Haret. Inspired by the bloody outcome of the Revolt, as well as by Haret&#x27;s moves to educate the peasantry, Sadoveanu reportedly drew suspicion from the Police when he published self-help guides aimed at industrious ploughmen, a brand of social activism which even resulted in a formal inquiry.

Mihail Sadoveanu became a professional writer in 1908–1909, after joining the Romanian Writers&#x27; Society, created in the previous year by poets Cincinat Pavelescu and Dimitrie Anghel, and becoming its president in September of that year. The same year, he, Iosif, and Anghel, together with author Emil Gârleanu, set up &quot;Cumpăna&quot;, a monthly directed against both Ovid Densusianu&#x27;s eclecticism and the &quot;Junimist&quot; school (the magazine was no longer in print by 1910). At the time, he became a noted presence among the group of intellectuals meeting in Bucharest&#x27;s Kübler Coffeehouse.

In 1910, he was also appointed head of the National Theater Iași, a position which he filled until 1919. That year, he translated from the French one of Hippolyte Taine&#x27;s studies on the genesis of artworks. He resigned his office within the Writers&#x27; Society in November 1911, being replaced by Gârleanu, but continued to partake in its administration as a member of its leadership committee and a censor. He was a leading presence at &quot;Minerva&quot; newspaper, alongside Anghel and critic Dumitru Karnabatt, and also published in the Transylvanian traditionalist journal, &quot;Luceafărul&quot;.

Sadoveanu was again called under arms during the Second Balkan War of 1913, when Romania confronted Bulgaria. Having reached the rank of Lieutenant, he was stationed in Fălticeni with the 16th Infantry Regiment, after which he spent a short period on the front. He returned to literary life. Becoming good friends with poet and humorist George Topîrceanu, he accompanied him and other writers on cultural tours during 1914 and 1915. The series of writings he published at the time includes the 1915 &quot;Neamul Șoimăreștilor&quot;.

In 1916–1917, as Romania entered World War I and was invaded by the Central Powers, Sadoveanu stayed in Moldavia, the only part of Romania&#x27;s territory still under the state&#x27;s authority (&quot;see Romanian Campaign&quot;). The writer oscillated between the Germanophilia of his &quot;Viața Românească&quot; friends, the stated belief that war was misery and the welcoming of Romania&#x27;s commitment to the Entente Powers. At the time, he was reelected President of the Writers&#x27; Society, a provisional mandate which ended in 1918, when Romania signed the peace with the Central Powers, and, as Army reservist, edited the Entente&#x27;s regional propaganda outlet, &quot;România&quot;. He was joined by Topîrceanu, who had just been released from a POW camp in Bulgaria, and with whom he founded the magazine &quot;Însemnări Literare&quot;. Sadoveanu subsequently settled in the Iași neighborhood of Copou, purchasing and redecorating the villa known locally as &quot;Casa cu turn&quot; (&quot;The House with a Tower&quot;). In the 19th century, it had been the residence of politician Mihail Kogălniceanu, and, during the war, hosted composer George Enescu. During that period, he collaborated with leftist intellectual Vasile Morțun and, together with him and Arthur Gorovei, founded and edited the magazine &quot;Răvașul Poporului&quot;.

===Creative maturity and early political career===

In 1921, Sadoveanu was elected a full member of the Romanian Academy; he gave his reception speech in front of the cultural forum two years later, structuring it as a praise of Romanian folklore in general and folkloric poetry in particular. At the time, he renewed his contacts with &quot;Viața Românească&quot;: with Garabet Ibrăileanu and several others, he joined its interwar nucleus, while the review often featured samples of his novels (some of which were originally published in full by its publishing venture). His house was by then host to many cultural figures, among whom were writers Topîrceanu, Gala Galaction, Otilia Cazimir, Ionel and Păstorel Teodoreanu, and Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu, as well as conductor Sergiu Celibidache. He was also close to a minor socialist poet and short story author, Ioan N. Roman, whose work he helped promote, to the aristocrat and memoirist Gheorghe Jurgea-Negrilești, and to a satirist named Radu Cosmin.

Despite his health problems, Sadoveanu frequently traveled throughout Romania, notably visiting local sights which inspired his work: the Romanian Orthodox monasteries of Agapia and Văratec, and the Neamț Fortress. After 1923, together with Topîrceanu, Demostene Botez and other &quot;Viața Românească&quot; affiliates, he also embarked on a series of hunting trips. He was charmed in particular by the sights he discovered during a 1927 visit to the Transylvanian area of Arieș. The same year, he also visited the Netherlands, which he reached by means of the Orient Express. His popularity continued to grow: in 1925, 1929 and 1930 respectively, he published his critically acclaimed novels &quot;Venea o moară pe Siret...&quot;, &quot;Zodia Cancerului&quot; and &quot;Baltagul&quot;, and his 50th anniversary was celebrated at a national level. In 1930, Sadoveanu, Topîrceanu and the schoolteacher T. C. Stan wrote and edited a series of primary school textbooks.

In 1926, after a period of indecision, Sadoveanu rallied with the People&#x27;s Party, where his friend, the poet Octavian Goga, was a prominent activist. He then rallied with Goga&#x27;s own National Agrarian Party. During the general election of 1927, he won a seat in the Chamber for Bihor County, in Transylvania, holding a seat in the Senate for Iași County after the 1931 suffrage. Under Nicolae Iorga&#x27;s National Peasants&#x27; Party cabinet of the period, Sadoveanu was President of the Senate. The choice was motivated by his status as &quot;a cultural personality&quot;. Around that date, he was affiliated with the National Liberal Party-Brătianu, a right-wing party inside the liberal current, who stood in opposition to the main National Liberal group. In parallel, he began contributing to the left-wing daily &quot;Adevărul&quot;.

Sadoveanu was by then affiliated with the Freemasonry, as first recorded by the organization in 1928, but was probably a member since 1926 or 1927. Reaching the 33rd degree within the organization and overseeing the Masonic Lodge &quot;Dimitrie Cantemir&quot; of Iași, he was elected Grand Master of the National Union of Lodges in 1932, thus replacing the vacating George Valentin Bibescu. There subsequently occurred a split between Bibescu and Sadoveanu&#x27;s supporters, aggravated by their publicized conflict with a third group, that of Ioan Pangal—splits which ended after some three years, when Sadoveanu marginalized both of his opponents, without however earning legitimate recognition from the &quot;Grand Orient de France&quot;. By 1934, he was recognized as Grand Master of the United Romanian Freemasonry, which regrouped all major local Lodges.

===Late 1930s and World War II===
He was publishing new works at a regular rate, culminating in the first volume of his historical epic &quot;Frații Jderi&quot;, which saw print in 1935. In 1936, the writer accepted the honorary chairmanship of &quot;Adevărul&quot; and its morning edition, &quot;Dimineața&quot;. During that time, he was involved in a public dispute with the far right and fascist press, replying to their attacks in several columns. Affiliates of the radical right organized public burnings of his volumes. The scandal prolonged itself over the following years, with Sadoveanu being supported by his friends in the literary community. Among them was Topîrceanu, who was at the time hospitalized, and whose expression of support was made shortly before his death to liver cancer. In September 1937, as a statement of solidarity and appreciation, the University of Iași conferred Sadoveanu the title of doctor &quot;honoris causa&quot;.

Mihail Sadoveanu withdrew from politics in the late 1930s and early 1940s, as Romania came to be led by successive right-wing dictatorships, he offered a measure of support to King Carol II and his National Renaissance Front, which attempted to block the more radically fascist Iron Guard from power. He was personally appointed a member of the reduced corporatist Senate by Carol. In 1940, the official establishment Editura Fundațiilor Regale published the first volume of his &quot;Opere&quot; (&quot;Works&quot;). Sadoveanu kept a low profile under the Iron Guard&#x27;s Nazi-allied National Legionary regime. After &quot;Conducător&quot; Ion Antonescu overthrew the Guard during the Legionary Rebellion and established his own fascist regime, the still-apolitical Sadoveanu was more present in public life, and lectured on cultural subjects for the Romanian Radio. After publishing the final section of his &quot;Frații Jderi&quot; in 1942, Sadoveanu again retreated to the countryside, in his beloved Arieș area, where he had built himself a chalet and a church; this seclusion produced his &quot;Povestirile de la Bradu-Strâmb&quot; (&quot;Bradu-Strâmb Stories&quot;). During those years, the sixty-year-old writer met Valeria Mitru, a much younger feminist journalist, whom he married after a brief courtship.

In August 1944, Romania&#x27;s King Michael Coup toppled Antonescu and switched sides in the war, rallying with the Allies. As a Soviet occupation began at home, Romanian troops fought alongside the Red Army on the European theater. Paul-Mihu Sadoveanu was killed in action in Transylvania on 22 September. During the same months, Sadoveanu was a candidate for the Writers&#x27; Society presidency, but, in what has been read as proof of a rivalry within the Freemasonry, was defeated by Victor Eftimiu. Later that year, the 40th anniversary of Mihail Sadoveanu&#x27;s debut was celebrated with a special ceremony at the academy and Tudor Vianu&#x27;s speech, offered as a retrospective of his colleague&#x27;s entire work.

===Communist system and political rise===

After the Soviet-backed advent of the Communist system in Romania, Sadoveanu supported the new authorities, and turned from his own version of Realism to officially-endorsed Socialist realism (&quot;see Socialist realism in Romania&quot;). This was also the start of his association with the Soviet-sponsored Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union (ARLUS), which was led by biologist and physician Constantin Ion Parhon. Having served as a host to official Soviet envoys Andrey Vyshinsky and Vladimir Kemenov during their late 1944 visits, he soon after became president of the ARLUS &quot;Literary and Philosophical Section&quot; (seconded by Mihai Ralea and Perpessicius). In February 1945, he joined Parhon, Enescu, linguist Alexandru Rosetti, composer George Enescu, biologist Traian Săvulescu and mathematician Dimitrie Pompeiu in a protest against the cultural policies of Premier Nicolae Rădescu and his cabinet, one in a series of moves to discredit the non-communist Rădescu and make him leave power. With Ion Pas, Gala Galaction, Horia Deleanu, Octav Livezeanu and N. D. Cocea, Sadoveanu edited the association&#x27;s weekly literary magazine &quot;Veac Nou&quot; after June 1946.

Sadoveanu&#x27;s literary and political change became known to the general public in March 1945, when he lectured about Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at a conference hall in Bucharest. Part of a conference cycle, his speech was famously titled &quot;Lumina vine de la Răsărit&quot;, which soon became synonymous with the attempts to improve the image of Stalinism in Romania. ARLUS would issue the text of his conference as a printed volume later in the year. Also in 1945, Sadoveanu journeyed to the Soviet Union together with some of his fellow ARLUS members—among them biologists Parhon and Săvulescu, sociologist Dimitrie Gusti, linguist Iorgu Iordan, and mathematician Simion Stoilow. Invited by the Soviet Academy of Sciences to attend the 220th anniversary of its foundation, they also visited research institutes, &quot;kolhozy&quot;, and day care centers, notably meeting with Nikolay Tsitsin, an agronomist favored by Stalin. After his return, he wrote other controversial texts and gave lectures which offered ample praise to the Soviet system. That year, the ARLUS enterprise Editura Cartea Rusă also published his translation of Ivan Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;A Sportsman&#x27;s Sketches&quot;.

During the rigged election of that year, Sadoveanu was a candidate for the Communist party-organized Bloc of Democratic Parties (BPD) in Bucharest, winning a seat in the newly unified Parliament of Romania. In its first-ever session (December 1946), the legislative body elected him its president. He was at the time residing in Ciorogârla, having been awarded a villa previously owned by Pamfil Șeicaru, a journalist whose support for fascist regimes had made him undesirable, and who had moved out of Romania. The decision was viewed as evidence of political corruption by the opposition National Peasants&#x27; Party, whose press deemed Sadoveanu the &quot;Count of Ciorogârla&quot;.

In 1948, after Romania&#x27;s King Michael I was overthrown by the BPD-member parties and the communist regime officially established, Sadoveanu rose to the highest positions ever granted to a Romanian writer, and received significant material benefits. In 1947–1948, he was, alongside Parhon, Ștefan Voitec, Gheorghe Stere, and Ion Niculi, a member of the Presidium of the People&#x27;s Republic, which was elected by the BPD-dominated legislative. He also kept his seat at the academy, which at the time was undergoing a communist-led purge, and, with several other pro-Soviet intellectuals, was voted in the Academy Presidium.

===Final years, illness and death===

After the Writers&#x27; Society was restructured as the Romanian Writers&#x27; Union in 1949, Sadoveanu became its Honorary President. In 1950, he was named President of the Writers&#x27; Union, replacing Zaharia Stancu. According to writer Valeriu Râpeanu, this last appointment was a sign of Stancu&#x27;s marginalization after he had been excluded from the Romanian Communist Party, while the Writers&#x27; Union was actually controlled by its First Secretary, the communist poet Mihai Beniuc. Sadoveanu and Beniuc were reelected at the Union&#x27;s first Congress (1956). In the meanwhile, Sadoveanu published several Socialist realist volumes, among which was &quot;Mitrea Cocor&quot;, a controversial praise of collectivization policies. First published in 1949, it earned Sadoveanu the first-ever State Prize for Prose.

Throughout the period, Sadoveanu was involved in major communist-endorsed cultural campaigns. Thus, in June 1952, he presided over the academy&#x27;s Scientific Council, charged with modifying the Romanian alphabet, at the end of which the letter &quot;â&quot; was discarded, and replaced everywhere with &quot;î&quot; (a spelling Sadoveanu is alleged to have already shown preference for in his early works). In March 1953, soon after Stalin&#x27;s death, he led discussions within the Writers&#x27; Union, confronting his fellow writers with the new Soviet cultural directives as listed by Georgy Malenkov, and reacting against young authors who had not discarded the since-condemned doctrines of proletkult. The author was also becoming involved in the Eastern Bloc&#x27;s peace movement, and led the National Committee for the Defense of Peace at a time when the Soviet Union was seeking to portray its Cold War enemies as warmongers and the sole agents of nuclear proliferation. He also represented Romania to the World Peace Council, and received its International Peace Prize for 1951. As a parliamentarian, Sadoveanu stood on the committee charged with elaborating the new republican constitution, which, in its final form, reflected both Soviet influence and the assimilation of Stalinism into Romanian political discourse. In November 1955, shortly after turning 75, he was granted the title of &quot;Hero of Socialist Labor&quot;. After 1956, when the regime announced that it had embarked on a limited version of De-Stalinization, it continued to recommend Mihail Sadoveanu as one of its prime cultural models.

Having donated &quot;Casa cu turn&quot; to the state in 1950, he moved back to Bucharest, where he owned a house near the Zambaccian Museum. From 7 to 11 January 1958, Sadoveanu, Ion Gheorghe Maurer and Anton Moisescu were acting Chairmen of the Presidium of the Great National Assembly, which again propelled him to a position as titular head of state. His literary stature but also his political allegiance earned him the Soviet Lenin Peace Prize, which he received shortly before his death.

After a long illness marked by a stroke which impaired his speech and left him almost completely blind, Sadoveanu was cared for by a staff of physicians supervised by Nicolae Gh. Lupu and reporting to the Great National Assembly. The Sadoveanus withdrew to Neamț region, where they lived in a villa assigned to them by the state and located near the Voividenia hermitage and the locality of Vânători-Neamț, being visited regularly by literary and political friends, among them Alexandru Rosetti. Mihail Sadoveanu died there at 9 AM on 19 October 1961, and was buried at Bellu cemetery, in Bucharest. His successor as President of the Writers&#x27; Union was Beniuc, elected during the Congress of January 1962.

Following her husband&#x27;s death, Valeria Sadoveanu settled in proximity to the Văratec Monastery, where she set up an informal literary circle and Orthodox prayer group, notably attended by literary historian Zoe Dumitrescu-Bușulenga and by poet Ștefana Velisar, and dedicated herself to protecting the community of nuns. She survived Mihail Sadoveanu by over 30 years.

==Literary contributions==

===Context===
Often seen as the leading author of his generation, and generally viewed as one of the most representative Romanian writers, Mihail Sadoveanu was also believed to be a first-class story-teller, and received praise especially for his nature writing and his depictions of rural landscapes. An exceptionally prolific author by Romanian standards, he published over a hundred individual volumes (120 according to the American magazine &quot;Time&quot;). His contemporaries tended to place Sadoveanu alongside Liviu Rebreanu and Cezar Petrescu—for all the differences in style between the three figures, the interwar public saw them as the &quot;great novelists&quot; of the day. Critic Ovid Crohmălniceanu describes their activity, altogether focused on depicting the rural world but diverging in bias, as one sign that the Romanian interwar itself was exceptionally effervescent, while Romanian-born American historian of literature Marcel Cornis-Pope sees Sadoveanu and Rebreanu as their country&#x27;s &quot;two most important novelists of the first half of the twentieth century&quot;. In 1944, Tudor Vianu spoke of Sadoveanu as &quot;the most significant writer Romanians [presently] have, the first among his equals.&quot;

While underlining his originality in the context of Romanian literature and among the writers standing for &quot;the national tendency&quot; (as opposed to the more cosmopolitan modernists), George Călinescu also noted that, through several of his stories and novels, Sadoveanu echoed the style of his predecessors and contemporaries Ion Luca Caragiale, Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești, Emil Gârleanu, Demostene Botez, Otilia Cazimir, Calistrat Hogaș, I. A. Bassarabescu and Ionel Teodoreanu. Also included among the &quot;national tendency&quot; writers, Gârleanu was for long seen as Sadoveanu&#x27;s counterpart, and even, Călinescu writes, &quot;undeservedly upstaged&quot; him. Cornis-Pope also writes that Sadoveanu&#x27;s epic is a continuation of &quot;the national narrative&quot; explored earlier by Nicolae Filimon, Ioan Slavici and Duiliu Zamfirescu, while literary historians Vianu and Z. Ornea note that Sadoveanu also took inspiration from the themes and genres explored by &quot;Junimist&quot; author Nicolae Gane. In his youth, Sadoveanu also admired and collected the works of N. D. Popescu-Popnedea, a prolific and successful author of almanacs, historical novels and adventure novels. Later, his approach to Realism was also inspired by his reading of Gustave Flaubert and especially Nikolai Gogol. Both Sadoveanu and Gane were also indirectly influenced by Wilhelm von Kotzebue, the 19th century Imperial Russian diplomat and author of the Romanian-themed story &quot;Laskar Vioresku&quot;.

In Vianu&#x27;s assessment, Sadoveanu&#x27;s work signified an artistic revolution within the local Realist school, comparable to the adoption of perspective by the visual artists of the Renaissance. Mihail Sadoveanu&#x27;s interest in the rural world and his views on tradition were subjects of debate among the modernists. The modernist doyen Eugen Lovinescu, who envisaged an urban literature in tune with European tendencies, was one of Sadoveanu&#x27;s most notorious critics. However, Sadoveanu was well received by Lovinescu&#x27;s adversaries within the modernist camp: Perpessicius and &quot;Contimporanul&quot; editor Ion Vinea, the latter of whom, in search for literary authenticity, believed in bridging the gap between the avant-garde and folk culture. This opinion was shared by Swedish literary historian Tom Sandqvist, who sees Sadoveanu&#x27;s main point of contact with modernism was his interest in the pagan elements and occasional absurdist streaks of local folklore. In the larger dispute about national specificity, and partly in response to Vinea&#x27;s claim, modernist poet and essayist Benjamin Fondane argued that, as a sign Romanian culture was tributary to those it had come into contact with, &quot;Sadoveanu&#x27;s soul can be easily reduced to the Slavic soul&quot;.

===Characteristics===
Sadoveanu&#x27;s personality and experience played a major part in shaping his literary style. After his 1901 marriage, Mihail Sadoveanu adopted what Călinescu deemed &quot;patriarchal&quot; lifestyle. The literary historian noted that he took a personal interest in educating his many children, and that this also implied &quot;making use of a whip&quot;. An Epicurean, the writer was a homemaker, an avid hunter and fisherman, and a chess aficionado. Recognized, like his epigramist colleague Păstorel Teodoreanu, as a man of refined culinary tastes, Sadoveanu cherished Romanian cuisine and Romanian wine. The lifestyle choices were akin to his literary interests: alongside the secluded and rudimentary existence of his main characters (connected by Călinescu with the writer&#x27;s supposed longing for &quot;regressions to the patriarchal times&quot;), Sadoveanu&#x27;s work is noted for its imagery of primitive abundance, and in particular for its lavish depictions of ritualistic feasts, hunting parties and fishing trips.

Călinescu opined that the value of such descriptions within individual narratives grew with time, and that the author, once he had discarded lyricism, used them as &quot;a means for the senses to enjoy the fleshes and the forms that nature offers man.&quot; He added that Sadoveanu&#x27;s aesthetics could be said to recall the art of the Golden Age in Holland: &quot;One could almost say that Sadoveanu rebuilds in present day Moldavia [...] the Holland of wine jugs and kitchen tables covered in venison and fish.&quot; Vianu also argued that Sadoveanu never abandoned himself to purely aesthetic descriptions, and that, although often depicted with Impressionistic means, nature is assigned a specific if discreet role within the plot lines, or serves to render a structure. The traditionalist Garabet Ibrăileanu, referring to Sadoveanu&#x27;s poetic nature writing, even declared it to have &quot;surpassed nature.&quot; At the other end, the modernist Eugen Lovinescu specifically objected to Sadoveanu&#x27;s depiction of a primordial landscape, arguing that, despite adopting Realism, his rival was indebted to Romanticism and subjectivity. Lovinescu&#x27;s attitude, critic Ion Simuț notes, was partly justified by the fact that Sadoveanu never truly parted with the traditionalism of &quot;Sămănătorul&quot;. In 1962, &quot;Time&quot; also commented that his style was &quot;curiously dated&quot; and recalled not Sadoveanu&#x27;s generation, but that of Leo Tolstoy and Ivan Turgenev, &quot;although he has nothing like the power or skill of any of them.&quot; For Călinescu and Vianu too, Sadoveanu is a creator with seemingly Romantic tastes, which recall those of François-René de Chateaubriand. Unlike Lovinescu, Vianu saw these traits as &quot;not at all detrimental to the balance of [Sadoveanu&#x27;s] art.&quot;

Seen by literary critic Ioan Stanomir as marked by &quot;volubility&quot;, and thus contrasting with his famously taciturn and seemingly embittered nature, the form of Romanian used by Mihail Sadoveanu, particularly in his historical novels, was noted for both its use of archaisms and the inventive approach to the Romanian lexis. Often borrowing plot lines and means of expression from medieval and early modern Moldavian chroniclers such as Ion Neculce and Miron Costin, the author creatively intercalates several local dialects and registers of speech, moving away from a mere imitation of the historical language. Generally third-person narratives, his books often make little or no dialectal difference between the speech used by the story-teller and the character&#x27;s voices. According to Călinescu, Sadoveanu displays &quot;an enormous capacity of authentic speech&quot;, similar to that of Caragiale and Ion Creangă. The writer himself recorded his fascination with the &quot;eloquence&quot; of rudimentary orality, and in particular with the speech of &quot;Rudari&quot; Roma he encountered during his travels. Building on observations made by several critics, who generally praised the poetic qualities of Sadoveanu&#x27;s prose, Crohmălniceanu spoke in detail about the Moldavian novelist&#x27;s role in reshaping the literary language. This particular contribution was first described early in the 20th century, when Sadoveanu was acclaimed by Titu Maiorescu for having adapted his writing style to the social environment and the circumstances of his narratives. Vianu however notes that Sadoveanu&#x27;s late writings tend to leave more room for neologisms, mostly present in those parts where the narrator&#x27;s voice takes distance from the plot.

Another unifying element in Sadoveanu&#x27;s creation is his recourse to literary types. As early as 1904, Maiorescu praised the young raconteur for accurately depicting characters in everyday life and settings. Tudor Vianu stressed that, unlike most of his Realist predecessors, Sadoveanu introduced an overtly sympathetic view of the peasant character, as &quot;a higher type of human, a heroic human&quot;. He added: &quot;Simple, in the sense that they are moved by a few devices [which] coincide with the fundamental instincts of mankind, [they] are, in general, mysterious.&quot; In this line, Sadoveanu also creates images of folk sages, whose views on life are of a Humanist nature, and often depicted in contrast with the rationalist tenets of Western culture. Commenting on this aspect, Sadoveanu&#x27;s friend George Topîrceanu believed that Sadoveanu&#x27;s work transcended the &quot;more intellectual [and] more artificial&quot; notion of &quot;types&quot;, and that &quot;he creates [...] humans.&quot; The main topic of his subsequent work, Sandqvist argues, was &quot;an archaic world where the farmers and the landlords were free men with equal rights&quot; (or, according to Simuț, &quot;a utopia of archaic heroism&quot;).

Thus, Călinescu stresses, Sadoveanu&#x27;s work seems to be the monolithic creation through which &quot;a single man&quot; reflects &quot;a single, universal nature, inhabited by a single type of man&quot;, and which echoes a similar vision of archaic completeness as found in the literature of poet Mihai Eminescu. The similarity in vision with Eminescu&#x27;s &quot;nostalgia, return, protest, demand, aspiration toward a [rural] world [he has] left&quot; was also proposed by Vianu, while Topîrceanu spoke of &quot;the paradoxical discovery that [Sadoveanu] is our greatest poet since Eminescu.&quot; Mihail Sadoveanu also shaped his traditionalist views on literature by investigating Romanian folklore, which he recommended as a source of inspiration to his fellow writers during his 1923 speech at the Romanian Academy. In Călinescu&#x27;s view, Sadoveanu&#x27;s outlook on life was even mirrored in his physical aspect, his &quot;large body, voluminous head, his measured shepherd-like gestures, his affluent but prudent and monologic speech [and] feral indifference; his eyes [...] of an unknown race.&quot; His assessment of the writer as an archaic figure, bluntly stated in a 1930 article (&quot;I believe him to be very uncultured&quot;), was contrasted by other literary historians: Alexandru Paleologu described Sadoveanu as a prominent intellectual figure, while his own private notes show that he was well-read and acquainted with the literatures of many countries. Often seen as a spontaneous writer, Sadoveanu nevertheless took pains to elaborate his plots and research historical context, keeping most records of his investigations confined to his diaries.

===Debut===
The writer&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Povestiri&quot;, was celebrated for its accomplished style, featuring early drafts of all themes he developed upon later in life. However, Călinescu argued, some of the stories in the volume were still &quot;awkward&quot;, and showed that Sadoveanu had problems in outlining epics. The pieces mainly feature episodes in the lives of boyars (members of Moldavia&#x27;s medieval aristocracy), showing the ways in which they relate to each other, to their servants, and to their country. In one of the stories, titled &quot;Cântecul de dragoste&quot; (&quot;The Love Song&quot;), Sadoveanu touches on the issue of slavery, depicting the death of a Rom slave who is killed by his jealous master, while in &quot;Răzbunarea lui Nour&quot; (&quot;Nour&#x27;s Revenge&quot;), a boyar refuses to make his peace with God until his son&#x27;s death is avenged. Other fragments deal solely with the isolated existence of villagers: for example, in &quot;Într-un sat odată&quot; (&quot;Once, in a Village&quot;), a mysterious man dies in a Moldavian hamlet, and the locals, unable to discover his identity, sell his horse. The prose piece &quot;Năluca&quot; (&quot;The Apparition&quot;) centers on the conjugal conflict between two old people, both of whom attempt to hide the shame of their past. George Călinescu notes that, particularly in &quot;Năluca&quot;, Sadoveanu begins to explore the staple technique of his literary contributions, which involves &quot;suggesting the smolder of passions [through] a contemplative breath in which he evokes a static element: landscapes or set pieces from nature.&quot;

Sadoveanu&#x27;s subsequent collection of short stories, &quot;Dureri înăbușite&quot;, builds on the latter technique and takes his work into the realm of social realism and naturalism (believed by Călinescu to have been borrowed from either the French writer Émile Zola or from the Romanian Alexandru Vlahuță). For Călinescu, this choice of style brought &quot;damaging effects&quot; on Sadoveanu&#x27;s writings, and made &quot;Dureri înăbușite&quot; &quot;perhaps the poorest&quot; of his collections of stories. In Lovinescu&#x27;s view, Sadoveanu&#x27;s move toward naturalism did not imply the necessary recourse to objectivity. The pieces focus on dramatic moments of individual existences. In &quot;Lupul&quot; (&quot;The Wolf&quot;), an animal is chased and trapped by a group of peasants; the eponymous character in &quot;Ion Ursu&quot; leaves his village to become a proletarian, and succumbs to alcoholism; the indentured laborer in &quot;Sluga&quot; (&quot;The Servant&quot;) is unable to take revenge on his cruel employer at the right moment; in &quot;Doi feciori&quot; (&quot;Two Sons&quot;), a boyar comes to feel affection for his illegitimate son, whom he has nonetheless reduced to a lowly condition.

In 1905, Sadoveanu also published &quot;Povestiri din război&quot; (&quot;Stories from the War&quot;), which compose scenes from the lives of Romanian soldiers fighting in the War of 1878. Objecting to a series of exaggerations in the book, &quot;Time&quot; nevertheless noted that Sadoveanu &quot;sometimes had the writing skill to make compelling even quite traditional reactions to old-fashioned war&quot;. It concluded: &quot;Sadoveanu&#x27;s sketches have the virtues—and the vices—of old hunting prints and the romantically mannered battle scenes of the 19th century.&quot;

===Early selections of major themes===

Sadoveanu renounces this grim perspective on life in his volume &quot;Crâșma lui Moș Petcu&quot;, where he returns to a depiction of rural life as unchanged by outside factors. Petcu&#x27;s establishment, located on the Moldova Valley, is a serene place, visited by quiet and subdued customers, whose occasional outburst of violence are, according to Călinescu, &quot;dominated by slow, stereotypical mechanics, as is with people who can only accommodate within them a single drama.&quot; The literary critic celebrated &quot;Crâșma lui Moș Petcu&quot; for its depictions of nature, whose purpose is to evoke &quot;the indifferent eternity&quot; of conflicts between the protagonists, and who, at times, relies &quot;on a vast richness of sounds and words.&quot; He did however reproach the writer &quot;a certain monotony&quot;, arguing that Sadoveanu came to use such techniques in virtually all his later works.

However, Sadoveanu&#x27;s stories of the period often returned to a naturalistic perspective, particularly in a series of sketch stories and novellas which portray the modest lives of Romanian Railways employees, of young men drafted into the Romanian Land Forces, of Bovaryist women who playfully seduce adolescents, or of the provincial &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot;. At times, they confront the morals of barely literate people with the stern authorities: a peasant obstinately believes that the 1859 union between Wallachia and Moldavia was meant to ensure the supremacy of his class; a young lower-class woman becomes the love interest of a boyar but chooses a life of freedom; and a Rom deserts from the Army after being told to bathe. In &quot;La noi, la Viișoara&quot; (&quot;At Our Place in Viișoara&quot;), the life of an old man degenerates into bigotry and avarice, to the point where he makes his wife starve to death. Sadoveanu&#x27;s positive portrayal of &quot;hajduks&quot; as fundamentally honest outlaws standing up to feudal injustice, replicates stereotypes found in Romanian folklore, and is mostly present in some of the stories through (sometimes recurrent) heroic characters: Vasile the Great, Cozma Răcoare, Liță Florea etc. In the piece titled &quot;Bordeenii&quot; (roughly, &quot;The Mud-hut Dwellers&quot;), he shows eccentrics and misanthropes presided upon by the dark figure of Sandu Faliboga, brigands who flee all public authority and whom commentators have likened to settlers of the Americas. Lepădatu, an unwanted child, speaks for the entire group: &quot;What could I do [...] wherever there are big fairs and lots of people? I&#x27;d have a better time with the cattle; it is with them that I have grown up and with them that I get along.&quot; Romanticizing the obscure events of early medieval history in &quot;Vremuri de bejenie&quot; (&quot;Roving Times&quot;, 1907), Sadoveanu sketches the improvised self-defense of a refugee community, their last stand against nomadic Tatars.

In reference to the stories in this series, Călinescu stresses that Sadoveanu&#x27;s main interest is in depicting men and women cut away from civilization, who view the elements of Westernization with nothing more than &quot;wonderment&quot;: &quot;Sadoveanu&#x27;s literature is the highest expression of the savage instinct.&quot; In later works, the critic believed, Sadoveanu moved away from depicting isolation as the escape of primitives into their manageable world, but as &quot;the refinement of souls whom civilization has upset.&quot; These views are echoed by Ovid Crohmălniceanu, who believes that, unlike other Romanian Realists, Sadoveanu was able to show a peasant society that was not merely the prey of modern corruption or historical oppression, but rather refusing all contacts with the wider world—even to the point of Luddite-like hostility in front of new objects. Some of the early stories, Crohmălniceanu argues, do follow the moralizing &quot;Sămănătorist&quot; pattern, but part with it when they refuse to present the countryside in &quot;idyllic&quot; fashion, or when they adopt a specific &quot;mythical realism&quot;.

Sadoveanu began his career as a novelist with more in-depth explorations into subjects present in his stories and novellas. At the time, Crohmălniceanu stresses, he was being influenced by the naturalism of Caragiale (minus the comedic effect), and by his own experience growing up in characteristically underdeveloped Moldavian cities and &quot;târguri&quot; (somewhat similar to the aesthetic of boredom, adopted in poetry by George Bacovia, Demostene Botez or Benjamin Fondane). Among his first works of the kind is &quot;Floare ofilită&quot; (&quot;Wizened Flower&quot;), where a simple girl, Tincuța, marries a provincial civil servant, and finds herself deeply unhappy and unable to enrich her life on any level. Tincuța, seen by Călinescu as one of Sadoveanu&#x27;s &quot;savage&quot; characters, only maintains urban refinement when persuading her husband to return for supper, but, according to Crohmălniceanu, is also a credible witness to the &quot;small-mindedness&quot; of &quot;bourgeois&quot; environments. A rather similar plot is built for &quot;Însemnările lui Neculai Manea&quot; (&quot;The Recordings of Neculai Manea&quot;), where the eponymous character, an educated peasant, experiences two unhappy romantic affairs before successfully courting a married woman who, although grossly uncultured, makes him happy. &quot;Apa morților&quot; (&quot;The Dead Men&#x27;s Water&quot;) is about a Bovaryist woman who discards lovers over imprecise feelings of dissatisfaction, finding refuge in the monotonous countryside. Călinescu noted that such novels were &quot;usually less valuable than direct accounts&quot;, and deemed &quot;Însemnările lui Neculai Manea&quot; &quot;without literary interest&quot;; in Ovid Crohmălniceanu&#x27;s view, the same story presents relevant detail on professional and intellectual failure.

Praised by its commentators, the short novel &quot;Haia Sanis&quot; (1908) shows the eponymous character, a Jewish woman who throws herself into the arms of a local Gentile, although she knows him to be a seducer. Călinescu, who wrote with admiration about how the subject dissimulated pathos into &quot;technical indifference&quot;, notes that the erotic rage motivating Haia has drawn &quot;well justified&quot; comparisons with Jean Racine&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Phèdre&quot;. Crohmălniceanu believes &quot;Haia Sanis&quot; to be &quot;perhaps [Sadoveanu&#x27;s] best novella&quot;, particularly since the &quot;wild beauty&quot; Haia has to overcome at once antisemitism, endogamy and shame, before dying &quot;in terrible pain&quot; during a botched abortion. Sadoveanu&#x27;s work of the time also includes &quot;Balta liniștii&quot; (&quot;Tranquillity Pond&quot;), where Alexandrina, pushed into an arranged marriage, has a belated and sad revelation of true love. In other sketch stories, such as &quot;O zi ca altele&quot; (&quot;A Day like Any Other&quot;) or &quot;Câinele&quot; (&quot;The Dog&quot;), Sadoveanu follows Caragiale&#x27;s close study of suburban banality.

===&quot;Hanu Ancuței&quot;, &quot;Șoimii&quot; and &quot;Neamul Șoimăreștilor&quot;===

The novella &quot;Hanu Ancuței&quot; (&quot;Ancuța&#x27;s Inn&quot;), described by George Călinescu as a &quot;masterpiece of the jovial idyllicism and barbarian subtlety&quot;, and by Z. Ornea as the first evidence of Sadoveanu&#x27;s &quot;new age&quot;, is a frame story in the line of medieval allegories such as Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; and Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot;. It retells the stories of travelers meeting in the eponymous inn. Much of the story deals with statements of culinary tastes and shared recipes, as well as with the overall contrast between civilization and rudimentary ways: in one episode of the book, a merchant arriving from the Leipzig Trade Fair bemuses the other protagonists when he explains the more frugal ways and the technical innovations of Western Europe. Sadoveanu applied the same narrative technique in his &quot;Soarele în baltă&quot; (&quot;The Sun in the Waterhole&quot;), which, Călinescu argues, displays &quot;a trickier style.&quot;

In &quot;Șoimii&quot;, Sadoveanu&#x27;s first historical novel, the main character is Nicoară Potcoavă, a late 16th-century Moldavian nobleman who became Hetman of the Zaporozhian Cossacks and Prince of Moldavia. The narrative, whose basic lines had been drawn by Sadoveanu in his adolescent years, focuses on early events in Nicoară&#x27;s life, building on the story according to which he and his brother Alexandru were the brothers of Prince Ioan Vodă cel Cumplit, whose execution by the Ottomans they tried to avenge. The text also follows their attempt to seize and kill Ieremia Golia, a boyar whose alleged betrayal had led to Prince Ioan&#x27;s capture, and whose daughter Ilinca becomes the brothers&#x27; prisoner. This story as well features several episodes where the focus is on depicting customary feasts, as well as a fragment where the Potcoavăs and their Zaporozhian Cossack allies engage in binge drinking. Glossing over several years in Nicoară&#x27;s life, and culminating in his seizure of the throne, the narrative shows his victory against pretender Petru Șchiopul and Golia, and the price he has to pay for his rise. Alexandru, who falls in love with Ilinca, unsuccessfully asks for the captured Golia not to be killed. Following the murder, both brothers become embittered and renounce power. Călinescu described &quot;Șoimii&quot; novel as &quot;still awkward&quot;, noting that Sadoveanu was only beginning to experiment with the genre.
The 1915 &quot;Neamul Șoimăreștilor&quot; is a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot; centered on the coming of age of one Tudor Șoimaru. The protagonist, born a free peasant in Orhei area, fights alongside Ștefan Tomșa in the 1612 battles to capture the Moldavian throne. After participating in the capture of Iași, he returns home and helps local boyar Stroie in recovering his daughter, Magda, who had been kidnapped by Cossacks. Șoimaru, who feels for Magda, is however enraged by news that her father has forced his community into serfdom. Trying to deal with his internal conflict, he travels into Poland–Lithuania, where he discovers that Stroie is plotting against Tomșa, while Magda, who is in love with a &quot;szlachta&quot; nobleman, scorns his affection. He returns a second time to Orhei, marries into his social group, and plots revenge on Stroie by again rallying with Ștefan Tomșa. Following Tomșa&#x27;s defeat, he again loses the lands of his ancestors, as Stroie returns home to celebrate his victory and have the Șoimarus put to death. Unexpectedly warned of this by Magda, Tudor manages to turn the tide: he and his family destroy Stroie&#x27;s manor, killing the master but allowing Magda to escape unharmed. In Călinescu&#x27;s view, the novel is &quot;somewhat more consistent from an epic perspective&quot;, but fails to respect the conventions of the adventure novel it sets out to replicate. The critic, who deemed Magda&#x27;s courtship by Tudor &quot;sentimental&quot;, argued that the book lacks &quot;the richness and unpredictable nature of the love intrigue&quot;; he also objected to the depiction of Tudor as indecisive and inadequate for a heroic role. However, Ovid Crohmălniceanu argued that the suddenness of Tudor&#x27;s sentimental commitments was characteristic for the &quot;peasant soul&quot; as observed by Sadoveanu.

===&quot;Zodia Cancerului&quot; and &quot;Nunta Domniței Ruxandra&quot;===
&quot;Zodia Cancerului&quot;, Sadoveanu&#x27;s later historical novel, is set late in the 17th century, during the third rule of Moldavian Prince Gheorghe Duca, and is seen by Călinescu as &quot;of a superior artistic level.&quot; The plot centers on a conflict between Duca and the Ruset boyars: the young Alecu Ruset, son of the deposed Prince Antonie, is spared persecution on account of his good relations with the Ottomans, but has to live under close watch. Himself a tormented, if cultured and refined, man, Alecu falls in love with Duca&#x27;s daughter Catrina, whom he attempts to kidnap. The episode, set to coincide with the start of a major social crisis, ends with Alecu&#x27;s defeat and killing on Duca&#x27;s orders.

In the background, the story depicts the visit of an &quot;Abbé&quot; de Marenne, a Roman Catholic priest and French envoy, who meets and befriends Ruset. Their encounter is another opportunity for Sadoveanu to show the amiable but incomplete exchange between the mentalities of Western and Eastern Europe. In various episodes of the novel, de Marenne shows himself perplexed by the omnipresent wilderness of underpopulated Moldavia, and in particular by the abundance of resources this provides. In one paragraph, seen by George Călinescu as a key to the book, Sadoveanu writes: &quot;[De Marenne&#x27;s] curious eye was permanently satisfied. Here was a desolation of solitudes, one that his friends in France could not even guess existed, no matter how much imagination they had been gifted with; for at the antipode of civilization one occasionally finds such things that have remained unchanged from the onset of creation, preserving their mysterious beauty.&quot;

In a shorter novel of the period, Sadoveanu explored the late years of Vasile Lupu&#x27;s rule over Moldavia, centering on the marriage of Cossack leader Tymofiy Khmelnytsky and Lupu&#x27;s daughter, Ruxandra. Titled &quot;Nunta Domniței Ruxandra&quot; (&quot;Princess Ruxandra&#x27;s Wedding&quot;), it shows the Cossacks&#x27; brutal celebration of the event around the court in Iași, depicting Tymofiy himself as an uncouth, violent and withdrawn figure. The narrative then focuses on the Battle of Finta and the siege of Suceava, through which a Wallachian-Transylvanian force repelled the Moldo-Cossack forces and, turning the tide, entered deep into Moldavia and placed Gheorghe Ștefan on the throne. Sadoveanu also invents a love story between Ruxandra and the boyar Bogdan, whose rivalry with Tymofiy ends in the latter&#x27;s killing. While Călinescu criticized the plot as being over-detailed, and the character studies as incomplete, Crohmălniceanu found the intricate depiction of boyar customs to be a relevant part of Sadoveanu&#x27;s &quot;vast historical fresco.&quot; In both &quot;Zodia Cancerului&quot; and &quot;Nunta Domniței Ruxandra&quot;, the author took significant liberties with the historical facts. In addition to Tymofiy&#x27;s death at the hands of Bogdan, the latter narrative used invented or incorrect names for some of the personages, and portrays the muscular, mustachioed, Gheorghe Ștefan as thin and bearded; likewise, in &quot;Zodia Cancerului&quot;, Sadoveanu invents the character Guido Celesti, who stands in for the actual Franciscan leader of Duca&#x27;s Iași, Bariona da Monte Rotondo.

===&quot;Frații Jderi&quot;, &quot;Venea o moară pe Siret...&quot; and &quot;Baltagul&quot;===

With &quot;Frații Jderi&quot;, Sadoveanu&#x27;s fresco of Moldavian history maintains its setting, but moves back in time to the 15th century rule of Prince Stephen the Great. Writing in 1941, before its final part was in print, Călinescu argued that the novel was part of Sadoveanu&#x27;s &quot;most valuable work&quot;, and noted &quot;the maturity of its verbal means.&quot; In the first volume, titled &quot;Ucenicia lui Ionuț&quot; (&quot;Ionuț&#x27;s Apprenticeship&quot;), the eponymous Jderi brothers, allies of Stephen and friends of his son Alexandru, fight off the enemies of their lord on several occasions. In what is the start of a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, the youngest Jder, Ionuț Păr-Negru, consumed by love for Lady Nasta, who was kidnapped by Tatars. He goes to her rescue, only to find out that she had preferred suicide to a life of slavery. Călinescu, who believed the volumes show Sadoveanu&#x27;s move to the consecrated elements of adventure novels, called them &quot;remarkable&quot;, but stressed that the narrative could render &quot;the feeling of stumbling, of a languishing flow&quot;, and that the dénouement was &quot;rather depressing&quot;. The second book in the series (&quot;Izvorul alb&quot;, &quot;The White Water Spring&quot;) intertwines the life of the Jderi brothers with that of Stephen&#x27;s family: the ruler weds the Byzantine princess Mary of Mangop, while Simion Jder falls for Marușca, who is supposedly Stephen&#x27;s illegitimate daughter. The major episodes in the narrative are Marușca&#x27;s kidnapping by a boyar, her captivity in Jagiellon Poland, and her rescue at the hands of the Jderi. The 1942 conclusion of the cycle, &quot;Oamenii Măriei-sale&quot; (&quot;His Lordship&#x27;s Men&quot;), the brothers are shown defending their ancestral rights and their lord against the Ottoman invader and ambivalent boyars, and crushing the former at the Battle of Vaslui.

The &quot;Jderi&quot; books, again set to the background of primitivism and natural abundance, also feature episodes of intense horror. These, Călinescu proposes, are willingly depicted &quot;with an indolent complacency&quot;, as if to underline that the slow pace and monumental scale of history give little importance to personal tragedies. The same commentator notes a difference between the role nature plays in the first and second volumes: from serene, the landscape becomes hostile, and people are shown fearing earthquakes and droughts, although contemplative depictions of euphoria play a central part in both writings. The meeting between the wider world and the immobile local tradition surfaces in &quot;Frații Jderi&quot; as well: a messenger is shown wondering how the letter he brought could talk to the addressee; when she is supposed to encounter strange men, Marușca requests to be allowed to &quot;shy away&quot; in another room; a secondary character, claiming precognition, prepares his own funeral.

For the 1925 &quot;Venea o moară pe Siret...&quot;, Sadoveanu received much critical acclaim. The boyar Alexandru Filotti falls in love with a miller&#x27;s daughter, Anuța, whom he educates and introduces to high society. The beautiful young lady is also courted by Filotti&#x27;s son Costi and by the peasant Vasile Brebu—in the end, overwhelmed by jealousy, Brebu kills the object of his affection. George Călinescu writes that the good reception was not fully deserved, claiming that the novel is &quot;colorless&quot;, that it was merely based on the writer&#x27;s early stories, and that it failed in its goal of depicting &quot;crumbling boyardom&quot;.

In &quot;Baltagul&quot; (1930), Sadoveanu merged psychological techniques and a pretext borrowed from crime fiction with several of his major themes. Written in just 30 days on the basis of previous drafts, the condensed novel shows Vitoria Lipan, the widow of a murdered shepherd, following in her husband&#x27;s tracks to discover his killer and avenge his death. Accompanied by her son, and using for a guide the shepherd&#x27;s dog, Vitoria discovers both the body and the murderer, but, before she can take revenge, her dog jumps on the man and bites into his neck. By means of this plot line, Sadoveanu also builds a fresco of transhumance and traces its ancestral paths, taking as a source of inspiration one of the best-known poems in local folklore, the ballad &quot;Miorița&quot;. Vitoria&#x27;s sheer determination is the central aspect of the volume. Călinescu, who ranks the book among Sadoveanu&#x27;s best, praises its &quot;remarkable artistry&quot; and &quot;unforgettable dialogues&quot;, but nonetheless writes that Lipan&#x27;s &quot;detective-like&quot; search and a &quot;stubbornness&quot; are weak points in the narrative. Crohmălniceanu declares &quot;Baltagul&quot; one of the &quot;capital works&quot; in world literature, proposing that, on its own, it manages to reconstruct &quot;an entire shepherding civilization&quot;; Cornis-Pope, who rates the book as &quot;Sadoveanu&#x27;s masterpiece&quot;, also notes that it &quot;restated the theme of crime and punishment&quot;.

===Main travel writings and memoirs===
Before the 1940s, Sadoveanu also became known as a travel writer. His contributions notably include accounts of his hunting trips: &quot;Țara de dincolo de negură&quot; (&quot;The Land beyond the Fog&quot;), and one dedicated to the region of Dobruja (&quot;Priveliști dobrogene&quot;, &quot;Dobrujan Sights&quot;). Călinescu wrote that they both comprised &quot;pages of great beauty&quot;. &quot;Țara de dincolo...&quot;, primarily showing recluse men in real-life symbiosis with the wilderness, also attention for its sympathetic depiction of the Hutsuls, a minority Slavic-speaking population, as an ancient tribe threatened by cultural assimilation. Sadoveanu&#x27;s other travelogues include the reportage &quot;Oameni și locuri&quot; (&quot;People and Places&quot;) and an account of his trips into Bessarabia (&quot;Drumuri basarabene&quot;, &quot;Bessarabian Roads&quot;). He also collected and commented upon the memoirs of other avid hunters (&quot;Istorisiri de vânătoare&quot;, &quot;Hunting Stories&quot;).

A noted writing in this series was &quot;Împărăția apelor&quot; (&quot;The Realm of Waters&quot;). It forms a detailed and contemplative memoir of his journeys as a fisherman, and, according to Crohmălniceanu, one of the most eloquent proofs of Sadoveanu&#x27;s &quot;permanent and intimate correspondence with nature.&quot; Călinescu saw the text as a &quot;fantastic vision of the entire aquatic universe&quot;, merging a form of pessimism similar to Arthur Schopenhauer&#x27;s with a &quot;calm &quot;kief&quot;&quot; (cannabis-induced torpor), and as such illustrating &quot;the great joy of participating in the transformations of matter, of eating and allowing oneself to be eaten.&quot; Sadoveanu also contributed an account of his travels into the Netherlands, &quot;Olanda&quot; (&quot;Holland&quot;). It provides insight into his preoccupation with the meeting of civilization and wilderness: upset by what he called &quot;the [Dutch] rampancy of cleanliness&quot;, the writer confesses his perplexity at coming face to face with a contained and structured natural world, and details his own temptation to go &quot;against the current&quot;. One of Sadoveanu&#x27;s main conclusions is that Holland lacks in &quot;true and lively wonders&quot;. Sadoveanu also sporadically wrote memoirs of his early life career, such as &quot;Însemnări ieșene&quot; (&quot;Recordings from Iași&quot;), which deals with the period during which he worked for &quot;Viața Românească&quot;, a book about the Second Balkan War (&quot;44 de zile în Bulgaria&quot;, &quot;44 Days in Bulgaria&quot;), and the account of years in primary school, &quot;Domnu Trandafir&quot;. They were followed in 1944 by &quot;Anii de ucenicie&quot; (&quot;The Apprenticeship Years&quot;), where Sadoveanu details some of his earliest experiences. Despite his temptation for destroying all raw personal notes, Sadoveanu wrote and kept a large number of diaries, which were never published in his lifetime.

===Other early writings===
Also during that time, he retold and prefaced the journeys of Thomas Witlam Atkinson, an English architect and stonemason who spent years in Tartary (a book he titled &quot;Cuibul invaziilor&quot;, &quot;The Nest of Invasions&quot;). This was evidence of his growing interest in exotic subjects, which he later adapted to a series of novels, where the setting is &quot;Scythia&quot;, seen as an ancestral area of culture connecting Central Asia with the European region of Dacia (partly coinciding with present-day Romania). The home of mysterious Asiatic peoples, Sadoveanu&#x27;s Scythia is notably the background to his novels &quot;Uvar&quot; and &quot;Nopțile de Sânziene&quot;. The former shows its eponymous character, a Yakut, exposed to the scrutiny of a Russian officer. In the latter, titled after the ancestral celebration of &quot;Sânziene&quot; during the month of June, shows a French intellectual meeting a nomadic tribe of Moldavian Rom people, who, the reader learns, are actually the descendants of Pechenegs. Călinescu notes that, in such writings, &quot;the intrigue is a pretext&quot;, again serving to depict the vast wilderness confronted with the keen eye of foreign observers. He sees &quot;Nopțile de Sânziene&quot; as &quot;the novel of millenarian immobility&quot;, and its theme as one of mythological proportions. The narrative pretexts, including the &quot;Sânziene&quot; celebration and the Rom people&#x27;s social atavism, connect &quot;Nopțile...&quot; with another one of Sadoveanu&#x27;s writings, &quot;24 iunie&quot; (&quot;June 24&quot;).

According to Tudor Vianu, the 1933 fantasy novel &quot;Creanga de aur&quot; (&quot;The Golden Bow&quot;) takes partial inspiration from Byzantine literature, and is evidence of a form of Humanism found in Eastern philosophy. Marcel Cornis-Pope places it among Sadoveanu&#x27;s &quot;mythic-poetic narratives that explored the ontology and symbolics of history.&quot; The writer himself acknowledged that the esoteric nature of the book was inspired by his own affiliation to the Freemasonry, whose symbolism it partly reflected. Its protagonist, Kesarion Brebu, is included by Vianu among the images of sages and soothsayers in Mihail Sadoveanu&#x27;s fiction, and, as &quot;the last &quot;Deceneus&quot;&quot;, is a treasurer of ancient secret sciences mastered by the Dacians and the Ancient Egyptians. The novel is often interpreted as Sadoveanu&#x27;s perspective on the Dacian contribution to Romanian culture.

Sadoveanu&#x27;s series of minor novels and stories of the interwar years also comprises a set of usually urban-themed writings, which, Călinescu argues, resemble the works of Honoré de Balzac, but develop into &quot;regressive&quot; texts with &quot;a lyrical intrigue&quot;. They include &quot;Duduia Margareta&quot; (&quot;Miss Margareta&quot;), where a conflict occurs between a young woman and her governess, and &quot;Locul unde nu s-a întâmplat nimic&quot; (&quot;The Place Where Nothing Happened&quot;), where, in what is a retake on his own &quot;Apa morților&quot;, Sadoveanu depicts the cultured but bored boyar Lai Cantacuzin and his growing affection for a modest young woman, Daria Mazu. In &quot;Cazul Eugeniței Costea&quot; (&quot;The Case of Eugenița Costea&quot;), a civil servant kills himself to avoid prosecution, and his end is replicated by that of his daughter, brought to despair by her stepfather&#x27;s character and by her mother&#x27;s irrational jealousy. &quot;Demonul tinereții&quot; (&quot;The Demon of Youth&quot;), believed by Călinescu to be &quot;the most charming&quot; in this series, has for its protagonist Natanail, a university dropout who has developed a morbid fear of women since losing the love of his life, and who lives in seclusion as a monk. In the rural-themed &quot;Paștele blajinilor&quot; (&quot;Thomas Sunday&quot;) of 1935, a defeated brigand seeks a dignified end to his wasted life. Written in 1938, the short story &quot;Ochi de urs&quot; (&quot;Bear&#x27;s Eye&quot;) introduces its hero Culi Ursake, the toughened hunter, into a bizarre scenery that seems to mock a human&#x27;s understanding.

During the period, Mihail Sadoveanu also wrote children&#x27;s literature. His most significant pieces in this field are &quot;Dumbrava minunată&quot; (&quot;The Enchanted Grove&quot;, 1926), &quot;Măria-sa Puiul Pădurii&quot; (&quot;His Highness the Forest Boy&quot;, 1931), and a collection of stories adapted from Persian literature (&quot;Divanul persian&quot;, &quot;The Persian Divan&quot;, 1940). &quot;Măria-sa Puiul Pădurii&quot; is itself an adaptation of the &quot;Geneviève de Brabant&quot; story, considered &quot;somewhat highbrow&quot; by George Călinescu, while the frame story &quot;Divanul persian&quot; consciously recalls the work of 19th century Wallachian writer Anton Pann. In 1909, Sadoveanu also published adapted version of two ancient writings: the &quot;Alexander Romance&quot; (as &quot;Alexandria&quot;) and &quot;Aesop&#x27;s Fables&quot; (as &quot;Esopia&quot;). His 1921 book &quot;Cocostârcul albastru&quot; (&quot;The Blue Crane&quot;) is a series of short stories with lyrical themes. Among his early writings are two biographical novels which retell historical events from the source, &quot;Viața lui Ștefan cel Mare&quot; (&quot;The Life of Stephen the Great&quot;) and &quot;Lacrimile ieromonahului Veniamin&quot; (&quot;The Tears of Veniamin the Hieromonk&quot;), both of which, Călinescu objected, lacked in originality. The former, published in 1934, was more noted among critics, for both intimate tone and hagiographic character (recounting Stephen&#x27;s life on the model of saints&#x27; biographies).

===Socialist realism years===
Despite the post-1944 change in approach, Sadoveanu&#x27;s characteristic narrative style remained largely unmodified. In contrast, his choice of themes changed, a transition which reflected political imperatives. At the end of the process, literary historian Ana Selejan argues, Sadoveanu became the most influential prose author among Romanian Socialist realists, equaled only by the younger Petru Dumitriu. Historian Bogdan Ivașcu writes that Sadoveanu&#x27;s affiliation with &quot;proletarian culture&quot; and &quot;its masquerade&quot;, like that of Tudor Arghezi and George Călinescu, although it may have been intended to rally &quot;prestige and depth&quot; to Socialist realism, only succeeded in bring their late works to the level of &quot;propaganda and agitation materials.&quot; In contrast to these retrospective assessments, communist literary critics and cultural promoters of the 1950s regularly described Sadoveanu as the model to follow, both before and after Georgy Malenkov&#x27;s views on culture were adopted as the norm.

In his &quot;Lumina vine de la Răsărit&quot;, the writer built on the opposition between light and darkness, identifying the former with Soviet policies and the latter with capitalism. Sadoveanu thus spoke of &quot;the dragon of my own doubts&quot; being vanquished by &quot;the Sun of the East&quot;. Historian Adrian Cioroianu notes that this literary antithesis came to be widely used by various Romanian authors who rallied with Stalinism during the late 1940s, citing among these Cezar Petrescu and the former avant-garde writer Sașa Pană. He also notes that such imagery, accompanied by portrayals of Soviet joy and abundance, replicated an ancient &quot;structure of myth&quot;, adapting it to a new ideology on the basis of &quot;what could be imagined, not of what could be believed.&quot; Ioan Stanomir writes that Sadoveanu and his fellow ARLUS members use a discourse recalling the theme of a religious conversion, analogous to that of Paul the Apostle (&quot;see Road to Damascus&quot;), and critic Cornel Ungureanu stresses that Sadoveanu&#x27;s texts of the period frequently quote the Bible.

Following his return from the Soviet Union, Sadoveanu published travelogues and reportage piece, including the 1945 &quot;Moscova&quot; (&quot;Moscow&quot;, co-authored with Traian Săvulescu and economist Mitiță Constantinescu) and the 1946 &quot;Caleidoscop&quot; (&quot;Kaleidoscope&quot;). In one of these accounts, he details his encounter with Lysenkoist agronomist Nikolay Tsistsin, and claims to have tasted bread made from a brand of wheat which yielded 4,000 kilograms of grain per hectare. In a later memoir, Sadoveanu depicted his existence and the destiny of his country as improved by the communist system, and gave accounts of his renewed journeys in the countryside, where he claimed to have witnessed a &quot;spiritual splendor&quot; supported by &quot;the practice of the new times&quot;. He would follow up with hundreds of articles on various subjects, published by the communist press, including two 1953 pieces in which he lamented Stalin&#x27;s death (one of them referred to the Soviet leader as &quot;the great genius of progressive mankind&quot;).

Upon its publication, the political novel &quot;Mitrea Cocor&quot;, which depicts the hardships and eventual triumph of its eponymous peasant protagonist, was officially described as the first Socialist realist writing in local literature, and as a turning point in literary history. Often compared to Dan Deșliu&#x27;s ideologized poem &quot;Lazăr de la Rusca&quot;, it is remembered as a controversial epic dictated by ideological requirements, and argued to have been written with assistance from several other authors. Seen by historiographer Lucian Boia as an &quot;embarrassing literary fabrication&quot;, it was rated by literary critics Dan C. Mihăilescu and Luminița Marcu both as one of &quot;the most harmful books in Romanian literature&quot;, and by historian Ioan Lăcustă as &quot;a propaganda writing, a failure from a literary point of view&quot;. A praise of collectivization policies that some critics believe was a testimony that Sadoveanu was submitting himself and imposing his public to brainwashing, &quot;Mitrea Cocor&quot; was preceded by &quot;Păuna-Mică&quot;, a novel which also idealizes collective farming.

With his final published work, the 1951-1952 novel &quot;Nicoară Potcoavă&quot;, Sadoveanu retells the narrative of his &quot;Șoimii&quot;, modifying the plot and adding new characters. Noted among the latter is Olimbiada, a female soothsayer and healer through whose words Sadoveanu again dispenses his own perspective on human existence. The focus of the narrative is also changed: from the avenger of his brother&#x27;s death in &quot;Șoimii&quot;, the pretender becomes a purveyor of folk identity, aiming to reestablish the Moldavia of Stephen the Great&#x27;s times. Praised early on by Dumitriu, who believed it was proof of &quot;artistic excellence&quot;, &quot;Nicoară Potcoavă&quot; is itself seen as a source for communist-inspired political messages. According to Cornel Ungureanu, this explains why it highlights the brotherhood between Cossacks and Moldavians, supposedly replicating the official view on Soviet-Romanian relations. Cornis-Pope, who considers the novel one of Sadoveanu&#x27;s &quot;mere variations&quot; on old subjects, suggests that it transforms its protagonist &quot;from medieval fighter into political philosopher who announces the rise of a &#x27;new world&#x27;.&quot; Victor Frunză also notes that, although Sadoveanu returned to old subjects, he &quot;no longer rises to the level he had reached before the war.&quot;

The final part of Sadoveanu&#x27;s creation also comprises a series of pieces where the narrative approach was, according to Crohmălniceanu, &quot;corrected&quot; to show his favorite recluse type won over by the new society. In essence, Ungureanu argues, the new style that of &quot;reportage and plain information, adapted to orders coming from above&quot;. Such works include the 1951 &quot;Nada Florilor&quot; (&quot;The Flowers&#x27; Lure&quot;) and &quot;Clonț-de-fier&quot; (&quot;Iron Bucktooth&quot;), alongside an unfinished piece, &quot;Cântecul mioarei&quot; (&quot;Song of the Ewe&quot;). In &quot;Nada...&quot;, the peasant boy Culai follows his hero, tinsmith Alecuțu, into factory life. &quot;Clonț-de-fier&quot;, an ideologized retake on &quot;Demonul tinereții&quot;, is about a monk returning from seclusion into the world of workers, where the landscape is reshaped by large-scale construction works. According to Ungureanu, it also shows Sadoveanu&#x27;s universe stripped of &quot;all its deep meanings.&quot; While their author came to personify the new cultural guidelines, Sadoveanu&#x27;s previous books, from &quot;Frații Jderi&quot; to &quot;Baltagul&quot;, were subject to communist censorship. Various statements contradicting the ideological guidelines were cut out of new editions: the books in general could no longer include mentions of Bessarabia (a region first incorporated into the Soviet Union by a 1940 occupation) or Romanian Orthodox beliefs. In one such instance, censors of &quot;Baltagul&quot; removed a character&#x27;s claim that &quot;the Russian&quot; was by nature &quot;the drunkest of them all, [...] a worthy beggar and singer at the fairs.&quot;

==Politics==

===Nationalism and Humanism===
Sadoveanu&#x27;s engagement in politics was marked by abrupt changes in convictions, seeing him move from right- to left-wing stances several times in his life. In close connection with his traditionalist views on literature, but in contrast to his career under a Conservative Party and National Liberal cabinets, Sadoveanu initially rallied with nationalist groups of various hues, associating with both Nicolae Iorga and, in 1906, with the left-wing Poporanists at &quot;Viața Românească&quot;. An early cause of his was his attempt to reconcile Iorga with the Poporanists, but his efforts were largely fruitless. In the 1910s, the anti-Iorga traditionalist Ilarie Chendi recognized in Sadoveanu one of the Poporanists who promoted &quot;the spiritual healing of our people through culture.&quot;

Around that time, he formulated a ruralist and nationalist perspective on life, rejecting what he deemed &quot;the hybrid urban world&quot; for &quot;the world of our national realities&quot;. In Călinescu&#x27;s analysis, this signifies that, like his predecessor, the conservative Eminescu, Sadoveanu believed the cities were victims of the &quot;superimposed category&quot; of foreigners, in particular those administering leasehold estates. Following the 1907 Peasants&#x27; Revolt, Sadoveanu sent a report to his Minister of Education Spiru Haret, informing him on the state of rural education, and, beyond this, of the problems faced by villagers in Moldavia. It read: &quot;The leaseholders and landowners, no matter what their nationality, make a mockery of the Romanians&#x27; labors. Every &quot;surtucar&quot; [that is, urbanized character] in the village, mayors, notaries, paper-pushers, shamelessly [and] mercilessly milk this milk cow. They are joined by the priest—who [...] is in disagreement with the teacher.&quot; With &quot;Neamul Șoimăreștilor&quot;, the burdens of feudal society and mercantilism, most of all the restriction of economic rights, were becoming a background theme in his fiction, which later depicted Stephen the Great as the original champion of social justice (&quot;Frații Jderi&quot;). During most of his World War I activity, Sadoveanu also followed the Poporanists&#x27; Russophobia and dislike of the Entente side, describing the Russian Empire&#x27;s national policies in Bessarabia as far more barbaric than Austria-Hungary&#x27;s rule over Transylvania. In 1916, he abruptly switched to the Entente camp: his enthusiasm as propaganda officer was touched by controversy once Romania experienced massive defeats; Sadoveanu himself abandoned the Entente cause by 1918, when he was decommissioned, and resumed his flirtation with Constantin Stere&#x27;s Germanophile lobby.

Călinescu sees Sadoveanu, alongside Stere, as one of &quot;Viața Românească&quot;″s chief ideologues, noting that he was nonetheless &quot;rendered notorious by his inconsistency and opportunism.&quot; He writes that Sadoveanu and Stere both showed a resentment for ethnic minorities, particularly members of the Jewish community, whom they saw as agents of exploitation, but that, as Humanists, they had a form of &quot;humane sympathy&quot; for Jews and foreigners taken individually. The Poporanist aspect of Sadoveanu&#x27;s literature was also highlighted by Garabet Ibrăileanu in the late 1920s, when he referred to his contributions as evidence that Romanian culture was successfully returning to its specific originality. In essence, Crohmălniceanu writes, Sadoveanu was tied to &quot;Viața Românească&quot; by his advocacy of national specificity, his preference for the large-scale narrative, and his vision of pristine, &quot;natural&quot;, human beings.

According to Z. Ornea, Sadoveanu&#x27;s affiliation to the Freemasonry shaped not only his political &quot;demophilia&quot;, but also his &quot;&quot;Weltanschauung&quot;, and, through a reflex, his [literary] work.&quot; By consequence, Ornea argues, Sadoveanu became a supporter of democracy, a stance which led him into open conflict with extreme nationalists. Alongside its Humanism, Sadoveanu&#x27;s nationalism was noted for being secular, and thus in contrast with the Romanian Orthodox imagery favored by nationalists on the far right. Sadoveanu rejected the notion that ancestral Romanians were religious individuals, stating that their belief was in fact &quot;limited to rituals and customs.&quot; He was also a vocal supporter of international cooperation, particularly among countries in Eastern and Central Europe. Writing for the magazine &quot;Familia&quot; in 1935, 17 years after Transylvania&#x27;s union with Romania and 15 years after the Treaty of Trianon, Sadoveanu joined the Hungarian author Gyula Illyés in pleading for good relations between the two neighbors. As noted by Crohmălniceanu, although Sadoveanu&#x27;s interwar novels may depict both clashes between polities and benign misunderstandings, they ultimately discourage ethnic stereotypes, suggesting that &quot;the gifts and qualities of various kinships&quot; are mutually compatible. According to Marcel Cornis-Pope, this cooperative vision is the background theme to &quot;Divanul persian&quot;, a book &quot;demonstrating the value of intercultural dialogue at a time of sharp political polarization.&quot; The same text was described by Vianu as evidence of Sadoveanu&#x27;s &quot;understanding, gentleness and tolerance&quot;.

In 1926, the year of his entry into Alexandru Averescu&#x27;s People&#x27;s Party, Sadoveanu motivated his choice in a letter to Octavian Goga, indicating his belief that the intelligentsia needed to partake in politics: &quot;It would seem that what is foremost needed is the contribution of intellectuals, in an epoch when the overall intellectual level is decreasing.&quot; His sincerity was doubted by his contemporaries: both his friend Gheorghe Jurgea-Negrilești and the communist Petre Pandrea recount how, in 1926–1927, Sadoveanu and Păstorel Teodoreanu requested public funds from Interior Minister Goga, with Sadoveanu motivating that he wanted to set up a cultural magazine and later spending the money on his personal wardrobe. In contrast, Adrian Cioroianu notes that the People&#x27;s Party episode, and especially the &quot;mutual wariness&quot; between Sadoveanu and the National Liberals, underlined the writer&#x27;s sympathy for the &quot;intellectual Left&quot;. Himself a Marxist, Ovid Crohmălniceanu suggested that, as early as the 1930s, Sadoveanu&#x27;s attitudes were rather similar to the official line of communist groups.

===Opposition to fascism and support for King Carol===
During the 1930s, following his stint as head of &quot;Adevărul&quot;, a leftist newspaper owned by Jewish entrepreneurs, Sadoveanu was targeted by right-wing voices, who claimed that he had chosen to abandon his nationalist credentials. Thus, Sadoveanu became the target of a press campaign in the antisemitic and fascist press, and in particular in Nichifor Crainic&#x27;s &quot;Sfarmă-Piatră&quot; and the journals connected with the Iron Guard. The former publication deplored his supposed &quot;betrayal&quot; of the nationalist cause. In it, Ovidiu Papadima portrayed Sadoveanu as the victim of Jewish manipulation, and equated his affiliation to the Freemasonry with devil worship, and mocked his obesity, while Crainic himself compared the writer to his own character, the treacherous Ieremia Golia. &quot;Porunca Vremii&quot; often referred to him as &quot;Jidoveanu&quot; (from &quot;jidov&quot;, a dismissive term for &quot;Jew&quot;), depicted him as an agent of &quot;Judaeo-communism&quot; motivated by &quot;perversity&quot;, and called on the public to harass the writer and beat him with stones. It also protested when the public authorities in Fălticeni refused to withdraw Sadoveanu the title of honorary citizen, and again when the University of Iași made him a doctor &quot;honoris causa&quot;, and, through the voice of novelist N. Crevedia, even suggested that the writer should use his hunting rifle to commit suicide. In 1937, &quot;Porunca Vremii&quot; congratulated ultra-nationalists who had organized public burnings of Sadoveanu&#x27;s works in Southern Dobruja and in Hunedoara, as well as non-identified people who sent the writer packages containing shredded copies of his own volumes. In April 1937, the anti-Sadoveanu campaign was met with the indignation of various public figures, who issued an &quot;Appeal of the Intellectuals&quot;, signed by Liviu Rebreanu, Eugen Lovinescu, Petru Groza, Victor Eftimiu, George Topîrceanu, Zaharia Stancu, Demostene Botez, Alexandru Al. Philippide, Constantin Balmuș and others. Denouncing the campaign as a &quot;moral assassination&quot;, it referred to Sadoveanu as the author of &quot;the most Romanian [works] in our literature.&quot; Sadoveanu himself defended his fellow writer Tudor Arghezi, who stood accused by the far right press of having written &quot;pornography&quot;.

Reviewing the consequences of these scandals, Ovid Crohmălniceanu suggests that all of what Mihail Sadoveanu wrote from 1938 to 1943 is in some way connected to the cause of anti-fascism. According to Cornis-Pope, Sadoveanu&#x27;s dislike for the far right can be discovered in &quot;Creanga de aur&quot;, which doubles as &quot;a political parable opposing an archaic peasant civilization to the growing threat of fascism.&quot; However, George Călinescu claims, the writer himself had not actually revised his nationalist outlook, that he continued to believe that minorities and foreigners were a risky presence in Greater Romania, and that his Humanism was &quot;a light tincture&quot;. In one of his columns, Sadoveanu replied to those organizing the acts of vandalism, indicating that, had they actually read the novels they were destroying, they would have found &quot;a burning faith in this nation, for so long mistreated by cunning men&quot;. Elsewhere, stating that he was not going to take his detractors into consideration, Sadoveanu defined himself as an adversary of both Nazi Germany and any form of advocacy for a &quot;National-Socialist regime in our country&quot;.

Sadoveanu&#x27;s subsequent endorsement of authoritarian King Carol II and his corporatist force, the National Renaissance Front, saw his participation in the monarch&#x27;s personality cult. In 1940, he offered controversial praise to the ruler through the official journal, &quot;Revista Fundațiilor Regale&quot;, which caused Carol&#x27;s political adversary, psychologist Nicolae Mărgineanu, to deem Sadoveanu and his fellow contributors &quot;scoundrels&quot;. His renewed mandate in the Senate was a favor from Carol, also granted to George Enescu, philosopher Lucian Blaga, scientists Emil Racoviță and Iuliu Hațieganu, and several other public figures. During the Ion Antonescu dictatorship, Sadoveanu kept a low profile and was apolitical. However, Cioroianu writes, he supported the invasion of the Soviet Union and Romania&#x27;s cooperation with the Axis Powers on the Eastern Front, seeing in this a chance to recover Bessarabia and the northern part of Bukovina (lost to the 1940 Soviet occupation). In spring 1944, months before the King Michael Coup toppled the regime, he was approached by the clandestine Romanian Communist Party and its sympathizers in academia to sign an open letter condemning Romania&#x27;s alliance to Nazi Germany. According to the communist activist Belu Zilber, who took part in this action, Sadoveanu, like his fellow intellectuals Dimitrie Gusti, Simion Stoilow and Horia Hulubei, refused to sign the document. Also according to Zilber, Sadoveanu motivated his refusal by stating that the letter needed to be addressed not to Antonescu, but to King Michael I. However, and aside from its main topic, &quot;Păuna-Mică&quot; was noted as one of the few prose works of the 1940s to mention the wartime deportation of Romanian Jews by Antonescu&#x27;s regime; &quot;Caleidoscop&quot; also speaks about the 1941 Iași pogrom as &quot;our shame&quot;, and commends those who opposed it.

===Partnership with the communists===

Following his &quot;Lumina vine de la Răsărit&quot; lecture, Sadoveanu became noted for his positive portrayals of communization and collectivization. In particular, Sadoveanu offered praise to one of the major pillars of Stalinism, the 1936 Soviet Constitution. In 1945, claiming to have been &quot;flashed upon&quot; by &quot;Stalin&#x27;s argumentation&quot;, he urged the public to read the document for its &quot;sincerity&quot;; elsewhere, he equated reading the constitution with &quot;a mystical revelation&quot;. Adrian Cioroianu describes this as &quot;an office assignment&quot; from the ARLUS, at a time when the group was circulating free translated copies of the Soviet constitution. The enthusiasm of his writings also manifested itself in his public behavior: according to his ARLUS colleague Iorgu Iordan, Sadoveanu was emotional during the 1945 Soviet trip, shedding tears of joy upon visiting a day care center in the countryside. Running in the 1946 election, Sadoveanu blamed the old political class in general for the problems faced by Romanian peasants, including the major drought of that year. By then, his political partners were making use of his literary fame, and his electoral pamphlet read: &quot;There is no doubt that the thousands of people who have read his works will rush out on [election day] to vote for him.&quot; After 1948, when the Romanian communist regime was installed, Sadoveanu directed his praise toward the new authorities. In 1952, as Romania adopted its second republican constitution and the authorities intensified repression against anti-communists, Sadoveanu made some of his most controversial statements. Declaring the defunct kingdom to have been a &quot;long interval of organized injustice and crooked development in all areas&quot;, he presented the new order as an era of social justice, human dignity, available culture and universal public education.

Criticism of Sadoveanu&#x27;s moral choices also focuses on the fact that, while he led a luxurious existence, many of his generation colleagues and fellow intellectuals were being persecuted or jailed in notoriously harsh circumstances. Having tolerated the purge within the Romanian Academy, Cioroianu notes, Sadoveanu accepted being colleagues with newly promoted &quot;secondary characters [...] whom the new regime needed&quot;, such as poet Dumitru Theodor Neculuță and historian Mihail Roller. In his official capacity, Sadoveanu even signed several death sentences declared by communist tribunals, and, in the wake of the Tămădău Affair of summer 1947, presided over the Chamber sessions which outlawed the opposition National Peasants&#x27; Party: according to researcher Victor Frunză, he was a willing participant in this, having been upset by the exposure of his personal wealth in the National Peasantist press. Later, Sadoveanu made a reference to his former colleague, the National Peasantist activist Ion Mihalache, arguing that his old Agrarianist approach to politics had made him a &quot;ridiculous character&quot;. Ioan Stanomir describes this fragment as one of &quot;intellectual abjection&quot;, indicating that Mihalache, already a political prisoner of the regime, was to die in captivity. However, as leader of the Romanian Writers&#x27; Union, the aging writer is credited by some with having protected poet Nicolae Labiș, a disillusioned communist who had been excluded from the Union of Worker Youth in spring 1954, and whose work Sadoveanu treasured. He is also reported to have helped George Călinescu publish the novel &quot;Scrinul negru&quot;, mediating between him and communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej.

Mihail Sadoveanu provided a definition of his own political transition in conversation with fellow writer Ion Biberi (1946). At the time, he claimed: &quot;I have never engaged in politics, in the sense that one assigns to this word.&quot; He elaborated: &quot;I am a left-wing person, following the line of a Poporanist zeal in the spirit of &quot;Viața Românească&quot;, but one adapted to the new circumstances.&quot; Cioroianu sees in such statements evidence that, trying to discard his past, Sadoveanu was including himself among the socialist intellectuals &quot;willing to let themselves be won over by the indescribable charm and the full swing of the communist utopia&quot;, but that he may in reality have been &quot;motivated by fear&quot;. Paraphrasing communist vocabulary, Stanomir describes the writer as one of the &quot;bourgeois&quot; personalities who became &quot;fellow travelers&quot; of the communists, and argues that Sadoveanu&#x27;s claim to have always leaned towards a &quot;people&#x27;s democracy&quot; inaugurated &quot;a pattern of chameleonism&quot;. In the view of historian Vladimir Tismăneanu, Sadoveanu, like Parhon, George Călinescu, Traian Săvulescu and others, was one of the &quot;non-communist intellectuals&quot; attracted into cooperation with the Romanian Communist Party and the communist regime (Tismăneanu also argues that these figures&#x27; good relationship with Gheorghiu-Dej was a factor in the process, as was Gheorghiu-Dej&#x27;s ability to make himself look &quot;harmless&quot;). Others have submitted that Sadoveanu&#x27;s faction in the Freemasonry, which included far left advocates Mihai Ralea and Alexandru Claudian, and officially supported evolutionary socialism, was a natural partner of the communists, to the point of sanctioning its own state-organized suppression.

According to Adrian Cioroianu, Sadoveanu was not necessarily an &quot;apostle of communization&quot;, and his role in the process is subject to much debate. Describing the writer&#x27;s &quot;conversion to philosovietism&quot; as &quot;purely contextual&quot;, Cioroianu also points out that the very notion of &quot;light arising in the East&quot; is read by some as Sadoveanu&#x27;s encoded message to other Freemasons, warning them of a Soviet threat to the organization. The historian notes that, for all their possible lack in sincerity, Sadoveanu&#x27;s statements provided a template for other intellectuals to follow—this, he argues, was the case of Cezar Petrescu. Other statements made by Sadoveanu also displayed a possibly studied ambiguity, as is the case with a 1952 lecture he gave in front of young writers attending the Party-controlled School of Literature, where he implicitly denied that one could be created a writer unless by &quot;God or Mother Nature&quot;.

==Legacy==

===Influence===
Sadoveanu&#x27;s prose, in particular his treatment of natural settings, was a direct influence in the works of writers such as Dimitrie D. Pătrășcanu, Nicolae N. Beldiceanu, Jean Bart, and Al. Lascarov-Moldovanu; his storytelling techniques were also sometimes borrowed by comedic novelist Damian Stănoiu, and, in later years, by historical novelist Dumitru Vacariu. According to Călinescu, Sadoveanu&#x27;s early hunting stories published by &quot;Viața Românească&quot;, together with those of &quot;Junimist&quot; Nicolae Gane, helped establish the genre within the framework of Romanian literature, and paved the way for its predilect use in the works of Ioan Alexandru Brătescu-Voinești. Călinescu also notes that &quot;Scrisorile unui răzeș&quot; (&quot;Letters of a Peasant&quot;), an early work by novelist Cezar Petrescu, are deeply marked by Sadoveanu&#x27;s influence, and that the same writer&#x27;s use of the Moldavian dialect is a &quot;pastiche&quot; from Sadoveanu. Ion Vinea too, while expressing admiration for Sadoveanu, defined all his disciples and imitators as &quot;mushroom-writers from Sadoveanu&#x27;s woods&quot; and &quot;butlers who steal [their lord&#x27;s lingerie] in order to wear his blazon&quot;. The issue was much later discussed by writer-critic Ioan Holban, who likewise described most historical novelists inspired by Sadoveanu as &quot;insignificant&quot; to Romanian letters.

Under the early stages of the communist regime, before the rise of Nicolae Ceaușescu engendered a series of rehabilitations and accommodated nationalism, the Romanian curriculum was dependent on ideological guidelines. At the time, Sadoveanu was one of the writers from the interwar whose work was still made available to Romanian schoolchildren. In the 1953 Romanian language and literature manual, he represented his generation alongside the communist authors Alexandru Toma and Alexandru Sahia, and was introduced mainly through his &quot;Mitrea Cocor&quot;. At the time, studies of his work were published by prominent communist critics, among them Ovid Crohmălniceanu, Paul Georgescu, Traian Șelmaru, Mihai Novicov, Eugen Campus and Dumitru Isac, while a 1953 reissue of &quot;Baltagul&quot; was published in 30,000 copies (a number rarely met by the Romanian publishing industry in that context). In later years, Profira Sadoveanu became a noted promoter of her father&#x27;s literature and public image, publishing children&#x27;s versions of his biography, notably featuring illustrations by Mac Constantinescu (1955 edition).

Although Sadoveanu continued to be hailed as a major writer during the Ceaușescu years, and the seventy years of his debut were marked with state ceremony, the reaction against Soviet influence affected presentations of his work: his official bibliography no longer included any mention of &quot;Păuna-Mică&quot;. Among the memoirs dealing with Sadoveanu&#x27;s late years were those of Alexandru Rosetti, published in 1977. The official revival of nationalist discourse in the 1960s allowed controversial critic Edgar Papu to formulate his version of Protochronism, which postulated that phenomenons within Romanian culture preceded developments in world culture. In this context, Papu spoke of Sadoveanu as &quot;one of the great precursory voices&quot;, comparing him to Rabindranath Tagore. After the 1989 Revolution toppled communism, Sadoveanu remained an influence on some young authors, who recovered the themes of his work in a Postmodern or parodic manner. Among them is Dan Lungu, who, according to critic Andrei Terian, alluded to the &quot;Hanu Ancuței&quot; frame story when constructing his 2004 novel &quot;Paradisul găinilor&quot;. In 2001, a poll carried among literati by &quot;Observator Cultural&quot; magazine listed six of his works as some of the best 150 Romanian novels.

Mihail Sadoveanu&#x27;s various works were widely circulated abroad. This phenomenon began as early as 1905, when German-language translations were first published, and continued during the 1930s, when &quot;Venea o moară pe Siret...&quot; was translated very soon after its original Romanian edition. In 1931, female author and feminist militant Sarina Cassvan included French-language versions of his texts into an anthology designed to promote modern Romanian culture internationally. Also then, some of Sadoveanu&#x27;s texts were rendered in Chinese by Lu Xun.

Tudor Vianu attributes the warm international reception Sadoveanu generally received to his abilities in rendering the Romanians&#x27; &quot;own way of sensing and seeing nature and humanity&quot;, while literary historian Adrian Marino points out that, Sadoveanu and Liviu Rebreanu were exceptional in their generation for taking an active interest in how their texts were translated, edited and published abroad.

Later, publicizing Sadoveanu&#x27;s work to Eastern Bloc and world audiences became a priority for the communist regime. Thus, &quot;Mitrea Cocor&quot; was, together with similar works by Zaharia Stancu and Eusebiu Camilar, among the first wave of Romanian books to have been translated into Czech and published in Communist Czechoslovakia. Alongside similar works by Petru Dumitriu, &quot;Mitrea Cocor&quot; was also among the few English-language editions sanctioned by the Romanian regime, being translated and published, with a preface by Jack Lindsay, in 1953. Nine years later, the collected short stories were a tool for cultural exchange between Romania and the United States. Sadoveanu&#x27;s good standing in the Soviet Union after World War II also made him one of the few Romanian writers whose works were still being published in the Moldavian SSR (which, as part of Bessarabia, had previously been a region of Greater Romania).

Sadoveanu&#x27;s diaries and notes were collected and edited during the early 2000s, being published in 2006 by Editura Junimea and the MLR. The main coordinators of this project were literary historian Constantin Ciopraga and Constantin Mitru, who was Sadoveanu&#x27;s brother-in-law and personal secretary. The popularity of his writings remained high into the early 21st century: in 2004, when the country marked a hundred years since Sadoveanu&#x27;s debut, &quot;Șoimii&quot; was published in its 15th edition. According to Simuț, the occasion itself was nevertheless marked with &quot;the impression of general indifference&quot;, making Sadoveanu seem &quot;a submerged continent, remembered by us only with piousness and confusion&quot;.

===Tributes===
Sadoveanu is an occasional presence in the literary works of his fellow generation members. His &quot;Țara de dincolo de negură&quot; was partly written as a tribute to George Topîrceanu&#x27;s piece of the same name, with both authors sketching an affectionate portrait of one another. Topîrceanu also parodied his friend&#x27;s style in a five-paragraph sketch, part of a series of such fragments, recorded their encounters in various other autobiographical writings, and dedicated him the first version of his poem &quot;Balada popii din Rudeni&quot; (&quot;Ballad of the Priest from Rudeni&quot;). Under the name &quot;Nicolae Pădureanu&quot;, Sadoveanu is a character in the novel and disguised autobiography &quot;În preajma revoluției&quot; (&quot;On the Eve of the Revolution&quot;), authored by his colleague Constantin Stere. Sadoveanu is honored in two writings by Nicolae Labiș, collectively titled &quot;Sadoveniene&quot; (&quot;Sadovenians&quot;). The first, titled &quot;Mihail Sadoveanu&quot;, is a prose poem which alludes to Sadoveanu&#x27;s prose, and the other, a free verse piece, is titled &quot;Cozma Răcoare&quot;.

In his scientific study of Sadoveanu&#x27;s work, Eugen Lovinescu himself turns to pure literature, portraying Sadoveanu as a child blessed by the Moirai or &quot;ursitoare&quot; with ironic gifts, such as an obstinacy for nature writing in the absence of actual observation (&quot;You shall write; you shall write and could never stop yourself writing [...]. The readers will grow tired, but you will remain tireless; you shall not known rest, just as you shall not know nature [...]&quot;). George Călinescu was one to object to this portrayal, noting that it was merely a &quot;literary device which hardly covers the emptiness of [Lovinescu&#x27;s] idea.&quot; Also during the interwar, philosopher Mihai Ralea made Mihail Sadoveanu the subject of a sociological study investigating his literary contributions in the context of social evolutions.

A portrait of Sadoveanu was drawn by graphic artist Ary Murnu, within a larger work which depicts the Kübler Coffeehouse society. Sadoveanu was also the subject of a 1929 painting by Ștefan Dumitrescu, part of a series on &quot;Viața Românească&quot; figures. In its original edition, &quot;Mitrea Cocor&quot; was supposed to feature a series of drawings made by Corneliu Baba, one of the best-known Romanian visual artists for his generation. Baba, who had been officially criticized for &quot;formalism&quot;, was pressured by the authorities into accepting the commission or risk a precarious existence. The result of his work was rejected with a similar label, and the sketches were for long not made available to the public. Baba also painted Sadoveanu&#x27;s portrait, which, in 1958, art critic Krikor Zambaccian as &quot;the synthesis of Baba&#x27;s art&quot;, depicting &quot;a man of letters aware of his mission [and] the leading presence of an active consciousness&quot;. Constantin Mitru inherited the painting and passed it on to the Museum of Romanian Literature (MLR). A marble bust of Sadoveanu, the work of Ion Irimescu, was set up in Fălticeni in 1977. In Bucharest, a memorial plaque was placed on Pitar Moș Street, on a house where he lived for a period. During the 1990s, another bust of Sadoveanu, the work of several sculptors, was unveiled in Chișinău, Republic of Moldova (the former Moldavian SSR), part of the &quot;Aleea Clasicilor&quot; sculptural ensemble.

Sadoveanu&#x27;s writings also made an impact on film culture, and in particular on Romanian cinema of the communist period. However, the first film based on his works was a German production of 1929: based on &quot;Venea o moară...&quot; and titled &quot;Sturmflut der Liebe&quot; (&quot;Storm Tide of Love&quot;), it notably starred Marcella Albani, Alexandru Giugaru and Ion Brezeanu. The series of Romanian-made films began with the 1952 &quot;Mitrea Cocor&quot;, co-directed by Marietta Sadova (who also starred in the film) and Victor Iliu. The film itself was closely supervised for conformity with ideological guidelines, and had to be partly redone because its original version did not meet them. Mircea Drăgan directed a 1965 version of &quot;Neamul Șoimăreștilor&quot; (with a screenplay co-written by Constantin Mitru) and a 1973 adaptation of &quot;Frații Jderi&quot; (with contributions by Mitru and by Profira Sadoveanu). In 1969, Romanian studios produced a film version of &quot;Baltagul&quot;, directed by Mircea Mureșan and with Sidonia Manolache as Vitoria Lipan. Ten years later, Constantin Vaeni released &quot;Vacanță tragică&quot; (&quot;Tragic Holiday&quot;), based on &quot;Nada Florilor&quot;, followed by a 1980 adaptation of &quot;Dumbrava minunată&quot; and Stere Gulea&#x27;s 1983 &quot;Ochi de urs&quot; (tr. &quot;The Bear Eye&#x27;s Curse&quot;). In 1989, just before the Romanian Revolution, Dan Pița produced his film &quot;The Last Ball in November&quot;, based on &quot;Locul unde nu s-a întâmplat nimic&quot;.

During the early decades of communist rule, Sadoveanu, Alexandru Toma and later Tudor Arghezi were often paid homage with state celebrations, likened by literary critic Florin Mihăilescu to the personality cult reserved for Stalin and Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej. For a while after the writer&#x27;s death, the Writers&#x27; Union club, commonly known as &quot;The Writers&#x27; House&quot;, bore Sadoveanu&#x27;s name. &quot;Casa cu turn&quot; in Iași, which Sadoveanu had donated to the state in 1950, went through a period of neglect and was finally set up as a museum in 1980. Similar sites were set up in his Fălticeni house, and in his final residence at Voividenia, while the Bradu-Strâmb chalet was controversially granted to the Securitate, and later to the Romanian Police. Each year, Iași commemorates the writer through a cultural festival known as the &quot;Mihail Sadoveanu Days&quot;. In 2004, the 100th anniversary of his debut was marked by a series of exhibits and symposiums, organized by the MLR. Similar events are regularly held in various cities, and include the &quot;In Sadoveanu&#x27;s Footsteps&quot; colloquy of writers, held during March 2006 in the city of Piatra Neamț. Since 2003, in tribute to Sadoveanu&#x27;s love for the game, an annual chess tournament is held in Iași. The Sadoveanu High School and a bookstore in Bucharest are named after him, and streets named after him exist in, among other places, Iași, Fălticeni, Timișoara, Oradea, Brașov, Galați, Suceava, Călărași, Târgu Jiu, Miercurea Ciuc, Petroșani, and Mangalia. Pașcani hosts a cultural center, a high school and a library named after him. Sadoveanu&#x27;s memory is also regularly honored in the Republic of Moldova, where, in 2005, the 125th anniversary of his birth was celebrated in an official context. A street in Chișinău and a high school in the town of Cupcini are also named after him.

<text>This is a list of U.S. state dinosaurs in the United States, including the District of Columbia. Many states also have dinosaurs as state fossils, or designate named avian dinosaurs (List of U.S. state birds), but this list only includes those that have been officially designated as &quot;state dinosaurs&quot;. Most of these dinosaurs were recognized as such due to efforts from students.

<text>I, Robot is a shooter video game developed and published by Atari, Inc. for arcades. Designed by Dave Theurer, only a total of 750–1000 arcade cabinets were produced. The arcade machine comes with two games. The first is &quot;I, Robot&quot;, a multi-directional shooter that has the player assume the role of &quot;Unhappy Interface Robot #1984&quot;, a servant bot that rebels against Big Brother. The object of the game involves the servant bot going through 126 levels, turning red squares to blue to destroy Big Brother&#x27;s shield and eye. The player can switch to the second game, &quot;Doodle City&quot;, a drawing tool that lasts for three minutes.

&quot;I, Robot&quot; was the first commercially produced arcade video game rendered entirely with real-time, flat-shaded, 3D polygon graphics. Previous real-time 3D graphics were vector lines instead of rasterized polygons, one example being Atari&#x27;s &quot;Tempest&quot; (1981) a &quot;tube shooter&quot; which Dave Theurer had also designed and programmed. While Funai&#x27;s laserdisc game &quot;Interstellar&quot; (1983) had previously used pre-rendered 3D computer graphics and Simutrek&#x27;s &quot;Cube Quest&quot; (1983) had used real-time 3D graphics combined with laserdisc full-motion video backgrounds, &quot;I, Robot&quot; was the first arcade game to be rendered entirely with 3D polygon graphics at runtime. It was also the first video game to feature camera-control options. The game&#x27;s name was originally &quot;&quot;Ice Castles&quot;, but was changed to &quot;I, Robot&quot;&quot;.

Upon release of the game, &quot;I, Robot&quot; received poor reception and was a financial flop. Approximately 750–1000 units of the game were created, with few having been confirmed to exist today. However, the remaining arcade cabinets have become rare collectibles and the game has received later praise for its innovative 3D graphics. Author David Ellis listed it as one of the &quot;notable classics&quot; of its time. In 2022, the game was included as part of the &quot;Atari 50&quot; compilation, marking its first re-release.

&quot;I, Robot&quot; and &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; were the last two arcade games released from Atari, Inc. Shortly afterward, the company was split up, with the home console and personal computer divisions sold to Jack Tramiel and renamed Atari Corporation. The arcade coin-op division was retained by Warner Communications and renamed Atari Games. &quot;Marble Madness&quot; was the first arcade coin-op game released under the new Atari Games banner.

==Gameplay==

In &quot;I, Robot&quot;, the player controls &quot;Unhappy Interface Robot #1984&quot;, a servant robot that has become self-aware and decides to rebel against Big Brother. To advance from level to level, the robot must destroy the giant blinking eye of Big Brother, first by wearing down its shield and then attacking the eye directly. The robot fires energy at the shield by moving over red blocks in the level, converting them to blue.

Although the robot can jump, the robot will be destroyed if jumping while the eye is open. Various extra hazards, such as birds, bombs and flying sharks, can also destroy the robot during each level. At the end of some levels, rather than destroying the eye immediately, the robot must navigate a maze and collect gems before it encounters the eye at close range. Once a level is completed, the robot flies through outer space and must shoot or avoid &quot;tetras&quot;, meteors, and various obstacles (including a floating head that fires nails) to reach the next level.

The player can adjust the camera angle during gameplay, moving closer to the robot or flying up for an overhead view of the level. The closer the camera is to the robot, the greater the score multiplier, but the more difficult it is to see the whole level and Big Brother. In later levels, enemies known as &quot;viewer killers&quot; begin attacking the camera directly, forcing the player to either change the viewing angle or move the robot so that the camera will follow it. Failing to avoid a viewer killer costs the player a life.

There are 26 unique level designs; after completing all of them, the levels repeat at a higher difficulty and with a different color palette, as in Atari&#x27;s earlier game &quot;Tempest&quot;. After completing a total of 126 levels, the player is thrown back to a random earlier level. The game ends when the player runs out of lives.

===Doodle City===
&quot;Doodle City&quot;, referred to in the game as an ungame, is a simple drawing tool which presents the player with a selection of objects from the &quot;game&quot; mode. It was in some ways, an experiment in 3D art. The player can move and rotate each shape and can cause trails to be left on the screen as they are moved. The player can remain in this mode for up to three minutes per credit, and can switch back to the main game at any time. One life is subtracted from the player&#x27;s life pool for each minute spent in &quot;Doodle City&quot;.

==Development==
The game features amplified stereo and pixel graphics on a 19-inch color CRT monitor. It uses a Motorola 6809 central processing unit and four Atari POKEY audio chips. &quot;I, Robot&quot; was originally called &quot;Ice Castles&quot;.

Dave Sherman developed the custom bit-slice (&#x27;pepperoni&#x27;) 3D co-processor that allowed for a throughput of approximately 2,000 polygons per second. It includes four AMD 2901 4-bit slice programmable ALU chips.

&quot;I, Robot&quot;&#x27;s cabinet was identical to the &quot;Firefox&quot; laserdisc game upright cabinet. The cabinet was furnished with an Atari patented Hall-effect joystick, two fire buttons and two buttons to control the players viewing angle.

The gameplay borrowed features from earlier arcade games such as &quot;Galaga&quot; (1981) and &quot;Pac-Man&quot; (1980). The game&#x27;s release was delayed due to technical issues and difficulties, so it was returned to the lab for further testing and research, and was not fully released until June 1984.

==Reception==

&quot;I, Robot&quot; received a poor reception on release. Approximately 750–1000 units of the game were created. Few have been confirmed to exist today. The arcade cabinets have since become rare collectibles with Dave Theurer&#x27;s involvement being a selling point among collectors.

The arcade game received mixed reviews upon release. &quot;Play Meter&quot; published two reviews in its December 1984 issue. Gene Lewin rated the dedicated arcade cabinet 2 out of 10, but raised it to 7 if released as a conversion kit. The review praised the &quot;unusual&quot; colorful graphics and originality, but said &quot;it lacks the excitement necessary to make it a top earning game&quot; and that an &quot;average player will not be very interested in &quot;I, Robot&quot;.&quot; Roger C. Sharpe rated it three hashes, with praise for the &quot;new 3-D raster video animation system&quot; and execution, stating it &quot;won&#x27;t be a sure-fire sensation, but it does exhibit &quot;sleeper&quot; qualities.&quot; Clare Edgeley of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; magazine reviewed the game in March 1985, stating that the &quot;graphics are perhaps the most unusual of any arcade game around&quot; but is nevertheless &quot;a cubist&#x27;s delight.&quot; She also said the ability to change angles is a &quot;nice&quot; touch. In 1991, &quot;Mean Machines&quot; placed it on its wishlist for arcade games to appear on consoles, believing the Super Famicom would do that game justice. In 2001, author John Sellers described &quot;I, Robot&quot; as a &quot;near miss&quot; because of its strong release that didn&#x27;t gain enough popularity. He further praised the game, calling it enjoyable and influential.

Author David Ellis in 2004 listed it as one of the &quot;notable classics&quot; of its time, calling it &quot;quirky&quot;. In 2008, &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; listed it as the number ninety arcade game in technical, creative and cultural impact, citing its innovative 3D graphics. Gamasutra placed &quot;I, Robot&quot; on its &quot;20 Atari Games&quot; list, saying that &quot;This is the kind of brilliance Atari could field in its halcyon days&quot;. The game has been cited as the first arcade game to use 3D filled-polygon graphics, and holds a Guinness World Record for the milestone. IGN.com&#x27;s Levi Buchanan and Craig Harris included &quot;I Robot&quot; to their &quot;Dream Arcades&quot; articles.

A rumor persisted that Atari shipped 500 unsold units to Japan with instructions to dump the units into the ocean at the halfway point. Atari employee Rusty Dawe dispelled this rumor as a &quot;total myth&quot; in a 2009 interview, adding &quot;I would have LIKED to dump [the] &quot;I, Robot&quot; controls into the ocean [as they were a] total nightmare. But that didn&#x27;t happen either.&quot;

==Legacy==
A remake of the game was announced on February 12, 2025. The remake is being developed by Llamasoft, whose founder and game director Jeff Minter worked with Atari in the past.

<doc id="913571" wikidata="Q2271348" url="?curid=913571" title="Bad Radio">
<text>Bad Radio was a four-piece, American funk rock band that formed in San Diego, California, in 1986. The band is most notable for having featured future Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder as its lead singer from 1988 to 1990. The band was a popular live band in Southern California, but never released a record on a label.

==History==
Bad Radio was formed in 1986 by vocalist Keith Wood, guitarist Dave George, bassist Dave Silva, and drummer Joey Ponchetti. The music of the original incarnation of the band was influenced by Duran Duran. Between 1988 and 1990, future Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder was the vocalist. After Vedder joined Bad Radio, the band moved on to a more alternative rock sound influenced by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. During his time with the band he premiered the song &quot;Better Man&quot;, which would later be recorded with Pearl Jam.

In 1989, the band released a 4-song demo tape which has been dubbed the &quot;Tower Records Demo&quot; due to it being sold locally in San Diego Tower Records stores for about a year. Later that year the band released another demo tape titled &quot;What the Funk&quot;. The demo tape was funded after winning a battle of the bands contest held by San Diego radio station 91X. The demo tape included recordings of songs titled, &quot;I&#x27;m Alive&quot;, &quot;Homeless&quot;, &quot;What the Funk&quot;, and &quot;Believe You Me&quot;.

Vedder&#x27;s last show with the band was February 11, 1990. After Vedder left, original band vocalist Keith Wood replaced him, and the band relocated to Hollywood, where the band was joined by a new drummer, Dawn Richardson. Richardson would later join the 4 Non Blondes.

<doc id="913572" wikidata="Q4852909" url="?curid=913572" title="Baltimore Polytechnic Institute">
<text>The Baltimore Polytechnic Institute, colloquially referred to as BPI, Poly, and The Institute, is a US public high school founded in 1883. Established as an all-male manual trade / vocational high school by the Baltimore City Council and the Baltimore City Public Schools, it is now a coeducational academic institution since 1974, that emphasizes sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics (&quot;STEM&quot;). It is located on a tract of land in North Baltimore on the east bank of the Jones Falls stream (running north to south). B.P.I. and the adjacent still all-girls population of the Western High School are located on the same huge joint campus at the northwest corner of West Cold Spring Lane and Falls Road.

== History ==
B.P.I. was founded in 1883, after Baltimorean Joshua Plaskitt petitioned the Baltimore municipal and school authorities to establish a school for instruction in engineering. The original school was named the Baltimore Manual Training School, and its first class was made up of about sixty students, all of them male. The official name of the new high school was changed a decade later in 1893 to &quot;The Baltimore Polytechnic Institute&quot; by the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners of the Baltimore City Public Schools. The first principals at the B.M.T.S. were Dr. Richard Grady, followed by two American naval officers, Lieutenant John D. Ford (U.S.N.), and Lieutenant William King (U.S.N.). Lt. King had such long lasting beginning influence on the new technical high school&#x27;s academic rigor and traditions giving the school a naval flavor in its early decades. Because of this seminal influence, the connecting structure at the new 1967 campus at Cold Spring and Falls (with a distinctive outside stone facade and engraving with the school name) between the two new building wings of the academic and engineering halls (future also renamed &quot;Dehuff&quot; and &quot;Burkert Halls&quot;) which contains the hallowed Memorial Corridor filled with Poly historical and biographical wall plaques, displays and glass exhibit floor cabinets along with at the west end of the stained glass window, statue head bust and B.P.I. bronze seal imbedded in the floor (all imported from the old North Avenue building of 1913–1967) is situated here. This wing was renamed after him as &quot;King Memorial Hall&quot; as one of the three new main 1967 campus structures along with the others in the 1980s after the Institute&#x27;s centennial celebration.

The first building location designated in 1883 for the new manual training / technical school was located in part of a former grammar (elementary) school building on the earlier former site of the old central City Spring and small surrounding pocket park from colonial era days of old Baltimore Town on now disappeared Courtland Street just north of East Saratoga Street. This area was three blocks northwest of the Baltimore City Courthouse and the adjacent historic Battle Monument square (commemorating from the British naval and land attack in the famous Battle of Baltimore and bombardment of Fort McHenry in the War of 1812 in September 1814).

It was unfortunately later contained in Baltimore&#x27;s first &quot;urban renewal&quot; plan with the tearing down of five square blocks in this then northern reaches of Downtown Baltimore of what today would be architecturally significant and historic residential townhouses along old Courtland Street and the original Saint Paul Street (which paralleled it to the west), between Calvert Street to the east and Charles Street up the hill to the west. This major demolition project was to permit the construction of new terraced &quot;Preston Gardens&quot; and adjacent Saint Paul Place which ran from East Centre Street in the north to East Lexington Street in the south occurred at the end of the mayoral administration of James H. Preston in 1919–1920. It was occupied by numerous African American black professionals and commercial offices in this downtown district and the razing and creation of the terraced gardens was to protect the nearby wealthy cultural Mount Vernon-Belvedere neighborhood on the heights to the west and north around the historic Washington Monument from any unwanted racial encroachment.

The old Courtland Street was wiped out and replaced by the terraced gardens and a landscaped St. Paul Place in the five blocks. The former B.M.T.S. / B.P.I. building was on the east side (and earlier elementary school structure it occupied dating back to the 1840s) after the high school moved further north to East North Avenue and North Calvert Street in 1912–1913. Two decades later by 1935 it became home to the newly established Baltimore City Department of Public Welfare (now renamed Social Services Department) during the famous economic collapse of the Great Depression era and continued there for three decades. The Courtland / St. Paul Street / Place structures complex was later purchased / annexed by neighboring Mercy Hospital, (which was formerly named &quot;Baltimore City Hospital&quot;), for its westward expansion located originally one block to the east on North Calvert and East Saratoga Streets, on the northwest corner since the 1840s and its reorganization in the early 1870s. These old 19th century Poly / Public Welfare buildings were then later torn down in the early 1960s for construction of their first modern hospital tower (now renamed McCauley Building) in 1964. It recently also supplemented by additional major construction of the adjacent high-rise Bunting Tower hospital facilities in the 2010s.

In 1983, at the technology high school&#x27;s centennial observation and celebration, a large historical bronze plaque was placed and dedicated with ceremonies of City officials, B.C.P.S. staff and B.P.I. administration / faculty / students and alumni in the St. Paul Place West lobby of the Mercy Hospital complex commemorating that earlier first home of the Manual Training School for 30 years, later to become &quot;Poly&quot;.

It just so happened in an amazing coincidence, that these original Poly buildings were and situated across the same street of Courtland 44 years later, (almost a half-century) after their long-time arch-rival public high school, The Baltimore City College, (then known only as &quot;The High School&quot; for its first five years) was earlier established facing the same street in a rented small two-story rowhouse with pitched roof and dormer attic window in October 1839 where it remained for only a few short years to 1843, also on the same now vanished narrow alley-like Courtland Street!!. Both schools began on the same street a short distance from each other separated by a near half-century of time.

=== Relocation ===
Due to continued growth of the student population of the City&#x27;s Public Schools system in the early 20th century and especially in the growing demand for higher secondary education at high schools like at the B.P.I.and the rival B.C.C. and the two girls high schools of Eastern and Western, the City&#x27;s technical school relocated after a long public campaign for larger better facilities ten blocks further north from downtown in 1913 to Calvert Street and North Avenue (formerly known as Boundary Avenue, of the old City / County line of 1818–1888. The former old 1860s era converted mansion of French Second Empire style architecture of the former Maryland School for the Blind was purchased. It was sitting on a slight hill above the avenue in a then rural / suburban setting. Two additional massive three-story wings on the east and west sides of the center mansion were constructed and added by the City with a Greek Revival architecture 
with Classical style columns on the front facade. Now for the first time in its 30 years history &quot;Tech&quot; had a suitable building expansive enough to handle both its academic and technical education requirements. But the growth of &quot;The Institute&quot; was so much that in only a decade and a half by 1930, the old original central wing of &quot;The Mansion&quot; from the Blind School was razed after only 17 years and replaced by a simpler center three-story wing between the two flanking earlier 1913 structures with an additional large enormous auditorium / gymnasium in a further east wing facing North Avenue and towards adjacent Guilford Avenue were constructed. This massive assembly hall and physical education building with swimming pool was the largest built at the time in the city and the auditorium served many secular / civic / cultural occasions and events in town for decades into the mid-1980s. While at this location, the high school expanded both its academic, technical and athletic programs under the extensive longtime leadership of legendary Dr. Wilmer Dehuff, who was the fourth principal from 1921 to 1958.

Principal Dehuff despite his many accomplishments in his long educational career and his devotion and love of Poly, unfortunately in his view opposed and reluctantly (see below) oversaw the racial integration of the technology high school in September 1952, the first instance in the American Upper South region with the City of Baltimore public schools admitting African-American – then called &quot;Negro&quot; 
/ &quot;Colored&quot; students. The Baltimore City Public Schools (founded 1829), had maintained racially segregated schools since first beginning public education for its black minority in Baltimore in 1870. The nationally famous precedent occurred two years before the rest of the nation took up this serious issue of inequality and discrimination addressed finally by the Supreme Court of the United States in May 1954 in the famous case of &quot;Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas&quot;. Previous black students in Baltimore City (and from adjacent Baltimore County also) had attended the Frederick Douglass High School (formerly named the &quot;Colored High School&quot; up to 1923 – second oldest in the nation – founded the same year as Poly – 1883) on the westside of town and the later opening Paul Laurence Dunbar High School in East Baltimore. Dr. Dehuff later after his retirement in 1958 and his 37 years career at the Polytechnic Institute, became the president and dean of faculty at the then private institution, the University of Baltimore on Mount Royal Avenue.

=== Integration/desegregation ===
Most Baltimore City public schools since 1870 
were not integrated until after the Supreme Court decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; of May 1954 in the following September / Fall semester. B.P.I. since the 1920s had an unusually advanced and difficult college-level mathematics, engineering and technology oriented &quot;A&quot; Course, the &quot;Advanced College Preparatory Curriculum&quot; instituted back in the 1920s as part of then Public Schools reform and improvement program. It included calculus, analytical chemistry, electricity, mechanics and surveying; these subjects were not offered at the black high schools in the city before 1952. But a parallel &quot;A&quot; Course centered on the 
humanities / social studies / liberal arts was also 
longtime since the &#x27;20s offered at arch-rival City College with a similar degree of rigorous quality. But its focus was in different fields. Other &quot;A&quot; Courses were similarly available at the two also all-white and all-girls Eastern and Western High Schools, both founded 1844. B.P.I. was a whites-only school but supported by municipal taxes on the general population. No black schools in the city (black students could not attend whites-only schools) offered such courses, nor did they have classrooms, labs, libraries or teachers comparable to those at B.P.I. or at the similar level of The Baltimore City College.

Because of this, a group of 16 Baltimoreans African American students, with help and support from their parents, along with the Baltimore Urban League, and the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) applied for the mathematics / engineering &quot;A&quot; Course at the Poly; the applications were initially denied and so the students sued in local Maryland state circuit court.

The subsequent trial began on June 16, 1952. The NAACP&#x27;s intentions were to end segregation at the 70-year-old public high school. In the B.P.I. case they argued that BPI&#x27;s offerings of specialized engineering courses violated the &quot;separate but equal&quot; clause because these courses were not offered in high schools for black students. To avoid integration, an out-of-court proposal was made to the Baltimore School Board to start an equivalent &quot;A&quot; Course at the &quot;colored&quot; (for non-whites) of Frederick Douglass High School. This hearing on the &quot;Douglass&quot; plan lasted for hours, with longtime Poly Principal Dehuff and others arguing that separate but equal &quot;A&quot; Courses would satisfy constitutional requirements and NAACP attorney Thurgood Marshall (soon to be later famous appointed Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court in 1967), arguing that the plan was a gamble and additional cost that the city should not take. By a vote of 5–3, the board decided that a separate &quot;A&quot; course would not provide the same educational opportunities for African American students, and that, starting that fall, African American students could attend Poly. The vote vindicated the NAACP national strategy of raising the economic cost of &#x27;separate but equal&#x27; schools beyond what taxpayers and their government bureaucracy were willing to pay. Thirteen African American students, Leonard Cephas, Carl Clark, William Clark, Milton Cornish, Clarence Daly, Victor Dates, Alvin Giles, Bucky Hawkins, Linwood Jones, Edward Savage, Everett Sherman, Robert Young, and Silas Young, finally entered the Polytechnic Institute that fall. They were unfortunately faced daily with racial epithets, threats of violence and isolation from many of the more than 2,000 fellow students then at the school on North Avenue. But they endured, kept their cool and composure, knowing what was at stake. The first of those students to graduate from Poly was Dr. Carl O. Clark in June 1955. Dr. Clark went on to become the first African-American to graduate from the University of South Carolina with a degree in physics in 1976.

=== Modern campus (1960s–present) ===

In September 1967, after a multi-year planning and construction project, then-fifth principal Claude Burkert (1958–1969) oversaw the relocation of his school after 54 years at North Avenue and Calvert Street to its current location at 1400 West Cold Spring Lane, a fifty-three-acre tract of land bordering the 
Jones Falls stream to the west (and adjacent elevated Jones Falls Expressway (Interstate 83) and with Falls Road (Maryland Route 25} and the heights of the Roland Park residential planned community from the 1890s to the east along Cold Spring Lane, and to the south is the Hampden and Woodberry neighborhoods. Further to the north along Falls Road is the Village of Cross Keys shopping mall and planned residential community also developed during the 1960s by the noted James Rouse.

At the time of the 1965–1967 building of the &quot;New Poly-Western&quot;, it was considered one of the largest and most expensive school construction projects in the nation up to that time. A century before, this site along the Jones Falls was occupied by earthworks fortifications for the Union Army, then militarily occupying Southern-sympathizing Baltimore City during the American Civil War.

Also occupying this site on its east side facing Falls Road is the new Western High School, an all-girls school founded in 1844.

Notable buildings on the B.P.I. campus include Dehuff Hall, also known formerly as the Academic Hall building, named for the longtime fourth principal where students attend normal classes, and Burkert Hall, also previously called the Engineering Hall building, remembering the fifth principal, where students attend classes in the Willard Hackerman Engineering Program. (Hackerman, a noted Poly alumnus and local / regional engineering / construction firm founder). Both Western High girls and Poly students make use of the auditorium/cafeteria complex in-between the two high schools, and likewise share the swimming pool and sports fields. Although the two schools share these facilities, their respective academic programs and classrooms are completely separate from one another.

In 1974 after some controversy and a local court case, the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute officially became coeducational when it began admitting female students for the first time in almost 90 years. The first female to enroll and successfully graduate from the &quot;A&quot; Course was an African-American named Cindy White (1974–1978).

Coincidentally five years later, rival Baltimore City College, also with an all-boys student body since its founding in 1839, also admitted girls, becoming co-educational in 1979 after undergoing a major two-years long $10 million dollars renovation / reconstruction project and academic reorganization and revitalization program at its landmark &quot;Castle on the Hill&quot; 1922–1928 edifice on &quot;Collegian Hill&quot; at 33rd Street and The Alameda.

In the late 1980s the title &quot;principal&quot; of the Polytechnic Institute was changed to &quot;director.&quot; After the retirement of Director John Dohler in 1990, Barbara Stricklin became the first woman to head the &quot;magnet&quot; high school, as she accepted the title of Interim Director.
During Director Ian Cohen&#x27;s tenure (1994–2003), Poly&#x27;s curriculum was again expanded when it began offering Advanced placement (A.P.) classes. During the 2001–2002 school year, Poly was recognized by the Maryland State Department of Education when it was named a &quot;Blue Ribbon School of Excellence.&quot; In 2011, Poly was ranked 1552 nationally and 44 in Maryland as a &quot;Silver Medal School&quot; by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; magazine.

In 2004, Dr. Barney Wilson, a 1976 Poly graduate, became Baltimore Polytechnic Institute&#x27;s first African-American director. Following his six years tenure in August 2010, assistant principal Matthew Woolston, was appointed interim director. Later on during that academic year, Jacqueline Williams was appointed as interim director for the subsequent 2011–2012 school year. By the end of that term – and after a parallel two-year, nationwide search – Williams became the first female director of the Polytechnic Institute. Williams had worked her way through the Poly ranks from student (Class of 1981), to faculty as teacher, then department head, to assistant principal, and to dean of students, before appointment to her position as B.P.I. director. Recently during the 2022–2023 school year, it was announced that Ms. Williams would be retiring after 12 years as Poly&#x27;s academic head. In June 2023, another Poly alum, Mark Sawyer was named director, a position he holds to this day.

== Academics ==
Poly is a longtime &quot;magnet school&quot; for over 141 years, with specialized courses drawing students from across Baltimore&#x27;s regular district boundaries in the Baltimore City Public Schools system (including a number of additional students from surrounding suburban counties in Maryland paying supplemental tuition). Admission to the Polytechnic Institute is highly competitive. Course concentrations include: the &quot;Honors S.T.E.M. Program&quot;; the &quot;Ingenuity Project&quot; offering advanced science, math, and academic research courses; &quot;AP Capstone&quot; emphasizing Social Sciences and Humanities; Computer Science; and the United States Air Force-sponsored Air Force Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps (JROTC). In its 2019 nationwide survey of STEM programs spanning 2015–2019, &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazine ranked Poly No. 36 among U.S. high schools.

== Athletics ==

In addition to the school&#x27;s football program, Poly&#x27;s sports include basketball, soccer, cross-country, track and field, lacrosse, baseball, hockey, swimming, tennis, volleyball, and wrestling. The boys&#x27; basketball team won three state championship titles in a row between 2016 and 2019. The Poly &quot;Engineers&quot; baseball team has won nine Baltimore City championships since 2005 under head coach Corey Goodwin.

=== Football ===
Since the early 1900s the &quot;Engineers&quot; of the Polytechnic Institute, along with longtime arch-rival The Baltimore City College&#x27;s, &quot;Collegians&quot; / &quot;Black Knights&quot; had dominated the old public – private schools athletic league of the Maryland Scholastic Association (M.S.A.) which existed 1919 to 1993 in the local prep sports scene. However, since joining the newer state-wide Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA – founded 1946) in 1993, Poly made it to the final playoff football game once in 1993, the semi-finals once in 1997 and the quarterfinals in 1994 and 1998.

==== Poly and City ====
The Poly-City football rivalry is the oldest American football rivalry in Maryland and one of the oldest public school rivalries in the United States.—predated by the longtime also famous athletic and academic rivalry between the two New England secondary schools dated back to 1887 between the Boston Latin School (founded 1635, considered colonial America&#x27;s oldest public school) and the English High School of Boston (founded 1821, considered the oldest public high school in America). The second oldest public high school in the country is considered to be the Central High School of Philadelphia, founded 1836, all of which with traditions, curriculum admissions standards and famous faculty and alumni similar to its predecessors in Boston and subsequent followers further south in Baltimore.

The rivalry here in &quot;The Monumental City&quot; began in the Autumn of 1889, when a team from The Baltimore City College (&quot;City&quot; &quot;Collegians&quot;) then situated at North Howard and West Centre Streets since 1875 with its first structure of two (which unfortunately collapsed in August 1892 because of undermining from construction of the underground Howard Street Tunnel bypassing congested Downtown Baltimore for the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad). After seven years of temporary exile in a former elementary school building they returned again to the same site at Howard and Centre to a new larger home followed in 1899, remaining there although increasingly overcrowded until the move to the &quot;Castle&quot; in 1928. The City College is reputed to be the third oldest public high school / secondary school in the nation, established 1839. and had unofficial student teams playing rugby and various earlier versions of American football starting back in the 1870s. Meanwhile, the B.M.T.S. / B.P.I. was in its also cramped quarters on Courtland Street (today&#x27;s Saint Paul Street / Place / &quot;Preston Gardens&quot; site) and both public secondary schools in those days were with no campus or athletic fields, so forced to use nearby municipal parks like newly purchased Clifton or older Patterson or Druid Hill Parks. The two teams from neighboring all-boys high schools which were seven blocks apart in Downtown Baltimore, met in the new municipal Clifton Park (of the late noted Baltimore merchant / banker / philanthropist Johns Hopkins (1795–1873) summer / country estate and mansion &quot;Clifton&quot;) against a team of &quot;scrubs&quot; from the new Baltimore Manual Training School (the future renamed Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (&quot;Poly&quot;) four years later in 1893), then located on the northeast corner of the former Courtland / now St. Paul Street and East Saratoga Street in Downtown Baltimore. It has continued annually every Fall season in numerous locations, parks and fields, most notably at the new Homewood Field of the &quot;Blue Jays&quot; of The Johns Hopkins University at their new spacious campus off North Charles Street and University Parkway, where they moved in 1914. City leads the series with the record standing at 66–62–6.

Little is known of the first American football game between the Manual Training School ancestor of the Baltimore Polytechnic Institute (&quot;Poly&quot;) and The Baltimore City College (&quot;City&quot;) in the Fall of 1889, (no mention in the several Baltimore daily newspapers back then) except that a junior varsity team from Poly met City&#x27;s &quot;scrubs&quot;, in the newly purchased Clifton Park in the northeast section of the old Baltimore City and that City emerged the victor for the next decade and a half, as the B.C.C. was then playing an ambitious schedule then against several regional colleges / universities opponents and played in a regional football league composed of upper levels of higher education in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. That began the oldest football rivalry in Maryland schools, the region and the nation, City&#x27;s &quot;Collegians&quot; continued to win regularly against upstart Poly through 1901, however in 1902, for the only time in history of the series no game was played; though, in 1931, an extra game was played to compensate. Between 1903 and 1906, City won the series, but the tide soon turned in 1907, when the first tie in the 18th match of the series occurred. The next year in the 19th clash in 1908, Poly scored its first victory in the almost two decades long athletic rivalry now gaining widespread popularity and following among Baltimore sports fans and publicity in the sports pages of the several daily papers in town.

Poly dominated the series in the subsequent 1910s. The only year of that decade that City won was 1912, and between 1914 and 1917, Poly shut out City. Poly&#x27;s streak continued through 1921, completing a nine-year winning streak, which City finally broke in 1922 with a 27–0 victory. During this time for the next three decades, many P.-C. games would be played at the newly built football bowl of Municipal Stadium (a.k.a. the Baltimore Stadium or as Venable Park Stadium on the north side of the newly landscaped 33rd Street boulevard in the former Venable Park, seating almost 100,000 and constructed in six months in a crash-program during 1923. It would serve the city and visiting college teams like Army (West Point) and Navy (Annapolis), Maryland (College Park), Notre Dame and others. In 1946 with the peace after World War II, it was the site also of the first professional football team in town, the first incarnation of the Baltimore Colts in the new All America Football Conference and then followed into the later merger with the National Football League in 1950. Old Municipal Stadium endured up to 1949 housing both minor league Baltimore Orioles of the International League when their old home of Oriole Park (the fifth one, built 1914 originally as Terrapin Park for the Baltimore Terrapins of the short-lived Federal League) on Greenmount Avenue and 29th Street in nearby Waverly neighborhood burned down in a spectacular blaze after the Fourth of July in 1944 and the two pro football Colts franchises when a multi-year project began in 1949 reconstructing, expanding and adding an upper deck to become the new Memorial Stadium reopening in the Spring of 1954 to greet the new Major League Baseball team in the American League of the transplanted new Baltimore Orioles, moving from St. Louis (as the former lackluster St, Louis Browns).

At the same time Poly-City football continued there on 33rd Street also moved into the new rebuilt athletic bowl continuing holding annual gridiron renewals of sports combat here attracting crowds of 30 to 40,000 fans in the pre-national sports franchises era, continuing on 33rd until the 1990s. Scheduled on Thanksgiving Day afternoons and with traditional students, cheerleaders, floats and teams parades west from City&#x27;s &quot;Castle&quot; and north from old Poly on North Avenue were popular. Plus tailgating in the surrounding old stadium parking lots and checking out the earlier activities of the morning football game between Roman Catholic high schools Calvert Hall and Loyola.

In 1926, was one of the most famous Poly-City games ever played. Prior to the game, the eligibility of City&#x27;s halfback, Mickey Noonen, was challenged. A committee was formed to investigate Noonen&#x27;s eligibility, but Noonen&#x27;s father—frustrated with the investigation—struck one of the members of the committee. The result was that Noonen was not only barred from the &quot;Collegians&quot; team, but also expelled from the Baltimore City Public Schools system. The 1930s ushered in a period of resurgence for the City &quot;Castlemen&quot; team, now ensconced in their new spacious hilltop campus of &quot;Collegian Hill&quot; at 33rd and The Alameda and the landmark &quot;Castle on the Hill&quot; since 1928. Poly, which had dominated in the previous two decades, only picked up two wins in the entire decade.

In 1934, B.P.I. student Harry Lawrence, who had famously kicked the winning field goal against City in the 1926 fall classic, later became the head coach at his former arch-rival City College leading to some of its most winningest seasons and success stories in the following decade and subsequently joining the B.C.C. faculty as a longtime guidance counselor from the &#x27;30s into the 1970s, becoming a &quot;Castle&quot; legend and only Poly alumnus inducted into the B.C.C. Hall of Fame.

It was during these times that the longtime local afternoon daily newspaper &quot;The Evening Sun&quot; (published 1910–1995, part of the three published papers of &quot;The Baltimore Sunpapers&quot; (with the morning paper &quot;The Sun&quot; begun 1837)) from the A.S. Abell &amp; Company commissioned a bronze statue of a crouched football player on a mahogany wood base known as &quot;The Evening Sun Trophy&quot; and several were made over the next half century with each school keeping it for showing off in the exhibit glass cases in the following year in the Poly &quot;Memorial Corridor&quot; or City&#x27;s central &quot;Trophy Hall&quot;, and being retired after a number of victories. Several were made over the decades and each school still has some on display as cherished historical icons of past glories.

Colorful printed program booklets were published annually by a joint Poly-City student / faculty committee packed with supporter advertising front and back with team group photos and rosters, player / coach biographies and photos plus the administration, page of City and Poly songs and cheers, photos of each school building and school seals, lists of the previous years of scores of victories and defeats. These now prized collector&#x27;s items began in the early 1920s and continued up to the mid-1970s. Special thick editions of the two student newspapers &quot;The Poly Press&quot; (founded 1922) and &quot;The Collegian&quot; (established 1929). They were also packed with advertising from local commercial businesses and ads from various homeroom / classes, organizations, clubs and individuals. Plus &quot;The Collegian&quot; was printed on orange newsprint paper to match the black ink for their school colors of &quot;The Black &amp; Orange&quot;. They frequently continued the fun tradition of making up a replica humorous satire of the opponent&#x27;s student paper so memorable versions appeared of &quot;The Folly Mess&quot; (subtitled &quot;A Folly institution since A.D. 922&quot;) reporting on the dire terrible situation at the &quot;Baltimore Follytechnique Institution&quot; and equally hilarious &quot;The Collitchin&quot; (with its twisted slogan &quot;serving the student morons of the Baltimore Seedy Collage&quot;) of the awful horrible climate at the &quot;Dump on the Hump&quot; and making fun of the other&#x27;s administration, faculty, coaches, collapsing decrepit buildings, worthless diplomas and failed education good only for future criminal successes!!!

Poly won five straight games against City to open the 1950s, and 9 of the decade&#x27;s 10 games, under its legendary coach Bob Lumsden, for whom the school&#x27;s current football stadium is now named. Lumsden finished with an 11–7 record against City when he retired as &quot;Engineers&quot; head coach in 1966. He also coached 9–0 Poly to the unofficial National High School Championship Game at Miami, Florida&#x27;s huge landmark Orange Bowl stadium in 1962, against the Miami High School &quot;Stingarees&quot;, but Poly lost by a score of 14–6.

With both secondary schools packed to almost 4,000 male students each because of the post-Second World War &quot;baby boom&quot; plus slowness in new construction and were heavily overcrowded, sometimes operating on split -shifts, but the scholastic sports programs continued to prosper, strive and inspire generations of Poly and City boys.

The &quot;Blue and Orange&quot; team&#x27;s fortunes changed later in the 1960s, when City was coached during the decade by their legendary coach George Young. Young (a Calvert Hall alumnus, City College history teacher and future Baltimore Colts front office executive and later to lead the New York Giants pro football team and finish his sports career as an NFL executive), guided his &quot;Black Knights&quot; teams to six wins over Poly, and an equal number of the old Maryland Scholastic Association (M.S.A.) &quot;A Conference&quot; championships. One of Young&#x27;s most memorable victories occurred on Thanksgiving Day, 1965, at the old Memorial Stadium on 33rd Street, when undefeated City&#x27;s &quot;Black Knights&quot; beat the also previously undefeated Poly &quot;Engineers&quot; by the largest margin score ever, 52–6.

Baltimore City&#x27;s public high schools withdrew in 1993 from the old Maryland Scholastic Association, a unique public / private / independent and parochial schools athletic league in central Maryland, organized in 1919, and joined the newer larger statewide Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association (MPSSAA), organized in 1946. This was mandated by a new Superintendent of Schools who had earlier spent his career in the neighboring suburban Baltimore County public schools system who were original charter members of the competing MPSSAA which had grown in the postwar period and he wanted the City schools to participate in the statewide playoffs tournaments in the various sports (with championship games played at the large venues of Byrd Stadium and Cole Fieldhouse arena at the University of Maryland at College Park, northwest of Washington, D.C. in suburban Prince George&#x27;s County or later in other large state public universities / colleges). This change meant that the scholastic football season would end earlier to allow for the beginning of state-wide playoffs in the M.P.S.S.A.A., forcing Poly and City to move their annual century-old game in 1994 from its longtime traditional holiday date for decades of Thanksgiving Day holiday afternoon to the less memorable first Saturday in November, and a subsequent loss of high attendance, publicity and media coverage with occasional radio / television broadcasts. They also missed playing with the longtime holiday double-header tradition with the morning &quot;Catholic Game&quot; at the 33rd Street stadium between Roman Catholic high schools&#x27; similar arch-rivalry between Calvert Hall College (&quot;Cardinals&quot;) versus Loyola High School at Blakefield (&quot;Dons&quot;), played since 1920 (now in their 104th game).

Then Poly and City met for the 119th time in November 2007, a contest unfortunately marred by the outbreak of a large brawl outside the new M&amp;T Bank Stadium, southwest of downtown where the annual Fall Football Classic for the oldest public and Catholic high schools had been relocated in the redeveloped Camden Yards Sports Complex (built 1996 for the new moved franchise from the Cleveland Browns to become the new Baltimore Ravens pro football team in the NFL). The time before and during the game was peaceful and fun, but trouble and strife occurred after the final whistle. This was the first documented trouble at the Fall Classic since the early 1970s. With games first being played at old Municipal / Baltimore Stadium, the first built 1923 on 33rd Street&#x27;s Venable Park. Violence had occasionally occurred near a century before and marred the old City-Poly traditions during the 1920s, but happened elsewhere from the stadium on downtown streets with competing colliding school fans parades. Both governor&#x27;s and mayor&#x27;s sons from opposing schools were arrested amid the street riots melees. Four decades later, some more serious strife recurred during the socially tumultuous late 1960s era and early &#x27;70s outside old Memorial Stadium (rebuilt 1949–54) on the northside of 33rd Street with huge crowds of over 30,000 fans filling up two-thirds of the bowl. But it had been generally peaceful ever since those times of national unrest with racial summer urban riots and anti-Vietnam War and the military draft protests. Things quieted down specially with the traditions begun first in the 1940s and &#x27;50s of a &quot;City – Poly Peace Pact&quot; signing by the two secondary schools student leaders with media coverage at the Mayor&#x27;s ceremonial office at the historic Baltimore City Hall, and its later renewal in the late &#x27;60s.

Now Poly and City still met for the 120th time on November 8, 2008, with guarded anticipation and some added security plus an intensive discussion program at both schools the several weeks before. The Baltimore Polytechnic Institute and The Baltimore City College then met subsequently peacefully again for the 121st time on November 7, 2009, with the score of 26–20. The renewed tradition again continued with Poly&quot;s &quot;Engineers&quot; and City&#x27;s &quot;Collegians&quot; / &quot;Black Knights&quot; meeting for the 122nd time on November 6, 2010. As of the 2018 game, City had won the prior and trophy in 7 contests.

Because of the extreme large size of the downtown Camden Yards football stadium with two-thirds of the place with empty purple and black Ravens seats empty, the site was changed to the more cozy smaller Hughes Stadium at the Morgan State University in the northeast city but still able to accommodate a larger than usual football crowd, while the Calvert Hall-Loyola game still continued on Thanksgiving Day morning (grabbing all the media attention) moved to the Johnny Unitas Stadium at Towson University north of town and between those two Catholic schools home campuses in Towson.

<text>Newton North High School, formerly Newton High School, is the larger and longer-established of two public high schools in Newton, Massachusetts, United States, the other being Newton South High School. It is located in the village of Newtonville. The school from 2009 to 2010 underwent controversial reconstruction of its facility, making it one of the largest and most expensive high schools ever built in the United States, with a price tag of nearly $200 million. The new building opened for classes in September 2010.

==History==
In the 1850s, high school classes in Newton were conducted in buildings shared with grammar schools in the villages of Newton Centre, West Newton, Upper Falls, and Newton Corner. In 1859, Newton&#x27;s population topped 8,000 residents for the first time, a threshold that required the town under Massachusetts state law to construct a separate high school. Newton High School&#x27;s first principal was J.N. Beals, for whom the current Beals House was named. Beals also served as one of the new school&#x27;s two teachers, along with Amy Breck. Beals left the job for health reasons after only one year and was replaced by E.D. Adams, for whom the current Adams House was named.

The first Newton High School building, located on Walnut Street in Newtonville, opened in September 1859, and was modified in 1875. In 1898, the original building was replaced with a new building, also on Walnut Street. This building, the Classical Newton High School, eventually became known as Building I. The next building (Building II, circa 1906) was the Vocational High School, and the third building of the Newton High School complex (Building III) opened in 1926 on Walnut Street. A field house/gymnasium building (also known as &quot;the drill shed&quot;), adjacent to Building I, was also part of the complex, as were the athletic fields. Buildings I, II, and III were connected to each other via a series of maintenance tunnels. Newton High School was Newton&#x27;s only public high school for more than 100 years until 1960, when Newton South High School opened.

Newton High School was renamed Newton North High School in 1973 when a new building opened on Lowell Avenue. The first graduating class as &quot;Newton North High School&quot; was in the spring of 1974. After Newton North was built, all of the former &quot;Newton High School&quot; buildings were demolished.

=== Reconstruction ===
By 2003, the &quot;old&quot; Newton North building was 30 years old and aging poorly, with leaks, poor ventilation and crumbling stairs. After extensive community debate and a citizen review panel, a decision was reached to construct a replacement high school, with the final cost ultimately totaling $197.5 million, making it one of the most expensive high schools ever built in the state. A project consultant explained that the project&#x27;s relatively high cost was partly due to demolition of the existing building, hazardous material abatement in the existing building (asbestos had been found in the building as early as 1977). and the new school&#x27;s complex program, which includes a natatorium, vocational technology education program, and culinary arts facilities.

At a public hearing in June 2006, community residents criticized the plan for its cost and for creating a new four-way intersection at Walnut Street and Trowbridge Avenue. Others claimed the proposed north–south orientation and lack of a basement level would waste energy as compared to the current structure. Nonetheless, after a public referendum and vote in January 2007, Newton residents approved the current plan for a new building.

Gund Partnership designed the new building, and Dore and Whittier Architects was the Architect of Record. Dimeo Construction Company was the construction manager and general contractor for the project. The removal of the asbestos, laden throughout the existing building, was priced at $10 million. The building was dismantled, with contaminated construction debris packaged in lined cardboard boxes and shipped out in 650 trailer loads.

The new building is oriented on a north–south axis on the eastern side of the current lot, with athletic fields to the west and a soccer field on the east side. The main entrance has returned to Walnut Street, as was the case from 1859 to 1973. The new building places the school office in a more accessible location – it was on the third floor in the old building – and ensures that most classrooms have natural light and windows to the outside.

The school incorporates many features that improve energy efficiency, and is among the first LEED-certified schools in the state. Green features include rooftop solar panels, systems to reuse rainwater, interior materials with low emission of volatile organic compounds, and occupancy motion sensors. Unlike the previous school building, where 50 percent of the classrooms did not have windows or access to daylight, classrooms in the new school receive natural light; light fixtures are dimmed based on the amount of daylight to conserve energy. In 2020, solar canopies were constructed over the main parking lots.

==House system==
The school is divided into administrative units called &quot;Houses&quot;. Each has its own office, secretary, and Dean (formerly &quot;Housemaster&quot;), who deals with administrative and disciplinary matters for house students. The House system was designed to provide better communication, distributed administration, more personal attention to individuals, a smaller peer group for students, more practical social events, and intra-house athletic teams. The houses are Adams, Barry, Beals and Riley, with each year group occupying one house. In the period of its largest population (≈3,000 students in the 1960s and later), there were six houses – the two additional houses being Bacon and Palmer – which also contained student common rooms and teachers&#x27; lounges. Originally, students in the same class were broken up into different houses; now the four houses correspond to the four grade levels. Students remain in the same house throughout their four years at Newton North. Houses are named for notable former principals, such as J.N. Beals and E.D. Adams.

==Academics==
Newton North offers both traditional college-preparatory academic courses along with technical and vocational training. Traditional courses in the humanities and the sciences are streamed, often with College Prep, Advanced College Prep, Honors and Advanced Placement options. Starting with the 2014–2015 school year, course levels were renamed to College Prep (formerly CII), Advanced College Prep (formerly (CI), and Honors/Advanced Placement (no change). Non-standard courses include video production, architecture, automobile repair, and biodiesel production.

Currently there are 5 levels of Classes; No Level, College Prep (CP), Advanced College Prep (ACP), and Honors(H). Additionally for some classes there is Advanced Placement(AP) that falls under the Honors unbrella, additionally there is an Accelerated form of ACP that is only found in the Mathematics department.

Newton North held the sixth position in &quot;Boston Magazine&quot;″s 2010 rankings of public high schools.

===Greengineering===
During the academic year of 2009/2010 a Greengineering course was added in the Career and Tech. Ed. Department at Newton North High School. The course taught students how to produce biodiesel, make fused plastic bags, and grow algae that would later be processed into fuel. The biodiesel was sold to a recycling company as well as the community at large. This program was the first of its kind in both Massachusetts and the United States. Greengineering was renewed for the academic year of 2010/2011 with additions to curriculum for Greengineering 101 and a new Greengineering 201 course. They had started creating a styrofoam type material using mycelium. They planned to use it to replace the need for non-green styrofoam and to create a surfboard made of fiberglass-coated mycelium. During the 2016–2017 school year, Greengineering had multiple new subject areas including pedal power and aquaponics. However, in the beginning of the 2018 school year, Greengineering came to an end and was replaced with a new Sustainability course.

===Partnerships and exchanges===
Students studying foreign languages have the opportunity to participate in one of several international exchange programs. In addition, Newton North participates in the Newton-Beijing Jingshan School Exchange Program. The city of Newton hosts students and teachers for four months each fall and sends students and teachers to Beijing each spring.

==Extracurriculars==

===Clubs and societies===
Competitive clubs at the school include History Team, Model United Nations, Mock Trial Team, Debate Team, Mathematics Team, Science Team, and a FIRST Robotics Competition team: The LigerBots 2877. Newton North&#x27;s Science Team has entered national and regional competitions. Newton North&#x27;s History Team is ranked within the top half of teams, nationally, and has won several regional history bees.

In the 2011–12 school year, the science team placed first at MIT Trivia, Envirothon, and JETS. In 1993 the team&#x27;s Science Bowl division won the state championship and placed 3rd nationally. They won the Science Olympiad State competition in 1995, 2004, 2007, 2008, and 2009, and have represented Massachusetts at the national competition.

In the 2013–14 school year, the LigerBots won the WPI District Competition, were finalists at the Northeastern University District Competition, and placed for the FIRST Championship in St. Louis. In the 2014–15 school year, the LigerBots were semi-finalists and Chairman&#x27;s Award winners at the UMass Dartmouth Competition, were finalists at the Northeastern competition, won the NE Regional Chairman&#x27;s award, and placed for the FIRST World Championship in St. Louis. In the 2015–2016 school year, the LigerBots won the Entrepreneurship Award at the WPI competition, as well as the Innovation in Control Award at both the Boston University District Competition and the New England District Championship competition. In the 2017–18 school year the team won the Imagery Award and Engineering Inspiration Award at the district level, and qualified for the FIRST World Championships.

The Chess Club has sent teams of four players to the tournament yearly for the past two decades. The school team won the championships in 2002, 2009, 2010, and 2012. In 2016 they placed second to two-time champions Lincoln-Sudbury Regional High School. In 2018, they once again placed second after losing in the final round to the eventual champions BBN, 1.5–2.5. The last time an individual player has won the state title was Jacob Fauman in 2012. The current school team has top 50 nationally ranked chess players in their age group and top 25 finishers at the last national grade championships. The club itself has USCF Club affiliation and a Club TD (who is a student), something that no other high school in Massachusetts has.

===Student publications===
Newton North publishes a monthly student newspaper, &quot;The Newtonite&quot;, founded in 1922. The paper has a circulation of 2000 issues. Students contribute to the paper through credited journalism courses. &quot;The Newtonite&quot; has won crowns from the Columbia Scholastic Press Association – the Gold Crown in 2001, and the Silver Crown in 2002 – among other scholastic journalism awards. Students also design and publish &quot;The Newtonian&quot;, the school&#x27;s yearbook, which printed its 101st edition in 2011. &quot;Thoughtprints&quot;, published once a year, is the school&#x27;s student-run literary magazine, featuring only student submissions. In 2010, the magazine included a CD of student-written music for the first time.

&quot;Tiger Magazine&quot; is Newton North&#x27;s video production class&#x27; monthly cable television program. It airs on Newton&#x27;s NewTV local cable station. The content of the program is generally a mixture of comedy pieces, news, and community based documentary, as well as experimental and dramatic video works. Several &quot;Tiger Magazine&quot; alumni have gone on to pursue careers in the film industry, and numerous pieces originally aired on &quot;Tiger Magazine&quot; have won awards in local and national video contests. Near the end of the 2011–2012 school year, the name of the show was changed to &quot;Tiger Tube&quot;. Post covid the Youtube show was renamed the NNUPDATE and switched to a bi monthly schedule.

===Athletics===

Newton North competes in the Bay State League with other suburban Boston public schools. Since 1894, the boys&#x27; football team has played rival Brookline High School in the traditional Thanksgiving Day game. This is one of the oldest high school football rivalries in Massachusetts.

Newton North offers football, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; soccer, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; track and cross country, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; basketball, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; volleyball, golf, baseball, softball, boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; lacrosse, field hockey, alpine skiing, Nordic skiing, tennis, and many other sports.

====Track and field====
The track teams at Newton North have remained some of the top teams in the state since the inception of state-level competition. Beginning with Newton High School&#x27;s first state title in 1922, the boys&#x27; track teams have won the Division I / Class A state championship 24 times outdoors and 15 times indoors, including Newton High School&#x27;s record streak of eight in a row (1952–1959). Massachusetts added an additional all-state meet including all divisions in the 1960s outdoors and 1980s indoors; Newton North has subsequently won all-state titles in 1977, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2013, 2016, 2017 and 2018. The 2004–05 season featured both Division I and All-State titles in cross-country, indoor track, and outdoor track which completed a &quot;Triple Crown&quot; of championships. That year also featured a victory at the Penn Relays in the high school distance medley championship, which was the first relay victory by a Massachusetts high school in almost 50 years. In 2011, the Newton North sprint medley relay team and its four members were named All-American by the National Scholastic Sports Foundation. Newton High/Newton North athletes have won a high school national title (Warren Wittens in the 1936 intermediate hurdles; Carla Forbes in 2012 in the long jump and triple jump; Nick Fofana in 2014 in the decathlon Andrew Mah in 2018 in the 5000), an NCAA title (Carl Shine in the 1959 shot put), and run a four-minute mile equivalent (Tom Carleo ran 3:41 for 1500 and competed at the 1988 Olympic trials).

The Newton North girls&#x27; track teams have had their share of championships as well and have consistently been one of the top high school track teams in the state, winning Division I / Class A titles in 1989, 1990, 1992, 1996, 1998, 2004, 2005, 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. Additionally, they captured the All-State title in 1990, 1992, 1998, 2004, 2005,2010, 2011, 2012, and 2013. Along with those successes, they won more than 40 Conference and League Championships in the past 22 years. Their top-scoring athlete at state competition, Tanya Jones, won eleven individual Division I championships in the 300, 400, high jump, and long jump, and is the only athlete from either Newton North or Newton South high schools to score over 100 points at the state division / class meet level. Post-high-school, distance star Liz Natale finished 2nd at the 1986 NCAA Division I championship in the 3000m and was an All-American six times for University of Texas. The program has also had dozens of Nike All-Americans and New Balance All-Americans over the past ten years.

====Other sports====

The girls&#x27; soccer team has won five Division 1 State Championships, in 1989, 1992, 1996, 1999, and 2013, ranking as one of the top teams in the country. The boys&#x27; basketball team won the 2005 and 2006 Division 1 State Championships, and is considered one of the state&#x27;s top basketball programs. They have captured the Bay State Championship five years in a row since 2004. The Newton North&#x27;s boys&#x27; gymnastics team won four consecutive state championships from 1997 to 2000.

The boys&#x27; lacrosse team won three state championships from the years 1992–1996, ranking as one of the top teams in the country. In 2005–06, the boys&#x27; football team won the Bay State league championship and went on to the Division 1A State Championship super bowl. In 2006 and 2007 the boys&#x27; volleyball team won the sectional title and went on to the Division 1 State Championship. In 2014, the boys&#x27; baseball team won the Division 1A state title by winning the first MIAA Super 8 state tournament. The girls&#x27; volleyball team won back-to-back state championships in 2017 and 2018, and in 2018 was honored by the MaxPreps Tour of Champions as one of the top 50 high school teams in the country.

In 2024, the boys&#x27; soccer team won the MIAA Division 1 State Championship, completing one of the most improbable Cinderella runs in Massachusetts high school sports history. Entering the 45-team state tournament as the 31st ranked team, the Tigers defeated the 34th, 2nd, 18th, 7th, 14th, and 8th ranked teams in that order, including three overtime or penalty shootout victories, capturing their first state title in program history.

===Theatre Ink===

Theatre Ink is Newton North&#x27;s theater department. Students work as directors, stage managers, student producers, and designers, and in backstage roles, in addition to onstage roles. All sets, lights, and sound for productions are designed, built, and operated by students. Theatre Ink uses two performance spaces, the Performing Arts Center, which is a standard proscenium theatre and seats approximately 600, and the little theatre, a roughly 200-seat theatre-in-the-round.

In 2016, Theatre Ink entered a production for the first time into the Massachusetts Educational Theatre Guild&#x27;s annual statewide theatrical competition. Theatre Ink entered its production of &quot;Oliver!&quot;, the musical based on the Charles Dickens novel &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;.

<doc id="913579" wikidata="Q7863485" url="?curid=913579" title="List of U.S. state reptiles">
<text>Twenty-eight U.S. states have named an official state reptile. As with other state symbols, states compare admirable aspects of the reptile and of the state, within designating statutes. Schoolchildren often start campaigns promoting their favorite reptile to encourage state legislators to enact it as a state symbol. Many secretaries of state maintain educational web pages that describe the state reptile.

Oklahoma was the first state to name an official reptile, the common collared lizard, in 1969. Only two states followed in the 1970s, but the ensuing decades saw nominations at a rate of almost one per year. State birds are more common, with all 50 states naming one, and they were adopted earlier, with the first one selected in 1927.

Before their formal designation as state reptiles, Florida&#x27;s alligator, Maryland&#x27;s terrapin, and Texas&#x27;s horned lizard were all mascots of a major in-state university. West Virginia&#x27;s timber rattlesnake was an early American flag element dating back to 1775.

Because of their cold-blooded nature, reptiles are more common in warmer climates, and 19 of the 28 state reptiles represent southern states. Six states chose a species named after the state. A turtle was chosen by more than half of the states. In all, the most frequently chosen species, with four states naming it, is the painted turtle. One state reptile, the bog turtle, is Critically endangered. The Alabama red-bellied turtle is legally designated as an endangered species in the United States, and several others, also turtles, are threatened at some lesser level.

==State reptiles== 

==Governmental aspects==

===Legislation===

A reptile becomes the official state symbol after it is voted in by the state legislature. Although many states require the bill to be signed by the governor, in some the enabling act is a resolution (legislature vote only). In 2004, Illinois held a popular vote to pick the painted turtle, but legislation was still required in 2005 to make the choice official.

Schoolchildren often start the campaigns for state reptiles. Three of the four states choosing the painted turtle credit school classes with initiating the process. The process may require students to be knowledgeable of their selection, as was the case in Florida when students advocated for the loggerhead sea turtle; &quot;Working with State Representative Curtis Richardson (D-Tallahassee), the students provided information and answered questions regarding the symbols.&quot; In New York, students statewide voted to pick one of four turtles; the common snapping turtle edged the painted turtle 5,048 to 5,005. Assemblyman Joel Miller had sponsored the turtle election to interest students in politics and said of the results, &quot;as with every election, every vote is important&quot;.

Candidate state reptiles are not assured of making it through the legislative process. In Minnesota, 1998 and 1999 bills proposing the Blanding&#x27;s turtle were unsuccessful. In Pennsylvania in 2009, the House passed an eastern box turtle bill which died in the Senate without a vote. Virginia proponents of the eastern box turtle have seen 1999 and 2009 bids fail. For the most recent attempt, a legislative opponent of the turtle said it was too cowardly for the state because of its defensive shell, and suggested the rattlesnake would be a better representative. The turtle also drew scorn for often perishing on roads, but its most serious problem was a too-close association with bordering state, North Carolina.

===Justification===

Like other state symbols, a state reptile is intended to show state pride. The designation has no economic or wildlife protection effect. States justify their choice of state reptiles, with differing rationales, in designating legislation and on websites:
* North Carolina selected the eastern box turtle because its behavior reflects admirable human ideals: &quot;The turtle watches undisturbed as countless generations of faster &#x27;hares&#x27; run by to quick oblivion, and is thus a model of patience for mankind, and a symbol of our State&#x27;s unrelenting pursuit of great and lofty goals.&quot;
* Maryland notes its historical associations with the diamondback terrapin: &quot;Chesapeake colonists ate terrapin prepared Native-American fashion, roasted whole in live coals. Abundant and easy to catch, terrapin were so ample that landowners often fed their slaves and indentured servants a staple diet of terrapin meat. Later, in the 19th century, the turtle was appreciated as gourmet food, especially in a stew laced with cream and sherry.&quot;
* Ohio touts the ubiquity and practical benefits of its reptile: &quot;The black racer snake was adopted because it is native to all 88 Ohio counties and is called the &#x27;farmer&#x27;s friend&#x27; because it eats disease-carrying rodents.&quot;
* Texas stresses the conservation needs of the Texas horned lizard: &quot;It is perhaps most appropriate for designation as an official state symbol because, like many other things truly Texan, it is a threatened species.&quot;

===Use===

The state reptile concept serves education. Some states offer lesson plans using the reptile for teachers to introduce children to the legislative process, discuss state geography, or develop state patriotism. Many Secretaries of State have a &quot;kids page&quot; describing the reptile. Some, such as Missouri&#x27;s Robin Carnahan, tout state-provided coloring books.

==Rate of adoption and comparison to other symbols==

In 1969, Oklahoma designated the first state reptile when it chose the common collared lizard or &quot;mountain boomer&quot;. Two states followed suit in the 1970s, seven states in the 1980s, eight states in the 1990s, and eight states in the 2000s. As of March 2019, twenty-eight of the fifty states have named a state reptile; Utah and New Jersey both adopted an official state repitile in the 2010s.

In contrast to state reptiles, state birds have been more rapidly adopted, with the first state designating one in 1927 and the fiftieth in 1973. As of January 2011, other types of animals more popular for state symbolization were mammals (46), fish (45), and insects (42). Animal symbols less popular than reptiles were butterflies (17), amphibians (17), dogs (11), dinosaurs (5), bats (3), and crustaceans (3).

In their almanac of U.S. state symbols, Benjamin and Barbara Shearer spend comparatively little text on state reptiles. They spend a full chapter each on state birds, trees and flowers; within those chapters, they take about a half page to describe the campaign to establish each state&#x27;s specific symbol. Reptiles, on the other hand, are shown only in list format in a chapter titled &quot;Miscellaneous&quot;, where the other non-bird animals (and many non-animals) are listed. Shearer and Shearer consider the state reptiles to be part of a &quot;last thirty years&quot; phenomenon (written in 2003) that includes such particular items as a state&#x27;s &quot;official beverage&quot;.

==Geography==

Perhaps owing to the greater presence of cold-blooded (ectothermic) reptiles in warmer climates, the states in the southern half of the United States have more commonly designated a state reptile. From the twenty-four of the contiguous states roughly south of the Mason–Dixon line, only four lack a state reptile. From east to west, they are Delaware, Virginia, Kentucky, and Arkansas.

In contrast, in the north half of the central and western states, only one, Wyoming, has named a state reptile. In the Great Lakes region, there is a cluster of three states (Illinois, Michigan, and Ohio) that named a reptile. In the Northeast, there is another cluster of three participating states (Massachusetts, New York, and Vermont).

Neither of the noncontiguous states, Alaska and Hawaii, have named a state reptile. The District of Columbia lacks a state reptile although it does have an official tree, flower, bird, fish, amphipod, and bat, and an amphibian is under consideration. None of the organized territories of the United States have state reptiles, although all four have designated official flowers.

Six states chose reptiles named after the state. In common names, Arizona and Texas were represented by the Arizona ridge-nosed rattlesnake and Texas horned lizard. Mississippi and North Carolina appeared in scientific names: &quot;Alligator mississippiensis&quot; and &quot;Terrapene carolina carolina&quot;. Alabama and New Mexico appeared in both common names (Alabama red-bellied turtle and New Mexico whiptail lizard) and scientific names (&quot;Pseudemys alabamensis&quot; and &quot;Cnemidophorus neomexicanus&quot;).

==Previous symbology==

===Politics===

Although there is no official reptile of the United States, some of the state reptiles have had previous appearances in American politics. In particular, the timber rattlesnake (West Virginia) has had close association with American independence.

A United States flag with a timber rattlesnake predates the stars and stripes flag. In 1775, Christopher Gadsden developed an emblem with a coiled rattlesnake with the words &quot;Don&#x27;t tread on me&quot; on a yellow background. Versions of the Gadsden flag were used by the Continental Navy&#x27;s first commodore, early Marines, and minutemen and regular army units in Virginia, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Massachusetts.

The timber rattlesnake is also famous for appearing on the First Navy Jack, a red and white striped flag. However, although traditionally believed to have been used by the Continental Navy, recent scholarship asserts that the snake on that jack was a late 19th-century invention. Nevertheless, in 1975, the U.S. Navy brought back the traditional (snake-showing) jack for the service&#x27;s bicentennial. After 1980, the oldest commissioned vessel in the U.S. Navy was designated to use the traditional jack. Since 2002, in response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the U.S. Navy has all its ships using the First Navy Jack.

West Virginia named the timber rattlesnake as its state reptile in 2008. A 2009 article, &quot;West Virginia&#x27;s state reptile&quot;, in the state wildlife magazine drew a connection to the older American rattlesnake symbol:

Actually, the warning on the early flags was not meant to depict the timber rattlesnake as being ferocious or the American people as being warlike. The true message was that the citizens of the Colonies were a peaceable and freedom-loving people, but if England&#x27;s King George III continued with his oppressive policies toward the Colonies, then they would respond with great wrath. This response would be much like that of a timber rattlesnake, which is peaceable and slow to anger, but will attack aggressively when provoked and will not stop fighting until the enemy retreats.

Benjamin Franklin, writing as an anonymous person, submitted the following statement concerning the disposition of the timber rattlesnake to the Pennsylvania Journal in 1775: &quot;She never begins an attack, nor, when once engaged, ever surrenders: She is therefore an emblem of magnanimity and true courage...she never wounds ‘till she has generously given notice, even to her enemy, and cautioned him against the danger of treading on her.&quot;
In contrast to the positive symbology of the rattlesnake, some political use has been for criticism. The snapping turtle (New York) was the central feature of a famous American political cartoon. Published in 1808 in Federalist protest of the Jeffersonian Embargo Act of 1807, the cartoon showed a snapping turtle, jaws locked fiercely to the rear of an American trader, who was attempting to carry a barrel of goods onto a British ship. The trader was seen whimsically uttering the words &quot;Oh! this cursed Ograbme&quot; (the backwards spelling of &quot;embargo&quot;). Also, during the Great Depression, the gopher tortoise (Georgia, Florida&#x27;s official tortoise) was known as the &quot;Hoover chicken&quot; (a sarcastic reference to President Herbert Hoover) because it was eaten by poor people out of work.

===Athletics===

Three states chose reptiles that were already prominently associated with a major university in the state:

*Florida honored the American alligator in 1987, but the Gators have titled the University of Florida&#x27;s teams since 1911. In that year, a printer made a spur-of-the-moment decision to print an alligator emblem on a shipment of the schools football pennants; the mascot stuck, perhaps because the team captain&#x27;s nickname was Gator.
*Maryland honored the diamondback terrapin in 1994, but the mascot of Maryland&#x27;s main state university in College Park has been the Terrapins or &quot;Terps&quot; since 1932. In that year, the football coach, who had encountered the animal as a boy near the Chesapeake Bay, proposed it as a mascot to oppose the Wildcats, Tigers, and such of enemy teams.
*Texas honored the Texas horned lizard in 1993, but private Texas Christian University has had the associated mascot the Horned Frog since 1896. According to legend, the football team identified with the lizards found on the practice field as the athletes and reptiles were similarly scrappy. The college founder&#x27;s son, Addison Clark Jr., a faculty member and the initiator of the football team, had been fascinated by the creatures. By 1897, the lizard appeared as a logo on the front of the school yearbook, which Clark had also started and was managing.

==Biology==

In terms of common divisions of reptiles, turtles are most popular. Fifteen of the twenty-seven states give them official status. The rest of the state reptiles comprise four snakes, five lizards, and three crocodilians. Eighteen states name a reptile at the species level, two a genus, and seven a subspecies.

The species most frequently adopted as a state reptile is the painted turtle, with four states designating it: Colorado (the western subspecies), Illinois, Michigan, and Vermont. Three southern states—Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi—represent themselves with the American alligator. A species of box turtle, &quot;Terrapene carolina&quot; or common box turtle, has been chosen by three states, with North Carolina and Tennessee using the &quot;Terrapene carolina carolina&quot; (eastern box turtle) subspecies, and with Missouri using the &quot;Terrapene carolina triungus&quot; (three-toed box turtle) subspecies. Two bordering western states, California and Nevada, chose the desert tortoise. The loggerhead sea turtle was named by South Carolina as state reptile, while Florida chose it as state &quot;saltwater&quot; reptile. Florida also named an official tortoise, the gopher tortoise, the same animal as Georgia&#x27;s state reptile.

Four genera are represented with different species in the list. &quot;Terrapene&quot; (box turtles) has &quot;Terrapene ornata&quot; (Kansas) along with &quot;Terrapene carolina&quot; (Missouri, North Carolina, and Tennessee). Under &quot;Gopherus&quot; (gopher tortoises), there are &quot;Gopherus polyphemus&quot; (Georgia&#x27;s state reptile and Florida&#x27;s state tortoise) and &quot;Gopherus agassizii&quot; (California and Nevada). Under &quot;Crotalus&quot; (one of two rattlesnake genera), Arizona named &quot;Crotalus willardi willardi&quot;, while West Virginia chose &quot;Crotalus horridus&quot;. With &quot;Phrynosoma&quot; (horned lizards), Wyoming specified the entire genus, but Texas specified &quot;Phrynosoma cornutum&quot;.

==Conservation==

===General reptile declines and state reptile examples===

Writing in 1988, naturalist J. Whitfield Gibbons asserted that awareness of the conservation needs of reptiles had lagged that of large mammals and game species. However, comparison of different editions of the Golden Guide does show increasing sensitivity to U.S. reptile conservation over the last half of the 20th century.

In their 2000 review article &quot;The global decline of reptiles, deja vu amphibians&quot;, Gibbons and colleagues argue that while the general public is more sympathetic to amphibians (perhaps because of their soft skin), reptile species are actually more endangered. Although populations can decline from natural causes, and it is difficult to prove the exact reason for a specific reptile&#x27;s decline, human actions are behind most of the species&#x27; problems. Gibbons &quot;et al.&quot; describe six causes of reptile reductions, incidentally furnishing several examples of state reptile species impacted.
* Overharvesting. Overcollection by humans has strongly hurt many reptile species, especially turtles. The diamondback turtle (Maryland), once extremely common, dropped sharply in the beginning of the 20th century because of its popularity in soup but is gradually recovering now that harvesting for food has mostly stopped. Capture for the pet trade has been strongly implicated in the decline of box turtles (Kansas, Missouri, North Carolina, Tennessee). The timber rattlesnake (West Virginia) is threatened by &quot;rattlesnake roundups&quot; because females take nine years to mature and only produce four young per year. However, not all reptile usage is unsustainable. Since the late 20th century recovery of the American alligator (Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi), its numbers have been successfully managed by game restrictions and commercial ranching.
* Habitat loss. Gopher tortoises (Georgia, Florida&#x27;s official tortoise) have been impacted by the loss of 97% of the Southeast&#x27;s longleaf pine forest.
* Introduced invasive species. New plant species have harmed the desert tortoise (California, Nevada) and gopher tortoise (Georgia, Florida&#x27;s official tortoise). Egg-eating fire ants have reduced the Texas horned lizard (Texas) from part of its range.
* Environmental pollution. Water pollution is primarily seen in turtles and crocodilians and can affect their eggs and sex characteristics. Male American alligators (Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi) have been found with lowered testosterone and altered gonads in a chemically contaminated lake.
* Disease. Increased disease in wild populations often follows weakening from other environmental stressors, such as habitat loss. Upper lung infection and shell diseases have been implicated in the decline of the desert tortoise (California, Nevada) and gopher tortoise (Georgia, Florida&#x27;s state tortoise).
* Climate change represents a future threat by changing habitat. Reptiles are more unsafe than birds because they have less ability to move large distances. Gibbons and colleagues do not describe any examples of impact on specific state reptile species, although they mention a general concern for turtles and crocodilians having their populations become imbalanced—the animals sexes are determined by temperature of the eggs.

===IUCN ratings===

In keeping with the general issues of reptiles, some of the U.S. state reptiles are dwindling species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) maintains a system of ratings, going from Extinct to Least Concern. None of the U.S. state reptiles are in the most extreme categories of Extinct, Extinct in the Wild, or Critically Endangered. Two species are IUCN Endangered: the Alabama red-bellied turtle (Alabama) and the loggerhead sea turtle (South Carolina, also the state saltwater reptile of Florida). However, in the United States, only the Alabama red-bellied turtle is legally an endangered species. The loggerhead sea turtle is only considered &quot;threatened&quot; under U.S. regulations.

Two species are IUCN Vulnerable: the desert tortoise (California and Nevada) and the gopher tortoise (Georgia, also the official tortoise of Florida). Three species are Near Threatened: the diamondback terrapin (Maryland), the ornate box turtle (Kansas), and the common box turtle (Missouri with the three-toed subspecies, North Carolina and Tennessee with the eastern subspecies). All the remaining state reptile species are Least Concern. All the non-turtle reptiles fall into this category, but the only two turtles in relative safety are the common snapping turtle (New York) and the painted turtle (Colorado, Illinois, Michigan, Vermont).

The tabulated IUCN ratings for the state reptiles all reflect species-level assessments; for most state reptiles, the IUCN does not discuss the subspecies situations. With the Arizona ridge-backed rattlesnake, the IUCN notes the subspecies has similar safety to the overall species, but does not formally rate the subspecies.

The ratings also do not reflect state-specific population conditions. For instance, for the Texas horned lizard, much of eastern Texas has lost the animal. Nevertheless, based on healthy populations in other parts of the West, especially New Mexico, the IUCN rates the animal Least Concern. For the timber rattlesnake (West Virginia), the IUCN notes the animal as losing range in many parts of the northeastern U.S., but because the animal is numerous in the southern Appalachians, it is also Least Concern.

The IUCN status of state reptiles at the genus level is ambiguous. For Massachusetts&#x27;s garter snake, the listed Least Concern represents the status of the pictured common garter snake, the species found throughout much of North America and residing in Massachusetts. Within that genus, there are twenty-three species at Least Concern and two each at Vulnerable, Endangered and Data Deficient. For Wyoming&#x27;s horned lizard state reptile, the rating reflects that of the pictured short-horned lizard, which occurs over much of the central United States and almost all of Wyoming. Within that genus, there are ten species at Least Concern and one at Near Threatened and one at Data Deficient.

<doc id="913589" wikidata="Q2530902" url="?curid=913589" title="The Subterraneans">
<text>The Subterraneans is a 1958 novella by the Beat Generation author Jack Kerouac. It is a semi-fictional account of his short romance with Alene Lee (1931–1991), an African-American woman, in Greenwich Village, New York. It was the first work of Kerouac’s to be released following the success of &quot;On the Road&quot;. &quot;The Subterraneans&quot; and its following novel,&quot; The Dharma Bums&quot;, both proved to be popular when released in 1958, and are now seen as important works of the Beat Literature. A Hollywood film adaptation would be released in 1960.

== Background ==
Kerouac met Alene in the late summer of 1953 when she was typing up the manuscripts of William Burroughs and Allen Ginsberg, in Ginsberg&#x27;s Lower East Side apartment.
 In the novella, Kerouac moved the story from New York City to San Francisco and renamed Alene Lee &quot;Mardou Fox&quot;. She is described as a carefree spirit who frequents the jazz clubs and bars of the budding Beat scene of San Francisco. Other well-known personalities and friends from the author&#x27;s life also appear thinly disguised in the novel. The character Frank Carmody is based on William S. Burroughs, and Adam Moorad on Allen Ginsberg. Even Gore Vidal appears as successful novelist Arial Lavalina. Kerouac&#x27;s alter ego is named Leo Percepied, and his long-time friend Neal Cassady is mentioned only in passing as Leroy.

==Character key==
Kerouac often based his fictional characters on friends and family.

==Criticism and literary significance==
The position of jazz and jazz culture is central to the novel, tying together the themes of Kerouac&#x27;s writing here as elsewhere, and expressed in the &quot;spontaneous prose&quot; style in which he composed most of his works. The following quotation from Chapter 1 illustrates the spontaneous prose style of &quot;The Subterraneans:&quot;

==Film version==

A 1960 film adaptation was released by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to capitalize on the book’s success. The producers changed the African American character of Mardou Fox, Kerouac&#x27;s love interest, to a young French girl (played by Leslie Caron) to better fit both contemporary social and Hollywood palates. While it was derided and vehemently criticized by Allen Ginsberg, among others, for its two-dimensional characters, it illustrates the way the film industry attempted to exploit the emerging popularity of this culture as it grew in San Francisco and Greenwich Village, New York.

<doc id="913600" wikidata="Q527809" url="?curid=913600" title="Kalymnos">
<text>Kalymnos (; ) is a Greek island and municipality in the southeastern Aegean Sea. It belongs to the Dodecanese island chain, between the islands of Kos (south, at a distance of ) and Leros (north, at a distance of less than ): the latter is linked to it through a series of islets. Kalymnos lies between two and five hours away by sea from the island of Rhodes.

In 2021 the island had a population of 17,752, making it the third most populous island of the Dodecanese, after Kos and Rhodes. It is known in Greece for the affluence of much of its population, and also stands as both the wealthiest member of the Dodecanese and one of the wealthiest Greek islands overall. The Municipality of Kalymnos, which includes the populated offshore islands of Pserimos, Telendos, Kalolimnos, and Pláti, as well as several uninhabited islets, has a combined land area of and a total population of 17,752 inhabitants (2021).

==Naming==
The island is known as &quot;Càlino&quot; in Italian and &quot;Kilimli&quot; or &quot;Kelemez&quot; in Turkish.

==Geography==


The island has a length of , is across at its widest, and covers an area of . Moreover, on the north side there is a peninsula which stretches in a northwest direction.

Kalymnos is mostly mountainous with complicated topography. There are three main chains going from W-NW to E-SE, and a fourth which extends NW the length of the peninsula. The coastline is very irregular, with many sheltered coves. There are some springs, one among them being thermal. The soil is mainly limestone-based, but in the valleys, there is a compact bank of volcanic tuff, the relic of an ancient volcano, located in Vigles, between the villages of Myrties and Kantouni. The island is mainly barren, except for the two fertile valleys of Vathys and Pothia, where olives, oranges and vines are grown. There is also an ostrich farm in Argos, near the airport.

Earthquakes are a frequent occurrence around Kalymnos, a fact that is connected with the volcanoes in surrounding islands. The last earthquake that occurred was the 2017 Aegean Sea earthquake with a magnitude of 6.7Mw, which injured two people in Kalymnos.

==Archipelago of Kalymnos==
Kalymnos is neighboured by the small island of Telendos, which was once part of Kalymnos, but split off after a major earthquake in 554 and is now separated from Kalymnos by a channel of water (about 800 m wide).

Between Kalymnos and Kos lies the islet of Pserimos which is inhabited and, with an area of , is one of the largest of the lesser islands of the Dodecanese. Near Pserimos lies the islet of Platí, and about to the NE lies the small islet of Kalolimnos.

==History==
In Antiquity Kalymnos depended on Kos, and followed its history. The island&#x27;s Hellenistic Temple of Apollo was excavated by the British archaeologist Charles Newton in the nineteenth century; many of the finds he made, including important epigraphic inscriptions, are in the British Museum&#x27;s collection. In the Middle Ages it was under the influence of the Byzantine Empire, and during the 13th century it was used by the Venetian Republic as a naval base. In 1310 it came under the control of the Knights of Rhodes, and later (mainly in 1457 and 1460) was often attacked by the Ottomans, who eventually conquered it in 1522. Unlike Rhodes and Kos, during the Ottoman period, there was no Turkish immigration to Kalymnos.

According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Kalymnos had a total population of 9,716, consisting of 9,482 Greeks, 64 Muslims and 170 foreign citizens.

On May 12, 1912, during the Italo-Turkish War, Kalymnos was occupied by Italian sailors of the Regia Marina. Italy took control of the island along with other islands of the Dodecanese (except Kastellorizo initially) until 1947, when the Dodecanese were finally united with mainland Greece, as part of the modern Greek state.

==Religion==

The majority of Kalymnians are Orthodox Christians. The island belongs to that small part of Greece that does not depend on the Church of Greece, but rather on the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople based in Istanbul, Turkey. Kalymnos belongs to the Metropolis of Leros, Kalymnos and Astypalaia.

==Sponge diving==

Kalymnos is known and billed as the &quot;Sponge-divers&#x27; island&quot;. Sponge diving has long been a common occupation on Kalymnos and sponges were the main source of income of Kalymnians, bringing wealth to the island and making it famous throughout the Mediterranean. The Kalymnians harvested sponges from the sea-bed as close as Pserimos or as far as North Africa. Early diving was done without equipment (free diving), using a harpoon. Sponges are still fished individually, by hand. 

The Greek sponge trade was centered close in the Dodecanese, featuring Kalymnos until the mid-80s, when a disease hit the eastern Mediterranean destroying a great number of sponges and damaging the sponge-fishing industry as a result. Today, Kalymnos faces a lack of sponges due to the outbreak of a disease that has decimated sponge crops.

An annual celebration, Sponge Week, occurs a week after Easter to honour this &quot;Kalymnian gold.” Much has been written, sung and filmed about the legendary courage and recklessness of the sponge divers themselves.

The local folk dance Mihanikos depicts the crippling effects of decompression sickness that is caused by sponge diving. It is typically only performed by men.

== Climbing ==
Kalymnos is a popular rock climbing location with more than 3,000 climbing routes set in the limestone rock of the island and a climate that allows climbing all year around. The island has seen a boom in climbing related tourism since 1997, when the Italian Andrea di Bari started establishing the first routes.

==Economy==

Being mostly barren (only 18% of the land can be cultivated), agriculture has always played a minor role in the economy of the island, except for the valley of Vathi. The island is famous for its citrus fruits grown in this area.

Another industrial activity typical of Kalymnos was the production of painted head scarfs, which were the most original component of the female dress.

In recent times, tourism has become important for the island, particularly for rock climbing. In 2006, the island also acquired an airport, the Kalymnos Island National Airport in Argos, a village between Pothia and Brosta (the villages which are opposite of Telendos), to better link the island with the mainland.

Since the beginning of the 20th century, there has been much emigration from Kalymnos (the 1925 population was some 24,000 inhabitants as compared to 16,500 in 2012), especially to the United States and Australia. The cities of Darwin and Melbourne in Australia, and Tarpon Springs, Gary, IN, and Campbell, OH in the United States are home to large Greek communities of Kalymnian descent.

Kalymnian emigrants and their descendants also form a substantial portion of the bridge painting industry in the USA. Some researchers link this to the sponge diving tradition and way of life as both trades involve dangerous work with long periods away from home.

<doc id="913601" wikidata="Q5579661" url="?curid=913601" title="Golden Mile (Brentford)">
<text>The Golden Mile is a stretch of the Great West Road north of Brentford running west from the western boundary of Chiswick in London, United Kingdom.

It was so called due to the concentration of industry along this short stretch of road. This section of the Great West Road was opened in 1925 in order to bypass the notoriously congested Brentford High Street and several factories of architectural merit were rapidly built along the road to take advantage of both the good communications it provided, and the easy availability of land for new buildings. Many examples of the Art Deco architecture remain.
However, no commercial buildings could be built further west along the Great West Road (A4) after Syon Lane (Gillette Corner) as the land was owned by the Church Commissioners. Syon Lane railway station was built especially for the workers at these various factories.
Land for the Great West Road was compulsorily purchased. It seems likely that housing was dictated by the 1923 (and later) Housing Acts which gave house builders incentives to build houses; also the need to have workers living near the factories.

These factories included:
* [[Hudson Motor Car Company|Hudson-Essex Motors]] was the first factory built in the area, opening in 1926. The factory built Hudson and Essex motor cars, and later Terraplane. Further office premises were added and after the merger of Nash-Kelvinator and Hudson to form American Motors Corporation in 1954 the company became Rambler Motors Limited. Because of their close proximity to the newly built Chiswick flyover the Chiswick junction came to be known as &quot;Hudsons corner.&quot; Rambler Motors continued to import and service AMC cars into the 1970s. 
* [[The Smith&#x27;s Snackfood Company|Smith&#x27;s Potato Crisps Ltd]] opened in 1927 (Brand now owned by PepsiCo, acquired in 1989). Factory rebuilt and expanded in 1930 with colonnaded frontage.
* The [[Firestone tyre factory (London)|Firestone]] Tyre Company. Built 1928, designed by Wallis, Gilbert and Partners. It was the first overseas factory built by the Firestone company of America. The building frontage was demolished during a public holiday in August 1980 shortly before a preservation order was due to be served on it to retain the Art Deco architecture. The Art Deco gatehouse was demolished in 2004 to make way for increased parking facilities. The remaining gates, railings, and piers are in a Jazz Modern style and are Grade II listed.
* The [[Trico|Trico Products]] Windscreen Wiper factory, No. 980, opened in 1928. The Trico business relocated to Pontypool, South Wales in 1992 and the building was demolished. The site, together with the adjacent site, Maclean&#x27;s toothpaste factory (then owned by Rank Audio-Visual) to its east, was to be used for the UK headquarters of Samsung. The 1997 Asian financial crisis prevented this, and the site now houses the headquarters building of GlaxoSmithKline, also known simply as &quot;GSK&quot;.
* Leonard Williams Ltd.. No. 971, (Packard Cars Concessionaire) in 1929
* Jantzen Knitting Mills Factory, opened in 1931
* [[Sperry Corporation|Sperry Gyroscope Company Limited]] Factory, opened in 1931
* [[Coty|Coty Cosmetics]] Factory, No. 941, designed by Wallis, Gilbert and Partners opened in 1932. The building now operates as BMI Syon Clinic.
* The Macleans Factory opened in 1932 (brand acquired in 1938 by Beecham, now owned by GlaxoSmithKline). Macleans was founded in 1919 by Alex C Maclean to produce &#x27;own-brand&#x27; products for chemists. &quot;Did you Maclean your teeth today?&quot;
* The [[Gillette Corner|Gillette Factory]], designed by Sir Banister Flight Fletcher in 1936–1937. Gillette stopped using this factory in April 2006, moving production to Poland. The building is as of 2013 undergoing conversion into a mixed use complex with a hotel and residential apartments.
* The [[The Pyrene Company Limited|Pyrene]] Fire Extinguisher Company, No. 981, built between 1929 and 1930, designed by Wallis, Gilbert &amp; Partners.
* Wallis House, built between 1936 and 1942 originally for Simmonds Aerocessories, designed by Wallis, Gilbert and Partners. Named after the architect, Thomas Wallis. Latterly used by Beecham Pharmaceuticals as Beecham House. Assael Architecture was commissioned by the Barratt Group to convert and restore the Listed building and redevelopment took place between 2005 and 2008 into apartments, retaining the basic fascia, although with a new partially glass entrance enclosure, and reglazed windows replacing the Crittall originals.
* The [[Currys]] Factory and head office, No. 991, built in 1936, now Grade II listed, front office building now restored by Foster &amp; Partners between 1997 and 2000 for JCDecaux
* Henly&#x27;s Car Showroom (Studebaker and Jaguar) with a distinctive tower – on the east side of the Smith&#x27;s Crisps factory – opened in 1937 and later became a warehouse for Martini, and following redevelopment after a fire in 1989 retaining the tower, an office for Data General, then EMC Corporation
* Harvey&#x27;s Wines, who had their own railway line to deliver goods from Bristol.
* MacFarlane Biscuit Factory, behind the Gillette building (off Syon Lane North) (Demolished in the 1980s and now a Tesco Supermarket and the HQ of Sky.)

This stretch of road included an illuminated, animated, advertising sign known to many drivers coming into London on the M4 motorway. The sign, showing a bottle of Lucozade emptying into a glass, was on the wall of what was the Lucozade factory, which opened in 1953 and was demolished in late 2004. The sign was removed to Gunnersbury Park Museum in September 2004 after a brief campaign to preserve it &quot;in situ&quot;. A replica was subsequently installed, then controversially removed at the end of 2015 and replaced with a digital billboard.
Another memorable animated signage was of a female diver advertising Jantzen swimwear.

<text>Ionel Teodoreanu (, born Ioan Hipolit Teodoreanu; 6 January 1897 – 3 February 1954) was a Romanian novelist and lawyer. He is mostly remembered for his books on the themes of childhood and adolescence.

==Biography==

Born in January 1897 in Iași into a family of intellectuals, Teodoreanu followed his father Osvald and older brother Păstorel in becoming a lawyer. From 1904 to 1906 he attended the German primary school of Pitar-Moș in Bucharest, until his parents moved back to Iași. Between 1908 and 1912 he attended the Boarding High School in Iași. He later transferred to the National College, which he attended until he graduated in 1916. Teodoreanu obtained his law degree from the University of Iași in 1919, and began to work as a lawyer, although he was more attracted to literature.

In late 1918, Teodoreanu he was introduced to his future wife, Maria Ștefana Lupașcu, by Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea&#x27;s daughters. The two young people became close due to their mutual passion for literature and their disposition towards writing, and they married in 1920. One year later, on 3 February 1921, he became the father of twin boys, Ștefan and Osvald. Ionel Teodoreanu died on 3 February 1954, at age 57, in Bucharest, and was buried in the city&#x27;s Bellu Cemetery.

==Literary works==
Teodoreanu made his literary debut in 1919, with the &quot;Bunicii&quot; (&quot;The Grandparents&quot;) sketch, published in the review &quot;Însemnări literare&quot; (&quot;Literary notes&quot;). His editorial debut was represented by the short story volume &quot;Uliţa copilăriei&quot; (&quot;Childhood Lane&quot;, 1923). Like his brother Păstorel—a renowned epigrammatist—he was linked to the &quot;Romanian Life&quot; group led by Garabet Ibrăileanu, who considered him to one of the most promising writers of the generation following World War I. In this environment, Teodoreanu published his classic novel trilogy. &quot;La Medeleni&quot; between 1925 and 1927.

===&quot;La Medeleni&quot;===
Teodoreanu wrote around twenty books, but his greatest success, especially with children and young people, was &quot;La Medeleni&quot;. The trilogy includes several autobiographical episodes, and, on a universal level, constitute a subtle analysis of the human soul. The trilogy is not without its critics; George Călinescu argued that Teodoreanu&#x27;s style was too laden with metaphors and rather baroque.

The universe of &quot;La Medeleni&quot; reflects the upper middle class environment in Romania during the early decades of the 20th century. It depicts the innocence of childhood which the ravages of the World War and its aftermath would soon shatter. Although Teodoreanu did not write it as an autobiography, his experience of having grown up in such a family in Moldavia during this time was influential.

===&quot;Lorelei&quot;===
Teodoreanu abandoned the childhood theme in most of his later literary works and never again reached the same level of success, but his books are still loved.

In &quot;Lorelei&quot;, the main character is Luli, an eighteen-year-old student who falls in love with her teacher, Catul Bogdan, becoming engaged to him just three days after their first meeting. Bogdan is a workaholic writer, and soon Luli starts to feel abandoned and unloved. With the help of her friend, Gabriela, Luli sets to play a game with her husband. She writes some poems, and makes her friend Gabriela write them down, signing them with the pseudonym &quot;Lorelei&quot; and then mail them to her husband. Catul is amazed by the quality of the poems and slowly falls in love with the woman who wrote them. After a while, when Gabriela visits them, he sees a piece of paper with her writing and believes she is the mysterious &quot;Lorelei&quot;. Luli realizes what is going on, but before this situation could be defused, dies due to an acute appendicitis. Catul later marries Gabriela, but their relationship is marred by the character faults of Gabriela. He starts having nightmares and loses his ability to write. Finally, he realizes that Gabriela is only after his money, learns the true identity of &quot;Lorelei&quot;, and commits suicide.

<text>The South Carolina Senate is the upper house of the South Carolina General Assembly, the lower house being the South Carolina House of Representatives. It consists of 46 senators elected from single member districts for four-year terms at the same time as United States presidential elections.

The South Carolina Constitution of 1895 provided for each county to elect one senator for a four-year term. The election of senators was staggered so that half of the state Senate was elected every two years. After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1964 for the case &quot;Reynolds v. Sims&quot;, the state Senate was reapportioned in 1966 as a temporary measure into 27 districts with 50 members for two-year terms. In 1967, the state Senate was again reapportioned, this time into 20 districts with 46 members for four-year terms. The number of districts was reduced to 16 in 1972 and in 1984, they were eliminated with the creation of single member districts.

The annual session of the General Assembly convenes at the State Capitol Building in Columbia on the second Tuesday of January of each year. However, after convening, either the House or the Senate may call for itself a 30-day recess by a majority vote, or a longer recess by a two-thirds vote.

== Composition ==
=== Members of the South Carolina Senate ===
Except as noted, all senators were elected in November 2020 and terms began on January 12, 2021. All terms expire in January 2025.

<text>The touchdown polymerase chain reaction or touchdown style polymerase chain reaction is a method of polymerase chain reaction by which primers avoid amplifying nonspecific sequences. The annealing temperature during a polymerase chain reaction determines the specificity of primer annealing. The melting point of the primer sets the upper limit on annealing temperature. At temperatures just above this point, only very specific base pairing between the primer and the template will occur. At lower temperatures, the primers bind less specifically. Nonspecific primer binding obscures polymerase chain reaction results, as the nonspecific sequences to which primers anneal in early steps of amplification will &quot;swamp out&quot; any specific sequences because of the exponential nature of polymerase amplification.

==Method==

The earliest steps of a touchdown polymerase chain reaction cycle have high annealing temperatures. The annealing temperature is decreased in increments for every subsequent set of cycles. The primer will anneal at the highest temperature which is least-permissive of nonspecific binding that it is able to tolerate. Thus, the first sequence amplified is the one between the regions of greatest primer specificity; it is most likely that this is the sequence of interest. These fragments will be further amplified during subsequent rounds at lower temperatures, and will outcompete the nonspecific sequences to which the primers may bind at those lower temperatures. If the primer initially (during the higher-temperature phases) binds to the sequence of interest, subsequent rounds of polymerase chain reaction can be performed upon the product to further amplify those fragments. Touchdown increases specificity of the reaction at higher temperatures and increases the efficiency towards the end by lowering the annealing temperature.

From a mathematical point of view products of annealing at smaller temperatures are disadvantaged by formula_1 for the first annealing in cycle formula_2 and the second one in cycle formula_3 for formula_4.

<text>This is a list of U.S. state soils. A state soil is a soil that has special significance to a particular state. Each state in the United States has selected a state soil, twenty of which have been legislatively established. These official state soils share the same level of distinction as official state flowers and birds. Also, representative soils have been selected for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

<text>Typographical syntax, also known as orthotypography, is the aspect of typography that defines the meaning and rightful usage of typographic signs, notably punctuation marks, and elements of layout such as flush margins and indentation.[2] 

Orthotypographic rules vary broadly from language to language, from country to country, and even from publisher to publisher. As such, they are more often described as &quot;conventions&quot;.

While some of those conventions have ease of understanding as a justification – for instance, specifying that low punctuation (commas, full stops, and ellipses) must be in the same typeface, weight, and style as the preceding text – many are probably arbitrary.

The rules dealing with quotation marks are a good example of this: which ones to use and how to nest them, how much to leave on both sides, and when to integrate them with other punctuation marks.

Each major publisher maintains a list of orthotypographic rules that they apply as part of their house style.

<text>Sergi Bruguera i Torner (; born 16 January 1971) is a Spanish former professional tennis player and coach. He won consecutive men&#x27;s singles titles at the French Open in 1993 and 1994, a silver medal at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in men&#x27;s singles and reached a career-high ranking of No. 3 in August 1994.

Bruguera is the only player to have a winning record against both Roger Federer and Pete Sampras. He won three of his five matches against Sampras: Bruguera leads 1–0 on hard court, 2–1 on clay, and Sampras leads 1–0 on carpet. In their only match, at the 2000 Barcelona Open, Bruguera defeated Federer 6–1, 6–1. By number of games won, the match was Federer&#x27;s worst loss in his entire career.

Bruguera was selected to captain the Spain Davis Cup team in 2018. He became the coach of Jo-Wilfried Tsonga between 2019 and 2022, then he coached Alexander Zverev in May 2022 but they split ways after the 2023 Madrid Open due to creative differences. Now, he is the coach of Arthur Fils with Sébastien Grosjean since October 2023.

==Career==
Bruguera won a total of 14 top-level singles titles and 3 doubles titles. His career-high singles ranking was World No. 3. He is currently the director of the Bruguera Tennis Academy Top Team.

=== Early career ===
Bruguera was Spain&#x27;s national junior champion in 1987. He turned professional in 1988. In his first full year on the tour, 1989, he won the Cairo Challenger title as a qualifier, defeating Jordi Arrese in the final, and reached the semifinals in Rome. He reached 4th round in the French Open in 1989 and finished the year ranked world No. 26, and was named the ATP&#x27;s newcomer of the year.

=== 1990–1994: Clay dominance ===
Bruguera earned a reputation as a top clay court player in the early 1990s, reaching singles finals at Gstaad and Geneva, and capturing doubles titles in Hamburg (his 1st ATP Masters 1000 title in doubles) partnering Jim Courier (who would play against Bruguera later in 1993 French Open the men&#x27;s singles final) in Florence, partnering Horacio de la Peña in 1990; reaching singles finals at Barcelona and Gstaad along with titles in Estoril, Monte Carlo (his 1st ATP Masters 1000 title in singles), and Athens, and a doubles title at Geneva, partnering Marc Rosset in 1991; reaching singles finals at Estoril, Bordeaux, and Athens along with titles in Madrid, Gstaad and Palermo in 1992.

Bruguera rose to even further prominence in 1993. During the French Open, Bruguera reached quarterfinals without dropping a set, including a rare triple bagel (6–0, 6–0, 6–0) at the second round against Thierry Champion, this remains the last time a player recorded a triple bagel in a singles match at a Grand Slam event. He then defeated Pete Sampras in 4 sets and Andrei Medvedev in straight sets in the semifinals, Bruguera reached his first Grand Slam final at the French Open, where he faced two-time defending champion and then World No. 2 Jim Courier. Courier was overwhelmingly favoured to win his third title, but ultimately Bruguera won a gruelling five-set final that lasted 4 hours, becoming the first Spaniard to win French Open since Andrés Gimeno in 1972. It was also the last time a man won a Grand Slam singles title with wins over both of the top two seeds until Stanislas Wawrinka won the Australian Open in 2014. He continued his top clay court player reputation by reaching finals at Milan (his first final on Carpet), Barcelona, Madrid, and Palermo, while capturing an additional 4 titles at Monte Carlo (his 2nd ATP Masters 1000 title in singles), Gstaad, Prague, and Bordeaux (his 1st hard court title) besides Roland Garros. He finished the year ranked World No. 4.

In 1994 Bruguera maintained his dominance on clay and successfully defended his title at the French Open while only dropping 2 sets in the entire tournament, defeating, once again, Medvedev in straight sets in the quarterfinals and Courier in 4 sets in the semifinals, along with fellow Spaniard Alberto Berasategui in 4 sets in the final. He reached finals at Dubai (his 2nd hard court final), Monte Carlo (his 3rd ATP Masters 1000 final in singles), and Madrid, and captured titles at Gstaad and Prague besides Roland Garros. In August he reached his career-high ranking of World No. 3 and finished the year ranked World No. 4. He was the first Spaniard to finish 2 consecutive years in Top 5. It is also his 4th consecutive year winning at least 3 clay titles in singles.

Between 1990 and 1994 he reached 25 top-level clay tournament finals in singles and 3 top-level clay tournament finals in doubles, out of which he captured 13 clay titles in singles and 3 clay titles in doubles.

=== 1995 ===
With Thomas Muster &quot;officially&quot; starting his reign as the new King of Clay, Bruguera was not able to keep up his dominance on clay like he did the previous years, but was still able to play at a decent level. Coming into 1995 French Open as the two-time defending champion, he only dropped one set en route to semifinals, where he was defeated by 1989 French Open champion Michael Chang in tight straight sets (4–6, 6–7, 6–7), ending his 19-match win streak at Roland Garros. He only reached 1 top-level final, which is his 4th Masters 1000 final, his first in Rome (on clay), where he was defeated in 4 sets by Muster. In December, he tore 2 ligaments on his right ankle while training, which put him in an even worse condition and prevented him to make any significant impact during 1996 season.

=== 1996: Ankle injury ===
He returned to competitive playing in February, having not yet fully recovered from the injury. In 1996 French Open Bruguera was taken out by Sampras in an epic 5-set match in the second round. The highlight of the year was when Bruguera won the men&#x27;s singles silver medal at the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta. He was defeated in straight sets in the final by Andre Agassi. It was also the only top-level final he reached this year. His Year-End Ranking slipped from previous year&#x27;s No. 13 to No. 81 much thanks to his injuries.

=== 1997: Comeback ===
Opening 1997 Bruguera was the first ever opponent of Lleyton Hewitt in the main draw of a Grand Slam tournament, at the Australian Open. Bruguera defeated him in straight sets.

This year Bruguera returned strongly from injury previous season and reached finals at Milan, Key Biscaine (his 5th Masters final and his 1st on hard), and Umag. Bruguera also played an excellent tournament at the French Open reaching the final for the third time, en route to the final he defeated former champion and 2nd Seed Michael Chang in the fourth round, then rising star and future World No. 1 Patrick Rafter in the semifinals. But an almost unknown Brazilian player ranked No. 66 named Gustavo Kuerten, who defeated two former champions and notable players en route to the final, defeated Bruguera in straight sets without much effort, although Bruguera was heavily favoured to win his 3rd title at Roland Garros.

Bruguera earned the ATP&#x27;s Comeback Player of Year award in 1997 after returning from an ankle injury the previous year and improving his Year-End Ranking from world No. 81 to world No. 8.

=== Later career ===
After 1997, due to injuries, Bruguera was far from his best game. He lost concentration and started to increase his errors during his matches, losing one of his great virtues, his solid style. From 1998 until his retirement the three remarkable showings were the final (1999) and the title (2000) in the Challenger Open Castilla y León (considered best challenger tournament of the world by this date) and the final in San Marino in 2000.

==Coaching==
He coached Alexander Zverev from May 2022, after he stepped down from his Davis captain role, till the run-up of the 2023 French Open.

He is currently coaching French player Arthur Fils since the end of 2023.

== Outside tennis career ==
Bruguera is a long-time fan of the Los Angeles Lakers and would often attend their games while playing at tournaments in the United States. During Miami Masters on 28 March 1997, right after the semifinals where he defeated world No. 1 Sampras, Bruguera sank three shots (layup, free throw, top of key) during a time-out of a game between the Lakers and the Miami Heat to earn US$500. This money was given to ATP Charities in his name. Bruguera has also played semi-professional football in his native Spain.

In a 2006 interview featuring questions from fans by the BBC Sport website, a question was asked about the frequent comparisons between Roger Federer and Sampras. In his reply, Bruguera claimed that Federer is ten times better than Sampras.

<text>Marie-Pier Beaudet (born December 12, 1986) is a former Canadian archer who competed at three Summer Olympic Games between 2004 and 2012. Beaudet made her international debut in 2002, and in addition to the Olympic Games has contested the Pan American Games, in which she won a silver medal in 2007, and the Commonwealth Games, in which she earned a bronze medal in 2010.

==Career==
Beaudet was born on December 12, 1986, in Quebec City, Quebec. She made her debut to the Canadian national team at the World Archery Youth Championships in 2002, and won her first international competition in Arizona that same year, a moment she reflected in 2015 as her greatest achievement.

Following the 2012 Summer Olympics Beaudet took a year&#x27;s break from archery to prioritise her mental health, returning to the sport in 2014. Beaudet announced her retirement in 2015 to focus on her nursing studies at Cégep de Lévis-Lauzon.

;Olympic Games
Beaudet&#x27;s selection to represent Canada at the 2004 Summer Olympics made her the country&#x27;s youngest ever Olympic archer at seventeen years old.

Beaudet won selection to the 2008 Summer Olympics in July 2008 after a successful appeal against the results of a national trial held in May, which Beaudet argued was not clarified prior to competition as the basis for Olympic selection. Beaudet entered the 2008 Games holding a world ranking of 53. She finished the preliminary 72-arrow ranking round, which determined the seedings for the elimination rounds, in thirty-fourth position and advanced to the second round of the women&#x27;s individual event after a narrow opening round win against India&#x27;s Dola Banerjee. Beaudet was eliminated by her second round opponent Yun Ok-hee of South Korea, who had earlier won gold medal in the women&#x27;s team event.

Beaudet qualified for the Canadian Olympic team for the 2012 Summer Olympics shortly after winning a qualification spot for Canada in Medellín in April that year, having set a new Canadian national record points score of 1,340 from a maximum of 1,440 in the process. At the Games Beaudet concluded the ranking round in twenty-ninth position for the women&#x27;s individual event with 645 points from a maximum of 720.

;Pan American and Commonwealth Games
Beaudet won silver medal in the women&#x27;s team recurve event the 2007 Pan American Games with teammates Kristen Niles and Kateri Vrakking, losing to Colombia in the final by two points. She was praised by the Canadian coach for adapting to shooting last in sequence within the team as opposed to her usual position as first.

In July 2010 Beaudet was announced as a member of the Canadian team for the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi, where she won bronze medal in the women&#x27;s team recurve event.

<doc id="913652" wikidata="Q4959798" url="?curid=913652" title="Breast enlargement">
<text>Breast enlargement is the enlargement of the breasts. It may occur naturally as in mammoplasia or may occur artificially through active intervention. Many women regard their breasts, which are female secondary sex characteristics, as important to their sexual attractiveness, as a sign of femininity that is important to their sense of self. Due to this, when a woman considers her breasts deficient in some respect, she might choose to engage in some activity intended to enhance them.

Actual and potential methods to achieve larger breasts include:

* Surgical breast augmentation, such as with breast implants or fat transfer.
* Pharmacological or hormonal breast enhancement, through administration of medications such as estrogen or breast enlargement supplements.
* Increasing the food energy intake by eating more and/or more energetic foods. By increasing food energy intake, more adipose tissue will be created, part of which will consist of adipose tissue located near the breast area. The amount of adipose tissue that will be added to the breasts varies from person to person and is controlled by the KLF14 gene. Additional modification of the KLF14 gene can thus make sure even more of the adipose tissue increase will occur at the breasts. 
* Mechanical breast enhancement, such as through use of the BRAVA Breast Enhancement and Shaping System, a clinically-effective external breast tissue expander.

Ineffective methods to achieve larger breasts include:

* Mark Eden bust developer, a fraudulently marketed method and device.

<text>Newark Academy is a coeducational private day school located in Livingston, Essex County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey, serving students in sixth through twelfth grades.

It was the first school in New Jersey to offer the International Baccalaureate (IB) program. The school receives about 650 applicants for 115 spots, an acceptance rate of 17%. The school has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Elementary and Secondary Schools since 1928.

== History ==
Newark Academy is one of several pre-Revolutionary War schools still operating in the United States and is considered the seventh-oldest private school in the country and the second-oldest day school in the state of New Jersey (behind Rutgers Preparatory School). The Academy was founded in 1774 by Alexander MacWhorter, a prominent cleric and advisor to George Washington, and was located on Market Street in Downtown Newark. Newark Academy was briefly closed after it was burned by the British during the Revolutionary War. The school then reopened in new quarters in 1792. In 1802, the Academy opened a separate division for girls, but this program was closed in 1859. After 1929, it moved to First Street in the Roseville section of Newark. The Academy moved from Newark to its campus in Livingston, in 1964, and became fully co-educational in 1971.

==Campus==

These rooms, as well as the laboratories in the middle school, include lab equipment. As part of Experiential learning programs, middle schoolers of every grade go on a series of trips/excursions at the end of the year, called &quot;Capstone&quot; to such destinations as the United Nations.

The Coraci Performance Hall, which opened in summer 2020, is a 700-seat facility that has been rebuilt to accommodate the increased size of the student body for Morning Meetings and to provide a performance space for student artists that take the stage for dance, choral, orchestral, jazz, and theatrical performances throughout the school year.

The Hawkes Memorial Library, opened in 1974, houses a 23,000-volume collection, and a periodical and microfilm collection.

<text>Kazakhstan competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s third appearance at the Summer Olympics in the post-Soviet era.

National Olympic Committee of the Republic of Kazakhstan sent a total of 114 athletes to the Games, 71 men and 43 women, to compete in 17 sports. The nation&#x27;s team size was roughly smaller by 16 athletes from Sydney, and had the third largest share of men in its Summer Olympic history. Water polo was the only team-based sport in which Kazakhstan had its representation in these Olympic games. Among the sports played by the athletes, Kazakhstan marked its official Olympic debut in rhythmic gymnastics.

Notable Kazakh athletes featured returning Olympic medalists Alexander Vinokourov in road cycling and Islam Bairamukov in men&#x27;s freestyle wrestling. Grigoriy Yegorov made his official comeback for his second Olympic bid, since he won the bronze medal in the men&#x27;s pole vault at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, representing the Soviet Union. Pistol shooter Galina Belyayeva was the oldest and most accomplished member of the team at age 55. Meanwhile, backstroke swimmer Anastassiya Prilepa set a historic milestone for the Kazakh team as the youngest ever athlete, aged 14, to compete at the Olympics.

Kazakhstan left Athens with a total of eight Olympic medals (one gold, four silver, and three bronze), finishing fortieth in the overall medal count. This was also the nation&#x27;s poorest Olympic performance in history since the breakup of the Soviet Union, collecting only a single gold medal from welterweight boxer Bakhtiyar Artayev. Three of these medals were awarded each to the athletes in boxing and wrestling, including Artayev&#x27;s illustrious gold, while Dmitriy Karpov added a second Olympic medal for Kazakhstan in track and field by claiming the bronze in men&#x27;s decathlon.

Weightlifter Sergey Filimonov originally captured a bronze in the men&#x27;s 77 kg class. On February 12, 2013, the International Olympic Committee stripped Russia&#x27;s Oleg Perepetchenov of his 2004 Olympic medal after both probes were retested and showed traces of anabolic steroids, upgrading Filimonov&#x27;s medal to silver.

== Archery ==

Two Kazakh archers qualified each for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s individual archery.

== Boxing ==

Kazakhstan sent eight boxers to the 2004 Olympics. Each of them won at least one bout, a feat that not even Cuba accomplished. Three of the Kazakhstani boxers won medals, one each of gold, silver, and bronze. This put Kazakhstan in a tie with Thailand for third place in the boxing medals count, behind only Cuba and Russia. Russia was a constant annoyance for the Kazakhs, as they lost four of the five matches they boxed against Russians. In contrast, Bakhtiyar Artayev won the only match Kazakhstan had against the almost-invincible Cubans. Two boxers were defeated in the round of 16. Three more fell in the quarterfinals, just missing medals. The combined record of the eight boxers was 17-7.

<doc id="913669" wikidata="Q1433131" url="?curid=913669" title="Lebowa">
<text>Lebowa was a Bantustan (&quot;homeland&quot;) located in the Transvaal in northeastern South Africa. Seshego initially acted as Lebowa&#x27;s capital while the purpose-built Lebowakgomo was being constructed. Granted internal self-government on 2 October 1972 and ruled for much of its existence by Cedric Phatudi, Lebowa was reincorporated into South Africa in 1994. It became part of the Limpopo province. The territory was not contiguous, being divided into two major and several minor portions.

Even though Lebowa included large swathes of Sekukuniland and was seen as a home for the Northern Sotho speaking ethnic groups such as the Pedi people, it was also home to various non-Northern Sotho speaking tribes, including the Northern Ndebele, Batswana and VaTsonga.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Lebowa&quot; is an archaic spelling of the Sesotho sa Lebowa word &quot;Lebowa&quot; which means &quot;where you come from &quot;. The name was chosen as a compromise between the various  Sotho Sa Lebowa  groups for which it was designed.

==History==
The North Sotho National Unit was founded on 1 June 1960 in pursuance of separate development. It was created to be a homeland for Northern Sotho peoples such as Bapedi, Batlokwa, Babirwa, Banareng, Bahananwa, Balobedu, Bakone, Baroka, Bakgakga, Bahlaloga, Batau, Bakwena, Baphuthi, Batlou and many others. On 2 October 1972 it was granted internal self-governance and renamed Lebowa. Beginning in the 1950s through to the 1970s, thousands of people were forcibly removed from their communities and relocated to Lebowa.

The first black leader of the territory was Mokgoma Maurice Matlala who was handpicked by the apartheid authorities. He first led the North Sotho National Unit as its Executive Chief Councillor from August 1969 to 2 October 1972 at which point he became the Executive Chief Minister of Lebowa. The following year of 1973 on 3 May Mokgoma&#x27;s Lebowa National Party lost the first elections of the homeland to the Lebowa People&#x27;s Party and Dr. Cedric Phatudi took over. He went on to win two more re-elections in 1978 and 1973 but died in his third term in 1987. ZT Seleka was announced as the interim leader of the homeland. After elections, Mogoboya Nelson Ramodike became the Executive Chief Minister until 1989 when the office became the Prime Ministry.

On 24 April 1994 Nelson Ramodike resigned and the homeland had no active administration until 27 April when it was reintegrated into South Africa.

The overwhelming majority of its territory became part of the newly formed province of the Northern Transvaal (now Limpopo) and a smaller portion formed the newly created Eastern Transvaal province (now Mpumalanga).

<doc id="913671" wikidata="Q1760633" url="?curid=913671" title="Tristessa">
<text>Tristessa is a 1960 novella by Beat Generation writer Jack Kerouac set in Mexico City. It is based on his relationship with a Mexican prostitute (the title character). The woman&#x27;s real name was Esperanza (&quot;hope&quot; in Spanish); Kerouac changed her name to Tristessa (a spelling he made up from &quot;tristeza&quot; which means &quot;sadness&quot; in Spanish).

The novel was translated into Spanish by Mexican writer Jorge García-Robles.

== Summary ==
Allen Ginsberg, in describing the book, wrote &quot;Tristessa&#x27;s a narrative meditation studying a hen, a rooster, a dove, a cat, a dog, family meat, and a ravishing, ravished junkie lady&quot;. In &quot;Tristessa&quot;, Kerouac attempts to sketch for the reader a picture of quiet transcendence in hectic and sometimes dangerous circumstances. He chronicles Tristessa&#x27;s addiction to morphine and impoverished life with descriptions tinged with elements of her saintly beauty and her innocence.

Early in the novel, Kerouac attempts to communicate his Buddhist beliefs. These beliefs become entangled as a metaphor in the unfamiliar culture and language that Kerouac tries to grasp and make contact with in the story.

The self-destructive nature of her addiction contrast with the beauty of Kerouac&#x27;s descriptions. Also, as a part of the study of the life of a junkie, is the character of Old Bull Gaines - Bill Garver, in real life, a long-time friend of William S. Burroughs and other writers of the Beat Generation - who serves as both dealer and healer of Tristessa when Jack is unable to be what she needs.

<doc id="913672" wikidata="Q1076818" url="?curid=913672" title="Ukraine at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Ukraine competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s third consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics in the post-Soviet era. The National Olympic Committee of Ukraine sent the nation&#x27;s largest ever delegation to these Games. A total of 240 athletes, 125 men and 115 women, took part in 21 sports. Women&#x27;s handball was the only team-based sport in which Ukraine had its representation at these Games for the first time. There was only a single competitor in modern pentathlon and taekwondo.

The Ukrainian team featured several Olympic medalists from Sydney, including skeet shooter Mykola Milchev, heavyweight wrestler David Saldadze (who eventually represented Uzbekistan at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing), triple jumper Olena Hovorova, double defending swimming champion Yana Klochkova, and butterfly swimmer Denys Sylantyev, who later became the nation&#x27;s flag bearer in the opening ceremony. Double sculls rower Svitlana Maziy and freestyle swimmer Pavlo Khnykin were among the athletes to compete in fourth Olympic Games, although they originally played for either Soviet Union or the Unified Team. Rapid fire pistol shooter Oleh Tkachov, at age 42, was the oldest athlete of the team, while butterfly swimmer Kateryna Zubkova was the youngest at age 16.

Ukraine left Athens with a total of 22 medals, 8 golds, 5 silver, and 9 bronze, being considered the nation&#x27;s most successful Olympics since its debut in 1996.

<text>Rewa is a city in the north-eastern part of Madhya Pradesh state in India. It is the administrative center of Rewa District and Rewa Division. The city lies about northeast of the state capital Bhopal and north of the city of Jabalpur. The maximum length of Rewa district is 125 km from east to west and the length of Rewa from north to south is 96 km. This area is surrounded by Kaimur hills to the south Vindhyachal ranges pass through the middle of the district.

==Geography==
Rewa is located on . It has an average elevation of 259 metres (853 feet). Rewa is situated on Bank of Bihad and Bichhiya river, it&#x27;s on rewa pletaue sarounded with and vindhya and kaimur ranges .

==History==
The district of Rewa derives its name from the town of Rewa, the district headquarters, which is another name for the Narmada River.

Present day Rewa was part of the Baghelkhand region which extended from the present day Prayagraj in the North to Ratanpur in the South, Jabalpur in the West to Surajpur in the East.

=== Baghel Dynasty ===
Baghel Dynasty was founded by Bhimaldev (son of Vyaghradev, the chieftain of Vyaghrapalli) in 1236 CE. Baghelas are basically Chalukyans of Anhilwara (Gujarat).

The region was earlier governed by Lodhi and Sengar chieftains of Rajgond Dynasty. Lodhi&#x27;s Diwan Tiwari conspired with Baghelas and assisted in foundation of Baghela Rule in the Gahora Patti region. In return of this favour, Baghelas granted title of &quot;Singh Tiwari&quot; or &quot;Adhrajiya Tiwari&quot; to the Diwan Tiwari.

Raja Ramchandra shifted capital to Bandhavgarh, and later Raja Vikramjit Singh shifted capital to Rewa in 1605 CE.

Bandhavgarh Fort was sieged by Mughals. Tansen and Birbal (Mahesh Das) were in court of Ramchandra Singh Baghel.

Raghuraj Singh Baghel built Govindgarh Fort, which lies in between Govindgarh lake. Govindgarh is famous for its exquisite varieties of mangoes.

Raja Gulab Singh was called &quot;social reformer King&quot; of Rewa. Raja Martand Singh was the last Baghela Ruler. Later, the state joined the Union of India, after independence.

=== Revolt of 1857 ===
In the context of the 1857 Indian Rebellion, the princely state of Rewa played a significant role, but a controversial one. Thakur Ranmat Singh, a notable leader from Mankhari village in Satna district, emerged as a key figure in the uprising within the region. Holding the rank of Sardar in the Maharaja of Rewa&#x27;s service, Thakur Ranmat Singh became increasingly discontented with British interference, particularly by the Resident Political Agent, Willoughby Osborne.

Inspired by the rebellion&#x27;s broader momentum, Ranmat Singh led a formidable group of 2,000 rebels, besieging Osborne&#x27;s bungalow. Although Osborne escaped, the rebels continued their struggle, engaging in multiple battles across areas like Nagod, Bhilsain, Chitrakoot, Nowgong, and Keoti. These activities made Thakur Ranmat Singh a significant threat to British control in the area 

However, the Maharaja of Rewa, under British pressure, eventually turned against Ranmat Singh. Despite initial sympathies for his cause, the Maharaja facilitated Ranmat Singh&#x27;s capture. Thakur Ranmat Singh was arrested, charged with the murder of Europeans, and hanged in August 1859. 

This betrayal by the Rewa state highlights the complexities and internal conflicts during the 1857 Rebellion, where loyalty and resistance often intertwined in the fight against colonial rule.

The terms have been used by reviewers, publishers, scholars, authors and critics such as John Garth, Tom Shippey, Jane Chance and others to describe the published writings of J. R. R. Tolkien on Middle-earth as a whole. Other writers look to the entire body of work of the author as a &quot;Tolkien canon&quot;, rather than a subset defined by the fictional &quot;Middle-earth&quot; setting.

==Tolkien&#x27;s works==


The works on Middle-earth published by Tolkien during his lifetime include &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Tom Bombadil&quot;, and &quot;The Road Goes Ever On&quot;. After Tolkien&#x27;s death his son Christopher published &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; with many textual changes to knit several mostly unfinished manuscripts together as a coherent narrative. Further posthumous publications (with text more closely following Tolkien&#x27;s original) include &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot;, &quot;The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien&quot;, &quot;Bilbo&#x27;s Last Song&quot;, &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot;, &quot;Beren and Luthien&quot; and &quot;The Fall of Gondolin&quot;.

Christopher Tolkien also published the 12-volume &quot;History of Middle-earth&quot;, containing many texts, drafts, and notes by Tolkien (both early and late), together with Christopher&#x27;s own extensive notes placing these in context.

Further works authorized by the Tolkien Estate include &quot;The History of The Hobbit&quot; in two volumes by John D. Rateliff and &quot;The Annotated Hobbit&quot; by Douglas A. Anderson, both with notes and early drafts by Tolkien. Linguistic material by Tolkien concerning Middle-earth has also been published with the permission of the Estate in two periodical publications. The Qenya and Gnomish Lexicons, in full, appear in &quot;Parma Eldalamberon&quot; Numbers 11–16; other mostly self-contained fragments, notes, and poems appear in various issues of &quot;Vinyar Tengwar&quot;. All of this material together constitutes a collection which, much like real-world histories and mythologies, contains numerous points of obscurity, omission, or apparent contradiction.

=== &quot;The Hobbit&quot; ===
Although Tolkien said that &quot;The Hobbit&quot; was conceived separately from his mythological stories, early drafts show that it was set in that world, referring explicitly to characters and places which appeared in his &quot;Book of Lost Tales&quot; which would later become &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. The Necromancer was originally Thû, the precursor of Sauron; Thorin&#x27;s grandfather was imprisoned in the same dungeons that held Beren and Lúthien; the Elven king was Thingol and his land Menegroth.

When he revised &quot;The Hobbit&quot; to bring the story of the finding of the Ring in line with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, Tolkien retained the original version as the tale Bilbo told to justify his acquisition of the Ring.

=== &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ===
&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; picks up the story of &quot;The Hobbit&quot; some sixty years later, with some of the same locations and characters. Tolkien now explicitly linked the story to the &quot;Silmarillion&quot; tales, but placed it some six thousand years later in time. This reframing made some details in &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, such as the goblins&#x27; ready recognition of the ancient swords Orcrist and Glamdring, difficult to reconcile into a single history.

Other details from &quot;The Hobbit&quot; don&#x27;t quite mesh with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Frodo and his companions, for example, cover much the same territory in the Trollshaws as Bilbo and the Dwarves, but take much longer to reach Rivendell, and the geography is described differently. Several adjustments to &quot;The Hobbit&quot; only increased the discrepancies; and in the 1960s, Tolkien began rewriting &quot;The Hobbit&quot; more in the style and tone of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, adjusting the journey and landmarks to fit the later story, but ultimately abandoned the effort.

=== Writings after &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; ===

According to Christopher Tolkien, despite J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s desire to bring the older &quot;Silmarillion&quot; stories to a publishable state, much time was spent instead trying to bring consistency to the works already published. The unpublished manuscripts were left in various states of completion. These older stories had existed and changed over many decades, partly in response to &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;; as he reworked the material, he made substantial changes, up to and including the abandonment of major themes and entire tales, and wholesale rewrites and revisions of otherwise seemingly complete narratives.

Towards the end of his life, the focus of Tolkien&#x27;s writing shifted from story telling inspired by his philological pursuits to more philosophical concerns, and Tolkien never finished a unified, systematic, and internally consistent narrative.

=== The &quot;Silmarillion&quot; compilation ===
&quot;The Silmarillion&quot; was compiled by Christopher Tolkien (long involved in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s creative process) and published in 1977, four years after Tolkien’s death. It presents an abridged cycle of Tolkien&#x27;s drafts of his Elvish legends, in the legendarium that he worked on throughout his life, drawing material from the earliest &quot;Book of Lost Tales&quot; to drafts written long after &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Most of the original texts have subsequently appeared in the &quot;History of Middle-earth&quot;. Christopher&#x27;s goal was a version resembling what he thought at the time his father might have produced.

Christopher observed that absolute consistency among the Middle-earth tales could only be achieved by losing much that was good in them:

&quot;a complete consistency (either within the compass of &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; itself or between &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; and other published writings of my father&#x27;s) is not to be looked for, and could only be achieved, if at all, at heavy and needless cost.&quot;

He went on to say:

 &quot;My father came to conceive &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; as a compilation... and it is to some extent a compendium in fact and not only in theory.&quot;

Throughout his commentaries in &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; and the twelve volumes of &quot;The History of Middle-earth&quot;, Christopher Tolkien points out differences between various versions of the original texts and the final editorial selections and occasional alterations in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. In the Introduction of &quot;Unfinished Tales&quot; he observes that such selection was necessary to publishing a unified narrative; in some cases he later came to feel that he went too far, most particularly in creating a synthesis of original material and existing texts for the chapter on the ruin of Doriath in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;, where his father&#x27;s pre- and post-&quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; writings were apparently irreconcilable:

&quot;I think now that this was a mistaken view, and that the undoubted difficulties could have been and should have been, surmounted without so far overstepping the bounds of editorial function.&quot;

Editing for consistency can be seen by comparing the chapter &quot;Of the Voyage of Eärendil&quot; in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; with its corresponding section in the &quot;History of Middle-earth&quot; Volume V (&quot;The Lost Road and Other Writings&quot;). The &quot;Quenta Silmarillion&quot; of the 1930s was Tolkien&#x27;s final text for this section, and Christopher carried it forward into &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; nearly word for word with editorial modifications—for consistency with other works—primarily limited to nomenclature: Fionwë edited to Eönwë, Lindar to Vanyar, etc. For example:

From &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;: &quot;In the front of that fire came Glaurung the golden, father of dragons, in his full might; and in his train were Balrogs, and behind them came the black armies of the Orcs in multitudes such as the Noldor had never before seen or imagined.&quot; — p. 151.

From &quot;The Lost Road&quot;: &quot;In the front of that fire came Glómund the golden, the father of dragons, and in his train were Balrogs, and behind them came the black armies of the Orcs in multitudes such as the Gnomes had never before seen or imagined.&quot; — p. 280.
In the continuing development of the published history of Middle-earth, Christopher Tolkien quotes in &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot; his father&#x27;s own words on his fictional universe:

&quot;once upon a time... I had in mind to make a body of more or less connected legend... I would draw some of the great tales in fullness, and leave many only placed in the scheme, and sketched.&quot;

Christopher Tolkien offers this justification for exercising his editorial authority to produce &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot; as a separate book:

&quot;...it has seemed to me that there was a good case for presenting my father&#x27;s long version of the legend of the Children of Húrin as an independent work, between its own covers, with a minimum of editorial presence, and above all in continuous narrative without gaps or interruptions, if this could be done without distortion or invention, despite the unfinished state in which he left parts of it.&quot;
Ethan Gilsdorf reviewing &quot;The Children of Húrin&quot; wrote of the editorial function: &quot;Of almost equal interest is Christopher Tolkien&#x27;s task editing his father&#x27;s abandoned projects. In his appendix, he explains his editorial process this way: &quot;While I have had to introduce bridging passages here and there in the piecing together of different drafts, there is no element of extraneous &#x27;invention&#x27; of any kind, however slight.&quot; He was criticized for having monkeyed with his father&#x27;s text when putting &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; together. This pre-emptive strike must be meant to allay the fears of Tolkien&#x27;s most persnickety readers.&quot;

==Fictional canon for Middle-earth==

As a result of the manner of its creation, the secondary world of Middle-earth is complicated. Its creator developed various elements of his fiction over the course of decades, making substantial changes including the abandonment of major themes, facts and entire tales, and undertook wholesale rewrites and revisions of otherwise &quot;complete&quot; narratives. The author&#x27;s opinions on the relationships of his texts to each other often changed. In his letters, Tolkien comments upon the intertextual relationships of his works:

&quot;I am doubtful myself about the undertaking [of finishing &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;]. Part of the attraction of the L.R. [&quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;] is, I think, due to the glimpses of a large history in the background: an attraction like that of viewing far off an unvisited island, or seeing the towers of a distant city gleaming in a sunlit mist. To go there is to destroy the magic, unless new unattainable vistas are again revealed.&quot;

The quest by some readers for a consistent fictional canon within some subset of Tolkien&#x27;s writings was noted by Verlyn Flieger. Since the degree of narrative consistency that might be expected from a series of novels is not always found in Tolkien&#x27;s work, Flieger attributed the need on the part of some readers to find consistency within the stories to the sense of reality that Tolkien strove to instil in his work, although the search for a definitive fictional canon has been seen as ultimately irrelevant to appreciation of his tales.

The desire for a Middle-earth canon arises from the need of some readers to form an internal consistency between the stories, a need related to their &quot;willing suspension of disbelief&quot;. Tolkien, in his essay &quot;On Fairy Stories&quot;, claimed that no individual fantasy story can be successful without maintaining an &quot;inner consistency of reality&quot;. An author, he says:
&quot;... makes a Secondary World which your mind can enter. Inside it, what he relates is &#x27;true&#x27;: it accords with the laws of that world. ... The moment disbelief arises, the spell is broken; the magic, or rather art, has failed.&quot;
W.H. Auden, former student of Tolkien, supports this notion in his review of one of Tolkien&#x27;s books:&quot;Of any imaginary world the reader demands that it seem real, and the standard of realism demanded today is much stricter than in the time, say, of Malory.&quot;

<text>WDTN (channel 2) is a television station in Dayton, Ohio, United States, affiliated with NBC. It is owned by Nexstar Media Group, which provides certain services to Springfield, Ohio–licensed WBDT (channel 26), a &quot;de facto&quot; owned-and-operated station of The CW, under a local marketing agreement (LMA) with Vaughan Media. The two stations share studios on South Dixie Drive in Moraine, Ohio.

WDTN&#x27;s transmitter facility is located off Frytown Road in an exclave of Jefferson Township surrounded by the southwest Dayton neighborhoods of Germantown Meadow, Highview Hills and Stoney Ridge; through a channel sharing agreement, it shares its digital channel with WBDT, along with unrelated Richmond, Indiana–licensed Ion Television O&amp;O WKOI-TV (channel 43).

==History==

===Early years===
The construction permit for what is now WDTN was awarded to the Crosley Broadcasting Corporation of Cincinnati on April 4, 1947. It was the first broadcast television license granted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to Dayton. However, due to several delays, the station did not actually go on the air until March 15, 1949, as WLWD, on channel 5, twenty days after CBS affiliate WHIO-TV began broadcasting. From the very first day, it has operated from a studio and office facility located in a former skating rink on Dixie Drive in Moraine. (The property has changed jurisdictions since the original airdate: first it was within the now-defunct Van Buren Township, which voted to incorporate as Kettering in November 1952; in 1953, the western portion of Kettering, which included the property, voted to secede, forming Moraine Township, which in turn incorporated as Moraine in 1957.)

WLWD was the second link of a group of inter-connected stations which made up the &quot;WLW Television Network&quot;, and was named for Crosley&#x27;s flagship Cincinnati radio station WLW; the &quot;D&quot; referred to Dayton. The other stations were WLWT in Cincinnati and WLWC (now WCMH-TV) in Columbus, both also owned by Crosley. The three outlets shared common regional programming, most of which was produced in Cincinnati and sent by way of microwave link to Dayton and Columbus (such as &quot;The 50-50 Club&quot; with Ruth Lyons, and later Bob Braun; &quot;The Paul Dixon Show&quot;; and &quot;Midwestern Hayride&quot;). All three stations were also NBC affiliates, and had secondary relationships with the DuMont Television Network; WLWD also carried ABC programs. The first program shown on WLWD was NBC&#x27;s &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot;, with Milton Berle. To reflect their connection to each other, the WLW Television stations hyphenated their call signs on air; the Dayton outlet was known as WLW-D. The Crosley television group would later expand to include WLWA (now WXIA-TV) in Atlanta, WLWI (now WTHR) in Indianapolis, and WOAI-TV in San Antonio.

The release of the FCC&#x27;s &quot;Sixth Report and Order&quot; in 1952 resulted in shifts of VHF channel assignments in the Midwest region. In Ohio, WLWD&#x27;s channel 5 allocation was moved to Cincinnati and given to sister station WLWT, with the Dayton station reassigned to transmit over channel 2. WLWD&#x27;s channel change took place on April 27, 1953. WHIO-TV, Dayton&#x27;s only other station at the time, also shifted channels (from 13 to 7) as a result of the same ordinance. Along with the channel shift WLWD was also forced to operate with a shorter transmission tower, to reduce the overlap of its new channel 2 signal with the relocated signals of WLWT (which moved from channel 4 to channel 5) and WLWC (which shifted to channel 4 from channel 3). The analog channel 2 signal traveled a very long distance under normal conditions.

WLWD lost DuMont in 1955, a few months before the network shut down. It lost ABC in 1965 (though it cleared some ABC daytime programming until 1971 as a secondary affiliate) when then-independent WONE-TV (channel 22, now WKEF) picked up ABC&#x27;s prime time programming.

In 1968 the Crosley group took on the name of its parent company and became known as Avco Broadcasting, a subsidiary of the Aviation Corporation (later known as Avco). After the FCC restricted the common ownership of stations with overlapping signals in the late 1960s, it grandfathered Avco&#x27;s common ownership of WLWD, WLWT, WLWC and of WLW radio in Cincinnati. Even from its shorter tower, WLWD&#x27;s city-grade signal reached as far as Cincinnati and as far north as the Columbus suburbs, while WLW radio&#x27;s 50-kilowatt signal covered nearly all of Ohio and overlapped with all three television stations.

In 1975, Avco decided to exit broadcasting. As a result, WLWD lost its grandfathered protection, and had to be sold off separately from WLWT and WLWC. WLWD ended up being the last of Avco&#x27;s television stations to be sold off, going to Grinnell College in Iowa for $13 million in June 1975; the acquisition made Grinnell College one of a few universities in the country to own a commercial television station. The school changed the call letters to WDTN shortly after the sale closed on June 16, 1976. Not long after Grinnell took over, WDTN increased the height on its broadcast tower and began operating at full effective radiated power, increasing its coverage area. (The WLWD call sign was used from April 2003 until April 2010 for an FM radio station serving Lima, now WBKS. The call sign has been used since October 12, 2010, by Daystar station WLWD-LD (channel 20), licensed to Springfield.)

===Switch to ABC===
By the mid to late-1970s, ABC was searching for stronger affiliates in order to cement its status as the leading network in the United States. Its existing Dayton affiliate, WKEF, was a distant third in the ratings, and only ran ABC&#x27;s prime time and sports programming, plus whatever daytime programming was preempted by two Taft Broadcasting–owned ABC affiliates in adjacent markets, WKRC-TV in Cincinnati (now with CBS) and WTVN-TV (now WSYX) in Columbus. WKEF also did not have a functioning news department until 1979. Meanwhile, WKRC-TV and WTVN-TV were not only preempting ABC&#x27;s daytime programs, but also its late night shows and some of its Saturday morning cartoons. ABC also wanted a station in Dayton with both stronger ratings and signal, and one which could reach portions of the Cincinnati and Columbus markets. In summer 1979, ABC approached WDTN and reached an affiliation deal. Almost by default, NBC was then left to go with WKEF. On January 1, 1980, WDTN and WKEF swapped network affiliations. Five months after joining ABC, in May 1980, Grinnell College announced it would sell WDTN to the broadcasting division of the Hearst Corporation. The sale was finalized over a year later, in September 1981 for a price of over $47 million.

In August 1997, Hearst&#x27;s television group merged with Argyle Television Holdings II to form what was then known as Hearst-Argyle Television. Argyle had purchased WDTN&#x27;s former sister station, WLWT, that January, as part of a trade deal between Argyle II and Gannett Broadcasting which caused WLWT and its Oklahoma City sister station, KOCO-TV, to swap ownership with WZZM in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and WGRZ-TV in Buffalo, New York. For the same reason that forced the breakup of Avco&#x27;s television group 20 years earlier, Hearst-Argyle could not keep both stations (common ownership of stations with overlapping city-grade signals would not be allowed until 2000). It opted to keep the larger WLWT and trade WDTN, together with WNAC-TV in Providence, Rhode Island, to Sunrise Television for WPTZ in Plattsburgh, New York, WNNE in Hartford, Vermont, and KSBW in Salinas, California. The sale was finalized on July 2, 1998.

In May 2002, Sunrise merged with LIN TV; both television companies were owned by private equity firm Hicks, Muse, Tate &amp; Furst.

===Return to NBC===
In early 2004, NBC landed a new affiliation agreement with LIN TV; in response to this agreement, ABC signed an affiliation deal with Sinclair Broadcasting Group, which renewed the network&#x27;s affiliations with the group&#x27;s existing ABC affiliates and caused WKEF and its sister stations in Springfield/Decatur, Illinois (WICS and WICD), to switch to that network. On August 30, 2004, in a reversal of the 1980 switch, WDTN returned to NBC after 24 years away to take advantage of the network&#x27;s then-stronger programming. Ironically, several months after the affiliation shift, ABC&#x27;s ratings overtook those of NBC and the network wouldn&#x27;t rebound for nearly a decade; in 2014, NBC had regained the lead over ABC.

On May 18, 2007, LIN TV announced that it was exploring strategic alternatives that could have resulted in the sale of the company. In early June, WDTN&#x27;s website (along with those of several other LIN TV-owned stations not affiliated with Fox such as WNDY-TV, WWHO, WAND, WWLP, and WLFI-TV) underwent a redesign. The web addresses were then operated by the Local Media Network division of World Now for a little over a year until October 2008, when LIN TV relaunched most of its station websites through Fox Interactive Media (later spun off as the independent company known today as EndPlay). Prior to the World Now contract, the web addresses were powered by Web Pros.

On October 3, 2008, LIN TV pulled WDTN (and its other stations) from Time Warner Cable, due to a dispute over &quot;retransmission fees&quot;. Time Warner replaced WDTN with a free preview of HBO Family.

On October 29, LIN TV and Time Warner Cable reached an agreement, restoring WDTN, as well as offering it in high definition on the cable system for the first time.

On June 4, 2010, it was announced LIN TV would begin operating CW affiliate WBDT (then owned by ACME Communications) through shared service and joint sales agreements. Three months later, LIN TV exercised an option to purchase that channel along with another LIN-operated ACME station, fellow CW affiliate WCWF in Green Bay, Wisconsin. LIN TV requested WBDT&#x27;s license be assigned to a subsidiary of Vaughan Media (owner of CW affiliate KNVA in Austin, Texas, which was also operated by LIN TV). The company holds a 4.5% equity stake in Vaughan Media, but controls most of that company&#x27;s voting stock, effectively making it a shell corporation for LIN TV. WBDT was integrated into WDTN&#x27;s facilities and the merger between the two stations occurred sometime around October 2010. WBDT originally had studios at Corporate Place in Miamisburg, along Byers Road.

On March 4, 2011, LIN TV&#x27;s contract with DISH Network expired, and all TV stations owned or operated by LIN, including WDTN and WBDT, were pulled from DISH. On March 13, LIN and DISH entered into a retransmission consent agreement, and all affected channels were restored.

On March 21, 2014, Media General announced that it would buy LIN. The FCC approved the merger on December 12, 2014, but a condition of the deal requires Media General to end the JSA between WBDT and WDTN due to tighter scrutiny such deals are getting by the FCC. Media General received a two-year waiver to end the JSA between WDTN and WBDT. The merger was completed on December 19, reuniting WDTN with WCMH-TV (the former WLWC).

On January 27, 2016, it was announced that Nexstar Broadcasting Group would buy Media General for $4.6 billion, and WDTN became part of &quot;Nexstar Media Group&quot;. The deal was approved by the FCC on January 11, 2017, and it was completed on January 17.

A carriage dispute with AT&amp;T, lasting from 11:59 p.m. on July 3 to August 29, 2019, resulted in the removal of WDTN, along with more than 120 other Nexstar stations across 97 markets, from AT&amp;T&#x27;s DirecTV, DirecTV Now and U-verse platforms.

A carriage dispute with Dish Network, beginning at 7 p.m. on December 2, 2020, resulted in the removal of WDTN and sister station WBDT from the platform, along with 164 Nexstar stations in 115 markets.

A carriage dispute with DirecTV from July 2 to September 17, 2023, resulted in the removal of WDTN, along with 158 other Nexstar stations, from DirecTV, U-verse and DirecTV Stream.

==Programming==
Game show host and announcer Johnny Gilbert hosted his own local daytime variety/talk show on WLWD immediately after the local airing of WLW television&#x27;s &quot;Paul Dixon Show&quot; in the mid-1960s.

Phil Donahue (former news anchor and radio talk show host at WHIO radio) began hosting a talk show on WLWD in 1967, called &quot;The Phil Donahue Show&quot;, that was then more issue-oriented (greatly reducing the station&#x27;s program budget). Donahue&#x27;s show went national in 1970. Since most programs on the WLW television regional network originated from WLWT in Cincinnati, it was the first time WLWD was the originator of a program.

Aside from Paul Dixon&#x27;s weekday morning show, other Cincinnati-based programming that aired on WLWD included: &quot;The 50-50 Club&quot;, hosted by Ruth Lyons (succeeded by Bob Braun after Lyons&#x27; 1967 retirement), and the Saturday evening country music program &quot;Midwestern Hayride&quot;.

Due to WLWD&#x27;s heavy local and regional programming schedule, many network programs from NBC and ABC were recorded on film as a kinescope for later airing. On rare occasions when a program was unavailable (sometimes due to network technical difficulties or if fill time was available before or after a network sportscast), a half-hour series entitled &quot;Star Performance&quot;, consisting mostly of drama pilots from the 1950s, would air. Fifteen-minute mini-documentaries or newsreels would also air as a time filler under the title &quot;Miniature Theater&quot;.

During the summer of 1983, WDTN was exempted from running ABC&#x27;s soap operas after 2 p.m., since WKRC-TV&#x27;s signal easily covered Dayton. As a result, the station ran cartoons and off-network sitcoms in place of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; and &quot;General Hospital&quot;. By the late 1980s, these were replaced with first run talk shows such as &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot; (at 4 p.m.), &quot;The Montel Williams Show&quot;, and &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot;. WDTN would begin its talk block at 2 p.m. during the week. In 2000, Time Warner Cable (Dayton&#x27;s largest cable system) dropped the Cincinnati network affiliates to make room for new cable channels. The Cincinnati stations had been available on cable in the Dayton area ever since cable arrived there in the mid-1960s. As a result, ABC soap viewers could no longer see &quot;One Life to Live&quot; or &quot;General Hospital&quot;, while over-the-air viewers could still pick them up on WCPO-TV (which had become Cincinnati&#x27;s ABC affiliate in 1996). In the fall of 2000, &quot;General Hospital&quot; returned to WDTN&#x27;s schedule; after the station came under the control of LIN TV in May 2002, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; was added to the schedule as well. From this point on, WDTN aired the entire ABC schedule in pattern until the station returned to NBC in 2004.

===News operation===
In the 1970s and 1980s, WDTN used the &quot;Eyewitness News&quot; branding. For most of its history, its newscasts have been a runner-up to market leader WHIO-TV. On April 11, 2012, the station announced that it was in the process of reconstructing its studios in preparation for the production of high definition content. After June 8, 2012, newscasts were moved to the station&#x27;s newsroom as the new news set was being built in the same location as the old one. The first high definition newscast was at 6 p.m. on Saturday, July 21, 2012. WDTN was the second station in Dayton to have made the upgrade to HD newscasts; the shows on WBDT were included in the upgrade.

On August 18, 2007, the station began to produce a nightly prime time newscast for WBDT, known as &quot;2 News at 10 on Dayton&#x27;s CW&quot;. This show achieved higher ratings than WRGT-TV&#x27;s nightly prime time news in Dayton&#x27;s metered market households on the 26th day of its broadcast. That year, &quot;2 News&quot; won the &quot;Edward R. Murrow Award for Overall Excellence&quot; for the second straight year.

In May 2011, the station changed the name of its weekday 5–7 a.m. newscast from &quot;2 News Sunrise&quot; to &quot;2 News Today&quot;. On November 14, 2011, the station moved &quot;2 News Today&quot;&#x27;s start time to 4:30 a.m., probably in response to WHIO-TV&#x27;s similar lengthening of its morning news on August 15.

In August 2011, the station announced plans to replace its weekday hour-long newscast, &quot;2 News at Noon&quot;, with a local lifestyle talk show called &quot;Living Dayton&quot;, starting in early January 2012. It was planned that anchor Marsha Bonhart, Holly Samuels and meteorologist Jamie Jarosik would deliver news and weather at the top of the broadcast, and that the show would cover any breaking news. &quot;Living Dayton&quot; premiered on February 6, 2012, with newly hired hosts Nathalie Basha and Zuri Hall. Later on February 6, it was announced that Jim Bucher would join the show as a contributor. The inclusion of news headlines and a weather forecast began on February 9; on the same day, Basha and Hall began providing a brief commentary-style discussion of topical issues, sometimes with a guest contributor, immediately following the news/weather segment.

On January 7, 2013, WBDT began to air a weekday news program from 7 to 9 a.m., called &quot;2 News Today on Dayton&#x27;s CW&quot;.

In January 2015, the station renamed its hour-long 5 p.m. weekday newscast &quot;Five on 2&quot;, and included more features, interviews and longer-form stories.

On September 11, 2017, the station added an hour-long 4 p.m. weekday newscast, &quot;2 News First at 4&quot;; it is the first and only 4 p.m. local newscast in the market.

On April 4, 2020, WDTN debuted a weekend morning newscast airing Saturdays and Sundays from 6 to 8 a.m.

On July 23, 2021, WDTN debuted a new set, with updated graphics having been rolled out in the preceding weeks.

On September 2, 2021, Mark Allan, anchor for over 25 years, retired from broadcasting. Allan arrived at the station in fall 1995 from KAKE (TV) in Wichita, Kansas, first anchoring coverage of the then-ongoing Dayton Peace Accords.

WDTN includes segments from the syndicated consumer and personal finance series &quot;Money Talks with Stacy Johnson&quot; as part of its newscasts.

The station maintains news partnerships with several area newspapers. In addition to its main studios, WDTN operates bureaus in Springfield (on West Main Street) and in Xenia (in the &quot;Xenia Daily Gazette&quot; newsroom on South Detroit Street).
WDTN operates its own weather radar known on-air as &quot;Live Doppler 2 HD&quot; (formerly as &quot;Live Doppler 2X&quot;). The station&#x27;s weather reports are branded as &quot;Storm Team 2&quot; and &quot;were&quot; sometimes branded as &quot;Live Doppler 2X&quot;.

For many years, Charlie Van Dyke was the voice heard on WDTN&#x27;s station IDs, news intros, promos, and other voice-over work. In September 2011, Van Dyke was replaced by Roger Rose.

==Technical information==

===Subchannels===
&lt;section begin=subs /&gt;
&lt;section end=subs /&gt;
On January 1, 2016, WDTN added the Escape network (now Ion Mystery) to its lineup on its second digital subchannel, replacing a standard-definition feed of the main WDTN programming previously airing on that subchannel. On January 31, 2016, the station added the Justice Network to its third digital subchannel. On February 1, 2018, the Justice Network was dropped, replaced by Ion Television, which was moved from sister station WBDT&#x27;s DT3 subchannel.

On June 7, 2018, unrelated WKOI-TV began sharing WDTN&#x27;s digital channel, with Ion Television programming appearing on virtual channel 43.1. WDTN also continued to carry Ion Television on virtual channel 2.3.

Sister station WBDT began sharing WDTN&#x27;s digital channel on June 29, 2018; on that date, virtual channel 2.3 was dropped.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WDTN shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 50, using virtual channel 2. WDTN moved its digital signal from channel 50 to channel 31 on November 8, 2019, as part of the FCC&#x27;s spectrum reallocation process.

<doc id="913685" wikidata="Q4430680" url="?curid=913685" title="Sparks Street">
<text>Sparks Street () is a pedestrian mall in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It was a main street in Ottawa that was converted into an outdoor pedestrian street in 1967, making it the earliest such street or mall in Canada.

Sparks runs from Elgin Street in the east to Bronson Avenue in the west. The Sparks Street Mall, which contains a number of outdoor restaurants and several works of art and fountains, only runs from Elgin to Bank Street. The pedestrian-only portion continues for another two blocks westward. The final two blocks, west of Lyon Street, consist of a regular road, merging into Bronson Avenue heading south.

The mall and most of the buildings on the south side are owned and operated by the National Capital Commission. Buildings on the north side of the mall were expropriated by the Government of Canada in 1973, and are currently operated by Public Works and Government Services Canada.

==History==
Located one block south of Wellington Street (the home of the Parliament of Canada), Sparks Street is one of Ottawa&#x27;s more historical streets and features a number of heritage buildings. The street is named after Nicholas Sparks, a farmer who, early in the mid-nineteenth century, cut a path through the woods on his holding, which would eventually become this street.
When Ottawa was selected as Canada&#x27;s capital, this area became even more important, as the street became home to a number of government offices and homes for parliamentarians. One of these was Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee who, in 1868, was assassinated outside his home at the corner of Sparks and Metcalfe. The street also became Ottawa&#x27;s commercial hub in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and was home to a number of the city&#x27;s banks and the lumber companies of the Ottawa Valley, as well as &quot;the best shops, hotels, dining rooms, and theatres.&quot;. It once contained the Murphy-Gamble (later Simpson&#x27;s), Morgan&#x27;s, C. Ross, and Bryson-Graham&#x27;s department stores.

The peak of the street was in the early twentieth century, when a number of Beaux-Arts buildings that still stand were erected. At the time, the eastern end of Sparks Street continued across the Rideau Canal on Sappers Bridge. Where the War Memorial and Confederation Square stands today, was the Russell House hotel, and Ottawa&#x27;s old Post Office. The square was built in the 1930s.

As the city expanded, the downtown area became less centralized and commerce spread to neighbouring streets. Government ministries, requiring larger offices, also went elsewhere. In 1959, the street&#x27;s streetcar line (Bank Street to Rideau Canal) was closed.

===Pedestrian mall===
Starting in 1960, the street was closed to vehicular traffic in the summers in an attempt to improve commerce. This plan was modelled on Toledo, Ohio, which along with Kalamazoo were the first North American cities to close downtown streets in an attempt to recapture customers. The success of these temporary summer closings convinced the city to close the street permanently to vehicles in 1967. Although initially successful, the mall began to decline in the 1970s. Urban planning professor David Gordon, of Queen&#x27;s University, blames the growth of suburban shopping malls. Another major problem was the growth of highrise government offices with internal concourses in the area. Gordan and Bray wrote that Sparks became &quot;an isolated island of pedestrian-friendly space in a traffic-dominated district&quot; in a 2003 report. Additionally, the Government of Canada is a major landlord on the street, its buildings presenting a &quot;blank face&quot; to the street, and discouraging shops from investing in the area long-term.

Today, the pedestrian mall is open year-round and extends from Elgin to Kent Streets. Although the mall is quite busy during the week, it is only lightly used on the weekend. The National Capital Commission remains committed to operating and improving the mall. The street&#x27;s landscaping has been updated. The Commission was successful in bringing the CBC Ottawa Broadcast Centre to a location on the mall, and is seeking to increase business and activity by increasing the number of residences nearby. However, the CBC development has been criticized as &quot;just another low-cost, banal building&quot; which was designed poorly and has not brought more life to the street. Councillor Diane Holmes called it &quot;the biggest disappointment,&quot; and &quot;a whole block of deadness.&quot;

==Events==

Sparks Street is home to the Sparks Street International Chicken &amp; Rib Cook-off every year in late June.

Each year, around the August civic holiday, Sparks street plays host to the Ottawa International Buskers Festival, where buskers from around the world come to showcase their art to tourists and locals in downtown Ottawa.

Latin Sparks Festival made its debut in 2012 as a small group of 40 friends gathered weekly on Sparks Street to dance outdoors in the summertime. Sparks Street is home to Latin Sparks Festival since 2012, featuring music, dancing and food.

==Landmarks==

Sparks contains some of Ottawa&#x27;s most important structures. Just past the eastern end of Sparks at Elgin Street is the National War Memorial and across Elgin from Sparks is the National Arts Centre.

The eastern section of the street has a number of the city&#x27;s older buildings, including Ottawa&#x27;s post office from 1939; the Ottawa Electric Building, built in 1926 by the founders of the Ottawa Electric Railway, Ottawa&#x27;s streetcar system; Ottawa&#x27;s first high-rise: the Bible House/old James Hope building at 61 Sparks, built in 1910; and branches of a number of Canada&#x27;s banks from the same era.

A pair of notable newer buildings are also on this section of the mall, including the CBC Ottawa Broadcast Centre and the Thomas D&#x27;Arcy McGee Building, which is located at the corner of Metcalfe and Sparks Streets.

West of Bank Street, outside of the mall itself, the street is overshadowed by the C.D. Howe Building, the home of Industry Canada to the south, and the headquarters of the Bank of Canada to the north. West of the bank is the Ottawa Marriott Hotel and Place de Ville&#x27;s Podium Building and Tower C, once the tallest building in Ottawa and home of Transport Canada. On the north side is home of the Department of Justice in St. Andrew&#x27;s Towers and the East Memorial Building, with other government departments in the West Memorial Building. West of these buildings the street becomes far less notable, being home to several hotels and smaller buildings. The final block of this rather short street has the Garden of the Provinces and Territories to the north and Christ Church Cathedral, Ottawa&#x27;s main Anglican church, to the south.

One of the best known addresses in all of Canada for many years was &quot;56 Sparks Street, Ottawa&quot; as it was the tag line used in a large number of radio and television commercials and commentaries made by Lotta Hitschmanova, founder of the humanitarian charity USC Canada, which moved to an office at 56 Sparks Street soon after it was created in 1945.

==Transit access==
On September 14, 2019, the O-Train&#x27;s Confederation Line was opened, under Queen Street and one block south of Sparks. Both Lyon and Parliament (&quot;Parlement&quot; in French) stations serves the area.

Phatudi was born in Ga-Mphahlele, the son of the chief of the Mphahlele tribe. He earned his basic education in mission schools.

==Education==

Phatudi initially worked as a teacher and educational administrator before attending the University of Fort Hare, gaining a BA in 1947 and a teaching diploma in 1950 at the University of the Witwatersrand, and graduating with a BEd in 1965. It was during this time that he made his contributions to the Sepedi language. He authored and co-authored a few books in Sepedi. He is also known to have translated some of Shakespeare&#x27;s works into Sepedi.

His books include the Lehlabile Series, co-authored with G.O. Mojapelo (), published by Educum.

He was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of the North in 1973, after which he encouraged others to use the &quot;Dr&quot; title wherever possible when referring to him.

Phatudi served as president of the Federation of Inspectors of Schools in South Africa from 1958 to 1969.

==Chief Minister of Lebowa==

Phatudi became involved in the nascent Lebowa nation building exercise and had risen in prominence to the extent that when Lebowa was granted self-government on 2 October 1972, he was appointed Minister for Education before his election as Chief Minister on 8 May 1973. Not one for wasting time settling into the role, Phatudi had been Chief Minister for one day when he informed the South African government that if Lebowa was to become self-sufficient then substantial tracts of South Africa, including a number of white towns, would need to be added to Lebowan territory. The statement was not well received in Pretoria, although they did eventually transfer several small tracts of land to Lebowa.

The earlier outburst aside, Phatudi was considered the most tactful of the bantustan leaders, with a modus operandi directed more at calm negotiations with Pretoria and dissident bodies than the angry outbursts epitomised by leaders like the Transkei&#x27;s Kaiser Matanzima. However, when these failed, Phatudi was not above unleashing his police against political opponents.

Phatudi also successfully negotiated that Es&#x27;kia Mphahlele, who was then a prohibited person, be allowed back into the country. After this success, he later also attempted to negotiate the release of Nelson Mandela, but unfortunately this was not realised.

Economic problems continued to plague Lebowa and Phatudi struggled to maintain control over the increasingly disgruntled homeland population throughout his rule. He died in office in 1987.

He was succeeded by Noko Nelson Ramodike from Tzaneen. Lebowa itself only lasted another seven years before its reintegration into Transvaal.

<text>The New Zealand Liberal Party () was the first organised political party in New Zealand. It governed from 1891 until 1912. The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small land-owning farmers who supported Liberal ideals, by buying large tracts of Māori land and selling it to small farmers on credit. The Liberal Government also established the basis of the later welfare state, with old age pensions, developed a system for settling industrial disputes, which was accepted by both employers and trade unions. In 1893 it extended voting rights to women, making New Zealand the first country in the world to enact universal adult suffrage. The Liberal Party became extremely successful, winning seven consecutive elections and the popular vote in each.

New Zealand gained international attention for the Liberal reforms, especially how the state regulated labour relations. It was innovating in the areas of maximum hour regulations and compulsory arbitration procedures. Under the Liberal administration the country also became the first to implement a minimum wage and to give women the right to vote. The goal was to encourage unions but discourage strikes and class conflict. The impact was especially strong on the reform movement in the United States.

It is widely argued that the New Zealand Liberal Party in 1891 lacked a clearcut ideology to guide them. Instead they approached the nation&#x27;s problems pragmatically, keeping in mind the constraints imposed by democratic public opinion. To deal with the issue of land distribution, they worked out innovative solutions to access, tenure, and a graduated tax on unimproved values.

Out of office after 1912, the Liberals gradually found themselves pressed between the conservative Reform Party and the growing Labour Party. The Liberals fragmented in the 1920s, and the remnant of the Liberal Party—later known as the United Party—eventually merged with Reform in 1936 to establish the modern National Party.

==Liberal Government==
Prior to the establishment of the Liberal Party, MPs were all independent, although often grouped themselves into loose factions. Some of these factions were occasionally referred to as &quot;parties&quot;, but were vague and ill-defined. In the history of Parliament, factions were formed around a number of different views – at one time, centralism and provincialism were the basis of factions, while at another time, factions were based on geographical region. Towards the 1880s, however, factions had gradually become stabilised along lines of liberalism and conservatism, although the line between the two was by no means certain. The first mentions of a &quot;Liberal Party&quot; were during the government led by Sir George Grey which was viewed as having a broadly liberal policy agenda. By 1879 many towns and cities had established liberal associations to promote liberal policies and candidates. These associations were to form the nexus of what would later become the nationwide Liberal Party.

The key figure in the establishment of the Liberal Party was John Ballance. Ballance, an MP, had served in a number of liberal-orientated governments, and had held office in posts such as Treasurer, Minister of Defence, and Minister of Native Affairs. He had a well-established reputation as a liberal, and was known for supporting land reform, women&#x27;s suffrage, and Māori rights.

During the last term in power of Harry Atkinson, a conservative, Ballance began to organise the liberal-aligned opposition into a more united movement, and was officially named Leader of the Opposition in July 1889. In the 1890 elections, Ballance led his liberal faction to victory, and early in the new year, became Premier. Ballance and his allies, recognising the benefit that they had gained from their unity, set about building a permanent organisation. The Liberal Party, with common policies and a well-defined leadership, was proclaimed. A national party organisation (called the Liberal Federation) was established, with supporters of the new party encouraged to become members and help organise party activities – this was a new development in New Zealand, as previously, parliamentary factions existed only as loose groupings of politicians, not as structured party organizations.

==Early days==
The Liberal Party drew its support from two basic sources – the cities, and small farmers. In the cities, the Liberals were supported particularly strongly by workers and labourers, but also by the more socially progressive members of the middle class. In the countryside, the Liberals won support from those farmers who lacked the ability to compete with the large , who monopolised most of the available land. Both groups saw themselves as being mistreated and oppressed by what had been described as New Zealand&#x27;s &quot;early colonial gentry&quot; – the well-educated and aristocratic land-owners and commercial magnates. It was this group that most strongly opposed the Liberal Party, denouncing its policies as an attempt by the unsuccessful to rob the prosperous.

In power, the Liberals enacted a large number of social, health, and economic reforms. This was made possible by their unity – previously, reforms had stalled due to the need for long and complex negotiations to win support from individual MPs. Among the changes introduced were land reforms, progressive taxes on land and income, and legislation to improve the working conditions of urban labourers. Many of the Liberal Party&#x27;s policies were described as &quot;socialist&quot; by both its opponents and sympathetic international observers such as André Siegfried and Albert Métin, but there is debate over whether this label is valid. William Pember Reeves, a Liberal Party politician and theorist, said that while the party supported an active role for the state, particularly in social matters, it did not in any way seek to discourage or inhibit private enterprise. Many historians have claimed that the Liberal Party&#x27;s policies were based more on pragmatism than on ideology, although politicians such as Ballance and Reeves definitely had theories behind their actions.

==Dominance==

In 1893, John Ballance died unexpectedly, leaving the Liberal Party&#x27;s leadership open. It is believed that Ballance wished Robert Stout, a colleague known for his liberal views, to succeed him, but in the end, the leadership passed to Richard Seddon. Although Seddon went on to become New Zealand&#x27;s longest serving Prime Minister, he was not as highly regarded by the Liberal Party as he was by the general public. In particular, Seddon&#x27;s social views were more conservative than those of Ballance or Stout, and he was seen by many as having a controlling and autocratic style of management. Seddon had originally assumed the leadership on an interim basis, with a full caucus vote intended for a later date, but no such vote was ever held. Stout and his liberal colleagues challenged this, but were unsuccessful – although many in the party were uneasy about Seddon&#x27;s views, Seddon himself was charismatic, and it was correctly predicted that he would win considerable support from the public.

An early clash between the Liberal Party&#x27;s two wings came over the issue of women&#x27;s suffrage. Ballance had been a strong supporter of the suffrage movement, having proclaimed his belief in the &quot;absolute equality of the sexes&quot;, but Seddon was opposed. Considerable bitterness arose over the matter, with Stout and his allies strongly promoting suffrage despite Seddon&#x27;s hostility. In the end, the pro-suffrage MPs were able to get enough support to pass the measure despite their leader actively campaigning against it.

In other matters, however, Seddon was more closely aligned with Ballance&#x27;s original vision. Many of the party&#x27;s earlier reforms were strengthened. William Pember Reeves, now the party&#x27;s foremost theorist, promoted a number of other similar reforms including the world&#x27;s first compulsory system of state arbitration. Reeve&#x27;s efforts to introduce further union-friendly regulation created friction with Seddon, who disagreed with Reeves&#x27;s intellectual view of political matters and was nervous about public toleration of the Liberals&#x27; pace of reforms. In 1895, Reeves resigned from his cabinet portfolio and became New Zealand&#x27;s Agent-General (later High Commissioner) in the United Kingdom.

Seddon also introduced a number of new welfare and pension measures, sometimes compared to the welfare reforms of the UK Liberal Party under Prime Minister H. H. Asquith in the United Kingdom. These measures eventually formed the basis on which the Labour Party&#x27;s Michael Joseph Savage built the modern NZ welfare state. Seddon was extremely popular with common New Zealanders, and under his particular brand of populism, the Liberal Party established itself as the dominant party of New Zealand politics.

In 1899, the Liberal and Labour Federation was formed to select candidates approved by the party leadership and ensure that they promoted a consistent and approved set of policies. Candidate selection was ultimately determined by Seddon. The Federation was New Zealand&#x27;s first national party political organisation, and had most of the features of a modern political party, including: subscribing members, a central council and an annual conference.

===Agrarianism===
The Liberal Party aggressively promoted agrarianism during their dominant period from 1891 to 1912. They believed a truly democratic society had to rest on the foundations of an independent land-owning class of small farmers, as opposed to large farms with hired help, or urban factories. The landed gentry and aristocracy ruled the United Kingdom at this point in time. New Zealand never had an aristocracy but it did have wealthy landowners who largely controlled politics prior to 1891. The Liberal Party set out to change that by a policy it called &quot;populism.&quot; Seddon had proclaimed the goal as early as 1884: &quot;It is the rich and the poor; it is the wealthy and the landowners against the middle and labouring classes. That, Sir, shows the real political position of New Zealand.&quot;

The Liberal strategy was to create a large class of small land-owning farmers who supported Liberal ideals. To obtain land for farmers the Liberal government, over a twenty-year period from 1891 to 1911 purchased of Maori land. The government also purchased from large estate holders for subdivision and closer settlement by small farmers. In South Island, the 84,000 acre Cheviot estate was broken up. In eleven years, 176 South Island pastoral estates were broken up; totalling and divided into 3,500 farm. The main method used to persuade pastoralists to sell was taxation of large land holdings. Coupled with this, many of the early pioneer estate owners were dying and the estates were being divided amongst their often large families. Equal partibility was the norm amongst families of Irish and middle-class English backgrounds.

The success of the small farm enterprises went hand-in-hand with the rapid development of dairy farming, underpinned by the invention of refrigerated shipping in 1882. The Advances to Settlers Act of 1894 provided low-interest mortgages, while the Agriculture Department disseminated information on the best farming methods. The Liberals proclaimed success in forging an egalitarian, anti-monopoly land policy. The policy built up support for the Liberal Party in rural North Island electorates. By 1903, the Liberals were so dominant that there was no longer an organised opposition in Parliament.

==Gradual decline==

Slowly, however, the Liberal Party&#x27;s dominance began to erode. The &quot;reforming fires&quot; of the party, the basis of their original success, were dying, and there was little innovation in the field of policy. In 1896, a splinter group formed the Radical Party, to advocate more &quot;advanced&quot; policies than Seddon&#x27;s. In 1905, a similar group formed the New Liberal Party to push for more &quot;progressive&quot; policies, but this group was defunct by the time of the 1908 NZ general election.

In 1906, Seddon died. Joseph Ward, his replacement (after a period of stewardship by William Hall-Jones), did not have the same charismatic flair. Increasingly, the Liberals found themselves losing support on two fronts – farmers, having obtained their goal of land reform, were gradually drifting to the conservative opposition, and workers, having become dissatisfied at the slowed pace of reform, were beginning to talk of an independent labour party.

The Liberals were aware of the problem facing them, and attempted to counter it. As early as 1899, Seddon had founded the &quot;Liberal and Labour Federation&quot;, an attempt to relaunch Ballance&#x27;s old Liberal Federation with more support from workers. Later, Joseph Ward declared a &quot;holiday&quot; from socially progressive legislation, halting any changes that might drive away conservatives. The party also introduced runoff voting (second ballot), hoping to reduce the chances of labour-aligned candidates from splitting the non-conservative vote, but this only applied in the 1908 and 1911 general elections, and the rule was repealed in 1913.

In 1909, the conservative opposition (led by William Massey) established the Reform Party, a united organisation to challenge the Liberals. At the same time, the first noteworthy labour-orientated parties were appearing, saying that the Liberals were no longer able to provide the reforms that workers needed. The Liberal Party found itself torn between its two primary constituencies, unable to satisfy both. This coincided with a gradual decline in the organisational standards of the Liberal Party, with the situation having reached the point where in some cases, multiple &quot;Liberal&quot; candidates were contesting the same electoral race.

At the 1911 general election, the Liberal Party won four fewer seats than the Reform Party, but managed to remain in power with the support of some labour-aligned MPs and independents. In 1912, Sir Joseph Ward stepped down and was replaced by Thomas Mackenzie, who defeated George Laurenson by 22 votes to 9 (John A. Millar did not stand in this leadership ballot on 22 March). In July 1912, coupled with the defection of some Liberal MPs like Millar; this arrangement collapsed, and twenty-one years of Liberal Party government came to an end.

==Opposition==
The Liberals adopted a number of new policies in an attempt to win back votes, including an increase in land tax (supported by the labour movement) and the introduction of proportional representation, with Grey Lynn MP George Fowlds&#x27; Proportional Representation And Effective Voting Bill 1911 (86–1). However, the foundation of the Labour Party in 1916 deprived the Liberals of many votes from working-class areas, while the business world, concerned at Labour&#x27;s rise, was uniting behind Reform&#x27;s &quot;anti-socialism&quot; platform. The Liberal Party was accused by Labour of being a party of the elite, and by Reform of having socialist sympathies – between the two, many predicted that the Liberals would continue to decline. Several leadership changes – back to Ward in mid-1912, to William MacDonald and then Thomas Wilford in 1920, and to George Forbes in 1925 – failed to revive the party&#x27;s fortunes. In June 1926, the Liberals were overtaken as the second-largest party and official opposition by Labour who won the for .

Gradually, the Liberal Party&#x27;s organisation decayed to the point of collapse. In 1927, a faction of the Liberal Party formed a new organisation, which was eventually named the United Party. To the considerable surprise of most observers, including many members of the party itself, United won a considerable victory, and formed a government in 1928. Later, United would reluctantly merge with Reform to counter the Labour Party. The result of this merger, the National Party, remains prominent in New Zealand politics. Both the National and the Labour Parties, the two main powers since 1936, claim to be the Liberal&#x27;s successors.

<text>The surfbird (Calidris virgata) is a small stocky wader in the family Scolopacidae. It was once considered to be allied to the turnstones, and placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Aphriza&quot;, but is now placed in the genus &quot;Calidris&quot;.

This bird has a short dark bill, yellow legs and a black band at the end of the white rump. In breeding plumage, it has dark streaks on the brownish head and breast with dark spots on its white underparts; the upperparts are dark with rust colouring on the wings. Birds in winter plumage and immature birds are mainly grey on the upperparts and breast and white on the underparts with streaking.
Their breeding habitat is rocky tundra areas in Alaska and the Yukon. The female lays 4 eggs in a depression on the ground lined with vegetation. Both parents look after the young birds, who feed themselves.

These birds migrate to the Pacific coasts of North and South America, from southern Alaska to Tierra del Fuego.

On the nesting grounds, these birds mainly eat insects and some seeds. At other times of year, they eat mollusks and crustaceans found along the surf line on rocky coasts and are usually found in small flocks, often with turnstones.

The song is a whistled &quot;tee tee tee&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The surfbird was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other sandpipers in the genus &quot;Tringa&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Tringa virgata&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;streaked sandpiper&quot; that had been described in 1785 by the English ornithologist John Latham from a specimen collected in 1778 from Sandwich Sound (now Prince William Sound, Alaska) on James Cook&#x27;s third voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The species was moved to the monotypic genus &quot;Aphriza&quot; by John James Audubon in 1839. It is now one of 24 species placed in the genus &quot;Calidris&quot; that was introduced in 1804 by the German naturalist Blasius Merrem. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;kalidris&quot; or &quot;skalidris&quot;, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific epithet &quot;virgata&quot; is from Latin &quot;virgatus&quot; meaning &quot;striped&quot; or &quot;streaked&quot;. The species is treated as monotypic: no subspecies are recognised.

The species was long thought to be allied to the turnstones, and placed in the subfamily Arenariinae. With the turnstones it has even been treated as its own family. More recent data suggests it is very close genetically to the red and great knots and should be included in &quot;Calidris&quot;. Indeed, the great knot looks very much like a larger, longer-billed, and somewhat darker surfbird.
==Description==

The surfbird is a large sandpiper, reminiscent of the turnstones or the great knot. It measures and weighs . The sexes look the same, but the females are slightly larger than males on average.

Surfbirds their breeding plumage from March through August, and have white heads, necks breast and belly which are streaked with black, except for the which are rusty. The streaking becomes less prominent lower in the body.

==Distribution and habitat==

The surfbird has the longest and narrowest non-breeding distribution of any North American bird, being found from Kodiak Island in Alaska to the Straits of Magellan at the southern tip of South America. Along that range it is rarely found more than a few meters from the shore. During the breeding season it is found on the mountains of Alaska and the western Yukon, from .

The surfbird starts leaving its breeding grounds from July (the last leaving in October), and begins reaching its main wintering grounds in Chile and Peru in mid August. On its return migration it begins to leave South America in early March. Some birds remain on the wintering grounds year-round. Vagrant birds have been seen in the Falkland Islands, Florida, and Texas. The migration routes are almost entirely coastal, a very small number of birds have been seen inland during migration.

Its breeding habitat is alpine tundra, preferably rocky ridges dominated by scree, rock fields, lichens, dwarf shrubs and &quot;Dryas&quot; (mountain avens), and less commonly in tundra with mosses and sedges. It is generally found away from suitable habitat that is close to forest. In the non breeding season, it is a rocky shore specialist, feeding on rocky shores, reefs, and ledges on the coast. It will feed from the spray zone on the water&#x27;s edge to just above the tide line. In some circumstances, it will feed on sandy beaches and mudflats near rocky areas.

==Behavior==
===Diet and feeding===
The diet of breeding surfbirds is dominated by insects. On one study examining stomach contents, flies (Diptera), including eggs, pupae and adults, composed 55% of the food taken by surfbirds, and beetles Coleoptera 36%. Other insects taken include moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera) and bees and wasps (Hymenoptera). Seeds and snails are also taken, albeit rarely.

===Breeding===

The breeding behavior of the surfbird is poorly known. The surfbird arrives in its breeding habitat in early May; due to high winds in their exposed nesting areas the snow has usually cleared by then. Nesting sites are typically on north or west facing slopes. Nests are exposed, and a re simple depressions lined with lichens and, sometimes, &quot;Dryas&quot;. The species is assumed to be territorial and monogamous. Clutch size is usually four eggs, although smaller clutches have been found.

The eggs are buff-colored with gray or purple markings, and measure . Both sexes incubate the eggs and the incubation period is estimated to be between 22 and 24 days.

<text>Turkey competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Turkish athletes have competed at every Summer Olympic Games since its debut in 1908. Turkey did not attend the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp, the 1932 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles at the period of worldwide Great Depression, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of its support for the United States boycott. The Turkish Olympic Committee (, &quot;TMOK&quot;) sent the nation&#x27;s largest delegation to the Games. A total of 65 athletes, 45 men and 20 women, competed in 10 sports. There was only a single competitor in shooting and taekwondo.

The Turkish team featured two defending Olympic champions from Sydney: Greco-Roman wrestler Hamza Yerlikaya, and weightlifter and world record holder Halil Mutlu, who competed at his fourth Olympic Games as the most sophisticated athlete of the team. Among the Turkish athletes, three of them were born in the former Soviet Union (two of which were previously played for the Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona), namely archer Natalia Nasaridze, long distance runner Ebru Kavaklıoğlu, and Belarusian-born heptathlete Anzhela Atroshchenko. Finn sailor Ali Enver Adakan, who achieved a top ten finish in Sydney four years earlier, was appointed by the committee to carry the Turkish flag in the opening ceremony.

Turkey left Athens with a total of eleven Olympic medals (three golds, four silver, and four bronze), being considered its most successful Olympics with respect to the overall medal count since 1948. Nearly half of these medals were awarded to the athletes in weightlifting, including a third straight defense for Halil Mutlu in the men&#x27;s bantamweight class on his final Olympic bid.

<text>William Thomas Gilcrease (February 8, 1890 – May 6, 1962) was an American oilman, art collector, and philanthropist. During his lifetime, Gilcrease collected more than 10,000 artworks, 250,000 Native American artifacts and 100,000 rare books and documents, including the only surviving certified copy of the Declaration of Independence. He was the founder of Gilcrease Museum in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 1971, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

== Biography ==

===Early life===
Gilcrease was born in Robeline, Natchitoches Parish, Louisiana, on February 8, 1890. He was the son of William Lee Gilcrease and Mary &quot;Elizabeth&quot; [nee Vowell] Gilcrease, a Muscogee Creek. Mary &quot;Elizabeth&quot; was an enrolled member of the Muscogee Nation, and shortly after his birth, the family moved to Indian Territory to take advantage of the allotments in the Creek Nation. The family lived on tribal lands near Eufaula, Oklahoma. After the move, Gilcrease&#x27;s father ran a cotton gin in the nearby community of Mounds, Oklahoma.

Gilcrease&#x27;s early education was limited, and took place in one-room schools in Indian Territory. As a boy, he was often called &quot;Indian Tom&quot;. Gilcrease attended Bacone College, where his most influential teacher was Alexander Posey, who taught his students the arts, sciences, writing, and about their American Indian heritage. The latter included learning of the Trail of Tears and important American Indian leaders, such as Sequoyah and Sitting Bull. Also, instruction on how to make bows and arrows and to hunt, and about the operations of the Creek National Council at Okmulgee. After Bacone College, Gilcrease enrolled in the Kansas State Teacher&#x27;s College (renamed in 1974 to Emporia State University) at Emporia, Kansas.
At the turn of the 20th century, the federal government dissolved the Indian Nations land by distributing parcels into private ownership. At age nine, Gilcrease&#x27;s 1/8 Creek heritage entitled him to receive 160 acres (650,000 m²), located about twenty miles (32 km) southwest of Tulsa, Oklahoma. In 1905, drillers struck oil in the area. His land, sitting astride the huge Glenn Pool Oil Reserve, made Gilcrease a multi-millionaire by the time he was twenty. Though he struggled early in his career, he proved to be an astute businessman. He founded the Gilcrease Oil Company in 1922, and with early successes, was able to purchase more land. Gilcrease established his company headquarters in San Antonio, Texas, in 1937 and also maintained an office in Europe. In 1949, the headquarters of the company moved to Tulsa.

===Family===
On August 22, 1908, Gilcrease married Belle M. Harlow, a member of the Osage Nation. He fathered two sons with Belle: William Thomas Gilcrease, Jr., who was born on July 23, 1909, in Oklahoma and died on March 16, 1967, in Nacogdoches, Nacogdoches County, Texas, and Barton Eugene Gilcrease, who was born on April 12, 1911, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and died on September 25, 1991, in San Antonio, Bexar County, Texas. The couple&#x27;s marriage ended in divorce in 1924. On September 3, 1928, he married 19-year-old Norma Des Cygnet Smallwood, the former Miss Tulsa and Miss America 1926.

Thomas Gilcrease Sr. and Norma (Smallwood) Gilcrease were the parents of one daughter, Des Cygne Lamour Gilcrease. She was born on June 12, 1929, in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Thomas Gilcrease, Sr. filed for divorce in October, 1933, for extreme cruelty and gross neglect of duty. He alleged that the couple had been happily married for two years, until Norma&#x27;s mother, Mahala Dickerson had moved into the house with them and alienated the affections of both Norma and the couple&#x27;s daughter. He wanted the mother-in-law removed from the property. The Gilcrease-Smallwood marriage ended in divorce on May 2, 1934. Initially, the divorce provided for $72,000 alimony, payable at the rate of $200 per month, but with a provision that all payments would cease if Norma were to remarry. Norma balked at the provision against remarriage, so the court set alimony at $15,000, to be paid at $250 per month.
During the 1920s and 1930s Gilcrease became inspired by the collections of European art museums. He began to collect oil paintings and other artifacts of the American West in 1922. The Gilcrease collection expanded over the next 20 years, with the majority obtained after 1939. 
In 1946, Gilcrease was honored by the Sioux Nation, made an honorary tribal member and given the name &quot;Wicarpi Wakatuya&quot;, which means &quot;High Star&quot;.

Declining oil prices in the 1950s created financial difficulties for Gilcrease. Although his oil income was not insubstantial, major collection purchases limited his cash flow and placed him in a position of being unable to meet his current debt. Concerned about the integrity of his collection, Gilcrease offered it for sale as a unit in 1954. Swift action by the people of Tulsa enabled the debt to be covered by a local bond issue, and the collection remained in Oklahoma.

Thomas Gilcrease died of a heart attack on May 6, 1962. After a funeral service based on traditional Indian rites, he was buried in a mausoleum on the grounds of his estate, where his mother was buried after her death on June 11, 1935.

== Art collection ==

The Gilcrease collection of American art, Native American art, artifacts, and documents was acquired over a lifetime. Gilcrease began to collect oil paintings and artifacts of the American West in 1922. At a time when few were interested in Native American or Western painting and sculptor, Gilcrease supported a number of Oklahoma artists, including Woody Crumbo (Potawatomi) and Acee Blue Eagle (Muscogee Creek) and Willard Stone, each of whom created works held in the collection. 
In 1943, Gilcrease moved to San Antonio and opened the Museum of the American Indian, also known as the Gilcrease Museum. However, the San Antonio site failed to attract a large number of visitors. In 1947, he purchased the entire collection of the late Phillip Gillette Cole, an avid New York collector. The collection contained 21 bronzes and 46 paintings by Charles Marion Russell, 17 bronzes and 12 paintings by Frederic Remington, photographs by Edward Curtis, and documents and correspondence of well-known figures in the American West. 
Gilcrease hired architect Alexandre Hogue to design a museum to be placed on Oklahoma property he had purchased in 1914. In 1949, he opened the Thomas Gilcrease Institute of American History and Art on this estate. During the remainder of his life, Gilcrease lived in an adjacent home, built of local sandstone. The rock home, dating from approximately 1912, had been extensively remodeled over the years and was surrounded by a garden specializing in plants used by local tribes.

In 1954, fearing that Gilcrease Museum would be sold and leave Tulsa, a small group of citizens organized a bond election. Tulsa&#x27;s citizens approved, by a 3-to-1 margin, the $2.25 million bond issue which paid Gilcrease&#x27;s outstanding debts. In response, Gilcrease deeded his entire collection to the City of Tulsa in 1955, and conveyed the museum buildings and grounds to the city in 1958. In addition, Gilcrease committed oil property revenue to Tulsa for museum maintenance until the bond was fully repaid.

After the transfer of the collection, Gilcrease continued to fund archaeological excavations and acquire additional materials. These materials were bequeathed to the museum upon his death in Tulsa on May 6, 1962. Gilcrease&#x27;s funeral was conducted in a manner that honored his Native heritage, with Chief Wolf Robe Hunt of the Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico leading the prayer. Arrows then were shot into the air to protect Gilcrease&#x27;s spirit from evil during its travel to Sha-Pa-Po, the world beyond. Cornmeal was sprinkled at the site to provide food for the spirit&#x27;s journey. Gilcrease&#x27;s body was buried in a mausoleum on the grounds of his home and museum.

== The Gilcrease Museum ==
The Gilcrease Museum, also known as the Thomas Gilcrease Institute of American History and Art, holds what is considered among the world&#x27;s largest and most comprehensive collections of fine art, artifacts, and archives dealing with the American West. Located in Tulsa, Oklahoma, the Institute grounds display of thematic gardens showcasing the gardening styles of different time periods in the American West. The grounds also include Thomas Gilcrease&#x27;s home in Tulsa, as well as his mausoleum.

Tulsa voters approved $65 million to renovate and expand the museum as part of the 2016 Vision Tulsa sales tax package; however, the project morphed into an $83.6 million plan to build an entirely new museum after it was determined that rebuilding the existing museum to modern standards would be too expensive. Demolition of the old building and the start of the new is expected to begin in 2022, with completion projected by early 2025. The Thomas Gilcrease house and the mausoleum will remain.
