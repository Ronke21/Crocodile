<text>Mir Babar Ali Anees (, 1800-1874), also known as Mir Anees was an Indian Urdu poet. He used his pen-name (takhallus) of Anees (Urdu: , &quot;Anees&quot; means &quot;close friend, companion&quot;) in poetry. Anees used Persian, Urdu, Arabic, and Sanskrit words in his poetry. Anis wrote prolonged Marsias, which was a custom of his times, but nowadays only selected sections are narrated even in religious ceremonies. He died in 1291 Hijra, corresponding with 1874 CE.

==Family==
Mir Babar Ali Anis was born in 1803 CE at Faizabad. In his book &quot;Khandaan- e-Mir Anees ke Naamwar Sho’ara&quot; (Famous Poets from the family of Mir Anis), Zameer Naqvi lists 22 poets from Mir Anis’ family and their poetry. A researcher in Urdu Literature, Syed Taqi Abedi, has shown that Mir Anis&#x27;s family has written poetic literature for three centuries, first in Persian and later in Urdu. Mir Anis was a fifth-generation poet, a fact he mentioned in the first stanza of &quot;Namak-e-Khwaan-e-Takallum hai Fasaahat meri&quot;:
==Education==
Anis&#x27;s mother appears to have been his greatest inspiration. He gained a traditional Shia education. However, research by Nayyar Masood reveals that, while in Faizabad, Anis studied with two religious scholars; one was a Shia Scholar, Mir Najaf and the other was a Hanafi (Sunni) Scholar, Haider Ali Faizabadi. Masood also notes that Anis was well versed in Persian as well as in Arabic. Anis also had military training and gained a thorough knowledge of old and new weapons.

==Life==
Anis was invited to Lucknow where he reached the zenith of his reputation. He stayed in Lucknow because he believed that his art was not appreciated elsewhere. Yet, after the annexation of Oudh by the British, he was persuaded to visit Azimabad (Patna), Dulhipur (Varanasi), Hyderabad and Allahabad.

In 1870 Nawab Tahwar Jung invited Anis to Hyderabad where he declined to be presented at the court of Mir Mahboob Ali Khan, the then Nizam of Hyderabad State. The Nizam himself went to the Majlis where the poet was to recite. While returning from Hyderabad, he sojourned at Allahabad in 1871 and recited his marsia in the Imambara of late Lala Beni Prasad Srivastava, Vakil, who was a devotee of Imam Husain.

He died in 1874 CE and is buried at his own residence in Lucknow.

==Work and contribution==
According to Muhammad Hussain Azad, &quot;The late Mīr Sahib must certainly have composed at least ten thousand elegies, and salāms beyond count. He composed as easily and casually as he spoke.&quot;.

In his essay &quot;How to read Iqbal?&quot; Shamsur Rahman Faruqi wrote: &quot;Iqbal was placed better because he had, among others, Bedil (1644–1720) in Persian and Mir Anis (1802–1874) in Urdu.&quot; He further asserts: &quot;The mention of Mir Anis may surprise some of us until we realize it that Mir Anis’s Marsiyas are the best premodern model in Urdu of narrative-historical, narrative-lyrical, and oral-dramatic poetry, and Iqbal’s poetry extends and exploits the possibilities created by Anis.&quot;

Mir Anis was criticized for playing on religious sentiments giving his work a vertical appeal at the expense of poetic beauty. While Farhat Nadir Rizvi, in her research, has propounded that Anis was narrating recorded history and was therefore restricted in use of pure imagination and fantasy, yet he dexterously harnessed the art of storytelling in his work and we cannot but accept that he was not only a Marsiya writer but also a successful storyteller. Anis has been compared with Shakespeare. Shakespeare creates imaginary plots and characters so beautifully that they appear real to the reader; Anis narrates events and characters fossilized in history so vividly that they become alive in the eyes of his audience.

Anis is also known as a pioneer in Rubai, an Urdu poetry branch, and enjoys status akin to that of Mirza Sauda, Khwaja Mir Dard and Dabeer. 
Besides being a master of the Marsia, Anis was also a specialist of the Rubai, the shortest complete poem in Urdu, containing only four lines. He enriched the contents of the Rubai, making it much more colorful and multi-dimensional. Anis introduced the tragic events of Karbala and their moralistic effect to Rubai. Thus, he widened the scope of Rubai to unfathomable limits. The inclusion of Karbala resulted in the florescence of the Urdu Rubai. Thus, many internal and external aspects of our life found their echo in the Urdu Rubai.

<text>Voortman Cookies Limited is a Canadian company specializing in the production and sale of cookies. Based in Burlington, Ontario, Voortman brand cookies are sold at retail locations across Canada, the United States, Puerto Rico, and over 70 other countries worldwide.

Orrville, Ohio-based Smucker acquired Voortman in 2023 as part of its US$5.6-billion takeover of Hostess Brands. Hostess had purchased Voortman in 2019 from private equity company Swander Place Capital for US$320-million in cash, meaning the cookie maker has lost some value over the past five years.Oct 22, 2024

Smucker sells Canadian cookie maker Voortman for US$305-million

== History == 

Voortman Cookies Limited was founded in 1951 by Dutch immigrant brothers William and Harry Voortman. In the 2010s, Voortman Cookies makes over 60 varieties of cookies, including lines of creme wafers, sugar free and seasonal products. The Burlington plant remains the sole production facility, where over 200 full-time workers are employed. Voortman&#x27;s cookies are distributed throughout North America by a network of over 500 independent distributors. In 2015, Voortman&#x27;s sales were over $100 million.

In 2015, a majority stake in Voortman Cookies was acquired by private equity firm Swander Pace Capital. At that time, Chief Executive Officer Harry Voortman stepped away from daily management but remains on the board of directors.

In 2017, Voortman went through a complete rebranding, which included removal from its formulae all artificial colours, artificial flavours, and high-fructose corn syrup.

On December 2, 2019, Hostess Brands announced that it was purchasing Voortman from Swander Pace Capital for approximately US$320 million; this transaction was completed a month later. Subsequently, The J.M. Smucker Company acquired Hostess Brands.

In October 2024, The J.M. Smucker Co. agreed to sell Voortman to Second Nature Brands in a $305 million all-cash deal. In December, it was announced that the purchase had been completed.

== Trans fat ban ==
In 2003, Voortman Cookies announced that no trans fats would be used in the production of its cookies. This made Voortman Cookies the first Canadian food company and one of the first in North America to abolish the use of trans-fats in retail food products.

<doc id="936080" wikidata="Q3536701" url="?curid=936080" title="Uttama (Chola dynasty)">
<text>Uttama, also known as Madhurantaka, Uthaya Kumar, was a Chola Emperor who ruled from 971 CE to 985 CE in present-day Tamil Nadu, India. According to Tiruvalangadu plates of Rajendra Chola, Madhurantaka Uttama&#x27;s reign is placed after Aditya II. The latter may have been a co-regent of Parantaka II and seems to have died before he could formally ascend the throne. Uttama was the cousin of Parantaka II and was the son of the illustrious Sembiyan Mahadevi and Gandaraditya.

== Controversial ascension ==

The circumstances under which Uttama ascended the Chola throne is surrounded by controversy and mystery. At the time of Gandaraditya&#x27;s death, Uttama must have been a very young child. Due to his young age, his rights to the Chola throne were probably set aside and Gandaraditya&#x27;s younger brother Arinjaya was crowned king.

Arinjaya ruled for a very short time – possibly for less than a year and on his death, his son Parantaka II (Sundara Chola) succeeded him. By the time Uttama was old enough to claim the crown, Sundara Chola had two sons – Aditha Karikalan (the one who took the head of the Vira Pandya) and Arulmozhi Varman.

During the reign of Parantaka Chola II, his son Aditha Karikalan was appointed co-regent and heir apparent to the Chola throne, despite Uttama having a stronger claim. Aditha Karikalan was assassinated under mysterious circumstances.

The Tiruvalangadu plates of Rajendra Chola I reveal that following Aditha Karikalan’s death, questions arose regarding succession. Although the people favoured Arulmozhi Varman, he chose to step aside in favour of his paternal uncle, Uttama.

== Role in Aditya II’s Assassination ==

An inscription from the reign of Rajaraja I reveals that the properties of certain individuals were confiscated after they were convicted of treason. The inscription also indicates that these individuals were involved in the conspiracy to assassinate Aditya II. Dated to the second regnal year of Rajaraja Chola, the Udaiyargudi inscription records that the government seized the lands of several people and their relatives, including Soman, Ravidasan (alias Panchavan Brahmadhirajan), Parameswaran (alias Irumudichola Brahmadhirajan), and Malaiyanur Revadasa Kramavittan, along with the property of Kramavittan’s son and mother. This action was taken in response to their role in the murder of &quot;Karikala chola who took the head of the Pandya&quot;. Notably, Ravidasan and Parameswaran held government positions.

Despite Aditya II’s assassination in 971 CE, no action appears to have been taken by Uttama Chola during his reign to bring the perpetrators to justice. In his authoritative work &quot;The Cholas&quot;, historian K.A.N. Sastry submitted that circumstantial evidence—based on an inscription at the Udayarkudi temple—implicates Uttama in the conspiracy.

However, subsequent research has challenged Sastry’s interpretation, suggesting he may have misread the inscriptions. It seems reasonable to conclude that if any credible evidence had existed against Uttama, Rajaraja’s son, Rajendra Chola, would not have adopted the coronation title of Madhurantaka II.

All indications point to Uttama being a devout and upright ruler. An ardent devotee of Shiva, inscriptions from Konnerirajapuram (also known as Thirunallam) and Kanchipuram reflect his piety. Under the guidance of his mother, Uttama played a significant role in codifying temple patterns, epigraphy, art, sculpture, and administrative record-keeping.

== Chola army and campaigns ==
Not much is known about the military conquests of Uttama, but by his time most of Thondaimandalam had been recovered from the Rashtrakuta. His dominions included Kanchi and Tiruvannamalai to the north. Many of his inscriptions are found in around Chengalpattu and North Arcot districts. The Chola army seems to have been in continued battles with the Pandyas and their ally the Sinhalas in Eelam or Sri Lanka. Several Chola coins of Uttama have been found in the Pandya country and in Eelam as proof of Uttama&#x27;s activities there. We have a copper-plate inscription of him, now at the Government Museum Chennai. It bears the symbol of a seated tiger with two fish beside it and bears the line &quot;This is the matchless edict of the King who taught justice to all the Kings in his realm&quot;. But the genealogical section of the plates was lost. However, we do have the appendix portion at the end.

There are indications he upgraded the army, not just in troop levels but also in quality and organization. It is known through inscriptions that, at least from Uttama&#x27;s time, warriors were provided with waistcoats of armour.

An important general during his reign was Paluvettaraiyar Maravan Kandanar, who also served under Sundara Chola. His son Kumaran Maravan also served Uttama.

== Personal life ==

Uttama was the son of Gandaraditya Chola and Sembiyan Mahadevi, who was the daughter of a Malavarayar chieftain. Uttama had several queens, some of whose names are known. His chief queen was Orattanan (Urattayana) Sorabbaiyar Tribhuvana-Mahadeviyar. Other queens included Kaduvettigal Nandippottairaiyar, likely a Pallava princess, and Siddhavadavan Suttiyar, who was related to Vikramasola-Miladudaiyar, a prominent feudal king ruling over Miladu (part of present-day South Arcot District).

Uttama was named Gandan Madhurantakan, also known as Uttama, by his father after his paternal uncles. Unlike some other Chola kings, Uttama took after his mother and was known for his piety. His devout nature and support allowed Sembiyan Mahadevi to continue her temple restoration work. Uttama is remembered for his compassion, even towards his enemies.

As with most ancient Indian kings, Uttama was religiously tolerant. Although a Saivite (worshipper of Siva), he also donated to temples dedicated to Vishnu, especially to the Ullagaladar temple. He also granted large degrees of autonomy to his districts. He brought in the best talent from other kingdoms. Kachipeedu (modern Kanchipuram) is also mentioned as one of his prominent cities. He is known to have contributed money, cattle, sheep to temples in modern Kumbakonam, Thirunallam (modern Konnerirajapuram), Thiruvallarai, Thirupatturai, Thirunedugalam, Thiruvisalur, Thirunaraiyur, Thiruvalangadu, Thirukkodika, etc.

Uttama&#x27;s mother pioneered the process of kalpani—converting brick, mortar, and wooden structures into granite, and there is inscriptional evidence to show that he actively funded his mother in this work. She made a conscious effort to copy the older inscriptions before she re-built the temple, for example in a temple in Aavatuturai which was sung by the &quot;Moovar&quot;, that is the Saivite saints, Appar, Sundarar and Sambandhar there is an older inscription from the time before the temple was rebuilt. At other places like the Choleeswara temple at Kurralam which was sung by Appar and Sundarar, there is an inscription that says it was built by Sembiyan Mahadevi She survived this king and lived on for another 16 years into the reign of Rajaraja I.

Two sculptures of Uttama (Madhuranthaka Devar) and his mother can be found in the Southern wall of the inner &quot;Prakara&quot; of the Konnerirajapuram (aka Thirunallam) temple near Kumbakonam. The inscription under the sculpture identifying Sembiyan Mahadevi identifies her, and the Archaeological Survey of India interprets the bearded man behind her as Gandaraditya Chola.

== Death and succession ==
Uttama died . Although he had at least one son (Madhurantaka Gandaraditya), the line of succession passed back to Parantaka II&#x27;s family. Rajaraja Chola I succeeded as the Chola Emperor. Madhurantaka served as an official in Rajaraja&#x27;s court.

== Inscriptions ==

The following is an inscription of Uttama from the Umamaheswaraswami temple in Konerirajapuram,

Yet another inscription of him from the Masilamanisvara temple in Tirumullaivayil,

<doc id="936085" wikidata="Q725361" url="?curid=936085" title="Green chemistry">
<text>Green chemistry, similar to sustainable chemistry or circular chemistry, is an area of chemistry and chemical engineering focused on the design of products and processes that minimize or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances. While environmental chemistry focuses on the effects of polluting chemicals on nature, green chemistry focuses on the environmental impact of chemistry, including lowering consumption of nonrenewable resources and technological approaches for preventing pollution.

The overarching goals of green chemistry—namely, more resource-efficient and inherently safer design of molecules, materials, products, and processes—can be pursued in a wide range of contexts.

==History==
Green chemistry emerged from a variety of existing ideas and research efforts (such as atom economy and catalysis) in the period leading up to the 1990s, in the context of increasing attention to problems of chemical pollution and resource depletion. The development of green chemistry in Europe and the United States was linked to a shift in environmental problem-solving strategies: a movement from command and control regulation and mandated lowering of industrial emissions at the &quot;end of the pipe,&quot; toward the active prevention of pollution through the innovative design of production technologies themselves. The set of concepts now recognized as green chemistry coalesced in the mid- to late-1990s, along with broader adoption of the term (which prevailed over competing terms such as &quot;clean&quot; and &quot;sustainable&quot; chemistry).

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency played a significant early role in fostering green chemistry through its pollution prevention programs, funding, and professional coordination. At the same time in the United Kingdom, researchers at the University of York, who used the term &quot;clean technology&quot; in the early 1990s, contributed to the establishment of the Green Chemistry Network within the Royal Society of Chemistry, and the launch of the journal &quot;Green Chemistry&quot;. In 1991, in the Netherlands, a special issue called &#x27;green chemistry&#x27; [groene chemie] was published in &quot;Chemisch Magazine&quot;. In the Dutch context, green chemistry was associated with the exploitation of biomass as a renewable feedstock.

==Principles==
In 1998, Paul Anastas (who then directed the Green Chemistry Program at the US EPA) and John C. Warner (then of Polaroid Corporation) published a set of principles to guide the practice of green chemistry. The twelve principles address a range of ways to lower the environmental and health impacts of chemical production, and also indicate research priorities for the development of green chemistry technologies.

The principles cover such concepts as:

* the design of processes to maximize the amount of raw material that ends up in the product;
* the use of renewable material feedstocks and energy sources;
* the use of safe, environmentally benign substances, including solvents, whenever possible;
* the design of energy efficient processes;
* avoiding the production of waste, which is viewed as the ideal form of waste management.

The twelve principles of green chemistry are:

# Prevention: Preventing waste is better than treating or cleaning up waste after it is created.
# Atom economy: Synthetic methods should try to maximize the incorporation of all materials used in the process into the final product. This means that less waste will be generated as a result.
# Less hazardous chemical syntheses: Synthetic methods should avoid using or generating substances toxic to humans and/or the environment.
# Designing safer chemicals: Chemical products should be designed to achieve their desired function while being as non-toxic as possible.
# Safer solvents and auxiliaries: Auxiliary substances should be avoided wherever possible, and as non-hazardous as possible when they must be used.
# Design for energy efficiency: Energy requirements should be minimized, and processes should be conducted at ambient temperature and pressure whenever possible.
# Use of renewable feedstocks: Whenever it is practical to do so, renewable feedstocks or raw materials are preferable to non-renewable ones.
# Reduce derivatives: Unnecessary generation of derivatives—such as the use of protecting groups—should be minimized or avoided if possible; such steps require additional reagents and may generate additional waste.
# Catalysis: Catalytic reagents that can be used in small quantities to repeat a reaction are superior to stoichiometric reagents (ones that are consumed in a reaction).
# Design for degradation: Chemical products should be designed so that they do not pollute the environment; when their function is complete, they should break down into non-harmful products.
# Real-time analysis for pollution prevention: Analytical methodologies need to be further developed to permit real-time, in-process monitoring and control &quot;before&quot; hazardous substances form.
# Inherently safer chemistry for accident prevention: Whenever possible, the substances in a process, and the forms of those substances, should be chosen to minimize risks such as explosions, fires, and accidental releases.

== Trends ==
Attempts are being made not only to quantify the &quot;greenness&quot; of a chemical process but also to factor in other variables such as chemical yield, the price of reaction components, safety in handling chemicals, hardware demands, energy profile and ease of product workup and purification. In one quantitative study, the reduction of nitrobenzene to aniline receives 64 points out of 100 marking it as an acceptable synthesis overall whereas a synthesis of an amide using HMDS is only described as adequate with a combined 32 points.

Green chemistry is increasingly seen as a powerful tool that researchers must use to evaluate the environmental impact of nanotechnology. As nano materials are developed, the environmental and human health impacts of both the products themselves and the processes to make them must be considered to ensure their long-term economic viability. There is a trend of nano material technology in the practice, however, people ignored the potential nanotoxicity. Therefore, people need to address further consideration on legal, ethical, safety, and regulatory issues associated with nanomaterials, 

==Examples==

===Green solvents===

The major application of solvents in human activities is in paints and coatings (46% of usage). Smaller volume applications include cleaning, de-greasing, adhesives, and in chemical synthesis. Traditional solvents are often toxic or are chlorinated. Green solvents, on the other hand, are generally less harmful to health and the environment and preferably more sustainable. Ideally, solvents would be derived from renewable resources and biodegrade to innocuous, often a naturally occurring product. However, the manufacture of solvents from biomass can be more harmful to the environment than making the same solvents from fossil fuels. Thus the environmental impact of solvent manufacture must be considered when a solvent is being selected for a product or process. Another factor to consider is the fate of the solvent after use. If the solvent is being used in an enclosed situation where solvent collection and recycling is feasible, then the energy cost and environmental harm associated with recycling should be considered; in such a situation water, which is energy-intensive to purify, may not be the greenest choice. On the other hand, a solvent contained in a consumer product is likely to be released into the environment upon use, and therefore the environmental impact of the solvent itself is more important than the energy cost and impact of solvent recycling; in such a case water is very likely to be a green choice. In short, the impact of the entire lifetime of the solvent, from cradle to grave (or cradle to cradle if recycled) must be considered. Thus the most comprehensive definition of a green solvent is the following: &quot;a green solvent is the solvent that makes a product or process have the least environmental impact over its entire life cycle.&quot;

By definition, then, a solvent might be green for one application (because it results in less environmental harm than any other solvent that could be used for that application) and yet not be a green solvent for a different application. A classic example is water, which is a very green solvent for consumer products such as toilet bowl cleaner but is not a green solvent for the manufacture of polytetrafluoroethylene. For the production of that polymer, the use of water as solvent requires the addition of perfluorinated surfactants which are highly persistent. Instead, supercritical carbon dioxide seems to be the greenest solvent for that application because it performs well without any surfactant. In summary, no solvent can be declared to be a &quot;green solvent&quot; unless the declaration is limited to a specific application.

===Synthetic techniques===
Novel or enhanced synthetic techniques can often provide improved environmental performance or enable better adherence to the principles of green chemistry. For example, the 2005 Nobel Prize for Chemistry was awarded to Yves Chauvin, Robert H. Grubbs and Richard R. Schrock, for the development of the metathesis method in organic synthesis, with explicit reference to its contribution to green chemistry and &quot;smarter production.&quot; A 2005 review identified three key developments in green chemistry in the field of organic synthesis: use of supercritical carbon dioxide as green solvent, aqueous hydrogen peroxide for clean oxidations and the use of hydrogen in asymmetric synthesis. Some further examples of applied green chemistry are supercritical water oxidation, on water reactions, and dry media reactions.

Bioengineering is also seen as a promising technique for achieving green chemistry goals. A number of important process chemicals can be synthesized in engineered organisms, such as shikimate, a Tamiflu precursor which is fermented by Roche in bacteria. Click chemistry is often cited as a style of chemical synthesis that is consistent with the goals of green chemistry. The concept of &#x27;green pharmacy&#x27; has recently been articulated based on similar principles.

===Carbon dioxide as blowing agent===
In 1996, Dow Chemical won the 1996 Greener Reaction Conditions award for their 100% carbon dioxide blowing agent for polystyrene foam production. Polystyrene foam is a common material used in packing and food transportation. Seven hundred million pounds are produced each year in the United States alone. Traditionally, CFC and other ozone-depleting chemicals were used in the production process of the foam sheets, presenting a serious environmental hazard. Flammable, explosive, and, in some cases toxic hydrocarbons have also been used as CFC replacements, but they present their own problems. Dow Chemical discovered that supercritical carbon dioxide works equally as well as a blowing agent, without the need for hazardous substances, allowing the polystyrene to be more easily recycled. The CO2 used in the process is reused from other industries, so the net carbon released from the process is zero.

===Hydrazine===
Addressing principle #2 is the peroxide process for producing hydrazine without cogenerating salt. Hydrazine is traditionally produced by the Olin Raschig process from sodium hypochlorite (the active ingredient in many bleaches) and ammonia. The net reaction produces one equivalent of sodium chloride for every equivalent of the targeted product hydrazine:
:NaOCl + 2 NH3 → H2N-NH2 + NaCl + H2O

In the greener peroxide process hydrogen peroxide is employed as the oxidant and the side product is water. The net conversion follows:
:2 NH3 + H2O2 → H2N-NH2 + 2 H2O 
Addressing principle #4, this process does not require auxiliary extracting solvents. Methyl ethyl ketone is used as a carrier for the hydrazine, the intermediate ketazine phase separates from the reaction mixture, facilitating workup without the need of an extracting solvent.

===1,3-Propanediol===
Addressing principle #7 is a green route to 1,3-propanediol, which is traditionally generated from petrochemical precursors. It can be produced from renewable precursors via the bioseparation of 1,3-propanediol using a genetically modified strain of &quot;E. coli&quot;. This diol is used to make new polyesters for the manufacture of carpets.

===Lactide===

In 2002, Cargill Dow (now NatureWorks) won the Greener Reaction Conditions Award for their improved method for polymerization of polylactic acid . Unfortunately, lactide-base polymers do not perform well and the project was discontinued by Dow soon after the award. Lactic acid is produced by fermenting corn and converted to lactide, the cyclic dimer ester of lactic acid using an efficient, tin-catalyzed cyclization. The L,L-lactide enantiomer is isolated by distillation and polymerized in the melt to make a crystallizable polymer, which has some applications including textiles and apparel, cutlery, and food packaging. Wal-Mart has announced that it is using/will use PLA for its produce packaging. The NatureWorks PLA process substitutes renewable materials for petroleum feedstocks, doesn&#x27;t require the use of hazardous organic solvents typical in other PLA processes, and results in a high-quality polymer that is recyclable and compostable.

===Carpet tile backings===
In 2003 Shaw Industries selected a combination of polyolefin resins as the base polymer of choice for EcoWorx due to the low toxicity of its feedstocks, superior adhesion properties, dimensional stability, and its ability to be recycled. The EcoWorx compound also had to be designed to be compatible with nylon carpet fiber. Although EcoWorx may be recovered from any fiber type, nylon-6 provides a significant advantage. Polyolefins are compatible with known nylon-6 depolymerization methods. PVC interferes with those processes. Nylon-6 chemistry is well-known and not addressed in first-generation production. From its inception, EcoWorx met all of the design criteria necessary to satisfy the needs of the marketplace from a performance, health, and environmental standpoint. Research indicated that separation of the fiber and backing through elutriation, grinding, and air separation proved to be the best way to recover the face and backing components, but an infrastructure for returning postconsumer EcoWorx to the elutriation process was necessary. Research also indicated that the postconsumer carpet tile had a positive economic value at the end of its useful life. EcoWorx is recognized by MBDC as a certified cradle-to-cradle design.

===Transesterification of fats===

In 2005, Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and Novozymes won the Greener Synthetic Pathways Award for their enzyme interesterification process. In response to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) mandated labeling of &quot;trans&quot;-fats on nutritional information by January 1, 2006, Novozymes and ADM worked together to develop a clean, enzymatic process for the interesterification of oils and fats by interchanging saturated and unsaturated fatty acids. The result is commercially viable products without &quot;trans&quot;-fats. In addition to the human health benefits of eliminating &quot;trans&quot;-fats, the process has reduced the use of toxic chemicals and water, prevents vast amounts of byproducts, and reduces the amount of fats and oils wasted.

===Bio-succinic acid===
In 2011, the Outstanding Green Chemistry Accomplishments by a Small Business Award went to BioAmber Inc. for integrated production and downstream applications of bio-based succinic acid. Succinic acid is a platform chemical that is an important starting material in the formulations of everyday products. Traditionally, succinic acid is produced from petroleum-based feedstocks. BioAmber has developed process and technology that produces succinic acid from the fermentation of renewable feedstocks at a lower cost and lower energy expenditure than the petroleum equivalent while sequestering CO rather than emitting it. However, lower prices of oil precipitated the company into bankruptcy and bio-sourced succinic acid is now barely made.

===Laboratory chemicals===
Several laboratory chemicals are controversial from the perspective of Green chemistry. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology created a &quot;Green&quot; Alternatives Wizard to help identify alternatives. Ethidium bromide, xylene, mercury, and formaldehyde have been identified as &quot;worst offenders&quot; which have alternatives. Solvents in particular make a large contribution to the environmental impact of chemical manufacturing and there is a growing focus on introducing Greener solvents into the earliest stage of development of these processes: laboratory-scale reaction and purification methods. In the Pharmaceutical Industry, both GSK and Pfizer have published Solvent Selection Guides for their Drug Discovery chemists.

== Legislation ==

===The EU===
In 2007, The EU put into place the Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) program, which requires companies to provide data showing that their products are safe. This regulation (1907/2006) ensures not only the assessment of the chemicals&#x27; hazards as well as risks during their uses but also includes measures for banning or restricting/authorising uses of specific substances. ECHA, the EU Chemicals Agency in Helsinki, is implementing the regulation whereas the enforcement lies with the EU member states.

===United States===
The United States formed the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1970 to protect human and environmental health by creating and enforcing environmental regulation. Green chemistry builds on the EPA’s goals by encouraging chemists and engineers to design chemicals, processes, and products that avoid the creation of toxins and waste.

The U.S. law that governs the majority of industrial chemicals (excluding pesticides, foods, and pharmaceuticals) is the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) of 1976. Examining the role of regulatory programs in shaping the development of green chemistry in the United States, analysts have revealed structural flaws and long-standing weaknesses in TSCA; for example, a 2006 report to the California Legislature concludes that TSCA has produced a domestic chemicals market that discounts the hazardous properties of chemicals relative to their function, price, and performance. Scholars have argued that such market conditions represent a key barrier to the scientific, technical, and commercial success of green chemistry in the U.S., and fundamental policy changes are needed to correct these weaknesses.

Passed in 1990, the Pollution Prevention Act helped foster new approaches for dealing with pollution by preventing environmental problems before they happen.

Green chemistry grew in popularity in the United States after the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 was passed. This Act declared that pollution should be lowered by improving designs and products rather than treatment and disposal. These regulations encouraged chemists to reimagine pollution and research ways to limit the toxins in the atmosphere. In 1991, the EPA Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxics created a research grant program encouraging the research and recreation of chemical products and processes to limit the impact on the environment and human health. The EPA hosts The Green Chemistry Challenge each year to incentivize the economic and environmental benefits of developing and utilizing green chemistry.

In 2008, the State of California approved two laws aiming to encourage green chemistry, launching the California Green Chemistry Initiative. One of these statutes required California&#x27;s Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC) to develop new regulations to prioritize &quot;chemicals of concern&quot; and promote the substitution of hazardous chemicals with safer alternatives. The resulting regulations took effect in 2013, initiating DTSC&#x27;s &quot;Safer Consumer Products Program&quot;.

==Contested definition==
There are ambiguities in the definition of green chemistry and how it is understood among broader science, policy, and business communities. Even within chemistry, researchers have used the term &quot;green chemistry&quot; to describe a range of work independently of the framework put forward by Anastas and Warner (i.e., the 12 principles). While not all uses of the term are legitimate (see greenwashing), many are, and the authoritative status of any single definition is uncertain. More broadly, the idea of green chemistry can easily be linked (or confused) with related concepts like green engineering, environmental design, or sustainability in general. Green chemistry&#x27;s complexity and multifaceted nature makes it difficult to devise clear and simple metrics. As a result, &quot;what is green&quot; is often open to debate.

==Awards==
Several scientific societies have created awards to encourage research in green chemistry.
* Australia&#x27;s Green Chemistry Challenge Awards overseen by The Royal Australian Chemical Institute (RACI).
* The Canadian Green Chemistry Medal.
* In Italy, Green Chemistry activities center around an inter-university consortium known as INCA.
* In Japan, The Green &amp; Sustainable Chemistry Network oversees the GSC awards program.
* In the United Kingdom, the Green Chemical Technology Awards are given by Crystal Faraday.
* In the US, the Presidential Green Chemistry Challenge Awards recognize individuals and businesses.

<text>Armand-Pierre Caussin de Perceval (1795–1871) was a French orientalist.

He was born in Paris on 13 January 1795. His father, Jean-Jacques-Antoine Caussin de Perceval (1759–1835), was professor of Arabic in the Collège de France.

In 1814 he went to Constantinople as a student interpreter, and afterwards travelled in Asiatic Turkey, spending a year with the Maronites in the Lebanon, and finally becoming dragoman at Aleppo. Returning to Paris, he became professor of modern Arabic in the School of Living Oriental Languages in 1821, and also professor of Arabic in the Collège de France in 1833. In 1849 he was elected to the Academy of Inscriptions. He died on 15 January 1871 at the Siege of Paris.

Caussin de Perceval published (1828) a useful &quot;Grammaire arabe vulgaire&quot;, which passed through several editions (4th ed., 1858), and edited and enlarged Ellious Bocthor&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire français-arabe&quot; (2 vols., 1828; 3rd ed., 1864); but his great reputation rests almost entirely on one book, the &quot;Essai sur l&#x27;histoire des Arabes avant l&#x27;Islamisme, pendant l&#x27;époque de Mahomet&quot; (3 vols., 1847–1849), in which the native traditions as to the early history of the Arabs, down to the death of Muhammad and the complete subjection of all the tribes to Islam, are brought together with wonderful industry and set forth with much learning and lucidity. One of the principal manuscript sources used is the great &quot;Kitab al-Aghani&quot; of Abu al-Faraj, which has since been published (20 vols., Boulak, 1868) in Egypt; but no publication of texts can deprive the &quot;Essai&quot; of its value as a trustworthy guide through a tangled mass of tradition.

<doc id="936098" wikidata="Q544443" url="?curid=936098" title="Celtic calendar">
<text>The Celtic calendar is a compilation of pre-Christian Celtic systems of timekeeping, including the Gaulish Coligny calendar, used by Celtic countries to define the beginning and length of the day, the week, the month, the seasons, quarter days, and festivals.

==Continental Celtic calendar==
The Gaulish Coligny calendar is the oldest known Celtic solar-lunar ritual calendar. It was discovered in Coligny, France, and is now on display in the Palais des Arts Gallo-Roman museum, Lyon. It dates from the end of the second century AD, when the Roman Empire imposed the use of the Julian Calendar in Roman Gaul. The calendar was originally a single huge plate, but it survives only in fragments. It is inscribed in Gaulish with Latin characters and uses Roman numerals.

The Coligny Calendar reconciles the cycles of the moon and sun. The Coligny calendar considers the phases of the moon to be important, and each month always begins with the same moon phase. The calendar uses a mathematical arrangement to keep a normal 12 month calendar in sync with the moon and keeps the whole system in sync by adding an intercalary month every  years. The Coligny calendar registers a five-year cycle of 62 lunar months, divided into a &quot;bright&quot; and a &quot;dark&quot; fortnight (or half a moon cycle) each. The internal notations show that the months began with the first quarter moon, and a 13th intercalary month was added every two and a half years to align the lunations with the solar year.

The astronomical format of the calendar year that the Coligny calendar represents may well be far older, as calendars are usually even more conservative than rites and cults. The date of its inception is unknown, but correspondences of Insular Celtic and Continental Celtic calendars suggest that some early form may date to the earlier Iron Age. The Coligny calendar achieves a complex synchronisation of the solar and lunar months. Whether it does this for philosophical or practical reasons, it points to a considerable degree of sophistication.

==Medieval Irish and Welsh calendars==
Among the Insular Celts, the year was divided into a light half and a dark half. As the day was seen as beginning at sunset, so the year was seen as beginning with the arrival of the darkness, at Calan Gaeaf / Samhain (around 1 November in the modern calendar). The light half of the year started at Calan Haf/Bealtaine (around 1 May, modern calendar). This observance of festivals beginning the evening before the festival day is still seen in the celebrations and folkloric practices among the Gaels, such as the traditions of &quot;Oíche Shamhna&quot; (Samhain Eve) among the Irish and &quot;Oidhche Shamhna&quot; among the Scots.

Julius Caesar said in his &quot;Gallic Wars&quot;: &quot;[the Gaulish Celts] keep birthdays and the beginnings of months and years in such an order that the day follows the night.&quot; Longer periods were reckoned in nights, as in the surviving English term fortnight meaning two weeks, and the obsolete &quot;se&#x27;nnight&quot; meaning one week.

The Laws of Hywel Dda (in editions surviving from the 12th and 13th centuries) make repeated references to periods of &quot;nine days&quot; (&quot;nawfed dydd&quot;), rather than the &quot;eight nights&quot; that make up the current word &quot;wythnos&quot;.

==Native calendar terms in Celtic languages==
Many calendrical and time-keeping terms used in the medieval and modern Celtic languages were borrowed from Latin and reflect the influence of Roman culture and Christianity on the Insular Celts. The words borrowed include the month names &quot;Januarius&quot; (Old Irish &#x27;, Irish &quot;Eanáir&quot;, Welsh &#x27;), &quot;Februarius&quot; (Old Irish &#x27;, Irish &quot;Feabhra&quot;, Welsh &#x27;), &quot;Martius&quot; (Old Irish &#x27;, Welsh &#x27;), &quot;Aprilius&quot; (Old Irish &#x27;, Irish &quot;Aibreán&quot;, Welsh &#x27;), &quot;Maius&quot; (Welsh &#x27;), &quot;Augustus&quot; (Old Irish &#x27;, Welsh &#x27;); the names for the days of the week, &quot;Solis&quot;, &quot;Lunae&quot;, &quot;Martis&quot;, &quot;Mercurii&quot;, &quot;Jovis&quot;, &quot;Veneris&quot;, &quot;Saturni&quot;; the terms &quot;septimana&quot; &quot;week&quot; (Old Irish &#x27;, Breton &#x27;, Cornish &#x27;), &quot;kalendae&quot; &quot;first day of the month&quot; (Old Irish &#x27;, Welsh &#x27;, Breton &#x27;), &quot;tempore&quot; &quot;time&quot; (Welsh &#x27;), &quot;matutina&quot; &quot;morning&quot; (Cornish &#x27;, Irish &quot;maidin&quot;), &quot;vespera&quot; &quot;evening&quot;, &quot;nona&quot; &quot;noon&quot; (Welsh &#x27;, Irish &quot;nóin&quot;), and &quot;ôra&quot; &quot;hour&quot; (Welsh &#x27;, Breton &#x27;, Irish &quot;uair&quot;).

A number of native Celtic terms survived the adoption of the Roman/Christian calendar, however:
==In Neopaganism==
In some Neopagan religions, a &quot;Celtic calendar&quot; loosely based on that of Medieval Ireland is observed for purposes of ritual. Adherents of Reconstructionist traditions may celebrate the four Gaelic festivals of Samhain, Imbolc, Beltane, and Lughnasadh.

Some eclectic Neopagans, such as Wiccans, combine the Gaelic fire festivals with solstices and equinox celebrations derived from non-Celtic cultures to produce the Wiccan modern Wheel of the Year. Some eclectic Neopagans are also influenced by Robert Graves&#x27; &quot;Celtic Tree Calendar&quot;, which has no foundation in historical calendars or actual ancient Celtic Astrology, instead being derived from Graves&#x27; extrapolation of &quot;The Song of Amergin&quot;.

<text>Earl of Monmouth was a title that was created twice in the Peerage of England. The title was first created for English courtier Robert Carey, 1st Baron Carey in 1626. He had already been created Baron Carey, of Leppington, in 1622, also in the Peerage of England. The titles became extinct upon the death of his son, the second Earl, who died without surviving male issue in 1661. The second creation, in 1689, was for the great-grandson of the first Earl of the first creation, Charles Mordaunt, 2nd Viscount Mordaunt. In 1697 he succeeded his uncle as Earl of Peterborough. See the latter title for more information.

In 1701, Charles Middleton, previously 2nd Earl of Middleton was awarded the Jacobite peerages of Earl of Monmouth and Viscount Clermont in the Peerage of England.

<text>Bearsville Records is a record label that was founded in 1970 by Albert Grossman. The label closed in 1984, two years before Grossman&#x27;s death. Sally Grossman, Albert Grossman’s widow, was running Bearsville Records from 2010 until her death in March 2021, at the age of 81.

Bearsville&#x27;s initial distributor was Ampex Records. From 1972 until its folding, the label was distributed by Warner Bros. Records in most countries. In the UK it was distributed by Warner until 1979, and then Island until 1981; its last few British releases were licensed to independent labels Avatar and Lamborghini. Bearsville Records ceased active operations in 1985. Rhino Records currently distributes Bearsville catalog.

Many of the artists on the roster recorded at Grossman&#x27;s Bearsville Studios, in the similarly named hamlet in Woodstock, New York.

<text>Cat Claw is a comic book superhero created by Serbian artist Branislav Kerac and writer Svetozar Obradović.

==History==
In the early 1980s, the publisher Dečje novine and editor Sibin Slavković called for comic strips that would resemble American superhero comics for their magazine &quot;YU Strip&quot;. Of the creators solicited, only Branislav Kerac and Svetozar Obradović responded. Their suggestions included Gea, a Red Sonja-type character, Cyborg, a Terminator-type character, and Cat Claw, a female version of Spider-Man. Kerac stated in a 1991 interview: &quot;I tried to imagine what the wet dream of every male pig would look like, and Cat Claw was the answer&quot;. Kerac penciled several pages and they were shopped around the Belgrade inkers, but most of them disliked the concept of the comic. Kerac ended up performing both duties. He was busy with his &quot;Kobra&quot; comic book, so one of the characters had to be dropped. Kerac chose to retain Cat Claw, which allowed him to emulate the work of one of his idols, John Romita. The first episode, &quot;Bane Claws&quot;, written by Obradović, was very much in the Marvel Comics style. It even included a cameo appearance of Peter Parker. Soon after, Obradović, due to various obligations, had to drop his work on &quot;Cat Claw&quot;. After a short cooperation with writer Slavko Draginčić, Kerac became the complete author of the comic As a writer, Kerac started to incorporate humor and allusions to various films, other comics and rock music, mostly heavy metal, into stories, which led some readers and critics to view &quot;Cat Claw&quot; as a parody of superhero comics.

In 1995, Kerac drew the 44th and last Cat Claw episode.

In 1989, Strip Art Features started distributing &quot;Cat Claw&quot; on the foreign market. &quot;Cat Claw&quot; was translated and published in USA, France, Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Turkey. Malibu Comics&#x27;s imprint Eternity Comics republished 9 issues of Cat Claw&#x27;s adventures. The beginning of the Yugoslav Wars prevented a more successful breakthrough of the comic on the foreign market.

In 2006, &quot;Cat Claw&quot; was published in hardcover albums as &quot;Cat Claw Ultimate Collection&quot;.

==Fictional character==
Carol Connor, an introverted university biology student, was scratched by a cat which had been used in an experiment. Later that same evening, when she attempted to shut down an experiment in Dr. Baker&#x27;s lab she was exposed to &quot;Sigma radiation&quot;. As a result, Carol found she had developed a cat&#x27;s agility and claw-like fingernails. She was also superhumanly strong and could see in the dark almost as well as during the day.

At first, Carol just used her powers for her own amusement. However, when she heard her roommate Gene Jones (called GJ or Dži-Džej in Serbian transliteration) being attacked outside their apartment building, she jumped to her defense and drove the attackers off. Carol enjoyed the experience and decided to create a costumed identity. Carol &quot;borrowed&quot; some special fabric, woven from metal, to create her mask, gloves and boots, from the Gray&#x27;s Institute. There was insufficient fabric to create a complete costume, so Carol used a black bikini Gene had given her (but she had never dared to wear) and fishnet pantyhose. The ordinary fabric of the bikini and hose got torn up and had to be replaced after every fight. Later, Carol adopted a black leotard and black leather jacket to replace the bikini.

Cat Claw went on to battle ordinary criminals and her own rogues gallery: Xtremity (aka Renata Roseblood), Berthold Schwartzenberger (aka Catminator and, later, Grgur the Monster), Dr. Sigismund Morse (Grgur&#x27;s creator), Dr. Bruce Baker (who also turns into a monster), Ninja Deathbringer, and the Helloweeners.

==TV film==
In 1992, as part of a Radio Television of Serbia show about Bane Kerac, a short film based on Cat Claw, &quot;City Cat&quot;, was recorded. The film was directed by Miša Milošević, and featured actress Danijela Pejić as Carol and Kerac himself as policeman Cameron Hill.

==Theater==
In 2022, a theater play based on Cat Claw had its premiere at the Youth Theatre. The play was directed by Michael Helmerhorst and co-adapted with Henri Overduin as a cooperation between European and local artists for the 2022 European Capital of Culture program held in Novi Sad that year. The original script draft was first written in English, then translated into Serbian. The lead role of Carol Connor/Cat Claw was played by Ivana Vukčević. Other actors and performers were Slobodan Ninković (Cameron Hill), Saša Latinović (Bullet), Miloš Macura (MacDonald), Jelica Gligorin (Cartland), Slavica Vučetić (Gene Jones), Neda Danilović (Xtremity), Aleksa Ilić (Schwartzenberger, drums), Nenad J. Popović (double role), Darko Radojević (keyboard), Dejan Šarković (drums), Vlada Janković (guitar) and Jelena Radić (bass guitar).

==In other media==

&quot;Cat Claw&quot; was the name of the 1996 album by Novi Sad heavy metal band GeroMetal, in which Kerac played the drums. Cover art was designed by Kerac and featured Cat Claw.

<text>Drama therapy is the use of theatre techniques to facilitate personal growth and promote mental health. Drama therapy is used in a wide variety of settings, including hospitals, schools, mental health centers, prisons, and businesses. Drama therapy, as a modality of the creative arts therapies, exists in many forms and can apply to individuals, couples, families, and various groups.

== History ==
The historical roots of dramatherapy have been discussed by Jones (2007). At different times in history drama has been used for psychological, political and religious change, for example Aristotle’s idea to use tragedy for ‘catharsis’. Several drama therapists have analyzed the historical roots of dramatherapy in the context of ancient traditions and rituals (Jones, 2007). However, according to Jones (2007), the specific connection between drama and therapy did not emerge until the nineteenth century and developed further throughout the twentieth century. The development of dramatherapy did not occur through one given pioneer, or even in one field, country or moment. Ideas about drama and healing were formed through several individual journeys and more or less accidental elements. David Johnstone and Renée Emunah stated that in the early stages of dramatherapy most drama therapists started as doers, actors or clinicians, ‘who discovered for themselves the exciting possibility of linking drama with healing’(Johnstone and Emunah, 2009, p. 16). Robert Landy noted that ‘(t)he field of drama therapy is an expansive one, developing in a number of countries simultaneously, most notably England, the United States and the Netherlands’(Landy, 1994, p. 32).

The Netherlands. In the Netherlands, the emergence of dramatherapy has been closely tied to the jobs of activity leader, youth worker and social welfare worker (Jones, 2007). Learning about therapy and arts in these professions increased during the 1950s. Drama in the context of learning about the arts was strongly influenced by ‘play therapy’. Two main influencers in the early stages were Lex Wils and Jan Boomsluiter, who wrote about drama as therapy in the 1950s. Dutch drama therapist Gé Cimmermans argued that the arts therapies, including dramatherapy, were initially mainly practiced by artists from Art Academies (Cimmermans, 2014, interviewed by Jorine Beck). Cimmermans (2014) also pointed to the influence of the School of Middeloo. This school was initially set up to train care givers who had to work with children that were affected by the Second World War (van der Linde, 2010). Students were trained in using play and creative activities as the main methodology, and gained knowledge in psychology, pedagogy and other courses related to human development. In the 1960s the school started to offer different art therapy courses, based on the experience in teaching both creativity and human development.

England. According to Brenda Meldrum (1994), dramatherapy in England evolved from 
drama in education, theatre in education and remedial drama from the 1960s onwards. 
Meldrum placed the start of dramatherapy in the context of the 1960s, when the 
establishment, including psychiatry, was being questioned and an optimism about new ideas 
and approaches to learning and the arts was embraced. These radical approaches can similarly 
be found in Grotowski’s new way of training actors -through laboratory theatre, in which the 
process was therapy for the actors and spectators- and the work of Heathcote, who encouraged 
children to learn and reflect through drama. Meldrum noted that these radical ideas frightened the establishment, but despite that other practitioners were influenced by these ideas and centres for remedial drama and dramatherapy started to be formed. In recent years, the wellbeing of actors in the creative industries has come into sharp focus in the UK. Beyond the therapeutic by-products of a life in the theatre, industrial protocols and educational policies are beginning to emerge that offer formalised support for student actors and actors in the profession.

Further development of the field
After the initial discoveries of the healing aspect of drama, the emerging field of 
dramatherapy became more organized. Different schools of emerged in both the Netherlands 
and England. In the Netherlands the first two art therapy organisations were formed in the 
1960s and from 1974 onwards official training courses were created (Jones, 2007). 
Cimmermans (2014) asserted that three main schools of thought emerged in dramatherapy in The Netherlands: The Creative Process Theory, the Analogue Process Model and the 
Cognitive Behavioural Model. According to Cimmermans, the Creative Process Theory was 
influenced by psychoanalytical and Rogerian theory. Henk Smeijsters (2006) wrote that the 
Creative Process Theory is based on the idea that through the creative arts process the client explores his or her needs, rediscovers suppressed needs, lets go of rigid patterns and 
experiments with new behaviour that fulfils the new discovered needs. The important element 
is the ‘aesthetic illusion’ that creates a safe distance in exploring the suppressed needs, which makes it less threatening for the client (Smeijsters, 2006). The Analogue Process Model is based on how the personal characteristics and the mental health issues of the client resonate with the client’s expression in the artistic process. The therapist tunes in with the client’s creative expression and explores alternative ways of thinking, feeling and acting together with the client through play and creativity (Smeijsters, 2006). Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can be implemented in dramatherapy, for instance in skills-based trainings (Cleven,2004). The emphasis here is on ‘rationalising objectively what clients hear, where and when, based on the idea that thoughts influence the experience, just such as the feeling about and meaning of the thoughts’ (Cleven, 2004, p. 44, translated from Dutch). The dialectical behavioural therapy and schema therapy as sub-branches of CBT, are part of this school of thought in dramatherapy (Cimmermans, 2014).

In England by 1977 dramatherapy was known as an alternative to psychodrama, and the first dramatherapy courses were established (Meldrum, 1994). According to Meldrum, Stanislavski, Artaud and Growtowski are influential on the practice of dramatherapy in England. The work of Stanislavski provides ideas about character building, the use of unconscious material, the re-creation of feeling and improvisation (Meldrum, 1994). The work of Artaud was inspired by symbolism and was a response to the dominance of realism which he found to be too word-bound and moralistic (Styan, 2003). Artaud argued that emotion is not verbal in itself and thus words cannot communicate the fullness of the human experience. Growtowski’s Poor Theatre was characterized by the rediscovery of the religious and mythical roots of drama (Meldrum, 1994). The Sesame Institute for drama and movement therapy cannot be excluded when discussing important influences in the field of dramatherapy in England. The institute was founded by Marian Lindkvist in the 1960s as a response to the dominant drug oriented treatments of mental illnesses (Sesame Institute, 2014). Therapies are based on the key concepts of drama, movement, ritual, play, psyche and touch.

Today, drama therapy is practiced around the world and there are presently academic training programs in Britain, Germany, the Netherlands, Canada, Croatia, Israel and the United States.

== Core processes ==

Phil Jones has written in his book &quot;Drama as Therapy, Theatre as Living&quot; that there are nine core processes at the heart of drama therapy. These include projective identification and dramatic distancing. Projective identification is the process whereby a person feels the feelings that the other is unable to access themselves. Dramatic distancing refers to the way that emotional and psychological problems can be accessed easier through metaphor. The client has a distanced relationship through metaphor to these problems that make them easier to tolerate.

== Becoming a drama therapist ==
In the US and Canada, the governing body is the North American Drama Therapy Association (NADTA), which establishes guidelines for the RDT (Registered Drama Therapist) credential and which provides accreditation for MA level programs and guidelines for alternative track training. In North America, Registered Drama Therapists hold a master&#x27;s degree from one of five institutions accredited by the National Association for Drama Therapy: Antioch University at Seattle, Washington; Lesley University at Cambridge, Massachusetts; NYU Steinhardt at New York City, New York; California Institute of Integral Studies (CIIS) at San Francisco, California and Concordia University at Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Persons who hold a master&#x27;s degree in a related field can be registered as a Drama Therapist by pursuing what is known as Alternate Route Training, which consists of graduate coursework and internships performed under the supervision of a board-certified trainer.

In The Netherlands, there are fulltime (voltijd) and parttime (deeltijd) Bachelor Dramatherapy qualifications, which are usually 4 years long. Institutions which offer the programs are University of Applied Sciences Hogeschool Arnhem and Nijmegen (HAN), Hogeschool Zuyd and Stenden Hogeschool. The Dutch professional body is the NvDt, the Nederlandse Vereniging voor Dramatherapie.

In the UK, the statutory regulator of drama therapists is the HCPC and the professional body is the British Association of Dramatherapists (BADth). There are currently four post-graduate training courses in Dramatherapy in the UK that lead to a qualification approved by the Health Professions Council, accredited by the British Association of Dramatherapists, and recognized by the Department of Health. These courses are offered at Roehampton University, University of Derby, Central School of Speech and Drama, and Anglia Ruskin University.

In China, drama therapy is an emerging field. It was first introduced to China in 2013. There have been a few organizations working on the field recently, such as Apollo, Xinyishe etc. 
The Hong Kong Association of Drama Therapists was established in 2009. Mr. Eddie Yu (President), Adeline Chan (Vice-president), Dorothy Wong and Kevin Ma are the founding members. Missions are to promote the professional development of drama therapists in Hong Kong.

Many of these universities suggest specific subjects to complete at degree level if you wish to pursue on to a masters programme in Drama Therapy. Some of these subjects are the following, Drama, Psychology or another such relevant profession.

==In practice==
The field of drama therapy can be somewhat varied in terms of techniques and procedures. However, there are some general commonalities. At the center of drama, therapy are the elements of role and story. Participants in drama therapy follow roles to tell a story or perform a part, thus embracing a new perspective of the character and themselves. Another key element is space, or where the acting takes place. Other components of drama therapy include ritual, conflict, resistance, spontaneity, distance and catharsis.

Drama therapy works to shed light on feelings and behaviors of a person and helps teach them ways to manage and overcome obstacles they struggle with. Clive Barker has called this a &quot;journey through our own psychic landscape.&quot; The hope is that by taking on specific roles a person can gain personal insight and break free from barriers. Though this process can be very beneficial and rewarding, it can be very difficult. Progressions and developments can be slow going, and participants may be resistant to the process.

Though drama therapy can be done individually, it is typically done in groups or community settings. Groups can involve hundreds of people at a time, but more commonly range from six to ten people in institutional settings. As a form of counseling drama therapy is usually private and doesn&#x27;t involve spectators. The exception to this rule is therapeutic theatre, which blends the techniques of applied drama to drama therapy. Therapeutic theatre entails the performance of a group of people to a selected audience, making it somewhat public.

<doc id="936113" wikidata="Q1676557" url="?curid=936113" title="JAWS (screen reader)">
<text>Job Access With Speech (JAWS) is a computer screen reader program for Microsoft Windows that allows blind and visually impaired users to read the screen either with a text-to-speech output or by a refreshable Braille display. JAWS is produced by the Blind and Low Vision Group of Freedom Scientific.

A 2023–2024 screen reader user survey by WebAIM, a web accessibility company, found JAWS to be the most popular desktop/laptop screen reader worldwide for primary usage (at 40.5%), while 60.5% of participants listed it as a commonly used screen reader, ranking it second in this measure behind NVDA.

JAWS supports Windows 10 and Windows 11 along with all versions of Windows Server released since Windows Server 2016. There are two versions of the program: the &quot;Home&quot; edition for non-commercial use and the &quot;Professional&quot; edition for commercial environments. Before JAWS 16, the &quot;Home&quot; edition was called &quot;Standard&quot;, and only worked on the home editions of Windows operating systems. A DOS version is free.

The JAWS Scripting Language allows the user to use programs without standard Windows controls, and programs that were not designed for accessibility.

== History ==

JAWS was originally released in 1989 by Ted Henter, a former motorcycle racer who lost his sight in a 1978 automobile accident. In 1985, Henter, along with a investment from Bill Joyce, founded the &quot;Henter-Joyce Corporation&quot; in St. Petersburg, Florida. Joyce sold his interest in the company back to Henter in 1990. In April 2000, Henter-Joyce, Blazie Engineering, and Arkenstone, Inc. merged to form Freedom Scientific.

JAWS was originally created for the MS-DOS operating system. It was one of several screen readers giving blind users access to text-mode MS-DOS applications. A feature unique to JAWS at the time was its use of cascading menus, in the style of the popular Lotus 1-2-3 application. What set JAWS apart from other screen readers of the era was its use of macros that allowed users to customize the user interface and work better with various applications.

Ted Henter and Rex Skipper wrote the original JAWS code in the mid-1980s, releasing version 2.0 in mid-1990. Skipper left the company after the release of version 2.0, and following his departure, Charles Oppermann was hired to maintain and improve the product. Oppermann and Henter regularly added minor and major features and frequently released new versions. Freedom Scientific now offers JAWS for MS-DOS as a freeware download from their website.

In 1993, Henter-Joyce released a highly modified version of JAWS for people with learning disabilities. This product, called WordScholar, is no longer available.

=== JAWS for Windows ===

In 1992, as Microsoft Windows became more popular, Oppermann began work on a new version of JAWS. A principal design goal was not to interfere with the natural user interface of Windows and to continue to provide a strong macro facility. Test and beta versions of JAWS for Windows (JFW) were shown at conferences throughout 1993 and 1994. During this time, developer Glen Gordon started working on the code, ultimately taking over its development when Oppermann was hired by Microsoft in November 1994. Shortly afterwards, in January 1995, JAWS for Windows 1.0 was released.

A new revision of JAWS for Windows is released about once a year, with minor updates in between.

== Features ==
JAWS allows all major functions of the Microsoft Windows operating system to be controlled with keyboard shortcuts and spoken feedback. These shortcuts are kept as consistent as possible throughout most programs, but the very high number of functions needed to fluidly use modern computer software effectively requires the end user to memorize many specific keystrokes. Virtually every aspect of JAWS can be customized by the user, including all keystrokes and factors such as reading speed, granularity used when reading punctuation, and hints. JAWS also includes a scripting language to automate tasks and make more complex modifications to the program&#x27;s behavior.

The software includes a distinct mode designed specifically for web browsers, activated when a browser is in the foreground. When browsing web pages, JAWS first declares the title and number of links. Speech can be stopped with the , lines are navigated with the / arrow keys, and the moves between links and controls. Specific letter keys on the keyboard can be pressed to navigate to the next or previous element of a specific type, such as text boxes or checkboxes. JAWS can access headings in Word and PDF documents in a similar fashion.

The JAWS feature set and its configurability have been described as &quot;complex&quot;, with training recommended for users such as web designers performing accessibility testing, to avoid drawing the wrong conclusions from such testing.

===Scripting Language===
JAWS Scripting Language (JSL) is a proprietary programming language that allows the interoperation of JAWS. It is a compiled language, allowing for source code protection. &quot;JAWS scripting&quot; commonly refers to customization of the built-in, user-editable utilities of JAWS and editing of its configuration files, as well as the writing of original scripts. JSL acts as an API (application programming interface) and allows users to combine JAWS scripting, Microsoft Active Accessibility scripting, and document object model scripting.

<text>Bizarre Records, self-identified simply as Bizarre, was a production company and record label formed for artists discovered by rock musician Frank Zappa and his business partner/manager Herb Cohen.

==History==
Bizarre was originally formed as a production company. In 1967 Zappa&#x27;s label, Verve Records, missed the deadline to renew their option on Zappa&#x27;s recording contract after his second album, &quot;Absolutely Free&quot;, recorded with his group the Mothers of Invention. This gave Zappa and Cohen the upper hand in negotiating their own production deal with Verve. The purpose of forming his own production company was to give Zappa complete creative control over his work and the works he planned to produce for others.

The first albums associated with Bizarre were released in early 1968. These included &quot;We&#x27;re Only in It for the Money&quot; by the Mothers of Invention and &quot;Lumpy Gravy&quot;, Zappa&#x27;s first solo album. Other Zappa-related releases were &quot;Cruising with Ruben &amp; the Jets&quot; (1968) and the compilation album &quot;Mothermania&quot; (1969). The company also produced the late 1968 release &quot;Sandy&#x27;s Album Is Here at Last&quot; by singer-songwriter Sandra Hurvitz, now better known as Essra Mohawk. These albums were all released by Verve Records with the Bizarre logo added to the label.

In early 1969 Bizarre was established as a record label distributed by the Warner Bros. Records family of labels, which also included Reprise Records. The Bizarre label was formed at the same time as a companion label, Straight Records, also distributed by Warner Bros. When the Bizarre and Straight labels were created, Zappa&#x27;s intention was to release albums by avant-garde artists on Bizarre, and recordings by more mainstream artists on Straight. The first release in this series was a double album, &quot;The Berkeley Concert&quot;, by Lenny Bruce. Early US pressings on Bizarre used a distinctive blue label design. Bizarre also released the double album debut of Wild Man Fischer, titled &quot;An Evening with Wild Man Fischer&quot;, in early 1969. 

However, the original Bizarre concept failed to work out as expected due to issues with distribution and management. This led to some very unusual albums on the Straight label especially those by Captain Beefheart, Alice Cooper and the GTOs. Zappa and the Mothers of Invention were the only artists who stayed with Bizarre. Zappa released eight of his own albums with and without the Mothers of Invention on Bizarre from 1969 to 1972. The only Zappa project not on Bizarre during this period was the &quot;200 Motels&quot; film soundtrack album, released by United Artists Records in 1971.

By 1973 the original Bizarre and Straight distribution contracts with Warner ended. Many Bizarre and Straight recordings were re-issued by Warner and or Reprise. Re-issues in the 1970s featured an orange Reprise Records label sometimes with a Bizarre logo. The same year Zappa and Cohen chose to launch a new company, DiscReet Records, once again distributed by Warner Bros. The Zappa/Mothers titles on Bizarre were available on Reprise until 1981. The back catalog was remastered (some remixed and expanded) by Zappa and leased to Rykodisc for reissue between 1987 and 1993. After Zappa&#x27;s death in 1993, his widow Gail Zappa&#x27;s relationship with Ryko soured and she eventually struck a deal with Universal Music Enterprises in 2012 to yet again re-issue the entire back-catalog the following year.

In 1988, Cohen licensed (from Warner Bros.) several of the albums that had been released on Bizarre and Straight and released them through Enigma Retro, including albums by Tim Buckley, Alice Cooper, and Beefheart, and called the label &quot;Bizarre/Straight Records&quot;. Bizarre/Straight also released Lenny Bruce&#x27;s &quot;The Berkeley Concert&quot; on CD and cassette. After Enigma went out of business in 1991, the label moved to Rhino Records for several years. Several of the albums that had been released on Bizarre/Straight eventually were re-released on Manifesto Records, established in 1995 and run by Evan Cohen, who is Herb Cohen&#x27;s nephew. &quot;An Evening with Wild Man Fischer&quot; was finally released on CD in March 2016.

On April 1, 2018, Frank Zappa&#x27;s official Facebook presence announced an impending reissue of Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band&#x27;s &quot;Trout Mask Replica&quot; (originally a Straight release), in a deluxe package released by Third Man Records. The press release also mentioned the impending relaunch of the Bizarre imprint, but no further information is currently available on said relaunch.

<text>Hunter Benedict Shepherd (born September 20, 1968) is an American musician best known as the bassist of rock band Soundgarden. Shepherd has won two Grammy Awards as a member of Soundgarden.

Born in Okinawa, Shepherd grew up in Washington and developed an interest in music after watching Johnny Cash on TV. He played in various punk-rock bands and eventually joined Soundgarden as their bassist in 1990. Shepherd contributed to the band&#x27;s musical evolution and played a significant role in songwriting. In 1993, he formed a side project, Hater, with Matt Cameron and John McBain. Soundgarden broke up in 1997, leading Shepherd to struggle with addiction and personal issues. He played in various bands before Soundgarden reunited in 2010, continuing until Chris Cornell&#x27;s death in 2017.

Shepherd released a solo album, &quot;In Deep Owl&quot;, in 2013, and has two children. He partially owns an upscale Seattle bar, Hazlewood, and resides on Bainbridge Island, Washington.

== Early life ==
Shepherd was born in an American military base in Okinawa. His father worked in the Nike missile program and played the guitar. His family moved to Allen, Texas, then settled in Kingston, Washington, where Shepherd grew up. Shepherd became interested in music after listening to Johnny Cash on television. When Shepherd asked his father for a guitar, his father complied only after insisting he must learn every chord in a large book with nothing but a guitar neck. Shepherd did so—with help from his cousin Ralph &quot;Tony&quot; McMullen—and his father bought him his first guitar.

Shepherd played in numerous punk-rock bands with friends as a teenager like March of Crimes, Mind Circus and 600 School, meeting future musicians such as Stone Gossard, Krist Novoselic and Matt Cameron. After graduating from high school, he worked as a carpenter and a laborer, and while playing in Tic Dolly Row with drummer friend Chad Channing, introduced him to Novoselic, who went on to bring Channing into his band Nirvana. Shepherd would later travel with Nirvana on a tour leading up to the release of &quot;Nevermind&quot;, being a nominal second guitarist but not playing on stage.

== Musical career ==
=== Soundgarden (1990–1997) ===
Shepherd was a fan of Soundgarden ever since their early days as a three-piece. Once bassist Hiro Yamamoto left in 1989, Shepherd auditioned to replace him even as his primary instrument was the guitar. The band members liked Shepherd and his attitude, but given he did not know how to play the songs, they eventually picked bassist Jason Everman. Following the closure of the &quot;Louder Than Love&quot; tour in 1990, Everman was fired, and the band contacted Shepherd to see if he could join the band. His introduction was deemed by Soundgarden as helpful towards their musical evolution, bringing his own compositions that showed a new style, and guitarist Kim Thayil adding that Shepherd gave &quot;a creative and emotional punch&quot;.

In addition to his role as bass player, Shepherd&#x27;s role as a singer and songwriter increased during his tenure with Soundgarden. On his first recording with the band, the studio album &quot;Badmotorfinger&quot;, Shepherd took part in writing the following songs: &quot;Slaves &amp; Bulldozers&quot; (music, co-written), &quot;Jesus Christ Pose&quot; (music, co-written), &quot;Face Pollution&quot; (music), and &quot;Somewhere&quot; (music and lyrics). Shepherd also introduced some of the now signature alternate tunings to the band, such as in the singles &quot;The Day I Tried To Live&quot;, &quot;My Wave&quot;, &quot;Pretty Noose&quot;, and &quot;Burden in My Hand&quot;.

In 1993, Shepherd and Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron formed a side-project band called Hater with John McBain of Monster Magnet. Shepherd sang vocals and played guitar in Hater, in addition to writing several songs on the band&#x27;s first release, a self-titled album. A second album called &quot;The 2nd&quot; was recorded in 1995 after Superunknown tour&#x27;s end, but was not released until 2005, ten years later.

In 1994, Soundgarden released &quot;Superunknown&quot;, which featured Shepherd&#x27;s compositions &quot;Half&quot; and &quot;Head Down&quot;. The latter of which was heavily influenced by The Beatles and was written after experimenting with mic placement on his Gibson L-50, picking up the guitar and strumming it to find he liked the wildly out of tune sound, making up the song&#x27;s composition on the spot. &quot;Half&quot; was marked by an Indian flavor and was the first song on a Soundgarden album for which Shepherd sang lead vocals. Shepherd has said that &quot;Half&quot; was a song he wrote in case his daughter ever wanted to learn guitar.

In 1996, Soundgarden released &quot;Down on the Upside&quot;, in which six of the sixteen album tracks were lyrically and/or musically composed by Shepherd. The tracks were: &quot;Zero Chance&quot; (music), &quot;Dusty&quot; (music), &quot;Ty Cobb&quot; (music), &quot;Never Named&quot; (music) &quot;Switch Opens&quot; (music) and &quot;An Unkind&quot; (music and lyrics). Shepherd once said he penned the music for &quot;Never Named&quot; at the age of sixteen. &quot;Ty Cobb&quot; was the first song Shepherd wrote that was made a single.

The &quot;Down on the Upside&quot; tour ended on February 9, 1997, in Honolulu, with an acrimonious meltdown started by Shepherd. With the band in a bad mood and facing technical problems in their performance, Shepherd eventually got so frustrated he smashed his bass during &quot;Blow Up the Outside World&quot;, gave the audience the finger and left the stage. He later said, &quot;I&#x27;d had it up to here with my equipment dying. So I wasn&#x27;t going to stand onstage and fake what I was playing.&quot; He then started a heated argument with Thayil backstage that nearly escalated into a fistfight, leading to only Cornell and Cameron returning for the encore. Two months later, Soundgarden announced it was breaking up, citing dissatisfaction and artistic differences.

=== Post-Soundgarden (1997–2010) ===
Shepherd said that he was the one most affected by Soundgarden&#x27;s breakup: &quot;my fianceé broke up with me; and then I broke three ribs. I got addicted to pain pills, drank a ton, and wound up OD&#x27;ing on morphine. I was laid out in my house for five days, and no one knew it. It was a fucking horrible time — this total rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll cliché.&quot;

Shepherd also disbanded, but he, Cameron, and McBain would go on to form Wellwater Conspiracy with several other artists. Shepherd was the lead vocalist on the first Wellwater Conspiracy album, &quot;Declaration of Conformity&quot;. In 1998, he quit Wellwater Conspiracy for unknown reasons. Matt Cameron took over lead vocals.

In the years after the split, Shepherd participated in some of Josh Homme&#x27;s Desert Sessions collaboration (&quot;Volumes 1 &amp; 2)&quot;, on which he played bass and guitar, and played bass with Mark Lanegan (in the 1999 album &quot;I&#x27;ll Take Care of You&quot; and 2001&#x27;s &quot;Field Songs&quot;, where he even wrote co-wrote the song &quot;Blues For D&quot;), and Tony Iommi (2000&#x27;s &quot;Iommi&quot;). In 2005, Shepherd formed the shortly lived band Unkmongoni and released the second Hater album, &quot;The 2nd&quot;.

In 2008, following the sale of the warehouse Soundgarden&#x27;s equipment was being stored in, Shepherd was robbed of all his equipment including guitars, basses, and amplifiers collected and used through Soundgarden&#x27;s career, and two records he had completed. Following the incident, a downtrodden Shepherd decided to quit music altogether and became a carpenter&#x27;s assistant until he was eventually coerced into making his solo record &quot;In Deep Owl&quot; and reuniting with Soundgarden shortly thereafter.

In an August 2010 feature about the Soundgarden reunion with &quot;Spin&quot;, Shepherd stated that before reuniting he was &quot;totally broke&quot; and was sleeping on friends&#x27; couches. Shepherd has since downplayed the statement, stating that he was only &quot;sleeping on couches in studios when I was recording my solo album&quot;, preferring to stay in Seattle rather than go back home to Bainbridge Island.

=== Soundgarden reunion (2010–2017) ===

On January 1, 2010, Chris Cornell confirmed that Soundgarden would reunite, with Shepherd playing as their bassist again. The band played its first show in 13 years on April 16, 2010, at Seattle&#x27;s Showbox theater under the anagram &quot;Nudedragons&quot;.

The group released the compilation album &quot;Telephantasm&quot; in September 2010, followed by &quot;King Animal&quot; in November 2012, their first studio album since 1996. Shepherd&#x27;s contributions included two songs which he had written years before and recorded in the eventually stolen demos, &quot;Taree&quot; and &quot;Attrition&quot;, and two collaborations with Cornell, &quot;Been Away Too Long&quot; and &quot;Rowing&quot;.

The band continued to tour frequently, arranging time around Matt Cameron&#x27;s schedule in Pearl Jam, and Chris Cornell&#x27;s acoustic tours. In 2014, the band released a reissue of their 1994 album &quot;Superunknown&quot; as part of its twentieth anniversary and has toured with drummer Matt Chamberlain filling in for Cameron.

Chris Cornell&#x27;s sudden death on May 17, 2017, resulted in the cancellation of the rest of their tour.

===Solo project===
In the summer of 2010, Shepherd finished recording his latest solo project. He began writing the record in 2009. It started out as an acoustic project, before morphing into a very electrified concept album in the end. Shepherd originally intended for the songs to be just voice and acoustic guitar, but soon Matt Cameron and Matt Chamberlain offered up their services on drums. The album was recorded by Dave French, at a few different studios including KAOS in Georgetown, and The Studio With No Name in Interbay. The album was finished, mixed/mastered at Robert Lang Studios by Adam Kasper and contains a recording of frog ribbits.

On June 25, 2013, Shepherd announced he would be releasing the solo album entitled &quot;In Deep Owl&quot; on August 27, 2013, under the name HBS. Shepherd premiered the first single &quot;Baron Robber&quot; on &quot;Spin&quot;. 
Featured musicians include:
* Ben Shepherd – Guitar, Bass guitar, Vocals, Mandolin, Drums
* Matt Cameron – Drums, percussion
* Matt Chamberlain – Drums, percussion
* Joseph Braley – Drums, percussion
* Greg Gilmore – Drums, percussion
* Klaus – Winds (Sax)

==Personal life==
Shepherd has two children. He currently resides on Bainbridge Island, Washington. Shepherd is also the partial owner of an upscale Seattle bar called Hazlewood.

==Musical style==

Shepherd started playing bass trying to replace former Soundgarden bassist Hiro Yamamoto. He considers his predecessor a major influence, particularly as Yamamoto differed from bassists &quot;relegated to a role of following along&quot;, even if his bass &quot;was mixed so damn quietly on the recordings that I could never hear him well enough to develop a deep understanding of his fluidity or his textures.&quot; 

Shepherd followed a fingerstyle playing based on Yamamoto, punk rock musicians Chuck Dukowski from Black Flag, and Mike Watt. He also listened to jazz bassist Charles Mingus &quot;because I wanted to learn how to play some dirty, weird shit.&quot; Certain songs have Shepherd using a pick to provide &quot;different textures&quot;. Shepherd considers that he approaches guitars &quot;like a horn section&quot;, split between rhythm and lead, while &quot;Bass is more fluid; you&#x27;re a lot more free to do stuff because it&#x27;s a song within a song&quot;. Rather than the more common practice of synchronizing with the drummer, Shepherd&#x27;s preference is to play the bass along to the vocals, as &quot;it helps to harmonize&quot;.

As a singer, Shepherd described himself as &quot;trying to find out who I sound like, not like someone else.&quot; Composing is usually done by Shepherd on the guitar, given all other Soundgarden members play that instrument. Bass-minded tracks such as &quot;Switch Opens&quot; are rare because, as he explained &quot;you don&#x27;t want to write a whole wandering bass line wondering what the drum beat and the guitar chords are going to be.&quot;

== Musical equipment ==
In 2008, Shepherd had all of his equipment stolen from Soundgarden&#x27;s storage warehouse, forcing him to buy new instruments and amplifiers.

;Guitars:
* 1976–1979 Fender Jazz Bass - Originally owned by the Wood brothers and used by Andy while in Malfunkshun, Shepherd purchased this black Jazz Bass for the Soundgarden auditions, and nicknamed it &quot;Tree&quot; because of its heavy weight.

<doc id="936133" wikidata="Q1030169" url="?curid=936133" title="Peritoneal cavity">
<text>The peritoneal cavity is a potential space located between the two layers of the peritoneum—the parietal peritoneum, the serous membrane that lines the abdominal wall, and visceral peritoneum, which surrounds the internal organs. While situated within the abdominal cavity, the term &quot;peritoneal cavity&quot; specifically refers to the potential space enclosed by these peritoneal membranes. The cavity contains a thin layer of lubricating serous fluid that enables the organs to move smoothly against each other, facilitating the movement and expansion of internal organs during digestion.

The parietal and visceral peritonea are named according to their location and function. The peritoneal cavity, derived from the coelomic cavity in the embryo, is one of several body cavities, including the pleural cavities surrounding the lungs and the pericardial cavity around the heart.

The peritoneal cavity is the largest serosal sac and fluid-filled cavity in the body, it secretes approximately of fluid daily. This fluid serves as a lubricant and has anti-inflammatory properties. The cavity is divided into the greater and lesser sacs, with the greater sac further subdivided into the supracolic and infracolic compartments.

==Compartments==

The peritoneal cavity is divided into the greater and lesser sacs. The greater sac comprises the majority of the peritoneal cavity, while the lesser sac, also known as the omental bursa, is smaller and situated posterior to the stomach and lesser omentum. They are connected by the omental foramen.

The greater sac is further subdivided into two compartments by the mesentery of the transverse colon, known as the transverse mesocolon. This division creates an upper and a lower compartment within the greater sac, named the supracolic and infracolic compartment respectively, each housing different organs and structures of the abdominal cavity.

The liver, spleen, stomach, and lesser omentum are contained within the supracolic compartment. The small intestine surrounded by the ascending, transverse, and descending colon, and the paracolic gutters are contained within the infracolic compartment.

== Clinical significance ==
The peritoneal cavity is widely used in intraperitoneal injections to administer chemotherapy drugs, and is also utilized in peritoneal dialysis. An increase in capillary pressure in the abdominal organs can cause fluid to leave the interstitial space and enter the peritoneal cavity, resulting in a condition called ascites. When cerebrospinal fluid overaccumulates, such as in hydrocephalus, the fluid is commonly diverted intentionally to the peritoneal cavity using a surgically placed cerebral shunt. Sampling of body fluid from the peritoneal cavity is referred to as peritoneocentesis.

<doc id="936143" wikidata="Q7177640" url="?curid=936143" title="Peter Weir, Baron Weir of Ballyholme">
<text>Peter James Weir, Baron Weir of Ballyholme (born 21 November 1968), is a Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) politician who served as Minister for Education in the Northern Ireland Executive from 2016 to 2017 and from 2020 to 2021. Weir was the first non-Sinn Féin legislator (following Martin McGuinness, Caitríona Ruane, and John O&#x27;Dowd) to head the Department of Education since the department came into existence on 2 December 1999.

He served as a Member of the Northern Ireland Assembly (MLA) from 1998 to 2022, originally being a member for North Down, which he represented from 1998 to 2017, before being elected as a member for Strangford in 2017. He lost his seat at the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election. Since 2022 he has been a member of the House of Lords.

==Early life==
Weir attended Bangor Grammar School and graduated from The Queen&#x27;s University of Belfast in Law and Accountancy. He was called to the Bar of Northern Ireland in 1992 and is a former editor of &quot;The Ulster Review&quot;. Weir has been a member of the Queen&#x27;s University Senate since 1996 and is also leading member of the University Convocation. He was elected to the Northern Ireland Peace Forum in 1996 for the constituency of North Down.

==Political career==
Weir is a former chairman of the Young Unionists (the UUP Youth Wing).

Weir refused to support the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, saying in one television interview that the only positive comment he could summon for the Agreement was that it was &quot;very nicely typed&quot;. A leading critic of then-party leader David Trimble&#x27;s policies, Weir was elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in the 1998 election.

Weir was selected as his party&#x27;s candidate to fight the 2001 general election in North Down, but a month before the election tensions between him and the party reached the stage where he was deselected and replaced by Sylvia Hermon. Weir was later expelled from the Ulster Unionist Party for refusing to support the re-election of David Trimble as First Minister of Northern Ireland. Following a period as an Independent Unionist, Weir joined the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) in 2002.

Since then, he has been re-elected to the Northern Ireland Assembly in North Down at each election for the DUP. In the 2005 Westminster election Weir was a DUP candidate for North Down, but lost to Sylvia, Lady Hermon, of the Ulster Unionist Party.

He lost his seat in the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election.

He is a former member of the North Down Borough Council.

It was announced on 14 October 2022, that as part of the 2022 Special Honours, Weir would receive a life peerage, sitting for the Democratic Unionist Party. On 16 November 2022, Weir was created Baron Weir of Ballyholme, &quot;of Ballyholme in the County of Down&quot;.

==Personal life==
Lord Weir of Ballyholme is a barrister by profession.

He is a member of the Orange Order and the Royal Black Preceptory. He attends Hamilton Road Presbyterian Church.

Weir reported in November 2021 that one of his toes had been amputated as a result of an infection following a type 1 diabetes diagnosis.

<doc id="936145" wikidata="Q3104680" url="?curid=936145" title="Getty Oil">
<text>Getty Oil Company was an American oil marketing company with its origins as part of the large integrated oil company founded by J. Paul Getty. They went defunct in 2012.

==History==
J. Paul Getty incorporated Getty Oil in 1942. He had previously worked in the oil fields of Oklahoma along with his father George Getty. When George died, he left J. Paul with $500,000 and a projection that he would destroy the family business.

Starting in 1949, J. Paul Getty negotiated a 30-year concession in the neutral zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Gordon Getty and his family inherited a 40% interest in the company when J. Paul Getty died in 1976. 

In 1984, after entering into a binding agreement to sell Getty and its 2.3-billion-barrel stockpile of proven oil reserves to Pennzoil, Gordon Getty struck a dramatic deal to sell the company to Texaco.

On November 19, 1985, in the case of &quot;Texaco, Inc. v. Pennzoil, Co.&quot;, Pennzoil won a US$10.53 billion verdict against Texaco in the largest civil verdict in U.S. history as a result of the violation of the binding agreement. Following extensive litigation seeking to overturn the verdict, Texaco filed for bankruptcy, after which Pennzoil agreed to settle the case for $3 billion.

While the reserves were sold, only some of the refineries changed hands, and Getty continued to exist as a downstream entity. Getty gas stations in the Northeast were sold off as a condition of the buyout. The company became known as Getty Petroleum Marketing Inc.

Getty Petroleum Marketing was sold to Lukoil in 2000, and Lukoil sold it to Cambridge Securities LLC in February 2011. Getty Petroleum filed for bankruptcy protection (Chapter 11) on December 5, 2011.

At one point, Getty Oil owned a majority stake of ESPN, before Getty&#x27;s purchase by Texaco which then sold ESPN to ABC in 1984.

<text>An opposing force (alternatively enemy force, abbreviated OPFOR or OpFor) is a military unit tasked with representing an enemy, usually for training purposes in war game scenarios. The related concept of aggressor squadron is used by some air forces.

At a basic level, a unit might serve as an opposing force for a single scenario, differing from its &#x27;opponents&#x27; only in the objectives it is given. However, major armies commonly maintain specialized groups trained to accurately replicate real-life enemies, to provide a more realistic experience for their training opponents. (To avoid the diplomatic ramifications of naming a real nation as a likely enemy, training scenarios often use fictionalized versions with different names but similar military characteristics to the expected real-world foes.)

== Units ==

===Canada===
The Canadian Armed Forces has OPFOR units from the Canadian Manoeuvre Training Centre.

=== China ===

=== France ===
In the French Army, a FORAD (, enemy force) is used to train the army, in both the (CENTAC, Combat Training Center) of Mailly-le-Camp and in the (CENZUB, Urban Operations Training Centre). Declassed AMX-30 tanks were used to simulate Soviet T-72s, until 2018.

=== Republic of Korea ===
=== Japan ===
=== United States ===
There are three major training centers that utilize home-based OPFOR units for the US Army:

* The National Training Center or &quot;NTC&quot; at Fort Irwin, California—home unit is the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment (the &quot;Blackhorse&quot;)
* The Joint Readiness Training Center or &quot;JRTC&quot; at Fort Johnson, Louisiana—home unit is the 1st Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment (the &quot;Geronimos&quot;)
* The Joint Multinational Readiness Center or &quot;JMRC&quot; (formerly known as the Combat Maneuver Training Center or CMTC) at Hohenfels, Germany—home unit is the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment (Separate) (the &quot;Warriors&quot;)

Various US military installations or major units have their own local versions of opposing force used for training exercises. The joint Australian–US military exercise &quot;Crocodile &#x27;03&quot; featured an Australian-led opposing force in which soldiers from a range of Australian units worked together with a US Marine Corps contingent.

Several state defense forces have served as OPFOR units when training with the National Guard. The California State Guard, the Georgia State Defense Force, and the New York Guard have provided OPFOR services to their respective National Guard counterparts. In 2018, the Georgia State Defense Force established the OPFOR Battalion to assist National Guard Soldiers with pre-deployment training.

<text>Claude Raymond Wickard (February 28, 1893 – April 29, 1967) was an American Democratic politician who served as the secretary of agriculture during the administrations of Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman from 1940 to 1945.

==Biography==
Wickard was born on his family farm in Carroll County, Indiana, near Camden, on February 28, 1893. He was born to Iva Lenora (&quot;née&quot; Kirkpatrick) and Andrew Jackson Wickard. He graduated from Purdue University in 1915 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in agriculture, and he was chosen as &quot;Master Farmer of Indiana&quot; in 1927 for his improvements in stock feeding and farming.

He was elected from the Indiana Senate in 1932, and was appointed as Undersecretary of Agriculture. When Henry A. Wallace resigned as the secretary of agriculture in September 1940 to run for Vice-President in the 1940 presidential election, Wickard was appointed to the post.

He was on the winning side in &quot;Wickard v. Filburn,&quot; in which the U.S. Supreme Court decided in a case that the federal government could control wheat that was grown in one state for the personal use of a farmer.

During World War II, Wickard headed the War Food Administration, promoting increased farmer production as a matter of patriotism. His slogan was &quot;Food Will Win the War and Write the Peace.&quot; On January 18, 1943, Wickard banned the sale of presliced bread, possibly to save tools and wax paper, as required at the time. The ban lasted for less than two months, being rescinded in March 1943. He resigned on June 29, 1945, to become Chief of the Rural Electrification Administration, where he served until 1953. He ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate in 1956, losing to incumbent Homer E. Capehart.

Wickard was killed in an automobile accident and died on April 29, 1967. Reportedly, he ran a stop sign at the intersection of Indiana State Road 18 and the U.S. Highway 421 near Delphi, Indiana, and his vehicle was hit by a crushed-stone truck. He is interred in Maple Lawn Cemetery in Flora, Indiana.

<text>William Wilton (9 June 1865 – 2 May 1920) was a Scottish football player, administrator and manager. He was the first manager of Rangers Football Club, serving in that position from 1899 until his death in 1920, and leading Rangers to nine major trophies. He had previously served as Rangers&#x27; match secretary to the reserve and first teams.

==Early life==
William Wilton was born at Blyth&#x27;s Land on Nelson Street in Largs, Ayrshire on 9 June 1865, the son of James Wilton, a stonemason from the Isle of Arran, and Janet Smith, a weaver from Paisley. Wilton grew up in Largs and the Kingston area of Glasgow, and worked in Glasgow as a mercantile clerk with a sugar broker and then a sugar refining machinery manufacturer.

==Career==
Wilton joined the club in September 1883 as a player but never progressed beyond the second string eleven. He was soon appointed secretary to the club&#x27;s youth team and reserve side. He was also on the special committee that oversaw the club&#x27;s move from Kinning Park to the first Ibrox ground in 1887.

Wilton became match secretary of the first team in 1889, succeeding James Gossland. The club shared the inaugural Scottish League title in 1891. Wilton had been appointed as the league&#x27;s first treasurer at the start of the season. In his decade as match secretary for the first team, the club won two Scottish league championships in 1891 and 1899, as well as three Scottish Cups in 1894, 1897 and 1898. He also won four Glasgow Cups in 1893, 1894, 1897 and 1898, and a Glasgow Merchants Charity Cup in 1897. Rangers had achieved the first ever 100% league record, winning all 18 games and scoring 79 goals in 1898–99; to date no team has achieved the same, although several teams have gone unbeaten in a league season since.

When the club became a limited company in 1899, Wilton was chosen as manager. Under his stewardship as manager, Rangers won eight league championships and another Scottish Cup, nine Glasgow Cups and seven Charity Cups. He also guided the club&#x27;s move to the second (extant) Ibrox Park in 1899 and its response to the disaster at that venue three years later. In his final season as manager the club won its tenth league championship. Wilton died in a boating accident in May 1920. He was Rangers manager in 881 matches (not including his earlier spell as secretary), of which they won 553. He is buried at Cathcart Cemetery in East Renfrewshire.

<doc id="936178" wikidata="Q6239934" url="?curid=936178" title="John Horton Slaughter">
<text>John Horton Slaughter (October 2, 1841 – February 16, 1922), also known as Texas John Slaughter, was an American lawman, cowboy, poker player and rancher in the Southwestern United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. After serving in the Confederate States Army during the American Civil War, Slaughter earned a reputation fighting hostile Indians and Mexican and American outlaws in the Arizona and New Mexico territories. In the latter half of his life, he lived at the San Bernardino Ranch, which is today a well-preserved National Historic Landmark in Cochise County in far southeastern Arizona. In 1964, he was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Slaughter was born in 1841 on a horse Southern plantation in Sabine Parish near Many in western Louisiana. His parents were Benjamin Slaughter and the former Minerva Mabry. He was educated in schools in Texas in Sabine County and Caldwell County. From Mexican vaqueros, he learned how to herd cattle and how to speak Spanish.

In the early 1860s, Slaughter defended American settlers against hostile Comanche as a Texas Ranger. During the Civil War, he served in the Confederate States Army. He fought Union forces in Burnet County, west of the capital city of Austin, Texas.

===Career===
In 1874, he, along with his brother, became a cattle driver in Atascosa County, south of San Antonio. The two formed a cattle-transporting company, the San Antonio Ranch Company, which drove cattle to Kansas via the Chisholm Trail. One (if not the only) of his cattle drive bosses was his first cousin Lewis Warren Neatherlin. Neatherlin&#x27;s brother, James Franklin Neatherlin, also the Slaughter brothers&#x27; first cousin, assisted on the drive.

In the late 1870s, Slaughter left Texas for New Mexico, where he traded cattle and planned to start a ranch. However, he eventually decided to establish the ranch in the Arizona Territory. Initially settling in Charleston, Arizona, he later purchased the San Bernardino Ranch, on the U.S.–Mexico border near Douglas, in 1884.

In 1886, Slaughter was elected sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona, five years after the infamous Gunfight at the O.K. Corral. He was later re-elected to a second term. As sheriff, he helped track Geronimo, the Apache chief who was caught on the San Bernardino Ranch. Slaughter fought for law and order with his six-shooter, a shotgun, and a repeating Henry rifle. He arrested desperados like the Jack Taylor Gang and brought them to justice.

He also became a prominent poker player, often playing all night long. He was reportedly good at bluffing. He often played with the cattle baron John Chisum. Once, in San Antonio, Texas, he was cheated by cattle rustler Bryan Gallagher. Slaughter claimed the pot but Bryan fled. Slaughter tracked down Gallagher all the way to New Mexico at Chisum&#x27;s ranch and shot him down.

===Personal life===
Slaughter married Eliza Adeline Harris on August 4, 1871. Of their four children, only two, Addie and Willie, survived until adulthood. Eliza died in 1877 of smallpox in Tucson.

On April 16, 1879, Slaughter, at the age of thirty-seven, married eighteen-year-old Cora Viola Howell at Tularosa, New Mexico Territory. The Slaughters had no children of their own, but they adopted several children, including Apache May, whom Slaughter encountered in 1896 while chasing the Apache Kid in Mexico.

Years later, when he became ill, the Slaughters moved to an apartment on Twelfth Street in Douglas, Arizona.

Previously believed to be Slaughter&#x27;s former slave, John Swain (Slaughter), an experienced cowboy, settled in Tombstone and became one of its oldest and longstanding residents, dying at the age of nearly 100 in 1945.
However, John Slaughter hired Swain on as an employee in Texas in 1879 prior to moving to Arizona. Swain was employed by Slaughter for a brief period before leaving the San Bernardino ranch and moving to Tombstone where he remained until his death. John Horton Slaughter never owned a slave.

===Death===
Slaughter was found on the morning of February 16, 1922, in his Douglas apartment, having died sometime during the previous night. He was buried at the Calvary Cemetery in Douglas.

<doc id="936181" wikidata="Q7637425" url="?curid=936181" title="Summer Science Program">
<text>The Summer Science Program (SSP) is an academic summer program where high school students experience college-level education and do research in celestial mechanics by studying the orbits of asteroids, biochemistry by studying the kinetic properties of enzymes, genomics by studying antibiotic resistance, or synthetic chemistry by studying macrocyclic catalysts. The program was established in 1959 at The Thacher School in Ojai, California. It now takes place on three astrophysics campuses, New Mexico State University in Las Cruces, New Mexico, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and University of Colorado, Boulder in Boulder, Colorado, and two biochemistry campuses, Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana and Indiana University Bloomington in Bloomington, Indiana.

In the Astrophysics program, each team takes a series of images of a near-earth asteroid, then writes software to calculate its orbit and predict its future path. In the Biochemistry program, each team isolates and models an enzyme from a fungal crop pathogen, then designs a molecule to inhibit that enzyme. In the Genomics program, each team grows a culture of &quot;Vibrio natriegens&quot; under moderate antibiotic selection pressure.

==Overview==
Each Summer Science Program campus hosts 36 participants and 7 faculty for 39 days. Faculty have integrated academic and residential roles. The participant experience is designed to be similar at all campuses. For the research, participants are organized into teams of three. The schedule includes classroom time, lab time, field trips (scientific and recreational) and guest lectures from working scientists and other professionals. Past guest speakers have included Maarten Schmidt, who has done pioneering work in quasars; Richard Feynman, a Nobel laureate in physics; James Randi, magician and debunker of pseudoscience; Mitch Kapor, founder of Lotus Development; Paul MacCready, creator of the Gossamer Condor and Gossamer Albatross; and Eric Allin Cornell, a Nobel laureate in physics.

The application process and admission criteria are similar to that of selective colleges. Primarily juniors (rising seniors) are admitted, with a few sophomores each year. There is a program fee, inclusive of tuition, room &amp; board, and supplies. Need-based financial aid grants are available to cover part or all of the fee, with SSP guaranteeing to meet all demonstrated need. Donations to the nonprofit fund financial aid.

In 1991, the National Academies&#x27; Commission on Physical Sciences, Mathematics, and Applications observed that &quot;All participants go on to college. About 37 percent of the pre-1985 graduates are now working in science and medicine, and 34 percent in engineering, mathematics, and computer science (including the founder of Lotus Development Corporation).&quot;

The program is co-sponsored by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the California Institute of Technology which are affiliate universities, and by Harvey Mudd College, which is an academic partner to the program.

==History==
The program was established in 1959 at The Thacher School in Ojai, California, as a response to the launch of Sputnik 1 and the start of the Space Race. The Headmaster at Thacher was concerned that the country&#x27;s top high school students were not being adequately informed and inspired about careers in the physical sciences. He decided to create an intense summer program to challenge such students and give them a taste of &quot;doing real science,&quot; with assistance from Caltech, UCLA, Claremont Colleges, and Stanford. Financial support came from Hughes Aircraft.

The first SSP was led by Dr. Paul Routly and Dr. Foster Strong. In 1960, Dr. George Abell joined the program for his first of more than 20 summers at SSP.

The first year, SSP had 26 students. The students used data from the &quot;Russian ephemeris&quot; (&quot;Ephemyeredi Mahlikh Planyet&quot;) to find asteroids to photograph, measured the positions, and submitted the data to the Minor Planet Center at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian. The students were excited to find that when they calculated the orbit of 9 Metis, their data resulted in a significant correction to the Russian ephemeris.

Women were admitted starting in 1969, and reached 50% of enrollment in 2010.

After 41 summers at Thacher, a significant threat to the continuation of SSP came in 2000, when Thacher School decided to use its entire campus for a different purpose. SSP alumni incorporated Summer Science Program, Inc., solicited funding largely from the alumni community, and found a new host campus. Beginning in 2000, SSP was held at the Happy Valley School, located just across the Ojai Valley from The Thacher School. In 2007, Happy Valley School was renamed Besant Hill School.

With the alumni rescue complete, they soon began looking to expand the program. In 2003 a second campus opened at New Mexico Tech in Socorro with the support of New Mexico Tech, Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories, and others. In 2010, the California campus moved to Westmont College in Santa Barbara, then in 2015 to University of Colorado Boulder.
In 2016, following three years of planning and preparation, a pilot of the first SSP in Biochemistry was held at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. Six alumni from the previous summer successfully ran through the new experiment. In 2017, the first SSP in Biochemistry was successfully held with 24 participants. In 2022, the first SSP in Genomics took place at Purdue University with 24 participants.

Through 2017, over 2,500 participants have attended 75 programs. All alumni and former faculty are &quot;members&quot; of the nonprofit for life, along with other members named by the Board. The Members elect Trustees annually, have access to an online database for networking, and are invited to an Annual Dinner held each fall.

In 2022, 1969 alum and co-founder of Qualcomm, Franklin Antonio, donated $200 million to SSP in his will after his passing.

==Astronomical work==

For the first 50 years of the program, students took photographic images of main-belt asteroids (between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter). Starting in 2009 students took digital images of (much fainter) near-Earth asteroids (inside the orbit of Mars). The process of orbit determination is conceptually the same in both cases. First students take a series of images of asteroids. After identifying the asteroid, its position on the image relative to known stars is carefully calculated. That relative position is then used to determine the position of the asteroid in celestial coordinates (right ascension and declination) at the exact time the image was taken. The series of positions as the asteroid moves across the sky allows the student to fit an approximate orbit to the asteroid. The measured asteroid coordinates (not the calculated orbital elements) are submitted to the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard &amp; Smithsonian.

Over the decades SSP students have done their orbit determination calculations on mechanical calculators (1960s), then electronic calculators (1970s), then &quot;mini-computers&quot; (1980s), then personal computers (1990s and 2000s). In recent years they write their orbit determination programs in the Python programming language, employing the Gaussian method.

<text>The AF107 is the European name for an early (c. 1960) germanium-based (A) bipolar junction transistor of PNP polarity intended for high frequency use (F). It shares most of its characteristics with the AF108. Both models use a non-standard round metallic housing of 9 millimetre diameter which is electrically connected to the collector. At a housing temperature of 45 °C, these transistors can handle an internal power dissipation of 0.5 watt. Unit gain (&quot;β&quot; = 1) is reached at typically 250 MHz (minimum 150 MHz).

<text>Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek (&quot;The Cornish Language Fellowship&quot;)
is a Cornish language association which exists to promote,
encourage and foster the use of the Cornish language. 

Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek recognises the validity of all forms of revived Cornish, and membership is open to all, although most of the Kowethas&#x27; publications have been in Kernewek Kemmyn and the Standard Written Form (Middle).

Kowethas an Yeth Kernewek respects the rights of its members to use whichever form of Cornish they choose, although its written business is conducted in SWF (M) because that is the form used by the majority of its members.

Every month since late 1976 the society publishes a Cornish Language magazine called &quot;An Gannas&quot; which consists of articles, stories, news, comment and puzzles. Publishing is an important aspect of the work of the society. Amongst the variety of materials that have been produced are books, diaries, stories and language learning materials. Books with accompanying audio material are also published to assist beginners. The society also produces tea-towels, mugs, car stickers, pens, cards, T-shirts and other items for sale, all displaying the Cornish language. During the year the society organises a number of language events, such as an annual Cornish Language Weekend, and a Speak Cornish week, often supported by Cornish music or dancing, giving Cornish speakers the opportunity of meeting together in a Cornish speaking environment. Recent years has seen some events conducted by videoconferencing, extending the reach of the Kowethas to overseas members.

The society is closely associated with the running of Cornish classes throughout Cornwall and beyond. It maintains links with a wide range of other cultural organisations both in Cornwall and beyond, including language and educational organisations in other Celtic countries. The society is a voluntary body, (charity no. 1065527) and its funding is raised through grants, membership, sales and donations.

He also played the role of David Sloane in three of the five installments of the original &quot;Kickboxer&quot; film franchise. Mitchell has a black belt in taekwondo.

==Personal life==
Mitchell was born on July 27, 1967, in Los Angeles, California, the son of a garment manufacturer. He is of Ukrainian Jewish descent. His ancestors came to the United States from Ukraine, Kyiv. His real family name is Muchnik. In 1990, he married Jeannette Robbins. The two had four children together before divorcing in 1997.

During Mitchell&#x27;s marriage to Robbins, police were called to the couple&#x27;s home to investigate reports of domestic abuse. In 1996, Mitchell was convicted of misdemeanor battery, spousal abuse and child endangerment stemming from an altercation with his wife. He was given three years’ probation and ordered to perform community service and attend counseling classes for spousal abusers. After violating his probation, he was sentenced to 30 days in jail. In 2002, Mitchell spoke of the incident on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, claiming that he was protecting his children from his ex-wife, who was addicted to drugs at the time of the arrests. Mitchell ended up getting custody of their four children, with his ex-wife given limited visitation.

In December 2010, Mitchell married his second wife Rachel, also known as Sharmaine Rayner. He filed for divorce in spring 2015.

<doc id="936194" wikidata="Q1591901" url="?curid=936194" title="Hayes Microcomputer Products">
<text>Hayes Microcomputer Products was a US-based manufacturer of modems. The company is known for the Smartmodem, which introduced a control language for operating the functions of the modem via the serial interface, in contrast to manual operation with front-panel switches. This &quot;smart modem&quot; approach dramatically simplified and automated operation. Today almost all modems use a variant of the Hayes AT command set.

Hayes was a major brand in the modem market from the introduction of the original 300 bit/s Smartmodem in 1981. They remained a major vendor throughout the 1980s, periodically introducing models with higher throughput. Their competition through this period was primarily from two other high-end vendors, USRobotics and Telebit, while other companies mostly sold into niches or were strictly low-end offerings.

In the early 1990s a number of greatly cost-reduced high-performance modems were released by competitors, notably the SupraFAXModem 14400 in 1992, which eroded price points in the market. Hayes was never able to respond effectively. The widespread introduction of ADSL and cable modems in the mid-1990s repeatedly drove the company in Chapter 11 protection before being liquidated in 1999.

==Before Hayes==

Dennis C. Hayes left the Georgia Institute of Technology in the mid-1970s to work at an early data communications company, National Data Corporation, a company that, among its many businesses, handled electronic money transfers and credit card authorizations. Hayes&#x27; job was to set up modem connections for NDC&#x27;s customers.

Hayes also worked for a time at Financial Data Sciences, which sold automated teller machines to the savings and loan (S&amp;L) market, modifying machines sold by larger companies to large banks with the branding of the smaller S&amp;L. From this company, he learned the value of selling into niche markets the larger players ignored.

Hayes was a computer hobbyist, and felt that modems would be highly compelling to users of the new 8-bit computers that would soon be known as home computers. However, existing modems were simply too expensive and difficult to use or be practical for most users. He felt that this market was likely to be ignored by the larger modem vendors like IBM.

==Early Hayes products==
At the time, modems generally came in two versions, external modems using an acoustic coupler for connection, and direct-connection modems used with minicomputers or mainframes. Acoustic couplers were entirely manual; the user picked up the phone&#x27;s handset, dialed manually, and then pressed the handset into the coupler if a carrier frequency was heard. Disconnecting at the end of the session was also manual, with the user lifting the handset out of the coupler and hanging it up on the phone body in order to depress the hook switch and return the phone to the on-hook state and end the call. This was a straightforward and thus a popular solution; the Novation CAT was a popular modem of this type.

Internal modems had the advantage that they could use the computer bus not only to exchange data between the computer and the modem, but command and status information as well. This allowed them to control the entire connection cycle, dialing the phone to start, and hanging up at the end. Such systems were available for large machines, especially the mainframes used by banks which had to automatically dial their branches for end-of-day updates. None of these systems were available for microcomputers, and Hayes&#x27; initial concept was to offer similar products into this market.

Hayes started producing such a system in his kitchen in April 1977 with his friend and co-worker, Dale Heatherington. Their first product was the 80-103A, a 300 bit/s Bell 103-compatible design for S-100 bus machines. At this time, it was illegal to connect any non-Bell hardware to the telephone network, so the 80-103A was designed to connect to a Bell-supplied Data Access Arrangement (DAA) which the user rented for a monthly fee. To fill in dead-times in the modem sales, they also took on part work doing electronics assembly for other companies.

Business picked up quickly, and by January 1978 they had quit their jobs at National Data to form their own company, D.C. Hayes Associates. In its first year, the new company sold $125,000 worth of product ().

Sales further improved in early 1979 with the introduction of the 300 bit/s Micromodem 100 for S-100 bus computers and the Micromodem II for the Apple II.

As a result of Bell having lost several key lawsuits related to the connection of unlicensed equipment to its telephone network, by 1978 it finally became legal to connect any FCC-approved system to the Bell network. To comply, Micromodems were supplied their own DAA-like connector in the form of the FCC-approved &quot;microcoupler&quot;: a small external box that connected to the internal modem card using a ribbon cable.

In 1980, the company changed its name to Hayes Microcomputer Products.

==The Smartmodem==

Although powerful, the internal modem was commercially impractical. Not only did it require special driver software that often meant it could only be used with a single terminal emulator, but a different hardware design was needed for every computer bus, including Apple II, S-100, TRS-80, and others. As modems became popular, users on these platforms began asking for designs as well.

A solution to the cross-platform connection was to use the RS-232 serial port instead of the internal data bus; modems were serial devices in the end, and most computers included an RS-232 port or some variant. The trick would be how to send commands over the same connection as the data. A few external modems already offered the ability to dial the phone by entering a phone number when the modem was first started, based on the idea that it could not be connected to a remote system when first powered up, so anything sent from the computer could (optionally) be interpreted as a command. The problem was sending a command to hang up, while the modem was already connected. There needed to be some way to indicate that the characters flowing out from the computer to the modem were not simply additional data to be sent to the far end, but commands to be acted on.

Hayes and the company&#x27;s marketing manager Glenn Sirkis approached Heatherington with an outline for a new command-driven external modem. Several solutions to the command problem were studied, and in the end, Heatherington decided the only practical one was to have the modem operate in two modes. In one, &quot;data mode&quot;, all data forwarded from the computer was modulated and sent over the connected telephone line as it was with any other modem. In the other, &quot;command mode&quot;, data forwarded from the computer would be interpreted as commands. In this way, the modem could be instructed by the computer to perform various operations, such as hang up the phone or dial a number. The modem would normally start-up in command mode.

The problem was how to move from mode to mode. One option would be to signal this using one of the many pins in the RS-232 cable. However, while the 25-pin connector on the modem side had more than enough pins for this purpose (even some &quot;meant&quot; for this purpose), the computer side often had far fewer pins connected and controllable, if it even used a full 25-pin connector at all. In fact, there were very few pins that were guaranteed to work on all computers, mostly the data in and out, &quot;ready&quot; indications that said whether the modem or computer was operational, and &quot;sometimes&quot; flow-control pins. While it would have been possible to use some of these pins for the sort of command-switching they needed, this may not have been universally supported across all machines.

Heatherington instead came up with the idea of using a rarely seen sequence of characters for this duty. Since these characters could be sent to the modem using the same two data pins that the port would need anyway, they could be sure that such a system would work on every computer. The sequence he decided on was (three plus signs). When this was received from the computer, the modem would switch from data to command mode. Of course, it was possible that the computer would send this sequence for other reasons, for example, the sequence is contained within the text on this page, and likely would be in any document referring to modems. In order to filter out these &quot;accidental&quot; sequences, Heatherington&#x27;s design only switched to command mode if the sequence was led and followed by a one-second pause, the &quot;guard time&quot;, in which no other data was sent. In this case it could be safely assumed that the sequence was being sent deliberately by a user, as opposed to being buried in the middle of a data stream.

With the basic idea outlined, Hayes and Sirkis gave Heatherington the go-ahead to build a prototype by adding a microcontroller to an otherwise lightly modified version of their existing 300 bit/s hardware. Sirkis was particularly interested in using the 1 MHz PIC microcontrollers, which were available for only US$1 a piece. After six months of trying to get the modem working with the PIC, Heatherington gave up and demanded they use the 8 MHz Zilog Z8 instead, a US$10 part. Sirkis acquiesced, and a working prototype was soon complete.

Hayes added a requirement of his own, that the modem be able to automatically detect what speed the computer&#x27;s serial port was set to when first powered on. This was not simple unless the modem &quot;knew&quot; what data were initially being sent, allowing it to time the bits and thereby guess the speed. Heatherington eventually suggested the use of a well-known character sequence for this purpose, recommending for &quot;attention&quot;, which is prefixed on all commands.

The new design, housed in an extruded aluminum case sized to allow a standard desktop telephone to rest on top, was announced in April 1981. It was known simply as the Smartmodem. The Smartmodem was the first modem integrating complete control over the phone line, and that allowed it to be used in exactly the same fashion with any computer.

Hayes originally had big plans for the form factor, referring to it as the Hayes Stack and intending to release a range of products that could be stacked beside the computer. In the end, only two non-modem devices were added to the line. The Hayes Stack Chronograph, an external real-time clock and the Transet 1000, a printer buffer and primitive email box. Both of these items&#x27; sales were apparently dismal. Early advertising referred to the Smartmodem as the &quot;Hayes Stack Smartmodem&quot;, but this naming convention was dropped a short time later.

At the time of its introduction, the modem market was fairly small, and competitors generally ignored the Smartmodem. But it was not long before hobbyists were able to combine the Smartmodem with new software to create the first real bulletin board systems (BBSes), which created significant market demand. The market grew rapidly in the mid-1980s, and as the Smartmodem was the only truly &quot;universal&quot; modem on the market, Hayes grew to take over much of the market. By 1982, the company was selling 140,000 modems a year, with sales of $12 million annually ().

Heatherington retired from what was then a large company in 1984.

==Competition==
The modem market in the 1970s was very simple and stagnant. Modems tended to sell at US$1 per baud. Hayes saw no need to be different—the original Hayes 300 baud modem sold for US$299 retail. At that price point, Hayes could build a &quot;Cadillac of modems&quot;, using high-quality components, an extruded aluminum case, and an acrylic front panel with a number of LED indicators. As the modem market expanded, competitors quickly copied the Hayes command set and often the Hayes industrial design as well. To compete with Hayes on price, early competitors manufactured modems using low-cost components that were often unreliable. Hayes quickly gained a reputation for high quality, and for a time held a 50% market share.

In 1982, at the Spring Comdex in Atlantic City, Hayes introduced the Bell 212-compatible Smartmodem 1200 for $699, the first practical all-in-one 1200 bit/s Bell 212-compatible modem. The earlier design was redesignated the Smartmodem 300. At the time, Hayes was one of the few modem companies with the capital and engineering wherewithal to develop entirely new modem architectures. However, this was only a limited competitive advantage, since it was not long before companies offering Hayes &quot;clones&quot; introduced derivative 1200 bit/s models of their own.

The 1200 bit/s market existed for a relatively short time; in 1984 the CCITT introduced the V.22bis standard for 2400 bit/s operation. This was the first time that the CCITT&#x27;s standard predated Bell&#x27;s introductions, avoiding compatibility issues that had plagued earlier standards. Modem companies quickly incorporated V.22bis into their product lines. Hayes was no exception; the company introduced its V.22bis Smartmodem 2400 at US$549 in 1985 (the 1200 bit/s Smartmodem also remained available at a lower price point). Competition drove prices rapidly downward, and by 1987 a clone 2400 bit/s modem was generally available for around US$250. After 1987, modems increasingly became a commodity item.

==Hayes &#x27;302==
In June 1983, Hayes and a number of other manufacturers were sent licensing demands by a smaller modem manufacturer, BizComp, who had filed a patent in 1980 but only received it in 1983. The patent covered the use of an escape sequence to switch between command and data mode, just like the Smartmodem. BizComp had already implemented the system in its modems in 1980, a year before the Smartmodem came to market. They offered a sliding scale of terms; an outright license was $2 million, but they would accept as little as $500,000 with additional per-unit fees. Hayes responded by licensing the patent outright for $2 million ().

Hayes themselves also had a patent filing working its way through the system since 1981, although it mentioned the escape system and modes only in passing. Having obtained a license, they re-wrote their patent to include a lengthy section on the idea of a guard time, which the original Bizcomp patent lacked. They received the patent, 4,549,302 &quot;Modem With Improved Escape Sequence With Guard Time Mechanism&quot;, in October 1985.

Hayes began sending bills to other manufacturers, charging 2% of the retail price per modem that followed the Hayes system, including those modems that had already been built and sold. This resulted in a number of companies launching a patent review, claiming the concept had long been used in the industry. A flurry of suits and countersuits followed. The bid to overturn the patent failed in 1986. Some time later, Hayes received permission to bring suits in federal court against infringers, and filed an initial suit against several major manufacturers, Everex, Ven-Tel, Omnitel and Prometheus Products.

Competitors derisively termed it the &quot;modem tax&quot;, and a number of manufacturers banded together and introduced the Time Independent Escape Sequence, or TIES, but it was not as robust as Heatherington&#x27;s system and never became very successful.

==Higher speeds and increased competition==
Hayes was not as fast as some other manufacturers to release modems that ran faster than 2400 bit/s, which opened the door for USRobotics (USR) and Telebit to meet market demand with faster products. Telebit was the fastest, running up to ~18,500 bit/s and maintaining higher speeds on noisy lines where other models would fall-back to lower speeds. They were also expensive and found mostly in professional settings, notably for Unix-running minicomputers for UUCP use where their protocol spoofing offered further speed improvements. USR&#x27;s designs were simpler than Telebits and ran at &quot;only&quot; 9,600 bit/s, but carved out a strong niche by offering deep discounts to sysops.

In 1987 Hayes responded with the Hayes Express 96 protocol, a 9600 bit/s protocol. It was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Ping-Pong&quot; protocol due to the way the modems could &quot;ping-pong&quot; the single high-speed link between the two ends on demand, in a fashion similar to the USR and Telebit protocols. The key improvement is that the channel could be switched very rapidly, without a renegotiation procedure. However, Express 96 both was late to market and lacked error correction, making it far less attractive than its competition. The design was generally unsuccessful, and for the first time Hayes lost cachet as the leader in modem design and manufacture.

Hayes&#x27; slow entry into the high-speed market led to a fracturing of the command set. In order to set up the modem to accept or reject certain types of connections, Hayes had added a number of new commands prefixed by (the ampersand) to the Smartmodem 2400. Other companies offering 2400 bit/s generally followed the same syntax. When Hayes moved to the Smartmodem 9600, they extended the set further, using the same syntax. However, by this time the other companies involved had introduced their own syntax; USR used an incompatible set of -prefixed commands, Microcom used , and Telebit was based on setting a series of registers. All of these survived for some time into the early 1990s.

Through the late 1980s and early 1990s, new standard high-speed modes were introduced by the CCITT. The first of these, V.32, offered 9600 bit/s in both directions at the same time, whereas earlier high-speed protocols were high-speed in one direction only. In 1988 Hayes effectively abandoned their Express 96 protocol in favor of V.32, which along with MNP support was built into the US$1199 Hayes V-series Smartmodem 9600. In 1990 the company introduced the Smartmodem Ultra 96, which offered both V.32 and Express 96 support, and added the new V.42bis error correction and compression system (in addition to MNP). V.32 modems remained fairly rare and expensive, although by 1990 third-party V.32 modems were available for approximately US$600.

==V.32bis==
Almost immediately after the introduction of V.32, the CCITT began the process of standardizing a slightly faster variant, the 14,400 bit/s V.32bis. During previous speed bumps, the large companies like Hayes and USR were generally the first to respond with new models.

Not so in this case; shortly after V.32bis was ratified in 1991, Rockwell introduced a low-cost chipset supporting the new standard, along with similar V.32 and V.22bis (2400 bit/s) versions, all of which supported MNP, V.42bis and, optionally, 9600 bit/s V.29 fax modem capabilities. Their system was introduced commercially in the SupraFAXModem 14400, which went on to become a runaway bestseller. Soon there were hundreds of similar models on the market, and Rockwell&#x27;s competitors also rushed in with similar chipsets of their own.

Hayes was never able to re-establish itself as a market leader through this period. In the fall of 1991 they introduced the US$799 Smartmodem Ultra 144 which also supported Express 96, but by this point, Express 96 had little cachet and the market was already flooded with lower-cost modems. They then split their line into the Accura and Optima brands, offering the Accura as a low-cost model, although the feature sets were not that different between the two lines. Hayes eventually purchased two of their competitors, Practical Peripherals and Cardinal Technologies, turning them into low-cost brands in order to compete with a flood of companies like Supra Corporation and Zoom Telephonics.

As speeds increased with the introduction of V.34 and V.90, Hayes increasingly became a follower rather than a leader. By the mid-1990s their modems were also based on the Rockwell chipset and had little to distinguish themselves from other vendors.

Oddly it was the Rockwell chipset that also re-standardized the various command sets back on the original high-speed ones introduced by Hayes. As the Rockwell-based systems became more and more common, other companies, like AT&amp;T, introduced new versions of their modem chip sets with identical commands. Rockwell had taken their commands from the V-series Smartmodems, so by the mid-90s the market was once again based largely on a &quot;real&quot; Hayes command set.

==Decline and fall==
Hayes realized that changes in the telephone networks would eventually render the modem, in its current form, obsolete. As early as 1985 he started efforts to produce consumer-ready ISDN &quot;modems&quot;, betting the company on ISDN becoming a widespread standard—which was widely believed at the time. By the early 1990s, this was a major focus of the company.

However, unlike parts of Europe (mainly Germany) or Japan, ISDN simply never happened in the US consumer market. The whole model was based on end-to-end digital communications, and was thus limited to the speed of the long-distance carrier lines, either 56 or 64 kbit/s. The Bell companies were interested in deploying ISDN, but doing so required customer-end installations to make their conventional telephones work, which made the system unattractive for wide-scale deployment.

Additionally, the rise of the Internet in the mid-1990s made point-to-point communications far less interesting. After dialing their local Internet service provider, the user could &quot;call out&quot; at high speed to services around the world, so the need for long-distance data calls was generally eliminated. As a result of this shift, there was no real need to limit the user to the speed of the long-distance lines, giving the Bell companies flexibility in terms of what to install at the user&#x27;s site. Their attention turned to Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL), which ran over the existing wiring and did not block a telephone connection in the process. The end-user was offered much higher speeds while still being able to use existing phones, with the added &quot;benefit&quot; of helping tie the user to the telephone company&#x27;s own ISP.

Hayes, having bet the company on a system that was never actually deployed, had no new products in the pipeline. In an attempt at diversification in January 1991 it had acquired most of the assets of local area network software developer Waterloo Microsystems Inc of Waterloo, Ontario and belatedly entered the operating system (OS) market in June 1991 with LANstep, a network OS for small offices, but this was subsequently abandoned in 1994 in the face of stiff competition particularly from Novell NetWare. An effort was started to move into the market for ADSL and cable modems, but this was a multi-year effort during a period when USR increasingly took over what remained of the high-end modem market.

They entered Chapter 11 protection in November 1994, exiting in October 1995 as Hayes Corp. after selling 49% of the company to Nortel and a Singapore-based venture capital firm. In 1997 they merged with Access Beyond, a builder of ISP rack-mount modems and terminal servers, and changed the company name again, this time to Hayes Communications. The merger was primarily a way to take the company public. The stock started crashing over the next year, from around US$12 in early 1998 to pennies in October, when they once again filed for Chapter 11 protection. No new funding could be found, and in 1999 the company assets were liquidated.

The brand name was purchased and revived by onetime rival Zoom Telephonics in July 1999. Zoom continues to use the Hayes name on some of their products.

<doc id="936196" wikidata="Q786279" url="?curid=936196" title="The Wizard (1989 film)">
<text>The Wizard is a 1989 American adventure comedy-drama film directed by Todd Holland (in his directorial debut), written by David Chisholm, and starring Fred Savage, Jenny Lewis, Beau Bridges, Christian Slater, and Luke Edwards. It was also Tobey Maguire&#x27;s uncredited film debut.

The film follows three children, the youngest of whom is emotionally withdrawn but gifted at playing video games, as they travel to California to compete in a video game tournament. Known for its extensive product placement of Nintendo material, it also officially introduced &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; to North America, which then became the best-selling standalone video game. Despite receiving generally negative reviews upon its initial release, the film has garnered a cult following.

==Plot==
9-year-old Jimmy Woods lives with PTSD after his twin sister, Jennifer, drowned two years earlier. Prone to randomly wandering away from home, he perpetually carries around a lunchbox while frequently repeating the word &quot;California&quot;.

Jennifer&#x27;s death caused Jimmy&#x27;s family to split: he lives with his mother Christine and stepfather Mr. Bateman while his older half-brothers Nick and Corey live with their father Sam. Exasperated by Jimmy&#x27;s behavior, Christine and Mr. Bateman decide to commit Jimmy to an institution. Unwilling to allow it, Corey sneaks Jimmy out and they start traveling on foot for Los Angeles. Nick and Sam resolve to bring the boys back while competing with Mr. Putnam, a greedy bounty hunter hired by Mr. Bateman and Christine to find Jimmy but not Corey.

At a bus station, Jimmy and Corey meet Haley Brooks, a teenager on her way home to Reno. When they discover that Jimmy is innately talented at playing video games, Haley informs Corey of &quot;Video Armageddon&quot;, a gaming tournament being held at Universal Studios Hollywood, with a grand prize of $50,000. Corey sees the tournament as an opportunity to avert Jimmy&#x27;s institutionalization by showcasing his talent, and Haley agrees to help take Jimmy there in return for a share of the winnings.

The trio hitchhike cross-country, using Jimmy&#x27;s skills to win bets on games. They eventually meet popular but snobbish gamer Lucas Barton, who demonstrates his ability to play &quot;Rad Racer&quot; with a Power Glove and informs Haley he will also be competing. Corey and Haley learn that Jimmy&#x27;s lunchbox contains photos and mementos of Jennifer.

The trio arrive in Reno, gaining more money with help from Haley&#x27;s trucker friend Spanky whom Haley coaches to success at a casino&#x27;s craps table. Jimmy then begins training on arcade machines with help from the Nintendo Power Line. The children escape from Putnam to Haley&#x27;s trailer where she reveals she wants her share of the prize money to help her father buy a proper house. Putnam finds Haley&#x27;s trailer and captures Jimmy, but Haley summons several truckers who barricade Putnam on the road and rescue Jimmy.

After Spanky drives the children to the tournament, Jimmy enters and becomes a finalist after playing &quot;Ninja Gaiden&quot;. In between rounds, Putnam unsuccessfully reattempts to apprehend the children. Jimmy, Lucas, and third finalist Mora Grissom compete in the tournament&#x27;s final round – they have 10 minutes to score as many points as possible in &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, a brand-new game not yet released in the United States. Cheered on by his family, Haley, and even Putnam, Jimmy wins at the last second, becoming the tournament champion and earning the cash prize.

As the entire family heads home, accompanied by Haley, Jimmy suddenly becomes restless upon spotting the Cabazon Dinosaurs, causing them to stop the car. They follow him inside, and Corey finds Jimmy looking at his photos of the family, one of which was taken at the tourist trap. They realize that Jimmy only sought closure where Jennifer was happy. Jimmy leaves his lunchbox at the site and the family resumes the car trip. Jimmy kisses Haley, who laughs along with Corey in the back of the truck as they ride off into the sunset.

==Cast==

In addition, Tobey Maguire has his first film role, an uncredited part as Lucas&#x27;s Goon at &quot;Video Armageddon&quot;.

==Production==
During 1988, a shortage of ROM chips and the preparation of a version of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 2&quot; for the west delayed several of Nintendo&#x27;s game releases in North America. One such product was &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;. The delay presented Nintendo with an opportunity to promote the game in a feature film. In 1989, Tom Pollack of Universal Studios approached Nintendo of America&#x27;s marketing department about a video game film; inspired by Nintendo video game competitions, Pollack envisioned a video game version of &quot;Tommy&quot; for younger audiences. Nintendo licensed its products for inclusion in the film. During production, the filmmakers were granted approval from Nintendo regarding the script and portrayal of its games. &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; was one of the products shown in the film and was used in a final scene involving a video game competition. Despite the film touting itself as featuring the first public reveal of &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;, the game had already been released in Japan during the previous year, with U.S. magazines such as &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot; having already covered the Japanese version.

Filming took place between June 5 and July 25, 1989. In a 2008 reunion, as well in an interview in 2014, Todd Holland revealed that the original cut of the film was 2.5 hours long and included an extended backstory for Jimmy and Corey.

In an interview with &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, director Holland admitted that he had some issues with the final script: &quot;I argued with the studio that we were shooting way too much footage – more than we could ever possibly use [...] I lost the argument and was told flat out by Universal to shoot the entire script&quot;. According to Holland, the original cut of the film was over 2.5 hours long and that nearly an hour of footage needed to be deleted in order to make the film a suitable length for family viewing. The deleted material was finally released in 2020 on the collector&#x27;s edition Blu-ray of the film. Most of the deleted footage comes from the original cut of the opening act which explores Corey&#x27;s home life in more detail, including deliberately antagonizing his older brother, his mother&#x27;s emotional issues surrounding Jimmy and her divide from her former family. Nick&#x27;s alcoholism is also explored in more detail as well as additional clips from the road trip scenes. Trucker Spanky gets more screen time in the deleted scenes also, explaining his role in more detail, and there are more clips from the final Video Game Armageddon contest.

==Release==

===Box office===
&quot;The Wizard&quot; debuted at No. 5, earning $2,142,525 in the domestic box office. At the end of its run, the film had grossed $14,278,900. Based on an estimated $6 million budget, the film was a moderate box office success, after which it became a cult film.

===Critical reception===
The film received negative reviews from critics. Multiple newspaper critics labeled it a feature-length commercial for Universal Studios Hollywood and Nintendo. Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; called the film &quot;a cynical exploitation film with a lot of commercial plugs&quot; and &quot;insanely overwritten and ineptly filmed&quot;. He later called it one of the worst films of 1989. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; staff writer Rita Kempley wrote that the movie was &quot;tacky and moribund&quot;, plagiarizing heavily from the 1988 film &quot;Rain Man&quot;. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a 29% score, based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 4.5/10. On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 23 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating &quot;generally unfavorable reviews&quot;.

David Sheff, in the book &quot;Game Over&quot; (1993), called it &quot;less a piece of art than a one-hundred-minute advertisement for Nintendo that millions of families paid to see&quot; especially for &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot;. Levi Buchanan of &quot;IGN&quot;, in 2012, called it a &quot;90-minute &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; commercial&quot;.

Despite the negative reviews, the film was still popular enough to achieve cult film status and to receive a reunion screening from &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Cool News&quot; at the Alamo Drafthouse Ritz in Austin, Texas, on February 8, 2008. Director Holland and stars Savage and Edwards were in attendance to take questions from fans.

==Home media==
&quot;The Wizard&quot; was released on VHS and LaserDisc three times, in 1990, in 1992, and in 1997. By 1993, &quot;The Wizard&quot; grossed in video rentals.

It was first released on DVD in Region 2 on February 2, 2001 and finally in the US and Canada (Region 1) on August 22, 2006. The Blu-ray version was released on May 15, 2018, and a special edition Blu-ray was released by Shout! Factory on March 24, 2020, with a new 4K remaster, audio commentary with director Todd Holland, never-before-seen deleted scenes, and more.

==Legacy==
On September 6, 2016, Pax West 2016 concluded with a replica of the &quot;Super Mario Bros. 3&quot; tournament from the film.

<text>Gillian McKeith (born 28 September 1959) is a Scottish television personality and writer. She is known for her promotion of various pseudoscientific ideas about health and nutrition. She is the former host of Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;You Are What You Eat&quot; (2004–2006), Granada Television&#x27;s &quot;Dr Gillian McKeith&#x27;s Feel Fab Forever&quot; (2009–2010), and W Network&#x27;s &quot;Eat Yourself Sexy&quot; (2010). In 2008, McKeith regularly appeared on the E4 health show &quot;Supersize vs Superskinny&quot;, and in 2010, she was a contestant on the tenth series of the ITV show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;

Numerous practices supported by McKeith are pseudoscience not supported by scientific research, such as the detox diet, colonic irrigation, and her claims that examining the tongue and stool samples can be used to identify ailments and dietary needs. McKeith has no qualifications in nutrition or medicine from accredited institutions, and in 2007 agreed with the Advertising Standards Authority to stop using the title &quot;Doctor&quot;.

McKeith has written several books about nutrition, including &quot;You Are What You Eat&quot; (2004), which sold more than two million copies, and &quot;Dr Gillian McKeith&#x27;s Ultimate Health Plan&quot; (2006). The validity of her approach and the safety of her recommendations have been strongly criticised by health professionals. She faced criticism during the COVID-19 pandemic for promoting COVID-19 misinformation and anti-vaccine views, and was described as a conspiracy theorist.

==Early life and education==
McKeith was born in Perth, Scotland, and grew up on a council estate. Her father, Robert, was a shipyard worker and her mother an office worker. She has said that she was raised eating the junk food she now advises against: &quot;We all know the kind of food I grew up with—a typical Scottish diet. We&#x27;d have meat three times a day. I certainly never ate a mango, and had no idea what macrobiotic meant.&quot; Her father was a long-term smoker and died of cancer of the oesophagus in 2005.

She obtained a degree in linguistics from the University of Edinburgh in 1981, before moving to the United States, where she worked in marketing and international business. In 1984, she received an MA in international relations from the University of Pennsylvania. She claims to have received an MA in holistic nutrition in 1994 and a PhD in that same field in 1997, both via distance-learning programmes from the non-accredited American Holistic College of Nutrition, later the Clayton College of Natural Health in Birmingham, Alabama, since closed. She is a member of the American Association of Nutritional Consultants, but this association runs no checks on the qualifications of its members; this allowed British physician Ben Goldacre to register his dead cat for the same membership held by McKeith. 

In February 2007, she agreed to stop using the academic title &quot;Doctor&quot; in advertisements, after a complaint to the UK&#x27;s Advertising Standards Authority. Responding to criticism that her use of her qualifications in linguistics and language and international relations, subjects entirely unrelated to diet and nutrition, are misleading to the public, McKeith said she was challenging orthodox medical opinions. She rejected the claim that using the title to promote her theories on nutrition was unethical.

McKeith and her husband have alleged defamation but failed to initiate threatened legal action against critics. Ben Goldacre speculated that parts of her PhD thesis may have been published as a 48-page pamphlet entitled &quot;Miracle Superfood: Wild Blue-Green Algae&quot;; he called the pamphlet cargo cult science, describing it as full of &quot;anecdote, but no data.&quot; In his book &quot;Bad Science&quot; (2008) Goldacre dedicates a chapter to an analysis of her scientific credibility. In July 2010, on Twitter, McKeith described Goldacre&#x27;s book as &quot;lies&quot;; Goldacre requested a correction.

==Career==
According to her Channel 4 biography, McKeith was celebrity health reporter for the Joan Rivers show, and when McKeith first moved to the United States she co-presented a syndicated radio show called &quot;Healthline Across America&quot;.

Prior to the 2002 United Kingdom local elections, McKeith applied to become a Conservative Party candidate in the London Borough of Camden. It was said that McKeith wished to become a councillor so that she could be the MP for Hampstead (then part of the Hampstead and Highgate constituency). However, McKeith withdrew her application a few weeks later, and did not stand at the 2002 Camden elections.

===&quot;You Are What You Eat&quot;===

Her book &quot;You Are What You Eat&quot; had sold over two million copies by 2006, and was the most borrowed non-fiction library book in the UK between July 2005 and June 2006. The book derived from the Channel 4 show she presented, &quot;You Are What You Eat&quot;, broadcast until 2007, in which she attempted to motivate people to lose weight and change their lifestyle. Ian Marber, a nutritionist, described her in 2006 as fervent in her beliefs and considers herself a sort of health televangelist. In each episode of the fourth series, called &quot;Gillian Moves In: You Are What You Eat&quot;, two people were chosen to stay with McKeith at a house in London &quot;with no escape&quot;. She first showed each of the subjects their typical week&#x27;s food consumption. The food was laid out on a table in a cold, congealed and unpleasant state. The subjects were often shown emptying the display into refuse sacks. According to Jan Moir in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, she was seen &quot;shouting at sobbing, fat women while forcing them to eat quinoa and undergo frequent sessions of colonic irrigation enthusiastically administered by her good self.&quot; She then offered advice on diet and exercise, and forbade alcohol. Once trained, the participants were able to return home, and were expected to stick to their new regime for eight weeks. If they failed to stick to it, McKeith moved in with them to make sure they followed her advice. The participants were shown at the end of the eight weeks to have lost body mass, and said they felt healthier.

She often attributed some of the featured clients&#x27; health problems to a vitamin or mineral deficiency. There are certain foods she considered to be particularly nutritious, and these were often mentioned in her programmes. These can be unusual foods, some of which are available only from health food shops or from McKeith&#x27;s own range of products. A spokesperson for Celador, the television production company responsible for McKeith&#x27;s series, said that the criticism of her is reflective of her rejection of traditionalist approaches to nutrition: &quot;You have to realise that when someone takes a holistic approach, there is always going to be an old school of traditionalists who are going to be sceptical and besmirch that. That&#x27;s what&#x27;s going on.&quot;

===Diagnostic techniques===
In her book &quot;You Are What You Eat&quot;, McKeith advocates examination of the tongue, the mapping of pimples, and detailed scrutiny of faecal matter and urine as indicators of health. She asserts that many exterior parts of the body provide insight into illness: &quot;I always think of the tongue as being like a window to the organs. The extreme tip correlates to the heart, the bit slightly behind is the lungs. The right side shows what the gallbladder is up to and the left side the liver. The middle indicates the condition of your stomach and spleen, the back the kidneys, intestines and womb.&quot; These claims have no scientific basis.

She assesses people&#x27;s nutritional needs based on the appearance of their nails, hair, lips, and skin. She also attributes the presence of depression or PMS to mineral deficiencies, and maintains that the location of pimples can suggest the source of health problems. McKeith also argues that the appearance, smell and consistency of faeces can give clues to bodily malfunction. She frequently took up this practice during her television shows, a technique that led Ben Goldacre, a physician who wrote for &quot;The Guardian&quot; at the time, to dub her &quot;the awful poo lady&quot;.

===Nutritional advice===
McKeith&#x27;s advice is primarily alternative medicine without any scientific basis. She recommends a detox diet in which the &quot;top 12 toxic terrors to avoid&quot; are: smoking; caffeine; alcohol; chocolate and sweet snacks; pub snacks such as crisps, nuts, and pork scratchings; processed meat; white bread, white pasta, white rice; products containing added sugar; takeaways and ready meals; table salt; saturated fats; and fizzy drinks. McKeith advocates a pescetarian—sea foods—diet high in fruits and vegetables, grains, beans, nuts, and tofu, and the avoidance of processed and high-calorie foods, sugar and fat, red meat, alcohol, caffeine, white flour, and additives. 

Goldacre writes that he finds it offensive that the British media is &quot;filled with people who adopt a cloak of scientific authority while apparently misunderstanding the most basic aspects of biology.&quot; He offers as an example McKeith&#x27;s recommendation to eat darker leaves because they are rich in chlorophyll, writing that her claim that it will &quot;really oxygenate your blood&quot; is erroneous as sunlight usually is absent inside the human bowel. McKeith&#x27;s advice in her book &quot;Miracle Superfood: Wild Blue-Green Algae&quot; is also disputed. Jan Krokowski of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency wrote a letter to &quot;New Scientist&quot;, as a private individual, saying &quot;blue-green algae—properly called cyanobacteria—are able to produce a range of very powerful toxins, which pose health hazards to humans and animals and can result in illness and death.&quot; In response to the criticism, McKeith argues: &quot;I am on a crusade to change the nation and fortunately, or unfortunately, that is going to put me in the limelight. But you cannot have change without a bit of resistance.&quot;

===Products===

McKeith&#x27;s website sells books, advice, club membership, food (e.g. goji berries, hemp seeds, &quot;Living Food Energy Powder&quot;, &quot;Immune Defence&quot; pills, weight loss pills, &quot;Raw and unprocessed wild blue green algae&quot;, etc.), and accessory equipment (blender, juicers, sprouters, and a mini-trampoline). She was censured in November 2006 by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) for selling unproven herbal sex aids. The products, &quot;Fast Formula Wild Pink Yam Complex&quot; and &quot;Fast Formula Horny Goat Weed Complex&quot; were both advertised as having been shown, in a controlled study, to promote sexual satisfaction. The MHRA found McKeith had been &quot;selling goods without legal authorisation whilst making medicinal claims about their efficacy.&quot; The products have since been withdrawn. McKeith&#x27;s website suggested the sex aids had been withdrawn because of European Union regulations. Goldacre contacted the MHRA, who said the removal had nothing to do with any EU regulations.

===Other television===
In 2007, McKeith presented &quot;Three Fat Brides, One Thin Dress&quot; for Channel 4, a competitive version of the &quot;You Are What You Eat&quot; format in which three women compete for a designer wedding dress. In addition to presenting her own TV shows, she occasionally appears in other programmes. She competed in &quot;The X Factor: Battle of the Stars&quot;, singing her rendition of &quot;The Shoop Shoop Song&quot;. She also appeared in a health show transmitted on E4 called &quot;Supersize vs Superskinny&quot;. In 2009, she appeared on the W Network in Canada on &quot;Eat Yourself Sexy&quot;, in which participants claimed to have a diminished sense of sex appeal or sex drive, with McKeith employing the same practices as in &quot;You Are What You Eat&quot;. In November 2010, she became a contestant on the UK version of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. In January 2016, McKeith appeared on &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; as a short-term housemate, sent in to &#x27;detox&#x27; the contestants. In 2023, she appeared in &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity... South Africa&quot;, once again causing controversy with contraband smuggled into camp in her &quot;spicy knickers&quot;.

===COVID-19 misinformation and conspiracy theories===
During the COVID-19 pandemic, McKeith opposed lockdowns and promoted anti-vaccination and COVID-19 conspiracy theories. She expressed her belief in a conspiracy of impending &quot;martial law&quot; and &quot;fascist tyranny&quot;. She urged followers to refuse vaccines, referring to them as &quot;clotshots&quot;, and instead suggested without evidence that nutrition could provide immunity against infection, prompting criticism from the British Nutrition Foundation and British Dietetic Association. In May 2021 she took part in an anti-vaccine protest at the Westfield shopping centre in, London. She spoke at another protest in July 2021 alongside the conspiracy theorists David Icke and Piers Corbyn and again at a London protest that December. In November 2021 she posted on Twitter implying that the sperm of vaccinated men was inferior, with no medical basis.

==Personal life==

McKeith met her husband, the American lawyer Howard Magaziner, in Edinburgh, where he was spending a year studying. At the time he ran a chain of health food shops in the United States, with which she became involved. The couple now live in London and have two daughters. McKeith suffers from scoliosis, and has said there is not a moment in her life when she is not in pain because of it.

<text>Llwynypia () is a village and community (and electoral ward) in Rhondda Cynon Taf, Wales, near Tonypandy in the Rhondda Fawr Valley. Before 1850 a lightly populated rural farming area, Llwynypia experienced a population boom between 1860 and 1920 with the sinking of several coal mines after the discovery of large coal deposits throughout the Rhondda Valleys.

The Welsh name means &quot;the grove of the Magpie&quot; or &quot;Magpie&#x27;s Bush&quot; and was taken from the name of a farm that once existed in the area.

==Early history==
Situated on the River Rhondda Fawr where the river changes direction from south-east to southerly, Llwynypia holds evidence of human habitation from the Bronze Age through to modern times. On Mynydd y Gelli, a hill overlooking the area to the west, lies the Iron Age settlement of Hen Dre&#x27;r Gelli, a site which also has several Bronze Age cairns.


In 1850 the first mine was sunk in the upper Rhondda in Treherbert but it was not until 1859 that Isaac Smith, manager of the Church Colliery, first attempted to prospect the area for coal when he opened a small level beneath Llwynypia Farm. After encountering numerous problems, Smith abandoned the level but in 1862 another entrepreneur, the Scottish mining engineer Archibald Hood, leased land at Llwynypia and sank the Llwynypia No. 1 pit in 1863. Although facing many difficulties at the No. 1 pit, Hood continued in his endeavours and by 1873 had sunk 4 more pits, now under the name of the Glamorgan Coal Company. Hood was a popular figure in the area and his mines became known as the &#x27;Scotch mines&#x27;, after Hood himself and the number of Scottish miners who followed him to live and work in Llwynypia. After Hood&#x27;s death in 1902, he received many tributes from his workforce, and in 1906 a statue of him was unveiled by Rhondda MP William Abraham outside the Llwynypia Miners&#x27; institute. Much of the cost of the statue was met by donations from the miners of his pits.

In 1908 the Glamorgan Colliery became part of the Cambrian Combine Company and, in 1910–1911, was a scene of violent clashes during the Tonypandy riots.

The very high quality of Rhondda coal was recognised by the Admiralty which specified it as the fuel of choice for the steam ships of the Royal Navy from the late 19th century. The Llwynypia pits were extracting excellent coking coals and, by the time of World War I, the village housed around 140 coke ovens. By-products of the coke distillation process was used to light the mines and the narrow streets of miners&#x27; cottages known as &quot;terraces&quot;. Some of the terraces have been widened but others remain so narrow that a single car can barely pass through.

On 25 January 1932, a gas explosion occurred at the colliery. Eleven workers were killed in the incident, two of whom were members of the rescue party. All perished after inhaling afterdamp following the explosion.

By 1936, of the original six pits opened at the Glamorgan, two remained in operation, employing only 560 workers, as against 2904 employed in 1923. The colliery was eventually closed in August 1945.

==Notable buildings==
Built in the early 1900s on the site of the Glyncornel farm, owned by the DeWinton family, Hen Glyncornel is one of the most imposing houses in the village. Built by Archibald Hood for his son William, this building was then surpassed by nearby Glyncornel House which was built by the Cambrian Coal Combine for senior management, but was turned into a maternity hospital in 1939 by Rhondda Borough Council.

Llwynypia was also home to the largest hospital in the Rhondda. The old Llwynypia Hospital was built in 1903, originally as a workhouse, later becoming a general hospital. As the only village with maternity facilities in the Rhondda, most residents from the area over the last century have Llwynypia as their place of birth on their birth certificates. Llwynypia Hospital&#x27;s accident and emergency unit was closed in the 1990s and the hospital closed completely in January 2010. It has been replaced by the new Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda.

Llwynypia Colliery Engine House (the Demon) Llwynypia Road, opposite Asda. Grade 2 listed building which was part of the Glamorgan colliery and known as the Scotch. The Engine house was the centre of the Tonypandy Riots in 1910 due to the colliery reliance on the building for power generation.

==Governance==
The Llwyn-y-pia electoral ward is coterminous with the borders of the Llwynypia community and elects one county councillor to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council. Since 1995 representation has mainly been by the Labour Party but the ward had a Plaid Cymru councillor from 1999 to 2004.

A 2018 review of electoral arrangements by the Local Democracy and Boundary Commission for Wales would see Llwyn-y-pia merged with neighbouring Trealaw. The proposals would take effect from the 2022 council elections.

==Transport==
The Llwynypia railway station is served and operated by Transport for Wales on the Rhondda Line from Cardiff.

==Education ==
One of the four main campuses of Coleg y Cymoedd is in Llwynypia.

==Sport and leisure==
Llwynypia was once home to Llwynypia Rugby Football Club. The club played in the Glamorgan leagues and was affiliated to the Welsh Rugby Union providing many trialists and Welsh international rugby union players, for instance in 1900 when the Wales team that beat England at Gloucester included Hellings and Llewelyn, both of the Llwynypia club. The club disbanded in the 1930s during the depression like many Rhondda clubs, but unlike teams such as Treherbert, did not recover.

Welsh international footballer Rob Page was born in the village.

Llwynypia is the spiritual home of Field Archery in the UK. The Glyncornel Field Archery Centre became the home of Pentref Bowmen in 1967. The Club hosted the All British &amp; Open Field Archery Championships for the first 25 years from its inception in 1967. It now hosts the national championships on a rotational basis with other UK venues.

The Field Archery World Championships were held at Glyncornel in September 1970. A clubhouse was built for the event and is still used for year-round indoor shooting.

The World Championships returned 38 years later when Llwynypia held the qualification rounds of the 2008 World Field Archery Championships.

<text>Colonel Atilla Altıkat was the Turkish military attaché to the Turkish Embassy in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, and was assassinated in 1982. The Armenian militant group ASALA claimed responsibility for the attack. The act was forcefully condemned by the Prime Minister of Canada, Pierre Trudeau.

== Assassination ==
Before being assigned to Ottawa in 1981, Altıkat had been an officer in the Turkish Air Force. He was married and had two teenage children. Altıkat was killed on his way to work at around 9:00 a.m. on August 27, 1982. When his car stopped for a red light on the Kichi Zibi Mikan at Island Park Drive, a car stopped nearby, a passenger got out and fired nine shots from a 9mm Browning handgun through the passenger window of the car, killing the diplomat instantly.

== Other assassinations ==
The attack was one in a series of attacks on Turkish diplomats around the world. On April 8, 1982, the Turkish Commercial Counsellor in Ottawa, Kani Güngör, had been seriously injured in a failed assassination attempt. Two years later, a group of Armenian guerrillas attacked the Turkish Embassy in Ottawa, killing a Canadian security officer and seriously injuring the ambassador. While those responsible for the other two attacks were caught and prosecuted, the killing of Altıkat remains unsolved, despite the offer of a $100,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.

== Memorial ==
A monument was inaugurated, on 20 September 2012, to the memory of Col. Altıkat, in Ottawa. The inauguration ceremony was attended by his widow and two children, as well as the Foreign Ministers of Turkey and Canada, Ahmet Davutoğlu and John Baird, respectively.

<text>A fried brain sandwich is a sandwich of sliced calves&#x27; brains on sliced bread.

Thinly sliced fried slabs on white toast became widespread on menus in St. Louis, Missouri, after the rise of the city&#x27;s stockyards in the late 1880s, although demand there has so dwindled that only a handful of restaurants still offer them. They remain popular in the Ohio River valley, where they are served heavily battered on hamburger buns. In Evansville, Indiana, they are still offered at several &quot;mom and pop&quot; eateries.

==Replacement with pig&#x27;s brains==
Brains from cows over 30 months old at slaughter are no longer permitted to be sold for human consumption in the United States. Some restaurants have taken to serving pigs&#x27; brains instead of cows&#x27; brains due to concerns regarding bovine spongiform encephalopathy, commonly known as &quot;mad cow disease&quot;. Because pigs&#x27; brains are substantially smaller than cows&#x27; brains, the amount required for each sandwich increases. Each brain must be cleaned before being sliced and pigs&#x27; brains produce fewer slices.

<doc id="936234" wikidata="Q1194282" url="?curid=936234" title="The Sea Hawk (1940 film)">
<text>The Sea Hawk is a 1940 American adventure film from Warner Bros. that stars Errol Flynn as an English privateer who defends his nation&#x27;s interests on the eve of the launch of the Spanish Armada. The film was the tenth collaboration between Flynn and director Michael Curtiz. Its screenplay was written by Howard Koch and Seton I. Miller. The rousing musical score by Erich Wolfgang Korngold is recognized as a high point in his career.

The film was both an adventure film and a period piece about Elizabethan England&#x27;s struggles with Spain, but it was also meant as a pro-British propaganda film to build morale during World War II and to influence the American public into having a more pro-British outlook.

==Plot==
King Philip II of Spain declares his intention to destroy England as a first step to world conquest, eager to make his empire reach from Northern Europe to China and India. He sends Don Álvarez as his ambassador to allay the suspicions of Queen Elizabeth I about the great armada he is building to invade England. In England, some of the queen&#x27;s ministers plead with her to build a fleet, which she hesitates to do in order to spare the purses of her subjects.

The ambassador&#x27;s ship is captured en route to England by the &quot;Albatross&quot; and her captain, Geoffrey Thorpe. Don Álvarez and his niece Doña María are taken aboard and transported to England. Thorpe immediately is enchanted by Doña María and gallantly returns her plundered jewels. Her detestation of him softens as she too begins to fall in love.

Don Álvarez is granted an audience with the queen and complains about his treatment; Doña María is accepted as one of her maids of honour. The &quot;Sea Hawks&quot;, a group of English privateers who raid Spanish merchant shipping, appear before the queen, who scolds them (at least publicly) for their activities and for endangering the peace with Spain. Captain Thorpe proposes in private a plan to seize a Spanish treasure fleet coming back from Spain&#x27;s colonies in the Americas. The queen is wary of Spain&#x27;s reaction, but allows Thorpe to proceed.

Suspicious, Lord Wolfingham, one of the queen&#x27;s ministers and a secret Spanish collaborator, sends a spy to try to discover where the &quot;Albatross&quot; is really heading. Upon visiting the chartmaker responsible for drawing the charts for Thorpe&#x27;s next voyage, Don Álvarez and Lord Wolfingham determine that he is sailing to the Isthmus of Panama and order the captain of Don Álvarez&#x27;s ship to sail ahead to set up an ambush.

When the &quot;Albatross&quot; reaches its destination, the ship is spotted. Thorpe&#x27;s crew seizes the caravan, but fall into a well-laid trap and are driven into the swamps. Thorpe and a few other survivors return to their ship, only to find it in Spanish hands. They are taken to Spain, tried by the Inquisition, and sentenced to life imprisonment as galley slaves. In England, Don Álvarez informs the queen of Thorpe&#x27;s fate, causing his niece to faint. The queen expels him from her court.

On a Spanish galley, Thorpe meets an Englishman named Abbott who was captured trying to uncover evidence of the Armada&#x27;s true purpose. The prisoners manage to take over the ship during the night. They board another ship in the harbor, where an emissary has stored secret incriminating plans. Thorpe and his men sail both ships back to England with the plans.

Upon reaching port, Thorpe tries to warn the queen. A carriage bringing Don Álvarez to the ship which, unknown to him, Thorpe has captured, also brings his niece. Don Álvarez boards the ship and is held prisoner, while Captain Thorpe, dressed in the uniform of a Spanish courtier, sneaks into the carriage carrying Doña María, who has decided to stay in England and wait for Thorpe&#x27;s return. The two finally declare their love for each other, and María helps Thorpe to sneak into the palace. However, Lord Wolfingham&#x27;s spy spots Thorpe and alerts the castle guards to stop the carriage and take Thorpe prisoner. Thorpe escapes and enters the queen&#x27;s residence, fending off guards all the while.

Eventually, Thorpe runs into Lord Wolfingham and kills the traitor in a swordfight. With Doña María&#x27;s assistance, Thorpe reaches the queen and provides proof of King Philip&#x27;s intentions. Elizabeth knights Thorpe and declares her intention to build a great fleet to oppose the Spanish threat.

==Production==
The portions of the film set in the Americas are tinted sepia.

The film was announced in June 1936 and would star Errol Flynn, then coming off his success with &quot;Captain Blood&quot;.

Originally planned as an adaptation of Rafael Sabatini&#x27;s 1915 novel &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot;, the film used an entirely different story inspired by the exploits of Sir Francis Drake, unlike the 1924 silent film adaptation, which was fairly faithful to Sabatini&#x27;s plot (which, in turn, was very similar to the plot of &quot;Captain Blood&quot;).

Adaptations of the novel were written by Richard Neville and Delmer Daves before Seton I. Miller wrote a basically new story titled &quot;Beggars of the Sea&quot; based on Sir Francis Drake. Sabatini&#x27;s name was still used in promotional materials however as it was felt it had commercial value. Howard Koch then reworked Miller&#x27;s script while still keeping the basic structure and story.

==Music==
The music was written by composer Erich Wolfgang Korngold. When &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; opened in theatres, a commercial recording was not contemplated. It was not until 1962 that a bit of music from the film was released on an LP titled &quot;Music by Erich Wolfgang Korngold&quot;. Ten years later Charles Gerhardt and Korngold&#x27;s son George included 6:53 minutes of &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; score on RCA&#x27;s album &quot;The Classic Film Scores of Erich Wolfgang Korngold&quot;. A complete re-recording was issued in 2007 by the &quot;Naxos&quot; label, recorded with the Moscow Symphony Orchestra and Chorus led by and reconstructed by .

==Propaganda purpose==

Although &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; was primarily an adventure film and a period piece about Elizabethan England&#x27;s struggles with Spain, it was also intended to help build British morale during World War II and to influence the American public into having a more pro-British outlook. King Philip of Spain was presented as an allegorical Hitler, and the queen&#x27;s speech at the close of the film was meant to inspire the British audience, which was already in the grip of the war. Suggestions that it was the duty of all free men to defend liberty, and that the world did not belong to any one man (an obvious reference to Hitler&#x27;s conquest of much of Europe), were intended to be rousing. (The same theme had been visited in Alexander Korda&#x27;s film &quot;Fire Over England&quot;, released three years earlier, before World War II started).

==Reception==
===Critical===
Bosley Crowther wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, 
Of course, [the film] is all historically cockeyed, and the amazing exploits of Mr. Flynn, accomplished by him in the most casual and expressionless manner, are quite as incredible as the adventures of Dick Tracy. But Flora Robson makes an interesting Queen Elizabeth, Claude Rains and Henry Daniell play a couple of villainous conspirators handsomely, there is a lot of brocaded scenery and rich Elizabethan costumes and, of course, there is Brenda Marshall to shed a bit of romantic light. And, when you come right down to it, that&#x27;s about all one can expect in an overdressed &quot;spectacle&quot; film which derives much more from the sword than from the pen.

A review in &quot;Time&quot; observed that:

&quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; (Warner) is 1940&#x27;s lustiest assault on the double feature. It cost $1,700,000, exhibits Errol Flynn and 3,000 other cinemactors performing every imaginable feat of spectacular derring-do, and lasts two hours and seven minutes...Produced by Warner&#x27;s Hal Wallis with a splendor that would set parsimonious Queen Bess&#x27;s teeth on edge, constructed of the most tried-&amp;-true cinema materials available, &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; is a handsome, shipshape picture. To Irish [sic] Cinemactor Errol Flynn, it gives the best swashbuckling role he has had since Captain Blood. For Hungarian Director Michael Curtiz, who took Flynn from bit-player ranks to make &quot;Captain Blood&quot; and has made nine pictures with him since, it should prove a high point in their profitable relationship.

&quot;Filmink&quot; called it &quot;pretty close to perfection as these things go.&quot;
This movie has a one hundred percent rating based on twelve critic reviews on Rotten Tomatoes.

===Box office===
The film had been in planning since Errol Flynn&#x27;s success in the swashbuckler epic &quot;Captain Blood&quot;. According to Warner Bros records, the film was Warners&#x27; most expensive and most popular film of 1940. It made $1,631,000 in the U.S. and $1,047,000 in other markets. Upon release in 1940, the film was among the higher grossing films of the year, and in several states (including Florida, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina and Virginia) it was highest grossing film of the year, and in several others (including Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky and Arkansas), it was the second highest grossing film of the year, coming behind &quot;Rebecca&quot;.

===1947 re-release===
The film was re-released to great popularity in 1947. It was one of the most popular films that screened in France that year.

==Awards and honors==
The film was nominated for four 13th Academy Awards:
* Art Direction (Black-and-White) (Anton Grot)
* Original Score (Erich Wolfgang Korngold)
* Sound Recording (Nathan Levinson)
* Special Effects (Byron Haskin, Nathan Levinson)

==Home media==
The 2005 Warner Brothers DVD release includes a 1940 Movietone News newsreel of the Battle of Britain, the short &quot;Alice in Movieland&quot;, the Looney Tunes cartoon &quot;Porky&#x27;s Poor Fish&quot;, and a 20-minute featurette &quot;The Sea Hawk: Flynn in Action&quot; about the film&#x27;s production.

Colorized versions of &quot;The Sea Hawk&quot; were broadcast on American television and distributed on VHS tape in 1986. Only the black-and-white, edited version (109 minutes) and the fully restored/uncut version (127 minutes) have been released on the DVD and Blu-ray formats. No plans have been announced to release the colorized version on DVD.

<doc id="936238" wikidata="Q7257916" url="?curid=936238" title="Public institution (United States)">
<text>A public institution is a juristic person in the United States which is backed through public funds and controlled by the state. Typically a public institution will have a board of trustees who govern the institution and the members of the board are public officials who are appointed by the state (typically a person in the executive branch such as a state governor) for a fixed term of years. When public institutions are created, they lead to many other establishments such as new laws.

==Description==
In U.S. law, whether an institution is public or private determines how bound the institution is to the requirements for civil rights to which the state must conform (see also Equal Protection Clause). A public institution is required to conform to the same requirements as the state for constitutional questions meaning that the U.S. Constitution, especially the Bill of Rights, applies to the institution as does the constitution of the state in which the public institution resides. Court cases involving public institutions are within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Court System.

In U.S. law, there are five major factors used by courts to determine if an institution is a public or a private institution and whether the court has jurisdiction in the case (see &quot;Powe v. Miles&quot; for an example).
* what amount of control does the state have in the governance of the institution
* what amount of state funding is used to support the institution&#x27;s activities
* what amount of the institution&#x27;s property is owned by the state
* does the institution have tax-free status
* is there a contract between the state and the institution

<doc id="936243" wikidata="Q16242180" url="?curid=936243" title="Galaxy (chocolate bar)">
<text>Galaxy is a chocolate bar, made and marketed by Mars Inc., and first manufactured in the United Kingdom in 1960. Galaxy is sold in the United Kingdom, Ireland, South Africa, the Middle East, Morocco, India, Pakistan, Australia, Malta, and is also sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico and various Continental European countries as [[Dove (chocolate brand)|Dove]]. In 2014, Galaxy was ranked the second-best-selling chocolate bar in the UK, after Cadbury Dairy Milk.

==Range==
The Galaxy and Dove brands cover a wide range of products including chocolate bars in milk chocolate, caramel, Cookie Crumble, and Fruit &amp; Nut varieties, Minstrels, Ripple (milk chocolate with a folded or &quot;rippled&quot; milk chocolate centre), Amicelli, Duetto, Promises, Bubbles and Truffle. Related brands in other parts of the world include &quot;Jewels,&quot; and &quot;Senzi&quot; in the Middle East. The Galaxy and Dove brands also market a wide range of products including ready-to-drink chocolate milk, hot chocolate powder, chocolate cakes, ice cream and more.

A vegan Galaxy range launched in 2019. In 2023, the 110g Smooth Milk Galaxy bar sold in the UK was reduced in size to 100g without the price being reduced. It was described in the media as an example of a retail trend for &quot;shrinkflation&quot; during a period of higher inflation.

===Bubbles===

Galaxy Bubbles is a chocolate bar made by Mars similar to a Cadburys Wispa or Nestlé Aero and was introduced in early 2010. The chocolate is like an ordinary Galaxy which has been aerated. The product also comes in an orange variety.

The standard version sold in stores is lighter compared to its competitors, at and consequently has a lower energy content, at , compared to the Wispa&#x27;s and or the Aero&#x27;s and .

It is also available as a 100g &#x27;block&#x27; or as a 28g milk chocolate egg (again with an aerated centre). The bar is suitable for vegetarians.

===Honeycomb Crisp===

Galaxy Honeycomb Crisp is a chocolate bar made by Mars that contains small granular nougats of honeycomb toffee, as part of the Galaxy chocolate range.

==Marketing==
A 2013 British television advertisement for Galaxy featured a computer-generated image of Audrey Hepburn, which was created by a CGI firm Framestore in London. The commercial, set to Hepburn singing &quot;Moon River&quot;, debuted in the UK in February 2013.

Galaxy previously sponsored the British Book Awards.

<doc id="936251" wikidata="Q1533474" url="?curid=936251" title="The Sadies">
<text>The Sadies are a Canadian rock and roll / country and western band from Toronto, Ontario. The band consists of Travis Good, Sean Dean and Mike Belitsky. Dallas Good, a founding member, died in 2022. Dallas and Travis are the sons of Margaret and Bruce Good, and nephews of Brian and Larry Good, who are members of the Canadian country group The Good Brothers.

==Background==
The Sadies were formed in 1994. In 1998 the group released their first album, &quot;Precious Moments&quot;. Several more albums followed, including &quot;In Concert Vol. 1&quot; in 2006.

In addition to their own recordings, the Sadies often collaborate with other artists, such as Blue Rodeo, Jon Langford, Gord Downie, Andre Williams (on the 1999 country-influenced &quot;Red Dirt&quot; and the 2012 release entitled &quot;Night and Day&quot;), Neil Young (track &quot;This Wheel’s on Fire&quot; on the album &quot;Garth Hudson Presents a Canadian Celebration of The Band&quot;) and have recorded, written and toured extensively as the backing band for singer Neko Case. They have also toured and recorded with Jon Spencer and Matt Verta-Ray as Heavy Trash, as well as John Doe. They are considered honorary members of The Mekons. The 2005 documentary &quot;Come on Down: Searching for the American Dream&quot; features music by the Sadies. The Sadies&#x27; music is featured in many films and television shows, for example, Adult Swim&#x27;s &quot;12 oz. Mouse&quot;. An instrumental performed by the band can be heard in episode 5 of season 1, during a scene in which Rhoda the bartender is murdered. 
On 18 May 2010, the Sadies released &quot;Darker Circles&quot; CD/LP through Outside Music and Yep Roc Records. &quot;Darker Circles&quot; was a shortlisted nominee for the 2010 Polaris Music Prize and in 2012, won a Juno Award with Mike Roberts for best video.

The Sadies are collectively members of the group The Unintended, along with Greg Keelor of Blue Rodeo and Rick White of Eric&#x27;s Trip/Elevator. They also make multiple contributions to Garth Hudson&#x27;s 2010 album &quot;Garth Hudson Presents: A Canadian Celebration of The Band&quot;, by performing &quot;The Shape I&#x27;m In&quot;, and also by backing Neil Young, for &quot;This Wheel&#x27;s On Fire&quot;, and Mary Margaret O&#x27;Hara, for &quot;Out of the Blue&quot;. All performances on that album featured Hudson on keyboards. The Sadies have performed with other members of the Good Brothers intermittently over the years using the name &quot;The Good Family&quot;, and in 2013 released the album &quot;The Good Family Album&quot;, as well as performing live under that name. 
Among the band&#x27;s last studio releases are &quot;Internal Sounds&quot;, released on 17 September 2013 through Outside Music; &quot;And the Conquering Sun&quot;, their 2014 collaboration with Gord Downie on Arts &amp; Crafts Productions; and &quot;Northern Passages&quot;, released in February 2017 on Yep Roc Records.

Dallas Good died unexpectedly on February 17, 2022, at the age of 48. The cause was a recently-detected heart condition. &quot;Colder Streams&quot;, the last Sadies album completed before his death, was released in July 2022, to critical acclaim. The album was the winner of the Juno Award for Adult Alternative Album of the Year at the Juno Awards of 2023, and was shortlisted for the 2023 Polaris Music Prize.

In 2024 the band released their first new album recorded without Dallas Good, a collaboration with Rick White entitled &quot;Rick White and the Sadies&quot;. White, a longtime friend of the band&#x27;s, had previously recorded his own album of Sadies covers, &quot;Rick White Plays the Sadies&quot;, in 2022 following Dallas Good&#x27;s death.

<text>The Colossus of Barletta is a large bronze statue of a Roman emperor, nearly three times life size (5.11 meters, or about 16 feet 7 inches), in Historic center of Barletta, Italy.
It is a Late Antique statue, but the date, identity of the emperor, and the original location of the statue remain uncertain. Most datings are to the 5th or early 6th centuries, and many think it was made in Constantinople, and perhaps originally placed there. It is the largest Roman or Byzantine bronze statue to have survived essentially intact.

==History==
The original location of the statue is unclear, but it was probably somewhere more important than Barletta, a small port on the Adriatic Sea. According to local legend, the statue supposedly washed up on the shore, after a Venetian ship sank returning from the Sack of Constantinople in the Fourth Crusade in 1204, but it is not impossible that the statue was sent to the West much earlier. The identity of the emperor is uncertain. 

It is known that a colossal statue was discovered in 1231 during excavations commissioned by emperor Frederick II in Ravenna and it is possible that he had it transported to his southern Italian lands. Regardless, the first certain historical reference to the statue dates from 1309, when parts of its legs and arms were used by local Dominicans to cast bells. The artist Fabio Alfano did a partial restoration of the statue in 1431. The restored colossus was re-erected on 14 May 1491 in front of Church of the Holy Sepulchre (Barletta).

== Description ==
The figure evidently depicts an emperor due to his imperial diadem, beneath which the hair falls in rolls. He has a commanding gesture that invokes the act of delivering a speech, with his right arm raised. In his right hand, which originally held a spear or a labarum, later restorers inserted a cross. Over two tunics the emperor wears a cuirass, with pteruges, protective strips of cloth or leather, covering his shoulders and upper legs. His cloak is draped over his left arm in a portrait convention that goes back to Augustus. In his outstretched left hand he holds a small orb, another later addition to replace a larger original orb.

==Identity of the emperor==
According to tradition, the statue depicts Heraclius (), though this is most unlikely on historical and art-historical grounds. Several alternative candidates have been proposed, ranging from Valentinian I () to Justinian I (). Most modern scholars identify the emperor as either Marcian (), in which case it probably topped the Column of Marcian, or Leo I (), meaning it topped the Column of Leo, both columns in Constantinople. However, Marcian&#x27;s column has been noted as being too small for the scale of the statue. The fact that the emperor is shown bearded has also been used to link it to Leo, although this identification is not always accepted.

<text>Barletta (; Salentino: &quot;Varrétte&quot; or &quot;Barlétte&quot;) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in Apulia, in southeastern Italy. Barletta is the &quot;capoluogo&quot;, together with Andria and Trani, of the Province of Barletta-Andria-Trani. It has a population of around 94,700 citizens.

The city&#x27;s territory belongs to the Valle dell&#x27;Ofanto. The Ofanto river crosses the countryside and forms the border between the territory of Barletta and that of Margherita di Savoia. The mouth of the river is in the territory of Barletta.

The area of Barletta also includes part of the battlefield of Cannae. This is a very important archeological site, remembered for the major battle in 216 BCE between the Romans and the Carthaginians, won by Hannibal. The site has been recognised as Città d&#x27;Arte (&quot;city of art&quot;) of Apulia in the 2005 for the beautiful architecture. Cannae flourished in the Roman period and then after a series of debilitating Saracen attacks, was finally destroyed by the Normans and then abandoned in the early Middle Ages.

Barletta is home to the Colossus of Barletta, a bronze statue, representing a Roman Emperor (perhaps Theodosius II). This statue, called &quot;Eraclio&quot; by the inhabitants of Barletta, is about tall, and remains the biggest statue that survives from the late Roman Empire (i.e. the Roman Empire after Constantine). According to a local folk story, Eraclio saved the city from a Saracen attack. Seeing the Saracen ships approaching Barletta&#x27;s coast, Eraclio waited for them on the sea shore. Here Eraclio acted as if he was crying so the Saracens asked him why he was sad and Eraclio answered that he was sad because he was the smallest among Barletta&#x27;s inhabitants and so everybody made fun of him. The Saracens thought that Barletta&#x27;s inhabitants were all giants so left the coast, fearing to face them.

In 1503 Barletta was the location of the &quot;disfida di Barletta&quot; (&quot;Joust of Barletta&quot;), a battle during which 13 Italian knights commanded by Ettore Fieramosca challenged and defeated an equal number of French knights who were at the time prisoners of war, in a joust held near Andria. This episode was documented in 1833 by Massimo d&#x27;Azeglio, who wrote the novel &quot;Ettore Fieramosca o la Disfida di Barletta&quot;. In the book the author regards this episode as one of the earliest manifestations of Italian national pride.

The city at the time was fairly loosely besieged by French forces, and occupied by a Spanish army under the command of Gonzalo de Cordoba the &#x27;Gran Capitan&#x27;.

Barletta has one gold medal for military valour and another one for civil valour, for its resistance to an incursion of German Fallschirmjäger who destroyed the port in order to prevent its falling intact into the hands of the advancing British Eighth Army during World War II.

== Geography ==
Barletta is located on the Adriatic coast, where the rocky shore is covered with silt from the Ofanto river. The river forms the boundary of the provinces of Bari and Foggia and has always influenced the agricultural activities of the area. The river also marks the passage from the Murgia to the fertile plain of the Tavoliere, which starts in Barletta.

Barletta is situated on the south-west end of the Gulf of Manfredonia and sits opposite the promontory of Gargano. On its borders are: the Adriatic coast to the north; Trani to the south-east; Canosa di Puglia to the south-west; the mouth of the Ofanto river to the north-west; and the town of Margherita di Savoia to the west. It is on a low plain that varies from above sea level. The surface extends over an area of , and has a length (east to west) of about , a width (north to south) of about and a perimeter of about .

Its climate is moderated by the sea. Winds are usually from the south. Rainfall is low; Barletta receives of rain annually, with most of the rain in autumn and winter during which day-long deluges occur. Rain is minimal between the second half of June and the first half of August.

The &quot;comune&quot; comprises two parts, Montaltino and Fiumara. The communes next to Barletta are: Andria, Canosa di Puglia, Margherita di Savoia, San Ferdinando di Puglia, Trani, and Trinitapoli.

The city is endowed with a very long, sandy coast stretching to both the east and the west from the commercial port. Along the coast, there are various attractive beaches with trees to the west.

== History ==
Barletta developed long before the Roman era, known by Greeks and Romans respectively as Bardulos or Barulum.
In the Middle Ages it was a stronghold of the Normans and Lombards, becoming an important staging post for the Crusaders and the Teutonic Knights and Templars as well as the Knights of St.John. Following the Muslim conquest in the Holy Land, the Archbishops of Nazareth took refuge in Barletta (permanently in 1327).

After immigration from the nearby Canne increased its population due to the destruction of Cannae by the Normans, Barletta lived its periods of greatest splendour under King Frederick II and then subsequently the Angevin kings of Naples.

At the beginning of the 16th century, during the guerilla war between the French and the Spanish over possession of Southern Italy, the city was the theater of a historical victory of Italian knights over French prisoners, in what became known as the Challenge of Barletta (13 February 1503). This took place during the occupation of the city by Gonzalo de Cordoba, and served as a handy diversion for his restive siege-bound army. Later the city served as a fortress for the Spanish rulers of southern Italy. In 1528 it was sacked by French troops under Odet de Foix.

The city was the capital of its district and the seat of the lower prefecture for the 120 years between 1806 and 1927 and sided with the French under Joachim Murat during the Napoleonic War.

During and after the Unification, Barletta was as poor as was most of the South of Italy. Consequently, hygiene and health were particularly bad. Various types of disease plagued the population, such as tuberculosis, diarrhea, pneumonia, small pox, malaria, etc. An estimated 15% of the population was affected by trachoma. The most dreaded of the diseases brought by poverty was cholera. Outbreaks of cholera took place in the city in 1836, 1854, 1865, 1866, 1867, 1886 and finally 1910 when the bacillus was brought back to Barletta by Barlettan fishermen, and killed tens of thousands all over southern Italy. Barletta also has a religious dark side to it when the very last Protestants to be burned alive at the stake took place in 1866. &quot;The Papists came out of Santo Sepolcro, in their rampage to martyr Protestants as they screamed, &quot;Death to the Protestants!&#x27;&quot; (London &quot;Times&quot;, 9 April 1866) A 100 year anniversary plaque to the five Protestant martyrs can be seen at the Evangelical Baptist Church (Italian, &quot;Chiesa Evangelica Battista&quot;) of Barletta.

During World War I a minor naval battle took place off Barletta and the Italian Nembo-class destroyer &quot;Turbine&quot; was sunk by the Austro-Hungarian light cruiser &quot;Helgoland&quot; and destroyers &quot;Csepel&quot;, &quot;Tátra&quot; and &quot;Lika&quot; on 24 May 1915.

During World War II, the city was the site of the first episode of Italian conflict with German troops, when a battalion of Fallschirmjäger (parachutists) was sent from Foggia to Barletta to destroy the port before the British 8th Army could arrive, the Italian garrison surrendered after a brief struggle, thereby earning the Gold Medal of Military Valour and of Civilian Merit.

After the war it was the site of a DP camp.

The city hosts Monumental Cemetery of Barletta.

== Main sights ==
The principal monuments of the city are:

* The Castle, a structure initially erected in the 10th century by the Normans as a typical motte and bailey structure. During the Crusade period, it was a used as a hostel for soldiers leaving for the Holy Land. It was upgraded and enlarged substantially under the reign of Frederick II between 1225 and 1228. This corresponds to the period in which he launched a crusade from here, the Sixth Crusade. The castle was later expanded under the House of Anjou, when Barletta became an important centre of Aragonese-Spanish control in the area, in 1527. Charles had the building expanded again and the four massive bastions added to create the present fortress form. In 1915 the fortress, then in use as a barracks and military store, was bombarded by the Austro-Hungarian scout cruiser . In September 1943 it was the setting of an Italian military defence unit against a German army.

* Colossus of Barletta: a large bronze statue of a Roman Emperor.
* Basilica of the Holy Sepulchre (&quot;Basilica of San Sepolcro&quot;): adjacent to Colossus, this church was built in the 12th century and the former headquarters outside the city walls of the Knights of Malta, it stood next to a hospital for pilgrims (now demolished) to the Holy Land during the medieval period, a Romanesque church with particular Oriental influences from Jerusalem. The façade represents the Baroque style.
* Cathedral of Santa Maria Maggiore: erected on the former site of the temple of Neptune, is an example of the fusion of Gothic and Roman styles. In its interior, at a lower level, are &quot;grotticella&quot; tombs from the 3rd century BC, over which is the Palaeo-Christian basilica (6th century AD) with another basilica being added to that in the 9th century. In the 12th century a new building was erected in Romanesque style, being consecrated in 1267; this was renovated in the Gothic style in the 14th century
* &quot;San Giacomo&quot;: 11th-century church named after St James the Great (&#x27;Matamoros&#x27; or Saracen-slayer), was erected on the site of what had been the temple of Isis in Roman times. Toppled by the earthquake that nearly razed Barletta, it was soon rebuilt and re-consecrated in 1751.
* The Cellar of the Challenge, a former prison for galley slaves.
* Palace of the Marra: Baroque palace outside Salento, now housing the Pinacoteca Giuseppe De Nittis.
* Canne della Battaglia: archeologic site, location of the Battle of Cannae.

<text>The Montagne Sainte-Geneviève () is a hill overlooking the left bank of the Seine in the 5th arrondissement of Paris, France. It was known to the ancient Romans as . Atop the Montagne are the Panthéon and the Bibliothèque Sainte-Geneviève. The side streets of the Montagne feature bars and restaurants, for example, in the Rue Mouffetard.

Moreover, the former campus of the &quot;École Polytechnique&quot;, located on the Montagne, now is the Ministry of Research. On the other side of the Montagne lie the &quot;rue d&#x27;Ulm&quot; and the &quot;École Normale Supérieure&quot;. Around AD 1110, the scholar and philosopher, Peter Abelard, established a school on the Montagne; twenty-six years later, Abelard returned, in the year 1136.

<doc id="936289" wikidata="Q1197303" url="?curid=936289" title="Groombridge 1618">
<text>Groombridge 1618 is a star in the northern constellation Ursa Major. With an apparent visual magnitude of +6.6, it lies at or below the threshold of stars visible to the naked eye for an average observer. It is relatively close to Earth, at . This is a main sequence star of spectral type K7.5 Ve, having just 67% of the Sun&#x27;s mass.

==Properties==
This star was first identified as entry 1618 in the work &quot;A Catalog of Circumpolar Stars&quot; by Stephen Groombridge published posthumously in 1838. Its large proper motion across the sky suggested that it was relatively nearby and made it an early candidate for parallax measurements. In 1884 the parallax angle was measured as , which is larger than the modern value of 0″.205.

Groombridge 1618 has a stellar classification of K8 V, which means it is a K-type main sequence star that is generating energy by fusing hydrogen at its core. It has 67% of the mass of the Sun, 61% of the Sun&#x27;s radius, but radiates only 15% of the Sun&#x27;s energy and only 4.6% of the Sun&#x27;s energy in the visible light spectrum. The effective surface temperature of the star&#x27;s photosphere is about 4,000 K, giving it an orange hue.

It is a BY Draconis variable with a surface magnetic field strength of 750 G. The chromosphere is relatively inactive and produces star spots comparable to Sun spots. However, like UV Ceti, it has been observed to undergo increases in luminosity as a flare star.

==Search for planets==
A search for excess infrared emission from this star by the Infrared Space Observatory came up negative, implying that Groombridge 1618 does not possess
a nearby debris disk (such as Vega does). However, observations using the Herschel Space Observatory showed a small excess suggesting a low-temperature debris disk. The data can be modeled by a ring of coarse, highly-reflective dust at a temperature below 22 K orbiting at least 51 AU from the host star. If this star does have a companion, astrometric measurements appear to place an upper bound of 3–12 times the mass of Jupiter on such a hypothetical object (for orbital periods in the range of 5–50 years).

Observations collated by Marcy &amp; Benitz (1989), tend towards a single notable object with periodicity of 122 days as a planetary object with minimum mass 4 times that of Jupiter. This candidate planet was never confirmed and the signal the authors had found could have been due to intrinsic stellar activity from the star&#x27;s young age.
If confirmed, the planet would be within the star&#x27;s habitable zone.= S_{eff_{\odot}} + aT_{\ast} + bT_{\ast}^2 + cT_{\ast}^3 + dT_{\ast}^4&lt;/math&gt; when used to calculate the stellar flux reaching the outer atmosphere of an Earth-like planet orbiting Groombridge 1618 at the Inner Habitable Zone edge - the Runaway Greenhouse limit gives a formula_1 of 0.9397 or 93.97% the stellar flux reaching the top of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. By applying the previously calculated stellar flux and the known 15% luminosity of Groombridge 1618 into the equation, formula_2, the distance of the Inner HZ - Runaway Greenhouse limit from Groombridge 1618 can be calculated as formula_3.|group=&quot;note&quot;|name=maximum greenhouse}}

An examination of this system in 2010 using the MMT telescope fitted with adaptive optics failed to detect a planetary companion.

The habitable zone for this star, defined where liquid water could be present on an Earth-like planet, is at a radius of 0.26–0.56 AU, where 1 AU is the average distance from the Earth to the Sun.

The star is among five nearby K-type stars of a type in a &#x27;sweet spot’ between Sun-analog stars and M stars for the likelihood of evolved life, per analysis of Giada Arney from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center.

<doc id="936294" wikidata="Q6186153" url="?curid=936294" title="Jesse Birdsall">
<text>Jesse Birdsall (born 13 February 1963) is an English actor, known for his roles as Marcus Tandy in the BBC1 soap opera &quot;Eldorado&quot; (1992–1993), Nick Beckett in the adventure series &quot;Bugs&quot; (1995–1999), football manager Roger Webb in &quot;Footballers&#x27; Wives&quot; (2003–2006), and Fraser Black in &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; (2013–2014) as well as for villain Ron Gregory in a few episodes of &quot;The Bill&quot;.

==Career==
As a child, Birdsall attended the Anna Scher children&#x27;s theatre school in Islington, and in his teens appeared in Nanette Newman&#x27;s children&#x27;s cooking programme &quot;Fun Food Factory&quot; and in several television plays and series, usually with his trademark rockabilly look. He had one line as an extra (&quot;Watch it mate!&quot;) in an episode of &quot;Minder&quot; from 1980 entitled &quot;Don&#x27;t Tell Them Willie Boy was Here&quot;. In 1982 he starred alongside singer Hazel O&#x27;Connor in the TV drama series set in a nightclub called &quot;Jangles&quot;. He first came to wider public attention in the serial &quot;Annika&quot; in 1984, his first notable television role. He then subsequently appeared in the films &quot;Wish You Were Here&quot; (1987), directed by David Leland and co-starring Emily Lloyd, &quot;Getting It Right&quot; (1989), and &quot;Beyond Bedlam&quot; (1994). He appeared in the 1988 music video of Kim Wilde&#x27;s single &quot;Hey Mister Heartache&quot;. 

Another notable television role was his portrayal of slick playboy Marcus Tandy in the BBC1 soap opera &quot;Eldorado&quot;, which ran for just one year from 1992 to 1993 and came to be thought of as a notable flop. Nonetheless, the amount of coverage the programme received for its perceived low quality and lack of success would gain Birdsall much exposure, and from 1995 to 1999 he played one of the lead characters in another BBC1 programme, the successful futuristic action/adventure series &quot;Bugs&quot;.

Birdsall played the part of John Barron in the last episode of &quot;Inspector Morse&quot; in the episode &quot;The Remorseful Day&quot; which aired on 15 November 2000.

In 2002 he appeared in an episode of &quot;Murder in Mind&quot; called &quot;Swansong&quot;. He appeared in &quot;New Tricks&quot; as Tony Morgan in season 8 episode 6.
He guest-starred in &quot;Midsomer Murders&quot; in the episodes &quot;Market For Murder&quot; in 2002 as Harry Painter and &quot;Small Mercies&quot; in 2009 as Mike Johnson. He also appeared in several episodes of the ITV police drama &quot;The Bill&quot; in 2003 as a character named Ron Gregory, and for the same network appeared as a regular in series 3–5 of the popular drama &quot;Footballers&#x27; Wives&quot;.

In 2006, Birdsall appeared as patient Dillon Ellis in two episodes of &quot;Holby City&quot; before reappearing in 2018 as Steven Fletcher, the estranged father of Adrian Fletcher.

He had a small role in the BBC One soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; in August 2012, playing John Hewland, jilted fiancé of Sharon Watts (Letitia Dean), in two episodes.

Birdsall played the role of Fraser Black in Channel 4 soap &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; but left the show in spring 2014 following a whodunit storyline in which he was murdered.

==Personal life==

The son of Penguin Books designer Derek Birdsall, Birdsall attended Hampstead School in north London. He has been married to &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; actress Gwyneth Strong, with whom he has two children, since 15 July 2000.

Birdsall has been in trouble with the police twice: being convicted of actual bodily harm after an altercation in 1981, and being fined £1,000 following an unprovoked attack on a fellow customer at a pub in London in 1999.

Birdsall is a supporter of Arsenal having been born and brought up in the Highbury district.

<doc id="936307" wikidata="Q359396" url="?curid=936307" title="Yaroslav II of Vladimir">
<text>Yaroslav II Vsevolodovich (; Christian name: &quot;Theodor&quot; (); 8 February 1191 – 30 September 1246), also transliterated as Iaroslav, was Grand Prince of Vladimir from 1238 to 1246. He collaborated with Batu Khan following the Mongol invasion, before he was ultimately poisoned.

==Prince of Pereyaslav==
Yaroslav was the fourth son of Vsevolod the Big Nest and Maria Shvarnovna.

In 1200, he was sent by his father to rule the town of Pereiaslav near the Kypchak steppes. Six years later, he was summoned by boyars of Halych to rule their city but could not effectively claim the throne. Thereupon he was sent to take Ryazan, but the stubborn opposition of the inhabitants led to the city being burnt. In 1209, Vsevolod sent Yaroslav to oppose Mstislav the Bold in Novgorod. After several battles, the two princes made peace, whereby Yaroslav married Mstislav&#x27;s daughter.

Upon his deathbed, Vsevolod the Big Nest bequeathed to him Pereslavl-Zalessky. In the conflict between his elder brothers Konstantin and Yuri, Yaroslav supported the latter. In 1215, he accepted the offer of the Novgorodians to become their prince but, desiring revenge for their former treachery, captured Torzhok and blocked its supplies of grain to Novgorod. Several months later, he was defeated by his father-in-law on the Lipitsa River and had to retreat to Pereslavl; a helmet that he lost during the battle would be retrieved by archaeologists in 1808.
==Prince of Novgorod and Kiev==
In 1222, Yaroslav, finally enthroned in Novgorod, overran all of Estonia and besieged its capital Kolyvan. Four years later, he devastated Finland and baptised Karelia. His next ambition was to subjugate Pskov, but the Novgorodians refused to make war against its neighbour. Yaroslav departed in anger and seized the Novgorodian enclave of Volokolamsk. In 1234, he returned to Novgorod and several years later defeated its chief enemies—Lithuanians and the Teutonic Knights. In 1236, he followed Daniel of Galicia&#x27;s advice and moved from Novgorod to Kiev, leaving his son Alexander as his representative in the north.

==Grand Prince of Vladimir==
In 1238, when the Mongols first invaded Kievan Rus&#x27; and his elder brother Yuri was killed in battle, Yaroslav left Kiev for Vladimir, where he was crowned grand prince. Yaroslav attempted to restore the cities of Vladimir-Suzdal after the Mongol ravages and fires. In 1243, he was summoned by Batu Khan to his capital Sarai. After a lengthy conference, he returned to Vladimir with honours. Two years later, he was again summoned to the east, this time by Güyük Khan in Karakorum. There he was poisoned by the Great Khan&#x27;s mother Töregene and died a week after he had been allowed to return home.

==Family==
Yaroslav married his first wife c. 1205. She was a daughter of Yuri Konchakovich, Khan of the Cumans. Her people belonged to the Kipchaks, a confederation of pastoralists and warriors of Turkic origin.

In 1214, Yaroslav married his second wife Rostislava Mstislavna. She was a daughter of Mstislav the Bold and another Cuman princess. Her maternal grandfather was Kotian Khan. They were divorced in 1216.

In 1218, Yaroslav married his third wife Fedosia Igorevna of Ryazan. She was a daughter of Igor Glebovich and Agrafena of Kiev. Her father was the second son of Gleb Rostislavich, Prince of Ryazan (d. 1178) and Euphrosyne of Pereyaslavl. Her mother was a daughter of Rostislav I of Kiev. They had at least twelve children:

*Fyodor Yaroslavich (Winter, 1219 – 5 June 1233). Betrothed to Euphrosyne Mikhailovna of Chernigov. She was a daughter of Michael of Chernigov and Maria Romanovna of Galicia and Volynia. Fyodor died the day before his marriage date.
*Alexander Nevsky (30 May 1220 – 14 November 1263).
*Andrei II of Vladimir (c. 1222–1264).
*Mikhail Khorobrit, Prince of Moscow. Took control of Vladimir and proclaimed himself its Prince in 1248. Killed while facing a Lithuanian invasion.
*Daniil Yaroslavich (d. 1256).
*Yaroslav of Tver (d. 9 September 1271).
*Konstantin Yaroslavich, Prince of Galich and Dmitrov.
*Maria Yaroslavna (born 1240).
*Vasily of Kostroma (1241–1276).
*Afanasy Yaroslavich.
*Eudoxia Yaroslavna.
*Iuliana Yaroslavna.

<text>Price Chopper Supermarkets is an American supermarket chain owned by Northeast Grocery, headquartered in Schenectady, New York. The chain opened its first supermarkets in New York&#x27;s Capital District in 1932, and changed its name from Central Market to Price Chopper in 1973. It operates 129 stores in six states: Upstate New York, Vermont, Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania. It operates stores under the Price Chopper, Market Bistro, and Market 32 banners.

== History ==
=== 1920s to 1980s: Early years ===
In 1927, William Golub and his brother, Bernard, took over the wholesale grocery that their father, Lewis Golub, had opened in 1908 after emigrating from Russia. In 1932, Joseph E. Grosberg, together with Russian Jewish immigrants Bernard and William Golub, partners in the Grosberg-Golub Corporation, opened the partnership&#x27;s first supermarket (initially called Public Service Market) in Green Island, New York, followed by stores in Cohoes, Watervliet and Schenectady. They gave all four stores the name Central Market.

The concept was a success and they continued to open many more stores in the region. In 1943, the Golub brothers bought out Joseph Grosberg&#x27;s share of the company and formed the present parent company, the Golub Corporation. In 1951, it was one of the first grocery chains in the country to issue the well-known S&amp;H Green Trading Stamps.

In the fall of 1973, Central Market changed its operating strategy. The chain dropped Green Stamps, slashed prices and, to reflect this new strategy, it re-branded to the name &quot;Price Chopper.&quot; (The name &quot;Central Market&quot; is now used as an upscale house brand, as well as for the floral department.) Price Chopper experienced continuing growth throughout the 1970s, opening new stores and upgrading old ones.

=== 1980s–1990s: Store modernization and expansion ===
Price Chopper was an early innovator in the conversion of conventional stores to superstores and combination (food and drug) units, as well as operating stores that are open 24 hours a day. The first Price Chopper opened in the late 1970s in Oneonta, New York. Another opened in the early 1980s in Latham, New York, and then an even-larger unit was constructed in Queensbury, New York in 1986. The Super Centers, which were state-of-the-art by 1980s standards, often featured full-service meat, seafood, and bakery departments, as well as pharmacies and banks (features new to supermarkets at the time). These units were also known for their unconventional layouts, with aisles facing horizontally, or away from, the cash registers, rather than the traditional vertical arrangement with the aisles facing the cash register area. Few Price Chopper stores still retain this layout today. In the late 1980s, Price Chopper changed its corporate logo featuring an axe cutting into a coin.

In 1993, Price Chopper launched an updated version of the Super Center format with a South Hills Mall store in Poughkeepsie. (This store closed on July 15, 2006 and was converted into a ShopRite.) This was Price Chopper&#x27;s first store in the Mid-Hudson Valley market. The updated concept had a greater emphasis on take-out and ready-to-eat meals, some featuring food courts with Price Chopper&#x27;s own in-house branded concepts, including Roasters (rotisserie chicken; no relation to Kenny Rogers Roasters), Bella Roma (pizza), Coyote Joe&#x27;s (tacos and burritos), and the Bagel Factory. Under the newer prototype, the aisles were also placed back in the traditional vertical arrangement at the request of many customers who found the former layout confusing.

=== 1990s–2000s: Expansion into New England ===
Prior to 1990, Price Chopper was barely a player in the New England states, with only about a half dozen outlets in Massachusetts and Vermont. The chain acquired the now-defunct Giant Value supermarkets during the late 1970s, which accounted for most of the New England locations at the time. However, beginning in the early 1990s, the chain began an aggressive expansion eastward into the New England region, primarily focusing on further growth in Vermont and Massachusetts. Today the chain operates about 40 stores throughout four of the New England states.

In 1990, Price Chopper acquired many stores in Vermont from Syracuse-based P&amp;C Food Markets, which the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was requiring it to sell because of its parent company&#x27;s decision to increase its ownership stake in Grand Union. Throughout the 1990s, Price Chopper made an attempt to either modernize, expand, or construct replacement stores for many of the acquired P&amp;C locations. Today, Price Chopper has a presence in most of Vermont&#x27;s larger cities and towns.

In 1995, Price Chopper acquired the Wonder Market Companies&#x27; twelve Big D stores in the Worcester, Massachusetts area, rebranding them or replacing them with Price Chopper stores. In 2012, Price Chopper expanded its presence in this region by opening two new stores, in Hopkinton and Gardner. In addition to its store base in Central Massachusetts, Price Chopper also has three stores in the Berkshires, but there are no stores in the greater Springfield area or other towns in the Pioneer Valley despite being located between these two regions.

In 1999, Price Chopper opened its first New Hampshire store in West Lebanon, and in 2006, its second location, a Market Center—in Keene. A third location, in Lebanon in a former P&amp;C Foods store, opened in 2009. Price Chopper opened its fourth New Hampshire store, also a former P&amp;C Foods, in Lincoln in May 2010, expanding its footprint to the White Mountains.

In the 2010s, Price Chopper also expanded rapidly into Connecticut, primarily in the Hartford suburbs, where it now operates nine stores. During the grand opening of Windsor, Connecticut store #221, Price Chopper raised the most money in company history for its non-profit organization. In 2010, Price Chopper opened a store in Middletown. Another location opened in Storrs, near the main campus of UConn, on June 6, 2014.

In 2002, Price Chopper exited the convenience store business by leasing out its remaining convenience locations to Petroleum Marketing, a Getty operator. Price Chopper had attempted to enter the convenience store business during the 1980s by opening smaller stores, mostly with gas pumps but sometimes without, to utilize older, smaller storefronts where a larger store was not possible. They operated under the &quot;Mini Chopper&quot; trade name, still using the logo of an axe cutting into a coin. But they were largely unsuccessful.

In June 2009, Price Chopper established a three-year partnership with Sunoco for the company&#x27;s &quot;Fuel Advantage&quot; program, where customers earned 10 cents off every gallon of gas for every 100 dollars spent on groceries. (It was formerly 50 dollars until the first renewal in 2012.) The partnership was renewed in May 2012 for another three years, and again in 2015.

=== 2009–present: Growing greener, Market Bistro, and Market 32 ===

With the opening of its newest store located in Colonie Plaza in Colonie, New York, on June 2, 2009, Price Chopper has made investments to incorporate various green and energy-saving initiatives throughout the store. Green features include a 400 kW United Technologies Corp. natural gas fuel cell which provides a significant amount of power (60% as quoted by Price Chopper) for the store. Abundant skylighting and an addressable lighting control system from Encelium Technologies allow the store to dim its lighting when enough daylight is present. Occupancy sensors cover nearly the entire layout of the store including all offices, backrooms and loading docks. It ensures that the lights are automatically switched-off or significantly dimmed when vacant for a certain period of time. Even aisle ways and other areas of the main sales floor are dimmed unless that aisle or section is occupied.

In March 2014, after over 15 months of renovations, Price Chopper completed its remodel of its 25-year-old Latham, New York store and rebranded the store as Market Bistro, including an expanded food court featuring hamburgers, a Ben &amp; Bill&#x27;s sandwich counter, stone-fired pizza, an ice cream shop, Chef&#x27;s Grill, as well as an expanded 24-hour drive-through pharmacy, an on-site clinic, and a cooking school.

On November 11, 2014, CEO Jerry Golub, along with Executive Chairman of the Board Neil Golub and the company&#x27;s COO Scott Grimmett, announced that the chain would be changing its name to &quot;Market 32&quot; a nod to the year of the company&#x27;s founding (1932) by brothers Ben and Bill Golub. Jerry Golub stated that the name change reflects Price Chopper&#x27;s continuing advancements, and reflects that the company is now more of an upscale grocer and less of a discount retailer, as the name Price Chopper suggests. Changes to branding, product labels, loyalty cards, company uniforms, as well as store modernizations, are to be rolled-out over the coming years at a cost of more than $300 million. More than half of the company&#x27;s 135 stores will be remodeled and rebranded. At least one-third of the $300 million is to be invested in stores in the New York Capital Region.

On June 17, 2015, Price Chopper announced that it would be phasing out the sale of tobacco products in all 135 of its Price Chopper and Market 32 stores, joining competitors Shoprite, Wegmans, and CVS/pharmacy.

===2020s===
On February 8, 2021, Price Chopper Supermarkets/Market 32 and Tops Friendly Markets announced plans to merge. The new parent company will be headquartered in Schenectady, New York. The Price Chopper/Market 32 and Tops Markets businesses will retain main offices in Schenectady and Williamsville and will continue to be managed locally by their respective leaders. The merger was completed November 8, 2021 and the combined company is called Northeast Grocery.
On November 28, 2023, it was revealed that Price Chopper had purchased all 5 of the former ShopRites in the Capital Region. The Niskayuna and North Greenbush locations will be converted to Market 32 while the Slingerlands location will be subleased. The Price Chopper locations at Westgate Plaza and Colonie Plaza will relocate to the former ShopRites in Albany and Colonie as Market 32s.

== Locations == 

Price Chopper operates 129 stores in Upstate New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Its locations are all serviced from the same warehouse in Rotterdam, New York. Price Chopper&#x27;s primary market is still the Capital District of New York, where about one-third of its store base is located. Other major markets for Price Chopper include Utica, Syracuse, Binghamton, and the Mid-Hudson Valley in New York, as well as Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania; Hartford, Connecticut; Worcester, Massachusetts and Burlington, Vermont. Price Chopper primarily competes with Hannaford, Shaw&#x27;s, and Stop &amp; Shop in the eastern portion of its trading area, while facing competition from Wegmans, and Tops Markets (formerly Penn Traffic storefronts) in the west, and ShopRite and Stop &amp; Shop in the south.

The former Waterbury, Connecticut location closed in June 2008 and the location was purchased by rival chain ShopRite. This marked a step back for the Price Chopper chain in a highly-competitive area where another chain grocery store, Shaw&#x27;s of Waterbury, also closed in September 2007 as part of that chain&#x27;s exit from the state. All of Price Chopper&#x27;s remaining stores in Connecticut have so far been successful despite being a relatively-new name to the region.

== Brands and campaigns ==
Price Chopper has four private label brands: PICS by Price Chopper (main brand being phased in, replacing Price Chopper brand), Price Chopper (main brand used on most food products, being phased out with the transition to Market 32), Price Chopper Naturals (some organic products, being phased out), and Central Market Classics (upscale brand, used on higher-end foods and currently phased out). Other brands are sourced from Topco Associates, including TopCare (health and beauty products), Full Circle (natural and organic products), Valu Time (value-priced brand, often made using cheaper ingredients), and Simply Done (paper products, cleaning products, storage solutions, etc.)

From 2007 to 2015, the company had used a summer campaign to promote its fresh meats and produce, known simply as &quot;Price Chopper House of BBQ.&quot; Accompanying this campaign, the company used the slogan &quot;not cooking tonight... we’re grilling tonight&quot; in jingles. The campaign mainly featured jazz musician Melvin Sparks until his death in 2011. For 2016, the House of BBQ was dropped from advertising in favor of a new campaign called &quot;Summertime: Savor Every Moment.&quot;

== Ben and Bill&#x27;s ==
In late 2005, renovations on the eight-year-old Slingerlands store (#159) began. Plans for the renovation included the opening of a New York-style sandwich shop named &quot;Ben and Bill&#x27;s&quot; after the founders of the company. The Sandwich Shop sells a variety of pre-packaged products, such as typical New York City pastries, along with sandwiches and deli items. It stands next to the store&#x27;s regular deli and is themed to look like a traditional New York City delicatessen. The sandwich shop was a success at the Slingerlands store and has since been rolled out to four other locations. The second Ben and Bill&#x27;s opened in July 2008 in the Saratoga Springs (#158) store, a third location opened in September 2009 in Burlington, Vermont&#x27;s (#165) store. In March 2014, a fourth location opened in Price Chopper&#x27;s flagship store, the newly remodeled and rebranded Market Bistro (#138) store in Latham, New York.

<text>The Original Celtics were a barnstorming professional American basketball team. At various times in their existence, the team played in the American Basketball League, the Eastern Basketball League and the Metropolitan Basketball League. The team has no relation to the NBA Boston Celtics, other than as an indirect inspiration. The franchise as a whole was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1959.

==Early years==
The team&#x27;s roots lay in the New York Celtics team that disbanded during World War I. In 1918, James Furey assembled his own team around a nucleus of those truly &quot;original&quot; Celtics, adding other players mostly from the West Side of New York City, and defiantly called his new squad the Original Celtics. Initially they played in various struggling professional leagues, before becoming primarily a touring squad which traveled up to 150,000 miles a year while completing a 150–200 game schedule. They won about ninety percent of their games and finished 1922–23 with the unbelievable record of 193–11–1. Hoping to claim an undisputed national championship, they challenged the nationally famous Franklin Wonder Five, but the Franklin coach refused as his team &quot;was too tired&quot; after a grueling year.
The team&#x27;s first dominant player was &quot;Dutch&quot; Dehnert, a 6&#x27;1&quot; (1.85 m) standing guard who some credit with introducing the modern concept of pivot play. When ballhandling wizard Nat Holman (later to coach national championship teams at CCNY) was signed to play for then-coach John Whitty in 1922, the Original Celtics hit their stride.

During the 1921/22 season, the team replaced the New York Giants, whose owner also owned the Whirlwinds during the 1st half. During the 1922/23 season, the team took over the Atlantic City franchise when it was 4–7 and won five of six games before the Eastern League folded in January, 1923. They also competed in the Metropolitan League but dropped out of the league during the 1st half after going 12–0.

Other outstanding individual players on these squads were another &quot;big man&quot;, Joe Lapchick; John Beckman, called the &quot;Babe Ruth of Basketball&quot;; George &quot;Horse&quot; Haggerty; John &quot;Pete&quot; Barry; and speedy Davey Banks.

==1925–1930: ABL success==
American Basketball League owners meeting during the summer of 1926 were generally pleased by the results of the league&#x27;s inaugural session. Only Buffalo had not signed up for the second season. League President Joe Carr had signed three new members in Baltimore, New York, and Philadelphia. The latter two were of particular importance to the league&#x27;s credibility. Two Philadelphia boxing promoters, Jules Aronson and Max Hoff were recruited by Carr to finance the team and Eddie Gottlieb was hired to run the team. The situation in New York was considerably less clear. The Original Celtics signed to represent New York, but they were reluctant recruits at best. After last season, Carr had banned any ABL team from playing games against the Celtics, drying up some of their most lucrative exhibition dates. In the past, such a tactic would not have intimidated the Celtics, but they were already under financial stress due to the June indictment of owner Jim Furry for embezzling $190,000 from a New York business.

Then, in early October, just a month before the ABL season was to get underway, the Celtics bolted to the newly organized National Basketball League. The new league operated solely in and around the metropolitan New York City, but despite its geographical limitations was stocked with some of the best players in the country. After pulling off a coup by signing the Original Celtics, the NBL brashly raided ABL rosters for additional players.

The Brooklyn Arcadians were particularly hard hit, losing stars Red Conaty and Rody Cooney, while Washington lost starters Teddy Kearns and Bob Grody. Washington owner George Preston Marshall completed the destruction of the Arcadians by luring Elmer Ripley and Tillie Voss away from the Brooklyn club to fill the gaps in his lineup left by the National League raids. The newcomers joined Rusty Saunders, Ray Kennedy and George Glasco to restore Marshall’s Palace Five club to its place among the ABL pre-season favorites. Cleveland returned with championship squad intact and further strengthened by the addition of Ohio State rookie Cookie Cunningham and valuable swingman Gil Ely. With Brooklyn out of the picture, Gottlieb’s new Philadelphia entry became the third contender. The Quakers (later known as the Warriors) showcased a Who’s Who of former Eastern League stars including George Artus, Tom Barlow, Stretch Meehan, Soup Campbell, and Chickie Passon.

Three weeks into the new season, the favorites were all performing up to expectations, but the league had serious problems at the other end of the standings. Brooklyn, Detroit and Baltimore were all winless and showing few signs of improvement. President Carr acted quickly and ruthlessly to solve the dilemma. First, he moved to destroy the foundation of the upstart National League, by secretly negotiating with the Celtics to jump to the ABL. As anticipated, the Celtics&#x27; departure triggered an immediate collapse of the rival league. Next, Carr expelled the Detroit and Brooklyn clubs from the ABL, and then awarded the latter franchise to the incoming Celtics. Finally, he bolstered the Baltimore franchise with players from the suddenly defunct NBL. In a single stroke, Carr had signed basketball’s most famous team, thwarted the upstart NBL, and provided his league with an additional pool of dozens of top players.

The Original Celtics quickly waded into the race for first-half honors of the ABL, winning 13 of 16 games, but the 0–5 record they were forced to inherit from the Arcadians was impossible to overcome. Cleveland captured first place by one game over Washington with Philadelphia in third and the Celtics in fourth place. Starting with a fresh slate, the Celtics quickly took charge of the second half of the season with nine straight victories. Fort Wayne, which had been a major beneficiary at mid-season of National League players, finished second. The most important addition to the Indiana club was Benny Borgmann, who quickly established him as the league’s premier offensive star. Washington and Philadelphia followed in third and fourth place, while first-half winner Cleveland slumped badly to fifth place. Cleveland&#x27;s fall was precipitated by the hasty mid-season departure of star Honey Russell, who was exiled to Chicago after a disagreement with team owner Max Rosenblum. The Celtics easily disposed of the weakened Cleveland team in three straight games to take the ABL championship.

In 1926, the American Basketball League, developed by sports entrepreneur George Preston Marshall, effectively railroaded the team into joining its ranks by prohibiting member teams from playing against them. The Original Celtics responded by winning the next two ABL titles. During their first full season in the ABL, their dominance was so absolute that fans in other cities took up the cry, &quot;Break up the Celtics!&quot; In response, the league disbanded the Celtics and apportioned their players to the other teams. The strategy backfired as game attendance plummeted and, further deflated by the Great Depression, the ABL folded after the 1931 season.

During the 1926–27 season, the team replaced the Brooklyn Arcadians after five games and took the name Brooklyn Celtics. By the next season, they had returned to the name, New York Celtics. After winning back-to-back ABL championships in 1926–27 and 1927–28, the team was broken up. An attempt to return the team for the 1929–30 season failed, and the team dropped out of the league during the first half on December 10, 1929. Later the team, sponsored by popular singer Kate Smith, also played in the ABL in the 1936–37 and 1937–38 as New York Celtics and in 1938–39 as Kingston Colonials; in this last year with the ABL, they won the regular season but lost in playoffs.

==Mid-1930s: Travelling team==
The Original Celtics briefly reorganized as a barnstorming team in the 1930s, but never replicated their initial glory.

<text>Cava de&#x27; Tirreni (; Cilentan: &quot;A Càva&quot;) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in the region of Campania, Italy, in the province of Salerno, northwest of the town of Salerno. It lies in a richly cultivated valley surrounded by wooded hills, and is a popular tourist resort. The abbey of La Trinità della Cava is located there.

== Geography ==

=== Overview ===
Cava de&#x27; Tirreni lies among the hills close to the Tyrrhenian Sea, north of the Amalfi Coast and serving in practice as its northern gateway. The inhabited area is 198 m above sea level, in a valley situated between two mountain groups: the Lattari Mountains (which separate Cava from the Amalfi Coast) to the west and the Picentini Mountains to the east. Many of Cava&#x27;s citizens reside in the hills surrounding the town.

Cava is bordered to the north by Nocera Superiore, Roccapiemonte and Mercato San Severino; to the east by Baronissi, Pellezzano and Salerno; to the south by Vietri sul Mare and Maiori; and to the west by Tramonti. The town is a link between the geographical area of Agro Nocerino Sarnese (flat, with an agricultural and industrial economy) and the Sorrento Peninsula (mountainous, with an economy based on tourism).

=== &quot;Frazioni&quot; ===
The of Cava are: Alessia, Annunziata, Arcara, Casaburi-Rotolo, Castagneto, Corpo di Cava, Croce, Dupino, Marini, Passiano, Pregiato, San Cesareo, San Pietro, Sant&#x27;Anna, Sant&#x27;Arcangelo, San Martino, Santa Lucia, Santa Maria del Rovo, Santi Quaranta.

== History ==
The town, initially comprehending present-day Vietri sul Mare, was founded by the Etruscans with the name of Marcina, as part of a colonial system known as &quot;Etruria Campana&quot;. The modern name Cava de&#x27; Tirreni ( &#x27;Cave of the Tyrrhenians&#x27;) is a tribute to the Etruscan heritage of the area.
The church and the greater part of the abbey buildings were entirely modernized in 1796. The old Gothic cloisters are preserved. The church contains a fine organ and several ancient sarcophagi. The archives, now national property, include fine &quot;incunabula&quot;, documents and manuscripts of great value (including the &quot;Codex Legum Longobardorum&quot; of 1004 and the La Cava Bible).

== Main sights ==

*Abbey of La Trinità della Cava, founded in 1011. Features include the ambon with mosaics (12th century), the grotto of St. Alferius, the Romanesque cloister (13th century) and the large library, housing more than 50,000 volumes.
*Cathedral (&quot;Duomo&quot;), begun in 1517 and opened in 1571.
*Sanctuary of St. Francis and St. Anthony, an early 16th-century structure restored after the 1980 earthquake had damaged it. The façade is in tuff and travertine, with three large arches, the central one surmounted by a balcony. The main portal has a series of friezes sculpted in 1528 by local masters and containing scenes from the Gospels. The belltower, with three orders, was finished in 1584. The interior is on the Latin Cross plan, with some 16th-century frescoes by Belisario Corenzio in the sacristy.

<doc id="936339" wikidata="Q497904" url="?curid=936339" title="Rostislav I of Kiev">
<text>Rostislav Mstislavich ( – 1167) was Prince of Smolensk (1125–1160), Novgorod (1154) and Grand Prince of Kiev (1154–1155; 1159–1161; 1161–1167). He is the founder of the Rostislavichi branch of Rurikid princes in Smolensk. He was the son of Mstislav I of Kiev and Christina Ingesdotter of Sweden.

==Reign==
After Yaroslav II of Kiev was driven out of Novgorod, Rostislav was invited to become the ruler of Novgorod. He accepted, and became the prince on April 17, 1154. Then, learning that Iziaslav II had died, Rostislav left Novgorod to take the Kievan throne. Indignant that their prince had abandoned them and angered that &quot;he did not make order among them, but tore them more apart&quot;, the citizens of Novgorod drove out Rostislav&#x27;s son, Davyd, who was their governor. They replaced him with Mstislav Yurievich, the son of Yury Dolgoruky.

Rostislav ruled Kiev for one week before Iziaslav III of Kiev forced him to flee to Chernigov .

== Issue ==
Rostislav had four sons:
* Davyd Rostislavich, prince of Smolensk (1180–1197);
* Mstislav Rostislavich, prince of Smolensk (1175–1177);
* Roman I of Kiev, prince of Smolensk (1160–1172; 1177–1180), prince of Kiev (1171–1173; 1175–1177); and 
* Rurik Rostislavich, prince of Belgorod (1173–1194), intermittently prince of Kiev.

He also had two daughters:
* Elena Rostislavna of Kiev-Smolensk (died 1204); and 
* Agrafena Rostislavna (died 1237).

<text>Sotalol, sold under the brand name Betapace among others, is a medication used to treat and prevent abnormal heart rhythms. Evidence does not support a decreased risk of death with long term use. It is taken by mouth or given by injection into a vein.
Common side effects include a slow heart rate, chest pain, low blood pressure, feeling tired, dizziness, shortness of breath, problems seeing, vomiting, and swelling. Other serious side effects may include QT prolongation, heart failure, or bronchospasm. Sotalol is a non-selective β-adrenergic receptor blocker which has both class II and class III antiarrhythmic properties.
Sotalol was first described in 1964 and came into medical use in 1974. It is available as a generic medication. In 2020, it was the 296th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 1million prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), sotalol can be validly used to maintain a normal heart rhythm in people with life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias (e.g., ventricular tachycardia), or very symptomatic atrial fibrillation or flutter. Due to the risk of serious side effects, the FDA states that sotalol should generally be reserved for people whose ventricular arrhythmias are life-threatening, or whose fibrillation/flutter cannot be resolved using the Valsalva maneuver or another simple method. Sotalol has shown some potential efficacy against symptoms of essential tremor due to its binding to the β2-adrenergic receptor but this remains an off-label use.

==Contraindications==
According to the FDA, sotalol should not be used in people with a waking heart rate lower than 50 beats per minute. It should not be used in people with sick sinus syndrome, long QT syndrome, cardiogenic shock, uncontrolled heart failure, asthma or a related bronchospastic condition, or people with serum potassium below 4 meq/L. It should only be used in people with a second and third degree AV block if a functioning pacemaker is present.

Since sotalol is removed from the body through the kidneys, it should not be used in people with a creatinine clearance rate below 40 mL/min. It is also excreted in breast milk, so mothers should not breastfeed while taking sotalol.

Since sotalol prolongs the QT interval, the FDA recommends against using it in conjunction with other medications that prolong the QT interval. Studies have found serious side effects to be more common in individuals also taking digoxin, possibly because of pre-existing heart failure in those people. As with other beta blockers, it may interact with calcium channel blockers, catecholamine-depleting drugs, insulin or antidiabetic drugs, β2-adrenergic receptor agonists, and clonidine.

Some evidence suggests that sotalol should be avoided in the setting of heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (resulting in the heart squeezing little blood out into the circulation with each pump) due to an increased risk of death.

==Adverse effects==
Over 10% of oral sotalol users experience fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, headache, weakness, nausea, shortness of breath, bradycardia (slow heart rate), a sensation of the heart beating too hard, fast, or irregularly, or chest pain. Higher doses of sotalol increase the risk for all of these possible side effects.

In rare cases, the QT prolongation caused by sotalol can lead to the development of life-threatening torsade de pointes (TdP) polymorphic ventricular tachycardia. Across several clinical trials, 0.6% of oral sotalol patients with supraventricular abnormal heart rhythms (such as atrial fibrillation) developed TdP. For patients who had a history of sustained ventricular tachycardia (abnormal rhythm lasting more than 30 seconds), 4% developed TdP. Risk increases with dosage, female sex, or having a history of an enlarged heart or congestive heart failure. The incidence of TdP for sustained ventricular tachycardia patients was 0% with an 80 mg daily dose, 0.5% at 160 mg, 1.6% at 320 mg, 4.4% at 480 mg, 3.7% at 640 mg, and 5.8% at doses greater than 640 mg. Due to this risk, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires affected individuals to be hospitalized for at least three days in a facility that can provide cardiac resuscitation and continuous electrocardiographic monitoring upon starting or restarting sotalol.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanisms of action===

====Beta-blocker action====
Sotalol is a beta blocker and non-selectively binds to both β1- and β2-adrenergic receptors preventing activation of the receptors by their stimulatory ligand (catecholamines). It has no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity.

Without the binding of catecholamines to the β-adrenergic receptor, the G protein complex associated with the receptor cannot activate production of cyclic AMP, which is responsible for turning on calcium inflow channels. A decrease in activation of calcium channels will therefore result in a decrease in intracellular calcium. In heart cells, calcium is important in generating electrical signals for heart muscle contraction, as well as generating force for this contraction. In consideration of these important properties of calcium, two conclusions can be drawn. First, with less calcium in the cell, there is a decrease in electrical signals for contraction, thus allowing time for the heart&#x27;s natural pacemaker to rectify arrhythmic contractions. Secondly, lower calcium means a decrease in strength and rate of the contractions, which can be helpful in treatment of abnormally fast heart rates.

====Type III antiarrhythmic action====
Sotalol also acts on potassium channels and causes a delay in relaxation of the ventricles. By blocking these potassium channels, sotalol inhibits efflux of K+ ions, which results in an increase in the time before another electrical signal can be generated in ventricular myocytes. This increase in the period before a new signal for contraction is generated, helps to correct arrhythmias by reducing the potential for premature or abnormal contraction of the ventricles but also prolongs the frequency of ventricular contraction to help treat tachycardia.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Sotalol is classified as a beta blocker with low lipophilicity and hence lower potential for crossing the blood–brain barrier. This in turn may result in fewer effects in the central nervous system as well as a lower risk of neuropsychiatric side effects.

==History==
Sotalol was first synthesized in 1960 by A. A. Larsen of Mead-Johnson Pharmaceutical. It was originally recognized for its blood pressure lowering effects and its ability to reduce the symptoms of angina. It was made available in the United Kingdom and France in 1974, Germany in 1975, and Sweden in 1979. It became widely used in the 1980s. In the 1980s, its antiarrhythmic properties were discovered. The United States approved the drug in 1992.

==Society and culture==

===Brand names===
Trade names for Sotalol include Betapace and Betapace AF (Berlex Laboratories), Sotalex and Sotacor (Bristol-Myers Squibb), and Sotylize (Arbor Pharmaceuticals).

<text>Messier 72 (also known as M72 or NGC 6981) is a globular cluster in the south west of the very mildly southern constellation of Aquarius.

==Observational history and guide==
M72 was discovered by astronomer Pierre Méchain in 1780. His countryman Charles Messier looked for it 36 days later, and included it in his catalog. Both opted for the then-dominant of the competing terms for such objects, considering it a faint nebula rather than a cluster. With a larger instrument, astronomer John Herschel called it a bright &quot;cluster of stars of a round figure&quot;. Astronomer Harlow Shapley noted a similarity to Messier 4 and 12.

It is visible in a good night sky as a faint nebula in a telescope with a aperture. The surrounding field stars become visible from a -aperture device. One of will allow measurement of an angular diameter of 2.5 . At the core is clear: its 1.25  diameter, meaning a broad spread; and small parts scarcer in stars to the south and east.

==Properties==
Based upon a 2011 census of variable stars, the cluster is away from the Sun. It has an estimated combined mass of 168,000 solar masses () and is around 9.5 billion years old. The core region has a density of stars that is radiating 2.26 times solar luminosity () per cubic parsec. There are 43 identified variable stars in the cluster.

<text>Otter Creek Outdoor Recreation Area (formerly Otter Creek Park) is a 2,600 acre (11 km2) riverfront park in Meade County, Kentucky. The park is located near Muldraugh and Fort Knox, along State Highway 1638, near U.S. 31W. Although it is located outside Louisville, the park was long operated by the city of Louisville and, after the 2003 merger of the city and Jefferson County, Louisville Metro Government. Both entities attempted to give or sell the park to Meade County and the Commonwealth of Kentucky at various times over the years, most recently in 2004. The park closed in 2009 and reopened in 2011. It is now operated by the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources.

==About the park==
The park&#x27;s namesake, Otter Creek, winds along the eastern side of the park. A scenic bend in the Ohio River, which divides Kentucky from Indiana, can be seen from northern overlooks within the park.

The park is located in the Pennyrile, a geographic division of Kentucky known for its cave-forming limestones. An historic centerpiece of the park is Morgan&#x27;s Cave, a cave with an actively flowing stream that was reputed to be a hideaway for Morgan&#x27;s Raiders during the Civil War. The cave is now kept locked for the protection of the bat population that lives in it. Limestone bluffs line Otter Creek and the Ohio River frontage.

==History==
The parkland was given to Louisville by the U.S. Government in 1947, in recognition of the city&#x27;s service during World War II. A master plan for the park, calling for the removal of outdated facilities and the development of new amenities, was adopted in 2001.

On December 1, 2008, Louisville Metro announced that the park, which loses $500,000 annually, would close to the public on December 14, 2008, due to budget cuts. This closing date was quickly amended to January 1. According to Louisville Metro Parks, events booked at the Conference Center would be honored through June 2009, but none after. A day later, the state&#x27;s Department of Fish &amp; Wildlife Resources proposed taking over the park to operate it as a wildlife-management area, which would involve lifting a ban on hunting and fishing.

On June 16, 2010, Gov. Steve Beshear and Louisville Metro Mayor Jerry Abramson announced that Otter Creek Park would reopen in 2011 as an outdoor recreational area operated by the Kentucky Department of Fish and Wildlife Resources, an agency of the Tourism, Arts and Heritage Cabinet. Otter Creek officially reopened on May 11, 2011, but several facilities in need of repair and renovation, notably the Nature Center and Conference Center, remained closed. At that time, overnight cabins were not available; primitive and RV camping was made available when an outside vendor was located. New cabins have since been built and are now available for use.

<text>Mstislav II Iziaslavich (died 19 August 1170) was Grand Prince of Kiev from 1158 to 1159 and again from 1167 to 1169.

==Life==
Mstislav was the son of Grand Prince Iziaslav II of Kiev. Along with his father, he participated in the wars against Yury Dolgoruky and the Chernigov princes. After an initial victory against the Cumans in 1153, Mstislav was defeated by the Cumans at the Psel river. Yury Dolgoruky forced him to flee to Poland in 1155, but the next year Mstislav returned with a new army and defeated Dolgoruky at Vladimir-Volynsk. Dolgoruky died in 1157, and Mstislav had himself crowned at Vladimir.

In 1169, Kiev was sacked by Andrey Bogolyubsky who removed Mstislav as grand prince. In March 1169, he defended Kiev from the troops of Prince Andrey Bogolyubsky, but was forced to leave the city and retreat to Volhynia. In 1170, he retook Kiev. He died in Vladimir and was buried in the Cathedral of the Holy Mother of God.

==Family==
In 1151, Mstislav married Agnes, the daughter of Duke Bolesław III of Poland. They had:
# Roman, Prince of Novgorod (–1205)
# Sviatoslav, Prince of Brest
# Vsevolod Mstislavich of Volhynia (died 1196)

<doc id="936363" wikidata="Q1262565" url="?curid=936363" title="DualShock">
<text>The DualShock (originally Dual Shock, trademarked as DUALSHOCK or DUAL SHOCK, with the PlayStation 5 version as DualSense) is a line of gamepads developed by Sony Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation family of video game consoles. It is named for vibration-feedback and analog controls. Introduced in November 1997, it was initially marketed as a secondary peripheral for the first PlayStation console. The console&#x27;s bundle was updated to include DualShock, and phase out the original PlayStation controller and the Dual Analog Controller. The DualShock is the best-selling gamepad of all time by units sold, excluding bundled controllers.

== DualShock ==
Introduced in late 1997, the DualShock Analog Controller (SCPH-1200) can provide vibration feedback based on game activity, as well as input through two analog sticks. Its name derives from its dual vibration motors. These motors are housed within the handles, with the left one being larger and more powerful than the one on the right, so to allow for varying levels of vibration. Nintendo 64&#x27;s Rumble Pak has only one motor and has battery power, but all corded varieties of the DualShock are powered by the PlayStation. The rumble feature of the DualShock is similar to that of the Japanese version of the Dual Analog Controller released a few months earlier, a feature that was removed shortly after that controller was released.

The DualShock, like its predecessor the Dual Analog controller, has two analog sticks. Unlike the previous controller, the DualShock&#x27;s analog sticks feature textured rubber grips with convex domed caps rather than the smooth plastic tips with recessed concave grooves found on the Dual Analog controller. Other visible differences between the Dual Analog and the DualShock include the longer grips and handles of the former and slightly larger L2/R2 buttons on the latter. The Dual Analog controller also has an additional mode accessible by pressing the &quot;Analog&quot; button again after pressing it once that provides compatibility with the PlayStation Analog Joystick, indicated by a green light on the analog indicator light rather than red; this feature was not carried over to the DualShock.

The DualShock and all of its subsequent controllers includes a directional pad, Start and Select buttons, four face buttons, and four shoulder buttons, all of which were first introduced in the original PlayStation controller. The face buttons in particular use simple geometric shapes instead of letters or numbers, which includes a green triangle, a red circle, a blue cross, and a pink square . These shapes established a trademark that was heavily incorporated into the PlayStation brand. The designer of the original PlayStation controller, Teiyu Goto, explained the meaning behind the symbols: the circle and cross were made to represent &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; respectively (as common in Japanese culture, and thus were typically used for &quot;confirm&quot; and &quot;cancel&quot; in most PlayStation games in Japan respectively, placed in the same way as the A and B buttons on the Super NES controller with similar functions), while the triangle symbolizes a point of view and the square is equated to a sheet of paper there to be used to access menus. In Western releases, the circle and cross functions are often switched (circle to cancel, cross to confirm) or reassigned to a different button (cross to confirm, triangle to cancel).

The DualShock controller is widely supported; shortly after its launch most new games, including &quot;Waku Waku Puyo Puyo Dungeon&quot;, &quot;Crash Bandicoot: Warped&quot;, &quot;Spyro the Dragon&quot;, and &quot;Tekken 3&quot; include support for the vibration feature and dual analog sticks, and Capcom re-released &quot;Resident Evil: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot; and &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot; with support for the controller added to these newer versions. Some games designed for the Dual Analog&#x27;s vibration capability, such as &quot;Porsche Challenge&quot; and &quot;Crash Bandicoot 2&quot;, also work. Many games take advantage of the presence of two motors to provide vibration effects in stereo including &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; and the PlayStation port of &quot;Quake II&quot;. Released in 1999, the PlayStation hit &quot;Ape Escape&quot; is the first game to explicitly require DualShock/Dual-Analog-type controllers, with its gameplay requiring the use of both analog sticks.

In 2000, the PS one (a redesigned version of the original PlayStation) was released with a slightly redesigned DualShock Controller (SCPH-110). This controller was similar to the first one, except with a &quot;PSone&quot; word mark replacing &quot;PlayStation&quot; underneath the logo, a purple hue on the buttons and sticks to match the color scheme of the PSone, a semicircle-shaped connector, and multiple color options for the body.

The DualShock is compatible with the PlayStation 2, as it uses the same connector and protocol as the original PlayStation console. This is due to the console&#x27;s backward compatibility with original PlayStation peripherals. However, certain PS2 games that utilize the DualShock 2&#x27;s analog buttons such as &quot;Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas&quot; and &quot;The Bouncer&quot; are not compatible with the DualShock.

== DualShock 2 ==
The DualShock 2 Analog Controller (SCPH-10010 or SCPH-97026) included with PlayStation 2&#x27;s launch is almost identical externally as the previous DualShock analog controller, with a few minor cosmetic changes. It has different screw positioning and one fewer screw. A blue DualShock 2 logo was added to the top of the controller, the connector is more square than the DualShock, and both the cable and connector are black rather than grey. The standard controller is black (other colors came later), rather than grey as with the original DualShock. The analog sticks are stiffer than on the original DualShock.

Internally, the DualShock 2 is lighter and all of the buttons (except for the Analog mode, start, select, L3 and R3 buttons) are readable as analog values (pressure-sensitive). The DualShock 2 can sense 256 levels of pressure.

The DualShock 2 has been made available in various colors: Black, satin silver, ceramic white, slate grey, clear, ocean blue, emerald green, crimson red, lemon yellow, and candy pink.

A number of coin-operated arcade cabinets have included controller ports for connecting DualShock or DualShock 2 controllers, including Namco&#x27;s Tekken 5 and Konami&#x27;s Winning Eleven Arcade Championship 2012.

The original PlayStation is forward compatible with the DualShock 2. The PlayStation 3 is backward compatible with the DualShock and DualShock 2 by the use of third party peripherals, which connect the controller to the console via a USB port. However, the DualShock and DualShock 2 will not work properly with games that require Sixaxis functionality, such as &quot;Heavy Rain&quot;.
== DualShock 3 ==

The DualShock 3 wireless controller (SCPH-98050/CECHZC2) is a gamepad for the PlayStation 3, and was announced at the 2007 Tokyo Game Show. It succeeds the Sixaxis wireless controller originally released with earlier versions of the console. The DualShock 3 is nearly identical to the previous Sixaxis version but adds the haptic feedback capabilities found in the DualShock and DualShock 2. Sony settled a patent infringement lawsuit with Immersion in March 2007 following a lengthy legal battle. The settlement cleared the way for incorporating the vibration feature that the Sixaxis lacks. Both the vibration function and motion-sensing capabilities of the DualShock 3 can be used simultaneously without one interfering with the other. Like the Sixaxis, it has a USB mini-B port for charging and can also be used on a PSP Go and the PlayStation TV via Bluetooth, though the controller and the PSP Go or the PlayStation TV must be registered using a PS3 console.

The DualShock 3 can be identified by its &quot;DualShock 3&quot; and &quot;Sixaxis&quot; markings. It also weighs , 40% more than its predecessor, the Sixaxis, which weighed only .

The rear markings indicate the original DualShock 3 draws up to 300 mA of current at 3.7 V for a power consumption of 1.11 W, an order of magnitude increase from the 30 mA of current at 3.7 V (0.111 W) listed on the Sixaxis. However, this current is not drawn constantly and is the maximum current when the rumble is active. Its main power source is an internal 3.7 V Li-ion battery tentatively capable of storing 570 mAh, which provides up to 30 hours of continuous gaming on a full charge. Third party replacement batteries are also available. Like the Sixaxis, the DualShock 3 comes with instructions on how to remove and replace the battery. The DualShock 3 can also draw power over a USB cable via a USB mini-B connector on the top of the controller. This allows the controller to be used when the battery is low and is also used for charging the battery. When connected via USB, the controller communicates with the console through the USB cable, rather than Bluetooth.

Along with the release of the &#x27;slim&#x27; model PS3, Sony released a new version of the DualShock 3 (A1) which uses 5.0 V at 500 mA while connected, but still contains a 3.7 V battery. This revision of the DualShock 3 does away with the additional plastic brackets between the L1/R1 buttons and the L2/R2 triggers (increasing controller rigidity), has indicator lights soldered directly to the board, and comes in slightly revised color schemes.

While the DualShock 3 is compatible with any standard USB mini-B cable and many USB chargers, official charging cables are available from Sony. These include an official cable, the USB 2.0 Cable Pack and a wall charger, the AC adapter charging kit. Any third-party USB charger used must act as a USB host device, rather than simply providing power over the appropriate pins, since both the Sixaxis and DualShock 3 require a host signal to &quot;wake up&quot; and begin charging.

A Sony representative confirmed on April 2, 2008, that the original Sixaxis controller would officially be discontinued with the release of the haptic-feedback enabled DualShock 3 in mid-April 2008. The Sixaxis was no longer produced after 2008, being dropped from stock by most retailers.

===Variations===
The DualShock 3 has been produced in various colors: black, satin silver, ceramic white, classic white, metallic blue, deep red, pink, &quot;jungle green&quot; (olive), &quot;candy blue&quot; (light blue), &quot;urban camouflage&quot; (three-color digital camouflage), &quot;crimson red&quot; (transparent red), and &quot;cosmic blue&quot; (transparent blue). Not all colors have been made available in all markets or at all times.

Additional colors have been released alongside limited edition consoles, including gun-metal grey and &quot;cloud black&quot; (dark grey).

A limited edition baseball themed DualShock 3 controller was released on March 8, 2011, to coincide with the release of &quot;MLB 11: The Show&quot;. Another color, &quot;Metallic Gold&quot;, became available in June 2012 as a limited edition in Europe, and in North America it is sold exclusively in GameStop from October 2012. A limited edition &quot;God of War: Ascension&quot; controller is available in the UK as part of a console bundle to coincide with the launch of the game and in the Americas as a game and controller bundle. On November 1, 2013, Sony announced a new transparent Crystal model of the DualShock 3 controller in Japan.

== DualShock 4 ==


The DualShock 4 (CUH-ZCT1 or CUH-ZCT2) is the PlayStation 4&#x27;s controller. It has several new features from DualShock 3. One new feature is a built-in two-point capacitive touch pad on the front of the controller, which can be clicked. This allows the touch pad to represent multiple buttons, as demonstrated in the PS4 version of &quot;Elite Dangerous&quot; in which the four corners of the touch pad can be mapped to a separate clickable actions. The controller supports motion detection via a three-axis gyroscope and three-axis accelerometer and vibration. It includes a non-removable, rechargeable 3.7 V, 1000 mAh lithium-ion battery, which can be charged while the system is in rest mode. It weighs and has dimensions of .
The front of the controller features a light bar containing three LEDs that, when lit in conjunction, cause the light bar to glow a variety of colors. Developed for PlayStation VR, it can be used to identify players by matching the colors of the characters they control in a game, or to provide enhanced feedback or immersion by changing patterns or colors in reaction to gameplay. An early example of this is displayed in the game &quot;Grand Theft Auto V&quot;; the light bar will flash red and blue when the player is wanted by the police, simulating the flashing lights of a police car. The light bar is also used in conjunction with the PlayStation Camera to judge the positions and movements of multiple players.
The controller features several input and output connectors: a stereo headset jack (3.5 mm CTIA TRRS connector), a micro-USB port, and an extension port. It can be charged using the console, using a dedicated charging station, or via microUSB using a standalone charger. It also includes a mono speaker, like the Wii Remote, and is the second major controller in video game history to have such feature.
The DualShock 4 features the following buttons: PS button, SHARE button, OPTIONS button, directional buttons, action buttons (triangle, circle, cross, square), shoulder buttons (R1/L1), triggers (R2/L2), analog stick click buttons (L3/R3), and a touch pad click button. These mark several changes from the DualShock 3 and other previous PlayStation controllers. The START and SELECT buttons have been merged into a single OPTIONS button. A dedicated SHARE button allows players to upload screenshots and videos from their gameplay experiences. The joysticks and triggers have been redesigned based on developer input, with the ridged surface of the joysticks now featuring an outer ring surrounding the convex dome caps. This gave the analog sticks a more concave-like appearance; a similar yet different design can also be seen on the DualShock&#x27;s predecessor, the Dual Analog Controller in early 1997, which had plastic concave analog sticks.
The DualShock 4&#x27;s buttons differ slightly in functionality from the DualShock 3. Only the L2 and R2 triggers are pressure-sensitive, a change from the functionality of the DualShock 2 and 3. This is likely due to the fact that most games did not utilize these buttons as well as due to it not being used on competitors&#x27; controllers.
The PlayStation 3 is forward compatible with the DualShock 4 (originally only via a microUSB cable). Firmware update 4.60 for the PS3 adds wireless connectivity; however, motion and vibration functions are not supported. As the START and SELECT buttons are no longer present, the OPTIONS and SHARE buttons respectively replace them. The PS button does not work, thus requiring the console to be reset in order to go back to the menu. The DualShock 4 is also compatible with PS4 titles on PlayStation 5.

===Version issues and modifications===

Sony&#x27;s earlier DualShock 4 controllers (CUH-ZCT1 controllers) have wear issues with the rubber surface on both analog sticks which exhibited excessive wear or tearing after short-term use. In January 2014, Sony issued a statement acknowledging an issue on 10% of controllers.

On September 15, 2016, a second version of DualShock 4 controllers was released, the DualShock Version 2 (CUH-ZCT2), which hosts slight improvements over the original DualShock 4, including USB communication, improved triggers and joysticks, a longer battery life and the ability to see the light bar from the top of the touchpad.
In the first generation controller, the light bar is a permanently illuminated, bright-colored light. The needless light pollution and battery drain prompted inquiries as to whether the light bar could be switched off by users. Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida initially responded in the negative in July 2013, though game developers have the option to disable the light in game. In early 2014, the company announced that a future update would allow the light bar to be dimmed, which was delivered in 1.70 in April 2014.

===Variations===

==== Tincture ====
The original DualShock 4 (CUH-ZCT1) is available in Jet Black, Glacier White, Urban Camouflage, Wave Blue (black back), Magma Red (black back), Gold, Silver, and Steel Black.

The newer DualShock 4 (CUH-ZCT2) has been produced in Jet Black, Glacier White, Green Camouflage, Blue Camouflage, Red Camouflage, Rose Gold, Electric Purple, Wave Blue (blue back), Magma Red (red back), Gold, Silver, Sunset Orange, Crystal, Red Crystal, Blue Crystal, Steel Black, Midnight Blue, Metallic Copper, Alpine Green, and Berry Blue.

==== Generations ====
Several versions of the DualShock 4 controller were released.
Exclusive console bundles with DualShock 4 include the 20th Anniversary Edition, &quot;Gun Metal&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: Black Ops III&quot;, &quot;Uncharted 4: A Thief&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;Star Wars Battlefront&quot;, &quot;Monster Hunter World&quot;, &quot;God of War&quot;, &quot;Gran Turismo Sport&quot;, &quot;Call of Duty: World War II&quot;, &quot;The Days of Play&quot;, &quot;Marvel&#x27;s Spider-Man&quot;, &quot;Death Stranding&quot;, &quot;The Last of Us Part II&quot;, and the 500 Million Limited Edition PS4 Pro.
==DualSense==
The DualSense (CFI-ZCT1W) is the PlayStation 5&#x27;s controller. Unveiled on April 7, 2020, It is based on the DualShock 4 controller; changes to its design and capabilities were influenced by discussions with game designers and players. It weighs and has dimensions of .

The DualSense is primarily white with black facing. Its monochrome action buttons are the first non-colored action buttons for a standard PlayStation controller. (Sony&#x27;s handheld consoles, the PlayStation Vita and PlayStation Portable, had monochrome buttons.) Its more ergonomic design is bigger, rounder, and heftier than the DualShock 4. The light bar has been moved from the top of the controller to the horizontal edges of the touchpad; player number is indicated by five LEDs below the touchpad. The &quot;Share&quot; button has been replaced with &quot;Create&quot; to emphasize creating content to share. The black plastic piece surrounding the analog sticks can be removed without tools.

The DualSense supports vibrotactile haptic through voice coil actuators in the palm grips, and the analog triggers (dubbed &quot;adaptive triggers&quot;) now have a force feedback mechanism provided by two DC rotary motors. The actuators enable games to provide varied feedback, such as feeling the wind and sand in a sandstorm. The adaptive triggers provide varying levels of resistance to the user depending on game actions. An example provided by Sony is being able to feel the tension of a bow string as the user pulls the trigger.

Connectivity includes a 3.5 mm audio jack; USB-C, which replaces the microUSB port on the DualShock 4; and copper pins for use with charging docks.
The controller speaker provides a clearer sound. The controller also has a dual-microphone array, allowing players to communicate without an external headset and enabling Sony to introduce voice typing to the PS5. The rechargable lithium-ion battery has more capacity (3.65 V, 1560 mAh).

=== DualSense Edge ===

Unveiled in August 2022, the DualSense Edge (CFI-ZCP1) is a new controller for the PlayStation 5 with more capabilities. It was released on January 26, 2023 on PlayStation Direct, then sold through other retailers beginning on February 23, 2023.

The DualSense Edge has a more modular design than the DualSense, featuring replaceable analog stick modules, interchangeable analog stick caps (standard DualSense caps, and high- and low-convex dome caps resembling earlier DualShock analog sticks prior to the DualShock 4) and rear paddle buttons, adjustable trigger lengths, multiple control profiles as well as customizable mapping inputs. It also includes a lockable braided USB-C cable.

===Legal issues===
The DualSense has become a subject of a class-action lawsuit due to a perceived drift in one of the analog sticks, being litigated by the same firm that is challenging Nintendo for a similar drift issue in its Joy-Con controllers for the Nintendo Switch.

=== Microtexture ===
As a hidden easter egg, the DualSense has a unique microtexture. There are 40,000 tiny symbols stacked on top of each other, consisting of the four PlayStation button symbols (triangle, circle, cross, square). Multiple designs were hand-drawn, digitized, and made as prototypes before the design team settled on the current design. The larger symbols are half a millimeter wide. Sean Hollister, for &quot;The Verge&quot;, wrote an article examining the microtexture and its creation:
The company decided to apply a microtexture to the DualSense controller&#x27;s entire lower shell [making it] Sony&#x27;s most grippable gamepad yet because of the thousands upon thousands of tiny squares, triangles, circles, and crosses literally at your fingertips. ... These tiny symbols are stacked on top of each other, jutting out in three dimensions. They&#x27;re not a single, evenly spaced layer at all ... Morisawa, the senior art director of Sony&#x27;s Design Center product design group, explains that a variety of designs were handcrafted, digitized, mocked up, applied to actual prototype gamepads, and tested over and over again until the teams found the balance they wanted: good-looking, textured enough to be comfortable and non-slip, but not so sandpaper-rough that it&#x27;d hurt your hands over a lengthy gaming session.
In the same article, Hollister mentions that the one downside to the microtexture is that &quot;it picks up dirt extremely easily and doesn&#x27;t want to let go&quot;.

===Variations===
The DualSense has been produced in various colors: White, Cosmic Red, Midnight Black, Galactic Purple, Nova Pink, Starlight Blue, Gray Camouflage, Cobalt Blue, Volcanic Red, Sterling Silver, Chroma Indigo, Chroma Pearl, &amp; Chroma Teal. Sony has also released limited/special editions of the DualSense, which includes &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot;, &quot;Hogwarts Legacy&quot;, LeBron James, &quot;Final Fantasy XVI&quot; (Japan Only), &quot;Marvel’s Spider-Man 2&quot;, &quot;Concord&quot; (US Only), &quot;Astro Bot, Fortnite, 30th Anniversary, Helldivers 2 &amp; Monster Hunter Wilds (Japan Only).&quot;

==Third-party software==
Various other software can be used to allow the use of DualShock 3, DualShock 4, and DualSense controllers on PCs.

===DS4Windows===
DS4Windows is an open-source software application that allows various PlayStation controllers to be used on PCs running versions of Microsoft Windows up to 11 by emulating a virtual Xbox or DualShock 4 controller. Specifically, this is relevant for DualShock 3, DualShock 4 and DualSense controllers, enabling them to function effectively on PC platforms. The software supports key remapping and rebinding, allowing for customization of controller settings for games that do not natively support PlayStation controllers. DS4Windows features both USB and Bluetooth connectivity and offers customizable profiles for gamepad settings.

DS4Windows is significant in the discussion of DualShock controllers due to its widespread use in the PC gaming community. It demonstrates the versatility and adaptability of these gamepads in various gaming environments, extending their use beyond the intended PlayStation consoles.

While primarily made for PlayStation controllers such as the DualShock, various Nintendo controllers including the Switch&#x27;s Joy-Con and Switch Pro controllers are also supported by the software, allowing them to be played on PCs outside of their respective consoles. Other third-party controllers for the PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 are also compatible with varying levels of compatibility.

==Reception==
The DualShock controller was given an Emmy Award for &quot;Peripheral Development and Technological Impact of Video Game Controllers&quot; by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences on January 8, 2007.

<text>In abstract algebra, a Jordan algebra is a nonassociative algebra over a field whose multiplication satisfies the following axioms:

# formula_1 (commutative law)
# formula_2 ().

The product of two elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; in a Jordan algebra is also denoted &quot;x&quot; ∘ &quot;y&quot;, particularly to avoid confusion with the product of a related associative algebra.

The axioms imply that a Jordan algebra is power-associative, meaning that formula_3 is independent of how we parenthesize this expression. They also imply that formula_4 for all positive integers &quot;m&quot; and &quot;n&quot;. Thus, we may equivalently define a Jordan algebra to be a commutative, power-associative algebra such that for any element formula_5, the operations of multiplying by powers formula_6 all commute.
Jordan algebras were introduced by in an effort to formalize the notion of an algebra of observables in quantum electrodynamics. It was soon shown that the algebras were not useful in this context, however they have since found many applications in mathematics. The algebras were originally called &quot;r-number systems&quot;, but were renamed &quot;Jordan algebras&quot; by , who began the systematic study of general Jordan algebras.

==Special Jordan algebras==

Notice first that an associative algebra is a Jordan algebra if and only if it is commutative. 

Given any associative algebra &quot;A&quot; (not of characteristic 2), one can construct a Jordan algebra &quot;A&quot;+ using the with same underlying addition and a new multiplication, the Jordan product defined by:
:formula_7

These Jordan algebras and their subalgebras are called special Jordan algebras, while all others are exceptional Jordan algebras. This construction is analogous to the Lie algebra associated to &quot;A&quot;, whose product (Lie bracket) is defined by the commutator formula_8.

The Shirshov–Cohn theorem states that any Jordan algebra with two generators is special. Related to this, Macdonald&#x27;s theorem states that any polynomial in three variables, having degree one in one of the variables, and which vanishes in every special Jordan algebra, vanishes in every Jordan algebra.

===Hermitian Jordan algebras===

If (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;σ&quot;) is an associative algebra with an involution &quot;σ&quot;, then if &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; and &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;y&quot; it follows that formula_9 Thus the set of all elements fixed by the involution (sometimes called the &quot;hermitian&quot; elements) form a subalgebra of &quot;A&quot;+, which is sometimes denoted H(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;σ&quot;).
==Examples==

1. The set of self-adjoint real, complex, or quaternionic matrices with multiplication

:formula_10

form a special Jordan algebra.

2. The set of 3×3 self-adjoint matrices over the octonions, again with multiplication

:formula_11

is a 27 dimensional, exceptional Jordan algebra (it is exceptional because the octonions are not associative). This was the first example of an Albert algebra. Its automorphism group is the exceptional Lie group F4. Since over the complex numbers this is the only simple exceptional Jordan algebra up to isomorphism, it is often referred to as &quot;the&quot; exceptional Jordan algebra. Over the real numbers there are three isomorphism classes of simple exceptional Jordan algebras.

==Derivations and structure algebra==

A derivation of a Jordan algebra &quot;A&quot; is an endomorphism &quot;D&quot; of &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;D&quot;(&quot;xy&quot;) = &quot;D&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)&quot;y&quot;+&quot;xD&quot;(&quot;y&quot;). The derivations form a Lie algebra der(&quot;A&quot;). The Jordan identity implies that if &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; are elements of &quot;A&quot;, then the endomorphism sending &quot;z&quot; to &quot;x&quot;(&quot;yz&quot;)−&quot;y&quot;(&quot;xz&quot;) is a derivation. Thus the direct sum of &quot;A&quot; and der(&quot;A&quot;) can be made into a Lie algebra, called the structure algebra of &quot;A&quot;, str(&quot;A&quot;).

A simple example is provided by the Hermitian Jordan algebras H(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;σ&quot;). In this case any element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;A&quot; with &quot;σ&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)=−&quot;x&quot; defines a derivation. In many important examples, the structure algebra of H(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;σ&quot;) is &quot;A&quot;.

Derivation and structure algebras also form part of Tits&#x27; construction of the Freudenthal magic square.

==Formally real Jordan algebras==

A (possibly nonassociative) algebra over the real numbers is said to be formally real if it satisfies the property that a sum of &quot;n&quot; squares can only vanish if each one vanishes individually. In 1932, Jordan attempted to axiomatize quantum theory by saying that the algebra of observables of any quantum system should be a formally real algebra that is commutative (&quot;xy&quot; = &quot;yx&quot;) and power-associative (the associative law holds for products involving only &quot;x&quot;, so that powers of any element &quot;x&quot; are unambiguously defined). He proved that any such algebra is a Jordan algebra.

Not every Jordan algebra is formally real, but classified the finite-dimensional formally real Jordan algebras, also called Euclidean Jordan algebras. Every formally real Jordan algebra can be written as a direct sum of so-called simple ones, which are not themselves direct sums in a nontrivial way. In finite dimensions, the simple formally real Jordan algebras come in four infinite families, together with one exceptional case:

* The Jordan algebra of &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; self-adjoint real matrices, as above.
* The Jordan algebra of &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; self-adjoint complex matrices, as above.
* The Jordan algebra of &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; self-adjoint quaternionic matrices. as above.

:where the right-hand side is defined using the usual inner product on R&quot;n&quot;. This is sometimes called a spin factor or a Jordan algebra of Clifford type.
* The Jordan algebra of 3×3 self-adjoint octonionic matrices, as above (an exceptional Jordan algebra called the Albert algebra).

Of these possibilities, so far it appears that nature makes use only of the &quot;n&quot;×&quot;n&quot; complex matrices as algebras of observables. However, the spin factors play a role in special relativity, and all the formally real Jordan algebras are related to projective geometry.

==Peirce decomposition==

If &quot;e&quot; is an idempotent in a Jordan algebra &quot;A&quot; (&quot;e&quot;2 = &quot;e&quot;) and &quot;R&quot; is the operation of multiplication by &quot;e&quot;, then
* &quot;R&quot;(2&quot;R&quot; − 1)(&quot;R&quot; − 1) = 0
so the only eigenvalues of &quot;R&quot; are 0, 1/2, 1. If the Jordan algebra &quot;A&quot; is finite-dimensional over a field of characteristic not 2, this implies that it is a direct sum of subspaces &quot;A&quot; = &quot;A&quot;0(&quot;e&quot;) ⊕ &quot;A&quot;1/2(&quot;e&quot;) ⊕ &quot;A&quot;1(&quot;e&quot;) of the three eigenspaces. This decomposition was first considered by for totally real Jordan algebras. It was later studied in full generality by and called the Peirce decomposition of &quot;A&quot; relative to the idempotent &quot;e&quot;.

==Special kinds and generalizations==

===Infinite-dimensional Jordan algebras===
In 1979, Efim Zelmanov classified infinite-dimensional simple (and prime non-degenerate) Jordan algebras. They are either of Hermitian or Clifford type. In particular, the only exceptional simple Jordan algebras are finite-dimensional Albert algebras, which have dimension 27.

===Jordan operator algebras===

The theory of operator algebras has been extended to cover Jordan operator algebras.

The counterparts of C*-algebras are JB algebras, which in finite dimensions are called Euclidean Jordan algebras. The norm on the real Jordan algebra must be complete and satisfy the axioms:

:formula_13

These axioms guarantee that the Jordan algebra is formally real, so that, if a sum of squares of terms is zero, those terms must be zero. The complexifications of JB algebras are called Jordan C*-algebras or JB*-algebras. They have been used extensively in complex geometry to extend Koecher&#x27;s Jordan algebraic treatment of bounded symmetric domains to infinite dimensions. Not all JB algebras can be realized as Jordan algebras of self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space, exactly as in finite dimensions. The exceptional Albert algebra is the common obstruction.

The Jordan algebra analogue of von Neumann algebras is played by JBW algebras. These turn out to be JB algebras which, as Banach spaces, are the dual spaces of Banach spaces. Much of the structure theory of von Neumann algebras can be carried over to JBW algebras. In particular the JBW factors—those with center reduced to R—are completely understood in terms of von Neumann algebras. Apart from the exceptional Albert algebra, all JWB factors can be realised as Jordan algebras of self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space closed in the weak operator topology. Of these the spin factors can be constructed very simply from real Hilbert spaces. All other JWB factors are either the self-adjoint part of a von Neumann factor or its fixed point subalgebra under a period 2 *-antiautomorphism of the von Neumann factor.

===Jordan rings===
A Jordan ring is a generalization of Jordan algebras, requiring only that the Jordan ring be over a general ring rather than a field. Alternatively one can define a Jordan ring as a commutative nonassociative ring that respects the Jordan identity.

===Jordan superalgebras===

Jordan superalgebras were introduced by Kac, Kantor and Kaplansky; these are formula_14-graded algebras formula_15 where formula_16 is a Jordan algebra and formula_17 has a &quot;Lie-like&quot; product with values in formula_16.

Any formula_14-graded associative algebra formula_20 becomes a Jordan superalgebra with respect to the graded Jordan brace

:formula_21

Jordan simple superalgebras over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 were classified by . They include several families and some exceptional algebras, notably formula_22 and formula_23.

===J-structures===

The concept of J-structure was introduced by to develop a theory of Jordan algebras using linear algebraic groups and axioms taking the Jordan inversion as basic operation and Hua&#x27;s identity as a basic relation. In characteristic not equal to 2 the theory of J-structures is essentially the same as that of Jordan algebras.

===Quadratic Jordan algebras===

Quadratic Jordan algebras are a generalization of (linear) Jordan algebras introduced by . The fundamental identities of the quadratic representation of a linear Jordan algebra are used as axioms to define a quadratic Jordan algebra over a field of arbitrary characteristic. There is a uniform description of finite-dimensional simple quadratic Jordan algebras, independent of characteristic: in characteristic not equal to 2 the theory of quadratic Jordan algebras reduces to that of linear Jordan algebras.

<text>Sviatoslav Olgovich (died February 14, 1164) was Prince of Novgorod (1136–1138); Novgorod-Seversk (1139); Belgorod (1141–1154); and Chernigov (1154–1164). 

== Biography ==
=== Early life ===
Sviatoslav was the son of Oleg Sviatoslavich, the prince of Chernigov, and an unnamed daughter of Aepa, a Cuman prince. In 1108, Sviatoslav married a Cuman princess, daughter of Aepa son of Girgen, with whom he had a daughter and a son, Oleg II Svyatoslavich. In 1136 Svyatoslav married a second time, to the daughter of the posadnik of Novgorod, probably named Ekaterina or Catherine, who bore their son Igor Sviatoslavich, famous from the &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;.

=== War with the Davidovichi ===
After the death of their older brother Vsevolod II in 1146, Sviatoslav and his brother Igor were driven out of Kiev by Iziaslav Mstislavich. Sviatoslav escaped, but Igor was captured and eventually killed in 1147. Sviatoslav fled to Chernigov but was ordered to relinquish his city, Novgorod-Seversk, to his cousins, Iziaslav Davidovich and Vladimir Davidovich. With the assistance of his ally, Yuri Dolgoruki, and his father-in-law, Aepa Khan, Sviatoslav began a war against his cousins, but was forced to flee to Karachev. There on January 16, 1147, Sviatoslav defeated the Davidovichi brothers.

=== Death and succession ===

Upon his death in 1164, his widow Catherine briefly ruled as princess regnant of Chernigov. The reign of Ekaterina or Catherine of Chernigov lasted for a few days, during which she kept her husband&#x27;s death a secret while she summoned her (step-?)son Oleg to come to Chernigov quickly, and told the city&#x27;s leading men not inform her brother-in-law Sviatoslav Vsevolodich, who was the rightful heir to the Chernigovian throne. Nevertheless, the bishop of Chernigov betrayed the trust of princess (&quot;kniaginia&quot;) Catherine immediately, and sent Sviatoslav Vsevolodich a letter, writing that &quot;the kniaginia rules [sedit&#x27;] in cahoots with the children and she has many goods.&quot; Sviatoslav Vsevolodich soon arrived and made a deal with Oleg, by which the former became prince of Chernigov and the latter prince of Novgorod-Seversk. Princess Catherine is not heard of again until two years later, when she reportedly died on 12 April 1166.

<text>Messier 73 (M73, also known as NGC 6994) is an asterism of four stars in the constellation Aquarius which was long thought to be a small open cluster. It lies several arcminutes east of globular cluster M72. According to Gaia EDR3, the stars are , , , and light-years from the Sun, with the second being a binary star.

==History==
M73 was discovered by Charles Messier in 1780 who originally described the object as a cluster of four stars with some nebulosity. Much later observations by John Herschel could not find any nebulosity. Moreover, Herschel noted that the designation of M73 as a cluster was questionable. Nonetheless, Herschel included M73 in his General Catalogue of clusters, nebulae, and galaxies, and John Dreyer included M73 when he compiled the New General Catalogue.

==Relation between the stars==
M73 was once treated as a potential sparsely populated open cluster, which consists of stars that are physically associated in space as well as on the sky. The question of whether the stars were an asterism or an open cluster was a matter of debate in the early 2000s.

In 2000, L. P. Bassino, S. Waldhausen, and R. E. Martinez published an analysis of the colors and luminosities of the stars in and around M73. They concluded that the four bright central stars and some other nearby stars followed the color-luminosity relation that is also followed by stars in open clusters (as seen in a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram). Their conclusion was that M73 was an old open cluster that was 9 ′ wide. However, G. Carraro, published results in 2000 based on a similar analysis and concluded that the stars did not follow any color-luminosity relation. Carraro&#x27;s conclusion was that M73 was an asterism. Adding to the controversy, E. Bica and collaborators concluded that the chance alignment of the four bright stars seen in the center of M73 as well as one other nearby star was highly unlikely, so M73 was probably a sparse open cluster. The controversy was resolved in 2002, when M. Odenkirchen and C. Soubiran published an analysis of the high resolution spectra of the six brightest stars within 6 ′ of the centre point. They demonstrated that the distances from the Earth to the six stars were very different from each other, and the stars were moving in different directions. Therefore, they concluded that the stars were only an asterism.

Although M73 was determined to be only a chance alignment of stars, further analysis of asterisms is still important for the identification of sparsely populated open clusters. A full study of very many such clusters would demonstrate how, how often, and to what degree open clusters are ripped apart by the gravitational forces in the Milky Way and reveal more of the sources of these forces.

<text>Tipping the Velvet is a 1998 debut novel by Welsh novelist Sarah Waters. A historical novel set in England during the 1890s, it tells a coming-of-age story about a young woman named Nan who falls in love with a male impersonator, follows her to London, and finds various ways to support herself as she journeys through the city. The picaresque plot elements have prompted scholars and reviewers to compare it to similar British urban adventure stories written by Charles Dickens and Daniel Defoe.

The novel has pervasive lesbian themes, concentrating on eroticism and self-discovery. Waters was working on a PhD dissertation in English literature when she decided to write a story she would like to read. Employing her love for the variety of people and districts in London, she consciously chose an urban setting. As opposed to previous lesbian-themed fiction she had read where the characters escape an oppressive society to live apart from it, Waters chose characters who interact with their surroundings. She has acknowledged that the book imagines a lesbian presence and history in Victorian London where none was recorded. The main character&#x27;s experiences in the theatrical profession and her perpetual motion through the city allow her to make observations on social conditions while exploring the issues of gender, sexism, and class difference.

As Waters&#x27; first novel, it was highly acclaimed and was chosen by &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Library Journal&quot; as one of the best books of 1998. Waters followed &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; with two other novels also set in the Victorian era and both were also well-received, but reviewers comment that &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; employs humour, adventure, and sexual explicitness to greatest effect. The novel was adapted into a somewhat controversial three-part television series by the BBC in 2002.

==Inspiration and publication==
When Sarah Waters was 19 years old, she joined a student house in Whitstable, Kent, sharing a bed and then falling in love with another young woman. They lived there for two winters in what became a six-year relationship. She recalled, &quot;It was cold, isolated, romantic and so intense—quite special.&quot; In 1995, Waters was at Queen Mary and Westfield College writing her PhD dissertation on gay and lesbian historical fiction from 1870 onward when she became interested in the Victorian era. While learning about the activism in socialism, women&#x27;s suffrage, and utopianism of the period, she was inspired to write a work of fiction of the kind that she would like to read. Specifically, Waters intended to write a story that focused on an urban setting, diverging from previous lesbian-themed books such as Isabel Miller&#x27;s &quot;Patience and Sarah&quot;, in which two women escape an oppressive home life to live together freely in the woods. She said to herself at the time, &quot;there&#x27;s so much more to lesbian history than that&quot;.

Waters was drawn to the Victorian era because of the (mis)understandings of what social norms existed during the period. As she stated, &quot;I find it a fascinating period because it feels very close to us, and yet in lots of ways it is utterly strange: many of the things we think we know about it are stereotypes, or simply wrong&quot;. Considering herself part of gay and lesbian literary heritage, Waters was influenced by Oscar Wilde, and Chris Hunt, who wrote &quot;Street Lavender&quot;, an historical novel with gay male themes also set in the Victorian era. She has stated that &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; is a female version of &quot;Street Lavender&quot;, with a plot similar to &quot;My Secret Life&quot; by &quot;Walter&quot;.

Waters pitched &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; to ten British publishers, but after they all rejected it, she began considering American publishing houses. Although she was picked up quickly by a literary agency, the agent spent almost a year trying to sell the book to a mainstream publisher. By the time &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; was accepted by Virago Press—one of the ten that had previously passed on the project—Waters had already begun work on her second novel.

==Plot==
Nancy &quot;Nan&quot; Astley is a sheltered 18-year-old living with her working-class family and helping in their oyster restaurant in Whitstable, Kent. She becomes instantly and desperately enamoured with a &quot;masher&quot;, or male impersonator, named Kitty Butler, who performs for a season at the local theatre. They begin a friendship that grows when, after Kitty finds an opportunity to perform in London for better exposure, she asks Nan to join her. Nan enthusiastically agrees and leaves her family to act as Kitty&#x27;s dresser while she performs. Although Kitty and Nan acknowledge their relationship to be sisterly, Nan continues to love Kitty until a jealous fight forces Kitty to admit she feels the same, although she insists that they keep their relationship secret. Simultaneously, Kitty&#x27;s manager Walter decides that Kitty needs a performing partner to reach true success, and suggests Nan for the role. Nan is initially horrified by the idea, but takes to it. The duo become quite famous until Nan realises she is homesick after being gone from her family for more than a year. Her return home is underwhelming, so she returns to London early to find Kitty in bed with Walter. They announce that the act is finished and they are to be married.

Astonished and deeply bruised by the discovery, Nan wanders the streets of London, finally holing herself in a filthy boarding house for weeks in a state of madness until her funds run out. After spying the male costumes she took as her only memory of her time with Kitty, Nan begins to walk the streets of London as a man and easily passes. She is solicited by a man for sex and begins renting, but dressed only as a man for male clients, never letting them know she is a woman. She meets a socialist activist named Florence who lives near the boarding house, but before she can get to know her, Nan is hired by a wealthy widow with licentious tastes named Diana. Although realising—and initially enjoying—that she is an object to Diana and her friends, Nan stays with her for over a year as &quot;Neville&quot;, dressed in the finest men&#x27;s clothes Diana can afford. The relationship erodes, however, and Diana throws Nan into the streets.

Nan stumbles through London searching for Florence, whom she eventually finds; Florence is now melancholy, however, and has a child. Nan stays with Florence and her brother Ralph, working as their housekeeper. Nan and Florence grow closer during the year they live together, and Nan learns that the previous boarder with Florence and Ralph had a child and died shortly after giving birth. Florence was deeply in love with the boarder but her affections were not returned. During an outing to a women&#x27;s pub, Nan is recognised by former fans, to Florence&#x27;s astonishment, and Nan divulges her own spotty past to Florence. Cautiously, they begin a love affair. Putting her theatrical skills to use, Nan assists Ralph in preparing a speech at an upcoming socialist rally. At the event Nan jumps onstage to help Ralph when he falters, and is noticed once more by Kitty, who asks her to come back so they can continue their affair in secret. Realising how much shame Kitty continues to feel, how much of herself was compromised during their affair, and that her truest happiness is where she is now, Nan turns Kitty away and joins Florence.

==Literary elements==

===Style===
The greatest literary strengths in &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot;, according to reviewers and literary scholars, are the vibrant portrayal of the districts and streets of London, and Waters&#x27; ability to create sympathetic and realistic characters. Her use of synaesthesia in lush descriptions particularly interested Harriet Malinowitz in &quot;The Women&#x27;s Review of Books&quot;. For example, Malinowitz cites the scene when Nan first meets Kitty, removing her glove to shake Kitty&#x27;s hand. Very much an oyster girl, Nan&#x27;s hands are covered with &quot;those rank sea-scents, of liquor and oyster-flesh, crab-meat and whelks, which had flavoured my fingers and those of my family for so many years we had ceased, entirely, to notice them&quot;. Nan is mortified that she smells like a herring, but Kitty assuages her fears, kissing her hand and telling her she instead smells like a mermaid. Malinowitz includes this and other descriptions of sights, sounds, and smells in Victorian London as examples of elements that are &quot;breathlessly and wittily detailed&quot;.

Although Waters was born in Pembrokeshire, Wales, she considers herself a London writer because of her intense affection for the city, due in part to her immigration to it. Specifically, Waters is moved by walking through London and seeing remnants of many historical eras: &quot;It&#x27;s ... almost like it&#x27;s peopled with ghosts—again, jostling up against each other or passing through each other. I find that very exciting&quot;. Her love for the city is apparent to many reviewers. In the &quot;Lesbian Review of Books&quot; Donna Allegra writes, &quot;[S]he summons the era&#x27;s attitudes and ambiance projecting them onto the screen of the reader&#x27;s mind with Dolby wrap-around sound such that you feel you&#x27;re vacationing on all points between Chelsea and the East End&quot;.

Miranda Seymour in &quot;The New York Times&quot; remarks on the &quot;breathless passion&quot; of the narrator&#x27;s voice as being absolutely convincing, citing as an example Nancy&#x27;s statement to her sister at the start of the book about why she continues to visit Kitty Butler:... It&#x27;s like I never saw anything at all before. It&#x27;s like I am filling up, like a wine-glass when it&#x27;s filled with wine. I watch the acts before her and they are like nothing—they&#x27;re like dust. Then she walks on the stage and—she is so pretty; and her suit is so nice; and her voice is so sweet... She makes me want to smile and weep, at once... I never saw a girl like her before. I never knew that there were girls like her.

Donna Allegra and Christina Patterson in &quot;The Observer&quot; also praise Nan as a passionate and captivating character. Patterson and Mel Steel in &quot;The Independent&quot; compare her resourcefulness to that of Moll Flanders. Of her three Victorian-set novels, Waters uses humour and &quot;an attractive lightness of touch&quot; most effectively in &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot;, according to Paulina Palmer. Nan the narrator describes the irony of her &quot;curious gaslit career&quot; as a rent-boy only to end up—in Diana&#x27;s words—as her &quot;tart&quot;. Waters had such fun writing the novel that she told Robert McCrum from &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2009 that if she had no obligations to meet stemming from her subsequent success as a writer that she would continue writing Nan&#x27;s story.

===Genre===
Nan&#x27;s path through the plot indicates that &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; is part &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;, and her journeys through the streets of London invoke elements of a picaresque novel. Scholar Emily Jeremiah characterises the story as a &quot;Bildungsroman&quot;: a coming-of-age adventure but one that far surpasses a simple coming-out story. Stefania Ciocia in &quot;Literary London&quot; writes that the plot has classical elements of a fairy tale as it follows the main character&#x27;s growth and progression, and has a moral ending that includes a course of events where Nan forsakes three suitors for her—in this case—Princess Charming. Nan finds true love with Florence, who is a bit dowdy, somewhat stout, certainly not wealthy, and driven to improve the world; the least likely of all the characters. A review in &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; states that the series of events leading to Nan finding love are &quot;unpredictable and moving&quot;.

Nan&#x27;s experiences eventually reveal serious faults of the society she moves through, the primary element of a picaresque novel. For this and other reasons, Waters&#x27; books are frequently compared to stories by Charles Dickens; the reader follows Nan&#x27;s movement from sheltered naif to exuberant theatre performer to rent-boy to mistress to housewife then socialist orator, showing allegiance to none of these professions or ideals. Michael Upchurch in &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; writes that Nan&#x27;s inability or unwillingness to adhere to any profession or setting, remaining malleable until the end of the novel indicates she is her own worst enemy. Likewise, Marianne Brace in &quot;The Independent&quot; considers Nan selfish and unsympathetic.

Ciocia writes that with half the novel taking place in theatrical settings, Nan may be playing a role as character in her own life or a play on a stage set in a theatre or the streets of London. She starts as a spectator watching Kitty onstage, and later with Kitty, watching how men move and behave to improve their act. She becomes a performer, with Kitty, as a renter and again for the predatory Diana and her friends. Finally she takes the role of director as she assists and impels Ralph to perform his speech. At this point, she is able to reconcile her identity and the story ends. Waters consciously chose to create a complicated plot, and was impressed with Iris Murdoch&#x27;s claim that she herself had entire stories worked out well in advance of writing them, a method Waters used with &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot;.

==Themes==

===Sexuality===
Sexuality and sexual identity is the most prevalent theme in the novel. The title is an obscure Victorian pornographic slang reference to cunnilingus. Nick Rennison in &quot;Contemporary British Authors&quot; characterises &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; as an &quot;unabashed and unapologetic celebration of lesbian eroticism and sexual diversity&quot;. Donna Allegra writes with appreciation of how the existence of Waters&#x27; characters in a heterosexual existence forces an analysis of closeted positions. The sexism of the period puts a stranglehold on women, forcing readers to compare women in the Victorian era with present-day sexual attitudes. Nan never has difficulty accepting her love for Kitty Butler and other women; Kitty&#x27;s union with Walter, however, &quot;reeks of lesbophobia&quot;, according to Allegra. Music halls could be rough in some areas, but Kitty is shown handling drunken and rowdy audiences with humour and grace. The only instance where she is overcome and flees the stage is when a drunken patron shouts a euphemism for a lesbian at her. This episode leads to the final scene of Part I when Nan stumbles upon Kitty and Walter in bed. Kitty does not display any pleasure in their union, but rather complacence tinged with shame. Allegra compares Kitty&#x27;s desire for normality overshadowing her desire for love with Nan to &quot;compulsory heterosexuality ... emblematic of and particular to lesbian existence&quot;.

Scholar Paulina Palmer asserts that Waters, in &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; and her two following novels also set in the Victorian era—&quot;Affinity&quot; and &quot;Fingersmith&quot;—is establishing a literary tradition that has not existed: &quot;Women engaging in same-sex relationships in the Victorian era were on the whole invisible and we have little knowledge of their literary interests.&quot; Waters, however, acknowledges that accuracy about lesbian life in the Victorian era is not her primary goal: &quot;My purpose was not to be authentic, but to imagine a history that we can’t really recover.&quot; Short bursts of lesbian-themed literary activity occurred in 1920s with authors such as Natalie Clifford Barney and Djuna Barnes. Another surge of activity published as lesbian pulp fiction occurred in the 1950s and early 1960s, during which several notable lesbian authors such as Ann Bannon and Valerie Taylor helped to establish lesbian literary identity. These fictions helped to inform readers about the lives and cultural landmarks of lesbians when very little information existed. Waters states that she is not on a deliberate crusade to write about lesbians, but that it is a reflection of what she knows: &quot;Lesbianism is at the top of the agenda for my books because it&#x27;s at the top of the agenda for my life. It would be bizarre not to write about it.&quot; In 2009, as she reflected on her reasons for writing &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; and &quot;Fingersmith&quot;, Waters said she was searching for her own identity as a lesbian writer.

Among Waters&#x27; Victorian-set novels, depictions of sexual encounters are also, according to Palmer, the most vivid in &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot;. A review in &quot;The Advocate&quot; calls the book &quot;riotously sexy&quot;, and &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; suggests the scene where Nan shows Kitty how to open and eat an oyster is evocative of &quot;Tom Jones&quot;. This follows a marked difference in recently written fiction by and for lesbians. Frank depictions of lesbian sexuality specifically penned by women have been quieted by censorship that equated lesbian sex with aberrant mental behaviour, or employed it as an erotic element controlled by, and for the benefit of, men. Lesbian literary scholar Bonnie Zimmerman writes, &quot;Lesbians have been reticent and uncomfortable about sexual writing in part because we wish to reject the patriarchal stereotype of the lesbian as a voracious sexual vampire who spends all her time in bed. It is safer to be a lesbian if sex is kept in the closet or under the covers. We don’t wish to give the world another stick with which to beat us&quot;.

===Gender===
Nan not only experiences a series of misadventures and lesbian relationships, but also shifts from female to male at the same time, giving the reader an opportunity to view London society from multiple perspectives. Gender masquerade and reaction to it permeates the novel. According to Harriet Malinowitz, Waters uses the symbolism of clothing such as skirts, pants, stays, braces, bonnets, ties, and chemises &quot;with the sort of metaphorical significance that Melville gives to whales&quot;. Stefania Ciocia declares that in all of 19th-century English literature, the only type of character who was able to enjoy adventures native to the picaresque novel were males who acted as the observer or stroller, walking through the city from one district to the next. The single exception to this was Moll Flanders, a prostitute. Nancy Astley behaves as both, giving her the ability to offer her perceptions of London society as both a man and a woman.

Music halls, where both Nan and Kitty are employed—and put on display—as male impersonators, allow about half the novel&#x27;s action and commentary on gender to take place, according to scholar Cheryl Wilson. When Nan puts on trousers for the first time to perform as Kitty&#x27;s partner and realises the impact of their double act together, she states, &quot;whatever successes I might achieve as a girl, they would be nothing compared to the triumphs I should enjoy clad, however girlishly, as a boy&quot;. Male impersonation is common in the world of the novel, and some performers are quite popular. Only certain types of depictions of men, however, were acceptable in reality. Nan and Kitty pretend to be London &quot;swells&quot;: gentlemen on the town who sing about their sweethearts. Wilson provides evidence that such depictions were supported by class divisions, as poorer music hall patrons enjoyed the fun poked at the upper class, and the upper class generally found it harmless enough to laugh at themselves. Mashers such as the famed Vesta Tilley capitalised on the fact that both men and women were able to laugh at common perceptions of femininity and masculinity.

Writing in 1998 about a period more than 100 years before, Waters employs a continuity between the past and present, particularly as it relates to an outsider&#x27;s view of sexuality and gender. Diana bestows Nan with the finest gift she had ever received, an expensive watch that requires no winding. She has nowhere to be except at Diana&#x27;s beck and call, and never leaves Diana&#x27;s mansion without her. Emily Jeremiah uses this as an example of how &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; fits Judith Halberstam&#x27;s declaration that homosexual historiographies &quot;produce alternative temporalities&quot;. Gay and lesbian stories do not use the same rites of passage that most mainstream stories do, leaving aside the importance of birth, marriage, reproduction, and death. This transcendence of time is evident in the narration of the novel. It is Nan&#x27;s first-person account of her own past, told many years later. When Nan divulges her past to Florence, Waters uses the first line of the novel to signify where she begins, cycling the story.

Even the novel&#x27;s language bridges this divide. Waters often employs the word &quot;queer&quot; to describe the unusual or remarkable, instead of its post-1922 connotation to refer to homosexuality. She also uses the term specifically to highlight what is unusual as it applies to gender, or Nan&#x27;s own emotions toward Kitty. Nan&#x27;s father uses the symbol of the oyster, what he calls a &quot;real queer fish&quot; that exhibits both male and female characteristics, and compares it to Kitty who sits before them in feminine attire though they have seen her on stage dressed as a man. The landlady of the boarding house where Kitty and Nan are staying appraises Nan&#x27;s first male costume, and is troubled by the &quot;queerness&quot; of it because she looks too much like a man, instead of a woman pretending to be a man. Donna Allegra suggests that by using the contemporary term for prostitutes, &quot;gay girls&quot;, Waters is winking at her readers.

===Class===
Starting as a working-class girl and experiencing music halls, prostitution, luxury, and a socialist struggle for utopia, Nan&#x27;s journeys through the class system in &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; are as varied as her gender portrayals and love affairs. Aiobheann Sweeney in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; notes, &quot;like Dickens, [Waters] digs around in the poorhouses, prisons and asylums to come up with characters who not only court and curtsy but dramatise the unfairness of poverty and gender disparity in their time&quot;.

Paulina Palmer sees the reading material available in the various locations of Nan&#x27;s settings as symbols of the vast class differences in Victorian London. Specifically, Diana keeps a trunk full of pornographic literature which she and Nan read to each other in between sexual encounters. She is an extremely wealthy resident of the London neighbourhood St John&#x27;s Wood, and identifies as a Sapphist—a contemporary term for a lesbian. Nan uses the euphemism &quot;tom&quot; throughout the novel, particularly to refer to herself and other working class lesbians. Although &quot;tom&quot; was used as a Victorian reference to lesbianism, Waters admits it was probably not as prevalent as her characters suggest it was.

Waters includes a historical reference to the medical profession starting to acknowledge and identify female homosexuality in the 19th century when a friend of Diana&#x27;s named Dickie reads aloud during a party from a medical text describing the histories of several acknowledged lesbians, including Dickie&#x27;s own. One story discussed among the wealthy women at the party is about a young woman with a large clitoris, which they consider congenital in lower-class women. They attempt to prove their point with Diana&#x27;s maid Zena, but Nan prevents this humiliation, which precipitates her final rift with Diana. Using Dickie&#x27;s book to strike Nan across the face, Diana gives her a black eye and bloody cheek before throwing her out into the street with Zena. Nan goes to Florence&#x27;s house, which is filled with socialist literature. Although Diana is a supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage, she discourages Nan from reading such literature, confiscating any political material Nan picks up. In contrast, Nan feels hopelessly uninformed when Florence and her friends engage in heated political debates. She asks questions, but feels stupid about not knowing the answers. Florence introduces her to the writings of Walt Whitman, Eleanor Marx, and Edward Carpenter, which they sexualise by using as an introduction to intimacy.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; was critically acclaimed upon its release and Waters&#x27; writing style highly praised. Harriet Malinowitz wrote that the story is an &quot;utterly captivating, high octane narrative&quot; and Mel Steel of &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote, &quot;Could this be a new genre? The bawdy lesbian picaresque novel? Whatever it is, take it with you. It&#x27;s gorgeous&quot;. &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; also praised it, writing &quot;Waters&#x27; debut offers terrific entertainment: swiftly paced, crammed with colorful depictions of 1890s London and vividly sketched Dickensian supporting characters&quot;, comparing the depiction of Nancy&#x27;s parents to the fishing community in &quot;David Copperfield&quot;, and adding that it &quot;pulsat[es] with highly charged (and explicitly presented) erotic heat&quot;. John Perry in &quot;The San Francisco Chronicle&quot; stated that it &quot;has the qualities of an extravagantly upholstered armchair. Tricked out in gaudy fabric and yards of fringe, it offers a sensual experience that leaves the reader marveling at the author&#x27;s craftsmanship, idiosyncrasy and sheer effort&quot;. Perry did acknowledge, however, that modern optimism was probably the impetus driving Waters&#x27; vision of a lesbian past.

Christina Patterson called Waters &quot;an extremely confident writer, combining precise, sensuous descriptions with irony and wit in a skilled, multi-layered pastiche of the lesbian historical romance&quot;. Renee Graham&#x27;s review in &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; characterised the novel&#x27;s style as &quot;plush and inviting—delicious, even&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Miranda Seymour drew attention to the scene when Nan dresses up as Hadrian&#x27;s lover, the page Antinous who was drowned in the Nile, for a masquerade benefiting Diana&#x27;s friends in a hedonistic bacchanalia that ends violently with Nan cast out of the house into the cold, highlighting it as a passage of &quot;startling power&quot;. Although Seymour was disappointed with the ending, she wrote, &quot;If lesbian fiction is to reach a wider readership—as much, though far from all, of it deserves to do—Waters is just the person to carry the banner&quot;.

Several reviewers compared &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; to Jeanette Winterson&#x27;s &quot;Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit&quot; for a similar story of a woman&#x27;s sexual awakening. Waters credits Winterson as an influence in lesbian writing, but states that the books are quite different and her writing is not like Winterson&#x27;s at all. Waters suggests that reviewers have bracketed them together because Winterson was the only other lesbian author they could recall.

The popularity of her first novel cast a standard for &quot;Affinity&quot; to follow, which Waters consciously made darker, set in a women&#x27;s prison with a character who connects with spirits of the dead. Waters found it daunting to follow the success of &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; and reviewers marked the differences in the main characters: where Nan adventurously seeks out and states her desires, Margaret in &quot;Affinity&quot; is compelled by desire, but internally struggles with it.

&quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; won the Lambda Literary Award for lesbian fiction in 2000, and the Betty Trask Award, given to Commonwealth citizens who have produced their first novel before reaching the age of 35. &quot;The Library Journal&quot; chose it as one of their Best Books of the Year for 1999, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; included it on its list of Notable Books of the Year.

==Adaptations==

===Television===

&quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; was adapted into a BBC television drama serial of the same name, originally screened in three episodes on BBC Two in 2002. It was produced for the BBC by the independent production company Sally Head Productions, and starred Rachael Stirling as Nan, Keeley Hawes as Kitty, Anna Chancellor as Diana, and Jodhi May as Florence. The BBC had previously adapted &quot;Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit&quot; in 1990 and some other scenes in dramas to follow, but none had been so explicit. Sally Head Productions defended the decision to air the entire program uncut. Waters was quite surprised that the BBC chose to produce and broadcast a television adaptation that faithfully followed the relish and detail of sexual escapades in the book. Stirling thoroughly enjoyed the role, despite her avowed heterosexuality: &quot;To counteract any hard-core sex within it, there&#x27;s a huge sense of humour and a huge sense of fun and frivolity and joy of life. It was so utterly believable that you never for a moment thought, Fuck, there&#x27;s no reason why I&#x27;m standing here naked.&quot;

Screenwriter Andrew Davies said he was attracted to the story because it featured a girl transitioning into womanhood and it included his interests in Victorian erotica; he compared it to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;—for which he wrote the BBC screenplay—&quot;with dirty bits&quot;. Both Waters and Davies were concerned about the use of dildos in scenes with Diana, but the BBC allowed it.

Waters especially appreciated the way Davies interpreted Kitty&#x27;s ambivalence about being in love with Nan. He wrote the line for her, &quot;I hate the way you make me feel&quot;, which according to Waters crystallises Kitty&#x27;s complicated emotions well. The music in the adaptation was written for the film. Waters wrote song titles but not lyrics in the music references in the novel. For one song, during Kitty and Nan&#x27;s first performance in the adaptation, Davies wrote a composition that had Kitty show Nan—dressed and performing as brothers—how to pick up girls in the park. It involved Kitty teaching Nan how to kiss, which they do onstage in front of audiences who are watching women, dressed as men, who are in reality having an affair with each other beyond the view of the audience. Waters wrote a similar description as Nan compares their act to their relationship; their sexual encounters to their performance onstage, noting the irony that Kitty insisted on absolute secrecy yet there they performed in front of thousands: &quot;&quot;You are too slow—you go too fast—not there, but here—that&#x27;s good—that&#x27;s better!&quot; It was as if we walked before the crimson curtain, lay down upon the boards and kissed and fondled—and were clapped, and cheered, and paid for it!&quot;

A persistent rumor in the mid-late 2000s claimed that a film adaptation of &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; was to be directed by Sofia Coppola, starring Beyoncé and Eva Longoria. However, both stars insisted that everything about the rumour is false, right down to quotes attributed to them.

In 2009, UK playwright Amanda Whittington wrote a stage adaptation of &quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot;. It was showcased by Guildhall School of Music and Drama at The Bridewell Theatre, London, in October 2009. Directed by Katharine Rogers, the production featured original music hall songs and was praised for its authentic interpretation of the novel.

===Stage===

On 14 April 2015, it was announced the play would receive its world premiere the same year and would begin previews at the Lyric Hammersmith on 18 September 2015, with an official opening night on 28 September, booking for a limited period until 24 October. Following its premiere production the play transferred to the Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh, as part of the 50th anniversary season of the Royal Lyceum Theatre company, where it ran from 28 October to 14 November 2015.

&quot;Tipping the Velvet&quot; has been adapted for the stage by Laura Wade and is directed by Lyndsey Turner, with choreography by Alistair David, design by Lizzie Clachan, lighting design by Jon Clark, music by Michael Bruce and sound by Nick Manning.

<text>Liberty is the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one&#x27;s way of life, behavior, or political views. The concept of liberty can vary depending on perspective and context. In the Constitutional law of the United States, ordered liberty means creating a balanced society where individuals have the freedom to act without unnecessary interference (negative liberty) and access to opportunities and resources to pursue their goals (positive liberty), all within a fair legal system.

Sometimes liberty is differentiated from freedom by using the word &quot;freedom&quot; primarily, if not exclusively, to mean the ability to do as one wills and what one has the power to do; and using the word &quot;liberty&quot; to mean the absence of arbitrary restraints, taking into account the rights of all involved. In this sense, the exercise of liberty is subject to capability and limited by the rights of others. Thus liberty entails the responsible use of freedom under the rule of law without depriving anyone else of their freedom. Liberty can be taken away as a form of punishment. In many countries, people can be deprived of their liberty if they are convicted of criminal acts.

Liberty&#x27;s etymology is from the Latin word , from Proto-Italic , from Proto-Indo-European , from (&quot;people&quot;) (thus cognate to archaic English (&quot;man, person&quot;)). The word &quot;liberty&quot; is commonly used in slogans or quotes, such as in &quot;Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness&quot; and &quot;Liberté, égalité, fraternité&quot;.

== Philosophy ==

Philosophers from the earliest times have considered the question of liberty. Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius (121–180 AD) wrote:
According to compatibilist Thomas Hobbes (1588–1679):

John Locke (1632–1704) rejected that definition of liberty. While not specifically mentioning Hobbes, he attacks Sir Robert Filmer who had the same definition. According to Locke:

John Stuart Mill, in his 1859 work, &quot;On Liberty&quot;, was the first to recognize the difference between liberty as the freedom to act and liberty as the absence of coercion.

In his 1958 lecture &quot;Two Concepts of Liberty&quot;, Isaiah Berlin formally framed the differences between two perspectives as the distinction between two opposite concepts of liberty: positive liberty and negative liberty. The latter designates a negative condition in which an individual is protected from tyranny and the arbitrary exercise of authority, while the former refers to the liberty that comes from self-mastery, the freedom from inner compulsions such as weakness and fear.

== Politics ==
=== History ===
The modern day concept of political liberty has its origins in the Greek concepts of freedom and slavery. To be free, to the Greeks, was not to have a master, to be independent from a master (to live as one likes). That was the original Greek concept of freedom. It is closely linked with the concept of democracy, as Aristotle put it:

:&quot;This, then, is one note of liberty which all democrats affirm to be the principle of their state. Another is that a man should live as he likes. This, they say, is the privilege of a freeman, since, on the other hand, not to live as a man likes is the mark of a slave. This is the second characteristic of democracy, whence has arisen the claim of men to be ruled by none, if possible, or, if this is impossible, to rule and be ruled in turns; and so it contributes to the freedom based upon equality.&quot;

This applied only to free men. In Athens, for instance, women could not vote or hold office and were legally and socially dependent on a male relative.

The populations of the Persian Empire enjoyed some degree of freedom. Citizens of all religions and ethnic groups were given the same rights and had the same freedom of religion, women had the same rights as men, and slavery was abolished (550 BC). All the palaces of the kings of Persia were built by paid workers in an era when slaves typically did such work.

In the Maurya Empire of ancient India, citizens of all religions and ethnic groups had some rights to freedom, tolerance, and equality. The need for tolerance on an egalitarian basis can be found in the Edicts of Ashoka the Great, which emphasize the importance of tolerance in public policy by the government. The slaughter or capture of prisoners of war also appears to have been condemned by Ashoka. Slavery also appears to have been non-existent in the Maurya Empire. However, according to Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, &quot;Ashoka&#x27;s orders seem to have been resisted right from the beginning.&quot;

Roman law also embraced certain limited forms of liberty, even under the rule of the Roman Emperors. However, these liberties were accorded only to Roman citizens. Many of the liberties enjoyed under Roman law endured through the Middle Ages, but were enjoyed solely by the nobility, rarely by the common man. The idea of inalienable and universal liberties had to wait until the Age of Enlightenment.

=== Social contract ===

The social contract theory, most influentially formulated by Hobbes, John Locke and Rousseau (though first suggested by Plato in &quot;The Republic&quot;), was among the first to provide a political classification of rights, in particular through the notion of sovereignty and of natural rights. The thinkers of the Enlightenment reasoned that law governed both heavenly and human affairs, and that law gave the king his power, rather than the king&#x27;s power giving force to law. This conception of law would find its culmination in the ideas of Montesquieu. The conception of law as a relationship between individuals, rather than families, came to the fore, and with it the increasing focus on individual liberty as a fundamental reality, given by &quot;Nature and Nature&#x27;s God,&quot; which, in the ideal state, would be as universal as possible.

In &quot;On Liberty&quot;, John Stuart Mill sought to define the &quot;...nature and limits of the power which can be legitimately exercised by society over the individual,&quot; and as such, he describes an inherent and continuous antagonism between liberty and authority and thus, the prevailing question becomes &quot;how to make the fitting adjustment between individual independence and social control&quot;.

==Origins of political freedom==
According to a 2024 study, a global conception of liberty took form during the late Middle Ages (circa 1000–1600), as &quot;emic terms used across Afro-Eurasia to denote liberty were interconnected through various translingual practices resulting from multilingual governance, courtly encounters, and the spread of religions. Words for liberty in different languages paralleled each other in bilingual legal documents, resonated with each other in different translations of religious texts, and stood next to each other in bureaucratic glossaries and dictionaries.&quot; The study concludes, &quot;thus, the concept(s) of liberty, instead of being a product of the West, is more accurately seen as a result of interactions among different parts of the world; the globalization of liberty did not start with the global expansion of the Euro-American empires but has a rich and complex history that predates them.&quot;

=== England and Great Britain ===
Timeline:
* 1066 – as a condition of his coronation William the Conqueror assented to the London Charter of Liberties which guaranteed the &quot;Saxon&quot; liberties of the City of London.
* 1100 – the Charter of Liberties is passed which sets out certain liberties of nobles, church officials and individuals.
* 1166 – Henry II of England transformed English law by passing the Assize of Clarendon. The act, a forerunner to trial by jury, started the abolition of trial by combat and trial by ordeal.
* 1187-1189 – publication of Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Anglie which contains authoritative definitions of freedom and servitude.
* 1215 – Magna Carta was enacted, becoming the cornerstone of liberty in first England, then Great Britain, and later the world.
* 1628 – the English Parliament passed the Petition of Right which set out specific liberties of English citizens.
* 1679 – the English Parliament passed the Habeas Corpus Act which outlawed unlawful or arbitrary imprisonment.
* 1689 – the Bill of Rights granted &quot;freedom of speech in Parliament&quot;, and reinforced many existing civil rights in England. The Scots law equivalent the Claim of Right is also passed.
* 1772 – the Somerset v Stewart judgement found that slavery was unsupported by common law in England and Wales.
* 1859 – an essay by the philosopher John Stuart Mill, entitled &quot;On Liberty&quot;, argued for toleration and individuality. &quot;If any opinion is compelled to silence, that opinion may, for aught we can certainly know, be true. To deny this is to assume our own infallibility.&quot;
* 1948 – British representatives attempted to but were prevented from adding a legal framework to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. (It was not until 1976 that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights came into force, giving a legal status to most of the Declaration.)
* 1958 – &quot;Two Concepts of Liberty&quot;, by Isaiah Berlin, identified &quot;negative liberty&quot; as an obstacle, as distinct from &quot;positive liberty&quot; which promotes self-mastery and the concepts of freedom.

=== United States ===
According to the 1776 United States Declaration of Independence, all people have a natural right to &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&quot;. This declaration of liberty was troubled for 90 years by the continued institutionalization of legalized Black slavery, as slave owners argued that their liberty was paramount since it involved property, their slaves, and that Blacks had no rights that any White man was obliged to recognize. The Supreme Court, in the 1857 Dred Scott decision, upheld this principle. In 1866, after the American Civil War, the US Constitution was amended to extend rights to persons of color, and in 1920 voting rights were extended to women.

By the later half of the 20th century, liberty was expanded further to prohibit government interference with personal choices. In the 1965 United States Supreme Court decision &quot;Griswold v. Connecticut&quot;, Justice William O. Douglas argued that liberties relating to personal relationships, such as marriage, have a unique primacy of place in the hierarchy of freedoms. Jacob M. Appel has summarized this principle:
In modern America, various competing ideologies have divergent views about how best to promote liberty. Liberals in the original sense of the word see equality as a necessary component of freedom. Progressives stress freedom from business monopoly as essential. Libertarians disagree, and see economic and individual freedom as best. The Tea Party movement sees &quot;big government&quot; as an enemy of freedom. Other major participants in the modern American libertarian movement include the Libertarian Party, the Free State Project, and the Mises Institute.

=== France ===

France supported the Americans in their revolt against English rule and, in 1789, overthrew their own monarchy, with the cry of &quot;Liberté, égalité, fraternité&quot;. The bloodbath that followed, known as the reign of terror, soured many people on the idea of liberty. Edmund Burke, considered one of the fathers of conservatism, wrote &quot;The French had shewn themselves the ablest architects of ruin that had hitherto existed in the world.&quot;

==Ideologies==

=== Liberalism ===

According to the &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics&quot;, liberalism is &quot;the belief that it is the aim of politics to preserve individual rights and to maximize freedom of choice&quot;. But they point out that there is considerable discussion about how to achieve those goals. Every discussion of freedom depends on three key components: who is free, what they are free to do, and what forces restrict their freedom. John Gray argues that the core belief of liberalism is toleration. Liberals allow others freedom to do what they want, in exchange for having the same freedom in return. This idea of freedom is personal rather than political. William Safire points out that liberalism is attacked by both the Right and the Left: by the Right for defending such practices as abortion, homosexuality, and atheism, and by the Left for defending free enterprise and the rights of the individual over the collective.

=== Libertarianism ===

According to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, libertarians hold liberty as their primary political value. Their approach to implementing liberty involves opposing any governmental coercion, aside from that which is necessary to prevent individuals from coercing each other.

Libertarianism is guided by the principle commonly known as the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP). The Non-Aggression Principle asserts that aggression against an individual or an individual&#x27;s property is always an immoral violation of one&#x27;s life, liberty, and property rights. Utilizing deceit instead of consent to achieve ends is also a violation of the Non-Aggression principle. Therefore, under the framework of the Non-Aggression principle, rape, murder, deception, involuntary taxation, government regulation, and other behaviors that initiate aggression against otherwise peaceful individuals are considered violations of this principle. This principle is most commonly adhered to by libertarians. A common elevator pitch for this principle is, &quot;Good ideas don&#x27;t require force.&quot;

=== Republican liberty ===

According to republican theorists of freedom, like the historian Quentin Skinner or the philosopher Philip Pettit, one&#x27;s liberty should not be viewed as the absence of interference in one&#x27;s actions, but as non-domination. According to this view, which originates in the Roman Digest, to be a &quot;liber homo&quot;, a free man, means not being subject to another&#x27;s arbitrary will, that is to say, dominated by another. They also cite Machiavelli who asserted that you must be a member of a free self-governing civil association, a republic, if you are to enjoy individual liberty.

The predominance of this view of liberty among parliamentarians during the English Civil War resulted in the creation of the liberal concept of freedom as non-interference in Thomas Hobbes&#x27; Leviathan.

=== Socialism ===

Socialists view freedom as a concrete situation as opposed to a purely abstract ideal. Freedom is a state of being where individuals have agency to pursue their creative interests unhindered by coercive social relationships, specifically those they are forced to engage in as a requisite for survival under a given social system. Freedom thus requires both the material economic conditions that make freedom possible alongside social relationships and institutions conducive to freedom.

The socialist conception of freedom is closely related to the socialist view of creativity and individuality. Influenced by Karl Marx&#x27;s concept of alienated labor, socialists understand freedom to be the ability for an individual to engage in creative work in the absence of alienation, where &quot;alienated labor&quot; refers to work people are forced to perform and un-alienated work refers to individuals pursuing their own creative interests.

==== Marxism ====

For Karl Marx, meaningful freedom is only attainable in a communist society characterized by superabundance and free access. Such a social arrangement would eliminate the need for alienated labor and enable individuals to pursue their own creative interests, leaving them to develop and maximize their full potentialities. This goes alongside Marx&#x27;s emphasis on the ability of socialism and communism progressively reducing the average length of the workday to expand the &quot;realm of freedom&quot;, or discretionary free time, for each person. Marx&#x27;s notion of communist society and human freedom is thus radically individualistic.

=== Anarchism ===

While many anarchists see freedom slightly differently, all oppose authority, including the authority of the state, of capitalism, and of nationalism. For the Russian revolutionary anarchist Mikhail Bakunin, liberty did not mean an abstract ideal but a concrete reality based on the equal liberty of others. In a positive sense, liberty consists of &quot;the fullest development of all the faculties and powers of every human being, by education, by scientific training, and by material prosperity.&quot; Such a conception of liberty is &quot;eminently social, because it can only be realized in society,&quot; not in isolation. In a negative sense, liberty is &quot;the revolt of the individual against all divine, collective, and individual authority.&quot;

<text>NGC 6397 (also known as Caldwell 86) is a globular cluster in the constellation Ara that was discovered by French astronomer Nicolas-Louis de Lacaille in 1752. It is located about 7,800 light-years from Earth, making it one of the two nearest globular clusters to Earth (the other one being Messier 4). The cluster contains around 400,000 stars, and can be seen with the naked eye under good observing conditions.

NGC 6397 is one of at least 20 globular clusters of the Milky Way Galaxy that have undergone a core collapse, meaning that the core has contracted to a very dense stellar .

==Astronomical research==

===Estimating the age of the Milky Way===
In 2004, a team of astronomers focused on the cluster to estimate the age of the Milky Way Galaxy. They used the UV-Visual Echelle Spectrograph of the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal to measure the beryllium content of two stars in the cluster. This allowed them to deduce the time elapsed between the rise of the first generation of stars in the entire Galaxy and the first generation of stars in the cluster. This, added to the estimated age of the stars in the cluster, gives an estimate for the age for the Galaxy: about 13.6 billion years, which is nearly as old as the universe itself. 
This estimate assumes that the NGC 6397 is not older than the Milky Way.

===Lower mass limit for stars===
In 2006, a study of NGC 6397 using the Hubble Space Telescope was published that showed a clear lower limit in the brightness of the cluster&#x27;s population of faint stars. The authors deduce that this indicates a lower limit for the mass necessary for stars to develop a core capable of fusion: roughly 0.083 times the mass of the Sun.

===Black holes and white dwarfs===

In February 2021, the core of NGC 6397 was reported to contain a relatively dense concentration of compact objects (white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes), based on the movement of stars near the core derived from data gathered by the Hubble Space Telescope and the European Space Agency&#x27;s Gaia spacecraft. 
The respective study argued that black holes could dominate the mass budget of this concentration, if the black holes were not ejected by means of dynamical interactions.
Indeed, another group of scientists shortly responded, claiming that because NGC 6397 has undergone core collapse, it should have started dense enough to speed its rates of dynamical interactions, and its original black hole population should be almost entirely gone. 
This group provided dynamical simulations that showed that a concentration of white dwarfs could explain the first measurement.

Finally, in 2022, a work was published by the former scientists, along with one of the leaders of the latter group, and other experts of Hubble and Gaia data.
This new work showed that the fits of the central mass excess in NGC 6397 from observed data agreed remarkably well with numerical simulations accounting for a population of hundreds of massive white dwarfs, and essentially no black holes.

=== Distant globular clusters ===
Hubble pictures revealed many distant globular clusters in galaxies far behind NGC 6397.

<text>Michael Terry Duke (born December 7, 1949) is an American businessman. He served as the fourth chief executive officer of Walmart from 2009 to 2013.

Duke was elected a member of the National Academy of Engineering (2010) for leadership and contributions to the design and implementation of innovative logistics and retail technologies.

==Biography==
Duke joined Walmart in 1995, serving as the executive in charge of the company&#x27;s international operations. He became the CEO of Walmart in February 2009, succeeding Lee Scott.

Duke also serves on the board of directors for the Retail Industry Leaders Association and Arvest Bank&#x27;s community advisory board. He formerly held positions with a number of retailers, including Federated Department Stores, May Department Stores, and Venture Stores. Duke earned a BS in Industrial Engineering from the Georgia Institute of Technology in 1971, where he joined the Delta Sigma Phi fraternity, and in 2009 served as a member of the institution&#x27;s advisory board. As of 2012 he sat on the board of directors of the Consumer Goods Forum.

In 2010 he set goals to make Walmart energy efficient as possible and to open Walmart stores in countries like Russia. In 2012, his salary was $18.2 million.

Duke ranked No. 10 on &quot;Forbes&quot; list of The World&#x27;s Most Powerful People in 2013. That same year, Walmart ranked No. 15 on &quot;Forbes&quot; list of Most Patriotic Brands—and the only retailer on the list—as voted by U.S. consumers. As of November 25, 2013, Duke&#x27;s tenure as CEO ended with his sudden replacement decided by Walmart&#x27;s Board. Press reports indicated that the total value of Duke&#x27;s pension, deferred compensation and other retirement accounts totaled over $113 million.

Duke said in 2012 that his biggest regret as CEO was not investing more in e-commerce to better compete with Amazon. &quot;I wish we had moved faster. We&#x27;ve proven ourselves to be successful in many areas, and I simply wonder why we didn&#x27;t move more quickly. This is especially true for e-commerce,&quot; Duke said at the time. &quot;Right now we&#x27;re making tremendous progress, and the business is moving, but we should have moved faster to expand this area.&quot;

<doc id="936415" wikidata="Q7263245" url="?curid=936415" title="Pyramid Dam">
<text>Pyramid Dam is a dam on Piru Creek located in northern Los Angeles County, north of Castaic and south of Gorman. Its reservoir, Pyramid Lake, stores water from the West Branch California Aqueduct for Ventura County and Los Angeles County. They are smaller than Castaic Dam and Lake, the other artificial water storage facility in the area, to the south.

==Funding and construction==
Construction of the dam was made possible by California voter approval in 1960 of the California Aqueduct project, also referred to as the Feather River project (the source of the water in the northern part of the state north of Auburn). State bonds were issued to finance the project. Pyramid Dam, which first began construction in 1968, is 386 feet (118 m) high. It lies directly behind the mountain rock giving the dam and lake its name - Pyramid Cut - which before the Ridge Route Alternate (later signed as U.S. Route 99) was built through the area in the 1931 to 1933 time period, was just another ordinary mountain. The highway construction of the Ridge Route Alternate caused this mountain to have part of its mass &quot;shaved&quot; off - reduced in size - and after the work to accommodate highway traffic was finished, the shape of the cut was found to resemble a pyramid, and hence the name.

==Statistics==
Pyramid Dam holds of water, covering an area of . Its maximum capacity is of water. The lake behind the dam, shaped like a &quot;Triceratops&quot; tooth, has been used for boating, swimming and camping since 1974. The dam and lake were built by the state of California Department of Water Resources (DWR), who maintains them today. The water stored there serves residents, businesses and farmers in Ventura County and LA County.

==US 99==
During the construction of Pyramid Dam, US 99 vehicle traffic was rerouted to Interstate 5 beginning in 1968. In the 1968-9 time period, motorists could still drive US 99 from Violin Summit to Hungry Valley Road (since renamed Smokey Bear Road). After completion of the dam in 1970 Feather River water began to fill the area behind the dam, a plan conceived of even before the construction of the Ridge Route Alternate. By 1972 the Ridge Route Alternate was fully submerged under the lake&#x27;s water. Since then, its northern border with the lake continues to serve as a boat ramp. The lake&#x27;s southern border portion of US 99 is closed to motorists.

<text>The 81st Street–Museum of Natural History station is a local station on the IND Eighth Avenue Line of the New York City Subway. It is served by the B on weekdays, the C train at all times except nights, and the A train during late nights only.

==History==
New York City mayor John Francis Hylan&#x27;s original plans for the Independent Subway System (IND), proposed in 1922, included building over of new lines and taking over nearly of existing lines. The lines were designed to compete with the existing underground, surface, and elevated lines operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and BMT. On December 9, 1924, the New York City Board of Transportation (BOT) gave preliminary approval for the construction of the IND Eighth Avenue Line. This line consisted of a corridor connecting Inwood, Manhattan, to Downtown Brooklyn, running largely under Eighth Avenue but also paralleling Greenwich Avenue and Sixth Avenue in Lower Manhattan. The BOT announced a list of stations on the new line in February 1928, with a local station at 79th Street (corresponding to the American Museum of Natural History&#x27;s main entrance).

The finishes at the five stations between 81st Street and 110th Street were 18 percent completed by May 1930. By that August, the BOT reported that the Eighth Avenue Line was nearly completed and that the five stations from 81st to 110th Street were 99 percent completed. The entire line was completed by September 1931, except for the installation of turnstiles. A preview event for the new subway was hosted on September 8, 1932, two days before the official opening. The 81st Street station opened on September 10, 1932, as part of the city-operated IND&#x27;s initial segment, the Eighth Avenue Line between Chambers Street and 207th Street. Construction of the whole line cost $191.2 million (equivalent to $ million in . While the IRT Broadway–Seventh Avenue Line already provided parallel service, the new Eighth Avenue subway via Central Park West provided an alternative route.

The station was renovated in 1998–2000, in coordination with the building of the new Hayden Planetarium, within the Rose Center for Earth and Space. The floors were replaced, new lighting was installed, the token booth was upgraded, and the walls and staircases were re-tiled. Structural improvements were also made during the renovation. In 2019, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority announced that the station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency&#x27;s 2020–2024 Capital Program.

A request for proposals was put out on May 18, 2023 for the contract for a project bundle to make 13 stations accessible, including 81st Street. The contract to add two elevators at the station was awarded in December 2023.

The work would include upgrades to electrical systems and the removal or relocation of some artwork. By mid-2024, the work was expected to be completed by 2026.

==Station layout==
This underground station has four tracks and two side platforms. On this section of the line, the local tracks are stacked, uptown above downtown, and the express tracks are stacked in the same order to the east of them, so both platforms are on the west side, one above the other. The station is at Central Park West and 81st Street, rather than the major crosstown 79th Street, in order to accommodate the American Museum of Natural History, which largely fills the area of what was once called the Manhattan Square. The 79th Street Transverse Road, through Central Park, exits the park here.

South of this station are storage/lay up tracks between the local and express tracks on each level. Both ends of the tracks merge with the express tracks, with switches to the local tracks.

===Exits===
There are two fare control areas, both on the upper platform. One is at the station&#x27;s extreme south end, on Central Park West midblock between 77th and 81st Streets. From this fare control, a passageway leads to a staircase on the west side of Central Park West, just south of the American Museum of Natural History&#x27;s front entrance. This fare control also has an underground entrance directly into the museum&#x27;s lowest level. The other is at the station&#x27;s north end, at Central Park West and West 81st Street. There is one staircase each to the northwest and southwest corners of the intersection.

==Artwork==

In 1976, with funding from the Exxon Corporation, this station, as well as three others citywide, received new &quot;artfully humorous graffiti&quot; murals and artwork. Local designer Mayers and Schiff received $5,000 to add murals of dinosaurs such as &quot;Thesaurus Rex, the dinosaur that had a vocabulary of a thousand words&quot; and &quot;Elongatomus, an elongated critter that stretched from coast to coast whose pelvic remains support a highway interchange in Missouri.&quot;

As part of the 1998–2000 station renovation, a program of tile mosaics was undertaken, covering the stairs and platforms, extending to floor inlays. Stairwells evoke descending into the geological strata of the Earth (at 81st Street) or into the Ocean (79th Street). Many creatures are evoked in mosaic vignettes that punctuate the stretches of white tiled wall. Fossil casts seem to emerge from the tiles as though the subway platform itself were an excavation, which it actually is. Under the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA)&#x27;s Arts for Transit program, a mixed-media installation was created in 2000. Entitled &quot;For Want of a Nail&quot;, named after the old proverb, it addresses the interconnections of entities that are as vast as a galaxy and as small as a single cell. Using ceramic tile, glass tile, glass mosaic, bronze relief, and granite as primary materials, the design team depicted the evolution of extinct, existing, and endangered life forms, from single-celled organisms to the towering &quot;T. rex&quot; dinosaur. It shows images and symbols ranging from the Earth&#x27;s core, to the sea, the sky and the cosmos beyond. No artist has been identified in this group project.

== In media ==
The station has been featured in the 2002 film &quot;Men in Black II&quot;. The station was also mentioned in &quot;Night at the Museum&quot;.

<text>Miracle Mile is a 1988 American apocalyptic thriller film written and directed by Steve De Jarnatt. The film stars Anthony Edwards and Mare Winningham. Its plot depicts the panic surrounding a supposed doomsday brought on by a sudden outbreak of war and its oncoming nuclear holocaust, taking place in a single day and mostly in real-time. The title is named after the Miracle Mile neighborhood of Los Angeles where most of the events take place.

==Plot==
Harry Washello and Julie Peters meet at the La Brea Tar Pits and immediately fall in love. They spend the afternoon together and arrange to meet again at midnight. However, due to a freak accident, a power failure results in Harry&#x27;s alarm not going off until much later. Julie cannot reach Harry, so she leaves for home. When Harry awakes that night, he realizes what has happened and rushes to Julie&#x27;s workplace, arriving at 4 AM. Harry tries calling Julie on a payphone but only reaches her answering machine, where he leaves an apology. The phone rings again and Harry answers, hearing a frantic man named Chip urgently warning that nuclear war will break out in less than 70 minutes. When Harry asks who is calling, Chip realizes he has dialed the wrong area code. He pleads with Harry to call his father and apologize for some past wrong before he is interrupted and presumably shot dead. An unfamiliar voice picks up the phone and tells Harry to forget everything he heard before disconnecting.

Harry, confused and not entirely convinced of the authenticity of the information, wanders back into the diner and tells the other customers what he has heard. As the patrons scoff at his story, one of them, a businesswoman named Landa, places calls to politicians in Washington and finds that they are all suddenly heading for &quot;the extreme Southern Hemisphere&quot;. She verifies that the launch codes Chip mentioned are real and, convinced of the danger, immediately charters private jets out of Los Angeles International Airport to a compound in a region in Antarctica with no rainfall. Most customers and staff leave with her in the owner&#x27;s delivery van. When the owner refuses to make any stops, Harry, unwilling to leave without Julie, arranges to meet the group at the airport and jumps from the truck.

Harry is helped and hindered by various strangers, who are initially unaware of the impending apocalypse. In the process, he inadvertently causes several deaths, which leaves him deeply shaken. When he finds Julie and tells her what is happening, she notes that there has been no confirmation of the attack. Desperate to reach the airport and not having a car, Harry finds a helicopter pilot and tells him to meet them on the roof of the Mutual Benefit Life Building, where Landa orders a helicopter and a large amount of supplies to be delivered. Julie has also tried to find a pilot on her own, and in the moments it takes to find her, Los Angeles descends into violent chaos. There is still no confirmation any of this is real, and Harry wonders if he has sparked a massive false panic in the example of Chicken Little. However, when he uses a phone booth to contact Chip&#x27;s father, he reaches a man who says his son is a soldier. Harry tries to pass on the message he was given, but the man hangs up before Harry finishes.

When they reach the top of the Mutual Benefit building they find the pad empty, with only Landa&#x27;s drunk co-worker on the roof. Any doubts about a false alarm are eliminated when a missile can be seen streaking across the sky. As they fear the end, the helicopter suddenly returns with the pilot badly wounded but fulfilling his promise to come back for them. After they lift off from the roof, several warheads hit and the nuclear E.M.P. from the detonations causes the helicopter to crash into the La Brea Tar Pits. As the helicopter sinks and the cabin fills with natural asphalt tar, Harry tries to comfort a hysterical Julie by saying someday their fossils will be found and they will probably be put in a museum, or that they might take a direct hit and be turned into diamonds. Julie, accepting her fate, calms down and takes comfort in Harry&#x27;s words, and the movie fades out as the tar fills the compartment. A final explosion seems to imply a direct hit has taken place.

==Cast==

* Anthony Edwards as Harry Washello
* Mare Winningham as Julie Peters
* Mykelti Williamson as Wilson (credited as &quot;Mykel T. Williamson&quot;)
* Denise Crosby as Landa
* Kelly Jo Minter as Charlotta (credited as &quot;Kelly Minter&quot;)

==Production==
Before &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; was made, its production had been legendary in Hollywood for ten years. In 1983, it had been chosen by &quot;American Film&quot; magazine as one of the ten best unmade screenplays. Steve De Jarnatt wrote it just out of the American Film Institute for Warner Brothers with the hope of directing it as well. The studio wanted to make it on a bigger scale and did not want to entrust the project with a first-time director like De Jarnatt.

&quot;Miracle Mile&quot; spent three years in production limbo until De Jarnatt optioned it himself, buying the script for $25,000. He rewrote it and the studio offered him $400,000 to buy it back. He turned them down. When he shopped it around to other studios, they balked at the mix of romance and nuclear war and the film&#x27;s downbeat ending. At one point, it nearly became the script for the eventual separately made &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot;. Before Anthony Edwards was cast, production nearly began with both Nicolas Cage and Kurt Russell. Of the script, Edwards said, &quot;It scared the hell out of me. It really made me angry too ... I just couldn&#x27;t believe that somebody had written this.&quot; John Daly of Hemdale Films gave De Jarnatt $3.7 million to make the film.

Edwards later recalled:

That was a script that everybody wanted to make, but they wanted him to change the ending. It was this great adventure, but they wanted it to have a happy ending. But he stuck it out, and luckily he stuck it out long enough that I was old enough to play the part. [Laughs.] So I got to do it, and we did it at a time when there really was no green screen for special effects. You had to shoot what was there. It&#x27;s amazing how dated that film looks now, because of our ability to do things technically now. I mean, it really looks antiquated. Mare Winningham is one of the greatest actresses ever. It was eight weeks of night shooting, though, so you&#x27;d be driving home from work at, like, 6 in the morning, having had a wrap beer, and then you&#x27;re suddenly going, &quot;Oh my God, what do people think of somebody having a beer at 6 in the morning whenever everyone else is on their way to work? [Laughs.]The following locations in Los Angeles were used: Johnie&#x27;s Coffee Shop; La Brea Tar Pits; Miracle Mile District; Pan-Pacific Auditorium in the Fairfax District.

==Reception==
&quot;Miracle Mile&quot; received generally positive reviews among critics. The review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 91% of critics gave the film a positive review, based on 32 reviews and the consensus: &quot;&quot;Miracle Mile&quot; brings about its small-scale doomsday tale with achingly rich bleakness and hypnotically nightmarish fervor.&quot;

Roger Ebert praised the film, claiming it had a &quot;diabolical effectiveness&quot; and a sense of &quot;real terror&quot;. In her review for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, Rita Kempley wrote: &quot;It seems [De Jarnatt]&#x27;s not committed to his story or his characters, but to the idea that he is saying something profound—which he isn&#x27;t.&quot; Stephen Holden, in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, wrote: &quot;As Harry and Julie, Mr. Edwards and Ms. Winningham make an unusually refreshing pair.&quot; In his review for the &quot;Boston Globe&quot;, Jay Carr called it: &quot;... a messy film, but it&#x27;s got energy, urgency, conviction and heat and you won&#x27;t soon forget it.&quot; British film and television critic Charlie Brooker, in an article for the BAFTA web site written in September 2008, awarded &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; the honor of having the &quot;Biggest Lurch of Tone&quot; of any film he had ever seen.

<text>The Jewel Box (also known as the Kappa Crucis cluster, NGC 4755, or Caldwell 94) is an open cluster in the constellation Crux, originally discovered by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1751–1752. This cluster was later named the Jewel Box by John Herschel when he described its telescopic appearance as &quot;... a superb piece of fancy jewellery&quot;. It is easily visible to the naked eye as a hazy star some 1.0° southeast of the first-magnitude star Mimosa (Beta Crucis). This hazy star was given the Bayer star designation &quot;Kappa Crucis&quot;, from which the cluster takes one of its common names. The modern designation Kappa Crucis has been assigned to one of the stars in the base of the A-shaped asterism of the cluster.

This cluster is one of the youngest known, with an estimated age of 14 million years. It has a total integrated magnitude 4.2, is located 2.16 kpc, or 7,060 light years from Earth, and contains just over 100 stars.

==Discovery and observation==

The Jewel Box as a star cluster was first found by Nicolas Louis de Lacaille while doing astrometric observations for his 1751–1752 southern star catalogue &quot;Cœlum Australe Stelliferum&quot; at the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa. He saw this as a nebulous cluster in his small 12 mm telescope, but was first to recognise it as a group of many stars.
The name &quot;Jewel Box&quot; comes from John Herschel&#x27;s own description of it:
: &quot;... this cluster, though neither a large nor a rich one, is yet an extremely brilliant and beautiful object when viewed through an instrument of sufficient aperture to show distinctly the very different colour of its constituent stars, which give it the effect of a superb piece of fancy jewellery.&quot;

Herschel recorded the positions of just over 100 members of the cluster in 1834–1838.

==Prominent members==

The central part of the cluster is framed by bright stars making up an A-shaped asterism.
The upper tip of this asterism is HD 111904 (HR 4887, HIP 62894), a B9 supergiant and suspected variable star. It is the brightest member of the A asterism at magnitude 5.77. The brightest star in the region of the cluster is the variable DS Cru (HD 111613, HR 4876), which lies well beyond the A asterism. It is a B9.5 α Cyg variable supergiant with an average visual brightness of magnitude 5.72, but is thought to be a foreground object.

The bar of the &quot;A&quot; consists of a line of four stars. On the right (south) is BU Cru, a magnitude 6.92 B2 supergiant and eclipsing binary. Next to it is BV Cru, a magnitude 8.662 B0.5 giant and Beta Cephei variable. Next in line is DU Cru, an M2 red supergiant that varies irregularly between magnitude 7.1 and 7.6 . The last of the four is CC Cru, a magnitude 7.83 B2 giant and ellipsoidal variable.

Each leg of the base of the asterism&#x27;s outline is marked by a blue supergiant star. HD 111990 (HIP 62953) is magnitude 6.77 and B1/2 . The star κ Cru itself is magnitude 5.98 and B3.

==Physical characteristics==

The Jewel Box cluster is one of the youngest known open clusters. The mean radial velocity of the Jewel Box cluster is .
The brightest stars in the Jewel Box cluster are supergiants, and include some of the brightest stars in the Milky Way galaxy.

Calculating its distance is difficult due to the proximity of the Coalsack Nebula, which obscures some of its light.

==Observation==

The Jewel Box cluster is regarded as one of the finest objects in the southern sky.
It is visible to the naked eye as a hazy object of the fourth magnitude.
It can be easily located using the star Beta Crucis as a guide, and appears as a fourth magnitude object.
It is impressive when viewed with binoculars or a small or large telescope. Three members along the crossbar of the A-shaped asterism lie in a straight line known as the &#x27;traffic lights&#x27; due to their varying colours.

<text>The Jewel Box is a pasticcio opera constructed by Paul Griffiths out of various pieces by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Its mostly English libretto by Paul Griffiths includes new translations of most of the Italian-language texts of the musical numbers. It was premiered by Opera North at the Theatre Royal, Nottingham, on 19 February 1991. The conductor was Elgar Howarth, the director was Francisco Negrin and the designer was Anthony Baker.

==Background==

Griffiths, realising that arias composed by Mozart for insertion in other composers&#x27; operas are seldom performed nowadays, worked up what he called &quot;a &quot;jeu d&#x27;esprit&quot;&quot; which also contained music from the composer&#x27;s unfinished operas &quot;Lo sposo deluso&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;oca del Cairo&quot; and some of the arias which he had written for concert performances. This came to the attention of Nicholas Payne, General Director of Opera North, who scheduled its première for 1991, the year of the bicentenary of Mozart&#x27;s death.

==Performance history==

After the Nottingham premiere and subsequent performances in Opera North&#x27;s territory of northern England, the opera was performed in the United States by Skylight Opera Theatre (1993), Wolf Trap Opera (1994), Chicago Opera Theater (1996), and New Jersey State Opera (1996). In England, it was revived by Bampton Classical Opera in 2006 for the 250th anniversary of Mozart&#x27;s birth, with the orchestra conducted by Edward Gardner.

The Editor of Opera magazine Rodney Milnes was enthusiastic about &quot;The Jewel Box&quot;; &quot;If anything more ingenious and original happens by way of a special event in Mozart year than Opera North&#x27;s and Paul Griffiths&#x27;s &quot;The Jewel Box&quot;, then I&#x27;ll eat my hat&quot;. He went on - &quot;his greatest triumph has been to string his pearls together into an entirely logical musical order, &#x27;a Mozartian key sequence,&#x27; as he wrote, &#x27;through thirds and fifths, and simultaneously distributing the numbers helpfully among the singers&quot;. He found that the opera was &quot;a convincing musical entity in its own right, [which] rescues from the library shelf a substantial body of top-drawer Mozart written mostly for the theatre, and indeed returns it to the theatre where it belongs. It&#x27;s crammed full of great music almost to the point of indigestion&quot;.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==

Four characters from the commedia dell&#x27;arte (Dottore, Pantalone, Colombina and Pedrolino) open the opera with a quartet. There is no more music, so the Dottore summons the Composer, who, with the aid of a singer of tragic music and his own father, gradually works out how the opera should go. The opera ends with an epilogue sung by the Composer.

<text>Gaston Millochau (12 October 1866 – 18 November 1922) was a French astronomer from Toulouse.

From 1899 until 1903 he observed Mars at the Meudon Observatory and reported some details visible on its surface. In contrast to other observers at that time he did not see any canal-like features.

A crater on Mars was named in his honor. Awarded the Janssen Medal from the French Academy of Sciences in 1905.

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiroya Oku. There are two separate &quot;Hen&quot; series, both published in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Young Jump&quot;; the first one from 1989 to 1994 and the second from 1995 to 1997. Both series received a television drama adaptation broadcast on TV Asahi in 1996. The second series received a two-episode original video animation (OVA) adaptation released in 1997. In North America, the OVA was licensed by Central Park Media, under the title Strange Love, and released on DVD in 2002.

==Plot==
*First series (&quot;Suzuki and Satō&quot;):
:, a straight young man who becomes besotted with another guy, , convinced his love is a girl trapped in a boy&#x27;s body. The first three volumes of this series collect Oku&#x27;s early short stories, including prototype versions of both &quot;Hen&quot; series.
*Second series (&quot;Chizuru and Azumi&quot;):
:Student Chizuru Yoshida, to her utmost horror, falls in love with another girl, the innocent Azumi Yamada. A prototype version of this story was published in the second volume of the first series.

==Characters==
*Note: Characters from the second series
: 
: A beautiful and perfect high school student who excels in everything she does, Chizuru is every man&#x27;s dream and she knows it. A promiscuous and very sexually active person who plays men for whatever she wants, the young model has a great life until she meets her current fling&#x27;s new neighbors. Instantly Chizuru, a girl who has never known love, falls heavily for the young female neighbor, Azumi Yamada. Chizuru, refusing to admit it at first, quickly comes to realize she must be with Azumi at any cost. Now living with her fake boyfriend, Hiroyuki, just one apartment away from Azumi, she puts forth every effort to constantly be around her crush. She has an interesting physique compared to other female characters; although she is slender, she has large breasts in contrast to the rest of her willowy figure. The English dub portrays Chizuru as an older teenage college student whereas in the Japanese version she is in high school and around 16 to 17 years old.
: 
: Azumi is an innocent and average looking high school student. However, after moving from Kyushu to a new city and new apartment complex she meets Chizuru. At first the friendly Azumi tries to be nice to Chizuru, only to be harshly rejected. Eventually though, the two become friends, although Azumi fears that there might be something weird about Chizuru. Azumi, who wishes to become a screenwriter, one day attempts to join the drama club. There she befriends a young, amateur film maker named Ryuichi Kobayashi.

: Ryuichi is also a newly transferred high school student who enjoys making movies in his free time. Upon meeting Chizuru in the infirmary, he quickly falls in love with her face, wishing for her to be an actress in one of his movies. Ryuichi eventually befriends Azumi as they attempt to join the drama club.
: 
: Karasawa, who appears as the main character for several of the opening chapters, is a new teacher at Momoyuri College (high school in the Japanese version), the same school Chizuru and Azumi attend. He quickly falls in love with Chizuru after recognizing her as a model. After a little effort, Karasawa is able to trick Chizuru into admitting she is a model, infuriating her. She then convinces Karasawa to let her sleep at his apartment for the night, where she enacts vengeance through teasing him to some degree or another throughout the night.
: 
: A young Japanese rock star, living in his parents&#x27; mansion (a large Japanese apartment considered to be more like a suite) and on their money, he was yet another fling of the beautiful Chizuru. However, when his new neighbors moved in with their daughter Azumi Yamada, Chizuru quickly claimed him as her boyfriend. Hiroyuki, realizing that Chizuru has a crush on Azumi, but truly believing that she loves him, has formed a plan to seduce and sleep with Azumi, ruining her for Chizuru.

<text>Miracle Mile is a neighborhood in the city of Los Angeles, California.

It contains a stretch of Wilshire Boulevard known as Museum Row. It also contains two Historic Preservation Overlay Zones: the Miracle Mile and the Miracle Mile North HPOZ.

==Geography==
Miracle Mile&#x27;s boundaries are roughly 3rd Street on the north, Highland Avenue on the east, San Vicente Boulevard on the south, and Fairfax Avenue on the west. Major thoroughfares include Wilshire and Olympic boulevards, La Brea and Fairfax avenues, and 6th Street.

Google Maps identifies an irregularly shaped area labeled &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; that runs from Ogden Drive on the west to Citrus Avenue and La Brea Avenue on the east. The area is roughly bordered on the north by 4th Street and on the south by 12th Street.

==History==
In the early 1920s, Wilshire Boulevard west of Western Avenue was an unpaved farm road, extending through dairy farms and bean fields. Developer A. W. Ross saw potential for the area and developed Wilshire as a commercial district to rival downtown Los Angeles. The &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; nickname first appeared in local newspapers on January 27, 1929.

The Miracle Mile development was initially anchored by the May Company Department Store with its landmark 1939 Streamline Moderne building on the west and the E. Clem Wilson Building on the east, then Los Angeles&#x27;s tallest commercial building. The Wilson Building had a dirigible mast on top and was home to a number of businesses and professionals relocating from downtown. The success of the new alternative commercial and shopping district negatively affected downtown real estate values, and triggered development of the multiple downtowns that characterize contemporary Los Angeles.

Ross&#x27;s insight was that the form and scale of his Wilshire strip should attract and serve automobile traffic rather than pedestrian shoppers. He applied this design both to the street itself and to the buildings lining it. Ross gave Wilshire various &quot;firsts,&quot; including dedicated left-turn lanes and timed traffic lights, the first in the United States. He also required merchants to provide automobile parking lots, all to aid traffic flow. Major retailers such as Desmond&#x27;s, Silverwoods, May Co., Coulter&#x27;s, Harris and Frank, Ohrbach&#x27;s, Mullen &amp; Bluett, Phelps-Terkel, Myer Siegel, and Seibu eventually spread down Wilshire Boulevard from Fairfax to La Brea. Ross ordered that all building facades along Wilshire be engineered so as to be best seen through a windshield. This meant larger, bolder, simpler signage and longer buildings in a larger scale. They also had to be oriented toward the boulevard and architectural ornamentation and massing must be perceptible at 30 MPH (50 km/h) instead of at walking speed. These building forms were driven by practical requirements but contributed to the stylistic language of Art Deco and Streamline Moderne.
Ross&#x27;s moves were unprecedented, a huge commercial success, and proved historically influential. Ross had invented the car-oriented urban form — what Reyner Banham called &quot;the linear downtown&quot; model later adopted across the United States. The moves also contributed to Los Angeles&#x27;s reputation as a city dominated by the car. A sculptural bust of Ross stands at 5800 Wilshire, with the inscription, &quot;A. W. Ross, founder and developer of the Miracle Mile. Vision to see, wisdom to know, courage to do.&quot;

As wealth and newcomers poured into the fast-growing city, Ross&#x27;s parcel became one of Los Angeles&#x27;s most desirable areas. Acclaimed as &quot;America&#x27;s Champs-Élysées,&quot; this stretch of Wilshire near the La Brea Tar Pits was named &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; for its improbable rise to prominence. Although the preponderance of shopping malls and the development in the 1960s of financial and business districts in downtown and Century City lessened the Miracle Mile&#x27;s importance as a retail and business center, the area has regained its vitality thanks to the addition of several museums and commercial high-rises.

The black and gold Deco Building in Art Deco style at 5209 Wilshire was built in 1929, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was designed by the architecture firm of Morgan, Walls &amp; Clements, which also designed the Wiltern Theatre, the El Capitan Theatre, and other notable buildings in Los Angeles.

==Museum Row==

The Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA), The Petersen Automotive Museum, Craft Contemporary, George C. Page Museum, and La Brea Tar Pits pavilions, among others, create &quot;Museum Row&quot; on the Miracle Mile.

The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, designed by Renzo Piano, is located in the former May Company Department Store on the corner of Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue. A new contemporary structure for the museum&#x27;s theaters is located behind the building. 

==Historic Preservation Overlay Zones==

Miracle Mile contains two Historic Preservation Overlay Zones.

The Miracle Mile comprises 1,347 properties. Its boundaries are Wilshire Boulevard to the north, San Vicente Boulevard to the south, La Brea Avenue to the east, and Orange Grove Avenue to the west. It is located in the city&#x27;s Wilshire community plan area.

The Miracle Mile North primarily consists of single-family residences which are uniform in scale, massing and setbacks, the majority of which were built from 1924 to 1941. Its boundaries are Gardner and Detroit streets, between Beverly Boulevard and Third Street. It is located in the city&#x27;s Wilshire community plan area.

==Transportation==

Los Angeles Metro&#x27;s D Line subway is being extended along Wilshire Boulevard to the Veterans Affairs Hospital, from its current terminus at Western Avenue in Koreatown.

In 1985, A federal ban on tunneling operations in the area was passed at the behest of the district&#x27;s congressional representative Henry Waxman after an explosion, caused by the buildup of methane seeping up through the district&#x27;s long-depleted oil wells, destroyed a department store. The ban was implemented despite the fact that methane deposits abound in most of Los Angeles. In late 2005, the ban was overturned, owing to tunneling techniques that make it possible to mitigate the methane concern. A westerly extension of the subway was then supported by many civic officials in Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and Santa Monica, the three cities through which the proposed extension runs. In early 2008, the project—which is destined to terminate in Santa Monica—received $5 billion in federal funds. In late 2008, Measure R passed, releasing $10 billion in reserve funds to start work on public transit projects in Los Angeles County. Service to three new stations, La Brea Station, Fairfax Station and La Cienega Station, is expected to begin in 2025.

==Education==
The area is within the Los Angeles Unified School District, Board District 4.

==Landmarks==
Landmarks include The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Petersen Automotive Museum, SAG-AFTRA, the El Rey Theatre, La Brea Tar Pits, Park La Brea Apartments, 5900 Wilshire, Ace Gallery, the Zachary All building (5467), the Olympia Medical Center, and the Academy Museum of Motion Pictures. Johnie&#x27;s Coffee Shop is leased mostly for filmmaking, but was also utilized as the west coast campaign office for Bernie Sanders presidential campaign, 2016. At the border on the Northwest corner is the Writers Guild of America, West, and at the border on the North is the Farmers Market, and The Grove, followed by Pan-Pacific Park.

<doc id="936459" wikidata="Q961683" url="?curid=936459" title="Birmingham Triennial Music Festival">
<text>The Birmingham Triennial Musical Festival, in Birmingham, England, founded in 1784, was the longest-running classical music festival of its kind. It last took place in 1912.

==History==

The first music festival, over three days in September 1768, was to help raise funds to complete the new General Hospital on Summer Lane. It proved to be very popular and successful, but it took another event in 1778 to achieve the funds required. The hospital opened September 1779.

From September 1784 the performances became a permanent feature and ran every three years, becoming the Birmingham Triennial Musical Festival, still with the aim of raising funds for the hospital.

Originally hosted in St Philip&#x27;s Church (later to become the city&#x27;s cathedral) or the Theatre Royal on New Street the available venues became too small for the festival. As a result, the Birmingham Town Hall was built, and opened in 1834 to house it. The festival for 1832 was delayed by two years during its erection.

Vocal works were generally sung in English. Hans Richter was appointed principal conductor in 1885.

==Mendelssohn==

In 1837 Felix Mendelssohn conducted a performance of his &quot;St. Paul&quot; oratorio, played the organ, and played the piano part in the premiere of his second Piano Concerto, specially commissioned by the Festival. He appeared in the following festival, playing his first Piano Concerto. During that visit, he made a pen and ink sketch of the Town Hall.

For the 1846 festival he composed and conducted the premiere of his oratorio &quot;Elijah&quot;, another new work commissioned by the Festival. He was paid 200 guineas. &quot;Elijah&quot; was played at every successive festival. Mendelssohn died a year later.

The Birmingham Festival Choral Society (still extant, in 2021) was founded in 1845, for the purpose of providing the chorus for the festivals, and sang at the premiere of &quot;Elijah&quot;.

==Commissions==

In 1873 the Festival commissioned Arthur Sullivan who composed his oratorio &quot;The Light of the World&quot;.

The 1879 Festival commissioned a work from Max Bruch, &quot;Das Lied von der Glocke&quot;.

In 1882 Charles Gounod was commissioned and produced &quot;Redemption&quot;, which was performed twice.

In 1885 Antonín Dvořák provided &quot;The Spectre&#x27;s Bride&quot; and Gounod provided &quot;Mors et Vita&quot;.

In 1891 Dvořák&#x27;s commission delivered his &quot;Requiem&quot; for £650.

1900 saw the commission &quot;The Dream of Gerontius&quot; from Edward Elgar. The chorus master, Charles Swinnerton Heap had died suddenly four months before the concert was due, and with ten works in hand and only one copy of the score, rehearsal started only a few days before the performance date. It was not sung well but was strongly applauded and well reviewed as a composition. Elgar returned in 1903 with &quot;The Apostles&quot;, and 1906 with &quot;The Kingdom&quot;. His commission for 1912 created &quot;The Music Makers&quot;, incorporating themes from the &quot;Enigma Variations&quot;, &quot;Gerontius&quot;, his violin concerto, and &quot;The Apostles&quot;. The principal conductor for 1912 was Henry Wood.

==The end==
The 1909 and 1912 festivals ran at a loss, providing no donation to the General Hospital. World War I marked the end of the Triennial Festivals.

<text>Messier 41 (also known as M41 or NGC 2287) is an open cluster in the constellation Canis Major. It is sometimes referred to as the Little Beehive Cluster. It was discovered by Giovanni Batista Hodierna before 1654 and was perhaps known to Aristotle about 325 BC. It lies about four degrees almost exactly south of Sirius, with which it forms a roughly equilateral triangle with Nu2 Canis Majoris to the west—all three figure in the same field in binoculars.

The cluster covers an area about the size of the full moon. It contains about 100 stars, including several red giants the brightest of which has spectral type K3, apparent magnitude 6.3 and is near the center, and some white dwarfs. The cluster is estimated to be moving away from us at 23.3 km/s. The diameter of the cluster is . It is estimated to be 190 million years old, and cluster properties and dynamics suggest a total life expectancy of 500 million years for this cluster, before it will have disintegrated.

Walter Scott Houston describes the appearance of the cluster in small telescopes:
Many visual observers speak of seeing curved lines of stars in M41. Although they seem inconspicuous on photographs, the curves stand out strongly in my 10-inch [reflecting telescope], and the bright red star near the center of the cluster is prominent.
The bright red/orange star near the center is HIP 32406, a giant star of spectral type K2, about 1500 ly away of magnitude 6.9.

<text>Jerry Ernest Knight (April 17, 1952 – December 29, 1996) was an American R&amp;B vocalist and bassist who reached prominence in the late 1970s and early 1980s, during which he was part of several groups and had a brief solo career.

==Career==
A Los Angeles native, he first gained recognition as a founding member, along with Ray Parker Jr., of the R&amp;B group Raydio, singing vocals on their early hit &quot;Jack and Jill.&quot; Prior to this, he was a session player for many artists, notably providing bass on Bill Withers “Lovely Day.”

Knight left Raydio after before their second album was released to pursue a solo career, going on to release three solo albums and achieving moderate success with minor hits such as &quot;Overnight Sensation,&quot; &quot;Perfect Fit&quot; and &quot;Turn It Out&quot;.

In 1983, Knight teamed with session drummer Ollie E. Brown to form Ollie &amp; Jerry. They provided the title track to the soundtrack for the 1984 movie &quot;Breakin&#x27;,&quot; which reached #9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. They also recorded the title track for &quot;Breakin&#x27; 2: Electric Boogaloo,&quot; which got to #45 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart.

Shortly after Ollie &amp; Jerry parted ways in 1985, Knight began working with the Jets, co-writing their early hits &quot;Crush On You,&quot; &quot;Curiosity,&quot; and &quot;Private Number&quot;. Although his career as an artist faded, Knight continued to write and produce for other acts such as the Whispers, Patrice Rushen, DeBarge, Howard Hewett and Elkie Brooks.

==Personal life and death==
According to an interview with his Raydio bandmate Ray Parker, Jr., Raydio&#x27;s song &quot;Jack and Jill&quot; was actually written about Knight and his wife, whose real name was Jill (Maxine) Knight. Parker added that Knight and Jill had two children together (Dereck and Lindsay).

Knight died of cancer in Los Angeles on December 29, 1996, at age 44. He is buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery.

<text>Gantz (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Hiroya Oku. It was serialized in Shueisha&#x27;s manga magazine &quot;Weekly Young Jump&quot; from June 2000 to June 2013, with its chapters collected in 37 volumes. It tells the story of Kei Kurono and Masaru Kato, both of whom died in a train accident and become part of a semi-posthumous &quot;game&quot; in which they and several other recently deceased people are forced to hunt down and kill aliens armed with a handful of futuristic items, equipment, and weaponry.

An anime television series adaptation, directed by Ichiro Itano and animated by Gonzo, was broadcast for 26 episodes, divided into two seasons, in 2004. A series of two live-action films based on the manga were produced and released in January and April 2011. A CGI anime film, &quot;&quot;, was released in 2016.

==Plot==

A pair of high school students, Kei Kurono and Masaru Kato, are hit by a subway train in an attempt to save the life of a drunk homeless man who had fallen onto the tracks. Following their deaths, Kurono and Kato find themselves transported to the interior of an unfurnished Tokyo apartment, where they meet Joichiro Nishi, a Gantz veteran, and other clueless participants. The pair soon realizes that they are not allowed to leave the apartment. At one end of the room there is a large black sphere known as &quot;Gantz&quot;.

After some time in the room, the Gantz sphere opens up, revealing a bald naked man with a breathing mask and wires attached to his head, and various weapons for them to use. These include the custom fitting black suits which give them super-human strength, speed, stamina and damage resistance, a controller which acts as a radar and stealth unit, X-gun, X-Shotgun, Y-Gun. Later on the series the Gantz sword, Gantz Bike are made available as well as much more powerful weapons are awarded in the 100 point menu.

When the Gantz sphere opens, green text appears on its surface, informing those present that their &quot;lives have ended and now belong to him&quot;. A picture and brief information is shown of some of the Gantz&#x27; targets; Gantz orders them to go and kill them. Except for a single mission, all the targets are aliens living on Earth, which take on a wide variety of forms. During the mission, normal people cannot see the players or the aliens. Gantz transports them to the area of the mission, and they cannot leave or return until all the enemies have been killed, or the time limit has run out. If they survive a successful mission, each individual is awarded points for the aliens they have killed. Once a participant has scored 100 points, a &quot;100 point menu&quot; will appear. The menu offers three options:
*Option 1: The participant can return to their normal life, never having to be summoned by Gantz again. As a price, their memories of Gantz and the missions will be erased.
*Option 2: The participant obtains a unique and extremely powerful weapon.
*Option 3: The participant can revive someone who has died during a mission from Gantz&#x27; memory. This option appeared halfway through the series.

After a mission has been completed, points are tallied up, the participants are allowed to leave and do as they see fit until their next mission, with the exception of talking about Gantz, which would lead to their heads exploding. During Kurono and Kato&#x27;s third mission, all the participants except Kurono are killed, however, Kato kills the last boss, giving Kurono a chance to survive. Kurono survives the third mission bleeding on the floor with his limbs cut apart. After the third mission Kurono starts to change inside, adopting a hero complex similar to Kato&#x27;s personality. As the series continues, Kurono participates with the objective of reviving his deceased friends with the 100 point reward option. A new team of Gantz players is assembled, which Kurono leads, as the most experienced veteran and one of the best fighters. In the Oni mission it is shown that with Kurono&#x27;s &quot;will to live&quot; he becomes the most ferocious Gantz hunter in the team. Through his interactions with the other members of the team and his life or death battles, Kurono gradually grows into a responsible leader. After the Oni mission Kato is revived by Kurono, and soon after Kurono meets his demise against the vampires. As the series goes on, the rules of the missions change; they can now be seen by regular people, the aliens they encounter are increasingly more powerful and dangerous, and they participate in a mission with another Gantz team from Osaka. Kato becomes the center of attention in the manga and his quest to revive Kurono. In a desperate attempt to revive his best friend, Kato fights the one hundred point alien Nurarihyon which obliterates both Osaka and Kurono&#x27;s team. At the end of the mission, similar to the first time Kato died, he defeats arguably the strongest alien in the series and is laid bleeding on the floor. The series depicts both the missions and Kurono&#x27;s regular life, as well as the daily lives of other Gantz players (to a lesser extent).

After several missions, an old participant named Nishi, who knows more than the others about how Gantz works, shows them a &quot;catastrophe countdown&quot; on the Gantz sphere which the other players were unaware of. The countdown reveals that there is one week left until some unknown &quot;catastrophe.&quot; At the end of that week, a massive alien force invades the Earth and begins exterminating the human race, while Kurono and his companions try their best to make use of Gantz&#x27; advanced technology and weaponry in defense. At the end, Nishi and Kurono are depicted to be similar, both of whom were despised by their family and were sinister; however, unlike Nishi, Kurono has a reason to live. Nishi, in the chapter &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, is left for dead by Kurono, vowing vengeance against him and crying out for Gantz and mother for help. It is hinted that Nishi died, but his death seems to be unclear. The Japanese also learn of the existence of Gantz teams all around the world. After a long battle, the humans manage to stop the alien invasion and soon after, it is revealed that it was another, highly advanced alien species that provided mankind with the means to defend itself against the invaders, for reasons they refuse to reveal, calling it a whim. In a desperate last effort, the leader of the alien forces, Eeva, challenges the whole human race, promising to exterminate every inhabitant by himself by crashing their mother ship, killing both races if Kurono does not come to their mother ship to fight him. Prior to this announcement Eeva completely dominates all Gantz teams in his vicinity by killing all the hunters, giving the human race a sense of their mortality. The world calls on Kurono, which is broadcast to the entire world, and, with a revived Kato&#x27;s help, Kurono bets all his chance of winning and saving the human race on himself. Kurono manages to defeat Eeva, thus preventing the alien mothership from destroying Earth. The series ends with Kurono and Kato returning safely to Earth and being greeted as heroes.

==Production==
Hiroya Oku first thought of &quot;Gantz&quot;″s story when he was in high school. He was inspired by the &quot;jidaigeki&quot; program Hissatsu, and the Robert Sheckley novel &quot;Time Killer&quot;. However, he did not decide to make &quot;Gantz&quot; until after writing the manga &quot;Zero One&quot;; &quot;Zero One&quot; had a similar setting, but Oku ended the series, noting it was not very entertaining and that it was too expensive to develop.

When creating the chapters for the manga, Oku starts with a thumbnail of the pages. He then creates 3D models of the characters and backgrounds on his computer. Once done, Oku prints the characters and backgrounds he made in 3D, adds tone and color to the pages, and finishes with sound effects and dialogue. He had already used this style in &quot;Zero One&quot;, but for that title, there was little work in hand drawing; Oku decided to add more hand drawing to give &quot;Gantz&quot; a more realistic tone as well as reduce the budget. However, he still notes that such a method is time-consuming and that he has to work quickly in order to finish the chapters on time.

Oku tries to incorporate realism into &quot;Gantz&quot; and adds that some of the events occurring in the story are based on his opinions regarding the world. During violent or erotic scenes, Oku makes sure to not make them very long to avoid reducing the series&#x27; realism. However, he has mentioned that he does not autocensor and that all the drawings he has ever illustrated have been published in the manga. Some plot twists are meant to go against common events that happen in several manga such as the deaths of the major characters like Kei Kishimoto and Masaru Kato. Before the series started serialization, Oku told his assistants that with Kurono&#x27;s exception, all the major characters from the series would die.

==Reception==
Japanese sales from the &quot;Gantz&quot; manga have led several of the volumes to be featured in lists of best seller volumes from Japan. By November 2010, the &quot;Gantz&quot; manga had sold over 10 million units in Japan, while during January 2011 the sales increased to over 15 million volumes. By June 2013, the manga had reportedly sold 20 million copies. By November 2021, the manga had over 24 million copies in circulation.

During 2008, Dark Horse Comics announced that the &quot;Gantz&quot; series had sold 175,000 copies in America. Volume 4 of the manga reached eighth place on &quot;The New York Times&quot; &quot;Manga Best Seller List&quot;.

DVD sales of &quot;Gantz&quot; have been particularly strong. According to Anime News Network, Gantz volume three surpassed DVD sales of its predecessor, volume one, by a significant margin. Owing to strong DVD sales, ADV films has continuously released successive volumes and it was one of the most successful anime franchises of 2005.

<doc id="936482" wikidata="Q5291183" url="?curid=936482" title="Dominique Vandenberg">
<text>Dominique Vandenberg is a Belgian martial artist, actor and stunt performer.

Vandenberg lives in California, where he has appeared in such movies as &quot;Pit Fighter&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;.

== Background ==
Dominique Vandenberg was born Dominique Horevoets in Waasmont, Belgium. As a young adult, Vandenberg competed in many martial arts competitions, winning most of them, and left school at age sixteen to enroll in a Kunto training course in Okinawa, Japan. After graduating the course in a tie for first rank, Vandenberg returned to Belgium, where he was drafted into the military. Vandenberg volunteered for a post in Germany as it offered a shorter service of eight months (as opposed to a year). Immediately upon his release, Vandenberg began training for an invitational freestyle martial arts competition he had been invited to upon completion of the Kunto course. Vandenberg won the competition with only two months of training but was hit by a car and broke his leg.

Unable to fight in further events, Vandenberg left Belgium to join the French Foreign Legion. Graduating from basic training in the top five, he was allowed to pick his post. Vandenberg chose the elite paratrooper regiment, the 2REP, and, after more training, was sent to Africa. He spent five years in countries such as Chad, Nigeria, and the Central African Republic, fighting to control rebellions. During this time, he met his fiancée, Waruny, a freedom fighter. After their meeting, he returned to fulfill his last eight months of service to the Legion, but when he returned, she had been killed.

Vandenberg then left the Legion for good and traveled to Thailand to fight in their famed freestyle fighting rings, or &quot;iron circles&quot;. After winning several bouts, he returned to Europe.

<doc id="936488" wikidata="Q1987105" url="?curid=936488" title="Grebo (music)">
<text>Grebo (or grebo rock) was a short-lived subculture and broadly-defined subgenre of indie rock centred around the Midlands, particularly Stourbridge and Leicester. Musically, the genre incorporated elements of electronic, punk rock, folk and hip hop music into indie rock. The scene occupied the period in the late 1980s and early 1990s in the United Kingdom before the popularisation of Britpop and grunge.

==Etymology==
Derived from &quot;greaser&quot;, the word &quot;grebo&quot; began being used in the 1970s as a slang term for bikers with long hair. The word was re-fashioned by the group Pop Will Eat Itself that represented a brand of United Kingdom subculture of the late 1980s and early 1990s, largely based in the English Midlands. The scene particularly was centred on Stourbridge and Leicester.

==History==
Fronted by Pop Will Eat Itself, the Wonder Stuff and Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin, the bands quickly gained attention: Pop Will Eat Itself&#x27;s 1989 singles &quot;Wise Up! Sucker&quot; and &quot;Can U Dig It?&quot; both entered the UK Top 40 and Stourbridge briefly became a tourist attraction for young indie rock fans. The seminal albums from the scene were released between 1989 and 1993: the Wonder Stuff&#x27;s &quot;Hup&quot; and &quot;Never Loved Elvis&quot;; Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin&#x27;s &quot;God Fodder&quot; and &quot;Are You Normal?&quot;; and Pop Will Eat Itself&#x27;s &quot;This Is the Day...This Is the Hour...This Is This!&quot; and &quot;The Looks or the Lifestyle?&quot;. In this period, the scene&#x27;s bands became fixtures, sometimes headliners, at Reading Festival, sold millions of albums and were frequently featured on the covers of magazines like &quot;NME&quot; and &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. Grebo bands were distinct from prior indie rock groups not only because of their broad influences, but their subversion of the twee or unhappy moods of most other bands in the genre, and their pursuit of a heavier sound and aesthetic. The scene came to include the stylistically similar bands of nearby Leicester: the Bomb Party, Gaye Bykers on Acid, Crazyhead, the Hunters Club and Scum Pups. The term has also been used to describe Jesus Jones from Wiltshire.

A younger subset of grebo bands emerged around 1991, who were in turn labelled &quot;fraggle&quot; bands. During this movement, the dominant sound was a style of indie rock that was heavily indebted to punk and Nirvana&#x27;s album &quot;Bleach&quot; album, while also occasionally making use of drum machines. &quot;Gigwise&quot; writer Steven Kline described the style as &quot;filthy guitars, filthier hair and t-shirts only a mother would wash&quot;. Prominent fraggle acts included Senseless Things, Mega City Four and Carter the Unstoppable Sex Machine.

==Characteristics==
The grebo genre was broadly defined, and used more as a name for the Stourbridge scene than as a genre label. For the most part, it was a style of indie rock which drew influences from a diverse array of genres, including electronic, punk, folk, hip-hop music, dance-rock, psychedelia and pop. Pop Will Eat Itself adopted an industrial alternative rock style that combined &quot;heavy metal and hard rock guitar riffs, electro-dance rhythms, samples and rap vocals.&quot; While Gaye Bykers on Acid&#x27;s use of hip-hop and dance beats was considered as &quot;a major innovation in mid-&#x27;80s alternative rock,&quot; Ned&#x27;s Atomic Dustbin focused on &quot;the hyper punk aspect&quot; of the movement, relying on &quot;catchy hooks and a dual-bass sound.&quot;

Grebo artists and fans sported long hair, dreadlocks and baggy shorts.
