<text>Tagalog grammar (Tagalog: &quot;Balarilà ng Tagalog&quot;) are the rules that describe the structure of expressions in the Tagalog language, one of the languages in the Philippines.

In Tagalog, there are nine parts of speech: nouns (&quot;pangngalan&quot;), pronouns (&quot;panghalíp&quot;), verbs (&quot;pandiwà&quot;), adverbs (&quot;pang-abay&quot;), adjectives (&quot;pang-urì&quot;), prepositions (&quot;pang-ukol&quot;), conjunctions (&quot;pangatníg&quot;), ligatures (&quot;pang-angkóp&quot;) and particles.

Tagalog is an agglutinative yet slightly inflected language.

Pronouns are inflected for number and verbs for focus/voice and aspect.

==Verbs==
Tagalog verbs are complex and are changed by taking on many affixes reflecting focus/trigger, aspect and mood. Below is a chart of the main verbal affixes, which consist of a variety of prefixes, suffixes, infixes, and circumfixes.

Conventions used in the chart:
* &quot;CV~&quot; stands for reduplication of the first syllable of a root word; that is, the first consonant (if any) and the first vowel of the word.
* &quot;N&quot; stands for a nasal consonant, which are &quot;m&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, or &quot;ng&quot;. 
** &quot;m&quot; is used when the prefixed word starts with the consonants &quot;b&quot; or &quot;p&quot;
** &quot;n&quot; is used before the consonants &quot;d&quot;, &quot;t&quot;, and &quot;l&quot;
** in all other cases, &quot;ng&quot; /ŋ/ is used
* &quot;∅&quot; means that the verb root is used, therefore no affixes are added.
* Punctuation marks indicate the type of affix a particular bound morpheme is:
** hyphens mark prefixes if placed after the morpheme (&quot;e.g., mag-&quot;), or suffixes if placed before it (&quot;e.g., -han&quot;)
** &#x27; marks infixes, which is typically placed before the first vowel of the word, and after the first consonant if there is any. Thus, the word &quot;&quot;sumulat&quot; &quot;(sulat)&quot; is composed of the root word &quot;sulat&quot; and the infix &#x27;. 
** &quot;~&quot; is used to separate the reduplicated morpheme (CV), from the root word, such that &quot;susulat&quot; is written as &quot;(su~sulat)&quot; and &quot;sumusulat&quot; as &quot;(su~sulat)&quot;.

With object-focus verbs in the completed and progressive aspects, the infix &quot;-in-&quot; frequently becomes the prefix &quot;ni-&quot; if the root word begins with , , , or ; e.g., &quot;linalapitan&quot; or &quot;nilalapitan&quot; and &quot;inilagáy&quot; or &quot;ilinagáy&quot;.

When suffixing &quot;-in&quot; and &quot;-an&quot; to a word that ends in a vowel, an epenthetic &quot;h&quot; is inserted. This helps to distinguish them from words that have a glottal stop, which is usually not written except when diacritical marks are applied, such that &quot;basa&quot; (&quot;to read&quot;) becomes &quot;basahin&quot; while &quot;basa&quot; (&quot;to be wet&quot;, otherwise spelt as &quot;basâ&quot;) becomes &quot;basain&quot;&quot; pronounced with a glottal stop.

The imperative affixes are not often used in Manila, but they do exist in other Tagalog speaking provinces.

=== Archaic Forms ===
In old Tagalog, the complete and progressive aspects of actor trigger I was marked with the affix &quot;-&quot;ungm&quot;-&quot; or &quot;-&quot;ingm&quot;-&#x27;, while &quot;-um-&quot; was used solely as the infinitive form. The rule is that when a verb has an &quot;i&quot; in its initial syllable, the infix used is &quot;-&quot;ingm&quot;-&quot; like &quot;&quot;tingmingin&quot; (&quot;looked&quot;, complete aspect) and &quot;tingmitingin&quot;&quot; (&quot;is looking&quot;, progressive aspect), otherwise &quot;-&quot;ungm&quot;-&quot; is used. This is a case called vowel harmony. 
Another archaic feature is when a verb starts in a &quot;&quot;b&quot; or &quot;p&quot;, which becomes an &quot;n&quot; for the complete and progressive aspects, and &quot;m&quot; for contemplative and infinitive. The word &quot;pasok&quot; (&quot;to enter&quot;) therefore becomes &quot;nasok&quot; (complete), &quot;nanasok&quot; (progressive), &quot;mamasok&quot; (contemplative), and &quot;masok&quot; (infinitive).
Though these have been lost in the Manila dialect, they are preserved in some Tagalog dialects. The allophones &quot;d&quot; and &quot;r&quot;&quot; are still somewhat preserved when it comes to verbs like &quot;dating (to arrive)&quot; but it is sometimes ignored.

===Trigger===
The central feature of verbs in Tagalog and other Philippine languages is the &quot;trigger system&quot;, often called voice or focus. In this system, the thematic relation (agent, patient, or other oblique relationslocation, direction, etc.) of the noun marked by the direct-case particle is encoded in the verb.

==== Actor trigger forms ====
Also known as the agent trigger, agent focus, actor focus, or by the abbreviations AT or AF. This verb form triggers a reading of the direct noun (marked by &quot;&quot;ang&quot;) as the agent of the clause. The main affixes/forms under this trigger are &quot;-um-&quot;, &quot;mag-&quot;, &quot;ma-&quot;, and &quot;mang-&quot;; while their derivatives (e.g., &quot;maka-&quot;, &quot;ma- -an&quot;, &quot;magsi-&quot;, etc.) may also function as actor focus. 

Some verb roots only take one of the main affixes to form the actor trigger of that verb, such as &quot;tingin&quot; (to look) which only uses the &quot;-um-&quot; conjugation as its actor trigger form. Other root words may take two or more, such as &quot;sulat&quot; (to write) which could take &quot;mag-&quot; and &quot;-um-&quot; conjugations. In such instances, the different verb forms may have the same exact meaning, or they may have some slight nuances. In the case of &quot;sulat&quot;, &quot;magsulat&quot; is closer to the meaning of physically writing a letter, while &quot;sumulat&quot; is closer to the meaning of sending a letter out. &quot;sayaw&quot; (to dance), on the other hand, has &quot;sumayaw&quot; and &quot;magsayaw&quot; which mean the same thing. Furthermore, there are a few root verbs that derive opposite meanings through these affixes, such as in the case of &quot;bili&quot; (to buy), where &quot;bumili&quot; means to buy and &quot;magbili&quot; is to sell.

The difference between these four actor trigger forms are complicated and there seems to be no consistent rule dictating when one form should be used over another. That said, memorizing what affixes a verb root uses and its corresponding meaning is essential in learning Tagalog.

* &quot;ma-&quot; is only used with a few roots which are semantically intransitive, for example, &quot;matulog&quot; (to sleep) and &quot;maligo&quot; (to bathe). &quot;Ma-&quot; is not to be confused with &quot;ma-&quot;, a patient-trigger prefix verb form.

==== Object trigger forms ====
Otherwise known as the patient trigger, patient focus, object focus, or by its initials OT, OF, PT, or PF. This verb form triggers a reading of the direct noun (marked by &quot;ang&quot;&quot;) as the patient of the clause. There are three main affixes/forms used in this trigger, &quot;-in-&quot;, &quot;i-&quot;, and &quot;-an&quot;:
* &quot;-in&quot; is the most commonly used patient trigger form. It is generally used with:
** actions that involve movement towards the agent: &quot;kainin&quot; (to eat something), &quot;bilhín&quot; (to buy something).
** actions that involve permanent change: &quot;basagin&quot; (to crack something), &quot;patayín&quot; (to kill something).
** actions that involve thought: &quot;isipin&quot; (to think of something), &quot;alalahanin&quot; (to remember something).
* &quot;i-&quot; is also a benefactive trigger, but when used as an object trigger, it denotes actions which involve something that is moved away from an agent: &quot;ibigáy&quot; (to give something), &quot;ilagáy&quot; (to put something), &quot;itaním&quot; (to plant something).
* &quot;-an&quot; can also serve as a locative or benefactive trigger, but as an object trigger, it denotes actions involving a surface change (doing unto something): &quot;hugasan&quot; (to rinse something), &quot;walisán&quot; (to sweep something off), &quot;sulatan&quot; (to write on a surface).

Affixes can also be used in nouns or adjectives: &quot;baligtaran&quot; (from &quot;baligtád&quot;, to reverse) (reversible), &quot;katamaran&quot; (from &quot;tamád&quot;, lazy) (laziness), &quot;kasabihán&quot; (from &quot;sabi&quot;, to say) (proverb), &quot;kasagutan&quot; (from &quot;sagót&quot;, answer), &quot;bayarín&quot; (from &quot;bayad&quot;, to pay) (payment), &quot;bukirín&quot; (from &quot;bukid&quot;, farm), &quot;lupaín&quot; (from &quot;lupa&quot;, land), &quot;pagkakaroón&quot; (from &quot;doón/roón&quot;, there) (having/appearance), and &quot;pagdárasál&quot; (from &quot;dasál&quot;, prayer). Verbs with affixes (mostly suffixes) are also used as nouns, which are differentiated by stress position. Examples are &quot;panoórin&quot; (to watch or view) and &quot;panoorín&quot; (materials to be watched or viewed), &quot;hangarín&quot; (to wish) and &quot;hangárin&quot; (goal/objective), &quot;arálin&quot; (to study) and &quot;aralín&quot; (studies), and &quot;bayáran&quot; (to pay) and &quot;bayarán&quot; (someone or something for hire).

==== List of triggers and examples ====
The actor trigger marks the direct noun as the agent (doer) of the action:
*&quot;Bumilí ng saging ang lalaki sa tindahan para sa unggóy.&quot;
:&quot;The man bought a banana at the store for the monkey.&quot;

The object trigger marks the direct noun as the patient (receiver) of the action:
*&quot;Binilí ng lalaki ang saging sa tindahan para sa unggóy.&quot;
:&quot;The man bought the banana at the store for the monkey.&quot;

The locative trigger marks the direct noun as the location or direction of an action or the area affected by the action.
:&quot;The man bought a banana at/from the store.&quot;
*&quot;Binilhán ng lalaki ng saging ang tindahan.&quot; (&quot;formal/dated form&quot;)
*&quot;Pinagbilhán ng lalaki ng saging ang tindahan.&quot; (&quot;colloquial form&quot;)

The benefactive trigger marks the direct noun as the person or thing that benefits from the action; i.e., the beneficiary of an action.
:&quot;The man bought a banana for the monkey&quot;.
*&quot;Ibinilí ng lalaki ng saging ang unggóy.&quot; (&quot;formal/dated form&quot;)
*&quot;Binilhán ng lalaki ng saging ang unggóy.&quot; (&quot;colloquial form&quot;)

The instrumental trigger marks the direct noun as the means by which the action is performed.
*&quot;Ipinambilí ng lalaki ng saging ang pera&quot; &quot;ng asawa niyá.&quot;
:&quot;The man bought a banana with his spouse&#x27;s money.&quot;

The reason trigger marks the direct noun as the cause or reason why an action is performed. It is mostly used exclusively with verbs of emotion.
* &quot;Ikinagulat ng lalaki&quot; &quot;ang pagdatíng ng unggóy&quot;.
:&quot;The man got surprised because of the monkey&#x27;s arrival.&quot;

===Aspect===
The aspect of the verb indicates the progressiveness of the verb. It specifies whether the action happened, is happening, or will happen. Tagalog verbs are conjugated for time using aspect rather than tense, which can be easily expressed with phrases and time prepositions.

==== Infinitive &quot;(Pawatas)&quot; ====
This serves as the base form of the verb, and is not marked by aspect. It is typically used in modal and subjunctive constructions. It is also used in standard Tagalog as the basis for the imperative form of the verb, by adding a second-person pronoun, such as &quot;ka/mo&quot; (you) and &quot;kayó/ninyó&quot; (you all), directly after it.

This is formed by affixing a verbal trigger suffix to the root word.
Examples of infinitive use in modal sentences:
==== Perfective &quot;(Naganáp)&quot; ====
Also known as the &quot;complete&quot; or &quot;completed aspect&quot;. This implies that the action was done in the past, prior to the time of speaking or some other specified time. This aspect is characterized by:
* the use of the infix &quot;-in-&quot; in all triggers except the actor trigger
* the alteration of initial &quot;m&quot; to &quot;n&quot; in &quot;mag-&quot;, &quot;ma-&quot;, and &quot;mang-&quot; (actor triggers II, III, and IV)
* no change with &quot;-um-&quot; (actor trigger I)

In the complete aspect of the object trigger &quot;-in&quot;, that suffix &quot;-in&quot; (or &quot;-hin&quot;) is removed. This is in contrast with other triggers where the trigger affix remains.

On its own, the perfective verb may not necessarily imply that the action is completed.
Adding the particle &quot;na&quot; directly after it strengthens the notion that it is in fact completed. Compare this with the difference between English simple past and past perfect tenses.

==== Imperfective &quot;(Nagaganap)&quot; ====
Also known as the &quot;progressive&quot; or &quot;uncompleted aspect&quot;. This implies that the action has started, is ongoing, and not yet completed. It is also used with habitual actions, or actions that signify general facts. This aspect is characterized by the reduplication of the first syllable of the root word, followed by application of the same morphological rules as seen with the complete aspect. If the base form of the verb has its stress on the last syllable, a secondary stress usually falls on the reduplicated syllable.

==== Contemplative &quot;(Magaganap)&quot; ====
This implies that the action has not yet started but anticipated. This aspect is characterized solely by the reduplication of the first syllable of the root word.

In the contemplative aspect of the actor trigger &quot;-um-&quot;, that infix &quot;-um-&quot; is removed.

==== Recently Complete &quot;(Katatapos)&quot; ====
This implies that the action has just been completed before the time of speaking or before a specified time. This aspect is unique in that it does not use the direct case marker &quot;ang&quot; to mark a focused argument. All nouns bound to a verb in this aspect are only marked by the indirect and oblique markers. 

It is often taught that to form this aspect, the first syllable of the word should be reduplicated followed by adding the prefix &quot;ka-&quot;. In colloquial speech however, the prefix &quot;kaka-&quot; is used instead without any reduplication. A verb in this aspect is always followed by the particle &quot;lang&quot;.

===Mood===
Tagalog verbs also have affixes expressing grammatical mood; some examples are indicative, potential, social, causative and distributed.

Indicative
Nagdalá siyá ng liham.
&quot;&quot;(S)he brought a letter.&quot;

Bumilí kamí ng bigás sa palengke.
&quot;We bought rice in the market.&quot;

Kumain akó.
&quot;I ate.&quot;

Hindî siyá nagsásalitâ ng Tagalog.
&quot;(S)he does not speak Tagalog.&quot;

Causative &quot;magpa-&quot; 
Nagpadalá siyá ng liham sa kaniyáng iná.
&quot;He sent (literally: caused to be brought) a letter to his mother.&quot;

Distributive &quot;maN-&quot;
Namilí kamí sa palengke.
&quot;We went shopping in the market.&quot;

Social &quot;maki-&quot;
Nakikain akó sa mga kaibigan ko.
&quot;I ate with my friends.&quot;

Potential &quot;maka-/makapag-&quot;
Hindî siyá nakapagsásalitâ ng Tagalog.
&quot;(S)he was not able to speak Tagalog.&quot;

==Nouns==
While Tagalog nouns are not inflected, they are usually preceded by case-marking particles. These follow an Austronesian alignment, also known as a &quot;trigger&quot; system, which is a distinct feature of Austronesian languages. There are three basic cases: &quot;direct&quot; (&quot;ang/si&quot;); &quot;indirect&quot; (&quot;ng/ni&quot;); and &quot;oblique&quot; (&quot;sa/kay&quot;).

The direct case marks the noun which has a special relation to the verb in the clause. Here, it is the verb&#x27;s &quot;trigger&quot; that determines what semantic role (agent, patient, etc.) the noun is in. The indirect case marks the agent or patient, or both, that isn&#x27;t marked with the direct case in the clause. The oblique case marks the location, benificiary, instrument, and any other oblique argument that isn&#x27;t marked with the direct case.

In clauses using the actor trigger, the direct case would mark the agent of the verb (corresponding to the subject in the English active voice), the indirect would mark the patient (direct object), while any other argument would be marked by the oblique case. In the object trigger, the reverse occurs, wherein the direct would mark the patient and the indirect marking the agent. When other verb triggers are used (i.e, locative, beneficiary, instrumental, causal triggers), both agent and patient would be marked by the indirect case, the focused oblique argument marked with the direct case, and any other argument by the oblique case.

One of the functions of trigger in Tagalog is to code definiteness, analogous to the use of definite and indefinite articles (i.e., the &amp; a) in English. That said, an argument marked with the direct case is always definite. Whereas, when a patient argument is marked with the &quot;in&quot;direct case, it is generally indefinite, but an agent argument marked with the same &quot;in&quot;direct case would be understood as definite. To make it indefinite, the numeral &quot;isá&quot; (one) is used.

The indirect particle is also used as a genitive marker. It is for this reason that Tagalog lean more towards a VOS word order, as an indirect (ng/ni) argument directly following a direct (ang/si) argument might be misinterpreted as a possessive construction. For instance with the sentence above, &quot;kumain ang pusà ng isdâ&quot; may be read as &quot;the cat of the fish ate&quot;&quot;.

The oblique particle and the locative derived from it are similar to prepositions in English, marking things such as location and direction.

The case particles fall into two classes: one used with names of people (proper) and one for everything else (common).

The common indirect marker is spelled &quot;ng&quot; and pronounced . &quot;Mgá&quot;, pronounced , marks the common plural.

Tagalog has associative plural in addition to additive plural.

Note that in Tagalog, even proper nouns require a case marker.



==Pronouns==
Like nouns, personal pronouns are categorized by case. As above, the indirect forms also function as the genitive.

Pronoun sequences are (), , , and .

Examples:

&quot;I wrote.&quot;
&quot;He/She/They wrote me a letter.&quot;

&quot;I will give this to him/her/them.&quot;

Genitive pronouns follow the word they modify. Oblique pronouns can take the place of the genitive pronoun but they precede the word they modify.

&quot;My house.&quot;

The inclusive dual pronoun has largely disappeared from the Manila Dialect. It survives in other Tagalog dialects, particularly those spoken in the rural areas. However is used to replace the pronoun sequence &quot;[verb] &quot;, (I [verb] you).

The 1st–2nd dual pronoun &quot;&quot; referring to &quot;you and I&quot; is traditionally used as follows:

 (Manila Dialect: )
&quot;You and I are friends.&quot; (Manila Dialect: “We are friends.&quot;)

Examples:

(We are lovers.)

 (Our house is fixed.)

 (The destinations are beautiful at ours.)

As previously mentioned, the pronoun sequence &quot;[verb] &quot;, (I [verb] you) may be replaced by .
&quot;I love you.&quot;
&quot;I will give you money.&quot;
&quot;I saw you at the store yesterday.&quot;
&quot;You are my friend.&quot;

The inclusive pronoun refers to the first and second persons. It may also refer to a third person(s).

The exclusive pronoun refers to the first and third persons but excludes the second.
&quot;We (you and me) have no rice.&quot;
&quot;We (someone else and me, but not you) have no rice.&quot;

The second person singular has two forms. is the non-enclitic form while is the enclitic which never begins a sentence. The plural form is also used politely in the singular, similar to French .

Native nouns are genderless, hence means &quot;he,&quot; &quot;she,&quot; or &quot;they&quot; (singular).

===Polite or formal usage===
Tagalog, like many languages, marks the T–V distinction: when addressing a single person in polite/formal/respectful settings, pronouns from either the 2nd person plural or the 3rd person plural group are used instead of the singular 2nd person pronoun. They can be used with, or in lieu of, the iterations without losing any degree of politeness, formality, or respect:

* or (&quot;you&quot; sgl.) becomes (&quot;you&quot; pl.) or (&quot;they&quot;)
* (post-substantive &quot;your&quot;) becomes or (more polite), (post-substantive &quot;your&quot; pl.) or (post-substantive &quot;their&quot;)
* (&quot;yours&quot; sgl. or pre-substantive &quot;your&quot; sgl.) becomes (&quot;yours&quot; pl. or pre-substantive &quot;your&quot; pl.) or (&quot;theirs&quot; or pre-substantive &quot;their&quot;)

Example:
English: &quot;What&#x27;s your name?&quot;
Casual: 
Respectful: or ?

Using such pluralized pronouns is quite sufficient for expressing politeness, formality or respect, particularly when an affirmative (or negative) iteration isn&#x27;t necessary.

Additionally, the formal second-person pronouns (), , , and , third-person forms and , and their oblique forms , , and are customarily and reverentially capitalized, particularly in most religion-related digital and printed media and their references. Purists who frame this capitalization as nonstandard and inconsistent do not apply it when typing or writing.

===Demonstrative pronouns===
Tagalog&#x27;s demonstrative pronouns are as follows.
Notes:

- Although &quot;dine&quot; and &quot;dito&quot; both mean &quot;here&quot;, its difference is the first one pertains to the speaker only while the second one includes the listener. Lost in Standard Filipino/Tagalog (Manila dialect: dito) but still survive in province dialects like Batangas. The same goes for direct, indirect, oblique, locative, existential, and manner (nearest to speaker).

- &quot;Yaón&quot; is an old-fashioned word which means &quot;that&quot;.The 
modern word is &quot;iyón&quot;.

- The oblique are verbs and locative are pseudo-verbs; for instance, dumito, dumidito, and didito for oblique; and narito, naririto, and nandito for oblique. However, some are archaic and some are old-fashioned.

- Words like &quot;pariné, paritó, pariyón, and paroón&quot; are combined with pa+(oblique word). These were old-fashioned and/or archaic but still survive in dialects.

- The contractions are: &#x27;re, &#x27;to, &#x27;yan, &#x27;yun, n&#x27;yan, gan&#x27;to, gan&#x27;yan, gan&#x27;re, gano&#x27;n (gayon)

*Many Tagalog speakers may use &quot;itó&quot; in place of &quot;iré/aré&quot;.

Examples:
Anó itó?
&quot;What&#x27;s this?&quot;

Sino ang lalaking iyón?
&quot;Who is that man?&quot;

Gáling kay Pedro ang liham na itó.
&quot;This letter is from Pedro.&quot;
Nandito akó.
&quot;I am here.&quot;

Kakain silá roón.
&quot;They will eat there.&quot;

Saán ka man naróroon.
&quot;Wherever you are.&quot;
Kumain niyán ang batà.
&quot;The child ate some of that.&quot;

Ayón palá ang salamín mo!
&quot;So that&#x27;s where your glasses are!&quot;

Heto isáng regalo para sa iyó.
&quot;Here&#x27;s a gift for you.&quot;
== Adjectives ==
Just like English adjectives, Tagalog adjectives modify a noun or a pronoun.

=== Forms ===

==== Simple (&quot;Payák&quot;) ====
These consist of only the root word.

Examples: hinóg (&quot;ripe&quot;), sabog (&quot;exploded&quot;), ganda (&quot;beautiful&quot;)

==== Affixed (&quot;Maylapì&quot;) ====
These consist of the root word and one or more affixes.

Examples: tinanóng (&quot;questioned&quot;), kumakain (&quot;eating&quot;), nagmámahál (&quot;loving&quot;)

==== Repeating (&quot;Inuulit&quot;) ====
These are formed by the repetition of the whole or part of the root word.

Examples: puláng-pulá (&quot;really red&quot;), putíng-putî (&quot;really white&quot;), araw-araw (&quot;every day&quot;), gabí-gabí (&quot;every night&quot;)

==== Compound (&quot;Tambalan&quot;) ====
These are compound words.

Examples: ngiting-aso (&quot;literally: &quot;dog smile&quot;, meaning: &quot;big smile&quot;&quot;), balát-sibuyas (&quot;literally: &quot;onion-skinned&quot;, meaning: &quot;crybaby&quot;&quot;)

=== Types ===

==== Descriptive (&quot;Panlarawan&quot;) ====
This states the size, color, form, smell, sound, texture, taste, and shape.

Examples: muntî (&quot;little&quot;), biluhabà (&quot;oval&quot;), matamis (&quot;sweet&quot;), malubhâ (&quot;serious&quot;)

==== Proper (&quot;Pantangì&quot;) ====
This states a specific noun. This consists of a common noun and a proper noun. The proper noun (that starts with a capital letter) is modifying the type of common noun.

Examples: wikang Ingles (&quot;English language&quot;), kulturang Espanyol (&quot;Spanish culture&quot;), pagkaing Iloko (&quot;Ilokano food&quot;)

==== &quot;Pamilang&quot; ====
This states the number, how many, or a position in order. This has multiple types.

* Sequence (&quot;Panunurán&quot;) – This states the position in an order. Examples: ikatló (&quot;third&quot;), una (&quot;first&quot;), pangalawá (&quot;second&quot;)
* Quantitative (&quot;Patakarán&quot;) – This states the actual number. Examples: isa (&quot;one&quot;), apat (&quot;four&quot;), limang libo (&quot;five thousand&quot;)
* Fraction (&quot;Pamahagì&quot;) – This states a part of a whole. Examples: kalahatì (&quot;half&quot;), limáng-kawaló (&quot;five-eights&quot;), sangkapat (&quot;fourth&quot;)
* Monetary (&quot;Pahalagá&quot;) – This states a price (equivalent to money) of a thing or any bought item. Examples: piso (&quot;one peso&quot;), limampung sentimo (&quot;fifty centavos&quot;), sandaang piso (&quot;one hundred pesos&quot;)
* Collective (&quot;Palansák&quot;) – This states a group of people or things. This identifies the number that forms that group. Examples: dalawahan (&quot;by two&quot;), sampú-sampû (&quot;by ten&quot;), animan (&quot;by six&quot;)
* Patakdâ – This states the exact and actual number. This cannot be added or subtracted. Examples: iisa (&quot;only one&quot;), dadalawa (&quot;only two&quot;), lilima (&quot;only five&quot;)

=== Degrees of Comparison ===
Just like English adjectives, Tagalog adjectives have 3 degrees of comparison.

==== Positive (&quot;Lantáy&quot;) ====
This only compares one noun/pronoun.

Example: maliít (&quot;small&quot;), kupas (&quot;peeled&quot;), matabâ (&quot;fat&quot;)

==== Comparative (&quot;Pahambíng&quot;) ====
This is used when 2 nouns/pronouns are being compared. This has multiple types.

* Similar (&quot;Magkatulad&quot;) – This is the comparison when the traits compared are fair. Usually, the prefixes ga-, sing-/kasíng-, and magsing-/magkasíng- are used.
* Dissimilar (&quot;Di-magkatulad&quot;) – This is the comparison if it shows the idea of disallowance, rejection or opposition.
** Palamáng – the thing that is being compared has a positive trait. The words &quot;higít&quot;, &quot;lalo&quot;, &quot;mas&quot;, &quot;di-hamak&quot; and others are used.
** Pasahol – the thing that is being compared has a negative trait. The words &quot;di-gaano&quot;, &quot;di-gasino&quot;, &quot;di-masyado&quot; and others are used.

==== Superlative (&quot;Pasukdól&quot;) ====
This is the highest degree of comparison. This can be positive or negative. The prefix &quot;pinaká&quot; and the words &quot;sobra&quot;, &quot;ubod&quot;, &quot;tunay&quot;, &quot;talaga&quot;, &quot;saksakan&quot;, and &quot;hari ng ___&quot; are used, as well as the repetition of the adjective.
=== Degrees of Description ===
These degrees have no comparison.

==== &quot;Lantáy&quot; ====
This is when the simple/plain form of the adjective is being used for description.

Examples: matalino (&quot;smart&quot;), palatawá (&quot;risible&quot;)

==== &quot;Katamtaman&quot; ====
This is when the adjective is accompanied by the words &quot;medyo&quot;, &quot;nang kauntî&quot;, &quot;nang bahagyâ&quot; or the repetition of the root word or the first two syllables of the root word.

Examples: medyo matabâ (&quot;somewhat fat&quot;), malakás nang bahagyâ (&quot;slightly strong&quot;), malakás-lakás (&quot;somewhat strong&quot;), matabáng nang kauntî (&quot;a little bit insipid&quot;)

==== &quot;Masidhî&quot; ====
This is when the adjective is accompanied by the words &quot;napaka&quot;, &quot;ubod ng&quot;, &quot;saksakan ng&quot;, &quot;talagáng&quot;, &quot;sobrang&quot;, &quot;masyadong&quot; or the repetition of the whole adjective. The description in this degree is intense.

Examples: napakalakas (&quot;so strong&quot;), ubod ng baít (&quot;really kind&quot;), talagáng mabangó (&quot;truly fragrant&quot;), sobrang makinis (&quot;oversmooth&quot;)

=== Number ===
There are rules that are followed when forming adjectives that use the prefix &quot;ma-&quot;.

==== Singular (&quot;Isahan&quot;) ====
When the adjective is describing only one noun/pronoun, &quot;ma-&quot; and the root word is used.

Examples: &quot;ma&quot;sayá (&quot;happy&quot;), &quot;ma&quot;lungkót (&quot;sad&quot;)

==== Plural (&quot;Maramihan&quot;) ====
When the adjective is describing two or more noun/pronoun, &quot;ma-&quot; is used and the first syllable or first two letters of the root word is repeated.

Examples: &quot;ma&quot;liliít (&quot;small&quot;), &quot;ma&quot;gagandá (&quot;beautiful&quot;)

The word &quot;mgá&quot; is not needed if the noun/pronoun is right next to the adjective.

Example: Ang &quot;ma&quot;gagandáng damít ay kasya kiná Erica at Bel. (&quot;The beautiful clothes can fit to Erica and Bel.&quot;)

== Ligature ==
The ligature (&quot;pang-angkóp&quot;) connects, or links, modifiers (like adjectives and adverbs) to the words that they are modifying. It has two allomorphs:

;&quot;na&quot;
This is used if the preceding word ends with a consonant other than &quot;n&quot;. It is not combined with the preceding word but separated, appearing between the modifier and the word it modifies.

Example: (&quot;loving person&quot;)

;&quot;-ng&quot;
This suffixed allomorph is used if the preceding word ends with a vowel or &quot;n&quot;; in the latter case, the final &quot;n&quot; is lost and replaced by the suffix:

Examples: (&quot;good creation of God&quot;); () (&quot;ideal citizen&quot;)

==Conjunctions==

Tagalog uses numerous conjunctions, and may belong to one of these possible functions:

# separate non-contrasting ideas (e.g. &quot;and&quot;)
# separate contrasting ideas (e.g. &quot;but&quot;)
# give explanations (e.g. &quot;if&quot;)
# provide circumstances (e.g. &quot;when&quot;)
# indicate similarities (e.g. &quot;where&quot;)
# provide reasons (e.g. &quot;because&quot;)
# indicate endings (e.g. &quot;[in order] to&quot;)

==Modifiers==
Modifiers alter, qualify, clarify, or limit other elements in a sentence structure. They are optional grammatical elements but they change the meaning of the element they are modifying in particular ways. Examples of modifiers are adjectives (modifies nouns), adjectival clauses, adverbs (modifies verbs), and adverbial clauses. Nouns can also modify other nouns. In Tagalog, word categories are fluid: A word can sometimes be an adverb or an adjective depending on the word it modifies. If the word being modified is a noun, then the modifier is an adjective, if the word being modified is a verb, then it is an adverb. For example, the word &quot;&#x27;mabilís&#x27;&quot; means &#x27;fast&#x27; in English. The Tagalog word &quot;&#x27;mabilís&#x27;&quot; can be used to describe nouns like &quot;&#x27;kuneho&#x27;&quot; (&#x27;rabbit&#x27;) in &quot;&#x27;kunehong mabilís&#x27;&quot; (&#x27;quick rabbit&#x27;). In that phrase, &quot;&#x27;mabilís&quot;&#x27; was used as an adjective. The same word can be used to describe verbs, one can say &#x27;tumakbóng mabilís&#x27; which means &#x27;quickly ran&#x27;. In that phrase, &#x27;mabilis&#x27; was used as an adverb. The Tagalog word for &#x27;rabbit&#x27; is &#x27;kuneho&#x27; and &#x27;ran&#x27; is &#x27;tumakbó&#x27; but they showed up in the phrases as &#x27;kuneho-ng&#x27; and &#x27;tumakbó-ng&#x27;. Tagalog uses something called a &quot;linker&quot; that always surfaces in the context of modification. Modification only occurs when a linker is present. Tagalog has the linkers &quot;-ng&quot; and &quot;na.&quot; In the examples mentioned, the linker -&quot;ng&quot; was used because the word before the linker ends in a vowel. The second linker, &quot;na &quot;is used everywhere else (the &quot;na&quot; used in modification is not the same as the adverb &quot;na&quot; which means &#x27;now&#x27; or &#x27;already&#x27;). Seeing the enclitics &quot;-ng &quot;and &quot;na&quot; are good indications that there is modification in the clause. These linkers can appear before or after the modifier.

The following table summarizes the distribution of the linker: 
===Sequence of modifiers in a noun phrase===
The following tables show a possible word order of a noun phrase containing a modifier. Since word order is flexible in Tagalog, there are other possible ways in which one could say these phrases. To read more on Tagalog word order, head to the Word Order section.
==Enclitic particles==
Tagalog has enclitic particles that have important information conveying different nuances in meaning. Below is a list of Tagalog&#x27;s enclitic particles.

# and 
#*: now, already
#*: still, else, in addition, yet
#, : even, even if, even though
#: although
#: indeed; used to affirm or to emphasise. Also softens imperatives.
# (after a vowel: ): too, also
# (contracted as ): limiting particle; only or just
# (after a vowel: ): a reporting particle that indicates the preceding information as secondhand; they say, he said, reportedly, supposedly, etc.
# (less respectful form: ): marker indicating politeness.
#: used to end yes-and-no questions and optionally in other types of questions, similar to Japanese and Chinese &quot;ma&quot; (嗎), but not entirely.
#: for now, for a minute, and yet (when answering in the negative).
#: used in making contrasts; softens requests; emphasis
#: expresses cause; because
#: expresses wonder; I wonder; perhaps (we should do something); also optionally used in yes-and-no questions and other forms of questions
#: expresses that the speaker has realized or suddenly remembered something; realization particle; apparently
# (contracted as/informal: ): expresses uncertainty; probably, perhaps, seems
#: used in cause and effect; as a result
#: expresses hope, unrealized condition (with the verb in completed aspect), used in conditional sentences.

The order listed above is the order in which the particles follow if they are used in conjunction with each other. A more concise list of the orders of monosyllabic particles from Rubino (2002) is given below.
#
# ~ 
#

The particles and cannot be used in conjunction with each other as well as and .
::&quot;Oh yes, your grandmother has apparently arrived.&quot;
::&quot;Do change it as well.&quot;

Note for &quot;/ and /&quot;: If the preceding letter is a consonant except y and w, the letter d is used in any word, vice versa for r e.g., , instead of 

Although in everyday speech, this rule is often ignored.
::&quot;Perhaps his brother still hasn’t a wife.&quot;
::&quot;I wonder, is the only thing that they&#x27;ll be giving us?&quot;
::&quot;Have you already studied the Spanish language?&quot;
::&quot;He&#x27;s still young, is why.&quot;
::&quot;Please, do write your name here first.&quot;

The words and , which mean “he said”/“she said”/“they said”, are sometimes joined to the real translations of “he said”/”she said”, which is , and “they said”, which is . They are also joined to the Tagalog of “you said”, which is . But this time, both and mean “supposedly/reportedly”.
::&quot;He/she supposedly said.&quot;
::&quot;They supposedly said.&quot;
::&quot;You supposedly said.&quot;

Although the word is a native Tagalog word for “because” and not slang, it is still not used in formal writing. The Tagalog word for this is or . Thus, the formal form of is or . This is sometimes shortened to or , so is also written as or . In both formal and everyday writing and speech, (the oblique form of ; thus, its exact translation is “because of”) is also synonymous to (), so the substitute of for is . Most of the time in speech and writing (mostly every day and sometimes formal), as the Tagalog of “because” is reduced to , so is spoken simply as .

==Word order==

Tagalog has a flexible word order compared to English. While the verb always remains in the initial position, the order of noun phrase complements that follows is flexible. An example provided by Schacter and Otanes can be seen in (1).

The flexibility of Tagalog word order can be seen in (2). There are six different ways of saying &#x27;The man gave the woman a book.&#x27; in Tagalog. The following five sentences, along with the sentence from (1), include the same grammatical components and are all grammatical and identical in meaning but have different orders.

The principles in (3) help to determine the ordering of possible noun phrase complements. In a basic clause where the patient takes the nominative case, principles (i) and (ii) requires the actor to precede the patient. In example (4a), the patient, &quot;&#x27;liham&quot;&#x27; (letter) takes the nominative case and satisfies principles (i) and (ii). The example in (4b) shows that the opposite ordering of the agent and patient does not result in an ungrammatical sentence but rather an unnatural one in Tagalog.



In example (5), the verb, &quot;&#x27;binihag&#x27;,&quot; (captivated) is marked for active voice and results in the actor (&#x27;&quot;Kuya Louis&#x27;&quot;) to take the nominative case. Example (5) doesn&#x27;t satisfy principles (i) and (ii). That is, principle (i) requires the Actor (&#x27;&quot;Kuya Louis&#x27;&quot;) to precede all other arguments. However, since the Actor also takes the nominative case, principle (ii) requires the phrase &#x27;&quot;Kuya Louis&quot;&#x27; to come last. The preferred order of agent and patient in Tagalog active clauses is still being debated. Therefore, we can assume that there are two &quot;unmarked&quot; word orders: VSO or VOS.

A change in word order and trigger generally corresponds to a change in definiteness (&quot;the&quot; vs &quot;a&quot;) in English. Example (6) shows a change in word order, triggered by the indirect, &quot;ng.&quot; Example (7) shows a change in word order, triggered by the direct, &quot;ang.&quot;

&lt;section begin=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;
DIR:direct
INDIR:indirect
&lt;section end=&quot;list-of-glossing-abbreviations&quot;/&gt;


Word order may be inverted (referred to in Tagalog grammar as &quot;Kabalikáng Anyô&quot;) by way of the inversion marker &#x27;&quot;ay&quot; &#x27; (&quot; ’y&quot; after vowels in informal speech, not usually used in writing). Contrary to popular belief, this is not the copula &#x27;to be&#x27; as &#x27;&quot;ay&#x27;&quot; does not behave as an existential marker in an SVO structure and an inverted form VSO does not require &quot;&#x27;ay&quot;&#x27; since the existentiality is denoted by case marking. A slight, but optional, pause in speech or a comma in writing may replace the inversion marker. This construction is often viewed by native speakers as formal or literary.

In this construction (ay-inversion), the &quot;&#x27;ay&quot;&#x27; appears between the fronted constituent and the remainder of the clause. The fronted constituent in the construction includes locations and adverbs. Example (8)- (11) shows the inverted form of the sentences in the previous examples above.



In (8) and (11), the fronted constituent is the subject. On the other hand, in (9), the fronted constituent is the object. Another example of a fronted constituent in Tagalog is, &quot;wh-phrases&quot;. Wh-phrases include interrogative questions that begin with: who, what, where, when, why, and how. In Tagalog, wh-phrases occur to the left of the clause. For example, in the sentence, &#x27;Who are you?&#x27;&quot;, &quot;which translates to, &#x27;&quot;Sino ka?&quot;&#x27; occurs to the left of the clause. The syntactic tree of this sentence is found in (12a). As we can see in (12a), the complementizer position is null. However, in the case where an overt complementizer is present, Sabbagh (2014) proposes that the wh-phrase lowers from Spec, CP, and adjoins to TP when C is overt (12b). The operation in (12b) is known as, WhP lowering.


This operation of lowering can also be applied in sentences to account for the verb-initial word order in Tagalog. The subject-lowering analysis states that &quot;the subject lowers from Spec, TP and adjoins to a projection dominated by TP.&quot;. If we use the example from (2), 
Nagbigáy ang lalaki ng libró sa babae. and applied subject lowering, we would see the syntax tree in (13a).If we lowered the subject, ang lalaki, to an intermediate position within VP, we would be able to achieve a VOS word order and still satisfy subject lowering. This can be seen in (13b).


Lowering is motivated by a prosodic constraint called, WeakStart. This constraint is largely based on the phonological hierarchy. This constraint requires the first phonological element within a phonological domain to be lower on the prosodic hierarchy than elements that follow it, within the same domain.

==Negation==
There are three negation words: &quot;hindî&quot;, &quot;walâ&quot;, and &quot;huwág&quot;.

Hindî negates verbs and equations. It is sometimes contracted to &quot;‘dî&quot;.

*&quot;Hindî akó magtatrabaho bukas.&quot;
:&quot;I will not work tomorrow.&quot;

*&quot;Hindî mayaman ang babae.&quot;
:&quot;The woman is not rich.&quot;

Walâ is the opposite of &quot;may&quot; and &quot;mayroón&quot; (&quot;there is&quot;).

*&quot;Walâ akóng pera.&quot;
*&quot;Akó ay waláng pera.&quot;
:&quot;I do not have money.&quot;

*&quot;Waláng libró sa loób ng bahay niyá.&quot;
:&quot;There are no books in his house.&quot;

Huwág is used in expressing negative commands. It can be used for the infinitive and the future aspect. It is contracted as &quot;‘wag&quot;.

*&quot;Huwág kang umiyák.&quot;
:&quot;Do not cry.&quot;

*&quot;Huwág kayóng tumakbó rito.&quot;
:&quot;Do not run here.&quot;

There are two (or more) special negative forms for common verbs:

*&quot;Gustó/Ibig/Nais ko nang kumain.&quot;
:&quot;I would like to eat now.&quot; (Positive)

*&quot;Ayaw ko pang kumain.&quot;
:&quot;I don&#x27;t want to eat yet.&quot; (Negative)

==Interrogative words==
Tagalog&#x27;s interrogative words are: &quot;alín&quot;, &quot;anó&quot;, &quot;bákit&quot;, &quot;gaáno&quot;, &quot;gaálin&quot;, &quot;makáilan&quot;, &quot;ilán&quot;, &quot;kailán&quot;, &quot;kaníno&quot;, &quot;kumustá&quot;, &quot;magkáno&quot;, &quot;nakaníno&quot;, &quot;nasaán&quot;, &quot;níno&quot;, &quot;paáno&quot;, &quot;pasaán&quot;, &quot;saán&quot;, &quot;tagasaán&quot;, and &quot;síno&quot;. With the exceptions of &quot;bakit&quot;, &quot;kamustá(maáno)&quot;, and &quot;nasaán&quot;, all of the interrogative words have optional plural forms which are formed by reduplication. They are used when the person who is asking the question anticipates a plural answer and can be called wh-phrases. The syntactic position of these types of phrases can be seen in (12a).



Gaano (from &quot;ga-&quot; + &quot;anó&quot;) means &quot;how&quot; but is used in inquiring about the quality of an adjective or an adverb. The root word of the modifier is prefixed with &quot;ga-&quot; in this construction (16a).Ilán means &quot;how many&quot; (16b). Kumustá is used to inquire how something is (are).(16c) It is frequently used as a greeting meaning &quot;How are you?&quot; It is derived from the Spanish &quot;¿cómo está?&quot;. Magkano (from &quot;mag-&quot; + &quot;gaano&quot;) means &quot;how much&quot; and is usually used in inquiring the price of something (16d). Paano (from &quot;pa-&quot; + &quot;anó&quot;) is used in asking &quot;how&quot; something is done or happened (16e).





Nino (from &quot;ni&quot; + &quot;anó&quot;) means &quot;who&quot;, &quot;whose&quot;, and &quot;whom&quot; (18a). It is the indirect and genitive form of &quot;sino&quot;. Sino (from &quot;si&quot; + &quot;anó&quot;) means &quot;who&quot; and &quot;whom&quot; and it is in the direct form (18b). Kanino (from &quot;kay&quot; + &quot;anó&quot;) means &quot;whom&quot; or &quot;whose&quot; (18c). It is the oblique form of &quot;sino&quot; (who).

<text>Service management in the manufacturing context, is integrated into supply chain management as the intersection between the actual sales and the customer point of view. The aim of high-performance service management is to optimize the service-intensive supply chains, which are usually more complex than the typical finished-goods supply chain. Most service-intensive supply chains require larger inventories and tighter integration with field service and third parties. They also must accommodate inconsistent and uncertain demand by establishing more advanced information and product flows. Moreover, all processes must be coordinated across numerous service locations with large numbers of parts and multiple levels in the supply chain.

Among typical manufacturers, post-sale services (maintenance, repair, and parts) account for less than 20% of revenue. But among the most innovative companies in service, those same activities often generate more than 50% of the profits.

ISO/IEC 20000 is the internationally acknowledged for service management.

==Benefits==
The main drivers for a company to establish or optimize its service management practices are varied:

* High service costs can be reduced, i.e. by integrating the service and products supply chain.
* Inventory levels of service parts can be reduced and therefore reduce total inventory costs.
* Customer service or parts/service quality can be optimized.
* Increasing service revenue.
* Reduce obsolescence costs of service parts through improved forecasting.
* Improve customer satisfaction levels.
* Reduce expediting costs - with optimized service parts inventory, there is no need to rush orders to customers.
* Minimize technician visits - if they have the right part in hand, they can fix the problem on the first visit.

==Components==
Generally, service management comprises six different capabilities that companies should consider for optimization:

* Service strategy and service offerings
** Service strategy definition
** Service offerings definition and positioning
** Go-to-market strategy
** Service portfolio management
* Spare parts management
** Parts supply management
** Inventory management
** Parts demand management
** Fulfillment operations and logistics
** Service parts management
* Returns, repairs, and warranties
** Warranty and claims management
** Reverse logistics
** Returns processing
** Remanufacturing
* Field service management or field force effectiveness
** Technician enablement
** Mobility
** E-learning
** Activity scheduling
** Service billing
* Customer management
** Order management and availability
** Channel and partner management
** Customer insight
** Technical documentation
* Assets, maintenance, task scheduling, event management
** Remote monitoring
** Diagnostics and testing
** Asset management/optimization
** Configuration management

<doc id="909195" wikidata="Q2894736" url="?curid=909195" title="Belle Vue (Doncaster)">
<text>Belle Vue was a football stadium in Doncaster, South Yorkshire, England, that served as the home ground of Doncaster Rovers from 1922 to 2007. The ground was affectionately known as &quot;Old Belle Vue&quot; (OBV) by fans and at its peak had a total capacity of 40,000.

==History==
The ground was opened by Charles E. Sutcliffe from the Football League on Saturday 26 August 1922. The opposition was Gainsborough Trinity. The initial capacity was for 7,000 spectators, which was extended year-on-year as finances allowed. In 1927 the main stand at Doncaster&#x27;s former ground in the suburb of Bennetthorpe was lifted and moved on rollers to Belle Vue to form the family stand, where it remained until 1985 when the Valley Parade fire in Bradford meant that the old wooden structure was condemned and was demolished.

In 1938 the capacity of Belle Vue was increased to 40,000 and it was in 1948 that the stadium recorded its highest attendance of 37,099 against Hull City, although apocryphal accounts refute this and claim that many more gained entry to the ground by climbing over walls.

==Rovers decline and 1995 fire==
In the later years of the 20th century, as the club&#x27;s fortunes began to decline and finances became tighter, the capacity of Belle Vue was cut dramatically, falling as low as 4,859 in May 1987 when mining subsidence was found underground beneath the Popular Stand terrace.

A fire in the Main Stand one night in June 1995 caused extensive damage and nine months later chairman Ken Richardson was arrested following an evening match against Fulham. He was found guilty of conspiracy to commit arson and sentenced to four years&#x27; imprisonment. The actual arsonist, Alan Kristiansen, received a one-year prison sentence; it was revealed that Kristiansen, a former SAS soldier, had been paid £10,000 by Richardson to start the fire. His accomplices both received nine-month prison sentences, suspended for two years.

==2003 renovations==
In the summer of 2003 work began to repair the Town End terrace, to replace the old seating in the Main Stand and to extend the Rossington terrace. In the summer of 2004 the Popular Stand terrace was also extended and executive boxes were built at the Town End of the stadium. New club offices, a new supporters bar and the application of tarmac to the car park completed a much-needed facelift. In a move that angered some fans Belle Vue was renamed the Earth Stadium as part of a sponsorship deal with Rotherham-based finance company Earth Finance. The capacity reached the region of 11,500.

==Keepmoat Stadium and Belle Vue closes==
A new stadium had long been mooted for Doncaster Rovers. This finally started to become a reality when planning permission was granted. Construction started on 17 October 2005 of a 15,000 all-seater community stadium complex. The new ground was named the Keepmoat Stadium.

The last game at Belle Vue was on 23 December 2006 against League One leaders, Nottingham Forest. Doncaster Rovers finished their time at the stadium with a win, with a goal from Theo Streete ensuring a 1–0 victory.

==Gas explosion and demolition==
In the early hours of 7 February 2007, local residents near the stadium described a sound &quot;like a bomb going off&quot;, later determined to be a gas explosion. The impact of the blast destroyed most of the Main Stand. Two people at the scene received hospital treatment for injuries sustained in the explosion, one of whom had to be transferred to a specialist burns unit in Nottingham, while one lane of Bawtry Road had to be closed for two hours because of scattered debris and the risk of further explosions.

Following the explosion, demolition of the stadium was rapidly sped up. For a long time after its demolition, areas of terrace were still identifiable and large sections of the pitch remained. Floodlights, executive boxes, turnstiles, snack bars and offices were all removed or destroyed, along with the ground&#x27;s club house, the Rovers&#x27; Return.

The site was patrolled by security following the explosion and was fenced off whilst demolition work was undertaken.

The whole area has now been redeveloped as a housing estate with virtually all traces of the old stadium now removed.

<doc id="909196" wikidata="Q79195" url="?curid=909196" title="Hot Rats">
<text>Hot Rats is the second solo album by Frank Zappa, released in October 1969. It was Zappa&#x27;s first recording project after the dissolution of the original lineup of the Mothers of Invention. Five of the six songs are instrumental, while &quot;Willie the Pimp&quot; features vocals by Captain Beefheart. In his original sleeve notes, Zappa described the album as &quot;a movie for your ears&quot;.

Zappa dedicated the album to his newborn son, Dweezil. In February 2009, Dweezil&#x27;s tribute band to his father, Zappa Plays Zappa, won a Grammy for Best Rock Instrumental Performance for their rendition of &quot;Peaches en Regalia&quot;.

==Background==
Because &quot;Hot Rats&quot; largely consists of instrumental jazz-influenced compositions with extensive soloing, the music sounds very different from earlier Zappa albums, which featured satirical vocal performances with extensive use of musique concrète and editing. Besides Zappa, multi-instrumentalist Ian Underwood and guitarist Lowell George are the only members of the Mothers to appear on the album, with Underwood being Zappa&#x27;s primary musical collaborator. Other featured musicians were bassists Max Bennett and Shuggie Otis (who was only 15 years old at the time of the session); drummers John Guerin, Paul Humphrey and Ron Selico; and electric violinists Don &quot;Sugarcane&quot; Harris and Jean-Luc Ponty.

This was the first Frank Zappa album recorded on 16-track equipment and one of the first albums to use this technology. Machines with 16 individual tracks allow for much more flexibility in multi-tracking and overdubbing than the professional 4 and 8-track reel-to-reel tape recorders that were standard in 1969.

In the &quot;Q&quot; &amp; &quot;Mojo&quot; Classic Special Edition &quot;Pink Floyd &amp; The Story of Prog Rock&quot;, the album was number 13 in its list of &quot;40 Cosmic Rock Albums&quot;. It was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. In 2000 it was voted number 123 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

==Advanced recording techniques==
Zappa used advanced recording equipment to create an album of outstanding technical and musical quality. The album was recorded on what Zappa described as a &quot;homemade sixteen track&quot; recorder; the machine was custom built by engineers at TTG Studios in Hollywood in late 1968. Additional tracks made it possible for Zappa to add multiple horn and keyboard overdubs. Only a few musicians were required to create an especially rich instrumental texture which gives the sound of a large group. It was this use of advanced overdubbing that was the main motivation for Zappa, who hated playing in a studio.

==Artwork==
The colorful, psychedelic aura of the late sixties is apparent in the graphic design and photography of &quot;Hot Rats&quot;. This one-disc album had a gatefold featuring the elaborate artwork of Cal Schenkel, at a time when gatefold covers were less common and just coming into vogue. The front and back cover photos by Andee Nathanson use infrared photography and reflect Zappa&#x27;s taste for striking visual images, combined with the absurdly humorous. The woman pictured on the cover is Christine Frka, alias Miss Christine of The GTOs. For years these cover photos were incorrectly credited to Ed Caraeff.

==Release history==
The LP was released on the blue Bizarre label in the United States in 1969. The inside of the original gatefold LP cover has a collage of color pictures, many of which were taken during the recording sessions. In 1973 the album was re-issued by Reprise Records. This version was deleted in 1981 when Zappa&#x27;s contract with record distributor Warner Bros. Records ended.

In 1987 Zappa remixed &quot;Hot Rats&quot; for re-issue on CD by Rykodisc. On this edition many of the photos were removed, and the few that were included were printed in black and white. &quot;Willie the Pimp&quot; is edited differently during the introduction and guitar solo. &quot;The Gumbo Variations&quot; is four minutes longer; it includes an introduction and guitar and saxophone solo sections which were left out of the LP version. On &quot;Little Umbrellas&quot;, the piano and flute are more prominent than on the LP. Other differences include significant changes to the overall ambiance and dynamic range. The 1995 CD reissue restored the full gatefold artwork.

A 2008 remaster of the original mix was used for a 2009 limited edition audiophile LP by Classic Records and for the 2012 Universal Music CD reissue.
 Zappa Records reissued the album in a 180 gram LP in 2016, remastered by Bernie Grundman. On 20 December 2019, Zappa Records released &quot;The Hot Rats Sessions&quot;, a 50th anniversary 6 CD box set of music recorded during the sessions for the album which included the no longer available 1987 mix and many previously unissued takes and mixes.

The album was a top ten hit in Britain and the Netherlands in 1969–1970.

<text>Tara Anne Cassandra Fitzgerald (born 18 September 1967) is an English actress who has appeared in feature films, television, radio and the stage. She won the New York Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Play in 1995 as Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. She won the Best Actress Award at The Reims International Television Festival in 1999 for her role of Lady Dona St Columb in &quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Creek&quot;. Fitzgerald has appeared in the West End production of &quot;The Misanthrope&quot; at the Comedy Theatre, and in Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse. Since 2007, Fitzgerald has appeared in more than 30 episodes of the BBC television series &quot;Waking the Dead&quot; and played the role of Selyse Baratheon in the HBO series &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;.

==Early life==
Fitzgerald is the daughter of artist Michael Callaby and Irish portrait photographer Sarah Geraldine Fitzgerald. She spent part of her childhood in the Bahamas, where her maternal grandfather ran a law firm. Her sister, Arabella, was born there. Following the family&#x27;s return to England when she was three, Fitzgerald&#x27;s parents separated, and her mother then married the Irish actor Norman Rodway. She has a half-sister from this marriage, Bianca Rodway. Her father, Callaby, died when she was 11. Her great-aunt was actress Geraldine Fitzgerald; other cousins through the Fitzgerald family are the Irish novelist Jennifer Johnston and Irish actress Susan Fitzgerald.

==Career==
===Film===
Following her graduation from Drama Centre London, Fitzgerald appeared as the daughter of a beauty queen in the comedy &quot;Hear My Song&quot; (1991). She came to international attention in 1993 when she starred with Hugh Grant in the Australian comedy &quot;Sirens&quot;. The film landed Fitzgerald an Australian Film Institute nomination for Best Actress in a Lead Role. Two years later she again appeared with Grant in the comedy&quot; The Englishman who Went up a Hill but Came down a Mountain&quot;. Fitzgerald appeared in a steady stream of independent feature films through the 1990s and 2000s, among them &quot;A Man of No Importance&quot; (1994), &quot;Brassed Off&quot; (1996), the Czech World War II fighter pilot drama &quot;Dark Blue World&quot; (2001), and the 2004 drama, &quot;Secret Passage&quot; (UK title: The Lion&#x27;s Mouth), set during the Spanish Inquisition. In 2006, she appeared in &quot;In a Dark Place&quot;, and, in 2014, she played Miriam in &quot;&quot;.

Fitzgerald decided to expand her career into directing after becoming frustrated with what she saw as a lack of interesting roles for older actresses. She was one of 12 filmmakers selected for Film London&#x27;s 2015 Microwave scheme, which provides training and mentoring to filmmakers who then pitch their ideas to a panel that selects the two best ideas for production, with budgets of £150,000 each.

===Stage===
Fitzgerald&#x27;s first major stage role came in 1992 when she appeared opposite Peter O&#x27;Toole in &quot;Our Song&quot; at the Apollo Theatre. She has alternated between stage and screen for almost two decades, with frequent theatre roles. In 1995, she starred as Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot; at London&#x27;s Almeida Theatre, which led to her American stage debut. The production transferred across the Atlantic and played more than 90 performances on Broadway at the Belasco Theatre.

Since then, she has played &quot;Antigone&quot; in a national UK tour and Blanche Du Bois in Tennessee Williams&#x27;s &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; at the Bristol Old Vic and appeared in &quot;A Doll&#x27;s House&quot; at the Donmar Warehouse. Fitzgerald has also appeared in Molière&#x27;s The Misanthrope in 2009 at the Comedy Theatre (now the Pinter). She appeared in The Winters Tale at the RSC in 2013, performed as Lady Macbeth at Shakespeare&#x27;s Globe theatre and appeared in Gaslight at the Royal and Derngate Theatre in 2015.

===Television===
A veteran of more than twenty television programmes and mini-series, Fitzgerald has portrayed Victorian heroines and modern police detectives. Her first TV role was in the 1991 BBC production &quot;The Black Candle&quot;, set in Yorkshire in the 1880s. In 1992, she was featured in &quot;The Camomile Lawn&quot;. After her feature film success, she landed her first starring role in a television film, &quot;The Vacillations of Poppy Carew&quot;. She won Best Actress at the 1999 Reims International Television Festival for the costumes-and-pirates love story &quot;Frenchman&#x27;s Creek&quot;. In 2006, she was featured in &quot;The Virgin Queen&quot;, before taking on the role of Eve Lockhart on &quot;Waking The Dead&quot;, joining that cast in 2007. She also had a recurring role on &quot;Game of Thrones&quot;, playing Selyse Baratheon. In 2020 Tara Fitzgerald played a role as Lady Templemore in the ITV-series &quot;Belgravia&quot;, a historical drama based on the 2016 novel of the same name by Julian Fellowes.

==Personal life==

In 2001, Fitzgerald married the English actor-director John Sharian, who directed her in the short film &quot;The Snatching of Bookie Bob&quot;. They separated in May 2003 and later divorced.

Fitzgerald lives in London.

<doc id="909210" wikidata="Q267771" url="?curid=909210" title="Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metre backstroke">
<text>The men&#x27;s 200 metre backstroke event at the 2004 Olympic Games was contested at the Olympic Aquatic Centre of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Athens, Greece on August 18 and 19. There were 36 competitors from 30 nations. Each nation had been limited to two swimmers in the event since 1984.

U.S. swimmer Aaron Peirsol won a gold medal in this event, with an Olympic record time of 1:54.95. Markus Rogan, silver medalist in the 100 metre backstroke, added another silver for Austria in the same stroke, in an outstanding time of 1:57.35. Romania&#x27;s Răzvan Florea, who finished behind Rogan by 0.21 of a second, earned a bronze in 1:57.56. Peirsol became the fifth swimmer and fourth American in Olympic history to claim titles in two backstroke events. He was also only the third swimmer to win multiple medals in the men&#x27;s 200 backstroke (Roland Matthes and Mitch Ivey both did so in 1968 and 1972). It was the third consecutive, and sixth overall, victory for the United States in the event. It was Austria&#x27;s first medal in the men&#x27;s 200 metre backstroke since 1900; Romania had never won a medal in the event before.

In the final, Peirsol won the race but was disqualified for a noncontinuous backstroke turn (in backstroke, a swimmer is allowed to rotate onto his/her stomach going into a turn, as long as 1) only one arm pull occurs while the swimmer is on his/her stomach and 2) the turn is one smooth motion ). The judge in Peirsol&#x27;s lane indicated that Peirsol had kicked in to the wall on the third turn. Peirsol&#x27;s disqualification was appealed, and overturned, reinstating his time and finish. An initial statement from FINA was that the explanation given on the judge&#x27;s report was &quot;inadequate and not in the working language of FINA.&quot; The judge was from France, and the official languages of FINA are French and English. A later statement by FINA executive director Cornel Mărculescu revealed that the judge&#x27;s report, which had also been signed off on by two other officials including referee Woon Sui Kut, was blank. All three officials were removed from further involvement with the 2004 Olympic swimming competitions. The British team have announced their intention to appeal to a higher body in an attempt to get their fourth-place swimmer James Goddard for a bronze medal.

==Background==

This was the 12th appearance of the 200 metre backstroke event. It was first held in 1900. The event did not return until 1964; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games. From 1904 to 1960, a men&#x27;s 100 metre backstroke was held instead. In 1964, only the 200 metres was held. Beginning in 1968 and ever since, both the 100 and 200 metre versions have been held.

Six of the 8 finalists from the 2000 Games returned: silver medalist Aaron Peirsol of the United States, bronze medalist Matt Welsh of Australia, fifth-place finisher (and 1996 bronze medalist) Emanuele Merisi of Italy, sixth-place finisher Răzvan Florea of Romania, seventh-place finisher Rogério Romero of Brazil, and eighth-place finisher Gordan Kožulj of Croatia. Peirsol had won the 2001 and 2003 World Championships, broken the world record in 2002 and again at the 2004 U.S. Olympic trials, and won the 100 metre backstroke earlier in Athens; he was heavily favoured.

Finland made its debut in the event. Australia and Great Britain each made their 11th appearance, tied for most among nations to that point.

==Competition format==

The competition followed the format established in 2000, with three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer&#x27;s place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. The top 16 swimmers from the heats advanced to the semifinals. The top 8 semifinalists advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.

This swimming event used backstroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.

Prior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows:

<text>Ronald Frederick Geesin (born 17 December 1943) is a Scottish musician, composer and writer known for his unusual creations and novel applications of sound. He is also well known for his collaborations with Pink Floyd and Roger Waters.

==Career==
Ron Geesin began his career from 1961 to 1965 as pianist with The Original Downtown Syncopators (ODS), a revivalist jazz band emulating the American Original Dixieland Jazz Band. The band was based in Crawley, Sussex, England. After leaving the Original Downtown Syncopators, Geesin’s &quot;chance careering&quot; took three main distinct but parallel routes: 1) live improvised performances in venues as diverse as folk clubs and the Royal Albert Hall; 2) music and effects for The Media, including all four domestic BBC Radio networks, and advertising, documentary and feature films; 3) stand-alone works for LPs and CDs.

After his first solo album in 1967, &quot;A Raise of Eyebrows&quot;, Geesin launched a one-man record company with the self-released &quot;As He Stands&quot;, &quot;Patruns&quot;, and &quot;Right Through&quot;. In 1971, he produced and played on the pastoral &quot;Songs for the Gentle Man&quot; by Bridget St John. Many of his electronic compositions were used as soundtracks to ITV&#x27;s 1970s and 1980s television broadcasts for schools and colleges. After scoring &quot;The Body&quot; (1970), his other film scores include John Schlesinger&#x27;s film &quot;Sunday Bloody Sunday&quot; (1971), &quot;Ghost Story&quot; (1974), &quot;Sword of the Valiant&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Girl in the Picture&quot; (1985).

Geesin is known for his collaborations with Pink Floyd and Roger Waters. After the band found themselves deadlocked over how to complete the title track from &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; in 1970, Pink Floyd entrusted him with the backing track mix on tape while they went on a US tour. He analysed and mapped the whole tape, then orchestrated all the material, including melodies, for 10 brass, 20 choir and solo cello. When the group returned from the US, the work was recorded in EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studios. Before this project, Geesin collaborated with the band&#x27;s bass player Roger Waters on the soundtrack for the feature film, &quot;The Body&quot;, and compiled the album, &quot;Music from The Body&quot; (1970), adding two new tracks, including sound samples from the human body.

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, Geesin collaborated with the film maker Stephen Dwoskin on several films including &quot;Chinese Checkers&quot;, &quot;Alone&quot; and &quot;Naissant&quot;. In 1970, he produced a sound-work for the British pavilion at the Osaka world fair. He was featured in &#x27;Crossing Bridges&#x27;, a 1985 music programme based around jazz guitar improvisation, and broadcast by Channel 4.

During the 1990s, he collaborated with the artist Ian Breakwell on video projects such as the large-scale work &quot;Auditorium&quot; and live art pieces such as &quot;Christmas Carol&quot; (1991) in which four synchronised figures dressed in Santa Claus costumes performed in Newcastle&#x27;s Northumberland Street, having been banned from the Gateshead MetroCentre. In 1990, he designed and produced the &#x27;Tune Tube&#x27;, a giant interactive sound and light installation at the MacLellan Galleries, as part of ‘Glasgow 1990’.

One of his rare appearances with other artists on the same album was on the record &quot;Miniatures - a sequence of tiny masterpieces&quot; (Cherry Red Records, 1980) produced by Morgan Fisher. Like all the other 50 tracks on the album, Geesin&#x27;s track &quot;Enterbrain Exit&quot; was about one minute long.

In the 1990s, Headscope released two CDs, &quot;Funny Frown&quot; and &quot;Bluefuse&quot;, melding modern technology with appropriated and found sounds. In 1994, Cherry Red Records released the &quot;Hystery&quot; CD, an overview of his career. In 1995, Cleopatra Records released his &quot;Land of Mist&quot; CD, a collection of instrumental ambience. In 1995, See for Miles Records re-issued his first two vinyl albums on CD. Headscope followed in 2003 with the CD &quot;Right Through - and Beyond&quot;, a reissue of his last vinyl album, unissued material and a &quot;Sour New Year&quot; suite.

In 2008, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; was recreated live on stage at the Cadogan Hall, Chelsea, London, featuring brass, choir, cello, and Italian Pink Floyd tribute band Mun Floyd. The track was presented alongside a Geesin solo performance; &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; itself was extended to 35 minutes, developing the cello solos and taking in a section originally as written and again as recorded differently. David Gilmour joined the musicians for the second performance. In 2012, the French Education System chose it to be studied within the Baccalauréat 2012-2013. Geesin took part in the live performance that was also videoed at the Théatre du Châtelet, Paris in January 2012.

Geesin&#x27;s 2011 album was called &quot;Roncycle1: the journey of a melody&quot;. In 2012, he was asked by The History Press to write his version of the history of &quot;Atom Heart Mother (suite)&quot;, published in July 2013 and titled &quot;The Flaming Cow&quot;. An avid collector of adjustable spanners (wrenches), amassing 3,000 specimens over a thirty-year period, in 2016 he published &quot;The Adjustable Spanner&quot;. Late in 2020, Headscope published his collected writings as &quot;The Stapled Brain&quot;.

In 2019, the Italian avantgarde label Dark Companion published &quot;ExpoZoom&quot;, an unissued work commissioned by the British Council to Geesin for the British Pavilion at the 1970 expo in Japan.

Geesin is married to the artist Frances Geesin. The couple collaborated in 1990 on an interactive installation of three panels called &quot;Tri-Aura&quot; at The Science Museum, London.

<text>In epidemiology, a risk factor or determinant is a variable associated with an increased risk of disease or infection.

Due to a lack of harmonization across disciplines, determinant, in its more widely accepted , is often used as a synonym. The main difference lies in the realm of practice: medicine (clinical practice) versus public health. As an example from clinical practice, low ingestion of dietary sources of vitamin C is a known risk factor for developing scurvy. Specific to public health policy, a determinant is a health risk that is general, abstract, related to inequalities, and difficult for an individual to control. For example, poverty is known to be a determinant of an individual&#x27;s standard of health.

Risk factors may be used to identify high-risk people.

==Correlation vs causation==
Risk factors or determinants are correlational and not necessarily causal, because correlation does not prove causation. For example, being young cannot be said to cause measles, but young people have a higher rate of measles because they are less likely to have developed immunity during a previous epidemic. Statistical methods are frequently used to assess the strength of an association and to provide causal evidence, for example in the study of the link between smoking and lung cancer. Statistical analysis along with the biological sciences can establish that risk factors are causal. Some prefer the term risk factor to mean causal determinants of increased rates of disease, and for unproven links to be called possible risks, associations, etc.

When done thoughtfully and based on research, identification of risk factors can be a strategy for medical screening.

==Terms of description==
Mainly taken from risk factors for breast cancer, risk factors can be described in terms of, for example:
* Relative risk, such as &quot;A woman is more than 100 times more likely to develop breast cancer in her 60s than in her 20s.&quot;
* Odds ratio, such as &quot;The odds of developing breast cancer are approximately 2.45 times higher for women with two or more affected first-degree relatives compared to those without a family history.&quot;
* Fraction of incidences occurring in the group having the property of or being exposed to the risk factor, such as &quot;99% of breast cancer cases are diagnosed in women.&quot;
* Increase in incidence in the exposed group, such as &quot;each daily alcoholic beverage increases the incidence of breast cancer by 11 cases per 1000 women.&quot;
* Hazard ratio, such as &quot;an increase in both total and invasive breast cancers in women randomized to receive estrogen and progestin for an average of 5 years, with a hazard ratio of 1.24 compared to controls.&quot;

==Example==
At a wedding, 74 people ate the chicken and 22 of them were ill, while of the 35 people who had the fish or vegetarian meal only 2 were ill. Did the chicken make the people ill?

:formula_1

So the chicken eaters&#x27; risk = 22/74 = 0.297
And non-chicken eaters&#x27; risk = 2/35 = 0.057.

Those who ate the chicken had a risk over five times as high as those who did not, that is, a relative risk of more than five. This suggests that eating chicken was the cause of the illness, but this is &quot;not&quot; proof.

This example of a risk factor is described in terms of the relative risk it confers, which is evaluated by comparing the risk of those exposed to the potential risk factor to those not exposed.

==General determinants==
The probability of an outcome usually depends on an interplay between multiple associated variables. When performing epidemiological studies to evaluate one or more determinants for a specific outcome, the other determinants may act as confounding factors, and need to be controlled for, e.g. by stratification. The potentially confounding determinants varies with what outcome is studied, but the following general confounders are common to most epidemiological associations, and are the determinants most commonly controlled for in epidemiological studies:
* Age (0 to 1.5 years for infants, 1.5 to 6 years for young children, etc.)
* Sex or gender (Male or female)
* Ethnicity (Based on race)

Other less commonly adjusted for possible confounders include:
* Social status/income 
* Geographic location
* Genetic predisposition
* Gender identity
* Occupation
* Overwork
* Sexual orientation
* Level of chronic stress
* Diet
* Level of physical exercise
* Alcohol consumption and tobacco smoking
* Other social determinants of health

==Risk marker==
A &quot;risk marker&quot; is a variable that is quantitatively associated with a disease or other outcome, but direct alteration of the risk marker does not necessarily alter the risk of the outcome. For example, driving-while-intoxicated (DWI) history is a risk marker for pilots as epidemiologic studies indicate that pilots with a DWI history are significantly more likely than their counterparts without a DWI history to be involved in aviation crashes.

==History==
The term &quot;risk factor&quot; was coined by former Framingham Heart Study director, William B. Kannel in a 1961 article in &quot;Annals of Internal Medicine&quot;.

<text>Thomas Bainbrigge Fletcher (25 March 1878 – 30 April 1950) was an English entomologist. Although an amateur lepidopterist who worked in the Royal Navy, he became an expert on &quot;microlepidoptera&quot; and was appointed as the second Imperial Entomologist in India to succeed Harold Maxwell Lefroy. Although only an amateur entomologist, he is credited with reorganizing entomological research in India by coordinating and directing research, efficient sharing of findings and a reduction in duplication of research work.
Fletcher&#x27;s father William Bainbrigge Fletcher was a fleet surgeon in the Royal Navy (retired 1890). Thomas became a naval paymaster until he retired in 1915. While in the navy, he joined the Percy Sladen Trust Expedition to the Indian Ocean and was appointed Imperial Entomologist in India, succeeding Harold Maxwell-Lefroy at the Imperial Agricultural Research Institute at Pusa. Although lacking academic qualifications in entomology, he was a meticulous naturalist and very careful on matters of systematics and taxonomic nomenclature. His work as head of entomological research in India was initially on identifying work that had already been done and that which was ongoing. By conducting meetings of researchers he ensured that duplication was avoided. 

At the third entomological meeting in 1919 he made a call for a boycott of German tools and a call to ignore German publications from 1914 citing a practice called for by Sir George Hampson.

He produced a &quot;List of Publications On Indian Entomology&quot; and a &quot;Catalogue of Indian Insects&quot;. He also worked out the life-histories of many moth species in the families Gelechidae, Cosmopterygidae, Neopseutidae and Tortricidae and produced &quot;A List of Generic Names used for Microlepidoptera&quot; (1929). He also wrote several more general works on entomology including &quot;Some South Indian Insects&quot; (1914), &quot;Tentative Keys to the Orders and families of Indian insects&quot; (1926), &quot;A Veterinary Entomology for India&quot; and &quot;Hints On Collecting and Preserving Insects&quot;. His knowledge of classical Greek, Latin and French and a popular style of writing also allowed him to write for lay audiences. His book &quot;Birds of an Indian Garden&quot; with Charles M. Inglis was meant for non-specialist readers.
Fletcher was a fellow of the Linnean Society, the Royal Entomological Society, Zoological Society of London and a president of the Cotteswold Naturalists&#x27; Field Club. He married Esme Violet Hollingbery at Saidpur, Uttar Pradesh, on 17 February 1917. His wife left India and was hospitalized in London for many years and in 1947, he suffered from a stroke that left him partly paralysed on the right side. He donated the bulk of Rodborough Common in Gloucestershire to the National Trust in 1937 (after the National Trust declined an earlier offer in 1935). In 1949 he filed for bankruptcy but his assets were valued at £4762, enough to pay off his debts of £1119.

His position as Imperial Entomologist was succeeded by Hem Singh Pruthi.

Species named after him include:
* &quot;Basilia fletcheri&quot;

<text>The  or VAB (literally meaning &quot;Armoured Forward Vehicle&quot;; but more appropriately translated: &quot;Armoured Vanguard Vehicle&quot;) is a French armoured personnel carrier and support vehicle designed and manufactured by &quot;Renault Trucks Defense&quot; (now known as Arquus). It entered French service in 1979 and around 5,000 were produced for the French Army as well as for export. It has seen combat in various conflicts in Africa, Asia as well as Europe and has also been exported to more than 15 countries.

A polyvalent military vehicle, the VAB has more than thirty variants and sub-variants. Beyond their common primary role of transporting personnel and equipment in combat zones, some VAB are tailored for mechanized infantry combat, some fulfill the role of anti-tank missile launchers, some of self-propelled mortars, some are optimized for electronic warfare, others act as reconnaissance or artillery observation vehicles, etc.

, it still is the standard APC of the French Army but is gradually being replaced by its successors, the six-wheel VBMR Griffon (introduced in 2019) and the four-wheel VBMR-L Serval (introduced in 2022).

== Design ==
The VAB was designed as a wheeled troop transporter, complementing the tracked AMX-10P. Specifications for the project called for an NBC-proof, amphibious (Its propulsion in water is either by its wheels or twin water jets), lightly armoured vehicle to provide infantry with basic protection against shrapnel and light infantry weapons. These features were dictated by its possible usage in the event of an all-out conventional war breaking out against the Warsaw Pact; in particular, the amphibious capabilities were needed to bridge the rivers in Eastern France and in Germany.

Companies Panhard and Saviem/Renault answered the requirement, and the Renault prototype was selected in May 1974, with 4,000 units ordered. The first delivery occurred in 1976, and production continued at a rate of 30 to 40 units a month.

An armoured double-door at the rear allows access to the passenger compartment. Two inward-facing, foldable benches provide seating for 5 soldiers each. The crew enters the front compartment through two lateral hatches, the driver on the left and gunner on the right; two additional hatches in the roof give access to armaments and provide emergency exits. The front windows are bullet-proof and heated. All the windows can be further protected by armoured panels, which can be shut entirely or leaving a small observation slit. The engine is located behind the driver, while the right side of the vehicle is kept free, providing a passageway between the crew and passenger compartments.

With a modest 13-tonne mass, the VAB can easily be airlifted for deployment abroad.

The VAB&#x27;s large wheels allow it to sustain up to 60% grades and road/rail canting of up to 30%.

From 1998, the French Army&#x27;s VABs underwent three major overhauls:
* replacement of the manual gear by an automatic transmission (T1)
* replacement of the brakes and automatic tire pressurization (T2)
* armour upgrade (T3)

These overhauled vehicles are known as VAB Valorisé. From 1990, the VAB NG (new generation) with improved armour and new engine was offered. In the 2000s, Renault offered engine upgrades to any VABs in service from MAN diesel engines to Renault MIDS 06 20 45 turbocharged diesel engines by removing the torque converterer oil reservoir bracket, modifying the existing right-hand engine bracket and the installation of a cooling unit.

In 2003, Renault Trucks Défense took over marketing the VAB from GIAT. At &quot;Eurosatory 2010&quot;, Renault unveiled the heavier VAB MkII, with more internal space and Level 4 protection. The MkII version was also shown in the BRIDEX 2011 convention.

In &quot;Eurosatory 2012&quot;; the VAB MkIII was presented publicly, being a new vehicle with better protection against IEDs and anti-vehicle mines up to STANAG Level 4 protection. Armored plating against RPG rockets is made in collaboration with Plasan.

It&#x27;s being marketed only in a 6x6 wheeled configuration with either a Renault MD7 engine developing 340 hp or a Caterpillar C7 developing 370 hp with automatic transmission.

=== Armour upgrade ===

The upgrade of the VAB with MEXAS composite armour aimed at increasing from protection against light infantry weapons to protection against heavy machine guns, typically 12.7 mm projectiles. This increased the weight of the vehicles by about two tonnes, thereby losing its amphibious capabilities.

The amphibious shape of the hull, the relatively light weight and the armour upgrade seem to give the VAB strong resistance against mines. When exposed to an explosion from below, the VAB tends to be lifted in the air, allowing the force of the blast to disperse away from the vehicle. In particular, the hull shape and position of the wheels deflects the shock wave, helping maintain hull integrity.

=== Turrets ===
The heavy machine gun version of the carries a M2HB 12.7mm machine gun in an open turret; the light version sports the AA52 7.5mm machine gun in a similar arrangement.

The AA-52 is a 7.62mm GPMG mounted on the VAB has a length of 1,080 mm and a barrel length of 600 mm. Weighing 9.970 kg, this machine gun operates through a lever-delayed blowback action mechanism, enabling a maximum rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute. Its effective firing range spans 600 meters, with a maximum firing range of 3,200 meters. The AA-52 is equipped with a belt feed system and features Iron Removable APX (SOM) telescopic sights and an infrared scope for precision targeting. The ammunition utilized includes rifle rounds with a caliber of 7.62, compatible with cartridges such as the 7.5×54mm French and the 7.62×51mm NATO. With a muzzle velocity of 830 m/s, the AA-52 is capable of delivering sustained firepower with a basic load of 900 rounds.
In both cases, the gunner&#x27;s only protection from incoming fire is an armoured panel on the front and the two halves of the hatch door on the sides, giving little protection against indirect fire, surprise attacks and explosions — or if the VAB rolls over. As of July 2007, all the personnel killed by mines aboard VABs had occupied the gunner position (though serious injuries were sometimes sustained by crewmen inside the hull).

From 2007, the Army head of staff repeatedly requested that remotely operated 12.7mm turrets be fitted on these vehicles, as a crash requirement. A program was launched, scheduling turret and battle command upgrades for over 500 VABs, now labeled VAB TOP (&quot;tourelle TéléOPérée&quot;). In May 2008, Renault Trucks Defense signed an eight-year, 20 million euro contract with Kongsberg Gruppen of Norway, for equipping the VAB with subsidiary Kongsberg Defence &amp; Aerospace&#x27;s Protector Remote Weapon Station (RWS). Deliveries were scheduled from 2009 to 2016.
From early 2009 onwards, about 60 VAB-TOP were deployed in Afghanistan, seeing their first combat during the Battle of Alasay. Field experience shows a significant drop in ammunition consumption with the tele-operated turret, whose computer allows the operator to fire efficient single shots, rather than bursts. This partially alleviates concerns raised by the need to reload this turret from outside.

=== Replacement ===
Replacement of the VAB is scheduled for around 2020. A diesel-electric vehicle stemming from the EBM10-EBM20 programme is due to be selected. The Armoured Multirole Carrier has been cited as a strong contender.

== Combat history ==

VABs have been deployed in virtually all theatres where French infantry troops were present, notably Kuwait, Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Yugoslavia, and Chad. French troops supporting ISAF in Afghanistan also use the VAB. During the Uzbin valley ambush, a VAB was hit by a rocket propelled grenade, with no injuries. One soldier manning the rooftop machine gun of a VAB was later killed when the road collapsed under his vehicle and it rolled over. In March 2009, a VAB driver was killed by a rocket attack during the battle of Alasay.

=== Africa ===
VABs belonging to the Royal Moroccan Army (FAR) have seen heavy combat during the conflict with Polisario rebels of the Western Sahara.

=== Middle East ===
A total of 95 VABs were delivered to the Lebanese Army between 1981 and 1984, being extensively employed during the Lebanese Civil War, with several vehicles serving under the Shia Amal Movement militia banner after the Army&#x27;s predominantly Shia 6th Infantry Brigade went over to their coreligionists in February 1984. After the end of the war in the 1990s, additional VABs were delivered to the Lebanese Internal Security Forces (ISF) for use in the escort and internal security roles.

=== Ukraine ===

As of February 2024, at least 14 VAB vehicles were destroyed during the Russian invasion of Ukraine. A further 6 were damaged and abandoned.

== Variants ==

<doc id="909230" wikidata="Q7665735" url="?curid=909230" title="1998 São Toméan parliamentary election">
<text>Parliamentary elections were held in São Tomé and Príncipe on 8 November 1998. The result was a victory for the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe-Social Democratic Party, which won 31 of the 55 seats in the National Assembly. Voter Turnout was 64.5%.

==Background==
The 1998 National Assembly elections were originally scheduled for late September/early October as impressive progress on voter registration was made. On 1 September, however, President Miguel Trovoada issued a decree setting the polling date at 8 November.

Nine political parties competed for the 55 seats at stake. These included the three represented in the outgoing parliament: the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe (MLSTP-PSD), the Democratic Convergence Party (PCD) and the Independent Democratic Action (ADI). Since the previous elections in 1994, the first two groups had governed in a coalition, led since November 1996 by Prime Minister Raul Bragança Neto. ADI, for its part, supported the policies of President Trovoada.

The election campaign lasted from 22 October to 6 November. Issues debated centered on the exploitation of offshore oil reserves and the country&#x27;s entry into the monetary Franc zone. Mr. Bragança (MLSTP) stated that his party had improved economic conditions and brought political stability to Sao Tome, which had seen a succession of governments in the 1990s. Led by Alda Bandeira, the PCD called for continued coalition rule to ensure such stability.

Polling day was monitored by international observers. Final results gave an absolute majority (31 seats) to the left-leaning MLSTP-PSD, which had fallen short of this edge by only one seat in 1994. In this context, ADI alleged irregularities in the voting procedure. The victors promptly announced that their priority would be to reorganize the economy and thus alleviate the widespread poverty plaguing the nation.

On 30 December, President Trovoada appointed former Foreign Minister Guilherme Posser da Costa (MLSTP) as Prime Minister; he and the new Cabinet were sworn in on 5 January 1999.

<text>Charles McFarlane Inglis FES, FZS (8 November 1870 – 13 February 1954) was a naturalist and curator of the Darjeeling museum in India from 1923 to 1948. The museum was run by the Bengal Natural History Society and many of his writings were published in that society&#x27;s journal which he started and edited.

Inglis was born in Elgin, Scotland, the son of Archibald Inglis, a retired indigo planter in India who went to India at the age of 18. Little is known of Inglis&#x27; early life but he gave up an office job in Inverness and moved to India where he worked initially at Roopachera Tea Estate in Hailekandi. He became interested in birds after a collector working for Allan Octavian Hume showed him a specimen of an oriole. He subsequently contacted E C Stuart Baker. In 1898 he became an indigo planter in Baghownie. During this time made studies of birds and collected many specimens of butterflies and dragonflies. In 1923 he took over as curator of the Darjeeling Natural History Museum. He then retired to Coonoor where he died in 1954.

His ability to sketch and illustrate birds led to Thomas Bainbrigge Fletcher inviting him to produce a series of articles on birds of importance to agriculture in India. These were published in the Agricultural Journal of India and were later revised and published as a book &quot;Birds of an Indian Garden&quot; in 1924.

Inglis shot eight specimens of the pink-headed duck in Bihar from 1903, including the last known specimen collected in June 1935 from Baghownie.

==Plot==
Set in between the two World Wars, Noelle Page is born to a poor family in Marseille, France, though she is led to believe she is better than everyone else. She is initially devoted to her father, who capitalizes on her beauty when she comes of age and forces her to be the mistress of Auguste Lanchon, a well-off boutique owner. She comes to an epiphany that if she can control men, she can be powerful. She escapes to Paris, where she is enchanted by American pilot Lawrence &quot;Larry&quot; Douglas, who promises to marry her when he returns from London. When he does not return, she develops pneumonia, and is saved by Jewish medical intern Israel Katz, who selflessly helps her get back on her feet. Furious over Larry&#x27;s betrayal, she aborts their unborn child in the most painful way and devotes the rest of her life planning revenge against him. Meanwhile, Larry returns to the United States and marries Catherine, though their relationship is strained after World War II, since Catherine feels like Larry returned as a different man.

Noelle uses the war to her advantage. She hires a private investigator and learns of Larry and Catherine&#x27;s marriage. She seduces two men, actor-singer Philippe Sorel and director Armand Gautier, and becomes a popular name in theater and film. At one point, she risks her plan to help Israel — the only man who has treated her with kindness — escape to Africa from the Nazis. She attracts the attention of Constantin &quot;Costa&quot; Demiris, a powerful Greek whose business extends to every industry in the world. She becomes his mistress and moves to his private villa. She learns that Larry is having a difficult time adjusting to a regular life and his aggressive pilot skills make him unsuited to a commercial airline setting, and convinces Demiris to hire him. Larry and Catherine move to Greece for his new job, whereupon Noelle discovers that Larry does not even remember her. She treats him poorly as an employee, pushing him to angrily rape her when she humiliates him. She gets excited and falls in love with him again. Larry cannot recall her claims of their past, but stays with her for her power. However, he becomes unsettled when his other mistress, Helena — compromising his and Noelle&#x27;s relationship — is badly beaten and then suddenly disappears. Noelle insists that Larry and Catherine, whose marriage is malfunctional, divorce so they can be together. When Catherine constantly refuses and fails an attempted suicide, Noelle plots with Larry to kill her. Larry pretends to reconcile with Catherine and talks her into going with him on a trip. He tries to abandon her in a sea cave, but is forced to return for her when the coast guard notices him exiting alone. While being treated for shock and exposure upon rescue from the cave, Catherine tries to tell the doctor about Larry&#x27;s plot to kill her, but the doctor thinks she is hallucinating. Catherine wakes up in the middle of the night and overhears Larry and Noelle plotting her death, so she escapes during a heavy thunderstorm. She goes into a boat, but falls overboard, apparently drowning.

Catherine&#x27;s claims against them cause Larry and Noelle to be put on trial for her murder. Demiris is noticeably absent, but visits Noelle in jail. He claims to still love her and offers to pay the judge off if she will stay with him forever. Towards the end of the trial, Demiris&#x27; lawyer, Napoleon Chotas, informs Larry, Noelle, and Larry&#x27;s lawyer Stavros that Demiris made a deal with the judge: if they plead guilty, Larry will be banned from Greece and will serve a short sentence in America while Noelle&#x27;s passport will be taken and she will stay with him forever. They both agree to the deal. However, after pleading guilty, they realize that there was never a deal made when the judge thanks them for having a conscience and admitting to the murder despite the lack of evidence against them. Chotas offers Stavros a position in his firm in exchange for his silence. They are sentenced to death, and Demiris, sitting in the courtroom, looks pleased. They are executed months later.

In the end, Demiris donates money to a convent near the sea, where a woman implied to be Catherine is kept, having been found on the shore.

<text>Tapton House, in Tapton, Derbyshire, England, was once the home of engineer George Stephenson, who built the first public railway line in the world to use steam locomotives. Tapton has been a gentleman&#x27;s residence, a ladies&#x27; boarding school and a co-educational school.

Tapton House grounds are now open for free use by the general public of Chesterfield to walk around and visit the Tapton Gardens. The grounds are also shared with the Tapton Park Innovation Centre. The House itself is now rented out as offices by Chesterfield Borough Council, and is a Grade II* listed building.

== History==
Tapton House was constructed in the late 18th century by the Wilkinson family of bankers, who also helped fund the construction of the Chesterfield Canal. English mechanical engineer George Stephenson, builder of the first public railway line in the world to use steam locomotives, leased the house from the family from 1832 until his death in 1848.

The house then was bought by Charles Paxton Markham, Director of Staveley Coal and Iron Company and three times Mayor of the town, in 1871 and became the family home until 1925, when he gave the of parkland to the Borough of Chesterfield. The borough turned the house into a school and in 1931, the first pupils passed through its doors as Tapton House Central Selective School. After the Second World War under the 1944 Education Act it became a co-educational secondary school, Tapton House School. The school continued to teach students until 1993 when it closed. After refurbishment in September 1994 it became a College of Further and Higher Education for the people of Chesterfield and the surrounding area, known as The Tapton House Campus of Chesterfield College. The College returned the building to the Borough Council in 2018. It is currently rented out as office space.

=== George Stephenson (1781–1848)===
George Stephenson, born in 1781, had already become a nationally known figure before he came to Chesterfield in the 1830s to construct the North Midland Railway which stretches from Derby to Leeds. His son Robert designed the historically important steam locomotive named Rocket for the Rainhill Trials at Liverpool in 1829.

He became so attached to Chesterfield that he spent the rest of his life in the area. Tapton House was his home for the last ten years of his life, until his death in August 1848 at the age of 67. Stephenson was buried in the Holy Trinity Church on Newbold Road, Chesterfield.

== Tapton Park Innovation Centre ==
The centre developed out of a partnership between Chesterfield Borough Council, North Derbyshire Chamber of Commerce and North Derbyshire Training and Enterprise Council. As well as funding from the partners the scheme was supported by the Single Regeneration Budget and European Union.

The futuristic building reflects the forwards thinking of George Stephenson. It is designed to provide modern accommodation to stimulate innovation and nurture growth amongst technology- and knowledge-based business. The centre has 39 rooms, 10 &quot;rent-a-desks&quot; and, following its opening in spring 1997, accommodates more than 40 companies.

== Peace Gardens ==
Opened in August 1947 by Mayor, Councillor Miss Florence Robinson, the gardens were constructed by the Parks Department Under the supervision of Mr J. E. Tindale, Park Superintendent.

== Castle Hill ==
This is an earth mound believed to be the site of a motte-and-bailey castle. The earth mound or motte would have been the site of the shell keep, being several buildings surrounded by heavy wooden palisade. Around 600 castles of this type are recorded and were built between 1000 and 1200 AD. The castle was incorporated within the grounds of Tapton House in the late 17th century.

<doc id="909249" wikidata="Q13485" url="?curid=909249" title="Laurent Jalabert">
<text>Laurent Jalabert (born 30 November 1968) is a French former professional road racing cyclist, from 1989 to 2002.

Affectionately known as &quot;Jaja&quot; (slang for a glass of wine; when he continued drinking wine as a professional, the nickname stuck because of the similarity to his name), he won many one-day and stage races and was ranked number 1 in the world in 1995, 1996, 1997 and 1999.

Although he never won the Tour de France, where he suffered altitude sickness, he won the Vuelta a España in 1995; as well as the leader&#x27;s jersey, he won the sprinter&#x27;s jersey and climber&#x27;s jersey in the same race — only the third rider to have done this in a Grand Tour. With Alessandro Petacchi, Eddy Merckx, Djamolidine Abdoujaparov and Mark Cavendish, he is one of only five riders to win the points classification in all three grand tours.

==Biography==
He turned professional with the French Toshiba team in 1989 and quickly established himself as a daring sprinter. He moved on to the Spanish ONCE team under Manolo Saiz, where he reinvented himself as an all-rounder capable of winning one-day races and the tours.

A catalyst was an accident at the finish of the 1994 Tour de France stage in Armentières. A policeman leaned out and several riders hit him. Jalabert was flung into the air and his bicycle was destroyed. He injured his face and promised his wife to change his style of riding. It only took a short while.

He won the 1995 Vuelta a España along with the points and climbers&#x27; competitions. He won the world time trial championship in 1997, and was French road champion in 1998, the year he initiated a pull-out of Spanish teams from the 1998 Tour de France in protest at treatment of riders in a police inquiry into drug-taking. This caused discontent among French fans and it took years for them to warm to him. He moved to CSC in 2001, where he won the stage on 14 July, the French national day, Bastille Day, in the 2001 Tour de France. Earlier in the year he had injured his back in a domestic accident. He retired in 2002 after winning the mountains classification in the Tour de France and going on a solo escape in the Pyrenees.

==Grand tours==
He won several stages of the Tour de France, as a sprinter winning the points classification in the Tour de France twice and as a climber winning the mountains classification in the Tour de France twice. His wins on Bastille Day in Tour de France in 1995 and 2001 ensured him a place in the hearts of French fans.

In the 1990s he dominated Spanish stage races. Jalabert and Alex Zülle were a constant threat to other teams in the Vuelta a España, taking turns winning stages, the overall classification and the points jersey. The strength of ONCE, with domestiques such as Johan Bruyneel and Neil Stephens, meant they were able to keep a rein from start to finish.

Besides Eddy Merckx and Tony Rominger, Jalabert is the only cyclist who has accomplished the &quot;trifecta&quot; at the &quot;grand tour&quot; level in the 1995 Vuelta a España, where he won the general, sprinters&#x27; and climbers&#x27; classifications.

Jalabert is known for sporting generosity. In the 1995 Vuelta he allowed Bert Dietz of Telekom — who had been in a solo breakaway for many kilometers — to take the mountaintop stage win at Sierra Nevada even though he had caught Dietz in the final kilometers. &quot;I never thought we&#x27;d catch him, and when I saw he was ready to drop I felt sorry for him. I wanted to show it&#x27;s not true I&#x27;m trying to win it all. My goal is the Tour of Spain,&quot; Jalabert said.

When the Vuelta was moved to September, Jalabert was finally able to compete in the spring classics and stage races such as Paris–Nice, winning many stages and the overall classification many times.

==One-day races==
His palmarès include Milan–San Remo in 1995 and the Giro di Lombardia in 1997. He also won La Flèche Wallonne in 1995 and 1997, and the Clásica de San Sebastián in 2001 and 2002. Absent from his palmares is the world cycling championship road race, although he was second in 1992 to Gianni Bugno of Italy. He also won an award as the most combative rider in the Tour de France in 2001 and 2002.

==Retirement==
On retirement, Jalabert was a consultant for Look cycles and contributed to a new line of bicycle frames. He is a commentator for France 2 and 3, the national television stations, often from a motorcycle alongside the race. In 2005, Jalabert ran the New York City marathon in 2h 55m 39s, coming 391st in a field of 36,894. He lives with his wife Sylvie and their children at Lafrançaise, near Montauban, south-west France. His brother Nicolas, who often raced with him, continued racing after Laurent&#x27;s retirement.
Jalabert has also taken up triathlon. In January 2007, he competed at Ironman Switzerland and finished in 9 hours 12 minutes. He exited the water in 1:16, which put him 966th after the swim. Once on the bike he made up significant ground with a 4:39 bike split, which allowed him to climb to 91st overall at the run transition. A 3:11 marathon was enough to gain an additional 69 places and finish 22nd of 1,850 participants. After Switzerland he qualified for the Ironman World championship in Kona, Hawaii, finishing in 9:19 and 76th overall. In June, 2008, he finished 12th overall at Ironman France in Nice, improving his swim time to 1:06 and having the second fastest bike split.

On 11 March 2013 Jalabert was hit by a car while riding his bike near Montauban, France. When the ambulance arrived on the scene of the crash, he was found unconscious and with multiple fractures to his left arm and leg. That same year, Jalabert was summoned by the French senate for a testimony about doping. Jalabert never denied or confirmed that he had doped during his career: &quot;I can’t firmly say that I’ve never taken anything illegal. I’ve effectively used products when it was necessary, in case of lesions or other injuries. At ONCE, in the evening after the stages, the doctor took care of us, for our recovery, but we didn’t really know what it was. A relationship with doctors based on mutual trust was established, so we didn’t ask questions.&quot; He also stated that after the Festina affair, he wanted to help his sport move in a new, cleaner direction.
In June 2013, it was reported in &quot;L&#x27;Équipe&quot; that retroactive tests performed in 2004 had found evidence of EPO use in samples provided by Jalabert in 1998. The re-tests were originally anonymous, but the Senate inquiry in 2013 has subsequently linked the tests to named riders. Because of these alligations on EPO usage Jalabert has been accused of hypocrisy in criticism of Chris Froome&#x27;s performance in the 2015 Tour de France.

==Doping==
His name was on the list of doping tests published by the French Senate on 24 July 2013 that were collected during the 1998 Tour de France and found positive for EPO when retested in 2004.

<text>Daisy Bates (November 11, 1914 – November 4, 1999) was an American civil rights activist, publisher, journalist, and lecturer who played a leading role in the Little Rock Integration Crisis of 1957.

==Early life==
Daisy Bates was born on November 11, 1914, to her father Hezekiah Gatson, and her mother Millie Riley. She grew up in southern Arkansas in the small sawmill town of Huttig. Hezekiah Gatson supported the family by working as a lumber grader in a local mill. Her mother Millie Riley was murdered when Daisy was an infant, and the girl was given care by her mother&#x27;s close friends: Orlee Smith, a World War I veteran, and his wife Susie Smith. Her father Hezekiah abandoned her, and Daisy never saw him again. In &quot;The Death of My Mother&quot;, Bates recounted learning, at the age of eight, that her birth mother had been raped and murdered by three local white men, and her body thrown into a millpond, where it was later discovered.

Learning that no one was prosecuted for her mother&#x27;s murder stoked Daisy&#x27;s anger about injustice. Her adoptive father, Orlee Smith, told her that the killers were never found and that the police showed little interest in the case. Daisy wanted vengeance. She later wrote:

She began to hate white people. Out of concern and hope, her adoptive father gave her some advice from his deathbed:

Bates said she had never forgotten that. She believed that this memory supported her strength for leadership in the cause of civil rights.

Before Daisy was exposed to her biological mother&#x27;s death, she often played with Beatrice, a white girl around her age. They shared pennies for hard candy, and got along well.

Bates&#x27; childhood included attendance in Huttig&#x27;s segregated public schools, where she learned firsthand the poor conditions to which black students were exposed. Orlee Smith died when Bates was a teenager, leaving her with her mother. Bates deeply appreciated her father, leading to her own assumption that she married her husband because he shared similar qualities with her father. Bates had great adulation for the man where she couldn&#x27;t &quot;remember a time when this man I called my father didn&#x27;t talk to me almost as if I were an adult&quot;. In contrast to their relationship, Daisy had an austere relationship with her mother. Susie Smith would punish Daisy, who was &quot;often clobbered, tamed, switched, and made to stand in the corner&quot;. Even after the death of Orlee Smith, the two had a falling out.

Daisy was 17 when she started dating Lucius Christopher Bates, an insurance salesman who had also worked on newspapers in the South and West. Daisy was only 15 years old when they first met, and Lucius was still married to Kassandra Crawford. Lucius divorced his first wife in 1941 before moving to Little Rock and starting the &quot;Arkansas State Press&quot;. Daisy and L.C. Bates married on March 4, 1942.

In 1952, Daisy Bates was elected president of the Arkansas Conference of NAACP branches.

==&quot;Arkansas State Press&quot;==
After their move to Little Rock, the Bateses decided to act on a dream of theirs, the ownership of a newspaper. They leased a printing plant that belonged to a church publication and inaugurated the &quot;Arkansas State Press&quot;, a weekly statewide newspaper. The first issue appeared on May 9, 1941.

The &quot;Arkansas State Press&quot; was primarily concerned with advocacy journalism and was modeled off other African-American publications of the era, such as the &quot;Chicago Defender&quot; and &quot;The Crisis&quot;. Stories about civil rights often ran on the front page with the rest of the paper mainly filled with other stories that spotlighted achievements of black Arkansans. Pictures were also in abundance throughout the paper.

The paper became an avid voice for civil rights even before a nationally recognized movement had emerged. Daisy Bates was later recognized as co-publisher of the paper.

As the former president of the Arkansas State Conference of the NAACP, Bates was involved deeply in desegregated events. Even though in 1954 the United States Supreme Court decision in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; made all the segregated schools illegal, the schools in Arkansas refused to enroll African American students. Bates and her husband tried to fight against the situation in their newspaper. The &quot;Arkansas State Press&quot; became a fervent supporter of the NAACP&#x27;s integrated public school events. The &quot;State Press&quot; editorialized, &quot;We feel that the proper approach would be for the leaders among the Negro race—not clabber mouths, Uncle Toms, or grinning appeasers to get together and counsel with the school heads.&quot; Concerning the policy of academic desegregation, the &quot;State Press&quot; cultivated a spirit of immediatism within the hearts of African-American and white citizens. Opposite to gradual approach, this newspaper mainly wanted immediate reform in Arkansas&#x27;s educational system. The &quot;Arkansas State Press&quot; reported that the NAACP was the lead organizer in these protest events, and the newspaper also tended to enlarge national influence to let more people get involved in the educational events in Little Rock.

While Governor Orval Faubus and his supporters were refusing even token desegregation of Central High School, this editorial appeared on the front page:

Throughout its existence, the &quot;Arkansas State Press&quot; covered all social news happening within the state. It was an avid supporter of racial integration in schools and thoroughly publicized its support in its pages. In 1957, because of its strong position during the Little Rock Segregation Crisis, white advertisers held another boycott to punish the newspaper for supporting desegregation. This boycott successfully cut off funding, except the money which came directly and through advertisements from the NAACP national office, and through ads from supporters throughout the country. Despite this the &quot;State Press&quot; was unable to maintain itself and the last issue was published on October 29, 1959.

==Involvement with NAACP==

Daisy Bates immediately joined the local branch of the NAACP upon moving to Little Rock. In an interview she explains her history with the organization and that all her &quot;dreams were tied with this organization&quot;. Her father was a member of the NAACP many years before and she recounts asking him why he joined the organization. She said her father would bring her back literature to read and after learning of their goals she decided to dedicate herself, too.

In the same interview when asked what she and the organization were focused on changing, Bates responded &quot;the whole darned system&quot;. However, it was after the &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; decision that she began to focus mostly on education.

Bates became president of The Arkansas Conference of Branches in 1952 at the age of 38. She remained active and was on the National Board of the NAACP until 1970. Due to her position in NAACP, Bates&#x27; personal life was threatened much of the time. In her autobiography, Bates discussed her life as a president of the NAACP in Arkansas:

==Little Rock Integration Crisis==

Bates and her husband were important figures in the African-American community in the capital city of Little Rock. They published a local black newspaper, the &quot;Arkansas State Press&quot;, which publicized violations of the Supreme Court&#x27;s desegregation rulings.

The plan for desegregating the schools of Little Rock was to be implemented in three phases, starting first with the senior and junior high schools, and then only after the successful integration of senior and junior schools would the elementary schools be integrated. After two years and still no progress, a suit was filed against the Little Rock School District in 1956. The court ordered the school board to integrate the schools as of September 1957. &quot;The battle for the soul of Little Rock had indeed begun, and Bates entered vigorously.&quot;

Realizing her intense involvement and dedication to education and school integration, Daisy was the chosen agent. After the nine black students were selected to attend Central High, Mrs. Bates would be with them every step of the way.

As the leader of the NAACP branch in Arkansas, Bates guided and advised the nine students, known as the Little Rock Nine, when they attempted to enroll in 1957 at Little Rock Central High School, a previously all-white institution. The students&#x27; attempts to enroll provoked a confrontation with Governor Orval Faubus, who called out the National Guard to prevent their entry. The guard only let the white students to pass the school gate. Eight students out of the nine were asked to go back home. One student, Elizabeth Eckford, didn&#x27;t receive the message from Daisy Bates the previous night and was met by a white mob outside the school as she tried to find the other eight students in that morning. The mob threatened to kill the black students; members of the mob harassed not only activists but also Northern journalists who came to cover the story.

Bates used her organizational skills to plan a way for the nine students to get into Central High. She planned for ministers to escort the children into the school, two in front of the children and two behind. She thought that not only would they help protect the children physically but having ministers accompany them would &quot;serve as powerful symbols against the bulwark of segregation&quot;. Bates continued with her task of helping the nine enroll in school. She spoke with their parents several times throughout the day to make sure they knew what was going on. She joined the parent-teacher organization, even though she did not have a student enrolled in school. She was persistent and realized that she needed to dominate the situation in order to succeed.

Bates was a pivotal figure in that seminal moment of the Civil Rights Movement. Osro Cobb, the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Arkansas refers in his memoirs to her, accordingly:

Nevertheless, the pandemonium at Central High School caused superintendent Virgil Blossom to dismiss school that first day of desegregation, and the crowds dispersed. U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower intervened by federalizing the Arkansas National Guard and dispatching the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock to ensure that the court orders were enforced. The troops maintained order, and desegregation proceeded. In the 1958–59 school year, however, public schools in Little Rock were closed in another attempt to roll back desegregation. That period is known as &quot;The Lost Year&quot; in Arkansas.

A significant role of Bates during the Civil Rights Movement was the advocating and mentoring of the Little Rock Nine. Bates&#x27; house became a National Historic Landmark in 2002 because of her role during the desegregation of schools. Her house served as a haven for The Little Rock Nine. The planning of how desegregation would be carried out and the goals to implement were an important part of her role during the movement and specifically, the house was a way to help achieve advocacy for civil rights. Her house also was an official drop off and pick up place for the Little Rock Nine before and after school, every day. Because her house was an official meeting place, it became a center for violence and was often damaged by segregation supporters.

In 1998, a spokeswoman for Bates stated that Bates had felt guilty for her failure to notify one of the young ladies, Elizabeth Eckford, that they were delaying the entrance into Central High School. The family of the child had no telephone, and the father did not return from work until 3 a.m. Eckford didn&#x27;t know that she needed her parents to accompany her, and she also didn&#x27;t know that she needed to gather with other black students that morning. As a result, Eckford met a mob by herself, when a kind reporter, Grace Lorch, took her out of the mob and guided her to the bus station. The previous night, Bates fell asleep before she was able to deliver the message to the family, and the girl attempted to attend her first day alone at the segregated school. Bates not only wanted the black students to receive the same level of education as white students, but she also wanted to make it her job for all races to have the same quality of education.

The Little Rock City Council instructed the Little Rock police chief to arrest Bates and other NAACP figures; she and the local branch president surrendered voluntarily. They were charged with failing to provide information about NAACP members for the public record, in violation of a city ordinance. Though Bates was charged a fine by the judge, the NAACP lawyers appealed and eventually won a reversal in the United States Supreme Court. In a similar case, the high court held that the state of Alabama could not compel the NAACP to turn over its membership list to state officials.

In an interview with Bates, she says the most important contribution she made during the Little Rock crisis was:

Martin Luther King Jr. sent a telegram in September 1957 regarding the Central High School and Little Rock Nine crisis. King&#x27;s purpose was to encourage Bates to &quot;adhere rigorously to a way of non-violence&quot;, despite being &quot;terrorized, stoned, and threatened by ruthless mobs&quot;. He assured her, &quot;World opinion is with you. The moral conscience of millions of white Americans is with you.&quot; King was a guest of the Bateses in May 1958 when he spoke at the Arkansas AM&amp;N College commencement. Soon after the commencement, King asked Daisy Bates to be the Women&#x27;s Day speaker at Dexter Avenue Baptist Church later that year in October. The same year that she was elected to be a speaker at the Baptist church, she was also elected to the executive committee of King&#x27;s Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).

The Bateses&#x27; involvement in the Little Rock Crisis resulted in the loss of advertising revenue to their newspaper, and it was forced to close in 1959. In 1960, Daisy Bates moved to New York City and wrote her memoir, &quot;The Long Shadow of Little Rock&quot;, which won a 1988 National Book Award.

This Crisis showed the influence of the local organizations, and Bates&#x27; action worked because the government started to have a reaction towards the organization like NAACP. After the Little Rock Nine crisis in Arkansas, the city enacted ordinances that all organizations should disclose their membership lists, such as the NAACP. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Civil Rights in America&quot; records that,

==Later life==
Bates then moved to Washington, D.C., and worked for the Democratic National Committee. She also served in the administration of U.S. President Lyndon Baines Johnson working on anti-poverty programs. In 1965, she had a stroke and returned to Little Rock.

In 1968, she moved to the rural black community of Mitchellville in Desha County, eastern Arkansas. She concentrated on improving the lives of her neighbors by establishing a self-help program which was responsible for new sewer systems, paved streets, a water system, and community center.

Bates revived the &quot;Arkansas State Press&quot; in 1984 after L. C. Bates, her husband, died in 1980. In the same year, Bates also earned the Honorary Doctor of Laws degree, which was awarded by the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville.

In 1986, the University of Arkansas Press republished &quot;The Long Shadow of Little Rock&quot;, which became the first reprinted edition ever to earn an American Book Award. The former First lady Eleanor Roosevelt wrote the introduction for Bates&#x27; autobiography. The following year she sold the newspaper, but continued to act as a consultant. Little Rock paid perhaps the ultimate tribute, not only to Bates but to the new era she helped initiate, by opening Daisy Bates Elementary School and by making the third Monday in February George Washington&#x27;s Birthday and Daisy Gatson Bates Day an official state holiday.

Bates died following a series of strokes, in Little Rock on November 4, 1999, at age 84.

Filmmaker Sharon La Cruise produced and directed a documentary film about Bates. &quot;Daisy Bates: First Lady of Little Rock&quot; premiered on February 2, 2012, as part of the Independent Lens series on PBS.

In May 2014, Rutgers University awarded John Lewis Adams a Ph.D. in history for his dissertation, &quot;Time For a Showdown&quot;, a biography chronicling the rise of Bates and her husband and their influence on Black activism in the 1950s.

In May 2024, a statue depicting Bates was placed inside the U.S. Capitol&#x27;s National Statuary Hall Collection as one of two statues in the hall to represent Arkansas.

=== Memoir ===
Bates&#x27;s memoir, &quot;The Long Shadow of Little Rock: A Memoir&quot;, published in 1962, chronicles her experiences as a civil rights activist during the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas. The book provides a firsthand account of the Little Rock Nine, a group of nine African American students who integrated the school in 1957, and Bates&#x27;s role as their mentor and advocate. It details the intense resistance they faced from segregationists, the political turmoil surrounding the integration crisis, and the toll it took on Bates&#x27;s personal and professional life. Through the book, Bates captures the students&#x27; courage and the event&#x27;s widespread impact on the civil rights movement.

The memoir received widespread critical acclaim for its unflinching depiction of racial injustice and its emphasis on the personal sacrifices made in the struggle for equality. In 1988, over two decades after its initial publication, a reprint edition of &quot;The Long Shadow of Little Rock&quot; was awarded an American Book Award Special Citation for its enduring significance in American history and literature. The book has since been regarded as an essential primary source for understanding the civil rights movement and the complexities of the integration struggle.

<doc id="909255" wikidata="Q166354" url="?curid=909255" title="Raumpatrouille – Die phantastischen Abenteuer des Raumschiffes Orion">
<text>Raumpatrouille – Die phantastischen Abenteuer des Raumschiffes Orion (), also known as Raumpatrouille Orion, and Space Patrol Orion in English, is a West German science fiction television series. Its seven episodes were broadcast by ARD from 17 September 1966. It was the first German science fiction TV series. Being a huge success with several reruns, audience ratings went up to 56%. Over the years, the series acquired a distinct cult status in Germany.

==Premise==
In the series, nations no longer exist and Earth is united. Flying saucers, such as spaceship &quot;Orion&quot;, are flown by humans, whilst the aliens fly fighter jet-like aircraft. The titular ship of the series title, &quot;Spaceship Orion&quot;, (German: &quot;Raumschiff Orion&quot;) is portrayed as being a &quot;fast space cruiser&quot; (German: &quot;Schneller Raumkreuzer&quot;), the newest starship in mankind&#x27;s fleet and the fastest spacecraft ever created by humans.

The show tells the story of Commander Cliff Allister McLane (Dietmar Schönherr), an Earth starship captain and his loyal crew. He is &quot;Orion&quot; commander in the developing war against an alien race called the &quot;Frogs&quot; (so-called also in the German original). He is notoriously defiant towards his superiors.

==Characters==
*Major Cliff Allister McLane (Dietmar Schönherr) is the commander of the Orion and a friend to most of its crewmen. He is a daredevil and hero who does not fight for money or glory, but for peace. He has been a member of Earth&#x27;s space fleet for 15 years and was a soldier in at least one previous large-scale war (in the novels, these adventures of Cliff and his crew were described, too). As a running gag, McLane often has to destroy the spaceship Orion to save Earth, afterwards being awarded command of a better vessel (also named &quot;Orion&quot;). In the TV series it was shown only with the destruction of the Orion VII, though in the novels it went as far as to the Orion X-C.
*Lt. Mario de Monti (Wolfgang Völz) is the computer specialist and gunner (&quot;armament officer&quot;) of the Orion and a good friend of Commander McLane. He is often shown drinking with his friends and he is a womanizer who likes to flirt with young, attractive women (not even Tamara is safe from him, but she turned him down pretty heavily).
*Lt. Atan Shubashi () is the astrogator and star cartographer of the Orion. He is the owner of 264, one of the last 367 poodles that still exist on Earth.
*Lt. Hasso Sigbjörnson (Claus Holm) is the Orion&#x27;s engineer. He likes to drink and is the only crewmember who is married (his wife is named Ingrid and he always promises her to retire from active duty). He is an old friend of Commander McLane who usually helps him to explain to Ingrid why he can&#x27;t retire after all.
*Lt. Helga Legrelle (Ursula Lillig) is the surveillance and communication officer of the Orion. Like the other members of the crew, she dislikes Tamara Jagellovsk and feels monitored by her. Like Jagellovsk, Legrelle has a secret crush on Commander McLane and reacts very jealously whenever she notices Jagellovsk paying too much attention to him.
*Lt. Tamara Jagellovsk (Eva Pflug) is a member of the GSD (&quot;Galaktischer Sicherheitsdienst&quot;, German for &quot;Galactic Security Service&quot;, the military intelligence service) who has been given the task of keeping McLane under control. Tamara likes McLane, however, and is very amused by his sense of humour. The Crew at first strongly dislike her, but with time they develop a feeling of mutual respect. Tamara can issue &quot;Alpha Orders&quot; which are orders of highest priority that have to be obeyed by McLane at all cost.
*Frogs are a highly advanced and very intelligent, energy-like race of extraterrestrial conquerors who are attempting to destroy Earth&#x27;s space fleet and eliminate mankind. They have extremely fast starships and powerful energy-weapons. Some of their technological abilities are superior to Earth&#x27;s, but oxygen is poisonous to them. In the novels, it is finally revealed what they called themselves: Uraceel.
*General Winston Woodrow Wamsler (Benno Sterzenbach) is McLane&#x27;s commanding officer while McLane is demoted to 3 years of space patrol duty at the TRAV (&quot;Terrestrische Raumaufklärungsverbände&quot;, &quot;Terran Space Reconnaissance Division&quot;).
*General Lydia van Dyke (Charlotte Kerr) was Cliff&#x27;s original commanding officer when McLane was still at the &quot;Schnelle Kampfverbände&quot; (&quot;Fast Battle Cruiser Division&quot;) and she expected him &quot;not to resign like a sulking space cadet&quot; when he was demoted, but to return to her fleet after his 3 years of patrol duty. She is also the commanding officer of the space ship Hydra.
*Oberst (= Colonel) Hendryk Villa (Friedrich Joloff) is the head of the GSD (&quot;Galaktischer Sicherheitsdienst&quot;, &quot;Galactic Security Service&quot;) and thus the boss of Lt. Tamara Jagellovsk.
*Lt. Michael Spring-Brauner (Thomas Reiner) is the adjutant of Gen. Wamsler and has a strong dislike towards McLane and his crew (which is mutual). He is a stuck-up bureaucrat and tries to make McLane&#x27;s life as miserable as he can.
*Space Marshal Kublai Krim (Hans Cossy) is the commanding officer of the Earth Space Forces (Kommandeur der Raumstreitkräfte).
*Sir Arthur (Franz Schafheitlin) is the head of the Earth Space Forces (Oberbefehlshaber der Raumstreitkräfte).
*von Wennerstein (Emil Stöhr) is a representative of the Earth government.

==Fictional technology in Space Patrol==
*Astrodisc (German &quot;Astroscheibe&quot;) is a viewing screen that can produce holographic images of space. It has the same function as the bridge screen of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; in &quot;Star Trek&quot;. The astrodisc stands in the middle of the Orion&#x27;s bridge.
*Light-thrower batteries (German &quot;Lichtwerferbatterie&quot;) are the weapons most frequently used by Earth&#x27;s space fleet and the ships of the Frogs. These weapons appear in many different sizes, ranging from hand lasers to planet destruction-cannons. Orion was the first German production to feature the English word &quot;laser&quot;.
*Antimatter bombs are bombs containing antimatter and were used in the attempt to destroy the &quot;Supernova&quot; in the 2nd episode (&quot;Planet außer Kurs&quot;, Planet off Course).
*Overkill is a new weapon that was introduced in the 4th episode (&quot;Deserteure&quot;), and that was installed on the Orion as the first Earth space ship. It seems to be a disintegrator-style weapon that is able to cause enormous craters hundreds of kilometres wide and even obliterate whole planets.
*ASG wrist communication devices (in German: &quot;Armbandsprechgerät&quot;) are part of the technology of Earth&#x27;s space fleet. They are compact com devices that are worn around the wrists.
*Robots (German &quot;Roboter&quot;) are helpers, guards and even housekeepers in the world of tomorrow. Their use is shown to be problematic, because they are depicted as suffering from frequent malfunctions, making them dangerous to human beings (especially if they are battle robots). They first appear in the series in episode 3 &quot;Keepers of the Law&quot; as saucer-shaped mining machines quasi-levitating on one bow-leg. They are constrained by Isaac Asimov&#x27;s Three Laws of Robotics, about which a lecture is given at the beginning of the episode. Later they appear as androids and floating battle robots. Some of the humanoid robots are very similar in design to the modern, Vietnamese robot TOPIO.
*Deep sea bases (German &quot;Tiefseebasis&quot;) are giant cities located under water. They are modern, beautiful and have big windows to allow the people to see fish and other underwater life forms. The Orion usually starts and lands at Basis 104 which is located in the Gulf of Carpentaria, Australia.
*Faster-than-light engine (German &quot;Überlichtantrieb&quot;) is the main drive that allows the crew to traverse the universe at speeds faster than light. The Frogs use a similar but superior technology, with the result that their spacecraft can out-pace the ships of the Space Patrol.
*Magnet shield (German &quot;Magnetschild&quot;) is a protective shield which is used by the Frogs. The Shield appears as a powerful energy-bowl that encircles the starship.

==Special effects and set decoration==
Many of the special effects seen in the black-and-white series, like the underwater casino and space port, were created by means of the Schüfftan process.

As the series&#x27; budget was comparatively low, the set designers resorted to using modified common everyday objects; for instance, electric irons, upside-down clock pendulums, washing-machine console parts, and designer pencil sharpeners were used as props control panels, sewing thread coils and banana plugs as futuristic machine parts, and plastic cups as ceiling lights. Many panels were produced by the then-newly invented thermoforming process. Much designer furniture was also used, notably Ludwig Mies van der Rohe&#x27;s &quot;258&quot;-type couch, Harry Bertoia&#x27;s &quot;Diamond&quot;-type armchair, Yrjö Kukkapuro&#x27;s &quot;Karuselli&quot;-type armchair,
Charles Eames&#x27;s &quot;Aluminium group #EA105&quot; chair, George Nelson&#x27;s &quot;DAF Chair&quot; and Eero Saarinen&#x27;s &quot;Tulpe&quot; table/chair combo. Joe Colombo&#x27;s famous &quot;Smoke&quot;-type drinking glasses were used throughout the series.

&quot;Orion&quot;&#x27;s cockpit was a 2.50m high, 10m wide interior set, built within a 28m exterior diameter sound stage. It stood on a 60 cm high metal tube construction to hide the 10,000m cable harness that connected its 3,200 flashing light bulbs to a 40 kg, electric motor-driven pinned-barrel mechanical sequencer.

The stage designer was Rolf Zehetbauer, who later won an Academy Award for his work on &quot;Cabaret&quot;.

&quot;We had no money available and yet we were instructed to produce an elaborate science-fiction series. We were forced to improvise in all aspects. This ruled out completely manufacturing the spaceship&#x27;s equipment from scratch. So we used existing things that we could adapt,&quot; is how Zehetbauer described the design work of the set.

==Production==
Rumours about the considerable costs of the series having led to its termination after only seven episodes were denied by the widow of the &quot;Orion&quot;&#x27;s original screenwriter, implying that it was planned from the start to have only seven installments. More episode screenplays were written than were filmed. No official reason was given for not producing a second series of episodes, but there are several reasons that were aired in interviews many years later by those involved in the production. According to Hans Gottschalk, one of the executive producers, there was a &quot;lack of exciting script ideas&quot; at the time. Helmut Jedele, then boss of Bavaria Film, the production company, mentioned in hindsight that the company had already undertaken too much for its resources, both in terms of staff and finance.

Another factor in planning for a second series would have been filming in colour instead of black-and-white. While this would have been required for a successful international marketing of an extension, the West German production companies were not yet prepared for the necessary investment for the new equipment.

West German television started to transmit in colour (PAL) a year later in 1967, but that was a slow gradual switch-over process from black-and-white over a course of several years, until the 1970s.

Yet another impediment might have been that the controllers in charge at the state television channel ARD feared accusations of an excess of &quot;militarism&quot; and a portrayal of a system &quot;akin to fascism&quot;. While this might seem far-fetched for foreigners, this issue was and is very sensitive in Germany with regards to the past history of the country, and executive producer Helmut Krapp admitted that the issue was considered and taken seriously.

==Co-production with French ORTF Television==

Originally WDR, headquartered in Cologne, the largest regional broadcasting channel within the ARD public TV consortium, was the sole commissioning producer on behalf of ARD group and in that position to provide complete production funding. However, the planned budget of up to 360,000 DM for each episode was considered too high by the WDR controllers. Bavaria Film chief Helmut Jedele looked for a co-producer to share some of the cost and came to an agreement with French national state TV channel ORTF. They contributed about 20% to production funding and some scenes, notably in episode 5, were re-shot for the French audience using French actors. In France the title of the series was &quot;Commando spatial - Les aventures fantastiques du vaisseau Orion&quot;.

==Novelizations==
145 novels based on and continuing the series were published over the years, often with settings which were considerably different from those seen in the series.

==Feature film==
A movie composed of various scenes from the original series, together with some new footage, debuted in 2003 but did not match the success of the original series. As described by Dietmar Schönherr in an interview, the series had tried to deal with serious issues, a fact appreciated by many of its viewers. The movie&#x27;s producers tried to replicate the series in trash culture style, however, thereby alienating much of the original fan base. The title of the movie was &quot;Raumpatrouille Orion – Rücksturz ins Kino&quot;. The storyline was about the invasion and attacks of the Frogs, the term now becoming an acronym for &quot;Feindliche Raumverbände ohne galaktische Seriennummer&quot; (roughly &quot;Hostile Space Combat Units Without Galactic Serial Identification Number&quot;). This description appears for the first time in the film and contradicts the series, where Atan Shubashi and Hasso Sigbjörnson, who were the first humans to see the Frogs, called them &quot;Frösche&quot; (German for &quot;frogs&quot;) first, but later switched to the English translation because &quot;Frösche&quot; sounded too familiar to describe the aliens.

==Soundtrack and introduction==

The emblematic soundtrack was composed by Peter Thomas.

The voice-over introduction (similar to that used in &quot;Star Trek&quot; the same year), set both tone and atmosphere of the series.

Voice-over introduction in German:

:&quot;Was heute noch wie ein Märchen klingt, kann morgen Wirklichkeit sein. Hier ist ein Märchen von Übermorgen: es gibt keine Nationalstaaten mehr. Es gibt nur noch die Menschheit und ihre Kolonien im Weltraum. Man siedelt auf fernen Sternen. Der Meeresboden ist als Wohnraum erschlossen. Mit heute noch unvorstellbaren Geschwindigkeiten durcheilen Raumschiffe unser Milchstraßensystem. Eins dieser Raumschiffe ist die ORION, winziger Teil eines gigantischen Sicherheitssystems, das die Erde vor Bedrohungen aus dem All schützt. Begleiten wir die ORION und ihre Besatzung bei ihrem Patrouillendienst am Rande der Unendlichkeit.&quot;

English translation:

:&quot;What may sound like a fairy tale today may be tomorrow&#x27;s reality. This is a fairy tale from the day after tomorrow: There are no more nations. There is only mankind and its colonies in space. People have settled on faraway stars. The ocean floor has been made habitable. At speed still unimaginable today, space vessels are rushing through our Milky Way. One of these vessels is the ORION, a minuscule part of a gigantic security system protecting the Earth from threats from outer space. Let&#x27;s accompany the ORION and her crew on their patrol at the edge of infinity.&quot;

<doc id="909270" wikidata="Q4691988" url="?curid=909270" title="Agency in Mormonism">
<text>Agency (also referred to as moral agency), in the theology of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), is &quot;the privilege of choice which was introduced by God the Eternal Father to all of his spirit children in the premortal state&quot;. Mortal life is viewed as a test of faith, where our choices are central to the plan of salvation in Latter-day Saint teaching. &quot;It was essential for their eternal progression that they be subjected to the influences of both good and evil&quot;. LDS Church members believe that Lucifer rebelled against the God&#x27;s plan, which resulted in a war in heaven, and Lucifer being cast out of heaven and becoming Satan.

Church members believe that all individuals have the ability to differentiate between good and evil and that Satan and his followers are not able to tempt people beyond the point where they can resist. This implies that mortals can be held accountable for their actions; mortals will be judged by God based on a combination of one&#x27;s faith and works (with salvation coming only through the power, mercy, and grace of Jesus Christ).

==Pre-Earth life==

A major difference between the beliefs of the LDS Church and many other Christians involves the belief of a life before mortality, referred to as the pre-Earth life, pre-mortal life, or pre-existence. Latter-day Saints believe that before the Earth was created, all mankind lived as spirit children of God. Here, God nurtured, taught and provided means for their development. This preparation would allow them to later become the men and women of Earth, to be further educated and tested in the schoolhouse of mortality in order to return to God&#x27;s presence and become like him. Thus, the pre-existent life is believed to have been a period of unknown length of progression, and schooling. Church members believe that there came a time when we could not progress further without being born into a body and experiencing earthly life.

According to LDS Church doctrine, God proposed a plan whereby further progression could take place, a plan of salvation. Since agency would allow all people to fall in sin, a savior was necessary to atone for the sins of each person so that they could return to live with God. Jehovah (the pre-mortal Jesus) volunteered to follow the plan as outlined, which preserved agency, accountability for action, and the necessary result that some of God&#x27;s children would never to return to heaven as a consequence of sin. The second volunteer, Lucifer, attempted to amend the plan by proposing that all mankind would return to God despite their sins—essentially defeating agency and the divine principle of accountability for action. God the Father chose to send Jehovah as the Savior to fulfill his plan. Lucifer and his followers rebelled against this plan and were eventually cast out of heaven. Lucifer became Satan.

===Foreordination===
LDS Church members believe that agency was given to all of God&#x27;s spirit children during the pre-mortal life. Some of the spirit children of God exercised their agency and chose to follow God&#x27;s law and became &quot;noble and great.&quot; This doctrine is called &quot;foreordination&quot;. God foreordained some of these spirits to particular stations in life in order to advance His plan to lead humanity back to His presence.

Latter-day Saints believe that these foreordinations were not unalterable decrees, but rather callings from God for man to perform specific missions in mortality. Even these who were foreordained for greatness could fall and transgress the laws of God. Therefore, mortality is simply a state wherein progression and testing is continued from what began in the pre-mortal life.

Church doctrine states that God&#x27;s plan includes the foreordination of prophets and teachers who have gifts and callings to teach and re-teach correct principles so that agency can be used wisely. God&#x27;s plan includes the important role of parents to teach their children the path of righteousness and happiness, and the blessing of the holy scriptures to give a foundation of gospel knowledge, including the knowledge of the saving role of Jesus Christ and the importance of ordinances and covenants of the gospel.

==Earth life==
In essence, agency is the ability to make choices for oneself, as well as the ability to learn the difference between right and wrong and to make ethical and moral decisions.

David O. McKay, a church president, stated, &quot;It is the purpose of the Lord that man become like Him. In order for man to achieve this it was necessary for the Creator first to make him free.&quot; Without agency, mortality would be useless. People are ultimately responsible for their own destiny, through their faith and obedience to the commandments of God. &quot;Agency&quot; therefore should not be interpreted to mean that actions are without consequences; agency is a gift from God and consequences must necessarily come as a result of choices made. Agency and accountability are complementary and cannot be separated.

This principle holds that it is wrong to compel someone to use his or her agency in a certain way unless they have abused it - especially to infringe against the agency of another - as it would prevent a person from enacting their own choices. Such offenses logically include, but are not limited to, crimes such as murder, rape, and slavery. Furthermore, a person who prevents an individual from doing what they have been commanded to do or forces them to do something that is wrong will likewise be held responsible for any offense.

Throughout the 20th century, church leaders often equated governments led by dictatorships as being under the influence and control of Satan. For example, apostle Ezra Taft Benson often spoke of evil communist or socialist dictatorships that threatened mankind: &quot;it is realized that communism is turning out to be the earthly image of the plan which Satan presented in the preexistence. The whole program of socialistic communism is essentially a war against God and the plan of salvation—the very plan which we fought to uphold during the war in heaven.&quot; Other 
leaders clarified these statements, often pointing to the church&#x27;s belief in the &quot;Law of Consecration&quot; which is a form of non-dictatorial socialism practiced by early church members in which all property was held in common and distributed by church leaders based on the needs of each individual. The Church is officially politically neutral and today church members around the world subscribe to a variety of political beliefs, including communism and socialism.

LDS doctrine teaches that many men and women since the beginning of mortal time have used their agency unwisely, limiting their own progress and their opportunity to receive light and knowledge. Beginning with Cain, some have used their agency to inflict harm, abuse, tyranny, slavery, or death upon others, contrary to the will and commandments of God.

The fact that God allows these actions does not mean that He condones them. LDS doctrine holds that agency is an eternal principle, and that God has provided the way through the atonement of Jesus Christ whereby men and women can repent of their wrongful acts of commission or of omission, and come back into the path of receiving further light and knowledge through making right choices. The atonement of Christ and the plan of compassion among men also provides a way whereby those who have been harmed by the sinful actions of others may be healed in a spiritual sense, although this may take great patience and long-suffering, and often requires the help of others.

The Pearl of Great Price, one of the scriptures of the LDS Church, states that Satan, the great deceiver, sought during premortal life to destroy the agency of man, and that he continues to seek to enslave men, women, and children in whatever ways that he can in this world, to &quot;lead them captive at his will.&quot; LDS doctrine teaches that whatever leads in this world to enslavement, addiction, or forced unrighteous behavior is ultimately instigated by Satan. God allows these conditions because of the agency He has given to man, but He expects men to overcome evil by doing good among the society in which they live. God holds men and women responsible and accountable in relation to the light and knowledge they have. Every person born into the world is given the light of Christ, also called conscience, to guide each person in choosing good from evil.

LDS doctrine also holds that whenever gospel knowledge has been lost or limited among portions of mankind, this has come about because of the unrighteousness of the people and their leaders, as described by the prophet Isaiah in the Bible.

LDS leaders teach that family and societal relationships are a part of mortal life for many purposes, including the need to learn to show love, acceptance, and compassion in ways that continue to allow agency. They teach that unrighteous dominion is never acceptable to God, and that with the agency given to men is the expectation that when they marry, they will treat their wife and children with love, respect, tenderness, and material and emotional support. LDS leaders teach that men should treat women as equal partners in all decisions in the family.

===&quot;Free&quot; agency===
The term “free agency” is commonly used, and has traditionally been interpreted as meaning that individuals have the ability to choose their actions freely. Many leaders of the LDS Church have pointed out that the term &quot;free agency&quot; is technically incorrect, and regardless, should not be interpreted to mean that agency does not have consequences, but rather that agency is fraught with risk and choices (the result of the exercise of agency) that determine eternal destination. Consequently, current church manuals avoid the term &quot;free agency&quot; and instead refer simply to &quot;agency.&quot; Some church leaders favor the term &quot;moral agency&quot;.

A reference to &quot;free agency&quot; found in the 1886 Revelation has been noted by some Mormon fundamentalists such as Joseph Lyman Jessop, Joseph W. Musser, and Anne Wilde, in order to back up their opposition to arranged marriages in a fundamentalist Mormon context, particularly in response to the so-called placement marriages of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.

===Adam and Eve===

It is said that Adam and Eve were the first of God&#x27;s children to come to Earth. They were created in God&#x27;s image, with bodies of flesh and bones. God placed them in the Garden of Eden. Here they did not remember their former existence, although they were still able to enjoy God&#x27;s presence and could have lived forever.

As it is believed the God the Father has blessed all of His children with the ability to choose, Adam and Eve were given agency to make their own choices on the earth. God commanded them not to eat the forbidden fruit, or the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, warning that such would result in certain death. Obeying this commandment meant they could remain in the garden forever, but they could not progress by experiencing opposition in mortality and would remain innocent; they could not know joy because they could not experience sorrow and pain. Thus, as a part of the plan, Satan was allowed to tempt Adam and Eve to eat the forbidden fruit and they chose to do so. As a consequence, they were separated from God&#x27;s presence physically and spiritually. Adam and Eve then became mortal; subject to sin and death, and were unable to return to Heavenly Father without his help. They could now experience disease and all types of suffering. They had moral agency, or the ability to choose between good and evil, which made it possible for them to learn and progress. It also made it possible for them to make wrong choices and to sin. In addition, they could now have children, so the rest of God&#x27;s spirit children could come to Earth, obtain physical bodies, and be proven, which was in accordance with the plan of God. Only in this way could God&#x27;s children progress and become like Him.

<text>Charles Wrey Gardiner (1901 – 13 March 1981) was an English writer and poet, editor and publisher, born in Plymouth.

Gardiner was a noted and well-connected literary figure, particularly in London in the years around Second World War, though very much in the tradition of the literary amateur.

==Personal life==

Gardiner read History at Exeter College, Oxford, but left without taking a degree after marrying his cousin, Betty. The couple then toured the West Country in a caravan. After divorce, Gardiner moved to Paris, where he married his second wife, Susanne, a pianist. After the Second World War he married and had at least one child with Cynthia Kortright. His fourth wife, Diana, was the widow of the Fitzrovian writer Julian MacLaren-Ross.

==Publishing==
His significance in publishing came with his editorship of the magazine &quot;Poetry Quarterly&quot;. He became its assistant editor in 1939, with its first edition published in Spring 1940 and continuing until 1953.

Towards the end of 1940 he established the Grey Walls Press, in Billericay, Essex. &quot;Lyra: An anthology of new lyric&quot; (1942), edited by Alex Comfort and Robert Greacen, was a representative poetry anthology published by Grey Walls, containing new writing of the time. Gardiner is also notable as a supporter of Kenneth Patchen, whose &quot;Outlaw of the Lowest Planet&quot; he published in 1946, with an introduction by David Gascoyne and a preface by Alex Comfort.

Grey Walls subsequently merged with Falcon Press, the publishing company run by Peter Baker MP. Initially, this gave the company new capital but it later involved Grey Walls in Baker&#x27;s bankruptcy. He was imprisoned for fraud and the Press went out of business.

As a writer and poet, his works include his poetry as well as four published (and one unpublished - &quot;The Octopus of Love&quot;) autobiographies.

==&quot;New Road&quot;==
&quot;New Road. New Directions in Art &amp; Writing&quot; was a series of anthologies published by Grey Walls Press, the first two of which were edited by Alex Comfort and John Bayliss. These are:

* Volume 1 (1943) - Edited by Alex Comfort and John Bayliss - including a special 50-page &quot;surrealist section&quot;
* Volume 2 (1944) - Edited by Alex Comfort and John Bayliss
* Volume 3 (1945) - Edited by Fred Marnau
* Volume 4 (1946) - Edited by Fred Marnau
* Volume 5 (1949) - Edited by Charles Wrey Gardiner

<text>3HO (Healthy, Happy, Holy Organization), also known as Sikh Dharma of the Western Hemisphere or Sikh Dharma International, is a controversial American organization founded in 1969 by Harbhajan Singh Khalsa, also called &quot;Yogi Bhajan&quot;. Its adherents are popularly referred to as the Sikh Dharma Brotherhood. While referred to as the 3HO movement, &quot;3HO&quot; is strictly speaking the name only of the movement&#x27;s educational branch. Scholars have defined 3HO as a new religious movement.

==Practices==

The 3HO movement is known for including some practices found in certain Dharmic traditions such as meditation, vegetarianism and yoga, particularly Kundalini yoga. 3HO also believes openness to yoga and spiritual ideas as a source of strength. Both men and women wear turbans and often wear white clothes.

3HO requires its members to follow a strict lacto-vegetarian diet. The use of alcohol, recreational drugs and tobacco is forbidden.

==Criticism==
Despite 3HO claiming to practice Sikh teachings and values, the organization is largely condemned by the wider Sikh community, with some going as far as to refer to it as a cult.

===Condemnation by SGPC and Akal Takht===
In 1977, Gurucharan Singh Tohra, former President of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), stated that Harbhajan Singh was not the leader of Sikhism in the Western World as he claimed and denied Singh&#x27;s claim that the SGPC had given him the title of Siri Singh Sahib.

Sikh High Priest Jaswant Singh stated that he and his council professed to be &quot;shocked&quot; at Bhajan&#x27;s &quot;fantastic theories.&quot; Yoga, Tantrism, and the &quot;sexual practices&quot; taught by Bhajan, the council declared, are &quot;forbidden and immoral.&quot;

===Sexual abuse allegations===
After the release of a memoir in early 2020, several victims filed a civil lawsuit in Los Angeles against 3HO. They claimed that Bhajan not only abused them but that members of 3HO were also aware of the abuse. As a result, An Olive Branch, a consultancy specializing in addressing misconduct in spiritual communities, conducted an investigation. Their conclusive report confirmed the likelihood of the allegations being true.

In 2019, Yogi Bhajan&#x27;s former secretary Pamela Saharah Dyson published the book &quot;Premka: White Bird in a Golden Cage: My Life with Yogi Bhajan&quot;, reporting that she and other women had sexual relationships with Harbhajan Singh.
In March 2020, anti-cult activist Be Scofield published an article in her magazine &quot;The Guru&quot; reporting sexual abuse and rape of female followers and assistants including Dyson by Harbhajan Singh, based on &quot;over a dozen original interviews&quot;.

=== Scholars&#x27; views on 3HO and Yogi Bhajan ===
Scholars including Verne A. Dusenbery and Pashaura Singh have concurred that Harbhajan Singh&#x27;s introduction of Sikh teachings into the West helped identify Sikhism as a world religion while at the same time creating a compelling counter-narrative to that which identified Sikhs solely as a race with a shared history in India.

Sikh historian Trilochan Singh offered a contrasting perspective in his critical work entitled &quot;Sikhism and Tantric Yoga.&quot; &quot;I am extremely worried about the manner in which Yogi Bhajan teaches Sikhism to American young men and women whose sincerity, nobility of purpose, and rare passion for oriental wisdom and genuine mystical experiences is unquestionably unique. I do not care what fantastic interpretations of Kundalini Yoga he gives, the like of which I have never read in any Tantra text, nor known from any living Tantric scholar. I am not prepared to take seriously his newly invented Guru Yoga in which his pious and uncritical followers must concentrate on a particular picture of Yogi Bhajan, which practice is called mental beaming.&quot;

Philip Deslippe, a historian of American religion, wrote a 2012 article, &quot;From Maharaj to Mahan Tantric: The Construction of Yogi Bhajan&#x27;s Kundalini Yoga&quot;, using 3HO source archive material and news articles to reveal how Harbhajan Singh recreated his own story after his first trip back to India:
==Governance and control==

Yogi Bhajan formed Sikh Dharma International as a California nonprofit religious corporation &quot;organized to advance the religion of Sikh Dharma and as an association of religious organizations teaching principles of Sikh Dharma, including by ordination of ministers of divinity and operation of places of worship.&quot; During Yogi Bhajan&#x27;s lifetime, Sikh Dharma International, along with related legal entities Siri Singh Sahib Corporation and Unto Infinity LLC, were held and controlled by Siri Singh Sahib of Sikh Dharma, a California &quot;corporation sole&quot; of which Yogi Bhajan was the only shareholder. Following the Yogi&#x27;s death in 2004, a dispute ensued over the governance of those entities and assets. Yogi Bhajan&#x27;s wife, Bibiji Inderjit Kaur Puri, alleged that she had been appointed to the board of Unto Infinity, and that she and their three children were appointed to the Siri Singh Sahib of Sikh Dharma board of directors (and thus in a position to exert significant control over all of the Sikh Dharma legal entities); but that following Yogi Bhajan&#x27;s death the other board members of those entities improperly prevented them from taking part in governance. In January 2017, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals determined that the lawsuit was not on its face an ecclesiastical dispute. However, in April 2018, Chief Judge Michael Mosman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon dismissed the case. Judge Mosman concluded that there was significant evidence that the 3HO corporate entities were religious in character and thus that the dispute could not be adjudicated in civil court.
==Business ventures==

According to anthropology professor and Sikh diaspora researcher Nicola Mooney, 3HO Sikhs have combined &quot;ethic and capitalism&quot; to their spiritual pursuits, with Sikh Dharma International and its associated corporate entities and directors creating and controlling the Yogi Tea and Akal Security brands with a worldwide presence.

Golden Temple of Oregon, a natural foods company that built the Peace Cereal and Yogi Tea brands, was owned by a corporate entity controlled by Yogi Bhajan, and was estimated to be worth around $100,000,000 at the time of his death. The company was transferred to Kartar Singh Khalsa for $100, sparking lawsuits over improper disposition of the assets. Golden Temple&#x27;s cereal division was sold to Hearthside Food Solutions in May 2010 for $71 million; the executives were later ordered to return more than half of the sale price to a court-appointed receiver. Hearthside was later acquired by Post. Golden Temple was renamed East West Tea Company after that sale.

Another SDI-related company, Akal Security, initially hired 3HO members to guard shops and restaurants. It grew into a $500 million-a-year company with federal contracts to protect numerous government buildings in Washington, DC and elsewhere, including courthouses, airports, and embassies. The founders donated the company to the church in 1980.

Following the death of Yogi Bhajan, control over Golden Temple and Akal Security was contested in a series of lawsuits in Oregon.

=== Popular culture ===
In October 2024, HBO premiered the series Breath of Fire, which talks about the mental and sexual abuse of Yogi Bhajan, and 3HO.

<text>Seán Jennett (12 November 1912 – 1981), also Sean Jennet, was a British typographer, book editor, and author of travel books. He was also a published poet. A copyright registration of 1943 describes as a pseudonym, giving his name as John Clark Jennett, living at Addlestone.

==Life==
Jennett was from Yorkshire. In earlier life he was a typographer for Faber and Faber, who published his &quot;The Making of Books&quot; (1951).

Leaving Faber &amp; Faber, Jennett worked for the Grey Walls Press with Wrey Gardiner. Gardiner wrote later of how Jennett redesigned &quot;Poetry Quarterly&quot; which he was editing in 1943, dealing with printers in the wartime conditions and boosting sales. Jennett consulted with T. S. Eliot and others at the time of the Ern Malley hoax of that year. He contributed to &quot;The Wind and the Rain&quot;, a literary magazine edited by Neville Braybrooke (1923–2001). A reviewer there wrote that &quot;Jennett is at his best in the sonnets and in a five-line stanza of his own&quot;. He gave a talk &quot;Convention and the Modern Book,&quot; on tradition in book design, on the BBC Third Programme in 1947.

Jennett was General Editor of the Crown Classics series published by Grey Walls Press from the later 1940s; it published 36 titles from 1947 to 1954. Roderick Cave commented on the standard of his work in what was a budget series of poetry reprints:

To set poetry effectively, so that the margins appear right whether the lines of the poems be long or short, is a lot harder than for prose. Writers like Morison, Simon, Meynell, Beatrice Wade — or Jennett — have often enough said how it should be done, but not many publishers of cheap series get it quite right. As a poet and as author of &quot;The Making of Books&quot; Jennett was particularly interested in getting this right, and the mise-en-page of most of the Crown Classics is very good.

Jennett redesigned &quot;Time and Tide&quot; magazine in 1952. He used earnings from &quot;The Making of Books&quot; to travel in France. This journey was the beginning of his career as a travel writer. He took two cameras with him, collecting black-and-white and colour photographs as illustration for his writings. He went on to edit The Travellers&#x27; Guides series for Darton, Longman &amp; Todd in the 1960s. After that he published further travel books with Batsford Books, and guides for HMSO. &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Way: from Winchester to Canterbury&quot; (1971) was published by Cassell: the &quot;Esher News and Mail&quot; reported that Jennett, from Woking, had &quot;walked every mile&quot; of the Pilgrim&#x27;s Way.

==Works==

Poetry

* &quot;Always Adam&quot; (1943). &quot;H. L. G.&quot; reviewing it in the &quot;Birmingham Daily Post&quot; wrote that &quot;On the whole, Mr. Jennet is one of the new romantics, but there is plenty of Mr. Auden&#x27;s influence apparent in diction and metre [...]&quot;. 
* &quot;The Cloth of Flesh&quot; (1945)
* &quot;The Sun and Old Stones&quot; (1961)

Jennett was included in &quot;The Crown and the Sickle&quot; (1944), the third anthology associated with the New Apocalyptics movement. In the 1949 anthology &quot;The New British Poets&quot; by Kenneth Rexroth, the editor said in the introduction that his general survey did not apply to Jennett and some others chosen (Laurie Lee, Terence Tiller, Vernon Watkins, Eithne Wilkins). Writing to Derek Savage in 1947, Rexroth commented that Jennett &quot;impresses me the more I see of him&quot;. 

In 1948, an article in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, noting that Maurice Wollman&#x27;s &quot;Poems of the War Years&quot; had name-checked Jennett&#x27;s &quot;Autumn, 1940&quot; in the introduction but not included it, classed Jennett as an Irish poet. Jennett was in &quot;Contemporary Irish Poetry&quot; (1949) edited by Robert Greacen and Valentin Iremonger.

<text>The Continental Association, also known as the Articles of Association or simply the Association, was an agreement among the American colonies adopted by the First Continental Congress in Philadelphia on October 20, 1774. It was a result of the escalating American Revolution and called for a trade boycott against British merchants by the colonies. Congress hoped that placing economic sanctions on British imports and exports would pressure Parliament into addressing the colonies&#x27; grievances, especially repealing the Intolerable Acts, which were strongly opposed by the colonies.

The Congress adopted a &quot;non-importation, non-consumption, non-exportation&quot; agreement as a peaceful means of settling the colonies&#x27; disputes with Great Britain. The agreement, which had been suggested by Virginia delegate Richard Henry Lee based on the 1769 Virginia Association initiated by George Washington and written by George Mason, opened with a pledge of loyalty to King George III of Britain, and went on to outline a series of actions opening with a ban on British imports that would begin December 1, 1774. Trade between the colonies and Britain subsequently fell sharply. The British soon responded with the New England Restraining Act which escalated their own economic sanctions. The outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in April 1775 superseded the need to boycott British goods.

A significant effect of the agreement was that it exhibited the colonies&#x27; collective will to act together in their common interests. Abraham Lincoln, in his first inaugural address in 1861, credited the origin of the union which would become the United States to the adoption of the Continental Association. The Union actually may have begun slightly earlier with the First Continental Congress&#x27;s opening session on September 5, 1774, and from that date on, the colonies acted in accord on a series of agreements leading up to the Congress&#x27;s closing session seven weeks later. One of the last of these agreements, the most visible symbol of political unity among the colonies up to that time, was the adoption of the Continental Association.

==Background==
Parliament passed the Coercive Acts in 1774 to restructure the colonial administration of the Thirteen Colonies and to punish the Province of Massachusetts for the Boston Tea Party. A First Continental Congress was convened at Carpenters&#x27; Hall in Philadelphia on September 5, 1774, to coordinate a response to the Intolerable Acts (also known as the Coercive Acts). Twelve colonies were represented at the First Continental Congress, which included George Washington, John Adams, Samuel Adams, Patrick Henry and future Chief Justice John Jay. Peyton Randolph was unanimously elected as its president, and Charles Thomson elected secretary. A plan of reconciliation was proposed, but was roundly rejected for concern that Parliament would see the proposal as a colonial acknowledgment that it had the right to regulate colonial trade and impose taxes.

Many Americans saw the Coercive Acts as a violation of the British Constitution and a threat to the liberties of all Thirteen Colonies, not just Massachusetts, and they turned to economic boycotts to protest the oppressive legislation, which involved the &quot;non-importation&quot;, &quot;nonexportation&quot;, or &quot;non-consumption&quot; of British goods.

On May 13, 1774, the Boston Town Meeting passed a resolution, with Samuel Adams acting as moderator, which called for an economic boycott in response to the Boston Port Act, one of the Coercive Acts. The resolution said:

That it is the opinion of this town, that if the other, Colonies come, into a &quot;joint&quot; resolution to stop all importation from &quot;Great Britain&quot;, and exportations to &quot;Great Britain&quot;, and every part of the &quot;West Indies&quot;, till the Act for blocking up this harbour be repealed, the same will prove the salvation of &quot;North America&quot; and her liberties. On the other hand, if they continue their exports and imports, there is high reason to fear that fraud, power, and the most odious oppression, will rise triumphant over right, justice, social happiness, and freedom.

Paul Revere often served as messenger, and he carried the Boston resolutions to New York and Philadelphia. Adams also promoted the boycott through existing colonial committees of correspondence, which enabled leaders of each colony to keep in touch.

One of the first actions of the Congress was the endorsement of the Suffolk Resolves, which called for an embargo on British trade and urged each of the colonies to organize militias. The delegates subsequently drew up a Declaration and Resolves that included the Continental Association, which was approved on October 20, 1774. Based on the earlier Virginia Association, the Association signified the growing cooperation between the colonies. Opening with a profession of allegiance to the king, the document then charged Parliament and lower British officials for creating &quot;a ruinous system of colony administration&quot; rather than blaming the king. The Association alleged that this system was &quot;evidently calculated for enslaving these colonies, and, with them, the British Empire.&quot; Twelve colonies joined at once; Georgia joined a year later.

Signed copies of the Articles were sent to the King to present to both houses of Parliament, where they remained for some time mixed in with other letters and documents sent from America.

==Provisions==

The articles of the Continental Association imposed an immediate ban on British tea, and a ban beginning on December 1, 1774, on importing or consuming any goods from Britain, Ireland, and the British West Indies. It also threatened an export ban on any products from the Thirteen Colonies to Britain, Ireland, or the West Indies, to be enacted only if the Intolerable Acts were not repealed by September 10, 1775. The Articles stated that the export ban was being suspended until this date because of the &quot;earnest desire we have not to injure our fellow-subjects in Great-Britain, Ireland, or the West-Indies.&quot; All American merchants were to direct their agents abroad to also comply with these restrictions, as would all ship owners. Additionally, article 2 placed a ban on all ships engaged in the slave trade.

The Association set forth policies by which the colonists would endure the scarcity of goods. Merchants were restricted from price gouging. Local committees of inspection were to be established in the Thirteen Colonies which would monitor compliance. Any individual observed to violate the pledges in the Articles would be condemned in print and ostracised in society &quot;as the enemies of American liberty.&quot; Colonies would also cease all trade and dealings with any other colony that failed to comply with the bans.

The colonies also pledged that they would &quot;encourage frugality, economy, and industry, and promote agriculture, arts and the manufactures of this country, especially that of wool; and will discountenance and discourage every species of extravagance and dissipation&quot;, such as gambling, stage plays, and other frivolous entertainment. It set forth specific instructions on frugal funeral observations, pledging that no one &quot;will go into any further mourning-dress, than a black crepe or ribbon on the arm or hat, for gentlemen, and a black ribbon and necklace for ladies, and we will discontinue the giving of gloves and scarves at funerals.&quot;

== Enforcement ==
The Continental Association went into effect on December 1, 1774. Compliance with (and support for) the established boycott was largely enforced through local enforcement committees. By mid-1775, a large majority of Virginia&#x27;s 61 counties had set up their own enforcement committees. Nearly all other colonies saw similar levels of success in upholding the boycott, with the notable exception of Georgia, where Governor James Wright emphasized the need for British protection from Native Americans.

The use of public pressure was an overwhelmingly effective tactic in enforcing support for the boycott. Those who went against the boycott or even simply criticized the Association would often find their names slandered in newspapers and town gossip, often forcing those targeted to cave to pressure and publicly apologize. The threat of more direct action also played a role in forcing merchants to comply, with one merchant in Annapolis, Maryland, choosing to burn his own ship full of imported tea rather than attempt to sell it. When enforcement could not be guaranteed, some counties enacted price ceilings to discourage smuggling.

==Effects==
Georgia waited a year but the other twelve colonies quickly established local enforcement committees; the restrictions were dutifully enforced in the others, and trade with Britain plummeted. Breen states that by early 1775 the local committees of safety, &quot;increasingly functioned as a revolutionary government&quot; and British officials no longer were in control. 

According to Christopher Gould, The Continental Association forced colonials to publicly take sides: Patriots signed and Loyalists did not. In South Carolina Patriots dominated in Charleston and coastal areas; Loyalists were most numerous in the backcountry. The Continental Association took charge of the boycotts and led to new governmental organizations that supervised Revolutionary activities. The South Carolina boycott made an exception for rice—it could still be exported but a fraction of sales went to purchase indigo from planters. Gould argues that the plan amounted to price stabilization and a commodity exchange program.

The King acted by securing an election and buying enough seats at £2500 to control the new Parliament. It then responded by passing the New England Restraining Act which prohibited the northeastern colonies from trading with anyone but Britain and the British West Indies, and they barred colonial ships from the North Atlantic fishing areas. These punitive measures were later extended to most of the other colonies, as well. Britain did not yield to American demands but instead tried to tighten its grip, and the conflict escalated to war. However, the long-term success of the Association was in its effective direction of collective action among the colonies and expression of their common interests.

<doc id="909301" wikidata="Q147610" url="?curid=909301" title="Greece at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Greece was the host country for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, from 13 to 29 August 2004. As the progenitor nation and in keeping with tradition, Greek athletes have competed at every Summer Olympics in the modern era, alongside Australia, Great Britain, and Switzerland. The Hellenic Olympic Committee fielded a total of 426 athletes to the Games, 215 men and 211 women, and had achieved automatic qualification places in all sports, with the exception of men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s field hockey. It was also the nation&#x27;s largest team ever in Summer Olympic history since the first modern Games were held in 1896.

Unlike most of the Olympic opening ceremonies, where the country enters first as a tribute to its history as the birthplace of the ancient Olympics and the host of the first modern Olympics in 1896, the country entered the last in the opening ceremony as the host nation. However, the Greek flag-bearer entered first, honoring the traditional role of Greece in opening the Parade of Nations, and the whole Greek delegation entered at the end, the traditional place for the host nation.

Greece left the Summer Olympic Games with a total of sixteen medals (six gold, six silver, and four bronze), finishing within the top fifteen position in the overall medal rankings. At least a single medal was awarded to the Greek team in ten sports; five of them came from the track and field, including two prestigious golds. Greece also topped the medal tally in diving, gymnastics, judo, and sailing. Three Greek athletes added Olympic medals to their career hardware from the previous editions.

Among the nation&#x27;s medalists were track hurdler Fani Halkia, race walker Athanasia Tsoumeleka, teenage judoka Ilias Iliadis, and diving duo Thomas Bimis and Nikolaos Siranidis, who won Greece&#x27;s first ever Olympic gold medals in their respective disciplines. Emerging as one of the greatest Olympic weightlifters of all time with three Olympic titles, Pyrros Dimas ended his illustrious sporting career with a bronze medal effort in the men&#x27;s light heavyweight category on his fourth and final Olympic appearance. Meanwhile, Nikolaos Kaklamanakis, who won the gold in Atlanta eight years earlier, and lit the Olympic flame at the conclusion of the opening ceremony, picked up his second medal with a silver in men&#x27;s Mistral windsurfing.

<doc id="909317" wikidata="Q466102" url="?curid=909317" title="Luzmila Carpio">
<text>Luzmila Carpio (born 1949) is a Bolivian singer and songwriter who has performed in Spanish and Quechua. She served as the Bolivian ambassador to France from 2006 to 2010.

==Early life==
Luzmila Carpio was born in 1949 in Qala Qala, a community near Ayllu Panacachi, in the northern region of Department of Potosi.

As a small child, she learned the daily songs of the Quechua and Aymara indigenous peoples that inhabit the Bolivian Altiplano. At 11, she travelled to Oruro to sing for a radio show that gave children the chance to take up the microphone every Sunday, but when she started to sing, the pianist shouted at her, saying &quot;¡Esto lo cantan los indios! ¡Vuelve cuando sepas cantar en castellano!&quot; [That’s what Indians sing! Come back when you know how to sing in Spanish!&quot;]. Carpio fled the studio in tears, but decided that she would return the following Sunday.

For several years in her early teens she sang in Spanish with a local group at the Technical University of Oruro, but the pull of her native tradition was strong and by age 15, she joined a professional group called Los Provincianos who sang in both Spanish and Quechua.

==Career==
In her early teens she moved to Oruro, and started expressing herself through her songs. Once she went to a radio station and sang the national anthem of Bolivia, the only song in Spanish that she knew. Later on she was selected as the lead singer by a musical band that participated in a contest in Cochabamba. The popular songs she sang in this occasion were designed to meet the demands of the vast popular segments of the population, mostly descendants of indigenous peoples but who already lived in the cities and spoke Spanish.
Afterwards, &quot;Siway Azucena&quot;, a melody composed by her inspired by the music of Northern Potosí, spread throughout the country, the first truly indigenous song to have widespread popular success.

Contrary to the prevalent trend of modernisation, she started looking deeper into the cultural and musical ways of the Andes and singing in Quechua, rather than Spanish. The main ingredient was not to please the audiences that kept growing but rather to use her music as an expression of rebellion against the predominance of western cultural ways over indigenous ones, as a way to show that this so far subordinated world also had a contribution to make, and as a way to build more harmonious relationships among the peoples of the world. In this quest, she authored and coauthored a number of songs for children: &quot;Ima sarata munanki&quot; (&quot;What kind of corn do you want&quot;), &quot;Aylluman kutiripuna&quot; (&quot;Let us return to the community&quot;) and many others. These songs became popular with children in rural schools.

In the late 1980s, she travelled to Paris to continue her musical evolution and be taken seriously as an artist. According to Sergio Cáceres, former Bolivian ambassador to UNESCO, &quot;Luzmilla suffered a double discrimination in Bolivia by being at the same time indigenous and a woman in a very racist and male dominated society. She created something more profound than urban folklore. Her music is a symbol for oppressed cultures.&quot;

On 21 April 2006, President Evo Morales appointed Luzmila Carpio as Bolivia&#x27;s ambassador to France. This position lasted four years, until 31 March 2010.

&quot;Yuyay Jap’ina Tapes&quot; was named one of Rolling Stone’s 10 best Latin albums of 2015 and referred to Carpio as being &quot;possibly the most prolific indigenous artist in South America&quot;.

In 2015, ZZK Records remixed her music to create the album &quot;Luzmila Carpio meets ZZK&quot; that received critical acclaim and was described as &quot;futuristic shamanism&quot; by &quot;Vice&quot; and as &quot;a condensation of tradition and futurism, of past and contemporary, of organic sounds and digital rhythms&quot; by RFI.

== Works ==

She has released more than 25 albums and composed more than 120 songs. Her albums include:

* &quot;Chants des Indiens Quechua de Bolivie&quot; (Francia, 1983)
* &quot;Indianische Stimme&quot; (1988); &quot;Huayños&quot; (1989)

<text>Dirigisme or dirigism () is an economic doctrine in which the state plays a strong directive (policies) role, contrary to a merely regulatory or non-interventionist role, over a market economy. As an economic doctrine, dirigisme is the opposite of &quot;laissez-faire&quot;, stressing a positive role for state intervention in curbing productive inefficiencies and market failures. Dirigiste policies often include indicative planning, state-directed investment, and the use of market instruments (taxes and subsidies) to incentivize market entities to fulfill state economic objectives.

The term emerged in the post-World War II era to describe the economic policies of France which included substantial state-directed investment, the use of indicative economic planning to supplement the market mechanism and the establishment of state enterprises in strategic domestic sectors. It coincided with both the period of substantial economic and demographic growth, known as the Trente Glorieuses which followed the war, and the slowdown beginning with the 1973 oil crisis.

The term has subsequently been used to classify other economies that pursued similar policies, such as Canada, Japan, the East Asian tiger economies of Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan; and more recently the economy of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) after its economic reforms, Malaysia, Indonesia and India after the opening of its economy in 1991.

Most modern economies can be characterized as dirigiste to some degree as the state may exercise directive action by performing or subsidizing research and development of new technologies through government procurement (especially military) or through state-run research institutes.

== France ==
Before the Second World War, France had a relatively fragmented capitalist economic system. The many small companies, often family-owned, were often not dynamic and efficient in comparison to the large industrial groups in Germany or the United States. The Second World War laid waste to France. Railroads and industries were destroyed by aerial bombardment and sabotage; industries were seized by Nazi Germany; in the immediate postwar years loomed the spectre of long years of rationing (such as the system enforced in that period in the United Kingdom). Some sections of the French business and political world lost authority after collaborating with the German occupiers.

Post-war French governments, from whichever political side, generally sought rational, efficient economic development, with the long-term goal of matching the highly developed and technologically advanced economy of the United States. The development of French dirigisme coincided with the development of meritocratic technocracy: the École Nationale d&#x27;Administration supplied the state with high-level administrators, while leadership positions in industry were staffed with Corps of Mines state engineers and other personnel trained at the École Polytechnique.

During the 1945–1975 period, France experienced unprecedented economic growth (5.1% on average) and a demographic boom, leading to the coinage of the term &quot;Trente Glorieuses&quot; (the &quot;Glorious Thirty [years]&quot;).

Dirigisme flourished under the conservative governments of Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou. In those times, the policy was viewed as a middle way between the American policy of little state involvement and the Soviet policy of total state control. In 1981, Socialist president François Mitterrand was elected, promising greater state enterprise in the economy; his government soon nationalised industries and banks. However, in 1983 the initial bad economic results forced the government to renounce dirigisme and start the era of &quot;rigueur&quot; (&quot;rigour&quot;). This was primarily due to the Inflation of the French Franc and the Keynesian policies taken by François Mitterrand. Dirigisme has remained out of favour with subsequent governments, though some of its traits remain.

=== Indicative planning ===
The main French tool under dirigisme was indicative planning through plans designed by the &quot;Commissariat général du plan&quot; (&quot;Commission for the Plan&quot;). Indicative planning used various incentives to induce public and private actors to behave in an optimal fashion, with the plan serving as a general guideline for optimal investment. During this period France never ceased to be a capitalist economy directed by the accumulation of capital, profit-maximizing enterprise and market-based allocation of producer goods.

In contrast to Soviet-type central planning practiced in the former Soviet bloc, where economic planning substituted private profit incentivized investment and operated the factors of production according to a binding plan, the French state never owned more than a minority of industry and did not seek to replace private profit with central planning. The idea of dirigisme is to complement and improve the efficiency of the market through indirect planning intended to provide better information to market participants. This concept is held in contrast to a planned economy, which aims to replace market-based allocation of production and investment with a binding plan of production expressed in units of physical quantities.

=== State ownership ===
Because French industry prior to the Second World War was weak due to fragmentation, the French government encouraged mergers and the formation of &quot;national champions&quot;: large industry groups backed by the state.

Two areas where the French government sought greater control were in infrastructure and the transportation system. The French government owned the national railway company SNCF, the national electricity utility EDF, the national natural gas utility GDF, the national airline Air France; phone and postal services were operated as the PTT administration. The government chose to devolve the construction of most autoroutes (freeways) to semi-private companies rather than to administer them itself. Other areas where the French government directly intervened were defence, nuclear and aerospace industries (Aérospatiale).

This development was marked by &quot;volontarisme&quot;, the belief that difficulties (e.g. postwar devastation, lack of natural resources) could be overcome through willpower and ingenuity. For instance, following the 1973 energy crisis, the saying &quot;In France we don&#x27;t have oil, but we have ideas&quot; was coined. Volontarisme emphasized modernization, resulting in a variety of ambitious state plans. Examples of this trend include the extensive use of nuclear energy (close to 80% of French electrical consumption), the Minitel, an early online system for the masses, and the TGV, a high-speed rail network.

== India ==

Dirigisme is seen in India after the end of British rule from 1947 with domestic policy tending towards protectionism, a strong emphasis on import substitution industrialisation, economic interventionism, a large government-run public sector, business regulation, and central planning, while trade and foreign investment policies were relatively liberal. However, in regard to trade and foreign investment, other authors disagree stating that high tariff barriers were maintained, with import duties of 350% not being uncommon, and there was also severe restrictions on the entry of foreign goods, capital, and technology. Although a mixed economy, the share of investment in public sector enterprises was 60%. India&#x27;s economic policies during this period were more akin to Soviet economic planning rather than the French dirigisme model. Socialist economic planning was especially prevalent in form of the Planning Commission and Five-Year plans. 

After liberalisation in 1991, India shifted from a planned dirigisme to market dirigisme economy. The Indian state has complete control and ownership of railways, highways; majority control and stake in banking, insurance, farming, dairy, fertilizers &amp; chemicals, airports, nuclear, mining, digitization, defense, steel, rare earths, water, electricity, oil and gas industries and power plants, and has substantial control over digitalization, Broadband as national infrastructure, telecommunication, supercomputing, space, port and shipping industries, among other industries, were effectively nationalised in the mid-1950s. In essence, the Indian Government has indirect control on all sectors except technology and consumer goods.

== Other economies with dirigiste characteristics ==
Economic dirigisme has been described as an inherent aspect of fascist economies by Hungarian author Iván T. Berend in his book &quot;An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe&quot;. However, the fascist systems created in Italy, Portugal, Spain, Japan, or Germany were a varied mix of elements from numerous philosophies, including nationalism, authoritarianism, militarism, corporatism, collectivism, totalitarianism, and anti-communism.

Dirigisme has been brought up as a politico-economic scheme at odds with &quot;laissez-faire&quot; capitalism in the context of French overseas holdings. To varying degrees throughout the post-colonial period, countries such as Lebanon and Syria have been influenced by this motif.

<text>There have been two &quot;baronetcies&quot; created in the 17th and 18th centuries for persons with the same surname, Wynn; these titles were given to families from North Wales, United Kingdom:

# The Wynn of Gwydir baronetcy was in the List of baronetcies in the Baronetage of England (1611), descendants of the baronetcy intermarried into different families.
# The Wynn of Bodvean baronetcy (Bodfaen/Boduan) was listed in the Baronetage of Great Britain (1742), and the family has since assumed a different title.

The surname is derived from (which can mean &quot;white&quot; or &quot;blessed&quot;), (soft mutation form &quot;wyn&quot;). The family name Wynn originates from North Wales. The first mention of the Wynn family of Gwydir was recorded by the children of Maredudd ap Ifan (died 1525), and the name was subsequently adopted as a surname by Maredudd&#x27;s grandchildren, including Maurice Wynn (died 1580), ancestor of the Wynns of Gwydir; whereas the Wynns of Bodvean (subsequently Baron Newborough) descended from John Wyn ap Hugh (John Wynne, died 1576).

==Wynn of Gwydir==
The Wynn of Gwydir Baronetcy in the County of Carnarvon was created in the Baronetage of England on 29 June 1611, for John Wynn. The members of this line were heirs to the House of Aberffraw&#x27;s claim to the Kingdom of Gwynedd and subsequently the Principality of Wales as direct descendants of Prince Owain Gwynedd, the King of Gwynedd.

The history of the Wynns of Gwydir begins with the father of Maurice Wynn, John &quot;Wynn&quot; ap Maredudd. John had rebuilt Gwydir around 1555 after inheriting the lease of Gwydir from his father Maredudd ab Ieuan; Maredudd had purchased the estate from Dafydd ap Hywel Coetmor around 1500. Maredudd also purchased the lease for Dolwyddelan Castle, built Penamnen, and owned lands in the commote of Nant Conwy and Llanfrothen. Maurice was the first to adopt the family name &#x27;Wynn&#x27; and was a high sheriff and a member of parliament for Caernarvonshire during the 16th century. The family continued to be prominent in politics, and all the baronets except for Owen (3rd baronet) sat as Members of Parliament, often for Carnarvonshire or other parts of England and Wales. On the death of the fifth baronet, the title became extinct in 1719.

A younger branch of the Wynn of Gwydir family emerged in the area of Berthddu and Bodysgallen as descendants of Gruffudd Wynn, the younger brother of Maurice (d. 1580); they married into the Mostyn baronets and Vaughan of Corsygedol and Talhenbont families.

===Wynn of Gwydir inheritances===
Before the baronetcy of Wynn of Gwydir became extinct, there had been marriages and inheritances shared amongst the descendants of the family. Mary Wynn, an only child, and heiress of the fourth Baronet was the wife of Robert Bertie, 17th Baron Willoughby de Eresby and 1st Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven, of Grimsthorpe Castle, and is now represented by the Baron Carrington who sold Gwydir Castle in 1921. Another descendant of the 4th baronet, Richard Wynn, was Sir Peter Burrell, husband of Priscilla Bertie, 21st Baroness Willoughby de Eresby, of Drummond Castle, Peter was created Baron Gwydyr in 1796. Peter&#x27;s wife Priscilla was a daughter of Peregrine Bertie, 3rd Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven, and Duchess Mary Panton. The family seat of the Barons of Willoughby de Eresby is Grimsthorpe Castle.

The fifth baronet succeeded his cousin as baronet and inherited the Wynnstay estate, near Ruabon, north Wales. Wynnstay had been the family seat of the Wynn family. The mansion eventually passed to a cousin of the Wynn baronet, Jane Thelwell, and her husband Sir Watkin Williams-Wynn, 3rd Baronet who inherited the estate. Sir Watkin added the surname Wynn to his name, and his descendants became the Williams-Wynn Baronets.

===Wynn Baronets of Gwydir (1611)===
*Sir John Wynn, 1st Baronet (c. 1553–1627)

*Sir John Wynn, 5th Baronet (c. 1628–1719)

Upon extinction of the baronetcy, the family estate was inherited by a cousin; the family is still in the same area today, known as the Williams-Wynn Baronets.

==Wynn of Bodvean==
The Wynn of Bodvean Baronetcy in the County of Carnarvon was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 25 October 1742, for Sir Thomas Wynn. The family origins were near Boduan, North Wales.

John Wynn (John Wyn ap Hugh of Bodvel, died 1576) being the Bodvel family ancestor, John was high sheriff for Caernarfon. Wynn was the standard bearer for John, Earl of Warwick / Duke of Northumberland; this was for the Earl of Warwick&#x27;s service at Kett&#x27;s Rebellion in 1549 and he received Bardsey Island (Gwynedd) for his feats. Wynn descended directly from the Kings of Gwynedd via Collwyn ap Tangno (founder of the 5th tribe of the Fifteen Tribes of Wales). The Wynn of Bodvean family are also descendants of Ynyr Fychan from the Nannau family dynasty in Wales. The Wynn of Bodvel (Bodvean) family ceased to exist, but did marry into an Irish noble family to create the then new title, Baron Newborough.

===Wynn Baronets, of Bodvean (1742)===
*Sir Thomas Wynn, 1st Baronet (1677–1749)
*Sir John Wynn, 2nd Baronet (1701–1773)
*Sir Thomas Wynn, 3rd Baronet (1736–1807) (created Baron Newborough in 1776).

==Wynn baronets intermarriage==

An example of intermarriages between both Wynn families in Wales was John Bodvel (16171663). He had been a member of parliament for Anglesey and worked as the commission of array for Caernarfonshire in 1643, then also as the Custos Rotulorum of Anglesey, attending the Oxford Parliament (1644). Bodvel was a grandchild of Sir John Wynn, 1st Baronet of Gwydir, and also Hugh Gwyn&#x27;s (died 1611) great-grandchild, Gwyn being one of John Wynne of Bodvean&#x27;s (died 1576) children.

<text>Sylvia, Lady Ashley (born Edith Louisa Hawkes, 1 April 1904 – 29 June 1977) was an English model, actress, and socialite who was best known for her numerous marriages to British and Georgian noblemen and American movie stars.

==Early life==

Ashley was born Edith Louisa Hawkes on 1 April 1904, at 112 Hall Place, Paddington, London, England, the elder daughter of Edith Florence Hyde and Arthur Hawkes. The family moved to nearby Wharncliffe Gardens, Lisson Grove, before 1910. She later renamed herself Sylvia and preferred giving her year of birth as 1906. Her 1927 marriage certificate records her name as Edith Louisa Sylvia Hawkes and her father as Arthur Hawkes (deceased), gentleman.

Her father was a livery stable employee, latterly porter in a block of flats and doorman at a restaurant. When he died, his younger daughter administered his estate.

Ashley&#x27;s sister, Lilian Vera Hawkes married British film producer Basil Bleck on 18 December 1929.

==Professional career==

As Sylvia Hawkes, she worked as a lingerie model and became a Cochran Dancer. After this brief career in the chorus line of musical comedy, she appeared in West End plays. In 1924, she debuted in &quot;Midnight Follies&quot;. She appeared in &quot;Primrose&quot;. In 1925, she acted in &quot;Tell me More&quot; at London&#x27;s Winter Garden Theatre, and in &quot;The Whole Town&#x27;s Talking&quot;.

In the 1920s, Ashley regularly appeared on stage with American writer Dorothy Fields in the comedy duo &quot;Silly and Dotty&quot; in &quot;Midnight Follies&quot; at the London Metropole.

On 1 March 1941, Lady Ashley filed articles of incorporation to establish an organisation known as the British Distressed Areas Fund. Organised along with her sister, Vera Bleck, Constance Bennett, and Virginia Fox Zanuck, as directors, the Fund focused on soliciting financial support to provide food, clothing and medical aid for refugees of World War II. The headquarters of the organisation was located in Los Angeles, California.

===Primrose audition===
In their joint memoir &quot;Bring on the Girls!&quot;, P. G. Wodehouse and Guy Bolton relate the story of Ashley&#x27;s audition for George Grossmith Jr. for the 1924 musical &quot;Primrose&quot;:

==Personal life==
Ashley was married five times:
* Major Lord Ashley (married 3 February 1927 – 28 November 1934; divorced).
* Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., American actor (married 7 March 1936 – 12 December 1939, his death).
* The 6th Baron Stanley of Alderley (married 18 January 1944 – 1948; divorced).
* Clark Gable, American actor (married 20 December 1949 – 21 April 1952; divorced).
* Prince Dimitri Jorjadze, hotel executive and race-car driver (married 1954).

Lady Ashley died of cancer on 29 June 1977 at age 73 in Los Angeles. She is interred in the Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Hollywood; her grave is 680 feet north of that of her second husband, Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., at the north end of the &quot;Garden of Legends&quot;, aka &quot;Section 8&quot;.

U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps blasted his own Olympic record of 1:57.14 to claim his fourth career gold medal in swimming. Coming from fifth place in the final turn, Phelps&#x27; teammate Ryan Lochte powered home with a silver in 1:58.78. Meanwhile, George Bovell held off Hungary&#x27;s László Cseh by four hundredths of a second (0.04) to give Trinidad and Tobago its first ever swimming medal, in a Commonwealth record of 1:58.80.

Earlier in the semifinals, Phelps posted a new Olympic record of 1:58.52, previously set by Italian swimmer and defending Olympic champion Massimiliano Rosolino in Sydney four years earlier. Rosolino, along with his teammate Alessio Boggiatto, failed to reach the top 8 final with a tenth and eleventh-place effort. Tunisia&#x27;s Oussama Mellouli, who placed fifth in the 400 m individual medley, also missed the cut, but set an African record of 2:01.11.

<doc id="909357" wikidata="Q2543258" url="?curid=909357" title="Thomas Hardwicke">
<text>Major-General Thomas Hardwicke (1756 – 3 March 1835) was an English soldier and naturalist who was in India from 1777 to 1823. He collected numerous specimens of natural history and had them painted by Indian artists. From these paintings many new species were described. Several of these species are named after him. On returning to England he collaborated with the zoologist John Edward Gray to publish &quot;Illustrations of Indian Zoology&quot; (1830–1835).

==Biography==
Hardwicke joined the British East India Company army with the Bengal Artillery as a Lieutenant Fireworker on 3 November 1778. He was posted in southern India from 1781 to 1785 serving under Colonel Pearce and Sir Eyre Coote. He was in the field during the campaign against Tipu Sultan in 1790–1792. He saw action in the Relief of Vellore (10 January 1782), the Siege of Cuddalore (June 1783) and in the Rohilla Campaign (26 October 1794). He was wounded at Satyamangalam on 13 September 1790 and was posted as a Company Orderly at Bangalore before moving to Bengal in 1793 to become Adjutant and Quartermaster of Artillery. Hardwicke rose to become Major-General in 1819. He resigned from the command of the Bengal Artillery in 1823 to return to England and died at The Lodge, Lambeth, on 3 March 1835.

During his military career in India, Hardwicke travelled extensively over the subcontinent. He started collecting zoological specimens in these travels and amassed a large collection of paintings of animals which he got local artists to make. Most paintings were made from dead specimens, but many were also drawn from life. When he left India, he had the largest collection of drawings of Indian animals ever formed by an individual. Some drawings were also made by his daughter Elizabeth (between 1811 and 1815 – it was her poor health that led Hardwicke to leave India). 

The Indian artists employed by Hardwicke are unknown, except for one Goordial, but they were trained and their style was adapted to the demands of technical illustration using watercolours. The collection was bequeathed to the British Museum in 1835 which was later partly moved to the Natural History Museum. The collection consists of 4500 illustrations.

Hardwicke&#x27;s enthusiasm for the natural history of India was matched by the leading naturalists in England, with whom he corresponded. He was in contact with Sir Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Society, and Hardwicke himself became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1813. His collections of illustrations were used by zoologists like J. E. Gray. The two volume &quot;Illustrations of Indian Zoology&quot; was published with Hardwicke&#x27;s financing, containing 202 large hand-coloured plates, but he died before the textual part was produced. Gray described and named many of the species in the work except for some of the testudines which were named on the basis of the manuscripts of Thomas Bell. Some drawings of shells and plants which were part of the collections he bequeathed were probably made by his sister. Hardwicke also collected botanical drawings and 16 volumes of illustrations of &quot;Plants of India&quot; and about 136 drawings of fungi are in the British Library in London. 
Hardwicke was elected Fellow of the Royal Society on 8 April 1813 and Fellow of the Linnean Society on 20 March 1804. He also held positions of vice-president to the Asiatic Society of Bengal and was an honorary member of the Royal Dublin Society. Hardwicke was not married but had three illegitimate daughters and two sons apart from two daughters born to an Indian mistress (named as Fyzbuhsh in his Will).

Several species named to commemorate his work as ornithologist, naturalist and zoologist:
*&quot;Parnassius hardwickii&quot; – common blue Apollo
*&quot;Temera hardwickii&quot; – finless sleeper ray
*&quot;Solegnathus hardwickii&quot; – Hardwicke&#x27;s pipefish, pallid seahorse
*&quot;Thalassoma hardwicke&quot; – sixbar wrasse, six-banded wrasse
*&quot;Eublepharis hardwickii&quot; – East Indian leopard gecko, Hardwicke&#x27;s gecko
*&quot;Saara hardwickii&quot; – Hardwicke&#x27;s spiny-tailed lizard, Indian spiny-tailed lizard
*&quot;Hydrophis hardwickii&quot; – spine-bellied sea snake, Hardwicke&#x27;s sea snake
*&quot;Chloropsis hardwickii&quot; – orange-bellied leafbird
*&quot;Gallinago hardwickii&quot; – Latham&#x27;s snipe, Japanese snipe
*&quot;Kerivoula hardwickii&quot; – Hardwicke&#x27;s woolly bat
*&quot;Rhinopoma hardwickii&quot; – lesser mouse-tailed bat, Hardwicke&#x27;s lesser mouse-tailed bat, long-tailed bat

The genus of a tree known for its hard wood, &quot;Hardwickia binata&quot;, was named after him by William Roxburgh.

<doc id="909363" wikidata="Q864854" url="?curid=909363" title="Biotinylation">
<text>In biochemistry, biotinylation is the process of covalently attaching biotin to a protein, nucleic acid or other molecule. Biotinylation is rapid, specific and is unlikely to disturb the natural function of the molecule due to the small size of biotin (MW = 244.31 g/mol). Biotin binds to streptavidin and avidin with an extremely high affinity, fast on-rate, and high specificity, and these interactions are exploited in many areas of biotechnology to isolate biotinylated molecules of interest. Biotin-binding to streptavidin and avidin is resistant to extremes of heat, pH and proteolysis, making capture of biotinylated molecules possible in a wide variety of environments. Also, multiple biotin molecules can be conjugated to a protein of interest, which allows binding of multiple streptavidin, avidin or neutravidin protein molecules and increases the sensitivity of detection of the protein of interest. There is a large number of biotinylation reagents available that exploit the wide range of possible labelling methods. Due to the strong affinity between biotin and streptavidin, the purification of biotinylated proteins has been a widely used approach to identify protein-protein interactions and post-translational events such as ubiquitylation in molecular biology.

==Labeling methods==
Proteins can be biotinylated chemically or enzymatically. Chemical biotinylation utilises various conjugation chemistries to yield nonspecific biotinylation of amines, carboxylates, sulfhydryls and carbohydrates (e.g., NHS-coupling gives biotinylation of any primary amines in the protein). Enzymatic biotinylation results in biotinylation of a specific lysine within a certain sequence by a bacterial biotin ligase. Most chemical biotinylation reagents consist of a reactive group attached via a linker to the valeric acid side chain of biotin. As the biotin binding pocket in avidin / streptavidin is buried beneath the protein surface, biotinylation reagents possessing a longer linker are desirable, as they enable the biotin molecule, once it has been attached to its target, to be more accessible to binding avidin/streptavidin/Neutravidin protein. This linker can also mediate the solubility of biotinylation reagents; linkers that incorporate poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG) can make water-insoluble reagents soluble or increase the solubility of biotinylation reagents that are already soluble to some extent.

===Enzymatic biotinylation===
In contrast to chemical biotinylation methods, enzymatic biotinylation allows biotin to be linked at exactly one residue present in the protein. This biotinylation reaction can also go to completion, meaning that the product is generated with high uniformity and can be linked to streptavidin in a defined orientation e.g. for MHC multimers. Enzymatic biotinylation is most often carried out by &quot;E. coli&quot; biotin holoenzyme synthetase, also known as biotin ligase (BirA, ).

The most common way of targeting a protein of interest is by fusing the protein at its N-terminus, C-terminus or at an internal loop to a 15 amino acid peptide (), termed AviTag or Acceptor Peptide (AP). Once tagged, the protein is then incubated with BirA allowing biotinylation to take place in the presence of biotin and ATP. Enzymatic biotinylation can be carried out &quot;in vitro&quot; but BirA also reacts specifically with its target peptide inside mammalian and bacterial cells and at the cell surface, while other cellular proteins are not modified. Enzymatic biotinylation can also take place &quot;in vivo&quot; typically through the co-expression of an Avitag tagged protein and BirA.

The natural substrate of BirA is the biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP). Before smaller tags were discovered, a protein needed to be fused to the entire BCCP to be targeted. A protein fused by BCCP can be recognized by biotin molecules &quot;in vivo&quot; and attach to it. A few other small tags have been used before AviTag, but AviTag is the most efficient so far.

===Primary amine biotinylation===
The most common targets for modifying protein molecules are primary amine groups that are present as lysine side chain epsilon-amines and N-terminal α-amines. Amine-reactive biotinylation reagents can be divided into two groups based on water solubility.

N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS) esters have poor solubility in aqueous solutions. For reactions in aqueous solution, they must first be dissolved in an organic solvent, then diluted into the aqueous reaction mixture. The most commonly used organic solvents for this purpose are dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethyl formamide (DMF), which are compatible with most proteins at low concentrations. Because of the hydrophobicity of NHS-esters, NHS biotinylation reagents can also diffuse through the cell membrane, meaning that they will biotinylate both internal and external components of a cell.

Sulfo-NHS esters are more soluble in water and should be dissolved in water just before use because they hydrolyze easily. The water solubility of sulfo-NHS-esters stems from their sulfonate group on the N-hydroxysuccinimide ring and eliminates the need to dissolve the reagent in an organic solvent. Sulfo-NHS-esters of biotin also can be used as cell surface biotinylation reagents, because they do not penetrate the cell membrane.

The chemical reactions of NHS- and sulfo-NHS esters are essentially identical, in that they both react spontaneously with amines to form an amide bond. Because the target for the ester is a deprotonated primary amine, the reaction is favored under basic conditions (above pH 7). Hydrolysis of the NHS ester is a major competing reaction, and the rate of hydrolysis increases with increasing pH. NHS- and sulfo-NHS-esters have a half-life of several hours at pH 7 but only a few minutes at pH 9.

There is some flexibility in the conditions for conjugating NHS-esters to primary amines. Incubation temperatures can range from 4-37 °C, pH values in the reaction range from 7-9, and incubation times range from a few minutes to 12 hours. Buffers containing amines (such as Tris or glycine) must be avoided, because they compete with the reaction.

===Sulfhydryl biotinylation===
An alternative to primary amine biotinylation is to label sulfhydryl groups with biotin. Because free sulfhydryl groups are less prevalent on most proteins compared to primary amines, sulfhydryl biotinylation is useful when primary amines are located in the regulatory domain(s) of the target protein or when a reduced level of biotinylation is required. Sulfhydryl-reactive groups such as maleimides, haloacetyls and pyridyl disulfides, require free sulfhydryl groups for conjugation; disulfide bonds must first be reduced to free up the sulfhydryl groups for biotinylation. If no free sulfhydryl groups are available, lysines can be modified with various thiolation reagents (Traut&#x27;s reagent, SAT(PEG4), SATA and SATP), resulting in the addition of a free sulfhydryl. Sulfhydryl biotinylation is performed at a slightly lower pH (6.5-7.5) than labeling with NHS esters. 

Besides whole proteins, biotinylated peptides can be synthesized by introducing a cysteine (Cys) residue during synthesis at the terminus of the amino acid chain to get a site specific and oriented biotinylation. Nucleotides can also be biotinylated by incorporation of thiolated nucleotides.

===Carboxyl biotinylation===
Carboxyl groups are found on the C-terminal ends of proteins and on glutamate and aspartate amino acid side chains. Biotinylation reagents that target carboxyl groups do not have a carboxyl-reactive moiety per se but instead rely on a carbodiimide crosslinker such as EDC to bind the primary amine on the biotinylation reagents to the carboxyl group on the target protein.

Biotinylation at carboxyl groups occur at pH 4.5–5.5. To prevent crossreactivity of the crosslinker with buffer constituents, buffers should not contain primary amines (e.g., Tris, glycine) or carboxyls (e.g., acetate, citrate); MES buffer is an ideal choice.

===Glycoprotein biotinylation===
Glycoproteins can be biotinylated by modifying the carbohydrate residues to aldehydes, which then react with hydrazine- or alkoxyamine-based biotinylation reagents. Sodium periodate oxidizes the sialic acids on glycoproteins to aldehydes to form these stable linkages at pH 4–6.

Polyclonal antibodies are heavily glycosylated, and because glycosylation does not interfere with the antibody activity, biotinylating the glycosyl groups is an ideal strategy to generate biotinylated antibodies.

===Oligonucleotide biotinylation===
Oligonucleotides are readily biotinylated in the course of oligonucleotide synthesis by the phosphoramidite method using commercial biotin phosphoramidite. Upon the standard deprotection, the conjugates obtained can be purified using reverse-phase or anion-exchange HPLC

===Non-specific biotinylation===
Photoactivatable biotinylation reagents are ideal when primary amines, sulfhydryls, carboxyls and carbohydrates are not available for labeling. These reagents rely on aryl azides, which become activated by ultraviolet light (UV; &gt;350 nm), which then react at C-H and N-H bonds. Because these types of bonds occur independent of the type of amino acid, this type of biotinylation is termed &quot;non-specific&quot;.

Photoactivatable biotinylation reagents can also be used to activate biotinylation at specific times in an experiment or during certain reaction conditions, by simply exposing the reaction to UV light at the specific time or condition.

==Purpose==

===Purification===
The biotin tag can be used in affinity chromatography together with a column that has avidin (or streptavidin or neutravidin) bound to it, which is the natural ligand for biotin. However, harsh conditions (e.g., 6M GuHCl at pH 1.5) are needed to break the avidin/streptavidin - biotin interaction, which will most likely denature the protein carrying the biotin tag. If isolation of the tagged protein is needed, it is better to tag the protein with iminobiotin. This biotin analogue gives strong binding to avidin/streptavidin at alkaline pH, but the affinity is reduced upon lowering the pH. Therefore, an iminobiotin-tagged functional protein can be released from an avidin/streptavidin column by decreasing the pH (to around pH 4).

===Detection===
This tag can also be used in detection of the protein via anti-biotin antibodies or avidin/streptavidin-tagged detection strategies such as enzyme reporters (e.g., horseradish peroxidase, alkaline phosphatase) or fluorescent probes. This can be useful in localization by fluorescent or electron microscopy, ELISA assays, ELISPOT assays, western blots and other immunoanalytical methods. Detection with monovalent streptavidin can avoid clustering or aggregation of the biotinylated target.

==Other uses==
The non-covalent bond formed between biotin and avidin or streptavidin has a binding affinity that is higher than most antigen and antibody bonds and approaches the strength of a covalent bond. This very tight binding makes labeling proteins with biotin a useful tool for applications such as affinity chromatography using immobilized avidin or streptavidin to separate the biotinylated protein from a mixture of other proteins and biochemicals. Biotinylated protein such as biotinylated bovine serum albumin (BSA) is used in solid-phase assays as a coating on the well surface in multiwell assay plates. Biotinylation of red blood cells has been used as a means of determining total blood volume without the use of radiolabels such as chromium 51, allowing volume determinations in low birth weight infants and pregnant women who could not otherwise be exposed to the required doses of radioactivity. Furthermore, biotinylation of MHC molecules to create MHC multimers has become a useful tool for identifying and isolating antigen-specific T-cell populations. More recently, &quot;in vivo&quot; protein biotinylation was developed to study protein-protein interactions and proximity in living cells

==Determining the extent of biotinylation==
Reaction conditions for biotinylation are chosen so that the target molecule (e.g., an antibody) is labeled with sufficient biotin molecules to purify or detect the molecule, but not so much that the biotin interferes with the function of the molecule.

===HABA assay===
The HABA (2-(4-hydroxyazobenzene) benzoic acid) assay can be used to determine the extent of biotinylation. HABA dye is bound to avidin or streptavidin and yields a characteristic absorbance. When biotinylated proteins or other molecules are introduced, the biotin displaces the dye, resulting in a change in absorbance at 500 nm. This change is directly proportional to the level of biotin in the sample. The disadvantage of the HABA assay is that it uses large amounts of sample.

===Streptavidin gel-shift===
Extent of biotinylation can also be measured by streptavidin gel-shift, since streptavidin remains bound to biotin during agarose gel electrophoresis or polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The proportion of target biotinylated can be measured via the change in band intensity of the target with or without excess streptavidin, seen quickly and quantitatively for biotinylated proteins by Coomassie brilliant blue staining.

<text>World Radio Switzerland (WRS) is the only 24-hour, English-language broadcast radio station in Switzerland.

Until October 2013, it broadcast on 101.7 MHz FM in the Lake Geneva region, and now continues on DAB+ digital radio across Switzerland. It can also be heard through live streaming on the WRS website, internet radio hubs and mobile apps.

== Administration ==
WRS is owned by SwissVille Broadcasting Sàrl, registered in Geneva. The radio station&#x27;s broadcast operations are headquartered at 9, Rue de Veyrot, Meyrin, 1217 in Geneva, Switzerland.

== History ==

In the late 1980s, the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation (SRG SSR) decided that an English-language radio station in Geneva would enhance its international reputation and provide a useful service to the international organizations established in the city. To that end, SRG SSR applied to the Federal Office of Communications for an FM frequency. The first application, made in 1992, was rejected. The application was resubmitted in 1995 and then granted. However, by that time the Federal Office of Communications made it clear that all new radio stations had to be commercial.

World Radio Geneva began broadcasting on 25 June 1996 and officially ended on 12 October 2007 after a change in the law integrated the radio station into the Swiss public service. World Radio Switzerland launched on 5 November 2007 as a public service broadcaster, available on digital radio across Switzerland.

In 2012, WRS&#x27; parent corporation, SRG SSR, announced its intention to privatise the station. As of December 2012, there were two bidders for the broadcaster.

In 2013 the station was privatised and sold by SRG SSR to Anglo Media Group.

The name &quot;WRS&quot; and some features of the former public service broadcaster were retained by Anglo Media Group, which had previously operated an internet station: Radio Frontier. The broadcasting on FM 101.7 MHz covering the Western part of the lake Geneva area stopped on 1 October 2013 while the DAB+ signal covering the Swiss French Speaking region and the Swiss German Speaking region continues alongside internet, mobile and WRS app listening.

WRS currently produces live presented programmes across each day, additional lifestyle contributed programmes, together with hourly international news and thematic programmes from the BBC World Service.

The WRS website contains the station&#x27;s programme offerings, local Swiss news, an events calendar, a local directory, property advertising and a classifieds section.

== Types of listeners ==
Listeners of WRS live across Switzerland, and in over 100 additional countries, with core listening audiences in the cantons of Geneva and Vaud, neighbouring border areas of France, Zurich, Basel, Zug and Luzerne. Countries of origin include Switzerland, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Australia. According to a federal census, 739,000 Swiss speak English at work (16.9% of the working population).

== Station Awards ==

In 2005, WRG - World Radio Geneva - was awarded &#x27;Radio Station of the Year&#x27; as part of Swiss Radio Day.

In 2012, WRS was awarded &#x27;Radio Station of the Year&#x27; as part of Swiss Radio Day. The award is given to one station in the German-speaking, and one in the French and Italian-speaking regions of the country for biggest net listener increase.

In 2013, while still part of the Swiss Broadcasting Corporation, WRS won five regional Edward R. Murrow Awards from the Radio Television Digital News Association. The awards for broadcast journalism were presented for a small-market, international station. Award-winning stories included a series reported from revolutionary Egypt, a newscast after a tragic bus crash in Valais, and continuing coverage about Swiss banks, among others.
In the summer of 2013, WRS was awarded &#x27;Radio Station of the Year&#x27; for the third time and the second year in succession for its percentage increase in listener audience.

In 2014, WRS won three regional RTDNA Edward R. Murrow Awards for work completed before the station was privatised. The winning entries include a report on &quot;The Gender Gap&quot; produced at the World Economic Forum&#x27;s annual meeting in Davos; a pair of reports about an Alpine river that died after a dam incident; and a report about Switzerland&#x27;s first stand-alone Hindu temple.

<text>The women&#x27;s 4 × 200 metre freestyle relay took place on 18 August at the Olympic Aquatic Centre of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Athens, Greece.

The U.S. women&#x27;s swimming team (Natalie Coughlin, Carly Piper, Dana Vollmer, and Kaitlin Sandeno) broke the oldest world record in the book, when they clocked at 7:53.42, slashing 2.05 seconds off the old, mark set by the East Germans exactly 17 years ago. Leading off the race, Coughlin swam a fastest split and a personal best of 1:57.74, which became quicker than a gold-medal performance of 1:58.03 set by Romania&#x27;s Camelia Potec in the individual 200 m freestyle.

With Team USA taking its third straight title since the event&#x27;s Olympic debut in 1996, China made a surprise packet with a silver medal, in an Asian record of 7:55.97. Meanwhile, the unified Germans held off the Aussies for the bronze in 7:57.35, 45-hundredths of a second under an old Olympic record set by Team USA in 2000. Despite missing the podium by 0.05 of a second, the Australians broke their national record of 7:57.40 to settle only for fourth place.

<text>Philip Marie Constant Bancroft O&#x27;Connor (8 September 1916 – 29 May 1998) was a British writer and surrealist poet, who also painted. He was one of the &#x27;Wheatsheaf writers&#x27; of 1930s Fitzrovia (who took their name from a pub).

==Early life==
In his &quot;Memoirs of a Public Baby&quot; (1958, Faber and Faber) O&#x27;Connor wrote about his early life, which was &quot;shrouded in a good deal of mystery and make-believe&quot;. According to O&#x27;Connor, his father, Bernard, was an Oxford-educated surgeon of sophisticated tastes, descended from the last High King of Ireland; he allegedly died early in the First World War whilst serving in the Navy. Notwithstanding O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s account, &quot;neither the Admiralty, Oxford University nor the various doctors&#x27; registers are able to authenticate&quot; what he wrote. Per O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s account, his mother considered his father &quot;riff-raff&quot; and &quot;a cad&quot;. O&#x27;Connor gave her name as Winifred Xavier Rodyke-Thompson, of an Irish Roman Catholic family; she claimed her grandfather had been born into the Spring Rice family headed by Baron Monteagle of Brandon, later changing his name. During O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s childhood, his mother founded the Somerset Cigarette Agency and secured a government contract to produce inferior cigarettes for supply to soldiers. In 1934 he was a close friend in London with the author Laurie Lee, who mentions him in his book As I Walked Out One Midsummer Morning, chapter 2, pages 6-7.

==Career==
&quot;Memoirs of a Public Baby&quot; was followed by &quot;The Lower View&quot; (1960), &quot;Living in Croesor&quot; (1962) and &quot;Vagrancy&quot; (1963). He was a heavy drinker and (at the very least) massively eccentric, living a mainly parasitic life. In his own words, he &quot;bathed in life and dried [himself] on the typewriter&quot;.

In 1963, O&#x27;Connor interviewed an acquaintance, Quentin Crisp, for the BBC Third Programme. A publisher who happened to hear the broadcast was impressed by Crisp&#x27;s performance, and as an indirect result of O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s interview, Crisp ended up writing &quot;The Naked Civil Servant&quot;.

==Personal life==
He fathered &quot;an unknown number of attractive and intelligent children&quot;, including Philip, Max, Sarah, Peter, John, Allaye, Patric, Rachel, Maxim and Félix, referenced in his obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. His first wife, married in 1941, was lawyer&#x27;s daughter Jean Mary Hore, who was sent to a mental hospital after an attempt on her husband&#x27;s life; she lived until 1997, having been confined for over fifty years. Jean was also the unrequited love of Paul Potts, who wrote about her in &quot;Dante Called You Beatrice&quot; (1960). In 1963 O&#x27;Connor married secondly (Anne) Nicolle Gaillard-d&#x27;Andel; &quot;Memoirs of a Public Baby&quot; is dedicated to Anna Wing, the actress and his third partner with whom he had a son, Jon, an education consultant and former teacher. O&#x27;Connor met the American heiress Panna Grady in 1967 and later settled with her in the Gard, in France, until his death in 1998. They never married. Two sons, Maxim and Félix, were born from their union.

<text>Kain Tapper (6 June 1930, in Saarijärvi – 17 August 2004) was a Finnish sculptor. He created works that are &quot;remote&quot;, evoking things contemplated from a distance. Even when small, his pieces loom like menhirs, their massiveness imposing an inhuman scale. He combined nature and natural phenomena, old folklore and modernism. He epitomised the Informalist style in Finnish sculpture. Tapper created a sculpture of Finnish poet Ilmari Kianto which has been installed near Turja&#x27;s Castle in Suomussalmi.

<text>Stara Zagora (, ) is a city in Bulgaria, and the administrative capital of Stara Zagora Province. It is located in the Upper Thracian Plain, near the cities of Kazanlak, Plovdiv, and Sliven. Its population is 121,582 making it the sixth largest city of Bulgaria, located North East of Plovdiv. 

The city has had different names previously, including &quot;Beroe, Borui, Irenepolis, Eski Zagra, Augusta Traiana,&quot; etc. The earliest traces of civilisation date back to the 7th millennium BC. Some scholars believe that the ancient Thracian city of Beroe was located on the present site of Stara Zagora. In 1968, Neolithic dwellings from the mid-6th millennium BC were discovered in the town, which are the best preserved and richest collection in Europe of its kind and have been turned into a museum.

A high density of Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlements has been identified by researchers and a ritual structure nearly 8,000 years old has also been discovered. The first copper factory in Europe and a large ore mining centre were discovered, both over 7,000 years old. The original settlement dates from the 5th-4th century B.C under the name Beroe or Beroia, founded by Philip II of Macedon. It was renamed to Ulpia Augusta Traiana during Roman rule and became the second most important city, after Philippopolis. During Marcus Aurelius&#x27; rule, many buildings have been built, art and music developed and there were statues and inscriptions of Orpheus.

The Goths defeated the Romans in the Battle of Beroe in 250 AD. During the Gothic War between 376 and 382, the Roman general, Frigeridus promptly withdrew from Beroe to Illyria. At the end of the 6th century, Beroe was destroyed, but rebuilt under the name Veroia.

During the Middle Ages, Zagore is mentioned for the first time by Byzantine historians. Irene of Athens visited the town, rebuilding it and renaming it to Irenepolis, in honour of her. By the end of the 10th century, the city was in Bulgarian hands and acquired a fully Bulgarian character. Bulgarians called the town Borui (a modified form of the Thracian Beroe).

In 1371, the city passed to Ottoman Empire, but its earliest mention was in an Ottoman document from 1430. Plagues rampaged in the 18th-19th century, as well as famine and drought, livestock pestilence, and hailstorms destroyed all crops. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-1878, the town had devastating moments, which included a massacre of the local Bulgarians, in which thousands of people lost their lives, young women and girls being sold in the slave market of the Ottoman Empire.

In modern times, the city is relieved, as a growing city. The economy is developing like major cities in Bulgaria, with one of the highest wages in the country, high GDP in comparison with many Bulgarian cities, low unemployment of about 4%. The city is also located near the largest energy industrial complex, Maritsa Iztok Complex, where many of the people from Stara Zagora are employed.

== Name ==
The name comes from the Slavic root &quot;star&quot; (&quot;old&quot;) and the name of the medieval region of Zagore (&quot;beyond the Balkan mountains&quot; in Slavic)

The original name was Beroe, which was changed to Ulpia Augusta Traiana by the Romans. From the 6th century the city was called Vereja and, from 784, Irenopolis (Greek: Ειρηνούπολις) in honour of the Byzantine empress Irene of Athens. In the Middle Ages it was called Boruj by the Bulgarians and later, Železnik. The Turks called it Eski Hisar (old fort) and Eski Zagra, from which its current name derives, assigned in 1871.

Beroe Hill on Livingston Island, West Antarctica, is named after this city, in its previous incarnation as Beroe.

== History ==

=== Neolithic Age ===

The earliest traces of civilisation in the region of Stara Zagora date back to the end of the 7th millennium B.C. Then, almost simultaneously, four prehistoric settlements emerged on the present territory of Stara Zagora and its surroundings, one of which was the largest in the Bulgarian lands for 6 thousand years. Some scholars believe that the ancient Thracian Beroe was located there.

In 1968, Neolithic dwellings from the mid-6th millennium BC were discovered in the town, which are the best preserved and richest collection in Europe and have been turned into a museum.

A high density of Neolithic and Chalcolithic settlements has been identified, with over 120 prehistoric settlements and 5 prehistoric settlement mounds, with numerous finds, one of them being the largest in Europe. Life here began in the late 7th millennium BC and continued until the 12th century AD.

Near Stara Zagora, a ritual structure nearly 8,000 years old has also been discovered.

During extensive excavations in the 1970s near Stara Zagora, the world&#x27;s largest ore mining centre was also discovered in the 5th millennium BC. These metal mines, the oldest in Europe, are nearly 7,600 years old. In 2014, archaeologists from the Regional History Museum (Stara Zagora) discovered the first copper factory in Europe, over 7,000 years old.

The original Thracian settlement dates from the 5-4th century BC when it was called Beroe or Beroia.

The city was founded by Philip II of Macedon in 342 BC.
=== Antiquity ===
Under the Roman Empire, the city was renamed &quot;Ulpia Augusta Traiana&quot; in honour of emperor Trajan.
The city grew to its largest extent under Marcus Aurelius (161-180) and became the second most important city in the Roman province of Thrace after Philippopolis (Trimontium). Its status and importance is evidenced by the visits of several emperors including Septimius Severus (193-211), Caracalla (211-217), and Diocletian (294-305). The city became the second largest economic, administrative and cultural centre in the province. The famous Roman historian Ammianus Marcellinus wrote: &quot;The great cities of Philippopolis and Augusta Traiana, which in antiquity were called Eumolpiada and Beroea, adorn the province of Thrace&quot;. The city has an independent municipal government, a city council and a people&#x27;s assembly and enjoys a special status. By special order, it was in this city that the veterans of the wars fought by the Roman Empire settled. During the reign of Emperor Marcus Aurelius (161-180), straight streets, dozens of residential and public buildings, city walls enclosing an area of about 50 hectares and reinforced with about 40 towers, of which 11 have been excavated, water supply, sewerage, theatre building, temples, markets, odeon, thermae, forum were built in the city. A theatron with marble seats was also built, from which the spectacular gladiatorial battles, processions, celebrations, or assemblies where the important affairs of the city were decided, were observed. A gymnasium existed in the city, and sporting events were held in the stadium. The arts and musics developed in the city, as evidenced by the examples of bronze and stone sculpture, jewellery, pottery, glass objects, statues and inscriptions for Orpheus that have been found.

The Battle of Beroe was fought near the city in 250 resulting in a Gothic Victory. It was probably after this event that the city walls were doubled like other cities in the region (e.g. Diocletianopolis, Serdica).

In the 2nd-3rd century the city had its own coin mint showing its importance.

In 377, in the Gothic War (376-382), the Goths marched on Beroe to attack the Roman general Frigiderus but his scouts detected the invaders and he promptly withdrew to Illyria. The city was destroyed but rebuilt by Justinian.
During the period of Late Antiquity (4th-6th centuries) the town was again named Beroe. The times are connected with the relocation of the capital of the empire from Rome to Constantinople, the accelerated Christianization of the local population, the Gothic invasions at the end of the 4th century and the devastating raids of the Huns in the middle of the 5th century.

In late antiquity, a mass Christianization of the local population began in Beroe, especially after the Medo-Latin Edict. The town was one of the most active centres of early Christianity. The first to introduce Christianity here was the apostle Carpus, one of the 70 apostles of Jesus Christ and a disciple of the apostle Paul. Beroe became the seat of a bishopric, which grew into an archbishopric. Bishop Demophilus of Beroe takes part in the Serdika Church Council. In 355, the Roman Pope Liberius was exiled to Beroe, and Demophilus went to Constantinople, where he reached the highest rank - Patriarch of the Byzantine Empire.

In the 6th century, the city is mentioned as Beroe in the Gothic calendar under the date 19 November, associated with the famous 40 female martyrs. At the end of the century, the town was again destroyed, but then rebuilt and took the name Vereia.

=== Middle Ages ===
For the first time the Zagore area is mentioned in the accounts of George Amartole, repeated by Symeon Logothete, George Kedrenos and Symeon the Metaphrast, where the help that Tervel&#x27;s Bulgarian army gave to Emperor Justinian II in his restoration to the Constantinople throne is described. On this occasion, in 705, a peace treaty was signed between the Byzantine Empire and Bulgaria, according to which the Zagore region was ceded to Bulgaria. Three years later, according to other sources, Justinian II tried to regain the area, but was defeated near Anchialos. According to the later accounts of Theophanes the Confessor, in 716 a new treaty was concluded between the new emperor Theodosius III and Tervel, according to which, in addition to the area of Zagore finally ceded to the Bulgarians, another part of Thrace was ceded to the west of Zagore, as far as the &quot;Mileon in Thrace&quot;. In 717. In 717 Tervel gave new aid to the empire with a large army and defeated the Umayyad Caliphate that had besieged Constantinople. After that, Beroe repeatedly passed now to Byzantium, now to Bulgaria.
In 784 Beroe was in the possession of the Byzantine Empire and the empress Irene visited the town together with her son Constantine VI and a large retinue of courtiers. The empress rebuilt the town and called it Irenopolis - the city of Irena. The chronicler Theophanes the Confessor describes the visit of the empress to Beroe: &quot;In that year, in the month of January, ind. seven, the said Stavracius returned from the land of the warehouses and on the hippodrome celebrated his victory with triumph. And in the month of May, of the same seventh Ind. the Empress Irene with her son and many troops went out into Thrace, bringing with her musical instruments, and came to Beroe. She ordered that this city should be built up, and renamed it Irenopolis.&quot;

John&#x27;s Byzantine army, and many of the captives, were settled as foederati within the Byzantine frontier.

In 812 Irenopolis was Bulgarian again and was called Beroe after the victorious war of Krum in 812. Historical sources show that after the peace treaty of 817, the Bulgarian state took extensive measures to defend and fortify the area south of the Balkan Mountains from Beroe to the sea in order to annex it permanently to Bulgaria. By 850 - 860 Beroe was Bulgarian and the population was already majority Bulgarian by this time. For a few years the Byzantines took Zagore, but during the conversion of Knyaz Boris I in 864, the Zagora area and the town of Beroe were returned to Bulgaria. The chronicles about the return of the district also state its borders - from Sider (Zhelezni vrata, today Zmeyovski Pass) to Debelt. Within the borders of Bulgaria, the town was the centre of a comitatus and retained its role as one of the largest administrative, economic and religious centres. The emperors lived here for a long time and used Boruyi as a second capital. For two centuries it was the residence of the Byzantine emperors of the Komnenos family. From here they organized campaigns against the northern invaders - the Pechenegs and Cumans.

The stone reliefs from Stara Zagora from the 8th - 9th centuries are of high cultural and historical value, they are recognized as a masterpiece of fine art and are one of the most interesting archaeological finds in Europe.

By the end of the 10th century, the city was in Bulgarian hands and acquired a fully Bulgarian character. Bulgarians called the town Borui (a modified form of the Thracian Beroe).

The traveller Al-Idrisi, who visited the town, reported that in the 11th-12th centuries the road from the town of Veroi to the now unidentified town of Patsimiscus passed through successive fields of crops, continuous cultivated fields, large villages, many vineyards, orchards, past numerous herds of sheep, cattle and small livestock. During the Crusades, when the troops of Frederick I Barbarossa were passing through the Balkans, the Austrian priest Ansbert, who had access to the imperial chancellery, wrote of the town of Vereia as a &quot;large, rich city&quot; which the crusaders captured, sacked, and burned.

In 1208 the Bulgarians defeated the Latin Empire in the battle of Boruy, also fought nearby.

===Ottoman rule===

The Ottomans conquered Stara Zagora in 1371. The earliest Ottoman document mentioning the town is from 1430. The Ottomans, knowing about the old history of the town as the centre of the Zagore region, welded a huge amount of cultural and historical heritage in the town and in the early years named it with various similar names - Zagr and Atik (Ancient Zagra), Zagra and Atik Hisar (Ancient City of Zagra), Zagra, Zagra and Eski Hisar, Zagral Eskisi (Old Zagra), Eski Zagora (Ancient Zagora), Zagrasi Atik, Zagralie Eskisi, Eskisi Zagora (Old Zagora). Later, however, in the seventeenth century, a single form - Eski Zagra. According to Evliya Celebi, in the 17th century there were 3000 houses in Stara Zagora, about 760 roads and 14 neighborhoods. At that time there were 5 mosques. There was also 1 madrasah, 42 schools, 5 hamams (named Alaja, Pasha, Yeni, Chifte and Kyuchuk hamams), 1 besisten and 855 dukhans. It does not mention the presence of a Bulgarian population in the city, although there is evidence of tombstones with Bulgarian names. Further evidence of this is a surviving Greek inscription in the church of St. Demetrius, which indicates the presence of a church on this site long before 1743, serving the Christian population.

In 1738 the population of Stara Zagora was predominantly Turkish. In 1788, a plague epidemic raged, and in 1792, famine and drought, livestock pestilence, and hailstorms destroyed all crops. During this time, military contingents passed through the settlements for punitive purposes, &#x27;stripping the naked man of his shirt and the barefoot man of his shoes&#x27;. The worst years, however, were 1813, 1814 and 1815: these were the plague years known as the &#x27;Great Plague&#x27; or &#x27;Great Carron&#x27;. The next plague epidemic came in 1837 and was called &#x27;The Little Plague&#x27;.
A grade school was built in 1840 and the city&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Zheleznik&quot; (; a Slavic translation of &quot;Beroe&quot;) in 1854 instead of the Turkish (Also called Zağra-i Atik), but was renamed once again to &quot;Stara Zagora&quot; in 1870. It was an administrative centre in Edirne Vilayet before 1878 as &quot;Zağra-i Atik&quot;.

==== Stara Zagora Uprising ====

The Herzegovina uprising in 1875 prompted Bulgarian revolutionaries to become active. On 12 August 1875, on the initiative of Hristo Botev and Stefan Stambolov, an extraordinary national assembly was held in Bucharest, which decided to declare an immediate armed uprising in Bulgaria. Stara Zagora was chosen as the centre of the uprising. Kolyo Ganchev was elected the leader of the uprising in the town. The uprising was dispersed by the Ottomans, but served as an impetus for the liberation through the April Uprising in 1876.

=== Battle and Stara Zagora massacre ===

On 31 July 1877, the first major battle of the Russo-Turkish War took place near Stara Zagora. The 48,000-strong Turkish army advanced on the town, which was defended only by a small Russian detachment and a unit of Bulgarian volunteers. After a six-hour fight for Stara Zagora, the Russian soldiers and Bulgarian volunteers surrendered to the pressure of the larger enemy army. The town then experienced its greatest tragedy when the Turkish army carried out a massacre against the unarmed civilians. The city was burned down and razed to the ground during three ensuing days of carnage. 14,500 Bulgarians from the town and villages south of the town lost their lives. Another 10,000 young women and girls were sold in the slave markets of the Ottoman Empire. All Christian churches were attacked with artillery and burned. The only public building surviving the fire was the mosque, Eski Dzhamiya, which still stands today. Several monuments in modern Stara Zagora commemorate these events.

=== Eastern Rumelia ===
After the Liberation of Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in 1878, Stara Zagora became part of autonomous Eastern Rumelia as a department centre before the two Bulgarian states finally merged in 1886 as a result of the Unification of Bulgaria. The reconstruction of Stara Zagora began immediately after the Liberation. For this purpose, in 1878, the famous architect from Austria-Hungary, Lubor Bayer, arrived in Stara Zagora and designed the modern rectangular checkerboard layout characteristic of today&#x27;s Stara Zagora. On October 5, 1879, the governor general of Eastern Rumelia Alexander Bogoridi laid the symbolic first stone for the reconstruction of the town. The only other town in Bulgaria with such a spatial plan was Nova Zagora, which was also burnt by the Turks.

===Ancient monuments===

* City walls

==Population==

Stara Zagora was possibly the biggest city in today&#x27;s Bulgarian territory before liberation from Ottoman rule. But the city was burned and destroyed by Turkish army during the Liberation war in 1877–1878, with some 30,000 citizens from Stara Zagora and nearby villages perishing in the Stara Zagora massacre. During the first decade after the liberation of Bulgaria, in the 1880s the population of Stara Zagora decreased and numbered about 16,000. Since then it started growing decade by decade, mostly because of the migrants from the rural areas and the surrounding smaller towns, reaching its peak in the period 1989-1991 exceeding 160,000. After this time, the population has started decreasing mostly because of the migration to the capital city of Sofia or abroad.

==Coat of arms==

The coat of arms of Stara Zagora was created in 1979 for the 100th anniversary of the rebuilding of the town, when the municipality made a decision to create a new coat of arms. The task of composing it was given to artist Hristo Tanev. (Another source states that it was adopted in 1996.)

The symbolic meaning of the shield is to protect, defend and provide sanctuary. To emphasize this the upper edge of the shield is shaped like a castle wall.

The central part, on a red background, depicts a mother lion suckling a lion cub. This image has been taken from a 12th-century rock carving found in Stara Zagora in 1949 which has become one of the city symbols. The lioness, representing the mother instinct, is placed in the central part of the shield, and has not only historical but symbolic meaning, to show that despite what the city has been through in the past thousands of year it still continues its existence and continues its progress. The lower part of the shield has a green background with golden-yellow stripes which converging towards the center. This represents the fertility of the town&#x27;s fields and is also a symbol of roads to the future.

<text>Pola Negri (; born Barbara Apolonia Chałupiec ; 3 January 1897 – 1 August 1987) was a Polish stage and film actress and singer. She achieved worldwide fame during the silent and golden eras of Hollywood and European film for her tragedienne and femme fatale roles. She was also acknowledged as a sex symbol of her time.

Raised in the Congress Kingdom of Poland, Negri&#x27;s childhood was marked by several personal hardships: After her father was sent to Siberia, she was raised by her single mother in poverty, and suffered tuberculosis as a teenager. Negri recovered, and went on to study ballet and acting in Warsaw, Poland, becoming a well-known stage actress there. In 1917, she relocated to Germany, where she began appearing in silent films for the Berlin-based UFA studio. Her film performances for UFA came to the attention of Hollywood executives at Paramount Pictures, who offered her a film contract.

Negri signed with Paramount in 1922, making her the first European actress to be contracted in Hollywood. She spent much of the 1920s working in the United States appearing in numerous films for Paramount, establishing herself as one of the most popular actresses in American silent film. In the 1930s, during the emergence of sound film, Negri returned to Europe, where she appeared in multiple films for Pathé Films and UFA, and also began a career as a recording artist. She made only two films after 1940, her last screen credit being in Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Moon-Spinners&quot; (1964).

Negri spent her later life largely outside the public sphere. She became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1951, and spent the remainder of her life living in San Antonio, Texas. In 1987, aged 90, she died of pneumonia secondary to a brain tumor for which she refused treatment.

==Early life==
Negri was born Barbara Apolonia Chałupiec on 3 January 1897 in Lipno, Congress Poland, Russian Empire (present-day Lipno, Poland), the only surviving child (of three) of a Polish mother, Eleonora Kiełczewska (died 24 August 1954). According to Negri, her mother came from impoverished Polish nobility, with her family having lost their fortune over support of Napoléon Bonaparte. Negri&#x27;s father, Juraj Chalupec (Polish transcription Jerzy Chałupec or Chałupiec, died 1920), was an itinerant Romani-Slovak tinsmith from Nesluša. After her father was arrested by the Russian authorities for revolutionary activities and sent to Siberia, she and her mother moved to Warsaw, where they lived in poverty, with her mother supporting them by working as a cook.

Chałupiec was raised Catholic by her mother, who was a lifelong practicing Catholic. In her youth, Chałupiec was accepted into Warsaw&#x27;s Imperial Ballet Academy. Her first dance performance was in the &quot;danse des petits cygnes&quot; in Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;Swan Lake&quot;; she worked her way up to a solo role in the Saint-Léon ballet &quot;Coppélia&quot;. However, a bout with tuberculosis forced her to stop dancing; she was sent to a sanatorium in Zakopane to recover. During her three-month convalescence, she adopted the pseudonym &quot;Pola Negri&quot;, after the Italian novelist and poet Ada Negri; &quot;Pola&quot; was short for her own name, Apolonia (sometimes spelled Apollonia).

==Career==
===Polish theatre and film===
After Negri returned from the sanatorium, she successfully auditioned at the Warsaw Imperial Academy of Dramatic Arts. Alongside her formal schooling at the academy, she took private classes outside with renowned Polish stage actress and professor Honorata Leszczyńska. She made her theatrical debut before her graduation at The Small Theatre in Warsaw on 2 October 1912.

She made her stage debut in 1913 in Gerhardt Hauptmann&#x27;s &quot;Hannele&quot; in Warsaw and appeared the following year in her first film, &quot;Niewolnica zmysłów&quot;. She continued to perform there while finishing her studies at the academy, graduating in 1914. Her graduating performance was as Hedwig in Ibsen&#x27;s &quot;The Wild Duck&quot;, which resulted in offers to join a number of the prominent theatres in Warsaw.

By the end of World War I, Negri had established herself as a popular stage actress. She made an appearance at the Grand Theatre in &quot;Sumurun&quot;, as well as in the Small Theatre (Aleksander Fredro&#x27;s &quot;Śluby panieńskie&quot;), and at the Summer Theatre in the Saxon Garden. She debuted in film in 1914 in &quot;Slave to her Senses&quot; (&quot;Niewolnica zmysłów&quot;). She appeared in a variety of films made by the Warsaw film industry, including &quot;Bestia&quot; (&quot;Beast&quot;, released in the US as &quot;The Polish Dancer&quot;), &quot;Room No. 13&quot; (&quot;Pokój nr 13&quot;), &quot;His Last Gesture&quot; (&quot;Jego ostatni czyn&quot;), &quot;Students&quot; (&quot;Studenci&quot;), and &quot;The Wife&quot; (&quot;Żona&quot;).

===Ernst Lubitsch and German silent film career===

Negri&#x27;s popularity in Poland provided her with an opportunity to move to Berlin, Germany in 1917, to appear as the dancing girl in a German revival of Max Reinhardt&#x27;s theatre production of &quot;Sumurun&quot;. In this production, she met Ernst Lubitsch, who at the time was producing comedies for the German film studio UFA. Negri was first signed with Saturn Films, making six films with them, including &quot;Wenn das Herz in Haß erglüht&quot; (&quot;If the Heart Burns With Hate&quot;, 1917). After this, she signed to UFA&#x27;s roster; some of the films that she made with UFA include &quot;Mania&quot; (1918), &quot;Der Gelbe Schein&quot; (&quot;The Yellow Ticket&quot;, also 1918), and &quot;Komtesse Doddy&quot; (1919).

In 1918, Lubitsch convinced UFA to let him create a large-scale film with Negri as the main character. The result was &quot;Die Augen der Mumie Ma&quot; (&quot;The Eyes of the Mummy Ma&quot;, 1918), which was a popular success and led to a series of Lubitsch/Negri collaborations, each larger in scale than the previous film. The next was &quot;Carmen&quot; (1918, reissued in the United States in 1921 as &quot;Gypsy Blood&quot;), which was followed by &quot;Madame DuBarry&quot; (1919, released in the U.S. as &quot;Passion&quot;). &quot;Madame DuBarry&quot; became a huge international success, brought down the American embargo on German films, and launched a demand that briefly threatened to dislodge Hollywood&#x27;s dominance in the international film market. Negri and Lubitsch made three German films together after this, &quot;Sumurun&quot; (aka &quot;One Arabian Night&quot;, 1920), &quot;Die Bergkatze&quot; (aka &quot;The Mountain Cat&quot; or &quot;The Wildcat&quot;, 1921), and &quot;Die Flamme&quot; (&quot;The Flame&quot;, 1922), and UFA employed Negri for films with other directors, including &quot;Vendetta&quot; (1919) and &quot;Sappho&quot; (1921), many of which were purchased by American distributors and shown in the United States.

Hollywood responded to this new threat by buying out key German talent, beginning with the procuration of the services of Lubitsch and Negri. Lubitsch was the first director to be brought to Hollywood, with Mary Pickford calling for his services in her costume film &quot;Rosita&quot; (1923). Paramount Pictures mogul Jesse Lasky saw the premiere of &quot;Madame DuBarry&quot; in Berlin in 1919, and Paramount invited Negri to come to Hollywood in 1921. She signed a $3,000 a week contract with Paramount and arrived in New York in a flurry of publicity on 12 September 1922. This made Negri the first-ever Continental star to be imported into Hollywood, setting a precedent for imported European stars that included Vilma Bánky, Greta Garbo, and Marlene Dietrich, among many others. &quot;The Hot Dog&quot;, a Cleveland monthly publication, in its own promotional advertisement for Paramount in February 1922, claimed Negri&#x27;s true name was Paula Schwartz, and that she was Jewish, which was completely untrue.&lt;ref name=&quot;polanegri.com/bio&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Paramount period===

Negri ended up becoming one of the most popular Hollywood actresses of the era, and certainly the richest woman of the film industry at the time, living in a mansion in Los Angeles modeled after the White House. While in Hollywood, she started several ladies&#x27; fashion trends, some of which are still fashion staples today, including red painted toenails, fur boots, and turbans. Negri was a frequent photography subject of Hollywood portrait photographer Eugene Robert Richee, and several photographs of her were taken during this period.

Negri&#x27;s first two Paramount films were &quot;Bella Donna&quot; (1923) and &quot;The Cheat&quot; (1923), both of which were directed by George Fitzmaurice and were remakes of Paramount films from 1915. Her first spectacle film was the Herbert Brenon-directed &quot;The Spanish Dancer&quot; (1923), based on the Victor Hugo novel &quot;Don César de Bazan&quot;. The initial screenplay was intended as a vehicle for Rudolph Valentino before he left Paramount and was reworked for Negri. &quot;Rosita&quot;, Lubitsch&#x27;s film with Mary Pickford, was released the same year and happened to be based on &quot;Don César de Bazan&quot;. According to the book &quot;Paramount Pictures and the People Who Made Them,&quot; &quot;Critics had a field day comparing the two. The general opinion was that the Pickford film was more polished, but the Negri film was more entertaining.&quot;

Initially Paramount used Negri as a mysterious European femme fatale and a clotheshorse as they had done with Gloria Swanson and staged an ongoing feud between the two actresses, which actor Charlie Chaplin recalled in his autobiography as &quot;a mélange of cooked-up jealousies and quarrels.&quot; Negri was concerned that Paramount was mishandling her career and image and arranged for her former director Ernst Lubitsch to direct her in the critically acclaimed &quot;Forbidden Paradise&quot; (1924). It was the last time the two worked together in any film. By 1925, Negri&#x27;s on-screen continental opulence was starting to wear thin with some segments of the American audience, a situation parodied in the Mal St. Clair-directed comedy &quot;A Woman of the World&quot; (1925), in which Negri starred.
In 1926, Negri starred in &quot;The Crown of Lies&quot; and &quot;Good and Naughty&quot;, the former of which earned an unfavorable review in &quot;Photoplay&quot; magazine, which deemed it an &quot;impossible Pola Negri vehicle. If you have nothing else to do—see this and suffer with Pola.&quot; Paramount transitioned into casting Negri in international peasant roles the following year in films such as the Mauritz Stiller-directed and Erich Pommer-produced &quot;Hotel Imperial&quot; (1927), in an apparent effort to give her a more down-to-earth, relatable image. Although &quot;Hotel Imperial&quot; reportedly fared well at the box office, her next film &quot;Barbed Wire&quot; (1927), directed by Rowland V. Lee, and a number of subsequent films did not, reportedly due to negative publicity about her behavior at Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s funeral (she fainted a few times and cried exaggeratedly) and her rebound marriage to Georgian prince Serge Mdivani, although her films continued to fare well internationally. Negri defended herself, saying: &quot;It is difficult for a foreigner coming to America...I had been told so much what not to do. It was particularly difficult for me, a Slav. My emotion seemed exaggerated to Americans. I cannot help that I haven&#x27;t the Anglo-Saxon restraint and tact.&quot;

In 1928 Negri was earning $10,000 a week, and was directed by Rowland V. Lee in another three films (&quot;The Secret Hour&quot;, &quot;Three Sinners&quot;, and &quot;Loves of an Actress&quot;), before making her last film for Paramount Pictures, &quot;The Woman from Moscow&quot;, with Norman Kerry. Negri claimed in her autobiography she opted not to renew her contract with Paramount, choosing to retire from films and live as a wife at the Château de Rueil-Seraincourt, near Vigny that she owned and where she had married her second husband. The same year, her short volume featuring reflections on art and film, &quot;La Vie et Le Rêve au Cinéma&quot; ( English: &quot;Life and Dreams of the Cinema&quot;), edited by Albin Michel, was published. By 1929, she had reportedly earned $5 million.

===Later films; return to UFA===

Negri&#x27;s initial 1928 retirement turned out to be short-lived. She miscarried and later learned that her husband was gambling her fortune away on speculative business ventures, which strained their relationship. She went back to acting when an independent production company offered her work in a British film production that was to be distributed by Gaumont-British. Initially the film was to be a filmed version of George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Caesar and Cleopatra&quot;, and Shaw offered to alter the play to suit the film. When the rights proved to be too expensive, the company settled on an original story and hired German &quot;Kammerspielfilm&quot; director Paul Czinner to direct. The resulting film, &quot;The Way of Lost Souls&quot; (also known as &quot;The Woman He Scorned&quot;), was released in 1929; it was Negri&#x27;s final silent film.

Negri returned to Hollywood in 1931 to begin filming her first talking film, &quot;A Woman Commands&quot; (1932). The film itself was poorly received, but Negri&#x27;s rendition of the song &quot;Paradise&quot;, the centerpiece of the film, became a sizable hit in the sheet music format. The song became a minor standard and was covered by many other performers, including Russ Columbo, Louis Prima and Keely Smith. Negri went on a successful vaudeville tour to promote the song. She then was employed in the leading role of the touring theatre production &quot;A Trip to Pressburg&quot;, which premiered at the Shubert Theatre in New York. However, she collapsed after the final curtain at the production&#x27;s stop in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, due to gallbladder inflammation, and was unable to complete the tour. Negri returned to France to appear in &quot;Fanatisme&quot; (Fanaticism, 1934), a historical costume film about Napoleon III. The film was directed by the directorial team of Tony Lekain and Gaston Ravel and released by Pathé. It was her only French film.

After this, actor-director Willi Forst brought Negri to Germany to appear in the film &quot;Mazurka&quot; (1935). The film was considered &quot;artistically valuable&quot; (German: &quot;künstlerisch wertvoll&quot;) by the Reichsfilmkammer. &quot;Mazurka&quot; gained much popularity in Germany and abroad and became one of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s favorite films, a fact that, along with her admiring comments about the efficiency of the German film industry, gave birth to a rumor in 1937 of Negri having had an affair with Hitler. Negri sued &quot;Pour Vous&quot;, the French magazine which had circulated the rumor, for libel, and won. &quot;Mazurka&quot; was remade (almost shot-for-shot) in the U.S. as &quot;Confession&quot; (1937), starring Kay Francis.
After the success of &quot;Mazurka&quot;, Negri&#x27;s former studio, the now Joseph Goebbels-controlled UFA, signed Negri to a new contract. Negri lived in France while working for UFA, making five films with the company: &quot;Moscow–Shanghai&quot; (1936), &quot;Madame Bovary&quot;, &quot;Tango Notturno&quot; (both 1937), &quot;Die fromme Lüge&quot; (&quot;The Secret Lie&quot;, 1938), and &quot;Die Nacht der Entscheidung&quot; (&quot;The Night of Decision&quot;, 1938).

After the Nazis took over France, Negri fled back to the United States. During her flight, she spent some days in Portugal. She stayed in Monte Estoril, at the Hotel Atlântico, between 28 June and 30 June 1940. The following day she moved to Estoril&#x27;s Hotel Palácio. She sailed to New York from Lisbon, Portugal, and initially lived by selling off jewelry. She was hired in a supporting role as the temperamental opera singer Genya Smetana for the 1943 comedy &quot;Hi Diddle Diddle&quot;. After the success of this film, Negri was offered numerous roles which were essentially rehashes of her role in &quot;Hi Diddle Diddle&quot;, all of which she turned down as derivative. In 1944, Negri was engaged by booking agent Miles Ingalls for a nationwide vaudeville tour. According to her autobiography, she also appeared in a Boston supper club engagement in 1945 for a repertoire centered around the song &quot;Paradise&quot;, and retired from the entertainment business altogether.

===Retirement and final appearances===
In 1948, director Billy Wilder approached Negri to appear as Norma Desmond in the film &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950), after Mae Murray, Mae West, Greta Garbo, Norma Shearer, and Mary Pickford declined the role. Negri reportedly declined the role and was aghast that Paramount could even suggest that she was a &quot;has been&quot;. She also felt that the screenplay was not ready and that Montgomery Clift, who was slated to play the Joe Gillis character at the time, was not a good choice for the character. The role of Gillis eventually went to William Holden, and Gloria Swanson accepted the role of Norma Desmond.

Negri came out of retirement to appear in the Walt Disney film &quot;The Moon-Spinners&quot; (1964), which starred Hayley Mills and Eli Wallach. Negri&#x27;s appearance in the film as eccentric jewel collector Madame Habib was shot in London over the course of two weeks. While she was filming &quot;The Moon-Spinners&quot; she made a sensation by appearing before the London press at her hotel in the company of a feisty cheetah, which had also appeared in the film, on a steel chain leash. The same year, she received an honorary award from the German film industry for her film work, followed by a Hemis-Film award in San Antonio in 1968. In 1970 she published her autobiography &quot;Memoirs of a Star&quot;, published by Doubleday. She made an appearance at the Museum of Modern Art on 30 April 1970, for a screening event in her honor, which featured her film &quot;A Woman of the World&quot; (1925) and selections from her films. Negri was a guest of honor at the 1972 screening of &quot;Carmen&quot; held at the Witte Museum in San Antonio.
In 1975, director Vincente Minnelli approached Negri to appear as the Contessa Sanziani in &quot;A Matter of Time&quot;, but Negri did not accept due to poor health. In 1978, Billy Wilder directed &quot;Fedora&quot;, and although Negri does not appear in the film, the title character was reportedly based largely on her. Her final high-profile coverage in her lifetime was for a &quot;Where Are They Now?&quot; feature on silent film stars, which appeared in &quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1980.

==Personal life==

Negri&#x27;s first marriage was with Count Eugeniusz Dąbski, and proved to be short-lived. Negri married Dąbski in St Mary&#x27;s Assumption Church in Sosnowiec on 5 November 1919, thus becoming Countess Apolonia Dąbska-Chałupec. After a long separation period, Negri and Dąbski&#x27;s union was dissolved in 1922.

After she began working in the United States, she made headlines and gossip columns with a string of celebrity love affairs, most notably with film stars Charlie Chaplin, Rod La Rocque, and Rudolph Valentino. Negri had met Chaplin while in Germany, and what began as a platonic relationship became a well-publicized affair and marriage speculation which received the headline &quot;The Queen of Tragedy to Wed the King of Comedy.&quot; The relationship soured, and Negri became involved for a time with actor Rod La Rocque, who appeared as her leading man in &quot;Forbidden Paradise&quot; (1924). Negri met Rudolph Valentino at a costume party held by Marion Davies and William Randolph Hearst at the San Simeon estate and was reportedly Valentino&#x27;s lover until his death in 1926. She caused a media sensation at his New York funeral on 24 August 1926, at which she &quot;fainted&quot; several times, and according to actor Ben Lyon, arranged for a large floral arrangement that spelled &quot;P-O-L-A&quot; to be placed on Valentino&#x27;s coffin. The press dismissed her actions as a publicity stunt. At the time of his death and for the remainder of her life, Negri claimed Valentino was the love of her life.

Just before the Wall Street crash of 1929, The New York Times estimated Negri&#x27;s personal worth at $5 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;stmarytx/silent-no-longer&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;


Negri soon married again, to the Georgian self-styled &quot;Prince&quot; Serge Mdivani. This action caused public opinion in the United States to sour against her because it happened so quickly after Rudolph Valentino&#x27;s death. Negri and Mdivani were married on 14 May 1927 (less than nine months after Valentino&#x27;s death); shortly after she became pregnant, and Negri, who always wanted a child, started taking better care of her health and even considered retiring from movies in order to be a housewife and mother. However, she reportedly suffered a miscarriage. She grieved the loss of her child for the rest of her life; she and Mdivani divorced on 2 April 1931.

While residing at the Ambassador Hotel in New York in April 1932, Negri performed with Russ Columbo in George Jessel&#x27;s variety revue at the Schubert Theatre and was briefly involved with Columbo. After her film &quot;A Woman Commands&quot; premiered in Hollywood, Columbo performed Negri&#x27;s signature song &quot;Paradise&quot; with his orchestra and dedicated the song to her. Columbo also recorded and released the song as a 78 rpm single that year with slightly altered lyrics, and the single became a huge sensation with audiences across the country.

When Negri returned to the United States in the early 1940s, she became close friends with Margaret West, an oil heiress, former radio star, and vaudeville actress, whom she had originally met in the 1930s. The two became housemates, sharing a beachfront home in Los Angeles with Negri&#x27;s then-88-year-old mother, and later in Bel Air. Negri, who remained a devout Catholic in her later life, spent her time raising funds for Catholic charities with both her mother and West. On 12 January 1951, Negri became a naturalized citizen of the United States. After the death of Negri&#x27;s mother in 1954 of pancreatic cancer, in 1957, Negri and West relocated from Los Angeles to a suite in the Menger Hotel, San Antonio, Texas and later to a large home in Olmos Park, Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;memoriesofsanantonio/pola-negri&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Negri lived with West until the latter&#x27;s death of heart failure in 1963. Negri moved out of the home she had shared with West into a townhouse located at 7707 Broadway in San Antonio, where she spent the remainder of her years, largely out of the public eye.

Some scholars, such as Emily Leider, a Rudolph Valentino biographer, have suggested that Negri was bisexual, and that she and West, who lived together from 1948 to 1963 were romantic partners. Negri biographer Sergio Delgado contests this, though he notes in his 2016 book &quot;Pola Negri: Temptress of Silent Hollywood&quot;, that there is &quot;strong anecdotal evidence&quot; that Negri was bisexual.

==Death==

Pola Negri died on 1 August 1987, aged 90 at the Northeast Baptist Hospital in San Antonio, Texas. Her death was caused by pneumonia for which she had been rushed to the hospital a week earlier; however, she was also suffering from a brain tumor, for which she had refused treatment for two years. At her wake at the Porter Loring Funeral Home in San Antonio, her body was placed on view wearing a yellow golden chiffon dress with a golden turban to match. Her death received extensive coverage in her hometown newspapers &quot;San Antonio Light&quot;, and &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot;, and in publications such as &quot;The Washington Post&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost/1987/08/03/pola-negri-dies&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes/1987-08-09-ca-2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The New York Times&quot;, UPI,&lt;ref name=&quot;upi/9885554875200/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Variety&quot;.

Negri was interred in Calvary Cemetery, East Los Angeles next to her mother Eleonora, who died in 1954 from pancreatic cancer. As Negri had no children or siblings, she left most of her estate to St. Mary&#x27;s University, in Texas, including a collection of memorabilia and several rare prints of her films. St. Mary&#x27;s University also set up a scholarship in her name. In addition, a generous portion of her estate was given to the Polish nuns of the Seraphic Order.

==Legacy==
Negri has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contribution to Motion Pictures at 6933 Hollywood Boulevard. She was the 11th star in Hollywood history to place her hand and foot prints in front of Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre. She received a star in Poland&#x27;s Walk of Fame(pl) in Łódź and Poland&#x27;s post office issued a postage stamp honoring her in 1996. The Polish Film Festival of Los Angeles remembered her with the Pola Negri Award, given to outstanding film artists, and the Pola Negri Museum in Lipno gives a Polita award for outstanding artist achievement. 

Negri, with Theda Bara and Mae Murray, were the actresses whose eyes were combined to form the Chicago International Film Festival&#x27;s logo, a stark, black and white close up of the composite eyes set as repeated frames in a strip of film. It was created by Festival Founder and Artistic Director Michael Kutza.
Negri (portrayed by an uncredited dancer/actress) makes a cameo appearance in the TV film &quot;Young Indiana Jones and the Hollywood Follies&quot;. In the film, Indiana Jones and Claire Lieberman attend a Hollywood party, where they spot Negri dancing with Valentino.

In 2006, a feature-length documentary about Negri&#x27;s life, &quot;Pola Negri: Life Is a Dream in Cinema&quot;, premiered at the Seventh Annual Polish Film Festival of Los Angeles. The film was directed by Negri&#x27;s biographer, Mariusz Kotowski, and includes in-depth interviews with Hayley Mills and Eli Wallach, who starred in Negri&#x27;s final film &quot;The Moon-Spinners&quot; (1964). &quot;Pola Negri: Life Is a Dream in Cinema&quot; has played at Negri retrospective screenings in Europe and the U.S., most notably at the Museum of Modern Art in New York and at the Cinémathèque Française in Paris.

Kotowski wrote a Polish-language biography of Negri titled &quot;Pola Negri: Legenda Hollywood&quot; (English title: &quot;Pola Negri: Hollywood Legend&quot;), released in Poland on 24 February 2011, and an English-language biography &quot;Pola Negri: Hollywood&#x27;s First Femme Fatale&quot;, published by the University Press of Kentucky on 8 April 2014. Kotowski produced a 3-disc DVD compilation of early Negri films, &quot;Pola Negri, The Iconic Collection: The Early Years&quot; (2011).

A large black and white portrait of Negri hangs in the small chapel of the Seraphic Sisters of the Third Order of St. Francis of Assisi Congregation,&lt;ref name=&quot;texashillcountry/san-antonios-shrine&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; next to Poland&#x27;s patron, at Shrine of Our Lady of Częstochowa, at 138 Beethoven Street, in San Antonio.&lt;ref name=&quot;tampabay/2000/07/23/san-antonio&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1924 portrait of Negri, by (1889–1954), son of Jan Styka, is part of the San Antonio Museum of Art″s permanent collection.&lt;ref name=&quot;sanantonio.emuseum/14158&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sacurrent/27376290&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2018, a monument to Pola Negri, was set at Our Lady of the Bright Mount Church, Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;gettyimages/1090889346&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 2021, a street in Bydgoszcz, where she briefly lived in 1920s, was named after her.

==Discography==
Negri released a total of ten 78 rpm singles. In 1931, she recorded seven gypsy folk songs in London accompanied by guitars and chorus, six of which were released as the sides of three records on Victor&#x27;s His Master&#x27;s Voice imprint. She recorded a French-language version of &quot;Paradise&quot; in Paris in 1933 with &quot;Mes Nuits sont Mortes&quot; as its flip side. (Sheet music was released for the English-language version, but the recorded version only appeared in the 1932 film, &quot;A Woman Commands&quot;, and was never released as a record.) The remainder of Negri&#x27;s recordings, cut from 1935 to 1938, centered around songs that she sang in her German sound films.

<doc id="909390" wikidata="Q12069238" url="?curid=909390" title="Sizewell">
<text>Sizewell is an English fishing hamlet in the East Suffolk district of Suffolk, England. It belongs to the civil parish of Leiston and lies on the North Sea coast just north of the larger holiday village of Thorpeness, between the coastal towns of Aldeburgh and Southwold. It is east of the town of Leiston and belongs within the Suffolk Coast and Heaths AONB. It is the site of two nuclear power stations, one of them still active. There have been tentative plans for a third station to be built at the site.

==Nuclear power stations==

The village is the location of two separate nuclear power stations, the Magnox Sizewell A and Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR) Sizewell B, which are readily visible to the north of the village. Sizewell A is decommissioned, having ceased to generate electricity in 2006. The decommissioning process is expected to take until 2027 to complete, with the site not expected to be cleared until 2098. There were plans to build a third nuclear power station nearby, but by May 2013 there were significant doubts about whether an agreement would be reached with the government. However, in October 2021, the government announced new funding rules to allow the funding to be found through the RAB (Regulated Asset Base).

&quot;Welcome to Sizewell, twinned with Chernobyl&quot; was a slogan used by anti-nuclear campaigners.

==Sizewell Marshes==

Sizewell Marshes form a 260-acre (105.4-ha) biological Site of Special Scientific Interest on the edge of Sizewell, in the Suffolk Coast and Heaths Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. They are part of a 356-acre (144-ha) nature reserve managed by the Suffolk Wildlife Trust as Sizewell Belts. It is noted for its rare invertebrates and bird species, and as one of the main wetlands in East Anglia for wild flowers.

==History==
===The hall===

The village became the nucleus of the Ogilvie estate in 1859. It extended as far south as Aldeburgh. Sizewell Hall, now used as a Christian conference centre, is still owned by the Ogilvie family. From the end of the war up to the summer of 1955 it housed a mixed, semi-progressive prep school attended, among others, by the theatre critic and biographer Sheridan Morley.

===Wartime===

The beach at Sizewell was the landing site of Henri Peteri and his brother Willem in September 1941. The brothers left the Dutch town of Katwijk in a collapsible canoe on a journey that took 56 hours. Those who escaped occupied Holland were known as &quot;Engelandvaarders&quot;. About 1,700 &quot;Engelandvaarders&quot; reached England, including about 200 who crossed the North Sea; 32 men tried to make a canoe trip like the Peteri brothers, but only eight succeeded in reaching the English coast.

In 2005, Henri Peteri commissioned a memorial to the men who made the journey across the North Sea by canoe, consisting of a pair of crossed kayak oars and a broken paddle that commemorates those who did not survive the trip. In June 2009, the monument was unveiled by his widow on Sizewell Beach, together with the original kayak.

An inscription on the broken paddle reads:
In memory of the thirty-two young Dutchmen who tried to escape to England by kayak during World War II to join the Allied Forces. Eight of them reached the English coast. Only three survived the war.

The last living survivor dedicated this memorial to his brothers in arms who were less fortunate. He reached England – and freedom – on this beach on 21 September 1941.

===Historical writings===
In 1870–1872, John Marius Wilson&#x27;s Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales described the hamlet as
In 1887, John Bartholomew wrote a shorter description of Sizewell in his &quot;Gazetteer of the British Isles&quot;:
==Facilities==
Sizewell retains a few basic services associated with tourism, including a refreshment kiosk and a public house, the &quot;Vulcan Arms&quot;. A handful of fishing boats operate from the beach.

<text>Pierre-François &quot;David&quot; Beauchard (; born 9 February 1959), also known by the pen name David B., is a French comic book artist and writer, and one of the founders of .

==Biography==
After studying advertising at the Duperré School of Applied Arts in Paris, Beauchard began working in comics in 1985 (&quot;Pas de samba pour capitaine Tonnerre&quot;), and wrote and illustrated stories in numerous magazines, including &quot;Okapi&quot;, &quot;À suivre&quot;, &quot;Tintin Reporter&quot;, and &quot;Chic&quot;. His distinctive black-and-white style was influenced by Georges Pichard and Jacques Tardi, among others.

In 1990, he co-founded the independent publisher L&#x27;Association, which became a major force in French small-press comics. His comics appeared in the L&#x27;Association anthology magazine &quot;Lapin&quot; and in numerous small-format books. Much of his work in the 1990s was dream art, collected in &quot;le Cheval blême&quot; and &quot;les Incidents de la nuit&quot;.

From 1996 to 2003, he created the acclaimed six-volume autobiographical epic &quot;l&#x27;Ascension du Haut Mal&quot; (meaning, literally, &quot;The Ascension of Great Suffering,&quot; but published in English as &quot;Epileptic&quot;, &quot;haut mal&quot; indicating what is commonly referred to in English as a grand mal seizure). It was the first of his long works to be translated into English, and is now considered to be among the masterpieces of recent Franco-Belgian comics. The series has been repeatedly nominated for prizes at the Angoulême International Comics Festival : in 2002, the fourth volume received the Angoulême International Comics Festival Prize for Scenario and in 1998 and in 2004, volumes 2 and 6 were nominated for the Prize for Best Comic Book.

Since 1997, he has also worked for publishers other than L&#x27;Association, and has collaborated with other authors such as Joann Sfar, Christophe Blain, and Emmanuel Guibert.

In 1998, he was named &quot;European Cartoonist of the year&quot; by The Comics Journal.

In 2005 Beauchard was awarded the Ignatz Award for Outstanding Artist.

With historical assistance by Jean-Pierre Filiu, Beauchard published the 2012 graphic novel &quot;Best of Enemies: A History of US and Middle East Relations&quot; through SelfMadeHero. It was translated to English by Edward Gauvin.

<text>Stenkil (Old Norse: &quot;Steinkell&quot;; died 1066) was a King of Sweden who ruled c. 1060 until 1066. He succeeded Emund the Old and became the first king from the House of Stenkil. He is praised as a devout Christian, but with an accommodating stance towards the old Pagan religion. His brief reign saw an armed conflict with Norway.

==Family background==

The &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; (13th century) describes Stenkil as the son of Ragnvald the Old and Astrid Njalsdotter, the daughter of Njal Finnsson from Hålogaland in Norway and a cognatic descendant of Harald Fairhair. Later historians have identified the father of Stenkil as Ragnvald Ulfsson who was the earl of Ladoga and the grandson of the legendary Viking Skoglar Toste, but this presumed family-connection is not supported by any other sources and must therefore be regarded as very uncertain. The Icelandic sagas mention a wife and two sons of Ragnvald Ulfsson but none are identified with Stenkil and his mother Astrid. The contemporary chronicler Adam of Bremen says Stenkil was the nephew (&quot;nepos&quot;) or stepson (&quot;privignus&quot;) of the former King Emund the Old, while the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; asserts that he was related to the previous dynasty by marriage to Emund&#x27;s daughter.

Stenkil was probably from Västergötland rather than Uppland or the Mälaren area. The short chronicle appended to the Westrogothic law (c. 1240) clearly states that he spent time in Levene in Västergötland where he was long remembered as the king who &quot;loved West Geats before all his other subjects&quot;, and he was lauded as a great archer whose hit marks were long shown with admiration. The tradition that Stenkil was beloved by the Geats appears to be supported by Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. In a speech by Thorvid, the lawspeaker (lagman) of Västergötland before a battle with Harald Hardrada (see below), the lawspeaker expresses the Geats&#x27; (Gautland people) loyalty to Stenkil:

The statement of the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; that Stenkil was originally Jarl in Svíþjóð (in the first hand, the provinces around Lake Mälaren) nevertheless calls for some caution. Historian Peter Sawyer argues that the traditions associating Stenkil with Västergötland may not be reliable, but rather express a later need to advocate Västergötland as the hub of the Swedish kingdom. His active advocacy for a bishopric in Sigtuna may speak for a strong association with the Mälaren Valley.

==Support for the Bremen mission==

Stenkil appears in history around 1056, during the reign of Emund the Old. At that time he provided support and protection for a delegation from the Archdiocese of Bremen which had been turned away by King Emund and his bishop Osmundus. Later on, a reconciliation between the king and Bremen took place, and Sweden received Adalvard the Elder as its new bishop. Emund died shortly after, in about 1060. As his son and heir Anund was already dead, Stenkil succeeded to the throne without any known commotion. Adam characterises Stenkil as God-fearing and pious. A much less flattering image of the new king is provided by the Icelandic manuscript &quot;Morkinskinna&quot; (c. 1220), which says: &quot;King Stenkil was a portly man and heavy on his feet. He was much given to drinking parties and not much involved in the business at hand ... he himself liked to be left in peace.&quot;

The king duly supported the Christianization of Sweden and cooperated with bishops from the Archbishopric of Hamburg-Bremen. With the help of Stenkil&#x27;s emissaries, Adalvard the Younger created the Sigtuna bishopric, one day&#x27;s journey from the old cult center of Uppsala. According to a historically much-debated passage in Adam&#x27;s chronicle, Uppsala was the site of a renowned pagan temple where sacrifices of humans and animals were performed every ninth year. After having formally converted the population around Sigtuna, Adalvard the Younger suggested to Bishop Egino in Scania that they should proceed to raze or burn down the temple. This, they hoped, would have the effect of pushing the population into conversion. However, Stenkil apprehended that the people in the area resented the aim of the bishops, and managed to talk them out of the project. As he argued, the bishops would be executed and he himself deposed since he had allowed miscreants into the land. Moreover, those already Christian would surely revert to paganism. The fears were probably justified. According to the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, Stenkil&#x27;s son Inge the Elder was deposed and exiled for wanting to cancel the pagan sacrifices at the temple. As it was, Adalvard and Egino reluctantly had to follow Stenkil&#x27;s advice. Instead, they traversed the lands of the Geats which were apparently less resistant to the new faith, and broke any pagan idols they found, making thousands of converts in the process.

==The war with Harald Hardrada==

The later Norse sagas relate that a brief but serious conflict flared up with the Norwegian king Harald Hardrada in 1064–65. One of Harald&#x27;s foremost men Håkon Jarl, was married to the king&#x27;s niece Ragnhild and followed Harald on his military expeditions against the Danish ruler Sweyn Estridsen. According to Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s &quot;Heimskringla&quot; the Norwegians were victorious at the Battle of Nissan in 1062, but Håkon Jarl secretly allowed the defeated Sweyn to escape alive. When this was later reported to Harald Hardrada, the enraged king gave orders to kill Håkon, who however managed to escape to Sweden. The escapee stayed with King Stenkil who made him Jarl of Värmland. According to another saga, &quot;Morkinskinna&quot;, Håkon Jarl left Norway for Denmark where he was created Jarl of Halland. Meanwhile, Harald Hardrada concluded peace with Sweyn Estridsen in 1064 and then started to harry in Stenkil&#x27;s realm in Götaland. The worried Stenkil arranged a meeting with King Sweyn and asked for his support. Sweyn replied that he could not break the recent peace treaty, but advised Stenkil to appoint the valiant Håkon Jarl as sub-ruler of Västergötland, from where he could confront King Harald. This was arranged, and Håkon assembled men from Denmark as well as from the two Geatic provinces. He spoke to his troops at an assembly, where he self-assuredly said: &quot;Even though I have a lesser title than King Stenkil, it may be that I will be of no less assistance, for he is used to an easy life, while I am accostumed to battles and hard conditions&quot;.

According to all the saga versions, Harald Hardrada reacted to Håkon Jarl&#x27;s Swedish position by assembling a fleet and invading Stenkil&#x27;s kingdom in the cold of the winter. At the entrance of the Göta älv, he took the lighter boats and brought them upriver, to Lake Vänern. The ships then rowed eastwards, to the place where he heard that Håkon&#x27;s troops had assembled. With Håkon was the law-speaker (&quot;lagman&quot;) of the Geats, Thorvid. However, the Geats were lightly clothed, &quot;as is always the case with the Geats&quot;, while Harald&#x27;s troops were more numerous and better equipped. The Geatic law-speaker lost his head and took to his heels before the battle had begun. In the fight that followed, Håkon&#x27;s troops were defeated with losses. Nevertheless, Harald did not push his advantage further, but returned to the lake shore with his men. The end of the expedition was inauspicious. Part of Harald&#x27;s troops were led into a trap, ambushed and massacred by Håkon&#x27;s men. As the Norwegians sailed down the Göta älv, some more were killed by Geatic archers. In the following year 1066 Harald Hardrada undertook his ill-fated invasion of England, which left the striking power of the Norwegian kingdom crippled. Håkon Jarl ended his life as a magnate in Denmark. It is not clear how much of the internally differing saga accounts can be regarded trustable, but a preserved scaldic verse by þjóðólfr Arnórsson confirms the outlines:

::Stenkil&#x27;s men who would
::give support to the Jarl
::have been assigned to death
::the ruler caused this.
::Håkon withdrew
::quickly when support failed.
::Thus says the one who wants
::to depict this nicely.

&quot;Morkinskinna&quot; indicates that the relations between Stenkil and Sweyn Estridsen were amicable. It is likely that the Swedish ruler had an interest in supporting Sweyn against the attempts of Harald Hardrada to subjugate Denmark between 1047 and 1062. Historian Aksel E. Christensen has concluded that the Norwegian-Danish peace treaty of 1064 was a success for the Swedish policy to prevent one king from ruling the kingdoms to the north and the south of Skagerrak. Strangely, the &quot;Knytlinga Saga&quot; tells that &quot;King Sweyn also had a dispute with the Swedish King Stenkil, who went with his army against King Sweyn, although he did not appropriate any of his territories&quot;.

==Death and burial==

Adam of Bremen, Snorri Sturluson and the &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; all state that Stenkil passed away at the time of the Battle of Hastings in England (1066). His death triggered a violent civil war, perhaps caused by rising tension between Christianity and adherents of the pagan religion. According to a legend Stenkil was buried in the &quot;royal hill&quot; near Levene in Västergötland. His two sons Halsten and Inge the Elder would both become kings of Sweden. In a letter to Halsten and Inge from c. 1081, Pope Gregory VII apparently praised Stenkil, since he expressed hope that they might compete with their &quot;predecessor&quot; in honourable lives and deeds.

The &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; has a great deal to tell about Stenkil:
==Family==

Stenkil was married to a daughter of Emund the Old, and had at least two children:
* Halsten, King of Sweden, or parts of Sweden, died after 1081
* Inge I, King of Sweden, died around 1110

It has been speculated that one of the two pretenders called Eric (around 1066–67) was his son, although there is nothing to support this assumption. A later king, Håkan the Red (1070s), is associated with Stenkil&#x27;s abode Levene in Västergötland and might have been a close kinsman.

<doc id="909402" wikidata="Q1065886" url="?curid=909402" title="Aerial root">
<text>Aerial roots are roots growing above the ground. They are often adventitious, i.e. formed from nonroot tissue. They are found in diverse plant species, including epiphytes such as orchids (&quot;Orchidaceae&quot;), tropical coastal swamp trees such as mangroves, banyan figs (&quot;Ficus subg. Urostigma&quot;), the warm-temperate rainforest rata (&quot;Metrosideros robusta&quot;), and pōhutukawa trees of New Zealand (&quot;Metrosideros excelsa&quot;). Vines such as common ivy (&quot;Hedera helix&quot;) and poison ivy (&quot;Toxicodendron radicans&quot;) also have aerial roots.

==Types ==
This plant organ that is found in so many diverse plant-families has different specializations that suit the plant-habitat. In general growth-form, they can be technically classed as &quot;negatively gravitropic&quot; (grows up and away from the ground) or &quot;positively gravitropic&quot; (grows down toward the ground).

===&quot;Stranglers&quot; (prop-root)===
Banyan trees are an example of a strangler fig that begins life as an epiphyte in the crown of another tree. Their roots grow down and around the stem of the host, their growth accelerating once the ground has been reached. Over time, the roots coalesce to form a pseudotrunk, which may give the appearance that it is strangling the host.

Another strangler that begins life as an epiphyte is the Moreton Bay fig (&quot;Ficus macrophylla&quot;) of tropical and subtropical eastern Australia, which has powerfully descending aerial roots. In the subtropical to warm-temperate rainforests of northern New Zealand, &quot;Metrosideros robusta&quot;, the rata tree, sends aerial roots down several sides of the trunk of the host. From these descending roots, horizontal roots grow out to girdle the trunk and fuse with the descending roots. In some cases, the &quot;strangler&quot; outlives the host tree, leaving as its only trace a hollow core in the massive pseudotrunk of the rata.

===Pneumatophores===
These specialized aerial roots enable plants to breathe air in habitats with waterlogged soil. The roots may grow downward from the stem or upward from typical roots. Some botanists classify them as &quot;aerating&quot; roots rather than &quot;aerial&quot; roots if they emerge from the soil. The surface of these roots is covered with porous lenticels, which lead to air-filled spongy tissue called aerenchyma. This tissue facilitates the diffusion of gases throughout the plant, as oxygen diffusion coefficient in air is four orders of magnitude greater than in water.
Pneumatophores differentiate the black mangrove and grey mangrove from other mangrove species.
Fishers in some areas of Southeast Asia make corks for fishing nets by shaping the pneumatophores of mangrove apples (&quot;Sonneratia caseolaris&quot;) into small floats.

Members of the subfamily Taxodioideae produce woody above-ground structures, known as cypress knees, that project upward from their horizontal roots. One hypothesis suggests that these structures function as pneumatophores, facilitating gas exchange in waterlogged soils. However, modern research has largely discredited this idea, as the knees lack aerenchyma and gas exchange through them is not significant. Their true functions remain unclear, with alternative theories proposing roles such as nutrient acquisition or storage, structural support, or erosion prevention.

===Haustorial roots ===
These roots are found in parasitic plants, where aerial roots become cemented to the host plant via a sticky attachment disc before intruding into the tissues of the host. Mistletoe is an example of this.

===Propagative roots===
Adventitious roots usually develop from plantlet nodes formed via horizontal, above ground stems, termed stolons, e.g., strawberry runners, and spider plant.

Some leaves develop adventitious buds, which then form adventitious roots, e.g. piggyback plant (&quot;Tolmiea menziesii&quot;) and mother-of-thousands (&quot;Kalanchoe daigremontiana&quot;). The adventitious plantlets then drop off the parent plant and develop as separate clones of the parent.

==Pumping and physiology==
Aerial roots may receive water and nutrient intake from the air. There are many types of aerial roots; some, such as mangrove, are used for aeration and not for water absorption. In other cases, they are used mainly for structure, and in order to reach the surface. Many plants rely on the leaf system for gathering the water into pockets, or onto scales. These roots function as terrestrial roots do.

Most aerial roots directly absorb the moisture from fog or humid air.

Some surprising results in studies on aerial roots of orchids show that the velamen (the white spongy envelope of the aerial roots), are actually totally waterproof, preventing water loss but not allowing any water in. Once reaching and touching a surface, the velamen is not produced in the contact area, allowing the root to absorb water like terrestrial roots.

Many other epiphytes - non-parasitic or semi-parasitic plants living on the surface of other plants - have developed cups and scales that gather rainwater or dew. The aerial roots in this case work as regular surface roots. There are also several types of roots, creating a cushion where a high humidity is retained.

Some of the aerial roots, especially in the genus &quot;Tillandsia&quot;, have a physiology that collects water from humidity, and absorbs it directly.

In the Sierra Mixe (named after the geographical area) variety of maize, aerial roots produce a sweet mucus that supports nitrogen fixing bacteria, which supply 30–80 percent of the plant&#x27;s nitrogen needs.

== On houseplants ==

Many plants that are commonly grown indoors can develop aerial roots, such as &quot;Monstera deliciosa&quot;, Pothos (&quot;Epipremnum aureum&quot;), Rubber Tree (&quot;Ficus elastica&quot;), Fiddle Leaf Fig (&quot;Ficus lyrata&quot;), &quot;Thaumatophyllum bipinnatifidum&quot;, many &quot;Philodendron&quot; and succulents such as &quot;Echeveria&quot;.

Aerial roots on houseplants do not serve as much of a purpose as on outdoor plants, as there is no rain indoors and indoor humidity is often low due to A/C and heating systems. However, studies have shown that increasing indoor humidity can result in houseplant aerial roots growing longer in length, resulting in lower levels of transpiration and more efficient intake of nitrogen than aroid houseplants grown in standard indoor humidity. Aerial roots on houseplant cuttings increase the chances of successful propagation. 

The presence of aerial roots is not an indicator of plant health. If a plant does not have aerial roots, that is no reason for concern.

<text>John Treadway Rich (April 23, 1841 – March 28, 1926) was an American politician serving as a U.S. Representative and the 23rd governor of Michigan.

==Early life in Pennsylvania, Vermont and Michigan==
Rich was born in Conneautville, Pennsylvania, the son of John W. Rich and Jerusha Treadway Rich. John Treadway Rich&#x27;s middle name is mistakenly given as &quot;Tyler&quot;, perhaps because he was born just nineteen days after John Tyler became U.S. president upon the death of William Henry Harrison. In 1846, he moved with his parents to Addison County, Vermont, and two years later they moved to Elba Township, Michigan. He attended the public schools and engaged in agricultural pursuits. On March 12, 1863, he married Lucretia M. Winship.

==Politics==
Rich was a member and chairman of the board of supervisors of Lapeer County, 1869–1872. He was a member of the Michigan House of Representatives, 1873–1881, and served as speaker of the house during the last two terms. He was also a delegate to the Republican State conventions in 1873, 1875, and 1878.

Rich served in the Michigan Senate from January 1, 1881, until March 21, 1881, when he resigned, having been elected to the United States House of Representatives for the 47th Congress to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of Omar D. Conger, serving from April 5, 1881, to March 4, 1883. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1882 to the 48th Congress. He later served as State Railroad Commissioner, 1887–1891, and a delegate to the Republican National Conventions in 1884 to elect James G. Blaine and 1892 to re-elect Benjamin Harrison as U.S. president, both of whom lost to Democrat Grover Cleveland.

Rich served as Governor of Michigan from 1893 to 1897. During his four years in office, a railroad strike, as well as an iron mine strike occurred. Also, three members of the State Canvassing Board were fired for falsifying returns on a salary raise vote for state officeholders.

After leaving office, he served as United States collector of customs at Detroit from February 16, 1898, to January 30, 1906. He was elected State Treasurer of Michigan to fill a vacancy and served from January 23, 1908, to January 1, 1909. He was then collector of customs at Port Huron from December 11, 1908, to May 30, 1913.

==Death==
Rich died in St. Petersburg, Florida, and is interred at Mount Hope Cemetery of Lapeer, Michigan.

<text>The Seguin River is a river in Parry Sound District in central Ontario, Canada that empties into Parry Sound on Georgian Bay, Lake Huron at the town of Parry Sound. The river&#x27;s name comes from the Ojibwe word &quot;ziigwan&quot;, meaning &quot;spring&quot;.

==Course==
The Seguin River begins at Horn Lake near the community of Bear Lake in the municipality of McMurrich/Monteith. It is joined by a tributary off of Bear lake, then turns southwest and enters the township of Seguin, flows through Upper Fry Lake and Lower Fry Lake and passes north over a series of waterfalls near the community of Seguin Falls, at which point it is crossed by the former path of the Ottawa, Arnprior and Parry Sound Railway, now the recreational Seguin Trail rail trail. The river turns again southwest into Isabella Lake where it takes in the left tributary Little Seguin River. It continues southwest over the Serpent Rapids, the Indian Rapids and the Hab Rapids, passes into the township of McDougall, and takes in the right tributary Manitouwabing River. The Seguin continues through Mountain Chute to reach Mill Lake in the town of Parry Sound, where it takes in the left tributary Haines Creek, heads under Ontario Highway 400 then over Mill Lake Dam, and takes in the right tributary Darlington&#x27;s Creek. It then flows under a low bridge carrying the Canadian National Railway main line, over the Cascade Street Dam and Cascade Street Generating Station, over the Trestle Dam, under the high Parry Sound CPR Trestle that carries the Canadian Pacific Railway, and reaches its mouth at Parry Sound.

In addition to the already named towns, townships and municipalities in Parry Sound District, portions of the Seguin River drainage basin lie in the township McKellar, Parry Sound District, and less than 1% lies in the geographic township of Cardwell, part of the township of Muskoka Lakes in Muskoka District.

==History==
A sawmill built at the mouth of the river in 1857 was one of the first industries in the area, and which later led to the founding of the town of Parry Sound. The river was also used to float down the logs cut in the forests upstream. Ice hockey legend Bobby Orr learned to skate on the frozen river.

==Natural history==
The Seguin River Conservation Reserve is located on the river at the mouth of the Manitouwabing River. It protects upland forest, steep cliff and metavolcanic bedrock outcropping landscapes.

<doc id="909422" wikidata="Q3847677" url="?curid=909422" title="Antimagic square">
<text>An antimagic square of order &quot;n&quot; is an arrangement of the numbers 1 to &quot;n&quot;2 in a square, such that the sums of the &quot;n&quot; rows, the &quot;n&quot; columns and the two diagonals form a sequence of 2&quot;n&quot; + 2 consecutive integers. The smallest antimagic squares have order 4. Antimagic squares contrast with magic squares, where each row, column, and diagonal sum must have the same value.

== Examples ==

=== Order 4 antimagic squares ===

In both of these antimagic squares of order 4, the rows, columns and diagonals sum to ten different numbers in the range 29–38.

=== Order 5 antimagic squares ===

In the antimagic square of order 5 on the left, the rows, columns and diagonals sum up to numbers between 60 and 71. In the antimagic square on the right, the rows, columns and diagonals add up to numbers in the range 59–70.

== Generalizations ==
A sparse antimagic square (SAM) is a square matrix of size &quot;n&quot; by &quot;n&quot; of nonnegative integers whose nonzero entries are the consecutive integers formula_1 for some formula_2, and whose row-sums and column-sums constitute a set of consecutive integers. If the diagonals are included in the set of consecutive integers, the array is known as a sparse totally anti-magic square (STAM). Note that a STAM is not necessarily a SAM, and vice versa.

A filling of the square with the numbers 1 to &quot;n&quot;2 in a square, such that the rows, columns, and diagonals all sum to different values has been called a &quot;heterosquare&quot;. (Thus, they are the relaxation in which no particular values are required for the row, column, and diagonal sums.) There are no heterosquares of order 2, but heterosquares exist for any order &quot;n&quot; ≥ 3: if &quot;n&quot; is odd, filling the square in a spiral pattern will produce a heterosquare, and if &quot;n&quot; is even, a heterosquare results from writing the numbers 1 to &quot;n&quot;2 in order, then exchanging 1 and 2. It is suspected that there are exactly 3120 essentially different heterosquares of order 3.

<doc id="909423" wikidata="Q833247" url="?curid=909423" title="1998 Tour de France">
<text>The 1998 Tour de France was the 85th edition of the Tour de France, one of cycling&#x27;s Grand Tours. The race was composed of 21 stages and a prologue. It started on 11 July in Ireland before taking an anti-clockwise route through France to finish in Paris on 2 August. Marco Pantani of won the overall general classification, with &#x27;s Jan Ullrich, the defending champion, and rider Bobby Julich finishing on the podium in second and third respectively.

The general classification leader&#x27;s yellow jersey was first awarded to Chris Boardman of the team, who won the prologue in Dublin. Following a crash by Boardman on stage 2 that caused his withdrawal, Ullrich&#x27;s sprinter teammate Erik Zabel took the race lead. He lost it the next stage to &#x27;s Bo Hamburger, who took it after being in a breakaway. The day after, the yellow jersey switched to another rider from the same breakaway, Boardman&#x27;s teammate Stuart O&#x27;Grady, who took vital seconds from time bonuses gained in intermediate sprints. He held it for a further three stages, until pre-race favourite Ullrich won stage 7&#x27;s individual time trial, moving him into the overall lead. The next day, Laurent Desbiens of finished in a breakaway with a large enough margin to put him in the yellow jersey. Ullrich regained the race lead two stages later as the Tour went into the Pyrenees. Following his poor showing in the opening week, Pantani placed second and first, respectively, on the two Pyreneean stages. He then won stage 15, the first in the Alps, to replace Ullrich in the yellow jersey, and kept it until the race&#x27;s conclusion.

Zabel won his third consecutive Tour points classification and Julich&#x27;s teammate Christophe Rinero, fourth overall, was the winner of the mountains classification. Ullrich was the best young rider and the most combative was &#x27;s Jacky Durand. The team classification was won by . Tom Steels of won the most stages, with four.

The race was marred throughout by a doping scandal, known as the Festina affair. Before the Tour began, Willy Voet, an assistant of the Festina team, was arrested at the Franco-Belgian border when doping products were found in his car. The affair broadened and the team was expelled after top personnel admitted to widespread doping. Police raids on numerous teams during the course of the race led to two riders&#x27; strikes and the withdrawal of several teams and riders. Due to the controversy, the race became known by the nickname &quot;Tour de Farce&quot;. In July 2013, retrospective tests for recombinant EPO made in 2004 were made public, revealing that 44 out of 60 samples returned positive tests.

==Teams==

The organisers of the Tour, Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO), cut the number of teams from 22 to 21 for the 1998 Tour, to reduce the number of crashes in the opening week of the race seen in recent editions, caused by the large number of riders. The first round of squads that were invited were the first sixteen teams in the ranking system of the &quot;Union Cycliste Internationale&quot; (UCI), cycling&#x27;s governing body, on 1 January 1998, provided that they were still in the top twenty after transfers were factored into the calculation. All these sixteen teams fulfilled this requirement. On 19 June, the ASO gave wildcard invitations to , , and , with receiving a special invitation. The presentation of the teams – where the members of each team&#x27;s roster are introduced in front of the media and local dignitaries – took place outside the Front Gate of Trinity College Dublin in Ireland on the evening before the prologue stage, which began at the college.

Each squad was allowed a maximum of nine riders, resulting in a start list total of 189 riders. Of these, 51 were riding the Tour de France for the first time. The riders came from 22 countries, with the majority of them coming from France, Italy and Spain. Jörg Jaksche () was the youngest rider at 21 years and 353 days on the day of the prologue, and the oldest was Massimo Podenzana () at 36 years and 347 days. The cyclists had the youngest average age while the riders on had the oldest.

==Pre-race favourites==

Jan Ullrich () was the defending champion. He had won the 1997 edition&#x27;s overall general classification by over nine minutes. His Telekom team was considered as &quot;clearly the squad to beat&quot;, having won the previous two editions with Bjarne Riis and Ullrich respectively. The 1997 Tour had seen a contest for leadership between Telekom&#x27;s two captains, but for 1998 this had been resolved in Ullrich&#x27;s favour. During the winter break, Ullrich&#x27;s training was impaired by the consequences of the fame and fortune that came with his Tour win, and his weight had increased from to . In March 1998, &quot;El País&quot; headlined an article with &quot;Ullrich is fat&quot;, which highlighted that he was still over the weight he had during the previous Tour. His preparation suffered further when he was forced to retire from Tirreno–Adriatico with a cold. However, Ullrich performed well in both the Tour de Suisse and the Route du Sud directly before the start of the Tour, erasing doubts over his form. He was therefore thought to be the clear favourite going into the 1998 Tour, with &quot;El País&quot; going so far as to write that &quot;we can no longer speak of an open Tour, of a deck of suitors. There is talk of Ullrich, and then of the others.&quot; The route of the race was considered to be an advantage to Ullrich as well, with many time-trial kilometres and comparatively few mountain passes. The veteran Riis, who had raced the 1997 Tour with a cold, was seen as a capable backup option for the team.

The strongest challenge was expected to come from , which led the UCI team ranking prior to the start of the Tour. Their leading rider, Richard Virenque, had finished second to Ullrich the year before. The two long individual time trials were expected not to be in Virenque&#x27;s favour, since he did not excel in the discipline. He was however a very good climber, having won the mountains classification in the four previous Tours. The team was further strengthened by the arrival of Alex Zülle in the 1998 season, winner of the two previous editions of the three-week Grand Tour of Spain, the Vuelta a España, who was considered to be a competitor for overall victory in his own right. He was a leading pre-race favourite at Italy&#x27;s Grand Tour, the Giro d&#x27;Italia, one month earlier, winning two of the three time trial stages and leading the race before he faltered badly in the final mountain stages to end the race in 14th overall. Another possible contender from Festina was Laurent Dufaux, who had finished fourth overall in 1996 and ninth in 1997.

Marco Pantani () was considered the &quot;dominant climber in the sport&quot; at the time. In June, he had taken an &quot;exceptionally impressive&quot; overall victory at the Giro. Of his three appearances in the Tour up to that point, he had finished third in two of them, including in 1997. When the Tour&#x27;s route was announced in October 1997, Pantani expressed dissatisfaction with the number of time trials and the fact that the race featured only two mountain-top finishes. Since the route was not to his liking, he originally had shown no interest in riding the race. Following his victory at the Giro, Pantani raced only once, a criterium race in Bologna. His decision to ride the Tour was not made until Luciano Pezzi, his closest confidant and an important figure at Mercatone Uno, died suddenly in late June. Pantani decided to go to the Tour in honour of Pezzi, but had done very little training beforehand. A further disadvantage to Pantani was his lack of a strong domestique, unlike Ullrich and Virenque.

A returning pre-race favourite from the 1997 Tour was time trialist Abraham Olano; in that race, he won the final time trial stage and placed fourth overall. He led the experienced team, who took Miguel Induráin to his five straight Tour wins between 1991 and 1995, and had been seen as his successor. His weakness was thought to be his lack of strength on steep climbs. In his final race leading up to the Tour, the Volta a Catalunya, he performed poorly in the high mountains, and as a result was only seen as a podium contender. Banesto also fielded José María Jiménez, who as a strong mountain rider was considered a &quot;major threat&quot;.

The final rider noted as a leading contender, named &quot;the outsider&quot;, was the team leader Laurent Jalabert, a complete all-rounder who excelled in all road cycling disciplines. Although he was the reigning time trial world champion and the clear first in the UCI individual ranking before the Tour, he had only aimed to match his overall placing of fourth in 1995. The riders also named as outside favourites for overall victory were Michael Boogerd (), riders Francesco Casagrande and Bobby Julich, Evgeni Berzin (), Fernando Escartín (), and Chris Boardman ().

==Route and stages==

The route of the 1998 Tour de France was officially announced during a presentation at the Palais des congrès in Paris on 23 October 1997. First negotiations about a potential start of the race in Ireland took place in October 1996, with the Irish government securing funding of IR£2 million to host the event. The opening stages (known as the &quot;Grand Départ&quot;) in Ireland were confirmed in early April 1997. Irish officials expected the race to bring in IR£30 million to the local economy. It was the first and so far only time that the Tour has visited Ireland. The race paid tribute to two famous former Irish professional cyclists: on the day before the prologue, a commemoration service was held in Kilmacanogue for Shay Elliott, the first Irish rider to ride the Tour and win a stage, and during stage 2 of the race, the route went through Carrick-on-Suir, the hometown of Sean Kelly, four-time winner of the Tour&#x27;s points classification. Stage 2 also commemorated the 200th anniversary of French troops landing at Killala Bay during the Irish Rebellion of 1798.

The 1998 Tour was pushed back one week from its original start date, so as not to overlap too much with the 1998 FIFA World Cup, also held in France, which ended on 12 July, one day after the prologue. The -race lasted 23 days, including the rest day, and ended on 2 August. The longest mass-start stage was the fourth at , and stage 20 was the shortest at . The race contained three individual time trials, one of which was the prologue, totalling . Of the remaining stages, twelve were officially classified as flat, two as mountain and five as high mountain. There were only two summit finishes, which were both at ski resorts, one at Plateau de Beille on stage 11 and another on stage 15 at Les Deux Alpes. The highest point of elevation in the race was at the summit of the Col du Galibier mountain pass on stage 15. It was among five &quot;hors catégorie&quot; (beyond category) rated climbs in the race. Cycling journalist Samuel Abt considered the route easier than the 1997 edition. Tour director Jean-Marie Leblanc countered criticism by Virenque and Pantani that the race was not mountainous enough, saying: &quot;The course is tough enough with 23 mountains. That is eight more than last year.&quot;

The Tour started with a prologue time trial around the streets of Dublin. Stage 1 was a loop that returned to the city, with the following stage travelling down the Irish eastern coast to Cork. The riders then travelled to France by plane, with the team vehicles and equipment following by sea. Just as the year before, the Tour took a counter-clockwise route through France. The course in France started in Roscoff in the north-western region of Brittany, with three stages taking the race to the centre of the country at Châteauroux. Stage 6 moved the Tour into the Massif Central highlands, which hosted the next stage. Two transitional stages to Pau then placed the race in the foothills of the Pyrenees, where two stages took place. Following the rest day, a three-stage journey crossed the south to three further stages in the Alps. The next stage took the Tour through the Jura Mountains to Switzerland, with the following stage crossing back over the border to Burgundy, where the penultimate stage took place. After a long transfer to the outskirts of Paris, the race ended with the Champs-Élysées stage.

==Race overview==
===Pre-Tour revelations===
On 4 March 1998, a truck belonging to the Dutch team was seized by customs officers in Reims, France, revealing 104 vials of recombinant erythropoietin (EPO), a drug with performance-enhancing effects. The two mechanics in the truck were released and the vials were taken by the police, who said they had more &quot;important matters&quot; to be concerned with. During the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, a race held two weeks before the start of the Tour, Christophe Moreau of Festina tested positive for the anabolic steroid mesterolone. The UCI accepted Festina&#x27;s explanation that the positive test was a result of the influence of a team masseur, and Moreau was allowed to start the Tour de France.

Three days before the start of the Tour, on 8 July, Willy Voet, a &quot;soigneur&quot; (team assistant) with the Festina squad, was stopped by customs officers driving along a back road on the Franco–Belgian border. A routine check revealed that he carried a large quantity of performance-enhancing drugs with him. He was thereafter placed under arrest, initially claiming they were &quot;for personal use&quot;. The following day, police carried out a search of Festina&#x27;s headquarters in Meyzieu, close to Lyon. On the day before the prologue, a judicial inquiry was opened by the public prosecutor&#x27;s office and Voet was held for investigation, with the story also breaking to the media. The Tour&#x27;s organisation as well as Festina were quick to dismiss the news as having nothing to do with the race.

===Early stages in Ireland===

Chris Boardman covered the route of the prologue time trial fastest with a time of 6:12.36 minutes, gaining his third Tour prologue victory. Olano finished second, four seconds slower. Third to sixth place went to Jalabert, Julich, Moreau, and Ullrich, all five seconds behind Boardman. Marco Pantani meanwhile had not bothered to preview the course and finished 181st out of the 189 starters, 48 seconds slower than the winning time. Boardman was awarded the yellow and green jerseys as the leader of both the general and points classification respectively.

Tom Steels outsprinted Erik Zabel in stage 1&#x27;s bunch sprint finish. Steels came to the Tour with the full support of his squad for the sprints, unlike Zabel&#x27;s who were focused on Ullrich&#x27;s pursuit for overall victory. Mario Cipollini (), a favourite for the stage win, was held up from the end when he was involved in a crash with his teammate, Frédéric Moncassin. Steels took the lead of the points classification from Boardman, who retained the overall lead. Steels&#x27;s teammate Stefano Zanini was the first of a seven-rider breakaway group to reach the summit of the Wicklow Gap mountain pass, claiming the Tour&#x27;s first available mountains classification points and the first polka-dot jersey.

Unlike other general classification favourites, who always rode at the front of the peloton (main group), Pantani spent the first days of the Tour at the back, surrounded by his teammates. This almost cost him, when during stage 2, which was raced largely on the wide N25 road, crosswinds split the field into several echelons. Pantani was caught out and only came back when yellow jersey-wearer Boardman crashed heavily. In the aftermath, the peloton slowed down, allowing Pantani to catch back up. Boardman meanwhile hit his head badly on a stone wall beside the road. He was taken to hospital and had to abandon the Tour. rider Ján Svorada was involved in a crash with to go, but was able to recover and win the bunch sprint finish. Zabel, who before the stage stood in eighth position overall, had collected enough time bonuses in the intermediate sprints to take the yellow jersey.
===Move to France and evolving doping scandal===

&#x27;s Jens Heppner won stage 3 from a two-rider sprint with Xavier Jan of , after the pair had escaped late from a nine-rider breakaway. Bo Hamburger of , who won two of the three intermediate sprints whilst in the escape group, took the overall lead. Svorada took the lead of the points classification, while Festina&#x27;s Pascal Hervé led the mountains classification. The second and third-placed riders in the now much-changed general classification also came from the breakaway, with George Hincapie () two seconds down on Hamburger, and Stuart O&#x27;Grady () a further second behind. Hincapie and O&#x27;Grady went head to head for the time bonuses in stage 4&#x27;s three intermediate sprints in pursuit of the race lead. O&#x27;Grady won two of them to end the day with an eleven-second overall advantage over both Hincapie and Hamburger. The stage was won by Jeroen Blijlevens (TVM) from an uphill bunch sprint at Cholet in the Loire Valley. Cipollini suffered his third crash of the Tour at the end of stage 4, accumulating eight separate injuries, but was able to avoid the multiple crashes in the next stage to win the bunch sprint finish. Svorada was disqualified for causing a crash at the end of the stage, losing the points he had earned from his tenth-place finish. Svorada&#x27;s green jersey went to Zabel, who finished second in the stage. Cipollini won the following stage, from a bunch sprint into Brive-la-Gaillarde.

As the ferry reached French soil overnight into 14 July, the day of stage 3, all team vehicles were meticulously searched at customs. During the day, Voet admitted to police that he had been following team orders, with Festina&#x27;s team doctor Eric Rijkaert publicly denying he administered any banned substances. The next day, the team manager Bruno Roussel and Rijkaert were taken into police custody. Before the start of stage 5, Jean-Marie Leblanc announced at a press conference that the professional licences held by Roussel and Rijkaert had been provisionally suspended by the UCI. At the same time, Festina riders Richard Virenque, Laurent Brochard and Laurent Dufaux stated their intention to carry on racing. During stage 6, Roussel and Rijkaert confessed to systematic doping in the Festina squad. This led to the Tour organisation to expel the team ahead of the following stage.

Before the start of stage 7 Virenque, on behalf of Festina, held a private meeting with Leblanc to plead for the team to be allowed to continue, but to no avail.

Stage 7, the hilly and technical first long individual time trial, was won by Ullrich, 1:10 minutes ahead of &#x27;s Tyler Hamilton, with Julich in third a further eight seconds behind. O&#x27;Grady was fifteenth with a deficit of 3:17 minutes, and lost the yellow jersey to Ullrich, who was now 1:18 minutes in front of Hamburger and Julich on the same time in second and third respectively. Pantani finished thirty-third, 4:21 minutes slower than Ullrich, he said later that he had held himself back in anticipation of the upcoming Pyrenees. Zanini regained the polka dot jersey. Stage 8 was held in very high temperatures. A group of six riders reached the finish 7:45 minutes ahead of the peloton. The sprint was won by Jacky Durand of , who had been in an escape group on every road stage so far. Four riders from the group gained enough time to move to the top of the general classification, with &#x27;s Laurent Desbiens taking the yellow jersey. Temperatures increased to a high of during the following stage, which was won by rider Léon van Bon in a final sprint, contested between a four-man breakaway. The closing field followed 12 seconds later. Second-place finisher Jens Voigt () collected enough mountains classification points from within the breakaway to take the polka-dot jersey. Two-time stage winner Cipollini dropped out during this stage.

===Pyrenees===

Stage 10 saw the race move into the high mountains, starting with the Pyrenees. On the way to Luchon, four mountain passes had to be crossed: the Col d&#x27;Aubisque, the Col du Tourmalet, the Col d&#x27;Aspin and finally the Col de Peyresourde, followed by of downhill to the finish line. A total of 30 riders fell on the wet and foggy descent of the Aubisque, including overall contenders Olano, Jalabert and Francesco Casagrande, with the latter being one of six that retired from the race. A three-rider breakaway of Cédric Vasseur () and teammates Rodolfo Massi and Alberto Elli formed by the foot of the Tourmalet. The pace set by halfway up this climb split the peloton, with yellow jersey wearer Desbiens dropped. Massi moved clear from his fellow riders in the breakaway group on the steep section midway on the -long last climb, and also at the same point after, a move by Ullrich formed a small group of elite riders which included pre-race favourites Pantani, Julich, Riis, Boogerd, Escartín and Jiménez. Close to the top, Pantani launched a successful attack and summitted with an advantage of 42 seconds, but was unable to catch the soloing Massi on the descent, who took the stage victory as well as the lead of the mountains classification. Pantani finished second, 33 seconds behind. Ullrich followed with the other favourites, a further 23 seconds back, to regain the yellow jersey, while Julich moved up to second overall.

The following stage 11 featured the first mountain-top finish of the 1998 Tour. The peloton agreed not to begin racing until after the first , when they stopped to pay their respects at the memorial to Fabio Casartelli on the Col de Portet d&#x27;Aspet, who crashed and died there during the 1995 Tour. As the field reached the bottom of the climb to the finish at Plateau de Beille, Ullrich had a tyre puncture. Pantani was unaware of this and was about to attack, before being stopped by his teammate Roberto Conti, as it breaches the unwritten rules of the peloton to attack a rider when they have mechanical issues. Having waited for Ullrich to regain contact, Pantani waited until from the finish to attack, and after passing the sole breakaway rider, Roland Meier (), he took the stage win. Following Meier and a group of five led by Julich, Ullrich crossed the finish line in eighth place, 1:40 minutes down on Pantani. After the two stages in the Pyrenees, Ullrich led the general classification, 1:11 minutes ahead of Julich, with both Jalabert and Pantani 3:01 minutes down in third and fourth. Olano, a notable pre-race favourite, withdrew from the Tour halfway through the stage.

===Transition stages and rider unrest===

After the rest day, stage 12 followed a flat course between Tarascon-sur-Ariège and Cap d&#x27;Agde. The riders were unhappy with the looming expulsion of the TVM team, against which the police had renewed their investigation which was started in March. Likewise, journalists going through waste containers at team hotels, searching for evidence of performance-enhancing drugs, drew anger from the peloton. Some riders also spoke out against the announcement by the UCI to move forward the introduction of new health tests. As the riders lined up with their bikes at the start of the stage, Jalabert broadcast a statement on their behalf on the race&#x27;s official station, Radio Tour, saying &quot;We are fed up with being treated like cattle. So we are going to behave like cattle.&quot;

Following this, the majority of the riders sat down on the road and refused to continue, while others willing to start stood around, unsure what to do. The instigators of the strike were Jalabert, Blijlevens, Max Sciandri (), and Prudencio Induráin () as well as ONCE&#x27;s team manager Manolo Saiz. Leblanc negotiated with the team managers and they voted 14–6 in agreement to begin the stage. The peloton and vehicles slowly set off, but a Jalabert-led group of about 40 refused. They eventually relented and caught up to the rest ahead, and the race started, exactly two hours after the scheduled time. It was at this point that the stage was officially started. After about , Jalabert then went on the attack over a short climb with his brother Nicolas () and Bart Voskamp (TVM), with the group building up a lead of about five minutes. Team Telekom gave chase at a high pace, temporarily putting Pantani into difficulty as crosswinds created echelons in the peloton. The trio of escapees were eventually brought back. Steels took his second stage win of the Tour in a bunch sprint finish, but withheld any celebrations following the events of the stage. The stage, shortened by to account for the delay caused by the strike, was run at an average speed of , the third-fastest stage in Tour history.

Stage 13 saw a breakaway by six riders, among them Daniele Nardello and Andrea Tafi, both of Team . They worked together at the finish to ensure Nardello took Mapei&#x27;s fourth stage win. At the only classified climb of the day, Luc Leblanc () put in an attack, but was brought back by Riis. The following day&#x27;s stage brought the Tour to Grenoble at the foot of the Alps. The stage was won by O&#x27;Grady, again from a breakaway. In the press conference after, Ullrich was asked whether his team would be capable of supporting him in the Alps and, after initially appearing upbeat, he ended his response with: &quot;Even if I don&#x27;t have the yellow jersey in Paris, I want to give my compliments to the team&quot;. Pantani, who still stood at fourth overall, was quoted saying: &quot;My main goal now is to win in Les Deux-Alpes.&quot;

===Alps and second strike===

Stage 15 was the first of three Alpine stages. After a warm start in Grenoble, the weather soon deteriorated, with cold temperatures, rain and fog impeding the riders. The route contained four classified climbs, including the &quot;hors categorie&quot; Col de la Croix de Fer and Col du Galibier, and ending with a summit finish at Les Deux Alpes. On the Croix de Fer, Massi bridged over to a breakaway group and scored maximum points for the mountains classification, a feat he repeated on the second climb of the day, the Col du Télégraphe. By this point, the lead group contained only Massi, Christophe Rinero () and Marcos-Antonio Serrano (). Behind them in the group of the main favourites, the high climbing tempo put Jalabert into difficulty, which ultimately saw him drop far down the general classification by the end of the stage. After the short descent of the Télégraphe, the race reached the Galibier, where Riis cracked following his work reeling back attackers, leaving Ullrich without a teammate. With remaining to the summit of the Galibier, Pantani made the decisive move of the race, attacking from the group of favourites. By the summit of the climb, Pantani had passed all the breakaway riders and was out in front alone, leading by ten seconds. Ullrich reached the top 2:41 minutes behind Pantani. Crucially, unlike Pantani, he did not wear a raincoat during the descent. He subsequently suffered from the cold temperatures and hypoglycemia for the rest of the stage. The breakaway caught up to Pantani on the descent of the Galibier, forming a group of strong climbers. Before the final climb to Les Deux Alpes, Ullrich had a tyre puncture and was distanced by the group of chasers. On the climb, Pantani soon moved clear of his group and took the stage victory, almost two minutes ahead of Massi in second place. Ullrich finished with teammates Udo Bölts and Riis 8:57 minutes after Pantani, who took over the yellow jersey. He led Julich by 3:53 minutes, with Escartín in third place in the general classification, ahead of Ullrich.

Before the following stage to Albertville, speculation spread that Ullrich would abandon the race. Pantani&#x27;s Mercatone Uno team coped well in defending his race lead over the four lesser categorised climbs, until the race reached the &quot;hors categorie&quot; final climb, the Col de la Madeleine, when Ullrich attacked, with only Pantani able to follow. Ullrich led the duo up the rest of the climb as they passed the breakaway riders and increased their advantage over the chasing Julich, who was accompanied by two teammates. The pair held their lead of around two minutes along the final of flat, where at the finish, Ullrich outsprinted Pantani to the stage win. Pantani now led Julich by 5:42 minutes, with Ullrich third, 14 seconds behind Julich.

Another police raid on the TVM team and news about alleged mistreatment of the Festina riders while in custody led to another riders&#x27; strike on stage 17. After a brief stop of two minutes at the start, the riders rode slowly to the first intermediate sprint of the day, where they climbed off their bikes and sat on the road. Jalabert climbed into his team car and retired from the race. Meanwhile, Jean-Marie Leblanc negotiated with the riders and collected guarantees from a civil servant from the French Ministry of the Interior, who was visiting the Tour as a guest, that police treatment of the riders would improve. Nevertheless, the entire ONCE team followed their leader Jalabert and abandoned the race. As the riders slowly got moving again, they ripped off their race numbers as a further sign of protest. Luc Leblanc retired later in the stage. At the feed zone, the Banesto squad joined their fellow Spanish-based ONCE team in quitting, as did the Italian-based Riso Scotti team. The field reached the finishing town, Aix-les-Bains, two hours behind schedule. The TVM team was allowed to cross the line first as a sign of solidarity; the stage was annulled and no results counted. Overnight, two more Spanish-based teams, Kelme and Vitalicio Seguros, also decided not to carry on in the Tour. This caused the retirement of the fourth rider overall, Escartín of Kelme.

===Conclusion===

Before stage 18 into Neuchâtel in Switzerland, police held Massi, who was still the leader in the mountains classification, for questioning after corticoids were allegedly found in his room during a search of the Casino team hotel. He was therefore unable to start the stage, and the lead of the mountains classification was passed to the second placed rider, Rinero. Victory went to Steels, who outsprinted Zabel and O&#x27;Grady at the finish. The remaining five riders from TVM exited the race on Swiss soil before the start of the following day. Stage 19 went back into France and saw a breakaway of 13 riders. Four riders broke away from the lead group to contest the stage win between them, with Magnus Bäckstedt () coming out on top.

The penultimate stage saw the last individual time trial of the race to Le Creusot. Ullrich won the stage, 1:01 minutes ahead of Julich, to move into second place overall. Pantani finished the stage third, 2:35 minutes behind Ullrich, effectively sealing his victory in the general classification. The final stage on the Champs-Élysées in Paris was won by Steels from a bunch sprint, while Pantani finished safely in the peloton to secure the Tour win. Ullrich ended the Tour in second place, with a deficit of 3:21 minutes, with Julich a further 47 seconds behind in third. Pantani was greeted on the podium by Felice Gimondi, who had been invited by Jean-Marie Leblanc to present to the crowd the first Italian winner since his own victory in 1965. Zabel won his third consecutive points classification with a total of 327, 97 ahead of O&#x27;Grady in second. Although Pantani won two high mountain stages, the mountains classification was won by the more consistent Rinero, whose total of 200 points was 25 more than that of second-placed Pantani. Due to the high number of abandons because of the Festina affair, only 96 riders reached the finish in Paris. Only Team Telekom and U.S. Postal Service ended the Tour with all nine riders still racing.

===Doping===

The prevalence of EPO in the cycling peloton had been a topic of debate since the early 1990s. The first news stories about the drug appeared in 1994. The UCI gave the task of developing a test for EPO to Francesco Conconi, a professor at the University of Ferrara, Italy, and a member of the UCI Medical Commission. In June 1996, Conconi, seemingly unable to find a definite test for the substance, proposed to the UCI to introduce a test for an athlete&#x27;s hematocrit level instead, which tested how many red cells were in a rider&#x27;s blood. During the UCI&#x27;s meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, on 24 January 1997, the procedure, labelled as a &quot;health test&quot;, limiting the allowed hematocrit level to 50 per cent, was introduced. If a rider returned a value higher than 50 per cent, they were not allowed to compete for a two-week period. However, as cycling journalist Alasdair Fotheringham noted, &quot;the 50 per cent threshold became a target to aim for&quot; instead of a reliable deterrent to using EPO.

The doping scandal that occurred throughout the Tour became known as the Festina affair, starting with the arrest of Voet. Initially, the suspicion only surrounded the Festina and TVM teams, but later investigations and retrospective tests revealed the doping abuse was far more widespread. Even while the race was running, media sources coined nicknames for it, such as the &quot;Tour de Farce&quot; or &quot;Tour du Dopage&quot; (Tour of Doping). Following Festina&#x27;s expulsion from the race, the police investigation against the TVM team in March was made public by &quot;Le Parisien&quot; and the case reopened.

Many riders in the Tour reacted to the developing scandal by hiding or destroying evidence of doping. Rolf Aldag () said he flushed his doping products down the toilet before the race began in Dublin. His teammate Bjarne Riis said in his autobiography that he disposed of his vials of EPO in the toilet after stage 3. Likewise, the U.S. Postal team flushed their drugs down the toilet following Voet&#x27;s arrest, according to Tyler Hamilton. According to Jörg Jaksche, the Polti squad hid their supply of EPO in a vacuum cleaner on the team bus; Jaksche believed that most Italian teams kept their drugs during the race as well. Philippe Gaumont claimed in his autobiography that the Cofidis team were told by team management to destroy their substances on the day the Festina team was expelled, with the riders subsequently going into a forest to dispose of the evidence. Julich said he quit doping altogether during the 1998 Tour.

After their arrests, Voet, Roussel, and Rijckaert gave the police confessions detailed the doping practices at Festina. Roussel said that one per cent of the team&#x27;s budget (around €40,000) was used to pay for EPO and human growth hormones. The Festina riders were placed under custody and brought into individual prison cells, and allegedly subjected to cavity searches. On 24 July, four Festina riders confessed to taking performance-enhancing drugs, with the first being Alex Zülle. The only riders to deny the allegations were Virenque and Neil Stephens. Examinations carried out on the nine Festina riders on 23 July, with the results being published on 28 November, revealed that eight riders took EPO and four amphetamines. Virenque was the only rider not to test positive in these tests.

On 23 July, the Tour&#x27;s rest day, TVM&#x27;s manager Cees Priem and team doctor Andrei Mikhailov were arrested by the police. At the beginning of August, team &quot;soigneur&quot; Johannes Moors was taken into custody as well. Priem and Moors were released on 10 August. The TVM riders were also questioned by the police on 4 August and held for about 12 hours, before they were released. However, no banned substances were found during the raid at TVM&#x27;s team hotel during the Tour. At ONCE and BigMat, police did find performance-enhancing drugs during their raids. ONCE maintained that the substances were for medical use of the team staff. Police called in twelve riders from BigMat for questioning along with the &quot;directeur sportif&quot; and some &quot;soigneurs&quot; a week after the end of the Tour because of &quot;330 bottles and ampoules of drugs&quot; found in the team&#x27;s truck.

The legal investigation into doping at the 1998 Tour was given to judge Patrick Keil shortly after the race concluded. He handed in his 5539-page report on the matter at the beginning of July 1999, which laid the groundwork for subsequent legal proceedings against team staff and riders. Virenque confessed during a court hearing concerning the Festina affair, on 24 October 2000. Virenque received a nine-month racing ban and a suspended prison sentence. Voet was sentenced to a suspended ten months in prison and a fine of 3,000 franc. Roussell received a one-year suspended sentence and a 50,000 franc fine. Lesser verdicts were handed out to &quot;two masseurs, the team&#x27;s logistics manager, the team doctor at the Spanish ONCE team, Nicolas Terrados, and two pharmacists&quot;.

During the Tour, 108 tests for performance-enhancing drugs were carried out by France&#x27;s main anti-doping laboratory in Châtenay-Malabry. All of them were negative. In 2004, 60 remaining anti-doping samples given by riders during the 1998 Tour were tested retrospectively for recombinant EPO by using three recently developed detection methods. The tests produced 44 positive results and 9 negatives, with the remaining 7 samples not returning any result due to sample degradation. At first, the rider names with a positive sample were not made public, as it had only been conducted as scientific research.

In July 2013, the anti-doping committee of the French Senate decided it would benefit the current doping fight to shed full light on the past, and so decided – as part of their &quot;Commission of Inquiry into the effectiveness of the fight against doping&quot; report – to publish all sample IDs along with the result of the retrospective test. This revealed, that the 9 negative samples belonged to 5 riders (of whom two nevertheless had confessed using EPO in that Tour), while the 44 positive samples belonged to 33 riders – including race winner Pantani, Ullrich, Julich, and Zabel. Julich had already admitted in 2012 that he had used EPO from August 1996 to July 1998.

==Classification leadership and minor prizes==

There were several classifications in the 1998 Tour de France. The most important was the general classification, calculated by adding each cyclist&#x27;s finishing times on each stage. The cyclist with the least accumulated time was the race leader, identified by the yellow jersey; the winner of this classification is considered the winner of the Tour. Jan Ullrich wore the yellow jersey in the prologue as the winner of the previous edition. Time bonuses were given during the first half of the Tour to the first three finishers on each stage, excluding mountain stages and time trials. The winner received a 20-second bonus, the second finisher 12 seconds and the third rider 8 seconds. During the first half of the race, intermediate sprints also had time bonuses, with bonuses of 6, 4, and 2 seconds given to the first three riders to cross the line.

Additionally, there was a points classification, in which cyclists got points for finishing among the best in a stage finish, or in intermediate sprints. In flat stages, the first 25 finishers received points, 35 for the stage winner down to 1 point for 25th place. In medium mountain stages, the top-20 finishers received points, with 25 points for the stage winner down to 1 point. In mountain stages, the first 15 finishers received points, with 20 points given to the stage winner. In time trials, 15 points were given to the winner, down to 1 point for the tenth-placed finisher. Points could also be won during intermediate sprints along the race route, with 6, 4, and 2 points for the first three riders across the line respectively. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, and was identified by a green jersey.

There was also a mountains classification. Most stages of the race included one or more categorised climbs, in which points were awarded to the riders that reached the summit first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and &quot;hors catégorie&quot;, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. The first rider to cross the summit of an &quot;hors catégorie&quot; climb was given 40 points (down to 1 point for the 15th rider). Twelve riders received points for first category climbs, with 30 for the first rider to reach the summit. Second-, third- and fourth-category climbs gave 20, 10 and 5 points to the first rider respectively. The cyclist with the most points led the classification, wearing a white jersey with red polka dots.

The young rider classification, which was not marked by a jersey, was decided the same way as the general classification, but only riders under 26 years were eligible. This meant that in order to compete in the classification, a rider had to be born after 1 January 1973. 34 out of the 189 starters were eligible. Jan Ullrich won the classification for the third time in a row.

For the team classification, the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added; the leading team was the team with the lowest total time.

In addition, there was a combativity award given after each mass-start stage to the cyclist considered the most combative. The winner of the award wore a red number bib during the next stage, this feature was introduced for the first time in 1998. The decision was made by a jury composed of journalists who gave points. The cyclist with the most points from votes in all stages led the combativity classification. Jacky Durand won this classification, and was given overall the super-combativity award. The Souvenir Henri Desgrange was given in honour of Tour founder Henri Desgrange to the first rider to pass the summit of the Col du Galibier on stage 15. The winner of the prize was Marco Pantani.

*In stage one, Abraham Olano, who was second in the points classification, wore the green jersey, because first placed Chris Boardman wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification.

==UCI Road Rankings==

Riders in the Tour competed individually, as well as for their teams and nations, for points that contributed towards the UCI Road Rankings, which included all UCI races. Points were awarded to all riders in the general classification, to the top ten finishers in each stage, and each yellow jersey given at the end of a stage. The points accrued by Marco Pantani moved him from fifth position to fourth in the individual ranking, with Laurent Jalabert, who did not finish the Tour, holding his lead. retained their lead of the team ranking, ahead of second-placed . Italy remained as leaders of the nations ranking, with Switzerland second.

==Aftermath==

In the direct aftermath of the Tour, there were many raids and searches of cycling teams and many riders questioned by police. Two meetings to discuss the issue of doping were held shortly after the Tour: the first, between the UCI, race organisers and teams, took place four days after the Tour ended in Paris; the second, on 11 August, was between the UCI and representatives of the riders. Neither meeting yielded results that had &quot;any long-term effect&quot;. The riders voiced concern over the length of races and demanded changes to be made, while the question of a general amnesty for riders who took banned substances was also briefly discussed. In a press communiqué released on 13 August, the UCI claimed that &quot;it is difficult to do more than is already being done&quot; in response to doping and that the blood tests enforced in 1997 enabled the UCI &quot;to control the EPO problem&quot;, a claim that Alasdair Fotheringham later described as bordering &quot;on the delusional&quot;.

Festina returned to racing shortly after the Tour de France, with the crowd showing positive responses to the team at the Vuelta a Burgos. The squad then competed in the last Grand Tour of the year, the Vuelta a España, where Alex Zülle failed to defend his title, but won a stage and finished eighth overall.

Following the fallout from the 1998 edition, the 1999 Tour de France was dubbed by the organisers as the &quot;Tour of Renewal&quot;, with the ASO publicly stating that they would welcome a lower average speed by around . This did not come to pass however, as the average speed rose again and race winner Lance Armstrong was stripped of his title in 2012 following a lengthy investigation into doping practises. ASO barred the TVM team from competing in the 1999 race. Richard Virenque and Manolo Saiz were originally banned from the race, before the UCI required the race organisers to allow both to participate, considering that the ASO had failed to comply with the registration period. This dictates that both organisers and teams need to register the invitation and their willingness to participate thirty days before the start of the event. Festina was allowed to start the next Tour, but the ASO handed out a warning to the team before the race, reminding them of their ability to disqualify them as they had in 1998.
Fotheringham noted nearly twenty years after the 1998 Tour that ever since, extraordinary performances in cycling have been viewed with suspicion, because of the sport&#x27;s now cemented association with doping. Until the revelations of the Lance Armstrong doping case, the 1998 Tour de France stood as the biggest doping scandal in sport. One of the most significant effects of the Festina affair was the creation of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) in December 1999.

==In the media==

In 2018, a film centering around the 1998 Tour, titled &quot;The Domestique&quot; and to be directed by Kieron J. Walsh and written by Ciarán Cassidy, was announced. Production was taken over by Blinder Films, with the movie receiving €800,000 funding through Screen Ireland, the Irish state development agency. The film has since been renamed &quot;The Racer&quot; and secured funding from Screen Flanders, the Film Fund Luxembourg, Eurimages, the BAI Sound &amp; Vision Fund, and RTÉ. The film premiered at the 2020 South by Southwest film festival.

<text>The German navies—specifically the and of Imperial and Nazi Germany, respectively—built a series of battleships between the 1890s and 1940s. To defend its North and Baltic Sea coasts in wartime, Germany had previously built a series of smaller ironclad warships, including coastal defense ships, and armored frigates. With the accession to the throne of Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1888, the began a program of naval expansion befitting a Great Power. The navy immediately pushed for the construction of the four s, after which soon followed five ships. The appointment of Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz to the post of State Secretary of the Navy in 1897 accelerated naval construction. Tirpitz&#x27;s &quot;risk theory&quot; planned a fleet that would be sufficiently powerful so that Great Britain, then the world&#x27;s preeminent naval power, would avoid risking war with Germany in order to preserve its superiority.

Tirpitz secured a series of Naval Laws between 1900 and 1912 that drastically increased the budget of the navy and authorized scores of battleships; the final law envisioned a fleet of some 41 battleships, 25 of which would have been assigned to the High Seas Fleet, with the remainder in reserve. Following the class were the , , and es, the last pre-dreadnoughts built in Germany. The launch of the &quot;all-big-gun&quot; in 1906 revolutionized battleship construction, and forced Tirpitz to radically alter his shipbuilding plan. In order to remain in the battleship race, Tirpitz secured the funds for the first four German dreadnoughts, the , which were laid down beginning in June 1907. The four s followed in 1908, as well as the five s in 1909–1910. Four s were laid down in 1911–1912, and four s were laid down in 1913–1915, though only two— and —were completed. Germany&#x27;s defeat in 1918 resulted in the internment of the majority of the High Seas Fleet at Scapa Flow; the ships were eventually scuttled on 21 June 1919 to prevent them from being seized by the British Royal Navy. Of the ten battleships interned, only one, , was prevented from sinking; she was later expended as a gunnery target by the Royal Navy.

Following the war, Germany was limited to eight pre-dreadnought battleships, two of which would be in reserve. New warships were severely limited in terms of armament and size. Admiral Erich Raeder was appointed the commander of the German navy in 1928. Raeder initially employed a cautious strategy &quot;vis a vis&quot; the government of the Weimar Republic. However, the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in 1933 allowed Raeder opportunity to expand the fleet. Hitler&#x27;s government negotiated the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in 1935, which stipulated the German navy could rebuild to 35 percent of the strength of the Royal Navy. The first new battleships built in Germany were the two ships, and in 1935. The two s followed in 1936; was completed in 1940 and in 1941. Plan Z was formulated in 1939 to rebuild the German navy; the plan called for six additional battleships of the H-39 class. Two of them were laid down in mid-1939, though they were canceled within two months, due to the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. The other four were canceled without any work being done. , , and were sunk during the war and was scuttled in Gotenhafen in 1945. Further design studies were drawn up, culminating in the massive H-44 class, but they were not serious proposals due to the infeasibility and expense of the ships.

==Pre-dreadnought battleships==
===&quot;Brandenburg&quot; class===

The -class ships were the first ocean-going battleships built for the German navy, and marked the beginning of German naval expansion. Previous classes included several types of ironclad ships, including coastal defense ships and armored frigates. The ships were unique for the time in that they were armed with six large-caliber guns instead of four, as was standard on contemporary ships in other navies. The class comprised four ships: , , , and . Of the four ships, and were more advanced, in that their armor was composed of higher quality steel.

The four ships were commissioned into the I Battle Squadron. They saw overseas service during the Boxer Uprising in China in 1900–1901 under the command of Marshal Alfred von Waldersee. Following the return from China, the s were taken into drydock for modernization, which lasted from 1901 to 1905 depending on the ship. During the reconstruction the superstructure was cut down, a second conning tower was added, and the steam boilers were replaced with newer models. and were sold to the Ottoman Empire in 1910 and renamed and , respectively. and were decommissioned and placed into reserve. At the start of World War I, both ships were recalled to active service as coastal defense ships, but due to their age they were quickly demobilized. They spent the remainder of the war as barracks ships before being broken up in 1920.

===&quot;Kaiser Friedrich III&quot; class===

The five -class ships set the standard for later German pre-dreadnought battleships: they carried smaller main guns than their foreign contemporaries, but a heavier secondary battery. This was in accordance with the &quot;hail of fire&quot; theory, which emphasized smaller, rapid firing guns over larger and slower guns. The ships of the class were also the first German battleships to use three screws, which would be used in many subsequent ships, as opposed to two in the s. The class was composed of five ships: , , , , and . All of the ships were named for German emperors.

Upon commissioning, the five ships were assigned to the I Squadron of the Home Fleet (). saw service as the fleet flagship until 1906. After ten years of fleet service, they were replaced with newer ships. They were transferred to the III Squadron of the fleet, which had by then been reorganized as the High Seas Fleet, and placed in reserve. In 1907, all five ships were taken into drydock for significant rebuilding. The funnels were made taller, the superstructure was cut down, and the secondary guns were rearranged; work lasted until 1910. The five ships saw no front-line service during World War I; they were all disarmed and relegated to secondary duties. was used as a torpedo training ship, was used as a headquarters ship, while the other three became prison ships. They were all broken up between 1919 and 1922.

===&quot;Wittelsbach&quot; class===

The class represented an incremental improvement over the preceding class. They were equipped with the same armament of four 24 cm guns, but were given an additional torpedo tube. They had improved defensive capabilities, as they were protected by a more extensive armored belt. They also differed from the preceding ships in their main deck, the entire length of which was flush. The had a cut-down quarterdeck. The ships of the class, which included , , , , and , were the first battleships built under the first Naval Law of 1898.

After joining the fleet, the class ships were assigned to the I Battle Squadron, where they replaced the older -class ships. Like the -class ships, the s were withdrawn from active service after the advent of the dreadnoughts. The five ships were recalled to active service at the outbreak of war in 1914. They were assigned to the IV Battle Squadron and deployed to the Baltic. However, due to their age and vulnerability, they were withdrawn from active service by 1916. They were used as training ships, with the exception of , which was used as a prison ship. In 1919, and were converted into depot ships for minesweepers. By 1922, all of the ships had been broken up for scrap, with the exception of . She was converted into a radio-controlled target ship in 1926–1927. RAF bombers sank the ship in Gotenhafen in 1944; the wreck was broken up in 1949–1950.

===&quot;Braunschweig&quot; class===

The class, which consisted of , , , , and , was a considerable improvement over the preceding types of battleships in the German navy. They were equipped with much more powerful 28 cm guns for their main battery, although this was still smaller than the standard guns used on British ships. The main battery turrets were mounted on the forecastle deck, as opposed to one deck higher as in the older ships. They were also larger and faster than their predecessors, though armor protection was largely the same. These ships were authorized under the Naval Law of 1900.

In 1907 the II Battle Squadron was organized; the five -class battleships were assigned to it, along with the five new -class ships. When war broke out in 1914, four of the -class ships were assigned to the IV Squadron alongside the -class ships. and took part in the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in 1915. remained in the II Battle Squadron and saw action at the Battle of Jutland in 1916. After the war, and were converted into depot ships for minesweepers. They were eventually scrapped in 1931. A long section of was retained for use as an explosives target; it was eventually bombed and sunk in April 1945. The hulk was raised and broken up in 1954. The other three ships were used as coastal defense ships, though between 1931 and 1935, they too were withdrawn from service and broken up, with the exception of . was converted into a radio-controlled target ship in 1935 and served in that capacity until the end of World War II in 1945. She was then ceded to the Soviet Navy and renamed .

===&quot;Deutschland&quot; class===

The five -class battleships—, , , , and —were the last pre-dreadnoughts built by the German navy. They were similar to the -class ships, though their armor was thicker. The ships were built despite rumors of the capabilities of the revolutionary . Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz insisted on their construction as larger ships would have necessitated widening the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal; this would have put an enormous strain on the naval budget for the year.

Following their commissioning starting in 1906, they were assigned to the new II Battle Squadron; replaced as the fleet flagship. During World War I, the ships remained in the II Battle Squadron and saw combat at the Battle of Jutland in 1916. Their slow speed hindered the more modern dreadnoughts of the High Seas Fleet. Early on the second day of the battle, was sunk by a single torpedo that triggered an ammunition magazine explosion. Following the battle the s were withdrawn from fleet duty and ultimately out of service completely in August 1917. was broken up in 1920. The three remaining ships saw continued service in the German navy; was struck in 1935 and eventually broken up in 1944–1946. and were both sunk during World War II but later raised. was broken up in 1949–1970, while was transferred to the Soviet Navy in 1946.

==Dreadnought battleships==
===&quot;Nassau&quot; class===

The class, which was composed of , , , and , was the German response to the arrival of HMS &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, the first &quot;all-big-gun&quot; battleship, in 1906. The ships were unusual in their main-armament configuration, which was hexagonal. They retained triple-expansion engines instead of more powerful turbine engines, and as a result, were slower than their British contemporaries.

After their commissioning into the German fleet, all four ships served in the II Division of I Battle Squadron. Two of the ships, and , took part in the inconclusive Battle of the Gulf of Riga in 1915, during which they engaged the Russian pre-dreadnought . The four -class ships took part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916; they suffered only a handful of secondary battery hits and limited casualties. In early 1918 and were sent to Finland to support the White Finns in their civil war, but ran aground off Åland in April and was severely damaged. At the end of World War I, the four ships were seized as war prizes by the victorious Allied powers and sold for scrapping.

===&quot;Helgoland&quot; class===

The class was the second type of German dreadnoughts, built during 1908–1912. The class was composed of four ships: , , , and . The ships incorporated significant improvements over the previous type, including more powerful main guns and an improved propulsion system. The s were easily distinguished from the preceding s by the three funnels that were closely arranged, compared to the two larger funnels of the previous class. The ships retained the unusual hexagonal main battery layout of the class.

The ships served as a unit in the I Division, I Battle Squadron alongside the -class ships in the II Division of the I Battle Squadron. They saw combat during World War I, including the Battle of Jutland in the North Sea and the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in the Baltic. All four survived the war, but were not taken as part of the German fleet that was interned at Scapa Flow. After the German fleet at Scapa Flow were scuttled, the four s were ceded as war reparations to the victorious Allied powers in the sunken ships&#x27; stead. was taken by the US Navy and expended as a target during Billy Mitchell&#x27;s air power demonstration in July 1921. and were allotted to Britain and Japan respectively, and broken up in 1921. was delivered to France in 1920, and was used as a target ship for the French navy. The ship was eventually broken up between 1923 and 1933.

===&quot;Kaiser&quot; class===

The class, which comprised , , , , and , was the third class of German dreadnoughts, and the first to feature turbine engines and superfiring turrets. As was usual for German battleships of the period, the class mounted main guns that were smaller than those of their British rivals: , compared to the guns of the British . The ten SK L/50 guns were mounted in five twin turrets; one turret was mounted fore, two aft in a superfiring arrangement, and the other two in a staggered &quot;wing&quot; arrangement amidships.

All five ships saw action in the North Sea during the war; they served together as the VI Division of the III Battle Squadron, with serving as the fleet flagship. Four were present during the Battle of Jutland; was in dock at the time. Of the four ships that took part in the battle, only was damaged, being struck by two heavy-caliber shells. The ships also took part in Operation Albion in the Baltic Sea; during the operation they were reorganized as the IV Battle Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral Wilhelm Souchon. At the end of the war, all five ships were interned at the British naval base at Scapa Flow. On 21 June 1919, they were scuttled to prevent their seizure by the Royal Navy. The ships were subsequently raised and broken up for scrap between 1929 and 1937.

===&quot;König&quot; class===

, , , and , the four ships of the class, were the most powerful warships of the High Seas Fleet at the outbreak of war in 1914. The s were an improvement over the preceding ; one of the wing turrets was moved forward and placed in a superfiring arrangement, while the second wing turret was moved to the centerline amidships. This allowed for a wider angle of fire on the broadside, as all 10 guns could fire on a larger area compared to the earlier s.

The class operated as a unit throughout World War I—the V Division of the III Battle Squadron. The ships took part in a number of fleet operations during the war, including the Battle of Jutland, where they acted as the vanguard of the German line and were heavily engaged by the British fleet. The ships also took part in Operation Albion against the Russians in 1917, where sank the battleship . They survived the war and were interned at Scapa Flow in November 1918. All four ships were scuttled there on 21 June 1919.

===&quot;Bayern&quot; class===

The four -class ships were the first super-dreadnoughts built by the German navy. The class comprised , , , and . Construction started on the ships shortly before World War I; was laid down in 1913, and followed in 1914, and , the final ship, was laid down in 1915. Only and were completed, as ship building priorities shifted as the war dragged on. It was determined that U-boats were more valuable to the war effort, and so work on new battleships was slowed and ultimately stopped altogether. As a result, and were the last German battleships completed by the .

 and were commissioned into the fleet in July 1916 and March 1917, respectively. This was too late for either ship to take part in the Battle of Jutland on 31 May and 1 June 1916. was assigned to the naval force that drove the Imperial Russian Navy from the Gulf of Riga during Operation Albion in October 1917, though the ship was severely damaged from a mine and had to be withdrawn to Kiel for repairs. replaced as the flagship of the High Seas Fleet, but saw no combat. Both vessels were interned at Scapa Flow following the Armistice in November 1918. was successfully scuttled on 21 July 1919, but British guards managed to beach to prevent her from sinking. The ship was eventually expended as a gunnery target in 1921. and , both at various stages of completion when the war ended, were broken up for scrap metal in the early 1920s.

===L 20e α class===

The L 20e α design was a plan for an unknown number of battleships to be built in 1918 for the German navy. The design was selected on 2 October 1917, and construction was to have started 11 September 1918. The ships would have been significantly larger than the preceding class, at more than longer than the preceding ships. The ships would have been the first German warship to have mounted guns larger than 16 in (40.6 cm cm). However, Germany&#x27;s declining war situation meant that the ships were never built.

==Fast battleships==
===&quot;Scharnhorst&quot; class===

The two -class battleships were the first capital ships built for the Kriegsmarine after the end of World War I. They marked the beginning of German naval rearmament after the Treaty of Versailles. The class comprised two vessels: and . The ships were armed with nine 28 cm (11 in) SK C/34 guns in three triple turrets, though there were plans to replace these weapons with six 38 cm (15 in) SK C/34 guns in twin turrets.

The two ships were laid down in 1935, launched in late 1936, and commissioned into the German fleet by early 1939. and operated together for much of the early portion of World War II, including sorties into the Atlantic to raid British merchant shipping. The two ships participated in Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Norway. During operations off Norway, the two ships engaged the battlecruiser and sank the aircraft carrier — in the engagement with &quot;Glorious&quot;, achieved one of the longest-range naval gunfire hits in history. In early 1942, the two ships made a daylight dash up the English Channel from occupied France to Germany.

In late 1942, was heavily damaged in an Allied air raid against Kiel. In early 1943, joined the -class battleship in Norway to interdict Allied convoys to the Soviet Union. and several destroyers sortied from Norway to attack a convoy; the Germans were instead intercepted by British naval patrols. During the Battle of North Cape, the Royal Navy battleship sank . In the meantime, repair work on had begun, and the ship was in the process of being rearmed. However, when was sunk, work on her sister was abandoned. Instead, she was sunk as a blockship in Gdynia in 1945; the wreck was broken up for scrap in the 1950s.

===&quot;Bismarck&quot; class===

 and were the last and largest battleships completed by the German navy, as well as the heaviest ever built in Europe. They were built according to the terms of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement signed in 1935, and ostensibly displaced no more than the specified in the agreement. The ships were, in actuality, some heavier at full load. The ships were built to counter new French battleships then under construction.

Both ships saw combat during World War II. was deployed in May 1941 to raid British shipping in the Atlantic Ocean along with the heavy cruiser . During the operation, sank the battlecruiser and heavily damaged the new battleship and forced her to retreat. All of the available British naval assets were mobilized in a massive hunt to track and destroy . Several days later, was disabled by a torpedo hit from a Fairey Swordfish launched from and subsequently destroyed by the battleships and on 27 May.

″s career was less active; she spent the majority of the war as a fleet in being in occupied Norway. The Royal Navy attempted to sink her with midget submarines, but these efforts were unsuccessful. In November 1944, RAF Lancaster bombers hit the ship three times with bombs, which caused her to capsize and sink. The wreck was eventually broken up in 1948–1957.

===H-class proposals===

The H-class was a series of battleship designs to fulfill the requirements of Plan Z in the late 1930s and early 1940s. The first variation, &quot;H-39&quot;, called for six ships to be built, essentially as enlarged s with guns. The &quot;H-41&quot; design improved the &quot;H-39&quot; ship with still larger main guns, with eight weapons. Two subsequent plans, &quot;H-42&quot; and &quot;H-43&quot;, increased the main battery yet again, with pieces, and the monstrous &quot;H-44&quot; design ultimately resulted with guns. Due to the outbreak of war in 1939, none of the ships were ever built; only two of the &quot;H-39&quot; ships were laid down, and what work had been accomplished was scrapped shortly thereafter.

<text>Aaron Thomas Bliss (May 22, 1837 – September 16, 1906) was an American politician who served as a U.S. Representative and the 25th governor of Michigan, and was from Saginaw. Bliss Township was named after him.

==Early life in New York==
Bliss was born to Lyman and Anna M. (Chaffee) Bliss in Peterboro, New York and attended the common schools. He was employed as a clerk in a store in Morrisville, New York, in 1853 and 1854 and with the $100 he made there he attended a select school in Munnsville, New York, in 1854. The following year, Bliss moved to Bouckville, a small town in Madison County, New York, where he engaged in mercantile pursuits.

==Civil War==
During the American Civil War, Bliss enlisted as a private in the Peterman Guards of the Tenth New York Volunteer Cavalry, October 1, 1861, and reported for duty at Elmira, New York. After a quick advancement to lieutenant, his regiment formed a part of Kilpatrick&#x27;s Brigade and was ordered to the front, joining the Army of the Potomac. He commanded a squadron from Washington, D.C. during the Second Battle of Bull Run and his rank advanced to captain. He also fought in the battle of Fredericksburg, the Wilderness, Petersburg, Ground Squirrel Church, Stony Creek, South Mountain, Falls Church and Warrenton. Then he was captured on General Wilson&#x27;s raid near Richmond. For six months he was held at the Confederate prisons of Andersonville, Georgia, Charleston, South Carolina, Macon, Georgia, and Columbia, South Carolina, where on November 29, 1864, like the man who would later precede him as governor, Hazen S. Pingree, Bliss escaped from a Confederate prison. He walked near three weeks until he reached General Sherman&#x27;s army at Savannah, Georgia, just two days before its evacuation. Bliss soon rejoined his own command at Petersburg, Virginia, where he remained until the war ended.

==Life in Michigan==
In December 1865, he moved to Saginaw, Michigan and found employment at a shingle mill. With his brother, Lyman W. Bliss, and J. H. Jerome, he formed A. T. Bliss &amp; Company and engaged in the manufacture of lumber and the exploitation of lands along the Tobacco River. On March 31, 1868, he married Allaseba Morey Phelps of Solsville, New York, north of the town of Madison. That same spring the brothers bought the Jerome mill at Zilwaukee, and it became A. T. Bliss &amp; Brother. In 1880, Bliss was one of the organizers and a director of the Citizen&#x27;s National Bank, which was reorganized into the Bank of Saginaw, and was president and director of the Saginaw County Savings Bank.

==Politics==
In 1882, Bliss was elected member of the Michigan Senate from Saginaw County (25th district), and during that time helped establish a soldiers&#x27; home in Grand Rapids. He was appointed aide-de-camp on the staff of Governor Russell A. Alger in 1885, with the rank of colonel, and held the same position on the staff of the commander in chief of the Grand Army of the Republic in 1888.

=== Congress ===
In 1888, Bliss was elected as a Republican from Michigan&#x27;s 8th congressional district to the 51st Congress, serving from March 4, 1889, to March 3, 1891. Among notable bills he introduced were for appropriating $100,000 for a federal building in Saginaw and $25,000 for an Indian school at Mt. Pleasant. He was an unsuccessful candidate for re-election in 1890 to the 52nd Congress, being defeated by Democrat Henry M. Youmans.

After leaving Congress, Bliss resumed the lumber business and also engaged in banking. He was department commander of the Grand Army of the Republic in Michigan in 1897.

=== Governor ===
In 1900, Bliss was elected Governor of Michigan, defeating mayor of Detroit William C. Maybury, and was re-elected in 1902, serving from 1901 through 1904. During his four years in office, the Michigan Employment Institution for the Adult Blind was established in Saginaw, a state highway department was formed, and railroad taxation was sanctioned.

==Retirement and death==
Bliss was a patron of the Home for the Friendless, the Y.M.C.A., the Methodist Church and was also a member of the Freemasons and Knights Templar.

Bliss died less than two years after leaving office at the age of sixty-nine in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, while on a visit for medical treatment. He is interred in Forest Lawn Cemetery in Saginaw, Michigan.

<text>Josh James Brolin (; born February 12, 1968) is an American actor. A son of actor James Brolin, he gained fame in his youth for his role in the adventure film &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985). After years of decline, Brolin had a resurgence with his starring role in the crime film &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; (2007). Brolin received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for portraying Dan White in the biopic &quot;Milk&quot; (2008).

Brolin&#x27;s career progressed with roles in &quot;W.&quot; (2008), &quot;True Grit&quot; (2010), &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot; (2010), &quot;Men in Black 3&quot; (2012), &quot;Oldboy&quot; (2013), &quot;Inherent Vice&quot; (2014), &quot;Everest&quot; (2015), and &quot;Hail, Caesar!&quot; (2016). He gained wider recognition for playing Thanos in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), including in the films &quot;&quot; (2018) and &quot;&quot; (2019), as well as Cable in &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018). Brolin also collaborated with filmmaker Denis Villeneuve in the action thriller &quot;Sicario&quot; (2015) and in the science fiction films &quot;Dune&quot; (2021) and &quot;&quot; (2024), in which he played Gurney Halleck.

== Early life ==
Brolin was born on February 12, 1968, in Santa Monica, California, the son of Jane Cameron (; 1939–1995), a casting director and wildlife activist, and actor James Brolin. Brolin was raised on a ranch in the Adelaida area of Paso Robles, attending elementary and middle school in Templeton, California. Brolin moved to the Santa Barbara area around the age of 11, where he attended Santa Barbara High School. Brolin had little exposure to his father&#x27;s acting career.

Brolin said in a 2014 interview that during his youth, he was a member of a surfing friendship group who called themselves the &quot;Cito Rats&quot;. In his description of the group, Brolin said, &quot;It was Santa Barbara. It was the &#x27;80s. It was punk rock. You either had the children of rich, neglectful parents or children of poor, so it was a mix. But we basically grew up the same way. I&#x27;ve never seen a group like that before or since.&quot; He admitted to stealing cars to pay for his drug use, which included heroin, a drug that he explained he did not like: &quot;I mean, I never got into it and I never died from it, which is a good thing. I&#x27;ve had 19 friends who died. Most of those guys I grew up with, they&#x27;re all dead now.&quot; Brolin later said: &quot;The group of guys that I grew up with, 36 of them are dead. 12 are in jail. 4 are in jail and also dead. I keep careful count, all 36 dead guys. I&#x27;m from a tough environment, ya know?&quot;

== Career ==

===Early work and breakthrough (1980s) ===
Brolin started his career in TV films and guest roles on TV shows before landing a more notable role as Brandon Walsh in the Richard Donner-directed film &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985). Brolin was considered for the role of Tom Hanson in the series &quot;21 Jump Street&quot;; Brolin and Johnny Depp were the finalists for the role, and the two became close and remained friends. The role ultimately went to Depp. Brolin guest-starred in an episode of the show in its first season.

=== Career decline (1990–2006) ===
Brolin played a small role in the 1994 movie &quot;Roadflower&quot;. He has implied that he turned away from film acting for years after the premiere of his second film, &quot;Thrashin&#x27;&quot;, due to what he called his &quot;horrendous&quot; acting. For several years, Brolin appeared in stage roles in Rochester, New York, often alongside mentor and friend Anthony Zerbe. One of Brolin&#x27;s more prominent roles early in his career was that of Wild Bill Hickok in the ABC western TV series &quot;The Young Riders&quot;, which lasted three seasons (1989–92). Two other TV series Brolin was involved in include the Aaron Spelling production &quot;Winnetka Road&quot; (1994) and &quot;Mister Sterling&quot; (2003), both of which were cancelled after a few episodes.

=== Career resurgence and stardom (2006–2016) ===

By 2006, Brolin was trading stocks full time when he booked the lead role in the Coen brothers&#x27; Academy Award-winning film &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; (2007). The film became a critical and commercial success. Brolin would go on to book a part in the similarly successful Ridley Scott film &quot;American Gangster&quot; (2007).

In 2008, Brolin starred in the Oliver Stone film, &quot;W.&quot;, a biopic about key events in the life of George W. Bush. Stone pursued an initially hesitant Brolin for the role. He said of his decision to cast Brolin in the leading role:
Brolin received an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor for his role in Gus Van Sant&#x27;s biopic &quot;Milk&quot; as city supervisor Dan White, who assassinated San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone. He made news by wearing a White Knot to the Academy Awards ceremony to demonstrate solidarity with the same-sex marriage movement. Brolin told an interviewer that co-star Sean Penn, who portrayed Milk, decided to dispel any nerves the actors had about playing gay men by &quot;grabbing the bull by the horns&quot;. At the first cast dinner, which included castmates James Franco, Emile Hirsch and Diego Luna, &quot;[Penn] walked right up and grabbed me and planted a huge one right on my lips&quot;, Brolin said. Brolin has received critical acclaim for his performance and, in addition to his Oscar nomination, received NYFCC and NBR Awards for Best Supporting Actor and a nomination for a SAG Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role.

Also in 2008, Brolin hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, the same night as musical guest Adele. He went on to host again in April 2012 and March 2024.

In 2009, Brolin executive produced and performed in &quot;The People Speak&quot;, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn&#x27;s &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;. The next year, Brolin wrote and directed the short film &quot;X&quot; as his directorial debut. The film is about an inmate who escapes prison to reunite with his daughter and searches for her murdered mother. It was the opening film at the first annual Union City International Film Festival in Union City, New Jersey in December 2010.

In the early 2010s, Brolin would appear in a variety of big-budget studio films. He portrayed the titular character in &quot;Jonah Hex&quot; (2010), based on the DC Comics&#x27; character with the same name. Brolin would later admit that he hated the experience making the film stating that at one point they had to &quot;[reshoot] 66 pages in 12 days&quot;, implying that the filming schedule was hectic. Brolin would go on to blame the film&#x27;s failure on studio interference in the film&#x27;s post-production and on director Hayward, who he called &quot;inexperienced&quot; and a &quot;bad choice (of director).&quot; Brolin also appeared in the Coen Brother film &quot;True Grit&quot; (2010) and in Oliver Stone&#x27;s &quot;Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps&quot; (2010). In 2012, Brolin played the younger version of Tommy Lee Jones&#x27;s character Kevin Brown / Agent K in &quot;Men in Black 3&quot;, which reunited both Brolin and Jones after their initial collaboration in &quot;No Country for Old Men&quot; and &quot;In the Valley of Elah&quot;, both in 2007. Brolin later starred in the 2013 film &quot;Gangster Squad&quot;, portraying a fictional World War II veteran named John O&#x27;Mara. Later that year, Brolin also portrayed Joe Doucett in &quot;Oldboy&quot;, a remake of the 2003 South Korean film of the same name. In 2014, it was announced that Brolin would play Thanos within the Marvel Cinematic Universe. He portrays the character through motion capture performance, as well as voice acting. Brolin cameoed as the character in &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; (2014) and &quot;&quot; (2015).

===International recognition; &quot;Marvel&quot; and &quot;Dune roles&quot; (2016–present)===

Brolin reprised his role as Thanos in a starring role in &quot;&quot; (2018) and 2019&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, which were filmed back-to-back. His performance in the role was critically acclaimed. Writing for Variety, critic Owen Gleiberman called Brolin&#x27;s motion capture performance in &quot;Infinity War&quot; &quot;supremely effective&quot; and said, &quot;Brolin infuses Thanos with his slit-eyed manipulative glower, so that the evil in this movie never feels less than personal.&quot; Writing for The Hollywood Reporter, critic Todd McCarthy similarly said, &quot;Brolin&#x27;s calm, considered reading of the character bestows this conquering beast with an unexpectedly resonant emotional dimension, making him much more than a thick stick figure of a supervillain.&quot;
In April 2017, Brolin signed a four-film contract with 20th Century Fox studios to portray the Marvel Comics character Nathan Summers / Cable in the &quot;X-Men&quot; film series. &quot;Deadpool 2&quot; (2018) was his first installment within that contract. He was set to reprise his role in Fox&#x27;s planned &quot;X-Force&quot; movie until the acquisition of 20th Century Fox by Disney. In February 2019, Brolin joined the cast of Denis Villeneuve&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot; as Gurney Halleck.

In 2021, Brolin voiced an alternate Thanos in &quot;What If...?&quot; series. In October of that year, &quot;Dune&quot; premiered to generally positive reviews.
In April 2022, Brolin starred as Royal Abbot in the Amazon Prime Video series &quot;Outer Range&quot;. He also serves as an executive producer.

In March 2024, &quot;&quot; premiered to rave reviews.
The second season of &quot;Outer Range&quot; appeared on May 16, with Brolin reprising his role and directing an episode. On June 3, 2024, it was announced that Brolin had joined the cast of Rian Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Wake Up Dead Man: A Knives Out Mystery&quot;.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages and family ===

Brolin was married to actress Alice Adair from 1988 until 1994; they have two children, including Eden. He was engaged to actress Minnie Driver for six months. Brolin married actress Diane Lane on August 15, 2004. They divorced in 2013.

In March 2013, Brolin began dating his former assistant and model Kathryn Boyd. They became engaged in March 2015. The couple married on September 24, 2016, and announced on May 29, 2018, that they were expecting their first child. Brolin announced through Instagram on November 4, 2018, that Boyd had given birth to a daughter. Their second daughter was born on December 25, 2020.

=== Arrests ===
On December 20, 2004, Brolin&#x27;s wife at the time, Diane Lane, called the police after an altercation with him, and Brolin was arrested on a misdemeanor charge of domestic battery. Lane declined to press charges and the couple&#x27;s spokesman characterized the incident as a misunderstanding.

On July 12, 2008, Brolin was arrested after an altercation at the Stray Cat Bar in Shreveport, Louisiana, along with actor Jeffrey Wright and five other men who were crew members of &quot;W.&quot; Brolin was released after posting a cash bond of $334. He said to a reporter, &quot;It was nice to be in jail knowing that I hadn&#x27;t done anything wrong. And it was maddening to be in jail knowing that I hadn&#x27;t done anything wrong.&quot; Charges against all seven men were later dropped by Shreveport prosecutors.

Brolin was arrested for public intoxication on New Year&#x27;s Day 2013 in Santa Monica, California. The remainder of 2013 proved very difficult for him, and Brolin later explained: &quot;Well, it was another turning point. It made me think of a lot of things. My mom dying when I was in my twenties. All the impact that had on me that I hadn&#x27;t moved past; I was always such a mama&#x27;s boy. But I realized that I was on a destructive path. I knew that I had to change and mature.&quot; Brolin has been sober from alcohol since 2013.

=== Business interests ===
Brolin started stock trading in his mid-20s and considered quitting acting. In 2014, Brolin explained that he made a large amount of money over a three-year period: &quot;Fear and greed, that&#x27;s all that there is. And I traded very specifically. I found momentum stocks that had room to breathe and I just grab a little of the breath.&quot; Brolin was also co-founder of a now defunct stock trading website called MarketProbability.

<doc id="909449" wikidata="Q1157679" url="?curid=909449" title="Daisy Bates (author)">
<text>Daisy May Bates, CBE (born Margaret May O&#x27;Dwyer; 16 October 1859 – 18 April 1951) was an Irish-Australian journalist, welfare worker and self-taught anthropologist who conducted fieldwork amongst several Indigenous nations in western and southern Australia.

Some of the Pitjantjatjara in Ooldea and the surrounding area referred to Bates by the courtesy name &quot;Kabbarli&quot;, meaning &quot;grandmother&quot;. She was referred to by others as &quot;mamu&quot;, meaning &quot;ghost&quot; or &quot;devil&quot;, and as &quot;that poor old lady at Ooldea&quot;.

It was not until long after her death that facts about her early life emerged, and even recent biographers disagree in their accounts of her life and work. Bates remains a complicated figure in the History of Indigenous Australians as well as in Australian history more broadly. Her work is considered to be an unrivaled source of ethnographic data on the Aboriginal cultures of Western Australia, while her reliability has also been questioned due to false claims she made about her personal history.

==Biography==
===Early life: 1859 to 1882===
Bates was born as Margaret May O&#x27;Dwyer on 16 October 1859, in County Tipperary, in British ruled Ireland. She had six siblings, including a twin brother named Francis. Francis and another sibling, Joe, died young (with Francis dying two weeks after being born). When Bates was four, her mother, Bridget (née Hunt), died of tuberculosis on 20 February 1864. Her Catholic bootmaker father, James Edward O&#x27;Dwyer, now widowed, hired Mary Dillon to look after his six children. Seven months later they were married and attempted to emigrate to the United States, her father however died &quot;en route&quot;, also in 1864.

After her father and stepmother left for the US, Bates and her siblings were split up between relatives. Bates and three of her younger siblings were sent to live with her grandmother, Catherine Hunt, called &#x27;Granny Hunt&#x27; by Bates. After Granny Hunt died in 1868, Bates returned to live with her stepmother, Mary, who had managed to return to Ireland and take over as householder. Bates (now nine years old) and her eldest sister, Kathleen, were sent to the Free National School for Catholic Girls in Dublin. She stayed there until she was nineteen, likely working as a pupil-teacher.

After leaving school, Bates was employed as a family governess in London. Not much is known of her time in London, except that she first met Ernest Baglehole there, who was the son of a wealthy ship and factory owner. Bates was rejected as a bride for Baglehole, who had already been arranged to marry another woman. Bates seems to have then been dismissed from her position. Possibly motivated by humiliation and a desire to start anew, Bates planned to emigrate to Australia.

===Emigration and life in eastern Australia: 1882 to 1894===
On 22 November 1882, Bates boarded RMS &quot;Almora&quot;, en route to Townsville in Queensland, Australia. The trip was part of an immigration scheme, reserved for &quot;Catholic girls of &#x27;good character&#x27; aged between fifteen and twenty-one.&quot; Bates, being twenty-three at the time, lied about her age to be given a government-assisted concessional fare. After arriving in Townsville on 15 January 1883, Bates&#x27;s whereabouts for the next year is unclear. It is known that Bates was in Charters Towers for some period of time before November 1883, as a coroner&#x27;s inquest report into the death/suicide of a man named &quot;Arnold Knight Colquhoun&quot; includes a suicide note that was intended for her.

By the beginning of 1884, Bates had found employment as a governess on Fanning Downs cattle station, outside of Charters Towers. Breaker Morant (aka, Harry Morant or Edwin Murrant) was also employed here, but as a &quot;horse-boy&quot;. On 13 March 1884, they married in Charters Towers. The marriage was not legal; in Queensland, a man had to be at least twenty-one years old to get married and Morant was only nineteen (he claimed to be twenty-one).

About a month later, Bates learned that Morant had paid for neither the reverend nor the jeweller, and that he had stolen several pigs and a saddle. Morant spent only a week in jail for the thefts (the case was dismissed) and shortly afterwards Bates and Morant separated. They never officially divorced, likely due to the cost, divorces only being granted under specific circumstances, and the divorce laws unilaterally favouring men. Bates then moved and kept their marriage a secret.

By the end of 1884, Bates had found employment as a governess and maid on a small property in Nowra, NSW. Here she met Jack Bates on Christmas Eve, the eldest son of her employer and a drover. He proposed a few days later and they married on 17 February 1885. Her marriage certificate gives her age as twenty-one, though she was twenty-five. Due to his occupation, Jack would sometimes spend months away at a time, having to move cattle over great distances.

Bates also married Ernest Baglehole that year on 10 June 1885, at St Stephen&#x27;s Anglican Church, Newtown, Sydney, again claiming to be twenty-one years old. She had received a letter from him three days after her wedding to Jack Bates, who by then had already left for work. It is not known how Baglehole managed to find Bates. Not much is known of their relationship; Bates later burned their letters, wedding photos and her diaries, nor is any record of his death known. It is known that he was already married, had two children, and had arrived in Australia working as fourth-mate aboard the merchant vessel &quot;Zealandia&quot;.

Daisy Bates&#x27;s only child, Arnold Hamilton Bates, was born on 26 August 1886 in Bathurst, New South Wales. While he was officially the son of Jack Bates, some biographers speculate that his actual father was Baglehole. The polygamous nature of Bates&#x27;s marriages was kept secret during her lifetime.

===Return to England: 1894 to 1899===
On 9 February 1894, Bates returned to England for free by taking a job as a stewardess aboard the barquentine, Macquarie. Before leaving she enrolled her son in a Catholic boarding school in Campbelltown, NSW and planned for him to stay with his paternal grandmother during the summer holidays at Pyree. She told her husband that she would return to Australia only when he had a home established for her. She arrived penniless in England as her bank had failed in the recession and her husband had not sent her any more.

After arriving in London, she went home to Roscrea for some time, before returning once again to London. There she found a job working for journalist and social campaigner W. T. Stead. Despite her sceptical views, she worked as an assistant editor on the psychic quarterly &quot;Borderlands&quot;. She developed an active social life among London&#x27;s well-connected and bohemian literary and political milieu.

She left Stead&#x27;s employment in 1896. It is unclear how she supported herself until 1899. That year she set sail for Western Australia after her husband wrote to say that he was looking for a property there.

=== Emigration to Western Australia: 1899 to 1914 ===
==== Growth as a writer: 1899 to 1904 ====
On her return voyage she met Father Dean Martelli, a Roman Catholic priest who had worked with Aboriginal people and who gave her an insight into the dire conditions they faced. It was suggested that she join an expedition to a Catholic Mission at Beagle Bay, near Broome, where a dictionary of Nyulnyul, the local language, was being compiled.

She arrived in Fremantle aboard SS &quot;Stugart&quot; with enough money to buy the lease for a large plot of land named Ethel Creek Station, several hundred cattle, and a block of land in Fremantle. The source of this great sum of money is unknown. She found a Catholic boarding school in Perth for her son, Arnold, and organised for him to stay with another family. She became involved in the Karrakatta Club where she met Dr Roberta Jull.

Shortly after 1900 began, Jack Bates left for Ethel Creek Station and Daisy Bates followed in March. She travelled via a coastal steamship to Cossack, joined Jack and made their way to Ethel Creek Station. After arranging the building of a cattle run and homestead, they began the return journey home; first to Port Hedland and then Carnarvon by buggy, and then to Perth via steamer.

In August (no more than a month after arriving back in Perth), Bates joined Bishop Matthew Gibney and Father Martelli to the mission at Beagle Bay. Before arriving, they stayed in Broome for a few weeks. While there, Bates witnessed the sex trafficking of Aboriginal women within the pearling industry. While in Beagle Bay, Bates assisted in nursing unwell Aboriginal women, repairing buildings, fences and wells, and in yarding cattle.

 They had returned to Perth by March 1901. She was invited to a garden party at Government House on 24 July 1901, where she met George V; he retrieved her umbrella after she had dropped it, making the umbrella a treasured heirloom of hers. Bates soon published two articles in Western Australia&#x27;s Department of Agriculture&#x27;s journal. The first article, titled &quot;Possibilities of Tropical Agriculture in Nor&#x27; west&quot;, was published in July 1901 and is primarily focused on the agricultural successes of the mission at Beagle Bay. The second article, titled &quot;From Port Hedland to Carnarvon by Buggy&quot;, was published two months later and was an account of her trip with Jack after leaving their cattle station.

In February 1902, the Bates family moved to Broome, where Jack had a job on Roebuck Plains Station. They left on a droving trip with 700–1000 cattle in April. They headed south along the coast, followed De Grey River inland, crossed to Roy Hill Station where 500 cattle were left, and then arrived at Ethel Creek Station. The drive was a failure as 200 cattle intended for Ethel Creek station were lost. Bates rested at the station before leaving, she arrived in Perth on 21 November 1902. Over was covered in this six month long trip and it would provide material for a series of articles titled &quot;Through the Nor-West on a Side-Saddle&quot;. These were published in the Catholic paper, The W.A. Record, which was managed by Bishop Gibney and who had hired her as a journalist. Her first published writings on Aboriginal Australians are in these articles, many of which use deprecatory language. In the articles she published soon after the trip, as well as in the article she published twenty years later, she omitted any mention of Jack.

During 1901 and 1902, Bates had collected information on various dialects, practices and oral histories of the peoples of the Kimberley region. This material went largely unpublished until 1985.

Bates&#x27;s employment at the W.A. Record ceased sometime in May 1903. On 4 August she became the first woman to publish an article in the engineering journal, &quot;Cassier&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. She omitted her gender by signing the article as &quot;D.M.B&quot;. In December she was hired by the Western Mail to write a series of articles on mining in the Murchison goldfields of Western Australia, which she travelled through for three months.

==== Beginning of anthropological career: 1904 to 1914====
On 3 May 1904, the Registrar General of Western Australia, Malcolm Fraser, temporarily appointed her to research Aboriginal customs and languages. She started by compiling a questionnaire which was &quot;sent to white males who exercised some measure of control over Aboriginal people&quot; and by reading ethnographic material held by libraries across the state.

On May 24, Bates responded to a letter in The Times that had argued Western Australia to be a slave state due to many Aboriginal workers being indentured on pastoral stations. Bates claimed that Western Australia was doing more for Aboriginal people than any other state, denied that the indenture system was cruel, and wrote that most station owners were humane and &quot;will not wantonly ill-treat their natives.&quot;

In 1905 she learned of the Welshpool Aboriginal Reserve, called Maamba by the Noongar people; it was 6 km from Cannington, at the foot of the Darling Range. After visiting a few times, she set up camp for a short period and interviewed a number of Noongar Elders (including Fanny Balbuk). She wrote an article on the customs of the Aboriginal people of Western Australia, focusing on marriage laws.

Her position was originally to last one year but she managed to repeatedly extend her position until it ended in 1910. Over this time she conducted further fieldwork: she visited towns and &quot;reserves&quot; through much of the South-West, as far east as Kalgoorlie and as far north as Wilgie Mia. This work would result in her book, &quot;The Native Tribes of Western Australia&quot;, which would not be published until 1985 after being edited by anthropologist Isobel Mary White.

She sent two copies of her work to Andrew Lang who shared her work with Alfred Radcliffe-Brown as Brown was to lead an ethnological expedition to Western Australia, funded by Cambridge University. The expedition was composed of Brown and his assistant, E. L. Grant Watson. Colonial Secretary, James Connolly, wishing to end Bates&#x27;s employment and the government&#x27;s costly responsibility of publishing her book, had Bates&#x27;s superior, Frederic North, broker an agreement with Brown; in return for the government paying her salary for six months, she would join the expedition and Brown would take responsibility for publishing her book. For the duration of the expedition, Bates was appointed as a Travelling Protector of Aborigines, becoming the first woman to hold the role in Western Australia. Her appointment &quot;required her to police the moral behaviour of Aboriginal women and girls and clear the Aboriginal camps she visited of children of mixed ethnicity.&quot; On 13 October 1910, they left Fremantle for Geraldton via steamer. In less than a month, Bates reported at least two Aboriginal children so that they would be taken away by police.

 From Geraldton they traveled by train to the outskirts of the town, Sandstone. They joined a group of camping Aboriginal people and began their anthropological work, which included making lists of essential words. During their fourth morning there, the camp was raided by mounted police, resulting in the camp being quickly abandoned. Among those taken by police was some number of young bi-racial Aboriginal girls, Bates again assisted the police in this. They left for the lock hospitals on Dorre and Bernier Island where Aboriginal people infected with syphilis and other misidentified infections were being forcibly taken; more than 40% would not return to their homelands. From November 1910 to February 1911, Bates and Brown conducted interviews on both of the islands, as well as in and around Carnarvon at camps and its jail.

On 9 April they boarded a steamer together and returned to Perth, where Brown requested the government to extend Bates&#x27;s employment for six months but only two months were granted. Brown continued his research north of Carnarvon and Bates continued hers in Meekatharra and Peak Hill, where she spoke with Wajarri people. When her appointment ended in June, Brown retained her services as a researcher. She applied for the position of Protector in the newly created Northern Territory and as a Travelling Inspector in July. She was rejected on the grounds that she did not have the necessary medical qualifications. Bates travelled to Katanning in mid-July, where she and a doctor aided Noongar people infected with measles. She wrote an article for the Western Mail and The West Australian on this experience.

By October, Bates&#x27;s work for Brown was complete and they returned to Perth. Brown renegotiated his agreement with the government so that he was no longer required to publish Bates&#x27;s manuscript. Bates then spent some time on Rottnest Island, which was being used as a holiday camping destination and as a forced labour prison for Aboriginal people. She left in February 1912.

Brown returned his (often critically annotated) copy sometime in 1912, this being after Bates had written to him in April. Bates then submitted her manuscript to the State Government for publication but the recently elected Premier John Scaddan returned it to her (also in 1912) to publish at her own expense. In June she advertised the leaseholds for her cattle station, Glen Carrick, for the amount required to publish. Andrew Lang, who had been helping Bates edit her manuscript, suffered a fatal stroke on 20 July 1912.

In November, Bates was gazetted as a honorary Protector in the remote Eucla district until 31 December 1913. This was an unpaid position. That same month she left for Eucla via steamer from Albany. She met a Miss Beatrice Raine and Mr Raine (brother and sister) somewhere before reaching Albany and the group proceeded to travel together. From Eucla they travelled 190 km east, aboard a camel buggy, to Nullabor Plains Station which covered and which Mr Raine managed. She stayed at the station until October 1913, leaving as Mr Raine&#x27;s employment was about to end.

She returned to Eucla and began to build trust with the Mirning people living there. Camping far outside of town, de Vries says that Bates &quot;overcame loneliness by keeping herself busy and befriending the Aborigines she interviewed.&quot; De Vries also says that: 

De Vries speculates that this was the first sign of Bates&#x27;s vascular dementia and that her diet during the periods she camped lacked various nutrients and contributed to her dementia.

Restarting her ethnographic work, she camped in and travelled the area, interviewed various Mirning people and observed initiation ceremonies. She continued to write newspaper articles during this time as they were her only source of income. She did this until March 1914, this being when she learned her bank had received the first deposit for the sale of her pastoral leases (the money was sent to her account in August).

=== South Australia: 1914 to 1951===
She hired a camel buggy and in May travelled to Yalata Station with a married couple, Balgundra and Gauera; the former being a Mirning man, the latter being a Wirangu woman and both of whom she had developed a friendship with. At Yalata Station, Balgundra and Gauera returned to Eucla aboard the camel buggy. Bates stayed for a month; she left for Adelaide in June aboard a steamer.

On 29 July, Bates was interviewed by the South Australian Government&#x27;s &quot;Committee of Inquiry into Aboriginal Affairs&quot; at Parliament House. She objected to any policy which brought Aboriginal people into missions or allowed them to gather near towns. She instead advocated for her own appointment as a Protector of Aborigines, a salary of £200 a year and that she be equipped with a camel buggy. With this, she said that she would travel the region, find camps of Aboriginal people and act as &quot;an intermediary between them to help settle their quarrels and help protect them from their own people and the whites.&quot;

The British Association for the Advancement of Science&#x27;s congress opened in Adelaide on the 3rd of August. Bates attended the congress over the coming weeks in Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney. On the third day of the congress it was announced that the United Kingdom, and by extension Australia, had joined World War I. At the congress in Sydney she met future anthropologist, Olive Pink, who she would correspond with. Arnold, Bates&#x27;s son, was living in Sydney and was about to join the war. While there Bates saw Arnold for the second last time, it was also the only time she ever met her daughter-in-law and grandson.

At the congress, Brown presented a paper titled &quot;Varieties of Totemism in Australia&quot;. Bates said Brown presented a paper titled &quot;The Myths and Legends of the Western Australian Aborigines&quot; and that after his presentation she was invited to comment; she complimented him on presentating her work so well that she had nothing to add. Only Bates&#x27;s account of this event exist. While Brown is known to have plagiarised others on multiple occasions, whether or not he plagiarised Bates is uncertain. Anthropologists Isobel White and Rodney Needham agreed, in the very least, that Brown did not give Bates due credit for her work.

In September, Bates returned to Adelaide from Sydney. Sometime after November Bates had returned to Yalata Station at Fowlers Bay, being hosted by the owners again. While there she received the news that her application for the position of a Protector had been rejected. Largely due to the war reducing market for her articles, there is little information regarding Bates for the next four years, though it is known that she continued her ethnographic work.

In early 1918, Bates had written to William Hurst, the editor of The Argus and The Australasian, with a new article of hers. This led to a long professional relationship, where Hurst published all but one of the dozens of articles Bates sent to him until he retired in 1937. In August Bates wrote to the Australian Army, wanting to know the whereabouts of her son, Arnold, whom she had not heard from since early that year. She was told his whereabouts and &quot;no doubt wrote to him&quot; but she continued to not receive word. In September she wrote to the Chief Protector William South, asking for assistance due to her poor health and dire financial circumstances. By October Bates had experienced two breakdowns, both were physical and mental.

In early 1919 Bates received word from William South, £50 was included, as well as the position of matron at a home for wounded soldiers in Myrtle Bank, South Australia. After resting for a couple weeks near Adelaide, Bates assumed the position. In early May, after two months &quot;or so&quot;, Bates resigned due to the physical demands of the job being too great for her.

==== Time at Ooldea: 1919 to 1935 ====
Ooldea, a small settlement and railway depot along the Trans-Australian Railway, had a number of Aboriginal people migrating there due to its permanent water soak and the drought that had stricken the region to the north. Concerned that contact between the settlers and Aboriginal people would harm the latter (particularly women and girls), Bates advocated that Aboriginal people be prohibited from nearing the railway by . The Women&#x27;s Non-Party Political Association supported her; they advocated for her appointment as a Justice of the Peace, be employed as a Protector, and that she be given a rail pass to freely patrol the line. They wrote newspaper articles and to government officials, they also organised public meetings but none of their requests were granted. On 25 September 1919, Bates left for Ooldea by train.

At Ooldea, Bates provided rudimentary medical aid to sick or injured Aboriginal people; she prepared food and applied salves and bandages. Much of her time was spent doing this; Bob Reece said she &quot;underwent a subtle transition from a woman of science... to someone more like a welfare worker.&quot; The anthropological research she conducted there was primarily focused on material culture and secondarily on linguistics. She collected a wide range of culturally significant items and documented details regarding their utility, origin and production. She sent many of these to dealers, collectors and museums; she refused to accept money for them. Of the investigative research that she did conduct, much of it was gathered after providing rudimentary medical aid to sick or injured Aboriginal people.

Bates&#x27;s time at Ooldea taxed her mental and physical health. While there, she:
*Had two breakdowns, both likely due to depression.
*Developed dysentery and had to be cared for by Ms Bolam, the station master&#x27;s wife.
*Had a finger &quot;poisoned&quot; after burying an Aboriginal man who had died of syphilis.
*Was blinded for three weeks due to conjunctivitis in November 1920. Despite seeing an eye specialist during her last visit to Perth in May 1921, her eyesight troubled her for years to come.

In March 1920, Bates wrote to Chief Protector William South with concerns that the local police constable was not properly distributing rations. South went to inspect the situation himself. After doing so, the responsibility of ration distribution was given to the pump engineer and all communications between Bates and the South Australian Government ceased.

In July, Edward VIII, then the Prince of Wales, visited Cook Siding, four train stops west of Ooldea, to watch a series of dances by various Aboriginal peoples, as well as displays of boomerang and spear throwing. Bates had been asked by the Federal Government to organise this event. As they watched, Bates explained the significance of the dances to the prince. According to historian Bob Reece, Bates considered the Prince&#x27;s visit one of the highest points of her time at Ooldea and, according to Susanna de Vries, it was one of the high points of her life.

In June, Bates published an article where she criticised the government&#x27;s recent creation of a Aboriginal reserve and advocated for a &quot;woman patrol&quot; to prevent the movement of Aboriginal people into non-Aboriginal settlements. In the article, she also claimed that various Aboriginal peoples were cannibals, including one group which she said &quot;kill for the delight of drinking the blood of their victims&quot;. Aboriginal civil-rights leader, William Harris, wrote an article in response and said bi-racial Aboriginal people could be of value to Australian society. Bates replied, &quot;as to the half-castes, however early they may be taken and trained, with very few exceptions, the only good half-caste is a dead one.&quot; That August, Bates published her first article focussed on cannibalism.

Sometime in 1926, Bates&#x27;s first of many articles in The Children&#x27;s Newspaper was published. The owner, Arthur Mee, would be a great source of financial and moral support for years to come. In June or May, the artist and future anthropologist, Olive Pink, visited Bates at Ooldea for five days. While there, Bates taught Pink the basics of her ethnography. Her visit inspired Pink to follow Bates in pursuing a life of ethnographic research in a remote community. Bates described Pink&#x27;s visit as &quot;a delight&quot;.

In June 1932, journalist and author, Ernestine Hill, visited Bates at Ooldea for five days to interview her. Hill&#x27;s article was widely syndicated, providing Bates with much publicity. The article&#x27;s focus was Bates&#x27;s camplife, her work, Bates being unaware of developments in popular culture, and an invented tale of Bates being Irish nobility. Hill published a second article on Bates two weeks after the first. Bates and Hill regularly corresponded after the visit and became close friends.

In late July, Arnold, Bates&#x27;s son, visited her at Ooldea. She refused to let him inside her campsite as it was off-limits to men and she claimed that the local Aboriginal people &quot;would not believe he was her son.&quot; He instead slept outside of her campsite. This annoyed Arnold and he left early next morning. This would be the last time Bates would have contact with Arnold.

From 1932 to 1933, in what would be referred to as the Caledon Bay crisis, five fishermen and a policeman were killed by a group of Yolgnu men. This received much national and international publicity and, in August 1933, Bates was consequently invited to Canberra to advise on Aboriginal affairs in the north. She advised that Aboriginal peoples ought to be left alone so that they could live peacefully before their inevitable extinction, she also offered to personally intervene in conflicts involving any of the Aboriginal peoples in northern Australia. She returned to Ooldea after three weeks, on 23 September. At Ooldea, Bates found that the missionary, Annie Lock, had begun erecting buildings for a mission. Supported by the South Australian Government and United Aborigines Mission, Lock was given rations to distribute to Aboriginal people. Dental and medical care were provided, and a school was opened. Bates, feeling that her campsite had been &quot;jumped&quot;, was brought to tears.
In 1935, with the encouragement of Hill, and likely spurred by the death of Jack (her estranged husband) in April, Bates left Ooldea on 7 May for Adelaide.

==== Fame &amp; final years: 1935 to 1951 ====
An advance of £500, accommodation at the South Australian Hotel and a shared office with Hill at The Advertiser were arranged for Bates to produce a series of autobiographical articles. Due to her near blindness, failing short term memory, and growing difficulty in telling a cohesive story, Bates dictated while Hill transcribed. Hill then edited what became a series of 21 articles titled &quot;My Natives and I&quot;. The first article was published on 4 January 1936 and the series was widely syndicated. Hill received no formal acknowledgement for her involvement, this was initially at her request; as early as April she asked otherwise but Bates never gave a public acknowledgement.

In April 1936, the federal government hired Edith Watts, a typist, to prepare Bates&#x27;s large collection of notes for donation to the National Library of Australia. Bates was also provided an allowance of £2 a week and an office.

&quot;My Natives and I&quot; began being edited into a novel by Hill and then a Max Lamshed. The editing process distressed Bates and her financial situation quickly deteriorated due to her rapid spending. Consequently, in January 1937 she set up camp in Pyap ( from Adelaide) and became very involved in the local school. Her poor financial situation was exasperated with the new owners of Hurst&#x27;s newspapers not accepting her articles.

The manuscript was sent to London at the end of 1937 to be edited. The finished novel, titled &quot;The Passing of the Aborigines&quot;, was published in November 1938. Bates&#x27;s eyesight had worsened: she couldn&#x27;t read her book until she had surgery in January 1939. The book granted Bates an international reputation as an expert on the Aboriginal peoples of Australia, lent considerable authority to the belief that Aboriginal people would go extinct, and became a staple text in Australian school curriculums during the 1940s and 50s.

Watts continued preparing Bates&#x27;s notes for donation while Bates remained at Pyap. The collection was deposited in February 1941, whereby Bate&#x27;s allowance, which had increased to £5 5s, came to an end. She was interviewed by the ABC on radio that same month, she abhorred the technology, felt that she had no sense of control and became paranoid. When she returned to Pyap, she burned most of the letters that she had ever received, as well as the diaries she had kept since 1899.

In April 1941, Bates returned to her tent life at Wynbring Siding (a station east of Ooldea), wishing to continue her work with Aboriginal people. She began writing paranoid letters to the government. After she sent one that expressed concern for her safety, a government official investigated but found her concerns to be unfounded, he concluded that &quot;She is just a little bit mental I think&quot;. In January 1945, growing concerns for her health resulted in two police-officers forcefully bringing her to Port Augusta for care.

In March, she was transferred to Adelaide for care, she ran away in November. She briefly roamed before paying for accommodation in Streaky Bay. Hill visited Bates for two weeks. When Hill left, Bates gave her an unedited collection of stories from Aboriginal religions and mythologies for her to edit into a children&#x27;s book. Hill did not but in 1972 it was published by novelist Ker Wilson and illustrated by Harold Thomas, it was titled &quot;Tales told to Kabbarli: Aboriginal legends collected by Daisy Bates&quot;.

In mid-1948, Bates moved to Beatrice Raine&#x27;s house in Adelaide, where she stayed for over a year. While there she tried to contact her son, Arnold, through the Returned and Services League of Australia, but she continued to receive no word from him.

Her last 18 months were spent at a nursing home in Adelaide. On 18 April 1951, aged 91, Bates fell asleep and died. She was buried at Adelaide&#x27;s North Road Cemetery on 20 April. Her grandson, Ronald, was her only family to attend. Her will, written in 1941, contained the wish that her estate and all future royalties be used to aid Aboriginal people who were living in &quot;the district of Ooldea and in Western Australia&quot;. The University of Adelaide was her executor.

==Involvement with Australian Aboriginal peoples==
Bates was influenced by the pseudoscience of Social Darwinism and believed that Aboriginal Australians were primitive and &quot;physically uncivilizable&quot;. She consequently believed, as did many others in her time, that Aboriginal Australians were a &quot;dying race&quot;. Therefore, her mission was to &quot;smooth the dying pillow&quot; and to record as much as she could before they disappeared. Bates devoted 40 years of her life to studying Aboriginal peoples&#x27; cultures. Evaluations of the work she conducted over this time have varied greatly.

Many contemporaries were highly critical of her. Two activists for Aboriginal civil rights, William Harris and Mary Bennett, considered her to be one of the worst enemies of the Aboriginal peoples and that she exploited them for her own gain. Medical practitioner and geologist, Herbert Basedow – who had led an expedition through the north-west of South Australia and inspected the health of Aboriginal people at Ooldea in 1920 – was critical of Bates&#x27;s claims of cannibalism and thought that she was &quot;wildly exaggerating&quot;. 

The international success of Bate&#x27;s book, &quot;The Passing of the Aborigines&quot;, granted her the popular reputation as an expert on the Aboriginal peoples of Australia. However, the book only further damaged her reputation among academics. Anthropologist, Ted Strehlow, wrote in 1968 that it was &quot;riddled with inaccuracies&quot; and marred by baseless tales about cannibalism. Professor of Anatomy at the Univeristy of Adelaide, Andrew Abbie, wrote in 1969 that because of Bates&#x27;s claims of cannibalism, he &quot;strongly suspected Mrs. Bates was equally in error in [other] fields&quot;. Anthropologists, Ronald and Catherine Berndt, who conducted fieldwork at Ooldea in 1941, wrote in 1977 that Bates&#x27;s &quot;notes are the only ones available for some groups of Aboriginals&quot; but that her work never became &quot;seriously anthropological&quot; and left much to be desired.

Bates&#x27;s book, &quot;The Native Tribes of Western Australia&quot;, is the end product of nearly a decade of research conducted by her throughout the South-West of Australia. Anthropologist, Isobel White, edited the book, enabling it to be published in 1985. White considered that the book would &quot;remain [Bates&#x27;s] greatest contribution to our knowledge of Aboriginal life-styles before these were changed by contact with Europeans&quot;. She explained that Bates&#x27;s success was due to her living with the people she studied and by &quot;sitting on the ground and sharing her food with them, observing their behaviour and listening&quot;. This research method would not be common in anthropology for many years. She believed there no reason to doubt the accuracy of Bates&#x27;s research and that it compares well to her contemporaries. White noted that her personal attitudes &quot;coloured&quot; her interpretations; she described Bates&#x27;s contradictory views on the role of women in Aboriginal societies as evidence.
Anthropologist Edward McDonald, and heritage consultant Bryn Coldrick, make the case that Bates &quot;approached her ethnographic work in a &#x27;professional&#x27; manner, though no doubt changes in her work practices as she aged need to be accounted for.&quot; They compare her ethnography favourably with her contemporaries, describe how she tested the reliability of the data she collected and pioneered several research techniques. They suggest &quot;that in some respects Bates was ahead of her time&quot; but she ultimately &quot;remained a pre-modern Edwardian anthropologist&quot;.

===Digital database===
The Digital Daisy Bates project was the digitisation, transcription and geocoding of the word lists compiled by Bates in the 1900s. The geocoding allows the origin of the words and wordlists to be presented on a map. The project is co-ordinated by Nicholas Thieberger.

== Bates&#x27;s fictitious claims ==
Daisy Bates made many false claims about her personal and professional history. Many of her biographers speculate on the reasons for this. Many of her claims have only been found to be untrue long after her death. For example, she claimed that:

*Her family to be landowning Irish Anglican aristocracy, when in fact her parents were poor Catholics and &quot;lived in modest circumstances above the family bootery&quot; which they rented.
*Her return to Australia in 1899 was partly motivated by &quot;The Times&quot; accepting an offer of hers to investigate claims of cruel treatment of Aboriginal people in Western Australia. She claimed that she conducted this investigation in 1900 during her trip with Jack Bates to Ethel Creek Station. The likelihood of this is disputed by recent biographers. They note that no formal assignment has been found and that one of her first published articles (From Port Hedland to Carnarvon by Buggy, published in 1901) is her account of this trip and is primarily concerned with agricultural matters; In it she makes a singular and racist reference to Aboriginal people, where she said: &quot;The men were mostly fine looking but the women looked very inferior.&quot;
*Jack Bates, her husband and father of her child, had died long before he had actually done so. She started claiming that he was dead from about 1912 onwards. He died in Mullewa, Western Australia, near Geraldton, in 1935. She did not attend the funeral.

Bates also made many false claims regarding cannibalism among Aboriginal people. While some Aboriginal peoples practiced cannibalism (much of which was done as part of mortuary rituals and involved only parts of the body), Bates developed what has been described as a &quot;fixation&quot; and as a &quot;morbid preoccupation&quot; later on in her life. De Vries notes that &quot;This became worse in her seventies and eighties as her dementia increased&quot; Over forty such references can be found in tabloid newspapers. Eleanor Hogan says that &quot;it wasn’t until she began camping at Ooldea that she persistently advocated this practice was rife across the country.&quot; In 1920, Bates claimed that Nyan-ngauera, a pregnant Aboriginal woman, &quot;had given birth then killed and shared the baby with her surviving child.&quot; To support her story, she sent a box of bones to the South Australian Museum but the bones were identified as those of a cat.

==Personality and appearance==
Bates was known for her strict lifelong adherence to Edwardian fashion, which included wearing a coat, corset, ankle length skirt, boots, gloves and a veil. She remained physically fit into her late eighties and maintained a morning skipping-rope routine until then. In earlier years she did calisthenic exercises and used dumb-bells. She carried a .32 revolver during her time in the outback, she was a good enough shot to hunt game, which included rabbits.

Bates said that in her younger years she liked to &quot;Just meet, love, then part—perhaps never see each other again. It was fun that way.&quot; She swore off ever having sex again after the birth of her son, Arnold. Bates had an eccentric personality and she grew more eccentric in her later years as her dementia worsened. She was a: great admirier of Charles Dickens, anti-unionist, non-denominational Christian, supporter of dictators (including Adolf Hitler, who she claimed to have written to before WW2), and a supporter of the British Empire and monarchy. Many of her contemporaries found her personality to be autocratic; her secretary believed that her difficulty working with others was why she spent so much time in the desert.

==Recognition and memberships==
In 1907 she was:
*Elected a member of the Victorian branch of Royal Geographical Society.
*Appointed an honorary corresponding member of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland.
In May 1934, Bates received a Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire (CBE).

==In popular culture==
*Marjorie Gwynne&#x27;s 1941 painting of Bates shows her sitting at a desk sorting through correspondence. The portrait now hangs in the Art Gallery of South Australia.
*Sidney Nolan&#x27;s 1950 painting &quot;Daisy Bates at Ooldea&quot; shows Bates standing in a barren outback landscape. It was acquired by the National Gallery of Australia.
*An episode in her life was the basis for Margaret Sutherland&#x27;s chamber opera &quot;The Young Kabbarli&quot; (1964).
*Choreographer Margaret Barr represented Bates in two dance dramas, &quot;Colonial portraits&quot; (1957), and &quot;Portrait of a Lady with the CBE&quot; (1971).
*In 1972, ABC TV screened &quot;Daisy Bates&quot;, a series of four 30 minute episodes, written by James Tulip, produced by Robert Allnutt, with art by Guy Grey-Smith; choreography and reading by Margaret Barr, danced by Christine Cullen; music composed by Diana Blom, sung by Lauris Elms. 
*Her involvement with Aboriginal people is the basis for the 1983 lithograph &quot;The Ghost of Kabbarli&quot; by Susan Dorothea White.
*In 2002, a dramatised documentary about Bates was produced.

<doc id="909451" wikidata="Q333649" url="?curid=909451" title="South American sea lion">
<text>The South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens, formerly Otaria byronia), also called the southern sea lion and the Patagonian sea lion, is a sea lion found on the western and southeastern coasts of South America. It is the only member of the genus Otaria. The species is highly sexually dimorphic. Males have a large head and prominent mane. They mainly feed on fish and cephalopods and haul out on sand, gravel, rocky, or pebble beaches. In most populations, breeding males are both territorial and harem holding; they establish territories first and then try to herd females into them. The overall population of the species is considered stable, estimated at 265,000 animals.

==Naming==
The South American sea lion was classified as &quot;Otaria flavescens&quot; by George Shaw in 1800 and as &quot;Otaria byronia&quot; by Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville in 1820. The two nomenclatures were historically used interchangeably, but &quot;O. flavescens&quot; has become the preferred name. The species is also known by the common name &quot;southern sea lion&quot;, although it is not preferred since the Australian sea lion and New Zealand sea lion also range in the Southern Hemisphere. Locally, it is known by several names, including león marino (sea lion) and lobo marino (sea wolf).

==Description==


The South American sea lion is among the largest of and most sexually dimorphic of the eared seals. Males measure up to in length with a weight of while females reach a length and reach in weight. Pups are born long and weigh . Size differences between the sexes exists in both newborns and juveniles.

Adult males have large heads with short, upturned snouts and long manes which reach the shoulders. The fur is mainly brownish with adult males being dark brown and females being nearly yellowish. Pups are born black but become reddish-brown after their first molt.

==Ecology==
The South American sea lion is found along the coasts and offshore islands of South America, from Peru south to Cape Horn and then north to southern Brazil. Notable breeding colonies include Lobos Island, Uruguay; Peninsula Valdes, Argentina; Beagle Channel, and the Falkland Islands. Some individuals wander as far north as southern Ecuador, although apparently they never bred there. However, the movement ecology of South American sea lions remains poorly understood, although biologging studies in recent years have advanced our understanding of their at-sea movements at some breeding locations. There is no evidence of a winter migration of sea lions from the Falkland Islands.

South American sea lions breed on beaches made of sand, gravel, rocks, or pebbles. They can also be seen on flat, rocky cliffs with tidepools. Sea lion colonies tend to be small and scattered, especially on rocky beaches. The colonies make spaces between each individual when the weather is warm and sunny.

South American sea lions consume numerous species of fishes, including Argentine hake and anchovies. They also eat cephalopods, such as shortfin squid, Patagonian squid, and octopus. They have even been observed preying on penguins, pelicans, and young South American fur seals. South American sea lions may forage at the ocean floor for slow-moving prey or hunt schooling prey in groups, depending on the area. When captured, the prey is shaken violently and torn apart. South American sea lions have been recorded to take advantage of the hunting efforts of dusky dolphins. The sea lions themselves are preyed on by orcas and sharks; at Peninsula Valdes, orcas will beach themselves and grab sea lions near shore.

==Life history==

Mating occurs between December and February. Males arrive first to establish and defend territories, but then switch to defending females when they arrive. Estrus in females usually begins 6 days after the birth of a pup and soon after the copulations start with a peak in January. A male aggressively herds females in his territory and defends from both neighbors and intruders. On rocky beaches, males establish territories where females go to cool off, keeping them until estrous. On cobble or sandy beaches, males have territories near the surf and monopolize females trying to get access to the sea. The number of actual fights between males depends on the number of females in heat. The earlier a male arrives at the site, the longer his tenure will be and the more copulations he will achieve. Males are usually able to keep around three females in their harems, but some have as many as 18.

During the breeding season, males that fail to secure territories and harems, most often subadults, will cause group raids in an attempt to change the &quot;status quo&quot; and gain access to the females. Group raids are more common on sandy beaches than rocky ones. These raids cause chaos in the breeding harems, often splitting mothers from their young. The resident males try to fight off the raiders and keep all the females in their territorial boundaries. Raiders are often unsuccessful in securing a female, but some are able to capture some females or even stay in the breeding area with one or more females. Sometimes, an invading male abducts pups, possibly as an attempt to control the females. They also take pups as substitutes for mature females. Subadults herd their captured pups and prevent them from escaping, much like adult males do to females. A pup may be mounted by its abductor, but intromission does not occur. While abducting pups does not give males immediate reproductive benefits, these males may gain experience in controlling females. Pups are sometimes severely injured or killed during abductions.

Despite being mostly a harem-territorial species, one population in Peru has been recorded having a lek-like breeding system. Here, with its longer ratio of males in comparison to females, the males cluster together and display and try to attract females while allowing then to move freely. The warmer climate also makes the females move constantly to the water, further making the traditional mating system difficult to maintain. The group raids that exist in temperate populations are virtually non-existent here. 

Sea lion mothers remain with their newborn pups for nearly a week before making a routine of taking three-day foraging trips and coming back to nurse the pups. They act aggressively to other females that come close to their pups, as well as alien pups that try to get milk from them. Pups first enter the water at about four weeks and are weaned at about 12 months. This is normally when the mother gives birth to a new pup. Pups gradually spend more time in the nearshore surf and develop swimming skills.

South American sea lions are observed to make various vocalizations and calls which differ between sexes and ages. Adult males make high-pitched calls during aggressive interactions, barks and growls when establishing territories, growls when interacting with females, and exhalations after antagonistic encounters. Females with pups make a mother primary call when interacting with their pups, and grunts during aggressive encounters with other females. Pups make pup primary calls. Some of those vocalizations and acoustic features may support individuality.

==Human interactions==

The Moche people of ancient Peru worshipped the sea and its animals. They often depicted South American sea lions in their art. Two statues of this species are the symbol of the city of Mar del Plata.

Indigenous peoples of South America exploited this species for millennia and by Europeans around the 16th century. The hunting has since gone down and the species is no longer threatened. The species is protected in most of its range. Numerous reserves and protected areas at rookeries and haul-out sites exist for the sea lions. Despite this, protection regulations are not effectively enforced in much of animals&#x27; range.

The overall population of sea lions is considered stable; the estimate is 265,000 animals. They are declining in the Falkland Islands, and in Argentina Patagonia, but are increasing in Chile and Uruguay. Many sea lions of the Peruvian population died in the 1997/1998 el Niño. They still are killed due to their habits of stealing fish and damaging fishing nets.

<text>Liuhebafa quan () is an internal Chinese martial art. It has been called &quot;xinyi liuhebafa&quot; (心意六合八法拳) and is also referred to as &quot;water boxing&quot; () due to its principles.

== History ==
The Song dynasty Taoist sage Chen Tuan is often credited with its origin and development. He was associated with the Taoist Monastery on Mount Hua in Shaanxi Province.

The &quot;liuhebafa&quot; form &quot;zhu ji&quot; () was taught in the late 1930s in Shanghai and Nanjing by Wu Yihui (1887–1958). It is said he had learned the art from three teachers: Yan Guoxing, Chen Guangdi (who learned the art from a monk, Da Yuan and a Taoist, Li Chan), and Chen Helu.

Many of Wu Yihui&#x27;s students had martial arts backgrounds and modified the form to merge it with their own knowledge. This is one of several explanations for its similarities with other martial arts such as &quot;xingyiquan&quot;, &quot;baguazhang&quot;, tai chi and &quot;yiquan&quot;.

== Six Harmonies and Eight Methods ==
The Six Harmonies (六合) and the Eight Methods (八法) are the guiding principles of &quot;liuhebafa&quot; that give it its name.

=== Six Harmonies===
# Body and Mind Combine ()
# Mind and Intent Combine ()
# Intent and &quot;Qi&quot; Combine ()
# &quot;Qi&quot; and Spirit Combine ()
# Spirit and Movement Combine ()
# Movement and Emptiness Combine ()

=== Eight Methods===
# &quot;Qi&quot; ()
# Bone ()
# Shape ()
# Follow ()
# Rise ()
# Return ()
# Retain ()
# Conceal ()

<doc id="909458" wikidata="Q652007" url="?curid=909458" title="Foggy Mountain Breakdown">
<text>&quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; is a bluegrass instrumental, in the common &quot;breakdown&quot; format, written by Earl Scruggs and first recorded on December 11, 1949, by the bluegrass artists Flatt &amp; Scruggs and the Foggy Mountain Boys. It is a standard in the bluegrass repertoire. The 1949 recording features Scruggs playing a five-string banjo.

It is used as background music in the 1967 motion picture &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, especially in the car chase scenes, and has been used in a similar manner in many other films and television programs, particularly when depicting a pursuit scene in a rural setting. In 1968, both the 1949 Mercury Records version and a newly recorded Columbia Records version were listed at one position of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at no. 55.

In 1969, at the 11th Annual Grammy Awards, &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; earned Lester Flatt &amp; Earl Scruggs a Grammy for Best Country Performance, Duo Or Group – Vocal Or Instrumental. In 1999, the 1950 recording of &quot;Foggy Mountain Breakdown&quot; on Mercury Records credited to Lester Flatt &amp; Earl Scruggs was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

In 2002, Scruggs won a Grammy award for a 2001 performance which featured Steve Martin on second banjo, Albert Lee, Vince Gill, and Randy Scruggs on guitars, Marty Stuart on mandolin, Jerry Douglas on dobro, Leon Russell on organ, Gary Scruggs on harmonica, and Paul Shaffer on piano, among others.

In 2004, it was one of 50 recordings chosen that year by the Library of Congress to be added to the National Recording Registry.

Because of its ubiquity and its status as a favorite tune at bluegrass jams and concerts, guitar and mandolin players commonly learn solo breaks to this song that closely mirror the original banjo version. The instrumental is related to Bill Monroe&#x27;s &quot;Bluegrass Breakdown&quot;, which Scruggs helped write. It featured the same opening double hammer-on, but &quot;Bluegrass Breakdown&quot; goes to an F major chord whereas Foggy Mountain Breakdown goes to the G major chord&#x27;s relative minor, an E minor chord.

==Chart performance==

==Various recordings==
*Glen Campbell recorded the song on his 1981 album &quot;Glen Campbell Live&quot;.
*The Cuban Boys engineered an electronica-inspired version of the song for their early EP &quot;Blueprint for Modernisation&quot; (appearing again in their &quot;Art Vs. Commerce – The Singles Collection&quot;).

<text>Aglaia is a genus of 121 recognised species of woody dioecious trees in the mahogany family Meliaceae. They occur in the subtropical and tropical forests of Southeast Asia, northern Australia and the Pacific.

Some species are important timber trees; others have scented flowers, or medicinal properties (the edible fruits duku or langsat have now been placed in the genus &quot;Lansium&quot;). Many have complex biological relationships with their dispersal agents.

== Phytochemistry ==
Species in the genus &quot;Aglaia&quot; synthesize a unique class of highly bioactive chemical compounds known as flavaglines. Over 50 unique compounds of this class have been described so far, including rocaglamide, aglafoline, silvestrol, pannellin, episilvestrol, and ponapensin. They are known for their anti-cancer, anti-fungal, anti-inflammatory and insecticidal properties. Several of these compounds have been shown to be exceptional therapeutic agents for cancer chemotherapy, however further research is needed to develop medicines.

<text>Martha White is an American brand of flour, cornmeal, cornbread mixes, cake mixes, muffin mixes, and similar products.

The Martha White brand was established as the premium brand of Nashville, Tennessee-based Royal Flour Mills in 1899. At that time, Nashville businessman Richard Lindsey introduced a fine flour that he named for his daughter, Martha White Lindsey.

The Martha White brand is probably most associated with its long-term sponsorship of the Grand Ole Opry, a radio program featuring country music. The relationship began in 1948, and has existed continuously since then, making it one of the longest continually running radio show sponsorships known.

A jingle for the flour, written by the Carter Sisters and Mother Maybelle in 1950, was the first Martha White Jingle. The Carter girls also wrote a jingle for Martha White Coffee Time an early morning radio program in 1951 that Martha White sponsored. Nashville songwriter Pat Twitty wrote a jingle in 1953, and was performed from the stage of the Grand Ole Opry by bluegrass music artists Flatt and Scruggs. It is still in use today, having become a bluegrass standard and a signature number of Rhonda Vincent and the Rage. In 1972, Tennessee Ernie Ford became the spokesman for the flour, with the catchphrase, &quot;Goodness gracious, it&#x27;s pea-pickin&#x27; good!&quot;

Packaging for Martha White ingredients (flour, cornmeal) features the likeness of three-year-old Martha White. The commercials for the products stress the fact that they are &quot;self-rising&quot; due to the presence of leavening known by trademarks &quot;Hot-Rize&quot; or &quot;Hot-Rize Plus&quot;. Martha White has expanded its product offering beyond ingredients to include baking mixes.

Martha White merged with Beatrice Foods in 1975. In 1986, Beatrice, newly acquired by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, spun off its specialty foods and nonfood brands as E-II Holdings. E-II attempted to take over American Brands in 1988, but instead American Brands purchased E-II. Martha White was sold off in 1989.

Martha White was purchased by the Pillsbury Company in 1994; the baking products of Pillsbury were spun off in 2001 under the name International Multifoods. The J.M. Smucker Company acquired International Multifoods in 2004. It was sold to Hometown Food, a division of Brynwood Partners, in 2018.

<doc id="909472" wikidata="Q427129" url="?curid=909472" title="John Frith (martyr)">
<text>John Frith (1503 – 4 July 1533) was an English Protestant priest, writer, and martyr.

Frith was an important contributor to the Christian debate on persecution and toleration in favour of the principle of religious toleration. He was &#x27;perhaps the first to echo in England&#x27; of that &#x27;more liberal tradition&#x27; of Zwingli, Melanchthon and Bucer. As his ministry progressed, Frith took greater risks with his stance against the Roman Catholic teachings of Purgatory and Transubstantiation. He was eventually brought before Thomas Cranmer and the Inquisition for his teachings and condemned to be burned at the stake for heresy.

In his revision of Foxe&#x27;s &quot;Book of Martyrs&quot;, author Harold Chadwick writes the following about John Frith: &quot;Master Frith was a young man noted for his godliness, intelligence, and knowledge. In the secular world, he could have risen to any height he wished, but he chose, instead, to serve the Church and work for the benefit of others and not himself.&quot; During his studies, he became acquainted with William Tyndale who deeply influenced Frith&#x27;s beliefs. Like Tyndale and Luther, Frith played an influential role in the Protestant Reformation.

==Early life and education==
John Frith (John Fryth) was born in 1503 in Westerham, Kent, England to Richard Frith the innkeeper of White Horse Inn (now known as Church Gate House.) The house still stands at the gates of the Westerham Parish Church of St Mary the Virgin. His name is recorded in the baptism registry of St Mary&#x27;s Church in 1503. Though much of the church has been renovated several times over the centuries, the original 14th-century font in which Frith was baptised is still used today.
The John Fryth Room was added in the 1960s as a meeting room and there is a stone commemorative plaque in the church surrounds. The extended church choir are known as The John Fryth Singers.

He went to Sevenoaks Grammar School. He was further educated at Eton College before being admitted as a scholar to Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge, although he received his Bachelor of Arts degree as a member of King&#x27;s. While Frith was at Cambridge, his tutor was Stephen Gardiner, who would later take part in condemning him to death. He became proficient in Latin, Greek, and Mathematics.

He also met Thomas Bilney a graduate student of Trinity Hall, and began to have meetings concerning the Protestant Reformation. It may have been at one of these meetings that Frith met with William Tyndale.
After graduating in 1525, Frith became a junior canon at Thomas Wolsey&#x27;s Cardinal College, Oxford. While in Oxford, Frith was imprisoned, along with nine others, in a cellar where fish was stored, due to his possession of what the University&#x27;s officers considered &quot;heretical&quot; books. Frith was released and fled England, joining Tyndale who was then residing in Antwerp.

==Residence in continental Europe==
In 1528 he went to Marburg, where he translated &quot;Places&quot; by Patrick Hamilton. One year later, Frith translated &quot;A Pistle to the Christian Reader: The Revelation of the Anti-Christ; An Antithesis between Christ and the Pope.&quot; He also published &quot;A Disputacion of Purgatorye, divided into thre bokes&quot; in response to Thomas More, John Rastell, and Bishop John Fisher. Rastell was persuaded by this publication and adhered to the Protestant Reformation until his death. Frith explains in his &quot;A Disputation of Purgatory&quot;, that there are two purgatories, &quot;God hath left us two purgatories; one to purge the heart and cleanse it from the filth which we have partly received of Adam … and partly added thereto by consenting unto our natural infirmity. This purgatory is the word of God, as Christ saith.&quot; The second purgatory is Christ&#x27;s cross. &quot;I mean not his material cross that he himself died on, but a spiritual cross, which is adversity, tribulation, worldly depression, [etc].&quot;
During this year of 1528 Frith also got married and had children.

==People he encountered during his life==

When John Frith first began his studies at Cambridge University; he was tutored by Stephen Gardiner, who later became the Bishop of Winchester. Gardiner instilled a &quot;love of learning&quot; in the young Frith, and developed a so-called great loyalty and admiration for the youth. In later years, this loyalty toward Frith ended when Gardiner and Sir Thomas More began to criticize the church, but stopped when they realized that they were only adding fuel to the fire of the heretics.
Frith was called out of Cambridge to attend Oxford University by Thomas Wolsey, who personally gathered young men who excelled in learning and knowledge. Oxford was the first place in which Frith was apprehended and committed to prison under suspicion of being in favor of Luther&#x27;s doctrine. He was released a short time later.

After this, Frith went to London where he made acquaintance with William Tyndale. Tyndale had a huge influence on Frith&#x27;s religious views, and the two encountered much danger for their stance on purgatory. The second time that Frith was imprisoned was when he went to see the Prior of Reading, a friend to whom he retreated when he ran out of money to live on. Upon arriving in Reading, Frith was taken for a vagabond and a rogue. Frith was arrested and put in the stocks. Frith was released with the help and persuasion of Leonard Coxe, who was schoolmaster in Reading, with whom he met and discussed topics such as education, Universities, languages, etc. Coxe went to the magistrates and got him freed because of his pity and admiration for Frith&#x27;s intelligence and eloquence.

Sir Thomas More was the Chancellor of England at the time that Coxe had pushed for and gained Frith&#x27;s freedom from imprisonment. He issued a warrant for Frith&#x27;s arrest on a charge of heresy. Frith was sent to the Tower of London when he was caught trying to escape to Holland. While imprisoned in the Tower, Frith composed a book on his views of purgatory and presented it to a tailor named William Holt, a man who made his acquaintance there. Holt made out to be a friend and supporter of Frith&#x27;s ideas, only to take the composition given him by Frith himself and bring it to the hands of More. Upon reading Frith&#x27;s book, More wrote his own composition in response. Later More would condemn Frith to death, eventually burning him at the stake. Ironically, More was later imprisoned in that same Tower of London for refusing to acknowledge King Henry VIII as supreme head of the Church of England. He was found guilty of treason and beheaded.

==Return to England and arrest==
In 1532, he returned to England, and warrants for his arrest were issued by Thomas More (who at the time was Lord Chancellor). In October he was arrested by the local authorities before he could arrange passage to Antwerp, wearing an elaborate disguise at Milton. While imprisoned for approximately eight months in the Tower of London, Frith penned his views on Communion, fully knowing that it would be used &quot;to purchase me most cruel death.&quot; John Foxe writes of John Frith and his works and writings and of the great chains that were piled onto his body. Frith, in his last days in London&#x27;s Tower, writes a final book, the Bulwark. It has been suggested that Rastell is persuaded to convert to Frith&#x27;s views on Christianity because of the meetings they had together, as well as this final book. Rastell was converted through Frith&#x27;s final arguments in the Bulwark. The Bulwark is an impressive book in its theological content and in its style, at times relaxed, and at other times serious. Frith claims that men sin if the motives behind their good works were to gain favour with God. The emphasis, then, is placed on justification by faith.

Eventually transferred from the Tower to Newgate Prison, Frith refused to stop his controversial writing. When William Tyndale learned of Frith&#x27;s plight, he tried to bolster the prisoner&#x27;s spirits with a pair of letters that still survive. &quot;If your pain&quot;, Tyndale counseled, &quot;proves to be above your strength, pray to your Father in that name, and he will ease it.&quot;

==Polemical use of rhetoric and logic==
John Frith&#x27;s writings are in answer to, or debate with, the beliefs of men such as Bishop John Fisher, Sir Thomas More, and John Rastell.
In 1531 Frith published three attacks on the doctrines of purgatory and transubstantiation, which left him, according to his biographers, a wanted man. The first of these, &quot;A Disputacion of Purgatorye&quot;, answered the apologies for purgatory contained in Bishop John Fisher&#x27;s &quot;Assertonis Lutheranae Confuatio&quot; (1525), in Sir Thomas More&#x27;s &quot;The Supplicacion of Soules&quot; (1529), and in &quot;A New Boke of Purgatory&quot; (1530) by More&#x27;s brother-in-law, John Rastell.
John Frith was unique among the reformers of the early Tudor period in his predilection for polemics and the very weapons of controversy, many of which he fashioned from the figures of rhetoric.

To emphasize his opponents&#x27; venality and thus question the motives for their doctrinal position, he used sarcasm, irony, significatio, and praemunitio.
To prejudice his readers against opponents&#x27; arguments he used praemunitio. A &quot;coulour of Rhetorike&quot;—because Frith uses so many colours to debate against his opponents—which plays an important part in Frith&#x27;s controversial technique is praemunitio, the orator&#x27;s preparation of the audience for some succeeding portion of his speech. Frith uses this device to prejudice his readers either against his opponent&#x27;s entire work prior to dealing with it, or to prejudice them against a particular passage in that work he is about to cite. To impugn his opponents&#x27; competence, he answered them with the texts they themselves had cited.

==Trial and death==
Frith was tried before many examiners and bishops, including Thomas Cranmer, the recently appointed archbishop of Canterbury. He produced his own writings as evidence for his views that were deemed as heresy. He was sentenced to death by fire and offered a pardon if he answered positively to two questions: Do you believe in purgatory, and do you believe in transubstantiation? He replied that neither purgatory nor transubstantiation could be proven by Holy Scriptures, and thus was condemned as a heretic and was transferred to the secular arm for his execution on 23 June 1533. He was burned at the stake on 4 July 1533 at Smithfield, London, for, he was told, his soul&#x27;s salvation. Andrew Hewet, an apprentice tailor, was burned with him. Henry VIII was excommunicated one week later.

==Aftermath==
Thomas Cranmer would himself later subscribe to Frith&#x27;s views on purgatory, and published the 42 articles which explicitly denied purgatory.
Frith&#x27;s works were posthumously published in 1573 by John Foxe.

<text>Protogeneia (; Ancient Greek: means &quot;the firstborn&quot;), in Greek mythology, may refer to:

*Protogeneia, a Phthian princess as the daughter of King Deucalion of Thessaly and Pyrrha, mythological progenitors of the Hellenes. She was the sister of Hellen and Amphictyon, and possibly of Thyia and Pandora II, Melantho (Melanthea) and Candybus. By Zeus, Protogeneia became the mother of Opus, Aethlius, Aetolus and possibly of Dorus.
*Protogeneia, also called Cambyse, daughter of the above Opus. Zeus carried her off from the land of the Epeans and became by her, on mount Maenalus in Arcadia, the father of Opus II. She was later received by Locrus who for being childless, married Protogeneia and adopted her son Opus as his own.
*Protogeneia, a Calydonian princess as the daughter of King Calydon and Aeolia, daughter of Amythaon, and thus sister to Epicaste. By Ares, Protogeneia became the mother of Oxylus of Aetolia.
*Protogeneia, an Athenian princess as the eldest of the daughters of King Erechtheus and probably Praxithea, daughter of Phrasimus and Diogeneia. She and her sister Pandora committed suicide when Erechtheus sacrificed Chthonia, another sister of theirs. Protogeneia&#x27;s other sisters were Procris, Creusa, Oreithyia, Merope while her possible brothers were Cecrops, Pandorus, Metion, Orneus, Thespius, Eupalamus and Sicyon.

<doc id="909477" wikidata="Q1369067" url="?curid=909477" title="Narita Express">
<text>The , abbreviated as N&#x27;EX, is a limited express train service operated in Japan since 1991 by East Japan Railway Company (JR East), serving Narita International Airport from various Greater Tokyo Area stations. Services run approximately half-hourly in the mornings and evenings, and hourly through the middle of the day. The main competition for the &quot;Narita Express&quot; is Keisei Electric Railway&#x27;s &quot;Skyliner&quot;.

==Trains and destinations==

&quot;Narita Express&quot; trains serve various stations in the Greater Tokyo Area. Trains are formed of dedicated E259 series 6-car EMU sets, with all trains passing through Tokyo Station, where services are coupled or uncoupled. Usually, a train from is coupled with a train from to form one train set for the remainder of the journey to Narita Airport (via the Sōbu Main Line and Narita Line). On the return journey, the reverse is true.

The majority of &quot;Narita Express&quot; services do not stop between Tokyo and Narita Airport Terminal 2·3 Station. During rush hours, however, the &quot;Narita Express&quot; serves as a commuter express, stopping at , , , and . The average time between Tokyo and Narita Airport is between 55 minutes and an hour. All seats are reserved, with both Standard and Green (first class) accommodation available.

==Fares==
As of 28 June 2021, regular adult fare for a Narita–Tokyo round trip is ¥5000. A one way fare is ¥2870. If buying from a JR store extra discounts may be available to passengers with a foreign passport or of holder age. There are no extra charges required for the &quot;Narita Express&quot; service for foreign passengers traveling with a Japan Rail Pass.

==Formations==
As of March 2012, services operate as twelve-car formations, as shown below, with car 1 at the Shinjuku/Yokohama end, and car 12 at the Narita Airport end. All seats on the &quot;Narita Express&quot; service are reserved, with Green (first class) car accommodation in cars 6 and 12.

== Access ==
The layout of platforms within Tokyo Station is complex. There are multiple levels with tracks and stations on various of these. There are three main passageways across the width of the platforms namely &quot;north&quot;, &quot;central&quot; and &quot;south&quot; passages. 

To access the Narita Express the easiest way is to find a &quot;north&quot; passageway. If entering from the Yaesu (east) side one traverses this to the Marunouchi (west) side. At some point it is necessary to go to the B1F level (basement floor 1) of the north passageway. 

Coming from Yaesu there is finally a hard left turn that will take passengers to automatic ticket checking gates (with a very small sign for Narita Express) towards the Yokosuka/Sōbu Line platforms (Sōbu 1-2). From the Marunouchi side, the same entrance is seen to be a five way intersection. 

Having passed through the gates, one descends several more floors to the &quot;Narita Express&quot; platform on B5F (5th basement floor). 

At Shinjuku Station, Narita Express trains depart from platforms 5 and 6.

==Interior==
Green (first class) cars have leather-covered forward-facing rotating/reclining seats arranged in 2+2 abreast configuration. Seat pitch is .
Standard class cars have 2+2 abreast seating with forward-facing rotating/reclining seats and a seat pitch of .

==History==

Until 1991, rail service to Narita Airport was limited to the Keisei &quot;Skyliner&quot;, which at the time used a station separated from the terminal complex. JR had initially planned to run a high-speed line, the Narita Shinkansen, to a station underneath the main airport terminal. This plan was abandoned in the 1980s, and the space originally slated for the underground station and Shinkansen tracks was used to connect both the JR Narita Line and Keisei Main Line directly to the terminal. The &quot;Narita Express&quot; began service to the new station on 19 March 1991, and &quot;Skyliner&quot; switched its service to the new station at the same time.

Until March 2004, the &quot;Wing Express&quot; limited express service was introduced to complement the &quot;Narita Express&quot; with one return working a day between Ōmiya/Ikebukuro/Shinjuku and Narita Airport. This service was subsequently replaced by an additional &quot;Narita Express&quot; service.

From the start of the revised timetable on 10 December 2005, &quot;Narita Express&quot; services were made entirely no-smoking.

On 1 October 2009, nine new E259 series EMU trains were brought into service on 10 of 26 return Narita Express services, replacing the 253 series. By June 2010 all Narita Express trains were operated by E259 series equipment.

From the start of the revised timetable on 13 March 2010, &quot;Narita Express&quot; service frequencies were increased with more splitting and combining of trains at Tokyo Station. Service is provided between Narita Airport and Tokyo, Shinjuku and Yokohama every 30 minutes during most of the day. All trains operating to/from Shinjuku now stop at , and all trains to/from Yokohama now stop at the new Musashi-Kosugi Station.

&quot;Narita Express&quot; services were suspended from 11 March 2011 due to the effects of the Great East Japan earthquake and tsunami and subsequent power supply shortage in the Tokyo area. They were partially restored from 4 April 2011, with the remaining pre-earthquake and tsunami timetable and services finally re-instated on 3 September 2011.

Starting in 2014 the Narita Express offered seasonal services on some routes. From , a small number of seasonal trains continued to and on the Yokosuka Line, and from , a small number of seasonal trains continued to and on the Fujikyuko Line. The services to Yokosuka station were discontinued in January 2017 due to low travel numbers, while in March 2019 the Kawaguchiko services were replaced by the new, daily Fuji Excursion limited express.

Due a reduction in international travel caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, services were reduced to a few trains running in the morning and evening from 1 May 2020, with services between and discontinued from 13 March 2021. While services were partially restored from 12 March 2022, services to or were discontinued and more trains began to make stop at . All services were reinstated on 1 October 2022 prior to Japan lifting its entry restrictions for foreign travelers. Outside of peak commuter times about one out of every two services continue to stop at Chiba, with the others running nonstop between and the airport.

<text>Peterboro, located approximately southeast of Syracuse, New York, is a historic hamlet and currently the administrative center for the Town of Smithfield, Madison County, New York, United States. Peterboro has a Post Office, ZIP code 13134.

Because of its most famous resident—businessman, philanthropist, and public intellectual Gerrit Smith—Peterboro was before the U.S. Civil War the capital of the U.S. abolition movement. Peterboro was, according to Rev. Henry Highland Garnet, the only place in the country where fugitive slave catchers did not dare show their faces, the only place the New York Anti-Slavery Society could meet (a mob chased it out of Utica), the only place where fugitive slaves ever met as a group—the Fugitive Slave Convention of 1850, held in neighboring Cazenovia because Peterboro was too small for the expected crowd. Abolitionist leaders such as John Brown, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Tubman, and many others were constant guests in Smith&#x27;s house. So many fugitive slaves headed for Peterboro, and Smith, that there is a book about them, and some never left Peterboro, forming a Black community from an early date.

Here is the comment of a minister, visiting in 1841:

According to abolitionist Julia Griffiths:

This was not true elsewhere in Madison County.

In the 1850 census, the population of Peterboro was 347. In 1859 there were two drug stores, a tailor&#x27;s shop, two groceries, a country dry goods store, the Peterboro Academy, the Fay House (a hotel), and the closed Peterboro Hotel.

The Presbyterian church, not needed by the Presbyterians after 1870, was bought by Gerrit Smith for use as an academy and public hall. It held a small public school for many years. Currently, besides the Town of Smithfield office, it houses the National Abolition Hall of Fame and Museum. Gerrit Smith&#x27;s mansion was lost to fire in 1936, but his office, the Peterboro Land Office, has survived. A Peterboro Area Museum is located in the former schoolhouse of the Home for Destitute Children of Madison County; in 2022 it is open only on Sundays.

== Founding ==
In 1795, Peter Smith Sr., a partner of John Jacob Astor&#x27;s who built his fortune in the fur trade, founded Peterborough, naming the town after himself. Smith moved his family to Peterborough in 1804 and built the family home there, in what at the time was near-wilderness. His son Gerrit changed the spelling of the name to Peterboro.

==Notable people==

===Smith family===
In the 1820s, Gerrit Smith took over the business interests of his father, Peter Smith Sr., managing his family&#x27;s property holdings in the town and the surrounding area. The Peterboro Land Office—the most important surviving building of the Smith estate—was built as his office for these activities. Gerrit Smith&#x27;s commitment to both the abolition and temperance movements led to the Smith estate in Peterboro becoming a stop on the underground railroad. Less successful was Smith&#x27;s temperance campaign, which did not enjoy local support; he built one of the first temperance hotels in the country in Peterboro, but it was not commercially successful. He was reported to be liked by almost all the people of Peterboro. &quot;He does a vast deal of good here.&quot; After John Brown&#x27;s raid, when Smith expected to be indicted, the people of Peterboro were prepared to use force (guns) to prevent his arrest.

Smith was married to abolitionist Ann Carroll Fitzhugh. 
Notable family members include their daughter, philanthropist Elizabeth Smith Miller, their son, ornithologist Greene Smith, their grandson Gerrit Smith Miller, known as &quot;the father of football in the United States&quot;, and their great-grandson Gerrit Smith Miller, Jr., a naturalist.

Elizabeth Cady Stanton, a founder of the women&#x27;s rights movement and first cousin of Gerrit Smith on his mother&#x27;s side, met her husband, Henry B. Stanton, at the Smith home in 1839, where she spent many months. He had come from Utica to Peterboro to speak. Attending abolition meetings in Madison County, she wrote, &quot;I shall never forget those charming drives over the hills in Madison County, the bright autumnal days, and the bewitching moonlight nights. The enthusiasm of the people in these great meetings, the thrilling oratory and lucid argument of the speakers, all conspired to make these days memorable as among the most charming in my life.&quot;

<doc id="909490" wikidata="Q358464" url="?curid=909490" title="Malcolm R. Patterson">
<text>Malcolm Rice Patterson (June 7, 1861 – March 8, 1935) was an American politician and jurist. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1901 to 1906, and as the 30th governor of Tennessee from 1907 to 1911. He later served as a circuit court judge in Memphis (1923–1934), and wrote a weekly column for the &quot;Memphis Commercial Appeal&quot; (1921–1933).

Patterson was one of Tennessee&#x27;s most controversial governors. While praised for quelling the Night Riders of Reelfoot Lake uprising in 1908, he was accused of issuing pardons to political allies, most notably his advisor Duncan Brown Cooper, who had been convicted of murdering his political foe Edward W. Carmack. Patterson&#x27;s veto of a popular prohibition bill in 1909 and his attempts to control the state Democratic primaries in 1910 created a division in the party that allowed Ben W. Hooper to become the first Republican governor elected in the state in nearly 30 years.

==Early life==
Patterson was born on June 7, 1861 as Hamilton Rice Patterson in Somerville, Alabama, the son of Colonel Josiah Patterson (1837–1904), a Confederate cavalry officer and congressman, and Josephine (Rice) Patterson. In 1866, his father changed his first name to &quot;Malcolm.&quot; The family moved to Memphis, Tennessee, in 1872, where Patterson would graduate from Christian Brothers College (now Christian Brothers University). He studied at Vanderbilt University in the early 1880s, and read law with his father. He was admitted to the bar in 1883.

Patterson served as attorney general for Shelby County from 1894 to 1900, when he was elected to the United States House of Representatives. He represented his father&#x27;s old district, the former Tenth District, from 1901 to 1906.

==Governor==

Following the death of Senator William B. Bate in March 1905, Governor James B. Frazier quickly convened the General Assembly and had himself elected to the vacant Senate seat. John I. Cox, who as speaker of the state senate was Frazier&#x27;s constitutional successor (and who helped engineer Frazier&#x27;s election in the General Assembly), then became governor. Former governor Robert Love Taylor, who had for years sought a U.S. Senate seat, was outraged by Frazier&#x27;s actions, and accused Frazier, Cox and Senator Edward W. Carmack of conspiring to control the Democratic Party.

Sensing the party&#x27;s frustration with Cox over the Frazier election, Patterson decided to challenge Cox for the party&#x27;s nomination for governor in 1906. At the party&#x27;s convention in late May, as Patterson and Cox battled for delegates, a rule change allotted Patterson all of the delegates from Davidson County, allowing him to clinch the nomination. Cox was furious, and refused to support Patterson in the general election.

Patterson&#x27;s Republican opponent, Henry Clay Evans, had been gerrymandered out of Congress in 1890, and had long accused state Democrats of fraudulent tactics. Patterson criticized Evans for his support of the Lodge Bill, which would have provided protections for black voters, and suggested that Evans wanted to empower the state&#x27;s African-American population. On election day, Patterson won with 111,856 votes to 92,804 for Evans.

During Patterson&#x27;s term as governor, he created a State Highway Commission, signed legislation that banned gambling on horse races, and enacted food and drug regulations. Patterson was the first governor to occupy a governor&#x27;s mansion (previous governors had lived in hotel rooms), which was purchased by the state, and occupied by successive governors until 1922, when a new residence was built. At the beginning of his second term in 1909, he signed the General Education Act, which created four colleges: East Tennessee State University, Middle Tennessee State University, the University of Memphis, and Tennessee State University. A number of laws aimed at helping workers were also introduced during his tenure.

During the governor&#x27;s race of 1908, Edward W. Carmack, who had lost his Senate seat to Robert Love Taylor two years earlier, challenged Patterson for the nomination. Carmack ran a strong campaign, but Patterson managed to clinch the nomination with just over 50% of the delegates. The Republican Party, which was embroiled in a power struggle between Walter P. Brownlow and Newell Sanders, initially nominated two candidates, T. Asbury Wright (Brownlow&#x27;s candidate) and George Tillman (Sanders&#x27;s candidate), but Wright eventually withdrew.
 
In October 1908, a feud between the West Tennessee Land Company and Obion County residents over control of Reelfoot Lake resulted in two of the company&#x27;s officers, Quentin Rankin and Robert Z. Taylor, being kidnapped by a vigilante group known as the Night Riders. Rankin was murdered by the group, though Taylor managed to escape. Patterson personally led the state guard into Obion County, where they rounded up and incarcerated dozens of Night Riders (several would later be put on trial). This action boosted his popularity, and he defeated Tillman on election day in November, 133,166 votes to 113,233.

Shortly after the election, Patterson became involved in a scandal that would eventually end his political career. Carmack, his former opponent, had published an article ruthlessly mocking Patterson&#x27;s advisor, Colonel Duncan Cooper. On November 8, 1908, Cooper and his son, Robin, encountered Carmack in the street. Gunfire erupted between Carmack and Robin Cooper, killing the former and injuring the latter. Carmack&#x27;s supporters blamed Patterson for the shooting, and at one point sought his impeachment. Both Coopers were convicted of murder, though the elder Cooper was pardoned by Patterson in 1910, leading to widespread outrage. Patterson, who had issued more than 1,400 pardons during his tenure, had previously been accused of abusing the pardon power to free corrupt political allies.

At the beginning of Patterson&#x27;s second term, the state legislature passed two Prohibition measures. One extended the state&#x27;s Four Mile Law, which banned the sale of liquor within of any school, to cover the entire state (the law had previously applied only to towns with populations of less than 5,000). The second banned the manufacture of liquor for sale. Both bills had widespread support, but Patterson vetoed both, arguing that Prohibition, wherever it had been enacted, had failed. The legislature overrode his veto, however, and the measures became law.

By 1910, a rift had developed in the Democratic Party over state primaries. The &quot;Regular Democrats,&quot; led by Patterson, wanted to keep the older system of awarding delegates by county, while the other faction, known as the &quot;Statewiders,&quot; wanted a statewide primary. When Patterson refused to consider a statewide primary, Statewiders withdrew from the convention and nominated their own slate of candidates, allowing Patterson to win the nomination. In state judicial elections on August 4, Statewiders (running as independents) routed the Regular Democrats. Patterson, realizing he had little chance of winning in November, withdrew from the race. His faction quickly nominated former governor and then-United States Senator Robert Love Taylor, but without support from the Statewiders, Taylor was defeated in the general election by Republican Ben W. Hooper.

==Later life==

In 1913, Patterson &quot;converted&quot; to the temperance cause. He joined the Anti-Saloon League, and toured the nation giving lectures calling for Prohibition.

In 1915, Patterson sought his party&#x27;s nomination for U.S. Senate, his opponents being Luke Lea (the incumbent) and Kenneth McKellar. Lea placed third and was thus defeated in the initial round of voting, and McKellar, who had the support of rising political boss E. H. Crump, defeated Patterson in a runoff a few weeks later.

In 1921, Patterson began writing a newspaper column for the &quot;Memphis Herald Courier&quot; entitled, &quot;Day by Day with Governor Patterson,&quot; which covered politics and other topics. In 1923, Patterson was appointed Judge of the First Circuit Court in Shelby County by Governor Austin Peay. He held this position until retiring in 1934. In 1932, Patterson again ran for governor, but was defeated in the primary by Hill McAlister.

Patterson died on March 8, 1935, while on a visit to Sarasota, Florida. He was buried in Forest Hill Cemetery in Memphis.

<doc id="909493" wikidata="Q512547" url="?curid=909493" title="Alfredo Astiz">
<text>Alfredo Ignacio Astiz (born 8 November 1951) is a convicted war criminal and former Argentine military commander, intelligence officer, and naval commando who served in the Argentine Navy during the military dictatorship of Jorge Rafael Videla during the Proceso de Reorganización Nacional (1976–1983). He was known as &quot;El Ángel Rubio de la Muerte&quot; (the &quot;Blond Angel of Death&quot;), and had a reputation as a torturer. He was discharged from the military in 1998 after defending his actions in a press interview.

He was a member of GT 3.3.2 (Task Group 3.3.2) based in the Naval Mechanics School (ESMA) in Buenos Aires during the Dirty War of 1976–1983. The school was adapted as a secret detention and torture center for political prisoners. As many as 5,000 political prisoners were interrogated, tortured and murdered in the ESMA during those years. GT 3.3.2 was involved in some of the 8,961 deaths and other crimes documented by a national commission after the restoration of democratic government in Argentina in 1983.

Astiz, a specialist in the infiltration of human rights organizations, was implicated in the December 1977 kidnapping of twelve human rights activists, including Azucena Villaflor and two other founders of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, and two French nationals, Léonie Duquet and Alice Domon, who were Catholic nuns. None of the twelve were seen alive again outside detention and all were believed killed, rumored to be among the bodies washed up on beaches south of Buenos Aires in late 1977.

At the beginning of the 1982 Falklands War, Astiz surrendered with his team to British forces. Sweden and France wanted to question him about &quot;disappearances&quot; of their nationals at his hands but, considering issues of the Geneva Conventions, the United Kingdom had him questioned by a British policeman. Astiz refused to answer any questions. The UK did not think it had grounds to hold or prosecute him, as he was suspected of crimes committed in Argentina that were not then defined as against international law, and repatriated him. In 1986 and 1987, Argentina passed the Pardon Laws, providing a kind of amnesty to military and security officers for crimes committed during the Dirty War. In 1990, a French court convicted Astiz &quot;in absentia&quot; for the kidnapping of Duquet and Domon, and sentenced him to life imprisonment.

After the Argentine Supreme Court&#x27;s 2005 ruling that the Pardon Laws (&quot;Ley de Obediencia Debida&quot; and &quot;Ley de Punto Final&quot;) were unconstitutional, the government re-opened prosecution of war crimes cases. That year Astiz was detained on charges of kidnapping and torture. A mass grave with several unidentified bodies was found in July 2005 in a cemetery about 400 kilometers south of Buenos Aires; forensic DNA testing identified Duquet, Villaflor, and two other founding Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo. The prosecution of charges against Astiz included murder. Together with numerous other defendants associated with ESMA, Astiz was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in Argentina for crimes against humanity on 26 October 2011.

==Naval career==
Under Lieutenant Commander Jorge Eduardo Acosta, the GT 3.3.2 (Task Force 3.3.2) was based in the Naval Mechanics School (ESMA) in Buenos Aires during the Dirty War. About 5,000 political prisoners were interrogated, tortured, and murdered in the ESMA, or elsewhere by its personnel, during those years. GT332 was involved in some of the 8,961 deaths and other crimes documented by the National Commission on the Disappearance of Persons (CONADEP) after the restoration of democratic government in Argentina in 1983.

===Intelligence officer===
During the Dirty War, Astiz specialized as an intelligence officer with GT 3.3.2 in infiltrating human rights groups in Argentina, particularly those active in Buenos Aires. He used the false name of &quot;Gustavo Niño.&quot; He stayed with a group long enough to identify key members and then organized their abductions by his military forces. Prisoners were taken to the secret detention camp at ESMA and interrogated under torture for information about other members and activities. Most detainees were murdered by the military or death squads.

Astiz was believed to have kidnapped and tortured hundreds of people during 1976 and 1977. Among these were several nationals of other countries, whose cases received international attention as their governments tried to find them and to prosecute suspects. In 1976 and 1977, Astiz&#x27; team kidnapped and &quot;disappeared&quot; three Italian nationals: Angela Maria Aieta in 1976, and Giovanni Pegoraro and his pregnant daughter Susana Pegoraro in 1977. Susana was believed to have given birth in prison before her death, and it was suspected her child was given illegally for adoption by a military family.

On 27 January 1977 Dagmar Hagelin, a 17-year-old girl holding Swedish citizenship through her father Ragnar Hagelin, was shot and wounded by Astiz while attempting to escape capture. From the early 1980s, Ragnar Hagelin battled tirelessly to bring Astiz to justice. His wife and Dagmar&#x27;s mother was an Argentine citizen named Buccicardi. Dagmar Hagelin was never found. In 2000 the Argentine government paid compensation to Ragnar Hagelin and his wife for their loss.

It was reported at the time that Astiz mistook Dagmar Hagelin for a Montonero activist to whom she bore some physical resemblance, and who was a mutual acquaintance of fellow-activist Norma Susana Burgos. Witnesses testified to having seen Hagelin later at the ESMA secret detention and torture center, and alleged that Astiz was in charge of her interrogation. She was never again seen alive.

According to the Argentine Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, tasked with following up Swedish complaints at the time of Hagelin&#x27;s shooting and abduction, Lieutenant Commander Jorge Eduardo Acosta, commander of GT3.3.2, said that 
&quot;setting her [Hagelin] free is out of the question. We must not give in to public opinion. We must appear strong.&quot;His resistance was believed to be related to the severity of the injuries she suffered in the shooting. Hagelin was said to be paralyzed and to have lost cognitive abilities. Inés Carazzo, a detainee enslaved and regularly raped by Captain Antonio Pernias, another GT332 officer, claims that Acosta ordered that Hagelin be put to death in a &quot;death flight&quot;. Hagelin joined the ranks of the &quot;disappeared&quot; some time in 1977.

There is no direct evidence that Astiz had any part in Hagelin&#x27;s treatment after shooting and kidnapping Hagelin. There is no evidence of who killed her.

Astiz was convicted of murdering Dagmar Hagelin, and committing other crimes, to a second lifetime sentence in 2017 after a five year trial, together with his former boss Jorge Acosta. Dagmar&#x27;s father, Ragnar Hagelin, had passed away the year before the conviction.

In December 1977 Astiz organized the kidnapping of about a dozen people associated with the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, including the founders Azucena Villaflor de Vicenti and two others. The non-violent group of mothers organized to learn the fates of their missing children and protested against the thousands of &quot;disappeared.&quot; He also kidnapped two French nationals who were Catholic nuns, Léonie Duquet and Alice Domon. They had previously been caretakers for Jorge Videla&#x27;s disabled son Alejandro. None were seen alive again after having been tortured at ESMA and &quot;transferred&quot; to be killed.

Astiz was witnessed torturing the nuns at ESMA by beating them, immersing them in water and applying electrified cattle prods to their breasts, genitals and mouths. A staged photograph intended to portray their support of the Montoneros, a Peronist leftist group, was leaked to the press. Despite repeated efforts by France to trace the nuns, the Argentine government denied all knowledge of them.

In late December 1977, unidentified bodies began washing up on beaches hundreds of kilometers south of Buenos Aires after heavy storms. Autopsies revealed they had died on impact, apparently having been thrown out of aircraft over the ocean, intended never to be discovered. In March 1978 Agence France-Presse reported that the bodies were believed to be the two nuns and several members of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, but this was not confirmed by the government. These and other bodies washed ashore were buried in mass graves at General Lavalle Cemetery, about 400 kilometers south of Buenos Aires.

In July 2005 several bodies of unidentified women were found in a mass grave in General Lavalle Cemetery. Forensic DNA testing by the Argentine Forensic Anthropology Team identified the remains of Duquet, Azucena Villaflor de Vicenti, and two other founders of the Mothers of the Plaza in August 2005. Domon&#x27;s remains have not been found.

==Falklands War==
Astiz commanded a special team of fifteen Tactical Divers Group frogmen, dubbed &quot;los lagartos&quot; (the lizards), which carried out the first act of aggression in what developed into the Falklands War. On 19 March 1982 they landed on South Georgia, under the guise of workers of the Argentine scrap metal dealer Constantino Davidoff. Officially they were to scrap three derelict whaling stations at Leith Harbour which had been purchased by their employer in 1979. They dressed up in uniform and raised the Argentine flag in full view of a British Antarctic Survey party.

The next day, 20 March, the local head of the British Antarctic Survey handed Astiz a note transcribed from a radio message from the Governor of the Falklands. The communication ordered Astiz to take down the flag of Argentina and leave. Astiz took down the flag but did not leave. Later that day, , the Royal Navy&#x27;s ice patrol ship, was dispatched from Stanley on the Falklands to Grytviken, the main British Antarctic Survey base on South Georgia, with 22 Royal Marines with orders to evict him. They arrived on 23 March, a week before a number of Argentine Marines landed near Grytviken on 2 April. More Argentine marines arrived over the following days, and there was an armed clash at Grytviken. After damaging an Argentine frigate and shooting down an Aerospatiale Puma helicopter, inflicting casualties in both cases, the Royal Marines surrendered to superior force. The Royal Marines were repatriated to the United Kingdom and later took part in the recapture of the Falkland Islands.

The British Government reacted by sending in more forces to South Georgia, the Argentine garrison surrendering on 23 April 1982. Astiz insisted on signing a surrender document for himself and his small band although they were covered by the surrender of his commanding officer. As a result, Astiz was mistakenly publicized as the commander of the garrison on South Georgia.

Astiz rigged the island football pitch with explosives, and planned to detonate them killing the British officers receiving his surrender. At the last minute the wires leading to the explosives were spotted and the surrender venue was changed to aboard HMS Plymouth, where Astiz freely admitted plotting to kill the British delegation, having also booby trapped nearby buildings. “The white flag obviously meant nothing to him” said British naval Captain Nick Barker who took Astiz’s surrender.

=== Prisoners of war ===
Soon after the British recapture of South Georgia, Nicanor Costa Méndez, the Argentine Foreign Minister, said that Argentina was technically in a state of war with the UK. At about the same time an Argentine prisoner (Félix Artuso) was shot dead by a Royal Marine who mistakenly thought he was trying to scuttle a captured submarine. The United Kingdom Government informed Argentina through Brazilian diplomats that a board of inquiry would be convened under the provisions of the 1949 Geneva Conventions to review the death. The next day the United Kingdom claimed the Argentine prisoners were not prisoners of war because they were captured before Argentina had declared hostilities. Six days later they changed their mind. In a 1983 article, Meyer states that the United Kingdom&#x27;s Government changed its position because it had already implied the Argentine detainees were prisoners of war by applying provisions of the Geneva Conventions.

About three weeks after the Argentine prisoners were captured, the United Kingdom announced that it would repatriate all 151 soldiers and 39 civilians, five of whom were not Argentine citizens, that it held in detention on South Georgia. Because of the publicity related to the surrender of Astiz, he came to the attention of the Swedish and French governments, which has been seeking justice for their citizens from Argentina, their embassies in London informing the Government of the United Kingdom that Astiz was accused of criminal acts against their nationals. As the Argentine prisoners were being shipped to Ascension Island to be handed over to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and flown home, the Swedish Government asked the British Government to question Astiz. The French Government also made a request that Astiz be held while they sought legal pursuance for the &quot;disappearances&quot; of the nuns. Both countries stated that they had eyewitnesses for the &quot;disappearances.&quot; The United Kingdom&#x27;s Government&#x27;s initial response was that concerned parties should talk to the I.C.R.C., as it would be taking custody of the prisoners. The I.C.R.C. refused the countries&#x27; requests to talk to Astiz if it took custody of him. Both nations in response stepped up diplomatic pressure on the United Kingdom not to transfer Astiz to the I.C.R.C. The United Kingdom decided to send home the 189 other detainees &quot;as an act of compassion.&quot; Astiz was to be held until &quot;the end of the belligerency&quot;, initially on Ascension Island.

=== Repatriation ===
Two weeks later, under pressure from public opinion at home and by the French and Swedish governments, the United Kingdom decided to buy time by transporting Astiz by ship from Ascension Island to the United Kingdom. While Astiz was in transit, it announced he would be made available for interview by representatives of the French and Swedish Governments. Soon after, the Argentine government made veiled threats against the welfare of three British journalists they had under arrest as spies at that time in Argentina, and linked their release to that of Astiz. Astiz was questioned twice in June 1982 by a Detective Chief Superintendent of the Sussex Constabulary. Both times, Astiz remained silent. The United Kingdom gave a detailed report of the fruitless interviews to the Swedish and French Governments. Astiz was repatriated back to Argentina on 10 June 1982, just before the start of the battle for Port Stanley and the Argentine surrender on the Falkland Islands on 14 June 1982.

The United Kingdom Government had chosen to read the Third Geneva Convention of 1949, relating to the treatment of prisoners of war, as protecting Astiz from criminal prosecution in its jurisdiction and from extradition from it. Meyer argues that this was an incorrect reading but was justified at the time by four points. Astiz was in protective custody because of special circumstances, i.e. surrendering during war. The Geneva Conventions exhort custodial powers to leniency. Astiz was accused of crimes—kidnapping, wounding and torture—which were illegal in Argentina, and he could, in theory, be prosecuted there. Meyer argues that nothing in the Geneva Conventions expressly prohibited the prosecution or extradition of Astiz. However, the extradition treaties between Argentina and the UK, and Sweden and France, referred only to crimes committed within the territory of the requesting state and crimes against international law, while Astiz was accused of crimes committed in Argentina against their nationals which were not, at the time, crimes under international law. Consequently, he could not be handed over to another country. Criminal prosecution of Astiz within the UK was also not possible because he was not accused of any crimes against British subjects, their possessions or the British State.

Meyer argues that victims of Astiz, or their representatives, might have been successful in securing damages from him if they had brought a civil action while he was in the UK. As with criminal prosecution, nothing in the Geneva Conventions of 1949 remove the civil liability of prisoners of war for actions committed prior to capture. A British court has jurisdiction over a foreign tort whenever the defendant is in the UK, if the alleged act would have been actionable as a tort if committed in Britain, and it was an offence under the laws of the foreign country. Torture and kidnap by government officials is actionable as a tort if committed in England. Proving that it was an offence under the laws of Argentina would have been more difficult.

English courts assume that the authorised actions of officials of a foreign government within its sovereign territory are not actionable within their jurisdiction unless those actions are outside the scope of the powers of the government. Since torture is expressly forbidden in the Argentine constitution, Astiz could have been prosecuted for acting outside his powers as an agent of the Argentine government in torturing Domon and Duquet. Although there were witnesses prepared to testify that they had seen Astiz torture Alice Domon and Léonie Duquet, no prosecution of Astiz was made on these grounds at the time.

British government documents kept secret until released in 2012 under the thirty year rule revealed that Astiz was considered a major problem as a prisoner, that Astiz&#x27;s custody on board ship was a breach of Article 22 of the Third Geneva Convention, (which states that prisoners must be held on land) and that there had been discrimination between Astiz and his men. There were also concerns for the safety of British prisoners held by Argentina. Within a few days of being taken prisoner he had assaulted a guard and later fashioned a &quot;primitive dagger&quot; from a bed spring. The Secretary of State for Defence, John Nott, felt that the only course of action was to &quot;get him off our hands as soon as possible&quot;.

==Legal actions==
On 16 March 1990 Astiz was convicted and sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to life imprisonment by a French Assize Court for his role in the torture and disappearance of the two French nuns, Alice Domon and Léonie Duquet. French law allows trials, &quot;in absentia&quot; if necessary, of foreigners accused of breaking French laws in other jurisdictions if the crimes are committed against French nationals.

For years, Astiz was protected by the Pardon Laws in 1986 and 1987 (the &quot;Ley de Punto Final&quot; and &quot;Ley de Obediencia Debida&quot;, respectively) which had shielded military and security officers from prosecution. He has several times been physically attacked by civilians; a well-known assault took place in Bariloche in the mid-1990s. In 1998 he told the Argentine magazine &quot;Trespuntos&quot; in an interview that he was &quot;the best-trained man in Argentina to kill journalists and politicians&quot;. He also reportedly said &quot;I&#x27;m not sorry for anything&quot;, and defended the actions of the military dictatorship. He was discharged from the military for his comments.

Astiz was arrested by Argentine police in July 2001. The Pardon Laws did not cover child abduction. Italy was seeking extradition of Astiz for the kidnapping and torture of three Italian nationals in 1976 and 1977, and for the abduction of a baby daughter born to one of them: Angela Maria Aieta in 1976, and the kidnapping of Giovanni Pegoraro and his pregnant daughter Susana Pegoraro in 1977. It is believed that Susana gave birth in prison before her death, and Astiz arranged for her baby to be given for illegal adoption to an Argentine military family. Argentine newspapers reported at the time of Astiz&#x27;s arrest that the alleged daughter was living in the port city of Mar del Plata. Astiz was not extradited.

In 2005 the Argentine Supreme Court declared unconstitutional the amnesty laws introduced during the transition to democracy (&quot;Ley de Punto Final&quot;, 1986 and &quot;Ley de Obediencia Debida,&quot; 1987). Since the identification of Duquet&#x27;s body, France has been seeking extradition of Astiz on charges of murdering Duquet.

After this ruling, the government re-opened prosecution of war crimes committed during the military dictatorship. In 2005, Astiz was detained on charges of kidnapping and torture, centered on the 12 victims of December 1977. Astiz and 17 other defendants associated with the operations at ESMA were &quot;charged with various cases of kidnapping, torture, and murder relating to 86 victims&quot;. Following a 22-month trial, on 27 October 2011, Alfredo Astiz was convicted by an Argentinian court and sentenced to life imprisonment for crimes against humanity committed during the Dirty War.

Of the other defendants, 11 were also sentenced to life in prison, four received sentences ranging from 18 to 25 years, and two were acquitted. Since the Kirchner government started prosecuting cases again, Astiz is one of 259 people who by late 2011 had been convicted of human rights abuses committed during the dictatorship.

=== Charges of French intelligence participation ===
Along with Luis María Mendía, former chief of naval operations in 1976–77, Astiz testified in January 2007 before Argentine judges that a French intelligence agent, Bertrand de Perseval, had participated in the abduction of the two French nuns. Perseval, who lives today in Thailand, denied any links with the abduction. He has acknowledged being a former member of the Organisation armée secrète (OAS), an underground group which fought to subvert the French government of Charles de Gaulle, and having escaped to Argentina after the March 1962 Evian Accords, which ended the 1954–62 Algerian War.

It has long been alleged that France arranged to have its intelligence agents train their Argentine (and other Latin American) counterparts in the counter-insurgency techniques they used in the Algerian War, which included interrogation under torture. Referring to Marie Monique Robin&#x27;s 2003 film documentary titled &quot;The Death Squads – the French School&quot; (&quot;Les escadrons de la mort – l&#x27;école française&quot;), which claims this, Mendía asked the Argentine Court to summon to court the former French president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, the former French prime minister Pierre Messmer, the former French ambassador to Buenos Aires Françoise de la Gosse, and all those in office in the French embassy in Buenos Aires between 1976 and 1983. Besides this &quot;French connection&quot;, Mendía has also blamed the former president Isabel Perón and the former ministers Carlos Ruckauf and Antonio Cafiero, who had signed anti-subversion decrees before Videla&#x27;s 1976 &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot;. According to the ESMA survivor Graciela Daleo, this is another tactic to absolve the perpetrators of culpability, as did the 1987 &quot;Obediencia Debida&quot; Act, by trying to shift it to the predecessors of the military government, and the French. Daleo points out that claiming to be obeying Isabel Perón&#x27;s anti-subversion decrees is grotesque, as those who murdered in the name of the decrees were the ones who had deposed her.

==Personal life==
=== Family ===
Born on November 8, 1951, into a traditional Argentine family of Mar del Plata origin, upper-middle class and Spanish Basque descent, his parents were Bernardo Astiz, a vice admiral of the Argentine Navy, and María Elena Vázquez, a housewife from whom Alfredo inherited his blonde phenotype and blue eyes. From his father he inherited his military vocation and penchant for torture and from both parents the Argentine nationalist formation and common sadism that accompanies him to this day as a prisoner, serving a life sentence that has lasted a quarter of a century, the same time he served as a naval officer.

The values that were instilled in Alfredo Astiz by María Elena Vázquez are demonstrated by Miriam Lewin&#x27;s testimony regarding Astiz&#x27;s proclivities during his governance of Navy Petty-Officers School (commonly known as ESMA):

I believe there was an intention by Tigre Acosta and Alfredo Astiz to force and promote the sexual relationships [that is, the rapes of female prisoners] in the Escuela de Mecánica de la Armada and, I don&#x27;t know if they did it consciously or by intuition, they were convinced that by gaining the bodies of the widows of disappeared victims, like the widow of Caride, the widow of Osatinsky, they could win the dirty war, it was sort of like of defeating the Montoneros women.&quot; 

In the late 90s, a woman named Karina Mujica, who held a campaign in favour of Astiz, was revealed to be his girlfriend. In 2006, a media investigation discovered that Mujica was a VIP prostitute in the city of Mar del Plata.

=== Health ===
Astiz was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2004. In October 2013 the Supreme Court ratified decisions of lower courts denying him the right to treatment in a military hospital, under a Defence Ministry resolution banning use of the facilities by personnel who had criminal convictions. Astiz said that the Ministry was trying to kill him and severely harm his health by denying him access to Pedro Mallo Naval Hospital, the only medical facility able to supply the care he needed.

<text>William Henry Blum (; March 6, 1933 – December 9, 2018) was an American author and journalist and a critic of United States foreign policy.

==Early life==
Blum was born at Beth Moses Hospital (now part of Maimonides Medical Center) in Brooklyn, to Ruth (née Katz) and Isidore Blum, who were Polish Jewish immigrants. His father was a machinist. He was a graduate of Erasmus Hall High School and gained a degree in accountancy in 1955 from the City College School of Business and Civic Administration, which later became Baruch College of the City University of New York. Blum worked as a computer programmer for IBM and later the U.S. State Department. He had the ambition of becoming a foreign service officer to, as he explained, &quot;take part in the great anti-Communist crusade&quot; but was later disillusioned by the Vietnam War. Blum became involved in anti–Vietnam War activism and was pressured to resign his government post in 1967. By then he had already taken part in anti-war protests and become a founder and editor of the &quot;Washington Free Press&quot;, an alternative bi-weekly newspaper.

==Journalism==
Blum worked as freelance journalist in the United States, Europe and South America. In 1972–1973, Blum worked as a journalist in Chile where he reported on the Allende government&#x27;s &quot;socialist experiment&quot; before the U.S backed coup and the regime of Augusto Pinochet. In the mid-1970s, he worked in London with ex-CIA officer Philip Agee and his associates &quot;on their project of exposing CIA personnel and their misdeeds&quot;. He supported himself with his writing and speaking engagements on college campuses. One of Blum&#x27;s stories on Iraq was listed by Project Censored as one of &quot;The Top Ten Censored Stories of 1998&quot;

In his books and online columns, Blum devoted substantial attention to CIA interventions and assassination plots. Noam Chomsky has called Blum&#x27;s book &quot;Killing Hope: U.S. Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II&quot;, &quot;far and away the best book on the topic.&quot; Blum supported Ralph Nader&#x27;s presidential campaigns. He circulated a monthly newsletter by email called &quot;The Anti-Empire Report&quot;. Blum described his life&#x27;s mission as: &quot;If not ending, at least slowing down the American Empire. At least injuring the beast. It&#x27;s causing so much suffering around the world.&quot;

In an interview with C-SPAN in 2006, Blum stated: &quot;Speaking about U.S. foreign policy, which is my specialty, the authors I would most recommend would be Michael Parenti and Noam Chomsky and Edward Herman and Howard Zinn and Alexander Cockburn.&quot; According to Blum, left-wing publications such as &quot;The Nation&quot; declined to publish his work because they considered him too much of a fanatic.

===Osama bin Laden statement===
In early 2006, Blum briefly became the subject of widespread media attention when Osama bin Laden issued a public statement in which he quoted Blum and recommended that all Americans read &quot;Rogue State: A Guide to the World&#x27;s Only Superpower&quot;. As a result of the mention, sales of his book greatly increased. &quot;I was quite surprised and even shocked and amused when I found out what he&#x27;d said,&quot; Blum commented. &quot;I was glad. I knew it would help the book&#x27;s sales and I was not bothered by who it was coming from. If he shares with me a deep dislike for certain aspects of US foreign policy, then I&#x27;m not going to spurn any endorsement of the book by him. I think it&#x27;s good that he shares those views and I&#x27;m not turned off by that.&quot; On the Bin Laden endorsement, Blum stated, &quot;This is almost as good as being an Oprah book.&quot; In an interview on MSNBC &quot;Countdown&quot;, he said: &quot;Basically it&#x27;s US foreign policy which creates anti-American terrorists. It&#x27;s the things we do to the world. It&#x27;s not, as the White House tells us, that they hate our freedom and democracy. That&#x27;s just propaganda.&quot;

In a May 22, 2006, article entitled &quot;Come Out of the White House With Your Hands Up&quot;, Blum wrote: &quot;Since the bin Laden recommendation, January 19, I have not been offered a single speaking engagement on any campus. . . . This despite January–May normally being the most active period for me and other campus speakers.&quot;

==Death==
Blum died on December 9, 2018, in Arlington, Virginia, from kidney failure at the age of 85 following a fall in his apartment two months earlier.

<text>&quot;The Man Who Traveled in Elephants&quot; is a short story written in 1948 by Robert A. Heinlein. It was first published as &quot;The Elephant Circuit&quot; in the October 1957 issue of &quot;Saturn Magazine&quot;. It later appeared in two Heinlein anthologies, &quot;The Unpleasant Profession of Jonathan Hoag&quot; (also titled &quot;6xH&quot;; 1959) and &quot;The Fantasies of Robert A. Heinlein&quot; (1999).

Though this story was not typical of the subject matter of most of Heinlein&#x27;s writing, it was Heinlein&#x27;s favorite. It has had a mixed reception compared to his other works. Spider Robinson selected it as one of his life-time favorite stories, and included it in his anthology &quot;Best of All Possible Worlds&quot; on that basis. Alexei Panshin said that the story &quot;...is a mistake, a sloppy, sentimental fantasy that I suspect was written at the very beginning of Heinlein&#x27;s career and then went without a buyer until 1957&quot;.

The story can be viewed as an early manifestation of Heinlein&#x27;s World as Myth, which featured prominently in his last novels.

The protagonist is a widower who once was a traveling salesman working with his wife. The two of them continued to travel after retirement, scouting territory in order to sell elephants. It becomes clear that these travels were not seriously intended to sell elephants, but were rather a way to continue the life the two had previously enjoyed. On their travels the two of them were accompanied by a collection of imaginary animals.

The story is usually described as a fantasy. Even though the tone of the story is realistic it could be considered magic realism.
