<text>The Army Ranger Wing (ARW) (, &quot;SFA&quot;) is the special operations force of the Irish Defence Forces, the military of Ireland. It is a branch of the Irish Army, it also selects personnel from the Naval Service and Air Corps. It serves at the behest of the Defence Forces and Government of Ireland, operating internally and overseas, and reports directly to the Chief of Staff. The ARW was established in 1980 with the primary role of counter terrorism and evolved to both special operations and counter-terrorism roles from 2000 after the end of conflict in Northern Ireland. The unit is based in the Curragh Camp, County Kildare. The 2015 White Paper on Defence announced that the strength of the ARW would be considerably increased due to operational requirements at home and overseas.

The unit has served abroad in a number of international peacekeeping and peace enforcement missions including in Somalia, East Timor, Liberia, Chad, and Mali. The ARW trains with special forces units around the world, particularly in Europe. The ARW in its domestic counter terrorism role trains and deploys with the Garda Síochána (national police) specialist armed intervention unit, the Emergency Response Unit (ERU).

In February 2022, the Commission on the Defence Forces report recommended that the ARW be renamed the Ireland Special Operations Force (IRL-SOF). The IRL-SOF would be placed under a Special Operations Command which would report directly to Joint Force Command. A follow up report released in November 2023, the Detailed Implementation Plan for the Report of the Commission of the Defence Forces, stated that the ARW is due to be renamed the IRL-SOF in 2028. The updated IRL-SOF is proposed to consist of three Task Groups: Land, Air and Maritime. By 2028, the Air and Maritime Task Groups are to be re-located to the Casement Aerodrome and the Haulbowline Naval base.

==Roles==

The Army Ranger Wing roles are divided between wartime special operations (&quot;Green Role&quot;) and anti-terrorism (&quot;Black Role&quot;), the latter known formally as military Aid to the Civil Power (ATCP):

*razzias (raids)
*ambushes
*sabotage
*capture of key personnel
*diversionary operations
*intelligence gathering

Defensive operations

*recapture of terrorist-held objectives 
*VIP security operations/close protection of VIPs
*contingency planning to counter terrorist/subversive threats

==Name and motto==
The unit&#x27;s official name is &quot;Sciathán Fianóglach an Airm&quot; in the Irish language which translates into English as &quot;Army Ranger Wing&quot;. &quot;Fianóglach&quot; (representing &quot;Ranger&quot;) is an amalgamation of two Irish words. &quot;Fiann&quot; is closest to the word &quot;warrior&quot;, and refers to the ancient band of warriors known as &quot;Na Fianna&quot; in Irish mythology. &quot;Óglach&quot; literally means &quot;young soldier&quot;, and is often translated as &#x27;&quot;volunteer&quot;. Use in this context refers to the name of the Defence Forces in Irish: &quot;Óglaigh na hÉireann&quot; (&quot;Irish Volunteers&quot;). &quot;Na Fianna&quot; were purportedly expert warriors, so the addition of the word &quot;Fiann&quot; before &quot;Óglaigh&quot; denotes an elite element to the unit. The shoulder flash insignia of the unit uses &quot;Fianóglach&quot;.

The motto of the Army Ranger Wing is taken from an old Fianna poem, in Irish it is: &quot;Glaine ár gcroí, Neart ár ngéag, Agus beart de réir ár mbriathar&quot;, which translates as: &quot;The purity of our hearts, the strength of our limbs and our commitment to our promise&quot;.

==History==
In the late 1960s, the Defence Forces established &#x27;Special Assault Groups&#x27; (SAG) in the Army to meet security challenges on the border with Northern Ireland. A number of Army officers attended the United States Army Ranger School in Fort Benning, Georgia who returned to conduct Army Ranger courses in Ireland with the first held in 1969. Among its founding officers was later-to-be Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Dermot Earley. Special Assault Groups were formed comprising 40 Rangers trained in all arms, engineering and ordnance techniques. 

By the mid-1970s, the Defence Forces had over 300 Rangers who conducted support operations on the request of the Garda Síochána. Students on these courses were selected from among all ranks and units of the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps. The courses improved standards of physical endurance, marksmanship, individual military skills and small unit tactics. In December 1977, the Garda Síochána formed a counter-terrorist unit named the Special Task Force (STF) to operate in border regions that was later to become the Emergency Response Unit.

Following an assessment of the SAG, and Rangers receiving training from the M-Squadron, an elite counter-terrorism (CT) branch of the Royal Netherlands Marine Corps, in 1978 it was decided to consolidate the Rangers into a new special forces unit with a counter-terrorist capability following an increase in international and national terrorism, such as the 1972 Munich massacre in Germany (then West Germany) and a number of hostage-takings by the Provisional IRA (such as the Balcombe Street siege).

The Army Ranger Wing (ARW) was formally established, in accordance with the Defence Act, by Government order on 16 March 1980. The ARW received its colours in 1981; Black, Red and Gold, signifying Secrecy, Risk and Excellence. In 1991, the ARW was granted permission to wear the Green beret.

In April 2017, it was reported that there had been no increase in the strength of the ARW despite the 2015 White Paper&#x27;s aim to considerably increase the strength of the unit.

On 16 January 2022, there were recommendations made for some ARW operators to be based in Cork to work alongside their colleagues in the Naval Service in improving its maritime anti-terrorism capabilities. In January 2022, the ex-ARW operator turned politician Cathal Berry said that he backed proposals to rename the unit as the &#x27;Ireland Special Operations Force&#x27; (ISOF).

==Structure==
The Officer Commanding the Army Ranger Wing is responsible for the administrative, disciplinary and operational control of the unit, and is in turn directly under the command of the Chief of Staff at Defence Forces Headquarters (DFHQ). Information on the numerical strength of the unit and the identity of its personnel is restricted. Estimates variously put the strength at &quot;well over a hundred&quot; or between 140 and 150 personnel. In 2015, the Defence White Paper announced an increase in strength with reports of the unit doubling in size. The Wing is divided into operational task units each comprising several assault teams relative to each operator&#x27;s area of speciality. After serving one year in an assault team an operator can apply to join a specialist team such as combat diving team, free fall parachuting team and sniping team. An example of an operational task unit is the Special Operations Maritime Task Unit (SOMTU). Support elements provide expertise in bomb disposal, medical treatment, maritime and aviation operations. The Army Ranger Wing is headquartered at the Defence Forces Training Centre (DFTC) in the Curragh Camp, with Army Rangers required to live within a defined radius. Training is carried out nationwide at a number of Department of Defence properties, including Lynch Camp in Kilworth, County Cork.

The ARW is on immediate call 24/7, 365 days a year for operations throughout the state and abroad. The ARW is on 96 hours&#x27; notice to deploy overseas on special operations. The ARW is on a 1-hour alert for anti-terrorist operations to deploy anywhere on land in the Republic of Ireland using Air Corps aircraft and up to 200 miles out to sea via the Naval Service vessels. In the event of a major terrorist, hijacking or hostage incident, the ARW may be called to aid the Garda ERU, and in the past, they have been put on standby to assist the Irish Prison Service during major prison riots. The unit has on occasion been tasked for search and rescue (SAR) operations, as the ARW have trained Arctic survival specialists.

Besides sanctioned international military missions, the unit may be deployed overseas to protect Irish diplomatic missions and diplomats (particularly in times of war or civil unrest in host countries), to provide close protection to members of the Irish government travelling overseas, to rescue kidnapped Irish citizens, to extract citizens in hostile or conflict zones, or to conduct intelligence operations.

The ARW is equipped with SINCGAR ITT, Harris and Racal communications equipment, which have an inbuilt encryption and frequency-hopping systems. It is also equipped with satellite communications, through the ARW C3 (Command, Control &amp; Communications) function and in cooperation with the Communications and Information Services Corps (CIS). This means ARW teams can communicate with their GHQ from anywhere in the world. The Army Ranger Wing Intelligence Section has the ability to remotely intercept electronic and telephonic communications, working with the Directorate of Military Intelligence (J2) and Army CIS Corps.

==Selection and training==

Candidates must be serving members of the Permanent Defence Forces (PDF) from any of the three branches (Army, Air Corps or Naval Service). The candidate must be medically fit and have attained the rank of at least 3 Star Private (or equivalent). There is no age limit to attempt selection. Selection has been open to females since 1984, however, none have been successful. Usually 40 to 80 candidates attempt selection annually.

The ARW recently revised its selection and assessment procedures combining the previous Selection course &amp; Basic Skills course into a new single course named the &quot;Special Operations Force Qualification Course&quot; (SOFQ). The SOFQ is conducted over 10 months (40 weeks). The Selection Course had been conducted over 3 weeks after being reduced in 2006 from 4 weeks. The Basic Skills course had been conducted over 5 months.

The SOFQ is divided into 5 modules:
# Assessment &amp; Evaluation
# Skills &amp; Leadership
# SOF Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures TTPs
# Counter-Terrorism Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures TTPs
# Continuation training

Module 1 assesses a candidate&#x27;s level of physical fitness, motivation and suitability to progress on towards further modules (2-5) of the SOFQ course similar to the previous selection course. Candidates must pass a series of fitness assessments, map reading and individual navigation assessments, claustrophobia, water confidence, and psychometric testing. The final phase of Module 1 includes individual navigation exercises with set weights over unknown distances and completion times which can be over 250 km, culminating in an additional 65 km cross-country march carrying a 65 lb combat load in the Dublin &amp; Wicklow mountain range. On average candidates get between four and five hours sleep per night. Officer and senior NCO candidates are subjected to separate, rigorous scrutiny of their planning and decision-making skills to determine their suitability. The length of Module 1 is 3 weeks similar to the previous selection course length. Typically 85% of candidates fail Module 1. Between 2000 and 2005, approximately 240 attempted selection, including a female, with 50 successful.

Modules 2 to 4 consist of assessment and training in weapons and marksmanship, live-fire tactical training, special operations tactics, techniques, and procedures (green role) and counter-terrorism tactics, techniques, and procedures (black role), combat water survival, Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Extraction (SERE), communications and medical training. Upon successful completion of Module 3, candidates are awarded the &quot;Fianóglach&quot; shoulder tab and are provisionally assigned to the unit. Upon successful completion of Module 4, candidates are awarded the distinctive ARW green beret.

Module 5 Continuation training is the conclusion of the SOFQ course, and candidates are posted to an operational ARW task unit as an assault team operator. 3 Star Privates (and equivalents) who are successful in completing the SOFQ course pass out at the rank of Acting Corporal, and the lowest commissioned rank in the unit is that of Captain. All candidates must successfully complete the basic parachute course of five (5) static line jumps from 3,000 feet using T10 round canopies.

As of 2012, it was reported that since the unit&#x27;s inception fewer than 400 had completed training to become a Ranger.

Further specialist training courses for Rangers include advanced combat medical skills, military freefall, combat diving (taught by the specialist Naval Service Diving Section) and boat handling, close protection and handling of advanced weapons.

Prior to 2000 with The Troubles, approximately 85% of Ranger training had been dedicated to counter-terrorism. The average age of a Ranger is 31 years old with the eldest 44 years old. On average, a member of the ARW spends between 5 and 10 years serving with the unit before being returned to their home unit bringing their skills with them, but it is not uncommon for some to spend 15 years in the unit.

The ARW has its own purpose-built tactical training facilities, including shooting ranges, kill houses and various urban and rural settings. The main facility is known as &quot;Tac Town&quot;, based in the Curragh. Other ranges are located in County Wicklow. These facilities are also made available to the ERU.

The ARW has trained with other military and law enforcement special operations forces, including;
* – Special Air Service Regiment (SASR)
* – Special Forces Group (SFG)
* – Joint Task Force 2 (JTF2) &amp; Canadian Special Operations Regiment (CSOR)
* – GIGN &amp; 1er RPIMa
* – GSG 9 &amp; KSK
* – GIS &amp; COMSUBIN
* – UIM
* – New Zealand Special Air Service (NZSAS)
* – JW GROM
* – SOG &amp; FJS
* – Special Air Service (SAS) 
* – 75th Ranger Regiment, Delta Force, Navy SEALs &amp; Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance

The ARW and ERU train specifically for marauding terrorist firearms/explosive attacks.

In 2015, the Irish Defence Forces signed agreements with their British counterparts to deepen joint special forces peacekeeping co-operation, extending from previous deployments with British special forces in a number of combat zones.

==Notable missions==
Rangers have seen active service in a number of peacekeeping missions around the world with the United Nations, European Union (EU) and Partnership for Peace (PfP) of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (the Republic of Ireland is not a member of NATO, due to its policy of military neutrality). Individual deployments include Lebanon, Bosnia, Cyprus, Iraq and Western Sahara.

===Somalia===
The ARW&#x27;s first deployment overseas was in Somalia in 1993 as part of UNOSOM II where a number of teams joined the United States-led peacekeeping coalition tasked with imposing a ceasefire in the Baidoa region. Over 100 Irish troops took part in the mission.

On one regular return journey, from protecting a food convoy/supply run to Mogadishu, Irish and Indian UN troops were ambushed by insurgents. Following an intense firefight, there were more than 10 enemies killed with no Irish or Indian fatalities reported. Following this, the Irish contingent was supplied with armoured vehicles as they had previously been relying on soft-skinned vehicles mounted with heavy calibre machine guns.

===East Timor===
In October 1999, No 1 IRCON (Irish Contingent), an ARW platoon of 30 Rangers deployed to East Timor as part of the International Force for East Timor (INTERFET) to restore peace and security following the independence referendum in August. The Australian-led mission had begun nearly a month earlier with an allied special forces coalition of Australian Special Air Service, New Zealand Special Air Service and British Special Boat Service (SBS) armed Response Force.

No 1 IRCON was embedded in the reconnaissance company in the 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Regiment (1 RNZIR) Battalion Group together with an infantry company from the Canadian 3rd Battalion, Royal 22 Regiment bringing the battalion to full strength. The Battalion Group based in Suai was responsible for securing the south-west of the country from pro-Indonesia militias and Indonesian soldiers that included a long section of the border between East and Indonesian controlled West Timor.

No 1 IRCON completed a four-month deployment followed by No 2 IRCON. In February 2000, INTERFET handed over command of military operations to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). No 2 IRCON completed its four-month deployment in June 2000 with subsequent rotations from infantry platoons. The Battalion Group had several contacts (firefights) and a number of incidents with threat forces sustaining no casualties.

===Liberia===
The ARW was deployed in Liberia in the aftermath of the Second Liberian Civil War as part of a peacekeeping contingent of more than 400 troops from the Irish Army, in turn, part of the mixed Irish-Swedish Force Reserve Battalion of the United Nations mission in the country, UNMIL (2003). The ARW&#x27;s area of operations (AO) was &quot;all of Liberia&quot;, consisting of 4.7 million people and 111,369 sq km (43,000 sq mi).

One of their most successful missions during this deployment was the rescue of a large group of civilians captured by gunmen from renegade Liberian forces. Acting on intelligence, a team of twenty heavily armed Rangers were dropped via helicopters at the town of &quot;Gbapa&quot;. To avoid casualties among the hostages, the ARW implemented a policy of less-lethal intervention and, after surrounding a 40-foot container holding 35 hostages, rescued the innocent civilians and captured the rebel forces, including their commander. The incident, which resulted in no Irish casualties, drew praise from the international community and boosted the reputation of the ARW worldwide.

Ranger Sergeant Derek Mooney (33) of Dublin, was killed when his vehicle was involved in a motor vehicle accident during a transport convoy.

===Chad and Central African Republic===

In February 2008, a Special Forces Task Group of 58 Rangers deployed to Abéché in Chad as part of the European Union Force Chad/CAR based at Camp Croci. The ARW was an Initial Entry Force together with other EUFOR special forces that conducted special reconnaissance within the Irish assigned south eastern Chad area of operations. 

The ARW was later based at Multi-National Base-South at Goz Beïda known as Camp Ciara in the area of operations providing security during the construction of the base. The ARW conducted vehicle patrols along the Chad / Sudan border in their Ford F-350 Special Reconnaissance Vehicles. The ARW mission ended in June 2008 with the arrival of the 97th Infantry Battalion.

===Mali===
In June 2019, Dáil Éireann approved sending an ARW Task Unit and staff officers to the UN Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) in intelligence and operational roles, on 4-month rotations for two years. The ARW were deployed in response to an upsurge in violence in north-eastern Mali, led by militants affiliated with al-Qaeda. The Irish contingent were primarily tasked with conducting long-range reconnaissance patrols (LRRP) and deployed as part of a German-led ISTAR Task Force, benefiting from the protections and medical support in place for the larger force. 14 ARW operators are reported to be involved per rotation.

MINUSMA is the most dangerous UN peacekeeping mission. As of October 2019, 204 peacekeepers had been killed out of a total of 15,000 deployed uniformed personnel. It is the first overseas operational deployment for the ARW as a unit, in ten years.

In February 2020, three ARW personnel were injured when an IED blast hit the armoured patrol vehicle they were travelling in, 70 km east of Gao. The personnel were airlifted to hospital but after two weeks were reported to be &quot;back to work&quot;.

===Overseas extraction operations===
In October 2005, Rangers and Arabic-speaking intelligence officers from Military Intelligence (J2) were deployed to Baghdad, Iraq, following the abduction of Irish journalist Rory Carroll by al-Qaeda-affiliated militants. Following negotiations with Irish, British and American government representatives, Rory Carroll was released unharmed days later and returned safely to Ireland.

In 2009, the ARW were involved in the evacuation of GOAL aid worker Sharon Commins who was kidnapped by Janjaweed in Darfur, Sudan for more than 100 days before being released, although the government denied the involvement of the ARW at the time.

With the fall of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 and the Libyan Civil War, the ARW, Air Corps and other Defence Forces assets were deployed in order to evacuate upwards of 115 Irish citizens from the country, mainly via the capital Tripoli. The ARW operated out of the British diplomatic mission in Malta. It was reported at the time that Irish officials printed fake boarding passes in order to bypass &quot;tight&quot; security at Tripoli airport, where authorities refused to allow a large number of aircraft to land or take off. Three Irish aircraft were involved in the operation.

In October 2019 it was reported that the ARW were deployed to the Syrian border to extract Lisa Smith - a former Irish Army soldier who converted to Islam before fleeing Ireland to join ISIS - and her two-year-old child in a Non-Combatant Evacuation Operation (NEO) after the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria resulted in Kurdish-held ISIS prisoners escaping, including Smith, although the Defence Forces or Irish government did not confirm this. ARW personnel were in plainclothes and &quot;discreetly armed&quot; for protection purposes. Smith was repatriated to Dublin Airport where she was arrested by Gardai and charged with terrorism offences.

On 23 August 2021 in the aftermath of the Fall of Kabul to the Taliban, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Defence Simon Coveney approved the deployment of an Emergency Consular Assistance Team (ECAT) comprising ARW personnel and a small team of DFA diplomats to Hamid Karzai International Airport in Kabul in order to evacuate Irish citizens. The options available to the Irish government to extract its citizens were hampered by Ireland&#x27;s lack of an organic strategic airlift capability. The mission ended on 26 August, just 48 hours after the team touched down in Kabul and resulted in the evacuation of 26 Irish citizens. It was reported the last members of the ECAT team left minutes after a deadly suicide bombing at Kabul airport.

In April 2023, a team of up to 12 ARW were deployed to Sudan as part of the evacuation of foreign nationals during the 2023 Sudan conflict. ARW and DFA personnel travelled to Sudan via Djibouti to link up with and extract Irish citizens. The ARW provided medical &amp; security support, secure communications and an intervention element.

===Other overseas missions===
During the War in Afghanistan, ARW personnel served in small numbers with ISAF and RSM from October 2006 to March 2007 and from September 2014 to March 2015, mainly as trainers, medical staff and IED experts.

From 2006 to 2014, it has been reported that operatives from the ARW, including from the Intelligence Section and Military Intelligence Directorate, had been on the ground in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Sudan, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Kosovo and Bosnia-Herzegovina as part of various international missions.

In 2012, it was reported that the ARW could deploy 30 Rangers in the Gulf of Aden, subject to Government, Dáil and UN approval (&quot;triple-lock&quot;), to protect international shipping lanes against Somali pirates as part of the EU&#x27;s Operation Atalanta.

As of 2014, Rangers were serving missions on three continents, including training foreign forces in Africa and the Balkans, protection duties in Lebanon for the United Nations mission and security and intelligence operations on the Israeli-Syrian border (Golan Heights).

In late 2015, Private John O&#x27;Mahony (Ret.) gave evidence as a witness in a military trial in Beirut, Lebanon against Mahmoud Bazzi, a former Lebanese militia fighter accused of murdering Private Thomas Barrett and Private Derek Smallhorne of the Irish Army in April 1980 in Southern Lebanon (see At Tiri Incident). O&#x27;Mahony was accompanied during his entire time in Lebanon by a Close Protection Team from the Army Ranger Wing.

The ARW was chosen to spearhead the special operations task group (SOTG) for the EU Battlegroup rapid reaction force based in Germany, deploying in late 2019. It was the fourth time the Irish Defence Forces served in the Battlegroup, but the first time the ARW have as a unit. The wider force comprises 1,500 troops from EU member states. The ARW trained with the battlegroup for six months after which they remained on standby with it for 18 months. This overlapped with the unit&#x27;s rotations to MINUSMA in Mali.

===Reported domestic missions===

In December 1983 the ARW was involved in an operation against a Provisional IRA &quot;unit&quot; on the loose in woodland in the South of County Leitrim that had been holding hostage for ransom a kidnapped businessman, the ARW having been sent in by the Government after the P-IRA had murdered a Garda officer and an Irish Army soldier that had found their hideout.

In the early 1990s the ARW took part in operations in support of the Garda Emergency Response Unit against the Provisional IRA.

In January 1997, two teams of 12 from the ARW were sent to Mountjoy Prison in central Dublin where three prisoners armed with knives had taken two prison officers hostage and barricaded themselves inside the Medical Unit where they were threatening to kill the prison officers. The ARW took up positions ready to blow down the steel door to the unit and eliminate the threat posed by the hostage-takers. The siege ended within a few hours of the ARW being called in after the hostage-takers were made aware of their presence during negotiations and surrendered.

In May 2011, the unit had a major role in protecting Queen Elizabeth II on her state visit to Ireland, where &quot;viable&quot; assassination attempts by dissident republican terrorists were prevented. The ARW had airborne sniper teams in three AgustaWestland AW139 helicopters, counter assault teams in the motorcade and a number of ground teams, including 20 close protection officers.

Also in May 2011, President of the United States Barack Obama received protection from the ARW on his visit to Ireland just days after the visit of the Queen. The two visits were the largest civil security operations ever undertaken in the Republic of Ireland, both ultimately successful.

From January to July 2013, the wing formed part of the security apparatus for the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, held by Ireland for six months, which included supplying sniper and spotter teams. Also in June 2013, they helped secure the Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border on land and at sea as part of the security operation for the 39th G8 summit in Northern Ireland.

In the early morning of 26 September 2023, an ARW Maritime Task Unit was involved in the storming of MV &quot;Matthew&quot;, a Panamanian-registered bulk cargo vessel, off the coast of Cork in what was described as an &quot;opposed boarding operation&quot;. The ship had crossed the Atlantic from Venezuela; approximately 2,200 kilograms of cocaine with an estimated street value of €157 million were found hidden on board the next day, in the largest seizure of illegal narcotics in Irish history. The ship, which had been monitored after entering Irish territorial waters, reportedly refused orders to halt for inspection and headed for international waters when warning shots were fired by the . This was followed by ARW maritime operators fast roping onto the vessel from an Irish Air Corps helicopter. After the ship was secured, it was escorted into Cork Harbour for further investigation. The 25 crew members detained for interview, with nine people arrested (of whom one was released) .

==Casualties==

Three Rangers are known to have died while serving in the unit since its foundation in 1980, one of them overseas. Sergeant Derek Mooney, aged 33, of Blackrock, Dublin, died after the Land Rover Defender he was driving in a convoy overturned due to poor road conditions, 40 km south of Monrovia, Liberia on 27 November 2003. Sgt Kevin Mayne (1987) and RQMS Patsy Quirke (1998) also lost their lives while serving in the unit, however no details regarding the cause of their deaths are publicly available. No other losses have been publicly disclosed.

In Paul O&#x27;Brien and Wayne Fitzgerald&#x27;s book &quot;Shadow Warriors&quot;, it states &quot;four operatives losing their lives while on active service&quot; with the ARW, however, their names and details are omitted at the request of the Irish Defence Forces. They are remembered on a memorial located within the ARW compound at the Curragh Camp.

<doc id="905356" wikidata="Q4826682" url="?curid=905356" title="Automobile accessory power">
<text>Automobile accessory power can be transferred by several different means. However, it is always ultimately derived from the automobile&#x27;s internal combustion engine, battery, or other &quot;prime mover&quot; source of energy. The advent of high-powered batteries in hybrid and all-electrical vehicles is shifting the balance of technologies even further in the direction of electrically powered accessories.

An engine has one or more devices for converting energy it produces into a usable form, electricity connection through the alternator, hydraulic connections from a pump or engine system, compressed air, and engine vacuum; or the engine may be directly tapped through a mechanical connection. Modern vehicles run most accessories on electrical power. Typically, only 2% of a vehicle&#x27;s total power output has gone towards powering accessories. Electrical and hybrid vehicles may use a larger proportion of energy for accessories, due to reduced inefficiencies in the drive train, especially the elimination of engine idling.

==Mechanical==

Some automobile accessories are connected directly to the engine through gears or belts. These usually require large amounts of power. The air conditioning compressor has been a familiar example, though new all-electric refrigerant compressors are starting to be used in production vehicles.

==Electrical==
Early automobiles used a magneto for ignition, which provided no accessory power. 

The first electrical accessory connection was supplied by a DC generator. Voltage varied with engine speed and because of technological limitations, complicated mechanical devices were used to regulate it. Even so, voltage at idle was too low to be useful. A lead-acid battery was used to provide proper voltage when the generator could not, and was recharged at higher engine speed or lower electrical load. The automobile self starter was an early engine system to use this.

Lighting, which had previously been provided by kerosene lamps or gas lamps, was one of the first common electrical accessories. 

Early systems used 6 volts, but 12 volts became the standard because it provided greater power with less current. The original DC generator was replaced by an alternator controlled by a voltage regulator. Due to mechanical and electrical properties, it is more efficient to first produce alternating current and then immediately convert it to direct current. By regulating the current sent to the alternator&#x27;s rotor and thus the strength of the magnetic field, a stable voltage can be produced over a wider range of engine speeds. 

Starting, lighting and ignition systems of most gasoline-powered vehicles remain as 12 volt systems. Diesel-powered vehicles, including mobile construction equipment and heavy trucks use 24 volt electrical systems, as do many military vehicles. Research is ongoing into adopting a 42-volt electrical system standard for automotive electricity, but the entire electrical system will have to be redesigned and new components manufactured to work with the higher voltage. The main advantage of higher voltage is that electrical components can be made with less metal, saving weight and cost, and improving energy efficiency. As such an 48-volt electrical system has been introduced.

Most modern systems, such as power windows, power seats, and power door locks, are electrically powered. Electrically driven power steering systems have been developed and are used in numerous models. High-efficiency all-electric refrigerant compressors for air conditioning are starting to be used, especially in hybrid or all-electric vehicles.

The cigarette lighter receptacle serves as a de facto standard for use of portable 12 volt equipment in or near an automobile, it is sometimes used with car charger to power devices with batteries. Anderson plug for high amperage.

==Hydraulic==
The engine generally has a hydraulic pump mechanically driven by the engine, but there may also be electrically driven pumps. 

In passenger cars, the most common use of hydraulic power has been the steering system. Convertible tops may be raised and lowered using hydraulics. Windshield wipers were sometimes hydraulically driven, although this use mostly ceased after the late 1960s. On vehicles with little or no engine vacuum, hydraulic systems are generally adopted in place of vacuum systems. 

The French company Citroën devised a high-pressure hydraulics system for cars which was used for all manner of systems, even power-adjustable seats.

The 1999–2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee had a hydraulically driven radiator fan, powered by the SUV&#x27;s power steering pump.

In vehicles such as heavy trucks and tractors, hydraulic systems are much more common. Hydraulic rams are used for accessories such as dump truck beds, cranes, loaders, and three-point hitches.

==Vacuum==
A commonly available source of power from an internal combustion engine is the partial vacuum available at the intake manifold. The piston engine is fundamentally an air pump, and it produces suction and partial manifold vacuum. 

Manifold vacuum varies depending on engine load and throttle position, and automobiles use vacuum reservoirs or &quot;vacuum canisters&quot; to provide a usable source under varying conditions. Turbo charged and super charged engines do not always produce vacuum; the intake manifold is actually pressurized when the turbo is spinning above a certain speed.

Reservoirs and devices connected to the engine through check valves allow pressure to reduce when the engine is generating a lot of vacuum, but do not allow air back in. Vacuum canisters only allow vacuum accessories to be operated for a very short time, and air will leak in after the engine turns off.

The most ubiquitous vacuum-powered accessory is the booster for the power brake system. The vacuum is only an assist and the brakes can still function, requiring greater force, if the booster vacuum is used up.

Many older vehicles used vacuum-powered windshield wipers. Loss of manifold vacuum when the engine was working hard, or at wide open throttle, necessitated using a vacuum booster pump which was usually part of the fuel pump.

Automotive vacuum systems reached their height of use between the 1960s and 1980s. During this time a huge variety of vacuum switches, delay valves and accessory devices were created.

As an example, a 1967 Ford Thunderbird used vacuum for:
* Power brakes
* Transmission shift control
* Doors for the hidden headlamps
* Remote trunk latch release
* Rear cabin vent control
* Power door locks
* Ventilation air routing
* Control of the heater core valve
* Tilt-away steering wheel release

Such systems tend to be unreliable with age as the vacuum tubing becomes brittle and susceptible to leaks.

==Pneumatic==

Pneumatic (compressed air) systems are rarely found in passenger cars.
Larger vehicles often use air brakes and the pressure may be used to drive other systems. Windshield wipers, automatic gear boxes, and other common hydraulic or vacuum powered accessories are often adapted. On buses where the engine is often at the rear of the vehicle, compressed air may be used for the throttle and clutch. 

Bus doors are typically air powered, as well as the steps and the suspension, allowing the bus to lower itself or &quot;kneel&quot; at stops to allow passengers on or off.

Central tire inflation system, differential lock, air suspension and to power pneumatic tools.

<text>Krk (; ; ; ; archaic German: &quot;Vegl&quot;, ; ) is a Croatian island in the northern Adriatic Sea, located near Rijeka in the Bay of Kvarner and part of Primorje-Gorski Kotar county. Krk is tied with Cres as the largest Adriatic island, depending on the methodology used to measure the coastline. Krk is the most populous island in the Adriatic, with multiple towns and villages that contain a total of 19,916 (2021) inhabitants.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===

Archaeological findings indicate that the island was inhabited continuously since the Neolithic period, although very little information about the earliest people is known. In later periods, Greek and Latin sources refer to { (Ancient Greek) or (Latin) as one of the Apsyrtidian or Electridian islands held by the people known as Liburnians. The Liburnians called the island &quot;Curicum&quot;, which is the name assumed to have been given to the island by its original inhabitants.

There are the remains of prehistoric settlements near Draga Bašćanska, as well as Bronze and Iron Age earthworks near Malinska, Dobrinj, Vrbnik and Baška. 
=== Roman era ===
Krk came under Roman rule once they defeated the Liburnians. The town of Krk (Curicum) became a town with Italic law whose status evolved to give it the rights of a municipality. Nothing is known about the internal organizations of the town of Krk during this time. Near the present-day Franciscan monastery, the remains of thermal baths have been found. The defensive walls of Roman Curicum were among the most secure of all the towns on the Eastern Adriatic fortified by the Romans. Work began on their construction during the Civil War in Rome (50 BCE) and they were further strengthened in the 160s CE, to enable them to withstand attacks by the Quadi and Marcomanni who were at that time threatening the Adriatic. Not far from Krk in 49 BCE there was a decisive sea battle between Caesar and Pompey, which was described impressively by the Roman writer Lucan (39–65 CE) in his work &quot;Pharsalia&quot;. When the Empire was divided, Krk came under the Eastern Roman Empire.

Municipium Flavium Fulfinum is an old Roman settlement near the town of Omišalj. Archaeological findings show the first traces of settlement in the area dating back into the 1st century when the Romans settled the area following the Illyrian Wars as a retirement community for soldiers. The Romans constructed the city for the retired Roman soldiers during the Flavian dynasty. The settlement was abandoned in the Late antiquity.

Roman ruins can be seen today in some parts of the town of Krk, for example mosaics in some houses. A temple to the Roman goddess Venus was discovered near the small gate (mala vrata) in the old city. This is the only temple dedicated to the goddess Venus to be found on the eastern side of the Adriatic and it dates back to 1st century BC. It&#x27;s unique in that approval from the emperor’s family itself was needed before building could commence for such a statue to be built. The temple is located within a shop just inside of the small gate.

=== Migration Period ===
The walls of the town of Krk could not withstand attacks by the Avars (7th century), but in contrast to Salona, Scardona and Aeona, life in Krk quickly returned to normal, and Krk functioned as one of the Dalmatian city-states. The Croats penetrated into the town on several occasions. They retained many of the Roman names they found there and so it is said that Krk has a &quot;mosaic dialect&quot;. Following the Treaty of Aachen (812) the entire island was ceded to the Byzantine Empire and was governed according to the norms of that Empire. During the reign of Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus (10th century), Krk was known as &quot;Vekla&quot;, of which the Romanized variant, also used by the Venetians, was &quot;Veglia&quot;.

=== Reign of Croatian Counts and Kings ===
There are no extant documents showing when Krk became part of the Croatian state. It is known that from around 875 the Byzantine town paid the Croatian rulers 110 gold pieces a year to be able peacefully to keep their hold there. While the Croatian state was being established, Krk found itself on the Venetians&#x27; route to the Mediterranean. The Venetians conquered the town for the first time in 1001, and from then Krk&#x27;s history was closely linked with the history of the Republic of Venice for seven centuries. During the reign of Peter Krešimir IV the Croatian rulers regained their power, but the Venetians took Krk for the second time in 1118.

=== Reign of the Krk Counts (from 1430 on – the Frankopan family) ===

When the Venetians conquered Krk for the second time in 1118, the local noble family, the unknown Dujams, received Krk as part of a pact with Venice, and they became Counts. When Dujam died in 1163, Venice allowed his sons to make their position hereditary, after a payment of 350 Byzantine gold pieces as tax. In a short time the Krk Counts became so powerful, that at one time from 1244 to 1260, Venice rescinded their authority. This failed to impede their rise, however. They increased economic exploitation, but they also endeavoured to strengthen old traditions and rights with various statutes (the Vinodol Code 1288 and the Vrbnik Statute, 1388). Dujam&#x27;s youngest son, who died in 1209, succeeded in extending his authority to the mainland, began to serve the Croatian-Hungarian King and received the district of Modruš. Due to his economic strength and social standing, his opponents fought each other for his favour. The Counts became so strong that no power could threaten them (until the Turks). Members of his family were leaders in Split, Trogir and Senj, and from 1392 one of them (Ivan V), became a Croatian-Dalmatian Ban. In 1430 they took the surname Frankopan (Frangipane), claiming to have Roman origins. That year they adopted a coat of arms showing two lions breaking a piece of bread (Latin: frangere panem, break bread). From 1449, the descendants of Nikola IV founded eight branches of his family, and together with the Zrinski Counts were the ruling feudal family in the whole of Croatia right up to 1671. The Frankopans produced seven Croatian Bans, and many of them were patrons of Croatian artists.

Ivan VII Frankopan in particular was the only prince of the semi-independent Principality of Krk. He also promoted the settlement of Morlachs and Vlachs (originally Romanians who later split into Istro-Romanians) in the island (specifically in the areas of Dubašnica and Poljica and between the castles of Dobrinj and Omišalj) to have a bigger manpower. Thus, these Istro-Romanians would form a community in Krk that would influence the local Croatian dialect and leave several toponyms on the island. The Istro-Romanians of Krk disappeared in 1875 after the death of the last speaker of the local Istro-Romanian dialect, which some Croatian scholars named &quot;Krko-Romanian&quot;. Nowadays, this ethnic group only inhabits Istria.

=== Venetian Rule (1480–1797) ===
The island of Krk was a final Adriatic island to become part of the Venetian Empire. Due to its location, proximity to the Uskoks of Senj, it served as a lookout point, as well as first line of defence against the Uskoks. From that time on, the ruler was a Venetian noble, but the Small and the Large Councils both held a certain autonomy. The city laws were written in Latin and, after 1500, in Italian. Italian was also used for the church registers for births, marriages and deaths; other public documents were written in a Glagolitic script, which was widespread here more than anywhere else. At the beginning of 16th century the inhabitants of inland Croatia began to settle on Krk, as a result of their flight from the Ottoman invasions. Nonetheless, Krk still saw a decline, just like all the other Venetian lands. In year 1527 the town was recorded to have 10,461 inhabitants, while in 1527 it had 8,000.

=== Austrian Rule ===

Austrian rule over the island came after the fall of Venice in 1797 and was briefly (1806–1813) interrupted by the existence of Napoleon&#x27;s Illyrian Provinces. In 1822 the Austrians separated the island from Dalmatia and linked it to Istria, therefore bringing the islands of Krk, Cres and Lošinj under direct rule from Vienna. This switch contributed to the appearance of Croatian National Revival, so along with nearby coastal town Kastav, the town of Krk played a major role in spreading of Croatian education and culture in the area.

=== 20th century ===
The Italian Occupation (1918–1920) was brief, and Krk was handed over to Croatia, then in Yugoslavia, by the Treaty of Rapallo, Italy took Krk again in the Second World War (1941–1943), and German occupation followed from 1943 to 1945. The post-war development of Krk was led by tourism. The building of an airport and then a bridge over to the mainland ensures the future of the development of tourism on this island. In Omišalj there has also been industrial development.

The bridge is at the north end of Krk island and uses the small island of Otočić Sveti Marko (St. Mark&#x27;s Islet) as a mid-support. The bridge was completed and opened in July 1980 and originally named Tito&#x27;s Bridge () in honor of Yugoslav president Josip Broz Tito, who had died two months earlier. The bridge has since been renamed Krk Bridge or .

===Ship Building===

The island has a long history of shipbuilding, dating to the Liburnians. Nearby close to the harbor of Mala Luka, remains of a Liburnian-era shipyard have been found.

The name of the municipality of Dubašnica is derived from &quot;Dub&quot;, an old Slavic word for oak. Oak forests made the island attractive for ship builders, dating to Liburnian times.

Malinska harbor was used as a port due to its protection from bura wind as well as its depth. 

The harbor of Vrbnik was used for shipbuilding in the 13th century.

== Economics and infrastructure ==

Krk is located rather near the mainland and has been connected to it via a two-arch concrete bridge since 1980, one of the longest concrete bridges in the world. Prior to construction of the bridge, a ferry carried passengers and vehicles from Črišnjevo on the mainland to a port located in the cove of Voz on Krk.

Due to the proximity to the city of Rijeka, Omišalj also hosts the Rijeka International Airport as well as an oil terminal representing a part of the Port of Rijeka and a petrochemical plant.

Since January 2021,there is an active Krk LNG terminal storage and regasification ship moored in Omišalj, north of Krk, able to receive large LNG carrier ships and then to pump the gas into trans-European pipelines.

Krk is a popular tourist destination, due to its proximity to Slovenia, southern Germany, Austria, and northern Italy. Since the collapse of the Eastern Bloc, many tourists have appeared from Slovakia, Hungary, Romania, and other former Eastern Bloc countries.

== Geography ==

Krk is like many Croatian islands, it is rocky and hilly. The rock is mostly karst. The southeast portion of the island is mostly bare as a result of the bora winds.

Some prominent features include:
* Obzova, the highest point at 568 msl
* Vela Luka a harbor on the southeastern end of the island

===Important Bird Area===
The island forms part of the Kvarner Islands Important Bird Area (IBA), designated as such by BirdLife International because it supports significant numbers of many bird species, including breeding populations of several birds of prey.

A Eurasian griffon vulture colony lives in protected in an area called Kuntrep on Krk. There they breed at low elevations, with some nests at 10 m (33 ft). Therefore, contact with people is common.

== Culture and religion ==
Krk has historically been a center of Croatian culture. Various literature in the Glagolitic alphabet was created and in part preserved on Krk (notably the Baška tablet, one of the oldest preserved texts in Croatian). A monastery lies on the small island of Košljun in a bay off the coast of Krk.

Krk belonged to the Republic of Venice during much of the Middle Ages until its dissolution, when its destinies followed those of Dalmatia. It became part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later called Yugoslavia) after World War I, in 1920. After that date, the village of Veglia/Krk remained the only predominantly Italian-speaking municipality in Yugoslavia. After World War II, most of the Italians left.

The island of Krk is a participant in the 2020 European Capital of Culture project. Through the program &quot;27 neighborhoods&quot;, the city of Krk, Malinska and Vrbnik will be involved in different events during the entire year. Along with them, the Municipality of Baška participated in the program &quot;Lungomare Art&quot;, based on which a permanent art installation &quot;Drops&quot; was set up, which puts emphasis on traditional drywall architecture.

== Monuments and sights ==
* The Baška tablet in Jurandvor that was made in 1100
* Church of St. Lucy in Jurandvor, where the famous Baška tablet was found
* Art installation &quot;Drops&quot; on the hill above Baška
* Krk Cathedral that is dedicated to the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary
* Krk Bridge which connects the island of Krk with the mainland since July 19, 1980

== Language ==
Krk is well known for its historical language diversity. The Middle Chakavian dialect of Croatian is the primary dialect used on the island. Five languages used to be spoken on the island: Venetian, Italian, Croatian, Dalmatian and Istro-Romanian, although the latter two have gone extinct in the island (and everywhere else in the case of Dalmatian). The Croatian dialect of Krk has Istro-Romanian influence.

===Genetics===
The frequency of Haplogroup I, rare elsewhere in Croatia and most of Europe, is high among the population. This characteristic is also found within Rusyns who are from southern Poland, Slovakia, and Ukraine.
===Popular culture===
The fictional island Everon from the video game &quot;Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis&quot; is based on Krk.

<text>William Anthony Maragh (born 25 June 1963), also known as Super Cat, is a Jamaican deejay who achieved widespread popularity during the late 1980s and early 1990s dancehall movement. His nickname, &quot;Wild Apache&quot;, was given to him by his mentor Early B. Super Cat is considered one of the greatest deejays in the history of the Jamaican dancehall scene.

==Biography==
Born to an Afro-Jamaican mother and Indo-Jamaican father, Super Cat was raised in Kingston&#x27;s tough Seivright Gardens neighbourhood, then known as Cockburn Pen, home to ground-breaking deejays like Prince Jazzbo and U-Roy. At the age of seven the Soul Imperial sound system allowed him to assist them at a local club called Bamboo Lawn. He auditioned for Joe Gibbs as a singer but was unsuccessful.

He began appearing as a deejay under the name Cat-A-Rock, but soon switched to the name Super Cat. He also appeared as &#x27;Wild Apache&#x27;. His first single &quot;Mr. Walker&quot;, produced by Winston Riley, was released in 1981 and established his recording career. He went on to record for Jah Thomas (&quot;Walk-a-ton,&quot; on which he was billed as &#x27;Super Cat the Indian&#x27;), but his career was interrupted by a period of incarceration. After his release he began working with Early B on the Killamanjaro sound system in 1984, and his debut album, &quot;Si Boops Deh!&quot;, was released in 1985, and included the hit singles &quot;Boops&quot; (which was based on Steely &amp; Clevie&#x27;s updated &quot;Feel Like Jumping&quot; rhythm and sparked a craze for songs about sugar daddies), and &quot;Cry Fi De Youth&quot;, establishing his style of dancehall with conscious lyrics.

He started his own Wild Apache Productions label and began producing his recordings, including the 1988 album &quot;Sweets for My Sweet&quot;. He featured on the album &quot;Cabin Stabbin&quot;&#x27; in 1991 along with Nicodemus and Junior Demus. He had been scheduled to perform at the One Love concert in the UK in 1991, but his appearance was cancelled after the shooting death of Nitty Gritty, for which Super Cat was initially suspected but cleared in 1992. Continuing success saw him move to the United States and sign a contract with Columbia Records, releasing one of the first dancehall albums on a major label, &quot;Don Dada&quot; (1992). The following year, Sony Music issued &quot;The Good, the Bad, the Ugly, and the Crazy&quot;, teaming Super Cat with Nicodemus, Junior Demus and Junior Cat.

Super Cat had a number of hit singles in the early 1990s, including &quot;Don Dada&quot;, &quot;Ghetto Red Hot&quot; and &quot;Dem No Worry We&quot; with Heavy D. In 1992, he was featured on the remix of &quot;Jump&quot; with Kris Kross, and he also collaborated with them in 1993 for their song &quot;Alright&quot;. These hits made him &quot;The Source magazine&quot; dance hall artist of the year in 1993. He was also an early collaborator with The Notorious B.I.G., featuring the then relatively unknown artist (along with Mary J. Blige, 3rd Eye and Puff Daddy) on the B-side remix of &quot;Dolly My Baby&quot; in 1993. The title song, &quot;Don Dada&quot; was a reply to many jabs made by Ninjaman.

His version of Fats Domino&#x27;s &quot;My Girl Josephine&quot;, performed with Jack Radics, was included in the soundtrack to the film &quot;Prêt-à-Porter&quot; in 1994. In 1997, he was featured on the hit single &quot;Fly&quot; by Sugar Ray from their album &quot;Floored,&quot; which reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Airplay chart and remained there for four weeks. He collaborated with India.Arie on her hit song &quot;Video&quot; in 2001, and with Jadakiss and The Neptunes on &quot;The Don of Dons&quot; in 2003. Later in 2003, he collaborated with 112 for their song &quot;Na Na Na Na.&quot; Following the death of his longtime road manager Fred &#x27;The Thunder&#x27; Donner in 2004, Super Cat released a multi-cd tribute album entitled &quot;Reggaematic Diamond All-Stars&quot; that featured contributions from Yami Bolo, Michael Prophet, Linval Thompson, Nadine Sutherland and Sizzla among others.

Super Cat reappeared on the national reggae scene in 2009 for a show at Madison Square Garden with Buju Banton and Barrington Levy. He also headlined the &#x27;Best of the Best&#x27; concert in Miami in 2008, with Etana, Barrington Levy, Buju Banton, Junior Reid, Tony Matterhorn, Sizzla and Beenie Man. In 2012, his song &quot;Dance Inna New York&quot; was sampled for the Nas single &quot;The Don,&quot; from the rapper&#x27;s album &quot;Life Is Good&quot;, with Cat&#x27;s vocals used as the hook. Super Cat made a surprise appearance at Massive B&#x27;s on Da Reggae Tip concert in September 2013 during the set of Shaggy. That same week, a mix of his work previously recorded during his time with The Neptunes label was released to the internet. 

In May 2014 he headlined the Reggae on the Bay festival in Trinidad with Maxi Priest and Midnite, and in 2016 he joined Beenie Man, Bounty Killer, Tarrus Riley and Luciano for the &quot;Reggae Sumfest&quot; in Jamaica. Super Cat teamed up with noted producer Salaam Remi again in 2020, releasing the single &quot;Push Time,&quot; along with a music video shot in Queens, and later featured on Remi&#x27;s album &quot;Black on Purpose&quot;. In 2021, Super Cat appeared at the VERZUZ Iconz concert in Brooklyn at the Barclay&#x27;s Center dubbed the &quot;Trillerverz,&quot; as part of a two day event that featured Wyclef Jean, Konshens, Baby Cham, and Barrington Levy on day one and Big Daddy Kane and KRS-One on day two. Super Cat co-headlined the &quot;Reggae Love Fest&quot; at Radio City Music Hall with Shabba Ranks in May of 2022, which also featured Barrington Levy, Junior Reid, Cutty Ranks, and Dawn Penn.

Super Cat is the elder brother of reggae artist Junior Cat and first cousin of reggae singer Marcia Griffiths, who&#x27;s 1967 hit “Feel Like Jumping,” was part of the rhythmic basis for his first massive hit single &quot;Boops,&quot; which later became known as the &quot;Boops&quot; riddim.

<doc id="905385" wikidata="Q517978" url="?curid=905385" title="Getting Better">
<text>&quot;Getting Better&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1967 album &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. It was written mainly by Paul McCartney, with some of the lyrics written by John Lennon, and credited to the Lennon–McCartney partnership.

==Composition==
The song has been said to be musically reminiscent of the Beatles&#x27; hit single &quot;Penny Lane&quot;. It moves forward by way of regular chords, produced by Lennon and George Harrison&#x27;s electric guitar. George Martin plays Pianet and piano, on the latter bypassing the keyboard and directly striking the strings. These heavily accented and repetitive lines cause the song to sound as if it is based on a drone. Harrison added an Indian tambura part to the final verse, which further accentuates this impact. The sound of the percussion introduced in this section combines with the tambura to create an Indian mood.

McCartney&#x27;s bassline, in counterpoint to this droning, was described by music critic Ian MacDonald as &quot;dreamy&quot; and &quot;well thought out as a part of the production by McCartney&quot;. It was recorded after the main track was completed, as were many of the bass lines on &quot;Sgt Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. Starting out in the verse with a pedal on the root note (G) that leaps two octaves, McCartney moves to a marching quarter-note (walking) bass line for the first (and only the first) chorus. In stark contrast, all subsequent choruses are played using a fluid, swing feel, full of anticipated notes that propel the song forward despite the quarter-note droning of the guitar and keyboard.

According to Beatles biographer Hunter Davies and MacDonald, the initial idea for the song&#x27;s title came from a phrase often spoken by Jimmie Nicol, the group&#x27;s stand-in drummer for the Australian leg of their 1964 world tour. The title and music suggest optimism, but some of the song&#x27;s lyrics have a more negative tone. In this sense, it reflects the contrasting personas of the two songwriters. In response to McCartney&#x27;s line, &quot;It&#x27;s getting better all the time&quot;, Lennon replies, &quot;Can&#x27;t get no worse!&quot; In a December 1983 interview, McCartney praised this contribution as an example of things he &quot;couldn&#x27;t ever have done [him]self&quot;. In a 1969 interview, Lennon cited &quot;Getting Better&quot; as an example of &quot;pure Beatles&quot; music, whereby, with the four band members developing a song, &quot;we&#x27;ve all written it and we&#x27;ve all turned it into sort of pure Beatle.&quot;

In a 1980 interview in &quot;Playboy&quot; with John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Lennon, when asked about the song, said that the song&#x27;s lyrics came personally from his own experience abusing women in relationships in the past. He states: &quot;It is a diary form of writing. All that &quot; &#x27;I used to be cruel to my woman / I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved&#x27; &quot; was me. I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn&#x27;t express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace, you see. It is the most violent people who go for love and peace. Everything&#x27;s the opposite. But I sincerely believe in love and peace. I am a violent man who has learned not to be violent and regrets his violence. I will have to be a lot older before I can face in public how I treated women as a youngster.&quot;

According to Beatles biographer Hunter Davies, the phrase popped into McCartney’s head one day in 1967 while he was walking his sheepdog Martha in Hampstead.

==Lennon&#x27;s LSD incident==
One of the recording sessions for &quot;Getting Better&quot; is infamous for an incident involving Lennon. During the 21 March 1967 session in which producer George Martin added a piano solo to &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;, Lennon complained that he did not feel well and could not focus. He had accidentally taken LSD when he meant to take an upper. Unaware of the mistake, Martin took him up to the roof of EMI Studios for some fresh air, and returned to Studio Two where McCartney and Harrison were waiting. They knew why Lennon was not well, and upon hearing where Lennon was, rushed to the roof to retrieve him and prevent a possible accident.

==Personnel==
According to Ian MacDonald:
*Paul McCartney – double-tracked vocals, bass guitar, handclapping
*John Lennon – backing vocals, rhythm guitar, handclapping
*George Harrison – backing vocals, lead guitar, tambura, handclapping
*Ringo Starr – drums, congas, handclapping
*George Martin – piano, pianet

==Live performances==
Paul McCartney performed the song live for the first time by any Beatle on his 2002 Driving World Tour. He later reprised the song on his 2003 Back in the World Tour.

<text>Pauillac (; ) is a municipality in the Gironde department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France. The city is mid-way between Bordeaux and the Pointe de Grave, along the Gironde, the largest estuary in western Europe.

==Population==
==Access==
The town is situated on the famous &quot;Route des châteaux&quot; or road &quot;D2&quot; which runs through the centre of the prestigious wine appellations. It stretches from Blanquefort in the South (close to Bordeaux) to the northern tip of the Médoc.

The Pauillac railway station stands on the line from Bordeaux-Ravezies to the Pointe de Grave. It is served by the TER Nouvelle-Aquitaine regional rail network and operated by the French national railway company SNCF.

==Ports==

In 1872, one of the first sailing clubs in France, still active today, was created in Pauillac, followed by the International UCPA sailing school.

In 1896, the French Line Compagnie Générale Transatlantique built a terminal at Pauillac, Trompeloup, on which four cruise ships could dock at a time. A direct connection allowed passengers to join the railway line running between Bordeaux and Soulac. Many companies used this Port for their cruise ships crossing the Atlantic to South America and the Antilles until the mid-20th century.

After WWII, the Port was converted into a petroleum terminal and today it is a transfer point for plane parts of the Airbus A380. The parts are manufactured in Broughton in the UK, and Germany. The barges take them through Bordeaux to a dock at Langon and then by oversize road convoy to the assembly plant at Blagnac, Toulouse.

A new cruise terminal, the &quot;Terminal Médoc&quot;, will be built in Trompeloup and should be operational in 2021, allowing cruise ships carrying up to 6,000 passengers. The marina La Fayette was built in 1977 south of this. It has a fisherman pontoon and moorings for about 150 boats. Many services are available including masting and demasting. Sailors and boaters may have to wait for a couple of hours before entering or leaving the port due to the tide and its high coefficients. A closed and secured area with video surveillance is available for long term parking of boats and trailers. The marina is also home to the lifeboat &quot;Pichon Baron&quot; from the Société Nationale de Sauvetage en Mer (SNSM), a French voluntary organisation founded in 1967 to save lives at sea around the French coast, &quot;so that salt water never taste of tears.&quot;

==History==

In 1777, Lafayette, a French aristocrat and military officer, arrived in Bordeaux and set sail from Pauillac to America. There, his role was decisive in the American War of Independence, commanding American troops in several battles, including the Siege of Yorktown. To commemorate his legacy, a bronze stele representing his ship &quot;La Victoire&quot; is erected on the edge of the marina on the Plaza La Fayette. On the stele can be read in French: &quot;From here on March 25, 1777, embarked Marie Joseph Paul Yves Gilbert Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, with the hope of joining the Americas.&quot; After returning to France, he was a key figure in the French Revolution of 1789 and the July Revolution of 1830, also known as the Second French Revolution.
In April 1815, after trying to rally Royalist forces against Napoleon during the Hundred Days, the Duchess of Angoulême embarked for exile at Pauillac. 

In December 1917, the United States Navy established a naval air station to operate seaplanes during World War I. The base closed shortly after the First Armistice at Compiègne.

In May 1940, an interim occupation authority was established by Nazi Germany in France&#x27;s so-called zone occupée, so that Pauillac was occupied like most parts of the western half of Aquitaine along the Atlantic coast.

==Main sights==
The town is mainly known for its vineyards that produce some of the best wines in Bordeaux. The Tourist Office and Wine House (French: Maison du Tourisme et du Vin) is a very informative resource for all things wine related in the area. There are wine tastings, video screenings, wine sales and seminars.

Some castles offer art exhibitions (Château Pédesclaux for example) or a museum (Mouton Rothschild castle and its museum of wine in Art).

The Village de Bages, a small renovated village next to the Château Lynch-Bages, is dedicated to the wines and tastes of the Pauillac region. It offers a bistro, fine bakery and grocery store, shops and bike workshop arranged around the central square. Cellar tours but also many events are held throughout the year. Cruises operate from the port of Pauillac along the estuary of the Gironde.


The Saint Martin&#x27;s church is situated in the heart of Pauillac on Marshal Joffre Square. In November 1824 were laid the foundations before it would be delivered to worship in May 1828 and completed in 1829. The church was partly built out of the materials from the former church which had become too small. The Bordeaux architect Armand Corcelles was inspired by Greek art. The western façade is topped by a huge pediment which supports an octagonal tower made of two superimposed towers. The first tower houses three bells. Two of them date from 1784 and come from a former church. The third bell, cracked by too brisk and cheerful ringing during the Liberation in 1945, was melted again, baptized and named Edouard-Jeanne-Victoire in 1946. Inside, the nave has eight doric columns. In the choir, the white marble baroque style main altar is covered by a semi-dome. A canopy just above the altar lights it perfectly. An oculus, on a baroque piece of sculpture background, illuminated by the rising sun, represents the triangle of the Divine Trinity. This church also has an ex-voto: a small replication of the warship &quot;Saint Clement&quot;, hanging from the vault in the centre of the nave. It was offered in 1836 by the pilots and coastal pilots of Pauillac: &quot;To honor the memory of Pope Saint Clement, the patron saint of Pauillac naval station sailors, pilots, coastal pilots and aspirants, all Catholics.&quot; The model was restored in 1996. The back of the church is occupied by a large organ loft supported on iron columns. It consists of fifteen stops and was made of wood from Onega, Russia, and northern oak for the organ facade. On the left side of the nave is a wooden pulpit built right up against a pillar surrounded by a double spiral staircase. Facing the pulpit is a Christ on the Cross. On the three walls around the church is a Way of the Cross, fourteen paintings that reproduce the Passion of Christ.

==Sponsoring and twin cities==
Pauillac is the sponsor city of the schooner &quot;Belle Poule&quot;, training ship of the French Navy and the Medoc Squadron of Air Force Base 106.

Pauillac is twinned with the city of Pullach in Bavaria (Germany) and Paulhac in Haute-Garonne (France).

==Events and festivities==

* The Spring in the Castles (Printemps des Châteaux) takes place in April. Visits and wine tastings.
* The lamb festival takes place in June. Garage sales, gastronomic market and Pentecost regattas.
* The international film festival &quot;Les Vendanges du 7ème Art&quot; takes place in July.
* Every Tuesday and Thursday from mid-July to the end of August, a meeting with twenty winemakers is organized at the Tourist Office and Wine House.
* Every day from July to the end of August, a winemaker offers a free tasting at the Tourist Office and Wine House.
* Music and Cook and Wine takes place in August in front of the estuary in the Tourist Office and Wine House&#x27;s gardens. Free concerts, free tastings with local winemakers and a food market with regional specialities.
* The Marathon du Médoc takes place in September. It is considered &quot;the longest Marathon in the world&quot; because the race is interspersed with several activities such as wine tasting stops and orchestras scattered around the course. Most of the 8,500 participants, representing more than 50 nations, run in costume.

==Reed beds==

Extending over several kilometres alongside the estuary, reed beds have flourished and constitute a natural habitat for many plant and animal species. In the more urbanized areas in Pauillac, the reed beds are mown once a year to allow local inhabitants to enjoy the view over the estuary. The mowing period is chosen carefully so as to minimize disturbance of the natural biotope. Some of the reeds are protected by the Natura 2000 legislation. Since 2015, they are part of the Gironde estuary and Pertuis sea Marine Nature Park.

==Wine==

The wines of Pauillac are often considered the quintessence of Bordeaux wines. British author and expert on wine Hugh Johnson has said, &quot;If one had to single out one commune of Bordeaux to head the list, there would be no argument. It would be Pauillac.&quot;

The commune consists of only of vineyards in the Haut-Médoc between the villages of Saint-Julien to the south and Saint-Estèphe to the north, but is home to 18 Grands Crus Classés (classification of 1855) including three of Bordeaux&#x27;s five first-growth wines: Château Lafite Rothschild, Château Latour, and Château Mouton Rothschild.

<doc id="905394" wikidata="Q312401" url="?curid=905394" title="Jerzy Kukuczka">
<text>Józef Jerzy Kukuczka (; 24 March 1948 – 24 October 1989) was a Polish mountaineer who is widely regarded one of the greatest high-altitude climbers in history. In 1987, he became the second man (after Reinhold Messner) to climb all fourteen eight-thousanders in the world; a feat which took him less than 8 years to accomplish. He climbed all, except Lhotse, by new routes or in winter. He is the only person to have climbed two eight-thousanders in one winter and his ascents of Cho Oyu, Kangchenjunga and Annapurna were first winter ascents. His ascent of K2 was made in alpine style with Tadeusz Piotrowski, that route (the so-called &quot;Polish Line&quot;) has not had a second ascent in over 35 years. 

Reinhold Messner, upon hearing that Kukuczka had completed all fourteen 8000ers, wrote to him: &quot;you are not second you are great&quot;, a line which is reproduced as the epigraph of Kukuczka book and the Polish translation forms the title of a biography published in 2021. He died in 1989 while attempting to climb the south face of Lhotse.

==Life and career==
He was born in 1948 in Katowice, his family was ethnically Silesian Goral. He practiced weightlifting in high school and began climbing mountains at the age of 17. He was a trained electrician by profession. In 1965, he became a member of the Mariusz Zaruski Tatra Scouting Club in Katowice. In 1966, he joined the Katowice Alpine Club and completed a climbing course in the Tatra Mountains. After climbing in the Tatras, he progressed rapidly to the Alps, Alaska and the Himalayas.

He climbed his first eight-thousander, Lhotse, in 1979. The following year, he reached the summit of Mount Everest via a new south pillar route. In 1985, he made first winter ascents on Dhaulagiri and Cho Oyu within three weeks. In 1986, he made the first winter ascent of the world&#x27;s third highest mountain, Kangchenjunga, together with Krzysztof Wielicki. The same year, Kukuczka made one of the greatest achievements in his career by establishing a new route on the unclimbed south face of K2, which he and Tadeusz Piotrowski ascended alpine-style after overcoming extreme difficulties and staying in four bivies during the ascent alone. Their accomplishment &quot;pushed the boundaries of Himalayan mountaineering to new heights&quot; with Kukuczka regarding this as the &quot;most challenging climb he had ever undertaken at altitude&quot;.

Throughout his career, he ascended all fourteen eight-thousanders in 7 years, 11 months and 14 days, a feat he achieved on 18 September 1987. He held the world record for shortest time span to summit the eight-thousanders for nearly 27 years until May 2014, when Kim Chang-ho beat his mark by one month and eight days. Unlike many other prominent high-altitude climbers of his time, the routes Kukuczka chose on the Himalayan giants were usually original, many of them first ascents and often done in the grip of winter wind and cold. During his career, Kukuczka established ten new routes on the eight-thousanders (still a record) and climbed four in winter. He was one of an elite group of Polish Himalayan mountaineers called &quot;Ice Warriors&quot;, who specialized in winter ascents. In 1987, he was named Man of the Year in Poland after the completion of the &quot;Crown of the Himalayas&quot;.

In an era in Poland where even the most basic foods were scarce, Kukuczka was able to successfully mount and equip numerous expeditions to far-flung mountain ranges. Usually pressed for cash and equipment, he painted factory chimneys by rope access (industrial climbing) to earn precious złotys to finance his mountaineering dreams.

===Rivalry with Reinhold Messner===
In the 1980s, journalists frequently described the progress of Messner and Kukuczka&#x27;s climbs as a &quot;race to complete the grand slam in climbing,&quot; but both climbers stated they did not like the description or even the implication they were competing. Ultimately, Kukuczka completed his sweep of all of the world&#x27;s eight-thousanders in the winter of 1986-87, but not before Messner finished his grand slam by scaling Manaslu and Lhotse in the autumn of 1986. Kukuczka accomplished this feat in less than eight years, which is twice faster than Messner though. He also established 10 new routes on eight-thousanders compared to Messner&#x27;s six. On the other hand, Messner climbed all eight-thousanders without supplementary oxygen; Kukuczka didn&#x27;t use supplementary oxygen on any eight-thousander except Mount Everest.

===Timeline of ascents above 8,000m===
==Death==
Kukuczka died while attempting to climb the unclimbed South Face of Lhotse in Nepal on 24 October 1989. He was leading a pitch at an altitude of about on a 6 mm secondhand rope he had picked up in a market in Kathmandu. According to Ryszard Pawłowski, Kukuczka&#x27;s climbing partner, the main single rope used by the team was too jammed to be used and the climbers decided to use transport rope instead. When Kukuczka lost his footing and fell, the cord was either cut or it snapped, plunging him around 2,000 metres to his death. His body was never found.

==Personal life==
Kukuczka married Cecylia (&quot;née&quot; Ogrodzińska) with whom he had two sons, Maciej and Wojciech. His younger son, Wojciech, also climbed Mount Everest just like his father. Kukuczka was a Catholic.

==Commemoration==
In the hamlet of Wilcze in Istebna in the highlander&#x27;s summer house Jerzy Kukuczka, there is the Memorial Chamber of Jerzy Kukuczka, created in 1996 by Cecylia Kukuczka (Jerzy&#x27;s wife). Commemorative plaques devoted to the memory of Kukuczka are located in Chukhung, Nepal as well as the Tatra Symbolic Cemetery in Poland.

The mountain &quot;Yak Hotel&quot; in Nepal in Dingboche (4400 m a.s.l.) is named after Jerzy Kukuczka.

The Jerzy Kukuczka Academy of Physical Education is a public university in Katowice that conducts teaching and research in physical education and rehabilitation.

There is also a street in the Gaj district in Wrocław named after him. In 1988, the Polish Post issued a postage stamp featuring Jerzy Kukuczka honouring his reception of the Olympic Order.

In 2015, a statue of Kukuczka designed by Bogumił Burzyński was unveiled at the main entrance to the Physical Education Academy (AWF) in Katowice. His name was also included on the Monument of Alpine Climbers in Katowice.

He is the subject of the book &quot;Kukuczka. Opowieść o najsłynniejszym polskim himalaiście&quot; (Kukuczka: Story of the Poland&#x27;s Greatest Climber) published in 2016 as well as documentary films &quot;Kukuczka&quot; by Jerzy Porębski (2011) and &quot;Jurek&quot; by Paweł Wysoczański (2014). In 2018, Robert Talarczyk directed a play entitled &quot;Himalaje&quot; (The Himalayas) devoted to the life of Kukuczka, which premiered at the Silesian Theatre in Katowice.

<text>21st Century Democrats was an American political organization founded by Senator Tom Harkin, commentator Jim Hightower and Congressman Lane Evans to help elect &quot;progressive candidates” until its termination 2023.

== Background ==
21st Century Democrats started out relatively small, surpassing $1 million in contributions for the first time in the 1996 election cycle. By the 2004 election cycle, according to the Political Money Line, it was the 13th largest political action committee (PAC) in the United States, raising nearly $7M. Among progressive ideological PACs, it ranked fourth behind America Coming Together, EMILY&#x27;s List, and MoveOn.org. However, since 2004 its contributions have gradually fallen, to under $2.2M in 2010 and under $1.2M in 2014.

Unlike traditional PACs, 21st Century Democrats focuses on recruiting, training, and hiring field organizers to organize grassroots campaigns on behalf of candidates for local offices, statewide office, and even targeted presidential swing states. The group has ties to Democracy for America, which grew out of Howard Dean&#x27;s presidential campaign.

== Partner organizations==
In 2009, 21st Century Democrats joined Service Employees International Union, MoveOn.org, and Daily Kos in a new effort called Accountability Now PAC. This new political action committee promised to use party primaries to challenge Democratic incumbents that PAC members do not support.

<text>Steve Jansen (born Stephen Ian Batt, born 1 December 1959) is an English musician, composer and record producer.

==Biography==
Jansen was a founding member of the band Japan, along with his brother David Sylvian (vocals, guitars and keyboards) and Mick Karn (bass guitar), having met in Catford. Japan began as an amateur band in 1974, and the trio were later joined by Richard Barbieri (keyboards) and Rob Dean (guitar). Their first studio album entitled &quot;Adolescent Sex&quot; was released in 1978, followed by &quot;Obscure Alternatives&quot; the same year. Both albums saw polarized reviews and poor sales domestically in the UK, but were commercially successful overseas. The band&#x27;s third album &quot;Quiet Life&quot; marked a significant departure from their original alternative glam rock style, with the change in sound causing them to be associated with the New Romantic movement by critics, though this was repeatedly rejected by the members themselves. Virgin Records released Japan&#x27;s final studio albums, &quot;Gentlemen Take Polaroids&quot; and &quot;Tin Drum&quot;, while the band had their last live performance on 16 December 1982. Japan suffered from personal and creative clashes and decided to split during a period when they were beginning to experience significant commercial success both in their native UK and internationally. The band briefly reunited in 1991 under the name Rain Tree Crow and released a self-titled album.

After Japan&#x27;s break up, Jansen recorded with bandmate Richard Barbieri under the name Jansen/Barbieri and released an instrumental album &quot;Worlds in a Small Room&quot; and later (&quot;Catch the Fall&quot;) as the Dolphin Brothers, with Jansen handling lead vocals as well as drums and percussion.

In 1991, Jansen, Barbieri, and Karn formed Medium Productions as a venue for releasing their own music, as well as releases by other artists.

Jansen has worked as a session musician and in collaboration with a wide range of international artists, such as Yukihiro Takahashi and Italian singer-songwriter Alice. He collaborated with David Sylvian and Burnt Friedman on the Nine Horses project, which has given birth to one album and one extended play CD released through Sylvian&#x27;s record label Samadhi Sound. Jansen performed with Sylvian during his live tours, playing drums and percussion.

He released his first solo album, entitled &quot;Slope&quot; in 2007. Regarding the creative process behind the album, Jansen stated that he &quot;approached composition attempting to avoid chord and song structures and the usual familiar building blocks. Instead I wanted to piece together unrelated sounds, music samples, rhythms and &#x27;events&#x27; in an attempt to deviate from my own trappings as a musician.&quot; The album was released on Samadhi Sound, and features Sylvian in a &quot;bluesy&quot; duet with Joan Wasser, and contributions by Anja Garbarek, Sweet Billy Pilgrim, Thomas Feiner and Nina Kinert. On 15 April 2016 Jansen released a second solo album entitled &quot;Tender Extinction&quot; via Bandcamp and other digital music retailers.

Jansen has continued to work on new compositions, some of which he has released as standalone tracks, and continues to be in demand as a producer and collaborator, working with musicians across a range of genres. A recent re-release of the 1995 Jansen/Barbieri album &quot;Stone to Flesh&quot; includes a new track entitled &quot;Map of Falling,&quot; composed by the two musicians in 2015.

During his time with Japan, Jansen dabbled in photography, documenting the band and their transient lifestyle. He held small-scale photographic exhibitions in Tokyo and London during 1982 and 1983, respectively. A selection of these images are available on his website. In October 2015, Steve released a book of his photography entitled &quot;Through a Quiet Window&quot; through the Japanese publisher Artes Publishing.

Jansen maintained a Tumblr blog under the username of &quot;Sleepyard&quot; as an additional avenue to publish his photography and answer fan questions, but wrote a post on in April 2016 stating that he would no longer maintain it, citing his displeasure with the platform as a whole. Later in the same month, Jansen re-launched his blog through WordPress.

In 2014, Jansen formed a new musical project, Exit North, with three Swedish musicians Charlie Storm, Ulf Jansson and Thomas Feiner. They worked together in Charlie Storm&#x27;s studio in Gothenburg, and the album was released on 1 October 2018, called &quot;Book of Romance and Dust&quot;. Exit North played live in Tokyo, Japan, on 27 September 2019. In 2020, Exit North released a new single, &quot;Let the Hearts Desire&quot;. Their second album, &quot;Anyway, Still&quot;, was released on 14 April 2023.

<doc id="905409" wikidata="Q1218112" url="?curid=905409" title="The Three Musketeers (1921 film)">
<text>The Three Musketeers is a 1921 American silent film based on the 1844 novel &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; by Alexandre Dumas, père. It was directed by Fred Niblo and stars Douglas Fairbanks as d&#x27;Artagnan. The film originally had scenes filmed in the Handschiegl Color Process (billed as the &quot;Wyckoff-DeMille Process&quot;). The film had a sequel, &quot;The Iron Mask&quot; (1929), also starring Fairbanks as d&#x27;Artagnan and DeBrulier as Cardinal Richelieu.

==Plot summary==
In the royal court of France, Cardinal Richelieu vies for influence over King Louis XIII. The greatest obstacle to his dominance is Anne of Austria, the Queen of France. Anne is loved by the Duke of Buckingham, an Englishman, although she remains faithful to Louis. Louis gives her a diamond encrusted brooch.

In Gascony, d&#x27;Artagnan leaves his home to seek his fortune. He travels to Paris, where he meets the Three Musketeers. The Three Musketeers and d&#x27;Artagnan cause trouble around Paris and frequently fight with Cardinal Richelieu&#x27;s guardsmen. d&#x27;Artagnan falls in love with Constance, the Queen&#x27;s seamstress.

Cardinal Richelieu forges a letter from Anne to the Duke of Buckingham inviting him to Paris. The Duke arrives, but Anne gently rebuffs him. He requests something to remember her by. Anne gives the Duke her diamond brooch and he returns to England. Richelieu manipulates the King into asking Anne to wear the brooch at an upcoming ball.

Knowing the Queen will be dishonored if the brooch is discovered missing, Constance asks d&#x27;Artagnan to retrieve the brooch from England. d&#x27;Artagnan and the Three Musketeers depart for England. Richelieu discovers d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s mission and sends his agents to stop him. One by one the Three Musketeers stay behind to prevent d&#x27;Artagnan from falling into the Cardinal&#x27;s traps. d&#x27;Artagnan sails to England and retrieves the brooch. He arrives back in Paris to deliver the brooch to Queen Anne. d&#x27;Artagnan, Constance, and the Three Musketeers are reunited. d&#x27;Artagnan is made a member of the King&#x27;s Musketeers.

==Production==

The athletic Douglas Fairbanks was known for performing his own stunts. His left-handed handspring balanced on a short dagger during one of the fight scenes is the most well-known from the picture, and is generally considered the most difficult of his career. Fairbanks biographer Jeffrey Vance enthuses, &quot;&quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; was the first of the grand Fairbanks costume films, filled with exemplary production values and ornamentation. Indeed, one ornament extended beyond the film: Fairbanks wore d&#x27;Artagnan&#x27;s moustache—cultivated for &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;—to the end of his life. With &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;, he at last found his metier and crystallized his celebrity and his cinema.&quot;

==Preservation status==
In April 1939, Fairbanks donated his entire film collection to the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA), including both a 35mm nitrate negative and a tinted positive print. The negative was duplicated in 1963, and this print was used for the restoration completed in May 2017 by MoMA, the San Francisco Silent Film Festival, and Film Preservation Society. MoMA and Image Protection Services also finished a color restoration in February 2021.

<doc id="905438" wikidata="Q238691" url="?curid=905438" title="Princess Lalla Salma of Morocco">
<text>Princess &quot;[[Lalla (title)|Lalla]]&quot; Salma (born Salma Bennani, , 10 May 1977) is the former wife of Mohammed VI of Morocco. They married in 2002, and she became the first wife of a Moroccan ruler to have been publicly acknowledged. She was last seen in an official capacity in December 2017, and it was later on reported, in 2018, that she and Mohammed VI had divorced.

==Early life and education==
She was born as Salma Bennani in Fez. Her father is Abdelhamid Bennani, a university teacher who taught at &quot;l&#x27;École normale supérieure de Fès&quot; and her mother is Naïma Bensouda, who died in 1981 when Salma was three years old. From then on, she and her sister Meryem (who became a doctor) were raised by her maternal grandmother, Fatma Abdellaoui Maâne. She lived in Rabat, with her half cousin Saira, and the two are commonly seen together in public.

She was educated in Rabat, where she attended a private school, Lycée Hassan II, Lycée Moulay Youssef, and the . After completing her engineering studies, she worked for a few months as an information services engineer at ONA Group, the country&#x27;s largest private holding company (which is also controlled by the Moroccan royal family). 

She is fluent in Arabic and French, and also speaks Spanish, which she learned later on.

==Marriage and children==
Lalla Salma became engaged to King Mohammed VI, whom she first met during a private party in 1999, on 12 October 2001. Their first wedding ceremony, the &quot;sadaq&quot; ceremony (or proclamation of marriage) took place on 20 March 2002; and the &quot;zafaf&quot; (or celebration of marriage) took place on 12 and 13 July 2002 at &quot;Dar al-Makhzen&quot; (the principal Royal palace) in Rabat.
===Issue===
==Activities==
&quot;Lalla&quot; Salma kept quite a low profile as Princess of Morocco, although a more public one than her predecessors. Between 2005 and 2019, she was president of the Lalla Salma Foundation for Cancer Prevention and Treatment. This foundation was created in September 2005, and has also been involved in HIV/AIDS prevention in Africa. Lalla Salma also presided annually over the celebration of World No Tobacco Day, where the Foundation presented the achievements of its &quot;Tobacco-Free Colleges and High Schools&quot; program (launched in November 2007). After her divorce, she stoped performeing any public engagements. It has been reported that she is still active in the foundation, but there is no specific information confirming her continued presidency. Press releases from the Foundation only mention the work of the foundation under the leadership of its executive director, Dr. Rachid Bekkali.

In 2006, Princess Lalla Salma was named a Goodwill Ambassador of the World Health Organization for the Cancer Care, Promotion and Prevention. Besides being involved in cancer and HIV/AIDS prevention, she also supports and encourages women&#x27;s empowerment.

From 2004 to her divorce in 2018, she presided over the opening ceremony of the Fez Sacred Music Festival, an event under the Patronage of King Mohammed VI.

Lalla Salma represented the King and Morocco in meetings and gatherings in Saudi Arabia, Japan, Thailand, Palestine, Tunisia and France. On 29 April 2011, she attended the wedding of Prince William, Duke of Cambridge and Catherine Middleton. She also attended the wedding of Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg, and Countess Stéphanie de Lannoy in 2012 and the 2013 inauguration of King Willem-Alexander.

In May 2017, the &quot;Mosque H.R.H. Princess Lalla Salma&quot; was built in her honor and inaugurated in Fez. Built on Al Mizane Square, the mosque has a capacity of more than 3,000 worshippers.

Since her divorce, she occasionally took on engagements in a private capacity, and was last seen attending one in 2021.

== Divorce ==
At the beginning of 2018, her media absence was noted. Her last public appearance was in December 2017 at the Mohammed VI Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Rabat. 

In 2018, Spanish and Italian media reported that it was Lalla Salma who requested the divorce. She had already left her husband before his hospitalization on 26 February 2018, which explained her absence at the king&#x27;s bedside (after his heart arrhythmia surgery in Paris). The media added that she had left the Dar Es Salam in Rabat and was living somewhere in Rabat. On 21 March 2018, the magazine &quot;¡Hola!&quot;, citing anonymous sources, explained that the princess and the sovereign had divorced and that the custody of the two children remained with the king. Their divorce was reportedly effective and confirmed by sources close to the palace, although not officially commented on. 

Spanish journalist Andrea Mori claimed: &#x27;In talking with a friend in Morocco, [I learned] that it is likely that money is given to Lalla Salma and that she be hidden from the public...&#x27;. Her divorce from the king resulted in her exclusion from all public appearances and the removal of all her official duties. She was also reportedly forbidden from keeping the expensive jewelry she had received as gifts during her marriage. 

After her divorce, Lalla Salma remained in Morocco, which denied rumors that she had settled in France, where she had many friends, or in Greece, where she owned properties. Staying close to her children was a priority for her. Regarding her new life after Dar Es Salam, she lived in the residential area of Rabat and had &#x27;regular visits to the palace to see her children&#x27;. 

In 2019, the French lawyer of the King of Morocco, Éric Dupond-Moretti, referred to Lalla Salma as the &#x27;ex-wife&#x27;. This statement unofficially confirmed the royal couple&#x27;s divorce. 

On 8 January 2025, the magazine &quot;Gala&quot; explained that it is now Lalla Salma who holds custody of her children and that she has been authorized to return to the Dar Es Salam palace and live there with her children.

==Honours==
*: Dame Grand Cross of the Order of Isabella the Catholic (14 January 2005).
*: Grand Cross of the Order of Merit (1 December 2008).
*: Gold Medal of the World Health Organization (25 May 2017).

<doc id="905464" wikidata="Q12180673" url="?curid=905464" title="Endor (Star Wars)">
<text>Endor (designated: IX3244-A) is a fictional moon in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe, known for its endless forests, savannahs, grasslands, mountain ranges, and a few oceans. The moon was the site of a pivotal battle depicted in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. It is the homeworld of the sentient Dulok, Ewok, and Yuzzum species, as well as the semi-sentient Gorax and Wistie species. The Endor solar cycle is 402 GSC days orbital, with a breathable earth-like atmosphere conducive for humans, 85% Standard Gravity and 8% surface water. It is where Darth Vader&#x27;s funeral is held.

The moon orbits Tana—the Ewokese word for Endor&#x27;s host planet—a gas giant located in the Endor system, a star system positioned in the Moddell sector of the galaxy&#x27;s Outer Rim Territories. Located in grid square H-16 on the Standard Galactic Grid, it was connected to Cerea and Bakura by a hyperspace route. Other nearby planets in the H-16 sector include Rattatak, Bunduki, Tirracles, Ponemah, and Firrerre. The planet was orbited by nine moons, the largest of which was known as the forest moon of Endor or &quot;sanctuary moon&quot;. The ocean moon of [[Kef Bir]] was also one of these moons, and is the location where the second Death Star crashed after it exploded over Endor in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. It also had two suns: Endor Prime I and Endor Prime II.

==Description==
The forest moon of Endor first appears in &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;, in which it is the body in whose orbit the second Death Star is constructed, and is the home of a race of furry aliens called Ewoks. The moon later appears in the original Star Tours Disney theme park attraction, Ewok TV movies &quot;The Ewok Adventure&quot; and &quot;&quot;, as well as the animated &quot;Ewoks&quot; and its Marvel Comics tie-in series.

Various descriptions of the Endor system exist in various media. Special effects storyboards for &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; refer to a distant orb in the system as &quot;Planet Endor&quot;. According to the &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot; novelization, the planet disappeared in an ancient cataclysm. The Ewok television films depict a gas giant in the sky, and novels such as &quot;The Truce at Bakura&quot; and &quot;Dark Apprentice&quot; also mention a planet visible from the moon. The planet is called &quot;Tana&quot; in the &quot;Ewoks&quot; animated series, which depicts a binary star system (while other sources depict only one sun). According to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; Databank, this &quot;can be attributed to Ewok lore and myth&quot;.

In a &quot;Star Wars Tales&quot; comic entitled &quot;Apocalypse Endor&quot;, an Imperial veteran of Endor refers to the moon being devastated by the impact of falling debris from the Death Star, which was blown up while in orbit around the moon. However, another character dismisses this as a myth, saying that most of the Death Star&#x27;s mass was obliterated in the explosion, and that the Rebels &quot;took care of the rest&quot;. &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot; depicts the wreckage of the second Death Star in a watery location, named Kef Bir, an ocean moon featured in the film that orbits the same gas giant as the forest moon. Wicket W. Warrick and his son Pommet appear briefly at the end of &quot;The Rise of Skywalker&quot;, at the sky after the destruction of a &quot;Resurgent&quot;-class Star Destroyer.

Endor is located in the same sector as planets like Firrerre, Rattatak, Tirracles, and Bunduki, among others.

==Filming==
Scenes set on Endor were filmed on private logging company land that was shortly thereafter clearcut near the town of Smith River, California; the speeder chase scene was filmed at the Chetham Grove section of Grizzly Creek Redwoods State Park near the &quot;Avenue of the Giants&quot; in Humboldt Redwoods State Park.

==Theme park attraction==
Endor also appeared in the theme park attraction Star Tours - The Adventures Continue in Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios in Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida and Disneyland Park in Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California.

<doc id="905478" wikidata="Q3954915" url="?curid=905478" title="English saddle">
<text>English saddles are used to ride horses in English riding disciplines throughout the world. The discipline is not limited to England, the United Kingdom in general or other English-speaking countries. This style of saddle is used in all of the Olympic and International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) equestrian disciplines, except for the newly approved FEI events of equestrian vaulting and reining. Most designs were specifically developed to allow the horse freedom of movement, whether jumping, running, or moving quickly across rugged, broken country with fences. Unlike the western saddle or Australian Stock Saddle, there is no horn or other design elements that stick out above the main tree of the saddle.

==Construction==
The English saddle is based on a solid tree, over which webbing, leather and padding materials are added. Traditionally, the tree of an English saddle is built of laminated layers of high quality wood, reinforced with steel underneath the front arch, and around the rear underside of the tree from quarter to quarter. The sides of the tree that run horizontally along the horse&#x27;s back are known as bars. Many modern trees are made with spring steel running from front to rear between the bars. These trees are somewhat flexible and are known as &quot;spring trees,&quot; with the degree of flexibility varying from saddle to saddle. More recently, saddle manufacturers are using various materials to replace wood and create a synthetic molded tree (some still using spring steel and a steel gullet plate). Synthetic materials vary widely in quality. Polyurethane trees are often very well-made, but some very cheap saddles are made with fiberglass trees that are not so durable.

Leather is added on all sides of the tree to create the seat, flaps and panels. Cowhide is usually used, though pigskin and other leathers are also seen. The panels on the underside of the saddle traditionally are stuffed with wool flock, which is still preferred and used on the highest quality saddles. Synthetic materials, including foam and fiberfill materials, are used on more moderately priced saddles, and one company currently sells a design that uses airtight sealed panels that are inflated with air. 

==Parts of the English saddle==

*Tree: the base on which the rest of the saddle is built, usually based on wood or a wood-like synthetic material, with metal elements added, such as the stirrup bar and, in some cases, the gullet. It is eventually covered in leather or synthetic material as the saddle is built.
*Panels: the part of an English saddle which provides cushioning between the horse&#x27;s back and the saddle, and allows adjustment in fitting the saddle to the horse. Also important in keeping the saddle balanced for the rider. Often stuffed with wool or foam flocking, or maintained by sealed air pockets. The panels under the cantle are called the &quot;rear panels.&quot; Those at the front of the saddle are called the &quot;front panels.&quot; However, the rear and front panels are one continuous unit, which can be seen if the saddle is flipped over. The saddle has two panels total, one on each side of the horse&#x27;s spine.
*Gullet: The space between the bars of the saddle which provides clearance for the horse&#x27;s spine so the saddle does not place pressure on it. The gullet width of the saddle is dictated by the front arch of the tree. In some models, the angle (and thus the width) of the front arch can be adjusted on an individual saddle by use of interchangeable elements. Though imprecise terminology, the gap between the stuffed panels is colloquially referred to as the gullet.
*Seat: the dip in the saddle where the rider&#x27;s seatbones rest, it is the lowest part of the saddle&#x27;s topline. The deeper the seat, the more security is provided for the rider.
*Pommel: the front of the saddle, which is raised higher than the seat both to provide security for the rider and to give the horse&#x27;s withers clearance.
*Cantle: the back of the saddle, which is raised higher than the seat to give security.
*Waist or Twist: the part of the saddle between the seat and the pommel, on which the rider&#x27;s pelvic bone rests. The width of the waist has a great effect on rider&#x27;s comfort, especially for women riders.
*Skirt or Jockey: piece of leather that goes over the stirrup bar, to help prevent the rider&#x27;s leg from rubbing on the buckle of the stirrup leather (which is adjusted so it is right against the stirrup bar). It also helps to keep the buckle of the stirrup leather from unbuckling and sliding down. The skirt is small to allow easy access to the stirrup leather.
*Saddle flap: The large piece of leather on the exterior of an English saddle that goes between the rider&#x27;s leg and the billets and girth buckles. The shape and length of the saddle flap is directly related to the intended use of the saddle, as it must mirror the rider&#x27;s leg position.
*Sweat flap: The large piece of leather on the underside of the saddle that goes between the billets and the horse. It helps to protect the rest of the saddle from the sweat of the horse, and the horse&#x27;s skin from being pinched by the girth straps and buckles. In monoflap saddles it is lightweight and sewn to the saddle flap, with extended girth points enabling the girth to be buckled below the flap.
*Billets or points: Straps which are secured over the saddle tree on stout webbing and hang down, to which the girth is buckled. They have several holes in them to adjust the tightness of the girth. There are generally three billets, allowing a spare in the event one billet is torn or frayed. Some saddles have very long billets to buckle the girth below the saddle flap to reduce the bulk underneath the rider&#x27;s leg, allowing for closer contact with the horse. The foremost point is usually attached to a narrow web, and the rear two to a wider web.
*Girth Buckle guard: the billets are threaded through the Girth buckle guard, which protects the saddle flap from getting worn away by the buckles of the girth. These are not always present on saddles with long billets, which are intended to be buckled below the saddle flap.
*Knee roll: the padded part at the front of the English saddle&#x27;s panel and sweat flap, helping to give the rider more leg support. It may be very wide and thick, very thin (a pencil-roll), or not present at all. Additional padding on the outside flap of the saddle is sometimes added for extra grip.
*Thigh roll: the padded part at the rear of the panel&#x27;s sweat flap, which lies behind the rider&#x27;s thigh and can give extra stability in the saddle. Very common in dressage saddles but much less so in jumping saddles as it may interfere with freedom of movement of the rider&#x27;s leg.
*Calf block: padding that falls behind the rider&#x27;s lower leg, helps to keep it in place and stabilize the rider. It is only seen on a few saddle models.
*Stirrup: part of the saddle in which the rider&#x27;s feet rest, provides support and leverage to the rider.
**Stirrup Bar: part of the tree of the saddle which allows stirrups to be attached. It is made of strong metal and riveted to the tree. The stirrup bar is often kept in the &quot;open&quot; position, so that, should the rider fall and start to be dragged, the stirrup leather can release off the saddle, freeing the rider. There are only a few instances in which the bar should be kept in the &quot;closed&quot; position, and some stirrup bar designs cannot be closed.
**Iron: The metal part of a stirrup, in which the foot of the rider rests. It provides support and leverage. It is usually made of stainless steel, not iron.
**Leather: The part of the stirrup which attached the stirrup iron to the stirrup bar of the saddle. It can be adjusted to change the lengths of stirrups. &quot;Leathers&quot; is correct plural usage.
*Stirrup leather keeper: keeper sewn onto the saddle flap, through which the extra stirrup leather is passed. Keeps it neatly out of the way so it doesn&#x27;t get under the rider&#x27;s leg. Some saddles simply have a slot cut into the saddle flat, through which the leather is passed.
*D-ring or Staple: a metal ring with rounded or squared corners on the front of an English saddle, to which certain pieces of equipment, such as breastplates, can be attached. May be of stand-up or centrally hinged design. Some are stitched into leather and can be pulled out of the saddle when under stress. Some are fixed through the front arch of the tree for greater strength.

==History of the English saddle==
During the 18th century, most riders in Europe used high-pommel and cantle saddles, with a wooden frame for classical dressage. This saddle was based on a model used for bull fighting, cattle work, long-distance travel, and mounted combat, as its high pommel and cantle helped to provide the rider with support. This saddle is still used today, most notably by the Spanish Riding School, and also in Iberia and eastern Europe.

In England, foxhunting grew in popularity (as the usual quarry of deer had dwindled following the English Civil War, when they were hunted for food). This required a new type of riding, as horse and rider now had to tackle fences, hedges, ditches, and banks straight on if they wished to keep up with the hounds and witness the kill. The old saddle was cumbersome while hunting. Its cantle would get in the way of the riders as they tried to lean back over the fence (a practice that was common until Caprilli developed the &quot;forward seat&quot;), and the high pommel created pain as the rider went over jumps. The resulting saddle developed for foxhunting had a very low pommel and cantle with a flat seat, and no padding under the leg, therefore providing the rider with little, if any, support. The stirrup bars were protruding, and placed more forward than modern saddles, which made it nearly impossible for the rider to keep his legs underneath his body. However, the usual practice was to ride with longer stirrups, and the feet pushed out in front, so this was not a problem.

The English hunting saddle is the predecessor of all English-type riding saddles. As the sports of show jumping and eventing became more popular, saddle shape changed. Caprilli, Santini, and Toptani developed the &quot;forward seat,&quot; in which the rider uses shorter stirrups and keeps his legs under him as he rode in two-point, with his seat bones hovering above the saddle. The shorter stirrup required a more forward flap, to match the greater knee angle of the rider. The protruding stirrup bars were uncomfortable in this new position, so they were recessed. The waist of the saddle was also made narrower. Additionally, padding was placed under the knee rolls, for extra security.

==Differences from Stock saddles==

The term &quot;English saddle&quot; encompasses several types, including those used for show jumping and hunt seat, dressage, Saddle seat, horse racing and polo. To non-horsemen, the major distinguishing feature of an English saddle is its lack of a horn. However, some Western saddles, such as those used to ride rough stock in rodeos and certain types of western-influenced saddles used in endurance riding, lack a horn as well. These saddles can still be classified as western-influenced, however, due to the deep seat, high cantle, prominent pommels, wide fenders (stirrup leathers) and large, leather-covered stirrups. In addition, saddles used for working cattle in nations other than the United States, such as the Australian Stock Saddle and the Charro Saddles of South America, often share stock saddle features such as a deep seat and extra leather to protect horse and rider, but lack a horn.

The other major characteristic which defines an English saddle is that it has &quot;panels&quot;: these are a pair of pads attached to the underside of the seat and filled with wool, foam, or air.
Although some modern saddlers have developed alternative models, the English saddle is usually constructed on a framework known as a &quot;tree&quot;. The tree is made of wood, spring steel, or composite, and it supports the rider on a sling of webbing between the firm &quot;pommel&quot; (front of the saddle) and &quot;cantle&quot; (back of the saddle). On either side of the tree, a steel hook known as the &quot;stirrup bar&quot; is affixed. It is upon this hook that the rider hangs the &quot;stirrup leather&quot;, which is a very strong leather or nylon loop supporting the stirrup. More very strong leather or nylon straps known as &quot;billets&quot; (or &quot;girth points/straps&quot; - UK) are attached to stout webbing which is tacked across the top of the tree, to which will eventually buckle the &quot;girth&quot;--the beltlike strap which holds the saddle onto the horse.

The tree and its various parts are upholstered with a covering made of leather, nylon or microfiber and shaped to form the seat above and the panels below. 

In addition to the seat and panels, English saddles feature leather flaps on either side; the underside flap is called the sweat flap, and the upper flap is called the saddle flap (or, simply and appropriately, the &quot;flap&quot;). The flaps sit between the rider&#x27;s leg and the horse&#x27;s side and protects the horse from being pinched by the stirrup leather or girth, and the rider&#x27;s leg from being chafed by the girth buckles. On some saddles it is also specially padded to protect or support the rider&#x27;s knee.

==Styles of English saddles==
The differences between the styles of English saddle are small but significant. The most important distinctions are the location and therefore the balance of the seat, and the flap length and shape. A saddle used for a discipline where the rider sits more upright with a longer leg, such as in dressage, has a flap that is longer to accommodate the leg, and less inclined forward (as the knee does not need to go forward). The seat will also be closer to the withers, to keep the rider&#x27;s center of gravity in the correct spot. However, in disciplines where the rider needs shorter stirrups for better balance and security, such as in the jumping disciplines, the saddle flap is moved proportionately forward and shortened, and the seat is moved further back. A jumping saddle will have a shorter and more forward flap than a dressage saddle, with the seat slightly more towards the cantle. If the flap was not inclined forward, the rider’s knee would hang over the flap, and the flap would constantly push the leg out of position (usually backward), so that the rider would become unstable and interfere with his horse. If the seat was not moved rearward, the rider would be forced ahead of the saddle over a fence. A racing saddle, where jockeys ride with incredibly short stirrups, will have an extremely forward and short saddle flap (almost more horizontal than vertical), and the seat will be extended well back from the pommel to keep the rider’s center of gravity correctly situated.

Supportive padding in the seat, size and shape of knee rolls and the use of additional blocks behind the leg is also considered when developing a saddle. While a polo saddle is constructed with a minimum of padding so as to allow the polo player great freedom to twist and reach for his shot, a saddle used for jumping or eventing may have more padding to help give the rider support over fences. Another development is the monoflap saddle, in which both the sweat flap and saddle flap are made of lighter weight leather, stitched together around the edges leaving only a passage point for the girth straps, thus reducing the thickness of leather between the rider and the horse, and giving a closer feel, while still protecting the horse&#x27;s skin from straps.

===All-Purpose or Eventing saddle===

The &quot;all-purpose&quot; or &quot;eventing&quot; saddle (also sometimes called a &quot;general purpose&quot; saddle) was developed to allow riders to use one saddle both over fences and on the flat. This type of saddle has a deep seat with a long, but somewhat forward flap. The flaps usually have padding under the leg, for support while jumping. The design is intended to be a compromise between the flatter &quot;close contact&quot; jumping saddle with a forward flap, and deep-seated dressage saddle with a long, straight flap. 

This style of saddle is most commonly seen in amateur-owner or lower-level junior competition. The less-expensive &quot;all-purpose&quot; models are often marketed as beginner&#x27;s saddles. More expensive models are usually labeled &quot;eventing&quot; saddles. Manufacturers insist that there is a significant design difference between an eventing saddle and an all-purpose saddle. However, while eventing saddles usually do have better balance and higher quality materials and workmanship, a fundamental design difference is otherwise difficult to discern. Many manufacturers create two models, one with a slightly straighter dressage-oriented flap that still allows a rider to jump low fences, and another with a more forward flap that allows a rider to jump somewhat more challenging fences, but still permit a deep seat for flat work. One company manufactures a design with a flap that can be adjusted to be straighter or more forward, as the rider prefers.

Due to the deep, secure-feeling seat, the design is also used by some people when starting young, unpredictable horses, and is quite popular for trail riding, endurance riding, and casual hacking. Many top-level endurance riders find this design superior to an &quot;endurance&quot; style saddle for distance competition because it allows them to get off the horse&#x27;s back and move quickly over rough or mountainous terrain, yet provides greater security to the rider. On the other hand, this compromise design also means that an advanced rider may find the saddle limits his or her ability to obtain a correct position at higher levels of competition, either in show jumping or dressage. For this reason, some English riding instructors and coaches do not particularly encourage their riders to use these saddles. 

Quality and balance are very critical factors to consider when purchasing an all-purpose saddle. Many cheap models are designed with a too-forward cut flap that is not properly aligned with the seat, which prevents the rider from getting into a correct position on the flat and sometimes gives the rider the uncomfortable sensation of feeling like they are constantly sliding backwards. Also, when the stirrups are adjusted correctly for jumping, the rider&#x27;s knees are not always placed properly in relation to the flap. Some models also are too high in the cantle, which can hit a rider in the buttocks and push the seat too far forward when jumping all but the smallest fences.

===The Jumping saddle===

The jumping saddle, sometimes called a &quot;forward seat&quot; or &quot;close contact&quot; saddle, is designed for show jumping, hunt seat equitation, foxhunting, and the show jumping and cross-country phases of eventing. Its most distinctive feature is a forward-cut flap that allows for a shorter stirrup length (although not as short as racing stirrups). The flap often has supportive padded knee rolls, especially for show jumping and cross-country, less so for equitation. The balance of the seat is further back and comparatively flat, with the cantle and pommel low so that they do not interfere with the rider&#x27;s jumping position (and variations known as &quot;two-point position&quot; or &quot;half-seat&quot;).

Like the All-Purpose saddle, the jumping saddle usually has three short billets. However, other styles (such as monoflap jumping saddles) have longer billets that mirror the dressage saddle, so that the rider no longer has to ride with extra bulk under the leg.

It is important that the rider&#x27;s leg fit appropriately into the flap of the jumping saddle when the stirrups are shortened. If the knee is too far forward or back, the rider&#x27;s balance will be incorrect and the saddle becomes a hindrance rather than an advantage while jumping obstacles.

===Dressage saddle===

Dressage saddles have a very straight-cut flap, much longer than a jumping saddle, which accommodates the longer leg position of a dressage rider, who works only on the flat and does not need to jump fences. The pommel is a bit higher and the deepest point of the saddle&#x27;s seat more forward, all to allow for this longer leg position. 

The seat is usually much deeper in a dressage saddle than a jumping saddle, and allows the rider to sit comfortably and relax to best influence the horse. The stuffing of the panels is often kept to a minimum in a dressage saddle, to allow a closer feel with the horse. It often has a wider bearing surface than a jumping saddle. 

Some designs feature an exaggerated amount of padding in front of the knee, much more than in a jumping saddle, said to assist the rider in keeping the knee down and thigh back. However, there is usually little padding behind the calf, as the rider needs to be able to freely move the lower leg to give aids to the horse.

The billets of most dressage saddles are very long, to allow the girth to be buckled near the horse&#x27;s elbow rather than underneath the rider&#x27;s leg (which would get in the way of giving effecting leg aids). However, some dressage saddles come with shorter billets.

===The Saddle seat saddle===
The saddle seat saddle, also sometimes called a &quot;Park,&quot; &quot;Lane Fox&quot; or &quot;cutback,&quot; is a variation on the English show saddle. It is seen most often in the USA and Canada, but also on occasion in South Africa and other parts of the world. It is used most often on the high-action and gaited horses of the Americas. Gaited breeds using this saddle include the American Saddlebred, Tennessee Walking Horse, and Missouri Foxtrotter. Non-gaited but action-oriented breeds such as the Morgan and the Arabian, are commonly shown in saddle seat style, though these breeds also have hunt seat divisions. 

The seat of this saddle is longer and flatter than that of a forward seat or dressage saddle. The seat places the rider&#x27;s center of balance farther back on the horse than in other English riding disciplines, though correct saddle seat equitation still demands that the rider&#x27;s legs and feet be balanced under the horse. The pommel is always cut back to allow greater freedom of the front legs and shoulder, as well as to accommodate the higher set neck and higher withers typical of the saddle seat breeds. The flap is wide front-to-back, with no blocks or rolls beneath, and ends closer to the cantle than any other English saddle so that the rider&#x27;s leg (whose thigh is further back than in other styles because the seat is also farther back) is protected. Riders use very long stirrups, usually at least as long as those of dressage riders. 

The saddle seat was developed from two sources. The first was a flatter European saddle developed to sit the rider further back to show off the high front leg action of flashy horses, often seen quite literally during Sunday rides in city parks. (&quot;See English Show Saddle, below.&quot;) The second source was the plantation saddle developed in the southern United States that allowed riders to sit back comfortably on a gaited horse as they covered large areas of land on a daily basis.

===Endurance saddle===

The Endurance saddle, originally based on a military or police saddle, is used for the long-distance competition of endurance riding. Its major task is to provide the horse and rider with the comfort and balance needed to cover long distances over rough terrain, sometimes for multiple days. For the rider, the seat is often quilted or padded, and the stirrups are designed with a wide foot tread to reduce fatigue. For the horse, the panels of the saddle are extended to provide a larger area of contact with the back, thus reducing fatigue linked to the pounds per square inch of saddle contact. The saddle has many dee rings along the pommel and cantle that allow the rider to attach various items.

Modern endurance saddle manufacturers have been innovative in methods to lighten weight and provide additional comfort for the horse, and several of these techniques have gone on to influence other saddle types. The panels are stuffed with different types of material, all designed to spread pressure evenly and disperse sweat. Most endurance saddles may have extended panels (called &quot;fans&quot; or &quot;blazers&quot;), which increase bearing area. Others may have &quot;floating&quot; panels, which are particularly useful since endurance riders often ride with their seat out of the saddle (releasing pressure from the back, but increasing the amount felt on the stirrup bars where they attach near the point of the tree).

There is also an endurance saddle design based on the western saddle that is a bit larger and heavier, but is designed with similar goals.

===English showing saddle===

This saddle is used in the United Kingdom, Australia, and elsewhere, for showing on the flat or over low fences, and is a direct descendant of the English hunting saddle. The show saddle is designed to show off the horse&#x27;s conformation, most notably the shoulder, and is therefore a minimal saddle with a close fit and straight-cut flap. The seat is very flat, and there are no knee or thigh rolls, so the saddle offers little support to the rider. Like the American Saddle Seat saddle, the English showing saddle has a stirrup bar set farther forward and a cutback pommel that falls behind rather than over the withers, though the seat is less flat and the rider&#x27;s center of balance is closer to that of a dressage saddle. Many show horses are also presented in fatter condition than in more athletic disciplines, so the billets are placed to help keep the saddle properly placed on a rounder animal, with the foremost billet on show pony saddles frequently being attached directly to the point of the front arch of the tree; this is known as a &quot;forward point&quot;.

The traditional position of the old style show rider was to ride with the feet placed forward, and the seat pushed back, which was once thought to encourage more action and to make the horse look as if it has a longer front end. Modern competitors are starting a trend to a more classical position, with the leg placed underneath their body and their hips over their heel, a position more forgiving on the horse&#x27;s back that encourages better movement. The traditional English showing saddle is not used by these riders, and instead a more modern dressage-like saddle is used, with a more vertically cut flap. There sometimes is slight padding in these saddles, providing extra support, and the horses themselves are often shown in leaner, more athletic condition.

The American-style Saddle Seat position, set behind the horse&#x27;s center of balance, somewhat resembles the old-style show position, though the modern rider remains balanced over the stirrups.

===Sidesaddle===

The sidesaddle was used by women from approximately the 14th through 19th centuries, when a combination of long skirts and social mores discouraged women from riding astride. Today the saddle is still widely used for specialty purposes in shows, parades, and other exhibitions. It has use for practical purposes by some riders who have injuries that make it difficult to ride astride. A smaller number of riders feel that sidesaddle riding is a skill and riding art worth preserving and thus continue to practice the style, working to achieve greater skill and refinement.

Sidesaddles may be used in almost every discipline, including show jumping. In the USA, the four main divisions in modern horse shows are Western, Hunt seat, Saddle seat (the two English divisions use the same basic style of saddle but different bridles and rider appointments), and &quot;historical,&quot; which may depict any culture or period, but must be fully researched and correctly utilized.

Although sidesaddles are still manufactured today, it is a small niche market, and a new sidesaddle is quite expensive. Thus most riders who wish to ride sidesaddle are often found hunting for older saddles at antique shops, estate sales, and in dusty barn lofts. It is difficult to find a sidesaddle that not only fits the rider and horse but also is in good condition. 

The sidesaddle has only one stirrup leather, and two pommels: the fixed pommel (sometimes called a &quot;horn&quot; or &quot;head&quot;) and the &quot;leaping horn&quot; or &quot;leaping head&quot;. Although there are some sidesaddles that lack a leaping horn, they are not considered safe by modern standards. Both pommels allow the rider to stay in place, even when jumping. In fact, it may be difficult for the rider to be thrown free should the horse fall. The vast majority of sidesaddles are designed so riders sit with both legs on the near (left) side of the horse, though occasionally a sidesaddle is found that is reversed and allows the rider to sit with their legs to the off (right) side. In spite of having both legs to the side of the horse, properly positioned riders sit on the horse facing forward, with their spine centered in the saddle perpendicular to that of the horse, with weight balanced equally on both buttocks.

The seat must be wide enough to accommodate the rider&#x27;s offside thigh as well as buttocks. A sidesaddle is comparatively flat from front to rear. Many have a small curved pommel and a long, raised cantle on the off side to support the offside thigh and to help riders keep their spine squared on the horse&#x27;s back. On some designs, the seat of the sidesaddle is angled away from the side on which the legs lie to help the weight of the rider remain centered over the horse&#x27;s back. The near-side flap is commonly cut forward to keep the rider&#x27;s right leg and foot from touching the horse&#x27;s left shoulder. The girthing of an English sidesaddle is usually a three-buckle system, with a usual full-length girth and an additional balancing girth. The stirrup of a sidesaddle is much shorter than in a conventional saddle, so that the rider&#x27;s knee is placed close to the leaping horn, and it buckles midway down the leather rather than close to the tree.

===Racing saddle===

The flat racing saddle is designed to not interfere with a running horse and to be as lightweight as possible (including the stirrup irons). The racing saddle has a very long seat without a dip to it, combined with extremely forward flaps that accommodate the very short stirrups and extreme forward seat used by jockeys. It also has a flat pommel and cantle so nothing interferes with the rider. Flat-racing saddles are built on a half-tree to reduce weight; because the rider spends most of the time up over the horse&#x27;s withers, there is no need for the protection to the horse&#x27;s spine that a full tree provides. The stirrups, instead of being looped over stirrup bars, are generally looped directly over the wooden bars of the half tree to prevent the loss of a stirrup during a race and to reduce bulk. This saddle provides very little security, placing the rider in a position that allows a horse the freedom of movement needed to achieve maximum speed, but at the cost of giving the rider less leverage to control the horse, and less protection for the horse&#x27;s back from a sitting rider. Therefore, racing saddles are not suited for general equestrian riding.

Most flat racing saddles weigh less than 1½ pounds; the lightest saddles weigh as little as 8 ounces. They generally have only one billet to attach the girth, and so an overgirth is usually added to keep it secure. Saddles used in steeplechases are generally slightly heavier and more substantial, usually being built on a full tree. Exercise saddles are usually larger and heavier, with a more prominent pommel and cantle to provide more security to the rider. Though these features add pounds, weight does not matter as it would in a race.

===Polo saddle===

The polo saddle is designed specifically for the mounted game. It has a relatively flat seat and the saddle flaps are long and fairly straight to accommodate the longer leg position, although more forward than the dressage saddle. 

One of the defining features of the polo saddle is that there is very little or no padding under the leg, allowing the rider to have maximum freedom of movement. If the saddle had thigh or calf blocks, the leg would not be allowed to swing forward or back as needed.

==Fitting the English saddle==
There are many factors to consider when fitting a saddle, and a professional saddle maker may be consulted to fit a saddle properly to a horse&#x27;s back. Incorrectly fitting saddles cause pressure points, which may result in bruising, soreness, and behavior problems under saddle. The saddle must also fit the rider, as security on the horse can be compromised when a saddle is the wrong size.

===Correct saddle placement===
Before fitting the saddle, it must be positioned correctly on the horse&#x27;s back. 

The points of the saddle tree at the front arch should give a full three-fingers width of clearance behind the shoulder blade when the horse is standing straight, or a hand&#x27;s width with the foreleg fully extended. This can be done by having someone on the ground pull each of the horse&#x27;s forelegs as far forward as possible, holding the leg at the knee, while another person checks the shoulder blade. 

The rider&#x27;s weight should be carried on the muscles that are over the horse&#x27;s ribs (from behind the shoulder blades to the last rib). The last rib of the horse should be found, and the saddle should &quot;not&quot; come behind it. 

Many riders put their saddles too far forward, especially those that use jumping saddles. A properly fitting saddle will &quot;find its own place&quot; when put on over the withers, and then slid back until it will not easily slide further. Even a well-fitting saddle will cause discomfort to the horse and position problems for the rider if it is placed too far forward, creating problems that include:

* Interference with the horse&#x27;s shoulder blades as it extends the forelegs, folds the legs over fences, or when the leading leg in canter or gallop is in the most rearward position (the top of the shoulder blade can move a full one and a half inches backwards from the standing position during canter and gallop). This also is damaging to the saddle, as it causes the tree to twist.
* Incorrect angle of the seat. When the saddle is too far forward the pommel rises up, tilting the cantle down and moving the seat back, so it is impossible for the rider to maintain a correct balanced position. This not only makes it extremely difficult for the rider to stay balanced, as they are constantly trying to scramble &quot;uphill,&quot; but also places the majority of weight close to the cantle, and hence on the horse&#x27;s loins.
* Harmful pressure areas because the tree points are more likely to dig into the withers. This causes extreme discomfort for the horse, and can produce bald spots and sores.
* Improper positioning of the girth too far forward, which can result in rubbing behind the elbows and lead to girth sores.
* The stirrup bars are placed forward of the natural drop of the stirrups, causing pressure from the rider&#x27;s feet to push them to go too far forward, resulting in a &quot;chair seat&quot; position, so that correct balance is very difficult.

Saddles that are placed too far back (a common error made by inexperienced riders first learning to saddle a horse), or saddles with a tree that is too long (for example, a horse-sized saddle placed on a pony) also cause problems for horse and rider, including:

* High risk the saddle will slip sideways. The horse&#x27;s barrel becomes wider and rounder the farther back it goes, and the withers also become lower before blending into the back altogether, leaving nothing to prevent the saddle from sliding.
* Pressure on the horse&#x27;s loins, which is not only uncomfortable for the animal, but may cause damage to the spinal column, particularly the lumbar vertebrae, which are not supported by the ribs.
* Pinching and pain in the loins and hips.
* Lack of balance by the rider in the saddle, as the rider will be perpetually behind the motion of the horse.
* Misbehavior by the horse due to discomfort.
* The pommel of the saddle will drop downwards, making the rider &#x27;slide downhill&#x27; in the saddle and increasing the risk of a fall over the shoulder.

===Fitting the horse===
A saddle must be measured for width, length, and front arch height (clearance over the withers). In ideal circumstances, the saddle is tried on the horse prior to purchase, or is purchased with a return option if it does not fit. When saddle shopping, or if having a saddle custom-made, one method of sizing the horse is known as a &quot;wither tracing.&quot; To create this, an artist&#x27;s flexicurve or a piece of coat hanger wire is placed up over the withers about two inches behind the horse&#x27;s shoulder blade, then shaped to fit across the withers. The shape is then traced onto heavy paper or cardboard. An average horse can be fitted with just this measurement by comparing the angle of the wither tracing to the angle of the piping at the front arch of the saddle. However, horses with an unusual shape are measured in three locations, the second measurement approximately two inches behind the first one, and the last measurement nine inches behind the withers. Often for accurate measurements, a professional saddle fitter may need to be consulted.

====Tree width====
The tree width, which dictates the width of the saddle and height of the gullet, is one of the most important factors when fitting the saddle, and can be tested easily by looking at the sweat pattern on the animal&#x27;s back after work. A tree that is too narrow is more of a threat than one too wide, as it pushes the points of the saddle tree into the horse&#x27;s back. This will often result in a hollowing if it persists for long periods of time. The sweat pattern will have even sweating along the panels, except for the points of the tree, which will cause round dry spots in the area of sweat, as a result from the pressure.

A saddle that is slightly too wide will not be as much of a problem. However, a saddle that is much too wide will not have adequate wither clearance, especially on a high-withered horse, causing pressure in this area. Too much pressure in the short term can lead to rubs and saddle sores, long-term problems may include damage to the thoracic vertebrae that make up the withers.

====Panels====
The panels need even pressure. The bearing surface of the panels should be as large and even as possible, within the confines of the saddle design. Poor flocking (stuffing) or pressure points from the saddle tree will decrease the bearing area. Uneven fit increases the pounds per square inch in a given area of the back, which can lead to soreness or even injury. 

Distribution of flocking can be tested by running the hands down the panels while applying slight pressure. If the panels are stuffed unevenly (one panel higher than the other, or stuffing that is hard and lumpy rather than smooth), the saddle will have pressure points and could cause soreness. A saddle fitter can check to make sure see if the panels are correctly stuffed for the horse. The front panels should have pressure evenly distributed down their front, which can be tested by saddling the horse, tightening the girth, running the hands down the front panels to feel for even pressure. The back panels should not rise off the horse&#x27;s back when it is ridden.

====Height of the gullet====
The saddle should provide adequate clearance for the spine and withers. With the horse&#x27;s heaviest rider sitting on the saddle, there should be at least three fingers width between the pommel and the withers, and when girthed up with a thin pad or no pad, it should be possible to look down the gullet and see light at the other end. The gap between the panels should also be about three inches wide all the way down, pommel to cantle, though heavily built animals may need four or more inches of width here to avoid pressure on the ligament over the spine.

===Fitting the rider===

The fit of the saddle to the rider is also critical, as a poorly fitting or badly designed saddle will disrupt the rider&#x27;s balance by either pushing the rider backwards, behind the horse&#x27;s center of balance, or lead to incorrect form as a way to compensate for a lack of balance in the saddle. Just as an athlete cannot perform their best if they have shoes that do not fit, even excellent riders have a difficult time riding well in a poorly balanced or ill-fitting saddle. Therefore, it is best to find a model that is comfortable and allows the rider to easily maintain the correct position. 

All English saddles are measured from the nailhead below the pommel to the center of the cantle. In the USA, English saddles, other than saddle seat styles, are manufactured in standard sizes for adult riders ranging from 16½ to 18 inches. Standard Saddle Seat sizes range from 19 inches to 21 inches. Most styles also manufacture proportionately smaller saddles for children. However, seat measurement is not a hard and fast way to determine if a saddle will fit a given rider. No two saddles are identical; there can be 1/4&quot; variation between saddles of different brands with the same size designation. Length of thigh often plays a greater role in selecting a proper seat size than does rider weight or hip width. As a rough rule of thumb, sizes 16½ and below (19&quot; for Saddle Seat) are generally for youth riders and smaller women. 17 and 17½ inch saddles are usually suitable for adult women of average size, with the 17 inch seat more suitable for shorter riders and the 17½ for those with a longer thigh (20&quot; and 21&quot; for Saddle Seat). 18 inch saddles are the most common size for adult men and larger women. (21&quot; for Saddle Seat, with larger custom sizes sometimes available). Saddles are also manufactured with different flap lengths to accommodate riders of different sizes.

Factors in saddle fit for a rider include the following:
* Pommel/Cantle height: the cantle should be slightly higher than the pommel, so the seat is not too far back (which would tip the rider backward and force the lower legs forward).
* Seat: the lowest part of the seat should also be the narrowest part of the saddle, the waist or twist, in order to balance the rider over the horse. When the rider is centered in the saddle, the length of the seat should allow about one hand&#x27;s width both behind the rider&#x27;s seat and in front of the pelvis. A saddle that is too small is uncomfortable to ride in and does not allow the rider the security provided by sitting deep in the saddle. A saddle that is too big does not provide any support for the rider and allows the seat to slide around too much. However, flap size and length of the rider&#x27;s thigh bone also influence the length of seat needed.
* Twist or Waist: the narrowest part of the saddle needs to fit the rider&#x27;s pelvic structure so that the seat bones properly support the rider. This varies by age, weight and gender. If either too wide or too narrow, considerable discomfort may result. Some saddle twists are designed more for the pelvic structure of men than for women and thus may be uncomfortable for the other gender.
* Saddle flap: with the stirrups at the appropriate riding length (which will differ according to experience and riding discipline), the knee should not come too far behind the flap (so the flaps do not provide any support), or too far in front (which will force the lower leg back and severely disrupt the balance of the rider.
* Position of the stirrup bars: The bars must be properly balanced under the saddle so that the rider is not put off balance when rising in the stirrups (such as when posting or jumping) Riders also should check that the stirrup bars are properly recessed and do not stick out in such a way that the buckles of the stirrup leathers will cause bruising or rubs on their legs. Finally, particularly with used saddles, the rider must verify that the safety release mechanism works properly to release a stirrup leather in the event a rider falls and is tangled in the stirrups.

===Consequences of poor fit===
Long term, poor saddle fit may cause multiple back problems for the horse. It is possible for the horse&#x27;s topline muscles to deteriorate, or for the horse to develop the wrong muscles. The muscles of the back just rear of the withers may atrophy, causing hollows right behind the shoulders, giving the withers the appearance of being higher and sharper. Horses may also lose muscle tone from traveling with a hollowed back, leading to increased risk of lordosis (&quot;swayback&quot;), kissing spines, or pinched nerves. For riders, spending long hours in a poorly fitting saddle may result in lower back pain as a consequence of incorrect pelvic angle. Saddles that are too small may also cause discomfort if the rider&#x27;s seat is pushed into contact with the pommel.

Evidence of a saddle with a poor fit include:

* Sore back or &quot;cold&quot; back
* Hollowing of the back, raising the head, and tensing the jaw against the bit while under saddle
* General stiffness or one-sidedness, shown by a reluctance to take one lead over the other at the canter or reluctance to turn in one or both directions
* Shortness of stride
* Unwillingness to work, including &quot;napping&quot; or &quot;balking&quot; (refusal to go forward), Bucking, rearing, bolting, or overall sour attitude
* Uneven wear on the hooves
* Reluctance to be saddled, exhibited by fidgeting, tooth grinding, biting or kicking).
* Intermittent or unexplained lameness
* Uneven sweat or dirt pattern under the saddle after a workout, particularly dry spots in an area that should normally be sweaty. For example, two dry spots just behind the withers on either side of the back are indicative of either excess pressure causing reduced circulation. Dry spots in the center of the back may indicate &quot;bridging&quot; of the saddle - no contact with the back in a location where the saddle should be in contact. Riding with a white cloth under the saddle is used as a diagnostic tool to make uneven patterns more visible.
* Rub marks under the saddle. The hair may become sweaty, but shouldn&#x27;t be roughed up to the point it lays sideways or backwards to its direction of growth. Roughened hair may indicate either rubbing and instability due to poor fit, or it may be due to improper saddle placement (particularly putting the saddle on too far back and pushing it forward, pulling the hair the wrong direction).
* In extreme cases, open sores or patches of white hairs (from death of cells due to abnormal pressure) sometimes called &quot;saddle marks.&quot;

==Places of manufacture==
English saddles are made in many places around the world. A traditional manufacturing centre is in Walsall, England. Other countries that produce fine English saddles are Ireland, France, Germany, Australia, Italy, Switzerland, Canada and the United States. Argentina produces many English saddles, particularly for the polo market, as well as a large number of brands that are in the mid-range of prices for other disciplines. The least expensive saddles are usually manufactured in India and can vary tremendously in quality of both workmanship and leather.

<doc id="905483" wikidata="Q128855" url="?curid=905483" title="Chopper (film)">
<text>Chopper is a 2000 Australian crime drama film written and directed by Andrew Dominik, in his feature directorial debut, based on the autobiographical books by the criminal turned author Mark &quot;Chopper&quot; Read. The film stars Eric Bana as the title character and co-stars Vince Colosimo, Simon Lyndon, Kate Beahan and David Field. The film follows Read&#x27;s life and time in prison. The film grossed A$6.8 million worldwide and received positive reviews. It has since garnered a cult following.

==Plot==
In 1978 Victoria, Mark &quot;Chopper&quot; Read is an inmate at Pentridge Prison. Keithy George, another inmate, points to a line in the yard and tells Mark not to cross the line as it marks the Painters and Dockers territory. The next day, Mark rushes across the line and stabs Keithy multiple times.

The Painters and Dockers put out a $10,000 contract on Mark. Mark conscripts Bluey Barnes and Jimmy Loughnan to help him lead a siege on the Painters and Dockers. Wanting out of the suicide mission, Jimmy shanks Mark. Jimmy slashes his own arm so that he can claim self-defense. Mark recovers and is returned to a separate cell from Bluey and Jimmy. It is revealed that Mark is serving a 16 ½ year sentence for the attempted abduction of a judge in order to give Jimmy Loughnan freedom.

Mark meets with the prison board to negotiate a change of prisons for security. The board declines, so Mark has his ears cut off so that he can relocate to a mental health wing where he serves the remainder of his sentence.

When Mark is released from prison, he reunites with his old girlfriend Tanya. While out at a club, Mark flies into a jealous rage and fires several shots with a handgun. Back at Tanya’s house, Mark finds her on the phone with Neville Bartos (Vince Colosimo). He physically abuses both Tanya and her mother. 
Mark goes to Neville’s house and learns that Neville supplies most of the cocaine to the western suburbs of Melbourne and is very wealthy. When Neville refuses to give Mark money, Mark shoots him in the abdomen.

Mark goes to Jimmy Loughnan’s apartment that he shares with his pregnant fiancée, Mandy, and their young daughter. Mark reveals that he’s working for the police, stating that he has a green light to shoot criminals and that he shot Neville. Mark tells Jimmy that he heard about the contracts out on his life and that Jimmy was meant to do them, and then holds a gun to Jimmy’s head. Eventually, Mark apologises and gives money to Jimmy.

In a car park at the Bojangles, Sammy the Turk, another affiliate, states that he wants to show Mark something. Mark produces a sawed-off .410 shotgun and after a brief argument, Mark shoots him in the eye. Mandy witnesses the murder from behind a parked car and tells Jimmy.

Mandy turns crown witness against Mark for the murder of Sammy the Turk. It’s revealed that Sammy took Mark out to the car park for Jimmy to cash in on the contract against Mark, but unknowingly took him to the wrong car park. Mark beats the murder charge but is convicted of malicious wounding of Neville Bartos, and is sentenced to 5 years.

==Cast==
==Production==
Read himself suggested that Bana play him, after seeing the actor in the sketch comedy series &quot;Full Frontal&quot;. Bana spent two days living with Read to help him practice for the role, and many of Read&#x27;s friends, enemies, and old associates were interviewed. Several of Bana&#x27;s meetings with Read can be viewed in the DVD special features.

The biggest production difficulty was being allowed to use the Pentridge Prison in Coburg, Victoria, for the shooting. The prison was being closed down and while the negotiations were underway, the funding for production was delayed. This put off the start of the shoot. Some extras were hired from former inmates and tattoo parlours.

To show the sterility of the prison and to contrast it with the world that Chopper encounters after leaving prison 16 years later, the production was split into two. The first part, filmed at the H Division of Pentridge Prison, one of the actual prisons that Chopper frequented, was as plain and sterile as could be and all the scenes in the second part, taking place in 1986, were overly coloured to achieve a paranoid and agoraphobic atmosphere called &quot;visual overload&quot; by the director Andrew Dominik. This was attained by lighting, choice of film stock used, and colours chosen for set decoration. Part one of the production ran from 3 May until 26 May with part two continuing from 28 June until 21 July 2000. The month-long break enabled Bana to put on the extra weight necessary to play the older Read.

==Reception==
&quot;Chopper&quot; was received with positive reviews. Review-based rating site Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a 76% &quot;fresh&quot; rating from 80 critics, with its critical consensus stating &quot;Eric Bana&#x27;s performance as the charming but twisted Chopper is the highlight of this disturbing portrait of Australia&#x27;s notorious author/criminal.&quot;

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 stars out of 4, praising Bana for his performance, saying, &quot;He has a quality no acting school can teach and few actors can match.&quot; Margaret Pomeranz for SBS gave the film four-and-a-half stars out of five, commenting that what Dominik &quot;achieved is extraordinary.&quot; David Stratton, in the same review, remarked &quot;There&#x27;s no doubting the intelligence of Andrew Dominik&#x27;s direction&quot; and declared Bana&#x27;s performance as &quot;astonishing.&quot;

Read later praised Bana&#x27;s performance on the &quot;20 to 1&quot; episode &quot;Great Aussie Films&quot;, where &quot;Chopper&quot; came 17th.

===Box office===
&quot;Chopper&quot; grossed A$300,000 in previews before becoming the number one film in Australia with a gross of A$1.8 million in its opening week. It went on to gross A$5,912,119 in Australia It grossed US$0.2 million in the United States and Canada and US$0.3 million in other territories for a worldwide total of A$6.8 million.

<text>Access Hollywood, formerly known as Access from 2017 to 2019, is an American weekday television entertainment news program that premiered on September 9, 1996. It covers events and celebrities in the entertainment industry. It was created by former &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; executive producer Jim Van Messel and is currently executive produced by Maureen FitzPatrick and directed by Richard Plotkin. In previous years, Doug Dougherty, Christopher A. Berry and Kim Anastasia directed the program. &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; primarily focuses on news in the music, television, and film industries.

==History==
&quot;Access Hollywood&quot; has aired nationally on various local stations, most of them affiliates of NBC, in the United States since September 9, 1996. It was previously produced by NBC Studios and has changed distributors over the years, first with New World/Genesis Distribution, then 20th Television (after News Corporation bought New World), followed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution who still distributes the show today via barter ad-sales, and then to NBC Enterprises when the network started up its own syndication division. Today, NBCUniversal Television Distribution, in association with NBC&#x27;s owned-and-operated station KNBC has been solely responsible for its production and distribution since 2004. Warner Bros. continues its involvement with the program by having responsibilities for barter ad sales for &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;.

On September 13, 2010, &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; began broadcasting in high definition. On May 1, 2012, NBCUniversal Television Distribution announced it would renew &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; for three additional years through the 2014–15 season.

The program changed its name to simply Access on December 11, 2017.

On August 22, 2019, it was officially announced that &quot;Access&quot; and &quot;Access Live&quot; would receive an on-air refresh for their 24th and 10th seasons, respectively, with new names, logos, graphics and theme music, starting on September 9. &quot;Access&quot; returned to its original &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; name and begin airing live in the East Coast, with &quot;Access Live&quot; also rebranding as Access Daily. The program also debuted a second spin-off in the fall entitled All Access — which featured long-form reports on true-crime and human interest stories and aired initially on six NBC owned-and-operated stations. Former &quot;Extra&quot; host Mario Lopez also joined all three programs as co-host. It aired its last episode in June 2021.

On April 12, 2021, &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Access Daily&quot; renewed for a three additional seasons through 2025. In 2024, they were renewed through 2026.

===&quot;Access Across America&quot;===
In 2005, &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; went on a month-long roadtrip called &quot;Access Across America&quot; while the studio underwent a major overhaul. The show&#x27;s new set was done in pastel colors with a modern flair, separating its look from other similar shows, including rival &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;. The new look also included a brand-new graphics package. &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; was taped at Studio 1 at The Burbank Studios (formerly NBC Studios) in Burbank, California, former home of &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. With &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, it was one of two remaining NBC-produced programs as of 2014 originating from Burbank; On 2015 &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; moved to Universal City, California and Universal Studios Hollywood as NBC&#x27;s operations continued to combine in Universal City.

==Spin-offs==
The program has had some short-lived spin-offs in the last few years, including &quot;AMC Access&quot; for the AMC channel, and &quot;Real Access&quot; (the first teen-oriented entertainment news program, and the only attempt so far at an entertainment news program aimed at teens on television) for The N and Nickelodeon. The network most recently produced the African-American oriented &quot;TV One Access&quot; for the TV One cable channel. The programs formerly did entertainment segments for NBCUniversal&#x27;s cable news channel titled &quot;Access MSNBC&quot;, though these have been withdrawn as MSNBC&#x27;s news coverage has become mainly political.

===&quot;Access Daily with Mario &amp; Kit&quot;===
A spin-off of &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, called &quot;Access Hollywood Live&quot;, debuted on September 13, 2010. The daytime talk show - currently hosted by Mario Lopez and Kit Hoover, features entertainment news stories and in-studio guests. The program was initially seen only on NBC owned-and-operated stations in six markets and Fox owned-and-operated stations in six other major markets, all on stations that already carry the flagship series; since September 2011, the program also began being distributed to non-network owned stations that also carry the flagship series. The show airs live at 11:00 am Eastern Time (8:00 am in Los Angeles where the studios are located). The show changed its name to &quot;Access Live&quot; on December 11, 2017, and again to &quot;Access Daily&quot; on September 9, 2019. In 2022, the show was renamed &quot;Access Daily with Mario &amp; Kit&quot; and Evans was no longer a co-host but still with the show as a correspondent.

&quot;Access Daily&quot; was originally recorded at The Burbank Studios in Burbank, California; it currently broadcasts from 10 Universal City Plaza in Universal City, California, where it has been recorded since June 2015. On occasion, the program broadcasts shows on location outside Studio 1A on the Today plaza at Rockefeller Center in New York City. On May 1, 2012, along with &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;&#x27;s renewal for three additional seasons, NBCUniversal Television Distribution announced it would give &quot;Access Hollywood Live&quot; a third season renewal for the 2012–13 season. On April 12, 2021, the show renewed for a three additional seasons through 2025. In June 2024, the show was renewed through 2026.

===&quot;All Access&quot;===
A second spin-off, entitled, All Access premiered on September 9, 2019, and featured long-form reports on true-crime and human interest stories and aired initially on six NBC owned-and-operated stations. The show was hosted by Mario Lopez, Kit Hoover and Scott Evans with Sibley Scoles as correspondent. On October 2, 2019, Zuri Hall joined as co-host. On March 11, 2021, it was announced that the show had been canceled and the last episode would air in June.

== International versions &amp; airings ==
In Canada, Rogers Sports &amp; Media&#x27;s Omni Television airs the United States version of &quot;Access Live&quot; while Independent station CHCH-DT began airing the half hour weekday United States version in fall 2014; Bell Media channel CTV 2 used to air the half hour weekday United States version since fall 2011 but it was discontinued in 2013.

The United Kingdom version began in 2003 hosted by Kate Garraway and Vincent.

There was a short-lived Irish version on Channel 6 (now Virgin Media Two), hosted by Jenny Buckley in 2006.

==Spoofs==
* The show was parodied in the show &quot;Arthur&quot; in the special &quot;Arthur, It&#x27;s Only Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot; when a spoof named &quot;Access Elwood&quot; interviewed the band U Stink.
* In the &quot;South Park&quot; episode &quot;Free Hat&quot;, a show airs called &quot;Excess Hollywood&quot; with a look-alike of then host Pat O&#x27;Brien.
* The show is also parodied in the sitcom &quot;BoJack Horseman&quot; as &quot;Excess Hollywood&quot;, later renamed to &quot;Excess &quot; after BoJack steals the D from the Hollywood Sign.
* Craig Ferguson often parodied &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; on &quot;The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson&quot; in a segment called &quot;Access Extratainment Tonight&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;Access Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Extra&quot; and &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;) with Ferguson as &quot;Barney Slash&quot;.
* In &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot;, the show is mentioned in an argument between Homer and Marge Simpson.
* In &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Hello Gutter, Hello Fadder&quot;, when (then) hosts Pat O&#x27;Brien &amp; Nancy O&#x27;Dell guest star as hosts of &quot;Access Springfield&quot;.

He achieved international fame as the lead guitarist of the rock band X Japan from 1987 to 1997 and rose to prominence in Asia as a solo artist from 1993 to 1998, until his death. He also formed the United States–based rock supergroup Zilch in 1996.

Hide sold millions of records, both solo and as a member of X Japan. X Japan rose to prominence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, credited as founders of the Japanese visual kei movement. When they disbanded in 1997, he focused on his solo career which started four years prior and went on to enjoy significant popularity. At the height of his fame, while recording his third studio album and about to launch an international career with the newly formed Zilch, he died in 1998 of what was ruled a suicide by hanging. He was seen as an icon for Japanese youth rebelling against their country&#x27;s conformist society, and his death was labeled &quot;the end of an era&quot;.

==Life and career==

===1964–1987: Early years and Saber Tiger===
Hideto Matsumoto was born at St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital in Midorigaoka, Japan, on December 13, 1964, and went on to attend Yokosuka Tokiwa Junior High School. He was first exposed to rock music at the age of fifteen, through the album &quot;Alive II&quot; by Kiss. That same year his grandmother bought him his first electric guitar, a Gibson Les Paul Deluxe.

On March 11, 1980, Hide graduated from Tokiwa Junior High School. He then entered Zushi Kaisei Senior High School in Zushi, Kanagawa, where he entered the school&#x27;s brass band as a club activity. He quit the band after a short time because he was assigned the clarinet while he wanted to play the trumpet. After this, he concentrated on guitar and in 1981 formed the band Saber Tiger. A year after their founding, they started playing shows at live houses in Yokosuka, such as Rock City. Their live performances featured shock elements such as mannequins and raw meat.

In April 1983 he started studying cosmetology and fashion at the Hollywood University of Beauty and Fashion in present-day Roppongi Hills, from which he graduated in 1985. Later that year he took a nationwide examination and successfully obtained a beautician license. In July 1985 Saber Tiger released their self-titled EP, which included two songs, &quot;Double Cross&quot; and &quot;Gold Digger&quot;. In November, the band contributed the song &quot;Vampire&quot; to the &quot;Heavy Metal Force III&quot; sampler, which also included songs by X.

In 1986 the group changed its name to Saver Tiger to avoid confusion with a similarly named band from Sapporo. Their first appearance with the new name was on the sampler &quot;Devil Must Be Driven out with Devil&quot;, with their songs &quot;Dead Angle&quot; and &quot;Emergency Express&quot;. They continued to perform in live houses and night clubs such as Meguro Rokumeikan, Omiya Freaks and Meguro Live Station until January 28, 1987, when Hide became tired of changing members and decided to end the band (vocalist Kyo and drummer Tetsu would both go on to D&#x27;erlanger), around the same time he was invited to join X. In 2001, Nippon Crown issued a three-volume release titled &quot;Origin of hide&quot;, with the band credited as &quot;Yokosuka Saver Tiger&quot;. Volumes 1 and 2 were live CDs, with some rehearsal recordings, while volume 3 was a concert VHS.

===1987–1997: X Japan===
Hide joined X in February 1987, becoming the band&#x27;s lead guitarist and occasional songwriter. X released their first album &quot;Vanishing Vision&quot; through drummer Yoshiki&#x27;s own Extasy Records on April 14, 1988, and toured extensively in support of the record. They would become one of the first Japanese acts to achieve mainstream success while on an independent label, and were later widely credited as one of the pioneers of visual kei.

X&#x27;s major label debut album, &quot;Blue Blood&quot;, was released on April 21, 1989, and debuted at number six on the Oricon chart. Its success earned the band the &quot;Grand Prix New Artist of the Year&quot; award at the 4th annual Japan Gold Disc Awards in 1990. Their third album &quot;Jealousy&quot; was released on July 1, 1991, and debuted at number one, selling over 600,000 copies. It was later certified million by the RIAJ.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Art of Life&quot;, which also topped the Oricon, the members of X Japan took a break, to start solo projects. Around that time, the group also dropped most of its original visual kei aesthetics, except Hide who would still perform in wildly colorful outfits and with his trademark red, later pink, hair. &quot;Dahlia&quot;, which would become the band&#x27;s final album to date, was released on November 4, 1996, and once again, it reached the number one spot. In September 1997 it was announced that X Japan would disband, they performed their farewell show, aptly titled &quot;The Last Live&quot;, at the Tokyo Dome on December 31, 1997.

===1993–1998: Solo career===
In early 1993, Hide recorded the &quot;cyborg rock&quot; song &quot;Frozen Bug&quot; with Inoran and J of Luna Sea under the band name M*A*S*S; it was included on the sampler &quot;Dance 2 Noise 004&quot;. He also starred in an art film titled &quot;Seth et Holth&quot;, along with Tusk of . In 1994, he recorded and released his first solo album &quot;Hide Your Face&quot;, which reached number 9 on the Oricon chart. The album&#x27;s musical style differed significantly from the speed metal anthems and power ballads of X Japan, leaning more towards alternative rock. He then went on the Hide Our Psychommunity Tour, for which a live band was hired that would later become his primary project, Hide with Spread Beaver.

In 1996, Hide oversaw the production of the first release on his own record label LEMONed, an album from the band Zeppet Store. Prior to starting his own label, Hide would introduce bands he liked to Yoshiki, who then signed them to Extasy Records, as he had done with Zi:Kill, Luna Sea and Glay. Oblivion Dust also credits early support from Hide for them getting a record deal. Hide&#x27;s second solo album &quot;Psyence&quot; was released on September 2, it topped the Oricon and was followed by the Psyence a Go Go tour. He also formed a new band named Zilch in 1996, which apart from him and Spread Beaver programmer and percussionist I.N.A., was composed of American and British artists, such as Joey Castillo (Danzig), Paul Raven (Killing Joke) and Ray McVeigh (ex-The Professionals). After X Japan disbanded in 1997, he formally titled his solo project Hide with Spread Beaver, with his backing band considered full members. On August 26, 1997, he produced the Mix LEMONed Jelly event at four different Tokyo nightclubs on the same night.

==Death==
Hide died at age 33 on the morning of May 2, 1998. After a night out drinking, he was found hanged by a towel tied to a doorhandle in his apartment in the Minami-Azabu district of Tokyo. He had returned to Japan just five days earlier, after a three-month stay in Los Angeles. On May 1, he and the members of Spread Beaver recorded for television shows and went out drinking, with his younger brother driving him home at roughly 6:30am the following morning. When found unconscious at around 7:30am, he was rushed to Japanese Red Cross Medical Center in Hiroo, where he was pronounced dead at 8:52am by Japanese Red Cross Medical Center.

Authorities officially deemed Hide&#x27;s death a suicide, and it was reported in the media as such. Within one week, three teenage fans had died in copycat suicides. At the wake on May 6, which 10,000 people attended, a 19-year-old girl slit her wrists after laying flowers at the temple, and a car crash caused by sleep-deprived fans traveling from Osaka caused one death and seven serious injuries on a motorway. His remains were buried in Miura Reien in Miura, Kanagawa during a Buddhist memorial service. Approximately 50,000 people attended his funeral at Tsukiji Hongan-ji on May 7, where 56 people were hospitalized and 197 people received medical treatment in first aid tents due to a mixture of emotional exhaustion and heat, with the funeral taking place on the warmest day of the year so far, at 27 degrees Celsius (about 80.6 degrees Fahrenheit).

Several of Hide&#x27;s friends and colleagues stated that they believed the auto-strangulation to have been an accident, among them X Japan co-founder Yoshiki and former X bassist Taiji. No suicide note was left and Taiji theorizes in his autobiography that on the night of his death, Hide may have been practicing a technique to relieve upper back and neck pains which guitarists can suffer from due to continuous use of a shoulder strap. The technique involved was practiced by the X Japan members during their touring days and required the use of a towel and a doorknob or handle. According to Taiji, Hide may have fallen asleep in his intoxicated state, becoming caught and strangling himself.

Zilch bassist Paul Raven said, &quot;I saw him a few days before he passed away, and I had no indication from him that anything was wrong, other than that he was exhausted,&quot; but commented that Hide was &quot;under a lot of stress,&quot; due to the recording schedule for the &quot;Ja, Zoo&quot; album. He went on to question the ultimate degree of Hide&#x27;s involvement in the finished record, remarking that only three songs had been completed before he died. However, Hide&#x27;s younger brother and manager stated in his 2010 book that six songs were completed by the time of his death. This is supported by the fact that I.N.A. is credited with additional arrangement on four of the album&#x27;s ten tracks.

==Posthumous==

===1998–2010===
Later that month after his passing, the single &quot;Pink Spider&quot; was released, entering the Oricon chart at number one. The song was also named &quot;Song of the Year&quot; at the 13th Japan Gold Disc Awards and received the MTV Video Music Award in the category &quot;Japan Viewers Choice&quot;. Sales were also strong for the follow-up single &quot;Ever Free&quot; which took its number one spot, while those of the single released prior to his death &quot;Rocket Dive&quot; would also see a substantial increase. American Journalist Neil Strauss commented on the trend saying that: &quot;In just a few weeks, pop culture in Japan had gone from mourning Hide&#x27;s death to consuming it.&quot;

Zilch&#x27;s debut album &quot;3.2.1.&quot; was released in July and reached number 2 on the Oricon chart, the group would continue to perform and record for several years. While they never achieved mainstream success in the United States one of their songs was included on the soundtrack for &quot;Heavy Metal 2000&quot;. &quot;Ja, Zoo&quot; was released in November of that year with the artist listed as &#x27;hide with Spread Beaver&#x27;, formally crediting his backing band, also reached the number 2 position and sold over a million copies by the end of the following year. Despite Hide&#x27;s death, Spread Beaver went through with the 1998 Tribal Ja, Zoo Tour from October through November, performing live with the addition of recordings, drawing an audience of 50,000 people. Footage from the tour was later released on DVD in 2005.

On May 1, 1999, a tribute album was released, titled &quot;Tribute Spirits&quot;. It features covers of Hide&#x27;s songs by several bands such as Buck-Tick, Luna Sea and Oblivion Dust, and solo artists including Tomoyasu Hotei and Cornelius. The album was released to coincide with the first anniversary of his death.

A Hide museum was opened in his hometown of Yokosuka on July 20, 2000. It has been reported that Japan&#x27;s Prime Minister at the time, Junichiro Koizumi, was influential in getting it built as he is a big fan of X Japan. The museum remained open, past its original three-year plan, for five years, before closing its doors on September 25, 2005, with an estimated 400,000 people visiting.

Prior to his death, Hide and Yoshiki talked about restarting X Japan with a new vocalist in the year 2000. The surviving members of X Japan eventually reunited in 2007 and recorded a new song, &quot;I.V.&quot;. It contains a previously unused guitar track by hide. Their first concert was held at the Tokyo Dome on March 28, 2008, during the performance of &quot;Art of Life&quot; a hologram of Hide (taken from footage of an &quot;Art of Life&quot; performance at the Tokyo Dome in 1993) played alongside the band. X Japan still considers Hide a member, and have introduced him at every concert they have performed since reuniting.
As far back as July 8, 2007, Yoshiki announced to be in talks with several musicians regarding a Hide tribute concert set for 2008, in order to commemorate the tenth anniversary of his former bandmate&#x27;s death. The Hide memorial summit was held on May 3 and 4 2008 at Ajinomoto Stadium, with X Japan, Dir En Grey, D&#x27;espairsRay, Versailles and many others performing, Luna Sea and Phantasmagoria even reunited for one day to perform. Hide with Spread Beaver also performed, using studio and live recordings for Hide&#x27;s vocals. Organizers planned for an estimated 100,000 fans to attend the two shows. Prior to the summit, there had been tribute shows held every year since 2000, where bands performed on Hide&#x27;s birthday and this continues to this day.

As with many other deceased musicians, re-issues, remixes, compilations and previously unreleased portions of Hide&#x27;s work continue to be published. One of the most recent being &quot;The Devolution Project&quot;, a release of his original eleven singles on picture disc vinyl, throughout 2010. On the 12th anniversary of his death, also in 2010, a memorial service was held at Tsukiji Hongan-ji with an estimated 35,000 people attending.

In August 2010, Hide&#x27;s management company Headwax Organization, which includes his younger brother Hiroshi, filed a lawsuit against Yoshiki&#x27;s management Japan Music Agency, for using images of the former X Japan guitarist without a formal agreement in place. The claim states that in 2000 the two companies signed an agreement allowing Yoshiki and X Japan to use visual images of Hide during concerts. However, images were used at X Japan&#x27;s August 14 and 15 shows at Nissan Stadium, when apparently the contract had expired.

===Since 2011===
On March 8, 2011, a jukebox musical based on and featuring Hide&#x27;s music debuted, named &quot;Pink Spider&quot; after his song of the same name. Hide had previously expressed his desire to make a&quot;rock opera&quot;, and said that the story of &quot;Pink Spider&quot; is not finished in the single, it remains open, and the musical aims to follow this thought thread. The show stars both Nao Minamisawa and Hitomi Takahashi as Meru, a girl who likes rock music, struggling between the real world and a fictional one called Psychocommunity. Other cast members included Taka (defspiral) and J, with the backing band being the rest of defspiral. The production ran from March 8 to the 27 at the Tokyo Globe Theater and was then brought to Fukuoka, Kobe, Nagoya, Niigata, Sendai, and Sapporo in April. The musical production was overseen by I.N.A. A compilation album of the songs used in the musical (the original versions by hide) was released on March 2 and is titled &quot;&quot;Musical Number&quot; -Rock Musical Pink Spider-&quot;.

At the end of 2012, a special project titled Hide Rocket Dive 2013~2014 ~20th Solo Works &amp; 50th of Birth Anniversary was announced. It includes films shown in several locations on May 2, including some overseas, the re-opening of the Hide museum and plans to hold another Hide memorial summit festival. Two tribute albums, following the first in 1999, were released on July 3, 2013, and contain twenty-five tracks covered by newer visual kei acts such as heidi., Sadie, Matenrou Opera and Screw. Two more tribute albums were released on August 28, the first being covers of Hide&#x27;s songs in a classical music theme, and the latter his song&#x27;s remixed by Spread Beaver member INA. Two additional tribute albums were released on December 18 as the final installments, one composed of covers by female recording artists such as Koda Kumi and Kanon Wakeshima, and the other by rock acts including D&#x27;erlanger and Kinniku Shōjo Tai. The Hide Museum 2013 was in Odaiba from June 27 to July 28, when it moved to Universal Studios Japan in Osaka for August 7 to September 8. The exhibition include life size wax dolls of hide. The new live concert film &quot;hide Alive the Movie -hide Indian Summer Special Limited Edition-&quot; was shown in theaters throughout Japan. Special limited tickets to see the movie came with a thirteen-track live CD of songs from the depicted concert, which was recorded on September 8, 1996, at Chiba Marine Stadium.

In March 2013, Headwax Organization announced that Hide&#x27;s grave site at Miura Reien was vandalized when unknown suspect(s) scratched the gravestone with a sharp object. They stated that if additional acts occur, the grave would be temporarily closed to the public. Hide &quot;performed&quot; with Super Band, a one-off band whose lineup altered per song, at Sodegaura Kaihin Koen on September 14, 2013, as part of Kishidan Banpaku 2013 hosted by Kishidan. Its members included J on bass, Hisashi Imai and Hisashi on guitar, Ken Morioka on keyboards, and Tetsu (D&#x27;erlanger) on drums. A previously unfinished song by Hide called has been completed by Yamaha and INA utilizing vocaloid technology to mimic the deceased musician&#x27;s voice. The song was originally written and demoed for &quot;Ja, Zoo&quot; in 1998, took two years to finish and was included on an album by Universal Music released on December 10, 2014.

&quot;Junk Story&quot;, a theatrical documentary on Hide that includes interviews with friends, staff and fellow musicians who knew him, entered theaters across Japan on May 23, 2015. Hide with Spread Beaver performed on October 15, 2016, at Makuhari Messe alongside X Japan and Glay as part of the second day of the Visual Japan Summit. A special Hide 20th Memorial Super Live Spirits was held at Tokyo Otaiba Yagai Tokusetsu Stage J Chikuon on April 28 and 29, 2018. In addition to Hide with Spread Beaver on both nights, other acts that performed over the two days included Buck-Tick, Oblivion Dust, Mucc and Tomoyasu Hotei. A multimedia box set titled &quot;hide 1998 ~Last Words~&quot; and containing five CDs, a DVD and two books was released on May 2. All conducted within the last few months of his life, the CDs contain radio interviews Hide gave on Nippon Broadcasting System and Bay FM 78, the DVD contains footage shot in Los Angeles while recording &quot;Ja, Zoo&quot;, and the books republish interviews he gave to magazines such as &quot;Rockin&#x27;On Japan&quot; and &quot;Fool&#x27;s Mate&quot;. On May 26, a documentary film titled &quot;Hurry Go Round&quot; was released in theaters. Another tribute album titled &quot;Tribute Impulse&quot; was released on June 6 and features acts such as Dragon Ash, Takanori Nishikawa and Miyavi.

Using the 2010 book by Hide&#x27;s brother Hiroshi and I.N.A.&#x27;s 2018 book as sources, Renpei Tsukamoto wrote and directed the live-action film about how Hiroshi and I.N.A. struggled to finish and release Hide&#x27;s music after his death in 1998. Released on July 8, 2022, in addition to Tsubasa Imai as Hiroshi, actual musicians were cast for the roles of Hide and the members of Spread Beaver; Juon of the band Fuzzy Control as Hide, Takashi Tsukamoto as I.N.A., Naoki Kawano as Joe, Sex Machineguns bassist Shingo☆ as Chirolyn, Orito Kasahara as Kiyoshi, Yuuki Kubo as D.I.E., and Masato Kataoka as K.A.Z. I.N.A. mixed live recordings from the 1998 Tribal Ja, Zoo Tour for use in the film. Four of them were released digitally as &quot;hide with Spread Beaver Appear!! &quot;1998 Tribal Ja,Zoo&quot; (Live) 2022 Mix&quot; on July 6. In 2023, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Hide&#x27;s solo debut and the 25th anniversary of his death, Hide with Spread Beaver reunited for their first one-man lives in 21 years. They performed at Zepp Osaka Bayside on April 29, Kanagawa Kenmin Hall on May 2, and Toyosu Pit on July 27. They are scheduled to perform two one-man lives at the Tokyo Metropolitan Gymnasium on May 2 and 3, 2025, as part of celebrations to commemorate what would have been Hide&#x27;s 60th birthday.

==Personal life==
Hide&#x27;s younger brother Hiroshi was his chauffeur and manager until his last days. Hiroshi has a son whom, during the Hide Our Psychommunity Tour, Hide would bring onstage and sing to. Hiroshi is the president of Hide&#x27;s management company Headwax Organization, and also appears on &quot;Ja, Zoo&quot; reading an excerpt on &quot;Pink Cloud Assembly&quot;.

During an interview for the television show &quot;Rocket Punch!&quot;, recorded on May 1, 1998, Hide said he had a girlfriend. The identity of this girlfriend was never confirmed, as Hide died the following day.

==Musicianship==

===Musical style===
Hide was influenced by hard rock bands such as Iron Maiden, AC/DC and Bow Wow as well as punk rock acts such as The Clash and Sex Pistols. However, Kiss guitarist Ace Frehley was his idol and biggest influence. He preferred guitarists who make playing look &quot;effortless&quot; and who have &quot;the skill, the looks and the attitude&quot;, naming Frehley, Jimmy Page and Joe Perry. He cited Bauhaus&#x27; guitarist Daniel Ash as an influence as well. Hide cited Iron Maiden&#x27;s self-titled debut album for teaching him how to arrange twin guitar parts.

In X Japan, Hide is the second most credited songwriter to Yoshiki, and appears to have been the most experimental as well. The song &quot;Xclamation&quot; from 1989&#x27;s &quot;Blue Blood&quot;, co-composed with Taiji, included traditional Indian percussion; &quot;Scars&quot;, a single written by Hide from 1996&#x27;s &quot;Dahlia&quot;, was a glimpse into his future experiments in industrial rock, according to Alexey Eremenko of AllMusic. &quot;The Japan Times&quot;″s Philip Brasor commented that when Hide died, &quot;Japanese metal lost its greatest practicing innovator.&quot;

At the outset of his solo career, Hide experimented with instrumentations very different from what he usually had access to in X Japan. The &quot;Hide Your Face&quot; opening track &quot;Psychommunity&quot;, for example, has four guitar tracks and employs a full string section. As another example, &quot;Blue Sky Complex&quot; features guitars in drop C tuning, a trumpet section, and an organ. His solo music is also of genres uncharacteristic of X, with the bulk of his catalog being considered alternative rock. These works included influences ranging from pop rock to industrial rock.
His lyrics were often dark, with one TV host saying &quot;A lot of what Hide did was grotesque. He&#x27;s talked about suicide in his records for five years. But the fans who followed him always knew there was a Hide behind that who was a very solid character. He was very outspoken about freedom and doing what you want&quot;. His compositions &quot;often set the tone of alienation and frustration for which X Japan was revered.&quot; Radio and TV host Bryan Burton-Lewis explained &quot;In Japan, the image that we have of the X audience is rural kids going through a rebellion phase&quot;, &quot;they all talk about how [hide] gave them something to live for.&quot; Japanese DJ Maki Yanai believes fans saw in him the rebel society would not allow them to be.

===Equipment===
Hide was a fan of Bow Wow guitarists Kyoji Yamamoto and Mitsuhiro Saito, and played the Mockingbird style guitar, which Saito used. Hide was rarely seen performing without a Fernandes guitar. He has many signature models with the company and owned a large repertoire of guitars by other manufacturers. His numerous signature models are still available for purchase today. One of his guitars, a 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard, was once owned by Mick Mars of Mötley Crüe.

==Legacy and influence==
Hide is regarded as very influential to not only contemporary Japanese musicians, but also to his generation. X Japan is considered one of the founders of visual kei, a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam, and subsequently are influences to many newer bands. When they disbanded, Hide was the only member to carry on with the look and had the most successful solo career. As such, acts that cite him specifically as an influence include D&#x27;espairsRay, Mucc guitarist Miya and vocalist Tatsuro, Nightmare&#x27;s Hitsugi, Syu of Galneryus, Hizaki and Teru of Versailles, members from heidi., Naoto of Deathgaze, DuelJewel&#x27;s Shun, Kouichi of Laputa, Jui from Vidoll, Reo of lynch., Dir En Grey vocalist Kyo and guitarist Kaoru, each member of Daizystripper, Kohshi from Flow, members of MarBell, Head Phones President frontwoman Anza, DJ Ozma, Ami Suzuki, Silver Ash leader Ling, Chiemi Ishimoto from Mass of the Fermenting Dregs, Marilyn Manson and Minami Momochi. Ryuichi stated that Hide was a big influence on Luna Sea.

Hide has been compared to Kurt Cobain and Jimi Hendrix with regards to his impact on Japanese youth, having been &quot;elevated to a &#x27;guitar god&#x27; status.&quot; According to Josephine Yun, Hide&#x27;s &quot;stage persona was insolent, in your face, taunting and belligerent, and it thrilled Japanese youth while horrifying older generations. Many Japanese felt stifled by convention and identified with his naughty rebelliousness; he became a cult figure.&quot; Neil Strauss claims Hide &quot;despised the music business and wanted to change it&quot; and that he said he felt &quot;trapped in the image of a pop star.&quot; According to Strauss, he &quot;represented a generation of fans who felt alienated, and his death represented the end of a genre.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Steve McClure concurred; his &quot;death means the end of an era&quot;, adding &quot;X were the first generation of visual kei bands[...] For the next generation of bands, it&#x27;s like: &quot;That&#x27;s it. The torch has been passed to us.&quot;&quot;

<doc id="905497" wikidata="Q6209789" url="?curid=905497" title="Joe Fedele">
<text>Joseph Fedele (known as Joe Fedele, born C. 1962) is an entrepreneur who co-founded New York-based online specialty grocery FreshDirect in 1998 along with investment banker Jason Ackerman. Fedele was CEO and co-chairman from 1998 to 2004.

Prior to FreshDirect, Fedele was CEO and president of Fairway Market on West 132nd Street in Manhattan from 1993 to 1998. He helped the conversion of the business from Fairway to Fairway (&quot;Like No Other Market&quot;). During that period, the company disintermediated its supply chain for perishable and specialty products and introduced just-in-time inventory stocking.

==Early life==
Fedele was born in Brooklyn, New York and graduated from Hofstra University, acquiring a BBA in Accounting, Finance, Economics and Mathematics in 1980.

==Career==
===PFI===
In 1982, he founded PFI, one of the largest protein and perishable trading companies in the US with customers such as Marubeni, Komatsu Gosho, Sumitomo, Price Club, Walmart, and others.

===By Choice===
By Choice was a Harlem fresh market opened by Fedele and his partners in February 1991 it was converted to Fairway &quot;Like No Other Market.&quot;

&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Fedele got his perfect partners when the owners of the Fairway Market at Broadway and 74th Street signed on as partners.&quot;

===Fairway market(s)===

Fairway Market was founded in 1933. Fedele&#x27;s involvement came when the founder&#x27;s grandson Howard Glickberg&#x27;s flagship store (Broadway/West 74th Street) helped restart the failed &quot;By Choice&quot;.

In 1991 Fedele had helped found the &quot;Business Process&quot; that later converted Fairway from its small format original single store on 74th and Broadway to the new Fairway (&quot;Like No Other Market&quot;). This independent store in Harlem was attracting more than 20,000 customers a week within two months of opening. A combination of variety, quality, and low prices in a marketplace atmosphere, attracted shoppers from all over the New York City area, from the Upper Manhattan to the then-inner-city neighborhood where it was located. Fairway achieved high quality products at low prices by cutting out all middle distributors. The store bought from &quot;the guy who takes it from the land, takes it from the sea, puts it in a can or slaughters it. This way, it&#x27;s four to five days fresher and 30% cheaper,&quot; said Fedele.
Fedele, who calls himself a food technologist, believes that direct buying ensures quality. Perishables that go through layers of distribution experience temperature fluctuations and inevitably suffer from adulteration. Quality is also reinforced through selectivity. &quot;Our expertise is to pick the best quality grades in meat, fish and produce,&quot; he said.

===FreshDirect===

In 1998, Fedele launched FreshDirect. He initially raised $120 million and leveraged a no-store concept to develop a better plan: start by dealing directly with farmers, fishermen, and slaughterhouses and build a single super-efficient manufacturing and distribution facility to hold down costs. That kept gross margins high enough to cover the added costs of reliable delivery, offered in densely packed neighborhoods. Kenneth Boyer, an associate professor at Michigan State University&#x27;s business school who studies online grocers, says a visit to the company &quot;really blew me away.&quot;

==Controversies==
===Harlem Fairway Certificate of Occupancy===
At the reopened/retitled Fairway facility in Harlem, as of early 1996 they lacked a Certificate of Occupancy. Co-owner Dave Sneldon claimed to have &quot;a temporary certificate of occupancy to operate a wholesale business.&quot; Fedele said &quot;we don&#x27;t charge retail prices.&quot; A NYC commissioner claimed that they didn&#x27;t apply.

===Fairway/FreshDirect: Fedele&#x27;s role(s)===
After selling his interest in Fairway (to Glickberg and his partners) to start FreshDirect in 1998, Fedele became embroiled in a series of disputes with Fairway&#x27;s owners, who accused him of over-representing his role in the creation of Fairway&#x27;s Harlem branch. In response, Fedele says that his description of himself as the branch&#x27;s &quot;co-founder&quot; is an understatement. He was quoted saying, in response to Glickberg, &quot;my former partners at Fairway did business in the traditional retail way for 30 years before we became partners, having multiple distributors between them and the products that they sold. I guess after I became their partner they had this epiphany of totally disintermediating of supply chain which resulted in the &quot;highest value proposition possible to the consumer. Getting them better, fresher food at 30 percent savings and giving us a sustainable, competitive and differentiated advantage.&quot;

Fairway began hanging signs in its aisles attacking Fedele&#x27;s credibility and the quality of FreshDirect&#x27;s produce. &quot;New York Magazine&quot; wrote (May 17, 2004):

The FreshDirect posters blaring that the company was BROUGHT TO YOU BY A CO-FOUNDER OF FAIRWAY UPTOWN and featuring a photo of Fedele made [Fairway owner Howie] Glickberg furious. He posted signs inside the West 74th Street store reading FAIRWAY IS IN NO WAY AFFILIATED WITH FRESHDIRECT. FreshDirect jabbed back by sending staffers dressed as giant fruits and vegetables to pass out fliers in front of Fairway. Then the FreshDirect website added a lengthy description of Fedele&#x27;s role in the uptown Fairway, headlined: HEY FAIRWAY, WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID OF? Fairway threatened to sue.Fairway never sued, but the accusatory-claims and counter-claims continued.

==Awards==
* Fedele and FreshDirect co-founder Ackerman won the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year award for 2003 for the Metropolitan New York Area, and Fedele was nominated for the national Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year award in 2003, eventually won by John Mackey.
* Fedele and his partners at &quot;Fairway Market&quot; won the Ernst &amp; Young Entrepreneur of the Year Award in New York City in 1996.

<text>:&quot;Richard Harwood is also the assumed name of National Front member Richard Verrall.&quot;

Richard Craig Harwood (born 8 August 1979) is a British cellist.

== Biography ==
Richard Harwood was born in Portsmouth, Hampshire and began learning to play the piano aged four and the cello, aged five. He attended Ditcham Park School. He achieved his Associated Board Grade 8 in cello and piano, aged 8 and 11 respectively.

Harwood studied with Joan Dickson from 1988 until her death in 1994, before continuing with Steven Doane and David Waterman (1994–1999), Heinrich Schiff (1999-2003 at the University of Music and Dramatic Art, Vienna) and Ralph Kirshbaum (2003-2005 at the Royal Northern College of Music, Manchester). He also took masterclasses and lessons with Mstislav Rostropovich, János Starker, Steven Isserlis, Boris Pergamenschikow, Miklós Perényi, Bernard Greenhouse, Valentin Erben (Alban Berg Quartet), William Pleeth, Zara Nelsova, and Ferenc Rados.

Harwood made his concerto debut at the age of ten (playing the G minor Kabalevsky Concerto at the Adrian Boult Hall, Birmingham) and, since then, has performed concerti and recitals in major venues including the Royal Albert Hall, Royal Festival Hall, Queen Elizabeth Hall, Wigmore Hall, Musikverein, Concertgebouw, Alte Oper, 
Thomaskirche, and the Auditorium du Louvre.

As concerto soloist, Harwood has collaborated with conductors such as John Wilson, Okko Kamu, Marko Letonja, Douglas Bostock, En Shao, Shuntaro Sato, David Parry and Yehudi Menuhin, and with orchestras including The Philharmonia, Bournemouth Symphony Orchestra, RTÉ Concert Orchestra, Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra, and the Ural Philharmonic Orchestra.

As chamber musician, he has collaborated with the Jerusalem and Endellion Quartets, Gidon Kremer, Yuri Bashmet, Olivier Charlier, Alena Baeva, Ilya Gringolts, Pekka Kuusisto, Vilde Frang, Chen Halevi, Julian Bliss, Martin Roscoe, Finghin Collins, Ashley Wass and Julius Drake, among others. In 2014, Harwood became the cellist of the Sitkovetsky Trio.

Harwood has performed on BBC radio, having made his BBC Radio 3 debut at the age of thirteen with a live recording of the Elgar Concerto. He has also given performances for Radio France, MDR, RTÉ, and Radio New Zealand.

Harwood&#x27;s discography includes a critically acclaimed debut disc for EMI Classics, recorded with pianist Christoph Berner, and &quot;Composing Without The Picture&quot;, a 2013 solo album of concert works written by film composers, on Resonus. Harwood appears in Phil Grabsky&#x27;s 2009 documentary &quot;In Search of Beethoven&quot; which received its theatrical premiere at the Barbican Theatre, London, was broadcast on Sky Arts, and shown in cinemas worldwide.

In 2002, Harwood took part in the Park Lane Group Young Artists&#x27; Series on the South Bank and premiered solo works written for him by Dominic Muldowney and Martin Butler. He has also worked with Philip Grange, giving the London premiere of his &quot;Nocturnal Image&quot;, and given the European premiere of David Horne&#x27;s &quot;Zip&quot; with the composer at the piano. For his solo album &quot;Composing Without the Picture&quot;, Harwood premiered works written for him by Christopher Gunning, Alex Heffes, Fernando Velázquez, 
and Benjamin Wallfisch.

Harwood has won numerous awards including the 2004 Pierre Fournier Award for &#x27;cellists. In 1992, he became the youngest winner of the Audi Junior Musician Award. He won the Worshipful Company of Musicians Maisie Lewis Young Artists Award in 2001 and, in 2004, became the first British &#x27;cellist ever to be awarded the title &quot;Bachpreisträger&quot; at the International Johann Sebastian Bach Competition, Leipzig. Among many other accolades, he received the special &quot;mention&quot; prize from the jury at the Concours de violoncelle Rostropovitch, Paris in 2005.

In 1997, BBC Music Magazine selected him in their worldwide &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; edition and, in 2000, Harwood was entered into the &quot;International Who&#x27;s Who in Music&quot; as an &#x27;up and coming talent on the brink of worldwide recognition.&#x27;

Harwood plays a cello by Francesco Rugeri, dated 1692.

<text>The George Parks Highway (numbered Interstate A-4 and signed Alaska Route 3), usually called simply the Parks Highway, runs 323 miles (520 km) from the Glenn Highway 35 miles (56 km) north of Anchorage to Fairbanks in the Alaska Interior. The highway, originally known as the Anchorage-Fairbanks Highway, was completed in 1971, and given its current name in 1975.

The highway, which mostly parallels the Alaska Railroad, is one of the most important roads in Alaska. It is the main route between Anchorage and Fairbanks (Alaska&#x27;s two largest metropolitan areas), the principal access to Denali National Park and Preserve and Denali State Park, and the main highway in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley. The route&#x27;s Interstate designation is not signed; rather, its entire length is signed as Alaska Route 3.

It is a common misconception that the name &quot;Parks Highway&quot; comes from the road&#x27;s proximity to the Denali state and national parks; it is in fact in honor of George Alexander Parks, governor of the Territory of Alaska from 1925 to 1933. However, the aptness of the name was recognized when it was chosen.

Mileposts along the Parks Highway do not begin with 0 (zero). Instead, they begin with Mile 35 (km 56), continuing the milepost numbering of the Glenn Highway where the two highways intersect near Palmer. The 0 (zero) mile marker for the Glenn Highway is at its terminus in downtown Anchorage at the intersection of East 5th Avenue and Gambell Street. Thus mileposts along the Parks Highway reflect distance from Anchorage, which is not actually on the Parks Highway.

There are two sections of the highway that are built to freeway standards. These include an area near the highway&#x27;s intersection with the Glenn Highway in Palmer and a stretch known as the Robert J. Mitchell Expressway in Fairbanks leading to the highway&#x27;s junction with the Richardson Highway (AK 2).

==Interstate Highway System==

George Parks Highway is part of the unsigned part of the Interstate Highway System as Interstate A-4.

==Exit list==
&quot;In the &quot;Mile&quot; column, the first number is the actual mileage of the Parks Highway, and the second mile is based on the mileposts along the highway itself.&quot;&lt;br&gt;

<doc id="905512" wikidata="Q4495128" url="?curid=905512" title="Calneh">
<text>Calneh () was a city founded by Nimrod, mentioned three times in the Hebrew Bible (), (), &amp; (). 
The verse in Genesis reads:
:&quot;And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar&quot; (KJV)

Historical scholarship proposed candidate locations for the city of &quot;Calneh&quot;, but it is now considered most likely, in a suggestion going back to 
W.F. Albright (1944), that the word did not in origin refer to a city but has been corrupted from an expression meaning &quot;all of them&quot;. In the Revised Standard Version, the English translation of the verse reads:
:&quot;The beginning of his kingdom was Babel, Erech, and Accad, all of them in the land of Shinar.&quot;

Calneh (&quot;Chalanne&quot;) was identified with Ctesiphon in Jerome&#x27;s &quot;Hebrew questions on Genesis&quot; (written ca. 390), following Eusebius of Caesarea.
Easton&#x27;s 1897 Bible Dictionary silently follows Sir Henry Rawlinson in interpreting the Talmudic passage Joma 10a identifying Calneh with the modern Nippur, a lofty mound of earth and rubbish situated in the marshes on the east bank of the Euphrates, but 30 miles distant from its present course, and about 60 miles south-south-east from Babylon.

A second Calneh is mentioned in the Book of Amos, and some have also associated this place with &quot;Calno&quot; which is mentioned in similar terms in the Book of Isaiah. (, ) This is identified by some archaeological scholars as Kulnia, Kullani or Kullanhu, modern &quot;Kullan-Köy&quot;, between Carchemish on the Euphrates River and Arpad near Aleppo in Northern Syria, about ten kilometers southeast from Arpad. 
&quot;Canneh&quot;, mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel 27:23 as one of the towns with which Tyre carried on trade was associated with Calneh by A.T. Olmstead, &quot;History of Assyria&quot;. Xenophon mentioned a &quot;Kainai&quot; on the west bank of the Tigris below the Upper Zab.

<doc id="905516" wikidata="Q292223" url="?curid=905516" title="Catherine Cookson">
<text>[[Dame]] Catherine Ann Cookson (&quot;née&quot; McMullen; 20 June 1906 – 11 June 1998), was a British writer. She is in the top 20 of the most widely read British novelists, with sales topping 100 million, while she retained a relatively low profile in the world of celebrity writers. Her books were inspired by her deprived youth in South Shields (historically part of County Durham), North East England, the setting for her novels. With 104 titles written in her own name or two other pen names, she is one of the most prolific British novelists.

==Early life==
Cookson, registered as Catherine Ann Davies, was born on 20 June 1906 at 5 Leam Lane in Tyne Dock, South Shields, County Durham, England. She was known as &quot;Katie&quot; as a child. She moved to East Jarrow, which would become the setting for one of her best-known novels, &quot;The Fifteen Streets&quot;. The illegitimate child of an alcoholic named Kate Fawcett, she grew up thinking her unmarried mother was her sister, as she was brought up by her grandparents, Rose and John McMullen. Biographer Kathleen Jones tracked down her father, whose name was Alexander Davies, a bigamist and gambler from Lanarkshire, Scotland.

She left school at 14 and, after a period of domestic service, took a laundry job at Harton Workhouse in South Shields. In 1929, she moved south to run the laundry at Hastings Workhouse, saving every penny to buy a large Victorian house, and then taking in lodgers to supplement her income.

In June 1940, at the age of 34, she married Tom Cookson, a teacher at Hastings Grammar School. After experiencing four miscarriages late in pregnancy, it was discovered she was suffering from a rare vascular disease, telangiectasia, which caused bleeding from the nose, fingers, and stomach and resulted in anaemia. A mental breakdown followed the miscarriages, from which it took her a decade to recover.

==Writing career==
She took up writing as a form of therapy in order to tackle her depression, and she became a founding member of the Hastings Writers&#x27; Group. Her first novel, &quot;Kate Hannigan&quot;, was published in 1950. Though it was labelled a romance novel, she expressed discontent with the stereotype. Her books were, she said, historical novels about people and conditions she knew. Cookson had little connection with the London literary circle.

Cookson wrote almost 100 books, which sold more than 123 million copies, her novels being translated into at least 20 languages. She also wrote books under the pseudonyms Catherine Marchant and a name derived from her childhood name, Katie McMullen. She remained the most borrowed author from public libraries in the UK for 17 years, up until four years after her death, losing the top spot to Dame Jacqueline Wilson only in 2002.

==Books in film, on television and on stage==
Many of Cookson&#x27;s novels have been adapted for film, radio, and the stage. The first film adaptation of her work was &quot;Jacqueline&quot; (1956), directed by Roy Ward Baker, based on her book &quot;A Grand Man&quot;. It was followed by &quot;Rooney&quot; (1958), directed by George Pollock, based on her book &quot;Rooney&quot;. Both films starred John Gregson. For commercial reasons, the action of both films was transferred from South Shields to Ireland.

In 1983 &quot;Katie Mulholland&quot; was adapted into a stage musical by composer Eric Boswell and writer-director Ken Hill. Cookson attended the première.

It was on television, however, that she had her greatest media success, with a series of dramas that appeared over the course of a decade on ITV and achieved huge ratings. Eighteen books were adapted for television between 1989 and 2001. They were all produced by Ray Marshall from Festival Film &amp; TV who was given permission by Cookson in 1988 to bring her works to the screen. The first film to be made, &quot;The Fifteen Streets&quot; starring Sean Bean and Owen Teale, was nominated for an Emmy award in 1990. The second production, &quot;The Black Velvet Gown&quot;, won an International Emmy for Best Drama in 1991. The mini series regularly attracted over 10 million audiences and are still showing in the UK on Drama and the Yesterday Channel.

==Philanthropy==
In 1985, Cookson pledged more than £800,000 to the University of Newcastle. In gratitude, the university set up a lectureship in hematology. Some £40,000 was given to provide a laser to help treat bleeding disorders and £50,000 went to create a new post in ear, nose, and throat studies, with particular reference to the detection of deafness in children. She had already given £20,000 towards the university&#x27;s Hatton Gallery and £32,000 to its library. In recognition of this generosity, a building in the university medical faculty has been named after her. Her foundation continues to make donations to worthy causes in the UK, particularly those offering services to young people and cultural ventures, such as the Tyneside Cinema.

==Honours==
She was created an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1985, and was elevated to Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1993.

Cookson received the Freedom of the Borough of South Tyneside, and an honorary degree from the University of Newcastle. The Variety Club of Great Britain named her Writer of the Year, and she was voted Personality of the North East.

She was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1982 when she was surprised by Eamonn Andrews.

Cookson was awarded an honorary fellowship at St Hilda&#x27;s College, Oxford in 1997 after donating £100,000 to the college, although she was too ill to travel to receive it.

==Later life and death==
In later life, Cookson and her husband, Tom, returned to the North East and settled first in Haldane Terrace, Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne. They then moved to Corbridge, a market town near Newcastle, and later to Langley, Northumberland, a small village nearby. As her health declined, they moved for a final time, back to Jesmond in 1989 to be nearer to medical facilities. For the last few years of her life she was bed-ridden, and she gave her final TV interview to &quot;North East Tonight&quot;, the regional ITV Tyne Tees news programme, from her sickbed. It was conducted by Mike Neville.

Cookson died at the age of 91, nine days before her 92nd birthday, at her home in Newcastle. Her novels, many written from her sickbed, continued to be published posthumously until 2002. Her husband Tom died just 17 days later, on 28 June 1998. He had been hospitalised for a week and the cause of his death was not announced. He was 86 years old. The couple was married for 50 years.

==Legacy==

In 1992, the inaugural Catherine Cookson Prize took place and was won by author Val Wood and her debut novel, &quot;The Hungry Tide&quot;, which subsequently went on to become a best-seller. 

In March 2008, the Dame Catherine Cookson Memorial Garden was unveiled in the grounds of South Tyneside District Hospital in South Shields, based on the theme of a serpentine symbol, commonly used to symbolise health and caring. The hospital occupies the site of the Harton Workhouse, where Cookson worked from 1924 to 1929. The project was partly funded by the Catherine Cookson Trust.

<text>Pickup on South Street is a 1953 American spy film noir written and directed by Samuel Fuller, and starring Richard Widmark, Jean Peters, and Thelma Ritter. Widmark plays a pickpocket who unwittingly steals a covert microfilm sought by foreign agents. The film combines elements of the traditional crime film noir with Cold War-era espionage drama. It was released by 20th Century-Fox.

The film was screened at the 14th Venice International Film Festival, where it won the Bronze Lion. Thelma Ritter’s performance earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In 2018, &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
On a crowded New York City subway train pickpocket Skip McCoy steals Candy&#x27;s wallet. Unbeknownst to either it contains microfilm of top-secret government information. Candy was delivering an envelope as a final favor to her ex-boyfriend Joey, who told her that it contained stolen business secrets.

Government agent Zara had Candy under surveillance, hoping she would lead him to the top man in a Communist spy ring. He seeks police help identifying the pickpocket. Captain Dan Tiger has professional informant Moe Williams brought in. She asks Zara several questions about the pickpocket&#x27;s technique, negotiates a price, and gives Tiger a list of names; Zara quickly identifies Skip from his mug shot. He tries to get Skip to give up the film, revealing its importance and appealing to his patriotism, but Skip denies he has it and laughs in his face.

Meanwhile, Joey persuades a reluctant Candy to track down the thief on her own. The trail leads to Moe, who is delighted to be able to sell the same information again.

Candy searches Skip&#x27;s waterfront shack that night while he is out. Spotting only a flashlight when he returns, he knocks the prowler cold. When Candy comes to, she tries to get the film but fails.

The second time she visits she is puzzled when he calls her a &quot;Commie&quot; and &quot;a Red&quot; and demands $25,000 for the film. He reveals that he knows what is on it. Skip thinks she is only acting. Despite his rough treatment she finds herself falling for him.

When she returns to Joey his superior gives him a day to get the film back, and leaves him a gun. Candy finally realizes the truth. She turns to Moe for help, since Skip will not believe her if she warns him he is in danger. Moe tries to convince Skip to give the film to the government but fails. She goes home and finds Joey waiting for her. She refuses to give him Skip&#x27;s address, and reveals she knows about the Communist plot. Joey shoots her dead.

The next morning Skip returns home to find Candy there. She blames herself for Moe&#x27;s death, and is dismayed that he is still willing to trade with the Commies. When he starts to leave with the film, she knocks him out with a bottle and takes it to Zara and Tiger. Zara asks her to give it to Joey so he can lead them to his boss. Candy does, but Joey notices there&#x27;s a frame missing. He beats her in an attempt to get Skip&#x27;s address, then shoots her as she tries to flee. Rifling her purse, he finds the address.

Skip learns of Candy&#x27;s beating and visits her in the hospital, comforting her with a romantic kiss.

Joey and his boss go to the shack, but Skip hears them coming and hides underneath. When Joey is ordered to deliver the film as is, Skip follows him to a subway station. He watches as an envelope is exchanged in a restroom, then knocks out the courier and chases after and beats up Joey.

Later, at the police station, Tiger predicts Skip will louse up his pardon and return to his criminal ways. A defiant Candy, arm in arm with her new love, says that&#x27;s not the way it will be.

==Production==
Darryl F. Zanuck showed Fuller, who was then under contract with 20th Century-Fox, a script by Dwight Taylor called &quot;Blaze of Glory&quot; about a woman lawyer falling in love with a criminal she was defending in a murder trial. Fuller liked the idea but knew from his previous crime reporter experience that courtroom cases take a long time to play out. Fuller asked Zanuck if he could write a story of a lower criminal and his girlfriend that he originally titled &quot;Pickpocket&quot; but Zanuck thought the title too &quot;European&quot;.

Fuller had memories of South Street from his days as a crime reporter and came up with his new title. Fuller met Detective Dan Campion of the New York Police Department to research the background material of his story to add realism, with Fuller basing the role of &quot;Tiger&quot;, the police detective, on Campion who had been suspended without salary for six months for manhandling a suspect.

Fuller turned down many actresses for the lead role including studio favorites Marilyn Monroe; Shelley Winters; Ava Gardner, who looked too glamorous; Betty Grable, who wanted a dance number written in; and initially Jean Peters, whom he did not like when he saw film of her in &quot;Captain from Castile&quot;. With only a week to go before the film started production, Fuller saw Peters walk into the studio&#x27;s commissary while having lunch. Fuller noticed Peters walked with a slightly bow-legged style that many prostitutes also had. Fuller was impressed with Peters&#x27; intelligence, spunkiness, and different roles at the studio when he tested her the Friday before shooting started on the Monday. When Betty Grable insisted on being in the film and threatened to cause problems, Fuller threatened to walk off the film. Peters got the role.

In August 1952, the script was deemed unacceptable by the Production Code, by reasons of &quot;excessive brutality and sadistic beatings, of both men and women&quot;, including a vicious beating the character &quot;Candy&quot; (Peters) receives from ex-boyfriend and Communist operative &quot;Joey&quot; (Kiley). Although a revised script was accepted soon after, the studio was forced to shoot multiple takes of a particular scene where Peters and Kiley frisked each other for loot as being too risqué.

The French release of the movie removed any reference to spies and microfilm in the dubbed version. They called the movie &quot;Le Port de la Drogue&quot; (&quot;Drug&#x27;s harbour&quot;). The managers of 20th Century-Fox thought that the theme of communist spies was too controversial in a country (France) where the Communist Party was an influential and legitimate part of public life.

FBI director J. Edgar Hoover had lunch with Fuller and Zanuck, and said how much he detested Fuller&#x27;s work and especially &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot;. Hoover objected to Widmark&#x27;s unpatriotic character especially his line &quot;Are you waving the flag at me?&quot;. Zanuck backed Fuller up, telling Hoover he knew nothing about making movies, but removed references to the FBI in the film&#x27;s advertising, which is also never mentioned by name in the film.

==Adaptations==
In June 1954, Ritter co-starred alongside Terry Moore and Stephen McNally in a Lux Radio Theatre presentation of the story. 20th Century-Fox remade the film in 1967 as &quot;The Cape Town Affair&quot;, directed by Robert D. Webb and starring Claire Trevor (in the Thelma Ritter role), James Brolin (in his first leading role), and Jacqueline Bisset.

=== Critical response ===
When the film was released, reviews were somewhat mixed. Bosley Crowther wrote:

It looks very much as though someone is trying to out-bulldoze Mickey Spillane in Twentieth Century-Fox&#x27;s &quot;Pickup on South Street,&quot; ... this highly embroidered presentation of a slice of life in the New York underworld not only returns Richard Widmark to a savage, arrogant role, but also uses Jean Peters blandly as an all-comers&#x27; human punching-bag. Violence bursts in every sequence, and the conversation is slangy and corrupt. Even the genial Thelma Ritter plays a stool pigeon who gets her head blown off ... Sensations he has in abundance and, in the delivery of them, Mr. Widmark, Miss Peters, Miss Ritter and all the others in the cast do very well. Murvyn Vye, as a cynical detective, is particularly caustic and good, and several other performers in lesser roles give the thing a certain tone.

The staff at &quot;Variety&quot; magazine also had a mixed response:

If &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot; makes any point at all, it&#x27;s that there is nothing really wrong with pickpockets, even when they are given to violence, as long as they don&#x27;t play footsie with Communist spies ... Film&#x27;s assets are partly its photography, which creates an occasional tense atmosphere, and partly the performance of Thelma Ritter, the only halfway convincing figure in an otherwise unconvincing cast ... Widmark is given a chance to repeat on his snarling menace characterization followed by a look-what-love-can-do-to-a-bad-boy act as Widmark&#x27;s hard-boiled soul melts before Peters&#x27; romancing.

In recent years, critical appraisals of &quot;Pickup&quot; have warmed considerably. The movie has a 93% rating on Rotten Tomatoes from 40 reviews with an average score of 7.8/10. The consensus summarizes: &quot;Powerfully acted and satisfyingly dark, &quot;Pickup on South Street&quot; is a Cold War noir that moves confidently to the rhythm of city street life.&quot; Roger Ebert regards &quot;Pickup&quot; as one of Fuller&#x27;s &quot;noir classics.&quot;

In 2000 Rick Thompson suggested that &quot;Pickup&quot; may have been the basis of Robert Bresson&#x27;s &quot;Pickpocket&quot; (1959), with which it shares many themes:

 ... including the death of the mother-figure; the hero&#x27;s problem making commitment to the potential lover; a series of philosophical dialogues between the hero and his police antagonist; the interlinking of pickpocketing and sexuality; and the construction of the pickpocket hero as an extreme and deliberate outsider.&quot;

<doc id="905533" wikidata="Q244929" url="?curid=905533" title="The Bedford Incident">
<text>The Bedford Incident is a 1965 British-American Cold War film directed by James B. Harris, starring Richard Widmark and Sidney Poitier, and produced by Harris and Widmark. The cast also features Eric Portman, James MacArthur, Martin Balsam, and Wally Cox, as well as early appearances by Donald Sutherland and Ed Bishop. James Poe adapted Mark Rascovich&#x27;s 1963 novel of the same name, which borrowed from the plot of Herman Melville&#x27;s &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;; at one point in the film, the captain is advised he is &quot;not chasing whales now&quot;.

At the time &quot;The Bedford Incident&quot; was produced, Harris was best known as the producer of three of Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s films. The two parted ways when Kubrick decided to make &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; as a satirical black comedy, rather than a dramatic thriller, but Harris remained focused on developing a serious nuclear confrontation film, and &quot;The Bedford Incident&quot; was released less than two years after &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;.
==Plot==
The United States Navy destroyer USS &quot;Bedford&quot;, under the strict command of Captain Eric Finlander, is sailing in the Denmark Strait. Among those on board are Ben Munceford, a civilian photojournalist; Commodore Wolfgang Schrepke, a Bundesmarine NATO naval advisor; Ensign Ralston, an inexperienced young officer who is constantly criticized by Finlander for small errors; and Lieutenant Commander Chester Potter, the ship&#x27;s new doctor.

When the &quot;Bedford&quot; detects a Soviet submarine just off the coast of Greenland, Finlander mercilessly stalks his prey into international waters and plays a waiting game after losing sonar contact in a field of icebergs, knowing the diesel-powered sub will have to surface within 24 hours to replenish its air and recharge its batteries. The crew never complains, but Potter is concerned that maintaining this level of vigilance is dangerous and suggests modifications, all of which Finlander dismisses out of hand.

Munceford is aboard to photograph life on a Navy destroyer, but his real interest is Finlander, who was one of only a few military officials to publicly state that the United States should have used greater force during the Cuban Missile Crisis. When Munceford asks Finlander if this is why, though he gets results, he was recently passed over for promotion to admiral, Finlander becomes hostile and accuses Munceford of misinterpreting the facts. He says he would go &quot;all the way&quot; to save his country, but, after calming down, insists his current action is just a deterrent.

The Soviet submarine is spotted by the &quot;Bedford&quot;″s radar when it finally pokes its snorkel above the surface. It was not seen first by the sonarman because he is having exhaustion-induced delusions. Schrepke reminds Finlander that his orders are just to escort the sub out of Greenland&#x27;s waters, but Finlander sends a message ordering the sub to fully surface and identify itself. When the order is ignored, Finlander runs over the snorkel. Munceford and Schrepke protest that Finlander is forcing the sub to fight, and Finlander orders Ralston to arm an anti-submarine rocket. He reassures Munceford and Schrepke that he will not fire first, but when he says that &quot;if he fires one, I&#x27;ll fire one&quot;, the fatigued Ralston just hears &quot;fire one&quot; and launches the rocket.

Before it is destroyed, the Soviet submarine launches four nuclear torpedoes. Although Finlander orders evasive maneuvers and countermeasures, the torpedoes continue to home-in on the &quot;Bedford&quot;. Finlander silently leaves the bridge, followed by Munceford, who frantically pleads for him to do something. The captain looks away sheepishly, and the &quot;Bedford&quot; and her crew are vaporized in an atomic blast, resulting in a mushroom cloud.

==Cast==

==Production==
===Writing===
The story reflects several real Cold War incidents between the NATO and Warsaw Pact navies, including one in 1957 when the USS &quot;Gudgeon&quot;, a submarine, was caught in Soviet waters and chased out to sea by Soviet warships. Although none of these real-life incidents ended as catastrophically as the &quot;Bedford&quot; incident, the story illustrated many of the fears of the time.

The screenplay by James Poe follows the novel fairly closely, but Poe wrote a different ending. In the novel, the Soviet submarine does not fire back at the &quot;Bedford&quot; before being destroyed. The shocked Finlander receives word of his promotion to admiral. Commodore Schrepke, realising the incident will spark World War III, sabotages one of the remaining ASROCs and destroys the ship. Munceford, the sole survivor, is found by &quot;Novosibirsk&quot;, the submarine&#x27;s mothership.

===Filming===

Although some shots in the film were recorded at sea, &quot;The Bedford Incident&quot; was mostly filmed at Shepperton Studios in the United Kingdom. The &quot;USS &quot;Bedford&quot;&quot; is a fictitious guided missile destroyer, and the role of &quot;Bedford&quot; was mostly played by a large model of a &quot;Farragut&quot;-class destroyer. Interior scenes were filmed in the British Type 15 frigate ; the &quot;Troubridge&quot;&#x27;s novel, forward-sloping bridge windows can be seen in some shots, as can British military equipment, such as a rack of Lee-Enfield rifles. Poitier and Balsam&#x27;s initial flypast and landing from a Whirlwind helicopter were filmed aboard another Type 15 frigate, , whose pennant number of &quot;F159&quot; is clearly visible in the scene. The vessel portraying a Soviet intelligence ship has the name &quot;Novo Sibursk&quot;, written on the hull at the bow in the Latin alphabet (rather than the Russian language&#x27;s Cyrillic alphabet), though &quot;Novosibirsk&quot; would have been a more accurate rendering.

==Reception==
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that &quot;the whole thing transcends plausibility [...] because of its gross exaggeration of a highly improbable episode. [...] the blame for this climactic blooper must be lodged against James Poe, who wrote the script from a novel by Mark Rascovich.&quot;

==Actual Cold War incident==

In October 1962, at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Soviet submarine &quot;B-59&quot; was pursued in the Atlantic Ocean by the U.S. Navy. When the Soviet vessel failed to surface, destroyers began dropping training depth charges. Unlike in &quot;The Bedford Incident&quot;, the Americans were not aware that the &quot;B-59&quot; was armed with a T-5 nuclear torpedo. As the &quot;B-59&quot; had been out of contact with Moscow for several days and was running too deep to monitor civilian radio broadcasts, the Soviet captain thought World War III might have started and wanted to launch the weapon, but he was overruled by his flotilla commander, Vasili Arkhipov, who was using the sub as his command vessel. After an argument, it was agreed that the submarine would surface and await orders from Moscow. It was not until after the fall of the Soviet Union that the existence of the T-5 torpedo and how close the world came to nuclear conflict became known.

<text>Prime Computer, Inc. was a Natick, Massachusetts-based producer of minicomputers from 1972 until 1992. With the advent of PCs and the decline of the minicomputer industry, Prime was forced out of the market in the early 1990s, and by the end of 2010 the trademarks for both PRIME and PRIMOS no longer existed.

The alternative spellings &quot;PR1ME&quot; and &quot;PR1MOS&quot; were used as brand names or logos by the company.

==Founders==
The company was started by seven founders, some of whom worked on the Multics project at MIT.

* Robert Baron (President)
* Sidney Halligan (VP Sales)
* James Campbell (Director of Marketing)
* Joseph Cashen (VP Hardware Engineering)
* Robert Berkowitz (VP Manufacturing)
* William Poduska (VP Software Engineering)
* John Carter (Director of Human Resources)

The company started with the motto &quot;Software First&quot;.

Poduska left in 1981, to start Apollo Computer. His successor was 27-year IBM executive Joe M. Henson, although Prime&#x27;s president, Kenneth G. Fisher, had briefly been the interim top executive.

==Minicomputer products==
The initial offerings by Prime were clones of Honeywell&#x27;s DDP 316 and 516 minicomputers. Main competitors were Digital Equipment Corporation, Data General and Hewlett-Packard. time-sharing was Prime&#x27;s largest end-user market, and 25% of revenue was from OEM. Overseas markets provided 42% of revenue in the first quarter of 1975.

*1972: Prime 200
:The first Prime system was similar to the 16-bit DDP 516. It ran an operating system called DOS, also referred to as PRIMOS 2 (not to be confused with MS-DOS, PC DOS, etc.).
*1973: Prime 100
:The Prime 100 was a stripped down version of the Prime 200 (no memory parity or floating point).
*1974: Prime 300
:The Prime 300 had a main store of 32 KB to 512 KB and from 6 MB of Pertec disk storage. It ran DOSVM operating system, also referred to as PRIMOS 3, but still used earlier DOS for booting. One of the first minicomputers with microcode-supported virtual memory capability. The virtual memory was simpler than used in later systems. Addresses were 16 bits, with each of up to 32 time-sharing (time slice) users, receiving a virtual 64 K-word address space. It had &quot;S-mode&quot; and &quot;R-mode&quot; instructions. 
:An example of the Prime 300 was installed in the mathematics department of the University of Aston in Birmingham, UK and at the Medical University of Hannover, Germany.

*1976: Prime 400
:The Prime 400 ran at 0.5 MIPS, had a main store of up to 8 MB and 160 MB of disc storage. The name PRIMOS was now used for the operating system, and the P400 ran PRIMOS 4. It ran a &quot;V-mode&quot; instruction set, along with the S-mode and R-mode instructions. It had a segmented virtual memory architecture, somewhat similar to Multics.

*1979: Prime 450, 550, 650, 750—the beginning of the 50 series nomenclature

:The Prime 550 was an upgrade in performance over the Prime 400. It ran at 0.7 MIPS, had up 2 MB of memory and 500 MB of disc storage and a 9-track tape unit.

:The Prime 750 was a major upgrade. It ran at 1.0 MIPS, had 2–8 MB of memory and 1200 MB of disc storage and a 9-track tape unit. This was very competitive with a similarly priced DEC VAX-11/780 and was one of the first 32-bit superminicomputers. Prime 750 systems were installed at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), University of Paisley, Leeds University, Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), University of Rhode Island, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (UMIST), the CADCentre in Cambridge, and Southeastern University in Washington, DC, Teesside University.

PRIMENET and a local area networking software product named RINGNET were announced.
*1980: Prime 150 and 250
*1981: Prime 850 (dual CPU machine)

Prime also marketed MEDUSA CAD software.
*1982: Prime 2250 also known internally as &quot;Rabbit&quot;
*1983: Prime 9950
*1984: Prime 2550, 9650, 9750
*1985: Prime 9955, 9655, 2655

:The 9955 ran at 4.0 MIPS, had 8–16 MB of memory and 2.7 GB of disc storage and a 9-track tape unit.
:Five Prime 9955 computers (uk.ac.salford.sysa to .syse, connected to JANET) were installed at the University of Salford (along with other systems such as the 2250, 2550, and 750); a Prime 9955 was installed at UMIST and a Prime 9655 at Nottingham University.

*1986: Prime 2350, 2450, 9755, and 9955-II
*1987: Prime 2455, 2755, 6350, and 6550
*1989: Prime 2850, 4050, 6450, and 6650
*1990: Prime 2950, 4150, and 6150

By 1987, Prime Computer had introduced an alternative line of Intel 80386-based computers, the EXL-316 series, running the Unix operating system. A &quot;new line of Unix-based EXL-7000 computers&quot; was announced in late 1990.

The company was successful in the 1970s and 1980s, peaking in 1988 at number 334 of the Fortune 500. In 1985, the company was the sixth largest in the minicomputer sector, with estimated revenues of US $564 million Much of this was based on the U.S. Banking industry where the Prime Info database was widely accepted.

As of later 1989, Surrey University had the largest Prime Site in Europe, having multiple copies of virtually every 50 series machine (mostly running Primos 20.x, but some still running 19.x).

==CAD/CAM Business ==
Prime was heavily involved with Ford’s internal computer-aided design (CAD) product, Product Design Graphics System (PDGS). Design engineers used PDGS for auto body design, and finite element analysis using NASTRAN. It used a vectorscope from Lundy for a display. At one time in the 1980s, PDGS was the world&#x27;s largest integrated CAD system, spanning the US, Japan (Mazda was Ford&#x27;s subsidiary/partner), (Cologne) Germany, (Dunton) England, and (Geelong) Australia. The creators of PDGS, located in building #3 of Ford&#x27;s Dearborn design headquarters, began working on the concept of parametrically driven geometry, which led to a PRIMEDesign system.

The company also acquired marketing and development rights to the MEDUSA CAD system, initially developed in England by Cambridge Interactive Systems (CIS), and having experience in the domain, the company explored transitioning to a CAD company. In 1982, Prime built a development team around the MEDUSA software and subsequently released several enhanced versions of the CAD/CAM system, branded as Prime MEDUSA. Enhancements included support of SunOS (also supported by CIS MEDUSA), a shaded viewer (based on Movie.BYU), and additional 3d visualization. Prime embarked on a project headed by Vladimir Geisberg to build a CAD-CAM system of its own called PRIMEDesign. This product was to compete with the industry leader at that time, CADDS4 from Computervision. RISC processors from MIPS Technologies and graphics processors from Silicon Graphics created the platform for PRIMEDesign as well as being the genesis of modern-day SGI. During this period, in 1985, Sam Geisberg left Computervision to found Parametric Technology Corporation and produce a parameter driven CAD system called ProEngineer. Computervision acquired Cambridge Interactive Systems in 1983, and Prime independently developed their version of MEDUSA.

Prime subsequently purchased Computervision, and Vladimir Geisberg, then VP for CAD, tried to merge back together the Prime and Computervision versions of the Medusa CAD system, and launch Prime Design. As time passed, it became clear that Prime Design, while leading edge, in theory, was unsuitable for real engineering design work, and Prime Design was ended.

==Decline and end==
By the late eighties, the company was having problems retaining customers who were moving to lower-cost systems, as minicomputers entered their decline to obsolescence. Prime failed to keep up with customers&#x27; increasing need for raw computing power. By the end, not a single Prime computer was subject to COCOM export controls, as they were insufficiently powerful for the US Government to fear their falling into the hands of hostile powers.

In 1988, financier Bennett S. LeBow attempted a hostile takeover of Prime, leveraging his much smaller MAI Basic Four company. To stave off LeBow, Prime management organized a $1.3 billion &quot;white knight&quot; leveraged buyout by J.H. Whitney &amp; Company. Various problems dogged this project, the holding company organized by Whitney went bankrupt, and the resulting severe financial distress made it much harder for Prime to deal with the accelerating downturn in its core business.

Prime&#x27;s 1991 revenues of $1.2 billion were 25% lower than their 1988 revenues of $1.6 billion. Its computer sales were down by more than half ($377 million in 1989, $170 million in 1991), and by 1992 no new Prime Computers were being sold, portending a decline in its lucrative business of servicing computers made by Prime (and other manufacturers), a significant contributor to its already-declining revenues. A planned 1989 layoff of 1,200 employees became much more: over 6,000, thus Prime&#x27;s workforce dropped by over half, from 12,386 employees in 1988 to 5,900 by the end of 1991.

After the computer design and manufacturing portions of the company were shut down, the only viable business that remained was the Computervision subsidiary, an early pioneer in CAD/CAM, which was acquired in a hostile takeover 1988. Prime was renamed Computervision, which in 1992 sold the declining remnants of its Prime Information subsidiary to VMark Software Inc.

Computervision was subsequently successfully acquired by Parametric Technology Corporation in 1998, a company founded in 1985 by a former Prime employee.

==Operating system==

The company operating system, &quot;PRIMOS&quot; was originally written mostly in the Fortran IV programming language with some assembler. Subsequently, the PL/P and Modula-2 languages were used in the Kernel. A number of new PRIMOS utilities were written in SP/L which was similar to PL/P.

==Phantom, CPL and ED==
&quot;Phantoms&quot; were a form of unattended background processes that immediately began to run in the background when initiated by the PHANTOM command. &quot;Conventional&quot; batch jobs were initiated via the JOB command, including the ability to schedule them for a particular time.

CPL, the PRIMOS Command Processing Language was the shell scripting language.

The PRIMOS text editor &quot;ED&quot; was a line editor. It could record a command sequence and replay it on different files. Emacs, a full screen editor, was also available.

==Prime 300 specification==
* A microprogrammed 16-bit central processor with floating point hardware, error detection and system integrity checking features.
* 128 KB, 600 nanosecond access MOS main memory.
* 6 MB cartridge disk. 165 cps character printer.
* System software including a disk operating system and FORTRAN, BASIC and assembler for assembly language.
* Support for up to 31 users for a total purchase price of about US$165,000.

==Specialised software==

===General business===

====Advent Online Knowledge====
Advent Online Knowledge, Inc. was a Schaumburg, Illinois-based producer of software for Prime computers.

====Marc Software====
Marc Software International, Inc. of Palo Alto, California produced WordMARC word processing software for Prime computers.

====Computer Techniques (Queo)====
While Prime&#x27;s PRIMOS operating system supported one or more compilers/interpreters for COBOL, FORTRAN, BASIC, RPG and 2 Assemblers, Queo was a step up: a procedural language more compact than COBOL, and with additional capabilities.

It was offered by Computer Techniques, Inc. of Olyphant, Pa. Queo later was reimplemented for PCs.

====Office Automation System====
Prime acquired the OAS application from its developer, ACS America Inc., a now-defunct New York City software house.

It competed in the UK DTI Office Automation Pilot, but did not win.

OAS included electronic mail and word processing. Electronic mail use was initially restricted to a single minicomputer. Much later, Prime released email that worked with multiple Prime computers in a network, and a synchronised global directory system. Word processing was available either on dumb terminals like the PT25, PT45 and PST100, or on the partially intelligent PT65 terminal. The PT65 had to download the word processing software from the host minicomputer whenever the terminal was turned on. The terminal allowed the user to work on one page at a time, which was periodically saved to the minicomputer. This &quot;intelligent workstation&quot; concept for word processing was similar to the functions of popular systems from rival Wang Laboratories. Prime&#x27;s intelligent workstation for word processing was faster because it used RS232C cabling runs instead of the coaxial links that Wang&#x27;s systems used. Nonetheless, the word processing was not of the highest quality, and the PT65 was subject to software errors that scrambled the documents being worked on.

OAS also had a bilingual language lookup feature, sometimes marketed as machine translation.

Recognising the drawbacks of the downloadable WP workstation, Prime formed an agreement with Convergent Technologies for their AWS which Prime named the &quot;Prime Producer 100&quot; (launched in mid 1983) and later for Convergent&#x27;s modular NGEN, clip together system, the &quot;Prime Producer 200&quot; (launched in 1984), each of which had far superior WP to the initial Prime offering, and were document-based.

In the UK, Prime had a very active OAS User Group whose suggestions were acted upon in new product development. UK Pioneers of the system included the London Docklands Development Corporation and Oxford Polytechnic, now Oxford Brookes University.

====Prime Information====
Both the Pick environment and Prime Information were based on the Generalized Information Retrieval Language System (GIRLS), developed by Richard Pick for the American Department of Defense.

Devcom, a Microdata reseller, wrote a Pick-style database system called INFORMATION in FORTRAN and assembler in 1979 to run on Prime Computer 50-series systems. INFO/BASIC, a variant of Dartmouth BASIC, was used for database applications. It was then sold to Prime Computer and renamed Prime INFORMATION.

Unlike the Pick operating system, a complete operating system, Prime Information was not an operating system, but a 4GL system that ran from the Prime PRIMOS operating system.

Prime Information was a re-implementation which deliberately left out some features and added others. Prime Information allowed rapid 4GL or 4GL-like development of applications around relational or quasi-relational database structures. After a series of evolutions and acquisitions Prime Information is now an obsolete part of the Rocket U2 software suite.

====Prime Information Connection====
In , Prime developed a system to conflict with OAS and confuse the market. Prime Information Connection added word processing to Prime Information, giving the company two office oriented suites to offer in a marketplace dominated by Wang Laboratories.

===CAD/CAM===
Prime originally entered the CAD industry through Ford. At the time, Ford was using Control Data Corporation (CDC) stand-alone computers. Data was shared via reel tape and stored in &quot;Data Collector&quot; rooms at each facility. Ford began looking for a small computer that had all the advantages of the CDC computers, but could also connect to a network.

Prime’s 2250 (&quot;Rabbit&quot;) offered the combination Ford was looking for in a package smaller than the original CDCs. In addition, the PRIMOS operating system would run unaltered across all Prime platforms; from the 2250 up to 750 (what would be considered today as a server). As a result, the Data Collector (rooms) would contain several 750 class machines, each with rows of CDC 300 or 600 MB drives. Primenet (Token Ring) network connected all CAD stations in a building with its Data Collector.

Ford pushed PDGS out to its suppliers and engineering contractors throughout the northern Midwest.

Prime gained expertise over the years with its collaboration with Ford and continued to expand into the CAD market with its Medusa product. With the acquisition of ComputerVision, Prime appeared to be a formidable force in the CAD/CAM industry.

Prime Medusa versions 5 and CV Medusa 7 were merged/recombined into a product that was called Medusa version 12. Prime also picked up Calma CAD systems from GE.

==Electronic messaging==
Electronic messaging was developed on &quot;relay.prime.com&quot;, which was the hub that relayed global electronic mail for Prime Computer. The software used on this computer system, PDN Mail, developed by Robert Ullmann, was designed to use the encoding header field that was later explained in a Request for Comments. PDN Mail was also used by Microsoft Corporation until MIME was introduced.

Before MIME existed, PDN Mail was able to perform the same functions and was used to send software updates as well as all sorts of attachments between systems. In August 1993, Robert Ullmann, David Robinson and Al Costanzo wrote RFC 1505. This RFC, documented the Encoding Header Field for Internet Messages that PDN mail used and was published by the RFC editor, Jon Postel that same year.

==Marketing==

A series of memorable advertisements created by Australian artist Rone Waugh in 1980 featured actors Tom Baker and Lalla Ward as their characters from the TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. All four of these adverts have since been included on the DVD release of the 1979 serial &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot; in which both actors appear.

<text>The Amtrak &quot;Cascades&quot; is a passenger train route in the Pacific Northwest, operated by Amtrak in partnership with the U.S. states of Washington and Oregon. It is named after the Cascade mountain range that the route parallels. The corridor runs from Vancouver, British Columbia, through Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, to Eugene, Oregon.

, seven round trips operate along the corridor each day: one Vancouver–Seattle, one Vancouver–Seattle–Portland, three Seattle–Portland, and two Seattle–Portland–Eugene. No train travels the entire length of the corridor. For trains that do not travel directly to Vancouver or Eugene, connections are available on Amtrak Thruway bus services. Additionally, Amtrak Thruway services offer connections to other destinations in British Columbia, Idaho, Oregon, and Washington not on the rail corridor.

In the fiscal year 2017, &quot;Cascades&quot; was Amtrak&#x27;s eighth-busiest route with a total annual ridership of over 810,000. In fiscal year 2018, farebox recovery ratio for the train was 63%. On-time performance in FY2021 was 58.7%.

== History ==

===Prior service===
Passenger train service between Seattle and Portland—the core of what became the &quot;Cascades&quot; corridor—was operated as a joint partnership by the Northern Pacific, Great Northern, and Union Pacific from 1925 to 1970, with the three railroads cross-honoring tickets on their Seattle-Portland routes. When Great Northern and Northern Pacific were folded into the Burlington Northern in 1970, the reconfigured partnership continued to operate the Seattle-Portland service until the creation of Amtrak in 1971. Service between Vancouver, British Columbia, and Seattle was provided via the Great Northern / Burlington Northern &quot;International,&quot; and between Portland and Eugene by Southern Pacific.
===Amtrak era===

Amtrak took over intercity passenger rail operations from the private railroads on May 1, 1971. Initial service on the Seattle–Portland portion of the corridor consisted of three daily round trips–one long-distance train running all the way to San Diego, along with two corridor trains inherited from Burlington Northern. There was no corridor service south to Eugene, and no service to the Canadian border at all. The trains were unnamed until November 1971, when the two corridor trains were named the &quot;Mount Rainier&quot; and &quot;Puget Sound&quot; and the long-distance train became the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;.

Passenger rail service to Vancouver, British Columbia, was restarted on July 17, 1972, with the inauguration of the Seattle–Vancouver &quot;Pacific International&quot;, which operated with a dome car (unusual for short runs). The train was Amtrak&#x27;s first international service.

The next major change to service in the corridor came on June 7, 1977, when Amtrak introduced the long-distance &quot;Pioneer&quot; between Seattle, Portland and Salt Lake City, Utah. To maintain the same level of service between Seattle and Portland, the &quot;Puget Sound&quot; was eliminated, and the schedule of the &quot;Mount Rainier&quot; was shifted.

The corridor expanded south of Portland to Eugene on August 3, 1980, with the addition of the &quot;Willamette Valley&quot;, which operated with two daily round trips, financially subsidized by the State of Oregon. The &quot;Pacific International&quot; and &quot;Willamette Valley&quot; struggled to attract riders and were discontinued in September 1981 and December 1981, respectively.

This left three trains on the Seattle–Portland corridor: the regional &quot;Mount Rainier&quot; and the long-distance &quot;Pioneer&quot; and &quot;Coast Starlight.&quot; This level of service would remain unchanged for 13 years.

=== Expansion in the 1990s ===

In 1994, Amtrak began a six-month trial run of modern Talgo equipment over the Seattle–Portland corridor. Amtrak named this service &quot;Northwest Talgo&quot;, and announced that it would institute a second, conventional train on the corridor (supplementing the &quot;Mount Rainier&quot;) once the trial concluded. Regular service began on April 1, 1994.

Looking toward the future, Amtrak did an exhibition trip from Vancouver through to Eugene. Amtrak replaced the &quot;Northwest Talgo&quot; with the &quot;Mount Adams&quot; on October 30. At the same time, the state of Oregon and Amtrak agreed to extend the &quot;Mount Rainier&quot; to Eugene through June 1995, with Oregon paying two-thirds of the $1.5 million subsidy.

Service to Canada returned on May 26, 1995, when the &quot;Mount Baker International&quot; began running between Vancouver and Seattle. The state of Washington leased Talgo equipment similar to the demonstrator from 1994. The &quot;Mount Rainier&quot; was renamed the &quot;Cascadia&quot; in October 1995; the new name reflected the joint Oregon–Washington operations of the train. A temporary commuter rail service using Amtrak trains was deployed in September 1997 between Union Station in Portland and Vancouver station during a full closure of the Interstate Bridge for repairs. The free trains had ten round trips and drew an average of 1,335 passengers per day; the low ridership was attributed to the isolated location of Vancouver&#x27;s station.

A third Seattle–Portland corridor train began in the spring of 1998 with leased Talgo equipment, replacing the discontinued long-distance &quot;Pioneer&quot;. The other Seattle–Portland/Eugene trains began using Talgo trainsets as well, while the Seattle-Vancouver train used conventional equipment. In preparation for the Vancouver route receiving Talgo equipment as well, Amtrak introduced the temporary &quot;Pacific Northwest&quot; brand for all four trains, dropping individual names, effective with the spring 1998 timetable.

===Amtrak &quot;Cascades&quot;===

Amtrak announced the new Amtrak &quot;Cascades&quot; brand in the fall 1998 timetable; the new equipment began operation in December. The full &quot;Cascades&quot; brand was rolled out on January 12, 1999, following a six-week delay due to an issue with the seat designs on the Talgo trainsets. Amtrak extended a second train to Eugene in late 2000.

From the mid-1990s to the May 12, 2008, Amtrak system timetable, full service dining was available on trains going north out of Seattle&#x27;s King Street Station to Vancouver. The southern trains to Portland briefly had full dining services until the May 16, 1999, system timetable.

In 2004, the &quot;Rail Plus&quot; program began, allowing cross-ticketing between Sound Transit&#x27;s Sounder commuter rail and Amtrak between Seattle and Everett on some &quot;Cascades&quot; trains.

The corridor continued to grow, with another Portland–Seattle train arriving in 2006, and the long-awaited through service between Vancouver, British Columbia, and Portland, eliminating the need to transfer in Seattle, beginning on August 19, 2009 as a pilot project to determine whether a train permanently operating on the route would be feasible. With the Canadian federal government requesting Amtrak to pay for border control costs for the second daily train, the train was scheduled to be discontinued on October 31, 2010. However, Washington State and Canadian officials held discussions in an attempt to continue the service, which resulted in the Canadian government permanently waiving the fee.

Two additional round trips between Seattle and Portland were added on December 18, 2017; an early morning departure from each city and a late evening return, enabling same-day business travel between the two cities. On the first day of service of the new timetable, a train derailed outside of DuPont, Washington, south of Tacoma. Service resumed using the old timetable without the additional round trips.

===Pandemic cuts and restoration===

In March 2020, &quot;Amtrak Cascades&quot; service north of Seattle was suspended indefinitely after all non-essential travel across the Canada–United States border was restricted in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Amtrak crews ran practice trips between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia, in February 2022, and service between those two cities resumed on September 26, 2022. The round trip between Portland and Vancouver resumed on March 7, 2023, restoring the second Seattle–Vancouver trip that existed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Seattle–Portland service expanded to six round trips on December 11, 2023, adding the two additional round trips between Seattle and Portland originally intended to start in 2017.

In 2025, the completion of a new customs inspection area at Vancouver&#x27;s Pacific Central Station will allow &quot;Cascades&quot; trains to eliminate a secondary inspection stop in Blaine that is performed by U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers. The modified customs procedure is expected to save 10 minutes on southbound trips. A new maintenance facility at the Seattle Yard is scheduled to open in late 2026.

==Route==
===Stations and Connections===
==Operations==

The &quot;Cascades&quot; primarily uses freight tracks that are owned by BNSF Railway in Washington and British Columbia, and the Union Pacific Railroad in Oregon. In British Columbia, Canadian National Railway operates the tracks between the Vancouver terminus and the New Westminster Bridge for BNSF, and it operates the bridge itself for the Canadian federal government. Sound Transit owns a short section of tracks in Washington on the Point Defiance Bypass. In fiscal year 2023, the trains had an on-time percentage of 64percent, among the worst rates for state-supported Amtrak routes.

==Ridership==
Total ridership for 2008 was 774,421, the highest annual ridership since inception of the service in 1993. Ridership declined in 2009 to 740,154 but rose 13% in fiscal year 2010 to 836,499 riders, and to 847,709 riders in 2011.

Ridership declined steadily between 2011 and 2015, attributed in part to competition from low-cost bus carrier BoltBus, which opened a non-stop Seattle–Portland route in May 2012. Low gasoline prices and schedule changes due to track construction also contributed to the decline. Ridership rose again in 2016, and was expected to continue rising in 2017 and beyond, after the completion of the Point Defiance Bypass construction project. However, ridership declined again following the 2017 Washington train derailment, and the COVID-19 pandemic drastically reduced ridership numbers throughout the entire Amtrak network in 2020.

Ridership on the &quot;Cascades&quot; corridor reached a record high of over 941,000 passengers in 2024, a 41 percent increase from 2023.

== Rolling stock ==

Service on the &quot;Cascades&quot; route is currently provided using equipment from Amtrak&#x27;s national fleet, along with two articulated trainsets manufactured by Talgo. These cars are designed to passively tilt into curves, allowing the train to pass through them at higher speeds than a conventional train. The tilting technology reduces travel time between Seattle and Portland by 25 minutes. Current track and safety requirements limit the train&#x27;s speed to , although the trainsets are designed for a maximum design speed of .

A typical trainset consists of 13 cars:
one baggage car;
two &quot;business class&quot; coaches;
one lounge car (also known as the Diner car);
one cafe car (also known as the Bistro car);
seven &quot;coach class&quot; coaches; and
one combination cab/power car (which houses a driver&#x27;s cab, a head-end power generator and other equipment).
 Trainsets are typically paired with a Siemens Charger locomotive painted in a matching paint scheme. Additionally, trainsets without a cab car are paired with a Non-Powered Control Unit (NPCU), an older locomotive with no engine, that is also painted in a matching paint scheme and is used as a cab car.

The fleet consists of two Talgo Series 8 trainsets built in 2013. These trainsets operated alongside five older Talgo Series VI trainsets until their retirement in 2020. The service offered by the different trainset types is similar, but there are some minor differences between the two models. The most notable difference is the older Series VI trainsets have tail fins at both ends of the train that serve as an aesthetic transition from the low-profile trainsets and the larger locomotives. The Series 8 trainsets do not have the tail fins, but instead have a cab built into the power car allowing push-pull operation without a separate control unit. There are also minor differences in the interior appointments.

The &quot;Cascades&quot; service started in Fall 1998 with four Series VI trainsets, two were owned by the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) and two were owned by Amtrak. Each trainset was built with 12 cars and a six-car spare set, including a baggage car, service car, lounge car, café car and two &quot;coach class&quot; coaches, was also built. The trainsets can hold 304 passengers in 12 cars.

In 1998, Amtrak also purchased an additional Series VI trainset as a demonstrator for potential service between Los Angeles and Las Vegas. This trainset was built with two additional &quot;coach class&quot; coaches, for a total of 14 cars. The demonstration route was not funded and WSDOT purchased the trainset in 2004 to expand service. The purchase also allowed Amtrak and WSDOT to redistribute the &quot;coach class&quot; coaches. By using the two additional coaches from this new trainset and placing the two coaches from the spare set into regular service, the agencies were able to create four 13-car trains and one 12-car train.

In 2013, the Oregon Department of Transportation (ODOT) purchased the two Series 8 trainsets to enable further expansion of services. Each trainset was equipped with 13 cars.

The &quot;Cascades&quot; equipment is painted in a special paint scheme consisting of colors the agency calls &quot;Evergreen&quot; (dark green), &quot;Castilian Copper&quot; (brown), &quot;Nugget&quot; (tan) and &quot;Double Latte&quot; (cream). The trainsets are named after mountain peaks in the Pacific Northwest (many in the Cascade Range). The four original Series VI trainsets were named after Mount Baker, Mount Hood, Mount Olympus, and Mount Rainier. The Series VI trainset built to operate between Las Vegas and Los Angeles (painted in Surfliner colors) was renamed the Mount Adams when it was purchased by the state of Washington. This trainset was subsequently destroyed in the December 18, 2017, derailment on the Point Defiance Cutoff. The two Series 8 trainsets are named Mount Bachelor and Mount Jefferson.

In early 2014, the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT), awarded a contract to Siemens USA to manufacture 8 new Siemens Charger locomotives for the &quot;Cascades&quot;. The order was part of a larger joint purchase between Illinois, California, Michigan, and Missouri. These locomotives were delivered to WSDOT in Summer 2017 and went into service in late 2017. The additional locomotives were to have enabled two additional runs to be added as part of the Point Defiance Bypass project (the additional service was suspended and its recommencement has not been announced) and will replace the six EMD F59PHI locomotives leased from Amtrak; these were sold to Metra in early 2018. One SC-44 locomotive was destroyed in the December 18, 2017, derailment on the Point Defiance Cutoff, but was soon replaced by a newly built Charger by Siemens (1408) in August 2020. In the wake of the accident, Amtrak proposed to lease or buy two Talgo trainsets which were originally bought for use in Wisconsin but never operated.

In August 2019, the Federal Railroad Administration awarded WSDOT up to $37.5 million to purchase three new trainsets for the route, allowing the replacement of the older Talgo VI trainsets. The Talgo VI trainsets were withdrawn in June 2020. As a temporary replacement, Horizon cars are being used alongside the existing Talgo Series 8 sets, until new cars are introduced. The last two remaining Talgo VI trainsets were hauled to a scrapper on February 28, 2021. One Series VI Bistro car, No. 7304, was later acquired by the Northwest Railway Museum in 2023.

Amtrak and Siemens Mobility announced a $7.3 billion national railcar order in July 2021, which includes funding for 48 new Siemens Venture coaches and 2 additional Charger locomotives for &quot;Cascades&quot; service. Deliveries are expected to begin in 2024, with service expected to begin in 2026 after funding is approved by Congress. These trainsets will be used to replace the Talgo VI trainsets retired in 2020, as well as to expand service. The new coaches will be used in six-coach trainsets with a capacity of 300 passengers, far more than the capacity of the Talgo trainsets, and will be able to modify trainset lengths based on expected passenger demand. The new coaches are expected to cost WSDOT $150 million, of which $75 million has been secured as of July 2021. Additional funding is expected from the federal government, as well as potentially the governments of Oregon and British Columbia. The eight new trainsets will use a new livery that includes imagery of Mount Rainier and Mount Hood; it is primarily green with brown and white as accent colors.

== Funding ==

Funding for the route is provided separately by the states of Oregon and Washington, with Union Station in Portland serving as the dividing point between the two. , the Washington state government funds six daily round trips between Seattle and Portland and two daily round trips between Seattle and Vancouver, British Columbia. Oregon funds two daily round trips between Eugene and Portland. The seven trainsets are organized into semi-regular operating cycles, but no particular train always has one route.

=== Local partnerships ===
As a result of &quot;Cascades&quot; service being jointly funded by the Washington and Oregon departments of transportation, public transit agencies and local municipalities can offer a variety of discounts, including companion ticket coupons.
* FlexPass and University of Washington UPass holders receive a 15% discount (discount code varies) on all regular &quot;Cascades&quot; travel. Employers participating in these programs may also receive a limited number of free companion ticket coupons for distribution to employees.
* The Sound Transit RailPlus program allows riders to use weekday &quot;Cascades&quot; trains between Everett and Seattle with the Sounder commuter rail fare structure.

The &quot;Cascades&quot; service also benefits from Sound Transit&#x27;s track upgrades for &quot;Sounder&quot; service, notably the Point Defiance Bypass project.

The &quot;Cascades&quot; corridor is also served by Amtrak Thruway buses that are partially funded by the Washington state government and contracted out to MTRWestern. Amtrak introduced its first battery electric bus on the &quot;Cascades&quot; service in August 2023.

== Proposed changes ==
According to its long-range plan published in 2006, the WSDOT Rail Office plans eventual service of 13 daily round trips between Seattle and Portland and 4–6 round trips between Seattle and Bellingham, with four of those extending to Vancouver, British Columbia. Amtrak Cascades travels along the entirety of the proposed Pacific Northwest High Speed Rail Corridor; the incremental improvements are designed to result in eventual higher-speed service. According to WSDOT, the &quot;hundreds of curves&quot; in the current route and &quot;the cost of acquiring land and constructing a brand new route&quot; make upgrades so cost-prohibitive that, at most, speeds of 110 mph (177 km/h) can be achieved.

The eventual high-speed rail service according to the long-range plan should result in the following travel times:
* Seattle to Portland – 3:30 (2006); 3:25 (after completion of Point Defiance Bypass); 2:30 (planned)
* Seattle to Vancouver, British Columbia – 3:55 (2006); 2:45 (planned)
* Vancouver, British Columbia, to Portland – 7:55 (2009); 5:25 (planned)

In order to increase train speeds and frequency to meet these goals, a number of incremental track improvement projects must be completed. Gates and signals must be improved, some grade crossings must be separated, track must be replaced or upgraded, and station capacities must be increased. The existing Columbia River Railroad Bridge between Vancouver, Washington and Portland would have to be modified, and an additional railroad bridge would have to be built next to the existing bridge.

In order to extend the second daily Seattle to Bellingham round trip to Vancouver, BNSF was required to make track improvements in Canada, to which the government of British Columbia was asked to contribute financially. On March 1, 2007, an agreement between the province, Amtrak, and BNSF was reached, allowing a second daily train to and from Vancouver. The project involved building an siding in Delta, British Columbia, at a cost of US$7 million; construction started in 2007 and has been completed.

In December 2008, WSDOT published a mid-range plan detailing projects needed to achieve the midpoint level of service proposed in the long-range plan.

In 2009, Oregon applied for a $2.1 billion Federal grant to redevelop the unused Oregon Electric Railway tracks, parallel to the Cascades&#x27; route between Eugene and Portland. But it did not receive the grant. Instead, analysis of alternative routes to enable more passenger trains and higher speeds proceeded. In 2015, the current route, with numerous upgrades, was chosen by the Project Team as the Recommended Preferred Alternative. The Preferred Alternative, if built, would decrease the trip time by 15 minutes from 2 hours and 35 minutes to 2 hours and 20 minutes and increase the number of daily trains from 2 to 6 from Eugene to Portland.

In 2013, travel times between Seattle and Portland remained the same as they had been in 1966, with the fastest trains making the journey in 3 hours 30 minutes. WSDOT received more than $800 million in high-speed rail stimulus funds for projects discussed in the mid-range plan, since the corridor is one of the approved high-speed corridors eligible for money from ARRA. The deadline for spending the stimulus funds is September 2017. The schedule was for the Leadership Council to vote on this in December 2015, then a Draft Tier 1 Environmental Impact Statement was to be released in 2016 and hearings held on it, for the Leadership Council to finalize the Recommended Selected Alternative in 2017, then publish the Final Tier 1 EIS and receive the Record of Decision in 2018. Then if funds can be found, design and engineering must be done before any construction can begin.

In October 2023, WSDOT made public a summary of its preliminary service development plan, which offered five conceptual options for future rail service. Three of the options kept the top train speed at , while the other two options increased the top speed to . The most aggressive frequency option increased the number of round trips between Seattle and Portland to 16 and the number between Vancouver, British Columbia, and Seattle to 6. Four of the options included a rail/bus combination for some round trips between Vancouver and Seattle; the section between Seattle and Bellingham would be served by rail, while the section between Bellingham and Vancouver would be handled by bus. The assumed maximum top speed was reduced from in the 2006 long range plan to in the 2024 preliminary service development plan based on BNSF restrictions.

Various jurisdictions have made attempts to add a stop within the approximately gap between Vancouver, British Columbia, and Bellingham. The intent was to better serve the growing population in the southern part of the Greater Vancouver region without requiring a backtrack to downtown Vancouver. Infill stations have been proposed on separate occasions at the international border towns of Blaine, Washington, and White Rock, British Columbia, which both had stops on Amtrak&#x27;s predecessor &quot;Pacific International&quot; service. There have also been studies about relocating the northern terminus from Vancouver&#x27;s Pacific Central Station southeast to SkyTrain&#x27;s existing Scott Road station in Surrey, British Columbia; in this scenario, northbound passengers would then ride the SkyTrain rapid transit system for about a half-hour to complete a trip to downtown Vancouver.

In 2024, a Canadian passenger rail advocacy group recommended that the Canadian government make 10 infrastructure improvements between White Rock and Vancouver at a total estimated cost of CAD$127.6 million. These improvements would increase operational performance and reliability, and the resulting reduction in travel time would permit Amtrak to add a Blaine stop.

==Accidents and incidents==

===July 2017 derailment===
On July 2, 2017, northbound train 506 derailed while approaching the Chambers Bay drawbridge southwest of Tacoma, Washington. The train was traveling above the speed limit of after passing an &quot;Approach&quot; signal (indicating that it be prepared to stop short of the next signal) at the bridge. As the bridge was raised and open, a device known as a &quot;de-rail&quot; was engaged, used to prevent a train from proceeding and falling in to the water by derailing it beforehand. The incident root cause was human error due to the engineer losing situational awareness. Only minor injuries were sustained due to the low speed at time of event as the engineer did attempt to stop on seeing the bridge up. The train&#x27;s consist, an Oregon DOT-owned Talgo VIII set, was returned to the Talgo plant in Milwaukee, Wis. for repairs and returned to service in April 2018.

===December 2017 derailment===

On December 18, 2017, while making the inaugural run on the Point Defiance Bypass, southbound train 501 derailed near DuPont, Washington. Three passengers were killed, and 65 people in total were injured. The crash occurred on an overpass over I-5, on a sharp curve with a speed limit of ; train 501 was traveling at . Positive train control, a system that would have prevented the train from speeding, was not yet enabled on the Point Defiance Bypass at the time of the crash. An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board also found that the train&#x27;s engineer was not properly trained on either the tracks or the train&#x27;s Siemens Charger locomotive, both of which were new at the time.

WSDOT announced that it would not resume service until the full implementation of PTC. Service was then scheduled to restart in early 2019. PTC was activated on the Point Defiance Bypass in March 2019, but &quot;Cascades&quot; service on the bypass did not resume until November 18, 2021, almost four years after the derailment.

<doc id="905555" wikidata="Q420496" url="?curid=905555" title="Antiserum">
<text>In immunology, antiserum is a blood serum containing antibodies (either monoclonal or polyclonal) that is used to spread passive immunity to many diseases via blood donation (plasmapheresis). For example, convalescent serum, passive antibody transfusion from a previous human survivor, used to be the only known effective treatment for ebola infection with a high success rate of 7 out of 8 patients surviving.

Antisera are widely used in diagnostic virology laboratories. The most common use of antiserum in humans is as antitoxin or antivenom to treat envenomation.

Serum therapy, also known as serotherapy, describes the treatment of infectious diseases using the serum of animals that have been immunized against the specific organism or components of that organism.

== History ==
In 1890, Emil Behring and Kitasato Shibasaburō published their first paper on serum therapy.

Behring had pioneered the technique, using guinea pigs to produce serum. Based on his observation that people who survived infection with the diphtheria bacterium never became infected again, he discovered that the body continually produces an antitoxin, which prevents survivors of infections from being infected again with the same agent.

It was necessary for Behring to immunize larger animals in order to produce enough serum to protect humans, because the amount of antiserum produced by guinea pigs was too little to be practical. Horses proved to be the best serum producer, as the serum of other large animals is not concentrated enough, and horses were not believed to carry any diseases that could be transferred to humans.

Due to the First World War, a large number of horses were needed for military purposes. It was difficult for Behring to find enough German horses for his serum facility. He chose to obtain horses from Eastern European countries, mostly Hungary and Poland. Because of Behring&#x27;s limited financial resources, most horses he selected had been intended for slaughter; however, the usefulness of the animal to others had no influence on the production of serum. Serum horses were calm, well-mannered, and in good health. Age, breed, height, and color were irrelevant.

Horses were transported from Poland or Hungary to the Behring facilities in Marburg, in the west-central part of Germany. Most of the horses were transported by rail and treated like any other freight load. During the interminable border crossing, horses were left at the mercy of the weather. Once the horses arrived in Marburg, they had three to four weeks to recover in a quarantine facility, where data on them was recorded. They had to be in perfect medical condition for the immunization, and the quarantine facility ensured that they were free of microbes which could infect the other horses. In the Behring facilities, the horses were viewed as life savers; therefore, they were well treated. A few of the individual horses used for serum production were named, and celebrated for their service to medicine, both human and non-human.

At the end of the 19th century, every second child in Germany was infected with diphtheria, the most frequent cause of death in children up to 15 years. In 1891 Emil Behring saved the life of a young girl with diphtheria by injecting antiserum for the first time in history. Serum horses proved to be saviors of diphtheria-infected people. Subsequently, treatment of tetanus, rabies, and snake venom developed, and proactive protective vaccination against diphtheria and other microbial diseases began.

In 1901, Behring won the first Nobel Prize in Medicine for his work in the study of diphtheria.

Serum therapy became increasingly prevalent for infectious diseases, and was even used to treat patients during the influenza pandemic in 1918. Its uses were then quickly expanded to also treat diseases such as polio, measles, pneumococcus, Haemophilus influenza B, and meningococcus. In the 1920s, Michael Heidelberger and Oswald Avery proved that antibodies were proteins that targeted the capsule of the virus or bacteria.

The discovery of antibiotics in the 1940s diminished interest in treating bacterial infections with antiserum, but its use for viral infections continued with the development of ethanol fractionation of blood plasma (which allowed for purified antibodies), discovered by Edwin Cohn. Antisera were developed to prevent and/or treat diphtheria, tetanus, Hepatitis B, rabies, varicella zoster virus, cytomegalovirus, and botulinum. However, these were not widely used.

In 1984, Milstein and Köhler won a Nobel Prize for their paper that described their method for making murine monoclonal antibodies by immortalizing B cells as hybridomas. Another breakthrough occurred in 2003. A new technology allowed for heavy and light chain immunoglobulin genes to be amplified from human B cells and cloned into expression vectors. In 2008, this method was refined with a greater ability to sort cells and clone, which led to the discovery of more human monoclonal antibodies.

In 1996, the FDA approved the use of RSV-IGIV (Respigam), a polyclonal antibody drug to inhibit respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) for high-risk newborns. This was considered a breakthrough, as the clinical trial was proven to reduce infant hospitalizations by 41% and length of hospital stays by 53%. After two years the product demand began to exceed the supply of plasma and Synagis, the first humanized monoclonal antibody was approved in its place. Monoclonal antibodies became advantageous due to their decreased variability in quality, a decreased risk of bloodborne diseases, and increased potency. This enabled a large expansion of the usages of antiserum and opened the door for the treatment of autoimmune diseases.

The past 30 years have seen the transformation of how chronic and autoimmune diseases (e. g. cancer, ulcerative colitis) are treated, with 30 drugs—28 of which for chronic conditions—with monoclonal antibodies being approved. Monoclonal antibodies are currently being researched to treat viral diseases without vaccines, such as HIV, SARS, and MERS.

==Modern use==
Monoclonal antibodies are used to treat both acute and chronic conditions. Acute conditions may include, but are not limited to Ebola virus, envenomation (e. g. snake bites), and anthrax infection. Chronic conditions may include, but are not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and lupus.

There are four main types of monoclonal antibodies. They are murine, chimeric, humanized, and human.

Murine monoclonal antibodies are identified with the suffix &quot;-omab&quot;. They originate from murine animals and can trigger allergic reactions in humans. An example of a murine monoclonal antibody is blinatumomab, which is used to treat acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Chimeric monoclonal antibodies are identified with the suffix &quot;-ximab&quot;. They originate partially from a murine animal and partially from a human. An example of a chimeric monoclonal antibody is infliximab, which is used to treat Crohn disease.

Humanized monoclonal antibodies are identified with the suffix &quot;-zumab&quot;. They mostly originate from a human but differ in the component that attaches to its target. An example of a humanized monoclonal antibody is crizanlizumab, which treats sickle cell disease.

Human monoclonal antibodies are identified with the suffix &quot;-umab&quot;. They originate from a human. An example of a human monoclonal antibody is ustekinumab, which treats psoriasis.

During the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, reliable treatment options had not yet been found or approved. In reaction, convalescent blood plasma was considered as a possibility and is used as a treatment option at least for severe cases. In May 2021, India was one of the first major country to remove plasma from its national COVID-19 guidelines. This was after public criticism of the lack of plasma&#x27;s effectiveness, criticism of health systems, and persuasion by leading Indian scientists including Shahid Jameel, Soumyadeep Bhaumik, Gagandeep Kang, Soumitra Pathare, and others. The World Health Organization recommended against use of plasma in COVID-19 in December 2021.

Monoclonal antibodies (casirivimab/imdevimab) were developed for the treatment of COVID-19.

On June 7, 2021, the FDA approved aducanumab, the first anti-Alzheimer&#x27;s drug to be introduced into markets almost 20 years after approval of memantine in 2003.

==How it works==
Antibodies in the antiserum bind the infectious agent or antigen. The immune system then recognizes foreign agents bound to antibodies and triggers a more robust immune response. The use of antiserum is particularly effective against pathogens which are capable of evading the immune system in their unstimulated state but are not robust enough to evade the stimulated immune system. The existence of antibodies to the agent depends on an initial survivor whose immune system, by chance, discovered a counteragent to the pathogen or a host species which carries the pathogen but does not experience its effects. Further stocks of antiserum can then be produced from the initial donor or from a donor organism that is inoculated with the pathogen and cured by some stock of pre-existing antiserum. Diluted snake venom is often used as an antiserum to give passive immunity to snake venom itself.

Horses that were infected by a pathogen were vaccinated thrice in increasing sizes of the dose. The time between each vaccination varied from each horse and its health condition. Normally the horses needed a few weeks to produce the serum in the blood after the last vaccination. Even though they tried to empower the immune system of the horses during this immunization with painstaking care, most of the horses experienced appetite loss, fever, and in worse cases shock and dyspnea.

The highest immunization risk for horses was the production of antiserum for snake venom.

The horse was immunized with all types of snake poison at the same time because it was not always possible to know by which snake species a person had been bitten. Therefore, the serum had to immunize the subject against the venom of every snake species.

In order to find the moment when most antitoxins in the blood cells of the horses is produced, frequent blood samples were taken from the horses. At the point when the highest amount of antibodies were produced, five liters of blood, a tenth of the blood volume of a horse, were taken through a cannula.

The blood was collected in a glass cylinder and brought to the laboratory in the Behring facilities. Above the rouleaux formation which contained the red blood cells, the serum was visible. The color of the serum varied from milky to brown.

Concentration and sterility of the serum were checked carefully, and the serum was filtered many times. Protein content was decreased in order to use the serum for humans.

After the blood sampling, the horses could rest for three to four weeks and received extra food to recover the blood loss. In this period the horses were especially weak and prone to disease and infection.

Within a few years, with experience and observation of the horses, a rouleaux formation of the blood sample was placed back into the animal&#x27;s body. This procedure is called plasmapheresis.

<doc id="905574" wikidata="Q1064143" url="?curid=905574" title="Charles Doughty-Wylie">
<text>Lieutenant Colonel Charles Hotham Montagu&quot;Richard&quot;Doughty-Wylie, (23 July 1868 – 26 April 1915) was a British Army officer and an English recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces. Doughty-Wylie had been awarded the Order of the Medjidie from the very Ottoman Government he later fought against. He was generally known as Richard.

==Early life==
Charles Hotham Montagu Doughty was the eldest son of Henry Montagu Doughty of Theberton Hall, Suffolk, and Edith Rebecca Doughty, . A younger brother was Henry Montagu Doughty. His father&#x27;s brother was Charles Montagu Doughty, author of &quot;Travels in Arabia Deserta&quot;.

Doughty was educated at Winchester College. He graduated from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst in 1889. His military career included the Chitral Expedition of 1895 and the 1898 Occupation of Crete, between and after which he was posted in Sudan serving with Lord Kitchener in the Mahdist War (1898–99). In 1899 he took part in the final defeat of the Khalifa as brigade major to the Infantry Brigade with the flying column, and was mentioned in despatches. He next served in the Second Boer War, then suppressing the Boxer Rebellion (1900) and in Somaliland (1903–04), where he commanded a unit of the Somaliland Camel Corps.

He married in 1904 a nurse Lilian Oimara Adams, daughter of John Wylie and widow of Lieutenant Henry Adams. He adopted the surname Doughty-Wylie to incorporate his wife&#x27;s maiden name.

==Turkish Revolution==
Colonel Doughty-Wylie was the Acting British Vice-Consul at Konieh and Mersina, Ottoman Empire, during the Young Turk Revolution of 1909. Richard Bell-Davies (later a VC recipient, then a lieutenant on the battleship ) met him at the time and gives an account in his autobiography &quot;Sailor in the Air&quot; (1967).

Massacres of Armenians in Mersina started along with the revolution, and Bell-Davies says that it was largely due to the efforts of Doughty-Wylie that these were halted. Doughty-Wylie then went to Adana, forty miles away, where he persuaded the local Vali (Governor) to give him a small escort of Ottoman troops and a bugler; with these he managed to restore order. Mrs. Doughty-Wylie turned part of the dragoman&#x27;s house into a hospital for wounded Armenians. Bell-Davies says that by the time an armed party from &quot;Swiftsure&quot; arrived, Doughty-Wylie had again almost stopped the massacre single-handedly. Newspaper reports of the period record that Doughty-Wylie was shot in the arm while trying to prevent the Adana massacres. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1909 Birthday Honours in recognition of his services during the disturbances in Asia Minor.

In 1913, Doughty-Wylie was the recipient of the Order of the Medjidie (Second Class) from the Ottoman Government. He was awarded the Medjidie &quot;in
recognition of valuable services rendered by him while in charge of the British Red Cross Hospitals in Turkey&quot; during the Balkan Wars.

==First World War==
Doughty-Wylie was 46 years old, and a lieutenant colonel in The Royal Welch Fusiliers, British Army when, &quot;owing to his great knowledge of things Turkish&quot; according to Bell-Davies, he was attached to General Sir Ian Hamilton&#x27;s headquarters staff of the Mediterranean Expeditionary Force during the Gallipoli Campaign.

On 26 April 1915, following the landing at Cape Helles on the Gallipoli peninsula of the SS &quot;River Clyde&quot;, Lieutenant Colonel Doughty-Wylie and Captain Garth Neville Walford organised and made an attack through and on both sides of the village of Sedd-el-Bahr on the Old Fort at the top of the hill. The enemy&#x27;s position was very strongly entrenched and defended, but mainly due to the initiative, skill and great gallantry of the two officers the attack was a complete success. However, both Doughty-Wylie and Walford were killed in the moment of victory; Doughty-Wylie was shot in the face by a sniper, and died instantly.

Doughty-Wylie is buried close to where he was killed, immediately north of Sedd-el-Bahr, opposite the point at which the SS &quot;River Clyde&quot; came ashore. His grave is the only solitary British or Commonwealth war grave on the Gallipoli peninsula: The Turkish authorities moved the graves of all other foreign soldiers to the &quot;V Beach&quot; graves except for his.

His Victoria Cross, posthumously awarded for bravery during a beach landing at Gallipoli in April 1915, is displayed at the Royal Welch Fusiliers Museum in Caernarfon Castle, Gwynedd, Wales. Damaged plating from the &quot;River Clyde&quot; can be seen in the Royal Hampshire Regiment Museum in Winchester, England.

==Personal life==
Doughty-Wylie, a married man, had an unconsummated affair with Gertrude Bell with whom he exchanged love letters from 1913 until his death. Bell was an eminent English writer, traveller, political officer, administrator, and archaeologist who explored in the region of Syria, Mesopotamia, Asia Minor, and Arabia. Doughty-Wylie was a member of the Naval and Military Club from 1900 until his death.

His wife, Lilian, reportedly was the only woman on the Allied side to visit Gallipoli during the campaign, when she went to lay a wreath on his grave on 17 November 1915. She was awarded the Royal Red Cross (First Class) in the 1919 New Year Honours for her work as matron at Limenaria Hospital, Thasos, Greece.
She died in Cyprus in 1961 at the age of 83.

==Legacy==
Doughty-Wylie is commemorated outside St Peter&#x27;s Church in Theberton, Suffolk where his name is recorded on the war memorial. Inside the church he is depicted as St George in a stained glass window by T. F. Curtis of Ward and Hughes. A road in the village is named Doughty-Wylie Crescent. He is named on the Winchester College War Cloister, the war memorial at Winchester College.

Damian Lewis played him in &quot;Queen of the Desert&quot; (2015), a biographical drama film based on the life of Gertrude Bell. He was voiced by Pip Torrens in &quot;Letters from Baghdad&quot;, a 2016 documentary on Bell.

<text>Susan Marie Nattrass, (born November 5, 1950) is a Canadian trap shooter and medical researcher in osteoporosis. She was born in Medicine Hat, Alberta. Competing at an elite international level from the 1970s through the 2010s, Nattrass has had multiple appearances, in one or both of trap or double trap, at Olympic Games, Commonwealth Games, World Championships, and Pan American Games. Nattrass is a repeat World Champion and repeat medalist at the Commonwealth Games, World Championships, and Pan American Games. She was the flag bearer for Canada at the 2007 Pan American Games (and a gold medal winner) and the 2014 Commonwealth Games.

As of the 2012 Olympics, Nattrass is one of only 122 athletes (and one of only 46 still active), all sports, to compete in at least six Olympic Games, appearing in 1976, &#x27;88, &#x27;92, 2000, &#x27;04 and &#x27;08. She won a gold medal at the World Championships in 1974, &#x27;75, &#x27;77, &#x27;78, &#x27;79, &#x27;81, and 2006.

==Beginnings==
She was introduced to trap shooting by her father Floyd Nattrass, who competed for Canada at the World Championships in 1958 and 1968 and at the Olympics in 1964. Nattrass said of her father:
&quot;While other kids would go to the lake for the summer, we always went to trap shoots. My dad started when I was 5; we&#x27;d go to shoots, and I did everything I could do be a part of it. Then when I turned 12, he taught me how to shoot.&quot;

==Olympics and Commonwealth Games==
In the 1976 Summer Olympics she became the first ever woman to participate in a shooting event at the Olympics, as shooting was open to both sexes until 1992. She won a silver medal at the 2001 world championships in Cairo, Egypt in the trap event. She finished 9th in the 2000 Summer Olympics and 6th in the 2004 Summer Olympics in women&#x27;s trap shooting.

At the 2006 Commonwealth Games Nattrass won three medals: two silver in women&#x27;s double trap pairs and women&#x27;s trap pairs and a bronze in women&#x27;s trap.

She won the Trap Shooting event at the World Championships in 1981 and 2006, twenty-five years apart.

After the 1996 Summer Olympics, the International Shooting Union decided to discontinue the trap and skeet shooting events for women and instead allow women to compete in the double trap, where two clay saucers are thrown simultaneously. This is a difficult transition that Nattrass - who won two World Cups in the double trap in 1993 - equated to a downhill skier having to switch to cross-country. She led a campaign - writing letters, doing surveys, playing politics - against the decision to remove the two events. After five years, the campaign succeeded and women&#x27;s skeet and trap shooting remained in the Olympics.

In 1981, she was awarded the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canadian Athlete of the Year and was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. She is also listed as a recipient of the Vanier Award for Outstanding Young Canadians.

She has travelled around the world at various competitions for over three decades, nearly always accompanied by her mother and coach Marie.

 Nattrass serves on the board of directors, Sections Chairs of the Shooting Federation of Canada.

==Education and research==
Nattrass earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in Physical Education from the University of Alberta in 1972 and a Masters in 1974, and has since been an instructor, administrator, lecturer and consultant in physical education and sports psychology. In between her first and second Olympic appearances in 1976 and 1988, she earned her doctorate from the University of Alberta in 1987.

Since 1996, Nattrass has lived on Vashon Island near Seattle. She moved there when she joined the Pacific Medical Center as a medical researcher in September 1996. She owns and runs the Puget Sound Osteoporosis Center, where she studies the effects of aging in bones on active sportswomen in their forties and older, takes part in clinical trials, and provides pro-bono screenings in the community.

<doc id="905580" wikidata="Q6246244" url="?curid=905580" title="John Mackenzie (VC)">
<text>Major John Mackenzie, VC, DCM (22 November 1871 – 17 May 1915) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Details==
Mackenzie was 29 years old, and a sergeant in the 2nd Battalion, The Seaforth Highlanders (Ross-shire Buffs, Duke of Albany&#x27;s), British Army, employed with the West African Field Force during the Third Ashanti Expedition when the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC.

On 6 June 1900 at Dompoassi, Ashanti (now Ghana), Sergeant Mackenzie, after working two Maxim guns under heavy fire and being wounded while doing so, volunteered to clear the stockade of the enemy. This he did, most gallantly, leading the charge himself and driving the enemy headlong into the bush.

==Further information==
John Mackenzie enlisted in the Seaforth Highlanders in August 1887, and served with the regiment in India, including the 1895 Chitral Expedition. Promoted corporal in May 1897, he was seconded for service in West Africa in November that year, where he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. He became a sergeant in March 1899. 

John Mackenzie was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Black Watch on 29 November 1900 and became a captain in the Royal Scots on 22 January 1904. During this time he also served on attachment with the Northern Nigeria Regiment. He was mentioned in dispatches for his work during the Aro Expedition (November 1901 to March 1902); also in 1906 when he was staff officer of the Munster Field Force and once more during the Kano-Sokoto Expedition.

He was promoted to major in April 1914 and was commanding officer of the 2nd Battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment, where at Festubert on 17 May 1915, when leading his men, he was killed just after he had left the jumping off trench.

Major Mackenzie is buried in the Guards Cemetery, Windy Corner, Cuinchy, in Northern France.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Regimental Museum of Queens Own Highlanders, Fort George, Inverness-shire, Scotland. His pipe banner is located in the Royal Scots Museum at Edinburgh Castle.

<text>Rehoboth () is the name of three biblical places.

== Rehoboth (well)==
According to &quot;Easton&#x27;s Bible Dictionary&quot; (1893–97), &quot;(a) well in Gerar dug by Isaac (), supposed to be in Wady er-Ruheibeh, about 32 km (20 miles) south of Beersheba.&quot; Isaac gave it the name Rehoboth, which means &quot;open spaces&quot;. Isaac&#x27;s servants had dug two wells and the herdsmen of Gerar quarrelled because of these two wells with Isaac&#x27;s herdsmen. So when they dug the third well and there were no quarrels, Isaac named it Rehoboth, saying, &quot;Now the Lord has given us room, and we will flourish in the land.&quot;

== Rehoboth by the river ==
Rehoboth by the river was an ancient city from which came the Edomite king Saul in Genesis 36:37; ). Since &quot;the River&quot; in the Bible generally is used to mean the Euphrates, scholars have suggested either of two sites near the junction of the Khabur River and the Euphrates. However, this would be a place far outside the Edomite territory. The river mentioned could be a river in Edom such as the Zered (now the Wadi al-Hasa) in Jordan. Rehoboth could be identical with a site southeast of the Dead Sea.

== Rehoboth-Ir ==
Rehoboth-Ir was a biblical town named in Genesis as among those founded by Nimrod. Its exact geographic location is unknown. Rehoboth-Ir may possibly have been in the vicinity of the town of Nineveh. However, its name is identical to the Hebrew phrase &quot;&quot;rehovot ir&quot;, meaning &quot;streets of the town&quot; or &quot;public square of the town&quot;, which may refer to Nineveh itself, rather than the name of a distinct town.

<doc id="905585" wikidata="Q1010357" url="?curid=905585" title="Findochty">
<text>Findochty (pronounced , , ) is a village in Moray, Scotland, on the shores of the Moray Firth; historically it was part of Banffshire. The Gaelic name of the village was recorded by Diack using his own transcription method as &quot;fanna-guchti&quot;, which is of unclear meaning. One of the earliest references to Findochty is in 1440, when the king granted Findachtifeild to John Dufe, son of John Dufe. The lands passed from the Duffs to the Ogilvies of Findlater, and subsequently, in 1568, the Ord family acquired the manor, port, custom, and fishers&#x27; lands of Findochty, and later built the House of Findochty, known as Findochty Castle, now a ruin, which stands to the west of the village. In 1716 the Ords brought 13 men and 4 boys from Fraserburgh under contract to fish from Findochty, and for a time the harbour was busy with landings of herring and white fish. Findochty expanded as a fishing port through the 1700s and 1800s, and by 1850 was home to 140 fishing boats. But the expansion in the late 1800s of nearby Buckie provided a better harbour, and some of the fishing fleet had left Findochty by 1890. Findochty harbour is now used mostly by pleasure craft and is a good sun spot when the tide is out. A local artist, Correna Cowie, created a statue in 1959 of a seated fisherman, known as &quot;The White Mannie&quot;, who watches over the harbour.

In addition to characteristic painted cottages, a white-painted Church of Scotland church, and a scenic harbour overlooked to the west by the local war memorial, the village has basic amenities including a pub, a small supermarket, a pharmacy and a post office. There is a caravan site at the west of the village, behind The Admirals pub. The caravan park looks out onto a rock formation known as Edindoune and a bay past which schools of Moray Firth dolphins can sometimes be seen. For sailors, there is a marina and pontoons. The harbour is well protected from the elements by sturdy quays, one of which is topped with a small disused lighthouse.

The people of Findochty speak in the Scots dialect of Doric and the accent can be thick and hard to understand for outsiders.

In 1901, old animal bones taken to be made into implements, were discovered in a cave found in the cliff near the present bowling green. Horn spoons and needles without eyes and even a broken lignite armlet were found. The bones were dated as possibly prehistoric to middle age, but they have since been lost. The cave was destroyed within a few months of discovery by subsequent quarrying for rock to build local houses and roads.

To the east of the village the cliffs rise toward Tronach Head, honeycombed with caves and inlets. Clifftop paths link Findochty with the neighbouring village of Portknockie and West to Strathlene on the outskirts of Buckie in the other direction.

The cliffs are the home to myriad seabirds. There are substantial rock formations such as the &quot;Priest Craigs&quot;, and the &quot;Horses Head&quot;. West of the village lies the 18 hole Strathlene golf course, bounded to the north by coastal footpaths and low cliffs, making the errant drive from some tees particularly costly. At the south side of the course lies the road linking Findochty to Portessie and Strathlene. Adjacent to this can be seen the remains of Findochty castle. Access to the castle is not normally permitted as it is located in the midst of a working farm.

Many of the villagers work in the oil and gas industry - as is true of much of the surrounding area - due mainly to the downturn in the Scottish fishing industry over the last 30 – 40 years and the area&#x27;s relative proximity to Aberdeen.

It is said that the original fishermen came from Fraserburgh which is known as &quot;The Broch&quot;. In 1716 The Broch was Burghead. The harbour at Burghead was ruined by the sea just before then. 1716 is also the year after the 
1st Jacobite uprising. Maybe some of the folk were hiding from King George&#x27;s army.

==Churches==
There are a number of churches in this small village, including Church of Scotland, Salvation Army, &amp; Methodist congregations. There are also the Christian Brethren at Chapel Street, and at the Station Road Hall - which has an annual Bible Conference every September drawing Christians from all parts of the British Isles and many overseas countries.

<doc id="905586" wikidata="Q4709475" url="?curid=905586" title="Albedo Anthropomorphics">
<text>Albedo Anthropomorphics, or Albedo for short, is a furry comic book anthology series which was credited with starting the furry comic book subgenre that featured sophisticated stories with talking animals primarily intended for an adult audience. The first issue of &quot;Albedo&quot; was published in 1983; the most recent issue was published in 2005.

&quot;Albedo&quot; was started by Steve Gallacci (pronounced /ɡʌˈlɑt͡ʃi/), who produced its main feature, Erma Felna: EDF—a sophisticated science fiction military series set in a sector of space populated by sapient and predominantly humanoid versions of mammal and avian species. The focus of the series is Erma Felna, a young feline officer who eventually plays a central role in the complex political conflicts that consume her universe.

Gallacci was a technical illustrator for the United States Air Force, and one feature of &quot;Albedo&quot; is its well thought-out and illustrated vehicles. His experience also shows in the realistic treatment of military life and operations.

The series was used as inspiration for the &quot;Albedo&quot; role-playing game, which has had three editions and multiple supplements.

==Features==
===Erma Felna: EDF===
&quot;Erma Felna: EDF&quot; was set in a futuristic period in a sector of civilized outer space populated by sapient and predominantly humanoid versions of over 150 various mammalian and avian species. Although the civilization has advanced technical skills and political structure, the residents of this region have realized that they have no knowledge of their origins or past, nor any culture or arts to speak of beyond the structures necessary to maintain operational systems.

The title character is Erma Felna, a young cat who is an officer of the Extraplanetary Defense Force (EDF), the main military of the Interstellar Confederacy or ConFed for short. The series follows her adventures in part as she fulfills a career that would make her a revered name as &quot;The Protector of the Rim&quot;, in the region&#x27;s history despite sexist opposition.

The ConFed is challenged by a rival and ruthless enemy called the Independent Lapine Republic (ILR) which is populated by a species of supremacist rabbits who favor taking colonies and settled areas by force. To defeat their militarily stronger enemy, the ILR is engaging in socio-political warfare intended to undermine the ConFed citizenry&#x27;s confidence in their government&#x27;s stability and ability to protect them.

This strategy is made evident in the opening battle of the series when the ILR invades the ConFed planet of Derzon. Once the Republic seizes the planet, they deliberately deploy their troops in such a manner that defeating them requires the EDF inflict the maximum unavoidable amount of collateral damage and civilian casualties, intending to increase ConFed civilian resentment of their own government&#x27;s actions.

In addition, there are internal and growing ConFed corruption and attacks by nihilistic terrorists who commit acts of violence for their own sake to shake societal complacency. A derelict ship that contains a body of a human is eventually discovered which reveals vital clues about the civilization.

====Reception====
The series drew considerable attention for its unique use of talking animals which featured characters engaged in sophisticated stories with a highly political nature, like novels such as &quot;A Very British Coup&quot;. For instance, after an action scene, the characters would often discuss the socio-political ramifications of the events in question and struggle to decide what to do in response.

====Characters====
*Erma Felna: The main character of &quot;Albedo&quot;. Female officer in the EDF, born SD 171–01–22 (30 years old), Annianport, Annah (Dornthant II). Fur color is a light gold-brown, slightly paler in the front, scalp hair is dark red-brown, and eyes green gold. She shares her family&#x27;s rare female genetic trait of vaguely humanlike head hair. Erma joined the EDF mainly because her father, Kanoc, was seriously tortured by the ILR.
*Toki: a Danetti (from the planet Danet) mouse femme is a friend and confidant to Erma Felna. She is a staff officer for the Extra-Planetary Defense forces (EDF). Toki has large soft ears, very expressive eyes, a well-rounded figure, and is very outgoing and free with her attentions.

====Online version====
In 2016 Gallacci began posting the original &quot;Erma Felna: EDF&quot; comic pages online as a webcomic, alongside other works.

===Others===
Other features in the series have included:
* &quot;High Orbit&quot;
* Matt Howarth&#x27;s &quot;Konny and Czu&quot;
* &quot;Space Wolf&quot;
* The first episodes of Stan Sakai&#x27;s &quot;Usagi Yojimbo&quot;
* &quot;Watchrats&quot;

==History==
The title was originally self-published by Gallacci through his own company called Thoughts &amp; Images. When the company folded, Antarctic Press resumed the title for several years, both in a black-and-white series and a short-lived color one. The series moved to Shanda Fantasy Arts in 2004, which produced two issues of the continuing series before it went on indefinite hiatus in 2005.

An RPG by the same name, based on the Erma Felna storyline, was produced by Chessex in 1989 and 1993. The concept was re-engineered in 2003 by Sanguine Productions.

There was also an associated short-lived fan magazine, &quot;Refractions&quot;, which carried original artwork, stories, and discussions of the cultures shown in the &quot;Erma Felna, EDF&quot; universe. Steve Gallacci contributed new material and cover art for each, but most material came from other sources. Published by R&#x27;ykandar Korra&#x27;ti/Low Orbit Publications in the 1990s, the series ran only three issues; a fourth was tentatively announced, but cancelled for lack of original material after the end of the color &quot;Albedo&quot; run.

<text>The Coast Starlight is a long-distance passenger train operated by Amtrak on the West Coast of the United States between Seattle and Los Angeles via Portland and the San Francisco Bay Area. The train, which has operated continuously since Amtrak&#x27;s formation in 1971, was the first to offer direct service between Seattle and Los Angeles. Its name is a combination of two prior Southern Pacific (SP) trains, the &quot;Coast Daylight&quot; and the &quot;Starlight&quot;.

During fiscal year (FY) 2019, the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; carried 426,029 passengers, an increase of 2.0% from FY 2018. In FY 2016, the train had a total revenue of $40.5 million, a decrease of 1.4% from FY 2015.

==History==

===Background===

Before the formation of Amtrak, no passenger train ran the entire length of the West Coast. The closest equivalent was the Southern Pacific Railroad (SP)&#x27;s &quot;West Coast&quot;, which ran via the San Joaquin Valley from Los Angeles to Portland from 1924 to 1949, with through cars to Seattle via the Great Northern Railway (GN).

By 1971, the SP operated just two daily trains between Los Angeles and the San Francisco Bay Area: the Los Angeles–San Francisco &quot;Coast Daylight&quot; via the Coast Line, and the Los Angeles–Oakland &quot;San Joaquin Daylight&quot; via the Central Valley. The SP also operated the tri-weekly &quot;Cascade&quot; between Oakland and Portland, Oregon. The Burlington Northern Railroad (BN) and Union Pacific Railroad ran three daily round trips between Portland and Seattle. The Santa Fe ran the &quot;San Diegan&quot; between Los Angeles and San Diego.

===Amtrak era===

The Seattle–San Diego route was initially left out of plans for Railpax (later Amtrak) until protests from politicians in California, Oregon, and Washington. With the start of Amtrak operations on May1, 1971, a single train began running between Seattle and San Diego. The unnamed train (#11/12) ran three days a week; on the other four days, another unnamed train (#98/99) ran between Oakland and Los Angeles. On November 14, Amtrak extended the Oakland–Los Angeles train to San Diego, renumbered it to #12/13, and renamed it Coast Daylight. The Seattle–San Diego train became the Coast Daylight/Starlight (#11-12) northbound and Coast Starlight/Daylight (#13-14) southbound. Both trains were cut back from San Diego to Los Angeles in April 1972, replaced by a third &quot;San Diegan&quot;. On June10, 1973, Amtrak began running the combined &quot;Coast Daylight/Starlight&quot; daily for the summer months. Positive response led to Amtrak to retain this service, and the &quot;Coast Daylight&quot; name was dropped on May19, 1974.

An additional train, the &quot;Spirit of California&quot;, ran the section of the route between Sacramento and Los Angeles on an overnight schedule from October25, 1981, to September30, 1983. From November10, 1996, to October25, 1997, through coaches were transferred between the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; and &quot;San Diegan&quot; at Los Angeles.

The &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; originally used the Southern Pacific West Valley Line between Tehama and Davis. That route included a stop at Orland, but bypassed Sacramento. On April26, 1982, the train was rerouted via Roseville on the Southern Pacific Valley and Martinez Subdivisions, with stops added at Sacramento, Chico, and Marysville, per request from the state. In 1999, the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; was rerouted onto the more direct ex-Western Pacific Sacramento Subdivision between Marysville and Sacramento, with the Marysville stop closed.

Ridership declined by 26% between 1999 and 2005 as freight congestion and track maintenance on the Union Pacific Railroad reduced the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot;″s on-time performance to 2%, which Amtrak characterized as &quot;dismal.&quot; By mid-summer in 2006 delays of 5–11 hours were common. Critics dubbed the train the &quot;Star-late&quot;. During early summer 2008, the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; was relaunched with new amenities and refurbished equipment. In July 2008, refurbished Pacific Parlour cars returned to service as part of the relaunch. This was much anticipated, due to the success of Amtrak&#x27;s relaunch of the &quot;Empire Builder&quot;. Between FY 2008 and FY 2009, ridership on the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; jumped 15% from 353,657 passengers to 406,398 passengers. Operating conditions on the UP improved as well; by May 2008 on-time performance had reached 86%.

Service was suspended north of Sacramento for a month in 2017 after a freight derailment damaged a bridge near Mount Shasta, California.

On February24, 2019, the southbound &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; struck a fallen tree near Oakridge, Oregon after a rare heavy snowstorm. The train was stranded for 36 hours before tracks could be cleared for a Union Pacific locomotive to tow the train back to Eugene–Springfield.

From October1, 2020, to May24, 2021, daily service was reduced to three trains per week due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On May24, 2021, as part of its post-COVID service restorations, Amtrak restored the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; frequency to daily service in both directions.

In late June 2021, the Lava Fire seriously damaged a Union Pacific trestle on the Black Butte Subdivision between Klamath Falls, Oregon and Dunsmuir, California. As a result, the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; was initially split into two segments: Seattle to Klamath Falls and Sacramento to Los Angeles with a bus replacement service filling the gap between Klamath Falls and Sacramento. However, on July2, 2021, it was announced that service would be discontinued between Seattle and Sacramento until July14, 2021, with Amtrak Cascades replacing service for passengers booked between Seattle and Eugene. Through service resumed on July15 using overnight buses between Sacramento and Klamath Falls, and full-route train operation resumed on August23.

A resurgence of the COVID-19 virus caused by the Omicron variant caused Amtrak to reduce the frequency of this route to five-weekly round trips from January to March 2022.

Trains began running over the Point Defiance Bypass between Tacoma and DuPont, Washington starting on November18, 2021.

===Future improvements===

The 2018 California State Rail Plan, prepared by Caltrans, outlines a number of planned improvements to rail infrastructure in the state of California. The plan was updated in 2023. In 2022, the California Transportation Commission approved $7.5 million for the construction of a new station in King City to improve access to the region, including nearby Fort Hunter Liggett and Pinnacles National Park. There is also a proposal in the Capitol Corridor Vision plan to improve the right-of-way shared by the &quot;Capitol Corridor&quot; and &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; between Oakland and Martinez. The proposal would re-route the train from along the shores of San Pablo Bay and the Carquinez Strait to a new tunnel through Franklin Canyon and a right-of-way next to California State Route 4 that would reduce the trip time by several minutes.

== Route ==

Except for two sections, most of the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; route is on former Southern Pacific lines now owned by the Union Pacific Railroad. The &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; runs over the following lines:
*BNSF Seattle Subdivision (ex-NP, later ex-BN): Seattle, Washington to Tacoma, Washington
*Sound Transit (SDRX) Point Defiance Bypass: Tacoma to DuPont, Washington
*BNSF Seattle Subdivision: DuPont to Portland, Oregon
*UP Brooklyn Subdivision: Portland to Eugene, Oregon
*UP Cascade Subdivision: Eugene to Klamath Falls, Oregon
*UP Black Butte Subdivision: Klamath Falls to Dunsmuir, California
*UP Valley Subdivision: Dunsmuir to Marysville, California
*UP Sacramento Subdivision (ex-WP): Marysville to Sacramento, California
*UP Martinez Subdivision: Sacramento to Oakland, California
*UP Niles Subdivision: Oakland to Elmhurst, California
*UP Coast Subdivision: Elmhurst to Santa Clara, California
*Caltrain (JPBX) Peninsula Subdivision: Santa Clara to Tamien, California
*UP Coast Subdivision: Tamien to San Luis Obispo, California
*UP Santa Barbara Subdivision: San Luis Obispo to Moorpark, California
*Metrolink (SCAX) Ventura Subdivision: Moorpark to Taylor Yard, Los Angeles
*Metrolink (SCAX) River Subdivision: Taylor Yard to Los Angeles Union Station

The &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; is occasionally diverted between Oakland and Los Angeles via the Central Valley and Tehachapi Pass due to track work or service disruptions on the Coast Line. These rerouted trains are popular with railfans because they use the Tehachapi Loop, which has not had regularly-scheduled passenger trains since 1971.

=== Stations===
== Equipment ==

The &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; typically uses two GE P42DC or Siemens ALC-42 locomotives. The train uses double-decker Superliner equipment, including a Sightseer Lounge car that has floor-to-ceiling windows to view the passing scenery. , a typical consist has a Viewliner baggage car, a transition sleeper, two sleeping cars, two coaches, one coach/baggage car, the lounge car, and a dining car.

Prior to February 2018, the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; was unique in that it included a first-class lounge car called the &quot;Pacific Parlour Car&quot;. The cars were Budd Hi-Level Sky Lounge cars, built in 1956 for the Santa Fe&#x27;s &quot;El Capitan&quot; service. Called a &quot;living room on rails&quot;, the Parlour car offered several amenities to first-class sleeping car passengers including wireless Internet access, a full bar, a small library with books and games, an afternoon wine tasting, and a movie theater on the lower level. Sleeping car passengers could also make reservations to dine in the Parlour car, which offered a unique menu not offered in the standard dining car. In February 2018, in a cost-cutting measure, Amtrak retired the Pacific Parlour Cars, citing the move as &quot;part of Amtrak&#x27;s ongoing work to modernize its fleet of equipment.&quot;

<doc id="905600" wikidata="Q844871" url="?curid=905600" title="ESP Guitars">
<text>is a Japanese guitar manufacturer, primarily focused on the production of electric guitars and basses. They are based in both Tokyo and Los Angeles, with distinct product lines for each market. ESP Company manufactures instruments under several names, including &quot;ESP Standard&quot;, &quot;ESP Custom Shop&quot;, &quot;LTD Guitars and Basses&quot;, &quot;Navigator&quot;, &quot;Edwards Guitars and Basses&quot;, and &quot;Grassroots&quot;.

== History ==


In 1975, Hisatake Shibuya opened a shop called Electric Sound Products (ESP) in Tokyo, Japan, which provided custom replacement parts for guitars. At this time, ESP also began making guitars under the ESP and Navigator brand in the Japanese market.

ESP replacement parts were first introduced into the US in 1983 and began crafting custom instruments for local New York artists between 1984 and 1985. Among these artists were Vernon Reid (Living Colour), Vinnie Vincent and Bruce Kulick (KISS), Sid McGinnis of &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and Ronnie Wood (The Rolling Stones). At this time, ESP also introduced the 400 Series as the first production line to be distributed in the US.

During this same period, ESP began making the bodies and necks for Kramer Guitars and other manufacturers were using ESP as an OEM such as Robin Guitars, Schecter Guitar Research and DiMarzio. Many traits of the Kramer line are still visible including neck construction and body bevels. ESP tooled up for Tom Anderson&#x27;s shaved bolt on neck heel on the Schecter bodies and this has since become a feature of their house brand.

In 1985, George Lynch discovered ESP while on tour in Tokyo. Lynch walked into an ESP shop looking for a replacement neck and learned that ESP also built custom guitars. As a result, his famous ESP Kamikaze was made and ESP released George Lynch&#x27;s Kamikaze as its first signature model. ESP soon introduced the M1 Standard, MI Custom, Horizon Custom, and the Surveyor bass.

At this time, ESP based its headquarters in a loft in downtown New York City on 19th Street. In 1989, the headquarters were moved to 48th Street near other music stores.

Between 1990 and 1992, ESP expanded its Signature Series as well as its standard product line. The US replacement parts business was discontinued in order to focus solely on their guitar and bass line, as well as the Custom Shop series. There are about 41 signature series guitars.

In 1993, ESP moved its headquarters again but this time to Los Angeles, on Sunset Blvd. in Hollywood. In 1995, the LTD series was created to produce ESP&#x27;s high-quality products at a more affordable price. Soon after the introduction of the Korean and Indonesian-made LTD lines, ESP stopped selling the majority of its Japanese-made flagship guitars in the United States, due to the high prices involved in exporting to the Americas. The lone exception was ESP&#x27;s artist signature series, which remained ESP (rather than LTD) models. In the early 2000s (decade), ESP resumed exporting the standard Japanese-made lines to the United States (where they are popular among heavy metal and hard rock players), though at greatly increased prices compared to the early 1990s.

Similarly to Ibanez, ESP&#x27;s chief competitor in Japan, ESP was initially known for making high-quality and customized replicas of famous American guitars, including hot rodded Strats and Teles, as well as Gibson Explorers. The Explorer model, (known as the EXP/MX), shot to fame when avid ESP user James Hetfield&#x27;s band Metallica rose to popularity in the late 80s/early 90s. Models similar to Hetfield&#x27;s black ESP even today sell for thousands of dollars beyond the original retail price. However, just like with Ibanez, when the Gibson company realized the extent to which ESP was denting into sales of its own guitars, it filed a suit to prevent sales of these guitars in the Americas. ESP redesigned its lines to be less similar to the American models. 

In 2002, ESP was ranked among the music industry&#x27;s fastest-growing companies. This is largely due to the Fender buyout of Jackson Guitars, who ESP had struggled to compete with throughout the 1980s and 1990s. After the buyout, many Jackson endorsers switched over to ESP. Some of these artists who left Jackson for ESP included Dave Mustaine (Megadeth, now using Gibson Guitars), as well as Adam Darski (Behemoth), Alexi Laiho and Roope Latvala (Children of Bodom), Jeff Hanneman (Slayer), Galder and Silenoz (Dimmu Borgir).

ESP introduced its Xtone line, beginning with the semi-hollow Paramount Series. In 2005, ESP celebrated its 30th anniversary and released James Hetfield&#x27;s &quot;Truckster&quot; into its Signature Series. In 2006, ESP showcased 22 of its newest Signature Series and Standard Series models at Winter NAMM 2006. The Standard Series included models such as the ESP LTD EC-500 and the ESP LTD B-500. Among the signature artists showcasing their newest ESP models and signing autographs at the ESP booth were Dave Mustaine, George Lynch, Stephen Carpenter (Deftones), Michael Wilton and Page Hamilton.

As of March 2015, ESP began distributing Takamine Guitars in the United States. 

Hisatake Shibuya died on late September 2024 at age 87. 

== Manufacturing operations ==

Original series and Custom Shop ESPs are handcrafted in Japan while the Standard Series ESPs are factory-made in Japan.

In 1996, ESP started its &quot;LTD&quot; series. are more affordable and cater mainly for markets outside Japan. The 1000 series LTDs are made on an assembly line in Korea whereas the 401 series and below are made in Indonesia.

LTD basses are instruments mainly aimed at beginners. Over the years manufacturing has moved between various locations, including Vietnam, China and Indonesia. Intermediate models were manufactured in Korea in the early 2000s (decade). The quality from these has led to continued demand for the LTD series.

Additionally, ESP has two separate Japan-only lines of guitars, the Grassroots (lower end) and Edwards (Mid-range). The Grassroots line is manufactured in Korea and are the equivalent or better than the Sub-400 series LTDs and can be considered a budget line. The Edwards guitars, on the other hand, the final setup is made in Japan but the bodies and painting are made in China (except for very few Edwards models that are made in Japan, but those are the exception to the rule) and boast similar hardware as their higher-end ESP counterparts but are not handcrafted. In terms of quality, in contrast to the USA lines (i.e. ESP Standard &amp; LTD), the Edwards line generally lies in between the more upmarket LTDs and ESP Standards.

ESP guitars cater to a wide range of players. There are a variety of models including Superstrat-styled guitars, Les Paul-styled guitars, Flying V-styled, Star-shaped and others. ESP technically has two lines, one for USA and Japan, but there are slight differences. The ESP USA line doesn&#x27;t include the Strat-like Snapper, the Forest GT, as well as some of the Japanese rock artist models but their custom line has been known to produce some of the most unusual designs such as a &quot;Gundam&quot; Beam-rifle replica guitar, as well as the &quot;ESP Machinegun&quot; used by the Japanese band Alfee.

ESP not only make guitars, they also produce various hardware parts themselves, like bass bridges or the ESP Flicker tremolo, ESP Labs Pickups, as well as sustainers, equalizers, etc. Usually these parts are only available for OEM use and not to the ordinary customer.

ESP found fame by making and endorsing guitars for guitarists who went on to become leading exponents of thrash metal in the 1980s, along with other guitar manufacturers Jackson and Dean, with bands Metallica, Slayer, Anthrax and Megadeth. As a result of these endorsements, ESP has become one of the most popular suppliers of guitars for heavy metal. ESP instruments are endorsed by musicians numbering in the hundreds. A complete list of them can be found on the Artists section of ESP Guitars&#x27; website.

The bass signatures by J, founder of Luna Sea, are one of the most influential models manufactured by ESP, with over 50,000 copies sold. From the same band, Sugizo also contributed significantly to the brand with his design ideas.

== Guitars and bass series ==
Dependent on the target market (i.e. Asia, US, Europe) and brand (ESP, LTD or Xtone), various models are organized in marketing series.

The ESP Original series has three other lines of guitars, the Edwards, Grassroots and Navigator series and are largely based on these models as well as some ESP Standard series Models. ESP Edwards Series produces mid-to-high range guitars, at a quality near the ESP Standard series, whilst ESP Grass Roots Series cater towards a more value-oriented segment of the market and are more akin to the 400 series of LTDs, however these can vary. The ESP Navigator Series on the other hand is a line which produces mainly replicas of Gibson and Fender guitars and basses, to a very high standard.

ESP USA features the ESP Standard line (which was replaced in 2014 by E-II), as well as the lower end LTD and Xtone series. ESP USA&#x27;s standard series generally caters more towards to metal players, with characteristics such as active pickups.

Another line of guitars, called LTD Elite, was introduced in 2013 for overseas markets, as the ESP Standard line was slowly being phased out. LTD Elite guitars are made in Japan, and initially offered alongside the ESP standard replacement brand E-II in the export market in 2013 while a limited range of ESP Standards were sold in the US to be phased out for E-II in 2014. The ESP Standard line had been completely discontinued by this time. E-II guitars initially resembled several Edwards designs, however in 2015 many new models and finishes not available to Edwards were released. In 2016, E-II receives many new and first-time models, including Eclipse guitars with a sculpted neck joint similar to Gibson&#x27;s Axcess heel to improve playability. According to ESP, E-II is the direct successor to ESP Standard with no difference between the two except the name.

ESP Custom series

ESP also builds custom guitars and basses, made to the specifications of the customer and the quality of such custom guitars exceed that of the Original series. These can be ordered from ESP USA but they are made in Japan. Generally speaking custom guitars cost as much, or even more than Navigators depending on the choices of the consumer and are considered to cater for the top-end of the market. There is flexibility with the orders, as the guitars produced, do not have to be based on existing lines of guitars and basses.

ESP Artist series

The ESP Artist, or Signature series guitars are mass-produced versions of artist&#x27;s personal guitars and basses. The quality of the ESP Artist/Signature models lie between Navigator/Custom Shop and the ESP Original series.

The Edwards, Grassroots and LTD artist models are in the higher-end segments of the respective lines of guitars and basses.

<text>Gerar ( &quot;Gərār&quot;, &quot;lodging-place&quot;) was a Philistine town and district in what is today south central Israel, mentioned in the Book of Genesis and in the Second Book of Chronicles of the Hebrew Bible.

==Identification==
According to the International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, the biblical &quot;valley of Gerar&quot; () was probably located in the area of a valley known in Arabic as Wady Sheri&#x27;a, and in Modern Hebrew as Nahal Gerar. Most commentators see the mound of Tel Haror (Hebrew) or Tell Abu Hureyra (Arabic) as representing the ancient Gerar.

Some older commentaries, such as Smith&#x27;s Bible Dictionary, stated simply that Gerar was located &quot;south of Gaza&quot;. Also, a ninth century rabbinical source, Saadia Gaon, identified Gerar with Haluza, which is located along the Besor Stream in the Negev. However, according to recent archaeological research, Haluza only dates to the period of the Nabataean Kingdom.

==Biblical accounts==
Biblically, the town features in two of the three wife-sister narratives in Genesis. These record that Abraham and Isaac each stayed at Gerar, near what became Beersheba, and that each passed his wife off as his sister, leading to complications involving Gerar&#x27;s Philistine king, Abimelech. (, and )

The &quot;Haggadah&quot; identifies the two references to Abimelech as two separate people, the second being the first Abimelech&#x27;s son, and that his original name was Benmelech [&quot;son of the King&quot;], but he changed his name to his father&#x27;s, meaning &quot;my father is king&quot;.

In 2 Chronicles 14:12-15, Gerar and its surrounding towns figure in the account of King Asa&#x27;s defeat of Zerah&#x27;s vast Cushite forces.

<doc id="905614" wikidata="Q7803086" url="?curid=905614" title="Tim Anderson (programmer)">
<text>Tim Anderson is an American computer programmer best known for co-creating the adventure game &quot;Zork&quot;, one of the first works of interactive fiction and an early descendant of &quot;ADVENT&quot; (also known as &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;).

==Career==
While attending MIT, Anderson got his start in game development by developing the game &quot;Trivia&quot; (1976) alongside future collaborator Marc Blank for the DEC PDP-10, the school&#x27;s mainframe, playable over ARPANET. &quot;Trivia&quot; proved itself popular with the limited userbase of ARPANET, leading Anderson and Blank, as well as Bruce Daniels and Dave Lebling to collaborate on a new game. All four were members of the Dynamic Modeling Group at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, with all but Blank working by day writing software for DARPA, which afforded them access to MIT&#x27;s mainframe, even after they had graduated. The team had spent a considerable amount of time working on solving the game &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;, mostly referred to at that time as simply &quot;Adventure&quot;. The team enjoyed &quot;Adventure&quot;, but found themselves frustrated with the limited interface of the game, specifically its two-word command structure. Bolstered by their earlier experience writing games for the PDP-10, the team set out to create what would eventually become &quot;Zork&quot;. Originally developed from 1977 to 1979 in the MDL programming language for the PDP-10, &quot;Zork&quot; would prove immensely popular on ARPANET. After the success of &quot;Zork&quot; on its limited platform, Anderson and the other members of the team founded Infocom, initially with no actual business plans, but settling on porting &quot;Zork&quot; to home computers.

The home computer ports of &quot;Zork&quot; would prove immensely successful, and Infocom grew rapidly, focusing on producing new text adventures, as well as branching out into business software. Anderson would take on the title of &quot;senior scientist, special-projects programmer&quot; within the company, mostly assisting with development of new games. The company&#x27;s expansion into business software ultimately caused them to de-emphasize game production, which lead to their eventual demise in 1989.

After Infocom shut down, Anderson held a variety of positions in the defense and business sectors, including serving as the CTO of Offroad Capital, a dot-com bubble startup for investing in private equity online.

==Personal life==
Anderson obtained his bachelor&#x27;s degree from MIT in 1975, and his masters in 1977, both in Computer science. Since 1996 Anderson has lived in Sudbury, Massachusetts, and has been active in local politics, seeking election on more than one occasion.

<text>Dominique Helena Moceanu (, ; ; born September 30, 1981) is a retired American gymnast. She was a member of the gold medal-winning United States women&#x27;s gymnastics team, the &quot;Magnificent Seven&quot;, at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta.

Moceanu trained under Marta and Béla Károlyi, and later Luminița Miscenco and Mary Lee Tracy. She earned her first national team berth at age 10 and represented the United States in various international competitions at the junior level. She was the all-around silver medalist at the 1992 Junior Pan American Games and the 1994 junior national champion. In 1995, at the age of 13, she became the youngest gymnast to win the senior all-around title at the U.S. National Championships. She was the youngest member of both the 1995 World Championships team and the gold medal-winning 1996 Olympics team, and was the last gymnast to compete legally in the Olympics at the age of 14.

Moceanu&#x27;s last major success in gymnastics was at the 1998 Goodwill Games, where she became the first American to win the all-around gold medal. Family problems, coaching changes, and injuries derailed her efforts to make the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, and she retired from the sport in 2000. Since then, she has worked as a coach, studied business management, and written a memoir, &quot;Off Balance&quot;.

==Early career==
Moceanu was born in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California, on September 30, 1981, to Romanian Americans Dumitru Moceanu (1954–2008) and Camelia Moceanu (née Staicu; b. 1961), both gymnasts. Dumitru was an ethnic Aromanian born in Greece, while Camelia is an ethnic Aromanian born in Romania. Having thus been born in an Aromanian family, Dominique speaks Aromanian fluently. Dominique has two younger siblings, Jennifer Bricker (born 1987), who was born without legs and adopted shortly after birth by Gerald and Sharon Bricker, and Christina Moceanu Chapman (born 1989). She began training as a gymnast at the age of three in Illinois, and at the age of ten, the family relocated to Houston, Texas in order for her to train with Béla Károlyi and Márta Károlyi.

Under the Károlyis&#x27; guidance, Moceanu won her first U.S. National Team berth in 1992, followed by five medals, four gold and one silver, later that year, at the 1992 Junior Pan American Artistic Gymnastics Championships. She became the junior national champion in 1994, and, the following year, in 1995, she became the youngest gymnast ever to win the USA Gymnastics National Championships. She was also the youngest member of the U. S. team at the 1995 World Championships, and earned a silver medal.

Moceanu&#x27;s national and international successes, combined with her bubbly attitude, earned her attention and a wide fan base both in and out of the gymnastics community. In the months leading up to the 1996 Olympics, she was one of the most recognizable faces of USA Gymnastics, eclipsing more decorated teammates such as Shannon Miller and Dominique Dawes. Before the Olympics, she was featured in &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and wrote an autobiography, &quot;Dominique Moceanu: An American Champion&quot;, with Steve Woodward. The book reached No. 7 on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list.

== 1996 Olympics ==
Moceanu was expected to be a major medal contender at the Olympics. However, after the 1996 U.S. Nationals, where she placed third in the all-around, she was diagnosed with a stress fracture in her right tibia. Her injury forced her to sit out the Olympic Trials, but she was petitioned onto the team on the strength of her Nationals scores.

At the Olympics, still struggling with her injury and sporting a heavily bandaged leg, Moceanu contributed to the team gold medal with performances good enough to qualify her for the event finals on balance beam and floor exercise. However, she faltered in the last rotation of team optionals, falling on both vaults. Her teammate Kerri Strug vaulted next (and last) and clinched the gold for the U.S., but injured her ankle in the process. Moceanu took Strug&#x27;s place in the all-around finals, but made a mistake on the balance beam and placed ninth. In the beam final, she fell when she missed a foot on a layout and crashed into the balance beam on her head. She finished the exercise and went on to a strong performance in the floor finals later that day, finishing fourth and just missing a medal.

==Post-Olympics career==
After the 1996 Olympics, Moceanu participated in professional gymnastics exhibitions, including a 34-city tour, before returning to competition. With the retirement of the Károlyis, she began training with other coaches at Moceanu Gymnastics, a gym built and run by her family.

Out of peak form, Moceanu placed ninth at the 1997 U.S. Nationals. She then led a mostly inexperienced U.S. team at the 1997 World Championships in Lausanne, Switzerland, where she qualified for the all-around final but did not medal.

In 1998, however, she returned to top form. Under her new coach, Luminiţa Miscenco, she adjusted to a significant growth spurt and developed a more mature style. She was selected to compete at the 1998 Goodwill Games, where she became the only American to win the all-around title. In doing so, she defeated the reigning world all-around champion, Svetlana Khorkina, and the world silver and bronze medalists, Simona Amânar and Yelena Produnova. She outscored the second-place finisher, Maria Olaru—who would become the 1999 world all-around champion—by 0.687 points.

Two years later, training with Mary Lee Tracy at Cincinnati Gymnastics Academy, Moceanu placed eighth at the 2000 U.S. Nationals. She qualified for the Olympic Trials but was forced to withdraw with a knee injury.

In the fall of 2000, Moceanu participated in a post-Olympics national exhibition tour. She also participated in the post-Olympics Rock N&#x27; Roll Gymnastics Championship Tour in 2004.

After a five-year hiatus from elite gymnastics, Moceanu announced in 2005 that she was returning. An injury kept her from competing that year, but she continued to train on floor and vault, and in the summer of 2006, she was invited to attend the USA Gymnastics national training camp.

Moceanu competed at the 2006 U.S. Classic, where she successfully performed a full-twisting Tsukahara vault. On floor, however, she went out of bounds on her tucked full-in tumbling pass and fell on her double pike, posting one of the lowest scores of the meet. In a decision that proved controversial, she did not qualify to the 2006 National Championships. She stated that USA Gymnastics officials had told her she would qualify if she attended the national training camp and competed at least one event at the U.S. Classic. But after the Classic, she was told that she had needed a combined score on two events of 28.0 or higher to qualify; her combined score on vault and floor was 27.1. She appealed the decision, but it was upheld.

After coaching part-time at Gymnastics World in Broadview Heights, Ohio, Moceanu runs the &quot;Dominique Moceanu Gymnastics Center and Carmen Yoga Studio&quot; in Medina, Ohio, USA; where her son Vincent Canales also trains.

==Personal life==
Moceanu was raised in the Romanian Orthodox Church, and has said that her faith was a source of comfort during her gymnastics career. In an interview with &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, in 2012, she said her sisters, Jennifer and Christina, are also Christian, and that they all felt their separation as children and eventual reunion as adults was part of God&#x27;s plan.

On October 27, 1998, Moceanu was emancipated by a Houston court, eleven months prior to her 18th birthday. Moceanu had reportedly run away from home earlier that month, on October 17, and filed for emancipation on October 19. She accused her parents of abuse and exploitation and alleged they had used US$4,000,000 of her earnings to build a 70,000 square foot gymnastics training center in Spring, Texas. Moceanu&#x27;s parents ultimately decided not to fight her in court, and she was given control over her future earnings and allowed to live independently, though her father remained in charge of her trust. The family ultimately settled her past earning privately. Despite her father&#x27;s claim that the family gym was a financial success, it permanently closed in February 1999, less than two years after it opened. She eventually reconciled with her father, with him walking her down the aisle at her wedding in 2006.

Moceanu is married to Dr. Michael Canales, a podiatrist and collegiate gymnast. The two wed on November 4, 2006, in Houston, Texas, in a Romanian Orthodox ceremony attended by fellow gymnasts Paul Hamm, Morgan Hamm, Bart Conner, and Nadia Comăneci. They first met in 1994, when Moceanu was 12 years old. Together, they have three children, born in 2007, 2009 and 2022. Their second child and only son, Vincent, is reportedly interested in pursuing a career in gymnastics, appearing on &quot;American Ninja Warrior Junior&quot; in 2020 and voiced hope to compete in the 2028 Summer Olympics. The family resides in Ohio, where Canales practices medicine and Moceanu operates her own gymnastics training center.

Moceanu attended Northland Christian School as a teenager and went on to graduate from John Carroll University, earning a degree in business administration in 2009.

=== Memoir and sister ===

In her memoir &quot;Off Balance&quot;, Moceanu revealed that she discovered she has a younger sister, Jennifer Bricker, who was born without legs and was given up for adoption at the hospital at birth. Bricker is an acrobat and aerialist who idolized Moceanu before finding out they were sisters. The documentaries &quot;Eva Longoria&#x27;s Versus: Romanian Roots&quot; (a spinoff of ESPN&#x27;s 30 for 30) and “She Looks Like Me” from director Torquil Jones tells the story of the two discovering their connection.

In &quot;Off Balance&quot;, Moceanu also alleged that Béla and Marta Károlyi were abusive and manipulative when she trained under them.

Moceanu, Jamie Dantzscher and Jessica Howard testified at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on March 28, 2017, about the USA Gymnastics sex abuse scandal.

<doc id="905619" wikidata="Q2341169" url="?curid=905619" title="Geoff Rickly">
<text>Geoffrey William Rickly (born March 8, 1979) is an American musician and author, best known as the lead singer and songwriter of rock band Thursday. Rickly is also a member of hardcore punk band United Nations, and the alternative rock group No Devotion with former members of Lostprophets, and is the founder of the record label Collect Records.

In 2023, his debut novel, &quot;Someone Who Isn’t Me&quot;, was published by Rose Books.
==Personal life==
Rickly was born in Providence, Rhode Island and raised in Dumont, New Jersey, into a Catholic family, and attended Dumont High School, where he was a member of the band and played the tenor sax. He attended Rutgers University until 2000 before dropping out to pursue music. Rickly is a diagnosed epileptic, which has affected his ability to tour.

In early 2013, Rickly was mugged in New York City, where his cell phone, iPad, wallet, credit card, rent money, and medication were stolen. In 2015, Rickly was poisoned and robbed in Hamburg, Germany, while touring with No Devotion to play at the Reeperbahn Festival. Rickly was hospitalized, causing them to cancel their concert, but recovered for a scheduled show in Paris the following day.

In a 2017 interview with &quot;Spin&quot;, Rickly spoke of battling a heroin addiction that began shortly after Thursday&#x27;s breakup in 2011. Following Thursday&#x27;s reunion in 2016, Rickly was inspired to quit using the drug.

Rickly lives with his partner Liza de Guia.

==Musical career==
Rickly has contributed guest vocals to many songs, including My American Heart&#x27;s &quot;We Are the Fabrication&quot;, Murder by Death&#x27;s &quot;Killbot 2000&quot;, This Day Forward&#x27;s &quot;Sunfalls and Watershine&quot;, Circa Survive&#x27;s &quot;The Lottery&quot;, and My Chemical Romance&#x27;s &quot;This Is the Best Day Ever&quot;. He also occasionally performs solo, most recently in Anaheim, California, at Kill Iconic Festival on March 23, 2024, performing his band, Thursday songs &quot;Understanding in a Car Crash&quot; and &quot;This Side of Brightness&quot; acoustically.

Lyrically, Rickly has been known to draw from a wide variety of influences, many of them being authors and poets. In a March 2009 interview, he cited the works of Denis Johnson, Martin Amis, Roberto Bolaño and David Foster Wallace as being among his influences for the lyrics of Thursday&#x27;s Common Existence album, which was released in February 2009. A tattoo on his forearm reads &quot;love is love&quot;, a lyric from the band Frail; Rickly adopted these lyrics into Thursday&#x27;s &quot;A Hole in the World.&quot; The band&#x27;s song, &quot;Autobiography Of A Nation&quot; is clearly influenced by poet Michael Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Sun.&quot; Rickly has also written, recorded and played for United Nations, an experimental powerviolence collaboration.

==Collect Records==
In 2009, Rickly formed Collect Records, a record label which in its early years only co-released various albums, including releases by Touché Amoré, United Nations and Midnight Masses, but in 2014, the label announced plans to be the primary label behind albums by Black Clouds, Vanishing Life, Sick Feeling and No Devotion.

===Martin Shkreli controversy===
During the 2015 public scandal of hedge fund manager Martin Shkreli and his controversial monetary inflation of toxoplasmosis-related pharmaceuticals, it was revealed that Shkreli was a silent investor in Collect Records, while still allowing Rickly to retain creative control. Rickly and Shkreli met when the guitar that Rickly used to make Thursday&#x27;s album &quot;Full Collapse&quot; was purchased by Shkreli for $10,000. Rickly said he was completely shocked by the scandal, stating: &quot;I&#x27;ve seen the guy give away money to schools, charities, and frankly, our bands, who if anyone really knows the industry, is a hard sell. I am struggling to find how this is OK.&quot; Due to the controversy, Shkreli&#x27;s relationship with Collect Records angered several artists signed to the label. One of the artists, Sick Feeling, said in a public statement: &quot;One thing is clear; as long as he has a part in the label, we, Sick Feeling, cannot. Our experience with Geoff, Norm, and Shaun has been nothing but positive, however, we cannot continue to work with Collect as long as Martin Shkreli has any part in it.&quot; Dominic &quot;Nicky&quot; Palermo of Nothing, who had just recently signed a two-record deal with Collect Records, expressed interest in ending the contract and said: &quot;I&#x27;m hoping that we can just get out of this with someone else and not have to go down whatever ugly road that could lead to.&quot; Within two days of the controversy, Rickly put out a press release stating that the label had severed its relationship with Shkreli, and that the amount of money he currently had in the bank could not cover Collect Records&#x27; outstanding invoices, leaving its future uncertain, without Shkreli&#x27;s significant financial contributions to Collect (estimated to be &quot;somewhere around a million dollars&quot;).

<text>The 
 is a modern metal practice sword, without a cutting edge, used primarily for practicing iaido, a form of Japanese swordsmanship.

==Other Japanese swords==
A real (sharp) katana is called a . In contrast to shinken, iaitō have no cutting edge and are designed for iai/battō practice and are usually unsuited for sword-to-sword contact. These should not be confused with imitation swords primarily made for decorative reasons, which are generally unsafe for martial arts practice.

==Materials and manufacture==
Most iaitō are made of an aluminium-zinc alloy which is cheaper and lighter than steel. This use of alloy and a blunt edge also circumvents Japanese legal restrictions on the manufacture of swords made of ferrous metals. As such, Japanese-made iaitō are intended as practice weapons and are not suited for any type of contact. The best alloy blades are rather faithful reproductions of real swords with authentic weight and shape along with similarly high-quality finish and fittings. Iaitō may even have a mock . The average weight for a real is typically without the scabbard while a typical alloy iaitō is roughly . Some steel iaitō are also constructed and can weigh around for a blade.

Some imitation Japanese swords are made in countries other than Japan. They may even be made of folded steel, much like a real katana, but with a blunt edge. Such weapons would face the same use and ownership restrictions in Japan as genuine swords, and would not be considered &quot;iaitō&quot; in Japan.

The first iaitō were made after the Second World War to permit people without means to own a training sword for their practice of modern budō. Iaitō today are produced by specialized workshops without requiring any direct involvement of shinken swordsmiths.

Some dōjō in Japan recommend that only alloy blades be used for practicing &quot;iaidō&quot; until the practitioner&#x27;s skill is consistent enough to safely use a sharp-edged sword. Some iaidō schools may require a practitioner to start with a &quot;shinken&quot; right away, while other schools prohibit the use of a &quot;shinken&quot; altogether.

The matching of iaitō length, weight, and balance to the practitioner&#x27;s build and strength is of utmost importance to safely and correctly perform the iaidō forms (kata). Due to the repetition involved in the practicing of iaidō, iaitō are often constructed with the balance point of the blade being set farther from the blade&#x27;s point (&quot;kissaki&quot;) and closer to the guard (&quot;tsuba&quot;) than other blades.

== Legislation ==
The &quot;Act for Controlling the Possession of Firearms or Swords and Other Such Weapons&quot;, established in Japan in 1958, forbids the possession, production, and importation of any sharpened (or sharpenable) sword. Very few exceptions to this rule exists, but, notably, traditional Japanese swordsmiths are permitted to produce a restricted number of blades over the course of the year. Japanese swordsmiths have a special status, and the weapons they make are considered work of art rather than weapons. (This also explains why nihontō exported outside Japan must go through a declassification process before their exportation.)

<doc id="905638" wikidata="Q839206" url="?curid=905638" title="General Tso's chicken">
<text>General Tso&#x27;s chicken ( ) is a sweet and spicy deep-fried chicken dish. 

==Name==
The dish was retroactively named after Zuo Zongtang (Tso Tsung-t&#x27;ang) (1812–1885), a Qing dynasty statesman and military leader from Hunan Province. Chef Eileen Yin-Fei Lo speculated that name &quot;Zongtang&quot; was not a reference to Zuo Zongtang, but rather a reference to the homophone &quot;zongtang&quot; (宗堂), meaning &quot;the hall of the ancestors&quot;. The dish is known by many alternative names, mostly replacing Tso with a different surname.

==Claims of origin==
Two Chinese chefs, Peng Chang-kuei and T.T. Wang, each claimed to have invented General Tso&#x27;s chicken. The two claims may be somewhat reconciled in that the current General Tso&#x27;s chicken recipe — where the meat is crispy fried — was introduced by Wang under the name &quot;General Ching&#x27;s chicken&quot;, a name which still has trace appearances on menus on the Internet (the identity of its namesake &quot;General Ching&quot; is, however, unclear); whereas the name &quot;General Tso&#x27;s chicken&quot; can be traced to Peng, who cooked it in a different way. 

===Peng&#x27;s claim===
Peng Chang-kuei, a chef from Hunan who was later based in Chongqing and Taipei, rolled out the new dish circa 1973 when he opened the restaurant &quot;Uncle Peng&#x27;s Hunan Yuan&quot; on East 44th Street, New York City. Peng claimed his restaurant was the first in New York City to serve Tso&#x27;s chicken. Since the dish was new, Peng made it the house specialty in spite of the dish&#x27;s commonplace ingredients. A review of Uncle Peng in 1977 mentioned that their &quot;General Tso&#x27;s chicken was a stir-fried masterpiece, sizzling hot both in flavor and temperature&quot;. When Peng opened a restaurant in Hunan in the 1990s introducing Tso&#x27;s chicken, the locals found the dish too sweet. His restaurant quickly closed in Hunan.

There are two stories purporting to explain how Peng Chang-kuei created the dish when he worked in Taipei before he introduced it to New York. Both stories linked to the fact that Peng was well connected to the senior Kuomintang politicians in Hunan, Chongqing and Taiwan. The first story was given by Peng himself in 2008 by Jennifer 8. Lee for the documentary &quot;The Search for General Tso&quot; (2014). In the documentary, Peng recalled in 1952 he was invited by the Republic of China Navy to be in charge of a three-day state banquet during Admiral Arthur W. Radford&#x27;s visit of Taiwan. Peng claimed Tso&#x27;s chicken was served on Radford&#x27;s menu on the third day. According to U.S. diplomatic records, Radford&#x27;s visit was during June 2–6, 1953. The second story was proposed by Taiwanese food writer Zhu Zhenfan in 2009, who said Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of President Chiang Kai-shek, paid a late visit to Peng&#x27;s restaurant when Peng ran out of ingredients. Chiang was served an improvised dish, General Tso&#x27;s chicken, by Peng.

===Wang claim===
New York&#x27;s Shun Lee Palaces, located at East (155 E. 55th St.) and West (43 W. 65th St.), also claims that it was the first restaurant to serve General Tso&#x27;s chicken and that it was invented by a Chinese immigrant chef named T. T. Wang in 1972. Michael Tong, owner of New York&#x27;s Shun Lee Palaces, says &quot;We opened the first Hunanese restaurant in the whole country, and the four dishes we offered you will see on the menu of practically every Hunanese restaurant in America today. They all copied from us.&quot;

==Popularity==
Tso&#x27;s chicken was spicy rather than sweet and spicy. It was altered to suit the tastes of Americans. The dish drew the attention of many food writers; among them were Fuchsia Dunlop from the United Kingdom and Jennifer 8. Lee from the U.S. The dish was adopted by some Hunan chefs. In Taiwan, it is not served sweet; the chicken is cooked with its skin and soy sauce plays a much more prominent role.

==Recipes==
Basic ingredients include:
* Sauce: soy sauce, rice wine, rice-wine vinegar, sugar, cornstarch, dried red chili peppers (whole), garlic.
* Batter / breading: egg, cornstarch.
* Dish: broccoli, chicken dark meat (cubed).

<text>Lieutenant-General Arthur Ernest Percival, (26 December 1887 – 31 January 1966) was a British Army officer. He saw service in the First World War and built a successful military career during the interwar period, but is best known for his defeat in the Second World War, when Percival commanded British Commonwealth forces during the Malayan campaign, which culminated in a catastrophic defeat at the Battle of Singapore.

Percival&#x27;s surrender to the invading Imperial Japanese Army, which was the largest of its kind in British military history, significantly undermined Britain&#x27;s prestige and military position in East Asia. Some historians, such as Sir John Smyth, have argued that under-funding of British Malaya&#x27;s defences and the inexperienced, under-equipped nature of the Commonwealth forces in Malaya, not Percival&#x27;s leadership, were ultimately to blame for the defeat.

==Early days==

===Childhood and employment===

Arthur Ernest Percival was born on 26 December 1887 in Aspenden Lodge, Aspenden near Buntingford in Hertfordshire, England, the second son of Alfred Reginald and Edith Percival (née Miller). His father was the land agent of the Hamel&#x27;s Park estate and his mother came from a Lancashire cotton family. By 1891 the family was living in nearby Thundridge at &quot;Sprangewell&quot; on Poles Lane, his father being listed as &quot;Land Agent&quot; in the 1891 census, although it is unclear if this is still for Hamel&#x27;s Park, or for E.S. Hanbury&#x27;s Poles estate (now &quot;Hanbury Manor&quot;), which is adjacent to Sprangewell.

Percival was initially schooled locally in Bengeo. Then in 1901, he was sent to Rugby with his more academically successful brother, where he was a boarder in School House. A moderate pupil, he studied Greek and Latin but was described by a teacher as &quot;not a good classic&quot;. Percival&#x27;s only qualification on leaving in 1906 was a higher school certificate. He was a more successful sportsman, playing cricket and tennis and running cross country. He also rose to colour sergeant in the school&#x27;s Volunteer Rifle Corps. However, his military career began at a comparatively late age: although a member of Youngsbury Rifle Club, he was working as a clerk for the iron ore merchants Naylor, Benzon &amp; Company Limited in London, which he had joined in 1914, when the First World War broke out.

===Enlistment and First World War===
Percival enlisted on the first day of the war as a private in the Officer Training Corps of the Inns of Court, at the age of 26, and was promoted after five weeks&#x27; basic training to temporary second lieutenant. Nearly one third of his fellow recruits would be dead by the end of the war. By November Percival had been promoted to captain. The following year he was despatched to France with the newly formed 7th (Service) Battalion of the Bedfordshire Regiment (later the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment), which became part of the 54th Brigade, 18th (Eastern) Division, in February 1915. The first day of the Battle of the Somme (1 July 1916) left Percival unscathed, but in September he was badly wounded in four places by shrapnel, as he led his company in an assault on the Schwaben Redoubt, beyond the ruins of Thiepval village, and was awarded the Military Cross (MC), the citation for which reads:

Percival took a regular commission as a captain with the Essex Regiment in October 1916, whilst recovering from his injuries in hospital. He was appointed a temporary major in his original regiment. In 1917, he became a battalion commander with the temporary rank of lieutenant-colonel. During Germany&#x27;s Spring Offensive, Percival led a counter-attack that saved a unit of French artillery from capture, winning a Croix de Guerre. For a short period in May 1918, he acted as commander of the 54th Brigade. He was given brevet promotion to major, and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO), with his citation stating the following:

He ended the war, which came to an end on 11 November 1918 due to the Armistice with Germany, as a respected soldier, described as &quot;very efficient&quot; and was recommended for the Staff College.

==Interwar period==

===Russia===
Percival&#x27;s studies were delayed in 1919 when he decided to volunteer for service with the Archangel Command of the British Military Mission during the North Russia intervention of the Russian Civil War. Acting as second-in-command of the 45th Royal Fusiliers, he earned a bar to his DSO in August, when his attack in the Gorodok operation along the Northern Dvina resulted in the British capture of 400 Red Army troops. The citation reads:

He commanded the Gorodok column on 9–10 August 1919, with great gallantry and skill, and owing to the success of this column the forces on the right bank of the Dvina were able to capture all its objectives. During the enemy counter-attack from Selmenga on Gorodok he handled his men excellently. The enemy were repulsed with great loss, leaving 400 prisoners in our hands.

===Ireland===
In 1920, Percival was deployed to Ireland and fought against the Irish Republican Army (IRA) during the Irish War of Independence, first as a company commander and later as the intelligence officer of the 1st Essex Regiment. He was stationed in Bandon and Kinsale in County Cork. In December 1920 the Commander in Chief of British forces in Ireland (Nevil Macready) informed the British Cabinet that &quot;official reprisals&quot; had been authorized in Martial law areas. Percival proved to be an energetic counterinsurgency commander who was noted for his aptitude for intelligence-gathering and establishment of bicycle infantry formations which acted as flying columns. He was also accused by several IRA prisoners of using torture during interrogations. As a result, Percival became one of the most hated British commanders in Ireland at the time and survived three assassination attempts by the IRA. The IRA had promised a £1,000 reward to whomever captured or killed Percival. 

Following the IRA killing of a Royal Irish Constabulary sergeant outside a Bandon church in July 1920, Percival captured Tom Hales, the commander of the IRA&#x27;s 3rd Cork Brigade, and Patrick Harte, the brigade&#x27;s quartermaster, for which he was given an OBE. Both Hales and Harte subsequently claimed they had been tortured while in custody, and according to IRA commander Tom Barry, Harte received a severe blow with a rifle butt to his temple causing a brain injury and died in a mental hospital in 1925 as a result. British intelligence officer Ormonde Winter subsequently stated that Hales had informed on the IRA while in British custody and had invented his allegations to deflect attention away from his decision to provide the names of fellow IRA members in return for a lesser sentence.

On 4 February 1921, while participating a raid carried out by British forces between Bandon and Kilbrittain, Percival shot and killed IRA volunteer Patrick Crowley Jr. When Crowley, who was being treated for appendicitis, tried to flee from a house in Maryboro, Percival chased him on foot and shot him in the back. Barry later wrote that Percival was &quot;easily the most vicious anti-Irish of all serving British officers&quot;. David Lloyd George and Winston Churchill met Percival in 1921, when he was called as an expert witness during an inquiry into the Irish War of Independence.

Percival would later deliver a series of lectures on his experiences in Ireland in which he stressed the importance of surprise and offensive action, intelligence-gathering, maintaining security and co-operation between different security forces. Historian J. B. E. Hittle wrote that of all the British officers in Ireland &quot;Percival stood out for his violent, sadistic behaviour towards IRA prisoners, suspects and innocent civilians... He also participated in reprisals, burning farms and businesses in response to IRA attacks. Percival was said to regularly drive in the countryside in an open touring car so he could &quot;have cockshots at farmers working in the fields&quot;. It is possible that Percival was influenced by the then British Army Captain Bernard Montgomery who wrote to Percival regarding tactics he used to combat the Irish rebels: &quot;My own view is that to win a war of this sort, you must be ruthless. Oliver Cromwell, or the Germans, would have settled it in a very short time. Clifford Kinvig, Percival&#x27;s biographer considers him to have been unfairly vilified by Irish republican propaganda due to being &quot;tireless in his attempt to destroy the spirit of the people and the organisation of the IRA&quot;.

===Staff officer===
Percival attended the Staff College, Camberley, from 1923 to 1924, which had Major-General Edmund Ironside as its Commandant, where he was taught by J. F. C. Fuller, who was one of the few sympathetic reviewers of his book, &quot;The War in Malaya&quot;, twenty-five years later. He impressed his instructors, who picked him out as one of eight students for accelerated promotion, and his fellow students who admired his cricketing skills. Following an appointment as major with the Cheshire Regiment, he spent four years with the Nigeria Regiment of the Royal West African Frontier Force in West Africa as a staff officer. He was given brevet promotion to lieutenant-colonel in 1929.

In 1930, Percival spent a year studying at the Royal Naval College, Greenwich. From 1931 to 1932, Percival was a General Staff Officer Grade 2, an instructor at the Staff College. The college&#x27;s commandant was by now Major-General Sir John Dill, who became Percival&#x27;s mentor over the next decade, helping to ensure his protégé&#x27;s advancement. Dill regarded Percival as a promising officer and wrote that &quot;he has an outstanding ability, wide military knowledge, good judgment and is a very quick and accurate worker&quot; but added &quot;he has not altogether an impressive presence and one may therefore fail, at first meeting him, to appreciate his sterling worth&quot;. With Dill&#x27;s support, Percival was appointed to command the 2nd Battalion, the Cheshire Regiment from 1932 to 1936, initially in Malta. In 1935, he attended the Imperial Defence College in London.

Percival was made a full colonel in March 1936, and until 1938 he was General Staff Officer Grade 1 in Malaya, the Chief of Staff to General Dobbie, the General Officer Commanding in Malaya. During this time, he recognised that Singapore was no longer an isolated fortress. He considered the possibility of the Japanese landing in Thailand to &quot;burgle Malaya by the backdoor and conducted an appraisal of the possibility of an attack being launched on Singapore from the North, which was supplied to the War Office, and which Percival subsequently felt was similar to the plan followed by the Japanese in 1941. He also supported Dobbie&#x27;s unexecuted plan for the construction of fixed defences in Southern Johore. In March 1938, Percival returned to Britain and was (temporarily) promoted to brigadier on the General Staff, Aldershot Command.

==Second World War==


Percival was appointed brigadier, General Staff, of the I Corps, British Expeditionary Force, commanded by General Dill, from 1939 to 1940. He was then promoted to acting major-general, and in February 1940 briefly became General Officer Commanding (GOC) of the 43rd (Wessex) Infantry Division. He was made Assistant Chief of the Imperial General Staff at the War Office in 1940 but asked for a transfer to an active command after the Dunkirk evacuation. Given command of the 44th (Home Counties) Division, he spent 9 months organising the protection of of the English coast from invasion. He was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in the 1941 King&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

===Percival&#x27;s early assessment of the vulnerability of Singapore===
In 1936, Major-General William Dobbie, then General Officer Commanding (Malaya), had made an inquiry into whether more forces were required on mainland Malaya to prevent the Japanese from establishing forward bases to attack Singapore. Percival, then his Chief Staff Officer, had been tasked to draw up a tactical assessment of how the Japanese were most likely to attack.
In late 1937, his analysis had duly confirmed that north Malaya might become the critical battleground. The Japanese were likely to seize the east coast landing sites on Thailand and Malaya in order to capture aerodromes and achieve air superiority. This could serve as a prelude to further Japanese landings in Johore to disrupt communications northwards and enable the construction of another main base in North Borneo. From North Borneo, the final sea and air assault could be launched against eastern Singapore – in particular the Changi area.

===General Officer Commanding (Malaya)===
In April 1941 Percival was promoted to acting Lieutenant-General, and was appointed General Officer Commanding (GOC) Malaya. This was a significant promotion for him as he had never commanded an army corps although he had previous experience there.
He left Britain in a Sunderland flying boat and embarked on an arduous fortnight-long, multi-stage flight via Gibraltar, Malta, Alexandria (where he was delayed by the Anglo-Iraqi War), Basra, Karachi, and Rangoon, where he was met by an RAF transport.

Percival had mixed feelings about his appointment, noting that &quot;In going to Malaya I realised that there was the double danger either of being left in an inactive command for some years if war did not break out in the East or, if it did, of finding myself involved in a pretty sticky business with the inadequate forces which are usually to be found in the distant parts of our Empire in the early stages of a war.&quot;

For much of the interwar period, Britain&#x27;s defensive plan for Malaya had centred on the dispatch of a naval fleet to the newly built Singapore Naval Base. Accordingly, the army&#x27;s role was to defend Singapore and Southern Johore. While this plan had seemed adequate when the nearest Japanese base had been away, the outbreak of war in Europe, combined with the partial Japanese occupation of the northern part of French Indochina and the signing of the Tripartite Pact in September 1940, had underlined the difficulty of a sea-based defence. Instead it was proposed to use the RAF to defend Malaya, at least until reinforcements could be dispatched from Britain. This led to the building of airfields in northern Malaya and along its east coast and the dispersal of the available army units around the peninsula to protect them.

On arrival, Percival set about training his inexperienced army; his Indian troops were particularly raw, with most of their experienced officers having been withdrawn to support the formation of new units as the Indian army expanded. Relying upon commercial aircraft or the Volunteer air force to overcome the shortage of RAF planes, he toured the peninsula and encouraged the building of defensive works around Jitra. A training manual approved by Percival, &quot;Tactical Notes on Malaya&quot;, was distributed to all units.

In July 1941 when the Japanese occupied southern Indochina, Britain, the United States and the Netherlands imposed economic sanctions, freezing Japanese financial assets and cutting Japan from its supplies of oil, tin and rubber. The sanctions were aimed at pressuring Japan to abandon its involvement in China; instead, the Japanese government planned to seize the resources of South-East Asia from the European nations by force. Both the Japanese navy and army were mobilised, but for the moment an uneasy state of cold war persisted. British Commonwealth reinforcements continued to trickle into Malaya. On 2 December, the battleship HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and the battle-cruiser HMS &quot;Repulse&quot;, escorted by four destroyers, arrived in Singapore, the first time a battle fleet had been based there. (They were to have been accompanied by the aircraft carrier to provide air cover but she had run aground in the Caribbean en route.) The following day Rear-Admiral Spooner hosted a dinner attended by the newly arrived Commander-in-Chief Eastern Fleet, Admiral Sir Tom Phillips, and Percival.

===Japanese attack and British surrender===

On 8 December 1941 the Japanese 25th Army under the command of Lieutenant-General Tomoyuki Yamashita launched an amphibious assault on the Malay Peninsula (one hour before the attack on Pearl Harbor; the difference in date was because the two places lie on opposite sides of the International Date Line). That night the first Japanese invasion force arrived at Kota Bharu on Malaya&#x27;s east coast. This was just a diversionary force, and the main landings took place the next day at Singora and Pattani on the south-eastern coast of Thailand, with troops rapidly deploying over the border into northern Malaya.

On 10 December Percival issued a stirring, if ultimately ineffective, Special Order of the Day:
In this hour of trial the General Officer Commanding calls upon all ranks Malaya Command for a determined and sustained effort to safeguard Malaya and the adjoining British territories. The eyes of the Empire are upon us. Our whole position in the Far East is at stake. The struggle may be long and grim but let us all resolve to stand fast come what may and to prove ourselves worthy of the great trust which has been placed in us.

The Japanese advanced rapidly, and on 27 January 1942 Percival ordered a general retreat across the Johore Strait to the island of Singapore and organised a defence along the length of the island&#x27;s coast line. But the Japanese did not dawdle, and on 8 February Japanese troops landed on the northwest corner of Singapore island. After a week of fighting on the island, Percival held his final command conference at 9 am on 15 February in the Battle Box of Fort Canning. The Japanese had already occupied approximately half of Singapore and it was clear that the island would soon fall. Having been told that ammunition and water would both run out by the following day, Percival agreed to surrender. The Japanese at this point were running low on artillery shells, but Percival did not know this.

The Japanese insisted that Percival himself march under a white flag to the Old Ford Motor Factory in Bukit Timah to negotiate the surrender. A Japanese officer present noted that he looked &quot;pale, thin and tired&quot;. After a brief disagreement, when Percival insisted that the British keep 1,000 men under arms in Singapore to preserve order, which Yamashita finally conceded, it was agreed at 6:10 pm that all British Commonwealth troops would lay down their arms and cease resistance at 8:30 pm. This was in spite of instructions from Prime Minister Winston Churchill for prolonged resistance.

A common view holds that 129,704 Allied personnel surrendered or were killed by fewer than 30,000 Japanese. However, the former figure includes nearly 50,000 troops captured or killed during the Battle of Malaya, and perhaps 15,000 base troops. Many of the other troops were tired and under-equipped following their retreat from the Malayan peninsula. Conversely, the latter number represents only the front-line troops available for the invasion of Singapore. British Commonwealth casualties in battle since 8 December amounted to 7,500 killed and 11,000 wounded. Japanese losses totalled more than 3,507 killed and 6,107 wounded.

===Culpability for the fall of Singapore===
Churchill viewed the fall of Singapore to be &quot;the worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history.&quot; However, the British defence was that the Middle East and the Soviet Union had all received higher priorities in the allocation of men and material, so the desired air force strength of 300 to 500 aircraft was never reached, and whereas the Japanese invaded with over two hundred tanks, the British Army in Malaya did not have a single tank. In &quot;The War in Malaya&quot; Percival himself cites this as the major factor for the defeat stating that the &#x27;war material which might have saved Singapore was sent to Russia and the Middle East&#x27;. However he also concedes that Britain was engaged in &#x27;a life and death struggle in the West&#x27; and that &#x27;this decision, however painful and regrettable, was inevitable and right&#x27;.

In 1918, Percival had been described as &quot;a slim, soft spoken man... with a proven reputation for bravery and organisational powers&quot; but by 1945 this description had been turned on its head with even Percival&#x27;s defenders describing him as &quot;something of a damp squib&quot;. The fall of Singapore switched Percival&#x27;s reputation to that of an ineffective &quot;staff wallah&quot;, lacking ruthlessness and aggression. Over six feet in height and lanky, with a clipped moustache and two protruding teeth, and unphotogenic, Percival was an easy target for a caricaturist, being described as &quot;tall, bucktoothed and lightly built&quot;. There was no doubt his presentation lacked impact as &quot;his manner was low key and he was a poor public speaker with the cusp of a lisp&quot;.

Air Chief Marshal Sir Robert Brooke-Popham, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Far East Command, refused Percival permission to launch Operation Matador, a pre-emptive invasion of Thailand, in advance of the Japanese landings there; he did not wish to run any risk of provoking the coming war. Brooke-Popham was accused by his detractors of not arguing forcefully for air reinforcements required to defend Malaya.

Peter Wykeham suggested that the government in London was more to blame than any of the British commanders in the Far East. Despite repeated requests, the British government did not provide the necessary reinforcements and they denied Brooke-Popham – and therefore Percival – permission to enter neutral Thailand before it was too late to put in place forward defences.

Moreover, Percival had difficulties with his subordinates Sir Lewis &quot;Piggy&quot; Heath, commanding Indian III Corps, and the independent-minded Gordon Bennett, commanding the Australian 8th Division. The former officer had been senior to Percival prior to his appointment as GOC (Malaya).

Percival was ultimately responsible for the men who served under him, and with other officers – notably Major-General David Murray-Lyon, commander of the Indian 11th Infantry Division – he had shown a willingness to replace them when he felt their performance was not up to scratch. Perhaps his greatest mistake was to resist the building of fixed defences in either Johore or the north shore of Singapore, dismissing them in the face of repeated requests to start construction from his Chief Engineer, Brigadier Ivan Simson, with the comment &quot;Defences are bad for morale – for both troops and civilians&quot;.

Percival also insisted on defending the north-eastern shore of Singapore most heavily, against the advice of the Allied supreme commander in South East Asia, General Sir Archibald Wavell. Percival was perhaps fixed on his responsibilities for defending the Singapore Naval Base. He also spread his forces thinly around the island and kept few units as a strategic reserve. When the Japanese attack came in the west, the Australian 22nd Brigade took the brunt of the assault. Percival refused to reinforce them as he continued to believe that the main assault would occur in the north east. The attacking Japanese were down to the last of their ammunition when Percival surrendered. Before surrendering, besides taking his own counsel, he consulted his own officers.

In the post-war Percival Report (written in 1946, published in 1948) the &quot;imminent collapse&quot; of the water supply, estimated by David J. Murnane, the Municipal Water Engineer, on 14 February to occur within 24–48 hours, was highlighted as a direct cause for surrender. According to oral history records, quoted by Louis Allen (author of Singapore 1941–42), Murnane asked for and was promised by General Percival &quot;ten lorries and a hundred Royal Engineers&quot; so he could fix the water supply leaks caused by Japanese bombing and shelling. He never got what he needed: Louis Allen says Murnane got &#x27;one lorry and ten frightened Sikhs&#x27;. When confronted again, all that Percival delivered (on 14 February) was one lorry and ten Royal Engineers but it was too late.

===Captivity===
Percival himself was briefly held prisoner in Changi Prison, where &quot;the defeated GOC could be seen sitting head in hands, outside the married quarters he now shared with seven brigadiers, a colonel, his ADC and cook-sergeant. He discussed feelings with few, spent hours walking around the extensive compound, ruminating on the reverse and what might have been&quot;. In the belief that it would improve discipline, he reconstituted a Malaya Command, complete with staff appointments, and helped occupy his fellow prisoners with lectures on the Battle of France.

Along with the other senior British captives above the rank of colonel, Percival was removed from Singapore in August 1942. First he was imprisoned in Formosa and then sent on to Manchuria, where he was held with several dozen other VIP captives, including the American General Jonathan Wainwright, in a prisoner-of-war camp near Hsian, about to the north east of Mukden.

As the war drew to an end, an OSS team removed the prisoners from Hsian. Percival was then taken, along with Wainwright, to stand immediately behind General Douglas MacArthur as he confirmed the terms of the Japanese surrender aboard in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. Afterwards, MacArthur gave Percival a pen he had used to sign the treaty.

Percival and Wainwright then returned together to the Philippines to witness the surrender of the Japanese army there, which in a twist of fate was commanded by General Yamashita. Yamashita was momentarily surprised to see his former captive at the ceremony; on this occasion Percival refused to shake Yamashita&#x27;s hand, angered by the mistreatment of POWs in Singapore. The flag carried by Percival&#x27;s party on the way to Bukit Timah was also a witness to this reversal of fortunes, being flown when the Japanese formally surrendered Singapore back to Lord Louis Mountbatten.

==Later life==
Percival returned to the United Kingdom in September 1945 to write his despatch at the War Office but this was revised by the UK Government and published only in 1948. He retired from the army in 1946 with the honorary rank of lieutenant-general but the pension of his substantive rank of major-general. Thereafter, he held appointments connected with the county of Hertfordshire, where he lived at Bullards in Widford: he was Honorary Colonel of 479th (Hertfordshire Yeomanry) Heavy Anti-Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, (T.A.) from 1949 to 1954 and acted as one of the Deputy Lieutenants of Hertfordshire in 1951. He continued his relationship with the Cheshire Regiment being appointed Colonel of the Cheshire Regiment between 1950 and 1955; an association continued by his son, Brigadier James Percival who became Colonel of the Regiment between 1992 and 1999.

Percival was respected for the time he had spent as a Japanese prisoner of war. Serving as life president of the Far East Prisoners of War Association (FEPOW), he pushed for compensation for his fellow captives, eventually helping to obtain a token £5 million of frozen Japanese assets for this cause. This was distributed by the FEPOW Welfare Trust, on which Percival served as chairman. He led protests against the film &quot;The Bridge on the River Kwai&quot; when it was released in 1957, obtaining the addition of an on-screen statement that the movie was a work of fiction. He also worked as president of the Hertfordshire British Red Cross and was made an Officer of the Venerable Order of Saint John in 1964.

Percival died at the age of 78 on 31 January 1966, in King Edward VII&#x27;s Hospital for Officers, Beaumont Street in Westminster, and is buried in the churchyard at Widford in Hertfordshire.

===Family===
On 27 July 1927 Percival married Margaret Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; MacGregor Greer in Holy Trinity Church, Brompton. She was the daughter of Thomas MacGregor Greer of Tallylagan Manor, a Protestant linen merchant from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland. They had met during his tour of duty in Ireland but it had taken Percival several years to propose. They had two children. A daughter, Dorinda Margery, was born in Greenwich and became Lady Dunleath. Alfred James MacGregor, their son, was born in Singapore and served in the British Army.

<doc id="905653" wikidata="Q12072752" url="?curid=905653" title="Western saddle">
<text>Western saddles are used for western riding and are the saddles used on working horses on cattle ranches throughout the United States, particularly in the west. They are the &quot;cowboy&quot; saddles familiar to movie viewers, rodeo fans, and those who have gone on trail rides at guest ranches. This saddle was designed to provide security and comfort to the rider when spending long hours on a horse, traveling over rugged terrain.

The design of the Western saddle derives from the saddles of the Mexican &quot;vaqueros&quot;—the early horse trainers and cattle handlers of Mexico and the American Southwest. It was developed for the purpose of working cattle across vast areas, and came from a combination of the saddles used in the two main styles of horseback riding then practiced in Spain—&quot;la jineta&quot;, the Moorish style which allowed great freedom of movement to the horse; and &quot;la estradiota&quot;, later &quot;la brida&quot;, the jousting style, which provided great security to the rider and strong control of the horse. A very functional item was also added: the saddle &quot;horn&quot;. This style of saddle allowed vaqueros to control cattle by use of a rope around the neck of the animal, tied or dallied (wrapped without a knot) around the horn.

Today, although many Western riders have never roped a cow, the western saddle still features this historical element. (Some variations on the Western saddle design, such as those used in bronc riding, endurance riding and those made for the European market, do not have horns.) Another predecessor which may have contributed to the design of the Western saddle was the Spanish tree saddle, which was also influential in the design of the McClellan saddle of the American military, being used by all branches of the U.S. Army, but being particularly associated with the cavalry.

The Western saddle is designed to be comfortable when ridden in for many hours. Its history and purpose is to be a working tool for a cowboy who spends all day, every day, on horseback. For a beginning rider, the western saddle may give the impression of providing a more secure seat. However, this may be misleading; the horn is not meant to be a handle for the rider to hang onto, and the high cantle and heavy stirrups are not for forcing the rider into a rigid position. The development of an independent seat and hands is as critical for western riders as for English riders.

==Construction==
The modern western saddle begins with a &quot;tree&quot; that defines the shape of the bars, the seat, the swells, horn, and cantle. Traditional trees are made of wood covered with rawhide, coated with varnish or a similar modern synthetic coating. In some cases, the core of the horn may be of metal. Modern synthetic materials of various types have also been used instead of wood, but while lighter and less expensive, are generally considered weaker than traditional materials, some, such as fiberglass, dangerously so. A high-quality tree is at the heart of a good saddle, particularly those used for sports such as steer roping, where the equipment must withstand considerable force.

The tree is usually covered with leather on all visible parts of the saddle. The seat may have foam rubber or other materials added between the tree and the top layer of leather to provide additional comfort to the rider, and leather or foam padding may be used to slightly alter the contours of the seat. Sheepskin is placed on the underside of the saddle, covering both the tree and the underside of the skirts. The cinch rings, made of metal, are attached to the tree as described under &quot;Rigging,&quot; &quot;below.&quot; For decoration, metal conchos, lacing, and small plates, usually silver or a silver-like substitute, are added.

The leather parts of the saddle are often tooled into designs that range from simple to complex. The finest-quality saddles often have hand-carved tooling that itself is considered a work of art.

==Western saddles compared to English saddles==
The Western saddle is different from an English saddle in that it has no padding between the tree and the external leather and fleece skirting. The weight bearing area of the saddle is large and usually covered with sheepskin, but it must be padded with a saddle blanket in order to provide a comfortable fit for the horse. Western saddles are extensively decorated and intricately carved silver conchos and other additions are frequently added to the saddle for show purposes.

Other differences between the Western and English saddles include:

* Stirrups: Those of the Western saddle cannot detach from the saddle in an emergency, but instead have a wider tread; combined with the rider&#x27;s high-heeled cowboy boots, the design minimizes the risk that the rider&#x27;s feet will slip through the stirrup during a fall and the rider being dragged.
* Cinching (girthing): The method of securing the saddle to the horse. Rather than buckling on as does the English girth, the Western girth, known as a &quot;cinch,&quot; is anchored with a flat strap of leather or nylon called a &quot;latigo&quot; that may be secured with a flat knot, or via holes added so that a buckle can be used, either in place of the knot or in addition to one.
* Seat and Cantle: These parts of a western saddle are more pronounced than in an English saddle and may provide greater comfort and security to the rider.
*Tree: The tree of a western saddle is larger and covers more surface area than that of an English saddle. There is little padding between the tree bars and the underside of a western saddle, whereas much of the weight bearing area on an English saddle is supported by a large amount of internal flocking inside the panels.

While a western saddle is designed to be ridden for many hours at a stretch; for covering distance where time is a factor, such as with Endurance riding, the lighter English saddle dominates. However, it is not uncommon for Western saddles to be regarded as “easier” to ride, as they don’t require the specific technique and style that is imperative to English riding. They are also larger, offering a more supportive and sturdy seat than its smaller counterpart. Lastly, Western saddles have a different general feel to them compared to English saddles, which riders may favor or dislike.

==Types==
There are many types of Western saddle available. Some are general-purpose models while others emphasize either greater freedom for the horse or greater security for the rider, as may be necessary for specialized work in the various Western horse sports such as cutting, reining, barrel racing, team roping, equitation and western pleasure. Factors such as width of the swells, height of the cantle, depth of the seat, placement of the stirrups and type of rigging all influence the uses of a given design. For example, a saddle with wide swells, high cantle and deep seat is suitable for cutting, where a rider must remain in a secure, quiet seat on the horse. At the other end of the spectrum, a saddle with a &quot;slick fork&quot; - virtually no swells - and a low cantle is suited for calf roping, where a rider must dismount quickly, often while the horse is still in motion, and not be caught up on the saddle.

The most common variations include the following:
*Roping saddle: Heavy, sturdy saddle that usually has a thicker horn for securing a rope, low cantle, and slick fork that allows rider to dismount quickly when needed.
*Rodeo bronc riding saddle: Hornless, deep seated saddle with wide swells, having small fenders with oxbow style stirrups, originally designed and made by rodeo innovator Earl Bascom in 1922.
*Cutting saddle: Has a deep seat and wide swells allows the rider to sit deep and securely through sharp stops and turns.
*Reining saddle: Has a deep seat to allow the rider to sit deeply and more freely swinging fenders for more leg movement on the rider&#x27;s part.
*Working cowhorse saddle: Highly versatile and designed to work for both reining and cutting for reined cowhorse events.
*Barrel racing saddle: Lightweight saddle with wide swells and high cantle which allows rider to sit securely but also allows the horse to perform fast sprints and sharp turns.
*Endurance saddle: Lighter weight than most western saddles, often without a horn, has a tree that spreads the rider&#x27;s weight out over a large area of the horse&#x27;s back, thus reducing pounds per square inch. Often has stirrups hung slightly farther forward, to allow rider to get off the horse&#x27;s back when traveling at faster speeds. Designed for long rides at faster speeds than a trail saddle.
*Trail saddle: Designed for maximum comfort of rider as well as a good fit for the horse, features deep, padded seat, designed for long rides at slower speeds.
*Show saddle: May be based on roping, cutting, or other trees, but is characterized by additional leather tooling and silver decoration. Usually features a deep, padded seat that allows the rider to sit quietly and give the appearance of a smooth ride.
*&quot;Equitation&quot; saddle: Show saddle with an especially deep seat to help hold a rider in place.

===Design variations===
There are many variations of design and optional equipment elements that were influenced by geographic region, history, use and the body types of horses bred in a given area. Certain stylistic elements seen on some, but not all western saddles include:
*Breastcollar, an additional piece of equipment that runs from the saddle around the chest of the horse, lending both lateral stability and preventing the saddle from sliding back. Breastcollars are particularly common on trail horses and roping horses and stylized versions are often seen at horse shows. They are generally made out of leather, but may also be made of mohair or synthetic cord similar to a front cinch, or from synthetic materials that resemble leather.
*Back cinch: A second cinch is often seen on working saddles, particularly full-rigged roping saddles. Made of several thicknesses of leather, it is adjusted just tight enough to touch the underside of the horse, but not tight enough to provoke discomfort or bucking. It prevents the back end of the saddle from rising up in working situations, and when team roping, it also minimizes the saddle fork from digging forward into the horse&#x27;s withers when a cow is dallied from the saddle horn. The back cinch is generally not required or used on a center-fire or 3/4 rigged saddle.
*Saddle strings, long strips of leather attached to the pommel and back jockey of working saddles, used for tying items to a saddle.
*Horn wrap, primarily seen on roping saddles, extra wraps of leather or other material that thickens the horn and provides support for a dallied lasso.
*Tapaderos, leather covers over the toe that close each stirrup from the front. A tapadero prevents the rider&#x27;s boot from slipping through and also prevents brush encountered while working cattle on the open range from poking through the stirrup, injuring or impeding the horse or rider. The tapadero was particularly seen on certain saddles of the vaquero tradition where the length was used in herding calves, but today is primarily a decorative element. Tapaderos are not &quot;show legal&quot; for western-style horse show competition in most cases, but are often seen on saddles used by parade horses.
==Trees==

There are several different sizes of trees commonly found in saddles. Trees differ in the width of gullet and bars of the saddle, pitch of the bars (steep to flat, usually between an angle of 86 to 94 degrees with 90 being common), and length of the bars. The tree also influences the shape of the pommel and cantle on the seat on the saddle, though the seat can be altered to fit a rider by adding padding and other materials to a far greater degree than the fit of the saddle tree&#x27;s bars on a horse. A wider gullet sits lower on the horse, while a narrow gullet sits higher and is designed to fit horses with higher withers. The bars form the primary loading surface of the saddle as it site on the horse&#x27;s back. A horse with a flat back and widely sprung ribs will require bars with a flatter pitch than a saddle made for a narrow horse, where a steeper pitch to the bars will keep the saddle placed properly. Most saddles are made with pre-manufactured trees which come in a limited range of sizes. Custom-made saddles may be able to have further alterations made to a standard tree.

*Regular - If a manufacturer has a &#x27;regular&#x27; barred saddle it usually falls between 5¾&quot; and 6&quot;. Often 90 degrees
*Semi Quarter Horse - This type usually has a gullet width of about 6½ inches and steeper bars than most other trees. It is the narrowest common tree and, despite its name, fits many breeds of horse. Often 90 degrees
*Quarter Horse /Full Quarter Horse - Terminology varies with manufacturer, but overall design is intended to fit stock horse breeds such as the American Quarter Horse. This type usually has a gullet width of about 6¾ inches, but may be up to 7 inches. It usually has a flatter pitch than the Semi-Quarter horse tree. Different makers tend to give different gullet dimensions in Quarter Horse and Full Quarter Horse trees. Usually between 90 and 94 degrees
*Arabian - Depending on manufacturer, has a 6½&quot; - 6¾&quot; width gullet but a very flat pitch to the tree. Usually has shorter bars than Full- and Semi- Quarter horse trees. Intended to fit smaller horses with short but wide backs, such as the stock horse-type Arabian and Morgan.
*Haflinger (7½&quot; gullet) are very wide, designed for semi-draft breeds such as the Haflinger horse, which are short-backed, heavy, low-withered horses. Often have a flat pitch (usually greater than 94 degrees) and very little rock.
*Draft - (8&quot; gullet), are designed for riding Draft horses. Usually greater than 94 degrees
*Pony - narrow gullet, flat pitch to the bars, very short tree, designed for children and smaller ponies such as the Shetland and Welsh pony.

==Rigging==
Saddle rigging refers to the arrangement of rings and plate hardware that connects the billets and girthing system that holds the saddle on the horse. Western saddle rigging can be either single or double. The front rigging consists of metal &quot;cinch rings&quot; on each side of the saddle to which a long, wide strap called a latigo is attached for holding the front cinch that goes around the heart girth of the horse, just behind the elbows. The back cinch is placed around the widest part of the horse&#x27;s barrel, and is attached to the saddle either by reinforced slots in the leather skirting of the saddle, or, in particularly heavy-duty models, to a second set of rings.

The front cinch is secured to the saddle by means of a latigo on the left, and on the right, by either a latigo or a billet. Latigos are not removed until worn out or broken. They run through the ring or buckle of the cinch (also called a cinch ring), and back to the rigging, sometimes multiple times for extra security. Modern latigos have several holes at the end so that a cinch can be buckled at a set tension, though the cinch may also be secured by a knot called a &quot;latigo knot,&quot; which is a type of half-hitch. The off-side billet is a shorter, doubled piece of leather with holes along its length, somewhat heavier and less flexible than latigo leather. It runs through the rigging cinch ring and both ends buckle onto the cinch. Older saddles may use a latigo on the off side, but this is less common. Once adjusted to the horse, an off-side latigo or billet is seldom disconnected from the cinch, which remains attached to the saddle until it needs to be replaced, unlike the girth of an English saddle, which is to be removed on both sides when not in use. While leather is preferred for latigos, nylon web is sometimes used, particularly on cheaper saddles, though it is prone to slip when knotted and the holes may tear more easily.

When used, a back cinch, made of several thicknesses of leather, is held on by a simple heavy leather billet on each side of the saddle that buckles just tight enough to touch the underside of the horse, but not tight enough to provoke discomfort or bucking. At the belly midline, the front and back cinches are joined by a light belly strap, called a cinch hobble, that prevents the back cinch from moving too far back.

===Rigging placement===
A saddle that has only a cinch in the front is &quot;single rigged&quot;. A saddle that has both a front cinch and a back cinch (sometimes called a flank cinch, even though it should never go around the horse&#x27;s flanks) is &quot;double rigged&quot;. The rear rigging is meant to stabilize the saddle. The back cinch is always located just below the cantle and held in place with a cinch hobble to prevent it from slipping back; however, the position of the front rigging varies. The rig positions are named by how far they are from the cantle to the fork. Placement of the front rigging is a critical component of western saddle design. The closer the rigging is to the center of the saddle, the more the rider will be balanced over the horse&#x27;s center of balance, allowing freer movement and agility of horse and rider. On the other hand, the more forward the rigging is set, especially when combined with a back cinch, the more the saddle will set down on the horse, placing the rider a bit behind the horse&#x27;s center of balance, but creating greater security.

*Full rigging refers to the most forward position, where the front cinch ring is placed located under the center of the fork or swells of the saddle. Spanish settlers of North America originally used full rigging, but without a back cinch, this type of rigging was a disadvantage because the saddle would rise in the back while traveling over rough terrain.
*Center fire is the rigging design placed closest to the center of the saddle. Historically, it replaced the full rigging. Center fire rigging is located halfway between the cantle and the fork and was always single-rigged. This type is rarely seen on western saddles today, but was used during the 1800s, and notably on the McClellan saddle of the U.S. Army. The Pony Express saddle also had center fire rigging.
*Modern saddles also use two additional positions, called &quot;seven-eighths&quot; (written 7/8) and &quot;three-quarter&quot; (written 3/4). 3/4 rigging is located three-quarters of the way from the cantle to the fork; thus halfway between center fire and full positions. 7/8 rigging is 7/8 of the way from the cantle to the fork; or halfway between 3/4 and full.
*Three-way rigging utilizes various designs of multi-position cinch rings to combine the Full, 7/8 and 3/4 positions in one piece of hardware. Full position is achieved when the latigo is attached to the front ring. 7/8ths position has the latigo attached to both the front and the back ring, and the 3/4 position has the latigo attached at the back ring.
*Flank cinches were added after the rodeo sports of calf roping and team roping became popular. The flank cinch was added in order to keep the saddle from tipping in the back when a lasso was tied or dallied to the saddle horn. As a result, the 3/4 and 7/8 front rigging positions were also developed.

Custom built saddles may be designed with any of the above rigging styles. Modern western saddles for riders who need speed and agility, such as barrel racing saddles, often have a 3/4 rigging, the closest placement to a center-fire rigging seen on modern saddles. The most popular modern rigging placement is the 7/8 rigging, which allows a rider to have a secure seat but more easily stay centered over a horse&#x27;s center of balance and is often seen on saddles used for western equitation. A &quot;full double&quot; rigging is seen most often on saddles used for team roping, where the weight of the steer puts tremendous forward stress on the saddle, requiring rigging set well forward and both a front and back cinch to support the saddle. A few saddles are built with a three-way rigging plate that allows a saddle to be rigged in the full, 7/8 or 3/4 positions.

===Rigging attachment styles===
The front rigging is attached to the saddle in one of three ways: ring, flat plate or in-skirt. Ring rigging is made of rings on heavy leather straps attached directly to the saddle tree. This is the strongest attachment method, but a disadvantage is that it creates bulk under the legs and inhibits the free swing of the stirrups. The second style of attachment is the flat plate. This type has leather layers that are riveted around a metal plate and attached directly to the tree of the saddle. This is also a very strong type of ring attachment that reduces bulk under the leg and does not inhibit the swinging of the stirrups, though it is not as strong as ring rigging.

The third style is the in-skirt, where the rings or plates are attached directly to the saddle&#x27;s skirt. The advantage of having an in-skirt rigging is that it provides the least amount of bulk under the leg compared to the other styles of attachment. Two variations exist, the built-in and the built-on. The &quot;built-in&quot; rigging design makes the attachment of the rings very strong by sandwiching the rings with layers of leather and then sewing and riveting them to the skirt. This design is strong enough for pleasure riding but not for roping. It has the least amount of bulk under the leg and is popular for show saddles. A &quot;built-on&quot; rigging attaches the plate to the surface of the skirt, a weak placement of low quality.

Historic saddles of the 19th century had rigging rings made of forged iron round stock, which would rust if it was exposed to the horse&#x27;s sweat. The iron oxide would degrade and rot the leather that it came in contact with, which caused the rigging straps that were held by the rings to break. In order to correct this problem, saddle makers covered the metal rings in 4-5 ounces of medium thickness belly leather. This was a common remedy for the problem until approximately 1915, when brass rigging hardware became more common.

===Western sidesaddle rigging===
The Goodnight western sidesaddle that was developed in the 1870s by Charles Goodnight for his wife was a double rigged design. Goodnight developed this sidesaddle because there was a need to produce a woman&#x27;s saddle for daily riding and work on the range. The saddle also had to fit a variety of horses on a day-to-day basis. it required two cinches. The cinches have a connecting strap, called a cinch hobble, to keep the rear girth from slipping back, which would cause the horse to buck. The girthing system still produced a shimmy in the rear, even though the rear cinch was brought up snugly against the horse. The double girthing system was not as secure as the balance strap seen on many modern sidesaddles.

<doc id="905657" wikidata="Q4896832" url="?curid=905657" title="Best Week Ever">
<text>Best Week Ever is an American comedy series created and executive produced for VH1 by Fred Graver. The series, which first aired from January 23, 2004, to June 12, 2009, is a spin-off of the &quot;I Love the...&quot; series and was renamed Best Week Ever With Paul F. Tompkins in October 2008. In January 2010, it was announced that the show was canceled. On August 3, 2012, VH1 announced the return of &quot;Best Week Ever&quot;. New weekly episodes began January 18, 2013, but on April 23, 2014, VH1 canceled the series again.

==Format==
&quot;Best Week Ever&quot; features comedians analyzing the previous week&#x27;s developments in pop culture, including recent happenings in entertainment and celebrity gossip. It followed a similar format to that set by the mini-series &quot;I Love the 80s&quot; and its successors. Episodes aired on Fridays at 10:00 p.m. and repeated several times over the weekend. At the end of every episode, the show named which celebrity, group of people, or object had &quot;the Best Week Ever&quot;. The program&#x27;s original Typepad-hosted blog bestweekever.blogs.com originally served as an ersatz online writer&#x27;s room, mainly used to preview the events in the news which would end up in the Friday episode. In 2006, BestWeekEver.tv was launched to serve as more of a daily blog mostly separate from the program itself (beyond promotions and tie-ins for the show), detailing humorous stories in the news, odd television and YouTube videos, and features main contributors Alex Blagg, Bob Castrone, Michelle Collins, Dan Hopper, and formerly Sara Schaefer&#x27;s observations on pop culture and other items.

===Single host===
Beginning October 24, 2008, the show adopted a format with a single host who summarized the week&#x27;s events. The show was renamed &quot;Best Week Ever With Paul F. Tompkins&quot;. Tompkins introduced topics from behind a podium, summarizing the week&#x27;s events. Tompkins occasionally threw to panelists (usually Jessica St. Clair, Paul Scheer, Mike Britt, or Doug Benson) who offered their own take on a particular subject. Tompkins, a long-time panelist, had been with the show since its inception.

===Weekly format===
In both the original and latter format, each week consisted of four main segments and at least one peripheral segment. The first segment had no specific title and featured the biggest news stories of the week. The second segment was &quot;The Sizzler&quot;. It featured Chuck Nice discussing the &quot;hot&quot; celebrity gossip. This section was formatted to satirize celebrity tabloid shows such as &quot;The Insider&quot;. Next was &quot;In Case You Missed&quot; which briefly showcases several short clips from the week&#x27;s television (and occasionally the Internet and radio). The show ended with somebody being awarded &quot;the Best Week Ever&quot;, an ironic prize usually given to somebody or something which had been featured extensively on news programs, a viral video (or any new meme), or prominent reality show contestant of the week. Recipients include Barack Obama (after beating out Hillary Clinton for the 2008 Democratic Presidential nomination), the Dramatic Prairie Dog, 2 Girls 1 Cup, and Midget Mac.

===Additional programming===
The show had podcast and IPTV elements, including &quot;Best Night Ever&quot;, where a host went through the night or weekend in television in a four-minute segment, and extra footage and segments on VH1&#x27;s VSPOT online channel. For some time before the format change, VH1 began to have &quot;Best Day Ever&quot; episodes that aired Monday through Thursday for about five minutes and had different comedians go through the pop culture events of the day. Additionally, at the end of each calendar year, the show prepared a &quot;Best Year Ever&quot; special filled with &quot;clips of celeb horrors of the past year&quot;.

===Regular segments===
* &quot;Eight Words or Less&quot;, Doug Benson reviewed popular movies in eight words or less.
* &quot;Paul F. Tompkins: Celebrity Defender.&quot;, In this segment Paul F. Tompkins attempted to comically defend celebrities while they are on trial.
* &quot;Doug Benson: Pop Culture Bachelor&quot;, comedian Doug Benson gave roses to events of the week he wanted to see more of, in a similar manner to the ABC show &quot;The Bachelor&quot;.
* &quot;Blind Item&quot;: A panelist offered clues as to the identity of a mystery celebrity, only to give a false answer contradictory to the correct identity.
* &quot;Doug Benson TSI: Trailer Scene Investigator&quot;. Doug Benson discussed recent movie trailers.
* &quot;The Express Lane&quot;, a quick review of the biggest pop culture stories.
* &quot;Five Good Reasons&quot;, coming up with reasons to do one particular unfavorable act, such as voting in the 2004 elections or see the worst movie of the week.
* &quot;Upgrade/Downgrade&quot;, giving a thumbs-up or -down on items in a certain category.
* &quot;What Your Purchases Say About You&quot;, decoding the hidden messages in your spending.
* &quot;Idol Worship&quot;, a recap of events on &quot;American Idol&quot; that week.
* &quot;Ask Best Week Ever&quot;, a segment in which a man would answer questions from fans.
* &quot;Hot/Not Hot&quot;, a summary of three weekly stories; the third was always of an odd theme.

==Extended hiatus and cancellation==
Normally, &quot;Best Week Ever&quot; would leave for a summer break during July and August and return in September. &quot;New York&quot; magazine reported that &quot;Best Week Ever&quot; was on an extended hiatus until January 2010 and that it would return in the fall with Paul F. Tompkins hosting. However, the staffers feared that the show would never come back. The last episode aired June 12, 2009, with Dan Moschella named as having had the &quot;Best Week Ever&quot;.

In January 2010, the show&#x27;s website, BestWeekEver.tv announced the show&#x27;s cancellation.

==Reboot and second cancellation==
On August 3, 2012, VH1 announced the return of &quot;Best Week Ever&quot;. New weekly episodes began January 18, 2013. However, on April 23, 2014, VH1 again canceled the series a second time.

==Criticism==
The series led to criticism of the people of America. In its recounting of the events of the past week, &quot;Best Week Ever&quot; had been seen as a sign of the short attention span of millions of Americans. In a 2005 interview on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot; anchor Brian Williams said: &quot;We have such short attention spans. Heck, VH1 has a show about last week&quot;. In an article on the Pipe Dream website about VH1&#x27;s decade-retrospective shows, writer Jeanette Duffy noted that &quot;VH1 has moved on from exploiting entire decades to making us reminisce over events that happened just days ago in the &quot;Best Week Ever&quot;, jokingly suggesting that cable networks might eventually produce the &quot;Best Five Minutes Ever&quot;&quot;.

<doc id="905658" wikidata="Q1028699" url="?curid=905658" title="Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's 200 metre freestyle">
<text>The men&#x27;s 200 metre freestyle event at the 2004 Summer Olympics was contested at the Olympic Aquatic Centre of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Athens, Greece. The event took place on 15 and 16 August. There were 59 competitors from 53 nations, with each nation having up to two swimmers (a limit in place since 1984).

In the lead-up to the final, the event was billed as The Race of the Century or the &quot;greatest swimming race of all-time&quot;, due to its significance and high-class field. It featured four of the fastest swimmers in Olympic history: Ian Thorpe (Australia, world record holder in the event at the time), Pieter van den Hoogenband (Netherlands, defending Olympic champion), Grant Hackett (Australia, former world record holder in the event), and Michael Phelps (United States, later became the most decorated all-time Olympian, with a total of 28 medals). The eight finalists combined for 34 Olympic and 58 World Championship titles over their careers.

Thorpe edged out Pieter van den Hoogenband in the final 50 metres to claim his second gold at the Games and fifth career medal, following his triumph in the 400 m freestyle two days earlier. With only 50 metres to go, he powered past his arch-rival to touch the wall first in an Olympic record of 1:44.71, matching the third fastest swim over the distance. Van den Hoogenband, who led the field through the first three laps under a world record pace, won silver in 1:45.23. Meanwhile, Phelps finished the race with a bronze in an American record of 1:45.32, ending his hopes of equalling Mark Spitz&#x27;s 1972 record of seven gold medals. (Phelps would pass that record in 2008.)

Thorpe and van den Hoogenband were the second and third men to win multiple medals in the 200 metre freestyle. Phelps would become the fourth in 2008.

==Background==

This was the 12th appearance of the 200 metre freestyle event. It was first contested in 1900. It would be contested a second time, though at 220 yards, in 1904. After that, the event did not return until 1968; since then, it has been on the programme at every Summer Games.

Four of the 8 finalists from the 2000 Games returned: gold medalist Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands, silver medalist Ian Thorpe of Australia, seventh-place finisher Rick Say of Canada, and eighth-place finisher Grant Hackett of Australia. Thorpe and van den Hoogenband had finished first and second, respectively, at both the 2001 and 2003 World Championships. American Klete Keller had taken third in 2001, with Hackett earning bronze in 2003. Added to this already strong field was Michael Phelps—an individual medley specialist who had set an American record in the 200 metre freestyle as the lead leg at the 2003 World Championships (not swimming the individual event there) and beaten Keller by six-tenths of a second at the U.S. trials.

The Cayman Islands, Chile, Georgia, Latvia, Macedonia, Morocco, and Serbia and Montenegro each made their debut in the event. Australia made its 12th appearance, the only nation to have competed in all prior editions of the event.

==Competition format==

The competition followed the format established in 2000, with three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The advancement rule followed the format introduced in 1952. A swimmer&#x27;s place in the heat was not used to determine advancement; instead, the fastest times from across all heats in a round were used. The top 16 swimmers from the heats advanced to the semifinals. The top 8 semifinalists advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties.

This swimming event used freestyle swimming, which means that the method of the stroke is not regulated (unlike backstroke, breaststroke, and butterfly events). Nearly all swimmers use the front crawl or a variant of that stroke. Because an Olympic-size swimming pool is 50 metres long, this race consisted of four lengths of the pool.

<text>The testing effect (also known as retrieval practice, active recall, practice testing, or test-enhanced learning) suggests long-term memory is increased when part of the learning period is devoted to retrieving information from memory. It is different from the more general &quot;practice effect&quot;, defined in the APA Dictionary of Psychology as &quot;any change or improvement that results from practice or repetition of task items or activities.&quot;

Cognitive psychologists are working with educators to look at how to take advantage of tests—not as an assessment tool, but as a teaching tool since testing prior knowledge is more beneficial for learning when compared to only reading or passively studying material (even more so when the test is more challenging for memory).

== History ==
Before much experimental evidence had been collected, the utility of testing was already evident to some perceptive observers including Francis Bacon who discussed it as a learning strategy as early as 1620. 
&quot;Hence if you read a piece of text through twenty times, you will not learn it by heart so easily as if you read it ten times while attempting to recite it from time to time and consulting the text when your memory fails.&quot; 
Towards the end of the 17th Century, John Locke made a similar observation regarding the importance of repeated retrieval for retention in his 1689 book &quot;An Essay Concerning Human Understanding&quot;. 
&quot;But concerning the ideas themselves, it is easy to remark, that those that are oftenest refreshed (amongst which are those that are conveyed into the mind by more ways than one) by a frequent return of the objects or actions that produce them, fix themselves best in the memory, and remain clearest and longest there.&quot; 
Towards the end of the 19th century, Harvard psychologist William James described the testing effect in the following section of his 1890 book &quot;The Principles of Psychology&quot; &quot;A curious peculiarity of our memory is that things are impressed better by active than by passive repetition. I mean that in learning (by heart, for example), when we almost know the piece, it pays better to wait and recollect by an effort from within, than to look at the book again. If we recover the words in the former way, we shall probably know them the next time; if in the latter way, we shall very likely need the book once more.&quot; The first documented empirical studies on the testing effect were published in 1909 by Edwina E. Abbott which was followed up by research into the transfer and retrieval of prior learning. In his 1932 book &quot;Psychology of Study&quot;, C. A. Mace said: &quot;On the matter of sheer repetitive drill there is another principle of the highest importance: Active repetition is very much more effective than passive repetition. ... there are two ways of introducing further repetitions. We may re-read this list: this is passive repetition. We may recall it to mind without reference to the text before forgetting has begun: this is active repetition. It has been found that when acts of reading and acts of recall alternate, i.e., when every reading is followed by an attempt to recall the items, the efficiency of learning and retention is enormously enhanced.&quot; Studies in retrieval practice started in 1987 by John. L Richards, who published his findings in a newspaper in New York. Much of the confusion around early studies could have been due to constrained approaches not accounting for context. In more recent research with contributions from Hal Pashler, Henry Roediger and many others, testing knowledge can produce better learning, transfer, and retrieval results when compared to other forms of study that often use recognition like re-reading or highlighting.

== Retrieval practice ==
In recent research, storage strength (how well an item is learned) and retrieval strength (how well an item can be retrieved) have become separate measures for retrieval practice. Retrieval strength (also known as recall accuracy) is typically higher for restudied words when tested immediately after practice, whereas tested words were higher as time moves on. This suggests using tests is more beneficial for long-term memory and retrieval which some authors believe is due to limited retrieval success during practice supporting the idea that tests are learning opportunities.

Functional magnetic resonance imaging suggests that retrieval practice strengthens subsequent retention of learning through a &quot;dual action&quot; affecting the anterior and posterior hippocampus regions of the brain. This could support findings that individual differences in personality traits or with working memory capacity, don&#x27;t seem to have any negative impacts of the testing effect, with a greater impact for lower ability individuals.

Despite some doubting knowledge transfer across a topic when testing with some studies showing contradictory evidence suggesting recognition was better than recall, inferential thinking has been supported and the transfer of learning is at its strongest with application of theory to practice, inference questions, medical education, and problems involving medical diagnosis. The transfer can occur across domains, paradigms, and help retention for material not on a final test. Using retrieval practices also produces less forgetting than studying and restudying while helping to identify misconceptions and errors with effects lasting years.

=== Repeated testing ===

Repeated testing have shown statistical significance and results getting better than repeated studying which could be due to testing creating multiple retrieval routes for memory, allowing individuals to form lasting connections between items, or blocking information together which can help with memory retention and schema recall. Using spaced repetition has shown an increase on the testing effect with a greater impact with a delay in testing, but the delay could lead to forgetting or retrieval-induced forgetting.

Delaying the test after a session can have a greater impact so studying in the day should be tested in the evening with a delay, but studying in the evening should have an immediate test due the effect sleep has on memory. Despite divided attention being thought to decrease the testing effect, if it is from a different medium it could enhance the effect.

The rate of forgetting is not affected by the speed or degree of learning but by the type of practice involved.

=== Test difficulty ===

According to the &quot;retrieval effort hypothesis&quot;, &quot;difficult but successful retrievals are better for memory than easier successful retrievals&quot; which supports the idea of finding a desirable difficulty within the retrieval practice considering our memory biases. Learning a language was better when using unfamiliar words compared to familiar words, supporting higher difficulty resulting in greater learning. The difficulty relates to the likelihood of forgetting as the harder it is to remember, the more likely you are to remember and retain the information supporting the notion that more effort is required for longer lasting retention similar to the depth of processing at encoding. Therefore, lack of effort from students studying could be a factor that reduces its efficiency.

Increased difficulty shows decreased initial performance but increased performance on harder tests in the future, so retention and transfer suffer less when training is difficult. Even unsuccessful retrieval can enhance learning, as creating the thought helps with retention due to the generation effect. Like with processing time, it is the qualitative nature of the information that determines retention.

Getting feedback helps with learning but finding a desirable difficulty for the test combined with feedback is more beneficial than studying or testing without feedback. The &quot;Read, Recite, Review&quot; method has been proposed as a method to combine retrieval practice with feedback.

=== Test format ===
The test format doesn&#x27;t seem to impact the results as it is the process of retrieval that aids the learning but transfer-appropriate processing suggests that if the encoding of information is through a format similar to the retrieval format then the test results are likely to be higher, with a mismatch causing lower results. However, when short-answer tests or essays are used greater gains in results are seen when compared to multiple-choice test 

Cued recall can make retrieval easier as it reduces the required retrieval strength from an individual which can help short term results, but can hinder long term retrieval overtime due to reduced retrieval demand during practice. Quicker learning can reduce the rate of forgetting for a short period of time, but the effect doesn&#x27;t last as long as more effortful retrieval. Cueing can be seen when encoding new information overlaps with prior knowledge making retrieval easier or from a visual or auditory aid.

Prior knowledge seems to increase the impact of retrieval practice, but should not be seen as a boundary condition as individuals with higher prior knowledge and individuals with lower prior knowledge both benefit. Pre-testing can be used to get greater results, and the post-testing can be used to facilitate learning and memory of newly studied information, known as the &quot;forward testing effect.&quot; Pre-test or practice test accuracy doesn&#x27;t predict post test results as time affects forgetting 

=== Pre-testing effect ===
The pre-testing effect, also known as errorful generation or pre-questioning, is a related but distinct category where testing material before the material has been learned appears to lead to better subsequent learning performance than would have been the case without the pre-test, provided that feedback is given as to the correct answers once the pre-testing phase is completed or further study is undertaken. Pre-testing has been shown to aid learning in both laboratory. and classroom settings. In terms of specific examples, pre-testing appears to be a beneficial strategy in language learning, science classrooms generally, and specifically with lower ability learners in Chemistry. Pre-testing also seems to be a good way of introducing a lecture series and reduces mind-wandering during lectures. However, while some studies show that it does not seem to be as effective as post testing overall, others show that it is at least as effective as post-testing. The pre-testing effect does appear to be more target focused on the specific material to be learned and should not be seen as correlated with more generalised curiosity. While the strategy has been demonstrated to have learning benefits across different age groups and subject matters, it also appears to be more suited for more concrete material such as learning facts and concepts. It can be used with a variety of materials, including reading passages, videos, and live lectures.

=== Practice methods ===
When compared to concept mapping alone, retrieval practice is more beneficial, despite students not seeing retrieval practice as a useful learning tool. When combined, learner performance was increased, suggesting concept mapping is a tool that should be combined with retrieval practice alongside other non-verbal responses. Retrieval helps with mental organization which can work well with concept mapping. Multimedia testing can be used alongside flashcards as a method of retrieval practice but removing cards too early can result in lower long term retention. Individuals may not correctly interpret the outcome of practice cards contributing to dropped cards which impact future retrieval attempts therefore resulting in lower results due to increased forgetting.

It is advised that students, people in care units and teaching professionals use distributed retrieval practice with feedback to aid their studies. Interleaved practice, self-explanation, and elaborative interrogation can be useful but need more research. Summarization can be useful for individuals trained how to use to get the most from it. Keyword mnemonics and imagery for text have been somewhat helpful but the effects are often short lived. However, if each of these methods are integrated with retrieval elements the testing effect is more likely to occur.

=== Test benefits ===
A list of benefits of retrieval practice.

* Aids later retention
* Identifies knowledge gaps
* Aids future related learning
* Prevents interference from prior material in future learning
* Aids transfer of knowledge to new contexts
* Aids knowledge organization
* Aids retrieval of untested information
* Improves metacognitive monitoring
* Provides feedback to instructors
* Frequent testing encourages study intentions

=== Quizzes ===
A meta-analysis found the following links between frequent low-stakes quizzes in real classes and improved student academic performance:

* There was an association between the use of quizzes and academic performance.
* This association was stronger in psychology classes
* This association was stronger in all classes when quiz performance could improve class grades.
* Students doing well on quizzes tended to lead to students doing well on final exams
* Regular quizzing increased the chances of students passing classes

=== Transfer of learning ===
Learning using retrieval practice appears to be one of the most effective methods for promoting transfer of learning. In particular the following three techniques have been identified as particularly beneficial for transfer especially when combined with feedback: i) Implementing broad rather than narrow retrieval exercises ii) Encouraging meaningful explanations of concepts or topics iii) Using a variety of complexity and formats with questions such as retrieval questions that require inference.

== Considerations ==

=== Complex materials ===
Some researchers have applied aspects of cognitive load theory to suggest the testing effect may disappear with increasing task difficulty due to increased element interactivity. This has been addressed in the literature with studies that show complex learning is benefitted by retrieval practice. Further research has demonstrated that higher-order retrieval does not need to be based on a lower-level factual recall, and that from the beginning of the learning period, both should be combined for best effect.

=== Future research ===
It has been suggested that as most studies on the impact of retrieval practice were conducted in WEIRD countries, this could cause a bias which should be explored in further studies.

<doc id="905663" wikidata="Q6183181" url="?curid=905663" title="Jerry Adair">
<text>Kenneth Jerry Adair (December 17, 1936 – May 31, 1987) was an American professional baseball second baseman and shortstop with the Baltimore Orioles, Chicago White Sox, Boston Red Sox and Kansas City Royals of Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1958 and 1970. Adair spent one season in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB), the main professional baseball league in Japan, playing for the Hankyu Braves (now known as the Orix Buffaloes). He batted and threw right-handed, stood tall and weighed .

==Early life==
Adair was born in Sand Springs, Oklahoma on December 17, 1936 to Kinnie and Ola Adair. He was of partial Cherokee descent, and Kinnie Adair spoke Cherokee. Adair graduated from Sand Springs High School (which was later replaced by Charles Page High School). He earned nine letters in high school, three each in baseball, football, and basketball, and was his school&#x27;s quarterback. His high school coach, former professional baseball and basketball player and star college athlete Cecil Hankins, considered Adair the greatest all-around athlete he ever coached. Adair was known as the &quot;Iceman&quot; in high school because of his coolness under pressure. He was selected to the all-state basketball team in 1955, and was most outstanding player in the summer 1955 all-star game.

Adair entered Oklahoma State University (OSU) in the fall of 1955 on a basketball and baseball scholarship. He played college baseball under coach Toby Greene, and basketball under Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame coach Hank Iba. Adair&#x27;s role as a basketball player was more prominent at OSU. He started for Iba as a sophomore, and was the team&#x27;s second leading scorer that year and in his junior year (his last year at OSU). On February 21, 1957, he was part of the OSU team that came back to defeat Wilt Chamberlain&#x27;s University of Kansas team 56-54, scoring six points, with seven rebounds. He later played an instrumental role in OSU defeating Oscar Robertson&#x27;s Cincinnati Bearcats team, scoring 12 points, with five rebounds.

Adair was OSU&#x27;s shortstop in his junior year, with a team leading .438 batting average. He was named to the All-Big Eight team, an OSU first. He was selected to the All-American second team by the American Baseball Coaches Association. In his two years on the team, the Cowboys were 29–9, with Adair hitting .387.

Adair also played one year in a work/play program for the McPherson (Kansas) BJs in the Ban Johnson League. That year McPherson went to the National Ban Johnson League tournament finals played in Wichita. He pitched many games as well as playing the infield. In one game, while being scouted by coach Greene, he was called on to pitch in relief with a 1-0 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning, with the bases loaded and no outs. Adair struck out the next three batters.

==Professional career==
===Baltimore Orioles===
Adair was signed by the Baltimore Orioles out of Oklahoma State University on September 2, 1958, for a $40,000 bonus. He made his Major League Baseball debut with the club that day against the Washington Senators, coming into the game in the bottom of the 8th inning as a defensive replacement for shortstop Chuck Oertel. He did not get an at bat in the game. Adair&#x27;s first big league at bat came on September 5 against the Boston Red Sox. After drawing a walk and scoring in the 8th inning, Adair reached base again in the ninth inning on a fielder&#x27;s choice. He picked up his first big league hit (a single to left field) in a 3–2 Orioles win over the visiting New York Yankees on September 21. That season, he hit .105 (2-for-19) in 11 games with the Orioles, primarily playing shortstop.

He spent most of the 1959 season with Amarillo Gold Sox, the Orioles affiliate in the Double-A Texas League. He had a .309 batting average in 146 games. When he was called up to the Orioles at the end of the season, Adair hit .314 (11-for-35) in 12 games. He played most of the 1960 season for the Triple-A Miami Marlins, batting .266, and playing principally at shortstop, where he had a .967 fielding percentage. When he was called up to the Orioles at the end of the season, he went 1-for-5 (.200) in 3 games.

Adair&#x27;s first full season in the big leagues came in 1961 with the Orioles, hitting .264 with 9 home runs and 37 RBI in 133 games. Although the majority of his time was spent at second base, he also played some shortstop and third base that year. He had a .987 fielding percentage at second base, and .946 at shortsop. In 1962, his .969 fielding percentage at shortstop was fourth in the league, led by Chicago White Sox shortstop Luis Aparicio at .973. In 1963, Adair played in only 109 games, the fewest he played between 1961 and 1966. He hit only .228 with six home runs, but had a .985 fielding percentage at second base. Had he played in enough games, this would have given him the third best percentage among second basemen that year. 

In 1964, the Orioles had Aparicio at shortstop (via a 1963 trade), Adair at second base, and Brooks Robinson playing third base. Aparicio led American League shortstops with a .979 fielding percentage, Adair led the league&#x27;s second basemen with a .994 fielding percentage (making only five errors all year), and Robinson led AL third basemen with a .972 fielding percentage. Orioles first baseman Norm Siebern was third among AL first basemen in fielding percentage. Both Robinson (16 consecutive Gold Glove Awards) and Aparicio (nine Gold Glove Awards) were elected to the Hall of Fame, in large part based on their fielding ability. Aparicio and Adair ultimately played three years together (1963-1965), and are considered one of the top middle infield combinations in baseball history. Their combined fielding percentage during that time was .984.

Once, during the 1964 season, he was struck in the mouth by a bad throw during the first game of a doubleheader with the Detroit Tigers. The resulting laceration required 11 stitches, but Adair was back in the park in uniform in time to play the entire second game. In 1964, the Orioles finished in third place, two games behind the Yankees for the AL championship.

In 1965, 28-year-old Adair hit .259 with 7 home runs and a career-high 66 RBI in 157 games with the Orioles. He was among American League leaders with 157 games (8th in the AL), 582 at bats (10th in the AL), 26 doubles (7th in the AL), 115 singles (10th in the AL) and 6 sacrifice flies (8th in the AL). As a result, Adair finished 17th in the AL MVP vote that was won by Zoilo Versalles of the Minnesota Twins. He again led all AL second basemen in fielding percentage (.985), and Aparicio led all shortstops (.971).

===Chicago White Sox===
On June 12, 1966, Adair was traded by the Orioles with minor leaguer John Riddle to the Chicago White Sox for Eddie Fisher. He had been supplanted by Davey Johnson as the starting second base to begin the regular season and angrily requested to be traded &quot;any place but Washington; Washington&#x27;s too near Baltimore.&quot; In 105 games with the White Sox, Adair started more games at shortstop than second base, and batted .243 with four home runs for the White Sox. 

===Boston Red Sox===
On June 2, 1967, Adair was traded by the White Sox to the Boston Red Sox for Don McMahon and minor leaguer Rob Snow. Adair played well down the stretch with the Red Sox, hitting .291 with 3 homers and 26 RBI in 89 games, rounding out his season stats to .271 with 3 HR and 35 RBI in 117 games. With his pennant push performance at the plate, coupled with stellar defensive play, Adair finished 15th in the AL MVP balloting. Teammate Carl Yastrzemski won the award that year after claiming the elusive triple crown. The Red Sox lost to the Cardinals in the 1967 World Series, with Adair appearing in five games.

===Kansas City Royals===
Adair was taken by the Kansas City Royals with the 51st pick of the 1968 MLB expansion draft. In the Royals&#x27; inaugural season of 1969, the 32-year-old Adair hit .250 with 5 home runs and 48 RBI in 126 games. His .984 fielded percentage at second base was second in the league (only behind Dick Green, .986).

In 1970, Adair hit just .148 (4-for-27) before being abruptly released on May 5 as he was about to board a plane to make a road trip to Baltimore with the team. Adair had spent much of spring training that year with his six-year-old daughter, Tammy, who had terminal cancer and eventually died and claimed the Royals let him go without taking the family&#x27;s problems into consideration. Royals General Manager Cedric Tallis defended the team&#x27;s decision to release Adair saying &quot;We just felt he couldn&#x27;t help the club&quot;.

In 1970, he also played 33 games for the Tulsa Oilers of the Triple-A American Association, in the St. Louis Cardinals minor league system. He had only 27 at-bats. In 1971, Adair finished his professional career playing 90 games for the Hankyu Braves in the Japan Pacific League.

Adair&#x27;s nickname during his major league days was Casper the Friendly Ghost.

== Coaching ==
Adair later coached for the Oakland Athletics (1972–74, their World Championship years) and the California Angels (1975), working under his former Oriole teammate and manager in Boston Dick Williams in 1972-1973 and 1975, and for Alvin Dark in 1974.

== Legacy ==
While having only a .254 career batting average, he was considered a good clutch hitter (Carl Yastrzemski wrote in his autobiography &quot;Baseball, The Wall, and Me&quot; &quot;That man was one of the coolest clutch hitters I had seen&quot;). However, his greatest strength was his defensive ability. Adair set then-major league records for single-season fielding percentage (.994) and fewest errors (5) in 1964, and followed that up by leading the league in fielding percentage again in 1965. He also set a record for consecutive errorless games by a second baseman (89), and consecutive chances handled without an error (458) from July 22, 1964, through May 6, 1965. His .985 lifetime fielding percentage at second base is better than his hall of fame contemporaries Nellie Fox, Joe Morgan and Bill Mazeroski. As of 2025, he has the 43rd highest fielding percentage in major league history. In addition, he was considered a &quot;gamer&quot; who would often play when injured.

== Honors and awards ==
Adair was inducted into the OSU Baseball Hall of Fame in 2001.

The glove Adair used in 1964 is in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Adair was inducted into the Sand Springs Sandite Hall of Fame in 1992.

The Jerry Adair Baseball Complex in Sand Springs&#x27; River City Parks in Oklahoma was named in honor of Adair.

== Death ==
Adair died of liver cancer on May 31, 1987, in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the age of 50.

<doc id="905664" wikidata="Q212317" url="?curid=905664" title="Sesame oil">
<text>Sesame oil is an edible vegetable oil derived from sesame seeds. The oil is one of the earliest-known crop-based oils. Worldwide mass modern production is limited due to the inefficient manual harvesting process required to extract the oil. Oil made from raw seeds, which may or may not be cold-pressed, is used as a cooking oil. Oil made from toasted seeds is used for its distinctive nutty aroma and taste, although it may be unsuitable for frying, which makes it taste burnt and bitter.

==Manufacture==

===Manufacturing process===

Sesame seeds are protected by a capsule which bursts only when the seeds are completely ripe, a process called dehiscence. The dehiscence time tends to vary, so farmers cut plants by hand and place them together in an upright position to continue ripening, until all the capsules have opened.

Tanzania remains the largest producer of sesame oil and also dominates the global consumption of this product. The African and Asian regions constitute the fastest-developing sesame oil markets. The steady growth in demand being observed here is in line with rising household income and urbanization, as well as an increase in the use of sesame oil for food products and Asian dishes.

While some manufacturers will further refine sesame oil through solvent extraction, neutralization, and bleaching in order to improve its cosmetic aspects, sesame oil derived from quality seeds already possesses a pleasant taste and does not require further purification before it can be consumed. Many consumers prefer unrefined sesame oil due to their belief that the refining process removes important nutrients. Flavor, traditionally an important attribute, was best in oils produced from mild crushing.

Sesame oil is one of the more stable natural oils, but can still benefit from refrigeration and from limited exposure to light and high temperatures during extraction, processing, and storage; this minimizes nutrient loss through oxidation and rancidity. Storage in amber-colored or opaque bottles can help to minimize light exposure.

Sesame oil is a polyunsaturated (PUFA) semi-drying oil. Commercial sesame oil varies in color from light to deep reddish-yellow depending on the color of the seed processed and the method of milling. Provided that the oil is milled from well-cleaned seed, it can be refined and bleached easily to yield a light-colored limpid oil. Sesame oil is rich in oleic and linoleic acids, which together account for 85% of the total fatty acids. Sesame oil has a relatively high percentage of unsaponifiable matter (1.5-2.3%). In India and in some other European countries, it is obligatory to add sesame oil (5-10%) to margarine and generally to hydrogenated vegetable fats which are commonly used as adulterants for butter or ghee.

===Sesame seed market===

About 65% of the annual US sesame crop is processed into oil, and 35% is used in food.

==Nutrients==
A 100 gram (100 ml) reference amount of sesame oil supplies 884 calories of food energy (table). The only essential nutrient having significant content in sesame oil is vitamin K, providing 13% of the Daily Value per 100 grams (table). 

For fats, sesame oil is approximately equal in monounsaturated fat (oleic acid, 40% of total) and polyunsaturated fat (linoleic acid, 42% of total), together accounting for 80% of the total fat content (table). The remaining oil content is primarily palmitic acid, a saturated fat (about 9% of total, USDA table).

== Potential for allergy ==
As with numerous seed and nut foods, sesame oil may produce an allergic reaction, although the incidence of this effect is rare, estimated at 0.1–0.2% of the population. Reports of sesame allergy are growing in developed countries during the 21st century, with the allergic mechanism from oil exposure expressed as contact dermatitis, possibly resulting from hypersensitivity to lignin-like compounds.

==Uses==

===Cooking===
Sesame oil is used for stir-frying, marinades, and as a finishing oil to add nutty flavor to Asian dishes, with light sesame oil best for cooking and toasted sesame oil ideal for flavoring due to its intense taste.

Sesame oil made from seeds that have not been toasted is a pale yellow liquid with a pleasant grain-like odor and somewhat nutty taste, and is used as frying oil. Oil made from pressed and toasted sesame seeds is amber-colored and aromatic, and is used as a flavoring agent in the final stages of cooking.

Despite sesame oil&#x27;s high proportion (41%) of polyunsaturated (omega-6) fatty acids, it is least prone, among cooking oils with high smoke points, to turn rancid when kept in the open. This is due to the natural antioxidants, such as sesamol, present in the oil.

Light sesame oil has a high smoke point and is suitable for deep-frying. Toasted sesame oil is not suitable, but it can be used to stir fry meats and vegetables, for sautéing, and to make omelettes.

Sesame oil is most popular in continental Asia, especially in East Asia and the South Indian states of Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu, where its widespread use is similar to that of olive oil in the Mediterranean.

* East Asian cuisines often use roasted sesame oil for seasoning during cooking, or at the table.
**The Chinese use sesame oil in the preparation of meals.
** In Japan, rāyu is made of chili and sesame oil and used as a spicy topping on various foods, or mixed with vinegar and soy sauce and used as a dip.
* In South India, before the advent of modern refined oils produced on a large scale, sesame oil was traditionally used for curries and gravies. It continues to be used, particularly in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh, mixed with foods that are hot and spicy, as it neutralizes the heat. It is often mixed in with a special spice powder that accompanies &quot;idli&quot; and &quot;dosa&quot;, as well as rice mixed with spice powders (example, &quot;paruppu podi&quot;).

===Religious uses===

In Mandaeism, anointing sesame oil, called &quot;misha&quot; () in Mandaic, is used during rituals such as the masbuta (baptism) and masiqta (death mass), both of which are performed by Mandaean priests.

===Industrial uses===
In industry, sesame oil may be used as:
*a solvent in injected drugs or intravenous drip solutions
*a cosmetics carrier oil
*a coating for stored grains to prevent weevil attacks. The oil also has synergy effects with some insecticides.

Low-grade oil is used locally in soaps, paints, lubricants, and illuminants.

==History==
Historically, sesame was cultivated more than 5000 years ago as a drought-tolerant crop which was able to grow where other crops failed. Sesame was cultivated during the Indus Valley civilization and was the main oil crop. It was probably exported to Mesopotamia around 2500 BCE.

<doc id="905670" wikidata="Q7887930" url="?curid=905670" title="United Kingdom Climate Change Programme">
<text>The United Kingdom&#x27;s Climate Change Programme was launched in November 2000 by the British government in response to its commitment agreed at the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). The 2000 programme was updated in March 2006 following a review launched in September 2004.

In 2008, the UK was the world&#x27;s 9th greatest producer of man-made carbon emissions, producing around 1.8% of the global total generated from fossil fuels.

==Aim and progress==
The aims of the programme are not only to cut all greenhouse gas emissions by the agreed 12.5% from 1990 levels in the period 2008 to 2012 (the international Kyoto commitment), but to go beyond this by cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 20% from 1990 levels by 2010.

When the original programme was published in 2000, it confirmed that UK emissions were already forecast to be around 15% lower by 2010.

As of March 2006, government projections were in line with the official energy policy of the United Kingdom) so that, by 2010, the UK will have reduced its carbon dioxide emissions by about 15-18% below 1990 levels, thus missing the government&#x27;s internal target but achieving its Kyoto Protocol target, with a projected reduction of emissions from the basket of all greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide) of about 23-25% from 1990 levels.

==2000 Climate Change Programme==
The stated strategies of the 2000 programme were to:
*Improve business’ use of energy, stimulate investment and cut costs;
*Stimulate new, more efficient sources of power generation;
*Cut emissions from the transport sector;
*Promote better energy efficiency in the domestic sector, saving householders money;
*Improve the energy efficiency requirements of the building regulations;
*Continue cutting emissions from agriculture;
*Ensure the public sector took a leading role.

==Government actions==
The following are among the actions taken to implement the strategy:

===Climate Change Act===

On 26 November 2008, after cross-party pressure over several years, led by environmental groups, the Climate Change Act became law. The Act puts in place a framework to achieve a mandatory 80% cut in the UK&#x27;s carbon emissions by 2050 (compared to 1990 levels), with an intermediate target of between 34% by 2020 which would have risen in the event of a strong deal at the UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen.

===Renewables Obligation===
Introduced on 1 April 2002, the Renewables Obligation requires all electricity suppliers who supply electricity to end consumers to supply a set portion of their electricity from eligible renewables sources; a proportion that will increase each year until 2015 from a 3% requirement in 2002–2003, via 10.4% in 2010-2012 up to 15.4% by 2015–2016. The UK Government announced in the 2006 Energy Review an additional target of 20% by 2020–21. For each eligible megawatt hour of renewable energy generated, a tradable certificate called a renewables obligation certificate(ROC) is issued by OFGEM.

On or before 31 September following the RO year (1 Apr - 31 Mar) Suppliers can meet their Renewables Obligation by:
*acquiring and redeeming ROCs,
*paying a buy-out price equivalent to £33.24/megawatt hour in 2006/07 and rising each year with retail price index;or
*a combination of redeeming ROCs and paying the buy-out price.

When a supplier meets all or part of its obligation by paying the buy-out price for each MWh of its obligation not discharged by the redemption of ROCs, the money is put into a holding account called the buy-out fund. The buy-out fund is recycled before 1 November to those electricity suppliers who presented ROCs against their Renewables Obligation. This &#x27;recycling&#x27; is distributed equally for each ROC redeemed, those suppliers who did not redeem any ROCs will receive no &#x27;recycling&#x27; from the buy-out fund.

The renewables obligation also makes requirements about how the electricity can be generated. An example is that the co-firing of biomass with coal is to be phased out - and will not be eligible for Renewable Obligation Certificates after 2016 (although the government has announced its intention to revisit the co-firing rules as part of the 2006 Energy Review).

The renewables transport fuel obligation is a separate law, which although is not in force yet, is set to become law. It would require bio-ethanol and bio-diesel to be added to road fuel, up to a limit of 2 or 5.75%. The land required for this would be considerable. It has been estimated (by the NFU) that the biomass could be grown by using all of the UK&#x27;s net wheat exports, and growing wheat on 1,200 square kilometres of land.

===Housing and community grants===
Grants to assist with the installation of renewable energy sources in domestic properties and for community groups were made available through the Clear Skies organisation, and the Major Photovoltaics Demonstration programme. In 2006 these were replaced by the Low Carbon Buildings Programme (LCBP).

===CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme===
The CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme is a mandatory cap and trade scheme, announced in May 2007, that will apply to large non energy-intensive organisations in the public and private sectors, including hotel chains, supermarkets, banks, central government and large Local Authorities. It is anticipated that the scheme will have cut carbon emissions by 1.2 million tonnes of carbon per year by 2020.

The CRC scheme will apply to organisations that have a mandatory half-hourly metered electricity consumption greater than 6,000 MWh per year. This roughly equates to an electricity bill above £500,000 (US$1,000,000), although it would apply to emissions from direct energy use as well as electricity purchased.

===The Green Deal===
The Green Deal is a policy to encourage energy efficiency improvements in the UK&#x27;s building stock. It will be financed through loans attached to the energy bills of the improved properties - The green deal was dropped by government in 2015.

===Electricity Market Reform===
Electricity Market Reform is a UK programme seeking to decarbonise electricity generation in the UK by providing low carbon generators guaranteed income through a contract for difference arrangement.

It is made up of 2 mechanisms: Contracts for Difference (CfD) and the Capacity Market (CM).

==Nottingham Declaration==
Although not part of the central government programme, in local government, over 300 councils have signed up to the &quot;Nottingham Declaration&quot;, launched on 25 October 2000, committing them to work towards reducing emissions.

<doc id="905676" wikidata="Q1112181" url="?curid=905676" title="Ngāti Whātua">
<text>Ngāti Whātua is a Māori iwi (tribe) of the lower Northland Peninsula of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. It comprises a confederation of four hapū (subtribes) interconnected both by ancestry and by association over time: Te Uri-o-Hau, Te Roroa, Te Taoū, Ngāti Whātua o Kaipara and Ngāti Whātua-o-Ōrākei. The five hapū can act together or separately as independent tribes.

Ngāti Whātua&#x27;s territory or &quot;rohe&quot; is traditionally expressed as, &quot;&quot;Tāmaki ki Maunganui i te Tai Hauauru&quot; and &quot;Tāmaki ki Manaia i te Rawhiti&quot;. The northern boundary is expressed as, &quot;Manaia titiro ki Whatitiri, Whatitiri titiro ki Tutamoe, Tutamoe titiro ki Maunganui&quot;. The southern boundary is expressed as, &quot;Te awa o Tāmaki&quot;&quot;. The area runs from Tāmaki River in the south to Maunganui Bluff (at the northern end of Aranga Beach on the west coast) in the north, and to Whangarei Harbour on the east coast. By the time of European settlement in New Zealand, Ngāti Whātua&#x27;s territory was around the Kaipara Harbour and stretching south to , the site of present-day Auckland.

== History ==
Ngāti Whātua descends from the ancestor Tuputupuwhenua (also known as Tumutumuwhenua). The iwi traces its arrival in New Zealand to the Māhuhu-ki-te-rangi canoe, which landed north of the Kaipara Harbour. They also descend from ancestors who migrated from Muriwhenua in the Far North and intermarried with the tribes in Ngāti Whātua&#x27;s territory. By the 16th and 17th century, Ngāti Whātua had become established around the Kaipara Harbour.

Rivalry with Ngāpuhi escalated in the early 19th century when Ngāpuhi acquired muskets. Ngāpuhi attacked Ngāti Whātua in 1807 or 1808 in the battle of Moremonui north of Dargaville – probably the occasion of the first use of firearms in Māori warfare. Ngāti Whātua overcame the Ngāpuhi warriors with hand weapons while Ngāpuhi were reloading their muskets, winning a decisive victory over the attackers. Ngāpuhi, led by Hongi Hika, exacted revenge in 1825 when they defeated Ngāti Whātua in the battle of Te Ika a Ranganui near Kaiwaka.

On 20 March 1840 in the Manukau Harbour area where Ngāti Whātua farmed, paramount chief Apihai Te Kawau signed &quot;Te Tiriti o Waitangi&quot;, the Treaty of Waitangi. Ngāti Whātua sought British protection from Ngāpuhi as well as a reciprocal relationship with the Crown and the Church. Soon after signing the Treaty, Te Kawau offered land on the Waitematā Harbour to William Hobson, the new Governor of New Zealand, for his new capital. Hobson took up the offer and moved the capital of New Zealand to , naming the settlement &quot;Auckland&quot;.

Ngāti Whātua came to national prominence in the 1970s in a dispute over vacant land at Bastion Point, a little way east of the Auckland city centre, adjoining the suburb of Ōrākei. The land, which the New Zealand government had acquired cheaply for public works many decades before, largely reverted to the tribe after a long occupation and passive resistance.

==Governance==

Te Runanga o Ngāti Whātua has a mandate, recognised by the New Zealand Government, to negotiate Treaty of Waitangi settlements for Ngāti Whatua. It is also a mandated iwi organisation under the Māori Fisheries Act, and an Iwi Aquaculture Organisation in the Māori Commercial Aquaculture Claims Settlement Act. It represents Ngāti Whatua as an iwi authority under the Resource Management Act and is a Tūhono organisation.

The Runanga is a Māori Trust Board governed by 11 trustees from 5 takiwā or districts: 1 trustee from Ōrākei, 2 from South Kaipara, 3 from Otamatea, 1 from Whangarei and 4 from Northern Wairoa. As of 2022, the co-chairpersons of the trust are Allan Pivac and Dame Rangimarie Naida Glavish DNZM. JP, the Manahautū is Alan Riwaka, and the trust is based in Whangarei.

The iwi has interest in the territory of Northland Regional Council, Auckland Council, Kaipara District Council and Whangarei District Council.

<text>The IBM 740 CRT Recorder was announced in 1954 and used with the IBM 701, IBM 704, and IBM 709 computers to draw vector graphics images, point by point, on 35 mm photographic film (i.e. microfilm). The 740 film recorder contained digital-to-analog converters and a 7-inch, high precision, electrostatic CRT. The raster size was 1,024 by 1,024, but only 256 resolved spots could be displayed on a vertical or horizontal line. Points could be displayed in one of two intensities, and a line could be drawn from a point, vertically or horizontally, to the edge of the display to form an axis.

Each point to be displayed was stored in a single 36-bit word, with 10 bits each for the X and Y coordinates, and 3 control bits, one to set either high or low intensity and two to indicate that an X or Y axis is to be drawn starting from the given point. If both the X and Y axis bits were set, a 45-degree line was drawn.

The 740&#x27;s CRT used a short persistence &quot;P11&quot; phosphor. The film used was 35 mm and was stored in a magazine that could hold up to 100 feet. ASA 200 speed film was recommended. The film could be advanced under computer control.

The IBM 780 CRT Display was a monitor that could be attached to the 740 and mirror to an operator what was being drawn on 740&#x27;s CRT. The 780 had a 21-inch CRT with a longer persistence (2 second, nominal) &quot;P7&quot; phosphor.

<doc id="905680" wikidata="Q6273860" url="?curid=905680" title="Jonathan Mayhew">
<text>Jonathan Mayhew (October 8, 1720 – July 9, 1766) was a noted American Congregational minister at Old West Church, Boston, Massachusetts.

==Early life==
Mayhew was born at Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, being fifth in descent from Thomas Mayhew (1592–1682), an early settler and the grantee (1641) of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and adjacent islands. Thomas Mayhew, Jr. (1622–1657), his son John (d. 1689) and John&#x27;s son, Experience Mayhew (1673–1758), were active missionaries among the Indians of Marthas Vineyard and the vicinity.

Mayhew graduated from Harvard College in 1744 and in 1749 received the degree of D.D. from the University of Aberdeen.

==Theological views==
So liberal were his theological views that when he was to be ordained minister of the West Church in Boston in 1747, only two ministers attended the first council called for the ordination, and it was necessary to summon a second council. Mayhew&#x27;s preaching made his church essentially the first Unitarian Congregational church in New England, though it was never officially Unitarian. He preached the strict unity of God, the subordinate nature of Christ, and salvation by character. Like other Unitarians of this time, Mayhew believed God punished whole communities if the people were not moral and pious enough. But Mayhew did affirm &quot;the divinity of the Son of God&quot; and never explicitly denied (as Arians do) that the Son is co-eternal with the Father. 

On March 20, 1760, Boston experienced a fire that consumed over three hundred buildings and left about a thousand people without homes.  Three days later, Mayhew preached a sermon that proclaimed that God had caused the fire to chastise Bostonians.  Mayhew declared that God had “determined to let loose his wrath upon the city to ‘rebuke us in his anger, and chasten us in his hot displeasure’. ”  Therefore, Mayhew said, God “caused his wind to blow; and suddenly raised it to such a height, that all endeavours to put a stop to the raging flames, were ineffectual”. Mayhew finished his sermon by warning the people of Boston that unless they repented and reformed enough, they should expect an even greater punishment.  

==Political views==
In politics, Mayhew bitterly opposed the Stamp Act, and urged the necessity of colonial union (or communion) to secure colonial liberties. He was famous, in part, for his 1750 and 1754 election sermons espousing American rights — the cause of liberty and the right and duty to resist tyranny; other famous sermons included &quot;The Snare Broken,&quot; 1766. His sermons and writings were a powerful influence in the development of the movement for liberty and independence.

The extent of his political feeling can be seen in his &quot;Discourse Concerning Unlimited Submission&quot; (complete text), a sermon delivered on the 100th anniversary of the execution of Charles I (January 30, 1649/50). Taking vigorous issue with recent efforts to portray Charles as a martyred monarch, Mayhew began with observations on the antiquity of English liberties. The English constitution, he asserted, “is originally and essentially free.” Roman sources, such as the reliable Tacitus, made it clear that “the ancient Britons … were extremely jealous of their liberties.” England’s monarchs originally held their throne “solely by grant of parliament,” so the ancient English kings ruled “by the voluntary consent of the people.” After forty pages of such historical discourse, Mayhew reached his major point: the essential rightness of the execution of an English king when he too greatly infringed upon British liberties.

The vigor of Mayhew’s sermon established his reputation. It was published not only in Boston, but also in London in 1752 and again in 1767. In Boston, John Adams remembered long afterward that Mayhew’s sermon, “was read by everybody.” Some would say later that this sermon was the first volley of the American Revolution, setting forth the intellectual and scriptural justification for rebellion against the Crown.

In 1763 he turned his attention to the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, a branch of the Church of England established &quot;to send priests and schoolteachers to America to help provide the Church&#x27;s ministry to the colonists&quot;. His &quot;Observations on the Charter and Conduct of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts&quot; was published in Boston and London and raised considerable opposition in England and America; Thomas Secker, then archbishop of Canterbury, wrote an &quot;Answer&quot; the following year.

In 1765, with the provocation of the Stamp Act fresh, Mayhew delivered another rousing sermon on the virtues of liberty and the iniquity of tyranny. The essence of slavery, he announced, consists in subjection to others—“whether many, few, or but one, it matters not.” The day after his sermon, a Boston mob attacked Chief Justice Thomas Hutchinson’s house, and many thought Mayhew was responsible.

Mayhew was Dudleian lecturer at Harvard in 1765. He died July 1766.

A quarter century after his death, the following lines were delivered at the Harvard commencement address of 1792:

 While Britain claim&#x27;d by laws our rights to lead,
 And faith was fetter&#x27;d by a bigot&#x27;s creed.
 Then mental freedom first her power display&#x27;d
 and call&#x27;d a MAYHEW to religion&#x27;s aid.
 For this great truth, he boldly led the van,
 That private judgment was the right of man.

<doc id="905684" wikidata="Q1426477" url="?curid=905684" title="Serial-position effect">
<text>Serial-position effect is the tendency of a person to recall the first and last items in a series best, and the middle items worst. The term was coined by Hermann Ebbinghaus through studies he performed on himself, and refers to the finding that recall accuracy varies as a function of an item&#x27;s position within a study list. When asked to recall a list of items in any order (free recall), people tend to begin recall with the end of the list, recalling those items best (the recency effect). Among earlier list items, the first few items are recalled more frequently than the middle items (the primacy effect).

One suggested reason for the primacy effect is that the initial items presented are most effectively stored in long-term memory because of the greater amount of processing devoted to them. (The first list item can be rehearsed by itself; the second must be rehearsed along with the first, the third along with the first and second, and so on.) The primacy effect is reduced when items are presented quickly and is enhanced when presented slowly (factors that reduce and enhance processing of each item and thus permanent storage). Longer presentation lists have been found to reduce the primacy effect.

One theorised reason for the recency effect is that these items are still present in working memory when recall is solicited. Items that benefit from neither (the middle items) are recalled most poorly. An additional explanation for the recency effect is related to temporal context: if tested immediately after rehearsal, the current temporal context can serve as a retrieval cue, which would predict more recent items to have a higher likelihood of recall than items that were studied in a different temporal context (earlier in the list). The recency effect is reduced when an interfering task is given. Intervening tasks involve working memory, as the distractor activity, if exceeding 15 to 30 seconds in duration, can cancel out the recency effect. Additionally, if recall comes immediately after the test, the recency effect is consistent regardless of the length of the studied list, or presentation rate.

Amnesiacs with poor ability to form permanent long-term memories do not show a primacy effect, but do show a recency effect if recall comes immediately after study. People with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease exhibit a reduced primacy effect but do not produce a recency effect in recall.

==Primacy effect==
In psychology and sociology, the primacy effect (also known as the primacy bias) is a cognitive bias that results in a subject recalling primary information presented better than information presented later on. For example, a subject who reads a sufficiently long list of words is more likely to remember words toward the beginning than words in the middle.

Many researchers have tried to explain this phenomenon through free recall [null tests]. Coluccia, Gamboz, and Brandimonte (2011) explain free recall as participants trying to remember information without any prompting. In some experiments in the late 20th century, it was noted that participants who knew that they were going to be tested on a list presented to them would rehearse items: as items were presented, the participants would repeat those items to themselves and as new items were presented, the participants would continue to rehearse previous items along with the newer items. It was demonstrated that the primacy effect had a greater influence on recall when there was more time between presentation of items so that participants would have a greater chance to rehearse previous (prime) items.

Overt rehearsal was a technique that was meant to test participants&#x27; rehearsal patterns. In an experiment using this technique, participants were asked to recite out loud the items that come to mind. In this way, the experimenter was able to see that participants would repeat earlier items more than items in the middle of the list, thus rehearsing them more frequently and having a better recall of the prime items than the middle items later on.

In another experiment, by Brodie and Murdock, the recency effect was found to be partially responsible for the primacy effect. In their experiment, they also used the overt-rehearsal technique and found that in addition to rehearsing earlier items more than later items, participants were rehearsing earlier items later on in the list. In this way, earlier items were closer to the test period by way of rehearsal and could be partially explained by the recency effect.

In 2013, a study showed that primacy effect is also prominent in decision making based on experience in a repeated-choice paradigm, a learning process also known as operant conditioning. The authors showed that importance attached to the value of the first reward on subsequent behaviour, a phenomenon they denoted as outcome primacy.

In another study, participants received one of two sentences. For example, one may be given &quot;Steve is smart, diligent, critical, impulsive, and jealous.&quot; and the other &quot;Steve is jealous, impulsive, critical, diligent, and smart.&quot; These two sentences contain the same information. The first one suggests positive trait at the beginning while the second one has negative traits. Researchers found that the subjects evaluated Steve more positively when given the first sentence, compared with the second one.

==Recency effect==

Two traditional classes of theories explain the recency effect.

===Dual-store models===
These models postulate that study items listed last are retrieved from a highly accessible short-term buffer, i.e. the short-term store (STS) in human memory. This allows items that are recently studied to have an advantage over those that were studied earlier, as earlier study items have to be retrieved with greater effort from one’s long-term memory store (LTS).

An important prediction of such models is that the presentation of a distraction, for example solving arithmetic problems for 10–30 seconds, during the retention period (the time between list presentation and test) attenuates the recency effect. Since the STS has limited capacity, the distraction displaces later study list items from the STS so that at test, these items can only be retrieved from the LTS, and have lost their earlier advantage of being more easily retrieved from the short-term buffer. As such, dual-store models successfully account for both the recency effect in immediate recall tasks, and the attenuation of such an effect in the delayed free recall task.

A major problem with this model, however, is that it cannot predict the long-term recency effect observed in delayed recall, when a distraction intervenes between each study item during the interstimulus interval (continuous distractor task). Since the distraction is still present after the last study item, it should displace the study item from STS such that the recency effect is attenuated. The existence of this long-term recency effect thus raises the possibility that immediate and long-term recency effects share a common mechanism.

===Single-store models===

According to single-store theories, a single mechanism is responsible for serial-position effects. A first type of model is based on relative temporal distinctiveness, in which the time lag between the study of each list item and the test determines the relative competitiveness of an item’s memory trace at retrieval. In this model, end-of-list items are thought to be more distinct, and hence more easily retrieved.

Another type of model is based on contextual variability, which postulates that retrieval of items from memory is cued not only based on one’s mental representation of the study item itself, but also of the study context. Since context varies and increasingly changes with time, on an immediate free-recall test, when memory items compete for retrieval, more recently studied items will have more similar encoding contexts to the test context, and are more likely to be recalled.

Outside immediate free recall, these models can also predict the presence or absence of the recency effect in delayed free recall and continual-distractor free-recall conditions. Under delayed recall conditions, the test context would have drifted away with increasing retention interval, leading to attenuated recency effect. Under continual distractor recall conditions, while increased interpresentation intervals reduce the similarities between study context and test context, the relative similarities among items remains unchanged. As long as the recall process is competitive, recent items will win out, so a recency effect is observed.

===Ratio rule===

Overall, an important empirical observation regarding the recency effect is that it is not the absolute duration of retention intervals (RI, the time between end of study and test period) or of inter-presentation intervals (IPI, the time between different study items) that matters. Rather, the amount of recency is determined by the ratio of RI to IPI (the ratio rule). As a result, as long as this ratio is fixed, recency will be observed regardless of the absolute values of intervals, so that recency can be observed at all time scales, a phenomenon known as time-scale invariance. This contradicts dual-store models, which assume that recency depends on the size of STS, and the rule governing the displacement of items in the STS.

Potential explanations either then explain the recency effect as occurring through a single, same mechanism, or re-explain it through a different type of model that postulates two different mechanisms for immediate and long-term recency effects. One such explanation is provided by Davelaar et al. (2005), who argue that there are dissociations between immediate and long-term recency phenomena that cannot be explained by a single-component memory model, and who argues for the existence of a STS that explains immediate recency, and a second mechanism based on contextual drift that explains long-term recency. The recency effect as well as the ratio changes in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and therefore can be used as an indicator of this disease condition from the earliest stages of neurodegeneration 

==Related effects==
In 1977, William Crano decided to outline a study to further the previous conclusions on the nature of order effects, in particular those of primacy vs. recency, which were said to be unambiguous and opposed in their predictions. The specifics tested by Crano were:

;Change of meaning hypothesis: The items on the beginning of a list establish a theme that the participants expect the rest of the list to fall into. The participant modified the meaning of some of the words on the list to fit with the expectation he or she established. Watkins and Peynicioglu (1984) explain this as participants changing the meaning of words, deviating from the established theme, to reduce the amount of deviation in the information presented. 
;Inconsistency discounting: Participants would disregard information that was not consistent with previous items presented to them. In other words, discounting involves thinking of inconsistent information as having less value than information that is consistent with other information presented (Devine &amp; Ostrom, 1985).
;Attention decrement hypothesis: Information presented first has a greater influence on participants than information that is presented later, causing a primacy effect to occur, even if the information is consistent. Steiner and Rain (1989) explain people pay more attention to information presented at the beginning, but progressively pay less attention to the information presented to them. The primacy effect occurs because participants pay attention to the beginning information and ignore the information presented later. On the other hand, if participants are in a situation where they have to continuously pay attention to information, a recency effect may occur.

The continuity effect or lag-recency effect predicts that having made a successful recall, the next recalled item is less likely to come from a remote serial position, rather than a nearby serial position (Kahana, Howard, Zaromb &amp; Wingfiend, 2002). The difference between the two items&#x27; serial position is referred to as serial-position lag. Another factor, called the conditional-response probability, is the likelihood of recalling a certain serial-position lag. A graph of serial-position lag versus conditional response probability reveals that the next item recalled minimizes absolute lag, with a higher likelihood for the adjacent than the previous one.

<text>The men&#x27;s 100 metre [[breaststroke]] event at the 2004 Summer Olympics was contested at the Olympic Aquatic Centre of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Athens, Greece on August 14 and 15.

After finishing fourth in Sydney (2000), Japan&#x27;s Kosuke Kitajima edged out U.S. swimmer and world-record holder Brendan Hansen to claim the gold medal by 0.17 of a second, in a time of 1:00.08. Katajima used an illegal dolphin kick during a pull-out, however he was not disqualified, and the rules were changed less than a year later to allow for a single dolphin kick after the start and after each wall. Hansen, who turned 23 on the final day, earned a silver in 1:00.25, while France&#x27;s Hugues Duboscq held off onrushing American Mark Gangloff to take the bronze in 1:00.88.

Earlier in the semifinals Hansen lowered an Olympic record to 1:00.01 that had been set by his archrival Kitajima in the preliminaries by just 0.02 of a second.

Russia&#x27;s Roman Sloudnov, the third-fastest man in Olympic history and the first to swim under one minute, missed the top 8 final by 0.18 seconds (1:01.54).

<text>The Arctic Ocean Flotilla (), was a Russian military flotilla stationed in Aleksandrovsk (present-day Polyarny) near the mouth of the Kola Gulf, Iokanga, and Arkhangelsk. 

==History==

On the official formation of the AOF began and by September was largely complete. By the end of 1917 the AOF comprised the battleship &quot;Chesme&quot;, the cruisers &quot;Askold&quot; and &quot;Varyag&quot;, 6 destroyers, 3 submarines and other ships. The AOF&#x27;s operational zone included the Barents Sea - from the Norwegian border to the Kara Gates - including the White Sea. Its mission was to secure uninterrupted the sea lines of communications connecting Russia with its Entente allies.

After Bolshevik Russia&#x27;s withdrawal from World War I in March 1918, the flotilla comprised approximately 90 combatant and auxiliary ships. In August 1918 Allied interventionist forces and the White Army captured the best ships of the AOF. The rest of the ships were intentionally put out of commission or destroyed.
