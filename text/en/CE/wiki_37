<text>John Gordon, 16th Earl of Sutherland (1661–1733) was a Scottish nobleman and army officer.

He was the only son of George Gordon, 15th Earl of Sutherland (1633–1703), and his wife, Jean Wemmyss.

Upon his father&#x27;s death in 1703 he succeeded as earl of Sutherland. He supported the revolution of 1688 and was a commissioner for the union of England and Scotland. He was a Scottish representative peer in four parliaments, president of the Board of Trade and manufactures, and lord-lieutenant of the eight northern counties of Scotland. In 1703 he was appointed a privy councillor by Queen Anne.

He aided in putting down the Jacobite rising of 1715. When the rebellion had been quashed, Gordon was invested by George I with the Order of the Thistle and was granted an annual pension of £1200 in recognition of his services. In 1719 he led his regiment in the Battle of Glen Shiel, which brought to an end the third Jacobite rising.

He resumed the name of Sutherland, instead of Gordon. In 1719 by decree of Lyon Court, he was thereafter recognised Chief of the Clan Sutherland.

==Family==
He married three times, first to Helen, daughter of William Cochrane, Lord Cochrane and Catherine Kennedy; secondly to Katherine Tollemache, daughter of Sir Lionel Tollemache, 3rd Baronet and widow of James Stuart, Lord Doune; and thirdly to Frances Hodgson. He had two children with Helen:
*William Gordon, Lord Strathnaver (19 December 168313 July 1720) who married Catherine Morrison
*Jean Gordon (c. 1692, Scotland11 February 1747, Virginia)), who married James Lauderdale, the son of John Maitland, 5th Earl of Lauderdale.
Persuasive claims have been put forth in the Allan P. Gray account, that the &quot;Honbl. Capt.&quot; referenced in the Dugald Gilchrist Papers is Lt. Col. James Sutherland of Uppat, of the 38th Foot, and superintendent of the estate of the Countess of Sutherland at Dunrobin, making James Sutherland an illegitimate son to Gordon (mother unknown). Illegitimate children are fairly common and though unproven this would account for the mysterious and suspicious familiarity between James Sutherland and the acquisition of the Uppat estate, the military appointments, and the closeness to the Gordon family at large.

<doc id="915027" wikidata="Q6554037" url="?curid=915027" title="Linguistic determinism">
<text>Linguistic determinism is the concept that language and its structures limit and determine human knowledge or thought, as well as thought processes such as categorization, memory, and perception. The term implies that people&#x27;s native languages will affect their thought process and therefore people will have different thought processes based on their mother tongues.

Linguistic determinism is the &quot;strong&quot; form of linguistic relativity (popularly known as the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis), which argues that individuals experience the world based on the structure of the language they habitually use. Since the 20th century, linguistic determinism has largely been discredited by studies and abandoned within linguistics, cognitive science, and related fields.

==Overview==
The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis branches out into two theories: linguistic determinism and linguistic relativity. Linguistic determinism is viewed as the stronger form – because language is viewed as a complete barrier, a person is stuck with the perspective that the language enforces – while linguistic relativity is perceived as a weaker form of the theory because language is discussed as a lens through which life can be focused, but the lens can be changed, and perspectives can be changed along with it.

The term &quot;Sapir–Whorf hypothesis&quot; is considered a misnomer by linguists and academics, because Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf never co-authored any works (however, Whorf had studied under Sapir at Yale University ), and never stated their ideas in terms of a hypothesis. The distinction between a weak and a strong version of this hypothesis is also a later invention; Sapir and Whorf never set up such a dichotomy, although often in their writings their views are expressed in stronger or weaker terms. The two linguists were nevertheless among the first to formulate the principle of linguistic relativity.

While Sapir exercised the idea that language is essential to understanding one&#x27;s worldview and that difference in language implies a difference in social reality, he never directly explored how language affects thought, although significant traces of the linguistic relativity principle underlie his perception of language.

Whorf explored Sapir&#x27;s concept further and reformulated Sapir&#x27;s thought in his essay &quot;Science and Linguistics&quot;. In Whorf&#x27;s more radical view, the relationship between language and culture played a crucial role in the perception of reality. The formulation of thoughts, according to Whorf, is not a conscious, independent process, rather, thoughts are determined by the specific grammar and vocabulary of the language in which ideas are expressed. The world, as each individual views it, is, therefore, organized and rationalized through language; because language is the way thoughts are expressed, the language can also shape thoughts.

Linguistic determinism and linguistic relativity are heavily debated and researched topics among academics, like linguists Guy Deutscher and Eric Lenneburg, psychologists such as Peter Gordon and Steven Pinker, and even philosophers like Friedrich Nietzsche. There are critiques and support for both theories as outlined in research among Guugu-Yimidhirr, Hopi, and Pirahã speakers.

==Evidence and criticisms==
=== Hopi ===
Whorf&#x27;s conclusion was largely based upon a close examination and extensive study of the Native American Hopi language spoken among natives of southwestern North America. During earlier years, Whorf published a number of essays in which he analyzed various linguistic aspects of Hopi. For example, a work called &quot;An American Indian model of the universe&quot; (1936) explores the implications of the Hopi verb system concerning the conception of space and time.

In the course of his research, Whorf noticed that Hopi and some other languages (Hebrew, Aztec, and Maya) were built upon a different structure than that of English and many other languages which he called SAE (Standard Average European) languages. He discovered several significant features distinguishing Hopi from SAE languages which he used to continue formulating his concept of linguistic determinism.

For example, Hopi is a &quot;timeless&quot; language, whose verbal system lacks tenses. The assessment of time is different from the SAE linear temporal view of past, present, and future because it indicates the event&#x27;s time duration. Whorf observed that sense of time varies with each observer:

Hopi time is non-dimensional and cannot be counted or measured in typical SAE language measurement, i.e. the Hopi will not say &quot;I stayed six days,&quot; but &quot;I left on the sixth day.&quot; In the Hopi perception of time, it is crucial to determine whether an event can be warranted to have occurred, to be occurring, or to be expected to occur. Hopi grammatical categories signify a view of the world as an ongoing process, where time is not divided into fixed segments so that certain things recur, e.g. minutes, evenings, or days. The linguistic structure of SAE languages, on the other hand, gives its speakers a more fixed, objectified and measurable understanding of time and space, where they distinguish between countable and uncountable objects and view time as a linear sequence of past, present, and future.

The Hopi language also contains a verb system which, unlike SAE languages, can make a single-action verb into a repeated/prolonged action verb with an extension of the word. For example, &quot;tíri&quot; translates to &quot;he gives a start&quot; but &quot;tirírita&quot; becomes &quot;he is trembling&quot;. SAE languages translate the meaning of these verbs differently so, in support of linguistic determinism, Whorf might have used this to argue that the Hopi and the SAE speakers think about these verbs differently, thus their language is shaped by their thoughts.

Whorf argues that since thought is expressed and transmitted through language, it follows that a differently structured language must shape thought along its lines, thus influencing perception. Consequently, a Hopi speaker who perceives the world through the medium of his language must see reality through the patterns laid down by its linguistic structure.

An outspoken critic of linguistic determinism, cognitive psychologist Steven Pinker, known for his alignment with Chomsky&#x27;s universalist ideas, disagrees strongly with Whorf&#x27;s analysis. Pinker argued that Whorf relied too heavily on linguistic data alone to draw conclusions regarding the relationship between language and thought. In his book, The Language Instinct, Pinker dismisses linguistic determinism as a &quot;conventional absurdity,&quot; instead proposing a universal language of thought – termed Mentalese.

He asserts that Whorf was completely mistaken in his characterization of the Hopi as having no concept of time and that the Hopi do in fact have tense, units of time, temporal metaphors, and a complex system of time-keeping.

=== Guugu Yimithirr ===
Linguist Guy Deutscher, a supporter of linguistic relativity – the weaker counterpart of linguistic determinism – used research among the Guugu Yimithirr to challenge the validity of linguistic determinism. While linguistic relativists believe that language influences thought, they do not support the concept that language is a permanent lens through which all thoughts must be filtered. In Deutscher&#x27;s book &quot;Through the Language Glass&quot;, the chapter &quot;Where the Sun Doesn&#x27;t Rise in the East&quot; discusses the language Guugu Yimithirr spoken by aboriginal Australians and how it reinforces linguistic relativity.

Deutscher introduces the Guugu Yimithirr language, where they describe everything geocentrically based on its cardinal direction (the chair is to the East) rather than egocentrically (the chair is to your right). It is clear how this system of expressing position and location influenced the Guugu Ymithirr&#x27;s conceptualization of space. Their description of objects&#x27; locations, within photos or on television, would change based on the rotation of the media because they described things using cardinal directions. For example, if there was a photograph with a tree on the left side of the photo and a girl on the right side, the speakers of Guugu Yimithirr would describe the tree as West of the girl. If the photo was then rotated 90 degrees clockwise the tree would now be described as North of the girl.

The implications, as Deutscher describes, were that the speakers of Guugu Yimithirr have a &quot;perfect pitch&quot; for direction and that their sense of direction is completely non-egocentric. In one experiment, speakers were asked to recall a very recent event and describe it. The people recalled their placement, as well as the placement of important people and objects around them perfectly, even accounting for their position in the retelling. Many years later, the same people were asked to recall that same event, and it was shown that over time, they were still able to accurately recall the directionality of objects and people. Deutscher argues that this example illustrates that geocentric direction is encoded into the memories of Guugu Ymithirr because their language requires it. More broadly, they see the world differently due to their unique conceptualization of space, but this does not mean that they are trapped within the constraints of their language.

In an interview about his work, Deutscher condemned Whorf&#x27;s strong concept of linguistic relativism because there is no evidence that language can truly restrict the ability to reason or to gain knowledge. Even if languages do not provide &quot;ready made labels&quot; for certain concepts or objects, most people are still able to understand and discuss these ideas.

=== Pirahã ===
Similar to the claims that Hopi prevents its speakers from thinking about time, some linguists allege that the Pirahã language spoken by natives in South American Amazonia prevents its speakers from thinking about quantity and numbers. The speakers of Pirahã are also, for the most part, incapable of math.

Peter Gordon, a psychologist from Columbia University, studied the speakers of the Pirahã language. He has conducted many experiments on a small representative number of these speakers. Gordon highlights eight experiments involving seven Pirahã speakers. Six of the experiments were all related in that the speakers were instructed to match groups of items to the correct number displayed elsewhere. The other two experiments had them recall how many items had been placed into a container, and lastly differentiate between various containers by the number of symbols that were pictured on the outside. Gordon found that the speakers of Pirahã could distinguish between the numbers one, two, and three relatively accurately, but any quantity larger than that was essentially indistinguishable to them. He also observed that the more the amount represented by the number increased, the poorer the subjects performed. Gordon concluded, in direct contrast to Deutscher, that speakers of Pirahã are restricted to thinking about numbers through symbols or other representations. These speakers think of items as small, larger, or many. The speakers did not demonstrate an ability to learn numbers; after being taught in the Portuguese language for eight months, not one individual could count to ten.

Daniel Everett, a linguist who also studied the Pirahã, claimed that the Pirahã language also lacks recursion or nesting – the term which describes the ability of a finite set of grammatical rules to create an infinite combination of expressions and was previously thought to be a feature of all languages. This argument includes the possibility that the thoughts of the speakers are influenced by their language in various ways as well. Whether or not Pirahã lacks recursion remains a topic of intense debate and linguistic determinism has been widely criticized for its absolutism and refuted by linguists.

One such argument comes from Michael Frank et al. who continued Daniel Everett&#x27;s research and ran further experiments on the Pirahã published in &quot;Numbers as a cognitive technology,&quot; and found that Everett was wrong, the Pirahã did not have words for &quot;one,&quot; or &quot;two,&quot; but instead had words for &quot;small,&quot; &quot;somewhat larger,&quot; and &quot;many.&quot;

For example, one may perceive different colors even while missing a particular word for each shade, like New Guinea aborigines can distinguish between the colors green and blue even though they have only one lexical entry to describe both colors. In communities where language does not exist to describe color, it does not mean the concept is void – rather the community may have a description or unique phrase to determine the concept. Everett describes his research into the Pirahã tribe who use language to describe color concepts in a different way to English speakers: &quot;[...] each word for color in Pirahã was actually a phrase. For example, biísai did not mean simply &#x27;red&#x27;. It was a phrase that meant &#x27;it is like blood&#x27;.&quot;

Thus, in its strong version &#x27;Whorfian hypothesis&#x27; of linguistic determination of cognition has been widely refuted. In its weaker form, however, the proposal that language influences thinking has frequently been discussed and studied.

=== Additional examples ===
Linguistic determinism can also be evident in situations where the means of drawing attention to a certain aspect of an experience is language. For example, in French, Spanish or Russian there are two ways to address a person because those languages have two second-person pronouns – singular and plural. The choice of pronoun depends on the relationship between the two people (formal or informal) and the degree of familiarity between them. In this respect, the speaker of any of those languages is always thinking about the relationship when addressing another person and therefore unable to separate those two processes.

Other studies supporting the principle of linguistic determinism have shown that people find it easier to recognize and remember shades of colors for which they have a specific name. For example, there are two words in Russian for different shades of blue, and Russian-speakers are faster at discriminating between the shades than are English-speakers.

Pinker criticizes this argument for linguistic determinism as well. He points out that although a plethora of languages label colors differently, this variation in language cannot change the human biological process of color perception; he also notes that there are universal tendencies in the color labels that languages possess (i.e. if a language has two terms, they will be for white and black; with three terms, add red; with four, add either yellow or green).

Pinker thinks everybody thinks in the same language known as Mentalese and knowledge of a particular language constitutes the ability to translate this Mentalese into a string of words for the sake of communication.

=== General semantics ===
General semantics was a therapy program created by Polish-American scholar Alfred Korzybski in the 1920s for the purpose of altering behavior. It has been regarded as a reliable method and produced effective results concerning altering behavior.

Language acts as the basis for behavioral therapy; the methods used are based on the idea that language influences human thoughts, feelings, and behaviors. Korzybski&#x27;s program assumes that people misappropriate language, creating damaging effects. By clarifying language, participants create a more accurate mental representation, which in turn creates an emotional response.

As such, the general idea behind general semantics is to alter your language to change the feelings created within the mind-space, so as to elicit the desired response. According to Korzybski, the mind consists of different silent and verbal levels. On the nonverbal level, there exist feelings, thought, and nervous system responses, and on the verbal level there are language systems. He instructs people to understand any given word as just a lexical representation and nothing more and to react accordingly. This is to avoid misappropriation of thoughts and feelings attached to any one thing. Because this program has been shown to produce effective results, this has large implications that language determines thought, supporting linguistic determinism.

=== Eric Lenneberg and Roger Brown (1954) ===
Psycholinguists Eric Lenneberg and Roger Brown were among the first to refute Whorf&#x27;s ideas of linguistic determinism. They identify Whorf&#x27;s major ideas as (a) the world is experienced differently by speakers of different languages and (b) language is causally linked to these cognitive differences. They explore the two types of evidence Whorf uses to argue for the existence of cognitive differences between linguistic communities: lexical differences and structural differences.

==== Lexical differences ====
Lenneberg and Brown analyze the example of Inuit snow terms. They claim that their three distinct terms for what English speakers would simply call &quot;snow&quot; do not indicate that English speakers cannot perceive these differences, but rather that they just do not label them. They go on to point out that, on occasion, speakers of English do classify different types of snow (i.e. &quot;good-packing snow&quot; and &quot;bad-packing snow&quot;) but do so with phrases instead of a single lexical item. They conclude that English speakers&#x27; and Inuit speakers&#x27; worldviews cannot differ in this way, given that both groups are able to discriminate between different types of snow.

==== Structural differences ====
To refute Whorf&#x27;s notion that structural categories correspond to symbolic categories, Lenneberg and Brown point out that structural categories rarely have consistent meanings. When they do, these meanings are not necessarily evident to speakers, as the case of grammatical gender in French illustrates. All French words with feminine gender do not reflect “feminine” qualities, nor do they share any common attributes. Lenneberg and Brown conclude that the existence of structural classes alone cannot be interpreted as reflective of differences in cognition.

==== Conclusions ====
Lenneberg and Brown ultimately conclude that the causal relationship between linguistic differences and cognitive differences cannot be concluded based on the evidence Whorf provides, which is solely linguistic in nature. They do, however, appear to find the proposition worthy of study, and pursue the study of color terms in order to supplement linguistic evidence with psychological data.

== In literature and media ==

=== George Orwell&#x27;s 1984: Newspeak ===
In Orwell&#x27;s famous dystopian novel, 1984, the fictional language of Newspeak provides a strong example of linguistic determinism. The restricted vocabulary and grammar make it impossible to speak or even &quot;think&quot; of rebelling against the totalitarian government, instead aligning its speakers with the ideology of Ingsoc. Newspeak highlights the deterministic proposition that if a language does not have the means to express certain ideas, its speakers cannot conceptualize them. Orwell devotes the Appendix to a description of Newspeak and its grammar:

The purpose of Newspeak was not only to provide a medium of expression for the world-view and mental habits proper to the devotees of Ingsoc, but to make all other modes of thought impossible. It was intended that when Newspeak had been adopted once and for all and Oldspeak forgotten, a heretical thought – that is, a thought diverging from the principles of Ingsoc – should be literally unthinkable, at least so far as thought is dependent on words. Its vocabulary was so constructed as to give exact and often very subtle expression to every meaning that a Party member could properly wish to express, while excluding all other meanings and also the possibility of arriving at them by indirect methods.

It is worth noting that the main character Winston Smith, and others, were able to both conceive and speak of rebellion, despite the influences of Newspeak. 1984 does, however, take place before the full imposition of Newspeak; characters spoke both a combination of Newspeak and Oldspeak (standard English), which may have allowed for heretical thought and action.

=== In philosophy ===
Friedrich Nietzsche lived before the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was formulated, however, many of his views line up with the assumptions of linguistic determinism. He is credited with the term &quot;Language as a prison&quot;. Alfred Korzybski also supports the hypothesis inadvertently through general semantics. German philosopher Nietzsche famously wrote, &quot;We cease to think if we do not want to do it under linguistic constraints,&quot; which was originally translated incorrectly as &quot;We have to cease to think if we refuse to do so in the prison-house of language.&quot; The phrase &quot;prison-house of language&quot; came to represent the extreme position regarding linguistic determinism. Although Nietzsche&#x27;s position was not quite as drastic as the prison-house view, he did believe that language acts as the building blocks of thought, fundamentally shaping and influencing it. This was his explanation as to why cultural differences exist: because the language is different, the thought process is therefore different.

Nietzsche also wrote that there is the &quot;will to power and nothing besides,&quot; and this is another way Nietzsche expresses that language is a fixed structure that is responsible for the desires, thoughts, and actions of humans. This represents linguistic determinism, making language the &quot;prison&quot; that minds are therefore trapped in. According to Nietzsche things like table, or rain are incomprehensible without the words being present in language.

=== &quot;Arrival&quot; (2016) ===
Based on the short story &quot;Story of Your Life&quot; by Ted Chiang, the science-fiction film &quot;Arrival&quot; rests on the notion of linguistic determinism. It follows linguist Louise Banks as she is recruited to decipher the messages of extraterrestrial visitors to Earth. As she learns their language of complex circular symbols, she begins to see flashes of her daughter&#x27;s life and death. It later becomes evident that these flash back-like visions are glimpses into her future. By acquiring the alien language and its nonlinear notion of time, Banks is able to see both past and future. The award-winning movie illustrates an example of the strong version of the Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis since it presupposes that language determines thought. Learning an extraterrestrial language affected Banks&#x27;s worldview so drastically that it completely transformed her perception of time.

=== Experimental languages in science fiction ===
The possibility of linguistic determinism has been explored by a variety of authors, mostly in science fiction. There exist some languages, like Loglan, Ithkuil and Toki Pona for instance, which have been constructed for the purpose of testing the assumption. However, no formal tests appear to have been done.

==Role in literary theory==
Linguistic determinism is a partial assumption behind developments in rhetoric and literary theory. For example, French philosopher Jacques Derrida dissected the terms of &quot;paradigmatic&quot; hierarchies (in language structures, some words exist only with antonyms, such as light/dark, and others exist only with relation to other terms, such as father/son and mother/daughter; Derrida targeted the latter). He believed that if one breaks apart the hidden hierarchies in language terms, one can open up a &quot;lacuna&quot; in understanding, an &quot;aporia,&quot; and free the mind of the reader/critic. Similarly, Michel Foucault&#x27;s New Historicism theory posits that there is a quasi-linguistic structure present in any age, a metaphor around which all things that can be understood are organized. This &quot;episteme&quot; determines the questions that people can ask and the answers they can receive. The episteme changes historically: as material conditions change, so the mental tropes change, and vice versa. When ages move into new epistemes, the science, religion, and art of the past age look absurd. Some Neo-Marxist historians have similarly looked at culture as permanently encoded in a language that changes with the material conditions. As the environment changes, so too do the language constructs.

<doc id="915029" wikidata="Q7432076" url="?curid=915029" title="Scholastic chess in the United States">
<text>Scholastic chess in the United States has progressively grown in recent years, evidenced by the increasing membership numbers of school-aged children in the United States Chess Federation. The onset of scholastic chess in the United States began in the early 1970s due to the &quot;Fischer Boom&quot;, the phenomenon of markedly increased interest in chess in the United States due to the ascendency of eventual world champion Bobby Fischer. The first large-scale open national scholastic chess tournament was the National High School Championship, which was started by Bill Goichberg in 1969; the winner of the inaugural event was John Watson.

Since the 1990s, the number of student participants in national scholastic chess tournaments has also been steadily climbing, as shown by the rapid growth of the major national championship, the National Scholastic Chess Championships. Of course, with the exception of the few students competing at the top level, most participants are there to make friends, learn new skills, and simply have a good time.

==Tournaments==

===Format of tournaments===
As far as the competition and awards are concerned, there are both team and individual awards at each grade and skill level. This format encourages players of all levels to compete for trophies and awards against opponents of similar playing ability. Generally, tournaments consists of seven rounds (games) spread over three days, where players with the same score coming into that round are paired against each other.

With one point for a win, half a point for a draw, and zero points for a loss, the players with the highest individual score after seven rounds are ranked for individual awards. In the team competition, the four highest scoring players from a particular school or club sum their scores for an overall team score. With so many scoring possibilities based on many individual outcomes, the team event usually causes the most discussion, planning and anticipation between coaches, players, and parents.

===Nationals===
The major national scholastic chess championships are the National High School (K-12) championship (est. 1969), National Junior High School (K-9) championship (est. 1973), the National Elementary (K-6) championship (est. 1976), and the National Primary (K-3) championship (est. 1983). These tournaments, held annually during the spring, have been around for the longest period of time, and typically attract the most participants, with the National Elementary championship often being the largest event (in terms of participants). Only five players in history have won the National Elementary, Junior High School and High School championships: Joel Benjamin, Joshua Waitzkin, Nawrose Nur, Danial Asaria, and Harutyun Akopyan; only Waitzkin, Nur, and Asaria have won the National Primary championship as well. Danial Asaria won the 2020 High School Senior Rapid, the 2016 National Junior High School Chess Championship K-8, the 2015 National K-12 Grade Championship, the National Junior Chess Congress 2014, and the 2012 National Elementary Chess championship. Akshat Chandra won the National High School Championship (K-12) in 2015, and the SuperNational Junior High School Championship (K-9) in 2013, both in his first and only appearance, but never played in the National Elementary Championship due to his late start in Chess.

Two prominent scholastic events which precede these tournaments in inception are the United States Junior Open championship (open to all players under the age of 21), and the United States Junior Invitational (Closed) championship (open to the top nine rated players under age 20 plus the previous year&#x27;s U.S. Junior Open champion). These two are the oldest scholastic tournaments in the United States, with the winner of the U.S. Junior Closed being declared the United States Junior Chess Champion. Notable winners of the United States Junior Open (est. 1946) include Arthur Bisguier, Bobby Fischer, Yasser Seirawan, Greg Shahade, Shearwood McClelland III, Jennifer Shahade, and Asuka Nakamura. These tournaments are typically held during the summer. Previous winners of the United States Junior Invitational (est. 1966) include Larry Christiansen, Patrick Wolff, Joshua Waitzkin, Tal Shaked, Hikaru Nakamura, Robert Hess, Ray Robson, and Akshat Chandra. The preeminent invitational championship for players under age 16 is the U.S. Cadet Championship, which consists of the top eight rated players under then age of 16. Previous winners of this championship include Tal Shaked, Vinay Bhat, Aaron Pixton, and Jordy Mont-Reynaud.

In 1985, a new national scholastic championship, known as the Denker Tournament of High School Champions was inaugurated, pitting the scholastic high school champions of each state against each other for this championship. Previous winners include Alexander Fishbein, Ilya Gurevich, Jesse Kraai, and Abby Marshall. This tournament is typically held during the summer at the same time as the U.S. Open Chess Championship.

In 1991, another new national championship was introduced, known as the National School Grade championships. The idea of this tournament was to determine national individual and team championships for each grade (Kindergarten through 12th grade). This tournament typically occurs in late November/early December. Previous winners include Vinay Bhat, Fabiano Caruana, Abby Marshall, Shearwood McClelland III, Asuka Nakamura, Hikaru Nakamura, and Ray Robson.

In the 2000s, new national championships held include the National Youth Action championship (held in November) and the U.S. Junior Chess Congress (held in February).

Unofficially, the record for most individual national championships is 13, shared by Harutyun Akopyan and Asuka Nakamura.

In 2013, US Junior Chess Champion was GM Daniel Naroditsky, and in 2014 it was GM Kayden Troff.

====Previous repeat team winners====
Previous repeat winners of the team events for the different age groups include the Julia R. Masterman School, from Philadelphia, PA, Stuyvesant High School and Hunter College High School, both from New York, NY, The Shelby School, from Payson, AZ, Catalina Foothills High School, from Tucson, AZ, and Edward R. Murrow High School, in Brooklyn, NY, the subject of a 2007 book, The Kings of New York: A Year Among the Geeks, Oddballs and Geniuses Who Make Up America&#x27;s Top High-School Chess Team, by Michael Weinreb.

===Supernationals===
Normally the major tournaments (high school, junior high school, elementary/primary) will be held in different locations at different times, to allow participation in multiple events. However, beginning in 1997, there has been a single event known as the &quot;Supernationals&quot; where all events are held in one place simultaneously; the idea of the Supernationals was born in the early 1990s partially in response to concerns that young prodigies may win more than one championship in the same year (for example, the national elementary and national junior high school championship). This event currently occurs every four years; the previous two Supernational events have shown huge participation numbers. The first event was held in Knoxville, Tennessee in 1997, and attracted 4,298 players.

==The Dean of Scholastic Chess==
At the 2018 US Chess Delegate&#x27;s Meeting, in Middleton, Wisconsin, Dewain Barber was named &quot;Dean of Scholastic Chess&quot;. Barber has been a tremendous advocate of scholastic chess in the United States and has contributed to the development of a national invitational events for middle school state champions.

<text>, formal rank designations: was the highest rank in the Imperial Japanese Navy. The term was used for both the navy and the Imperial Japanese Army, and was a largely honorific title awarded for extremely meritorious service to the Emperor. In the Meiji period, the title was awarded to five generals and three admirals. In the Taishō period it was awarded to six generals and six admirals, and in the Shōwa period it was awarded to six generals and four admirals. It was similar to Admiral of the Fleet in the Royal Navy and Fleet admiral in the United States Navy.

<text>Brother Guy J. Consolmagno, SJ (born September 19, 1952), is an American research astronomer, physicist, religious brother, director of the Vatican Observatory, and President of the Vatican Observatory Foundation.

==Life==
Consolmagno attended the University of Detroit Jesuit High School before he obtained his S.B. (1974) and S.M. (1975) degrees at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. (1978) at the University of Arizona&#x27;s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory, all in planetary science. After postdoctoral research and teaching from 1978 to 1980 at Harvard College Observatory and from 1980 to 1983 at MIT, in 1983 he joined the US Peace Corps to serve in Kenya for two years, teaching astronomy and physics. After his return he took a position as Assistant Professor at Lafayette College in Easton, Pennsylvania.

In 1989 he entered the Society of Jesus, and took vows as a brother in 1991. On entry into the order, he was assigned as an astronomer to the Vatican Observatory, where he also serves as curator of the Vatican Meteorite collection, a position he has held since then. In addition to his continuing professional work in planetary science, he has also studied philosophy and theology.

His research is centered on the connections between meteorites and asteroids, and the origin and evolution of small bodies in the Solar System. In addition to over 40 refereed scientific papers, he has co-authored several books on astronomy for the popular market, which have been translated into multiple languages. During 1996, he took part in the Antarctic Search for Meteorites, ANSMET, where he discovered a number of meteorites on the ice fields of Antarctica. An asteroid was named in his honour by the International Astronomical Union, IAU in 2000 - 4597 Consolmagno.

He believes in the need for science and religion to work alongside one another rather than as competing ideologies. In 2006, he said, &quot;Religion needs science to keep it away from superstition and keep it close to reality, to protect it from creationism, which at the end of the day is a kind of paganism – it&#x27;s turning God into a nature god.&quot; Consolmagno was the Chair of the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society, serving from October 2006 to October 2007.
Consolmagno is a popular speaker as well as a writer of popular science. He has been a guest of honor at several science fiction conventions, including DucKon in 2000, ConFusion in his native state of Michigan in 2002, Boskone in 2007, ConClave in 2009, MuseCon in 2015, and Minicon and NASFiC in 2017. He was an invited participant in Scifoo in 2008 as well. He taught at Fordham University in New York City for the fall term of 2008. Consolmagno gave the keynote speech at the 2013 Stellafane amateur telescope making convention on Aug 10. 
He appeared on &quot;The Colbert Report&quot; in December 2009 to promote his book, &quot;The Heavens Proclaim&quot;. In May 2014, Consolmagno received an honorary doctorate (Doctor of Humane Letters, &quot;Honoris Causa&quot;) from Georgetown University and spoke at the Georgetown College commencement ceremony. In 2010, he was a guest on &quot;On Being&quot; with Krista Tippett, alongside his friend and colleague Father George Coyne, S.J. In the interview, Consolmagno and Coyne discussed their distinct and intimate relationships with science and faith. The show aired for a second time in 2011, and for a third time in September 2015.

On July 2, 2014, he was awarded the Carl Sagan Medal for outstanding communication by an active planetary scientist to the general public by the Division for Planetary Sciences of the American Astronomical Society.

Known as &quot;The Pope&#x27;s Astronomer,&quot; he was named by Pope Francis to be the Director of the Vatican Observatory in September 2015.

In 2022, Consolmagno was awarded the St. Albert Award by the Society of Catholic Scientists.

Consolmagno additionally has made several appearances on EWTN&#x27;s original programming, most notably featuring prominently in the August 2021 &quot;EWTN Vaticano&quot; special episode &quot;Inside the Vatican Observatory - Where Science Meets Faith.&quot;

<doc id="915045" wikidata="Q1411823" url="?curid=915045" title="Fifty Million Frenchmen">
<text>Fifty Million Frenchmen is a musical comedy with a book by Herbert Fields and music and lyrics by Cole Porter. It opened on Broadway in 1929 and was adapted for a film two years later. The title is a reference to the hit 1927 song &quot;Fifty Million Frenchmen Can&#x27;t Be Wrong&quot; by Willie Raskin, Billy Rose, and Fred Fisher, which compared free attitudes in 1920s Paris with censorship and prohibition in the United States. The musical&#x27;s plot is consistent with the standard boy-meets-girl plots of musical comedies of the first half of the twentieth century.

==History==
&quot;Fifty Million Frenchmen&quot; was the first of seven Porter musicals to have the book written or co-written by Herbert Fields. This was also the first musical directed by Monty Woolley.

==Synopsis== 
Peter Forbes, a young American millionaire, journeys to Paris and bets his friends Billy Baxter and Michael Cummins that he can live without his money for a month and, while doing so, get engaged to Looloo Caroll, a young woman he adores. She is in Paris with her parents and her best friend Joyce. The catch is that Peter has one month, until July 4, to throw their engagement party at the Chateau Madrid. Trying to woo Looloo while penniless, he endures humiliation. His first job is as a tour guide, but much to his dismay, he has caught the eye of Violet Hildegarde, a fur-buyer who sends risqué French postcards to her children (&quot;Where Would You Get Your Coat?&quot;). An aspiring singer, May DeVere, also becomes interested in Peter. Since Peter has no time, Looloo and Billy have begun flirting.

Everyone goes to the racetrack, where Louis Pernasse tells Peter that the race is fixed and Toujours Moi will win, and he takes Peter&#x27;s and May&#x27;s money to place a bet. It appears that the horse has lost and Peter tears up his ticket, but the winner is disqualified and he has won. However, Looloo thinks he is being selfish in not sharing his winnings (since she had lent him some money) and leaves him (&quot;You Don&#x27;t Know Paree&quot;).

In another week, Pernasse is preparing a party for Looloo&#x27;s mother, who plans to match her with a poor but titled Grand Duke (&quot;The Queen of Terre Haute&quot;). Mr. Carroll, distressed at the cost, gets drunk, and Looloo does not attend, as she has no desire to marry the Grand Duke.

On July 4, Peter is a dance-host at the Chateau Madrid. As all arrive, Billy and Michael are still chasing Violet and Joyce. Peter, with the pressure of the time-limit bet, proposes. Just then Pernasse tells him to dance with a customer and Looloo starts to leave, confused and embarrassed. Peter and Pernasse have words about the torn-up ticket and Looloo realizes that he was telling the truth. She trusts him and they become engaged as midnight arrives.

==Productions==
&quot;Fifty Million Frenchmen&quot; premiered on Broadway at the Lyric Theatre on November 27, 1929 and closed on July 5, 1930 after 254 performances. The opening was a month after the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Directed by Monty Woolley with choreography by Larry Ceballos and scenic design by Norman Bel Geddes, the cast featured William Gaxton as Peter Forbes, Genevieve Tobin as Looloo Carroll, Betty Compton as Joyce Wheeler, and Lester Crawford as Billy Baxter.

Medicine Show Theatre Ensemble staged an Off-Off Broadway production Feb. 3-20, 1983. The theatre&#x27;s artistic director Barbara Vann directed. Later to be a famed composer in his own right, Michael-John Lachiusa was the musical director.

A concert version was staged in 1991 with the book adapted by Tommy Krasker and produced by the French Institute/Alliance Francaise in association with Evans Haile at the Mainstage 14th Street Y in New York City. A studio cast recording was made with the cast members of this concert.

In 2002 the &quot;Discovering Lost Musicals Charitable Trust&quot; presented a concert at The Royal Opera House&#x27;s Linbury Studio Theatre in London.

The 42nd Street Moon concert in San Francisco was presented in December 2003.

The APPLAUSE! Musicals Society concert was held February 13–16, 2008 at the Shadbolt Centre for the Arts in Burnaby, British Columbia, directed by Scott Ashton Swan.

Medicine Show Theatre, 549 W. 52nd St. in New York, revived its 1983 production of Fifty Million Frenchmen, again directed by Obie-winner Barbara Vann, Oct. 24-Nov. 18, 2012. Bob Goldstone, pianist for the Broadway production of Evita, was musical director. CurtainUp reviewer Elizabeth Ahlfors called the production, &quot;Pure silliness... Non-stop frivolity.&quot; Will Friedwald of The Wall Street Journal called it a &quot;spirited production of that Cole Porter gem.&quot;

In January 2013, Medicine Show Theatre did seven additional performances of its Oct.-Nov. 2012 production of Fifty Million Frenchmen, with the same cast and crew.

==Critical response==
Stephen Citron, in his book &quot;Noel &amp; Cole&quot;, wrote that the musical received mixed reviews, citing critics Brooks Atkinson and Richard Watts who both deemed it &quot;pleasant&quot;, saying there was not an &quot;outstanding hit song in the show.&quot; Gilbert Gabriel, on the other hand, said it was &quot;the best thing in seven years!&quot; Porter champion Irving Berlin took out an advertisement stating in part: &quot;The best musical comedy I have seen in years...&quot; The show had what was, for the time, a long run.

According to Charles Schwartz, writing in the biography &quot;Cole Porter&quot;, the musical&#x27;s book by Herbert Fields &quot;had a lot to do with capturing the frothy Gallic essence implicit in the title...&quot; and he also noted the &quot;near-perfect cast&quot; and &quot;sure-handed direction&quot; of Monty Woolley.

==Film adaptations==
*&quot;Fifty Million Frenchmen&quot;, directed by Lloyd Bacon and filmed entirely in Technicolor, was released in 1931 by Warner Bros. The cast included Ole Olsen, Chic Johnson, William Gaxton, Helen Broderick, John Halliday, Claudia Dell, Lester Crawford, and Evalyn Knapp. The songs were omitted from the 1931 film, because the public had tired of musicals.
*In 1934, a two-reeler entitled &quot;Paree, Paree&quot; was made from the musical, and this version included several the songs &quot;You Do Something to Me&quot;, &quot;Paree, What Did You Do To Me&quot;, &quot;Find Me a Primitive Man&quot;, and &quot;You&#x27;ve Got That Thing&quot;. The film starred Bob Hope in the William Gaxton role.

<text>ABSD-7, an advanced base sectional dock, was constructed of seven advance base docks (ABD) as follows: ABD-37, ABD-38, ABD-39, and ABD-40 were built by Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron Company, Morgan City, Louisiana, and completed in December 1944 and January and February 1945; ABD-51 and ABD-52 were built by Pollock-Stockton Shipbuilding Company, Stockton, California, and completed in January and March 1945; and ABD-58 was built by Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co., Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and completed in October 1944.

== Mare Island ==
The seven advance base docks were towed to Mare Island Navy Yard where they were erected and assembled into ABSD-7. Completed in March 1945, the advance base section dock began duty at Mare Island, she served there until placed on the inactive list in March 1946. In August 1946 she was reclassified to auxiliary floating drydock AFDB-7. Disassembled and towed to the east coast, she entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Green Cove Springs, Florida in January 1947.

== Holy Loch ==
Early in 1961, four sections—&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, and &quot;D&quot;—of AFDB‑7 were towed across the Atlantic Ocean to Holy Loch, Scotland, where on 3 March 1961 the Navy established an important base for fleet ballistic submarines. A detachment of Seabees from MCB-4 erected and assembled the four sections. Completed 10 November, the auxiliary floating drydock was placed in service as &quot;Los Alamos&quot; (AFDB-7).

Assigned to SUBRON 14, &quot;Los Alamos&quot; began drydock service for the FBM boats.

Converted for use by submarines, she had the following characteristics:
* Displacement: 
* Length: 
* Draft: light, submerged
* Complement: 143
* Armament: none

Late in 1961 she carried out her first SSBN drydocking of . She then served submarines of the &quot;Highland Squadron&quot; at Holy Loch. She supported refit and repair operations by submarine tenders , , , , and . In February 1964 she successfully completed the first &quot;off center&quot; docking of a Polaris submarine. By providing keel blocks preset for two separate classes of SSBN boats, &quot;Los Alamos&quot; &quot;added immeasurably to the site’s repair flexibility.&quot;

On 18 June 1966, section &quot;F&quot; was turned over to the U.S. Army, where it was converted into a floating power plant at Kwajalein named &quot;Andrew J Weber&quot; (BD-6235). On 1 October 1977, &quot;Andrew J Weber&quot; was returned to the U.S. Navy and reinstated on the Naval Vessel Register as YFP-14. Stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 29 May 1991, YFP-14 remained at Guam and was designated to be used in a Sinkex on 18 June 1998. YFP-14 was sunk southeast of Agana, Guam on 19 July 2001. The Naval Vessel Register&#x27;s entry for YFP-14 incorrectly indicates the vessel was sunk on 18 June 1998, that was the date the vessel was designated to be sunk.

On 5 December 1994 &quot;Los Alamos&quot; was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register. It was disassembled into sections and returned to the United States, the remaining six original ABSD-7 sections (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot;, &quot;E&quot; and &quot;G&quot;) were transferred to the Brownsville Navigation District, Texas on 11 August 1995. It is currently in use as &quot;Solomon Ortiz Dry Dock&quot; at Keppel AmFELS Shipyard, Brownsville, Texas.

<doc id="915053" wikidata="Q751777" url="?curid=915053" title="Chuck (Sum 41 album)">
<text>Chuck is the third studio album by Canadian rock band Sum 41. The album was released on October 12, 2004. It was the last album to feature guitarist Dave Baksh before his departure from Sum 41 on May 11, 2006. Baksh later rejoined the band in 2015. &quot;Chuck&quot; peaked at No. 2 on the Canadian Albums Chart and No. 10 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it the band&#x27;s highest-charting album until it would be surpassed by &quot;Underclass Hero&quot; in 2007.

The album&#x27;s title is named after a volunteer UN peacekeeper named Chuck Pelletier who was in the Democratic Republic of the Congo where Sum 41 was filming a documentary for War Child Canada. Fighting broke out during production, and Pelletier helped the band evacuate their hotel during the fighting, as he was staying at the same hotel.

The album&#x27;s lyrical content has been described as darker and more mature than the band&#x27;s previous work. It also had a different sound, mixing punk rock and melodic hardcore with heavy metal. The album proved to be a success, receiving acclaim from both critics and fans, as well as selling over five million copies. Singles such as &quot;We&#x27;re All to Blame&quot; and &quot;Pieces&quot; gained success on the Canadian and American charts, and the album won a Juno Award for &quot;Rock Album of the Year&quot; in 2005.

==Background==

The band&#x27;s previous album &quot;Does This Look Infected?&quot; (2002) became a commercial and critical success, and the band went on a tour in the album&#x27;s support. In mid-2004, the band took a break from touring and filmed a documentary for War Child Canada in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The film was called &quot;&quot; and was released in 2005 by MTV. However, fighting broke out during the filming while the band was staying in a hotel.

&quot;The shooting was all around us, and all these people were waiting, probably to die,&quot; said drummer Steve Jocz, reflecting on the experience. &quot;Two UN people arrived at the scene and gave a speech about how everything would be fine,&quot; bassist Jason &quot;Cone&quot; McCaslin mentioned. &quot;And then after they left, things just went crazy.&quot;

Vocalist/rhythm guitarist Deryck Whibley mentioned that he thought that a day after the UN gave an update about safety, he was expecting they would be able to evacuate. The next day, the band members woke up at 5:00 in the morning when two gunshots were fired. &quot;We went to the hotel&#x27;s restaurant to get some breakfast, when the gunfire just got closer to us,&quot; said lead guitarist Dave &quot;Brownsound&quot; Baksh. A U.N. peacekeeper named Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Pelletier instructed the residents of the hotel to leave the restaurant. Whibley recalled, &quot;We all just went into Cone&#x27;s room, where there was around 43 other people there. We were all hiding in the bathroom and hiding on the floor.&quot; Baksh added, &quot;Our U.N. peacekeeper was armed with a club, a new club because the price tag was still on it, but they were armed with guns&quot;.

Pelletier continued to reassure the band and others at the hotel that everything would be okay. After the crowd was in hiding, Pelletier left to get help. The U.N. continued trying to find out as much information on the gunfire as possible, but updates were few. &quot;After a while, the gunfire seemed to start dying down, and then people started to go outside and they started talking. We seemed to be feeling pretty good, but then out of nowhere, the huge gunfire just went off,&quot; stated Whibley. &quot;This war was so unpredictable. At one point, it sounded like it was far away, and at another point, it sounded like it was right outside the door. Then Chuck came in and told everyone to wait for the APC&#x27;s to arrive. That was probably the scariest part, when we were waiting to get into the APC&#x27;s.&quot; Baksh recalled, &quot;I remember just waiting there and just wondering what the fuck was gonna happen.&quot;

Pelletier called for armored carriers to take the hotel&#x27;s occupants out of the hot zone. &quot;By then, I just kept thinking about everything we did as a band and everything I&#x27;ve done as a person, and I thought, &#x27;This is it. This is how we&#x27;re gonna die,&#x27;&quot; Whibley said. After nearly six hours, the carriers arrived, and the band and the forty other civilians were taken to safety. In honor of Pelletier, the band decided to name their next album after him. Pelletier was awarded the Medal of Bravery by the Governor General of Canada for his actions.

==Recording==
By spring of 2003, the band members began practicing parts for a new album on their own before going into a studio. &quot;The music&#x27;s better, the songwriting&#x27;s better, and there&#x27;s more musical elements in this album,&quot; Jocz stated. &quot;We put more elements in this time around, and it feels like the next logical step in what we want our band to sound like&quot;.

&quot;We never wanted to make the same album over and over again. We&#x27;ve decided we wanted to do something different every time,&quot; said McCaslin. &quot;We started practicing on our own, and then we just put all of our parts together.&quot; The album was also mentioned to having a lot of heavy metal influences on it, with Metallica and Iron Maiden being main inspirations for the album&#x27;s style. &quot;Dave was raised on a lot of heavy metal and grunge,&quot; McCaslin noted. &quot;Deryck and I were raised more on California punk rock music,&quot; said Jocz. &quot;When we started the band, we were mainly inspired by bands such as NOFX and Pennywise, but when you get older, your brain starts branching off and you start listening to other music.&quot;

==Composition==

===Music and style===

&quot;Chuck&quot; has been described under many genres, including alternative metal, punk metal, skate punk, melodic hardcore, heavy metal, thrash metal, and punk rock, merging elements of hardcore punk with heavy metal. Apple Music described &quot;Chuck&quot; as a blend of melodic hardcore with heavy metal influences. The album makes use of a number of different styles across its run time. Specifically, &quot;The Bitter End&quot; is thrash metal and &quot;Welcome to Hell&quot; is hardcore punk, while the fifth and eleventh tracks, &quot;Some Say&quot; and &quot;Pieces&quot; respectively, are alternative rock songs.

On the sound of the album, the band have cited Metallica and Refused as major influences. Michael Endelman of Entertainment Weekly described it as &quot;a meeting of two worlds — extreme metal and pop-savvy punk — that rarely pass each other in the halls, let alone hang out after school.&quot; Dave Simpson at &quot;The Guardian&quot; stated &quot;The spiky quartet furnish their usual shouty vocals with grinding riffola and twiddly guitar solos, just as the rest of the post-Linkin Park world are realizing nu metal wasn&#x27;t such a good idea.&quot; Alan di Perna of &quot;Guitar World&quot; called it &quot;their heaviest album yet&quot;, and as going from &quot;flirt[ing] with metal on both [prior] albums, but with Chuck they’ve fully embraced it.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; writer Ethan Stewart described the album&#x27;s sound as &quot;primarily defined by a merger of heavily Metallica-indebted thrash with the kinds of alternative metal closest to System of a Down or Breaking Benjamin depending on the song... [it] is also structurally reminiscent of the melodic hardcore albums from the same period, namely No Warning’s &quot;Suffer, Survive&quot; and Rise Against&#x27;s &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot;.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Chuck&quot; was a commercial success, selling over 5,000,000 copies worldwide. The album won a Juno Award in 2005 for &quot;Best Rock Album of the Year&quot;. The album was certified gold in Japan, double platinum in Canada and gold in the United States.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Chuck&quot; received positive reviews, with Metacritic giving the album an aggregated score of 63 out of 100 based on 11 reviews. Allmusic gave the album a positive review, saying &quot;&quot;Chuck&quot; is a concise album that clocks in at just over a half-hour, with a basic understanding that fast and loud is what the band does best.&quot; Entertainment Weekly said that &quot;It may sound heinous on paper, but trust us, the first single, &quot;We&#x27;re All to Blame,&quot; is far better than it has a right to be.&quot; E! Online said that &quot;But whether they&#x27;re being snotty or serious, there is a constant thread at work: those catchy melodies.&quot; Music OMH said that &quot;Chuck&quot; &quot;isn&#x27;t perfect&quot; but also added that &quot;Sum 41 have certainly added a heck of a lot more colour to their previously, partially monochrome musical output.&quot; Lane Devis of 411mania.com compared the album to Blink-182&#x27;s 2003 self-titled album, Green Day&#x27;s &quot;American Idiot&quot;, and Good Charlotte&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Life and Death&quot;, saying &quot;The lyrics are serious in this album are far cries from the immature lyrics and antics that have become almost trademark for Sum 41.&quot; Common Sense Media gave it four stars out of five, saying &quot;Rugged intensity makes up for the diminished playfulness. Lyrics are clean but somber. You don&#x27;t like your life, politics, or the world we live in? You might not be able to do much about it, but perhaps – following the example of Sum 41 – you can write some interesting, lyrical songs about the stuff that drives you crazy&quot;, and also called it &quot;socially conscious punk rock&quot;.

Decoy Music said &quot;for the most part, it&#x27;s obvious the band has grown up. There are some slower songs and some acoustic guitars and some ballads and all that good stuff. But the band still rocks hard 95% of the time and the fact they&#x27;ve gotten heavier actually accentuates their poppyness better than the punk aspect. The songs are still fast and guitar-driven, the drums are still extremely random and manic and awesome—all in all, this is still a Sum 41 record. But it&#x27;s just a better one.&quot; Stuart Green of exclaim.ca said &quot;Musically the band has never sounded more determined or cohesive (the notable exceptions being the Oasis sound-alike &quot;Some Say&quot; and the power mellower &quot;Slipping Away&quot; and &quot;Pieces&quot;). Lyrically the album also advances the case for these guys as strong songwriters.&quot; Diamond in the Rock said &quot;Although some hail Chuck as a complete departure from the band&#x27;s enjoyable punk style, this album adds diversity to Sum 41&#x27;s discography as the hardcore rock vibes lend to an engaging, albeit satisfactorily brief, sound.&quot; However, not all reviews were positive. Punknews.org was somewhat disappointed with the album, saying &quot;No one can deny the band&#x27;s musical talent, and the more serious lyrical themes are a definite improvement, but the lack of consistency kills this album. The highlight of Sum 41&#x27;s discography is going to come when they fully embrace their metal influences and make a straight-up metal album, and sadly Chuck misses the mark&quot;, but also added &quot;If you are still under the impression that Sum 41 is a joke band or a Beastie Boys-wannabe, give some of these songs a try, and you may be pleasantly surprised.&quot; Robert Christgau assigned the album a &quot;dud&quot; rating.

<doc id="915058" wikidata="Q23304038" url="?curid=915058" title="Lefebvre">
<text>Lefebvre (; commonly in English-speaking countries, as well as or ) is a common northern French surname. Alternative forms include &quot;Lefebvre&quot;, &quot;le Febvre&quot;, &quot;Le Febvre&quot;, &quot;Lefèbvre&quot;, &quot;le Fèbvre&quot;, &quot;Le Fèbvre&quot;, as well as the common variant Lefèvre (&quot;le Fèvre&quot;, &quot;Le Fèvre&quot;; anglicized &quot;Lefevre&quot;, &quot;le Fevre&quot;, &quot;Le Fevre&quot;, &quot;LeFevre&quot;, &quot;LeFever&quot;). Dialectal variants include Lefevere (Belgium), Lefebre, Lefeuvre (western France), and Lefébure (northern France and Normandy).

The name derives from &quot;faber&quot;, the Latin word for &quot;craftsman&quot;, &quot;worker&quot;; used in Late Latin in Gaul to mean smith. In the Occitan and Arpitan extension area, the variation is &quot;Fabre&quot;, &quot;Favre&quot;, &quot;Faure&quot;, &quot;Favret&quot;, &quot;Favrette&quot; or &quot;Dufaure&quot; and in Corsica &quot;Fabri&quot; (cf. Italian &quot;Fabbri&quot;, &quot;Fabri&quot;). In Celtic-speaking Brittany, the corresponding name is &quot;Le Goff(ic)&quot;, with the article &quot;le&quot; to translate Breton &quot;ar&quot;. Many northern French surnames (especially in Normandy) are used with the definite masculine article as a prefix (Lefebvre, Lefèvre; a more archaic spelling is &quot;Le Febvre&quot;), with the contracted masculine article as a prefix (&quot;Dufaure&quot;) in the south of France, or without article/prefix (&quot;Favre&quot;, &quot;Faure&quot;) in the south of France, but the meaning is the same.

For Anglophone purposes, the name has evolved, especially in the United States and Anglophone regions of Canada—mainly by Acadians, among whom it is also a common surname, yielding not only Lefevre and LeFever, but also &quot;Lafevre&quot;, &quot;Lafever&quot;, &quot;Lefavre&quot;, &quot;LeFave&quot;, &quot;LaFave&quot;, as well as other variant spellings. The English surname &quot;Feaver&quot; is also derived from Lefebvre.

<text>Ozzy &amp; Drix is an American animated television series based on the 2001 film &quot;Osmosis Jones&quot;. It centers on Osmosis &quot;Ozzy&quot; Jones, a cheeky-chappy white blood cell, and Drix, a level-headed cold pill, who battle germs and viruses inside the body of teenage boy Hector Cruz. The series is set in a stylized version of the human body, which resembles a city where microorganisms and cells are anthropomorphic.

Produced by Conundrum Entertainment and Warner Bros. Animation, the series aired on Kids&#x27; WB for two seasons and 26 episodes from 2002 to 2004. It also aired on Cartoon Network from 2003 to 2006.

==Premise==

At the beginning of the series, Osmosis &quot;Ozzy&quot; Jones (voiced by Phil LaMarr impersonating Chris Rock from the film), a white blood cell with an impulsive personality and a penchant for challenging authority, and Drix (voiced by Jeff Bennett impersonating David Hyde Pierce in the same film), a straight-laced and by-the-books cold pill, pursue a scarlet fever bacterium (voiced by Tim Curry). During the chase, the three get sucked up by a mosquito from their host body Frank DeTorre (voiced by Jeff Bennett) and are transported to the body of a teenage boy named Hector Cruz (voiced by Justin Cowden). After defeating the bacterium and settling into their new home, Ozzy and Drix are hired as private investigators, vowing to protect Hector&#x27;s health and guide him through the misadventures of adolescence.

Supporting characters include Maria Amino (voiced by Tasia Valenza), a white blood cell cop who is highly skilled at fighting and also becomes a love interest for Drix; Mayor Paul Spryman (voiced by Alanna Ubach), the immature teenage mayor of the city of Hector; Chief Gluteus (voiced by Jim Cummings), a stern muscle cell who serves as the city&#x27;s police chief and Maria&#x27;s superior; Ellen Patella (voiced by Vivica A. Fox), an attorney at law who helps cells find homes in Hector, and who becomes Ozzy&#x27;s new love interest to replace Leah Estrogen after forever leaving her and Frank; and the Brain Cell Advisors (voiced by Pat Fraley), advisors who help Mayor Spryman run the city due to Spryman being incompetent in his job.

Recurring characters include The Mole (voiced by Jeffrey Tambor), a former secret agent who holds information on what is happening within Hector; Dander (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker), Drix&#x27;s pet dog germ formed from the saliva of Hector&#x27;s dog Uno; Christine Kolchuck (voiced by Kimberly Brooks), a friendly student who Hector has a crush on and looks out for Hector; Travis Lum (voiced by Rob Paulsen), Hector&#x27;s classmate and best friend who also looks out for him; Ernst Strepfinger (voiced by Brad Garrett in season 1, Jim Cummings in season 2), a villainous germ who uses a gang of germs and viruses to carry out his dirty work; Uno (vocal effects provided by Frank Welker), Hector&#x27;s dog whom he adopted in &quot;Oh, My Dog&quot;; and Hector&#x27;s supportive parents, Mr. and Mrs. Cruz (voiced by Alanna Ubach and Joe Lala) who look after Hector&#x27;s well-being.

==Production==
Unlike the original film it was spun-off from, &quot;Ozzy &amp; Drix&quot; was entirely animated and contained no live-action scenes while being considered in its own continuity as this version of Frank DeTorre is still in bad shape. The series was also less intense and contained little adult humor compared to the film. The voices of Ozzy and Drix were recast with LaMarr replacing Chris Rock as Ozzy and Bennett replacing David Hyde Pierce as Drix. In multiple episodes, producer Ron Myrick integrated stock footage from the original film such as the human body&#x27;s traffic, the inside of the mouth, and the dam bursting in the runny nose.

Ozzy, Drix, and Frank DeTorre are the only characters from the original film to return. Major characters from it such as Leah Estrogen, ex-mayor Phlegmming, the Chief of Police, Tom Colonic and well as human characters such as Shane, Bob and Mrs. Boyd are completely absent nor are they mentioned.

<text>Beverley &quot;Bev&quot; Francis (born 15 February 1955) is an Australian gym owner and retired professional bodybuilder, powerlifter, and national shot put champion.

==Early life==
Beverley Francis was born on 15 February 1955 in Geelong, Victoria, the youngest of five children. As a child she dreamed of playing football. In 1976, she graduated from the University of Melbourne, where she obtained a degree in physical education and a teaching diploma. She then worked as a high school physical education and mathematics teacher for eight years.

==Career==
===Shot put===
As a teenager, Francis became an accomplished shot putter. In February 1974, she began serious training. In 1977, she broke the Australian shot put record. From 1977 to 1979 and 1981 to 1982, she was an Australian track and field team member. She missed the 1980 track season due to a knee injury. In 1982, she won the Australian national shot put championships. Along with shot put, she performed the discus throw, javelin throw, and 100 meter reserve.

===Powerlifting===
In 1980, Francis held all world records in the weight class. At the 1981 World Powerlifting Championships, she set a world record when she bench pressed , the first woman&#x27;s bench press over 300 lb. At the 1982 Australian Powerlifting Championships in Adelaide, she set a world record in the class with a squat of . She won gold medals in her weight class in the International Powerlifting Federation Championships from 1980 to 1985.

===Bodybuilding===
====Professional career====
After becoming the first woman to bench press over , a picture of Francis striking a most muscular pose, or &quot;the crab&quot;, while wearing a bikini appeared in several bodybuilding magazines around the world. She possessed far more muscular size than the most muscular female bodybuilders at the time. Her powerlifting accolade led to her being invited by producer George Butler to take part in the film &quot;Pumping Iron II: The Women&quot;, which was being shot around the Cesar&#x27;s World Cup being held in Las Vegas in December 1983. At that contest, she said she should have been &quot;first or last&quot;. She placed in the middle as 8th among 15 competitors. Disappointed with the results, she attempted to reinvent her physique along the lines of what was being rewarded, especially after hearing that she was &quot;too muscular&quot; for the judges&#x27; tastes.

Francis guest-posed at the 1985 Mr. Olympia competition, igniting the audience. She finished 10th in her Ms. Olympia debut in 1986. In 1987, she won the World Pro Championships. She followed up with three 3rd-place finishes at the Ms. Olympia in 1987, 1988, and 1989, then moved into 2nd place at the Ms. Olympia in 1990 (as runner-up to Lenda Murray). She had overhauled her physique radically from that 1983 Cesar&#x27;s World Cup, when she was told she was &quot;too muscular&quot;, but at the 1990 Olympia she was told she was &quot;not muscular enough&quot; to top Murray. Determined to win their next meeting, she resolved to build the most densely muscled physique ever seen on a female up to that point.

====Ms. Olympia 1991====
The 1991 Ms. Olympia contest was the first to be televised live by ESPN, broadcasting a women&#x27;s bodybuilding contest to the largest audience ever at the time (and contributing to the ensuing controversy). To facilitate the network&#x27;s needs, the competition was held over two days. Rounds one (symmetry) and two (muscularity) were held on Saturday evening, 12 October 1991, whilst rounds three (posing) and four (posedown) were conducted 24 hours later, with the Sunday night proceedings broadcast live. At the prejudging, Francis walked out with of dense and conditioned muscles stacked on her frame. The audience gasped—none had seen such musculature on a woman before. Almost all the competitors came in considerably larger than at the last competition, surprising not just the mainstream ESPN viewers, but some bodybuilding fans as well. The defending champion Murray was herself 11 lb heavier than the previous year.

At the end of the first night&#x27;s judging, Francis led the field, four points ahead of Murray. On the second night, just before the start of the final two rounds, ESPN (in an unprecedented move for professional bodybuilding) flashed up the half-time scores for their national audience and those inside the Shrine Auditorium to see Francis in the lead. Since the posing rounds had never been recognised as opportunities for a lagging competitor to come from behind, most insiders, including Francis herself, predicted that she only had to avoid falling over to take the title. However, at the conclusion of the second night&#x27;s events, as Francis stood onstage holding hands with Murray, she was announced in 2nd place, with a score of 31 points to Murray&#x27;s 32. Francis&#x27;s hand rose halfway to her face in shock before she regained her composure, smiled, and congratulated Murray. This was the slimmest margin of victory yet for a Ms. Olympia win, with Murray edging Francis by only one point. The audience and commentators were thrown off by this result, since Francis was in the lead after the first two (more contentious) rounds, only to be overtaken somehow in the concluding set.

It was usually suggested that the IFBB and ESPN leadership did not want a woman carrying more muscle mass than most middleweight men to be recognised as the planet&#x27;s premier female bodybuilder, and instructed the judges to swing the contest in Murray&#x27;s favor. Such interference was not unheard of in the male competition (most controversially at the 1980 Mr. Olympia). A few months later, the IFBB issued a new policy announcement warning that excessive overt muscularity would be marked down, sparking persistent debate over the subjective criteria and &quot;how much is too much&quot;. Francis retired afterwards, citing disgust over her controversial loss. She stated in 1993:

====Body image and judging criteria====
Francis and her career played a significant role in the concurrent turmoil over ideals of form (especially regarding muscle mass) and judging criteria for female bodybuilders, which often relied on vague, contentious, and shifting notions of a &quot;feminine&quot; figure. Her 1983 debut in the made-for-film Cesar&#x27;s World Cup received much attention for potentially pushing the sport in a more muscular direction. Feminist icon Gloria Steinem commented that her performance &quot;redefined the boundaries of femininity&quot;. However, when she placed 8th, her loss led her to spend years changing her look in an attempt to meet the apparent ideal preferred by the judges.

Despite years of attempting to achieve higher scores on the femininity aspect of the contests with measures including a nose job, hair bleaching, and slimming down her physique by losing muscle, Francis still failed to take first place at the major competitions. However, after successfully developing methods of achieving a more symmetrical physique while maintaining the size built from her powerlifting background (the three power lifts are central to bodybuilding, and bodybuilders with backgrounds as champion powerlifters tend to have tremendous size and density for their frames), she won the World Championship in 1987. She continued to experiment with her physique, leading to a disappointing 1990 Ms. Olympia. There, she was criticised as not having the fullness or muscularity compared to winner Lenda Murray, and subsequently worked on becoming as massive and symmetrical as possible for the 1991 Olympia. After the ensuing 2nd-place finish and resulting controversy, she retired from bodybuilding.

Marcia Pally, in a 1985 article on the film &quot;Pumping Iron II: The Women&quot;, had reported that people often thought of Francis as lesbian. Francis commented: &quot;The categorization annoys me more than what I&#x27;m accused of. I&#x27;ve been called a transsexual, a man, and a lesbian. People have to stop putting together things that don&#x27;t belong together. Muscles don&#x27;t make a woman a lesbian.&quot;

==Other work==
Francis is the co-author of the book &quot;Bev Francis&#x27; Power Bodybuilding&quot;. She has also produced a training video titled &quot;Hardcore Training with World Champion Bev Francis&quot;. She has contributed articles to the monthly &quot;Female Bodybuilding&quot; magazine and has written for the men&#x27;s magazines &quot;Flex&quot;, &quot;Iron Man&quot;, and &quot;Muscle &amp; Fitness&quot;.

In 1985, Francis gained notice through her role in the movie &quot;Pumping Iron II: The Women&quot;. The movie featured her in the 1983 Caesars World Cup. The film casts her in a controversial role within the ongoing debate over femininity and female muscularity, with her naturally massive size and muscular development challenging preconceived notions about the limits of female bodybuilding.

Francis was featured in the 2001 TLC documentary &quot;The Greatest Bodies&quot;.

==Personal life==
At the 1983 Caesars World Cup, Francis met IFBB judge and powerlifter Steve Weinberger. She moved in with him on Long Island, New York and they were married on 30 September 1984. They have a son and daughter together. In 1986, she and her husband opened Bev Francis&#x27; Bodybuilding Gym on Long Island. In 1990, they expanded the gym to Bev Francis Gold&#x27;s Gym in Syosset, New York. In 2005, the gym&#x27;s name was changed to Powerhouse Gym, Bev Francis. She and her husband lived in Syosset prior to their divorce. Bev is now back in Australia living in Geelong with her female partner Lee Johnson.

==Legacy==
From 1981 to the early 1990s, Francis earned the accolade of &quot;Strongest Woman in History&quot;. She was the first woman in the world to bench press over . She broke over 40 world powerlifting records and was undefeated during her powerlifting career. She was inducted into the International Powerlifting Federation Hall of Fame in 1987.

Francis was inducted into the IFBB Hall of Fame in 2000. She is also a judge for the International Federation of BodyBuilders (IFBB).

<text>Hanson Records is an American independent record label founded in Brighton, Michigan and now based in Oberlin, Ohio. It is operated by the musician Aaron Dilloway, formerly of the band Wolf Eyes.

==History==

The label&#x27;s first release was a 7-inch extended play (EP) by Dilloway&#x27;s band Galen, in 1994. Eventually moving from Brighton, Michigan to Ann Arbor, Michigan, in 1997 it released the first Wolf Eyes recording, a self-titled cassette. It has since released various other Wolf Eyes recordings as well as albums by Kevin Drumm, Smegma, Hive Mind, Nautical Almanac, Andrew Wilkes-Krier, Hair Police and, following a move to its current base in Oberlin, Ohio, Emeralds and Skin Graft. While releasing music on a variety of formats, including CD-R and LP, the majority of its releases are on cassette, and as such the label is often associated with cassette culture. Recordings for Hanson have low production costs and use low fidelity recording techniques, including recording live straight to cassette.

<doc id="915079" wikidata="Q13948128" url="?curid=915079" title="London Regiment (1908–1938)">
<text>The London Regiment was an infantry regiment in the British Army, part of the Territorial Force (renamed the Territorial Army in 1921). The regiment saw service in the First World War and was disbanded in 1938, shortly before the Second World War, when most of its battalions were converted to other roles or transferred elsewhere, and reformed in 1993. The London Guards date their formation to that of this regiment in 1908.

==History==
===1908===


The regiment was first formed in 1908 to regiment the 26 Volunteer Force battalions in the newly formed County of London, each battalion having a distinctive uniform. The London battalions formed the London District, which consisted principally of the 1st and 2nd London Divisions.

===First World War===
Now part of the Territorial Force, the London Regiment expanded to 88 battalions in the First World War. Of these, 49 battalions saw action in the trenches of the Western Front in France and Flanders, six saw action in the Gallipoli campaign, 12 saw action at Salonika, 14 saw action against the Turks in Palestine, and one saw action in Waziristan and Afghanistan.

Shortly after the outbreak of the First World War, the formation of Reserve or 2nd-Line units for each existing Territorial Force unit was authorised. They were distinguished by a &#x27;2/&#x27; prefix from their parent unit (prefixed &#x27;1/&#x27;). Initially these were formed from men who had not volunteered for overseas service, and the recruits who were flooding in. Later they were mobilised for overseas service in their own right and new 3rd Line units were created to supply drafts to the two service battalions. Unusually, the 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th London Battalions each sent three battalions overseas and formed 4th Line reserve units. Thus the 26 pre-war battalions of the London regiment became 82 battalions.

In June 1915, men of Territorial Force units who had only volunteered for Home service were formed into composite Provisional Battalions for coast defence. In 1916 the Military Service Act swept away the Home/Overseas service distinction and the provisional battalions took on the dual role of home defence and physical conditioning to render men fit for drafting overseas. For example, the 100th Provisional Battalion was formed from Home Service men of 173rd (3/1st London) Brigade (3/1st, 3/2nd, 3/3rd and 3/4th Bns London Regiment). 104th and 105th Provisional Battalions were assigned to the Honourable Artillery Company (which was nominally a battalion of the London Regiment but never accepted that identity), whilst 100th–103rd and 106th–108th Provisional Battalions were assigned to the London Regiment in general.

===Post-war===
The London Regiment was reformed in the Territorial Army in the 1920s and its individual battalions were granted battle honours in 1924. However, the regiment ceased to exist in 1938 and the battalions were all transferred to regular infantry regiments, the Royal Artillery or the Royal Engineers. For example, 5th Battalion became 1st Battalion, London Rifle Brigade, The Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort&#x27;s Own).

The London Regiment was reformed in 1993 through the re-regimentation of some of the remaining successors of the original regiment (not including, for example, the Artists Rifles or Kensington Regiment (Princess Louise&#x27;s)), which were part of a number of different TA infantry units: In 2021, under the &quot;Future Soldier&quot; it was announced that the London Regiment would be re-designated as 1st Battalion London Guards by February 2024.

<doc id="915081" wikidata="Q837512" url="?curid=915081" title="Differential diagnosis">
<text>In healthcare, a differential diagnosis (DDx) is a method of analysis that distinguishes a particular disease or condition from others that present with similar clinical features. Differential diagnostic procedures are used by clinicians to diagnose the specific disease in a patient, or, at least, to consider any imminently life-threatening conditions. Often, each individual option of a possible disease is called a differential diagnosis (e.g., acute bronchitis could be a differential diagnosis in the evaluation of a cough, even if the final diagnosis is common cold).

More generally, a differential diagnostic procedure is a systematic diagnostic method used to identify the presence of a disease entity where multiple alternatives are possible. This method may employ algorithms, akin to the process of elimination, or at least a process of obtaining information that decreases the &quot;probabilities&quot; of candidate conditions to negligible levels, by using evidence such as symptoms, patient history, and medical knowledge to adjust epistemic confidences in the mind of the diagnostician (or, for computerized or computer-assisted diagnosis, the software of the system).

Differential diagnosis can be regarded as implementing aspects of the hypothetico-deductive method, in the sense that the potential presence of candidate diseases or conditions can be viewed as hypotheses that clinicians further determine as being true or false.

A differential diagnosis is also commonly used within the field of psychiatry/psychology, where two different diagnoses can be attached to a patient who is exhibiting symptoms that could fit into either diagnosis. For example, a patient who has been diagnosed with bipolar disorder may also be given a differential diagnosis of borderline personality disorder, given the similarity in the symptoms of both conditions.

Strategies used in preparing a differential diagnosis list vary with the experience of the healthcare provider. While novice providers may work systemically to assess all possible explanations for a patient&#x27;s concerns, those with more experience often draw on clinical experience and pattern recognition to protect the patient from delays, risks, and cost of inefficient strategies or tests. Effective providers utilize an evidence-based approach, complementing their clinical experience with knowledge from clinical research.

==General components==

A differential diagnosis has four general steps. The clinician will:
# Gather relevant information about the patient and create a symptoms list.
# List possible causes (candidate conditions) for the symptoms. The list need not be in writing.
# Prioritize the list by balancing the risks of a diagnosis with the probability. These are subjective, not objective parameters.
# Perform tests to determine the actual diagnosis. This is known by the colloquial phrase &quot;to Rule Out&quot;. Even after the process, the diagnosis is not clear. The clinician again considers the risks and may treat them empirically, often called &quot;Educated Best Guess.&quot;

A mnemonic to help in considering multiple possible pathological processes is VINDICATEM:
* ascular
* nflammatory / nfectious
* eoplastic
* egenerative /  / rugs
* diopathic / ntoxication / atrogenic
* ongenital
* utoimmune / llergic / natomic
* raumatic
* ndocrine / nvironmental
* etabolic

==Specific methods==
There are several methods for differential diagnostic procedures and several variants among those. Furthermore, a differential diagnostic procedure can be used concomitantly or alternately with protocols, guidelines, or other diagnostic procedures (such as pattern recognition or using medical algorithms).

For example, in case of medical emergency, there may not be enough time to do any detailed calculations or estimations of different probabilities, in which case the ABC protocol (airway, breathing and circulation) may be more appropriate. Later, when the situation is less acute, a more comprehensive differential diagnostic procedure may be adopted.

The differential diagnostic procedure may be simplified if a &quot;pathognomonic&quot; sign or symptom is found (in which case it is almost certain that the target condition is present) or in the absence of a sine qua non sign or symptom (in which case it is almost certain that the target condition is absent).

A diagnostician can be selective, considering first those disorders that are more likely (a probabilistic approach), more serious if left undiagnosed and untreated (a prognostic approach), or more responsive to treatment if offered (a pragmatic approach). Since the subjective probability of the presence of a condition is never exactly 100% or 0%, the differential diagnostic procedure may aim at specifying these various probabilities to form indications for further action.

The following are two methods of differential diagnosis, being based on epidemiology and likelihood ratios, respectively.

===Epidemiology-based method===
One method of performing a differential diagnosis by epidemiology aims to estimate the probability of each candidate condition by comparing their probabilities to have occurred in the first place in the individual. It is based on probabilities related both to the presentation (such as pain) and probabilities of the various candidate conditions (such as diseases).

====Theory====
The statistical basis for differential diagnosis is Bayes&#x27; theorem. As an analogy, when a die has landed the outcome is certain by 100%, but the probability that it Would Have Occurred in the First Place (hereafter abbreviated WHOIFP) is still 1/6. In the same way, the probability that a presentation or condition would have occurred in the first place in an individual (WHOIFPI) is not same as the probability that the presentation or condition &quot;has&quot; occurred in the individual, because the presentation &quot;has&quot; occurred by 100% certainty in the individual. Yet, the contributive probability fractions of each condition are assumed the same, relatively:

: formula_1

where:
* Pr(Presentation is caused by condition in individual) is the probability that the presentation is caused by condition in the individual; &quot;condition&quot; without further specification refers to any candidate condition
* Pr(Presentation has occurred in individual) is the probability that the presentation has occurred in the individual, which can be perceived and thereby set at 100%
* Pr(Presentation WHOIFPI by condition) is the probability that the presentation Would Have Occurred in the First Place in the Individual by condition
* Pr(Presentation WHOIFPI) is the probability that the presentation Would Have Occurred in the First Place in the Individual

When an individual presents with a symptom or sign, Pr(Presentation has occurred in individual) is 100% and can therefore be replaced by 1, and can be ignored since division by 1 does not make any difference:

: formula_2

The total probability of the presentation to have occurred in the individual can be approximated as the sum of the individual candidate conditions:

: formula_3

Also, the probability of the presentation to have been caused by any candidate condition is proportional to the probability of the condition, depending on what rate it causes the presentation:

: formula_4

where:
* Pr(Presentation WHOIFPI by condition) is the probability that the presentation Would Have Occurred in the First Place in the Individual by condition
* Pr(Condition WHOIFPI) is the probability that the condition Would Have Occurred in the First Place in the Individual
* &quot;r&quot;Condition → presentation is the rate at which a condition causes the presentation, that is, the fraction of people with conditions that manifests with the presentation.

The probability that a condition would have occurred in the first place in an individual is approximately equal to that of a population that is as similar to the individual as possible except for the current presentation, compensated where possible by relative risks given by known risk factor that distinguish the individual from the population:

: formula_5

where:
* Pr(Condition WHOIFPI) is the probability that the condition Would Have Occurred in the First Place in the Individual
* &quot;RR&quot;condition is the relative risk for condition conferred by known risk factors in the individual that are not present in the population
* Pr(Condition in population) is the probability that the condition occurs in a population that is as similar to the individual as possible except for the presentation

The following table demonstrates how these relations can be made for a series of candidate conditions:

One additional &quot;candidate condition&quot; is the instance of there being no abnormality, and the presentation is only a (usually relatively unlikely) appearance of a basically normal state. Its probability in the population (&quot;P(No abnormality in population)&quot;) is complementary to the sum of probabilities of &quot;abnormal&quot; candidate conditions.

====Example====
This example case demonstrates how this method is applied but does not represent a guideline for handling similar real-world cases. Also, the example uses relatively specified numbers with sometimes several decimals, while in reality, there are often simply rough estimations, such as of likelihoods being very high&quot;, &quot;high&quot;, &quot;low&quot; or &quot;very low, but still using the general principles of the method.

For an individual (who becomes the &quot;patient&quot; in this example), a blood test of, for example, serum calcium shows a result above the standard reference range, which, by most definitions, classifies as hypercalcemia, which becomes the &quot;presentation&quot; in this case. A clinician (who becomes the &quot;diagnostician&quot; in this example), who does not currently see the patient, gets to know about his finding.

By practical reasons, the clinician considers that there is enough test indication to have a look at the patient&#x27;s medical records. For simplicity, let&#x27;s say that the only information given in the medical records is a family history of primary hyperparathyroidism (here abbreviated as PH), which may explain the finding of hypercalcemia. For this patient, let&#x27;s say that the resultant hereditary risk factor is estimated to confer a relative risk of 10 (RRPH = 10).

The clinician considers that there is enough motivation to perform a differential diagnostic procedure for the finding of hypercalcemia. The main causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) and cancer, so for simplicity, the list of candidate conditions that the clinician could think of can be given as:
* Primary hyperparathyroidism (PH)
* Cancer
* Other diseases that the clinician could think of (which is simply termed &quot;other conditions&quot; for the rest of this example)
* No disease (or no abnormality), and the finding is caused entirely by statistical variability

The probability that &#x27;primary hyperparathyroidism&#x27; (PH) would have occurred in the first place in the individual (&quot;P(PH WHOIFPI)&quot;) can be calculated as follows:

Let&#x27;s say that the last blood test taken by the patient was half a year ago and was normal and that the incidence of primary hyperparathyroidism in a general population appropriately matches the individual (except for the presentation and mentioned heredity) is 1 in 4000 per year. Ignoring more detailed retrospective analyses (such as including speed of disease progress and lag time of medical diagnosis), the time-at-risk for having developed primary hyperparathyroidism can roughly be regarded as being the last half-year because a previously developed hypercalcemia would probably have been caught up by the previous blood test. This corresponds to a probability of primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) in the population of:

: formula_6

With the relative risk conferred from the family history, the probability that primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) would have occurred in the first place in the individual given from the currently available information becomes:

: formula_7

Primary hyperparathyroidism can be assumed to cause hypercalcemia essentially 100% of the time (rPH → hypercalcemia = 1), so this independently calculated probability of primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) can be assumed to be the same as the probability of being a cause of the presentation:

: formula_8

For cancer, the same time-at-risk is assumed for simplicity, and let&#x27;s say that the incidence of cancer in the area is estimated at 1 in 250 per year, giving a population probability of cancer of:

: formula_9

For simplicity, let&#x27;s say that any association between a family history of primary hyperparathyroidism and risk of cancer is ignored, so the relative risk for the individual to have contracted cancer in the first place is similar to that of the population (RRcancer = 1):

: formula_10

However, hypercalcemia only occurs in, very approximately, 10% of cancers, (rcancer → hypercalcemia = 0.1), so:

: formula_11

The probabilities that hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place by other candidate conditions can be calculated in a similar manner. However, for simplicity, let&#x27;s say that the probability that any of these would have occurred in the first place is calculated at 0.0005 in this example.

For the instance of there being no disease, the corresponding probability in the population is complementary to the sum of probabilities for other conditions:

: formula_12

The probability that the individual would be healthy in the first place can be assumed to be the same:

: formula_13

The rate at which the case of no abnormal condition still ends up in measurement of serum calcium of being above the standard reference range (thereby classifying as hypercalcemia) is, by the definition of standard reference range, less than 2.5%. However, this probability can be further specified by considering how much the measurement deviates from the mean in the standard reference range. Let&#x27;s say that the serum calcium measurement was 1.30 mmol/L, which, with a standard reference range established at 1.05 to 1.25 mmol/L, corresponds to a standard score of 3 and a corresponding probability of 0.14% that such degree of hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place in the case of no abnormality:

: formula_14

Subsequently, the probability that hypercalcemia would have resulted from no disease can be calculated as:

: formula_15

The probability that hypercalcemia would have occurred in the first place in the individual can thus be calculated as:

: formula_16

Subsequently, the probability that hypercalcemia is caused by primary hyperparathyroidism (PH) in the individual can be calculated as:

: formula_17

Similarly, the probability that hypercalcemia is caused by cancer in the individual can be calculated as:

: formula_18

and for other candidate conditions:

: formula_19

and the probability that there actually is no disease:

: formula_20

For clarification, these calculations are given as the table in the method description:

Thus, this method estimates that the probability that the hypercalcemia is caused by primary hyperparathyroidism, cancer, other conditions or no disease at all are 37.3%, 6.0%, 14.9%, and 41.8%, respectively, which may be used in estimating further test indications.

This case is continued in the example of the method described in the next section.
===Likelihood ratio-based method===
The procedure of differential diagnosis can become extremely complex when fully taking additional tests and treatments into consideration. One method that is somewhat a tradeoff between being clinically perfect and being relatively simple to calculate is one that uses likelihood ratios to derive subsequent post-test likelihoods.

====Theory====
The initial likelihoods for each candidate condition can be estimated by various methods, such as:
* By epidemiology as described in the previous section.
* By clinic-specific pattern recognition, such as statistically knowing that patients coming into a particular clinic with a particular complaint statistically has a particular likelihood of each candidate condition.

One method of estimating likelihoods even after further tests uses likelihood ratios (which is derived from sensitivities and specificities) as a multiplication factor after each test or procedure. In an ideal world, sensitivities and specificities would be established for all tests for all possible pathological conditions. In reality, however, these parameters may only be established for one of the candidate conditions. Multiplying with likelihood ratios necessitates conversion of likelihoods from probabilities to &quot;odds in favor&quot; (hereafter simply termed &quot;odds&quot;) by:

: formula_21

However, only the candidate conditions with known likelihood ratio need this conversion. After multiplication, conversion back to probability is calculated by:

: formula_22

The rest of the candidate conditions (for which there is no established likelihood ratio for the test at hand) can, for simplicity, be adjusted by subsequently multiplying all candidate conditions with a common factor to again yield a sum of 100%.

The resulting probabilities are used for estimating the indications for further medical tests, treatments or other actions. If there is an indication for an additional test, and it returns with a result, then the procedure is repeated using the likelihood ratio of the additional test. With updated probabilities for each of the candidate conditions, the indications for further tests, treatments, or other actions change as well, and so the procedure can be repeated until an &quot;endpoint&quot; where there no longer is any indication for currently performing further actions. Such an endpoint mainly occurs when one candidate condition becomes so certain that no test can be found that is powerful enough to change the relative probability profile enough to motivate any change in further actions. Tactics for reaching such an endpoint with as few tests as possible includes making tests with high specificity for conditions of already outstandingly high-profile-relative probability, because the high likelihood ratio positive for such tests is very high, bringing all less likely conditions to relatively lower probabilities. Alternatively, tests with high sensitivity for competing candidate conditions have a high likelihood ratio negative, potentially bringing the probabilities for competing candidate conditions to negligible levels. If such negligible probabilities are achieved, the clinician can rule out these conditions, and continue the differential diagnostic procedure with only the remaining candidate conditions.

====Example====
This example continues for the same patient as in the example for the epidemiology-based method. As with the previous example of epidemiology-based method, this example case is made to demonstrate how this method is applied but does not represent a guideline for handling similar real-world cases. Also, the example uses relatively specified numbers, while in reality, there are often just rough estimations. In this example, the probabilities for each candidate condition were established by an epidemiology-based method to be as follows:

These percentages could also have been established by experience at the particular clinic by knowing that these are the percentages for final diagnosis for people presenting to the clinic with hypercalcemia and having a family history of primary hyperparathyroidism.

The condition of highest profile-relative probability (except &quot;no disease&quot;) is primary hyperparathyroidism (PH), but cancer is still of major concern, because if it is the actual causative condition for the hypercalcemia, then the choice of whether to treat or not likely means life or death for the patient, in effect potentially putting the indication at a similar level for further tests for both of these conditions.

Here, let&#x27;s say that the clinician considers the profile-relative probabilities of being of enough concern to indicate sending the patient a call for a clinician visit, with an additional visit to the medical laboratory for an additional blood test complemented with further analyses, including parathyroid hormone for the suspicion of primary hyperparathyroidism.

For simplicity, let&#x27;s say that the clinician first receives the blood test (in formulas abbreviated as &quot;BT&quot;) result for the parathyroid hormone analysis and that it showed a parathyroid hormone level that is elevated relative to what would be expected by the calcium level.

Such a constellation can be estimated to have a sensitivity of approximately 70% and a specificity of approximately 90% for primary hyperparathyroidism. This confers a likelihood ratio positive of 7 for primary hyperparathyroidism.

The probability of primary hyperparathyroidism is now termed &quot;Pre-BTPH&quot; because it corresponds to before the blood test (Latin preposition &quot;prae&quot; means before). It was estimated at 37.3%, corresponding to an odds of 0.595. With the likelihood ratio positive of 7 for the blood test, the test odds is calculated as:

: formula_23

where:
* &quot;Odds(PostBTPH)&quot; is the odds for primary hyperparathyroidism after the blood test for parathyroid hormone
* &quot;Odds(PreBTPH&quot; is the odds in favor of primary hyperparathyroidism before the blood test for parathyroid hormone
* &quot;LH(BT)&quot; is the likelihood ratio positive for the blood test for parathyroid hormone

An Odds(PostBTPH) of 4.16 is again converted to the corresponding probability by:

: formula_24

The sum of the probabilities for the rest of the candidate conditions should therefore be:

: formula_25

Before the blood test for parathyroid hormone, the sum of their probabilities were:

: formula_26

Therefore, to conform to a sum of 100% for all candidate conditions, each of the other candidates must be multiplied by a correcting factor:

: formula_27

For example, the probability of cancer after the test is calculated as:

: formula_28

The probabilities for each candidate conditions before and after the blood test are given in following table:
These &quot;new&quot; percentages, including a profile-relative probability of 80% for primary hyperparathyroidism, underlie any indications for further tests, treatments, or other actions. In this case, let&#x27;s say that the clinician continues the plan for the patient to attend a clinician visit for a further checkup, especially focused on primary hyperparathyroidism.

A clinician visit can, theoretically, be regarded as a series of tests, including both questions in a medical history, as well as components of a physical examination, where the post-test probability of a previous test, can be used as the pre-test probability of the next. The indications for choosing the next test are dynamically influenced by the results of previous tests.

Let&#x27;s say that the patient in this example is revealed to have at least some of the symptoms and signs of depression, bone pain, joint pain or constipation of more severity than what would be expected by the hypercalcemia itself, supporting the suspicion of primary hyperparathyroidism, and let&#x27;s say that the likelihood ratios for the tests, when multiplied together, roughly results in a product of 6 for primary hyperparathyroidism.

The presence of unspecific pathologic symptoms and signs in the history and examination are often concurrently indicative of cancer as well, and let&#x27;s say that the tests gave an overall likelihood ratio estimated at 1.5 for cancer. For other conditions, as well as the instance of not having any disease at all, let&#x27;s say that it is unknown how they are affected by the tests at hand, as often happens in reality. This gives the following results for the history and physical examination (abbreviated as P&amp;E):

These probabilities after the history and examination may make the physician confident enough to plan the patient for surgery for a parathyroidectomy to resect the affected tissue.

At this point, the probability of &quot;other conditions&quot; is so low that the physician cannot think of any test for them that could make a difference that would be substantial enough to form an indication for such a test, and the physician thereby practically regards &quot;other conditions&quot; as ruled out, in this case not primarily by any specific test for such other conditions that were negative, but rather by the absence of positive tests so far.

For &quot;cancer&quot;, the cutoff at which to confidently regard it as ruled out maybe more stringent because of severe consequences of missing it, so the physician may consider that at least a histopathologic examination of the resected tissue is indicated.

This case is continued in the example of &quot;Combinations&quot; in the corresponding section below.

==Coverage of candidate conditions==
The validity of both the initial estimation of probabilities by epidemiology and further workup by likelihood ratios are dependent on the inclusion of candidate conditions that are responsible for a large part as possible of the probability of having developed the condition, and it is clinically important to include those where relatively fast initiation of therapy is most likely to result in the greatest benefit. If an important candidate condition is missed, no method of differential diagnosis will supply the correct conclusion. The need to find more candidate conditions for inclusion increases with the increasing severity of the presentation itself. For example, if the only presentation is a deviating laboratory parameter and all common harmful underlying conditions have been ruled out, then it may be acceptable to stop finding more candidate conditions, but this would much more likely be unacceptable if the presentation would have been severe pain.

==Combinations==
If two conditions get high post-test probabilities, especially if the sum of the probabilities for conditions with known likelihood ratios becomes higher than 100%, then the actual condition is a combination of the two. In such cases, that combined condition can be added to the list of candidate conditions, and the calculations should start over from the beginning.

To continue the example used above, let&#x27;s say that the history and physical examination were indicative of cancer as well, with a likelihood ratio of 3, giving an Odds(PostH&amp;E) of 0.057, corresponding to a P(PostH&amp;E) of 5.4%. This would correspond to a &quot;Sum of known P(PostH&amp;E)&quot; of 101.5%. This is an indication for considering a combination of primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer, such as, in this case, a parathyroid hormone-producing parathyroid carcinoma. A recalculation may therefore be needed, with the first two conditions being separated into &quot;primary hyperparathyroidism without cancer&quot;, &quot;cancer without primary hyperparathyroidism&quot; as well as &quot;combined primary hyperparathyroidism and cancer&quot;, and likelihood ratios being applied to each condition separately. In this case, however, tissue has already been resected, wherein a histopathologic examination can be performed that includes the possibility of parathyroid carcinoma in the examination (which may entail appropriate sample staining).
Let&#x27;s say that the histopathologic examination confirms primary hyperparathyroidism, but also showed a malignant pattern. By an initial method by epidemiology, the incidence of parathyroid carcinoma is estimated at 1 in 6 million people per year, giving a very low probability before taking any tests into consideration. In comparison, the probability that non-malignant primary hyperparathyroidism would have occurred at the same time as an unrelated non-carcinoma cancer that presents with malignant cells in the parathyroid gland is calculated by multiplying the probabilities of the two. The resultant probability is, however, much smaller than the 1 in 6 million. Therefore, the probability of parathyroid carcinoma may still be close to 100% after histopathologic examination despite the low probability of occurring in the first place.

==Machine differential diagnosis==

Machine differential diagnosis is the use of computer software to partly or fully make a differential diagnosis. It may be regarded as an application of artificial intelligence. Alternatively, it may be seen as &quot;augmented intelligence&quot; if it meets the FDA criteria, namely that (1) it reveals the underlying data, (2) reveals the underlying logic, and (3) leaves the clinician in charge to shape and make the decision. Machine learning AI is generally seen as a device by the FDA, whereas augmented intelligence applications are not.

Many studies demonstrate improvement of quality of care and reduction of medical errors by using such decision support systems. Some of these systems are designed for a specific medical problem such as schizophrenia, Lyme disease or ventilator-associated pneumonia. Others are designed to cover all major clinical and diagnostic findings to assist physicians with faster and more accurate diagnosis.

However, these tools all still require advanced medical skills to rate symptoms and choose additional tests to deduce the probabilities of different diagnoses. Machine differential diagnosis is also currently unable to diagnose multiple concurrent disorders. Their usage by non-experts is therefore not a substitute for professional diagnosis.

==History==
The method of differential diagnosis was first suggested for use in the diagnosis of mental disorders by Emil Kraepelin. It is more systematic than the old-fashioned method of diagnosis by &quot;gestalt&quot; (impression).

==Alternative medical meanings==
&quot;Differential diagnosis&quot; is also used more loosely to refer simply to a list of the most common causes of a given symptom, to a list of disorders similar to a given disorder, or to such lists when they are annotated with advice on how to narrow the list down (&quot;French&#x27;s Index of Differential Diagnosis&quot; is an example). Thus, a differential diagnosis in this sense is medical information specially organized to aid in diagnosis.

==Usage apart from in medicine==
Methods similar to those of differential diagnostic processes in medicine are also used by biological taxonomists to identify and classify organisms, living and extinct. For example, after finding an unknown species, there can first be a listing of all potential species, followed by ruling out of one by one until, optimally, only one potential choice remains.
Similar procedures may be used by plant and maintenance engineers and automotive mechanics and used to be used in diagnosing faulty electronic circuitry.

==In popular culture==
In the American television medical drama &quot;House&quot;, the main protagonist Dr. Gregory House leads a team of diagnosticians who regularly use differential diagnostics procedures.

<text>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart&#x27;s Clarinet Concerto in A major, K. 622, was completed in October 1791 for the clarinettist Anton Stadler. It consists of three movements, in a fast–slow–fast succession.

The work was completed a few weeks before the composer&#x27;s death. It was to be his last completed work, and has been described as his swan-song. The date of its first performance is not certain, but may have been 16 October 1791 in Prague.

The concerto was written to be played on the basset clarinet, which can play lower notes than an ordinary clarinet, but after the death of Mozart it was published with changes to the solo part to allow performance on conventional instruments. The manuscript score is lost, but from the latter part of the 20th century onwards many performances of the work have been given on basset clarinets in conjectural reconstructions of Mozart&#x27;s original.

==History==

Anton Stadler, a close friend of Mozart, was a virtuoso clarinettist and co-inventor of the basset clarinet, an instrument with an extended range of lower notes. It went down to low (written) C, instead of stopping at (written) E as standard clarinets do. Stadler was also an expert player of the basset horn. Mozart first composed music for that instrument as early as 1783, and for the basset clarinet in 1787. The latter features in the instrumentation of &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; (1789). In early October 1791 Mozart wrote to his wife from Prague that he had completed &quot;Stadler&#x27;s rondo&quot; – the third movement of the Clarinet Concerto. The concerto was the final major work Mozart completed; Wolfgang Hildesheimer has described it as the composer&#x27;s &quot;last instrumental work, and his last great completed work of any kind&quot;, and the critic Henri Ghéon called it Mozart&#x27;s &quot;swan-song&quot;.

There is no surviving autograph for the concerto, and the printed score was published posthumously. The only relic of the work written in Mozart&#x27;s hand is an excerpt of an earlier rendition written for basset horn in G (K. 584b/621b). This excerpt, dating from late 1789, is nearly identical to the corresponding section in the published version for A clarinet, although only the melody lines are completely filled out. After rethinking the work as a basset clarinet concerto, Mozart gave the completed manuscript to Stadler in October 1791. The date of the first performance is not known for certain, but was probably on 16 October 1791 in Prague. Stadler gave a concert there on that day, but no programme survives.
Several notes throughout the piece go beyond the conventional range of the A clarinet, but the basset clarinet was a rare, custom-made instrument, and when the piece was published after Mozart&#x27;s death, a new version was made by unknown arrangers, with the low notes transposed to regular range. Objections were raised to this: a reviewer in the &quot;Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung&quot; commented that although the transpositions made the work playable on standard clarinets, it would have been better to publish Mozart&#x27;s original version, with the alterations printed in smaller notes as optional alternatives.

The clarinettist Alan Hacker commented in 1969 that if the original manuscript had been published, &quot;manufacturers would have made and sold basset clarinets by the thousand&quot;, but the manuscript was lost. Mozart&#x27;s widow told a publisher that Stadler had either lost it, pawned it or had it stolen from him. In 1801 three different publishing houses – André, Sieber, and Breitkopf &amp; Härtel – published editions of the work, all with the solo part adapted for the standard clarinet. These became the standard performing editions.

The basset clarinet fell out of use after Stadler&#x27;s death and no original instruments from his time have survived. The instrument was revived in the latter part of the 20th century: attempts were made to replicate the original version, and new basset clarinets have been built for the specific purpose of performing Mozart&#x27;s concerto and clarinet quintet. Some have been based on 1790s engravings showing Stadler&#x27;s instrument. On 28 June 1951, in Prague, the Czech clariettist Josef Janouš played the first modern performance of a version of the concerto reconstructed by the Czech composer Jiří Kratochvil (1924–2014), using a Selmer A clarinet with a basset lower joint, in which the four basset keys were operated with the right thumb as on the historical instruments. In 1968, the Swiss clarinettist Hans Rudolf Stalder used an instrument built by F. Arthur Uebel to perform a version of the concerto reconstructed in collaboration with Ernst Hess in Augsburg, Germany; with the Cologne Chamber Orchestra, in September 1968, he made the first recording of the concerto using a basset clarinet. Since 1984, Sabine Meyer has used a basset clarinet in A made by Herbert Wurlitzer to play the concerto (and also Mozart&#x27;s clarinet quintet). 

The first reconstruction of the concerto for basset clarinet was made in 1951 by Kratochvil. This was followed by reconstructions by others, including Hess (1968), Hans Deinzer (1970) and Alan Hacker (1974). The most frequently performed are the two versions published by Bärenreiter (Kratochvil/Hess) and Schott (Wehle/Meyer) In 2023, the clarinettist Richard Haynes undertook to rewrite the score in G major using the fragment K. 621b. Since April 2024, Haynes has been performing the concerto in this version on a basset horn in G made for him by Jochen Seggelke.

Of all the clarinet concertos, the Mozart concerto is by far the most frequently performed.

==Music==
The modern scoring of the work is for solo clarinet in A, two flutes, two bassoons, two horns and strings. The typical performance time is 29 minutes (see &quot;Audio files&quot; below).

===I. Allegro===
The concerto opens with a sonata-form movement in A major. The form of the movement is as follows:

*Orchestral &quot;ritornello&quot;: bars 1–56
*Solo exposition: bars 57–154
*&quot;Ritornello&quot;: bars 154–171
*Development: bars 172–227
*&quot;Ritornello&quot;: bars 227–250
*Recapitulation: bars 251–343
*&quot;Ritornello&quot;: bars 343–359

The first theme begins an orchestral &quot;ritornello&quot; that is joyful and light:

:&lt;score&gt;
\new Score {
 \new Staff = &quot;clarinet&quot; {
 \transpose c a
 \relative c&quot; {
 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;clarinet&quot;
 \clef treble
 \key c \major
 \time 4/4
 \tempo &quot;Allegro&quot;
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t
 \tempo 4 = 120

 g2\p e4.( f8) | a8( g) f-. e-. e4 r |
 f4( d8) r f4( d8) r | c2( b8) r r4
 }
&lt;/score&gt;
It soon transforms into a flurry of sixteenth notes in descending sequence, played by the violins and flutes while the lower instruments drive the piece forward. After the medial caesura, the strings begin a series of canons before the first closing theme, featuring first and second violins, enters. The second closing theme is much more subtle until the fanfare of its final two bars. As the soloist enters in bar 57, the clarinet repeats the opening theme with the expected added ornamentation. As the orchestra restates the main theme, the clarinet traverses the whole range of the instrument with several flourishes.

The secondary theme begins in the parallel minor, and eventually tonicizes C major before arriving in the dominant key, E major. At the end of the E-major section, there is a short pause, where the soloist conventionally improvises a short &quot;eingang&quot; (cadenza), although no context is offered for a true cadenza. The canonic material of the opening ritornello returns, this time involving the clarinet and leads to the novel feature of the soloist accompanying the orchestra with an Alberti bass over the first closing theme. The orchestral ritornello returns, ending with the second closing theme.

The development section explores a few new key areas including F minor and D major, and even has some hints of the Baroque. Before the formal orchestral &quot;ritornello&quot; leading into the recapitulation, Mozart writes a series of descending sequences with the cellos and bassoons holding suspensions over staccato strings.

As is conventional in Classical concerto form, in the recapitulation the soloist and orchestra are united, and the secondary theme is altered to stay in the tonic. As the secondary theme comes to a close, the clarinet has another chance to improvise briefly, and this time leads the canonic material that follows. The Alberti bass and arpeggios over diminished chords for the soloist recur before the movement ends in a cheerful final orchestral &quot;ritornello&quot;.

At around 12 minutes, the Allegro is the longest movement in the concerto. 

===II. Adagio===
The second movement, which is in rounded binary form (i.e. ABA&#x27;), is in the subdominant D major. The two-part, cantabile 16-bar main theme is first performed by the solo clarinet and repeated by the orchestra:
:&lt;score&gt;
\new Score {
 \new Staff = &quot;clarinet&quot; {
 \transpose c a
 \relative c&#x27; {
 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;clarinet&quot;
 \clef treble
 \key f \major
 \time 3/4
 \tempo &quot;Adagio&quot;
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t
 \tempo 4 = 60

 c4( f4. a8) | a8( g) f4 r | c4.( f8 a c) | c8( bes) a4 r |
 }
&lt;/score&gt;

The B section, in which the solo part is always prominent, exploits the chalumeau (lowest) register, including (in the reconstructed version) the basset tones down to (written) C3 (sounding A2), the lowest tone which the basset clarinet in A can play, and also uses the clarion register (the middle register). This section is followed in bar 59 by the aforementioned cadenza, which in turn is followed by the first theme, played &quot;piano&quot; (sometimes &quot;pianissimo&quot;) by the clarinet, which concludes the movement with a coda.

===III. Rondo: Allegro===
The concerto ends with a movement in A major. This movement is a blend of sonata and rondo forms that Mozart developed in his piano concertos, most notably the A major Piano Concerto, K. 488. It is in A–B–A–C–A–B–A form, with the middle A&#x27;s being shorter restatements of the theme, unlike regular rondo form which is ABACA.

The movement opens with a cheerful theme:
:&lt;score&gt;
\new Score {
 \new Staff = &quot;clarinet&quot; {
 \transpose c a
 \relative c&#x27; {
 \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;clarinet&quot;
 \clef treble
 \key c \major
 \time 6/8
 \tempo &quot;Allegro&quot;
 \set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t
 \tempo 8 = 240

 \partial 16*2 e16( f) | g8-. g-. g-. a16( g fis g a g) |
 f!4.( e8) r c&#x27;16( b) | a8-. a-. a16( g) f8-. f16( e d c) |
 b8-.( c-. cis-.) d r
 }
&lt;/score&gt;

This refrain is interspersed with episodes either echoing this mood or recalling the darker colours of the first movement:
* The first A (bars 1–56) features the soloist in dialogue with the orchestra, often one phrase eliding seamlessly into the next. In some ways the orchestra and soloist are competing with one another – the more definitive the statement made by the orchestra, the more virtuosic the response by the clarinet.
* The first B (bars 57–113) begins with a lyrical theme, and eventually features chromaticism and some very dramatic lines which feature the extended range of the basset clarinet.
* The second A (114–137) is heard again briefly, before the orchestra moves right into the closing theme of the original A section, this time employing a descending sequence and hemiola, modulating to the relative minor.
* The C section (bars 137–177), according to the musicologist Colin Lawson, contains &quot;one of the most dramatic showcases for the basset clarinet in the entire concerto, featuring spectacular leaps, together with dialogue between soprano and baritone registers.&quot; Starting in F minor, this section eventually modulates back to A major.
* Bars 178–187 serve as the third A. By no means a full statement of the refrain, in this section Mozart sets the motif from the A section as a sequence of descending thirds leading to a stop on the dominant chord.
* The second B (bars 188–246) begins like the first but is extended and explores some different key areas. This allows the soloist frequent opportunities to display chromatic figurations, and the composer to demonstrate his creativity in the reworking of the material.
* The refrain (bars 247–301) is heard for the final time, finally in its entirety, before proceeding to the coda (bars 301–353). Here the rondo theme is developed dramatically, using the full range of the clarinet. The coda builds until a brief pause allows the solo clarinet to lead the orchestra into one more extended statement of the A theme, followed by the orchestra&#x27;s now familiar closing theme of A.

== Recordings ==
The first recording of the concerto, made in 1929 (Brunswick Records 20076‑8), featured as soloist, conducted by Clarence Raybould. It was followed by recordings with Luigi Amodio and as soloists. None of these three versions were thought to have survived but copies of Draper&#x27;s version have been found in Australian pressings. The first recordings of the reconstructed counterpart were made in September 1968 with the Swiss clarinettist and the Cologne Chamber Orchestra, conducted by Helmut Müller-Brühl. For this and for concert performances, Stalder had a modern Boehm basset clarinet built at the F. Arthur Uebel factory in Markneukirchen, Saxony.

The first recording using a reconstruction of a period basset clarinet was in 1973 on the EMI label with Hans Deinzer and the conductorless Collegium Aureum. Parts of the concerto are heard in the score of &quot;The King&#x27;s Speech&quot; (2010; orchestral sections only), and the Adagio is heard in &quot;Out of Africa&quot; (1985), with the soloist Jack Brymer.

<doc id="915088" wikidata="Q2292640" url="?curid=915088" title="Ski pole">
<text>Ski poles, also referred to as poles (in North America), sticks (UK), or stocks (Australia), are used by skiers for balance and propulsion. Modern ski poles are most commonly made from aluminum and carbon fiber, though materials such as bamboo are still used. Poles are used in alpine skiing, freestyle skiing (with the exception of aerials), and cross-country skiing. Ski jumpers do not use poles.

==History==

, the earliest ski pole was found in Sweden and dates back to 3623 BC, while the earliest depiction of a man with a ski pole was found in Norway in the form of a cave painting, dated at 4000 BC. Early skiers would use this pole for the purposes of balancing, braking, and turning. Alpine societies such as those in Nordic regions or the Altai mountains used their ski poles to hunt as well, giving them spear-like qualities. Skiers began to use two ski poles in 1741. This provided greater balance than one pole could provide and made pushing through the snow easier.

Early ski poles were made of pine and bamboo, materials which today are used for novelty poles. US patents for steel ski poles began in 1933 when John B. Dickson invented a new design calling for the use of steel as the shaft material. This construction was superseded by Edward L. Scott, who is credited with popularizing the lightweight aluminum ski pole in 1959, deriving his modern design from golf club shafts. This new stiff and lightweight pole made it easier for skiers to pole-plant and initiate fast, short turns.

The most modern material used in ski pole production is carbon fiber. A patent has been filed on a biocomposite material that can be used for ski poles, but this design has yet to be manufactured. Axel Composites has a patent for carbon fiber ski poles dating back to 1975, however, inventor David P. Goode&#x27;s improved design from 1989 became the first widely produced. The carbon fiber pole builds on the same qualities of the aluminum pole: lightness and stiffness while being extremely strong.

==Features of ski poles==
* Basket: Near the bottom end of the shaft, designed to stop the pole from sinking significantly into deep snow. These can range from being small, aerodynamic cones used in racing, to large snowflake shaped baskets which are used in powder skiing. Many poles feature methods of easily switching between baskets, such as threading on the basket and pole.
* Grip: Attached to the upper part of the pole is a grip with a strap. These are slipped over the wrist to improve the skiers hold on the grip and to prevent the loss of the pole in the event of a fall. When backcountry skiing, the wrist strap may not be used to prevent wrist injury if the pole should catch on an unseen branch or root. Releasable strap systems have been implemented by pole manufacturers as well, which serve to prevent wrist injuries in the event of a crash.
* Length: Pole length varies according to use. Telescopic poles are available for adjustment while out skiing.
* Material: As noted previously, poles come in a two overarching materials, aluminum and carbon, alongside niche materials such as wood. Ski poles will sometimes use a mixture of materials, such as carbon-kevlar composites.

==Pole types==
===Alpine skiing===
Poles are used in alpine skiing to add propulsion and to aid in controlling upper body position at turn initiation.

Racing poles have their own unique distinctions. Super giant slalom, downhill, and speed skiing poles are designed to bend around the skier&#x27;s body while in a tuck position to minimize drag. In slalom skiing, straight poles are used due to the reduced speeds and increased reliance on poles. Slalom poles will often come with a guard attached to the grip for the purpose of deflecting gates.

Giant slalom skiers choose a straight or bent pole based on personal preference and situation; giant slalom courses can vary greatly in speed and in the case of slower courses, aerodynamic drag does not have as great a factor.

===Cross-country skiing===
Poles enable cross-country skiers to apply power to the snow, using arm motion; poles can also provide stability. In competitive cross-country skiing, poling technique is essential, especially so during a mass start in which double-poling is the main means of propulsion.

Longer poles are used for cross country because of different techniques. Pole length for classic (aka diagonal-stride) technique is typically measured from the ground to the skier&#x27;s armpit. For skating (aka freestyle) technique the length of the pole is typically from the ground to the skier&#x27;s upper lip. These length selections balance between maximum thrust and technique considerations. Most Nordic ski pole manufacturers have sizing charts available.

===Nordic walking===
Nordic walking poles are largely similar to composite cross-country ski poles, just shorter in length and with a basket smaller than that of the racing cross country ski pole. The Nordic walking pole strap resembles a fingerless glove and is similar to the racing cross country ski pole strap.

<text>Edwin Stafford Nelson (December 21, 1928 – August 9, 2014) was an American actor, best known for his role as Dr. Michael Rossi in the television series &quot;Peyton Place&quot;.

Nelson appeared in episodes of many TV programs, more than 50 movies, and hundreds of stage productions.

==Early life==
Nelson was raised in North Carolina after having been born in New Orleans, Louisiana. He was educated at Edwards Military Institute and Camp Lejeune High School, playing football and basketball at the latter school.

He began acting while attending Tulane University in New Orleans. He left college after two years to study at the New York School of Radio and Television Technique. He served in the U.S. Navy as a radioman on the light cruiser USS &quot;Dayton&quot;. He took a position as a director at WDSU-TV in New Orleans. By 1956, acting became his central focus, and he moved to the Los Angeles area.

== Career ==
Early in his career Nelson acted and did stunt work for B-movie producer Roger Corman on the films &quot;Swamp Women&quot; (1956), &quot;Attack of the Crab Monsters&quot; (1957), &quot;Rock All Night&quot; (1957), &quot;Carnival Rock&quot; (1957), &quot;Night of the Blood Beast&quot; (1958), &quot;The Cry Baby Killer&quot; (1958), &quot;Teenage Cave Man&quot; (1958), and &quot;A Bucket of Blood&quot; (1959). In 1958, he acted in and produced actor-director Bruno VeSota&#x27;s science-fiction/horror movie &quot;The Brain Eaters&quot;, with Roger Corman as the executive producer. The same year, he was cast as the lead in &quot;Devil&#x27;s Partner&quot;, but the movie was not released until 1962. He also appeared in the 1960 thriller &quot;Valley of the Redwoods&quot; and the 1963 comedy drama &quot;Soldier in the Rain&quot;, starring Steve McQueen and Jackie Gleason.

Nelson&#x27;s television career featured many guest-starring roles, such as the talented, arrogant Dr. Wade Parsons in the 1962 episode &quot;Doctor on Horseback&quot; of the western series &quot;The Tall Man&quot;.

Nelson was cast in episodes of such other westerns as &quot;Maverick&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;Black Saddle&quot;, &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot;, &quot;The Rebel&quot; (five times), &quot;Johnny Ringo&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Rawhide&quot;, &quot;Tombstone Territory&quot;, &quot;Bat Masterson&quot;, &quot;Laramie&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Stoney Burke&quot;, &quot;The Dakotas&quot;, &quot;The Rifleman&quot; and &quot;Redigo&quot;. He appeared on drama and adventure series too, such as &quot;Combat!&quot;, &quot;The Fugitive&quot;, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Flight&quot;, &quot;The Silent Service&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, &quot;The Outer Limits&quot;, &quot;Harbor Command&quot;, &quot;Tightrope&quot;, &quot;Coronado 9&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Thriller&quot;, and &quot;Channing&quot;. He guest-starred on &quot;&quot;, Highway Patrol, and military sitcom/drama &quot;Hennesey&quot;.

He made two guest appearances on &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, both times as the defendant; in 1961, he played Ward Nichols in &quot;The Case of the Left-Handed Liar,&quot; and in 1964, he played Dirk Blake, father of the title character, in &quot;The Case of the Missing Button&quot;. He played rival mystery writer Tom Keller opposite James Mason as Warren Barrow on &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; S1 E5 &quot;Captive Audience&quot; (1962). He also portrayed an assistant district attorney on the TV series Adam 12 in 1974.

==&quot;Peyton Place&quot; and later roles==
In 1964, Nelson secured his most famous role, portraying Dr. Michael Rossi on the drama &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, staying with the series during its entire run from 1964 to 1969. Nelson reprised his role in two TV movies: &quot;Murder in Peyton Place&quot; and &quot;Peyton Place: The Next Generation&quot;.

After &quot;Peyton Place&quot;, Nelson worked in many more productions of all varieties. He teamed with former &quot;Peyton Place&quot; co-star Percy Rodriguez in the television series &quot;The Silent Force&quot;, which ran for 15 episodes in 1970–1971. He guest-starred with David Janssen in &quot;The Fugitive&quot; in 1963, and appeared as a different character later in the series. Subsequently, Nelson had guest-starring roles on many of the popular dramas of the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Laramie&quot;, &quot;Cannon&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Hara, U.S. Treasury&quot;, &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, &quot;Banacek&quot;, &quot;Alias Smith and Jones&quot;, &quot;Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot; (in 3 different roles), &quot;Adam-12&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot; Medical Center&quot; (3 roles), &quot;The Bionic Woman&quot;, &quot;Gibbsville&quot;, &quot;McMillan and Wife&quot;, &quot;Dallas&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot; (2 roles), &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; (2 roles), &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;, &quot;Lou Grant&quot;, &quot;Trapper John, M.D.&quot;, &quot;Vega$&quot; (2 roles), &quot;CHiPs&quot;, &quot;Quincy M.E.&quot;, &quot;Matt Houston&quot;, &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, &quot;Dynasty&quot;, &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;, &quot;MacGyver&quot;, &quot;Jake and the Fatman&quot; (2 roles), and &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; (5 roles).

Nelson appeared in many television movies such as &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; (1970), &quot;The Screaming Woman&quot; (1972), &quot;Runaway!&quot; (1973), &quot;Houston, We&#x27;ve Got a Problem&quot; (1974), &quot;The Missing Are Deadly&quot; (1975), &quot;Superdome&quot; (1978), &quot;Doctors&#x27; Private Lives&quot; (1978) and &quot;Crash&quot; (1978), and served as host on the morning talk show &quot;The Ed Nelson Show&quot;, which he hosted for three years. During the 1980s, Nelson took on the role of patriarchal Senator Mark Denning in the daytime serial &quot;Capitol&quot;. In late 1986, Nelson was upset to discover that the show&#x27;s writers had turned his character into a traitor, and quit the show in disgust, last airing in early January 1987, two months before the show&#x27;s cancellation.

He also continued appearing in theatrical films, such as &quot;Airport 1975&quot; (1974), &quot;That&#x27;s the Way of the World&quot; (1975), &quot;Acapulco Gold&quot; (1976), &quot;Midway&quot; (1976), &quot;For the Love of Benji&quot; (1977), &quot;Police Academy 3: Back in Training&quot; (1986), &quot;Brenda Starr&quot; (1989), &quot;The Boneyard&quot; (1991), &quot;Who Am I?&quot; (1998) and &quot;Runaway Jury&quot; (2003).

He spent several years playing U.S. President Harry S. Truman on stage, replacing James Whitmore for the National Tour of &quot;Give &#x27;Em Hell, Harry&quot;.

==Personal life==
While living in Los Angeles, Nelson was an active member of the Screen Actors Guild and was elected to the union board for many years. Nelson was a long-standing member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. In the early 1970s, he ran for city council and mayor of San Dimas, California until a Federal Communications Commission ruling stated that his political opponents must be given equal time if he appeared in television programs.

== Later years ==
In 1999, Nelson returned to Tulane University to finish credits toward his undergraduate degree, which he completed the following year at age 71. He and his wife, Patsy, enjoyed semi-retirement visiting their six children and 14 grandchildren. One of his children is actor Christopher S. Nelson.

Until 2005, he had been teaching acting and screenwriting in New Orleans at two local universities. Hurricane Katrina prompted him to move his family far to the north to Sterlington, Louisiana. At the time of his death, however, he had moved to Greensboro, North Carolina, where he had been in hospice care. He died at age 85.

== Death ==
Nelson died on August 9, 2014, in Greensboro, North Carolina from congestive heart failure. He was 85 years old.

<text>Paul Harrison Tibbitt IV (born May 13, 1968) is an American animator, writer, and voice actor, best known for his work on the animated series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. After its creator Stephen Hillenburg resigned in 2004, Tibbitt took his position of showrunner for the show&#x27;s remaining seasons. He also took over as the voice of Potty the Parrot, whom Hillenburg had voiced until his resignation. Tibbitt made his feature film directorial debut directing &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot;. He studied in the Character Animation program at the California Institute of the Arts.

In 2015, Vincent Waller (a creative director) and Marc Ceccarelli (a writer and storyboard director) took Tibbitt&#x27;s place as supervising producer and showrunner. It was also announced that Tibbitt would leave the series after season 9 to work on &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run&quot; (which was produced and released by a separate crew with limited involvement from the show&#x27;s crew), but he lent his directing and writing position to Tim Hill.

<doc id="915098" wikidata="Q1722815" url="?curid=915098" title="Kamae">
<text>is a Japanese term used in martial arts and traditional theater. It translates approximately to &quot;posture&quot;. The Kanji of this word means &quot;base&quot;. The implied meaning is &#x27;readiness&#x27; or &#x27;be ready&#x27;. 

Kamae is to be differentiated from the word , used in Japanese martial arts to mean stance. While &quot;tachi&quot; (pronounced &quot;dachi&quot; when used in a compound) refers to the position of the body from the waist down, kamae refers to the posture of the entire body, as well as encompassing one&#x27;s mental posture (i.e., one&#x27;s attitude). These connected mental and physical aspects of readiness may be referred to individually as and , respectively.

Although it is a generic term, context may mean there&#x27;s a default specific posture which is being implicitly referred to. e.g. many modern styles use &quot;kamae&quot; by itself as shorthand usually for the style&#x27;s basic stance for sparring or self-defense.

As a further note, there are also related verbs, and adding &quot;te&quot; to the end of kamae makes the command for . Thus, a karate instructor ordering the students to assume a front stance might shout, &quot;&quot;Zenkutsu dachi&quot;, &quot;kamaete&quot;!&quot;

== In Aikidō ==
Kamae is a basic stance, also defined as natural. In it, the body&#x27;s three centers of gravity are aligned on a vertical axis of gravity. Those three centers begin with the head, then spinal column, and lower abdomen. This allows for a balanced stance, regardless of positioning of one&#x27;s feet. It also allows one to move freely into any desired direction.

== In Kendō ==

There are five basic kamae in Kendo: &quot;jōdan&quot;, &quot;chūdan&quot;, &quot;gedan&quot;, &quot;hassō&quot; and &quot;waki&quot;. Of these, chūdan-no-kamae (中段の構え; middle stance) is the most basic posture. It provides a balance between attacking and defensive techniques.

== In Karate ==
The generally used form of kamae in karate is where the martial artist places his right hand guarding the solar plexus and the left hand outstretched at shoulder height. This is to allow blocking with the left hand and counter-strikes with the right hand (or vice versa depending on the stance).

== In Taijutsu ==
The kamae in Taijutsu are considered as adaptable postures that occur as &#x27;snapshots&#x27; of sequences of movement, rather than fixed attacking or receiving positions. The basic kamae is ichimonji-no-kamae (一文字の構え), which refers to the &#x27;straight-line&#x27; that reflects the shape of the body when adopting this position.

<text>Thomas Lovell Beddoes (30 June 1803 – 26 January 1849) was an English poet, dramatist and physician.

== Biography ==
Born in Clifton, Bristol, England, he was the son of Dr. Thomas Beddoes, a friend of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Anna, sister of Maria Edgeworth. He was educated at Charterhouse and Pembroke College, Oxford. He published in 1821 &quot;The Improvisatore&quot;, which he afterwards endeavoured to suppress. His next venture, a blank-verse drama called &quot;The Bride&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (1822), was published and well reviewed, and won for him the friendship of Barry Cornwall.

Beddoes&#x27;s work shows a constant preoccupation with death. In 1824, he went to Göttingen to study medicine, motivated by his hope of discovering physical evidence of a human spirit which survives the death of the body. He was expelled, and then went to Würzburg to complete his training. He then wandered about practising his profession, and expounding democratic theories which got him into trouble. He was deported from Bavaria in 1833, and had to leave Zürich, where he had settled, in 1840.

He continued to write, but published nothing.

He led an itinerant life after leaving Switzerland, returning to England only in 1846, before going back to Germany. He became increasingly disturbed, and committed suicide by poison at Basel, in 1849, at the age of 45.

For some time before his death he had been engaged on a drama, &quot;Death&#x27;s Jest Book&quot;, which was published in 1850 with a memoir by his friend, T. F. Kelsall. His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; were published in 1851.

== Reception ==
Critics have faulted Beddoes as a dramatist. According to Arthur Symons, &quot;of really dramatic power he had nothing. He could neither conceive a coherent plot, nor develop a credible situation.&quot; His plots are convoluted, and such was his obsession with the questions posed by death that his characters lack individuation; they all struggle with the same ideas that vexed Beddoes. However, his poetry is &quot;full of thought and richness of diction&quot;, in the words of John William Cousin, who praised Beddoes&#x27;s short pieces such as &quot;If thou wilt ease thine heart&quot; (from &quot;Death&#x27;s Jest-Book&quot;, Act II) and &quot;If there were dreams to sell&quot; (&quot;Dream-Pedlary&quot;) as &quot;masterpieces of intense feeling exquisitely expressed&quot;. Lytton Strachey referred to Beddoes as &quot;the last Elizabethan&quot;, and said that he was distinguished not for his &quot;illuminating views on men and things, or for a philosophy&quot;, but for the quality of his expression. Philip B. Anderson said the lyrics of &quot;Death&#x27;s Jest Book&quot;, exemplified by &quot;Sibylla&#x27;s Dirge&quot; and &quot;The Swallow Leaves Her Nest&quot;, are &quot;Beddoes&#x27; best work. These lyrics display a delicacy of form, a voluptuous horror, an imagistic compactness and suggestiveness, and, occasionally, a grotesque comic power that are absolutely unique.&quot;

&quot;The Bride&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; and especially &quot;Death&#x27;s Jest-Book&quot; are much quoted from in epigraphs to the chapters of Dorothy L. Sayers&#x27; book &quot;Have His Carcase&quot;.

<text>Jessica Tarahata Hagedorn (born May 29, 1949) is an American playwright, writer, poet, and multimedia performance artist.

==Biography==
Hagedorn is an of mixed descent. She was born in Manila, Philippines, to a mother of Scots-Irish, French, and Filipino descent and a father of Filipino, Spanish, and Chinese heritage. Moving to San Francisco, California, in 1963, Hagedorn received her education at the American Conservatory Theater training program. To further pursue playwriting and music, she moved to New York City in 1978.

In 1978, Joseph Papp produced Hagedorn&#x27;s first play, &quot;Mango Tango&quot;. Hagedorn&#x27;s other productions include &quot;Tenement Lover&quot;, &quot;Holy Food&quot;, and &quot;Teenytown&quot;. Her mixed media style often incorporates song, poetry, images, and spoken dialogue. From 1975 until 1985, she was the leader of a poet&#x27;s band—The West Coast Gangster Choir (in SF) and later The Gangster Choir (in New York).

In 1985, 1986, 1989, and 1994 she received MacDowell Colony fellowships, which helped enable her to write the novel &quot;Dogeaters&quot;, which illuminates many different aspects of Filipino experience, focusing on the influence of America through radio, television, and movie theaters. She shows the complexities of the love-hate relationship many Filipinos in diaspora feel toward their past. After its publication in 1990, her novel earned a 1990 National Book Award nomination and an American Book Award. In 1998 La Jolla Playhouse produced a stage adaptation. In 2001, the play adaptation premiered off-Broadway at The Public Theater.

Hagedorn worked with playwrights and artists Robbie McCauley and Laurie Carlos as the collective Thought Music, which later expanded to include visual artist John Woo as well. Together Thought Music created a number of works including &quot;Teenytown&quot; (presented at La Mama in 1987) and &quot;class&quot; (presented at The Kitchen in 2000). Thought Music together investigated race, class, sexism, and the role of immigrants in the United States. Hagedorn, with Thought Music and on her own, has also collaborated with Urban Bush Women on works including &quot;Heat&quot; and &quot;Lipstick&quot;.

Hagedorn, alongside bell hooks, June Jordan, and seven others, won the Lila Wallace-Reader&#x27;s Digest Fund annual Writer&#x27;s Awards in 1994 and they received $105,000 each.

In 2006, Hagedorn was one of the first eight playwrights to receive the Lucille Lortel Foundation fellowship.

In 2021, Hagedorn was the recipient of the Bret Adams and Paul Reisch Foundation&#x27;s 2021 Idea Awards for Theatre, winning The Tooth of Time Distinguished Career Award and $20,000. Hagedorn, in collaboration with Two River Theater, is also working on a musical detailing the rise of Jean and June Millington of Fanny.

Hagedorn lives in New York City with her daughters.

<text>Portobelo (Modern Spanish: &quot;Puerto Bello&quot; (&quot;beautiful port&quot;), historically in Portuguese: Porto Belo) is a historic port and corregimiento in Portobelo District, Colón Province, Panama. Located on the northern part of the Isthmus of Panama, it is northeast of the modern port of Colón now at the Atlantic entrance to the Panama Canal. It has a population of 4,559 , and functions as the seat of Portobelo District. 

Established in 1597 for its deep natural harbor, it joined Veracruz ( to the northwest) as ports used by the Spanish Empire to ship treasure from the mines of Peru (via Panama City on the Pacific side of the Isthmus and overland to Portobelo) back to Spain. The city was repeatedly captured by British privateers and pirates, culminating in a successful siege by the Royal Navy in 1739, during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear.

Its economy received a major boost in the late-19th century during the construction of the Panama Canal. In 1980, UNESCO designated the Fortifications on the Caribbean Side of Panama: Portobelo-San Lorenzo, including the ruins of the Spanish colonial fortifications and nearby Fort San Lorenzo, as a World Heritage Site. 

==History==

Portobelo was founded in 1597 by Spanish explorer Francisco Velarde y Mercado and quickly replaced Nombre de Dios as a Caribbean port for Peruvian silver. Legend has it that Christopher Columbus originally named the port &quot;Puerto Bello&quot;, meaning &quot;Beautiful Port&quot;, in 1502. After Francis Drake died of dysentery in 1596 at sea, he was buried at sea in a lead coffin near Portobelo Bay, memorialised by the present &quot;Isla Drake&quot; (&quot;Drake Island&quot;) at the mouth of the harbour. During the 16th to the 18th centuries it was an important silver-exporting port in New Granada on the Spanish Main and one of the two Atlantic ports on the route of the Spanish treasure fleets. The Spanish built defensive fortifications.

In 1601 the English privateer William Parker captured Portobello from the Spanish. Welshman Henry Morgan repeated the feat in 1668, having led a fleet of privateers and 450 men and overcame its strong fortifications. His forces plundered it for 14 days before withdrawing. It was captured again in 1680 by pirate John Coxon.

In 1726 the British suffered a disaster in their Blockade of Porto Bello under Admiral Francis Hosier, an attempt to prevent the Spanish treasure fleet returning to Spain, when due to their lengthy wait and inactivity (as ordered by the British government) moored at Bastimentos to the northeast (not to be confused with another Bastimentos Island 270 miles to the west), the large part of the sailors died from tropical diseases. The disaster was vindicated 13 years later when during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear the port was attacked and captured on November 21, 1739, by a British fleet of six ships commanded by Admiral Edward Vernon. The victory created an outburst of popular acclaim throughout the British Empire. More medals were struck for Vernon than for any other 18th-century British figure and across the British Isles the name of &quot;Portobello&quot; was given to places and streets in honor of the victory, most notably Portobello Road in London, the district of Portobello in Edinburgh and the Portobello Barracks in Dublin.

However the Spanish soon recovered Portobelo when in 1741 they defeated Admiral Vernon in the Battle of Cartagena de Indias and forced him to return to England with a decimated fleet, having suffered more than 18,000 casualties, mostly due to disease. British efforts to gain a foothold on the Spanish Main and disrupt the galleon trade were ultimately fruitless. Following the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, the Spanish switched from using large fleets calling at few ports to small fleets trading at a wide variety of ports, developing a flexibility that made them less subject to attack. Ships also began to travel around Cape Horn to trade directly at ports on the western coast.

==Today==

The population of Portobelo in 1990 was 3,058 and in 2000 was 3,867. In July 2012 the UNESCO World Heritage Committee placed Portobelo and nearby Fort San Lorenzo on the List of World Heritage in Danger, inscribed as Fortifications on the Caribbean Side of Panama: Portobelo-San Lorenzo, citing environmental factors, lack of maintenance, and uncontrolled urban developments.
In London the Portobello Road is a famous street market, dating back to the 19th century with millions of visitors each year.

<text>An appeal to probability (or appeal to possibility, also known as &quot;possibiliter ergo probabiliter&quot;, &quot;possibly, therefore probably&quot;) is the logical fallacy of taking something for granted because it is possibly the case. The fact that an event is possible does not imply that the event is probable, nor that the event was realized. 

==Example==
A fallacious appeal to possibility:
:If it &quot;can&quot; happen .
:It &quot;will&quot; happen. 

:Something can go wrong .
:Therefore, something will go wrong .
:If I do not bring my umbrella 
:It will rain. .

Murphy&#x27;s law is a (typically deliberate, tongue-in-cheek) invocation of the fallacy.

<doc id="915123" wikidata="Q141638" url="?curid=915123" title="Barney Google and Snuffy Smith">
<text>Barney Google and Snuffy Smith, originally Take Barney Google, for Instance, is an American comic strip created by cartoonist Billy DeBeck. Since its debut on June 17, 1919, the strip has gained a large international readership, appearing in 900 newspapers in 21 countries. The initial appeal of the strip led to its adaptation to film, animation, popular song, and television. It added several terms and phrases to the English language and inspired the 1923 hit tune &quot;Barney Google (with the Goo-Goo-Googly Eyes)&quot; with lyrics by Billy Rose, as well as the 1923 record &quot;Come On, Spark Plug!&quot;

Barney Google himself, once the star of the strip and a very popular character in his own right, was at one point almost entirely phased out of the feature. An increasingly peripheral player in his own strip beginning in the late 1930s, Barney was officially &quot;written out&quot; in 1954, although he occasionally returned for cameo appearances, often years apart. During a period between 1997 and 2012, Barney Google was not seen in the strip at all. Barney was reintroduced to the strip in 2012, and has slowly returned to being a semi-regular character.

Snuffy Smith, who was initially introduced as a supporting player in 1934, has now been the comic strip&#x27;s central character for over 60 years. Nevertheless, the feature is still titled &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot;.

As of June 17, 2019, &quot;Barney Google&quot; has run for an entire century, making it the third-longest running and uninterrupted comics series of all time, after Rudolph Dirks&#x27; &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot; and Frank O. King&#x27;s &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;. After &quot;Gasoline Alley&quot;, it is the second-longest running newspaper comic still in syndication and producing new episodes as of 2021.

==Characters and story==

===Barney Google===

Like &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot;, &quot;Barney Google&quot; started out on the sports page. First appearing as a daily strip in the sports sections of the &quot;Chicago Herald&quot; and &quot;Examiner&quot; in 1919, it was originally titled &quot;Take Barney Google, for Instance&quot;. The title character, a little fellow (although he shrank in stature even more after the first year) with big &quot;banjo&quot; eyes, was an avid sportsman and ne&#x27;er-do-well involved in poker, horse racing, and prize fights.

The &quot;goggle-eyed, moustached, gloved and top-hatted, bulbous-nosed, cigar-chomping shrimp&quot; (according to comics historian Bill Blackbeard) was relentlessly henpecked by &quot;a wife three times his size&quot; (as the song lyric goes). The formidable Mrs. Lizzie Google, or &quot;the sweet woman&quot;, sued Barney for divorce and thereafter virtually disappeared from the strip. By October 1919, the strip was distributed by King Features Syndicate and was published in newspapers across the country.

His name might have been an inspiration for the large number name googol, which in turn inspired the company name Google.

===Spark Plug===

Beginning on July 17, 1922, the strip took a momentous turn in popularity with the seemingly innocuous introduction of an endearing race horse named &quot;Spark Plug&quot;. Barney&#x27;s beloved &quot;brown-eyed baby&quot; was a bow-legged nag that seldom raced, and was typically seen almost totally covered by his trademark patched blanket with his name scrawled on the side. &quot;Peanuts&quot; creator Charles M. Schulz was known to his friends as Sparky, a lifelong nickname given to him by his uncle as a diminutive of &quot;Barney Google&quot;&#x27;s Spark Plug. Comics historian Don Markstein noted:

In deference to his enormous popularity during this period, the strip was retitled &quot;Barney Google and Spark Plug&quot;. DeBeck&#x27;s strip hit its peak of popularity with Spark Plug at about the same time the 1923 song &quot;Barney Google&quot;, written by Billy Rose and Con Conrad, was sweeping the country. It became one of the best known, most iconic novelty records of its era, and has been recorded by such artists as The Happiness Boys, Eddie Cantor, The Andrews Sisters, Spike Jones, and Mitch Miller:

Other popular characters and concepts introduced in the strip about this time include &quot;Sunshine&quot;, Barney&#x27;s black jockey, a troublesome ostrich named &quot;Rudy&quot;, &quot;Sully&quot;, a monocled champion wrestler, and the mysterious hooded fraternity &quot;The Order of the Brotherhood of Billy Goats&quot;, a parody of mystic secret societies. (There was also a &quot;Sisterhood of Nanny Goats&quot; for women.) Their password was &quot;O-K-M-N-X&quot; which, deciphered, stood for a standard breakfast order (&quot;Okay, ham and eggs&quot;). Barney was elected &quot;Exalted Angora&quot; in 1928.

===Transition to &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot;===
In 1934, an even greater change took place when Barney and his horse visited the North Carolina mountains and met a volatile, equally diminutive moonshiner named Snuffy Smith. Hillbilly humor was popular at the time (as Al Capp was proving with &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;). The strip increasingly focused on the southern Appalachian hamlet of &quot;Hootin&#x27; Holler&quot;, with Snuffy as the main character. The mountaineer locals are suspicious of any outsiders, referred to as &quot;flatlanders&quot; or even worse, &quot;revenooers&quot; (Federal Revenue agents).

Snuffy Smith was so popular that his name was added to the strip&#x27;s title in the late 1930s, while the top-billed Barney Google became an increasingly peripheral character in what once was his own comic. Eventually, Barney Google left Hootin&#x27; Holler in 1954 to return to the city, and was essentially written out of the strip except as a very occasional visitor. Barney has appeared rarely in the feature from the mid-1950s on, but returned to Hootin&#x27; Holler for a visit in a series of strips beginning on February 19, 2012. Prior to 2012, Barney had not appeared in the strip since January 5, 1997, a span of over 15 years. Nevertheless, even during Barney&#x27;s long absence the strip was always officially titled &quot;Barney Google &amp; Snuffy Smith&quot;.

Barney Google — usually with Spark Plug in tow — made occasional return trips to Hootin&#x27; Holler from 2012 to 2020, and moved back permanently to Hootin&#x27; Holler in a series of strips run in May 2021. He still appears infrequently, but is now more of an occasional supporting player (as opposed to a very occasional guest).

Also appearing again on an infrequent basis is Spark Plug, and — slightly more frequently — new cast addition &quot;Li&#x27;l Sparky&quot;, billed as Spark Plug&#x27;s grandson.

===Snuffy Smith and the townsfolk of Hootin&#x27; Holler===
Snuffy Smith (whose last name is pronounced &quot;Smif&quot; by virtually all the characters in Hootin&#x27; Holler) is an ornery little cuss, sawed-off and shiftless. He lives in a shack, mangles the English language, and has a propensity to shoot at those who displease him. He makes &quot;corn-likker&quot; moonshine in a homemade still and is in constant trouble with the sheriff. He wears a broad-brimmed felt hat almost as tall as he is, has a scraggly mustache and a pair of tattered, poorly patched overalls. He constantly cheats at poker and checkers. He also has some proclivity toward stealing chickens, which led to a brief but effective use of his character in a marketing campaign by the Tyson Foods corporation in the early 1980s. In 1937, he held the post of &quot;Royal Doodle Bug&quot; in the &quot;Varmints&quot; lodge; during this period, the strip heavily employed the catchphrase, &quot;What did the Doodle-Bug say?&quot;, an apparent homage to &quot;What did the Woggle-Bug say?&quot; in L. Frank Baum and Walt McDougall&#x27;s &quot;Queer Visitors from the Marvelous Land of Oz&quot; strip of 1904–1905.

Almost all of the characters in the strip (except the infrequently seen Barney Google and the occasional visiting &quot;flatlander&quot;) are exaggerated hillbillies in the classic burlesque tradition: sharp-tongued gossipy women such as Snuffy&#x27;s wife Loweezy; his baby Tater; his mischievous nephew Jughaid; his neighbors Elviney and Lukey (Lucas Ebenezer Hinks); the sanctimonious (but nonetheless ungrammatical) Parson; Silas, the ever-parsimonious owner of the General Store; the ostentatiously-badged Sheriff Tait, and others. Vehicles are rundown jalopies of a seeming 1920s vintage, even in the 1970s and beyond. The characters are drawn so that they appear to be talking out of the sides of their mouths.

==Topper strips==

===&quot;Bughouse Fables&quot;===
On December 24, 1920, DeBeck began a gag panel called &quot;Bughouse Fables&quot;, featuring his observations of ordinary people doing foolish things, which he signed &quot;Barney Google&quot;. This daily panel ran until November 13, 1937. DeBeck added &quot;Bughouse Fables&quot; as an accompanying topper strip to run with &quot;Barney Google&quot; on Sundays, from January 17 to May 9, 1926.

===&quot;Bunky&quot;===
On May 16, 1926, DeBeck began another topper strip, originally called &quot;Parlor, Bedroom and Sink&quot;—but better known as &quot;Bunky&quot;. &quot;Parlor Bedroom and Sink&quot;—which evolved into &quot;Parlor Bedroom and Sink Starring Bunky&quot;, and eventually simply &quot;Bunky&quot;—is an over-the-top parody of stage melodramas and movie and radio serials that were popular at the time. The title character &quot;&quot; (short for Bunker Hill Jr.) was a hapless waif whose penniless parents, Bunker Hill Sr., and Bibsy, had given birth to the strangely erudite newborn with the enormous nose on November 13, 1927. The irresponsible Bunker Sr. eventually disappeared from the strip. From then on, pint-sized Bunky (still dressed in the baby bonnet and gown in which he was first seen) was the star, protector, and benefactor of the family. His vocabulary rivaled that of any educated adult.

Arch-nemesis Fagin, introduced in 1928, was as vile and despicable a villain as any Charles Dickens antagonist. He &quot;would steal pennies from a blind man&#x27;s cup and kick dogs that weren&#x27;t even in his way. Robbing widows and orphans ... was routine for him&quot;, according to comics historian Don Markstein, who said the strip popularized the phrase, &quot;Youse is a viper!&quot;

Fantasy author and &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; creator Robert E. Howard, a big fan of &quot;Bunky&quot;, was fond of quoting from the strip, as noted by his friend, Tevis Clyde Smith. After DeBeck&#x27;s death in 1942, &quot;Bunky&quot; continued for a time under Joe Musial (&quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;) and Fred Lasswell. The series ended on July 18, 1948.

===Other toppers===
Other toppers featured above &quot;Barney Google&quot; included: &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; (1932), &quot;Youse Is a Viper&quot; (May 15, 1932 - Aug 19, 1934), &quot;I Learnt This Trick from the Prince&quot; (Aug 12-Sept 2, 1934), &quot;Knee-Hi-Knoodles&quot; (Sept 9, 1934 - June 23, 1935), &quot;Hill-Billy Ba-Looney&quot; (Sept 15-Dec 8, 1935), &quot;What Did the Doodle Bug Say?&quot; (April 11–25, 1937) and &quot;Write a Caption for This Cartoon&quot; (Sept 11-Oct 9, 1938).

==Fred Lasswell==
When &quot;Barney Google&quot; began to lose popularity during the Great Depression, DeBeck introduced a simpler style through artist Fred Lasswell after seeing a poster by Lasswell, then in high school, at a golf tournament at Palma Ceia Country Club in Tampa, Florida. Lasswell, who drew cartoons and posters at the McCarthy Ad Agency and for the &quot;Tampa Daily Times&quot;, was brought in to create the Snuffy characters, which by 1934, surpassed Barney Google in popularity.

Lasswell took over the strip, now named &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot; after DeBeck died in 1942. In 1944 and 1945, Lasswell began featuring Snuffy in guest appearances in Laswell&#x27;s own &quot;Sargent Hashmark&quot; comic strip that appeared in the U.S. Marines&#x27; &quot;Leatherneck Magazine&quot;. After the war, Lasswell gained steady increases in distribution, with the strip eventually appearing in more than 1,000 newspapers throughout the world.

In 1962, Lasswell received the Silver Lady Award, and two years later won the Reuben Award and the Best Humor Strip Award from the National Cartoonist&#x27;s Society. In both 1984 and 1994, he won the Elzie Segar Award, being the only cartoonist who received this award more than once.

Lasswell died in 2001, 16 weeks ahead on the strip, leaving a digital archive containing 35,000 original comic panels and sketches, including over 20,000 daily and 4,000 Sunday strips and about 24,000 original gags.

==John R. Rose==
In mid-1998, editorial cartoonist John R. Rose began as Lasswell&#x27;s inking assistant, and he became the strip&#x27;s cartoonist after Lasswell&#x27;s death. In addition to being the artist on the strip, Rose was the editorial cartoonist from 1988 to 2020 for Byrd Newspapers of Virginia, later bought by Ogden Newspapers and he creates &quot;Kids&#x27; Home Newspaper&quot;, a weekly syndicated puzzle feature for Creators Syndicate. His books include &quot;The Bodacious Best of Snuffy Smith&quot; (2013), &quot;Balls of Fire! More Snuffy Smith Comics&quot; (2016), and &quot;Snuffy Smith In His Sunday Best&quot; (2018) and &quot;Barney Google And Snuffy Smith Turn 100! The Bodacious Digital Collection&quot; (2024) Published by King Features . Rose is credited with restoring Barney Google as a semiregular character beginning in 2012. In 2015, Rose was presented the Lum and Abner Memorial Award by the National Lum and Abner Society for his contributions to rural humor. In September 2017, Rose was honored with an award at Walt Disney&#x27;s Hometown Toonfest in Marceline, Missouri, for his contributions to cartooning. John Rose was awarded First Place from the Tennessee Press Association in 2018 for Best Use Of Humor In An Ad for a series wildfire prevention public service newspaper ads featuring Snuffy Smith. He created these &quot;Snuff Out Wildfires Before They Start&quot; ads for the &quot;Knoxville News-Sentinel&quot; and the Tennessee Press Association after devastating wildfires hit eastern Tennessee. In June 2019, Rose featured Barney Google in a special 100th-birthday series that lasted several weeks. Barney got lost in the funny papers trying to find Hootin&#x27; Holler and ended up visiting Dagwood, Popeye, Beetle Bailey, and more on his way to a birthday party that featured many characters from &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith&quot; who had not been seen in decades, as well as tribute panels to cartoonists Billy DeBeck and Fred Lasswell. In August 2021 Rose was awarded the Jack Davis Award for South East Cartoonist Of The Year by the South East Chapter Of The National Cartoonists Society. Rose created a special weeklong storyline in the comic strip which began on July 17, 2022 celebrating Spark Plug&#x27;s 100th birthday.

==Legacy==
DeBeck, who had a gift for coining colorful terms, is credited with introducing several Jazz Age slang words and phrases into the English language—including &quot;sweet mama&quot;, &quot;horsefeathers&quot;, &quot;heebie-jeebies&quot;, &quot;hotsy-totsy&quot;, and &quot;Who has seen the doodle bug?&quot; Snuffy&#x27;s catchphrases &quot;great balls o&#x27; fire&quot; and &quot;time&#x27;s a-wastin&#x27;&quot; remain popular to this day.

In DeBeck&#x27;s memory, the National Cartoonists Society in 1946 introduced the Billy DeBeck Award. (Eight years later, the name was changed to the Reuben Award after Rube Goldberg.) In 1963, Lasswell won both the NCS Humor Comic Strip Award and Reuben Award. That same year, he won the society&#x27;s plaque for Best Humor Strip. In 1984, the society gave him its Elzie Segar Award (named after the creator of &quot;Popeye&quot;) for outstanding contributions to his profession.

&quot;Snuffy Smith&quot; currently appears in 21 countries and 11 languages. In 1995, the strip was honored by the U.S. Postal Service; it was one of 20 included in the Comic Strip Classics series of commemorative USPS postage stamps.

==Licensing==
Snuffy Smith makes a brief appearance in Clifford D. Simak&#x27;s novel &quot;Out of Their Minds&quot;.

===Toys and merchandise===

Spark Plug captured the nation&#x27;s hearts and imagination during the 1920s, and became a merchandising bonanza for King Features and Billy DeBeck. &quot;Spark Plug, I am happy to say, has caught on,&quot; wrote DeBeck in 1924. &quot;All over the United States you find stuffed Spark Plugs and Spark Plug games and Spark Plug drums and Spark Plug balloons and Spark Plug tin pails. And there is a Spark Plug play on the road. The only thing that is lacking is a Spark Plug grand opera.&quot; (Source: &quot;Barney Google and Snuffy Smith: 75 Years of an American Legend&quot;, page 35).
During the mid-1950s, the Louis Marx Toy Company sold four vinyl character figures, two-and-a-half-to-three inches tall, representing Snuffy Smith, Loweezie, Jug Haid and Sut Tattersail. (Illustrated at http://www.marxwildwest.com/cartoons%20-%20non-disney.html). In 1960, King Features made plans to have Snuffy Smith serving hot dogs and chili at Snuffy&#x27;s Shantys [sic] across the country, the plan of a Columbus, Georgia, franchiser who had hoped to have 700 shanties operating by 1970.

In July 2004, Dark Horse Comics issued a limited-edition figure of Barney Google in a colorful collector tin as statue number 47 in their line of Classic Comic Character figures.

In November 2021, Comics Kingdom began selling tee shirts in their online shop featuring Spark Plug&#x27;s grandson, Li&#x27;l Sparky.

In July 2022, Comics Kingdom began selling tee shirts in their online shop celebrating Spark Plug&#x27;s 100th birthday.

In July 2023, Comics Kingdom began selling Snuffy Smith red, white and blue trucker caps in their online shop.

===Comic books===
Barney Google and Snuffy Smith each had a spotty history in comic books, starting with the first issue of David McKay&#x27;s &quot;Ace Comics&quot; (1937). They appeared in their own comics as well—three issues from Dell Comics in the 1940s, four from Toby Press in the 1950s, one from Gold Key Comics in the 1960s, and six from Charlton Comics in the 1970s. In December, 2015, &quot;Snuffy Smith&quot; returned to comic books. John Rose wrote and illustrated the comic book story &quot;Hopalong Jughaid&quot; for Charlton Spotlight #9.

Diminutive actor Bud Duncan portrayed Snuffy in both films, with Cliff Nazarro appearing as Barney in &quot;Hillbilly Blitzkrieg&quot;. (Both films also feature former Keystone Cop Edgar Kennedy and future Mouseketeer Jimmie Dodd in supporting roles.)

The opening credits included a catchy theme song that was specifically composed for the cartoon:
:&quot;Uh-uh-oh! Great balls o&#x27; fire, I&#x27;m bodacious!&quot;
:&quot;Uh-uh-oh! Great balls o&#x27; fire, I&#x27;m a fright!&quot;
:&quot;Uh-uh-oh! Great balls o&#x27; fire, goodness gracious!&quot;
:&quot;I&#x27;m chop-chop-chop-chop-choppin&#x27; with all o&#x27; my might—YEA!&quot;

Other King Features properties, such as &quot;Beetle Bailey&quot; and &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, also appeared as rotating segments under the collective title: &quot;King Features Trilogy&quot;. The series was widely shown in TV syndication (although &quot;Snuffy&#x27;s Song&quot;, &quot;The Hat&quot;, &quot;The Method and Maw&quot;, and &quot;Take Me to Your Gen&#x27;rul&quot; were released theatrically), with prolific voice actor Paul Frees providing the voices of both Snuffy and Barney.

<doc id="915127" wikidata="Q3285061" url="?curid=915127" title="Size Matters">
<text>Size Matters is the fifth album by the American alternative metal band Helmet, released in 2004 on Interscope Records. It is the first new album since the band ended with a bitter break-up in 1998, and it is also their final album to be released through Interscope.

==Background==
Page Hamilton, the band&#x27;s founder and chief songwriter, is the only original member appearing on the album. Therefore, some fans object to it being called &quot;Helmet&quot; and consider it to be a Page Hamilton solo project. According to Hamilton, founding members John Stanier (drums) and Henry Bogdan (bass) both declined the invitation to reunite. Stanier even publicly criticized Hamilton and the new Helmet in 2004.

Despite any objections, the album carries on in the Helmet tradition with Hamilton&#x27;s trademark staccato sound. Hamilton said to &quot;Deseret News&quot; in October 2004, &quot;I can see why John is upset. There are some people who feel that only the original lineup can constitute a group. But then there are others who don&#x27;t care. What I&#x27;m more concerned with is the fact that the music is good.&quot; He further added, &quot;I&#x27;m not trying to pull the wool over anyone&#x27;s eyes. This is a new Helmet.&quot;

The album was recorded as a three-piece with ex-White Zombie drummer John Tempesta and Chris Traynor (guitarist on the &quot;Aftertaste&quot; tour) on bass. After recording was done, Anthrax bassist Frank Bello was brought in so Traynor could return to guitar for live performances. Bello is included in promotional images from the &quot;Size Matters&quot; era, and several reviewers mistakenly claimed that he performed on the album. Unlike with previous Helmet albums, &quot;Size Matters&quot; was made with the assistance of digital editing software Pro Tools.

== Composition ==
=== Music and lyrics ===
Many of the album&#x27;s lyrics were inspired by Hamilton&#x27;s year long relationship with actress Winona Ryder in 2003. Hamilton has since commented that Ryder was a fan of Helmet and that she has heard the album, saying in 2007 that she didn&#x27;t like their next album &quot;Monochrome&quot; because &quot;it didn’t sound like her favorite song on &quot;Aftertaste&quot;, or her favorite song on even &quot;Size Matters&quot;.&quot; &quot;Smart&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Opportunity&quot;), &quot;Enemies&quot; and &quot;Unwound&quot;, were originally recorded as Gandhi tracks, Page Hamilton&#x27;s previous band.

===Artwork===
The album cover features a black and white photo of a young girl holding a magnifying glass. The photo was taken by Frances Murray. Regarding the cover, Page Hamilton said in a 2005 interview, &quot;the initial attraction was that it was a beautiful photo, this sort of innocence and open mindedness that kids have about things. She&#x27;s got a magnifying glass up to her eye so you can see her eyeball enlarged. Kids I believe start out with a natural inquisitiveness and a natural open mindedness, and they will do the right thing. Eventually if we continue to fill them full of shit they will be swayed.&quot;

== Release ==
The album was scheduled to be released on September 14, 2004, but was pushed back to October 5 after Hamilton broke his collarbone in a mountain biking accident, delaying the band&#x27;s touring schedule that was supposed to begin three days after the planned release.

The album debuted at #121 on the Billboard 200, selling 9,723 copies in its first week. &quot;Size Matters&quot; had two singles; &quot;See You Dead&quot; and &quot;Unwound&quot;. The track &quot;Throwing Punches&quot; was also included on the film soundtrack for &quot;Underworld&quot;, and &quot;Crashing Foreign Cars&quot; was featured in the video game &quot;Need for Speed: Underground 2&quot;.

== Critical reception ==

&quot;Size Matters&quot; was met with &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, it received an average score of 52 based on eight reviews. At &quot;Pitchfork&quot; writer David Raposa gave the album a mixed review. He criticized the band&#x27;s change in sound writing, &quot;Helmet attempt to diversify their portfolio, offering dynamics and approachable melodies and other types of listener-friendly capitulations one wouldn&#x27;t associate with the folks that dropped &quot;Meantime&quot; and &#x27;Unsung&#x27;.&quot;

Johnny Loftus of AllMusic gave the album 3 stars and wrote in his review, &quot;&quot;Size Matters&quot; emphasizes for the bloated alt-metal elite what it means to have craft and a little self-control. It isn&#x27;t necessarily memorable, but as an exercise in measured, even artistic rage, it&#x27;s classic Hamilton.&quot; Josh Zanger of &quot;LAS Magazine&quot; explained, &quot;&quot;Size Matters&quot; seems to come up a little short in certain areas though. The overall sound is a bit too polished and loses some of the raw power edge that previous albums rode to critical success. This slickness also makes the weaker songs forgettable and bland, and a few of the choruses are forced into overextensions. At times, elated melodies contradict the darker pounding force of previously established riffs and sound like unnatural ideas that never fully blossomed.&quot; In Music We Trust also noted the more polished sound, in addition to the lineup changes, stating in their review, &quot;Page Hamilton has embarked on a comeback with &quot;Size Matters&quot;, but, like Dave Mustaine, he keeps the band name yet changes the entire lineup sans himself. Armed with Frank Bello (Anthrax), John Tempesta (White Zombie), and Chris Traynor (Orange 9mm), the &#x27;04 Helmet lineup reads like the New York Metal All-Star team.&quot;

In a review with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Christian Hoarde gave the release 2 stars out of 5, explaining, &quot;On their first disc in seven years, the manicured riffs remain, but the sludge is so overbearing that anyone born during the Eighties will wonder what once made them special.&quot; &quot;Scene Point Blank&quot; wrote in their November 2004 review that, &quot;On one hand, we have songs such as &#x27;Smart&#x27;, &#x27;Everybody Loves You&#x27;, and &#x27;Throwing Punches&#x27;. These songs find Hamilton utilizing his &#x27;red-neck truck driver&#x27; voice. Musically, these songs feature the more aggressive riffs and fast-paced drumming that rekindle thoughts of Helmet material found on &quot;Strap it On&quot;. On the other hand, we have &#x27;Crashing Foreign Cars&#x27; and &#x27;Unwound&#x27; that feature the softer and more accessible Hamilton. As a whole, these types of songs are much more prevalent on &quot;Size Matters&quot;.&quot; They concluded their review by stating, &quot;while it&#x27;s nice to have a solid rock band like Helmet around again, the cohesion from albums like &quot;Meantime&quot; and &quot;Betty&quot; is lacking on this latest effort. But despite the sub par return endeavor, Helmet still executes alternative metal superior to that of the &#x27;nu-metal&#x27; parade that they involuntarily influenced.&quot;

===Legacy===
In 2011, &quot;Decibel Magazine&quot; gave the album a critical reappraisal, and claimed &quot;&quot;Size Matters&quot; was not only a more cohesive and confident return from the break-up than some of their contemporaries (looking at you, Prong, [and] lame-o supergroups), but also offered some killer live shows with Frank Bello on bass. It was and is a natural sequel to &quot;Aftertaste&quot; and a valiant fuck-you to the emo foppishness and Maidenesque fret-wankery that was invading metal at the time, despite it sharing emo’s preoccupation about women ruining your life.&quot;

Shortly after the release of their eight album &quot;Dead to the World&quot;, Page Hamilton reflected in an interview, &quot;I would say that I like the first four albums best, &quot;Strap It On&quot; (1990) &quot;Meantime&quot; (1992), &quot;Betty&quot; (1994) and &quot;Aftertaste&quot; (1997), because they were created with the original line-up in a natural way. I still like those albums a lot. The comeback album, &quot;Size Matters&quot;, was also a great experience for me, but we had a lot of pressure on us because it was the first Helmet album after eight years.&quot;

Frank Bello has since spoken positively of his brief stint with Helmet. In a 2014 interview with &quot;Louder Sound&quot;, Bello reflected, &quot;I went to go jam with Helmet for a year and a half of fucking the best fun. Page Hamilton, John Tempesta and Chris Traynor, we had a ball. Great musicians in that group — absolutely great musicians. And you know what? I think it made me a better bass player. It made me dig in with a pick, and it was a different form of playing for me. And I really enjoyed it.&quot;

Norma Jean vocalist Cory Brandon picked &quot;See You Dead&quot; and &quot;Throwing Punches&quot; as among the ten best Helmet songs in an article written for &quot;Louder Sound&quot; in 2017.

<text>Michael Howard Finley (born March 6, 1973) is an American former professional basketball player who is the assistant general manager and vice president of player personnel for the Dallas Mavericks of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played 15 seasons in the NBA, predominantly with the Mavericks, but also for the Phoenix Suns (who drafted him in 1995), the San Antonio Spurs, and the Boston Celtics. He was a two-time NBA All-Star and won an NBA championship with the Spurs in 2007.

==Early life==
Finley attended Proviso East High School in Maywood, Illinois, graduating in 1991. In Finley&#x27;s senior season, Proviso East won the 1991 IHSA class AA boys basketball tournament, and Finley was named to the all-tournament team. Finley&#x27;s teammates, known collectively as the &quot;Three Amigos&quot;, included future NBA draftees Sherrell Ford and Donnie Boyce. In response to winning the state championship, Finley was invited to travel to Deerfield, Illinois, where he played against Michael Jordan in a game of H-O-R-S-E and a 1-on-1 game to three points. Jordan H-O-R-S-E and won the game of 1-on-1 three to one. Both games were recorded and broadcast on a sporting chance segment for WBBM CBS Chicago.

In 2007, Finley was voted one of the &quot;100 Legends of the IHSA Boys Basketball Tournament&quot;.

==College career==
The 6&#x27; 7&quot; shooting guard/small forward was originally drafted out of University of Wisconsin–Madison by the Phoenix Suns as the 21st overall pick of the 1995 NBA draft. Finley held the all-time scoring record at Wisconsin for eleven years before being passed by Alando Tucker on March 10, 2007.

==NBA career==

===Phoenix Suns (1995–1996)===
Finley was named to the 1995–96 NBA All-Rookie First Team and finished third in Rookie of the Year voting after averaging fifteen points, 4.6 rebounds and 3.5 assists per game. He became only the third rookie in Suns history to score over 1,000 points in a season. Despite playing all 82 games in his rookie season, Finley was injured on the final day of regular season and did not play in the playoffs. He was traded by the Suns on December 26, 1996 to the Dallas Mavericks along with Sam Cassell, A.C. Green and a second-round draft pick for Jason Kidd, Tony Dumas and Loren Meyer.
===Dallas Mavericks (1996–2005)===
Finley flourished in Dallas. In his first season with the Mavericks, Finley led the team in scoring, assists and steals. Along with point guard Steve Nash and forward Dirk Nowitzki, he became an integral part of the Mavericks&#x27; late &#x27;90s &quot;run and gun&quot; offense.

In 2000, he was selected to represent the Western Conference in the 2000 All-Star Game, in which he scored eleven points. On January 23, 2001, Finley tied an NBA record by recording eight steals in one half of a game. In 2001, he was again selected to represent the Western Conference on All-Star weekend. He played for the US national team in the 2002 FIBA World Championship, which lost a record-three games and failed to win a championship for the first time in a major competition since FIBA opened international competitions to NBA players.

While Finley began to play more of a supporting role (small forward) as he aged and teammate Dirk Nowitzki blossomed, he remained a clutch player for the Mavericks. In 2005, he was waived by Dallas to avoid luxury taxes (as part of the league&#x27;s new labor agreement). Finley became an unrestricted free agent and after being pursued by Detroit, Miami, Minnesota, and Phoenix, he elected to remain in Texas with the San Antonio Spurs.

===San Antonio Spurs (2005–2010)===

In San Antonio, Finley adapted well to a secondary role as Manu Ginóbili&#x27;s backup, developing and emphasizing his outside shooting. The Spurs would face Finley&#x27;s former team the Mavericks in the second round of the 2006 NBA playoffs. In Game 5 of the series, Finley was punched by former teammate Jason Terry, earning Terry a suspension for the next game of the series and irritating Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. The Spurs would force a seventh game after facing a 3–1 deficit, but ultimately fell to the Mavericks in overtime.

In the fifth and final game of San Antonio&#x27;s first-round series against Denver in 2007, Finley set the Spurs&#x27; record for three-point field goals in a playoff game, making eight of nine attempts. He eclipsed the previous record of seven set by teammate Bruce Bowen in 2003. Finley won his only NBA championship in 2007 with the San Antonio Spurs in his 12th NBA season.

At Finley&#x27;s request, the Spurs bought out the final year of his contract and waived him on March 1, 2010, freeing him to sign with another team.

===Boston Celtics (2010)===
On March 4, 2010, Finley reached a verbal agreement with the Boston Celtics to join the team for the remainder of the 2009–10 season. He signed with the Celtics on March 6, 2010. The Celtics reached the 2010 NBA Finals, but lost to the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers in seven games. At the end of the season, Finley announced he would retire.

==Personal life==
Finley began playing basketball in elementary school. His favorite player was Michael Jordan and he would occasionally go to Chicago Bulls games. He majored in business management at Wisconsin. Although he did not graduate at the time due to the NBA draft, he completed his bachelor&#x27;s degree in 2014 in agricultural and applied economics at Wisconsin. Finley attended the same high school as Milwaukee Bucks head coach Doc Rivers.

==Other work==
=== Basketball ===
He works in the front office as the Vice President of Basketball Operations for the Dallas Mavericks.

=== Film ===
Finley was one of the producers of the films &quot;Lee Daniels&#x27; The Butler&quot; and &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;.

<text>Bayfordbury, Hertfordshire, is a large Grade II* listed country house with surrounding parkland, and the location of a University of Hertfordshire campus, housing its biology/geography field station and observatory.

==History of Bayfordbury==
Bayfordbury House was originally built between 1759 and 1762 for well-to-do London merchant Sir William Baker. It was upgraded to its present appearance by his son, also William Baker between 1809 and 1812. After the death of Admiral Sir Lewis Clinton-Baker in 1940, the estate was leased to the Dr Barnardo&#x27;s charity.

The 372-acre Bayfordbury estate was then bought by the John Innes Centre in 1948 and developed into a School of Cytology. A new Cell Biology building was built in 1959, later to become the Science Learning Centre. In 1967 the John Innes Centre moved to its present site in Norwich and the Bayfordbury estate was bought by the Hertfordshire Council in 1967 for the use of Hatfield Polytechnic.

== Bayfordbury Observatory ==


In 1969 the Bayfordbury Observatory was established within the grounds of the house by Hatfield Polytechnic (now the University of Hertfordshire). This is the university&#x27;s astronomical and atmospheric physics remote sensing observatory, one of the largest teaching astronomical observatories in the UK.

== Science Learning Centre ==
In 2005 the Regional Science Learning Centre was set up at Bayfordbury to run courses that provided continuing professional development for anyone involved in the teaching of science.
The Science Learning Centre had close ties with the nearby observatory and hosted activities during its astronomy open evenings such as planetarium shows and talks. The building also hosted some of the observatory&#x27;s scientific instruments on its roof.

== Field station ==
The University of Hertfordshire uses the site as its biology and geography field station. The university owns a number of Bayfordbury&#x27;s woodlands and meadows including the Clinton-Baker Pinetum, Sailor&#x27;s Grove and Hook&#x27;s Grove.
The lake at Bayfordbury was created by the Baker family in 1772 and is now managed for its newts, crayfish and pure genetic stock of Crucian carp.
The site also houses five large glasshouses, used for plant and aquatic research.

== Clinton-Baker Pinetum ==
The Clinton-Baker Pinetum is a 10-acre pinetum containing over 150 species of conifers from all over the world, many over 100 years old. The first conifers were planted in 1767 by Sir William Baker, the original owner of the mansion.

<doc id="915140" wikidata="Q7576807" url="?curid=915140" title="Sphinx (senior society)">
<text>The Sphinx is a collegiate senior society at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. Founded in 1885, it is the oldest of the fourteen official senior societies at the college.

==History==

The Sphinx was founded as a senior-class society in 1885 by fourteen male students of the class of 1886.
The senior members of the Sphinx continue to select a small number of male students of the junior class during Winter Carnival Weekend in a process known as &quot;tapping.&quot; Traditionally selecting 24 members per year, the delegation often is referred to as &quot;twenty-fours.&quot; 

The Sphinx originally published the names of its members in the annual &quot;Aegis&quot;, but the society has become more secretive in recent years. The identities of the members are now kept secret until Commencement when graduating members carry identifying canes.

== Tomb ==
The Sphinx Tomb, constructed in 1903 on East Wheelock Street, was designed by Manchester architect William M. Butterfield and reflects the Egyptian Revival architectural style popular during the mid-nineteenth century. In 1923, a significant addition was planned for the tomb; however, the proposed addition was never constructed. Instead, a smaller rear addition was constructed in 1926. The interior of the Sphinx was replaced after a fire started in the building&#x27;s furnace destroyed it in 1929. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

== Misconduct and scandals ==
The Sphinx attracted negative publicity in 1989 when thefts that took place during a scavenger hunt were traced back to the secret society. On April 27, 1989, 16 students took part in a scavenger hunt that resulted in the theft of numerous items across the Dartmouth campus, including paintings, photographs, mailboxes, life preservers, and signs. The school estimated the total value of missing items at nearly $12,000. The school demanded that all items be returned undamaged within 24 hours, in which case it would not investigate further. Most items were returned but as several were still missing, an investigation was launched, which revealed that the Sphinx was responsible for the scavenger hunt. Dartmouth revoked recognition of the Sphinx for one year, fined the organization $3,000 plus the cost of damages to the stolen items, and punished the members involved with probation or suspension.

In 2003, an unsuccessful illegal break-in was attempted by two unidentified males.

<doc id="915143" wikidata="Q790599" url="?curid=915143" title="Average revenue per user">
<text>Average revenue per user (ARPU), sometimes known as average revenue per unit, is a measure used primarily by consumer communications, digital media, and networking companies, defined as the total revenue divided by the number of subscribers.

The term is used by companies that offer subscription services to clients for example, telephone carriers, Internet service providers, and hosts. It is a measure of the revenue generated by one customer phone, pager, etc., per unit time, typically per year or month. In mobile telephony, ARPU includes not only the revenues billed to the customer each month for usage but also the revenue generated from incoming calls, payable within the regulatory interconnection regime.

Digital media and social media companies, which often rely on advertising revenue generated by users with free accounts, pay particularly close attention to their ARPU. Variations in ARPU reflect changes in the companies&#x27; ability to generate revenue and heavily impact their stock prices. That provides the company a granular view at a per user or unit basis and allows it to track revenue sources and growth. ARPU is also used in the video game industry for games that support microtransactions or are offered as games as a service, as similarly, the bulk of revenue in such games comes from a small percentage of the overall population. 

There is a trend by telecommunications and Internet companies and their suppliers to sell extra services to users and a lot of the promotion that is used by the companies talks of increased ARPU for the operators. It typically manifests in the form of value-added services such as entertainment being sold to customers especially in markets where the primary service offered to the customer, such as the telephony or Internet service, is sold at a commodity rate.

== Calculation ==
To calculate ARPU, a standard time period must be defined. Most telecommunications carriers operate by the month. The total revenue generated by all units (paying subscribers or communications devices) during that period is determined. Then that figure is divided by the number of units. Because the number of units can vary from day to day, the average number of units must be calculated or estimated for a given month to obtain the most accurate possible ARPU figure for that month.

Also related is the ARPPU (Average Revenue Per Paying User), which is calculated by dividing up the revenue amongst the users who paid anything at all. That yields a figure that is significantly larger than ARPU. For example, in the case of a subscription game that has a free to play version, the ARPPU, measured by accounts, is the subscription price, diluted slightly by free trials.

A related measure is the ARPDAU (Average Revenue Per Daily Active User). Other common measure is ARPC (Average Revenue Per Customer), some customers generate higher revenue than other because these customer contract more telecommunications services or generate more use than other customers and so these customer have a higher ARPC, than others customers for the same telecommunication company.

Average margin per user (AMPU) is another criterion for measuring the success of telephone companies. The central premise is that by attention to the margin produced per sold unit, not the amount of cash (revenue) earned from each customer, one can afford low volumes and still have a healthy company. High volumes can also bring a significant edge until competition forces prices down. Telecom analysts is traditionally highly focused on ARPU because the typical telco has had huge infrastructure costs that needs to be serviced by a considerable ARPU.
Another use of &quot;AMPU&quot; in some telephone companies (in particular Telenor) is Average Minutes Per User, meaning the amount of time (measured in minutes) the average subscriber talks (or listens) in their phones. That is also called Minutes-Of-Use or MOU.

ARPU is widely used by Internet Protocol television (IPTV) service providers.

<text>George Lerner (1922–1995) was an American inventor known for inventing the toy Mr. Potato Head.

==Biography==
Lerner was born in Brooklyn, New York and worked during his lifetime as an artist, graphic designer, and model maker. In 1949, he designed and produced a first generation set of plastic face pieces. The push pin shaped noses, ears, eyes, and mouth parts could be pushed into fruits or vegetables to transform the food into playmates. The toy did not take off at first because post-World War II consumers didn&#x27;t like the idea of wasting food by playing with it. Lerner finally sold the toy for $5,000 to a cereal company. The toys were planned to be a premium giveaway in cereal boxes. But when Lerner found a better deal offered by toy manufacturer Hassenfeld Brothers (now Hasbro), Lerner and the manufacturer bought the rights back for $7,000. Hasbro officially named the toy Mr. Potato Head.

In 1964 and 1975, George Lerner&#x27;s original designs got their plastic head and size upgrades respectively, in order to comply with government issued safety regulations.

Lerner died in 1995.

==Personal life==
Lerner was Jewish, and was of Romanian-Jewish descent.

<text>Chunhyang () is a 2000 South Korean period romantic drama film directed by Im Kwon-taek, with a screenplay by Kang Hye-yeon and Kim Myung-gon. Distributed by CJ Entertainment, the film was released on January 29, 2000 in South Korea. Lee Hyo-jeong plays Chunhyang and Cho Seung-woo plays Mongryong.

It is a film adaptation of the &quot;pansori&quot; Chunhyangga, one of the most notable works in the pansori tradition. To date, there have been more than sixteen works based on this narrative, including three North Korean films. Im Kwon-taek&#x27;s &quot;Chunhyang&quot; presents a new interpretation of this oral tradition with a focus towards a more global audience. It is the first Chunhyang adaptation that uses lyrics of pansori as a major part of the screenplay. The film uses the framing device of a present-day pansori narrator who, accompanied by a drummer, sings the story of Chunhyang in front of a responsive audience. The film flashes back and forth between the singer&#x27;s presentation and scenes of Mongryong.

It was entered into the 2000 Cannes Film Festival. The film is the first Korean film which was presented at the 2000 Telluride Film Festival. At the 2000 Asia Pacific Film Festival, it won a Special Jury Award. It also won an award for Best Narrative at the Hawaii International Film Festival in 2000.

The film is told through pansori, a traditional Korean form of storytelling that narrates through song. It is based on &quot;Chunhyangga&quot;, a traditional Korean folktale, and is set in 18th century Korea.

Lee Mongryong, a governor&#x27;s son living in Namwon falls in love and marries Chunhyang Sung, the daughter of a courtesan. Their marriage is kept a secret from his father who would disown Lee if he found out that he had married beneath him. The governor is posted to Seoul and so Mongryong has to leave his wife behind, promising to return for her when he passes the official exam.

After Mongryong and his father leaves, the new governor, Byun Hakdo, desires Chunhyang. When she refuses, stating that she is married and will remain faithful, the governor punishes her by flogging. Meanwhile, in Seoul, Lee passes the exam with the top score and becomes an officer. After three years, Mongryong returns to the town on a King&#x27;s mission. There, he finds that his wife is to be beaten to death on the governor&#x27;s birthday as a punishment for rejecting him. Mongryong arrests the governor for his corruption and avarice. The two lovers are finally united.

==Cast==
*Lee Hyo-jeong - Chunhyang
*Cho Seung-woo - Mongryong
*Kim Sung-nyeo - Wolmae
*Lee Jung-hun - Governor Byun
*Kim Hak-yong - Bangja
*Choi Jin-young - Governor Lee
*Hong Kyung-yeun - kisaeng leader
*Cho Sang-hyun - pansori singer

*Lee Hae-ryong - Lord of Soonchun
*Gok Jun-hwam - Lord of Okgwa
*Yoon Keun-mo - Lord of Goksung
*Lee Hye-eun - Hyangdan

==Production==
The bed scene between Chunhyang and Mongryong took two days to film because Cho Seung-woo and Hyo-jeong Lee, who had no experience at all, were shy. The two of them didn&#x27;t know there was a love scene until they started filming, and they were scared, and director Im Kwon-taek gave them homework to come after seeing &#x27;Yellow Hair&#x27;.

==Critical reception==
According to Elvis Mitchell of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Instead the story is freshened through the use of a Korean singing storyteller, a pansori singer, to provide a narration, belting out the song from a stage in front of an audience. The pansori, or song, is performed under a proscenium arch to highlight the ritual elements of folk tales. Even though much of what the pansori tells us unfolds before the cameras at the same moment, the forcefulness of the performance lends another layer of feeling to the picture.&quot;

<text>Carl Harvey Greenblatt (born June 17, 1972) is an American animator and voice actor. He has worked on Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; and on Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; and &quot;Evil Con Carne&quot;. He is the creator of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Chowder&quot;, Nickelodeon&#x27;s &quot;Harvey Beaks&quot; and creator and executive producer of &quot;Jellystone!&quot;, an American animated series produced by Warner Bros. Animation for HBO Max based on Hanna-Barbera characters.

==Early life==
Greenblatt grew up in Plano, Texas. When he was in 6th grade, he made a comic called “Zibbler”. He attended the University of Texas at Austin where he majored in advertising. He worked as a cartoonist at the school’s newspaper alongside Korey Coleman.

==Career==
After graduating, Greenblatt worked as an art director on several television commercials, including Chef Boyardee&#x27;s &quot;Chef Jr.&quot; campaign. In 1998, he got his first job in the animation industry working as an additional storyboard artist for &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, before graduating to full-on writer and storyboard artist. From season 2 and 3 of &quot;SpongeBob&quot; he teamed up with Aaron Springer and later in season 3 he teamed up with Kaz. After finishing up on &quot;SpongeBob&quot;, Greenblatt became a storyboard artist on &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot;.

In 2007, Greenblatt began &quot;Chowder&quot;, an animated show that he created and executive produced for Cartoon Network. Greenblatt collaborated with Maxwell Atoms on his new &quot;Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; spin-off Halloween special called &quot;Underfist&quot;, in which he reprised his role as Fred Fredburger. He announced on his blog that Nickelodeon has given the go-ahead for an 11-minute pilot for a new show created by him entitled &quot;Bad Seeds&quot; (later renamed &quot;Harvey Beaks&quot;).

He announced in September 2013 that the show has since been picked up for 26 11-minute episodes, with production commencing at the beginning of 2014. He has also directed the &quot;Deadman&quot; shorts for DC Nation.

On April 5, 2018, Greenblatt announced that he had now been employed by Warner Bros. Animation, adding that he has been developing &quot;something fun&quot; for the studio but could not yet disclose anything else about it. On October 29, 2019, the project was officially unveiled under the title of &quot;Jellystone!&quot;, described as a crossover of several Hanna-Barbera characters living in the titular town &quot;where they can&#x27;t help but make trouble for one another&quot;.

Greenblatt also plays Fish Taco, one of three main characters in an animated YouTube series titled &quot;Mexiguin&quot; since 2018. He helps mentor show creator, Joe Kozdra, in animation and creative writing alongside his voice-acting contributions.

On January 29, 2021, a new Greenblatt project was registered for Disney Television Animation under the title &quot;Unnamed Pet Resort Project&quot;.

== Legacy ==
Scott Thill of &quot;Cartoon Brew&quot; praised Greenblatt as one of the most influential comedy writers with innovative comedic elements. &quot;Cartoon Brew&quot; also said Greenblatt &quot;has logged a decade-and-a-half across studios and shows&quot;. James Poniewozik of &quot;Time&quot; credited Greenblatt as defining &quot;SpongeBob&quot;″s comedic style. Greenblatt was a storyboard artist and one of the writers of the &quot;SpongeBob&quot; episode &quot;Band Geeks&quot;, considered by many to be the best episode of the entire series. &quot;SpongeBob&quot; writer Kaz recalled writing with Greenblatt fun and said he was full with &quot;weird energy&quot;.

<doc id="915152" wikidata="Q2559408" url="?curid=915152" title="If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem">
<text>If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem is a novel by the American author William Faulkner published in 1939. The novel was originally published under the title The Wild Palms, which is the title of one of the two interwoven stories. This title was chosen by the publishers, Random House, over the objections of Faulkner&#x27;s choice of a title. Subsequent editions have since been printed under the title &quot;If I Forget Thee Jerusalem&quot; (1990, following the &quot;corrected text&quot; and format of Noel Polk), and since 2003 it is now usually referred to by both names, with the newer title following the historically first published title and in brackets, to avoid confusion: The Wild Palms [If I Forget Thee, Jerusalem].

Like four other Faulkner novels (&quot;Soldiers&#x27; Pay&quot;, &quot;Mosquitoes&quot;, &quot;Pylon&quot; and &quot;A Fable&quot;), the novel is not set in his fictional Yoknapatawpha County.

==Plot==
The book consists of two different stories, told in non-linear fashion in alternating chapters, which contain both parallels and contrasts. 
&quot;Wild Palms&quot; starts in New Orleans in 1937 with Harry, an impoverished and virginal intern finishing his training in a hospital. At a party he meets Charlotte, who abandons her husband and two children to run away with him.

With little money and few employment prospects, they drift through Chicago to a cabin in Wisconsin and then a mine in Utah. There Charlotte falls pregnant and they decide to go to the Mississippi coast. When she dies after he tries an abortion, he is sentenced to 50 years&#x27; hard labor. Charlotte&#x27;s husband visits and slips him a cyanide pill. Harry ultimately refuses to take it. He tells himself, “Between grief and nothing I will take grief.”

&quot;Old Man&quot; starts on a prison farm in Mississippi in 1927, where a convict has served time since his early teens. When the river overflows its levees, he is ordered to take a skiff and rescue people from rooftops. He saves a woman in advanced pregnancy. The force of the current drives them downstream. He manages to land on a hillock, where the woman gives birth to her child. Later, an official motor boat appears, taking the skiff, convict, woman and baby to New Orleans. They sneak away, and the convict paddles the skiff against the current until he is able to leave the woman and baby near a place she knows. He carries on up to the prison, where 10 years are added to his sentence for escaping.

==Cultural allusions==
Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges translated the complete novel into Spanish as &quot;Las palmeras salvajes&quot; (1940). &quot;The Wild Palms&quot; is quoted in Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s 1959 film, &quot;Breathless&quot; (&quot;À bout de souffle&quot;), when Patricia claims to prefer to take &quot;grief rather than nothing&quot;; the same quote is cited in the 1986 John Hughes comedy &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, when Principal Rooney &quot;consoles&quot; Sloan while waiting in front of the school. It also appears in the movie &quot;Im Lauf der Zeit&quot;, 1976, by Wim Wenders, in which one of the protagonists, a truckdriver, is reading his paperback copy of the book every now and then, and in the movie &quot;Perfect Days&quot;, 2023, also by Wim Wenders. Agnès Varda claimed in her film &quot;The Beaches of Agnès&quot; that the structure of Faulkner&#x27;s novel directly inspired her first feature, &quot;La Pointe Courte&quot;. A copy of &quot;The Wild Palms&quot; appears on a bookshelf belonging to the protagonist in the 1999 movie &quot;Ghost Dog.&quot;

<doc id="915153" wikidata="Q799200" url="?curid=915153" title="Ebenezer Zane">
<text>Ebenezer Zane (October 7, 1747 – November 19, 1811) was an American pioneer, soldier, politician, road builder and land speculator. Born in the Colony of Virginia (possibly near what became Moorefield, West Virginia), Zane established a settlement near Fort Henry which became Wheeling (also in present-day West Virginia), on the Ohio River. He also blazed an early road through the Ohio Country to Limestone (now Maysville, Kentucky) known as Zane&#x27;s Trace.

== Family ==
Zane was one of six children born to William Andrew Zane and his wife, Nancy Ann Nolan (died 1764), who married at a Quaker meeting in Philadelphia in 1744 and soon emigrated from New Jersey to then vast Augusta County, Virginia. His ancestor Robert Zane had helped William Penn found Philadelphia. Ebenezer had four brothers: Silas (1745-1785), Andrew (born 1749), Jonathan (born about 1750), and Isaac (1751-1816), as well as one sister, Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; (born 1759). His uncle Isaac had remained in Philadelphia, became a wealthy carpenter, and financed his son, also Isaac, to go to western Virginia and join his relatives. Complicating matters, native Americans captured William Zane and several of his young sons after they had begun to farm along the south branch of the Potomac River, and although some were eventually taken to Detroit and ransomed, his son Isaac remained a captive of the Wyandot for more than a decade, married a native American, and would have Zanesfield, Ohio, named in his honor.

Zane married Elizabeth McColloch or McCullough (October 30, 1748 – 1814). They had eleven children, although several died as infants. Their first child was daughter Catherine (1769-1851), who married Absalom Martin (a government surveyor of the Seven Ranges who founded Martins Ferry, Ohio, where Zane and several family members would be buried); Sarah (1773-1851) first married John McIntire (who helped his father-in-law create the Zane Trace discussed below, then founded Zanesville, Ohio, as well as helped write the first Ohio Constitution). Noah (who like his father and cousin would serve in the Virginia General Assembly) was born October 25, 1778, and died in Wheeling in 1833. Rebecca (1776-1866) married John Clarke and became the longest lived sibling. Hester or Esther (1786-1854) married prominent politician Elijah Woods, who also helped write the Ohio Constitution. Daniel (1788-1860) became the longest living son, with his brother Jesse (b. 1790) dying young, and outliving John (1780-1805) as well as Samuel (1784-1854). He was an ancestor of author Zane Grey, who was born in Zanesville.

== From Dunmore&#x27;s War through the American Revolution ==

To the distress of many settlers in western Virginia, the British agreed in the 1763 treaty ending the conflict to prohibit further settlement west of the Appalachian divide. Despite the treaty ban, Zane and his brothers Silas and Jonathan headed west from Moorefield (on the south branch of the Potomac River east of the Appalachian divide) across the Appalachian Mountains to the Ohio River . At the conjunction of Wheeling Creek and the Ohio River, they began clearing land to farm, as well as established what later became Fort Henry in 1769. Initially, the fort constructed under the guidance of Major Angus McDonald to defend colonists against Native American raids was called &quot;Fort Fincastle,&quot; reflecting another title of Virginia governor Lord Dunmore. In 1774, Zane began his formal military career under British rule, as a disbursing officer during Dunmore&#x27;s War against Native Americans.

Zane later became a colonel in the Virginia militia and in 1776 renamed the fort after Patrick Henry, who as a Virginia legislator and governor defended the interests of western Virginians. During the American Revolutionary War, Zane&#x27;s elder brother Capt. Silas Zane and his siblings defended Fort Henry against several Native American attacks. The first Siege of Fort Henry occurred in September 1777. Another thwarted attack occurred in the summer of 1782. However, the most serious was the siege in September 1782. His sister Elizabeth became celebrated for her courage in leaving the fort to retrieve a badly needed keg of gunpowder and sprinting back safely under a hail of gunfire.

Meanwhile, his nephew Isaac Zane Jr. (1766-1839), also emigrated from the Philadelphia area to Virginia and became a leading citizen of Frederick County, Virginia, despite his Quaker faith, in part because his iron foundry which employed about 150 people and helped supply the westward trade.

Both Isaac Zane Jr. and Ebenezer Zane became politically active, and represented the interests of northwestern Virginia in the Virginia Revolutionary Conventions and later in the Virginia House of Delegates. Ohio County voters also elected Ebenezer Zane several times as one of their representatives in the Virginia House of Delegates, but the district briefly changed into Yohogenia County (with different boundaries in 1781-1782). In 1788, Ohio County voters also elected Ebenezer Zane as one of their delegates to the Virginia Ratifying Convention, where he and voted in favor of ratification of the United States Constitution. However, the 1799 election was very close, and a court challenge unseated Zane and Benjamin Biggs in favor of one of the incumbents, William McKinley and John Morgan.

== Building Zane&#x27;s Trace ==

Following the war, in May 1796, Zane obtained permission and funds from the United States Congress to build a road through the Northwest Territory. In exchange for his work (and that of his brother Jonathan, son-in-law John McIntyre and native guide Tomepomehala), Congress granted Zane three large tracts of land—where the road crossed the Muskingum, Hocking, and Scioto rivers. His assistants would receive the land which became Zanesville, and the others became Lancaster and opposite Chillicothe.

When Zane&#x27;s Trace was completed, it crossed what is now the state of Ohio from Wheeling, Virginia, to Maysville, Kentucky. Although the road was a rudimentary path and at first suitable only for travel by foot or horseback (not by wagon), the state of Ohio undertook improvements in the early 19th century. It was the only major road in Ohio until the War of 1812.

==Death and legacy==
Zane died in November 1811, and was buried in Martin&#x27;s Ferry, Ohio. Although Quakers by that time were forbidden to own slaves, Zane owned ten enslaved people in the 1810 census, and his will written the previous month gave his widow Elizabeth the choice of two slaves, among other provisions for her. Zane also divided his land in and near Wheeling (in Ohio County, Virginia, an Ohio River island and Belmont County, Ohio) among his sons Noah and Daniel, as well as finished his transfers to his son-in-law Jacob Burkett, and directed that his land in Fairfield County, Ohio, be sold and the proceeds held for the benefit of his daughters Rebecca Clark and Esther Woods, and with his son Samuel Zane receiving land in Wood County, Virginia, as well as Belmont County, Ohio. Elizabeth McCullough&#x27;s will manumitted the slaves she owned, and bequeathed the ferries that her family had established to sons Noah and Daniel. Zanesville, Ohio, was named in his honor.

<text>Leah Rabin (, née Schloßberg; 28 April 1928 – 12 November 2000) was the wife of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995.

==Biography==
Leah Rabin was born Leah Schloßberg in Königsberg, East Prussia, Germany (now Kaliningrad, Russia), to an upper-middle-class family of Russian-born parents. Immediately after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s election as Chancellor of Germany in 1933, Schloßberg emigrated with her family to Mandate Palestine. Her father had bought a piece of property near Binyamina on his first trip to the area in 1927. She met her future husband, Yitzhak Rabin, at school. They married in 1948, the year of Israel&#x27;s independence.

Her husband became Prime Minister in 1974 following Golda Meir&#x27;s resignation. In 1975, Leah Rabin attended to the World Conference on Women as the head of Israel&#x27;s representation. Princess Ashraf Pahlavi, twin sister of Iran&#x27;s Shah, Imelda Marcos, wife of Philippines&#x27; president; Minister Barbara Castle, Secretary of State for Health and Social Services of Great Britain; Jehan Sadat, wife Egyptian president Anwar Sadat. So many delegations were headed by politicians that the Conference became an arena of international disputes instead of a forum about humanitarianism, social or educative issues.

When Rabin reached the podium &quot;35 delegations abandoned the room&quot; with hundreds of delegates from Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Soviet bloc. Rabin had to wait for the &quot;exodus to finish&quot; to begin speaking. The violence against Israel made them fear that the Arab countries and other Non-Aligned Movement countries delegations questioned the credentials of Israel to participate in the Conference. Finally, the challenge turned to be only a rumor, but the Declaration of Mexico draft of 30 June already included a call to eliminate Zionism.

Later, the UN General Assembly adopted, by the impulse of Arab countries, the Soviet bloc and the Non-Aligned Movement, the 3379 resolution, which considered Zionism as racism and compared it with South Africa&#x27;s Apartheid. The conformation of that group of countries followed the logic of Cold War confrontations. The bloc voting produced a majority in the UN that organized to systematically condemn Israel in resolutions such as: 3089, 3236, 32/40, among other.

Three years after Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s appointment, in 1977, a US bank account (illegal at that time in Israel) held by Leah was exposed by &quot;Haaretz&quot; journalist Dan Margalit. As a result, her husband decided to take responsibility, resigned from office. This came to be known as the Dollar Account affair.

Rabin supported the peace efforts of her husband in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and worked further for a solution after his assassination. She wrote a book about her memories of her husband, which was released in 1997, under the name &quot;Rabin: Our Life, His Legacy&quot;.

She supported Shimon Peres in the elections of 1996, calling people to vote for him so that her husband&#x27;s death &quot;would not be in vain.&quot; She also expressed her disappointment after he lost the elections to Benjamin Netanyahu. In the election of 1999 she supported Ehud Barak. However, during Barak&#x27;s term as prime minister she changed her opinions about him.

==Death==
Leah Rabin was diagnosed with lung cancer and died in Rabin Medical Center in Petah Tikva in 2000 at the age of 72 and was buried in Mount Herzl in Jerusalem beside her husband Yitzhak Rabin, a few days after the fifth anniversary of her husband&#x27;s assassination.

==Family==
The Rabins&#x27; daughter Dalia was later a Knesset member for the Centre Party, New Way and the Labour Party, serving as Deputy Minister of Defense.

<doc id="915163" wikidata="Q5676864" url="?curid=915163" title="Harvest excursion">
<text>A harvest excursion was a common practice in Canada in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century where large numbers of workers would travel to the Canadian prairies to participate in the fall harvest.

There were long severe labour shortages on the Canadian prairies and these became extreme during the weeks of the fall harvest when millions of acres of crops needed to be brought in during a short period of time from September to October. Thus in 1890 harvest excursions were organized by the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) in which special trains would transport workers from Eastern Canada to the prairie centres. There they would be hired by agents and travel to farms across the prairies. The labourers were given low fares by the CPR as the railway knew that they would later earn a great deal from transporting the harvest. The CPR was also the largest landholder in the west and it hoped that some of the excursioners would decide to settle in the west and buy some railway land.

Many of the labourers came from Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritimes, but as demand increased workers began to be pulled from British Columbia, the United States, and Great Britain. Wages were high, the highest a labourer could earn in Canada. A season&#x27;s work could earn up to three hundred dollars. As room and board were normally provided, the only expense was the thirty to forty dollars for the train trip west. 

While wages were high, conditions were poor. The trains that carried the workers were crowded and unsanitary, with few stops on the way. There was rarely enough accommodation for the workers in the west and many were forced into crowded, substandard housing. In years with a poor harvest too many people could be brought west and some would find themselves out of work. In 1928 a mass of thousands of British workers who could not find work threatened to become violent and were shipped back across the Atlantic at government expense. For the western towns the annual arrival of the raucous excursioners was a major disruption with common instances of violence, drunkenness and theft.

During the First World War the need for labour in the west was even more pressing as thousands of young men had enlisted. An extended campaign drawing on patriotism saw an unprecedented number travel west. The excursion peaked in the mid-1920s with over 50,000 workers per season travelling west. By the late 1920s the development of the combine harvester and other equipment dramatically cut the need for labour. The onset of the Great Depression ended the practice completely as high excess production and unemployment affected the prairies.

<doc id="915167" wikidata="Q2260149" url="?curid=915167" title="Mount Ascutney">
<text>Mount Ascutney is a mountain in the U.S. state of Vermont. At , it is the highest peak in Windsor County. Mount Ascutney is a monadnock that rises abruptly from the surrounding lowlands. For example, the Windsor Trail is to the summit with of elevation gain and an overall 18% grade. Particularly noteworthy are the mountain&#x27;s granite outcrops, one of which, near the summit, serves as a launching point for hang-gliders.

The mountain&#x27;s base straddles several villages — Ascutney, Brownsville, Windsor, and West Windsor — and it is located only several miles off exit 8 on Interstate 91 in Mount Ascutney State Park. The mountain itself is visible from the top of Mount Washington, seventy miles away.

== Location and description ==
Mt. Ascutney is located in the southeastern section of Windsor County, in the Connecticut River Valley. The village of Ascutney, in the town of Weathersfield, is to the south. To the north lie the towns of Windsor and West Windsor. The village of Brownsville, in the town of West Windsor, sits at the northwestern base of the mountain. To the east lie the Connecticut River and the city of Claremont, New Hampshire. To the immediate west stands another, smaller mountain, fittingly named Little Ascutney Mountain.

== Etymology and naming dispute ==
Since the Colonial era, the mountain has primarily been referred to as &quot;Mount Ascutney&quot; (or such variant spellings as &quot;Aschutney&quot;), a name made official by the U.S. Board on Geologic Names in 1960. While various folk etymologies exist, many modern sources trace the name &quot;Ascutney&quot; to the Abenaki word &quot;Ascutegnik&quot;, a word meaning &quot;at the end of the river fork,&quot; which was the name of a settlement near where the Sugar River meets the Connecticut River. However, the use of the Abenaki word &quot;Kaskadenak&quot; (pronounced: &quot;Cas-Cad-Nac)&quot;–which means &quot;mountain of the rocky summit&quot; or &quot;wide mountain&quot;–as a name of the mountain has long been attested, and the Board on Geologic Names acknowledges the name as an official variant. In 2016, Hartland resident Robert Hutchins petitioned the Board to change the official name to Kaskadenak, garnering the support of Chief Paul Bunnell of the Koasek Traditional Band of the Abenaki Nation among others. In July 2018, the State of Vermont Board of Libraries, which has the statutory authority to name geographical features, heard arguments to officially rename the mountain to Mount Kaskadenak. The Board of Libraries voted 5–0 to reject the name change, citing the testimony of town managers who reported local opposition at meetings on the name change and the results of polling. The Board also cited an email from Smithsonian linguist Ives Goddard, who proposed that the origin of the name &quot;Ascutney&quot; was the Abenaki word &quot;kskatena&quot; and wrote that&quot;Ascutney […] and Cascadnac (from Western Abenaki kaskadenak) are both authentic names meaning &#x27;wide mountain.&#x27; Both names reflect variable features of the local Native American language and of English from different times.&quot;

== Viewing the mountain ==
Vermont Route 131 follows the south face of the mountain, and provides some good views of Ascutney. Similarly, Vermont Routes 44 and 44-A follow the north face, and provide a number of views of that side of the mountain. The north-south route of Interstate 91 runs just east of the mountain and provides extensive views of both the north and south faces. New Hampshire Routes 12 and 12-A provide good views of the east face. Viewing of the west face is difficult, due to the presence, immediately to the west, of Little Ascutney Mountain.

At longer distance, the mountain is visible from many locations quite a few miles away, particularly hilltops and other mountains. Ascutney can be viewed from select locations on the Dartmouth College campus, among them the upper floors of Rauner Library and the Steele Chemistry Building.

=== Cornish Colony ===
From the late 1880s to 1930, a community of artists thrived in Cornish and Plainfield, New Hampshire as well as Windsor, Vermont. Besides Augustus Saint-Gaudens, other artists built their homes specifically sited towards the mountain, and it became the focal point of many expansive gardens and Italianate villas. Maxfield Parrish, Charles Platt, Thomas Dewing, and Winston Churchill (the writer) all built homes to view the mountain. Many of these houses remain, view intact, and the estate Augustus Saint Gaudens is now a national park, with, of course, a lovely view.

== Geology ==
Mount Ascutney is part of the White Mountain plutonic-volcanic series of igneous rocks. These rocks intruded from Triassic to Cretaceous time in southern Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont with the relatively young Ascutney pluton intruding at ~122 MA (K/Ar date on biotite). The Ascutney pluton is about 8 km × 4 km in map area and intrudes into Precambrian basement gneisses of the Chester dome and overlying Paleozoic metasedimentary rocks. The pluton emplacement is probably related to the formation of transform faults and/or fracture zones during (failed) Mesozoic rifting. The petrology of the pluton consists of three stocks which are gabbro-diorite, syenite and granite. There are also a partial ring dike and a number of other dikes in the area.

The last glacier broke material off the mountain and distributed it southward into Massachusetts. The trail it left is known as the &quot;Mount Ascutney Train.&quot;

Mount Ascutney is a hang gliding site in New England. Notable for its excellent soaring, it is not unusual for hang gliders to fly from Mt. Ascutney to nearby states. Some trips can stretch to the New Hampshire or Massachusetts coastline, a flight of over 90 miles.

==Bronson Farm==
Actor Charles Bronson owned a farm near the mountain he and his wife named Zuleika, after their daughter. His remains were buried at Brownsville Cemetery in West Windsor, near the foot of the mountain, after his 2003 death.

== Wildlife ==
Wild turkeys, deer, porcupines, and a wide variety of birds are commonly seen on Mt. Ascutney. The mountain is a favorite area for viewing migrating birds, which use the Connecticut River as a navigation pathway. More rarely seen wildlife includes moose, black bears, bobcats and fishers.

== Hiking trails ==
The mountain features four principal hiking trails, three of which are named for the town from which that trail originates:

* The Weathersfield Trail — The one trail on the south face of the mountain, the base of this trail is located in a parking lot at the end of Cascade Falls Rd, off of Vermont Route 131 in Weathersfield. Highlights of this trail include Cascade Falls, the largest waterfall on the mountain, and the mountain&#x27;s one launch platform for hang gliders.
* The Windsor Trail – This trail originates from a small parking area off Vermont Route 44-A just east of the junction with Vermont Route 44. About 1/3 of the way up, the trail comes to a small waterfall, approximately 2/3 of the way up the trail comes to a small log lean-to shelter. Near the top, it merges with the Brownsville Trail.
* The Brownsville Trail – This trail begins at a parking area along Vermont Route 44, a little over a mile west of junction with Vermont Route 44-A. The lower end of the trail follows an abandoned logging road for some distance – the road terminating at the location of an old granite quarry. The trail offers many good viewing opportunities to the north and west.
* The Futures Trail – This trail begins in the campground at Mt. Ascutney State Park on Route 44A, one mile west of the junction with U.S. Route 5 in Ascutney. This is the longest trail on Mt. Ascutney – 4.6 miles, covering a wide variety of forest and geography before it connects to the Windsor Trail near the summit. Highlights of this trail include Bare Rock Vista (1.0 mile) and the Steam Donkey – a steam powered machine used for cable logging in the early 1900s (3.5 miles). This trail can also be accessed at two points along the State Park Mountain Road for a shorter hike to summit.

At the top, a relatively level trail follows the ridgeline and crosses the summit. The top of the mountain is well below the tree line and is therefore covered in forest. There are a number of rocky cliffs allow good viewing, one lookout in particular The Nowlan Lookout is named for a local American sculptor Lawrence Nowlan. There is an observation tower, as well. There are also two large communications towers.

The summit can also be reached via a short trail from the parking lot at the end of the only road up the mountain, the Mt. Ascutney State Park Mountain Road.

== Skiing and the Ascutney Mountain Resort ==

Mt. Ascutney was home to the Ascutney Mountain Resort, which was a ski resort located on the mountain&#x27;s northwest face, in the village of Brownsville. The ski area closed in 2010, and is now a nature preserve with plans to reopen a smaller ski area. Opening after the end of World War II, skiing facilities originally consisted of just one rope tow. The resort property was purchased by IHG Resorts in 2008 andcontinues to renovate and improve the property. The mountain and trails were purchased by a non-profit organization Vermont Outdoors and is now operated as town forest for Brownsville Vermont. The trails accommodate the entire family, but expert and intermediate skiers found themselves most at home at the resort, whose trails averaged from medium grade to steep, and were often icy from the mountain&#x27;s often harsh winds. The ski resort&#x27;s primary competitors were Killington, Okemo, Mount Sunapee, and Stratton.

<doc id="915178" wikidata="Q370268" url="?curid=915178" title="Caron Butler">
<text>James Caron Butler (born March 13, 1980) is an American professional basketball coach and former player who is an assistant coach for the Miami Heat of the National Basketball Association. During his 14-year NBA career, he played for the Miami Heat, Los Angeles Lakers, Washington Wizards, Dallas Mavericks, Los Angeles Clippers, Milwaukee Bucks, Oklahoma City Thunder, Detroit Pistons, and Sacramento Kings. Butler is a two-time NBA All-Star. He was the 2002 Big East Conference Men&#x27;s Basketball Player of the Year while playing for the Connecticut Huskies.

==Early life==
Butler was born and raised in Racine, Wisconsin, where he suffered through a rough childhood; he was a drug dealer at age 12 and arrested 15 times before the age of 15. Butler discovered his love for basketball while at a youth detention center. Butler played in Amateur Athletic Union basketball in 1998 and 1999. After a brief career at Racine Park High School, he enrolled at Maine Central Institute where he was successful enough to receive a scholarship to attend the University of Connecticut to play for the Connecticut Huskies men&#x27;s basketball team for coach Jim Calhoun for two years.

==College career==
At Connecticut, Butler lost and developed his perimeter game. As a freshman, Butler led the Huskies, only two years removed from a national championship, in scoring (15.3 points per game) and rebounds (7.6 per game). The summer after his freshman season, he started for the US team that took home gold in the 2001 FIBA World Championship for Young Men.

Butler improved as a sophomore, averaging 20.3 points and 7.5 rebounds per game, leading the Huskies to regular-season and tournament Big East titles. His accolades included Big East tournament MVP, co-Big East player of the year (with Pittsburgh&#x27;s Brandin Knight), and second-team All-American. Butler led the Huskies to the Elite 8 of the NCAA basketball tournament. In the quarter-final game, he scored 32 points but the Huskies lost a close game to the eventual national champion Maryland Terrapins. After the season ended, Butler declared for the NBA draft.

==NBA career==

===Miami Heat (2002–2004)===
Butler was a lottery pick in the 2002 NBA draft, selected with the 10th overall pick by the rebuilding Miami Heat. Miami relied on the rookie Butler immediately: he started all 78 games he played in during the season. He finished with an average of 15.4 points, 5.1 rebounds, and 1.8 steals per game—the latter good for 8th in the league. Miami won just 25 games and missed the playoffs, but Butler excelled. He won rookie-of-the-month awards four times during the season, was picked to play in the rookie challenge game at that year&#x27;s All-Star weekend in Atlanta, and at season&#x27;s end was named to the first team on the NBA All-Rookie Team. After the season, Miami entered the draft lottery, drafted Dwyane Wade, and acquired Lamar Odom from the Los Angeles Clippers.

In the 2003–2004 season, Butler struggled with injuries, starting just 56 of 68 games. His scoring average fell to 9.2 points, but Miami&#x27;s balanced offense led by Wade, Odom, and Eddie Jones propelled Miami into the playoffs. In the first round, the Heat and the New Orleans Hornets battled in a grueling 7-game series in which the home team won every game. In game 7, Miami closed out the series with Butler scoring 23 points with 9 rebounds. The Heat advanced to the play the top-seeded Indiana Pacers, who were heavily favored and won the first two games of the series before Miami responded with two home wins to tie the series at two games apiece. Butler scored 21 points with 10 rebounds in the fourth game, but the Pacers won the series in six games. After the season, Miami traded Butler, Odom and Brian Grant to the Los Angeles Lakers for superstar center Shaquille O&#x27;Neal.

===Los Angeles Lakers (2004–2005)===
The Lakers had been a title contender but were now in rebuilding mode led by superstar guard Kobe Bryant. Butler started in all of his 77 games in the 2004–2005 season, averaging 15.5 points a game with a then-career-high field-goal percentage of 44.5% percent. The Lakers struggled with injuries and a midseason coaching change, and failed to make the playoffs. The Lakers traded Butler and Chucky Atkins to the Washington Wizards for Kwame Brown and Laron Profit.

===Washington Wizards (2005–2010)===

Upon arriving in Washington, Butler signed a 5-year, $46 million deal. He became part of Washington&#x27;s new &quot;Big 3&quot;, a trio made up of teammates Gilbert Arenas and Antawn Jamison. Butler was nicknamed &quot;Tough Juice&quot; by coach Eddie Jordan for his aggressive and passionate play, epitomized by Butler&#x27;s 20 rebounds in the Game 6 loss of the playoff-opening-round series against LeBron James and the Cleveland Cavaliers.

On January 17, 2007, Butler made his first game-winning basket, a dunk off a pass from DeShawn Stevenson with 2.2 seconds remaining against the Knicks to give the Wizards a 99–98 win. Butler was named Eastern Conference Player of the Week for January 15–21, 2007. It was his best season yet, posting career-high averages in rebounds, assists, and points. He was named as a reserve to the 2007 NBA Eastern Conference All-Star team, his first appearance. He broke his hand late in the season attempting to block a shot and sat out the playoffs, along with the injured Gilbert Arenas, and the Wizards were swept in their opening-round rematch with the Cavaliers.

In the 2007-08 season, Butler, who was sidelined with a hip injury, was nonetheless selected as a reserve for the East in the 2008 NBA All-Star Game in New Orleans, Louisiana. He missed 20 of the Wizards&#x27; last 35 games of the season. He returned to the lineup on March 13 (his 28th birthday), when the Wizards hosted the Cavaliers. He scored 19 points (8-for-18 field goals) and five rebounds in 41 minutes in the Wizards&#x27; 101–99 win.

===Dallas Mavericks (2010–2011)===
On February 13, 2010, Butler was traded to the Dallas Mavericks along with Brendan Haywood and Deshawn Stevenson for Josh Howard, Drew Gooden, James Singleton, and Quinton Ross. The Mavericks qualified for the 2010 NBA Playoffs as the second seed in the Western Conference, but were upset in six games by the San Antonio Spurs in the first round.

On January 4, 2011, Butler was ruled out for the rest of the 2010–11 season after undergoing surgery to repair a ruptured right patellar tendon. The Mavericks went on to defeat the Miami Heat 4–2 in the 2011 NBA Finals to claim their first NBA championship.

===Los Angeles Clippers (2011–2013)===
On December 9, 2011, Butler signed a three-year, $24 million deal with the Los Angeles Clippers. During his two seasons as a starter with the Clippers, he helped the team reach the playoffs twice.

===Milwaukee Bucks (2013–2014)===
On July 10, 2013, Butler was traded to the Phoenix Suns alongside Eric Bledsoe in a three-way trade that had both Jared Dudley from the Suns and JJ Redick from the Milwaukee Bucks join the Clippers and two different second round picks being sent to the Bucks. On August 29, 2013, the Suns traded Butler to the Milwaukee Bucks for Ish Smith and Viacheslav Kravtsov. On November 22, Butler scored a game-leading 38 points, his largest single game total since 2009, during an overtime 115–107 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers.

On February 27, 2014, Butler was bought out of his contract by the Bucks, and in 34 games, he averaged 11.0 points per game.

===Oklahoma City Thunder (2014)===
On March 1, 2014, Butler signed with the Oklahoma City Thunder. Butler finished the season having played in 22 regular season games and 17 playoff games for the Thunder, as they qualified for the Western Conference Finals where they were defeated by the San Antonio Spurs.

===Detroit Pistons (2014–2015)===
On July 15, 2014, Butler signed with the Detroit Pistons to a reported two-year, $9 million contract.

On June 11, 2015, Butler was traded, along with Shawne Williams, to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange for Ersan İlyasova. However, he was later waived by the Bucks on June 30, 2015.

===Sacramento Kings (2015–2016)===
On July 23, 2015, Butler signed with the Sacramento Kings. He received minimal minutes during the 2015–16 season and made just 17 appearances, averaging 3.7 points and 1.3 rebounds per game.

On June 21, 2016, Butler exercised his player option with the Kings for the 2016–2017 season. However, he was later waived by the Kings on July 4, 2016, after he reached an agreement with the team to have his contract bought out.

Butler&#x27;s final NBA game was on April 11, 2016, in a 105 - 101 victory over the Phoenix Suns where he recorded 7 points, 2 rebounds, 1 assist and 1 block.

===Retirement===
Butler announced his retirement on February 6, 2018.

==Coaching career==
On November 14, 2020, the Miami Heat announced that they had hired Butler as assistant coach.

==Other activities==
In 2015, Butler released an autobiography entitled &quot;Tuff Juice: My Journey from the Streets to the NBA&quot;. In 2019 Mark Wahlberg signed on as the executive producer of Butler&#x27;s biopic of the same name.

In 2017, he participated within Global Mixed Gender Basketball (GMGB), which is the first professional basketball league to support unified play between men and women, by being a color commentator for games. He also owns a team in the newly developed league known as the Wisconsin Cheeseheads.

Also in 2017, Butler joined ESPN as full-time college basketball and NBA analyst. In 2018 Butler joined FS1 as an NBA analyst.

==Personal life==
Caron Butler is a Christian. After Butler was sent to a juvenile institution, he began to change his life by reading Bible verses. Butler began taking his interest in basketball seriously when he looked out his window at a basketball court at Ethan Allen Juvenile Detention. Butler spoke of it saying, &quot;God puts stuff in front of you for a reason.&quot; Butler also said, &quot;God put his hands on my life. [God] said, &#x27;I&#x27;m going to touch you so that you can touch others.&#x27;&quot;

Butler attended a surprise birthday party for Anthony Fadel, a 16-year-old in the Washington, D.C. area when invited by the boy&#x27;s family. The party was held in May 2007, and the event was primarily reported by blogs, since Wizards&#x27; PR purposely did not cover the event to preserve the sincerity of Butler&#x27;s gesture.

After working at Burger King in his youth, Butler now owns six of the fast food restaurants across the United States. He has taken Business Management classes at Duke University.

Butler is the son of Mattie Claybrook Paden. His father left him when he was born to join the Marines. His mother married Melvin and he has younger brother Melvin III.

Caron and Andrea Pink Butler met at UConn&#x27;s pre college summer program. After their sophomore year they traveled to Las Vegas in 2005 and married. Butler has a daughter and son from a previous relationship. With wife Andrea he has three other daughters.

<doc id="915185" wikidata="Q218623" url="?curid=915185" title="Samuel L. Mitchill">
<text>Samuel Latham Mitchill (August 20, 1764September 7, 1831) was an American physician, naturalist, and politician who lived in Plandome, New York.

==Early life==
Samuel Mitchill was born in Hempstead in the Province of New York, the son of Robert Mitchill and his wife, Mary Latham, both Quakers.

He was sent to Scotland and graduated in 1786 from the University of Edinburgh Medical School with an M.D., his education being paid for by a wealthy uncle. Returning to the United States after medical school, Mitchill also completed law school. As a lawyer, he oversaw the purchase of lands in western New York from the Iroquois Indians in 1788.

==Career==
Mitchill taught chemistry, botany, and natural history at Columbia College from 1792 to 1801 and was a founding editor of &quot;The Medical Repository&quot;, the first medical journal in the United States. In 1793, he was elected a Foreign Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were James Gregory, Dugald Stewart, and John Rotherham.

In addition to his Columbia lectures on botany, zoology, and mineralogy, Mitchill collected, identified, and classified many plants and animals, particularly aquatic organisms. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1797. From 1807 to 1826, he taught at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of New York and then helped organize the short-lived Rutgers Medical College of New Jersey, which he served as vice president until 1830. While at Columbia, Mitchill developed a fallacious theory of disease; however, it resulted in his promotion of personal hygiene and improved sanitation.

Mitchill served in the New York State Assembly in 1791 and again in 1798 and was then elected as a Democratic-Republican to the United States House of Representatives, serving from 1801 until his resignation on November 22, 1804. As a congressman, he was one of the impeachment managers who, in the impeachment trial, successfully prosecuted the articles of impeachment adopted by the House against Judge John Pickering. In November 1804, Mitchill was elected a U.S. Senator from New York to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of John Armstrong, and served from November 23, 1804, to March 4, 1809. He then served again in the House of Representatives from December 4, 1810, to March 4, 1813.

Mitchill was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1814. On January 29, 1817, Mitchill convened the first meeting of the New York Academy of Sciences, originally called the Lyceum of Natural History, of which he was later elected president.

Mitchill strongly endorsed the building of the Erie Canal, sponsored by his friend and political ally DeWitt Clinton; they were both members of the short-lived New-York Institution. Mitchill suggested renaming the United States of America Fredonia, combining the English &quot;freedom&quot; with a Latinate ending. Although the suggestion was not seriously considered, some towns adopted the name, including Fredonia, New York. Some freebooters established a short-lived republic under that name in Texas in the late 1820s.

==Personality==
Mitchill was a man of &quot;irrepressible energies... polyglot enthusiasms... [and] distinguished eccentricities&quot; who was not &quot;a man afraid to speak out loud about the loves of plants and animals; indeed, he was not a man afraid to speak out loud on most any topic. In the early nineteenth century, Mitchill was New York&#x27;s &quot;most publicly universal gentleman... a man known variously as the &#x27;living encyclopedia,&#x27; as a &#x27;stalking library,&#x27; and (to his admired Jefferson) as the &#x27;Congressional Dictionary.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Once described as a &#x27;chaos of knowledge,&#x27; Mitchill was generally more admired for his encyclopedic breadth of understanding than for much originality of thought.&quot; As a personality, he was affable but also egotistical and pedantic. Mitchill enjoyed popularizing scientific knowledge and promoting practical applications of scientific inquiry.

<doc id="915192" wikidata="Q496907" url="?curid=915192" title="A Life Less Ordinary">
<text>A Life Less Ordinary is a 1997 British romantic black comedy film directed by Danny Boyle, written by John Hodge, and starring Ewan McGregor, Cameron Diaz, Holly Hunter, Delroy Lindo, Ian Holm and Dan Hedaya. The plot follows two angels (Hunter and Lindo) who are sent to Earth to help make a disgruntled kidnapper (McGregor) and his hostage (Diaz) fall in love.

The film received mixed reviews and was unsuccessful at the box office, only grossing $14.6 million worldwide against its $12 million budget.

==Plot==
In Heaven, angels are tasked with ensuring that mortals on Earth find love. The &quot;Captain&quot;, Gabriel, is upset at reviewing the file of angel partners O&#x27;Reilly and Jackson, all of whose recent cases have ended in divorce or misery. He introduces a radical new incentive: if their next pair does not fall, and stay, in love (which Gabriel admits is a tough case), O&#x27;Reilly and Jackson must stay on earth forever.

Celine Naville is the spoiled twenty-something daughter of a wealthy businessman, and Robert Lewis is a janitor employed in her father&#x27;s company. After being fired and replaced by a robot, Robert drowns his sorrows at a local bar. His girlfriend Lily later tells him she is leaving him for her aerobics instructor.

Believing that shared peril will bring them together, O&#x27;Reilly and Jackson pose as collection agents to repossess Robert&#x27;s things and evict him from his apartment. Robert storms into Mr. Naville&#x27;s office and, after wrestling a gun from a security guard, he decides to kidnap Celine. He drives her to a remote cabin in the California woods but, even though she easily slips her restraints, she decides to stick around for the adventure and for revenge against her father, suggesting that they extort a huge ransom.

The angels pose as bounty hunters and contract with Mr Naville to retrieve Celine and kill Robert. Robert&#x27;s first attempt to collect the ransom fails, but Celine encourages him. They go out to a bar, get drunk and sleep together. Afterwards, Robert reveals to Celine his recurring dream where they are both on a game show and she must shoot him through the heart with an arrow.

Robert makes a second demand for the ransom, with a letter written in Celine&#x27;s blood. Mr Naville gives the angels the money, and they go to meet Robert in the forest. To their disappointment, he appears willing to let Celine go in exchange for the money before O&#x27;Reilly stops his getaway.

While O&#x27;Reilly and Celine wait by their car, Jackson takes Robert into the woods to execute him. Before he can, Celine decks O&#x27;Reilly, runs into the woods, and knocks Jackson out with a shovel. As Robert and Celine drive away, O&#x27;Reilly attacks them. To escape, Robert and Celine jump from the car, which careens off a cliff, with the money still inside.

Since they are short of money, Celine decides to rob a bank. The robbery goes smoothly until a security guard shoots at her. Robert pushes her out of the way, taking a bullet in the thigh. Celine hurriedly drives him back to the city to be operated on by Elliott, a dentist who had previously proposed marriage to her. A little later, when Robert regains consciousness, he is appalled to see Celine playing a sexual role-playing game with Elliott. A fight breaks out, and Robert knocks Elliot unconscious. As they drive away, Celine explains that she agreed to Elliot&#x27;s request only so that he would help Robert. Hurt, Robert gets out of the car and walks away.

To get them back together, Jackson writes a love poem in Robert&#x27;s handwriting and sends it to Celine. Overcome, she runs back to Robert and says he has won her heart. The angels&#x27; plan seems to work until Robert says he did not write it. Humiliated, Celine runs out again. Robert runs after her, but is too late: the angels, believing they failed, decide to make their Earth-bound lives bearable by kidnapping Celine for ransom.

Robert tracks Celine to their hideout. He knocks O&#x27;Reilly down and, struggling with Jackson, tells Celine he loves her. The door is kicked down by Naville&#x27;s butler, Mayhew, who shoots the two angels in the head. Leaving Celine locked in the trunk, Naville and Mayhew drive Robert and the two angels&#x27; bodies to the cabin, planning to fake a murder-suicide.

In Heaven, Gabriel&#x27;s secretary begs him to intervene. Gabriel eventually complies and phones God. A neighbor releases Celine from the trunk and, taking his gun, she runs to the cabin and confronts her father, while Mayhew holds Robert at gunpoint. Celine shoots Mayhew in the shoulder, the bullet somehow passing through Robert&#x27;s heart en route but leaving him unharmed, just as he had dreamed.

O&#x27;Reilly and Jackson later come back to life. After Gabriel congratulates them on a successful case, the two angels hold hands as they prepare to return home, suggesting they have also found love together. Robert and Celine retrieve the suitcase full of money, and with it, they settle in a castle in Scotland, shown in the animated end credits.

==Reception==

=== Critical response ===
&quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot; has received mixed reviews from film critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 41% based on 37 reviews, with an average score of 5.38/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus states &quot;&quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot; has an intriguing cast and stylish work from director Danny Boyle, but they&#x27;re not enough to overcome the story&#x27;s fatally misjudged tonal mishmash.&quot; Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average score in the 0–100 range based on reviews from mainstream critics, calculated an average score of 35% for the film, based on reviews from 22 critics. Andrew Johnson wrote in Time Out New York, &quot;The outsiders&#x27; take on America that Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge bring to the film adds to its humour, as do subtle homages to other movies (including &quot;The Road Warrior&quot;, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;). Parts of &quot;Life&quot; lean toward the saccharine, and the ending could be stronger, but none of that prevents it from being one of the years&#x27; most charming date movies.&quot;

Roger Ebert gave &quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot; a negative review, presenting it 2 out of 4 stars. He described the film as a &quot;movie that never convinces us that it needed to be made.&quot; He goes on to call the plot a mess and states that it &quot;expends enormous energy to tell a story that is tedious and contrived.&quot;

===Box-office performance===
The film opened up in theatres on 24 October 1997. During its opening weekend, the film ranked 9th overall by pulling in only $2,007,279. By the end of its run, the film grossed a total of $4,366,722 in the United States. Internationally, the film made $10,345,675 for a worldwide total of $14,633,270.

==Adaptations==
The film was serialised as a full-length comic strip within leading British comic magazine &quot;2000 AD,&quot; adapted by then-editor David Bishop and drawn by Steve Yeowell. Screenwriter John Hodge also wrote a novelisation of the film that was published by Penguin Books ().

Scenes from the film were used in the music video for Beck&#x27;s song &quot;Deadweight&quot;, directed by Michel Gondry, and the music video for Ash&#x27;s song &quot;A Life Less Ordinary&quot;, directed by Hammer &amp; Tongs, as well as the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Leave&quot; by Faithless.

== Soundtrack ==


&quot;Deadweight&quot;, a single by Beck, was nominated for Best Song from a Movie at the 1998 MTV Movie Awards.

<text>Chertsey is a town in the Borough of Runnymede, Surrey, England, southwest of central London. It grew up around Chertsey Abbey, founded in AD 666 by St Erkenwald, and gained a market charter from Henry I. A bridge across the River Thames first appeared in the early 15th century. 

The River Bourne through the town meets the Thames at Weybridge. The Anglican church has a medieval tower and chancel roof. The 18th-century listed buildings include the current stone Chertsey Bridge and Botleys Mansion. A curfew bell, rung at 8pm on weekdays from Michaelmas to Lady Day ties with the romantic local legend of Blanche Heriot, marked by a statue of her and the bell at Chertsey Bridge. Green areas include the Thames Path National Trail, Chertsey Meads and a round knoll (St Ann&#x27;s Hill) with remains of a prehistoric hill fort known as Eldebury Hill. Pyrcroft House dates from the 18th century and Tara from the late 20th. 

Train services are run between Chertsey railway station and London Waterloo by South Western Railway. The town is within the M25, accessible via junction 11. It has a population of 15,967.

==Toponymy==
The first written mention of Chertsey is by Bede , in which he describes the location as &quot;Cerotaesei, id est Ceroti insula&quot; (translated as &quot;Chertsey, that is the island of &quot;Cerotus&quot;&quot;). The settlement appears in 13th-century copies of 7th-century charters as &quot;Cirotesige&quot;, &quot;Cirotesge&quot; and &quot;Cerotesge&quot;. The manor is recorded as &quot;Certesi&quot; in Domesday Book in 1086 and as &quot;Certeseye&quot; in 1129–30. Other later forms include &quot;Charteseye&quot; (mid-14th century), &quot;Charsey&quot; (in 1543) and &quot;Chutsey&quot; (in 1606). The first use of the modern spelling &quot;Chertsey&quot; is from 1559.

The first part of the toponym &quot;Chertsey&quot; is thought to refer to a Celtic individual, whose name was subsequently Latinised to &quot;Cerotus&quot;. The second part derives from the Old English &quot;ēg&quot; and means &quot;island or well-watered land&quot;.

==History==


Chertsey is one of the oldest market towns in England. Its Church of England parish church dates to the 12th century (see below) and the farmhouse of the Hardwick in the elevated southwest is of 16th-century construction. It grew to all sides but the north around Chertsey Abbey, founded in 666 A.D. by Eorcenwald, Bishop of London, using a donation by Frithwald. Until the end of use of the hundreds, used in the feudal system until the establishment of Rural Districts and Urban District Councils, the name chosen for the wider Chertsey area hundred was Godley Hundred. 

In the 9th century, the abbey and town were sacked by the Danes, leaving a mark today in the name of the neighbouring village, Thorpe, and refounded as a subsidiary abbey from Abingdon Abbey by King Edgar in 964.

Chertsey appears in the Domesday Book as &quot;Certesi&quot;. It was held partly by Chertsey Abbey and partly by Richard Sturmid from the abbey. Its Domesday assets were: 5 hides, 1 mill and 1 forge at the hall, 20 ploughs, 80 hectares of meadow, woodland worth 50 hogs. It rendered a larger than average sum for the book of manor and ecclesiastical parish entries, £22.

The abbey grew to become one of the largest Benedictine abbeys in England, supported by large fiefs in the northwest corner of Sussex and Surrey until it was dissolved by Henry VIII in 1536. The King took stone from the abbey to construct his palace at Oatlands Palace; the villagers also used stone for raising the streets. By the late 17th century, only some outer walls of the abbey remained. During this period until at least 1911 a wider area was included in Chertsey: Ottershaw (and Brox) was an ecclesiastical district; whose church-sponsored (first built) schools were built in 1870, so too was Addlestone.

Today the history of the abbey is reflected in local place names and the surviving former fishponds that fill with water after heavy rain. The nearby Hardwick Court Farm, now much reduced in size and cut off from the town by the M25, has the successor to the abbey&#x27;s large and well-supported 15th-century tithe barn, mostly rebuilt in the 17th century.

The eighteenth-century Chertsey Bridge provides an important cross-river link, and Chertsey Lock is a short distance above it on the opposite side. On the south west corner of the bridge is a bronze statue of local heroine Blanche Heriot striking the bell by Sheila MitchellFRBS.

The summit of St Ann&#x27;s Hill in Chertsey was a vital viewing point for the Anglo-French Survey, which calculated the distance between the Royal Greenwich Observatory and the Paris Observatory using trigonometry. A grid of triangles was measured all the way to the French coast, to join up with the French survey; St Ann&#x27;s Hill was crucial for the link with the base-line of the English survey on Hounslow Heath.

In the 18th century, Chertsey Cricket Club was one of the strongest in the country and beat the rest of England (excluding Hampshire) by more than an innings in 1778. The Duke of Dorset, (who played cricket for Chertsey), was appointed Ambassador to France in 1784. He arranged to have the Chertsey cricket team travel to France in 1789 to introduce cricket to the French nobility. However, the team, on arriving at Dover, met the Ambassador returning from France at the outset of the French Revolution and the opportunity was missed.

The original Chertsey railway station was built by the London and Southampton Railway and opened on 14 February 1848. The present station, across the level crossing from the site of the original one, was opened on 10 October 1866 by the London and South Western Railway. The Southern Railway completed electrification of the line on 3 January 1937.

Samuel Lewis devotes one of his longest entries to the small town in his 1848 topographical guide to England:
Chertsey Regatta has been held on the river for over 150 years, which is in the non-Olympic regional sport of skiffing which has a club on this reach of river. Similarly the Olympic sport of rowing (in racing shells) has an annual Burway Regatta above Chertsey Lock, an area of former flood meadow, reservoirs and golf course. The Burway was in the medieval period let out by the abbey as over of grazing pasture (and remains postally associated with the town). The Burway faces Laleham Park, the largest municipal park of a neighbouring borough.

Chertsey was the home of Charles James Fox, who had wished to be buried there but instead is buried in Westminster Abbey. The nearby estate that is now the large Foxhills Golf Estate, Spa and Restaurant, close to Ottershaw and Lyne, was named in honour of him, but was not his home.

A long history of metal working exists, and from the 19th century a prosperous bell foundry, Eldridge, was in Windsor Street. Herrings, an iron foundry, flourished during the 19th century and was situated in Gogmore Lane.

The Chertsey troop of the Berkshire Yeomanry occupied the Drill Hall on Drill Hall Road since 1977. The unit has close ties with the borough and was granted the freedom of Runnymede in 2009. The Drill Hall closed at the end of March 2010 and the troop had to return to Windsor due to cuts in the Territorial Army in 2009–2010.
==Geography==
===Location and topography===

Chertsey is part of the London commuter belt in the outermost part of the Greater London Urban Area and is served by Chertsey railway station and separated from all adjoining settlements by the buffer of designated areas of Green Belt. Measuring from centre to centre, Chertsey is from London, from Addlestone, and from the county town, Guildford. The traditional, yet commercially important town centre is a conservation area, joined by an arcade to a medium-sized supermarket and car park to the south.

The character of this central area is that of a traditional small town, with relatively narrow building frontages set hard up against the pavement, so that they clearly define the public space. The centre of the town is richly endowed with listed buildings most of which date from the 16th and 17th centuries. In addition to the more than 56 numbered houses/shops (42 buildings) nationally listed buildings, nine other buildings in the conservation area are locally listed. A further 11 buildings outside the centre are also nationally listed.

Elevation is generally low at 14m in the Town Centre and 11 m on the River Thames at Chertsey Bridge, making it the lowest place in Chertsey. The highest point is on the peak of wooded and inhabited St. Ann&#x27;s Hill which reaches an elevation of 77 m, making it the second-highest point in Runnymede. Across Chertsey bridge, pictured, on the Middlesex side of the river is the Thames Path National Trail and Chertsey Lock.

===Geology===
Chertsey town centre lies on a floodplain terrace between the River Thames to the north and The Bourne to the south. Much of the terrace consists of river gravels deposited on the sandy Bagshot Beds, which in turn overlie the London Clay. The soil in this area is loamy and the water table is naturally high.

St Ann&#x27;s Hill appears as an island of Tertiary strata, surrounded by river deposits. The hill is composed primarily of the Bagshot Beds, but is capped by Bracklesham Clays with a thick pebble bed. South west of the town centre, the chert and flint pebble deposits at Cockcrow Hill and Sandgates were probably deposited by an earlier course of The Bourne.

==Economy==
Aside from being a London &quot;commuter town&quot;, Chertsey is home to the head office of Compass Group, and the UK head office and European headquarters of Samsung Electronics. Samsung moved there in 2005; previously the Samsung offices were in New Malden.

Thorpe Park, part of Merlin Entertainments Ltd, is on the northern boundary, connected by frequent buses from Staines-upon-Thames and Chertsey.

==Landmarks==
===Chertsey Bridge===
Chertsey Bridge is a Scheduled Ancient Monument and Grade II* listed structure that has a listed &quot;City (of London tax) Post&quot; at one end, and nearby milestones. It is predominantly of ashlar light stone with two white flagstone york stone pavements with a low weight limit and narrow carriageways inappropriate to HGVs, which have Staines Bridge, Walton Bridge or motorway alternatives to reach Spelthorne.

Samuel Lewis included it in his opening description of the town above: &quot;...[River Thames] over which is a handsome stone bridge of seven arches, built in 1785, at an expense of £13,000, defrayed jointly by the counties of Surrey and Middlesex...&quot; It was built in 1783–1785 by James Paine.

===Museum===
Chertsey has an admission-free museum on Windsor Street, which provides considerable information about the history of Chertsey.

The museum holds the Olive Matthews costume collection, which is of national importance, contains around three thousand pieces of costume and was donated by Matthews to the museum in 1969.

The museum contains clocks by two local makers, James Douglass and Henry Wale Cartwright. (Note however that there were three successive watchmakers called James Douglass (or Douglas) in the Douglas family, the latter based in Egham)

<text>Robert Eyres Landor (10 May 1781 – 26 January 1869) was an English writer, dramatist, poet, and Anglican clergyman.

==Life==
Landor was the third son of Dr Walter Landor, a physician, and his wife Elizabeth Savage, and thereby the brother of Walter Savage Landor. He was born at Warwick and went to Bromsgrove School, then as a scholar, to Worcester College, Oxford in 1797. He became a Fellow of Worcester College and a clergyman. In 1815 Landor went to Italy and met his brother Walter and his wife as they made their temperamental journey through France. He became vicar of Hughenden Buckinghamshire in 1817 until 1825, and was also Chaplain in ordinary to the Prince Regent. He became Rector of Nafford in Birlingham in 1829 and remained there until his death. Birlingham is situated at the foot of the Bredan Hills and within sight of the Malverns. He is noted as never having been absent from Sunday Duty and the church at Birlingham was restored with money left by him.

He was somewhat reluctant to claim credit for his own work. The drama &quot;The Count Arezzi&quot; of 1824 was at the time attributed to Byron and the story &quot;The Fawn of Sertorius&quot; (1846) to Walter Savage Landor. He is also said to have tried to destroy copies of the dramas &quot;The Earl of Brecon&quot;, &quot;Faiths Fraud&quot; and &quot;The Ferryman&quot; from 1841.

It was said that he greatly resembled his eldest brother, Walter Savage Landor, in his genius and classical knowledge, but in nothing else. His cousin&#x27;s daughter Lucy Landor recalled &quot;Once only I recall his visiting my father and he then struck me as the most wonderful and delightful talker I ever heard. He spoke of his early travels in Italy and brought every scene before one. If he &#x27;talked like a book&#x27;, it was because his language was so beautiful and his descriptions so vivid and striking. His conversation made far more impression on me than did that of [his brother] W.S.L., whose tremendous laughs I recall much better than his saying.&quot;

<text>William Strickland (died 1419) was an English priest and sometime Rector of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Horncastle who served as Bishop of Carlisle from 1400 until 1419. He was appointed by Pope Boniface IX, but not initially accepted by King Henry IV, although he did confirm the appointment after the chapter had elected him. He was consecrated on 15 August 1400. Strickland was one of the commissioners who negotiated peace with Scotland in 1401.

Early in life he had been married to Isabel, daughter and heiress of Thomas de Warthecopp, of that place, and Margaret his wife, by whom he had a daughter Margaret. This Margaret married twice, first to Sir John de Derwentwater, and secondly to Sir Robert de Lowther. By these two marriages she had at least ten children, more probably eleven.

Strickland died on 30 August 1419.

<text>Northeastern State University (NSU) is a public university with its main campus in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. The university also has two other campuses in Muskogee and Broken Arrow as well as online. Northeastern is the oldest institution of higher learning in the state of Oklahoma as well as one of the oldest institutions of higher learning west of the Mississippi River. Tahlequah is home to the capital of the Cherokee Nation and about 25 percent of the students at NSU identify themselves as American Indian. The university has many courses focused on Native American linguistics, and offers Cherokee language Education as a major. Cherokee can be studied as a second language, and some classes are taught in Cherokee for first language speakers as well.

==History==
On May 7, 1851, the Cherokee Nation founded the Cherokee National Female Seminary at Tahlequah, the same year that it opened a male seminary in its territory. This was after its removal to Indian Territory and part of its building institutions to support its future.

On March 6, 1909, after statehood, the State Legislature of Oklahoma passed an act providing for the creation and location of Northeastern State Normal School at Tahlequah, Oklahoma for the training of teachers. For this purpose, it purchased from the Cherokee Tribal Government the building, land, and equipment of the Cherokee Female Seminary.

In 1921, the name was changed to Northeastern State Teachers College as it had expanded to a full four-year curriculum. In the 1950s Northeastern emerged as a comprehensive state college, broadening its curriculum at the baccalaureate level to encompass liberal arts subjects and adding a fifth-year program designed to prepare master teachers for elementary and secondary schools.

With addition of graduate-degree programs, in 1974, the Oklahoma Legislature authorized changing the name of the institution from Northeastern State College to Northeastern Oklahoma State University; in 1985 it authorized a change in name to Northeastern State University. In 1979, NSU opened its College of Optometry.

In the early 21st century, NSU is the fourth-largest university in Oklahoma. On March 6, 2009, NSU celebrated its centennial with Founders Day celebrations.

==Campus life==
===Campus organizations===
There are several campus organizations such as NAB (Northeastern Activities Board), NSUSF (Northeastern State University Student Foundation), and NSGA (Northeastern Student Government Association) that provide alternate activities, usually free of charge for students to enjoy on campus. The NSGA is the official organization to represent the students of NSU. The purpose of the NSGA is to establish a representative student government and to provide a forum for student&#x27;s views and ideas for the purpose of promoting and representing the students of NSU. RHA caters to on-campus residents and hosts such annual events as &quot;Welcome Week Luau,&quot; Freshman Move-in Day, Mardi Gras, and &quot;Resident Round-up&quot;.

====Greek life====
Northeastern State University has several fraternities and sororities located on the Tahlequah campus.

===Jazz Lab===
Created in 1993, the Jazz Lab is the site of the jazz program offices and classes. The university offers a Bachelor of Arts in Music with a major in Jazz Studies and has two student jazz ensembles, as well as several different combo groups ranging in style from fusion to Latin to straight ahead. The NSU Jazz Ensemble performs with regional, national, and international guest artists at the Jazz Lab every year. 

== Branch campuses ==

=== Muskogee ===
NSU&#x27;s Muskogee campus was opened in 1993 as a facility located on . The campus offers upper-level and graduate courses in education, business, general studies, nursing, and industrial management. In 2001 the NSU Muskogee opened the Mike Synar Center in honor of Mike Synar, former U.S. Congressman from the 2nd District of Oklahoma from 1979 to 1995. The Mike Synar Center is a facility that is used for offices and classrooms. The center also houses the Master of Business Administration and the Bachelor of Science in Nursing program for the campus.

=== Broken Arrow ===
NSU&#x27;s Broken Arrow campus was opened in 2002 with a little over 1,000 students. Funding for the campus came from a one-half percent sales tax which was approved by Broken Arrow voters. The first phase of the campus included an administration building, a maintenance facility, and two classroom buildings. In 2004 the campus began a $26 million expansion made possible by Tulsa County&#x27;s Vision 2025, which also funded Tulsa&#x27;s new BOK Center. The expansion doubled the size of the campus and also allowed room for up to another 5,000 students. It also added a library along with science and classroom buildings. Construction was completed in the fall of 2007.

<text>The wide-gamut RGB color space (or Adobe Wide Gamut RGB) is a color space developed by Adobe Systems, that offers a large gamut by using pure spectral primary colors.
It is able to store a wider range of color values than sRGB or Adobe RGB color spaces. As a comparison, the wide-gamut RGB color space encompasses 77.6% of the visible colors specified by the CIELAB color space, while the standard Adobe RGB color space covers just 52.1% and sRGB covers only 35.9%.

When working in color spaces with such a large gamut, it is recommended to work in 16-bit per channel color depth to avoid posterization effects. This will occur more frequently in 8-bit per channel modes as the gradient steps are much larger.

As with sRGB, the color component values in wide-gamut RGB are not proportional to the luminances. Similar to Adobe RGB, a gamma of 2.2 is assumed, without the linear segment near zero that is present in sRGB. The precise gamma value is 563/256, or 2.19921875.

The white point corresponds to D50.
The chromaticities of the primary colors and the white point are as follows:

<doc id="915216" wikidata="Q5105286" url="?curid=915216" title="Chorus of Westerly">
<text>The Chorus of Westerly is a 190-voice chorus based in Westerly, Rhode Island. It is one of the few choruses in the United States that has children singing alongside adults for every performance of its season (regardless of work or difficulty). Members of the chorus come from all over Rhode Island and southeastern Connecticut, with some members coming from as far as Bristol, Middlesex and Norfolk counties in Massachusetts. As part of its typical season, the chorus will present two &quot;classical&quot; concert series (one in November and one in May), a series of Christmas Pops concerts in December, seven performances of &quot;A Celebration of Twelfth Night&quot; in January (a musical and theatrical event based on an originally written stage play set in medieval times), a guest choral ensemble in February, an &#x27;a cappella&#x27; concert series in March, and Summer Pops, a large outdoor performance held in Westerly&#x27;s Wilcox Park for audiences of 25,000 each June. For its classical and pops events, the Chorus performs with professional orchestral musicians from the Boston Musicians Association and from across Rhode Island.

Over its fifty-seven seasons, the Chorus of Westerly has performed many of the most important choral works ever written, from J.S. Bach&#x27;s Mass in B Minor to William Walton&#x27;s Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast. In recent seasons, the chorus has performed Duruflé&#x27;s Requiem, Mozart&#x27;s Mass in C Minor, Vaughan Williams&#x27; Hodie, and Honegger&#x27;s King David. The chorus has also given the American premiere performance of several British choral works of the past century. This list includes &quot;Songs of the Fleet&quot; by Charles Villiers Stanford, &quot;Lux Aeterna&quot; by William Mathias, &quot;Birthday Madrigals&quot; by John Rutter, &quot;Mass of the Sea&quot; by Paul Patterson and several other works of George Dyson, Patrick Hadley and Gilbert Vinters.

In the summer months, the chorus holds a series of choral workshops, open to the public to participate, at Camp Ogontz in Lyman, NH. The sessions have been directed over the past two decades by Richard Marlow (former organist and choirmaster of Trinity College, Cambridge), Sir David Willcocks (former choirmaster of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge and The Bach Choir, London), Herbert Bock, and most recently by David Hill (of the BBC Singers, the Bach Choir) and James Litton (former director of the American Boychoir). In August, a special workshop week of singing is held at Ogontz is specifically for the children and teenagers of the Chorus to help prepare them for the upcoming season of music.

The chorus has toured five times internationally, including two tours to Great Britain, one tour to Italy, one tour to Hungary, Austria and the Czech Republic, and most recently, in Germany. As part of its tours, the chorus has performed in Westminster Abbey, King&#x27;s College Chapel, Canterbury Cathedral, the cathedrals of Milan and Florence, Saint Mark&#x27;s Basilica (Venice), Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica at the Vatican (including the singing of high mass), and performed the Dvořák Requiem with the Westminster Choir as part the closing concert of the 1987 Spoleto Festival of Two Worlds. The chorus toured Hungary, Austria, and the Czech Republic in July 2014, performing the Dvořák Stabat Mater. In 2017, the chorus toured Germany, performing Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Mass in B minor.

Since 1969, the chorus has rehearsed and performed in what is now the George Kent Performance Hall (the former Immaculate Conception Church building of Westerly). The building (and its main nave/hall), renowned for its exceptional acoustics, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. From 1889 through 1969, Kent Hall was Westerly&#x27;s Immaculate Conception Church. From the mid-1970s through 1990, the building was home to the Westerly Center for the Arts. When the Center for the Arts organization folded in 1991, the chorus purchased the building and renamed it the Chorus of Westerly Performance Hall. In September 2005, the chorus completed a $2.5 million renovation and expansion project on the facility thanks to the support of a community capital campaign. The facility was rededicated at that time as the George Kent Performance Hall.

==Summer Pops Westerly==
Since 1981, the Chorus of Westerly has presented and performed in one of Rhode Island&#x27;s largest free outdoor music events, Summer Pops. Held in Westerly&#x27;s Wilcox Park, an historic Victorian strolling park operated by the Westerly Public Library, the event annually attracts over 25,000 annual residents. The program features an hour-long pre-show event featuring local musicians and dancers followed by the main program featuring the entire Chorus, 55 members of the Pops Festival Orchestra, the Newport Artillery, church bells from the local Episcopal church, and a fireworks show by the Grucci Company of Long Island. Summer Pops was started as both a send off and thank you concert prior to the ensemble&#x27;s 1981 concert tour to Great Britain. Because of its local popularity and early success, the Chorus of Westerly has continued to present the program at the start of summer (usually in late June) every year since 1981.

==Leadership==
The Chorus of Westerly was founded in 1959 by George Kent. Kent served as music and artistic director for 53 seasons before retiring in June 2012. After a national search in the 2011-12 season, former Chorus child singer Andrew Howell was appointed the organization&#x27;s second music director. Howell began his post as music director in July 2012.

Ryan Saunders, another former child singer of the chorus, has served as the organization&#x27;s managing executive director since July 2009.

<doc id="915220" wikidata="Q4121358" url="?curid=915220" title="University of Nebraska State Museum">
<text>The University of Nebraska State Museum, also known as Morrill Hall, founded in 1871, is a natural history museum featuring Nebraska biodiversity, paleontology, and cultural diversity, located on the University of Nebraska–Lincoln City Campus near the corner of 14th and Vine Streets in Lincoln, Nebraska, United States.
The museum houses Mueller Planetarium, a hands-on science discovery center, and the Elephant Hall, where visitors can see the world&#x27;s largest articulated fossil mammoth among the collection of fossil elephants. Also featured are interactive paleontology exhibits, a dinosaur gallery, ancient life and evolution exhibits, wildlife dioramas, gems and minerals, American Indian and African exhibits, and a temporary exhibit gallery featuring rotating displays on diverse topics including photography, quilts and fine arts.

== History ==

The University of Nebraska State Museum was founded in 1871 by Erwin Barbour, the same year the University of Nebraska was established. The museums first home was two rooms located in Nebraska Hall. The first collections were recorded to be skeletons of a horse and a cow. In 1891, Erwin Barbour went on an expedition in search of fossils and minerals to contribute to the museum&#x27;s empty cases. Barbour discovered a new fossil, Daimonelix. His contribution caught the attention of Charles Morrill in 1892. When Morrill learned Barbour&#x27;s trip was not funded by the university, he donated $1,000 for the next expedition to keep the collections growing. Morrill continued to donate money to the museum throughout his life, which in turn allowed Barbour to send out over one hundred expeditions. Morrill Hall, the museums location since 1927, was dedicated to Charles Morrill for his contributions.

The museum has three floors filled with exhibits. The first floor has a theme of Biodiversity and includes The Hall of Nebraska Wildlife, Darwin: A Life of Discovery, Dr Paul and Betty Marx Science Discovery Center, and an Educators Resource Center. The first floor has exhibits about Paleontology of Nebraska. Elephant Hall, Ralph Muller Planetarium, Bizarre Beasts, Toren Gallery of Ancient Life, Mesozoic Gallery, Fossil Animals, and a Discovery Shop are found on this floor. The third floor of the museum houses a variety of exhibits including Explore Evolution, Jurassic Dinosaurs, Rocks and Minerals, Weapons Throughout time, and First People of the Plains. Cooper Gallery, which displays temporary exhibits, is also found on the third floor.

== Buildings ==
The University of Nebraska State Museum was first located in University Hall. Nebraska Hall was built in 1888 to make room for growing exhibits and enrollment in the university. In 1905, Charles Morrill wrote a letter expressing concerns with Nebraska Hall&#x27;s structure and limited space. His proposal for a new building was granted. It was complete in 1908. The new building caught fire on March 6, 1912, causing major damage to the building and contents of the museum. The building was restored and served as the museum until 1927 when Morrill Hall was built. Morrill Hall was constructed based on the information gathered by Charles Morrill and Erwin Barbour&#x27;s tour of museums in Europe in 1909. On May 28, 1927, Morrill Hall was dedicated to Charles Morrill for his contributions to the Museum.

== Exhibits ==

=== Paleontology of Nebraska ===

Located on the main floor of the museum, the Paleontology of Nebraska exhibits include the Elephant Hall, Mesozoic Gallery, Fossil Animals, Toren Gallery of Ancient Life. These exhibits display various fossil collections. The museum is known for its vast vertebrate paleontology collection, ranking fifth in the nation. The museum has been gathering its paleontology collections since 1891, when the Director Erwin Barbour began to excavate fossils from Western Nebraska. So far, more than 85,000 vertebrate species have been cataloged. Most of the collections originate from Nebraska. The collections from the Pleistocene and Cretaceous are from New Mexico and Montana, respectively.
The Elephant Hall is famous for having one of the largest mammoth skeletons in the world. Among them, the museum hosts the largest Columbian mammoth fossil in the world, known as &quot;Archie.&quot; It is also the state fossil of Nebraska. Along with the mammoth skeletons, the Hall displays skeletons and models of elephants of various eras. By comparing the structure of the skeletons and the elephants&#x27; teeth, visitors can learn about the evolutionary history of the elephants.

The Mesozoic Gallery features skeletons and models of organisms that lived during the Mesozoic era. Along with the fossils of the dinosaurs, the Gallery is famous for its Plesiosaur fossil that was excavated in 2004 from Northeast Nebraska, which is known to be one of the longest marine fossil. The Toren Gallery of Ancient Life includes models of organisms of the Paleozoic era.

The Fossil Animals section displays ancient and current skeletons of rhinos, horses, and camels. Recent donations to the museum are also shown in this area.

=== Tree of Life ===
Officially opened on February 22, 2013, the Tree of Life exhibit is a relatively recent addition to the museum. It was developed in partnership with Harvard University, Northwestern University, The University of Michigan, and the University of Nebraska–Lincoln. This exhibit combines interactive touchscreen technology with a vast phylogenetic database to provide a fun educational experience for users of all ages. Museum visitors can browse an evolutionary tree showing the evolutionary relationships of more than 70,000 species over 3.5 billion years. It is often difficult to spur an interest in evolutionary concepts, especially in a museum. Since visitors can browse exhibits rather quickly, the Tree of Life exhibit is designed to hold the attention of users. Once a user is actively using the interactive technology, they are more likely to spend enough time to gain a substantial understanding of core ideas in evolutionary science. The University of Nebraska State Museum has incorporated the Tree of Life exhibit into some undergraduate biology courses.

=== Weapons Throughout Time ===
Weapons Throughout Time showcases a large collection of artifacts collected over the years. Officially opened in October 2009, it is one of the older exhibits in the museum. As the name suggests, the bulk of items in the collection were used as tools of survival and combat. Some pieces in the collection include stone arrowheads used by Native Americans in the Great Plains, Amazonian blow darts, Zulu hunting spears, Japanese and Samoan armor, and firearms from Asia, the Middle East, and the Western hemisphere. These artifacts give visitors insight into the culture of the people that created them, and the cultural differences are evident in the artistic design. Some items are over 9,000 years old.

=== Explore Evolution ===
The Explore Evolution exhibit was opened in September 2005. It was designed to educate the public about important evolutionary concepts using the work of several evolutionary scientists. The scientists whose work is included within the exhibit are: Charles Wood, Sherily Fritz and Edward Theriot, Cameron Currie, Kenneth Kaneshiro, Rosemary and Peter Grant, Svante Paabo and Henrik Kaessmann, and Philip Gingerich. This exhibit simplifies and reinforces the work of the scientists mentioned above using videos, models, and interactive components. Although it is designed to stimulate curiosity in young museum visitors, the Explore Evolution exhibit contains vast stores of information that will keep even the most educated evolutionary scientist interested.

=== Hall of Nebraska Wildlife ===
The Hall of Nebraska Wildlife exhibit offers a collection of wildlife dioramas that allow visitors to appreciate animals, birds, and plants from different Nebraskan regions. One component of this exhibit includes an installed modern &quot;Bison bison,&quot; a presumed descendant of the Nebraskan Ice Age &quot;Bison antiquus,&quot; an extinct species since 4,000–5,000 years ago. Additionally, in February 2008, the Nebraskan State Museum installed its first mountain lion provided by the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission after it was struck and killed by traffic on Interstate 80. Chemical analysis of the mountain lion&#x27;s claws suggests it had traveled from the Black Hills of South Dakota along the Missouri or Elkhorn Rivers. The exhibit also displays African animals that fall on the Red List of Threatened Animals, a compiled list of all threatened animals. A few shown animals include the &quot;Kobus ellipsiprymnus&quot; (Swimming Waterbuck), a medium-sized antelope that is at a &quot;lower risk,&quot; and the &quot;Diceros bicornis&quot; (Black Rhinoceros) who are now &quot;critically endangered&quot; due to overhunting.

=== Mueller Planetarium ===
Mueller Planetarium was a gift to the university from Ralph S. Mueller, a Cleveland industrialist and inventor of the alligator clip. The planetarium was completed and dedicated in 1958, becoming the first planetarium in Nebraska. More than 20,000 people attended shows at the planetarium during its first six months of operation.

Jack Dunn hosted the planetarium&#x27;s first laser light show featuring electronic music using a car speaker surround system and two slide projectors in 1977. Visually impaired audiences brought to attention that it was difficult to see the stars projected during laser shows, and the Mueller Planetarium began working to improve the quality of the show. The &quot;laser star show&quot; developed specifically for the visually impaired became an official project of the International Laser Display Association (ILDA) in 1993, and the program was shared internationally with laser display companies. Through working with Hayden by ILDA of California, the show was optimized using a high-contrast dots and lines display to aid the visually impaired. Mueller Planetarium received a First Place Award for Outstanding Laser Display in November 1993.
In 2006, Dunn intensified the light show by installing a full-dome system using spherical mirrors that project shows across the 30-foot-wide dome. As of 2016, the Mueller Planetarium still offers laser light shows along with informational shows depicting the solar system and Nebraskan night skies.

== Community involvement ==
The University of Nebraska State Museum offers educational community events that allow a closer view of natural processes. The Planetarium offers informational shows that are geared towards younger ages, introducing children to the solar system, and shows that contain complex information understood more easily by adults. In addition, the University of Nebraska State Museum offers rotating hands-on activities for a range of younger ages. During the month of December 2016, an interactive &quot;Augmented Reality Watershed Table&quot; aims to promote freshwater ecosystem understanding and stewardship by allowing visitors to create topography models by shaping sand that is graphically projected from overhead and interacting with the &quot;ecosystem&quot; by stimulating water and rainfall. Also during December 2016, the University of Nebraska State Museum will hold &quot;Sunday with a Junior Scientist,&quot; where middle schoolers from Lincoln are able to present their science projects to museum visitors.

The University of Nebraska State Museum is also involved in research pertaining to anthropology, botany, entomology, vertebrate and invertebrate paleontology, zoology, and parasitology. From 2007 to 2015, the State Museum partnered with biomedical researchers, artists, educators, writers, and youth to create a public campaign aimed at expanding diverse audiences&#x27; knowledge about microbes and infectious disease. Artists created comic strips that proved to be more student-interactive than standard textbooks, and through the Omaha Science Media Project, students and teachers were offered a two-week immersion experience at virology research labs at the Nebraska Center for Virology and the University of Nebraska Medical Center. Here, teachers and students researched viruses and were able to broadcast their laboratory experiences through collaboration with Nebraska Public Television, University of Nebraska School of Journalism, and Soundprint Media, Inc.

A Roman road passes close by, on the south side of the Avon Water; it led to the Roman fort at Loudoun Hill near Darvel. The origins of Strathaven Castle are obscure, but it is believed to have been held by the Bairds until after the end of the Wars of Scottish Independence in 1357. It then passed to William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas in 1370.

The settlement within the lands of Strathaven became a burgh of barony in 1450. The centre of the town is occupied by the market square, formerly a grassed common, and still known as Common Green, or just &#x27;The Green&#x27;. Linking the town and the castle is the old &#x27;Boo Backit Brig&#x27; (&#x27;bow-backed bridge&#x27;), a small arched bridge.

The Old Parish Church, with its landmark spire, was built in 1772, and was the place of worship of the Dukes of Hamilton, who had a section of the church reserved for them.

The town played a significant part in the Radical War of 1820, when James Wilson led a band of radicals on a march to Glasgow, to join a rumoured general uprising, which never actually happened. Wilson was hanged for treason.

Its most famous &#x27;modern&#x27; resident was the singer, Sir Harry Lauder (1870–1950) whose mansion, Lauder Ha&#x27;, or Hall, remains in the town&#x27;s Lethame neighbourhood, the estate&#x27;s entrance leading from the road to Kilmarnock. Sir Harry spent the Second World War years there, and died in February 1950.

Dungavel House on the outskirts of Strathaven was the place where German Deputy Führer, Rudolf Hess, originally intended to land on the evening of 10 May 1941 in a misguided attempt to seek peace talks with the Duke of Hamilton. However bad weather and poor navigation resulted in Hess having to land at Floors Farm in Eaglesham.

In 2002, Strathaven was granted the title of Scotland&#x27;s First Fairtrade Town (jointly with Aberfeldy) under the leadership of Paulo Quadros, chair of the first Fairtrade group in Scotland.

==Governance==
The town is part of the Avondale and Stonehouse ward of the South Lanarkshire council area. Before 1996, it was part of the Strathclyde region, with a district council in East Kilbride. Previous to that, it had been part of the Fourth landward district of the County of Lanark.

As of the 2024 UK General Election, Strathaven is represented in Westminster by the East Kilbride and Strathaven Labour MP, Joani Reid. In Holyrood, the town is represented by Clydesdale constituency SNP MSP Màiri McAllan.

==Long-established business==
The town&#x27;s longest established business is Gebbie &amp; Wilson, Solicitors in the Common Green, which was founded by William Gebbie in 1816. Local bakery Alexander Taylor is the longest-established bakery in Scotland. Opened in 1820, the business is operated by the sixth generation of the Taylor family.

== Landmarks ==

The major landmark in the town is Strathaven Castle. Beside the castle lies the Town Mill. Built in 1650 at the behest of William, the 2nd Duke of Hamilton, the mill remained in operation until production ceased in 1966. The building, after having undergone repairs and refurbishment since its time in use as a mill, now operates as an Arts and Heritage centre. Strathaven Public Hall was designed by Alexander Cullen and completed in 1896.

Between the town and nearby village Sandford lie the Spectacle E&#x27;e (Lallans word for &#x27;eye&#x27;) falls. The falls are named so for a local tale of a tryst between a young man and the miller&#x27;s daughter. The miller disapproved of the young man, finding him unworthy of his daughter&#x27;s company, and decidedly put an end to the affair. In retaliation, the young man is said to have placed an eye glass in the thatched roof of the mill, thus, through the refracted sunlight, the mill was set ablaze. Ruins of the mill exist today around the waterfall. The falls are accessible by a trail leading from Lesmahagow Road.

Strathaven has two public parks which are adjoined by a bridge over the Powmillon Burn. The lower of the two is the John Hastie Park, named for a local businessman who left a sum in his will to the town for the provision of funds for the park and the former museum which are named in his honour. The higher of the two is the George Allan Park which features a boating pond, an ornate cast-iron bandstand installed in 1902 and a miniature railway. Dating back to 1949, the railway is the oldest of its kind in Scotland. The park is named for the son of local Reverend James Allan whose son, George, was involved in a fatal sporting accident aged only 13. The Reverend Allan donated the funds necessary for the park&#x27;s foundation which was then named in his son&#x27;s honour.

== Transport ==
The A71, which connects Edinburgh and Irvine passes through the town. The A723 links Strathaven to Hamilton and the A726 links it to East Kilbride, and further onto Glasgow. As part of South Lanarkshire, the town is in the Strathclyde Partnership for Transport area.

=== Former railway stations ===

Strathaven had, at various times, three railway stations.
* , the first station, was the terminus of the Hamilton and Strathaven Railway. The railway was taken over by the Caledonian Railway; and the station closed in 1964.
* , a terminal station on the Hamilton and Strathaven Branch of the Caledonian Railway, opened in October 1904, closed temporarily during World War I; and closed completely in 1953.
* , on the Darvel and Strathaven Railway closed in June 1964 to services from the east, although the line to Darvel closed in 1939.

=== Strathaven Airfield ===

Strathaven Airfield is home to a microlight flying school, which operates both the traditional-style weightshift microlights and the light aircraft-style ones, and the new airfield manager&#x27;s house was featured on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Grand Designs&quot; in October 2013. There are approximately 35 aircraft – both light aircraft and microlights – hangared at Strathaven in two modern purpose-built hangars. The airfield is also home to an annual local music festival, HangarFest. The airfield was set up on the old Couplaw Farm, which The Scottish Flying Club Ltd bought in May 1964. The club had begun flying in 1927 at the old Renfrew Airport but was left homeless after Renfrew was nationalised in 1946. Strathaven Airfield was given to the RAF Benevolent Fund in 1974 and then sold privately in 2005. It has three grass runways, the main runway is oriented 09/27 (east-west) and is 530 m long (with a 100 m starter extension on 27 available on request). The airfield co-ordinates in the UK Air Pilot ENR 5.5-17 are: 554049N 0040654W.

== Education ==
There are 7 primary schools in and around Strathaven, Chapelton Primary School, Gilmourton Primary School, Kirklandpark Primary School, Sandford Primary School, St Patrick&#x27;s Primary School and Wester Overton Primary School

Strathaven Academy is the town&#x27;s only secondary school.

== Religion ==

Strathaven contains six churches including three Church of Scotland parishes: Avendale Old (built in 1772) linked with Drumclog Parish Church, Strathaven Rankin linked with Chapelton Parish Church, and East Parish Church (built in 1777) linked with Glassford Parish Church.

The town&#x27;s only Roman Catholic church is St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church. The Parish was founded in 1859 to serve the growing Catholic population of Avondale following migration from Highland and Irish communities following the Clearances and the Great Famine. The current church building was constructed in 1901, paid for by then Archbishop Charles Eyre. The older, original church building now serves as the parish hall.

The ecumenical body &quot;Hope Strathaven&quot; consists of six churches in the area, which work together bringing a mix of community projects.

The Rt Rev Dr Shaw Paterson, minister at Strathaven Trinity Parish Church of Scotland, was elected to be Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for 2024-2025.

==Sport==
Strathaven is home to several sports clubs, which include Strathaven Rugby Club which has a 3G, all-weather pitch.

==Culture==

Strathaven Hotel houses a small seated venue holding acoustic music gigs under the title FRETS. Artists performing have included Arab Strap, Norman Blake and Euros Childs, Lloyd Cole, Altered Images, Robyn Hitchcock and Michael Head.

The town is host to Scotland&#x27;s only hot air balloon festival. Held each August since 1999, the event attracts pilots and enthusiasts from across Europe.

In the Third Statistical Account of Scotland, County of Lanark, the Reverend C. Arthur Robertson, writing in 1953, quotes from the diary of a John McGowan, a native Strathavonian himself writing in Minnesota, U.S.A. c.1810 wherein is described some of Strathaven&#x27;s folkloric history, &quot;A small natural rock situated about a mile south of the town of Strathaven on the north bank of the River Avon in the parish of Avondale. Its curious form and romantic situation - with surrounding rocks rising abruptly and forming an amphitheatre about forty yards distant from it - give it the air of something grand and majestic. This little hill is covered with a slight coat of earth and planted with a few scotch firs, and the surrounding rocks are also covered with trees, forming a square on the north-east side of the Dabbie Dancie.

The hill itself is about 40 ft. high and 40 yds. long, is it oval form, within 30 yds. of the bed of the Avon, and was supposed to be the haunt of a water kelpy in the dark ages of romance, superstition and ignorance. The appearance of this beautiful little mount would give a stranger such ideas. This suggests to my mind the story which I heard in early life.

&#x27;On a stormy afternoon, as a cow-herd was gathering his cattle for home, he heard a voice more than human, just at the site of this old mount (the waters of the Avon were rising rapidly), call out, &#x27;Carry me from Dabbie Dancie into Winkins Waas&#x27;. Which Winkin Waas is a rock placed on the other side of the Avon. This mount too, it is said, has the honour of Scots laws and ancient rites and superstitions delivered here by chiefs, and so public justice executed.&#x27;&quot;

<text>The Cathedral of the Incarnation is an Episcopal cathedral in Garden City, New York. It is the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island.

Built to the memory of Alexander Turney Stewart, the Cathedral of the Incarnation is the only cathedral in the United States funded by a single person, and the only one that is built in memory of a single individual. The cathedral is a product of Gothic Revival architecture.
The cathedral is historically known for its music ministry, led by Canon Lawrence Tremsky (Northwestern University, M.M.). The Men &amp; Boys Choir, which originated during the 19th century, was the reason that the train station in the area was initially constructed - to transport the boys from their homes in Brooklyn or Manhattan to rehearsals and services. During the 1930s, the cathedral formed the first American cathedral girls&#x27; choir - known as the Schola Cantorum. The choirs sing a repertoire of choral music, from plainsong to modern works, selected carefully to coincide with the themes of the season. Evensong is sung on the first Sunday of each month in the traditional English cathedral model (&quot;Magnificat, Nunc Dimittis&quot;, an anthem, and Anglican chant psalms). Special seasonal liturgies include traditional &quot;Lessons &amp; Carols&quot; one or two Sundays before Christmas.
The cathedral is notable for its stained glass windows and icons. The mural icon of Christ Pantokrator, permanently installed at the cathedral, was crafted by the American artist Guillermo Esparza.

A new organ was constructed by the firm Casavant Frères Limitée in 1986 on the 110th anniversary of the death of A. T. Stewart.

Tours are offered upon request, as well as the cathedral being open from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm (Wednesday - Sunday).

There are a variety of services held throughout the weekday noon services Tuesday - Thursday, Sundays, 8:00am Traditional Mass, the Family Mass at 9:15 (held outdoors during the summer under the tent, and is pet-friendly) and the 11:15 Choral Eucharist featuring music by the cathedral choirs (10am Sung Mass during the summer).

<text>Dartmouth College is host to many fraternities and sororities, and a significant percentage of the undergraduate student body is active in Greek life. In the fall of 2022, 35 percent of male students belong to a fraternity and 36 percent of students belong to a sorority. Greek organizations at Dartmouth provide both social and residential opportunities for students and are the only single-sex residential option on campus. Greek organizations at Dartmouth do not provide dining options, as regular meal service has been banned in Greek houses since 1909.

Social fraternities at Dartmouth College grew out of a tradition of student literary societies that began in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The first social fraternities were founded in 1842 and rapidly expanded to include the active participation of over half of the student body. Fraternities at Dartmouth built dedicated residence and meeting halls in the early 1900s and 1920s, and then struggled to survive the lean years of the 1930s. Dartmouth College was among the first higher education institutions to desegregate fraternity houses in the 1950s and was involved in the movement to create coeducational Greek houses in the 1970s. Sororities were introduced to campus in 1977.

As of 2024, Dartmouth College extends official recognition to fifteen all-male fraternities, ten all-female sororities, and three gender-inclusive Greek houses. The Greek houses are largely governed through three independent councils, the Interfraternity Council, the Inter-Sorority Council, and the Gender-Inclusive Greek Council. Dartmouth College has two cultural interest fraternities and two cultural interest sororities, which do not participate in the major governing councils but are member organizations of the National Pan-Hellenic Council. A chapter of the Phi Beta Kappa honor society is active, but there are no active professional fraternity chapters at Dartmouth College. 

== History ==

Social fraternities at Dartmouth College grew out of a tradition of student literary societies that began in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The first such society at Dartmouth, the Social Friends, was formed in 1783. A rival organization, called the United Fraternity, was founded in 1786. A chapter of Phi Beta Kappa was established at Dartmouth in 1787, and counted among its members Daniel Webster, class of 1801. These organizations were, in large part, the only social life available to students at the college. The organizations hosted debates on a variety of topics not encountered in the curriculum of the day and amassed large libraries of titles not found in the official College library. Both Social Friends and the United Fraternity created libraries in Dartmouth Hall and met in a room called Society Hall inside Dartmouth Hall. In 1815, the college intervened in the hotly contested recruitment battle between the Social Friends and the United Fraternity by restricting each society to recruit only from separate halves of the new student class. In 1825, the college began simply assigning new students to one society or the other. Interest in the literary societies declined in the 1830s and 1840s. The college library and instructional curriculum had expanded to include much of what the literary societies had supported, and new Greek letter societies began to appear on campus.

In 1841, two factions of the United Fraternity split off from the literary society. One of the new societies called itself Omega Phi and on May 10, 1842, obtained a charter as the &quot;Zeta chapter&quot; of Psi Upsilon. The other faction to split from the United Fraternity organized itself on July 13, 1842, as Kappa Kappa Kappa, a local fraternity. More Greek organizations were founded, and by 1855, 64% of students, mostly upperclassmen, were members of the Greek letter societies on campus. Initially, the original Greek letter societies would not extend invitations to membership to first-year students. Two Greek letter organizations were created exclusively for freshmen: Kappa Sigma Epsilon and Delta Kappa. These societies would dissolve in 1883 when the fraternities of the upper classes began to pledge freshmen. A chapter of Phi Beta Kappa survived at Dartmouth, but by the 1830s had established its role as a strictly literary society by dropping requirements of secrecy for membership and activities. The new, social Greek organizations distinguished themselves from Phi Beta Kappa and the previous literary societies in several ways. The new fraternities were self-selective and exclusive. Each organization developed its own secret rituals and procedures. Most societies began to invest in creating their meeting halls, either upstairs rooms in buildings on Main Street or free-standing structures near campus. There were eleven active Greek organizations at Dartmouth College in 1900.

=== Expansion of the fraternity system ===

The fortunes of the fraternity system at Dartmouth followed a boom and bust pattern in the early twentieth century. Several organizations purchased frame houses or built their own between 1898 and 1907, including Beta Theta Pi, Kappa Kappa Kappa, Phi Delta Alpha, Psi Upsilon, and Delta Tau Delta. The economic expansion of the 1920s created a boom in the fortunes of the fraternities, allowing many to build new brick residences near campus, including Zeta Psi, Kappa Kappa Kappa, Phi Sigma Kappa, Sigma Nu, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Chi Phi, Theta Delta Chi, Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma Chi, and Gamma Delta Chi. It was during this period that Webster Avenue developed as &quot;fraternity row&quot;. The new residences were built without significant dining facilities, as the Trustees of the college had banned fraternities from serving regular meals in their chapter houses and had limited the number of resident brothers by the fall semester of 1909. College administrators also challenged the fraternities to become more engaged in College life and less focused on their fraternity life during this time. College President Ernest Martin Hopkins personally decided to abolish freshman rush in 1924.
As did the nation, fraternities at Dartmouth went through difficult times during the Great Depression. The decade of the 1930s saw almost no building projects at all in the fraternity system, and many houses could no longer afford regular maintenance. One of the great tragedies at Dartmouth College occurred on a winter night in 1934 when nine members of Theta Chi died from carbon monoxide poisoning after a metal chimney on a dilapidated coal furnace in the basement of the chapter house broke in the night. In 1935, Dartmouth historian and professor Leon Burr Richardson asserted in a survey that, in light of the national suffering, the fraternity chapters should ask themselves if they had &quot;any excuse for existence.&quot; Four fraternities dissolved during the Great Depression (Alpha Sigma Phi, Alpha Tau Omega, Lambda Chi Alpha, and Sigma Alpha Mu), and two (Phi Kappa Sigma and Alpha Chi Rho) merged to pool scarce resources to survive. All of the surviving fraternities closed for the duration of World War II, as the campus was largely (although not exclusively) used to educate, train, and house United States Navy sailors and United States Marine Corps in the V-12 Navy College Training Program.

The fraternities of Dartmouth College were directly involved in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s, expanding and popularizing an issue that had first appeared as a result of WWII where the service branches became largely integrated. In the immediate post-war period, for the first time, poor, as well as minority students sought higher education in significant numbers aided by the GI Bill. Students in the Northeast, the Midwest, and the West were quicker to adopt this cause; southern schools followed. In 1952, Dartmouth&#x27;s &quot;Alpha Theta chapter&quot; of Theta Chi, a group dating to 1921, was derecognized by its nation over a dispute regarding minority membership. The Dartmouth chapter was reorganized as a local fraternity named Alpha Theta. A campus-wide referendum held in 1954 on the issue of desegregation of fraternities resulted in a majority in favor of requiring fraternities on campus to eliminate racially discriminatory membership policies by the year 1960, and to secede from national groups that retained such policies in their charters. This became a binding obligation imposed on the fraternities by the college administration, and several fraternities at Dartmouth dissociated from their national organizations, including the chapters of Phi Sigma Kappa (originally &quot;Tau chapter&quot; (1905)) which withdrew in 1956, Delta Tau Delta (originally &quot;Gamma Gamma chapter&quot; (1901)) which withdrew in 1960, Phi Delta Theta (originally &quot;New Hampshire Alpha chapter&quot; (1884)) which withdrew in 1960, Sigma Chi (originally &quot;Eta Eta chapter&quot; (1892)) which withdrew in 1960, and Sigma Nu (originally &quot;Delta Beta chapter&quot; (1907)) which withdrew in 1963 but has since been re-established. Ironically, these and other national fraternities moved fairly quickly to remove bias clauses, in comparison to other institutions of society; thus the Dartmouth chapters which were at the forefront of agitating for these changes &quot;won the battle&quot;, even as they left their former organizations.

Other national social changes affected Greek societies at Dartmouth in the 1960s and 1970s. Many began to question the value of belonging to a national fraternal organization, spurred perhaps by questions over the cost of national fees or services. The Dartmouth chapters of Alpha Chi Rho (originally &quot;Phi Nu chapter&quot; (1919)) which withdrew in 1963, Chi Phi (originally &quot;Chi chapter&quot; (1902)) which withdrew in 1968, Delta Upsilon (originally &quot;Dartmouth chapter&quot; (1926)) which withdrew in 1966, Phi Gamma Delta (originally &quot;Delta Nu chapter&quot; (1901)) which withdrew in 1965, Phi Kappa Psi (originally &quot;New Hampshire Alpha chapter&quot; (1896)) which withdrew in 1967, and Sigma Phi Epsilon (originally &quot;New Hampshire Alpha chapter&quot; (1909)) which withdrew in 1967, all disaffiliated from their national fraternities in the 1960s. Sigma Phi Epsilon&#x27;s chapter would later re-affiliate with the fraternity in 1981. But during the turbulent late 1960s, fraternities were viewed by many as anachronistic, a theme that culminated in 1967 when the faculty voted 67 to16 to adopt a proposal to abolish fraternities at Dartmouth. This proposal was rejected by the Board of Trustees.

=== Coeducation to the present ===
Coeducation would dramatically change all social life at Dartmouth College, including the fraternity system. The college began admitting women as full-time students in 1972. By the fall of 1973, five local fraternities (Alpha Theta, Foley House, The Tabard, Phi Tau, and Phi Sigma Psi) had all decided to adopt a coeducational membership policy and admit women as full members. The first sorority on campus, Sigma Kappa, was founded in 1977. Many alumni expressed strong concerns that the need for housing for new sororities would inevitably lead to financial pressure and the possible dissolution of existing fraternities at the college. In response, the Trustees imposed a moratorium limiting the campus to six recognized sororities. Converting from an all-male to a coeducational membership policy was not enough to save at least one Greek organization on campus. In 1981, the Harold Parmington Foundation reorganized itself as a new coeducational fraternity Delta Psi Delta. Still, the organization never attracted many new members and was finally forced to dissolve in the spring of 1991. In addition, Foley House disassociated from the Greek system in the fall of 1984, transitioning into an affinity house as part of the college&#x27;s residential living programs. It moved off Webster Avenue to a new location on West Street (where it is still in operation ).

During the 1980s and 1990s, college administrators introduced new initiatives to hold the Greek organizations on campus more accountable for their actions and to offer more social alternatives to the predominantly single-sex Greek system. In 1982, the administration announced that Greek organizations would have to comply with &quot;minimum standards&quot;, enforced through annual reviews, to remain in good standing with the college. These standards included health and safety regulations regarding the conditions of the Greek houses and requirements for Greek-sponsored activities deemed beneficial to the college community at large. The college introduced Undergraduate Societies to campus in 1993, as a residential and social alternative to Greek organizations. Similar to the Greek houses in many respects, Undergraduate Societies were required to have open, coeducational membership policies. Panarchy voted to change its status to an undergraduate society and was joined the following year by a newly formed society, called Amarna. In the fall of 1993, Student Assembly President Andrew Beebe, class of 1993, argued in favor of the coeducation of the entire Greek system in his remarks at fall Convocation. During that same academic term, College President James O. Freedman predicted that the Greek system at Dartmouth would be coeducational within 10 years.

In 1999, the college administration announced a &quot;Residential and Social Life Initiative&quot; to improve campus life. Speculation that all single-sex fraternities and sororities would be required to adopt coeducational membership policies led to intense campus debate. In a survey conducted by &quot;The Dartmouth&quot; newspaper, 49% of the student body responded, and 83% of those respondents were in favor of retaining a single-sex Greek system at Dartmouth. In 2005, the school stated that 1,785 students were members of a fraternity, sorority, or gender-inclusive Greek house, comprising about 43 percent of all students, or about 60 percent of the eligible student body. In a December 2006 interview, College President Jim Wright admitted that it had been &quot;a serious mistake&quot; to announce the Student Life Initiative in the manner in which it was presented to the campus, but expressed that in his opinion, &quot;the Greek system at Dartmouth now is stronger than it&#x27;s ever been.&quot;

In the fall of 2022, 35 percent of male students belong to a fraternity and 36 percent of students belong to a sorority.

== Fraternities ==
The single-sex male-only fraternities at Dartmouth College are largely organized and represented by the college through the Interfraternity Council (IFC). The Interfraternity Council is a student-led governance organization that assists its member Greek organizations with finances, public relations, programming, judicial administration, recruitment, and academic achievement. Alpha Phi Alpha is not a member of the IFC, but is a member of the National Pan-Hellenic Council.
Lambda Upsilon Lambda is also not a member of the IFC, but is a member of the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations.

=== Alpha Phi Alpha ===
The &quot;Theta Zeta chapter&quot; of Alpha Phi Alpha () was founded as the first historically African-American fraternity at Dartmouth College in 1972. The first members of the fraternity traveled to Boston, Massachusetts on the weekends of the 1971 spring academic term to attend pledge events at the &quot;Sigma chapter&quot;. The Dartmouth chapter was chartered as the 381st chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha on May 12, 1972. Early chapter meetings on campus were held in both the Choates dormitories and Cutter-Shabazz Hall. The fraternity secured its own house in 1982, a duplex structure that, since renovated, today houses the Delta Delta Delta sorority. Facing smaller membership, the fraternity decided to relocate to a smaller house near the western end of Webster Avenue in the late 1980s, and in 1992, the fraternity again relocated to College-owned apartment housing. The Dartmouth chapter of Alpha Phi Alpha sponsors an annual step performance known as the Green Key StepShow. Notable alumni of the chapter include National Football League all-star Reggie Williams, class of 1976, and former executive vice president of baseball operations in Major League Baseball, Jimmie Lee Solomon, class of 1978.

=== Alpha Chi Alpha ===
Alpha Chi Alpha (), commonly called Alpha Chi&quot;,&quot; was founded in 1956 as the &quot;Phi Nu chapter&quot; of Alpha Chi Rho, a national fraternal organization. A previous &quot;Phi Nu chapter&quot; of Alpha Chi Rho at Dartmouth had merged with the &quot;Kappa chapter&quot; of Phi Kappa Sigma in 1935 to become Gamma Delta Chi, a local fraternity still in existence at Dartmouth. The second &quot;Phi Nu chapter&quot; of Alpha Chi Rho is unrelated to the first chapter. The men of Alpha Chi Rho again broke away from the national group in 1963 and became a local fraternity named Alpha Chi Alpha. The Dartmouth chapter objected to a clause in the national fraternity organization&#x27;s constitution that required all Alpha Chi Rho brothers to &quot;accept Jesus as their lord and savior.&quot; The land and houses used by the Alpha Chi Alpha fraternity are owned by the college. Dartmouth invested $1.3 million in renovations completed in the fall of 2004, which included the razing of the &quot;Barn&quot; structure that was used as social space by the brothers of Alpha Chi Alpha to make way for a newly expanded basement and main floor area. Renovations on the Alpha Chi Alpha physical plant were completed in 2005.

=== Beta Alpha Omega ===

Beta Alpha Omega (), commonly called Beta, is a local fraternity that was founded and recognized in the fall of 2008.

Beta Alpha Omega is located at 6 Webster Avenue on Dartmouth College&#x27;s campus. It is home to over 90 undergrads, known for their diverse interests in athletics, leadership, community, and campus life. Dartmouth Beta is not a national fraternity and no longer retains an affiliation with Beta Theta Pi. Notable alumni include MLB pitcher and World Series champion Kyle Hendricks &#x27;11.

In July 2024, student and Beta Alpha Omega member Won Jang was found dead in the Connecticut River after having attended a social gathering between Beta and the Alpha Phi sorority. Dartmouth College has suspended Beta Alpha Omega and Alpha Phi.

=== Bones Gate ===

Bones Gate, known as BG, was founded in 1901 as the &quot;Gamma Gamma chapter&quot; of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity. In 1960 the &quot;Gamma Gamma chapter&quot; dissociated from Delta Tau Delta when the national organization sought to officially bar minorities from membership. The new local fraternity at Dartmouth went unnamed until 1962, when the brothers adopted the name Bones Gate after an English tavern well known to the members.

=== Gamma Delta Chi ===

Gamma Delta Chi ( or GDX) can trace its history to two fraternities on the Dartmouth College campus, Phi Kappa Sigma and Alpha Chi Rho. Gamma Delta Epsilon, a local fraternity, was founded in 1908, disbanded in 1912, but was reformed in 1921. In 1928, the Gamma Delta Epsilon house sought to establish itself as a chapter of a national fraternity and obtained a charter from the Phi Kappa Sigma national fraternity, becoming its &quot;Kappa chapter&quot;. Epsilon Kappa Alpha was established as a local fraternity on the Dartmouth campus in 1915. As with Gamma Delta Epsilon, Epsilon Kappa Alpha sought to become a chapter of a national fraternity and was granted a charter as the &quot;Phi Nu chapter&quot; of Alpha Chi Rho in 1918. The Dartmouth chapters of Alpha Chi Rho and Phi Kappa Sigma found themselves in similar financial situations in 1934. Both chapters owned prime lots near campus that lacked adequate residential structures. The two fraternities decided to share their resources and in 1935 merged to become a new local fraternity, Gamma Delta Chi. The lot formerly owned by Alpha Chi Rho was sold to the Church of Christ at Dartmouth where a new church building was constructed, and the revenue from the land sale supported the construction of a new house at Gamma Delta Chi&#x27;s current location. (The Alpha Chi Rho national fraternity would later re-establish a &quot;Phi Nu chapter&quot; at Dartmouth in 1956 as a separate fraternity from Gamma Delta Chi. This second &quot;Phi Nu chapter&quot; would dissociate from the Alpha Chi Rho national in 1963 to become a local fraternity named Alpha Chi Alpha.)

=== Theta Delta Chi ===

Theta Delta Chi (), commonly called Theta Delt &quot;and&quot; TDX&quot;,&quot; was founded at Dartmouth College in 1869 as the &quot;Omicron Deuteron charge&quot; of the national fraternity and was the eighth fraternity founded at Dartmouth. Theta Delta Chi was the scene of a famous murder in June 1920. Henry Maroney, class of 1920, was shot to death in his room at Theta Delta Chi by Robert Meads, class of 1919. Meads was reportedly the central figure in a large-scale bootlegging operation at the college during the early years of Prohibition. An intoxicated Maroney reportedly stole a quart of Canadian whisky from Meads. Later that same night, Meads found Maroney in his room at the fraternity and shot him through the heart. Meads was convicted of a lesser charge of manslaughter and given a sentence of 15 to 20 years hard labor. The sensational murder is reportedly the source of the nickname given to the Theta Delta Chi residence: the &quot;Boom Boom Lodge&quot;. Theta Delta Chi has several distinguished alumni, including Robert Frost, who attended Dartmouth for a time in 1892.

=== Kappa Pi Kappa ===

Kappa Pi Kappa (&#x27;), commonly called Pi Kap&quot;,&quot; is a local fraternity founded on July 13, 1842. The organization was known as Kappa Kappa Kappa (&#x27;) from its founding until 2022 (except for a short period from 1992 to 1995). The organization has no affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan, which was founded after Kappa Kappa Kappa was founded and unfortunately adopted the Latin initials , similar to the Greek alphabet letters &quot;Kappa Kappa Kappa&quot;. According to legend, Kappa Kappa Kappa sued the Ku Klux Klan for defamation of name but lost because the judge ruled that the similarity in the initials of the organizations was sheer coincidence. Kappa Pi Kappa was the first society at Dartmouth to have a freestanding fraternity building in Hanover and one of the first in the country. Some prominent alumni include Channing Cox (1901), Dr. Bob (1902), Nick Lowery (1978), Paul Donnelly Paganucci (1953), and Peter Robinson (1979).

=== Sigma Phi Epsilon ===

Sigma Phi Epsilon (), commonly called Sig Ep at Dartmouth College was founded on April 22, 1908, as the local fraternity Omicron Pi Sigma. In 1909, the local fraternity became the &quot;New Hampshire Alpha chapter&quot; of Sigma Phi Epsilon. By the late 1960s, the house had become disenchanted with the national organization and felt that the Dartmouth membership would be better served as a local fraternity. The brothers voted to dissociate from the national organization on January 18, 1967. A vote of the alumni of the &quot;New Hampshire Alpha chapter&quot; on February 1, 1967, supported the decision. The new local fraternity adopted the name Sigma Theta Epsilon (which was also used by an unrelated national fraternity). The Sigma Phi Epsilon national continued to communicate with the local Sigma Theta Epsilon fraternity at Dartmouth, and by 1981 was willing to offer significant financial support for building renovations in exchange for reaffiliation. Convinced that the national organization had reformed its commitment to the individual chapters, the local fraternity voted to rejoin Sigma Phi Epsilon on February 18, 1981.

In 2010, Sig Ep decided to demolish their old house and build a brand new house at the same location, with their new house opening in 2011. After departure in 2018, Sig Ep returned to campus in 2022. Prominent alumni of the &quot;New Hampshire Alpha chapter&quot; include Theodor S. Geisel, Class of 1925, better known as &quot;Dr. Seuss&quot;, James Forrestal, Class of 1915, who served as Secretary of War under President Franklin D. Roosevelt, former chairman of Dartmouth&#x27;s board of trustees and CEO of Freddie Mac, Charles E. Haldeman, West Virginia Congressman Alex Mooney, singer Michael Odokara-Okigbo, and &quot;Stranger Things&quot; actor David Harbour.

=== Sigma Nu ===

Sigma Nu (), commonly called Sig Nu, at Dartmouth College, was originally formed in 1903 as the Pukwana Club, an organization that was created as a reaction to the perceived elitism of Greek organizations at the time. The club&#x27;s concept was based on the love for the traditions of Dartmouth, faithful friendship, and honorable dealings. In 1907, the Pukwana Club joined the national fraternity system after it received a charter to become the &quot;Delta Beta chapter&quot; of Sigma Nu. Sigma Nu&#x27;s &quot;Way of Honor&quot; principle was similar to principles expressed in the Pukwana Club&#x27;s original charter. The first residence for Sigma Nu at Dartmouth was purchased and refurbished in 1911. Known as the Green Castle, it served as chapter headquarters until the current house was built in 1925. In response to the national fraternity&#x27;s segregationist membership policies, the fraternity went local in 1963, becoming Sigma Nu Delta. The national fraternity&#x27;s bylaws were changed at the 1968 Grand Chapter, and in 1984 the fraternity reaffiliated with the national. In the summer of 2007, the Sigma Nu residence underwent significant structural renovations to bring the building up to the college&#x27;s minimum standards and improve living facilities. Improvements included an enclosed fire escape running from the first floor to the third floor, a renovated kitchen and bathroom, new flooring, a new study room, and alterations to bedrooms. Prominent alumni include acting Solicitor General of the United States Neal Katyal &#x27;91, associate commissioner for the New York State Office for Temporary and Disability Assistance Jorge Montalvo, Actor David Birney, Television Sports Commentator Brett Haber, and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; designer and writer Mike Mearls.

=== Phi Delta Alpha ===

Phi Delta Alpha (), commonly called Phi Delt &quot;or&quot; The Zig&quot;,&quot; was founded in 1884 as the &quot;New Hampshire Alpha chapter&quot; of Phi Delta Theta, a national fraternity. Early meetings of the fraternity were held in the Tontine Building on Main Street. The meeting location moved to the Currier Building in 1887 when the Tontine Building burned down. Phi Delta Theta began construction on a new house in 1898, and the building was completed in 1902, designed by Charles Alonzo Rich of Lamb &amp; Rich, modeled after the Hancock Manor in Boston, Massachusetts. In January 1960, the Dartmouth chapter broke away from the national because the national would not allow minorities to pledge the house. The new, local fraternity replaced the last letter in its name with Alpha. In March 2000, the fraternity was derecognized by the college. One of the primary reasons for the punishment was that four members of Phi Delta Alpha started a fire in the Chi Gamma Epsilon basement next door. Under the leadership of Gig Faux, class of 1984, Phi Delta Alpha applied to the college for re-recognition in fall 2002. The first rush class was formed in the winter of 2003. Former General Electric Chief Executive Officer, Jeffrey Immelt (1978) is a former president of Phi Delta Alpha. Other influential alumni include current Dartmouth trustees R. Bradford Evans (1964) and William W. Helman IV (1980), former Dartmouth trustee Peter Fahey (1968), billionaire oilman Trevor Rees-Jones (1973), &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; television show writer and executive producer David Benioff (1991), and Pulitzer winners Nigel Jaquiss (1984) and Joseph Rago (2005). In January 2010, a fire damaged the fraternity&#x27;s physical plant. No one was harmed, but the house was closed for renovations until June 2010.

=== Chi Gamma Epsilon ===

Chi Gamma Epsilon (), commonly called by Chi Gam&quot;,&quot; was founded in 1905 as the &quot;Gamma Epsilon chapter&quot; of Kappa Sigma, a national fraternity. The Dartmouth chapter dissociated from the national fraternity in 1987. The disputes with the national organization were primarily over funding for repairs to the house. Initially, the new local fraternity adopted the name Kappa Sigma Gamma, but the national fraternity took offense to the likeness of the names. After a period simply being known by its address, 7 Webster, the fraternity came upon the name by which it is now known, and adopted the house motto &quot;Come As You Are&quot;. Several Chi Gamma Epsilon/Kappa Sigma alumni brothers found fame in Major League Baseball careers, including all-star players Brad Ausmus (1991), and Mike Remlinger (1987), and former Baltimore Orioles General Manager Jim Beattie (1976). Other prominent brothers include Vivid Entertainment President William Asher (1984), and eBay Inc. CEO John Donahoe.

=== Chi Heorot ===

Chi Heorot (), commonly called Heorot or XH&quot;,&quot; was founded in 1897 as a local fraternity named Alpha Alpha Omega, and in 1902 was granted a charter as the &quot;Chi chapter&quot; of the Chi Phi fraternity. In 1903, the fraternity moved to its present location, and in 1927 it sold off its eighteenth-century house and built the house that stands today. In 1968, the house dissociated from the national fraternity, and adopted the name Chi Phi Heorot. The &quot;Heorot&quot; in Chi Phi Heorot comes from the medieval poem &quot;Beowulf&quot;, in which Heorot is the great hall where warriors converge to tell their stories. After several suspensions by the college in the early 1980s, it re-joined the Chi Phi national in 1981. This was short-lived; in 1987, because of damage done to the house that the college insisted upon having repaired for safety reasons but the Chi Phi national refused to help finance, the Dartmouth brotherhood again opted to become a local fraternity. In exchange for financing renovations to the structure, the college assumed ownership of the property and house. In its second incarnation as a local fraternity, the brotherhood chose the name Chi Heorot. Notable alumni include Olympic medalists Gerry Geran (1918), Adam Nelson (1997), and Andrew Weibrecht (2009).

=== Psi Upsilon ===

The &quot;Zeta chapter&quot; of Psi Upsilon International Fraternity (), commonly called Psi U was founded at Dartmouth in 1842, the first fraternity at Dartmouth College. In 1907, Psi Upsilon built the wood frame house it still occupies, designed by noted New Jersey theater architect and Dartmouth alumnus Fred Wesley Wentworth. Several additions during the latter half of the twentieth century greatly improved the structure, which houses around twenty brothers. The house most recently underwent substantial renovations during the spring of 2006. F. Scott Fitzgerald famously enjoyed the 1938 Winter Carnival in the Psi Upsilon chapter house. The &quot;Zeta chapter&quot; creates an ice pond in its yard every winter and is known as the &quot;keg jumping fraternity&quot; for its most popular Winter Carnival activity. Prominent alumni of the &quot;Zeta chapter&quot; of Psi Upsilon include banker, diplomat, and philanthropist Edward Tuck (1862), former United States Vice President Nelson Rockefeller (1930), and billionaire hedge fund manager of Lone Pine Capital, Steve Mandel (1978).

=== Zeta Psi ===

Zeta Psi (), commonly called Zete&quot;,&quot; at Dartmouth College was founded in 1853 as the &quot;Psi Epsilon chapter&quot; of the national fraternity. Zeta Psi was the fifth fraternity founded at Dartmouth and occupies a central location on the College&#x27;s fraternity row at 8 Webster Avenue. 

Zeta Psi&#x27;s early years were marked by two periods of dormancy, the first coinciding with the Civil War between until a brief restoration in . But this group failed again in . The chapter was permanently restored in . More recently it lost formal recognition on behavioral claims in , continuing independently until 2006, and reached agreement with the college to once again be restored as a chapter in good standing in . During a two-year closure –, alumni raised millions of dollars and the physical plant was entirely gutted and renovated, with a three-story addition being constructed on the west side of the house. At this time the basement was enlarged. 

== Sororities ==
The single-sex female-only sororities at Dartmouth College are largely organized and represented by the college through the Inter-Sorority Council. The Inter-Sorority Council is a student-led governance organization that assists the member Greek organizations by promoting values, education, leadership, friendships, cooperation, and citizenship. Alpha Kappa Alpha and Delta Sigma Theta are not members of the Inter-Sorority Council but are members of the National Pan-Hellenic Council.

=== Alpha Kappa Alpha ===
Alpha Kappa Alpha (), commonly called AKA&quot;,&quot; at Dartmouth College was founded in 1983 as the &quot;Xi Lambda chapter&quot; of the national sorority. Alpha Kappa Alpha was the first historically African-American sorority at Dartmouth College. The college supported the sorority with dedicated apartment housing until it became defunct in the spring of 2003. The sorority had no members of the class of 2004 and was unable to recruit new members for subsequent classes because of a national moratorium on recruitment related to a hazing incident at another chapter. In February 2008, it was announced that Alpha Kappa Alpha would return to campus and resume activity in the spring or fall of 2008, and as of 2023, the chapter remains in operation.

=== Alpha Xi Delta ===

The &quot;Theta Psi chapter&quot; of Alpha Xi Delta (), commonly called AXID&quot;,&quot; was founded as Delta Pi Omega in 1997. On January 6, 1997, the local sorority was officially recognized by the college, and on July 2, 1997, the sisters voted to affiliate with the Alpha Xi Delta national sorority. On February 21, 1998, the local organization&#x27;s petition was approved by the national with a charter as the &quot;Theta Psi chapter&quot;. Alpha Xi Delta initially occupied the house currently home to Beta Theta Pi, until it was announced in 2008 that Beta was repossessing the house and that the sorority would have to relocate elsewhere. In the fall of 2009, they moved into a newly renovated house. Since the &quot;Theta Psi chapter&#x27;s&quot; founding in 1997, Alpha Xi Delta has graduated multiple Rhodes Scholars. The Dartmouth chapter of Alpha Xi Delta sorority&#x27;s national philanthropy is &quot;Autism Speaks&quot;, although the chapter voted not to affiliate themselves with the organization and is currently affiliated with COVID-19 relief efforts. They also volunteer for The Upper Valley Haven, a local group that provides shelter and education to families.

=== Alpha Phi ===
Alpha Phi () was recognized on March 3, 2006, as the Dartmouth College colony of the international sorority. The colony officially became the &quot;Iota Kappa chapter&quot; of the sorority on April 28, 2007. Alpha Phi first participated in formal recruitment in September 2007. Dartmouth suspended the sorority in July 2024 after its members hosted an off-campus party that led to the death of Beta Alpha Omega member Won Jang.

=== Delta Sigma Theta ===
Delta Sigma Theta (ΔΣΘ) is a historically African-American sorority at Dartmouth College that was founded in 1982 as the Che-Ase Interest Group. At the time, the college had imposed a moratorium on the founding of new sororities, but when the moratorium was lifted, the group was recognized by the college as a sorority in the fall of 1984. The women contacted the Delta Sigma Theta national sorority and were granted a charter as the &quot;Pi Theta chapter&quot; on April 28, 1985. Delta Sigma Theta provided an extensive array of public services through the Five-Point Thrust program. Until the chapter&#x27;s dissolution, the sisters of Delta Sigma Theta had cosponsored the Step Show, an annual cultural dance performance, with the brothers of Alpha Phi Alpha. The sorority had occupied dedicated College-owned apartment housing until June 2004, when all but one member of the &quot;Dartmouth chapter&quot; graduated. An attempt was made to recruit new members in the summer, and it succeeded, as the chapter remains in operation as of 2022.

=== Epsilon Kappa Theta ===

Epsilon Kappa Theta (), commonly called EKT &quot;and&quot; Theta&quot;,&quot; at Dartmouth College was founded in January 1982 as the &quot;Epsilon Kappa colony&quot; of the Kappa Alpha Theta national sorority. Epsilon Kappa was the 100th colony of the sorority. The sorority initially met in various locations, including the basement of the college president&#x27;s house. In 1984, the sorority moved into Brewster Hall, a college-owned house previously used as an International House and, later, as temporary housing for the Alpha Chi Omega sorority. In 1992, the sisters of the &quot;Epsilon Kappa chapter&quot; of Kappa Alpha Theta found the strict national rules and the primarily Christian religious readings and rituals of the organization to be antithetical to the spirit of feminism and inclusivity that the chapter desired. The national organization was unhappy that the colony disobeyed its rules and failed to follow the sorority&#x27;s rituals. On May 4, 1992, the &quot;Epsilon Kappa&quot; notified the Kappa Alpha Theta national organization of its unanimous vote to disaffiliate and become a local sorority. The national organization revoked the charter of &quot;Epsilon Kappa&quot;. The Dartmouth women chose the new name Epsilon Kappa Theta. Its current residence is a Victorian house that was the Delta Psi Delta chapter house until 1991. Epsilon Kappa Theta calls itself &quot;one of the most diverse and progressive&quot; Greek houses on campus, and welcomes queer, non-binary, and gender non-conforming members. It voted to leave the Inter-Sorority Council in April 2024 to be more accommodating to its members of marginalized genders. 

=== Kappa Delta ===
Kappa Delta (), commonly called KD, a national sorority, colonized its &quot;Eta Xi chapter&quot; on the Dartmouth campus in 2009. The Dartmouth Panhellenic Council approved the sorority on May 25, 2009. The Council considered the large pledge classes at other sororities on campus in deciding to authorize another sorority.
The sorority recruited its first members in the summer of 2009, and Kappa Delta held its first formal rush during the fall 2009 academic term, offering membership bids to 37 women. Kappa Delta&#x27;s new 23-bedroom house at 1 Occom Ridge was built over the 2013–2014 school year and was completed in the fall of 2014. It contains a formal room, a gourmet kitchen, a library, and two bedrooms on the first floor, along with 21 more single bedrooms on the second and third floors. The sisterhood of Kappa Delta is involved in numerous philanthropic endeavors, including working with the Girl Scouts of the USA, Prevent Child Abuse America, the New Hampshire Children&#x27;s Trust, and the Confidence Coalition.

=== Kappa Delta Epsilon ===

Kappa Delta Epsilon (), commonly called KDE&quot;,&quot; is a local sorority founded in the fall of 1993 by the Panhellenic Council at Dartmouth. After the dissolution of the Xi Kappa Chi local sorority in the spring of 1993, the Panhellenic Council decided that there was a need for a new sorority to replace it. Fifty women joined the new sorority in the first rush in the fall of 1993. The Kappa Delta Epsilon physical plant was extensively remodeled by the college during the summer of 2003. The remodeled building contains a main meeting room, kitchen, two bedrooms, and a back porch on the first floor. The second and third floors contain all bedrooms that house about thirteen more resident sisters. The basement consists of the fireplace room, the pub room, and the sisters-only room.

=== Kappa Kappa Gamma ===

The &quot;Epsilon Chi chapter&quot; of Kappa Kappa Gamma (), commonly called KKG and Kappa, was founded at Dartmouth on December 30, 1978, and was the second sorority founded at Dartmouth College. United States Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a member of Dartmouth College&#x27;s Class of 1988, was an officer of Kappa Kappa Gamma as an undergraduate.

=== Sigma Delta ===

Sigma Delta (), commonly called Sigma Delt&quot;,&quot; was the first sorority at Dartmouth College, founded in May 1977 as the &quot;Zeta Lambda chapter&quot; of the national sorority Sigma Kappa. In April 1981, Sigma Kappa moved into a residence formerly inhabited by the Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. The local chapter at Dartmouth began to have differences with the national organization concerning religion in sorority rituals and an emphasis on men in national sorority songs. The Dartmouth chapter dissociated from the national organization in the fall of 1988, becoming Sigma Delta. The classes of 1989, 1990, and 1991 that formed the new local sorority dedicated the new organization to principles of &quot;strength, friendship, and acceptance of difference&quot;. Since reorganizing as a local sorority, Sigma Delta has hosted at least one open party each term in addition to service events. Actress Connie Britton (1989) was a member of the first local class and served as Sisterhood Chair during her sophomore summer.

=== Chi Delta ===

Chi Delta (), commonly called Chi Delt&quot;,&quot; was founded at Dartmouth as the &quot;Gamma Gamma chapter&quot; of Delta Delta Delta sorority in 1984. The house was the first Greek organization to secede from the Co-ed Fraternity Sorority Council in the spring of 2000, a move that eventually precipitated the dissolution of that organizing body as other Greek organizations on campus followed suit. Chi Delta remains a member of the Panhellenic Council. On May 29, 2015, the Dartmouth chapter of Delta Delta Delta unanimously voted to disaffiliate from its national organization and become a local sorority.

== Gender-inclusive Greek houses ==
The three gender-inclusive Greek houses at Dartmouth College are organized and represented by the college through the Gender-Inclusive Greek Council. The Gender-Inclusive Greek Council is a student-led governance organization that oversees and supports its three chapters in their efforts to promote leadership, scholarship, and sibling-hood. All three gender-inclusive houses at Dartmouth own the land and residence buildings they occupy.

=== Alpha Theta ===

Alpha Theta () was founded as a local fraternity named Iota Sigma Upsilon on March 3, 1920, by a group of seven students. In 1921, the fraternity received a charter as the &quot;Alpha Theta chapter&quot; of Theta Chi. John Sloan Dickey, later president of the college, joined the fraternity in 1928 and was elected house president two weeks later, while still a pledge. Nine brothers of Theta Chi died in a tragic accident on the morning of February 25, 1934, when the metal chimney of the building&#x27;s old coal furnace blew out in the night and the residence filled with poisonous carbon monoxide gas. 

Alpha Theta was one of the first collegiate fraternities in the United States to break from its national organization over civil rights issues. In 1951, while Dickey served as president of the college, the student body passed a resolution calling on all fraternities to eliminate racial discrimination from their constitutions. The Theta Chi national organization&#x27;s constitution contained a clause limiting membership in fraternity to &quot;Caucasians&quot; only. On April 24, 1952, the members of the Dartmouth chapter voted unanimously to stop recognizing the racial clause in Theta Chi&#x27;s constitution. Upon learning that the Dartmouth delegation to Theta Chi&#x27;s national convention later that year planned to raise questions about the clause, the &quot;Alpha Theta chapter&quot; was derecognized by the national organization on July 25, 1952. 

The house was reincorporated as a local fraternity and adopted the name Alpha Theta. Alpha Theta was one of the first all-male fraternities to admit female members. In 1972, Dartmouth admitted the first class of female students and officially became a coeducational institution. Alpha Theta also voted to become coeducational. After a few years, most of the women in the fraternity had become inactive and the house voted to become single-sex male-only again on November 10, 1976. The house returned to a gender-inclusive membership policy in 1980.

=== The Tabard ===

The Tabard () at Dartmouth College was founded in 1857 as a local fraternity for students in the Chandler Scientific School named Phi Zeta Mu. As the Chandler School was absorbed by Dartmouth in 1893, the house decided to associate with a national fraternity and became the &quot;Eta Eta chapter&quot; of Sigma Chi national fraternity. In April 1960, the Dartmouth chapter of Sigma Chi became the third fraternity on campus to dissociate from its national organization, following the 1954 Undergraduate Council referendum requiring fraternities to amend its national charters to end discrimination against minorities or go &quot;local&quot;. 

The fraternity officially chose to use the name The Tabard but also kept its Greek letters for its local corporation use to include all living and deceased members of both the chapter&#x27;s national affiliation and the new local independent organization. The new name was inspired by The Tabard, a fictitious London inn described in the General Prologue of &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot; by Geoffrey Chaucer. The Tabard was one of five Greek organizations at Dartmouth to become coeducational and admit women pledges when the college began admitting women students in 1972. 

The organization unofficially uses the Greek letters Sigma Epsilon Chi (), having inserted an &quot;E&quot; between the Sigma and Chi on a wrought iron railing above the front door of their residence. Prominent alumni of the Tabard include: its first president Stephen W. Bosworth (1961) who was the U.S. Ambassador to South Korea, the Philippines, and Tunisia; Gordon Campbell (1970) who was the 34th Premier of British Columbia; and actress, comedian, and author Aisha Tyler (1992).

=== Phi Tau ===

Phi Tau () was founded at Dartmouth College in 1905 as the &quot;Tau chapter&quot; of Phi Sigma Kappa. While the national fraternity proved to be an early leader among its peers by adopting non-discrimination policies in the mid-1950s &quot;Tau chapter&quot; leaders led the demand for such post-war era changes. The pace of change was contentious: Phi Sigma Kappa had previously had occasional foreign student members at many chapters. Unlike other fraternities, it also welcomed Catholics and Jews at a time when most fraternity members were Protestant. But aside from occasional foreign students, it did not yet welcome Blacks. In a reactionary response to a short-lived policy that limited the pledging of Black students between 1952 and 1956, and in a move that allowed it to avoid unpaid debts to the national, &quot;Tau&quot; broke with Phi Sigma Kappa and reformed itself as Phi Tau on March 7, 1956, naming the national fraternity as racist. Ironically, the Dartmouth chapter won the debate over the issue: the same discriminatory policy that caused &quot;Tau&quot; to withdraw was itself rescinded by the national fraternity at its Summer Convention just two months later, leaving Phi Sigma Kappa chapters free to pledge Black members. There has been no reconciliation, even though both groups remain progressive. Today, Phi Tau prides itself on its progressiveness; when the house constitution was rewritten in 1956, references to gender were deliberately excluded, making the house officially coeducational even before Dartmouth College accepted women as students. Phi Tau is the only coeducational Greek organization at Dartmouth that has always had female members since first admitting them and was the first Greek house at Dartmouth to add sexual orientation to its non-discrimination clause. Members of Phi Tau refer to one another as &quot;siblings&quot; regardless of gender. The house is known for its quarterly &quot;Milque and Cookies&quot; party, featuring thousands of homemade cookies and milkshakes. Phi Tau completely replaced their residence hall in 2002, for $1.8 million, funded in part by the sale of of land to the college.

== De-recognized Greek organizations ==
As of 2023, one de-recognized Greek organization still operates without College recognition.

=== Sigma Alpha Epsilon ===

Sigma Alpha Epsilon (), commonly called SAE&quot;,&quot; at Dartmouth College was founded in 1903 as a local fraternity named Chi Tau Kappa. In 1908, the fraternity sought to associate itself with a national fraternity and was granted a charter from Sigma Alpha Epsilon to become the &quot;New Hampshire Alpha chapter&quot;. With funding support from the national organization, the fraternity acquired a house on School Street that had previously been the residence of a college professor. By 1916, the fraternity had moved to a wood house on College Street north of the Green. The fraternity would replace the structure entirely with a new brick residence built between 1928 and 1931, one of the final fraternity building projects started on campus before the Great Depression. Sigma Alpha Epsilon members are encouraged by their national organization to emulate the tenets of &quot;The True Gentleman&quot;, a statement written by John Walter Wayland. Notable alumni of the chapter include the United States Secretary of the Treasury and emeritus CEO of Goldman Sachs Henry Paulson (1968), benefactor to Dartmouth College Barry MacLean (1960), and U.S. Senator Peter Fitzgerald (1982). Sigma Alpha Epsilon was de-recognized by Dartmouth College on February 4, 2016, but continues to operate independently.

== Defunct Greek organizations ==
Greek organizations at Dartmouth College that dissolved over the years have largely done so over financial difficulties or low membership and interest.

=== Acacia ===
The &quot;Zayin chapter&quot; of Acacia, a national fraternity, was founded at Dartmouth on March 31, 1906. The Acacia national organization never heard from the &quot;Dartmouth chapter&quot; again and lacks records of any student members or activities the chapter might have pursued. The national declared the chapter dissolved in 1908. Acacia was the first fraternity at Dartmouth to dissolve, and the &quot;Zayin chapter&quot; was the first Acacia chapter at any campus to close.

=== Alpha Delta ===
Alpha Delta (), commonly called AD&quot;,&quot; was initially founded by members of the Gamma Sigma Society. In 1847, the society became the &quot;Dartmouth chapter&quot; of Alpha Delta Phi, a national fraternity. The house dissociated from its parent corporation in 1969 and renamed itself The Alpha Delta Fraternity. Alpha Delta is well known for being part of the inspiration behind the movie &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;. The screenplay, co-written by Chris Miller, class of 1963, was inspired by a pair of short stories Miller wrote in &quot;National Lampoon&quot; in 1974 and 1975 (&quot;The Night of the Seven Fires&quot; and &quot;Pinto&#x27;s First Lay&quot;) about his experiences as a member of Alpha Delta. In November 2006, Miller published a memoir of his experiences in the fraternity under the title &quot;The Real Animal House: The Awesomely Depraved Saga of the Fraternity That Inspired the Movie&quot;. Alpha Delta was derecognized by Dartmouth College on April 13, 2015.

=== Alpha Pi Omega ===
Alpha Pi Omega () was established by women at Dartmouth College in May 2001. The organization was chartered as the &quot;Epsilon chapter&quot; of the national historically Native American sorority in 2006 and was officially recognized by the college as a full chapter beginning with the fall 2006 academic term. The sorority had college-owned housing on campus. Alpha Pi Omega had a six-week-long pledge period known as the Honey Process. For college governance purposes, the &quot;Epsilon chapter&quot; associated locally with the local member societies of the National Association of Latino Fraternal Organizations, but as of 2022, the chapter was no longer operating.

=== Alpha Sigma Phi ===
Alpha Sigma Phi () at Dartmouth College was founded in 1925, as a local fraternity named Sigma Alpha, The local fraternity became the &quot;Alpha Eta chapter&quot; of Alpha Sigma Phi, a national fraternity, in 1928. Faced with financial difficulties during the Great Depression, the Dartmouth chapter dissolved in 1936. C. Everett Koop (1937) who was Surgeon General of the United States from 1982 to 1989, was a member of one of the final Alpha Sigma Phi pledge classes at Dartmouth.

=== Alpha Tau Omega ===
Alpha Tau Omega () was founded at Dartmouth College in 1915 as the local fraternity Sigma Tau Omega. In 1924, the local fraternity was granted a charter to become the &quot;Delta Sigma chapter&quot; of the national fraternity Alpha Tau Omega. The Dartmouth chapter dissolved in 1936, at the height of the Great Depression.

=== Beta Theta Pi ===
Beta Theta Pi () installed a chapter at Dartmouth that has its origins in a local fraternity at Dartmouth&#x27;s Chandler Scientific School named Sigma Delta Pi, formed in 1858. This was the second Chandler fraternity and the seventh fraternity founded at the college. Sigma Delta Pi changed its name to Vitruvian (a tribute to the Roman architect Vitruvius) in 1871 and later established two short-lived chapters at other schools. In 1889, the local brotherhood decided to join a national fraternity, and the organization soon became the &quot;Alpha Omega chapter&quot; of Beta Theta Pi. It built a house (now South Fairbanks Hall) designed by Beta graduate Charles A. Rich of Lamb &amp; Rich in 1904, and it built its second house on Webster Avenue in 1933.

Notable Dartmouth alumni of Beta Theta Pi include but are not limited to: former US Representative from New Hampshire Frank G. Clarke, author Norman Maclean, former Governor of New Hampshire Walter R. Peterson (1947), businessman Alan Reich (1952), former Dartmouth President David T. McLaughlin (1954), owner of the Cincinnati Bengals Mike Brown (1957), founder of the Big East Conference Dave Gavitt (1959), former Athletic Director of Syracuse University Jake Crouthamel (1960), member of College Football Hall of Fame and Chief Executive Officer of the Hanover Company Murry Bowden (1971), professional poker player Chip Reese (1973), Politician Joel Hyatt (1972), US Congressman John Carney (1978), college football coach Buddy Teevens (1978), former NFL football coach Dave Shula (1981), former NFL quarterback Jeff Kemp (1981), Olympic skier Tiger Shaw (1985), former NFL quarterback Jay Fiedler (1994), and actor Brian J. White (1996).

Beta Theta Pi was suspended by the college three times in the 1990s. An incident of hazing in 1994 led to a year-long period of derecognition. In the summer of 1995, a member of Beta Theta Pi read a poem aloud during a house meeting that was deemed to be racist and sexist, and resulted in many calling for derecognition of the fraternity. In 1996, a Coed Fraternity Sorority Council judiciary committee found Beta Theta Pi guilty of six violations of college and fraternity policies. The college derecognized Beta Theta Pi permanently on December 6, 1996. The Hanover Police Department reported that the brothers of Beta Theta Pi did an estimated $15,000 in damage to the property soon after hearing of the permanent derecognition decision.

=== Delta Kappa Epsilon ===

The &quot;Pi chapter&quot; of Delta Kappa Epsilon (), commonly called Deke&quot;,&quot; was founded in 1853. It was the fourth social fraternity at Dartmouth College. Eight brothers of Delta Kappa Epsilon were famously involved in a 1949 murder of a fellow Dartmouth student. The men, after heavy drinking at three different fraternities, sought out a former member of the freshman football team. Finding him asleep in his dormitory room, but wearing a letter sweater that the eight men felt he did not deserve to be wearing, they beat him and he soon thereafter died of the injuries. Two Delta Kappa Epsilon brothers were brought to trial, fined, and given suspended sentence for the crime. In response to the murder, College President John Sloan Dickey announced that he felt it was important to reduce the influence of the fraternity system on campus. The organization was renamed Storrs House in 1970 before dissolving entirely.

=== Delta Upsilon ===
Delta Upsilon () at Dartmouth College was founded as Epsilon Kappa Phi, a local fraternity, at Dartmouth College in 1920. In 1926, the local fraternity became the &quot;Dartmouth chapter&quot; of Delta Upsilon, a national fraternity. The fraternity dissociated from the national in 1966 and adopted the name, Foley House. Foley House was one of the six local Greek organizations that became coeducational in 1972. In 1984, the organization decided to drop its association with the Greek system entirely and became one of the Affinity Housing programs offered by the college, available to any student interested in cooperative housing.

=== Delta Phi Epsilon ===
Delta Phi Epsilon () was founded at Dartmouth College in 1984 as the &quot;Epsilon Alpha chapter&quot; of the national sorority. The sorority was derecognized by the college in June 1989, when it failed to maintain an active membership of at least 35 students. The &quot;Dartmouth chapter&quot; attempted to revive itself by separating from the national sorority in 1990 to become Pi Sigma Psi, a local sorority, but dissolved soon thereafter.

=== Delta Psi Delta ===
Delta Psi Delta () was established at Dartmouth College in 1950 as the &quot;Epsilon Delta chapter&quot; of Tau Epsilon Phi, a national fraternity. The Dartmouth chapter dissociated from the national in 1969 and reformed itself as the Harold Parmington Foundation. Faced with falling membership in 1981, the fraternity reformed itself with a more traditional Greek letter name, Delta Psi Delta. In 1987, Delta Psi Delta opened its membership to women and men. Four years later, faced with critically low enrollment, Delta Psi Delta finally dissolved in 1991. The local, coeducational fraternity at Dartmouth was not associated with either the Canadian sorority or the local fraternities at California State University, Chico and Linfield College also named Delta Psi Delta.

=== Zeta Beta Chi ===
Zeta Beta Chi () was founded in 1984 as a local sorority named Alpha Beta. In 1986, the sorority gained a charter as the &quot;Zeta Beta chapter&quot; of Delta Gamma, a national sorority. In 1997, the sorority voted to go local again and reformed as Zeta Beta Chi. Plagued with low membership, the sorority was already on a marginal financial footing in 1998 when a college inspection during the summer discovered mercury contamination in the sorority&#x27;s basement, the former house of Arthur Sherburne Hardy. The college closed the building for the remainder of the year, negatively impacting the fall rush. The sorority announced its dissolution in December 1998.

=== Harold Parmington Foundation ===
The Harold Parmington Foundation, or HPF, was a local fraternity founded in 1970 after the &quot;Epsilon Delta chapter&quot; of Tau Epsilon Phi dissociated from its national organization. The new local fraternity continued to reside at 15 Webster Avenue, the house now occupied by the Epsilon Kappa Theta sorority. With only one member each from the classes of 1983 and 1984, the fraternity reorganized itself as a coeducational fraternity named Delta Psi Delta. A past president of the fraternity, Brian Dale (1980), was one of the passengers on American Airlines Flight 11 that was hijacked and flown into the North Tower of the World Trade Center in New York City during the September 11, 2001 attacks.

=== Kappa Alpha Psi ===
Kappa Alpha Psi () at Dartmouth College was founded in 1987 as the &quot;Mu Chi chapter&quot; of the national fraternity. Kappa Alpha Psi was the second historically African-American fraternity at Dartmouth College. Its membership was active through at least the end of the 1990s. The Kappa Alpha Psi national currently lists the &quot;Mu Chi chapter&quot; as inactive.
=== Lambda Chi Alpha ===
Lambda Chi Alpha () was founded at Dartmouth College in 1914 as the &quot;Theta Zeta chapter&quot; of the national fraternity. Faced with insurmountable financial stress during the Great Depression, the Dartmouth chapter dissolved in 1932.

=== Lambda Upsilon Lambda ===
Lambda Upsilon Lambda (), known more formally as &quot;La Unidad Latina, Lambda Upsilon Lambda Fraternity, Inc.&quot; was established at Dartmouth in 1997. The &quot;Psi chapter&quot; of Lambda Upsilon Lambda was the college&#x27;s first historically Latino fraternity. The fraternity had no physical plant. Lambda Upsilon Lambda sponsored &quot;Noche Dorada&quot;, an annual semi-formal dinner that features a guest speaker invited to the campus to address issues of Latino culture. The fraternity also supported the Brazil Project, in conjunction with its &quot;Sigma chapter&quot; at Wesleyan University, which supported thirteen families in Brazil. As of 2022, the chapter was no longer operating.

=== Xi Kappa Chi ===
Xi Kappa Chi () was originally established at Dartmouth in 1980 as the &quot;Zeta Mu chapter&quot; of Alpha Chi Omega, a national sorority. The sorority dissociated from the national organization in 1990 and became a local sorority named Xi Kappa Chi. Faced with low membership in 1993, the local sorority considered an affiliation with Phi Mu, a national sorority, as a possibility of attracting more new members hesitant to rush a small local sorority. The Phi Mu national organization sent representatives to Dartmouth in April 1993, but based on their report, the Phi Mu national council voted against a Dartmouth chapter. Xi Kappa Chi was dissolved by the Dartmouth Panhellenic Council in 1993.

=== Pi Lambda Phi ===
The &quot;Pi chapter&quot; of the national fraternity Pi Lambda Phi () was established at Dartmouth College in 1924. The membership of the Dartmouth chapter was predominantly Jewish. About half of the college&#x27;s fraternities at the time had national constitutions that explicitly forbade membership to Jews, and for many of the other chapters, it was an informal policy to exclude membership to Jewish students. The national constitution of Pi Lambda Phi expressly accepted members of all religions. Pi Lambda Phi was not initially accepted by the Dartmouth Greek community, and efforts in 1924 and 1925 to gain formal admission into the Interfraternity Council failed. The fraternity was finally recognized in the spring of 1927. The fraternity&#x27;s first residence, purchased in 1924, was a building on South Street originally occupied by a Roman Catholic church. The fraternity would reside there until 1961 when it moved to a house north of Webster Avenue on Occom Ridge. The chapter dissolved in 1971.

=== Sigma Alpha Mu ===
Sigma Alpha Mu () was established at Dartmouth College in 1930 as the &quot;Sigma Upsilon chapter&quot; of the national fraternity. At the time, the Sigma Alpha Mu national limited membership in the organization to Jewish men. Sigma Alpha Mu placed more emphasis on the observances of Judaism than did the other predominantly Jewish fraternity on campus, Pi Lambda Phi, and had difficulty attracting the interest of most mainstream Jewish students on campus. The Dartmouth chapter dissolved in 1935, during the Great Depression.

=== Sigma Lambda Upsilon ===
Sigma Lambda Upsilon (), more formally known as Sigma Lambda Upsilon/Señoritas Latinas Unidas Sorority, Inc., was established by four women at Dartmouth College in 2003, as the &quot;Alpha Beta chapter&quot; of the national, historically-Latina sorority. The sorority had no physical plant or designated College-owned housing. The Dartmouth chapter supported several activities including philanthropic events, formal dinners, and a summer book club, but as of 2022, the chapter was no longer operating.

=== Tau Epsilon Phi ===

Tau Epsilon Phi () was established at Dartmouth College in 1950 as the &quot;Epsilon Delta chapter&quot; of the national fraternity. The Dartmouth chapter dissociated from the national in 1969 and voted to call itself the Harold Parmington Foundation.

=== Phi Gamma Delta ===
Phi Gamma Delta (), commonly called FIJI, was founded at Dartmouth College as the &quot;Delta Nu chapter&quot; of the national fraternity in 1901. The &quot;Dartmouth chapter&quot; seceded from the national fraternity in 1965 and adopted the name Phoenix. The new local fraternity dissolved in 1971. The fraternity has no association with the Phoenix all-female senior society founded at Dartmouth in 1984. 

=== Phi Kappa Psi ===

Phi Kappa Psi (), commonly called Phi Psi&quot;,&quot; traces its heritage at Dartmouth College to the Beta Psi local fraternity, founded in 1895. Beta Psi became the &quot;New Hampshire Alpha chapter&quot; of Phi Kappa Psi in 1896. The &quot;Dartmouth chapter&quot; dissociated from the national in 1967 over the national&#x27;s reaction to the chapter&#x27;s pledging of a black student, and adopted the new name Phi Sigma Psi. Phi Sigma Psi was one of the six fraternities that adopted a formal coeducational membership policy in 1972. In the late 1980s, the membership began referring to the organization as Phi Psi/Panarchy. The fraternity changed its name to The Panarchy in 1991. In 1993, the college began a program for &quot;undergraduate societies&quot; as open-membership alternatives to the Greek system. In September 1993, the members of Panarchy voted to disaffiliate from the Greek system and became the first of two undergraduate societies.

<text>Williamson-Dickie Mfg. Co. is a British-American apparel manufacturing company primarily known for its largest brand, Dickies. Williamson-Dickie Europe, originally called Clares, was founded in 1900 in Wells, Somerset, U.K. to provide the agricultural industry with hardware and work clothing. The U.S. corporate division was founded in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1922 by C. N. Williamson and E. E. &quot;Colonel&quot; Dickie, who began a denim bib overall company selling workwear to farm and ranch hands around the Southwest. Today, Dickies is a global brand found in more than 100 countries designing, manufacturing and selling workwear to the automotive, hospitality, construction and medical industries.

==History==
Cousins C. N. Williamson and E. E. &quot;Colonel&quot; Dickie were successful salesmen and had already spent 25 years together selling hats in Texas southwest territory. In 1918, they and a few friends established the U.S. Overall Company in Fort Worth, Texas. Then, in 1922, Col. Dickie, C. N. Williamson and his son C. D. Williamson purchased 100% of the Overall Company on a one-third-each basis and renamed it Williamson-Dickie Manufacturing Company.

From its early years, Williamson-Dickie enjoyed steady growth which was slowed only by the Great Depression, and during World War II the company produced millions of uniforms for the nation&#x27;s armed forces. In converting to civilian production after the war, C. Don Williamson began a strategy of geographical expansion and established new production facilities, warehouses, and sales territories throughout the United States. In the late 1950s, Williamson-Dickie became an international company by expanding into the European market and the Middle Eastern market—where Texas oilmen introduced the Dickies brand to Middle Eastern oil fields.

In 2008 Williamson-Dickies acquired Kodiak Group Holdings Inc. of Canada.
In 2013 Dickies acquired Walls.

In 2014, Jerry Leigh of California became the exclusive licensee for Dickies Girl juniors&#x27; apparel.

VF Corporation acquired Williamson-Dickie in 2017 for $820 million in cash.

Williamson-Dickie Europe Ltd is based in the U.K. in Westfield, Somerset. Previously known as Dickies UK, this division of the company now operates across the entirety of Europe and the Middle East for both the workwear and streetwear product ranges.

Dickies&#x27; headquarters is relocating to California.

==Retail and collaborations==
Dickies is sold in the U.S., Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Australia, Russia, Chile, South Korea, Japan, Taiwan, Iceland, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Ireland, Croatia, the Philippines, Poland, Mongolia and Mexico. 

In June 2020, Dickies collaborated with the Japanese brand FACETASM creating a capsule collection.

<doc id="915240" wikidata="Q173213" url="?curid=915240" title="Coat of arms of Romania">
<text>The coat of arms of Romania was adopted in the Romanian Parliament on 10 September 1992 as a representative coat of arms for Romania. The current coat of arms is based on the lesser coat of arms of interwar Kingdom of Romania (used between 1922 and 1947), which was designed in 1921 by the Transylvanian Hungarian heraldist József Sebestyén from Cluj, at the request of King Ferdinand I of Romania, it was redesigned by Victor Dima. As a central element, it shows a golden aquila holding a cross in its beak, and a mace and a sword in its claws. It also consists of the three colors (red, yellow, and blue) which represent the colors of the national flag. The coat of arms was augmented on 11 July 2016 to add a representation of the Steel Crown of Romania.

==History==
The idea behind the design of the coat of arms of Romania dates from 1859, when the two Romanian countries, Wallachia and Moldavia, united under Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza. Then the two heraldic symbols, the golden aquila and the aurochs, were officially juxtaposed.

Until 1866, there were many variants of the coat of arms, regarding the background color and the number of times the two main elements where represented. In 1866, after Carol I was elected Prince of Romania, the shield was divided into quarters: in the first and fourth an eagle was depicted, and in the second and third the aurochs; above the shield the arms of the reigning Hohenzollern family was placed. After 1872, the coat of arms included the symbol of southern Bessarabia (after 1877, of Dobruja), two dolphins, in the fourth quarter; and the one of Oltenia, a golden lion, in the third quarter; on the shield the Steel Crown was placed, as a symbol of sovereignty and independence, after the Romanian War of Independence.

The coat of arms remained unchanged until 1921, after World War I, when Transylvania was united with the Kingdom of Romania. Then the coat of arms of Transylvania was placed in the fourth quarter, with the Turul (almost all motifs including the supposed Turul can be found in the &quot;Notita Dignitatum&quot; in form of Late Roman Empire shield designs) replaced by a black aquila, the third quarter depicted the coat of arms of Banat (the bridge of Apollodorus of Damascus and a golden lion), and the coat of arms of Dobruja was placed in an insertion. The shield was placed on the chest of a golden crossed and crowned aquila, as a symbol of the Latinity of the Romanians. The aquila was placed on a blue shield, capped with the Steel Crown. The coat of arms had three versions: lesser, middle (with supporters and motto), and greater (the middle arms on a red mantle lined with ermine). The coat of arms was designed by Transylvanian Hungarian József Sebestyén Keöpeczi, who was recommended by Alexandru Tzigara-Samurcaș.

After 1948, the Communist authorities changed both the flag and the coat of arms. The coat of arms was rather an emblem, faithful to the Communist pattern: a landscape (depicting a rising sun, a tractor and an oil drill) surrounded by stocks of wheat tied together with a cloth in the colors of the national flag. Until 1989, there were four variants, the first being changed shortly after 1948 (the proclamation of the republic), again changed in 1952 (a red star was added), and finally in 1965, when Romania ceased to be a &quot;People&#x27;s Republic&quot; and became a &quot;Socialist Republic&quot;.

Immediately after the 1989 Revolution, the idea came up of giving Romania a new, representative coat of arms. In fact, the very symbol of the Revolution was the flag with a hole in its middle where the communist coat of arms had been cut out.

The heraldic commission set up to design a new coat of arms for Romania worked intensely, subjecting to the Parliament two final designs which were then combined. What emerged is the current design adopted by the two chambers of the Romanian Parliament in their joint session on September 10, 1992.

In April 2016, deputies of the Judiciary Committee endorsed a bill voted previously by the Senate that returns the crown on the head of the eagle and mandates the public authorities to replace the existing emblems and seals to those provided by law until 31 December 2018 (to mark the centenary of the Union of Transylvania with Romania on 1 December 1918). The bill was adopted by the Chamber of Deputies on 8 June 2016 and promulgated by President Klaus Iohannis on 11 July 2016.

==Description==

The shield surmounting the eagle is divided into five fields, one for each historical province of Romania with its traditional symbol:

* golden aquila – Wallachia (&quot;Țara Românească&quot;)
* aurochs – Moldavia (&quot;Moldova&quot;), Bessarabia (&quot;Basarabia&quot;), Bukovina (&quot;Bucovina&quot;) and Maramureș
* dolphins – the seaside: Southern Bessarabia/Budjak (18671878) and Dobruja (after 1878)
* a black aquila for Crișana and seven castles, a sun and a moon for Transylvania (&quot;Transilvania&quot;)
* lion rampant and Trajan&#x27;s Bridge – Oltenia, Banat and Timok Valley

Romania&#x27;s coat of arms has as a central element the golden aquila holding an Orthodox cross. Traditionally, this eagle appears in the arms of the Argeș county, the town of Pitești and the town of Curtea de Argeș. It stands for the &quot;nest of the Basarabs&quot;, the nucleus around which Wallachia was organised.

Since July 11, 2016 the coat of arms has been altered to include the heraldic representation of the Steel Crown of King Carol. A symbol of its royal past and a token for the period during 1881 and 1947 when Romania was a monarchy, ruled by the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen house through its Romanian branch, founded by Carol.

The aquila, being the symbol of Latinity and a heraldic bird of the first order, symbolises courage, determination, the soaring toward great heights, power, grandeur. It is to be found also in Transylvania&#x27;s coat of arms.

The shield on which it is placed is azure, symbolising the sky. The eagle holds in its talons the insignia of sovereignty: a mace and a sword, the latter reminding of Moldavia&#x27;s ruler, Stephen the Great whereas the mace reminds of Michael the Brave, the first unifier of the Romanian Countries. On the bird&#x27;s chest there is a quartered escutcheon with the symbols of the historical Romanian provinces (Wallachia, Oltenia, Moldavia, Bessarabia, Transylvania, the Banat, Crisana, Maramureș) as well as two dolphins reminding of the country&#x27;s Black Sea Coast (Dobruja).

In the first quarter, Wallachia&#x27;s coat of arms, an aquila or holding in its beak a golden Orthodox cross, accompanied by a golden sun on the right and a golden new moon on the left, is displayed against an azure background.

In the second quarter, Moldavia&#x27;s traditional coat of arms is shown, gules: an aurochs head sable with a mullet of or between its horns, a cinquefoil rose on the dexter and a waning crescent on the sinister, both argent.

The third quarter features the traditional coat of arms of the Banat and Oltenia, gules: over waves, a golden bridge with two arched openings (symbolising Roman emperor Trajan&#x27;s Bridge over the Danube), wherefrom comes a golden lion holding a broadsword in its right forepaw.

The fourth quarter shows the coat of arms of Transylvania, Maramureș and Crișana: a shield parted by a narrow fesse, gules; in the chief, on azure, there is a black aquila with golden beak coming out of the fesse, accompanied by a golden sun on the dexter and a crescent argent on the sinister (symbolizing the Székelys); on the base, on or, there are seven crenellated towers, placed four and three (symbolizing the Saxons).

Also represented are the lands adjacent to the Black Sea (Dobruja), on azure: two dolphins affronts, head down.

<doc id="915245" wikidata="Q62925" url="?curid=915245" title="Wishbone (TV series)">
<text>Wishbone is an American live-action children&#x27;s television series that aired from 1995 to 1997 and originally broadcast on PBS. It is about a Jack Russell Terrier dog named Wishbone who daydreams about being the lead character of stories from classic literature.

==Premise==
A standard episode of &quot;Wishbone&quot; consists of an opening scene, introducing a contemporary plot in Wishbone&#x27;s hometown of Oakdale. Something about the situation reminds Wishbone of a famous work of literature, which he introduces to the viewer. The episode then cuts between an adaptation of that work, usually with Wishbone portraying the main character, and the contemporary plot. Occasionally, Wishbone will play a secondary character if the lead role is female (in &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, he plays Louis de Conte) or difficult to relate to (he plays Sancho Panza in &quot;Don Quixote&quot;). The development of the contemporary plot parallels that of the literary work, particularly in their dénouements.

The last two minutes of nearly every episode are a behind-the-scenes featurette titled &quot;Tail Ends&quot;, narrated by Wishbone and focusing on a production department whose work was particularly prominent in the episode, such as lighting for &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow&quot; or make-up for &quot;Frankenstein&quot;.

==Production==

===Development===
&quot;Wishbone&quot; was conceived by Rick Duffield after brainstorming with his staff about &quot;making a show for kids that was told from a dog&#x27;s point of view&quot;. Following several iterations of this idea, including one in which the dog loved music and another in which he brought good luck (hence the name Wishbone), Duffield hit on the idea of Wishbone imagining himself as heroic figures from literature. His eventual goal was &quot;an entertaining way for kids to get their first taste of great books&quot;.

===Casting===
In the summer of 1993, Duffield spent three days casting for the dog star at a motel courtyard in Valencia, California, looking at between 100 and 150 dogs. After filming a seven-minute pilot which captured Wishbone&#x27;s character and suggested the show&#x27;s format, he presented it to PBS.

Larry Brantley, the voice of Wishbone, was cast following &quot;a five-minute impromptu audition&quot; in which he imagined Wishbone&#x27;s thoughts as Soccer &quot;was obsessing, like, over this tennis ball&quot;.

For the literary scenes, the producers created a repertory company of local stage actors, dubbed The Wishbone Players.

===Filming===
&quot;Wishbone&quot;″s exterior shots were filmed on the backlot of Lyrick Studios&#x27; teen division Big Feats! Entertainment in Allen, Texas, and its interior shots were filmed on a sound stage in a warehouse in Plano, Texas. Additional scenes were filmed in Grapevine, Texas.
Duffield told &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;:&quot;Keeping up with the variety in the series is the biggest challenge. Because Wishbone is the central figure of each show and plays an integral role in the contemporary story and the literary story, he&#x27;s in almost every scene. So he has a lot to do and designing scenes that can work with a dog, with period actors and period sets, as well as kids in a contemporary world is a big challenge.&quot;

Despite acclaim from critics and educators, only 50 episodes were produced. The first 40 episodes were shown as a single-season run in 1995, while the remaining ten episodes became the second season in 1997–1998. Duffield told author Michael Brody that PBS halted production because the show did not have &quot;merchandising potential&quot;.

==Release==
The series aired on PBS and premiered in the United States on October 8, 1995. The final episode aired on December 7, 1997. After the series ended, reruns continued to air until August 31, 2001. The series returned in reruns on PBS Kids Go! on June 2, 2007. &quot;Wishbone&quot; clips came to the PBS Kids Go! website. The return to PBS lasted a short time, although some PBS stations continued to air &quot;Wishbone&quot; until October 7, 2013.

The show also aired on Nickelodeon in the UK and Ireland and on Nine Network in Australia.

===Home media===
Several episodes were released on VHS between 1995 and 1998.

In 2004, HIT Entertainment released four episodes on individual DVDs: &quot;Hot Diggety Dawg&quot;, &quot;The Impawssible Dream&quot;, &quot;The Hunchdog of Notre Dame&quot;, and &quot;Paw Prints of Thieves&quot;. These were then compiled into a single DVD released in 2011.

==Reception==
This show garnered particular praise for refusing to bowdlerize many of the sadder or more unpleasant aspects of the source works, which usually enjoyed a fairly faithful retelling in the fantasy sequences.

The TV series inspired several book series including &quot;Wishbone Classics&quot;, &quot;Wishbone Mysteries&quot;, and &quot;The Adventures of Wishbone&quot;. Altogether, more than fifty books have featured Wishbone, which continued to be published even after the TV series ended production.

===Video games===

There were also multiple video games based on the series in 1996 and 1997, such as &quot;Wishbone Activity Center&quot;, &quot;Wishbone Print Tricks&quot;, &quot;Wishbone and the Amazing Odyssey&quot;, and &quot;Wishbone Activity Zone&quot;.

===Film adaptation===

On July 15, 2020, it was announced that Universal Pictures and Mattel&#x27;s film division are developing a film adaptation of the series. Peter Farrelly will produce the film while Roy Parker will write the screenplay and Robbie Brenner will executive produce. It will be the first theatrical collaboration between Universal and Mattel and the ninth Mattel Films project in development.

===Others===
In 2021, &quot;Wishbone&quot; was spoofed in the stop-motion parody TV series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; episode (S11E11) &quot;May Cause Episode Title to Cut Off Due to Word Lim&quot; voiced by Breckin Meyer, where Wishbone plays the role of Anastasia Steele from the erotic romance novel &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;.

<doc id="915247" wikidata="Q271400" url="?curid=915247" title="Polygonum">
<text>Polygonum is a genus of about 130 species of flowering plants in the buckwheat and knotweed family Polygonaceae. Common names include knotweed and knotgrass (though the common names may refer more broadly to plants from Polygonaceae). In the Middle English glossary of herbs &quot;Alphita&quot; ( 1400–1425), it was known as ars-smerte. There have been various opinions about how broadly the genus should be defined. For example, buckwheat (&quot;Fagopyrum esculentum&quot;) has sometimes been included in the genus as &quot;Polygonum fagopyrum&quot;. Former genera such as Polygonella have been subsumed into &quot;Polygonum&quot;; other genera have been split off.

The genus primarily grows in northern temperate regions. The species are very diverse, ranging from prostrate herbaceous annual plants to erect herbaceous perennial plants.

&quot;Polygonum&quot; species are occasionally eaten by humans, and are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species – see list. Most species are considered weeds in Europe and North America.

==Description==
When the genus is defined narrowly, &quot;Polygonum&quot; species are annual or perennial herbaceous plants, rarely shrubby, with much branched stems. The leaves are arranged alternately, usually less than long, with a length greater than the width. They have a membranous ochrea (a sheath around the stem nodes). The flowers are usually bisexual, rarely unisexual, and have five (occasionally four) tepals, the outer being slightly different from the inner ones. There are usually four to six stamens and three (rarely two) styles. The fruit is three-sided.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Polygonum&quot; was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1754. The genus name is usually said to be from the Greek (&quot;poly&quot;-, &#x27;many&#x27;) and (&quot;gonu&quot;, &#x27;knee&#x27; or &#x27;joint&#x27;), in reference to the swollen jointed stem. However, long before Linnaeus, the name was used in Greek and Latin for a plant used medically. Discussing the plant he knew as &quot;polygonum&quot; in 1655, Matthias Martinius referred to Scribonius Largus (who wrote a list of prescriptions around 47 AD) and gave an alternative etymology, based on (&quot;gonos&quot;, &#x27;offspring&#x27;, &#x27;seed&#x27;), the meaning of the name then being the Latin , i.e. &#x27;fecund&#x27;, &#x27;with many offspring&#x27;. The &quot;Flora of North America&quot; says that a derivation meaning &#x27;many seeds&#x27; is the &quot;grammatically correct interpretation&quot;.

Many members of the family Polygonaceae that are now placed in separate genera were at one time or other placed in &quot;Polygonum&quot;, including species of &quot;Fagopyrum&quot;, &quot;Fallopia&quot;, &quot;Persicaria&quot; and &quot;Reynoutria&quot;, and older sources frequently use much wider definitions of the genus. Molecular phylogenetic studies, particularly in the 21st century, have led to major changes. Clarifying the circumscription of genera split from &quot;Polygonum&quot; was described in 2015 as &quot;still ongoing&quot;.

===Classification and phylogeny===
&quot;Polygonum&quot; is placed in the tribe Polygoneae of the subfamily Polygonoideae. Within the tribe, it is most closely related to the genera &quot;Duma&quot; and &quot;Atraphaxis&quot;, forming the so-called &quot;DAP clade&quot;.
==Species==

Between 65 and 300 species have been recognised at various times, depending on the circumscription of the genus. A number of species that had been included in &quot;Polygonum&quot; have been moved into several other genera, including &quot;Bistorta&quot;, &quot;Fagopyrum&quot;, &quot;Fallopia&quot;, &quot;Koenigia&quot;, &quot;Persicaria&quot; and &quot;Reynoutria&quot;. Other genera, such as &quot;Polygonella&quot;, have been subsumed into &quot;Polygonum&quot;.

==References in literature==
In &quot;The Man Who Laughs&quot; Victor Hugo wrote of the Comprachicos (child-buyers) who created artificial dwarfs, formed &quot;by anointing babies&#x27; spines with the grease of bats, moles and dormice&quot; and using drugs such as &quot;dwarf elder, knotgrass, and daisy juice&quot;. The idea of such use was also known to Shakespeare, as Beatrice K. Otto pointed out, quoting &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;:

<doc id="915250" wikidata="Q138227" url="?curid=915250" title="Aluminium chlorohydrate">
<text>Aluminium chlorohydrate is a group of water-soluble, specific aluminium salts having the general formula . It is used in cosmetics as an antiperspirant and as a coagulant in water purification.

In water purification, this compound is preferred in some cases because of its high charge, which makes it more effective at destabilizing and removing suspended materials than other aluminium salts such as aluminium sulfate, aluminium chloride and various forms of polyaluminium chloride (PAC) and polyaluminium chlorosulfate, in which the aluminium structure results in a lower net charge than aluminium chlorohydrate. Further, the high degree of neutralization of the HCl results in minimal impact on treated water pH when compared to other aluminium and iron salts.

==Uses==
Aluminium chlorohydrate is one of the most common active ingredients in commercial antiperspirants. The variation most commonly used in deodorants and antiperspirants is (dialuminium chloride pentahydroxide).

Aluminium chlorohydrate is also used as a coagulant in water and wastewater treatment processes to remove dissolved organic matter and colloidal particles present in suspension.

==Safety==
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration considers the use of aluminium chlorohydrate in antiperspirants to be safe and it is permitted in concentrations up to 25%.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
Studies have found only a negligible association between exposure to and long-term use of antiperspirants and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. There is no adequate evidence that exposure to aluminium in antiperspirants leads to progressive dementia and Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

Heather M. Snyder, the senior associate director of medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer&#x27;s Association, has stated, &quot;There was a lot of research that looked at the link between Alzheimer&#x27;s and aluminium, and there hasn&#x27;t been any definitive evidence to suggest there is a link&quot;.

===Breast cancer===
The International Journal of Fertility and Women&#x27;s Medicine found no evidence that certain chemicals used in underarm cosmetics increase the risk of breast cancer. Ted S. Gansler, the director of medical content for the American Cancer Society, stated &quot;There is no convincing evidence that antiperspirant or deodorant use increases cancer risk&quot;.

However, there is continued concern over the use of aluminium chlorohydrate in cosmetics as the risk of toxic build up over time has not been ruled out. The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) is currently designing a study to analyse the build up of aluminium chlorohydrate via dermal penetration to assess the risk of toxic build up.

==Structure==
Aluminium chlorohydrate is best described as an inorganic polymer and as such is difficult to structurally characterize. However, techniques such as gel permeation chromatography, X-ray crystallography and 27Al-NMR have been used in research by various groups including that of Nazar and Laden to show that the material is based on units with a Keggin ion structure and that this base unit then undergoes complex transformations to form larger poly-aluminum complexes.

==Synthesis==
Aluminium chlorohydrate can be commercially manufactured by reacting aluminium with hydrochloric acid. A number of aluminium-containing raw materials can be used, including aluminium metal, alumina trihydrate, aluminium chloride, aluminium sulfate and combinations of these. The products can contain byproduct salts, such as sodium/calcium/magnesium chloride or sulfate.

Because of the explosion hazard related to hydrogen produced by the reaction of aluminium with hydrochloric acid, the most common industrial practice is to prepare a solution of aluminium chlorohydrate (ACH) by reacting aluminium hydroxide with hydrochloric acid. The ACH product is reacted with aluminium ingots at 100 °C using steam in an open mixing tank. The Al to ACH ratio and the time of reaction allowed determines the polymer form of the PAC &quot;n&quot; to &quot;m&quot; ratio.

<doc id="915255" wikidata="Q3566832" url="?curid=915255" title="Wayne Gretzky's 3D Hockey">
<text>Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 3D Hockey is an ice hockey video game developed and published by Atari Games for the arcade in 1996. A port for the Nintendo 64 console was released almost simultaneously with the arcade version, on November 15, 1996, making it the first-ever 4-player game for the Nintendo 64, beating Mario Kart&#x27;s Japanese release by more than a month. The game was followed by a sequel, &quot;Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 3D Hockey &#x27;98&quot; (also ported to the PlayStation, and used as the basis for &quot;Olympic Hockey Nagano &#x27;98&quot;).

==Gameplay==
As opposed to the more realistic ice hockey simulation gameplay seen in Electronic Arts&#x27; &quot;NHL&quot; series, &quot;Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 3D Hockey&quot; features arcade-style gameplay, with moves such as &quot;power saves&quot;, which cause the goaltender to briefly transform into a brick wall, &quot;power shots&quot;, which set the net on fire or knock the goalie into the net, and &quot;power checks&quot;, which send an ambulance across the top of the screen. It features high-scoring games and over-the-top fights. There is also a simulation mode for those looking for more realistic gameplay. The game allowed the creation of profiles and would keep track of important individual and team stats, including goals, assists, and wins, among others.

==Development==
&quot;Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 3D Hockey&quot; was the second game to result from a three-year deal for a line of signature video games featuring hockey star Wayne Gretzky, the first being &quot;Wayne Gretzky and the NHLPA All-Stars&quot;.

The skating animations were created by videotaping Gretzky skating from different angles and building a 3D model to imitate his movements. The arcade hardware was built around the Voodoo Graphics chip.

The arcade game could be purchased as a dedicated cabinet or as a JAMMA-compatible conversion kit.

It was announced that the Nintendo 64 version would include fatalities after the fights, but Midway removed them from the final version. The game was originally scheduled to be published by Time Warner Interactive, but it was changed to Williams Entertainment, which was changed to Midway Home Entertainment shortly before the game&#x27;s release, after the Atari Games studio was sold to WMS.

==Reception==
&quot;Next Generation&quot; hailed &quot;Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 3D Hockey&quot; as &quot;an arcade hockey game against which to measure others.&quot; Though the reviewer suspected that the Nintendo 64 version&#x27;s being released less than a month after the arcade version would prevent the game from achieving success in the arcades, he lauded the realistic physics, multiple play modes, comprehensive licensing, statistics tracking, and selection of moves. He also noted that the &quot;Burst&quot; button prevents situations where the puck gets out of reach for extended periods of time, ensuring continuous action.

Most reviews for the Nintendo 64 version were mixed, generally praising the polygonal graphics and overall accurate recreation of the arcade version, but remarking that while the game is great fun with four players, the mediocre A.I. makes it impossible to enjoy in single-player mode. Most critics noted that while there is a simulation mode, it does not effectively translate the game into a realistic hockey sim, making it a disappointment to the hardcore hockey fan base. For some critics this was the game&#x27;s key problem; &quot;GamePro&quot;, for example, concluded, &quot;If fast, simple hockey appeals to you and your buds, Gretzky&#x27;s there with all the right bells and whistles. Just don&#x27;t expect the depth and staying power of EA&#x27;s NHL series or Sony&#x27;s Faceoff &#x27;97.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; similarly said, &quot;Fanatical hockey fans will be disappointed, as more realistic and finer-tuned hockey games on other systems easily outdo this one ... but more action-hungry players will find &quot;Gretzky&quot; worth the money, if only because its multiplayer capabilities are a blast, the arcade mode is fast, and the fights, well, they just come with the territory.&quot; However, &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s Tom Ham did not consider the lack of a true simulation option to be a problem at all, and concluded, &quot;No more slower frame rates, small players, and limited perspectives: 64-bit action is here and boy what fun it is.&quot;

Both Tom Ham and &quot;GamePro&quot; criticized the audio commentary as being too repetitive, while Joe Rybicki of &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; found it impressive for a cartridge-based game to have an announcer at all.

<doc id="915257" wikidata="Q7756146" url="?curid=915257" title="The Park School">
<text>The Park School is an independent day school in Brookline, Massachusetts, for boys and girls providing pre-Kindergarten through eighth grade education. Founded in 1888 as Miss Pierce&#x27;s School, it is a 34-acre campus in Brookline, Massachusetts near Jamaica Pond.

== History ==
Park&#x27;s roots go back to 1888, when Miss Caroline Pierce began a proprietary school on Walnut Street in Brookline. In 1923, it was incorporated and named to commemorate Julia Park, principal from 1910-1922. A gift of land from Dr. and Mrs. James M. Faulkner, former Park parents and grandparents, provided an opportunity for the school to move in 1971 from Kennard Road in Brookline to a 34-acre, country-like setting near Jamaica Pond and opposite Larz Anderson Park. (provided from the school website).

Park&#x27;s facilities span a 34-acre campus.

Park&#x27;s library contains 30,000 volumes and audiovisual materials.

Across the campus at 255 Goddard Avenue is Faulkner House, which provides office space and Preschool classes.

==Construction==
The school&#x27;s main building was constructed in 1971 from a modern architectural design by Earl Flansburgh &amp; Associates under the direction of then Headmaster Robert S. Hurlbut Jr. Built of reinforced precast concrete as a stack of modular classroom and office spaces with wall-length windows for more natural illumination of rooms, it exemplifies the brutalist concrete construction style pioneered by Swiss architect Le Corbusier. But its brick wall accents and its preserved oaks and Roxbury puddingstone outcroppings pay homage to historical New England building traditions and topography. The building features an inner courtyard with a &quot;Space Churn&quot; stainless steel mobile sculpture by George Rickey, donated by a Park parent in 1971. In 1996, the West Building designed by Graham Gund and Associates, added two full-sized basketball courts, three modern science labs, and four classrooms to the school&#x27;s facilities. In 2008, the school completed a major expansion and renovation of all of the Pre-kindergarten – grade 5 classrooms. A new wing houses Grade 4 &amp; 5 classrooms, after-school program space, a conference room, and adjoins the newly renovated 5,400-square-foot library.

During the summer of 2018, several renovation projects took place, including significant updates to the Early Childhood classrooms (PreK &amp; K), the accompanying Early Childhood/Discovery Playground, and the transformation of a conference room into a state-of-the-art Makerspace.

In the fall of 2021, Park students returned to a transformed Upper Division learning environment. Summer construction focused on the dated and unrenovated classrooms on the fourth floor of the Main Building and an unused former locker room area on the first floor. Eleven new, expanded Upper Division classrooms and dedicated collaboration spaces are deepening student engagement, giving our teachers instructional flexibility, and fostering meaningful collaboration among students and adults.
==Program==

The Park School is composed of two divisions; Lower Division (PreK-Grade 4) and Upper Division (Grades 5-8).

==Schedule==
At Park, the academic year runs from September to June. School begins at 8:15 a.m. School is dismissed at 3:05 p.m. PreK and kindergarten are dismissed at 12 p.m. on Friday.

==Extracurricular activities==
Various extracurricular activities are offered in the After-School Program for PreK – Grade 5. Families may sign up for two to five afternoons per week; pick-up times are 3:05 p.m., 4:30 p.m. or 6 p.m.

Students in Grades 6 – 8 are encouraged to participate in elective sports or after-school drama. In addition, clubs and a quiet study hall are offered until 4:30 p.m. Park offers three seasons of sports, as well as three seasons of theater production, that students may participate in.

Sports include flag football, soccer, field hockey, volleyball and cross country in the fall, basketball, scholastic wrestling and ice hockey in the winter, and lacrosse, softball and track and field in the spring.

Theater choices change from term to term and include both modern and classical theater, with a musical in the winter term.

==Annual events==
School-wide events include Grandparents&#x27; and Special Friends&#x27; Day; Yule Festival – a longstanding holiday assembly that acknowledges both the common and varying traditions of the school&#x27;s diverse community in songs and readings that capture the principles and spirit of Hanukkah, Christmas, and Kwanzaa; and May Day, a special assembly welcoming spring for students in Pre-K through Grade 8. Graduation is held in June and features an alumnus and or speakers.

==Notable alumni==

<text>Sheep farming or sheep husbandry is the raising and breeding of domestic sheep. It is a branch of animal husbandry. Sheep are raised principally for their meat (lamb and mutton), milk (sheep&#x27;s milk), and fiber (wool). They also yield sheepskin and parchment.

Sheep can be raised in a range of temperate climates, including arid zones near the equator and other torrid zones. Farmers build fences, housing, shearing sheds, and other facilities on their property, such as for water, feed, transport, and pest control. Most farms are managed so sheep can graze pastures, sometimes under the control of a shepherd or sheep dog.

Farmers can select from various breeds suitable for their region and market conditions. When the farmer sees that a ewe (female adult) is showing signs of heat or estrus, they can organise for mating with males. Newborn lambs are typically subjected to lamb marking, which involves tail docking, mulesing, earmarking, and males may be castrated.

==Sheep production worldwide==

According to the FAOSTAT database of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, the top five countries by number of head of sheep (average from 1993 to 2013) were: mainland China (146.5 million head), Australia (101.1 million), India (62.1 million), Iran (51.7 million), and the former Sudan (46.2 million). Approximately 540 million sheep are slaughtered each year for meat worldwide.

In 2013, the five countries with the largest number of head of sheep were mainland China (175 million), Australia (75.5 million), India (53.8 million), the former Sudan (52.5 million), and Iran (50.2 million). In 2018, Mongolia had 30.2 million sheep. In 2013, the number of head of sheep were distributed as follows: 44% in Asia, 28.2% in Africa; 11.2% in Europe, 9.1% in Oceania, 7.4% in the Americas.

The top producers of sheep meat (average from 1993 to 2013) were as follows: mainland China (1.6 million); Australia (618,000), New Zealand (519,000), the United Kingdom (335,000), and Turkey (288,857). The top five producers of sheep meat in 2013 were mainland China (2 million), Australia (660,000), New Zealand (450,000), the former Sudan (325,000), and Turkey (295,000).

===U.S. sheep production===
In the United States, inventory data on sheep began in 1867, when 45 million head of sheep were counted in the United States. The numbers of sheep peaked in 1884 at 51 million head, and then declined over time to almost 6 million head.

Between the 1960s and 2012, per capita per year consumption of lamb and mutton has declined from nearly five pounds (about 2 kg) to just about one pound (450g), because of competition from poultry, pork, beef, and other meats. Between the 1990s and 2012, U.S. sheep operations declined from around 105,000 to around 80,000 because of shrinking revenues and low rates of return. According to the Economic Research Service of the United States Department of Agriculture, the sheep industry accounts for less than one percent of U.S. livestock industry receipts.

== Reproduction ==
== Lambing ==
Most lambs are born outdoors. Ewes can be made to give birth in fall, winter, or spring months, either by artificial insemination or by facilitating natural mating. Fall lambing is generally not done as the lamb crop percentage is likely to be low; ewes often need hormone therapy to induce estrus and ovulation, and farm labor is often busy elsewhere during fall lambing. Furthermore, fall-born lambs can be weak and small because of heat stress during the summer gestation period. Spring lambing has the advantage of coinciding with the natural breeding and lambing seasons, but supplemental feed is often needed. The advantage of winter lambing is that the lambs are weaned in spring when pastures are most fertile. This allows the lambs to grow more quickly, and to be sold for slaughter during the summer (when prices are generally high), but it results in roughly one in every four newborn lambs dying within a few days of birth of malnutrition, disease, or exposure to the harsh cold. In the UK, it results in around 4 million newborn lamb deaths. &quot;Accelerated lambing&quot; is the practice of lambing more than once a year, typically every 6 to 8 months. The advantages of accelerated lambing include increased lamb production, having lambs available for slaughter at different seasons, year-round use of labor and facilities, and increased income per ewe. It requires intensive management, early weaning, exogenous hormones, and artificial impregnation. It is often used to make old or soon-to-be infertile ewes give birth one more time before they are slaughtered.

== Lamb marking ==
After lambs are several weeks old, lamb marking is carried out. This involves ear tagging, docking, mulesing, and castrating.

Ear tags with numbers are attached, or ear marks are applied, for ease of later identification of sheep.

Tail docking is commonly done for welfare, having been shown to reduce risk of flystrike when compared to the alternative of letting sheep collect waste around their buttocks.

The Merino breed, accounting for around 80% of the wool produced in Australia, have been selectively bred to have wrinkled skin resulting in excessive amounts of wool while making them much more prone to flystrike. To reduce the risk of flystrike caused by soiling for the lambs who make it to summer, Merino lambs are often mulesed at the same time, which involves cutting off the skin around their buttocks and the base of their tail with metal shears. If the lambs are younger than 6 months, it is legal to do this in Australia without any pain relief.

Male lambs are typically castrated. Castration is performed on ram lambs not intended for breeding, although some shepherds choose to omit this for ethical, economic or practical reasons. A common castration technique is &quot;elastration&quot;, which involves a thick rubber band being placed around the base of the infant&#x27;s scrotum, obstructing the blood supply and causing atrophy. This method causes severe pain to the lambs who are provided no pain relief during the process. Elastration is also commonly used for docking.

Based on the preference of the shepherd, docking and castration are commonly done after 24 hours (to avoid interference with maternal bonding and consumption of colostrum) and are often done not later than one week after birth to minimize pain, stress, recovery time, and complications. Ram lambs that will either be slaughtered or separated from ewes before sexual maturity are not usually castrated. Objections to all these procedures have been raised by animal rights groups, but farmers defend them by saying they reduce costs, and inflict only temporary pain.

== Healthcare ==


== Nutrition ==
Although sheep primarily consume pasture roughage, they are sometimes given supplemental feed, such as corn and hay provided by the shepherds from their own fields.

== Shearing ==

Sheep not meant to be eaten are typically shorn annually in a shearing shed. Ewes tend to be shorn immediately prior to lambing. Shearing can be done with either manual blades or machine shears. In Australia, sheep shearers are paid by the number of sheep shorn, not by the hour, and there are no requirements for formal training or accreditation. Because of this, it is alleged that speed is prioritised over precision and care of the animal.

=== Crutching ===
Crutching is the practice of removing wool for hygiene reasons, typically from around the face and buttocks.

== Saleyards ==
Sheep sold for slaughter often pass through saleyards, also known as auctions.

== Slaughter ==

When sheep can no longer produce enough wool to be considered profitable, they are sent to slaughter and sold as mutton, and lambs raised for meat are killed between 4 and 12 months of age. Sheep have a natural lifespan of 12–14 years.

== Herding ==
== Breeds ==
== Environmental impact ==
George Monbiot&#x27;s 2013 book &quot;Feral&quot; attacks sheep farming in the United Kingdom as &quot;a slow-burning ecological disaster, which has done more damage to the living systems of this country than either climate change or industrial pollution. Yet scarcely anyone seems to have noticed.&quot; He particularly looks at sheep farming in Wales.

<text>The blesbok or blesbuck (Damaliscus pygargus phillipsi) is a subspecies of the bontebok antelope endemic to South Africa, Eswatini and Namibia. It has a distinctive white face and forehead, which inspired the name because &quot;bles&quot; is the Afrikaans (and Dutch language) word for a such as one might see on the forehead of a horse.

==Taxonomy==
The blesbok and the bontebok (&quot;D. p. pygargus&quot;) are subspecies of the same species and can readily interbreed, the hybrid offspring being known as the bontebles or baster blesbok; the differences between the two subspecies have arisen due to preferences for different habitats in the wild.

==Distribution==
The blesbok is endemic to southern Africa and is found in large numbers in all national parks with open grasslands, from the Highveld north of the Vaal River southwards through the Free State, to the Eastern Cape. It is a plains species and dislikes wooded areas. It was first described in the 17th century in bountiful herds.

==Physical description==
Physically, rams and ewes are remarkably similar. Their mass can be as much as 85 kg. A characteristic of the blesbok is the prominent white blaze on the face and a horizontal brown strip that divides this blaze above the eyes. The body is brown with a lighter-coloured saddle on the back and the rump an even lighter shade. The legs are brown, with a white patch behind the top part of the front legs. Lower legs whitish. Both sexes carry horns, ringed almost to the tip. Female horns are slightly more slender. The neck and the top of the back of the blesbok are brown. Lower down on the flanks and buttocks, the coloring becomes darker. The belly, the inside of the buttocks, and the area up to the base of the tail is white. Blesbok can be easily differentiated from other antelopes because they have a distinct white face and forehead. The blesbok differs from the bontebok by having less white on the coat and the blaze on the face, which is usually divided; the coat is also a lighter yellow than the bontebok. The length of their horns averages at around 38 cm. Male adult blesbok average around 70 kg; females average lower, at around 61 kg.

==Habitat==
Blesbok can be found in open veld or plains of South Africa, Eswatini and Namibia. Their preferred habitat is open grassland with water. They often occupy relatively small territories of 2.5 to 6.0 acres in size.
They were once one of the most abundant antelope species of the African plains but have become scarce since 1893 due to relentless poaching for their skins and meat. Trophy hunting has helped the blesbok to survive and thrive in the areas where they are hunted legally.

==Reproduction==

The blesbok is a seasonal breeder, with rutting from March to May. Births peak during November and December after a gestation period of about 240 days (8 months). Females give birth to a single calf per breeding season.

==Status==
The blesbok was hunted nearly to extinction because of its large numbers, but having been protected since the late 19th century, it has proliferated. Today, it is sufficiently numerous not to be classed as endangered. In modern times, this is largely because of the commercial value of the blesbok to private landowners and because it is one of the few medium-sized antelopes that can be contained by normal stock fencing. As of 2017, blesbok numbers have had an upward trend, and are estimated to be at least 54,000, with about 69% of these thought to be genetically pure. There are at least 17,000 in protected areas. The principal threat is thought to be hybridization with the bontebok.

==Predators and threats==
Humans, lions, leopards, African wild dogs, spotted hyenas, and cheetahs are the blesbok&#x27;s main predators, while jackals, eagles, and potentially rock pythons and monitor lizards may take unattended calves. Nile crocodiles will catch blesbok, opportunistically, if they come to drink at bodies of water where crocodiles reside, or attempt to cross rivers with crocodiles in them. 

The blesbok is also farmed and hunted for its skin, meat, and for trophies. Blesbok are shy and alert; they rely on speed and endurance to escape predators but tend to return to where they were attacked after a few minutes. When chased, they can maintain a speed of but, like other white-fronted damalisques, blesbok are not good jumpers. They are, however, very good at crawling under things.

==Paleontology==
Fossil remains of a prehistoric relative, &quot;Damaliscus niro&quot;, were found in deposits in Sterkfontein. With a weight of approximately 120 kg, it was heavier than the modern blesbok and had slightly different horns. &quot;D. niro&quot; became extinct at the end of the Pleistocene 12,000 years ago.

<text>Machon (Ancient Greek: Μάχων, fl. 3rd century BC) was a playwright of the New Comedy.

He was born in Corinth or Sicyon, and lived in Alexandria. It is said that he taught the grammarian Aristophanes of Byzantium. Two fragments from two of his plays, &quot;Agnoia&quot; (Ignorance) and &quot;Epistole&quot; (The Letter), survive, along with 462 verses from a book of anecdotes about the words and deeds of notorious Athenians, preserved in the &quot;Deipnosophistae&quot; of Athenaeus. Dioscorides wrote an epitaph for Machon that has also survived.

<text>Odwalla Inc. () was an American health food company based in Dinuba, California. Founded in Santa Cruz, California in 1980 and formerly headquartered in Half Moon Bay, California from 1995 to 2020, the company&#x27;s product lines included fruit juices, smoothies, soy milk, bottled water, organic beverages, and several types of energy bars known as &quot;food bars&quot;.

The company experienced strong growth after its incorporation in 1985, expanding its distribution network from California to most of North America, and went public in 1993.

Odwalla juice caused a fatal outbreak of &quot;E. coli&quot; O157:H7 in 1996 because of numerous flaws in its safety practices, for which the company was found criminally liable. Despite industry norms, Odwalla originally sold unpasteurized juices, to avoid altering the flavor of its juices. Following the &quot;E. coli&quot; (Escherichia coli) outbreak and the death of at least one child, Odwalla adopted flash pasteurization and other sanitization procedures. Odwalla recalled its juices and experienced a 90% reduction in sales following the event. The company gradually recovered and, the following year, became profitable again.

In 2001, Odwalla was acquired by The Coca-Cola Company for US$181 million and became a wholly owned subsidiary. In July 2020, Coca-Cola announced it would discontinue the Odwalla brand by August 2020. The brand was sold to Full Sail IP Partners in 2021. Its headquarters was relocated to its production facility some time in the early 2020s. 

==History==
===Origin===
Odwalla was founded in Santa Cruz, California, in 1980 by Greg Steltenpohl, Gerry Percy, and Bonnie Bassett. Odwalla&#x27;s production facility is in Dinuba, California. The trio took the idea of selling fruit juices from a business guidebook, and they began by squeezing orange juice with a secondhand juicer in a shed in Steltenpohl&#x27;s backyard. They sold their product from the back of a Volkswagen van to local restaurants, employing slogans such as &quot;soil to soul, people to planet and nourishing the body whole&quot;.

The name for their start-up, &quot;Odwalla&quot;, was taken from that of a character who guided &quot;the people of the sun&quot; out of the &quot;gray haze&quot; in the song-poem &quot;Illistrum&quot;, a favorite of the founders, which was composed by Roscoe Mitchell and performed by the Art Ensemble of Chicago jazz group, of which Mitchell was a member. Steltenpohl, Percy, and Bassett related this to their products, which they believe &quot;help humans break free from the dull mass of over-processed foods so prevalent today&quot;.

===Incorporation to 1996===
Odwalla was incorporated in September 1985 after five years of growth and expanded to sell products in San Francisco in 1988. Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc., a venture capital firm in San Francisco, was one of Odwalla&#x27;s main investors at the time, investing several million dollars in the company. By 1992, the company employed 80 people at its company headquarters in Davenport, California, and sold around 20 different flavors of juice for between $1.50 and $2.00 a pint. Odwalla went public in December 1993 (NASDAQ:ODWA); the company had 35 delivery trucks, almost 200 employees, and made about $13 million a year. Soon afterwards, Odwalla expanded into new markets when it bought two companies in the Pacific Northwest and Colorado.

Odwalla built a new production facility located in Dinuba, California, in 1994 in order to better meet production demands. The following year, the company moved its headquarters to Half Moon Bay, California.

Continual growth and outside investments during these years allowed the company to expand and grow: Odwalla&#x27;s revenue tripled from 1994 to 1995, and in 1996 they made more than $59 million in sales, their highest ever. This constant growth made Odwalla one of the largest fresh-juice companies in America by 1996, when the company was selling its products to stores in seven states and parts of Canada. It was estimated that they would reach $100 million in sales by 1999. Much of this growth resulted from the perception that Odwalla&#x27;s products were healthier than regular juice because they were not pasteurized.

===1997 - 2001===

On October 7, 1996, Odwalla made a batch of apple juice using blemished fruit contaminated with &quot;E. coli&quot; resulting in one death and 66 sickened customers. The outbreak occurred because Odwalla sold unpasteurized fruit juices, though pasteurization had long been standard in the juice industry, claiming that pasteurization alters the flavor and destroys nutrients. Because of the lack of pasteurization and numerous other flaws in its safety practices, the company was charged with 16 criminal counts of distributing adulterated juice. Odwalla pleaded guilty, and was fined $1.5 million: at the time, the most significant penalty in a food poisoning case in the United States.
Despite a net loss for most of 1997, Odwalla worked to rehabilitate its brand name. In addition to advertising its new safety procedures, Odwalla released its line of food bars (its first solid food product line) and entered the $900 million fruit bar market. Another new product was the , a &quot;liquid lunch&quot; aimed at younger consumers. Because of these efforts, Odwalla was again profitable by the end of 1997, reporting a profit of $140,000 for the third quarter.

Having recovered, the company worked to expand geographically into markets like Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., and by the end of 1998 reported that revenue had surpassed pre-crisis levels. Growth continued over subsequent years, in part through the $29 million acquisition of , a large juice company based in Saco, Maine, in 2000. This allowed Odwalla to expand into additional East Coast markets, but incurred high transportation costs as products had to be shipped across the United States from California. To address this problem the company announced plans to build a second production facility in Palm Beach County, Florida. However, facing difficulties in obtaining building permits and allocating sufficient funds, the project was first delayed and eventually cancelled. Odwalla produced and sold products under both its own and the Fresh Samantha brand names for a few years; however, in 2003, the company decided to stop selling juice under the Fresh Samantha name and to only sell Odwalla-brand juice.

===2001 - 2020===
Odwalla was purchased by The Coca-Cola Company in 2001 for $15.25 a share, a deal which totalled $181 million and was unanimously approved by the Odwalla board of directors. Under the terms of the merger, Odwalla&#x27;s management stayed on as heads of the company, and it was &quot;folded&quot; into Coca-Cola&#x27;s Minute Maid department. The acquisition was one of several similar mergers which were aimed at expanding Coca-Cola&#x27;s product line to include non-carbonated drinks. Odwalla benefited by obtaining up to a 124.3 percent premium on shares of the company, as well as from the stability and strength that ownership by The Coca-Cola Company offered. Odwalla also was able to expand into new markets because of Coca-Cola&#x27;s well-established distribution network.

Odwalla continued to grow following the acquisition. This growth resulted in part from new product releases, which included a line of PomaGrand pomegranate juice (released at the 2006 Sundance Film Festival), two flavors of energy drinks, and three flavors of &quot;Soy Smart&quot; drinks, which contain soy protein, omega-3 fatty acids, and calcium.

Coca-Cola promoted Odwalla products in 2006 when the company aimed at removing carbonated soda products in schools. Odwalla continued to have good growth in 2007, when Coca-Cola, squeezed by poor growth in its North American markets, issued a company-wide hiring freeze; Odwalla, because of its good performance, was one of the few exceptions to the rule.

===2020 - today===
In July 2020, Coca-Cola announced the permanent discontinuation of all Odwalla products, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the brand not having shown growth in three consecutive years (a subset of the corporation&#x27;s which comprise less than 2% of its total revenue). Coca-Cola sold the brand to Full Sail IP Partners in 2021. Its headquarters was relocated to its production facility in Dinuba, California, some time in the early 2020s.

==Production==

Odwalla used what it characterized as &quot;fresh-sourced&quot; produce (fruits and vegetables that had recently been harvested) to make many of its products, as well as organic oats for food bars and certain tropical fruits in a frozen purée form, purchased from an outside source and blended with fruit juice. Because Odwalla used fresh produce, some juices were seasonal. Fruit availability and price were also affected by adverse weather, disease, and natural disasters. Throughout the year, Odwalla juice colors and flavors changed slightly because different types of fruit were used.

After the &quot;E. coli&quot; outbreak, Odwalla improved the safety of several of its production processes. Before the fruit entered the factory, it was washed, sorted and sanitized. Once it reached the plant, the apples, carrots, and citrus fruits were separated and washed again. The fruit was pressed to get the juice, which was then flash pasteurized and bottled. A sample underwent quality testing, and, if it passed, the batch was shipped in refrigerated trucks to various distribution centers in the United States. Odwalla juice had a relatively short shelf life compared to other beverages and thus required refrigeration. However, the shelf life was considerably extended after the introduction of flash pasteurization in 1996 and a new plastic bottle in 2001. Generally, Odwalla products were sold in special Odwalla-brand displays at grocery and convenience stores, instead of being intermixed with other products.

==Products==
===Drinks===
Odwalla Inc. produced many flavors of fruit and vegetable drinks, as well as dairy-free soy milk (marketed under the &quot;Soy Smart&quot; name), &quot;PomaGrand&quot; pomegranate juice, &quot;Serious Energy&quot; caffeinated fruit juice, bottled spring water, and Odwalla&#x27;s Superfood smoothie line of products (see green smoothie), which are viewed as the core products of the company and are made of various fruit purées, wheat grass, and barley grass. These products accounted for roughly 95 percent of Odwalla&#x27;s revenue in 2001.
Odwalla juice was sold in individual 12 fl oz (formerly 450 millilitre or 15.4 US fl oz) bottles made of plant-based recyclable HDPE plastic, as well as larger 64 US fluid ounce (1.9 litre) containers.
Odwalla&#x27;s juice, because of production costs, was &quot;typically sold at prices higher than most other juice products&quot;, and the price of the juice could vary over time because of weather or disease affecting the supply of fruit and vegetables.

Odwalla&#x27;s sugar content could be even higher than Coca-Cola&#x27;s. For example, Odwalla&#x27;s &quot;Mango Tango&quot; had 3.67 grams of sugar per ounce—almost 1 full teaspoon of sugar in every ounce of juice. Coca-Cola contains 3.25 grams of sugar per ounce. This translates to 44 grams of sugar (nearly four tablespoons) in a 12-ounce &quot;Mango Tango&quot; versus 39 grams of sugar in a 12-ounce Coke.

Throughout its history, Odwalla produced and subsequently withdrew various juice flavors due to their lower popularity, including the Odwalla Superfood Amazing Purple, Soy Vanilla, and Pomegranate Mango drinks.

===Food bars===

In September 1998, Odwalla began to sell energy bars made with fruit and grains, called food bars, as an alternative to its drinks in an attempt to raise revenue following the 1996 &quot;E. coli&quot; outbreak. The first three flavors released were Cranberry Citrus, Organic Carrot &amp; Raisin, and Peach Crunch. Within eight weeks of their release, the Odwalla Bar was one of the top-selling energy bar brands in the market. The bars came in a variety of flavors, and weighed per bar. As of 2001, before Odwalla was acquired by Coca-Cola, food bars accounted for less than five percent of Odwalla&#x27;s revenue.

As a cartoonist he was most famous for his work in &quot;Canard Enchaîné&quot;. As a comics artist his best known and longest-running series was the humoristic comic strip Jack Palmer, about a goofy private detective.

In 2001, he published &quot;L&#x27;Enquête Corse&quot; (&quot;The Corsican Enquiry&quot;), dealing with the &quot;independentist&quot; groups in Corsica. The album was a popular and critical success, with 300,000 printed in French plus 30,000 in Corsican. A movie of the same name, starring Jean Reno, was based on the book and released in 2004.

His work appeared in &quot;L&#x27;Écho des Savanes&quot; too and in 2015 he also published in Charlie Hebdo.

<text>Yossi Sarid (‎; 24 October 1940 – 4 December 2015) was an Israeli politician and news commentator. He served as a member of the Knesset for the Alignment, Ratz and Meretz between 1974 and 2006. A former Minister of Education and Minister of the Environment, he led Meretz between 1996 and 2003 and served as Leader of the Opposition from 2001 to 2003. Known for his determined moral stance and his willingness to pay the political price for that determination, Sarid was often referred to as Israel&#x27;s moral compass.

==Biography==
Yosef (Yossi) Sarid was born in Rehovot, Sarid served in the Artillery Corps and as a Military Correspondent during his national service in the IDF. He earned an MA in political science from New School for Social Research in New York City. He was a resident of Margaliyot in the Upper Galilee.

Sarid was married to Dorit, with whom he had three children, including the writer Yishai Sarid. He died on the evening of 4 December 2015 from an apparent heart attack. He is buried in Kibbutz Givat Hashlosha cemetery, on the outskirts of Tel Aviv.

==Political and journalism career==
Sarid worked as a media aide to Prime Minister Levi Eshkol.
He was first elected to the Knesset in 1973 on the Alignment list. He was re-elected in 1977, 1981 and 1984. After the Alignment agreed to join a national unity government with Likud in 1984, Sarid left the party on 22 October to join Shulamit Aloni&#x27;s Ratz. He was re-elected on the Ratz list in 1988.

In 1992, Ratz merged with Shinui and Mapam to form Meretz. The new party won 12 seats in the elections that year and joined Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s coalition. Sarid was appointed Minister of the Environment, a position he kept when Shimon Peres formed a new government after Rabin&#x27;s assassination in 1995.

In 1996, Sarid replaced Aloni as Meretz leader. Although the Labor Party won the most seats in elections that year, Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu won the special election for Prime Minister and formed a right-wing government.

Sarid was reelected as leader of Meretz in 1999. In the 1999 Knesset election, Meretz won 10 seats. Although Sarid had vowed not to join a coalition that included the ultra-Orthodox Shas, Ehud Barak persuaded Sarid to join the government, making him Minister of Education. Sarid explained the breaking of his vow in the need to promote the peace process. However, in 2000 Sarid resigned from the government and Meretz quit the coalition after failing to agree on authority to be given for Shas deputy minister of education.

In the 2003 elections, Meretz was reduced to 6 seats, after which Sarid resigned as party leader, to be replaced by Yossi Beilin. He remained a member of the Knesset until the 2006 elections, when Meretz was reduced to 5 seats, after which he retired from politics, a plan he had announced the previous year. In 2009, Meretz&#x27;s presence was further reduced to three seats in the Knesset.

Sarid wrote a weekly column for &quot;Haaretz&quot; newspaper.

<text>Anatoly Konstantinovich Lyadov (; ) was a Russian composer, teacher and conductor.

== Biography ==
Lyadov was born in 1855 in St. Petersburg, Russian Empire, into a family of eminent Russian musicians. He was taught informally by his conductor step-father from 1860 to 1868, and then in 1870 entered the Saint Petersburg Conservatory to study piano and violin.

He soon gave up instrumental study to concentrate on counterpoint and fugue, although he remained a fine pianist. His musical talent was highly regarded by Modest Mussorgsky, among others, and during the 1870s he became associated with the group of composers known as The Five. Expelled from the composition classes of Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov for absenteeism in 1876, he re-enrolled in 1878 in order to complete his graduation composition.

=== Family ===
* paternal grandfather – Nikolai G. Lyadov (), conductor of the Petersburg Philharmonic Society
* father – Konstantin Lyadov (Константин Ладов), chief conductor of the Imperial Opera Company
* mother – V. Antipova, pianist
* sister – Valentina K. Lyadova (), dramatic actress
* brothers-in-law – Mikhail Sariotti (), opera singer; Ivan Pomazanskiy (), musician
* paternal uncle – Alexander Lyadov (1818–1871; ), orchestral conductor of the Imperial Ballroom
* cousin (uncle&#x27;s daughter) – Vera Lyadova-Ivanova (1839–1870; ), actress and singer known for performances in operettas, married to Lev Ivanov
* cousin&#x27;s husband (divorced) – Lev Ivanov (Лев Иванов) ballet dancer and choreographer whose descendants now live in Iran with their second family (Zartari)

=== Teacher ===
He taught at the St. Petersburg Conservatory from 1878, with pupils including Sergei Prokofiev, Nikolai Myaskovsky, Mikhail Gnesin, Lazare Saminsky, Lyubov Streicher, and Boris Asafyev. Consistent with his character, he was a variable but at times brilliant instructor. Conductor Nikolai Malko, who studied harmony with him at the conservatory, wrote, &quot;Lyadov&#x27;s critical comments were always precise, clear, understandable, constructive, and brief... And it was done indolently, without haste, sometimes seemingly disdainfully. He could suddenly stop in midword, take out some small scissors from his pocket and start doing something with his fingernail, while we all waited.&quot;

Igor Stravinsky remarked that Lyadov was as strict with himself as he was with his pupils, writing with great precision and demanding fine attention to detail. Prokofiev recalled that even the most innocent musical innovations drove the conservative Lyadov crazy. &quot;Shoving his hands in his pockets and rocking in his soft woolen shoes without heels, he would say, &#x27;I don&#x27;t understand why you are studying with me. Go to Richard Strauss. Go to Debussy.&#x27; This was said in a tone that meant &#x27;Go to the devil!&#x27;&quot; Still, Lyadov said of Prokofiev to his acquaintances, &quot;I am obliged to teach him. He must form his technique, his style—first in piano music.&quot; In 1905, he resigned his post over the dismissal of Rimsky-Korsakov, returning once Rimsky-Korsakov was reinstated.

=== Glazunov, Belyayev and Tchaikovsky ===
 Lyadov introduced timber millionaire and philanthropist Mitrofan Belyayev to the music of the teenage Alexander Glazunov. Interest in Glazunov&#x27;s music quickly grew to Belyayev&#x27;s patronage of an entire group of Russian nationalist composers. In 1884 Belyayev instituted the Russian Symphony Concerts and established the annual Glinka Prize. The following year he started his own publishing house in Leipzig. He published music by Glazunov, Lyadov, Rimsky-Korsakov and Borodin at his own expense. With young composers increasingly appealing to Belyayev for help, he asked Lyadov to serve on an advisory board to select among applicants, together with Glazunov and Rimsky-Korsakov. The group of composers that emerged in this ambit became known as the Belyayev Circle.

In November 1887, Lyadov met Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Nearly seven years earlier Tchaikovsky had given a negative opinion to the publisher Besel about a piano arabesque Lyadov had written. Even before this visit, though, there are indications that Tchaikovsky&#x27;s opinion of Lyadov was evolving. He had, for example, presented Lyadov a copy of the score of his &quot;Manfred&quot; Symphony. Following their first meeting in person, the younger composer became &quot;dear Lyadov.&quot; From winter of 1890, Tchaikovsky was a frequent visitor to Lyadov and the Belyayev Circle.

=== Later years ===
He married into money in 1884, acquiring through his marriage a country property in Polynovka, Borovichevsky, Novgorod Governorate, where he spent his summers composing unhurriedly, and where he died in 1914.

== Music ==

While Lyadov&#x27;s technical facility was highly regarded by his contemporaries, his unreliability stood in the way of his advancement. His published compositions are relatively few due to a certain self-critical lack of confidence. Many of his works are variations on or arrangements of pre-existing material (for example his &quot;Russian Folksongs&quot;, Op. 58). He did compose a large number of piano miniatures, of which his &quot;Musical Snuffbox&quot; of 1893 is perhaps most famous.

Like many of his contemporaries, Lyadov was drawn to intensely Russian subjects. Much of his music is programmatic; for example his tone poems &quot;Baba Yaga&quot; Op. 56, &quot;Kikimora&quot; Op. 63, &quot;The Enchanted Lake&quot; Op. 62 (inspired by the painting by Arseny Meshchersky, &quot;The Enchanted Lake&quot;). These short tone poems, probably his most popular works, exhibit an exceptional flair for orchestral tone colour. In his later compositions he experimented with extended tonality, like his younger contemporary Alexander Scriabin.

It has been argued that Lyadov never completed a large-scale work. However, many of his miniatures have their place in the repertory. In 1905 Lyadov began work on a new ballet score, but when the work failed to progress, he shifted gears to work on an opera instead. Lyadov never finished the opera, but sections of the work found realization in the short tone poems &quot;Kikimora&quot; and &quot;The Enchanted Lake&quot;.

In 1909 Sergei Diaghilev commissioned Lyadov to orchestrate a number for the Chopin-based ballet &quot;Les Sylphides&quot;, and on 4 September that year wrote to the composer asking for a new ballet score for the 1910 season of his Ballets Russes; however, despite the much-repeated story that Lyadov was slow to start composing the work which eventually became &quot;The Firebird&quot; (famously fulfilled by the then relatively inexperienced Igor Stravinsky), there is no evidence that Lyadov ever accepted the commission.

<text>The Oxnard strike of 1903 was a labor rights dispute in the southern California coastal city of Oxnard between local landowners and the majority Japanese and Mexican labor force.

==History==

===Before the strike===
In 1887, Henry, James, Benjamin, and Robert Oxnard sold their Brooklyn sugar refinery and moved to California to capitalize on the growing agricultural economy of the late nineteenth century. In 1897, following the enactment of the Dingley Tariff Bill that heavily taxed foreign sugar, Henry, James, and Robert Oxnard formed the American Beet Sugar Company. Although the seasonal Chinese and Mexican laborers already in place in the county easily satisfied agricultural labor needs early in the factory&#x27;s history, decline in Chinese populations due to Chinese Exclusion Acts and use of Mexican workers in other agricultural efforts led to an increase in Japanese worker recruitment. A group of 1,000 Japanese farm workers were recruited in 1900 by labor contractors. By 1902 nine major Japanese contractors saw to the seasonal needs in the area.

Since these contractors had already caused minor slowdowns and protests over wages, recently arrived bank owners and merchants organized an owner-interest oriented contracting company called the Western Agricultural Contracting Company (WACC). The WACC quickly replaced the Japanese contractors as principal contractors to the Oxnard Plain and even forced some of them to subcontract through the WACC. This process also adversely affected farmworkers as the WACC charged a fee for subcontracting beneath them. The WACC regularly refused to pay laborers in cash and instead compensated them with credit for company stores which often sold goods at unreasonably high prices. Making up more than 90 percent of the work force, the WACC had a near monopoly of the workers. The WACC comprised two distinct departments, one tasked with the oversight of Japanese laborers and labor contractors and another tasked with the oversight of Mexican laborers and labor contractors. Workers under both of these departments were displeased by the conduct of the WACC. As a result, a large group of Japanese farmworkers and labor contractors organized a meeting at the beginning of February 1903 where they discussed their outrage at the working conditions and low wages under the WACC.

===The strike and the JMLA===
On February 11, 1903, 500 Japanese and 200 Mexican laborers became the charter members of the Japanese-Mexican Labor Association (JMLA) joined together and formed their organization based on the grievances of the Oxnard laborers. Despite its status as a farmworker&#x27;s labor union, the members of the JMLA were laborers working under contract, labor contractors, and temporary workers - many of whom were students from Japan. The JMLA is notable for being the first major agricultural union in California to unite agricultural workers of different minority groups. Overcoming obvious language barriers between the two constituent groups, they immediately elected Kosaburo Baba (president), Y. Yamaguchi (secretary of the Japanese branch), and J.M. Lizarras (secretary of the Mexican branch); Baba and Lizarras were both labor contractors and Yamaguchi has been recognized as a boarding student recruited from San Francisco. Their immediate concerns opposed the WACC on three conditions:

* they accused the WACC of artificially suppressing wages;
* they opposed the subcontracting system arguing that it forced workers to pay double commissions; and
* they called for the freedom to buy goods rather than be subjected to the inflated prices of the company store.

In order to remedy these issues, the JMLA membership ceased working through the WACC (essentially declaring a strike). The strike came at a serendipitously precarious time in the sugar beet season, the staple crop of Oxnard Plain agriculture, since the labor-intensive and yield-defining work of thinning the seedlings needed to be done within the scope of a few weeks. By refusing to work through the WACC during the thinning of sugar beet crops, the JMLA challenged the backbone of financial operations in the Oxnard Plain. Laborers who participated in the strike threatened the profits of the owners of the WACC, the American Beet Sugar Company, and the farm owners. Their actions were met with hostile responses from local newspapers and the leadership of the American Beet Sugar Company. Colonel Driffil, manager of the American Beet Sugar Company, formally declared the company&#x27;s support for the WACC and threatened to drive those who participated in the strike &quot;out of the country.&quot; Outside of their own membership and other local Mexican and Japanese residents, the JMLA found little support from the white community in Oxnard outside of a few opportunistic merchants who saw the strike as a chance to disrupt WACC operations.

By the first week in March, the JMLA recruited a membership larger than 1,200 workers (over 90% of the labor force of the county&#x27;s beet industry). The JMLA&#x27;s increased recruitment pulled the WACC&#x27;s former contracted workers from it and essentially brought the sugar industry to a standstill. Along with the labor strike, the JMLA staged large demonstrations and marches in Oxnard, displaying the union&#x27;s strength in numbers. During the second and third weeks of March, the WACC formed an alternative union known as the Independent Agricultural Labor Union (IALU) which intended to undercut the JMLA&#x27;s efforts. The IALU worked with the WACC as a strikebreaking organization seeking to restore regular working conditions in the sugar beet fields rather than advocate for farmworkers&#x27; rights.

On March 23, 1903, the strike reached its turning point. During a confrontation between the JMLA and IALU strikebreakers in Oxnard&#x27;s Chinatown shots were fired, wounding two Japanese and two Mexican members of the JMLA. Luis Vasquez, a Mexican member of the JMLA, was killed by the gunfire. Initial reports by local newspapers blamed the JMLA for the violence; however, a statement released by the JMLA in the following days asserted that union members were not armed at the confrontation, pointing out that no union members had been arrested. The sole arrest from the confrontation was that of Deputy Constable Charles Arnold for the murder of Luis Vasquez. A subsequent coroner&#x27;s inquest to determine Arnold&#x27;s role in the murder saw the testimonies of 50 witnesses, many of which contradicted one another with certain witnesses claiming they had observed Arnold firing at Vasquez and others claiming that Arnold had not even raised his gun at the confrontation. After a series of conflicting witness accounts, the county coroner requested that more Japanese witnesses speak at the inquest in the following days. However, the all-white male jury refused to continue the inquest as they had reached a verdict with the given evidence. The jury found Charles Arnold innocent in the murder of Luis Vasquez and he was cleared of all charges.

Despite the outcome of the coroner&#x27;s inquest, the WACC continued their striking efforts, bringing organized laborers from outside of town as well as intercepting potential strikebreakers. The Ventura &quot;Free Press&quot; reported on an incident in which members of the JMLA confronted a group of strikebreakers headed to a local farm and successfully convinced them to join the union&#x27;s cause.

After the deadly skirmish in Chinatown, JMLA representatives met with representatives of local farmers and the WACC to engage in negotiations. During the first two days of negotiations, the JMLA stated clearly that they would refuse to end the strike until the WACC ended their monopoly over Oxnard Plain sugar beet operations and allow workers to contract directly with local farmers. The strike reached an official end on March 30, 1903 after the WACC agreed to cancel all standing contracts with local sugar beet farmers and grant farmworkers the right to contract directly with local growers.

=== Aftermath ===
Japanese and Mexican laborers, formerly pitted against each other, had unified to achieve their labor goals. With the WACC as their common enemy, Japanese and Mexican farmworkers recognized their primary struggle as an issue of class conflict. JMLA membership viewed Anglo, Mexican, and even Japanese contractors who worked in conjunction with the WACC as antagonists to their cause. The success JMLA achieved showed the effectiveness of a multi-racial labor front and showed that class and Asian and Mexican shared oppression could be the unifier in labor organizing.

The racial dimensions of the JMLA victory against the WACC brought several issues to the attention of the mainstream American labor movement which traditionally refused to integrate minorities and agricultural workers into unions. While certain socialist groups and local factions of organized labor supported the organization of Japanese and Mexican farmworkers, the majority of AFL affiliates and leadership did not support the JMLA. This position was mostly based in anti-Asian attitudes and the traditional exclusion of farm laborers from AFL activities.

Following their victory against the WACC, the JMLA sought to charter as the Sugar Beet Farm Laborer&#x27;s Union of Oxnard (SBFLU) under the American Federation of Labor (AFL). However, the JMLA withdrew their request to charter under the AFL after AFL president Samuel Gompers refused to recognize the membership of Asian laborers under the AFL.
