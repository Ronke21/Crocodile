<text>James Edward Cracknell, (born 5 May 1972) is a British rowing and endurance athlete, double Olympic gold medalist and winner of six world championship titles. Cracknell was appointed OBE for &quot;services to sport&quot; in the 2005 New Year Honours List.

==Biography==
Cracknell began rowing whilst attending the independent Kingston Grammar School and rowed at the Junior World Championships in 1989 and 1990, winning a gold medal in 1990. He graduated from the University of Reading as a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Human Geography in 1993, followed by a PGCE at the Institute of Education and a Master of Science (MSc) from Brunel University in 1999. Moving into the senior squad, Cracknell made numerous appearances in the World Rowing Championships; however, he did not win any medals prior to the 1996 Summer Olympics. He qualified in the double scull for the 1996 Games, but fell ill with tonsillitis and was unable to race. In 1997, he won a seat in the men&#x27;s coxless fours, with Steve Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent and Tim Foster. With this crew, he won the World Rowing Championships in 1997, 1998 and 1999 (with Ed Coode replacing the injured Foster), and finally the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics. In August 2000, the month prior to winning gold in Sydney, he took part in a 3-part BBC documentary entitled Gold Fever. This followed the coxless four team in the years leading up to the Olympics, including video diaries recording the highs and lows in their quest for gold.

With Redgrave then having retired, Cracknell swapped from rowing on strokeside to bowside to join Pinsent in the coxless pairs. The pair won the World Championships in 2001, when they also won the coxed pairs, and 2002. However, in 2003 a disappointing season was capped by a failure to win the World Championships, and Pinsent and Cracknell were shifted into the coxless four, with Steve Williams and Alex Partridge. Ed Coode replaced the injured Partridge in time for the 2004 Summer Olympics and this crew won the gold medal in Athens, beating world champions Canada by 0.08s.

He came second in the pairs division of the 2005–2006 Atlantic Rowing Race in &quot;Spirit of EDF Energy&quot;, partnered by Ben Fogle. Although they took first place in the line honours of the pairs event (overall, they were third to finish the race behind the two men&#x27;s fours), the use of ballast water during the race resulted in the pair being moved to second position of the pairs event in accordance with the race rules. The event helped raise money for Children in Need.

They made landfall in Antigua at 07.13 GMT on 19 January 2006, a crossing time of 49 days, 19 hours and 8 minutes. In February 2006, he announced his decision to retire from competitive rowing. Shortly after, &quot;Through Hell and High Water&quot;, a BBC/Twofour television programme of Cracknell and Fogle&#x27;s experience of the Atlantic race, was aired. The pair wrote a book called &quot;The Crossing: Conquering the Atlantic in the World&#x27;s Toughest Rowing Race&quot;, about their trip.

On 4 March 2006, Cracknell&#x27;s home was burgled: his Olympic gold medals were stolen, together with his wedding ring and a computer containing 20,000 words of a new book and family photographs. The gold medals were subsequently recovered by a neighbour&#x27;s dog where the thief had discarded them. The thief, Mark Murphy, 30, was caught and jailed.

He ran the London Marathon on 23 April 2006, in a time of 3 hours, finishing over an hour ahead of his rowing teammate Matthew Pinsent.

In January 2008 Cracknell set up Threshold Sports with Julian Mack and Charlie Beauchamp.

In December 2008 he set off yet again with former teammate from the Atlantic Row, Ben Fogle, and Dr Ed Coats (the winner of a nationwide search), this time to take part in the inaugural Amundsen Omega3 South Pole Race. The team traversed the 473.6 miles suffering frostbite, infected blisters, dramatic weight-loss, pneumonia and exhaustion and came second only to a pair of Norwegians (over 20 hours). The BBC aired a 5 x 1-hour, prime-time Sunday night series of the adventure, &quot;On Thin Ice&quot; (Twofour), in June–July 2009. The series was accompanied by a self-penned book of the race, &quot;Race to the Pole&quot; (MacMillan).

In July 2008 Cracknell competed in the European Triathlon Championships for GBR for his age group and in November 2009 he took part in the New York Marathon. In April 2009, James completed the 125-mile non-stop Devizes to Westminster Canoe Marathon in a two-man racing K2 kayak with canoe partner Bernie Shosbree.

In August 2009 Cracknell attempted to break the non-stop Land&#x27;s End to John O&#x27;Groats mixed tandem world record along with Olympic gold medallist Rebecca Romero. The pair got just past Johnstone Bridge in Scotland before being forced to stop due to problems with Romero&#x27;s knees. They were on course to break the record by over three hours. The attempt was to launch the 2010 Ride Across Britain that Cracknell&#x27;s company organised

In April 2010 Cracknell became the highest placed Briton ever in the 25-year history of the Marathon des Sables, finishing 12th. His exploits were filmed for a Discovery Channel documentary &quot;The Toughest Race on Earth&quot; to be aired in October 2010. This highest ever placing was beaten in 2013 by another Briton, Danny Kendall who finished 10th.

Six months after his cycling accident which damaged his frontal lobe (see below), Cracknell competed in the Yukon Arctic Ultra. He finished second in the 430-mile race across the frozen Alaskan countryside, beaten only by British cyclist Alan Sheldon who beat Cracknell&#x27;s 163:20 with his own 99:30. Cracknell&#x27;s participation in the race was filmed for the documentary The Coldest Race on Earth aired on the Discovery Channel.

Cracknell ran the 2012 London Marathon in just under three hours, one of the fastest celebrities, but behind Nell McAndrew. In 2017, he ran a time of 
2:43:12, making him one of the fastest notable non-professional marathon runners.

In 2018, Cracknell enrolled at Peterhouse, Cambridge to study for a MPhil degree in human evolution. On 7 April 2019, Cracknell became the oldest competitor, and oldest winner, for Cambridge in the 2019 Boat Race; at the age of 46 he became the oldest rower in the event&#x27;s history by 10 years.

In 2019, Cracknell participated in the seventeenth series of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot;, where he was partnered with professional dancer Luba Mushtuk. He was the first celebrity to be eliminated from the show after losing the dance off to David James and Nadiya Bychkova.
He competed in the third series of &quot;Celebrity SAS: Who Dares Wins&quot;. In 2021, Cracknell again ran the London Marathon with a time of 2:55:39.

==Presenting and journalism==
Cracknell has presented sport on ITV, Channel 4 and BBC. He covered The Boat Race 2007 with Mark Durden-Smith for ITV and is the presenter of ITV&#x27;s coverage of the British Superbike Championship. He is also the main presenter of Channel 4&#x27;s Red Bull Air Race World Series coverage. He is a contracted columnist with &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; writing about various topics including sport, motoring, gardening, cookery and others.

== Charitable activities ==
From 27 February 2008, Cracknell covered over 1,400 miles from Britain to Africa in 10 days, rowing, cycling and swimming. He rowed from Dover, England to Cap Gris Nez, France, then cycled to Tarifa, Spain, and finally swam across the Strait of Gibraltar from Tarifa to Punta Cires, Morocco. The comedian David Walliams joined him for the final part of his journey providing support from his previous experience of swimming the English Channel. The money raised by the challenge went towards the BBC&#x27;s Sport Relief charity, with highlights of the action broadcast on 14 March. He was the celebrity guest at The WiG GiG which raise over £10,000 for Macmillan Cancer Support.

In January 2009, Cracknell took part in the Amundsen Omega 3 South Pole Race with his TV presenter friend Ben Fogle and Dr Ed Coats as members of &quot;Team QinetiQ&quot;, finishing in second, 20 hours behind the winning Norwegian team. The race and the reasons behind was broadcast on BBC Television during summer 2009 in the series &quot;On Thin Ice&quot;. The trio raised funds for the children&#x27;s medical research charity Sparks, chosen as the charity partner in memory of Cracknell&#x27;s niece, Eva, who died at six days old after suffering oxygen deprivation at birth.

On Saturday 3 October 2009, Cracknell and Ben Fogle started a 60-hour (estimated) journey from Edinburgh to London riding a rickshaw in support of SSAFA. They aimed to arrive in time for the &quot;Pride of Britain Awards&quot; ceremony on Monday 5 October 2009. They endured storm force gales in Scotland and Northumberland on their first day of the 450-mile ride. Early on the last day they made a stop at Etonbury Middle School in Arlesey, off the A1 road to London, where about 100 children welcomed them and to wave them on their way.

== Cycling accident, helmet advocacy ==
On 20 July 2010, Cracknell was hit from behind by a petrol tanker whilst cycling during an attempt to cycle, row, run and swim from Los Angeles to New York within 18 days. The accident happened at around 5.30am on a quiet stretch of road outside Winslow, Arizona. He has attributed his survival to wearing a cycle helmet at the time. In the crash he suffered a contrecoup injury to the frontal lobes of his brain. In 2012 Cracknell and his then-wife wrote &quot;Touching Distance&quot; about his life before and after his brain injury, which has left him with epilepsy, a lost sense of smell and taste, and a changed, more volatile, personality. Since the accident he has been conspicuous in advocating the use of bicycle helmets.

==Politics==

Having been a prominent supporter of the NOtoAV campaign in the 2011 United Kingdom Alternative Vote referendum, in June 2013 Cracknell revealed his intention to stand in the European Parliament election of 2014. He commented &quot;The European Union is going to have an effect on my children and grandchildren. I&#x27;d like to think I can have an effect - bring a fresh perspective. It&#x27;s not something I have to do, it&#x27;s something I want to do.&quot;

In October 2013, Cracknell was announced as a Conservative Party candidate in South West England and Gibraltar, together with Ashley Fox, Julie Girling, Georgina Butler, Sophia Swire and Melissa Maynard. Although he was at number 3 on the Conservative party list, Cracknell was unsuccessful.

In May 2023, it was reported Cracknell was seeking to be the prospective parliamentary candidate for Henley at the 2024 general election, following the announcement of the retirement of John Howell. He was selected as the Conservative candidate for Colchester in September 2023. In the 2024 General Election, Cracknell lost to the Labour candidate by 8250 votes.
Cracknell has stated he believes Britain could rejoin the EU in a generation.

==Personal life==
In 2002, Cracknell married TV presenter Bev Turner. The couple had three children: a son and two daughters.
They announced their separation on 29 March 2019 after 17 years of marriage. They were granted a decree nisi in their divorce proceedings in July of the same year.

In January 2021, he announced his engagement to Jordan Connell; they married in August 2021.

<doc id="906925" wikidata="Q433043" url="?curid=906925" title="André Marie Constant Duméril">
<text>André Marie Constant Duméril (1 January 1774 – 14 August 1860) was a French zoologist. He was professor of anatomy at the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle from 1801 to 1812, when he became professor of herpetology and ichthyology. His son Auguste Duméril was also a zoologist, and the author citation Duméril is used for both André and his son.

== Life ==
André Marie Constant Duméril was born on 1 January 1774 in Amiens and died on 14 August 1860 in Paris.

He became a doctor at a young age, obtaining, at 19 years, the &quot;prévot&quot; of anatomy at the medical school of Rouen. In 1800, he left for Paris and collaborated in the drafting of the comparative anatomy lessons of Georges Cuvier.

He replaced Cuvier at the Central School of the Panthéon and had, as his colleague, Alexandre Brongniart. In 1801, he gave courses to the medical school of Paris. Under the &quot;Restauration&quot;, he was elected a member of the Académie des Sciences (French Academy of Sciences) and after 1803 succeeded Lacépède, who was occupied by his political offices, as professor of herpetology and ichthyology at the Muséum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle. Duméril only officially received this chair in 1825, after the death of Lacépède.

He published his &quot;Zoologie analytique&quot; in 1806. This covered the whole of the animal kingdom and shows the relations between genera as then distinguished, but not among species. He was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia in 1813. In 1832, Gabriel Bibron (1806–1848), who became his assistant, was given the task of describing the species for an expanded version of &quot;Zoologie analytique&quot;, while Nicolaus Michael Oppel (1782–1820) assisted him with a revised higher-order systematics. After the death of Bibron, he was replaced by Auguste Duméril, André&#x27;s son. However, Bibron&#x27;s death delayed the publication of the new work for 10 years. In 1851, the two Dumérils, father and son, published the &quot;Catalogue méthodique de la collection des reptiles&quot; (although Auguste was apparently the true author) and in 1853, André Duméril alone published &quot;Prodrome de la classification des reptiles ophidiens&quot;. This last book proposes a classification of all the snakes in seven volumes.

Duméril, upon discovering a case of preserved fishes in the attic of the house of Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon, finally described the species that had been collected by Philibert Commerson nearly 70 years earlier.

He then published a very important work, &quot;l’Erpétologie générale ou Histoire naturelle complète des reptiles&quot; (nine volumes, 1834–1854). In this, 1,393 species are described in detail and their anatomy, physiology, and bibliography are specified. However, Duméril maintained the amphibians among the reptiles in spite of the work of Alexandre Brongniart or Pierre André Latreille or the anatomical discoveries of Karl Ernst von Baer (1792–1876) and Johannes Peter Müller (1801–1858).

He was interested all his life in the insects and published several memoirs on entomology. His principal entomological work is &quot;Entomologie analytique&quot; (1860, two volumes). With his son Auguste, also a zoologist, he created the first vivarium for reptiles of the Jardin des Plantes. Duméril always considered observations on animal behaviour of taxonomic significance.

After 1853, he began to cede his position to his son and he retired completely in 1857. He was made a commander of the Legion of Honour two months before his death.

<doc id="906927" wikidata="Q2604439" url="?curid=906927" title="Mist (novel)">
<text>Mist () is a novel written by Miguel de Unamuno in 1907 and first published in 1914 by Editorial Renacimiento.

Entitled as &quot;Fog. A novel&quot; in a translation by Elena Barcia published by Northwestern University Press in 2017.

==Plot summary==
The plot revolves around the character of Augusto, a wealthy, intellectual and introverted young man. He falls in love with a young woman named Eugenia as she walks past him on the street, and he sets about trying to court her. He is aided in his efforts by the other members of Eugenia&#x27;s household. Her Aunt Ermelinda is particularly keen for a relationship to evolve, so that Augusto might help with her niece&#x27;s financial troubles. Nevertheless, Eugenia rejects his advances, since she is already in a relationship with the down-and-out Mauricio. Augusto pays off Eugenia&#x27;s mortgage as a goodwill gesture without her knowing, but this only serves to insult Eugenia, rather than endear him to her.

In the meantime, Augusto becomes involved with another girl, Rosario, and he begins to question if he is really in love with Eugenia at all. After talking with various friends and acquaintances, Augusto decides he will propose to Eugenia in any case. To his surprise, Eugenia accepts the engagement. A few days before the marriage is to occur, Augusto receives a letter from Eugenia. The letter explained that she was leaving him for Mauricio. Augusto, heartbroken, decides to kill himself. 

Because everything Augusto does involves a lengthy thought process, he decides that he needs to consult Unamuno himself (the author of the novel), who had written an article on suicide which Augusto had read. When Augusto speaks with Unamuno, the truth is revealed that Augusto is actually a fictional character whom Unamuno has created. Augusto is not real, Unamuno explains, and for that reason cannot kill himself. Augusto asserts that he exists, even though he acknowledges internally that he doesn&#x27;t, and threatens Unamuno by telling him that he is not the ultimate author. Augusto reminds Unamuno that he might be just a character in one of God&#x27;s dreams. Augusto returns to his home and dies.

Whether or not he is killed by Unamuno or commits suicide is a subject of debate and is mostly down to the reader&#x27;s opinion. The book ends with the author himself debating himself about bringing back the character of Augusto. He establishes, however, that this would not be feasible. The eulogy is given by Orfeo, Augusto&#x27;s dog.

The title, Spanish for &#x27;fog&#x27;, is a reference to how Augusto sees his life. Augusto describes his world as full of small and almost imperceptible occurrences, some of them good, some of them bad, that all serve to obscure his vision.

== Characters ==
Augusto Pérez: main character.

Víctor Goti: Augusto&#x27;s best friend.

Miguel de Unamuno: renowned Spanish writer whom Augusto decides to visit when in search of life advice.

Eugenia Domingo Del Arco: piano instructor and acquaintance of Augusto.

Mauricio: Eugenia&#x27;s lover. He is also a friend for Rosario.

Rosario: young woman who brings the ironed clothes to Augusto&#x27;s house.

Orfeo: Augusto&#x27;s dog.

Domingo: Augusto&#x27;s house steward. 

Liduvina: Augusto&#x27;s housekeeper.

Ermelinda: Eugenia&#x27;s aunt.

Margarita: Eugenia&#x27;s uncles&#x27; house caretaker.

== Discussions ==

<doc id="906928" wikidata="Q517640" url="?curid=906928" title="Phoenix (1980 video game)">
<text>Phoenix is a fixed shooter video game developed for arcades in Japan and released in 1980 by Taito. The player controls a space ship shooting at incoming enemies that fly from the top of the screen down towards the player&#x27;s ship. There are five stages which repeat endlessly. The fifth is a fight against a large enemy spaceship, making &quot;Phoenix&quot; one of the first shooters with a boss battle, an element that would become common for the genre.

The game was created in Japan by an unknown developer. Following the game&#x27;s release in Europe and Japanese arcades in 1980, &quot;Phoenix&quot; was distributed in the United States by Centuri, where it helped the company turn a profit after a loss the previous year. Atari, Inc. contracted the rights to develop a home port for the Atari 2600 and sued Imagic for their game &quot;Demon Attack&quot;, which they felt was too similar to &quot;Phoenix&quot;. The 2600 version was released in 1983.

The Atari port of &quot;Phoenix&quot; received positive reviews from contemporary video game publications such as &quot;Electronic Games&quot;, &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers and Games&quot;, and &quot;The Video Game Update&quot; with some reviews in &quot;Blip&quot;, &quot;JoyStik&quot; and &quot;Video Games&quot; felt it was not as strong as the similar game &quot;Demon Attack&quot; on the Intellivision. Retrospective reviews of the arcade game from &quot;Eurogamer&quot; and AllGame praised the game as expanding on formulas established in earlier shooter games.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Phoenix&quot; is a fixed-screen shooter, set in space. The player maneuvers left and right to avoid objects such as missiles and charging enemies. A force field can be used by the player to protect them from these attacks. The force field only lasts a few seconds and then cannot be used for approximately five seconds after.

There are five stages. The first begins with a wave of 16 small phoenixes that drop missiles to attack the players spaceship. A second wave includes more birds. The third wave introduces an enemy that appears in a group of eight. These enemies start as eggs than grow into blue phoenix birds that attack the ship. They need to be destroyed by being hit in the center, otherwise a shot will only destroy the bird&#x27;s wing that can regenerate itself in a short time. The fourth stage features pink phoenix enemies, which can be destroyed similarly to the previous round. The fifth stage features a space fortress with a pack of small birds that attack the spaceship. The space fortress shoots missiles and approaches the player. After the space creature who pilots the ship is hit, the round is complete.

Switches are available on the arcade machine to the operator of the machine that can adjust gameplay. These switches allow the number of initial lives in the game to range between three and six, while other switches control what score is required to earn an extra life.
==Development==

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, several game companies made outer-space themed shooter games, which involved players destroying alien space fleets. These games generally shared the traits of enemies slowing approaching towards the player from the top of the screen and attacking the player. &quot;Phoenix&quot; was one of the games following this trend.

&quot;Phoenix&quot; was initially developed in Japan. Japanese creators of video games were often denied credit for work by their companies out of fear they would go and work for rivals. The original developer of &quot;Phoenix&quot; is unknown. The rights to the game for distribution were owned by several companies, including Amstar Electronics who were based in Phoenix, Arizona. Centuri entered into a licensing agreement with Amstar Electronics to release &quot;Phoenix&quot; in the United States, Canada, and Central and South America. Centuri had previously been Allied Leisure Industries, with Ed Miller becoming the company&#x27;s president in 1980. Prior to working at Centuri, Miller had worked for Taito, where he had arranged a deal with to license &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978) to Bally Manufacturing. 

In 1982, Atari received a four-year contract to distribute all current and future Centuri arcade games outside of the arcade systems, and the first three games announced were ports of the games &quot;Vanguard&quot; (1981), &quot;Challenger&quot; (1981) and &quot;Phoenix&quot;. The Atari port of the game was made by John Mraceck and Michael Feinstein. Mraceck was a junior at MIT at the time and made the game as part of his internship. It was developed in mid-1982. Mraceck said that they had to cut over one-third of their original code to fit the game on the cart. The two developers were limited to 8 KB rom cartridge for the game. The Atari 2600 version is missing elements from the arcade original, such as the ability to save high scores, the music, the star field background, numerals representing points when a bird is hit, the smaller birds appearing around the mothership, and has fewer enemies appear on the screen. The music lost from the arcade version included &quot;Romance de Amor&quot;, which is played when the game starts and &quot;Für Elise&quot; which is played when a player completes a level.

==Release==
&quot;Phoenix&quot; was released in Japan in December 1980 where it was licensed to Taito. The arcade version of the game was distributed in the United States by Centuri in January 1981.

&quot;Phoenix&quot; was released for the Atari 2600 in February 1983. Atari had the exclusive rights to produce &quot;Phoenix&quot; for home consoles and filed suit against the company Imagic, believing that their game &quot;Demon Attack&quot; (1982) was too derivative of &quot;Phoenix&quot;. A settlement was reached in January 1983, with Imagic still being allowed to release &quot;Demon Attack&quot; for the Atari 2600. &quot;Phoenix&quot; was released for home computers and game systems in the compilation game &quot;Taito Legends&quot; (2005) for Xbox, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and Windows PCs.

==Reception and legacy==
The arcade game was popular in Europe and Japan. At the end of 1981, Centuri reported revenues of USD$61.4 million with a profit of 7.5 million. In comparison, the company&#x27;s previous year gross was $5.9 million with a loss of $4.5 million. &quot;Phoenix&quot; was the best selling of Centuri&#x27;s titles by 1982. The Atari 2600 version sold over 600,000 units.

&quot;The Video Game Update&quot; referred to the Atari 2600 adaptation as a good translation of the arcade classic. In &quot;Electronic Games&quot;, Bill Kunkel and Arnie Katz wrote that the game was favorably compared to other Atari 2600 releases such as &quot;Vanguard&quot;, &quot;Yars&#x27; Revenge&quot; (1982), and &quot;Demons to Diamonds&quot; (1982), noting the quality in graphics and control, and stating it &quot;is perhaps the finest invasion title ever produced for the 2600!&quot;
Noel Steere of &quot;Electronic Fun with Computers and Games&quot; praised the game, stating it was a &quot;perfect arcade adaptation&quot; with beautiful sound, which made up &quot;for the sin of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;&quot;. The game received a Certificate of Merit in the category of &quot;1984 Best Science Fiction / Fantasy Videogame&quot; at the 5th annual Arkie Awards. Some critics compared the game to Imagic&#x27;s &quot;Demon Attack&quot;. Jim Gorzelany of &quot;JoyStik&quot; found that the gameplay and challenge was too watered down compared to the original arcade game and Imagic&#x27;s game. Phil Wiswell of &quot;Video Games&quot; found that Atari&#x27;s versions of both &quot;Phoenix&quot; showcased that Atari could still make both fun and graphically-appealing games, while finding the game still suffered in comparison to the Intellivision release of &quot;Demon Attack&quot;. An anonymous reviewer in &quot;Blip&quot; magazine concurred that the Intellivision version of &quot;Demon Attack&quot; was superior, but found that final battle with the mothership in &quot;Phoenix&quot; allowed Atari&#x27;s game to stand on its own.

In a retrospective review from AllGame, critic Brett Alan Weiss described the arcade version as a &quot;one of the most impressive games the &quot;slide-and-shoot&quot; genre has to offer, bested only by &quot;Galaga&quot; (1981) in terms of sheer enjoyment and replayability&quot; and said that &quot;finely balanced&quot; shooting action combined with &quot;colorfully&quot; animated graphics made &quot;Phoenix&quot; a classic in shooter genre. In his book &quot;The Video Game Guide&quot; (2013), Matt Fox compared the arcade game to &quot;Galaxian&quot; (1979), stating that &quot;Phoenix&quot; took its gameplay &quot;a few screens further&quot;. Chris Wilkins of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; complimented the arcade game for expanding the gameplay of the shooter genre, specifically with the boss character and that the game was addictive as it &quot;never fails to invoke the &quot;one more go&quot; desire in the player.&quot; In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked the arcade version of &quot;Phoenix&quot; at #69 on their list of &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot;, saying that it was one of the better &quot;Space Invaders&quot; variations. Discussing the game in &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, Nick Thorpe compared the game to &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, finding &quot;Phoenix&quot; &quot;considerably advanced&quot; due to its difficulty to predict behaviors of enemies and final boss fight while also noting that it lacked some elements from modern shooters, such as power-ups and a larger enemy variety.

Weiss included the Atari 2600 port of &quot;Phoenix&quot; in his book &quot;The 100 Greatest Console Video Games 1977-1987&quot; (2014). He wrote that the Atari port had rich graphics, crisp sound and excellent gameplay, preserving the feel of original arcade game. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; included the Atari 2600 port of the game in their list of the top 25 games for the system in 2008.

&quot;Phoenix&quot; was one of the first shooter games to have a boss battle. Bosses would come to typify the shooter genre following the release of the game. Games that borrowed elements from &quot;Phoenix&quot; include &quot;Space Vultures&quot;, &quot;Gorf&quot; (1981), &quot;Pleiades&quot; (1981), and &quot;Condor Attack&quot; (1983). Bootleg versions of &quot;Phoenix&quot; were released in arcades as &quot;Condor&quot;, &quot;Griffon&quot;, &quot;Vautour&quot;, and &quot;Batman Part 2&quot;.

<text>The Amur Military Flotilla (AMF) () was a military flotilla on the Amur river in the Far East region of Russia.

==History==
In 1900, the Russians formed a temporary flotilla on the Amur from private steamers and barges. Initially, it served transportation purposes during the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. Officially, the AMF was created in July 1906 for the purpose of defending the border line of the Amur basin and securing water communication on the Amur. In 1910, the AMF comprised 28 vessels, including eight turret gunboats and ten smaller gunboats. In December 1917, it formed the Soviet Amur military flotilla, which took part in the Russian Civil War.

In 1918, the AMF was captured by Japanese forces, who took away almost all of the ships in May 1920. With the end of the Civil War in the Far East, the Soviets began reconstruction of the flotilla. In 1925–1926, it grew bigger with the return of the ships which had been taken away by the Japanese. In 1929, the AMF included four river monitors and other ships. In 1930, the AMF was awarded with the Order of the Red Banner for its successful military operations during the Sino-Soviet conflict of 1929.

Neon Antonov (1907–1948) was transferred to command the flotilla in preparation for the war against Japan. During the operation, the AMF (eight monitors, eleven gunboats, 52 armored launches etc.) under the command of Antonov cooperated with the armies of the 1st and the 2nd Far Eastern fronts on the Amur, Ussuri, and Sungari rivers and Lake Khanka.

The Amur Military Flotilla was disbanded on 7 June 1998.

<text>Peter Høeg Gade (born 14 December 1976 in Aalborg, Denmark) is a Danish former professional badminton player. He currently resides in Holte in Copenhagen. He has two children with the former handball player Camilla Høeg.

Gade made his mark in badminton history through his All England Open Badminton Championships singles title in 1999 and his five European Championships crowns in the men&#x27;s singles event. He topped the world rankings from 1998 to 2001. With his 22 Grand-Prix titles, he is one of the sport&#x27;s most successful players. On 22 June 2006, he briefly recaptured the number one spot in the world rankings. This was achieved after winning the Singapore Open and reaching the quarter-final at the Malaysia Open.

With his defeat in the quarter-finals of the 2012 French Open, Gade retired from international competition.

==Player attributes==
His playing style is known for fast attacks, smooth footwork and constant pressure. His deception is particularly creative for a world badminton player, and he uses a widely recognised and highly successful &quot;trademark shot&quot; (the so-called &quot;double action&quot; of the racket sends the shuttle to the back of the court, while aiming to bring the player towards the net). With a plethora of deceptive shots, he has been known to win points from more outrageous attempts, such as the reverse forehand and backhand (using the opposite side of the racket head to the one anticipated, to make contact with the shuttlecock at a radically different angle).

<doc id="906941" wikidata="Q388631" url="?curid=906941" title="Ivan Hlinka">
<text>Ivan Hlinka (January 26, 1950 – August 16, 2004) was a Czech professional ice hockey player and coach. He is considered to be one of the most important figures in Czech ice hockey history. A big centre, his playing style was comparable to Phil Esposito, often scoring with shots from the slot. He played most of his career with HC Litvínov and spent two seasons in the National Hockey League with the Vancouver Canucks. Internationally, Hlinka played for the Czechoslovakia men&#x27;s national ice hockey team and was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2002. After retiring as a player, he turned to coaching, leading the Czech national team to gold at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano and spending two seasons with the Pittsburgh Penguins. His legacy includes the Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament for national under-18 hockey teams, and the Ivan Hlinka Stadion.

==Playing career==
Hlinka began to play ice hockey at a young age. When he was six years old, he was playing HC Litvínov&#x27;s youth team. He played in Czechoslovak league for the first time when he was 16.

At age 20, he became a captain of Litvínov&#x27;s men&#x27;s team and played in the Czechoslovak national team for the first time. He played 256 games as a member of the Czechoslovak national team and scored 132 goals in international games. He also played in 544 games in the Czechoslovak league and scored 347 times. Hlinka was named the Golden Hockey Stick winner as the country&#x27;s top player in 1978.

Hlinka helped the Czechoslovak team to win world titles in 1972, 1976, and 1977. As a member of the Czechoslovak team, he won an Olympic bronze medal in 1972 and a silver medal in 1976.

Hlinka played in the inaugural Canada Cup tournament in 1976, the international tournament in which the best available players competed for their countries (most notably, players from the National Hockey League). Canada defeated Czechoslovakia in the best-of-three final two games to nothing, with scores of 6–0 and 5–4. The following year, he was named the national team&#x27;s captain, a position he held from 1977 to 1980.

In 1981, Hlinka and fellow Czech Jiří Bubla joined the NHL&#x27;s Vancouver Canucks. This started the Czech migration to the NHL. They were the first Czechoslovak players to compete in the NHL with the permission of their country&#x27;s authorities. (Jaroslav Jiřík played legally in the NHL in the 1969–70 season, but only in three games.) Playing in his first NHL season, Hlinka set a Canucks record for the most points by a rookie with 60 (later matched by Pavel Bure in 1991–92). During the subsequent 1982 Stanley Cup playoffs, the Canucks advanced to the Finals against the New York Islanders. In a losing effort (Vancouver lost the series in four straight games), Hlinka became the first Czech to ever play in the Stanley Cup Finals (Bubla did not play in them). The following season, Hlinka improved to 63 points over 65 games. In his two years in the NHL, Hlinka totalled 42 goals and assisted on 81 others in 137 games.

Hlinka returned to Europe to finish his playing career due to problems with his back in 1983. He played in the Swiss team EV Zug until 1985, when he returned to Litvínov where he started his coaching career.

==Coaching career==
After his return to Czechoslovakia, Hlinka began to coach in &quot;his&quot; HC Litvínov. Later, he coached temporarily in Freiburg, Germany.

Hlinka also became very famous for his trick in the 1986–87 season. Litvínov was in last place in the standings of the Czechoslovak league. Hlinka, already 37 years old, began to play again. Litvínov immediately improved its game and went unbeaten in Hlinka&#x27;s first eight games (six wins and two ties). Altogether, he played 19 games and scored 23 points.

In the 1990s, Hlinka was head coach of Czechoslovak and later Czech national teams. His teams won bronze medals at the Albertville Olympics and the World Championships in 1992 and 1993. He left the national team after an unsuccessful World Championship in 1994.

Hlinka returned in 1997 and his team won the bronze medal at the World Championship again. Hlinka became a national hero when his team won the gold medal at the Nagano Olympics; the first time that the NHL agreed to release its players for the Games. The triumph was celebrated by the whole nation. The dominance of the Czech hockey team in the world was confirmed in May 1999 when Hlinka&#x27;s team won the World Championship again.

In 2000–01, Hlinka returned to the NHL as head coach of the Pittsburgh Penguins. He and Alpo Suhonen became the second and third Europeans to ever coach in the NHL, following Johnny Gottselig. His first season also coincided with Mario Lemieux&#x27;s return to the NHL, and together they made a surprising run to the Eastern Conference Finals, knocking off the higher-seeded Washington Capitals and Buffalo Sabres along the way before falling to the New Jersey Devils. The next season was not successful, as the struggling small-market Penguins had traded their superstar, Jaromír Jágr. Hlinka himself was criticized by Lemieux for not taking classes in the summer to improve his English and that contributed to the frosty relationship between them. After losing the first four games of the 2001–02 season, Hlinka was fired and he returned to Europe.

In 2001–02, he worked as general manager of the Czech national team, and in 2002–03, he coached the Russian team Avangard Omsk for one season.

==Coaching record==
* World Championships: 1 gold (1999), 4 bronzes (1992, 1993, 1997, 1998).
* Olympics: gold (1998), bronze (1992).

==Death==
Hlinka was supposed to be once again head coach of the Czech national team in the 2004–05 season. However, he died on August 16, 2004, at age 54 when his car collided head-on with a Daewoo Avia truck driving the wrong way on the E48 highway 200 yards from the town of Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. He had gone to Karlovy Vary to ensure that Jaromír Jágr would participate in the 2004 World Cup of Hockey. The truck suddenly appeared in Hlinka&#x27;s lane.

==Honors and awards==
* Czechoslovak player of the year (1977–78)
* All-star centre at the 1978 IIHF World Championship
* Inducted to the IIHF Hall of Fame (2002)
* Czech Ice Hockey Legend (2004)
* Ivan Hlinka Memorial Tournament for national U18 ice hockey teams named after him
* Ivan Hlinka Stadion, arena of HC Litvínov is named after him

<text>The brown fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus), also known as the Cape fur seal, and Afro-Australian fur seal, is a species of fur seal.

==Description==
The brown fur seal is the largest and most robust member of the fur seals. It has a large and broad head with a pointed snout that may be flat or turned up slightly. They have external ear flaps (&quot;pinnae&quot;) and their whiskers (&quot;vibrissae&quot;) are long, possibly growing back past the pinnae, especially in adult males. The fore-flippers are covered with sparse hairs over about three-quarters of their length. The hind-flippers are short relative to the large body, with short, fleshy tips on the digits. The size and weight of the brown fur seal depends on the subspecies; the Southern African subspecies is, on average, slightly larger than the Australian subspecies. Males of the African subspecies (&quot;A. p. pusillus&quot;) are in length on average and weigh . Females are smaller, averaging in length and typically weighing . Males of the Australian subspecies (&quot;A. p. doriferus&quot;) are in length and weigh . Females are length and weigh .

Adult male brown fur seals are dark gray to brown, with a darker mane of short, coarse hairs and a lighter belly, while adult females are light brown to gray, with a light throat and darker back and belly. The fore-flippers of the fur seal are dark brown to black. Pups are born black, molting to gray with a pale throat within 3–5 months. The skull of the African subspecies has a larger crest between the mastoid process and the jugular process of the exoccipital.

==Ecology==


The African fur seal inhabits the southern and southwestern coast of Africa, from Cape Cross, Namibia to around the Cape of Good Hope and from Black Rocks, near Port Elizabeth in the Eastern Cape province. The Australian fur seal lives in the Bass Strait, on four islands off Victoria (southeastern Australia), and five islands off Tasmania. Brown fur seals prefer to haul-out and breed on rocky outcrops and small islands, rock ledges and exposed reefs, as well as on rocky, pebble or boulder beaches. However, some larger colonies can be found on sandy beaches, such as in South Africa. Fur seals spend most of the year at-sea, but are never too far from land. They have been recorded 160 km from land, but this is not common.

The African fur seal&#x27;s diet is made of up to 70% fish, 20% squid, and 2% crab. Also eaten are other crustaceans, cephalopods and sometimes seabirds. In rare instances, they have even been documented attacking and eating sharks. A recent incident occurred off Cape Point, South Africa, where a large male was observed attacking and killing five blue sharks between 1.0 and 1.4 m long. Observers concluded that the seal likely killed the sharks to eat the fish-rich contents of their stomachs, as well as their livers, as a source of energy. The Australian fur seal mostly eats squid, octopus, fish, and lobsters. The brown fur seal dives for its food. The African subspecies can dive as deep as 204 m (669&#x27;) for as long as 7.5 minutes. The Australian subspecies generally feeds at lower depths, diving an average of 120 m (394&#x27;), and going as deep as 200 m (656&#x27;).

The brown fur seal&#x27;s main predators are the great white shark, and orcas (killer whales), as well as occasionally vagrant southern elephant seals. African land-based predators, primarily of pups, include black-backed jackals, brown hyenas and occasionally lions on the Skeleton Coast in Namibia. In addition, seagulls and other seabirds are thought to peck the eyes out of baby seals, especially sick or injured individuals, to render them helpless and disabled, as they begin to feast on their flesh.

In False Bay, the seals employ a number of defensive strategies while in shark-infested waters, such as:
*Swimming in large groups, and harassing sharks in the vicinity.
*Low porpoising, to increase subsurface vigilance.
*Darting in different directions, to cause confusion when attacked.
*Using their agility to stay out-of-reach.
*Swimming near the dorsal fin to stay clear of the shark&#x27;s jaws, when pursued.

==Behaviour==

===Acoustic behavior===
Australian fur seals are social animals that use vocalizations in a broad range of contexts. These vocalizations have been shown to contain individually unique properties important for enabling individual recognition.
This is particularly important for the reunion of mothers and pups that experience repeated separations whilst mothers are out at sea foraging, sometimes for days at a time. 
Upon their return, mothers need to locate their pups. This reunion process may also be facilitated through a combination of smell and spatial cues. 
In males, increases in testosterone and calling rates are seen in conjunction with the onset of the breeding season. Males can also differentiate neighboring males from stranger males, responding more aggressively to the vocalizations of strangers. This difference in response is suspected because the threat posed by a stranger is unknown and potentially greater than their neighbor, which they would have previously encountered while establishing their territories.

===Breeding behaviour===
Brown fur seals often gather into colonies on rookeries in numbers ranging from 500 to 1500, at least for the Australian subspecies. While fur seals spend most of the year at sea, they never fully evacuate the rookeries, as mothers and pups return to them throughout the year. No dispersal from a colony is established, although some fur seals from one colony have been found at another. True boundaries do not exist between the colonies. When at sea, they travel in small feeding groups. Brown fur seals begin to breed in the middle of October, when males haul out on shore to establish territories though display, vocalisations, sparring, and sometimes actual combat. They fast at this time and do not eat until after mating in November or December. When the females arrive, they fight among themselves for territories in which to give birth. Female territories are smaller than those of males and are always located within them. Females within a male&#x27;s territory can be considered part of his harem. However, males do not herd the females, which are free to choose their mates and judge them based on the value of their territories. For the Australian fur seals, 82% of copulations are performed by males whose territories are located directly at the water&#x27;s edge. Copulation between the male and his females begins 6 days after they give birth to their pups conceived from the previous year. However, a delay occurs in the implantation of the blastocyst, which lasts 4 months in the African subspecies and 3 months in the Australian subspecies. Gestation for the brown fur seal typically lasts a year less a few days.

After mating, females begin alternating brief periods of foraging at sea with several days ashore nursing their pups. Foraging trips last about 7 days in winter and about 4 days in summer and autumn. When a mother returns from sea to feed her pup, she emits a loud call which attracts all the nearby pups, but she only responds to her pup. She possibly can recognize her pup by smell. When left alone, pups gather in groups and play during the evening. Pups are usually weaned at 4–6 months old.

==Human interactions==
This species is an inquisitive and friendly animal when in the water, and often accompanies scuba divers. They swim around divers for periods of several minutes at a time, even at a depth of 60 m. On land, they are far less relaxed and tend to panic when humans come near them.

Australian fur seals were hunted intensively between 1798 and 1825 for commercial reasons. Seal hunting stopped in Australia in 1923, and their population is still recovering, causing increasing friction with South Australian fishermen as their range expands. Breeding and haul-out sites are protected by law. South African fur seals have a very robust and healthy population. Harvesting of seals was outlawed in South Africa in 1990.

Brown fur seals are still harvested in Namibia. Permits are issued for the killing of pups for their luxurious fur and adult males for their genitalia, which are considered an aphrodisiac in some countries. It is also considered necessary to limit seal numbers in Namibia because of the supposed effect seals have on the country&#x27;s fish harvest. Research by environmental groups disputes this.

=== Unexplained aggression ===
In January 2023, media reports indicated that seals have been attacking humans in South Africa, particularly in Cape Town area. Scientists believed it was due to the presence of a brain-altering poison in the fish they consume. The poison affects their behaviour making them more aggressive towards humans. Some attribute the aggressive behaviour to the surge of toxic red tide algae, fuelled by pollution and climate change. The incidents have increased in recent times, leading to concern and calls for further investigation.

In July 2024, it was confirmed that 17 seals along a 650-km stretch of coastline between Cape Town and Plettenberg Bay tested positive for rabies, and that could be the cause of the attacking behaviour in fur seals. The hypothesis is the rabies was acquired from black-backed jackals who prey on the seals; rabies is endemic among southern African jackals.

==Threat by marine debris and industry==
A 2021 study published in The Marine Pollution Bulletin found that the Brown fur seal colonies in Namibia are vulnerable to extensive entanglement in marine debris as a result of extensive pollution in the oceans. The study overall found that juveniles are more prone to become entangled in marine debris, and that 53% of all entanglements discovered were caused by fishing line. Another study by the University of Stirling conducted a similar study on marine pollution and found an almost identical percentage, 52%, of entanglements of brown fur seals were caused by fishing debris.

Ocean Conservation Namibia, a local animal conservation group based in Walvis Bay, was formed specifically by volunteers who capture entangled seals and free them from entanglement discarded by ships and fishing industries. The organization monitors the coast regularly but their founder, Naude Dreyer, told reporters of drastically declining numbers of seals as pollution continues to increase.

<doc id="906944" wikidata="Q1258722" url="?curid=906944" title="Drew Ginn">
<text>Drew Cameron Ginn OAM (born 20 November 1974) is an Australian five-time world champion rower, a four time Olympian and triple Olympic gold medallist. From 1995 to 1998 he was a member of Australia&#x27;s prominent world class crew – the coxless four known as the Oarsome Foursome.

== Club and state rowing ==
Ginn was educated at Scotch College, Melbourne where he took up rowing. His senior club rowing was done from the Mercantile Rowing Club in Melbourne.

His first state selection for Victoria came in the 1993 youth eight contesting the Noel Wilkinson Trophy in the Interstate Regatta at the Australian Rowing Championships. He rowed again in the Victorian youth eight in 1994, this time to victory in the Interstate Regatta. On twelve occasions between 1995 and 2008 he was selected in the Victorian senior men&#x27;s eight to contest the King&#x27;s Cup at the Interstate Regatta. Eight of those Victorian eights saw King&#x27;s Cup victories and Ginn stroked three King&#x27;s Cup eights, two to victory.

== National representative rowing ==
Ginn made his Australian representative debut in the 1994 U23 Trans Tasman series against New Zealand. He rowed in the Australian eight which won two of the three match races in the series. In 1994 he also contested the World Rowing U23 Championships in Paris rowing in the men&#x27;s eight. In 1995 he first contested senior World Rowing Championships rowing in the men&#x27;s eight to an eleventh placing in Tampere, Finland.

Ginn won gold in the men&#x27;s coxless four at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics as part of Australia&#x27;s &quot;Oarsome Foursome&quot;, along with Mike McKay, James Tomkins, and Nicholas Green – Ginn replaced the retired Andrew Cooper. In 1997 he secured a seat in the Australian men&#x27;s senior eight. He raced at the World Rowing Cup I in Lucerne that year and then at the 1997 World Rowing Championships in Aiguebelette, France he rowed in the seven seat for their third placing in the final and to a bronze medal. Ginn&#x27;s 1997 season in the Australian eight also included a campaign at the Henley Royal Regatta where as an Australian Institute of Sport crew they contested and won the 1997 Grand Challenge Cup.

At the 1998 World Championships, back in the Oarsome Foursome Ginn raced and won the men&#x27;s coxed four world title with Brett Hayman in the stern. Mike McKay and Ginn also took a silver medal at that same regatta as a coxless pair. In 1999, the foursome would go on to try out, but lose the 1999 Australian selection trials in a coxless four. Tomkins and Ginn decided to switch to a coxless pair and won the 1999 World Championship in St Catharines Canada.

Ginn and James Tomkins had planned to race the straight pair at the Sydney 2000 Summer Olympics, but Ginn suffered a severe back injury, forcing him to withdraw from the boat. In 2002, he returned to the water, teaming up with fellow Oarsome Foursome rower James Tomkins in a coxless pair; they finished fourth in the 2002 World Championships. In 2003, Ginn and Tomkins were the surprise winners, beating the British favourites—and defending champions—Matthew Pinsent and James Cracknell, which was a factor in Pinsent and Cracknell choosing to move to the coxless fours. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Ginn and Tomkins won the gold medal in the coxless pairs.

In 2006, Ginn made a return to international competition at the 2006 World Rowing Championships held at Dorney Lake, Eton. He and new pairs partner Duncan Free were able to win despite choppy tail conditions. In 2007 Ginn and Free successfully defended their coxless pairs title, posting a time of 6:24.87 minutes — almost 6 secs ahead of their New Zealand rivals (Nathan Twaddle and George Bridgewater) who had stuck with them for the first 1000 m before dropping behind to take the silver.

Early in 2008 Drew Ginn and his 2007 World Champion partner Free, were pre-selected to compete for Australia at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games where they won the gold medal as a coxless pair. 
At the 2012 London Olympics, Ginn won a silver medal in the Australian men&#x27;s coxless four, behind the all-conquering Great Britain men&#x27;s four, who went on to win gold in their fourth consecutive Olympics.

==Cycling career==
In 2009 Ginn took up competitive road bicycle racing, with immediate success, particularly in the discipline of the time trial. He won the 2009 Oceania time trial championships. However, in downplaying the achievement, Ginn noted two riders in the under-23 competition actually posted faster times over the same course on the same day.

In a much stronger field at the 2010 Australian national road championships, Ginn finished sixth.

==Accolades==
Ginn was awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) in the 1997 Australia Day Honours and the Australian Sports Medal in June 2000.

Scotch College, Melbourne, Ginn&#x27;s former school, named a racing eight &quot;Drew Ginn&quot; in his honour. The school&#x27;s first VIII won the APS Head of the River (Australia) in that boat in 1998.

In 2003 together with James Tomkins he was named with FISA male rower of the year. In 2004 he was appointed as an Athletes Commission member to the Australian Olympic Committee. In 2007 jointly with Duncan Free he was named FISA male rower of the year.

In 2010, Ginn was inducted as a member of the Rowing Victoria Hall of Fame.

In 2014, the International Rowing Federation awarded Ginn the Thomas Keller Medal for his outstanding international rowing career. It is the sport&#x27;s highest honour and is awarded within five years of the athlete&#x27;s retirement, acknowledging an exceptional rowing career and exemplary sportsmanship.

In October 2018, he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame.

<text>Emmanuel Larcenet, known as Manu Larcenet (born 6 May 1969) is a French cartoonist. He worked with Fluide Glacial magazine from 1995 to 2006 and with &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine from 1997 to 2004. He has also founded the French publisher Les Rêveurs in 1998. Since 2000, he mostly works with Dargaud.

==Biography==
Emmanuel Larcenet, also known as Manu Larcenet, was born in Issy-les-Moulineaux, Hauts-de-Seine, France. He studied graphic art at the Sèvres lycée and then went on to art school. While spending time as a singer in a punk-rock band, he published his first drawings in comics and rock fanzines. In October 1994, he was published in the French magazine Fluide Glacial (issue #220) with &quot;L&#x27;Expert comptable de la jungle&quot;, a first story rapidly followed by other complete ones, and republished later in comic books, in the series &quot;Soyons fous&quot;, &quot;La Loi des séries&quot; and &quot;Bill Baroud&quot;. Meanwhile, Larcenet was also actively working for Les rêveurs de rune. For this magazine and label specialising in fantasy, he created games called &quot;Raoul&quot;, &quot;D&#x27;ac Raoul&quot;, and, in 1997, &quot;Dallas cowboy&quot;.

From that year on, alone first and then with Gaudelette, he worked for &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine, publishing &quot;Pedro le Coati&quot;, among others. In 1998, still for Dupuis but with Jean-Michel Thiriet, he created &quot;La vie est courte&quot;. His other drawings were independently collected and published in 1996 and 1998 in &quot;30 millions d&#x27;imbéciles&quot; and &quot;Ni dieu, ni maître, ni croquettes&quot; by Glénat.

In 2000, he met Guy Vidal who would become responsible for the label Poisson Pilote at Dargaud. He became friends with him and started contributing to the Poisson Pilote label, drawing &quot;Les cosmonautes du futur&quot; based on a script by Lewis Trondheim, and later on &quot;Les Entremondes&quot; with his brother Patrice Larcenet. In June 2001, he left Paris for Lyon, keeping contact with Vidal. On a scenario by Jean-Yves Ferri, he participated in &quot;Le retour à la terre&quot;. Finally, he signed alone his next books : the &quot;Une aventure rocambolesque de...&quot;, &quot;Le combat ordinaire&quot; (this last one being granted an award by the Prize for Best Album at the Angoulême International Comics Festival) and &quot;Nic Oumouk&quot; series.

In 2024, Larcenet illustrated the graphic novel adaptation of Cormac McCarthy&#x27;s &quot;The Road&quot;, published by Abrams ComicArts.

<text>Gabriel Bibron (20 October 1805 – 27 March 1848) was a French zoologist and herpetologist. He was born in Paris. The son of an employee of the Museum national d&#x27;histoire naturelle, he had a good foundation in natural history and was hired to collect vertebrates in Italy and Sicily. Under the direction of Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent (1778–1846), he took part in the Morea expedition to Peloponnese.

He classified numerous reptile species with André Marie Constant Duméril (1774–1860), whom he had met in 1832. Duméril was interested mainly in the relations between genera, and he left to Bibron the task of describing the species. Working together they produced the &quot;Erpétologie Générale&quot;, a comprehensive account of the reptiles, published in ten volumes from 1834 to 1854. Also, Bibron assisted Duméril with teaching duties at the museum and was an instructor at a primary school in Paris.

Bibron contracted tuberculosis and retired in 1845 to Saint-Alban-les-Eaux, where he died aged 42.

==Taxa named in honor of Bibron==
Bibron is commemorated in the scientific names of ten species of reptiles.
*&quot;Afrotyphlops bibronii&quot;, a blind snake
*&quot;Atractaspis bibroni&quot;, a venomous snake
*&quot;Calliophis bibroni&quot;, a venomous snake
*&quot;Candoia bibroni&quot;, a boa
*&quot;Chondrodactylus bibronii&quot;, a gecko
*&quot;Diplolaemus bibronii&quot;, a lizard
*&quot;Enyalius bibronii&quot;, a lizard
*&quot;Eutropis bibronii&quot;, a skink
*&quot;Liolaemus bibronii&quot;, a lizard
*&quot;Pelochelys bibroni&quot;, a turtle

An eleventh species, which was more commonly known as &quot;Agama impalearis&quot;, had been named &quot;Agama bibronii&quot; by André Marie Constant Duméril in 1851, however a decision by the ICZN in 1971 confirmed that the correct name was &quot;A. bibroni&quot;.

<doc id="906958" wikidata="Q1805783" url="?curid=906958" title="Laplace plane">
<text>The Laplace plane or Laplacian plane of a planetary satellite, named after its discoverer Pierre-Simon Laplace (1749–1827), is a mean or reference plane about whose axis the instantaneous orbital plane of that satellite precesses.

Laplace&#x27;s name is sometimes applied to the invariable plane, which is the plane perpendicular to a system&#x27;s mean angular momentum vector, but the two should not be confused. They are equivalent only in the case where all perturbers and resonances are far from the precessing body.

==Definition==
The axis of this Laplace plane is coplanar with, and between, (a) the polar axis of the parent planet&#x27;s spin, and (b) the orbital axis of the parent planet&#x27;s orbit around the Sun. The Laplace plane arises because the equatorial oblateness of the parent planet tends to cause the orbit of the satellite to precess around the polar axis of the parent planet&#x27;s equatorial plane, while the solar perturbations tend to cause the orbit of the satellite to precess around the polar axis of the parent planet&#x27;s orbital plane around the Sun. The two effects acting together result in an intermediate position for the reference axis for the satellite orbit&#x27;s precession.

==Explanation==
In effect, this is the plane normal to the orbital precession pole of the satellite. It is a kind of &quot;average orbital plane&quot; of the satellite, around which the instantaneous orbital plane of the satellite precesses, and to which it has a constant additional inclination.

In most cases, the Laplace plane is very close to the equatorial plane of its primary planet (if the satellite is very close to its planet) or to the plane of the primary planet&#x27;s orbit around the Sun (if the satellite is far away from its planet). This is because the strength of the planet&#x27;s perturbation on the satellite&#x27;s orbit is much stronger for orbits close to the planet, but drops below the strength of the Sun&#x27;s perturbation for orbits farther away.

Examples of satellites whose Laplace plane is close to their planet&#x27;s &quot;equatorial&quot; plane include the satellites of Mars and the inner satellites of the giant planets. Examples of satellites whose Laplace plane is close to their planet&#x27;s &quot;orbital&quot; plane include Earth&#x27;s Moon and the outer satellites of the giant planets such as Phoebe. Some satellites, such as Saturn&#x27;s Iapetus, are situated in the transitional zone and have Laplace planes that are midway between their planet&#x27;s equatorial plane and the plane of its solar orbit.

So the varying positions of the Laplace plane at varying distances from the primary planet can be pictured as putting together a warped or non-planar surface, which may be pictured as a series of concentric rings whose orientation in space is variable: the innermost rings are near the equatorial plane of rotation and oblateness of the planet, and the outermost rings near its solar orbital plane. Also, in some cases, larger satellites of a planet (such as Neptune&#x27;s Triton) can affect the Laplace planes of smaller satellites orbiting the same planet.

==The work of Laplace==
The Laplace or Laplacean plane, as discussed here, relates to the orbit of a planetary satellite. It is to be distinguished from another and quite different plane, also discovered by Laplace, and which is also sometimes called the &quot;Laplacian&quot; or &quot;Laplace plane&quot;, but more often the invariable plane (or the &quot;invariable plane of Laplace&quot;). The invariable plane is simply derived from the sum of angular momenta, and is &quot;invariable&quot; over the entire system, while the Laplace plane may be different for different orbiting objects within a system. Confusingly, a satellite&#x27;s Laplace plane (as defined here) is also sometimes called its &quot;invariable plane&quot;.

The Laplace plane is a result of perturbational effects, which were discovered by Laplace while he was investigating the orbits of Jupiter&#x27;s principal moons (the Galilean satellites of Jupiter, the only ones known in Laplace&#x27;s time). Laplace found that the effects of the solar perturbing force, and of the planet&#x27;s oblateness (its equatorial bulge), together gave rise to an &quot;inclinaison propre&quot;, an &quot;own inclination&quot;, in the plane of the satellite orbits, relative to the plane of Jupiter&#x27;s equator.

<doc id="906961" wikidata="Q3303678" url="?curid=906961" title="McKinley National Memorial">
<text>The McKinley National Memorial in Canton, Ohio, United States, is the final resting place of William McKinley, who served as the 25th president of the United States from 1897 to his assassination in 1901. Canton was a significant place in McKinley&#x27;s life; it was where he lived, practiced as an attorney, and conducted his political campaigns.

==Memorial Association, contributions==
Following McKinley&#x27;s funeral, several of his closest advisors, including George B. Cortelyou, William R. Day of Canton and Ohio Senator Mark Hanna, met to discuss the location of a proper memorial to serve as a final resting place for the former president. It was from this meeting that the McKinley National Memorial Association was formed and Theodore Roosevelt chose the first Board of Trustees, with recommendations from the President&#x27;s widow, Ida Saxton McKinley. The Association chose a site often visited by President McKinley where he had once suggested that a monument be erected to honor soldiers and sailors from Stark County who had been killed in American wars.

By October 10, 1901, the Association issued a public appeal for $600,000 in contributions for the construction project. Ohio Governor George Nash supported the effort by proclaiming McKinley&#x27;s birthday in 1902 as a special day of observance by the state&#x27;s schools. On that day school children contributed to the memorial fund in large numbers by bringing in their pennies. In June 1903 contributions reached $500,000, and the Association invited people to submit design ideas for the proposed memorial. Contributions arrived from foreign nations, notably Great Britain.

==Designs, construction==
Over sixty designs were submitted, and Harold Van Buren Magonigle of New York City was selected as the winner of the competition. Magonigle envisioned a cross-hilted sword with a mausoleum located at the junction of the blade, guard, and hilt. The Long Water (a five-tiered reflecting pool which was 575 feet long) and main steps would form the handle of the sword. This design combined the cross of a martyr with the sword of a President who had acted as commander-in-chief during wartime.

Construction of the memorial began on June 6, 1905, when Magonigle removed the first shovel of soil from the site. By November 16 the cornerstone was laid in an official ceremony attended by the former First Lady, Ida Saxton McKinley, and other family members. More than 35,000 cubic yards (27,000 m³) of soil were added to create four terraces coinciding in height and pitch with the four runs of steps in the main staircase. The steps are wide and arranged in four flights of 24. Another 12 steps take visitors into the monument. In total, there are 108 steps from ground level to the top of the monument. The interior walls consist of Tennessee marble.

The 9-1/2 foot tall bronze statue depicting President McKinley delivering his final public address at Buffalo, New York, on September 5, 1901 was created by sculptor Charles Henry Niehaus. It is based on a photograph of the President taken by White House photographer Frances B. Johnston at the Pan-American Exposition the day before his assassination.

==Ceremony==
The McKinley National Memorial dedication on September 30, 1907 was one of the most memorable events in Canton&#x27;s history. President Theodore Roosevelt joined other dignitaries to observe a grand parade from the review stand at Public Square in downtown Canton. In the dedication ceremony, Supreme Court Justice William R. Day, President of the McKinley National Memorial Association and a former member of McKinley&#x27;s cabinet, delivered a narrative of events leading to the dedication. United States Poet Laureate James Whitcomb Riley read a memorial poem he wrote in honor of the fallen president. Finally, President Roosevelt, the principal speaker of the day, addressed the crowd, highlighting McKinley&#x27;s career. Mayor of Canton at the time, Arthur Richard Turnbull, also attended along with Ohio Governor Harris. The coffins of the President and First Lady are entombed above ground in double sarcophagi of green granite.

==Maintenance, re-dedication==
After the dedication the McKinley National Memorial Association continued to exercise administrative control of the monument, but it eventually became difficult for the Association to maintain the structure and the grounds. On October 20, 1943 the property was transferred to the Ohio State Archaeological and Historical Society, which is now the Ohio History Connection. In 1951 the State of Ohio completed a major rehabilitation to the site, including filling in the Long Water. The work was completed in time for a commemoration of the 50th anniversary of President McKinley&#x27;s death. A re-dedication of the Memorial was held on September 16, 1951.

The McKinley National Memorial returned to local control in 1973 when the property was transferred to the Stark County Historical Society. After five years of restoration work and enhancement of the grounds the McKinley National Memorial was rededicated on September 29, 1992. The William McKinley Presidential Library and Museum, also operated by the Stark County Historical Society, is located adjacent to the memorial.

<doc id="906963" wikidata="Q1681200" url="?curid=906963" title="James Tomkins (rower)">
<text>James Bruce Tomkins (born 19 August 1965) is an Australian rower, seven-time World Champion and a three-time Olympic gold medalist. He is Australia&#x27;s most awarded oarsman, having made appearances at six Olympic games (for three gold and one bronze medal); eleven World Championships (for seven world titles including one in each of the five sweep oar events); four Rowing World Cups (for two titles) and eighteen state representative King&#x27;s Cup appearances – the Australian blue riband men&#x27;s VIII event, (for fifteen victories, ten as stroke). Tomkins is one of only five Australian athletes and four rowers worldwide to compete at six Olympics. From 1990 to 1998 he was the stroke of Australia&#x27;s prominent world class crew – the coxless four known as the Oarsome Foursome.

==Club and state rowing==
Tomkins took up rowing at Carey Baptist Grammar School. He stroked the Carey First VIII in both of his senior years, 1982 and 1983. His long senior club career was with the Mercantile Rowing Club in Melbourne.

Tomkins was selected in Victorian state representative King&#x27;s Cup crews contesting the men&#x27;s Interstate Eight-Oared Championship at the Australian Rowing Championships on eighteen occasions from 1985 to 2004. Tomkins was in winning Victorian King&#x27;s Cup crews on fifteen occasions, for ten of which he was in stroke seat.

Tomkins competed in Mercantile colours in the National Regatta at the Australian Rowing Championships in coxless pairs and in coxed and coxless fours from 1985. He won Australian national titles at those Australian Rowing Championships in 1985, 1987 and 1988 in a 2-; in 1986 and 1987 in a 4+; and in 1988 and 1990 in a 4- with other members of the Oarsome Foursome.

==International representative rowing==
In 1985, Tomkins first made the Australian national team as stroke of the senior men&#x27;s eight for the 1985 World Rowing Championships in Hazewinkel Belgium. The Australian eight finished in ninth place. In 1986, the Australian eight stroked by Steve Evans won a gold medal at the 1986 World Rowing Championships in Nottingham, England with Tomkins rowing in the six seat. That same crew rowed to victory at the 1986 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh, and Tomkins won a Commonwealth Games gold medal. Tomkins also stroked a coxed four to a bronze medal at those same games.

At the World Championships in Copenhagen 1987 Tomkins was in the six seat when the men&#x27;s VIII finished in fourth place and at the 1988 Summer Olympics, the Australian eight finished fourth with Tomkins again rowing at six.

In 1990 with his Mercantile clubmates Samuel Patten and Mike McKay and Nick Green from the Melbourne University Boat Club, Tomkins began racing an Australian representative coxless four. Their success was immediate. They won the 1990 and 1991 World Championships. After Andrew Cooper replaced Samuel Patten, they followed up with a gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. The crew&#x27;s success gained them the nickname &quot;Oarsome Foursome&quot; and lifted the profile of rowing in Australia. The crew repeated its gold medal performance at the 1996 Summer Olympics, this time with Drew Ginn replacing Andrew Cooper.

At the 1998 World Championships, the Oarsome Foursome raced and won the men&#x27;s coxed four world title with Brett Hayman in the stern. Tomkins, Green and Hayman also took the world title at that same regatta as a coxed pair. In 1999, the boat would go on to try out, but lose the 1999 Australian selection trials in a coxless four. Tomkins and Drew Ginn decided to switch to a coxless pair and won the 1999 World Championship. This win established Tomkins as the first man to win a gold medal at World Championships in each of the five sweep rowing events.

Tomkins and Ginn had planned to row the pair at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, but while in Europe preparing for the games, a severe back injury requiring surgery sidelined Ginn. On short notice, Tomkins teamed with team alternate Matthew Long, (who had to switch from stroke side to bow side) and they raced a surprising third at the Lucerne World Cup race. Tomkins and Long were selected to represent Australia, and at the Olympics, they finished third behind France and the United States, just 1.3 seconds out of first place.

Returning to a coxless pair in 2002, Ginn and Tomkins beat the heavily favoured British crew of Matthew Pinsent and James Cracknell in a world cup race before finishing a close fourth at the 2002 World Championships. In 2003, Ginn and Tomkins reversed the prior years result winning the 2003 World Championship, with Pinsent and Cracknell placing fourth. In 2004, Pinsent and Cracknell moved to the coxless four to better their chances for a medal. Ginn and Tomkins would go on to win the coxless pair at the 2004 Summer Olympics, leading at every mark, beating Croatia by 2 seconds, with South Africa claiming the bronze.

Tomkins was selected in the men&#x27;s eight for the 2007 World Rowing Championships in Munich, placing a disappointing 4th. He competed in his sixth Olympic Games at Beijing following the disqualification of the Russian Federation boat as a result of a doping scandal. Tomkins was the Australian flag bearer at the Opening Ceremony. Tomkins and his crew finished last in the final of the men&#x27;s eight and 6th overall at the Beijing Games.

He is one of four athletes to compete in rowing at six Olympics, along with Romanian Elisabeta Oleniuc Lipă in 2004, Canadian cox Lesley Thompson, and Estonian Jüri Jaanson.

==Accolades==
James Tomkins was announced as the 2008 Victorian Father of the Year by the Father&#x27;s Day Council of Victoria Inc.

In 2010 he was inducted as a member of the Rowing Victoria Hall of Fame and that same year the International Rowing Federation awarded Tomkins the Thomas Keller Medal for his outstanding international rowing career. It is the sport&#x27;s highest honour and is awarded within five years of the athlete&#x27;s retirement, acknowledging an exceptional career and exemplary sportsmanship.

In 2012 he was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame and was elected to the IOC Athletes&#x27; Commission. He will serve as an IOC member for eight years.

Tomkins also helped to build the Carey/Yarra Yarra Boat Sheds on the Yarra River in Melbourne. There is an eight named after him in Carey boatshed.

<doc id="906975" wikidata="Q1357880" url="?curid=906975" title="Year-to-date">
<text>Year-to-date (YTD) refers to the period starting from the beginning of the current year (either the calendar year or fiscal year) and continuing up to the present day.

==Overview==
Year-to-date is used in various contexts to record the results of an activity from the beginning of the year up to the present day. This period excludes the current day if it is not yet complete.

In finance, YTD figures are often included in financial statements to detail the performance of a business entity. Providing YTD results for the current year, as well as for one or more past years as of the same date, allows owners, managers, investors, and other stakeholders to compare the company&#x27;s current performance with that of previous periods. Employees&#x27; income tax may also be based on their total earnings year-to-date.

YTD can describe the return for an investment so far this year. For example, if a stock has a YTD return of 8%, it means that from January 1 of the current year to the present date, the stock has appreciated by 8%.

Another example: if a property has a fiscal year-end of March 31, 2009, and the YTD rental income as of June 30, 2008, is $1,000, this indicates that the property earned $1,000 in rental income from April 1 through June 30, 2008 (the YTD period for the property).

Comparing YTD measures can be misleading if only a small portion of the year has elapsed or if the date is not clear. YTD measures are more sensitive to changes early in the year than later in the year. In contrast, measures like the 12-month ending (or year-ending) are less affected by seasonal influences.

For example, to calculate year-to-date invoicing for a company, sum the invoice totals for each month of the current year up to the present date.

==Example==
Example: YTD Invoicing report for May 3
 January Invoices-----$35,000
 February Invoices---- 40,000
 March Invoices------- 25,000
 April Invoices------- 45,000
 May Invoices--------- 5,000
 _______
 YTD Invoices 150,000

Alternate method:

 1st quarter Invoices-----$100,000
 April Invoices----------- 45,000
 May Invoices------------- 5,000
 _______
 YTD Invoices 150,000

Tax due as of the end of week 33 of the tax year is calculated on total pay from the beginning of week 1 until the end of week 33; tax payable for that week will be this total tax minus tax already paid.

<doc id="907000" wikidata="Q1232625" url="?curid=907000" title="Southern Manifesto">
<text>The Declaration of Constitutional Principles (known informally as the Southern Manifesto) was a document written in February and March 1956, during the 84th United States Congress, in opposition to racial integration of public places. The manifesto was signed by 19 US Senators and 82 Representatives from the Southern United States. The signatories included the entire congressional delegations from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia, most of the members from Florida and North Carolina, and several members from Tennessee and Texas. All of them were from the former Confederate states. 97 were Democrats; 4 were Republicans.

The Manifesto was drafted to support reversing the landmark Supreme Court 1954 ruling &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, which determined that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional. School segregation laws were some of the most enduring and best-known of the Jim Crow laws that characterized the South at the time.

&quot;Massive resistance&quot; to federal court orders requiring school integration was already being practiced across the South, and was not caused by the Manifesto. Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas had worked behind the scenes to tone down the original harsh draft. The final version did not pledge to nullify the &quot;Brown&quot; decision, nor did it support extralegal resistance to desegregation. Instead, it was mostly a states&#x27; rights attack against the judicial branch for overstepping its role.

The Southern Manifesto accused the Supreme Court of &quot;clear abuse of judicial power&quot; and promised to use &quot;all lawful means to bring about a reversal of this decision which is contrary to the Constitution and to prevent the use of force in its implementation.&quot; It suggested that the Tenth Amendment should limit the reach of the Supreme Court on such issues. Senators in the Southern Caucus led the opposition, with Strom Thurmond writing the initial draft and Richard Russell the final version.

Three Democratic Senators from the former Confederate states (all of whom had Presidential ambitions) did not sign:

* Al Gore Sr. and Estes Kefauver of Tennessee
* Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson of Texas 

The following Democratic Representatives from the former Confederate states also did not sign:

* 16 of 21 Democrats from Texas, including Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn and future Speaker Jim Wright
* 1 of 7 Democrats from Tennessee 
* 3 of 11 Democrats from North Carolina 
* 1 of 7 Democrats from Florida (Dante Fascell)

Also, none of the 12 U.S. Senators or 39 U.S. House Representatives from the states of Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Oklahoma signed the Manifesto despite all requiring segregation in their public school systems prior to the &quot;Brown v. Board&quot; decision.

There were seven Republican Representatives and three Senators from former Confederate states. Only four signed the Manifesto: Charles Jonas of North Carolina, William Cramer of Florida, Joel Broyhill and Richard Poff of Virginia.

== Key quotes ==
*&quot;The unwarranted decision of the Supreme Court in the public school cases is now bearing the fruit always produced when men substitute naked power for established law.&quot;
*&quot;The original Constitution does not mention education. Neither does the 14th Amendment nor any other amendment. The debates preceding the submission of the 14th Amendment clearly show that there was no intent that it should affect the system of education maintained by the States.&quot;
*&quot;This unwarranted exercise of power by the Court, contrary to the Constitution, is creating chaos and confusion in the States principally affected. It is destroying the amicable relations between the white and Negro races that have been created through 90 years of patient effort by the good people of both races. It has planted hatred and suspicion where there has been heretofore friendship and understanding.&quot;

==Signatories and non-signatories==
In many southern States, signing was much more common than not signing, with signatories including the entire delegations from Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Virginia. Those from southern states who refused to sign are noted below.

===United States Senate (in state order)===

===United States House of Representatives ===

Known at first as Prahran South, the suburb&#x27;s name was changed to Windsor in 1891, after Windsor, Berkshire. It is often incorrectly referred to as Prahran, Windsor&#x27;s northern neighbour. In the past, Windsor was within the City of Prahran&#x27;s boundaries and many institutions still refer to this.

A Windsor Post Office opened in 1856, but was renamed St Kilda in 1858. The Windsor Post Office in the area opened in 1886.

==Demographics==
62.1% were born in Australia. Other countries of birth were England 5%, Greece 3.1%, New Zealand 3.1%, China (excluding Taiwan &amp; SARs) 1.5% &amp; Ireland 1.2%.

71.8 Spoke only English at home. Other Language used at home top responses were Greek 5.6%, Mandarin 1.9, Spanish 1.6%, Russian 1.1% &amp; Turkish 1%.

==Today==

Although Stonnington&#x27;s smallest suburb, Windsor has its own bank, supermarket and historic pubs, along with a growing number of independent clothing stores, restaurants, bars, lounges and cafés. Windsor contains a diverse mix of housing, including medium density apartments, Victorian terrace housing and a high-rise public housing tower. The Prahran campus of Swinburne University used to be located just south of High Street in Windsor, but this is now Melbourne Polytechnic – Prahran Campus, although it is actually in Windsor. The National Institute of Circus Arts is in Green Street, Windsor.

The painkiller Aspro was invented by the chemist George Nicholas in Windsor. Nuttelex margarine was also manufactured in Windsor for many years but production shifted in the last few years to Knoxfield.

==Landmarks==

The suburb has many landmarks, including the historic &quot;Presentation Convent&quot; (now the secondary school St Mary&#x27;s College), the Windsor Primary School, old post office, Telstra exchange tower and a campus of Swinburne University. In recent times, the large &quot;Empire Cinemas&quot;, converted into a nightclub, was gutted by fire before eventually being demolished and replaced by high-rise apartments, also named the Empire.

The remains of one side of Punt Road at the Windsor end contains one of Windsor&#x27;s lesser shopping strips, called &quot;Little Windsor on Punt&quot;.

The suburb also features new design, including the award-winning Windsor Fire station, by architects Edmund and Corrigan. In Raleigh Street are the K2 apartments, a Sustainable architecture built in 2006, to the design of Hansen Yuncken and features passive solar design, recycled and sustainable materials, photovoltaic cells, wastewater treatment, rainwater collection and solar hot water.

There are many remaining hotels in the suburb, including the popular &quot;Windsor Castle&quot; and &quot;The Windsor Alehouse&quot;.

The new Prahran High School has been built on part of the grounds of what is now Melbourne Polytechnic. The new High School is a vertical school consisting of 4 levels with a gymnasium on the top floor. The school officially opened in 2019.

==Transport==
Windsor is serviced by a number of trams along Dandenong Road, High Street and Chapel Street (routes 5, 6, 64, and 78) with Metro Trains Melbourne&#x27;s Sandringham railway line takes commuters from Windsor station to the CBD in 10 minutes. The 216 and 219 bus routes operate along Williams Road.

Punt Road is one of the main bus thoroughfares in Melbourne, with route 246 passing through the western side of the suburb.

<text>Litter consists of waste products that have been discarded incorrectly, without consent, at an unsuitable location. The waste is objects, often man-made, such as aluminum cans, paper cups, food wrappers, cardboard boxes or plastic bottles, but also large and hazardous items of rubbish such as tires, electrical appliances, electronics, batteries and large industrial containers are sometimes dumped in isolated locations, such as national forests and other public lands.

Litter is a type of human impact on the environment and is a serious environmental problem in many countries. Litter can exist in the environment for long periods of time before decomposition and be transported over large distances into the world&#x27;s oceans. Litter can negatively affect quality of life.

Cigarette butts are the most littered item in the world, with an estimated 4.5 trillion discarded each year. Estimates of the required time for cigarette butts to break down vary, ranging from 5 to 400 years for complete degradation.

==Causes==

In addition to intentional littering, almost half of litter on U.S. roadways is now accidental or unintentional litter, usually debris that falls off improperly secured trash, recycling collection vehicles and pickup trucks. Population levels, traffic density and proximity to waste disposal sites are factors known to correlate with higher litter rates.

Illegally dumped hazardous waste may be a response to the costs of dropping materials at designated sites: some of these charge a fee for depositing hazardous material. Lack of access to nearby facilities that accept hazardous waste may deter use. Additionally, ignorance of the laws that regulate the proper disposal of hazardous waste may cause improper disposal.

According to a study by the Dutch organization VROM, 80% of people claim that &quot;everybody leaves a piece of paper, tin or something, on the street behind&quot;. Young people from 12 to 24 years cause more litter than the average (Dutch or Belgian) person; only 18% of people who regularly cause litter were 50 years of age or older. However, a 2010 survey of littering in Maine, New Hampshire and Vermont in the United States, placed litterers aged 55 and over at less than 5%. The same observational study estimated that 78% of litterers are male. Litter organizations, such as Keep America Beautiful affiliates, Keep Northern Ireland Beautiful, and the Bay Area Stormwater Management Agencies Association, have focused educational efforts on youth littering. 
Negligent or lenient law enforcement contributes to littering behavior. Other causes are inconvenience, entitlement and economic conditions. A survey of dumping in Pennsylvania found that the largest number of illegal dumps were in townships without municipal trash hauling. The same report also cites unavailability of curbside trash and recycling service, shortage of enforcement, and habit as possible causes. The presence of litter invites more littering.

===Two-stage process model===
The two-stage process model of littering behavior describes the different ways in which people litter. The model was proposed by Chris Sibley and James Liu and differentiates between two types of littering: active and passive.

The theory has implications for understanding the different types of litter reduction interventions that will most effectively reduce littering in a given environment. The theory states that, all things being equal, passive littering will be more resistant to change because of two psychological processes: 1. diffusion of responsibility that increases as the latency between when an individual places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory, and 2. forgetting, which is also more likely to occur at longer delays between when an individual places litter in the environment and when they vacate the territory.

==Life cycle==
Litter can remain visible for extended periods of time before it eventually biodegrades, with some items made of condensed glass, styrofoam or plastic possibly remaining in the environment for over a million years.

About 18 percent of litter, usually traveling through stormwater systems, ends up in local streams, rivers, and waterways. Uncollected litter can accrete and flow into streams, local bays and estuaries. Litter in the ocean either washes up on beaches or collects in ocean gyres such as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch. About 80 percent of marine debris comes from land-based sources.

Some litter that is collected can be recycled; however, degraded litter cannot be recycled and eventually degrades to sludge, often toxic. The majority of litter that is collected goes to landfills.

==Effects==
Litter can have a detrimental impact on humans and the environment in different ways.

===Effects on humans===
Hazardous materials encapsulated within tires and other items of illegally dumped rubbish can leach into water sources, contaminate the soil and pollute the air.

Tires are the most often dumped hazardous waste. In 2007 the United States generated 262 million scrap tires. Thirty-eight states have laws that ban whole tires being deposited in landfills. Many of these discarded tires end up illegally dumped on public lands. Tires can become a breeding ground for insect vectors which can transmit disease to humans. Mosquitoes, which breed in stagnant water, can transmit West Nile virus and malaria. Rodents nest in accumulated tires and can transmit diseases such as Hantavirus.

When tires are burned, they can smolder for long periods of time, emitting hundreds of chemical compounds that pollute the air causing respiratory illnesses. Additionally the residue left behind can harm the soil and leach into groundwater.

Visual pollution is a major effect of litter.

Open containers such as paper cups, cardboard food packets, plastic drink bottles and aluminum drinks cans get filled up with rainwater, providing breeding locations for mosquitoes. In addition, a spark or a lightning flash can start a fire if it strikes litter such as a paper bag or cardboard box.

Litter can be hazardous to health. Debris falling from vehicles is an increasing cause of automobile accidents. Discarded dangerous goods, chemicals, tires, sharps waste and pathogens resulting from litter can cause accidental harm to humans.

Litter also carries substantial cost to the economy. Cleaning up litter in the US costs hundreds of dollars per ton, about ten times more than the cost of trash disposal, with a cost totaling about $11 billion per year.

===Effects on wildlife===

Animals may get trapped or poisoned with litter in their habitats. Cigarette butts and filters are a threat to wildlife and have been found in the stomachs of fish, birds and whales, who have mistaken them for food. Also, animals can get trapped in the rubbish and be in serious discomfort. For example, the plastic used to hold beverage cans together can get wrapped around animals&#x27; necks and cause them to suffocate as they grow. Other instances where animals could be harmed by litter include broken glass lacerating the paws of dogs, cats, and other small mammals.

===Other effects===
Organic litter in large amounts can cause water pollution and lead to algal blooms. Cigarettes could also start fires if they are not put out and then discarded in the environment.

==Extent==
Litter is an environmental concern in many countries around the world. While countries in the developing world lack the resources to deal with the issue, consumer-based economies in the western world are capable of generating larger quantities of litter per capita due to a higher consumption of disposable products.

===Branded litter===
A number of credible studies have shown that fast food packaging is one of the most common forms of litter, while McDonald&#x27;s is the most common brand of litter, despite having messages to dispose of it properly, such as the Ronald McDonald &quot;tidy man&quot; marking. According to Keep Britain Tidy in 2013, Cadbury chocolate wrappers, Walkers crisp packets and Coca-Cola cans were the three top brands that were the most common pieces of rubbish found in UK streets.

==Solutions==

===Litter bins===

Public waste containers or street bins are provided by local authorities to be used as a convenient place for the disposal and collection of litter. Increasingly both general waste and recycling options are provided. Local councils collect the waste and take it for reuse or recycling. However, there are some problems with this approach; if the bins are not emptied regularly, then the bins will overflow and can increase litter indirectly. Some local authorities will only take responsibility for rubbish that is placed in the bins, which means that litter remains a problem. People may blame a lack of well-placed bins for their littering. Hazardous materials may often be incorrectly disposed of in the bins and they can encourage dumpster diving.

===Cleanup===
Volunteers, sometimes alone or coordinated through organizations, pick up litter and dispose of it. Clean up events may be organized in which participants will sometimes comb an area in a line to ensure that no litter is missed. Organizations may promote litter cleanup events and may also have separate media campaigns to prevent littering.

In North America, Adopt a Highway programs are popular, in which companies and organizations commit to cleaning stretches of road. Keep America Beautiful has held litter cleanups called the Great America Cleanup since 1998 in over 20,000 communities nationwide.

Earth Day cleanups have been held globally since 1970. In 2019, Earth Day Network partnered with Keep America Beautiful and National Cleanup Day for the inaugural nationwide Earth Day CleanUp. Cleanups were held in all 50 States, 5 US Territories, 5,300 sites and had more than 500,000 volunteers.

Commercial properties such as retail, office and industrial have litter picking maintenance programs. This service may be provided by property owners or contracted to various service providers by property management companies acting on owner&#x27;s behalf. Litter picking is performed on foot using simple hand tools. A worker will walk the sidewalks, parking lot and landscape and sweep up litter material into a litter collection tool. Contents are emptied into a waste bin on job site.

In Kiwayu, a Kenyan island, some of the collected litter (flip-flops) is used to make art, which is then sold.

===Litter traps===

Litter traps can be used to capture litter as it exits stormwater drains into waterways. However, litter traps are only effective for large or floating items of litter and must be maintained. A recent watershed litter survey showed a difference in the composition of street litter and stormwater litter.

===Monitoring dumping sites===
Increasingly, there have been efforts to use technology to monitor areas prone to dumping. In Japan, a study used Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map areas of dumping based on site characteristics.
Another study used satellite images to detect possible illegal dumping sites.

===Container deposit legislation===
Container deposit legislation can be aimed at both reducing littering and also encouraging picking up through local recycling programs that offer incentives, particularly for aluminium cans, glass bottles and plastic bottles. In New York, an expanded bottle bill that included plastic water bottles increased recycling rates and generated 120 million dollars in revenue to the state General Fund from unclaimed deposits in 2010.

In some countries such as Germany and the Netherlands, container-deposit legislation has been introduced on cans and plastic bottles. Parts of Belgium are also considering adopting such legislation. People can thus collect refund value money from this type of waste. The result of this is that in Germany, hardly any cans or plastic bottles can still be found along the road. In the Netherlands, the amount of litter has dropped considerably since the new law was implemented, and 95% of the plastic bottles are now recycled. According to Chris Snick, the revenue that can be obtained from waste picking can be financially profitable in countries where container deposit legislation has been introduced: in 1 hour he managed to pick up 108 cans and 31 plastic bottles, earning him 13.90 euro (€0.10 per can/plastic bottle). By comparison, in countries where only the value of the aluminum for example would be refunded, 139 cans would yield only 1.72 euro (0.0124 euro per can; assuming there is 15 grams of aluminum in a can, and with scrap aluminum valued at 0.8267 euro/kg).

===Fines===

Some countries and local authorities have introduced legislation to address the problem.

Actions resulting in fines can include on-the-spot fines for individuals administered by authorised officers in public or on public transport or littering from a vehicle, in which the vehicle owner is fined - reported by either responsible officer or third party, sometimes online.

Specific legislation exists in the following countries:
*United States - punishable by a minimum fine of $200 and a maximum fine of $1,000 or even more in some states for a first offence, community service, or both, as set out by state statutes and city ordinances. All 50 states have anti-litter laws, with various fines, community service, and/or imprisonment as possible punishment.
*United Kingdom - Leaving litter is an offence under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. This was extended by the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 under section 18. It carries a maximum penalty of £2500 upon conviction. However, many local authorities issue fixed penalty notices under section 88 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Often incorrectly known as &quot;on the spot fines&quot;, they do not have to be issued on the spot. Nor are they a fine. If an alleged offender does not want to pay a fixed penalty notice, they can have the case heard in the Magistrates Court.
*Australia - no national legislation, although state based environmental protection authorities have laws and fines to discourage littering.
*The Netherlands - Dutch police and local supervisors (known as &quot;buitengewoon opsporingsambtenaar&quot;, or BOA) fine citizens for throwing away cans, bottles or wrappers on the street.
*Switzerland - dumping refuse and household waste inappropriately or illegally incurs a heavy fine.

==Anti-litter campaigns==
Many groups exist with the aim of raising awareness and run campaigns including clean up events. 

In the United States there are a number of organizations running anti-litter campaigns. Keep America Beautiful was founded in 1953, and promulgated the word &quot;litterbug&quot;, coined by its partner the Ad Council in 1947. At least 38 states have high profile, government-recognized slogan campaigns, including Don&#x27;t Mess with Texas; Let&#x27;s Pick It Up New York; Don&#x27;t Trash California; Take Pride in Florida; Keep Iowa Beautiful. 

In Australia, Clean Up Australia Day is supported by many major Australian companies, firms and volunteers alike. Anti-litter organizations include &quot;Keep Australia Beautiful&quot;, founded in 1963. It created the popular &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot; campaign and its Tidy Towns competition became well known being a very competitive expression of civic pride.

Keep Britain Tidy is a British campaign run by the Keep Britain Tidy environmental charity, which is part funded by the UK government.

==History==
Throughout human history, people have disposed of unwanted materials onto streets, roadsides, in small local dumps or often in remote locations. Prior to reforms within cities in the mid-to-late 19th century, sanitation was not a government priority. The growing piles of waste led to the spread of disease.

Anti-littering legislation seems to have existed in ancient Greece, as is evidenced by a road marker discovered on the island of Paros, bearing the inscription &quot;whoever drops their litter on the street owes 51 drachmae to whoever wishes to claim them&quot;.

To address the growing amount of waste generated in the United States, the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1965 was enacted. In 1976 the Federal government amended the Solid Waste Disposal Act, creating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), which requires a &quot;cradle to grave&quot; approach to the proper handling of potentially hazardous materials. RCRA gives authority to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate and enforce proper hazardous waste disposal.
Many countries now have laws that require that household hazardous waste be deposited in a special location rather than sent to landfills with regular refuse. Household hazardous waste includes paints and solvents, chemicals, light bulbs, fluorescent lights, spray cans, disposable batteries, and yard products such as fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides and insecticides. Additionally, medical waste generated at home is considered a hazardous waste and must be disposed of properly.

<doc id="907016" wikidata="Q8024714" url="?curid=907016" title="Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn">
<text>Windsor Terrace is a small residential neighborhood in the central part of the New York City borough of Brooklyn. It is bounded by Prospect Park on the east and northeast, Park Slope at Prospect Park West, Green-Wood Cemetery, and Borough Park at McDonald Avenue on the northwest, west, and southwest, and Kensington at Caton Avenue on the south. As of the 2010 United States Census, Windsor Terrace had 20,988 people living within its area.

Windsor Terrace is part of Brooklyn Community District 7, and its primary ZIP Codes are 11215 and 11218. It is patrolled by the 72nd Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Fire services are provided by Engine Company 240/Battalion 48 of the New York City Fire Department. Politically, Windsor Terrace is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 38th and 39th Districts.

==History==
Before the coming of Europeans to the New World, the area which is now Windsor Terrace was inhabited by the Canarsee Indians. Specifically, the Gowanus and Werpos tribes inhabited the surrounding area. The land, which was then in the far northwestern corner of the Town of Flatbush, was purchased as a farm by John Vanderbilt. Some parts of the land were also maintained by the Martense family, who owned land in the area through 1895. This area was desirable due to its proximity to downtown Brooklyn, as well as the recent construction of the Coney Island Plank Road through the area and of the serene Green-Wood Cemetery to the southwest.

Following Vanderbilt&#x27;s death, his land was divided in two. Vanderbilt&#x27;s land were sold to William Bell, a real estate developer, in 1849. Bell subdivided the land into 47 building lots, and, unlike some other developers in the general area, was able to sell them rather quickly. Bell then renamed the area after one of the multiple places named Windsor in England. Bell sold part of the land to Edward Belknap in 1851, and Belknap subsequently built four streets on which he marked 49 lots for future &quot;Pleasant Cottages.&quot; The development was incorporated as the Village of Windsor Terrace, which was bounded by Church Avenue on the south, McDonald Avenue on the west, the Brooklyn–Flatbush town line on the north, and Prospect Park Southwest and Coney Island Avenue on the east. The &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot; first referred to the area as &quot;Windsor Terrace&quot; in March 1854. By 1856, Belknap had lost his land due to foreclosure.

The area was generally desirable due to its prime location in the far northwest of the Town of Flatbush; close to the City of Brooklyn, yet located far enough outside it that residents of Windsor Terrace were willing to move there for its suburban ambience; and within walking distance of the Coney Island and Brooklyn Railroad&#x27;s horsecar line. Additional blocks were developed in 1862, when the village had 30 inhabitants living in twelve houses. The village kept growing through the 1870s, boasting a Protestant chapel by 1874, a public school by 1876, and its own volunteer fire department by 1888. The village remained rural in feel until around 1900, when row houses began to be built throughout the area, at first along Prospect Park SW.

Development began to pick up pace during the 1920s as rumors circulated that the neighborhood would soon be served by the New York City Subway. There were a lot of single-family and two-family houses being built, as well as stores being opened on 11th Avenue and two apartment buildings being erected on Prospect Avenue. Many of the new occupants of Windsor Terrace were Irish-Americans, many of whose families remain there to this day. The 1933 arrival of the Independent Subway System (IND) ushered in an era of apartment-building construction.

Even into the 1960s, Windsor Terrace was an isolated neighborhood with a quiet small-town feel to it, although the construction of the Prospect Expressway brought more through-traffic past the area. Gentrification of the neighborhood began in the 1980s, with families who could not afford the prices in Brooklyn Heights and Park Slope coming to Windsor Terrace instead, looking for more affordable real estate. During this time, the old square block-sized Pilgrim Laundry, site of an ancient Victorian-era brick edifice at the corner of Prospect Avenue and Terrace Place, was razed and replaced with 17 two-family houses constructed in 1983. The houses were funded with the cooperation of a public-private partnership and sold through lottery to locals. This brought attention to the need for affordable housing in Brooklyn, and in the late 1980s, the neighborhood was rezoned to prevent the construction of high-rise buildings in order to retain the small-town fabric of the existing neighborhood. However, by then, gentrification of the neighborhood had started, and would continue through the 2000s.

Residents protested after Key Food, the only major supermarket in the neighborhood, closed down in 2015. A new, smaller Key Food-owned store called Windsor Farms Market was opened and is currently operating in a portion of the old location. A food co-op called &quot;Windsor Terrace Food Coop&quot;, using the model of the Park Slope Food Coop, was also organized at the same time. The co-op serves both as a supplier of food and a community focal point. To become a member, residents must pay a one-time fee and commit to a work requirement, although memberships from other Brooklyn food co-ops are honored. The food, especially produce, is often higher quality and lower in price than at local supermarkets.
==Location and street grid==

===Boundaries===
Windsor Terrace, which is part of Community Board 7, consists of a narrow, nine-block-wide area. Located in central Brooklyn, the neighborhood has a &quot;curved, somewhat comma-like shape&quot;. The neighborhood lies between Green-Wood Cemetery to the southwest and Prospect Park to the northeast, split down the middle by the Prospect Expressway. Adjacent neighborhoods include Park Slope to the northeast and Kensington to the south. According to &quot;The Neighborhoods of Brooklyn&quot;, Windsor Terrace is bounded by Prospect Park West on the north, Prospect Park SW and Coney Island Avenue on the east, Caton Avenue on the south and McDonald Avenue on the west. However, the &quot;Encyclopedia of New York City&quot; gives the boundaries as Seventh Avenue and Prospect Park W on the north, Prospect Park SW to the east, and Green-Wood Cemetery to the south and west. Other sources extend the northwest corner to Eighth Avenue along 15th Street and 20th Street.

Windsor Terrace straddles the line between the original Dutch Colonial Brooklyn towns of Brooklyn and Flatbush, as can be seen from its street grid that is bent approximately northeast–southwest along present-day Terrace Place. Old South Brooklyn (which now finds itself more westerly in disposition within the expanded boundaries of modern, consolidated Brooklyn) is located to the north of Terrace Place in the direction of 11th Avenue, and the Town of Flatbush lay to the south, located in the direction of Seeley Street. The grid of old Brooklyn, which is tilted at an angle, is adjacent to the Flatbush grid, which is roughly aligned with the cardinal directions, at this juncture. The only other still-extant nuance of this ancient Dutch boundary is the legacy of original Catholic Parish boundaries, which are between Holy Name of Jesus to the north and Immaculate Heart of Mary to the south, and ZIP Codes applied much later (11215 to the north and 11218 to the south). In this area, Vanderbilt Street, named after John Vanderbilt, splits western Brooklyn&#x27;s general street grid (comprising numbered avenues from 1st–101st Streets) and southeastern Brooklyn&#x27;s general street grid (comprising lettered avenues from East 1st to East 108th Streets).

===Streets===
There are three streets between 16th and 17th Streets in the Windsor Terrace street grid, since the streets diverge from each other from Park Slope eastward. The northernmost of the streets is Windsor Place, which runs between 7th Avenue and Prospect Park Southwest. The southernmost of the streets is Prospect Avenue, which continues southward to Ocean Parkway (near the Fort Hamilton Parkway overpass across the Prospect Expressway) and northward to Third Avenue. Running between these two streets from 10th Avenue to Terrace Place, Sherman Street is named after Roger Sherman, a signatory of the Declaration of Colonial Rights, the United States Declaration of Independence, the Articles of Confederation, and the United States Constitution. The street name &quot;Windsor Place&quot; has been applied to two different streets throughout the neighborhood&#x27;s history. The current Windsor Place was formerly Braxton Street before the 1900s, while 16th Street between Prospect Park W and Prospect Park SW was known as &quot;Windsor Place&quot; before then.

Prospect Park West takes the place of 9th Avenue in the Windsor Terrace grid, and continues with the &quot;Prospect Park West&quot; name south of Prospect Park&#x27;s borders, continuing southeastward to Green-Wood Cemetery, where it ends in a cul-de-sac. The stretch of Prospect Park West between 16th Street and Green-Wood Cemetery has always been called the same name as the stretch adjoining Prospect Park; the entire street was formerly and officially named 9th Avenue.

Southeast of Prospect Park West, past Bartel-Pritchard Square, 15th Street becomes Prospect Park Southwest. The road bends noticeably between 11th Avenue and 16th Street; Prospect Park Southwest was previously known as Coney Island Avenue and originally known as the &quot;Coney Island Plank Road&quot; in the days of unpaved roads, when logs or &quot;planks&quot; were laid for stability and to keep the mud down. The southernmost stretch of Prospect Park Southwest, south of the bend at the termination of 16th Street, still retains Coney Island Avenue&#x27;s street numbering system.

Prospect Avenue extends from Hamilton Avenue to Ocean Parkway and is crossed by a bridge at Seeley Street. The northern part was originally known as Middle Street and had its southernmost limit at what is now Terrace Place. An attempt was made in 1865 to change the name of Middle Street to Sterling Street, possibly for Lord Stirling, but was vetoed by Mayor Alfred M. Wood. Prospect Park&#x27;s establishment required additional access, and in 1868 the New York Legislature passed an act that provided for Middle Street&#x27;s renaming to Prospect Avenue and its widening from . Maps made in 1874 for the Kings County Town Survey Commission provided for a extension of Prospect Avenue into the Town of Flatbush; however, this was stymied by a steep, boulder-strewn terminal moraine, and the fact that the city of Brooklyn&#x27;s and town of Flatbush&#x27;s sections of the road were misaligned. In 1903, plans were approved to correct the misalignment; Prospect Avenue was extended through the cut, and Seely Street was placed over Prospect Avenue on a concrete-and-steel arch bridge.

====Co-named streets====
16th Street is co-named &quot;Captain Vincent E. Brunton Way&quot; after a New York City Fire Department captain who died in the September 11 attacks. 10th Avenue is also co-named &quot;John P. Devaney Boulevard&quot; in this area after a firefighter who died while trying to rescue residents of a burning Red Hook building in 1989.

====Traffic circles====
Traffic circles are relatively rare in New York City, but Windsor Terrace has three of them, all framing Prospect Park entrances along the park&#x27;s border. The northernmost, a medium-sized traffic circle named Bartel-Pritchard Square, is at the intersection of Prospect Park West, Prospect Park Southwest, and 15th Street, and contains an ornate entrance framed with two columns. Another traffic circle was built at Prospect Park Southwest and 16th Street, although it no longer operates as a circle. The southernmost, a large traffic circle named Park Circle, is at the convergence of Prospect Park Southwest, Coney Island Avenue, Parkside Avenue, Ocean Parkway, and Fort Hamilton Parkway, and was reconstructed in 2010. Park Circle&#x27;s entrance to Prospect Park is designed in a style similar to the Bartel-Pritchard Square entrance.

==Demographics==
Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Windsor Terrace was 20,988, an increase of 209 (1.0%) from the 20,779 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 64.9% (13,616) White, 6.2% (1,298) African American, 0.1% (31) Native American, 9.9% (2,076) Asian, 0.0% (0) Pacific Islander, 0.7% (151) from other races, and 2.5% (531) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 15.7% (3,285) of the population.

==Culture==

Windsor Terrace is home to mainly Irish-, German-, Polish-, and Italian-American families, many having settled in its brick row and wood-frame houses when the neighborhood was first developed. The overwhelming majority of residents – many of whom can trace their family histories in Windsor Terrace back multiple generations – are Irish-American. They are traditionally affiliated with either Holy Name Church and School (the church having been built in 1874 and the school having been built in 1923, both located on present-day Prospect Park W), or Immaculate Heart of Mary (located on Fort Hamilton Parkway in Windsor Terrace&#x27;s southeastern extremity). Other smaller Protestant denominations exist nearby, such as the Memorial Baptist Church at 16th Street and 8th Avenue, and Holy Apostles Episcopal on Greenwood Avenue. Over time, Windsor Terrace has become increasingly diverse, as Greek and Hispanic residents have moved in. There is also a minority of Syrians, Maronite Lebanese, and Jewish-Americans. The local synagogue is the Chabad Jewish Center. There is also a newer place of worship, the Calvary Cathedral of Praise at Caton Place and East Eighth Street.

By the 2000s and 2010s, an influx of residents seeking affordable family housing had pushed property prices up. In 2015, houses in various parts of Windsor Terrace sold for about $1.2 million to $2 million in 2015, and apartments cost from $400,000 for a one-bedroom apartment to more than $1 million for a three-bedroom apartment. Windsor Terrace is becoming more ethnically diverse and culturally active, owing to a demographic change since the 1990s, when the area had a more elderly population and not as many families with young children. The increased presence of many families with young kids has not indicated a significant cultural change in the neighborhood.

However, despite the increased population, the area still maintains a bit of small-town atmosphere, with relatively low house turnover. A real estate broker who grew up in the area said that in Windsor Terrace, &quot;everybody says hello&quot; to each other, and a real-estate feature in &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that &quot;residents look out for one another at all hours of the day.&quot; There is more on-street vehicle parking in Windsor Terrace than in nearby, more populous neighborhoods. The area&#x27;s lack of traffic lights, due to low traffic volumes, make Windsor Terrace feel like a small town, as do well-maintained one-family houses, some with covered balconies and stained glass windows; other houses with &quot;bay windows, both rounded and faceted&quot;; and yet other &quot;clapboard Italianate&quot; houses with multicolored cornices. There are a few apartment buildings, including Windsor Tower, a 10-story building that was downgraded from 22 stories after community objections; a 73-unit, seven-floor rental building that opened in 2015; and a condominium tower at 279 Prospect Park W, a former paint factory storage building that posed as a bank in the 1975 movie &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;. The houses are of varying types, including some small one-story clapboard houses that have attics and date to the neighborhood&#x27;s development; larger two-story houses with basements and some wood framing on the exterior; and attached brick townhouses with either flat facades with normal-sized windows or curved facades with bay windows, both with two floors and a basement.

The neighborhood is mostly residential, with some commerce along Prospect Park W, Prospect Avenue, and Fort Hamilton Parkway. The latter two corridors have seen an increased commercial presence since the 2000s, but these new stores are mostly family-owned businesses, with the exception of a Walgreens and a grocery store in the area. There are at least four bars (The renown Farrell&#x27;s Bar &amp; Grill, the Double Windsor, Rhythm and Booze and the Adirondack) as well as a combination cafe and food store called The Tuscan Gun; a combination pub and restaurant called Hamilton&#x27;s; a French restaurant called Le Paddock; and a Middle Eastern restaurant called Batata. The commercial streets are also lined with new &quot;coffee shops, yoga studios and vegetarian restaurants&quot; that have popped up since the area&#x27;s gentrification.

==Police and crime==

==Fire safety==
The New York City Fire Department (FDNY) operates the Engine Company 240/Battalion 48 fire station at 1307 Prospect Avenue. The company supersedes a volunteer fire department created in 1888. Brooklyn Fire Department Engine 40 was created with that number on January 20, 1896, moving into a firehouse at 1307-1309 Prospect Avenue (which is now a city landmark). The company was incorporated into the FDNY as Engine Company 240 on January 1, 1913.

The firehouse was built in 1896 in the Romanesque Revival style. It is constructed of brick, limestone, and slate. It was named a New York City designated landmark in February 2013. Its lookout tower hails from a time where fire alarm systems were nonexistent.

== Post office and ZIP Codes ==
Windsor Terrace is covered by ZIP Codes 11215 and 11218, which respectively cover the northern and southern parts of the neighborhood. The United States Post Office operates the Prospect Park West Station post office at 225 Prospect Park West.

==Political representation==
Politically, Windsor Terrace is in New York&#x27;s 10th congressional district. It is in the New York State Senate&#x27;s 20th district, the New York State Assembly&#x27;s 44th district, and the New York City Council&#x27;s 38th and 39th districts. Windsor Terrace was once part of New York&#x27;s 9th congressional district, but following redistricting in 2022, the neighborhood became part of the 10th congressional district.

Windsor Terrace is a heavily Democratic area; in the 2016 Presidential election, 84% of the 9th Congressional district (where Windsor Terrace had been located from 2013 until 2022) voted for Hillary Clinton, compared to 15% for rival Donald Trump. In the 2016 Democratic presidential primary, Hillary Clinton narrowly won the primary in Windsor Terrace, receiving 2,756 votes () to Bernie Sanders&#x27;s 2,568 votes () with a total of 5,324 Democrats voting. Windsor Terrace had relatively few Republican primary voters. Just 371 voters cast ballots in the 2016 Republican primary, with 197 people ( of the Republican electorate in the neighborhood) voting for Donald Trump, 120 for John Kasich ( of the Republican electorate), and 54 for Ted Cruz ( of the Republican electorate).

==Education==
===Schools===
The neighborhood public elementary schools, PS 154 (The Windsor Terrace School) on 11th Avenue and PS 130 (The Parkside School) on Ocean Avenue, are well regarded. Each school features a number of enrichment programs for students, such as chess and journalism. In 2013–2014, 64% of PS 154 students met or exceeded Common Core standards in the English Language Arts (ELA) exams and 65% met or exceeded the standards on the math exams. At PS 130, 32% of ELA test-takers met or exceeded standards, and 41% did so on the math test. For the 2017–18 school year, PS 154 placed in the top 30% of all schools in New York for overall test scores (math proficiency is top 30%, and reading proficiency is top 20%). The percentage of students achieving proficiency in math was 77% (the New York state average was 52%) and the percentage of students achieving proficiency in reading/language arts was 82% (the New York state average was 52%). PS 130 placed in the top 50% of all schools in New York for overall test scores (math proficiency was top 50%, and reading proficiency was top 50%) for the 2017–18 school year. The percentage of students achieving proficiency in math was 62% and the percentage of students achieving proficiency in reading/language arts was 58%.

The NYCDOE district in which the schools are operated, District 15, was rezoned in 2014 due to an increased enrollment in the two schools; some students formerly zoned to PS 154 are now zoned to PS 130. This rezoning proved contentious, with some rezoned students&#x27; parents saying that the rezoning requires some students to travel over across &quot;two highways&quot; to get to school. In addition, since the rezoning, PS 154 has seen an increase in enrollment despite its decreased student catchment area; in 2016–2017, the school had its first-ever student waiting list, amid cuts to the school&#x27;s pre-kindergarten program. There is also another public school nearby, PS 295 on 18th Street in Park Slope, to accommodate extra students from Windsor Terrace. In the 2012–2013 NYCDOE Progress Report, this school received an &quot;A,&quot; garnering a quality score of 60.2 out of 100.

MS 839, serving grades 6–8, is located at 713 Caton Avenue. Brooklyn College Academy operates an annex site for freshmen and sophomore high school students at 350 Coney Island Avenue, with the juniors&#x27; and seniors&#x27; building at Brooklyn College.

The St. Joseph the Worker Catholic Academy opened in 2012. This Catholic school is a consolidation of Holy Name of Jesus and Immaculate Heart of Mary&#x27;s elementary schools into Holy Name&#x27;s existing infrastructure on 9th Avenue, offering Pre-K(3) to 8th Grade, including Honors Classes and after school programs. Another Catholic school, Bishop Ford High School, formerly operated at 500 19th Street in Windsor Terrace from 1952 to 2014. It closed in June 2014 due to lowered revenues from declining enrollment, with only 25% of its 2006 enrollment. The former school site is now the location of K280, a pre-kindergarten school, and MS 442 (School for Innovation).

===Library===
The Brooklyn Public Library&#x27;s Windsor Terrace branch is located at East 5th Street at Fort Hamilton Parkway. It began as a &quot;deposit station&quot; with a small collection in 1922, but after 1940, service was intermittent after the library moved to a makeshift structure created out of two old streetcars. In 1969, it moved again into the current library building, which had been completed that year. The library was renovated in 1994, and again in 2011. In 2016, a campaign was started in which people were to &quot;like&quot; the library&#x27;s Facebook page so that the library could get a garden; this was part of an initiative in which Facebook users from Brooklyn can vote on which Brooklyn Public Library branches could get $5,000 of extra funding for various programs. The library closed for a one-and-a-half-year renovation in February 2019.

==Transportation==

Windsor Terrace is served by the New York City Subway&#x27;s 15th Street–Prospect Park and Fort Hamilton Parkway stations on the IND Culver Line (now carrying the ). The section of the line containing these two stations opened on October 7, 1933, as part of a &quot;temporary&quot; extension to Church Avenue in Kensington, where it was to have connected with Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) subway services via a ramp to Ditmas Avenue. The former station, 15th Street, has stone entrances set into the park walls. The latter station, Fort Hamilton Parkway, has a long passageway due to its unusual location under the Prospect Expressway; its three entrances (one on Fort Hamilton Parkway itself, and two on Prospect Avenue) straddle the expressway, which splits the neighborhood in two.

MTA Regional Bus Operations operates bus routes in the area. , there are four local bus routes: the B61, B67, B68, and B69. Several express buses and the B103 Limited bus pass through Windsor Terrace without stopping.

As elsewhere in Brooklyn, trolley service, operated by the BMT&#x27;s rapid transit arm, ran in the neighborhood well into the 1950s and early &#x27;60s. The Seventh Avenue Line (now the B67 bus route) was converted from trolley to bus operations in 1951, and a year later, the Vanderbilt Avenue Line (now the B69) was similarly converted. A trolley barn, located between Green-Wood Cemetery and the Prospect Expressway, formerly served the Culver and Crosstown trolley lines on a site where a former federal prison was located during the American Civil War. It was replaced in 1962 by the Bishop Ford High School.

The Prospect Expressway, built between 1953 and 1960, runs through the middle of the neighborhood, with the majority of the neighborhood northeast of the expressway, and a small part of the neighborhood in the southwest connected by various bridges to the northeast section. Some neighborhood streets, such as Greenwood Avenue and Vanderbilt Place, were bisected by the expressway and remain so, while others, such as Seeley Street, 11th Avenue/Terrace Place, and Prospect Park W, are bridged over the highway. A plan to extend the highway along Ocean Parkway was never realized, though Ocean Parkway serves as a service road for the expressway for a short distance in southern Windsor Terrace. In the late 1950s, the Holy Name of Jesus Church led a failed effort to try to reroute the Prospect Expressway elsewhere or cancel the expressway altogether.

==Notable locations==
Kensington Stables is the only remaining stable near Prospect Park. In the days where horse stables saw a lot of business, there were many dozens of stables in the area. The barn was built in 1930 as the last extension of the riding academy at 11 Ocean Parkway, 57 Caton Place (built in 1917). The original riding academy closed in 1937 and is now a warehouse. By around the 1940s, the stables started to disappear, with some being converted into bowling alleys or roller skating rinks, and others just disappearing. Today, Kensington Stables gives lessons in The Shoe in Prospect Park. Kensington Stables now exists on the Windsor Terrace side of the border between Kensington and Windsor Terrace.

Bartel-Pritchard Square, in Windsor Terrace&#x27;s northern extremity, is a traffic circle at the intersection of Prospect Park West, 15th Street, and Prospect Park Southwest. Its name commemorates local residents, Emil Bartel and William Pritchard, who died during World War I while in combat. The circle, which was dedicated under its current name in 1922, originally had a flower garden in its center. A black granite monument in the center of the circle—installed in 1965 as a result of a donation by the Patrick J. Devaney Post #964, VFW of the U.S.—memorializes all of the locals who have died in war. One side has the inscription &quot;In memory of the men / of this community who / have given their lives / In wartime service/ to their country / Erected by / Patrick J. Devaney Post #964 / V.F.W. of U.S. / 1965&quot; while the other side has the inscription &quot;For Valor / and / Sacrifice / 1965&quot;. Like similar structures such as Times Square and Herald Square, the Bartel-Pritchard Square is geometrically not a square, despite its name. The park entrance adjoining Bartel–Pritchard Square is shaped as a gateway between two Stanford White-designed granite pillars with &quot;what appears to be huge bronze lanterns&quot; adorning the pillars&#x27; apexes. The pillars, which are based on an acanthus column in Delphi with sculptures on top, were unveiled in 1906, shortly after White had died.

Since at least 1908, Windsor Terrace has had its own movie theater since the Marathon Theatre opened at present-day 188 Prospect Park W in 1908. The 500-seat Marathon Theatre had a Wurlitzer organ installed in 1927, shortly before its 1928 demolition. In August of that year, the 1,516-seat, Art Deco Sanders Theatre was opened on the site of the former Marathon Theatre, where it operated for half a century before its closure in 1976. The building stood vacant for twenty years after that, and investors bought the building in 1993 in hopes of reopening the theater. The Pavilion Theatre, a 3-screen movie theater within the defunct Sanders Theatre building, opened in 1996 to positive reception from the surrounding communities, which had experienced a cultural decline in prior years. The theater, which expanded to 9 screens in October 2004, suffered from complaints about broken toilets, poorly maintained seats, and sticky floors, as well as a rumor of bedbug-infested upholstery and malfunctions in the theater&#x27;s heating system. In October 2016, the building was closed in preparation for conversion to a 7-screen, 650-seat theater. Operated by Nitehawk Cinema, the refurbished Pavilion Theatre, where patrons would be able to dine and watch movies simultaneously, was Nitehawk&#x27;s second movie theater within Brooklyn. The renovated theater ultimately reopened on December 19, 2018.

Farrell&#x27;s Bar &amp; Grill, at 16th Street and Prospect Park W, is a noted community institution that has been continuously run by three owners since 1933. Famous among the fire and police officers who live in the community, it is said to be one of the first bars in New York City to get its liquor license at the end of Prohibition. It has been used as a standard bar backdrop in many film sequences. The neighborhood legend persists that until 1971, when Shirley MacLaine and Pete Hamill went into the bar during the filming of &quot;Desperate Characters&quot; and successfully demanded that MacLaine be served from the bar; until that time, Farrell&#x27;s only served men at the bar and women at the rear of the establishment. Farrell&#x27;s, which known for being open every day from 10 a.m. to 3 a.m., was closed for a nine-day renovation in 2006, marking the bar&#x27;s longest duration of closure since Prohibition ended. Its iconic styrofoam cups filled with beer, a tradition since its cardboard &quot;containers&quot; were replaced by Styrofoam &quot;containers&quot; in 1985, were discontinued in 2015 following a citywide ban on Styrofoam food implements.

Due to Windsor Terrace&#x27;s topography, there is a terminal moraine that ends in Windsor Terrace, creating a steep slope. As a result, at the location where the intersection of Seeley Street and Prospect Avenue would have been; Seeley Street uses a concrete arch bridge that spans above Prospect Avenue. The bridge was built by 1903 at a cost of $22,000, and is supported by underpinning since the IND subway runs under Prospect Avenue at this point. While street bridges that span other streets are more common in the hilly Bronx, they are rare in Brooklyn. This particular bridge does not appear on contemporary maps. The bridge has a stairway on its side that connects the two streets.

<doc id="907017" wikidata="Q1504809" url="?curid=907017" title="List of GE locomotives">
<text>The following is a list of locomotives produced by GE Transportation Systems, a subsidiary of Wabtec. All were/are built at Fort Worth, Texas or Erie, Pennsylvania, in the United States. Most (except the electrics, the switchers, the AC6000CW, and the Evolution series) are powered by various versions of GE&#x27;s own FDL diesel prime mover, based on a Cooper Bessemer design and manufactured at Grove City, Pennsylvania. GE is one of the largest locomotive manufacturing companies. This list includes locomotives built solely for export outside of North America.

==Freight locomotives==

===Early locomotives, switchers and special purpose===

====Switchers====
====General purpose====
===Universal Series (1956 to 1998)===
====Four axle====
====Six axle====
====Six axle &amp; Pony====
====Eight axle====
===Dash 7 Series (introduced 1977)===

Models with &quot;A&quot; suffix are equipped with 12-cylinder prime mover in place of the standard 16-cylinder version, with the same power output.

====Four axle====
====Six axle====
===Dash 8 Series (introduced 1982)===

GE originally introduced this series with the model designation following the pattern of the Dash-7 line. After product improvements were made to the line in 1987 the official designations for models in this series changed to &quot;Dash-8...&quot;, as shown in the list below. However, for simplicity, many railroads decided to use designations which follow the pattern of the Dash-7 line. Thus, for example, the Dash 8-40C is usually rendered as &quot;C40-8&quot;. The &quot;W&quot; suffix indicates the then-optional wide-nose &quot;North American&quot; safety cab. For example, the Santa Fe used the designation &quot;B40-8W&quot; for GE&#x27;s &quot;Dash 8-40BW&quot;. The railroad continued this practice until its merger with the Burlington Northern Railroad in 1995, and the new railroad, Burlington Northern-Santa Fe (later BNSF Railway) furthered the practice.

Introduced during the Dash 8&#x27;s later years were split-cooling in the radiators and electronic displays for the crews (instead of analogue gauges).

====Four axle====
====Six axle====
====Eight axle====
===Dash 9 Series (introduced 1993)===

The Dash 9 series introduced primarily electronics updates to the Dash 8 line. Also introduced was the HiAd (High-Adhesion) truck. Split-cooling was standard.

====Four axle====
No four axle freight versions produced

====Six axle====
====Eight axle====
===AC Series (introduced 1994)===
These feature the same carbody design and many of the internal components as the Dash-9 series, except they are equipped with AC traction motors instead of the conventional DC versions. The cab air conditioner was moved from the left (conductor&#x27;s) side walkway to a position under the cab floor to make space for the six traction inverters (one per axle) that supply the AC current to the traction motors.

====Six axle====
:*Note: two versions: one contained a 16-cylinder 7HDL, co-developed by GE and the German firm Deutz-MWM, rated at 6000 HP; the other a 16-cylinder 7FDL rated at 4390 HP. The units equipped with the 7FDL were a sub-version AC6000 &quot;Convertible&quot; and were produced to get the type into operation while the 7HDL was developed.

:**Note 1: The &quot;AC44i&quot; is a export version of the AC4400CW locomotive for Brazil. In that country, these models are the first to use AC (Alternating Current) in their operating systems. The first units were made in United States on 2008, and the other sequential units made in the local plant of GE, in Contagem municipality, Minas Gerais.

=== Evolution Series (introduced 2005) ===

The Evolution Series locomotives replaced the Dash 9 and AC series in North America and exceeded the then new U.S. EPA Tier II emissions standards that took effect in 2005, reducing nitrogen oxides emissions by over 40% and improving fuel consumption as well. They use the new GEVO engine (based in part on the 7HDL design) which produces the same power from twelve cylinders as previous locomotives&#x27; 16-cylinder 7FDL engine. Both AC and DC Evolution Series share the same carbody design. The radiator section &quot;wings&quot; are divided into two parts with differing angles.

==== Six axle ====
==== Eight axle ====
:*Note: GE Brazil has an order for 46 units of this model for Rumo Logística, which will be delivered during the year 2017. Is the most powerful narrow gauge locomotive in the world.

=== FLXDrive ===

The FLXDrive Series of locomotives are GE&#x27;s first battery-electric locomotives, using a similar design to the Evolution Series, with the exception of a diesel prime mover. The FLXDrive series was introduced in late 2019 with one BEL44C4D demonstrator unit, but other FLXDrive variants are planned for the future.

==== Six axle ====

=== PowerHaul Series ===
==== Six axle ====
==Passenger locomotives==

While primarily a builder of freight locomotives, GE has on occasion been called upon to construct passenger models for specific customers. The most recent is the P42DC, ordered by Amtrak to replace the aging EMD F40PH. Additional units have been built for Via Rail Canada.
==Electric locomotives==
==Turbine locomotives==
== Indonesian locomotives ==
Locomotives exported to Indonesia are quite different from other locomotives produced by GE. They use the same type of engine across all models (GE 7FDL-8, except for UM 106T Locomotives which used Alco 12-244E).
Despite using the same type of engine, the power capabilities from type to type are different as some models are equipped with dual turbocharger, or equipped with common rail system and dual turbocharger.

<text>Actinomyces naeslundii is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium found in the mouth of humans. The species has been implicated in periodontal disease, as well as various tooth cavities. In other cases, &quot;A. naeslundii&quot; is associated with good oral health. It is one of the first bacteria to occupy the oral cavity and colonize the tooth&#x27;s surface. It has also been isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis.

== Description ==
&quot;A. naeslundii&quot; appears Gram-positive and pleomorphic by microscopy. It does not form spores, and is considered anaerobic or microaerophilic.

In 2009, the species &quot;A. naeslundi&quot; was split. Bacteria formerly known as &quot;&quot;Actinomyces naeslundi&quot; genospecies 2&quot; were reclassified under the new species name &quot;Actinomyces oris&quot;. Those formerly known as &quot;&quot;Actinomyces naeslundi&quot; genospecies WVA 963&quot; were reclassified as &quot;Actinomyces johnsonii&quot;.

== Role in disease ==
Many species of the genus &quot;Actinomyces&quot;, including &quot;A. naeslundii&quot;, cause a chronic disease called actinomycosis, which is characterized by swelling and formation of an abscess which may exude pus. This can be accompanied by tissue fibrosis.

Infections of the mouth, face, and neck are the most commonly recognized infections; however, the thoracic region, abdomen, pelvis, and the central nervous system can also be involved.

<text>Carbon-12 (12C) is the most abundant of the two stable isotopes of carbon (carbon-13 being the other), amounting to 98.93% of element carbon on Earth; its abundance is due to the triple-alpha process by which it is created in stars. Carbon-12 is of particular importance in its use as the standard from which atomic masses of all nuclides are measured, thus, its atomic mass is exactly 12 daltons by definition. Carbon-12 is composed of 6 protons, 6 neutrons, and 6 electrons.

== History ==

Before 1959, both the IUPAP and IUPAC used oxygen to define the mole; the chemists defining the mole as the number of atoms of oxygen which had mass 16 g, the physicists using a similar definition but with the oxygen-16 isotope only. The two organizations agreed in 1959–60 to define the mole as follows.

&quot;Mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 12 gram of carbon 12; its symbol is &quot;mol&quot;.&quot;

This was adopted by the CIPM (International Committee for Weights and Measures) in 1967, and in 1971, it was adopted by the 14th CGPM (General Conference on Weights and Measures).

In 1961, the isotope carbon-12 was selected to replace oxygen as the standard relative to which the atomic weights of all the other elements are measured.

In 1980, the CIPM clarified the above definition, defining that the carbon-12 atoms are unbound and in their ground state.

In 2018, IUPAC specified the mole as exactly &quot;elementary entities&quot;. The number of moles in 12 grams of carbon-12 became a matter of experimental determination.

== Hoyle state ==

The Hoyle state is an excited, spinless, resonant state of carbon-12. It is produced via the triple-alpha process and was predicted to exist by Fred Hoyle in 1954. The existence of the 7.7 MeV resonance Hoyle state is essential for the nucleosynthesis of carbon in helium-burning stars and predicts an amount of carbon production in a stellar environment which matches observations. The existence of the Hoyle state has been confirmed experimentally, but its precise properties are still being investigated.

The Hoyle state is populated when a helium-4 nucleus fuses with a beryllium-8 nucleus in a high-temperature (108 K) environment with densely concentrated (105 g/cm3) helium. This process must occur within 10−16 seconds as a consequence of the short half-life of 8Be. The Hoyle state also is a short-lived resonance with a half-life of ; it primarily decays back into its three constituent alpha particles, though 0.0413% of decays (or 1 in 2421.3) occur by internal conversion into the ground state of 12C.

In 2011, an ab initio calculation of the low-lying states of carbon-12 found (in addition to the ground and excited spin-2 state) a resonance with all of the properties of the Hoyle state.

== Isotopic purification ==

The isotopes of carbon can be separated in the form of carbon dioxide gas by cascaded chemical exchange reactions with amine carbamate.

<text>The Royal Marine Brigade and subsequent Royal Marine Division were amphibious warfare formations created by the British Royal Marines at the start of the Second World War.

The composition of both formations was almost constantly in flux, with neither ever achieving their full establishment. Though neither saw action, they both played important roles in the development of amphibious warfare techniques and their constituent units went on to play important roles in the largest amphibious operation in history, Operation Neptune.

== Recruitment and Training ==
As regular entry for a minimum of 12 years service as a professional Marine was continued throughout the war, and the Admiralty decided that only regulars and regular reservists could serve at sea, Hostilities Only conscripts found themselves almost exclusively manning the new land based Royal Marine units, including the Royal Marine Brigade and Division. Notwithstanding that these men were conscripts, most had expressed a preference for service in the Royal Marines on selection, sometimes as a second choice to serving in more highly qualified roles in the Royal Navy.

A new training camp, the Royal Marine Special Reserve Depot, Exton, was commissioned for basic training of these Special Reservists but was not ready to receive recruits till 22 February 1940. Basic training included kitting up, lectures, physical training, drill, basic small arms handling and the administration of many injections. Infantry skills were taught on posting to battalions, until the dedicated Royal Marine Infantry Training Centre (ITC) was opened at the neighbouring Dalditch Camp from 1 May 1941. This training included an assault course, advanced weapon training, range work and night firing. The final stage of the 17 week training course involved field-craft including cooking and survival, the last week of this being under canvas near the village of Ottery St Mary. On 5 September 1941 the Exton Camp was renamed the Royal Marine Depot, Lympstone.

== The Royal Marine Brigade ==
The Admiralty appointed Madden Committee of 1924 proposed that a brigade of 3,000 Marines should be based ashore to &quot;provide a striking force ... immediately available for use under the direction of the Naval Commander-in-Chief for amphibious operations, such as raids on the enemy coastline and bases ...&quot; Peace-time finances had prevented the formation of such a force, but in September 1939 it was decided to raise a brigade of three light infantry battalions with around 2,000 men to fulfill this role. At that time the expectation was that the 1st Royal Marine Brigade would be deployed in the Mediterranean Theatre should Italy enter the war.

By January it had been decided to expand the brigade to four battalions, but the first recruits did not reach them from the Royal Marine Special Reserve Depot until April 1940. By May 1940 it had already been decided to reform the outfit as two brigades, named the 101st RM Brigade and 102nd RM Brigade to avoid confusion with the 1st &amp; 2nd Army Brigades then on service with the BEF. The 2nd &amp; 3rd RM Battalions were to form the 102nd Brigade, whilst the 1st RM Battalion was to be joined by the new 5th RM Battalion to form the 101st RM Brigade (the 4th RM Battalion having been permanently disbanded as a mark of honour for their sacrifice at Zeebruge in 1918).

Each brigade raised a medium machine gun company, a mobile (reconnaissance) company carrying anti-tank rifles in motorcycle side-car combinations, and a light howitzer battery of 6 mountain guns as support troops. All of this materiel was capable of being man-handled, thus avoiding the delay of hoisting heavier equipment into MLCs and thus losing the element of surprise. Nevertheless, discussions were held with the ISTDC to improve vehicle landing times.

=== Royal Marine Brigade Operations ===
Forces from the Royal Marine Brigade including 2nd RM Battalion formed the core of Force Sturges for the occupation of Iceland in May 1940. By June that force had been relieved and in the wake of the Dunkirk evacuation, and the RM Brigade was placed on standby in Pembrokeshire to counter any threat of German occupation of neutral Ireland. By July the concern shifted to a potential German occupation of the neutral Portuguese islands of the Azores and Cape Verdes, with the RM Brigade relocating around Plymouth as a departure port, and undertaking coastal defence duties while they waited. The brigade had not expected to complete training until the end of July, so all of these tasks were accomplished whilst under-strength.

== The Royal Marine Division ==
In August 1940 the decision was made to group the Royal Marine Brigades under a full Royal Marine Division. A key element of this plan was the raising of a third brigade, the 103rd RM Brigade consisting of the 7th &amp; 8th RM Battalions (the 6th RM Battalion having been permanently disbanded as a mark of disgrace following the mutiny in Murmansk in 1919). However, the deteriorating situation in the Eastern Mediterranean resulted in the 103rd RM Brigade functioning as a holding unit for recruits for the RM Mobile Naval Base Defence Organisation in Alexandria, with both the 7th &amp; 8th RM Battalions eventually being transferred to that Theatre.

The battalion machine gun companies and brigade mobile companies were gathered together as the 15th RM Machine Gun and 18th RM Mobile (Reconnaissance) Battalions respectively in December 1940, but the divisional HQ was not formed until February 1941 under Major-General Robert Sturges. Under his direction the Division reformed back into two functional brigade groups, with the 101st &amp; 102nd RM Brigades both forming their own brigade artillery regiments, each with the addition of an anti-tank and anti-aircraft battery to their existing light howitzer batteries. In May 1941 the 103rd RM Brigade was officially re-designated a training brigade with responsibility for the 15th &amp; 18th support battalions, and the newly raised 9th &amp; 10th RM Battalions.

In July 1942 the Division underwent its final re-organisation. The 103rd RM Brigade was disbanded and replaced by the 104th RM (Training) Brigade, with the 9th &amp; 10th RM Battalions being re-assigned to the 101st &amp; 102nd Brigades respectively to form a division of two brigades of three battalions each. At the same time Divisional Artillery HQ was raised, absorbing the former brigade artillery regiments to form a Field Regiment, Anti-Tank Regiment and Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment. The machine gun and reconnaissance support battalions were to have been supplemented by an engineer battalion, but this never exceeded Field Company strength.

=== Royal Marine Division Operations ===
In August 1940 the RM Division, though still only at the strength of 2 light brigades, undertook formal embarkation, on-ship, and debarkation exercises on transports before departing for Freetown, Sierra Leone for Operation Manacle:

* 101st RM Brigade
** 1st RM Battalion from the Clyde on the SS Ettrick
** 5th RM Battalion on the SS Karanja
* 102nd RM Brigade
** 2nd RM Battalion on the SS Kenya
** 3rd RM Battalion on the MS Sobieski (though A Company were on the Ettrick)

Though deployed off Dakar, the Free French coup failed and the RM Division troops returned to Freetown.

101st Brigade were withdrawn back to the Clyde in October 1940, but 102nd Brigade remained on standby in Freetown, not rejoining the 101st in West Scotland until February 1941. By this time the Commandos had become established under Combined Operations HQ as the British amphibious raiding force, and operational opportunities for the RM Division proved elusive. Despite extensive training in beach assault landings, proposals for use of the RM Division in the Lofoten Islands Raid in December 1941 were rebuffed in favour of the Commandos.

The temporary attachment of the 8th Argylls over the winter of 1940-1 enabled the RM Division to develop new techniques in landing heavy weapons and training regular army troops in amphibious operations, and this was extended under Major-General Sturges by the attachment of the 29th Independent Infantry Brigade in May 1941. This expanded Division was originally assembled to provide a force to invade the Canary Isles, should Spain enter the war on the side of the Axis powers, and was then held on standby by General Harold Alexander for a range of potential amphibious operations. The last of these was Operation Ironclad, with Major-General Sturges taking part of the RM Division HQ to head up Force 121 for the amphibious assault on Diego-Suarez in may 1942. However, despite supporting representations from Admiral Mountbatten who was then Chief of Combined Operations, the War Office considered the light infantry units of the Royal Marine Division to be unsuitable for the task. The Admiralty refused to approve the RM Division being brought up to a standard establishment, and so their place was taken by two brigades of 5th Division.

The two Brigade Groups of the RM Division were offered to General Eisenhower for Operation Torch in the autumn of 1942, but the offer was rejected with the role being taken instead by two brigades of the 78th Division that had been formed in May 1942 specifically for that purpose. It was in response to this rejection that the division started to develop its own divisional artillery capability in 1943. The division was attached to Naval Force J (the retained Combined Operations landing flotillas from Operation Jubilee) for training on the south coast of England over the first half of that year.

== Dissolution of the Royal Marine Division ==
Vice-Admiral Louis Mountbatten, Chief of Combined Operations, having &quot;made friends with the division in Wales&quot; lobbied hard for its deployment in its intended role, as an amphibious assault force. However, this had been repeatedly blocked by the Army on the basis that it lacked the heavy weapons and logistical support needed to maintain itself in the field after an initial assault. In General Eisenhower&#x27;s terms, the RM Division &quot;hadn&#x27;t got a tail&quot;.

General Alan Bourne, the Adjutant General of the Royal Marines from October 1939 to January 1943, had personally resisted suggestions from the War Office that the RM Division should be made up to a standard divisional establishment. He was concerned that if equipped as any other division it would lose its intended purpose, be removed from the Admiralty and deployed by the Army, as had been his personal experience when serving as a Major with the Royal Naval Division in the Great War. But agreements secured from the War Office to provide those supporting elements on attachment were never realised in practice.

The impasse was broken by Mountbatten, who engineered the dissolution of the division and the redeployment of its constituent units to Combined Operations as one of his last acts as Chief of Combined Operations. The RM Division was disbanded in August 1943:

* RM Division HQ became Special Service Group HQ
** 101st RM Brigade HQ became 4th Special Service Brigade HQ
*** 1st RM Battalion became No. 42 RM Commando
*** 5th RM Battalion became No. 45 RM Commando
*** 9th RM Battalion became No. 46 RM Commando
** 102nd RM Brigade became 3rd Special Service Brigade HQ
*** 2nd RM Battalion became No. 43 RM Commando
*** 3rd RM Battalion became No. 44 RM Commando
*** 10th RM Battalion became No. 47 RM Commando
** RM Divisional Artillery
*** RM Field Artillery Regiment became Royal Marine Armoured Support Group
*** RM Light Anti-Aircraft Regiment became Landing Craft Flack gun crews
** RM Support Battalions
*** RM Engineer Field Company became six RM Landing Craft Obstacle Clearance Units and two Special Service Brigade Engineer Troops.
Other units, including the 30% of the personnel of the RM Battalions who didn&#x27;t pass the Commando training course at Achnacarry, were deployed as crews for minor land craft flotillas (LCAs, LCMs &amp; LCP(L)s).

<doc id="907034" wikidata="Q743570" url="?curid=907034" title="Alboran Island">
<text>Alboran Island () is a small islet of Spain (province of Almería) in the Alboran Sea, part of the western Mediterranean Sea, about north of the Moroccan coast and from the Spanish mainland. The main buildings are an automated lighthouse built in the 19th century, a small cemetery, and a harbour.

==Description==
The island is a flat platform about above sea level and about in area. off the northeastern end of the island is the small &quot;islote de La Nube&quot; (literally, islet of the cloud).

==Natural history==
Alboran has a volcanic origin, located in an important seismic zone where the African plate collides with the Eurasian plate. In 1899, a new igneous rock was discovered on Alboran, with the name of alboranite, in honor of the island.

The islet has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports a breeding population of Audouin&#x27;s gulls as well as various species of passerines on migration.

The wall-rocket species &quot;Diplotaxis siettiana&quot;, known in Spanish as &quot;jaramago de Alborán&quot; (&quot;Alborán dandelion&quot;), has its only known wild population on the island. It was declared extinct in the wild in 1974, but was successfully reintroduced from ex-situ conservation stocks in 1999. The plant remains critically endangered, and only grows around the island&#x27;s helipad.

In 2001, the United Nations declared the island and its seabed a Specially Protected Area of Mediterranean Importance.

==History==
The island became a power base of Mustafa ben Yusuf al Mahmud ed Din (), a Tunisian corsair in the Ottoman sultan&#x27;s service whose attacks were so ferocious that he became known as &quot;Al-Borani&quot; (hence the island&#x27;s name), from the Turkish for &quot;thunderstorm&quot;. It became a Spanish possession after the Battle of Alboran in 1540.

Alborán has been known in error as &quot;Albusama&quot;.

The aristocrat Archduke Ludwig Salvator of Austria visited the island and published in 1899 an illustrated book in German about the island.

In 1963, the Spanish army established a permanent detachment of Spanish Navy Marines for the control and protection of the island.

== Administration ==
The island has belonged to Spain since 1540, and to the municipality of Almería since the 19th century.

<doc id="907036" wikidata="Q2011497" url="?curid=907036" title="Wilmslow">
<text>Wilmslow ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the borough of Cheshire East in Cheshire, England. It is south of Manchester. At the 2021 census the parish had a population of 26,213 and the built up area had a population of 25,725.

==History==
===Toponymy===
Wilmslow derives its name from Old English &quot;Wīghelmes hlāw&quot;, meaning &quot;mound of a man called Wīghelm.&quot;

===Lindow Man===
Much about the local Iron Age history of Wilmslow was uncovered with the discovery of Lindow Man, in Lindow Moss. Preserved in the peat bogs for 2,000 years, Lindow Man is one of the most important Iron Age finds in the country. Despite a campaign to keep Lindow Man in the area, he was transferred to the British Museum and is a central feature of the Iron Age exhibition. Lindow Man returned to Manchester Museum in April 2008 for a year-long exhibition.

===Recent history===
An IRA bomb exploded near the railway station in March 1997, damaging signalling equipment. The original IRA message was confusing and led to the evacuation of the Wilmslow Police Station to the local leisure centre not far from the explosion. Nobody was hurt.

In the general election of the same year, the parliamentary constituency of Tatton, in which Wilmslow falls, made headlines as part of the &quot;sleaze&quot; accusations levelled against the then Conservative Government. Tatton MP, Neil Hamilton, was accused of accepting cash for tabling Parliamentary questions, and subsequently defeated in the election by independent candidate Martin Bell. Bell was supported in his door to door canvassing for votes by David Soul and served a single term as MP.

==Governance==

There are two tiers of local government covering Wilmslow, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Wilmslow Town Council and Cheshire East Council. The town council is based at the Parish Hall on Cliff Road.

===Administrative history===
Wilmslow was an ancient parish in the Macclesfield Hundred of Cheshire. The parish was subdivided into four townships, called Bollin Fee, Chorley, Fulshaw, and Pownall Fee. The town centre and the parish church of St Bartholomew&#x27;s lay in the Bollin Fee township. From the 17th century onwards, parishes were gradually given various civil functions under the poor laws, in addition to their original ecclesiastical functions. In some cases, including Wilmslow, the civil functions were exercised by each township separately rather than the parish as a whole. In 1866, the legal definition of &#x27;parish&#x27; was changed to be the areas used for administering the poor laws, and so the townships each became separate civil parishes, which therefore diverged from the ecclesiastical parish.

In 1862, a Chorley local government district was created, governed by an elected local board. The district covered the eastern part of the Chorley township, plus small adjoining parts of the Bollin Fee and Fulshaw townships. The Chorley district was renamed Alderley Edge in 1894.

In 1878, a separate Wilmslow local government district was created covering the remainder of Bollin Fee and Fulshaw, plus Pownall Fee apart from the area north of the River Bollin and River Dean; the excluded area north of the rivers contained the hamlet of Styal. Local government districts were reconstituted as urban districts under the Local Government Act 1894. Also in 1894, the civil parishes within the Wilmslow district were united into a single parish of Wilmslow, and Styal was made a separate parish.

On 1 April 1936, the urban district of Wilmslow was enlarged to take in Handforth and Styal. Wilmslow Urban District Council was granted a coat of arms on 21 June 1951.

Wilmslow Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. As part of those reforms, the area had been considered for possible inclusion within Greater Manchester, but it was ultimately decided to place it in the borough of Macclesfield. No successor parish was created for the former urban district, and so it became unparished, being directly administered by Macclesfield Borough Council. In 2009, Cheshire East Council was created, taking over the functions of the borough council and Cheshire County Council, which were both abolished.

In 2011, the area of the former Wilmslow Urban District was split into three new parishes called Wilmslow, Handforth, and Styal.

==Demography==
===Population and ethnicity===
According to the 2001 United Kingdom census, the wards of Wilmslow North and Wilmslow South have a combined population of 25,498, of which 13,400 (52.5%) are females and 12,098 (47.5%) are males. In addition, 5,197 (20.4%) are aged 16 and under while 4,780 (18.8%) are aged 65 and over.

Ethnic white groups (British, Irish, other) account for 95.9% of the population, with ethnic minority groups accounting for 4.1% of the population.

==Religion==
A breakdown of religious groups and denominations:
* Christian – 76.7% (19,567 people)
* Muslim – 1.4% (363 people)
* Jewish – 0.7% (182 people)
* Hindu – 0.7% (168 people)
* Buddhist – 0.4% (94 people)
* Sikh – 0.2% (39 people)
* Any Other Religion – 0.2% (58 people)
* No Religion – 13.3% (3,390 people)
* Religion Not Stated – 6.1% (1,555 people)

===Places of worship===
There are three Church of England churches in Wilmslow, St Bartholomew&#x27;s, St Anne&#x27;s and St John&#x27;s. St Bartholomew&#x27;s is a 16th-century building, which was modified in the 19th century. It has a turreted bell tower. The first rector of the church was a Thomas Dale, who is buried beneath a headstone presumably engraved by him outside the entrance to the church.

Wilmslow Methodist Church occupies a modern building close to the town centre, replacing an 1886 building which itself replaced the original 1798 church, built seven years after John Wesley&#x27;s death.

The Sacred Heart &amp; St Teresa&#x27;s Church is the Roman Catholic church and dates from the late 19th century.

Dean Row Chapel, east of the town centre, is a Grade II* listed building built around the end of the 17th century. Initially Presbyterian, it is now a Unitarian chapel.

There is also a United Reformed Church in Wilmslow close to the town centre.

==Geography==
Situated in the North of England, 11 miles (18 km) from Manchester city centre and 7 miles (11 km) from Macclesfield, Wilmslow town centre is focused upon Bank Square, Grove Street and Water Lane. Although Bank Square has traditionally provided the location for many of the town&#x27;s banks, the name in fact originates from the bank, or slope, leading down to the Carrs and up towards the railway station. The River Bollin flows through The Carrs Park and once provided the power source for nearby Quarry Bank Mill, now a National Trust site, and enjoyment for the local population.

Before the railway came in 1842, Wilmslow comprised only a few farms and a church.

For purposes of the Office for National Statistics, Wilmslow forms part of the Greater Manchester Urban Area.

==Economy==
The town is part of the Golden Triangle together with Alderley Edge and Prestbury. It grew in popularity in the Victorian era as a desirable area for wealthy North West (most generally Manchester) merchants to move out to once the railways arrived and connected the towns.

Wilmslow is the founding location of sports equipment manufacturer Umbro which has its headquarters in the area.

The town is a key location for Royal London, the mutual financial services company. The Information Commissioner&#x27;s Office, one of the government&#x27;s executive agencies, is also based in Wilmslow.

The UK headquarters of Waters Corporation, an American manufacturer of analytical laboratory instruments, is located on Altrincham Road in Wilmslow, at the site of Huntingdon Life Sciences&#x27; Stamford Lodge facility, which was demolished in 2012.

Wilmslow and its close surroundings are served by several car showrooms of notable marques. These include Aston Martin, Porsche, Ferrari, Jaguar, Maserati, Land Rover, Bentley, McLaren, Rolls-Royce and Lamborghini. The town&#x27;s Aston Martin dealership sells the highest number of Aston Martins in the UK; a high demand stimulated largely by the high level of affluence in the town.

==Recreation and sport==
The town has a number of parks including The Carrs Park.

Wilmslow held its first Scarecrow Festival in July 2010 with 85 local businesses taking part and 93 different scarecrows. The week-long festival is organised by the Rotary Club of Wilmslow Dean and the members of the Wilmslow Business Group.

The Wilmslow Festive 10k, organised by Run North West, takes place at the end of November each year. The run starts in Wilmslow town centre with 2479 finishers in 2017. The Wilmslow Half Marathon is an annual half marathon road running race, established in 1984 and usually run in March.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Manchester on 95.1 FM, Heart North West on 105.4 FM, Smooth North West on 100.4 FM, Capital Manchester and Lancashire on 102.0 FM, Greatest Hits Radio Manchester &amp; The North West on 96.2 FM, Silk Radio on 106.9 FM and Canalside Radio, a community based station which broadcast on 102.8 FM. 

The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;The Wilmslow Express&quot; and &quot;Knutsford Guardian&quot;. 

==Transport==
===Railway===
Wilmslow railway station is situated on the Crewe to Manchester spur of the West Coast Main Line, via Stockport. The station is also a junction for the Styal Line which takes a different route to Manchester Piccadilly, via Styal, Manchester Airport and Heald Green, but avoiding Stockport.

The station is served by three train operating companies:
* An hourly service between Manchester Piccadilly and London Euston, via Crewe, operated by Avanti West Coast.
* There are regular local services to Manchester, Stockport, Manchester Airport, Alderley Edge and Crewe; these are operated by Northern Trains.
* There is an hourly service, operated by Transport for Wales, to Crewe, Shrewsbury and Cardiff; some services continue on to Swansea, Carmarthen and Milford Haven.

===Buses===
Wilmslow&#x27;s main bus interchange is at Bank Square; it is served by three regular bus routes, operated by D&amp;G Bus:

* 88 Altrincham – Macclesfield service (Monday – Saturday, hourly) 
* 130 Manchester Airport – Macclesfield (Monday – Saturday, hourly)
* 312 Wilmslow - Handforth Dean (Monday – Saturday, hourly)

There is also a free bus service, between Knutsford and Handforth Dean retail park, which operates on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.

There are no longer any direct bus services to Stockport or Manchester, as Wilmslow lies outside of Greater Manchester where Stagecoach Manchester now focus their operations; there are also no Sunday or Bank Holiday bus services.

===Roads===
The A34 road, which links Salford and Winchester, by-passes the town centre to the east; this was later extended around neighbouring Alderley Edge. It joins the A555 at Handforth Dean, which has been extended to Manchester Airport.

Manchester Airport lies just four miles (6 km) along the A538 to the north-west, but Wilmslow lies away from the approach and departure routes and therefore does not suffer from aircraft noise as Hale Barns and Heald Green do.

<text>Barbara Gaskin (born 5 June 1950) is an English singer formerly associated with the UK Canterbury scene.

Gaskin was lead vocalist in British folk-prog band Spirogyra (1969–1974). From 1973 to 1976, she sang backing vocals with Dave Stewart&#x27;s band Hatfield and the North, as one-third of the Northettes (with Ann Rosenthal and Amanda Parsons, both since retired from music). In 1981, she and Stewart formed a duo, and later in October of that year, they had a number one single in the UK with a cover of the Lesley Gore song &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot;. Subsequent singles &quot;Busy Doing Nothing&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Locomotion&quot; (1986) also entered the UK Singles Chart, without reaching the heights of their debut release. Seven albums followed, released on the duo&#x27;s own Broken Records label. Gaskin and Stewart continue to work together and occasionally play live concerts with Andy Reynolds (guitar, 1990–2009), Beren Matthews (guitar, 2018 onwards) and drummer Gavin Harrison (Tokyo 2001 and London 2018 concerts). Gaskin has also sung with Egg (&quot;The Civil Surface&quot;), National Health, Peter Blegvad (&quot;The Naked Shakespeare&quot;), Phil Miller, Nigel Planer (&quot;Neil&#x27;s Heavy Concept Album&quot;), Jane Wiedlin (&quot;Tangled&quot;), Rick Biddulph and Mont Campbell (&quot;Music from a Round Tower&quot;).

==History==
Barbara Gaskin was born and grew up in Hatfield, Hertfordshire, England. She had formal training in piano and cello from the age of 10. In her early teens she taught herself very basic acoustic guitar (Lesson 1: The strings face outwards) and performed in local folk clubs.

In 1969, she moved from Hatfield to Canterbury to study for a degree in Philosophy and Literature at University of Kent at Canterbury, but immediately became involved in the Canterbury music scene, joining folk rock group Spirogyra as vocalist. Spirogyra quickly procured a recording contract and subsequently made 3 albums, namely:- &#x27;St Radigunds&#x27; B &amp; C Records (CAS 1042), &#x27;Old Boot Wine&#x27; Pegasus Records (PEG 13), and &#x27;Bells, Boots, &amp; Shambles&#x27; Polydor (2310 246), while gigging extensively on the UK college circuit, as well as completing numerous successful tours of Europe. During the same period, Gaskin met guitarist Steve Hillage (also a student at Kent University) and via Hillage, the members of Canterbury band Caravan, and Hillage&#x27;s old friend and musical colleague Dave Stewart. Gaskin guested both live and on record with Stewart&#x27;s band &#x27;Hatfield &amp; The North&#x27;, and was a member of the &#x27;Ottawa Music Company&#x27;, brainchild of Dave Stewart and &#x27;Henry Cow&#x27; drummer Chris Cutler. The intricate, largely instrumental music of bands such as Egg, Hatfield &amp; The North and Henry Cow, and by contrast, the more spontaneous, lyrically driven approach of Spirogyra, were both powerful formative musical influences on Gaskin during the six years she lived in Canterbury.

When Spirogyra split up, Gaskin left England to travel in Asia for nearly three years, following her interest in Eastern philosophy and culture while earning money by teaching English. She continued to sing – in Japan, professionally – and while living in Java and Bali became very interested in gamelan music. She also lived in India for a total of 18 months.

On returning to England, Gaskin was invited by drummer Germaine Dolan to play keyboards and sing in the all female band Red Roll On. Based in Canterbury, the band played in clubs and art colleges in the London area. But Gaskin also renewed her musical association with Dave Stewart by contributing vocals to his compositions on Bill Bruford&#x27;s &quot;Gradually Going Tornado&quot; album. In 1981 Gaskin and Stewart joined forces and recorded the hit single &quot;It&#x27;s My Party&quot;. The collaboration has continued to this day with a series of singles and albums on their own Broken Records label and Rykodisc Records. After 40 years together in 2021 Gaskin and Stewart were finally married.

<text>Pieris bryoniae, the dark-veined white or mountain green-veined white, is a Palearctic butterfly of the family Pieridae.

It has variously been considered to be a full species, a subspecies of &quot;Pieris napi&quot; or a superspecies complex. 
==Description and Differentiation==
Seitz-&quot;bryoniae&quot; (21c), which inhabits the Alps, Northern Scandinavia and the mountains
of Asia Minor; the male of the latter is rather more narrow-winged than &quot;napi&quot;-males, not bearing any markings on the forewing above except the blackish apical and basal areas; the female has a yellowish ground-colour, which is however more or less suppressed by the great extent of the dark scaling situated along the veins. Among the females there occur specimens in which the discal spots and the vein-streaks of the forewing are strongly obsolescent, there being consequently no prominent marking; we name this form ab. &quot;obsoleta&quot; nov.; 
individuals in which the yellowish ground-colour, especially on the forewing, is almost entirely suppressed by the greater extension of the dark scaling may be named ab. &quot;concolor&quot; nov..The form &quot;kamtschadalis&quot; Bang-Haas i. 1., from Kamchatka, is in the female somewhat paler than &quot;bryoniae&quot;and the discal spots of the forewing are less sharply marked, the hindwing beneath being much paler. &quot;sifanica&quot; Gr.-Grsh., from Amdo, is nearly as large as &quot;orientis&quot; [&quot;Pieris melete orientis&quot;&quot; Oberthür, 1880]; in males the veins are broadly edged with greenish black beneath; it has not yet been ascertained if &quot;sifanica&quot; is really different from &quot;orientis&quot;. 

The main difference with respect to the phylogenetically similar species ( &quot;Pieris napi&quot; , &quot;Pieris ergane&quot;, &quot;Pieris rapae&quot; ) is the presence of much more marked alar veins on both wings, especially on the upper part. The female has a basic coloration ranging from yellowish to greyish-brown. In some cases, the male is almost indistinguishable, as sexual dimorphism is almost absent. In some cases there is a blackish-gray band along the entire external margin of the fore wing. On the rear wing the endings of the veins may widen to form dark triangulations. The summer generations are paler than the spring ones and, in general, the front wings are paler than the rear ones, as well as having less marked veins. Other less evident morphological characteristics are currently the subject of discussion among entomologists, given that their relevance appears only in restricted populations.The wingspan is between 4 and 4.4 cm. Ireland female &quot;napi&quot; are often heavily marked but Langham (1922) failed to find &quot;bryoniae&quot;.

The type locality of the nominate form is the Alps, where it is found at considerable altitudes (up to 2000 m) and has only one generation per year. Both pairs of the female&#x27;s wings are dark. At lower altitudes, two or three generations appear during a year. Subspecies &quot;neobryoniae&quot;, closely resembles the Carpathian populations, and is found in the southern parts of the Alps and ssp. &quot;flavescens&quot; Wagner inhabits the northern parts. The ground coloration of the wings is yellowish or rich yellow, often with a mauve gloss. The populations inhabiting the Carpathians are very varied. The most distinct ones include the ssp. &quot;vihorlatensis&quot; found in Vihorlat, the east Slovak mountains. Others are &quot;Pieris bryoniae adalwinda&quot; Fruhstorfer, 1909 Type locality: Norway, Porsanger.&quot;Pieris bryoniae bicolorata&quot; (Petersen, 1947) Type locality: Schweden, Murjek

*&quot;Pieris bryoniae wolfsbergeri&quot; Eitschberger, 1983 Type locality: Italia, Piemonte, Termi di Valdieri, S. Giovanni, 1500 m.
==Occurrence and habitat== 
The species occurs in the Alps , the Fatra (Slovakia), the High Tatras , the Carpathians , parts of Turkey , the Caucasus , the Tian Shan and the Altai. The altitudinal distribution includes locations between 800 and 2700 meters. Typical habitats are mountainous meadows and flower-filled stream banks. In regions where the flight range of &quot;napi&quot; and &quot;bryoniae&quot; overlaps, hybrids &quot;napi&quot; x &quot;bryoniae&quot; can form .Because of the inherited migratory behavior of napi , these are occasionally found outside of the actual area of occurrence. However, these hybridsare us usually not capable of reproduction. 

==Biology==
In most areas of occurrence, they fly in one generation from May to September, only occasionally further generations can occur. The forage plants of the caterpillars include various cruciferous plants (Brassicaceae), for example &quot;Biscutella laevigata&quot; or &quot;Lunaria rediviva&quot;. The species overwinters as a pupa .
==Other==
It is much sought after by collectors, particularly in Austria. This is because one of the most variable populations of this butterfly lives in the well-known Mödling area near Vienna.

<text>The clouded Apollo (&quot;Parnassius mnemosyne&quot;) is a butterfly species of the family of swallowtail butterflies (Papilionidae) found in the Palearctic realm.

Clouded Apollos inhabit meadows and woodland clearings with plenty of flowering plants, both in the lowlands and in the mountains. It is not usually found at altitudes above 1500 m except in the Central Asian mountains where it is also known from higher altitudes.

==Distribution==

Its range of distribution extends from the Pyrenees, across the Central Massif, the Alps, and the Carpathians as far as central Asia. It inhabits all European countries including Norway, where it appears rarely and only in certain places. A subspecies lived in Denmark, but is now extinct. A great number of geographical races and individual forms are distinguished in this extensive region. The most striking specimens include the dark race from the eastern Bavarian Alps (subspecies &quot;hartmanni&quot;); form &quot;melania&quot; has the most pronounced dark colouring.

The paper of Dr. I.N. Bolotov and colleagues (2013) summarizes data on the northern localities of &quot;Parnassius mnemosyne&quot;, which are mostly situated in the Russian Federation and gives a thorough description of the species&#x27; northern range location. It is shown that the northernmost populations in the exist within the karst landscapes in the north of White Sea-Kuloi Plateau (between 65°35&#x27; and 66°03&#x27; N) in the downstream of the Soyana and Kuloi rivers and in the north of Timan Highland (66°10&#x27; N) along the shore of Kosminskoe Lake (the Pechora River basin). Northern limits of the clouded Apollo&#x27;s range appear to be strongly determined by the distribution of its larval host plants (primarily &quot;Corydalis solida&quot; and the role of climate and relief seem to be of minor importance. Many Russian populations inhabit the state nature reserve territories: Kizgi Scerries Reserve (Karelia Republic), Pinega and Soyansky reserves (Arkhangelsk Oblast), Pechoro-Ilychsky and Belaja Kedva reserves (Komi Republic).

==Type locality==
The type locality is Åland.


==Description==
Wings white; the veins thinly black, fringes blackish; forewing with 2 black cell -spots, distal margin in male from the apex to about middle, in female further down and also more broadly, transparent -grey; hindwing dusted with black from the abdominal margin to the cell and at the apex of the cell, more densely in female than in male. Antenna and legs black, likewise the abdomen, the last being covered with whitish hairs in the male, while in the female it is nearly naked, glossy, bearing a whitish bladder-like pouch which occupies nearly two -thirds of the underside. Varies generally little.
A rare aberration in which the cell-spots of the forewing are connected by a black streak has received the name ab. &quot;halteres&quot; Mosch., and as ab. &quot;melaina&quot; Honr.a form has been introduced which is darkened by dense black dusting (occurring especially often in the female and which is found everywhere among the ordinary form, being particularly often met with in Carinthia, Carniola, in the neighborhood of Vienna, in Wallis, Transsylvania, and Austrian Silesia. In Carinthia, the environs of Friesach, at an elevation of from 630 to 750 m, there occurs a conspicuously small local form, &quot;minor&quot; Reb. &amp; Rog., in which the black spots of the forewing are reduced, the expanse being only 52 mm. In Bavaria and Salzkammergut (Berchtesgaden), at an altitude of about 1000 m (June—July), the species has developed into a constant melanotic form, &quot;hartmanni&quot; Stgr., the males of which bear an additional grey costal spot in between the apical cell-spot and the widened and dull blackish transparent marginal band, having moreover the abdominal border of the hindwing broader and more densely dusted with black; the females of this form are developed in the same direction as ab. &quot;melaina&quot;, but are usually less dark in tint, have a very broad transparent border to the forewing, sometimes a grey S-shaped shadowy transverse band which emanates from the costal spot above mentioned in the male, and possess on the hindwing a more intensely coloured band -like marking behind the cell, extending from the abdominal border forward, and 1 or 2 costal spots. — &quot;athene&quot; Stich, is the form inhabiting Greece (Chelmos, Olenos) ; it bears a row of 4 or 5 whitish spots in the moderately broad, posteriorly sharply tapering transparent border of the forewing, otherwise agreeing rather well with ordinary &quot;mnemosyne&quot; in being somewhat more strongly marked, therefore standing midway between the former and the following form. — &quot;nubilosus&quot; Christ. (10 f) is the name of the race from Northern Persia and the Caucasus; the white spots in the widened marginal border are more distinctly developed, forming
usually a submarginal band consisting of 7 or 8 wedge-shaped or luniform spots; the black markings are intensified and extended, and in the male there appears on the forewing a grey abbreviated band between the apical cell -spot and the transparent border, the forewing bearing further a grey spot at the hind margin and the hindwing bearing an extended dusting of black beyond the cell, forming a kind of band. An enlarged edition of this form from Central Asia (Kuldja, Alai), with the black markings still more intensified and the transparent border more widened, is known as &quot;gigantea&quot; Stgr. (10f): specimens of this race in which the ground-colour has assumed a slightly yellowish tint are called ab. &quot;ochracea&quot; Aust. — The egg of the species is conical, whitish. Larva cylindrical, tapering at both ends, black, short-hairy, the body ornamented 
with orange spots; feeds in April and May on &quot;Corydalis&quot; &quot;mnemosyne&quot; typ. on &quot;C. halleri&quot;, &quot;C. cava&quot;, &quot;C. solida&quot;, concealed in day-time. Pupation in the ground in a loose cocoon ; pupa thick, obtuse, hoary, luteous.
==Habits==
The clouded Apollo is locally common in some places in central Europe. The female lays whitish eggs with a granular surface. The caterpillar feeds only on sunny days, otherwise it is hidden under leaves or stones. The blunt-ended chrysalis lies on the ground in a light spun covering. The caterpillars feed exclusively on &quot;Corydalis&quot; species.
To prevent the continuing disappearance of this butterfly from many places in central Europe, it is now protected in some regions. They inhabit small patches and individuals move from patch to patch and conservation of a network of patches is required to maintain the gene pool.

==Etymology==
The species was named in the classical tradition for Mnemosyne the mother of the nine Muses

<text>Forugh Farrokhzad (; 28 December 1934 – 14 February 1967) was an influential Iranian poet and film director. She was a controversial modernist poet and an iconoclastic, feminist author. Farrokhzad died in a car accident at the age of 32.

==Early life and career==
Forugh Farrokhzad was born in Tehran on 28 December 1934, to career military officer Colonel Mohammad Bagher Farrokhzad (the Farrokhzad family hail from Tafresh) and his wife Touran Vaziri-Tabar. The fourth of seven children (the others being Amir, Massoud, Mehrdad, Fereydoun, Pooran, and Gloria), she attended school until the ninth grade, then was taught painting and sewing at a girls&#x27; school for the manual arts. At the age of 16, she was married to satirist Parviz Shapour. She continued her education with painting and sewing classes and moved with her husband to Ahvaz. Her only child, a son named Kamyar Shapour (subject of &quot;The Return&quot;), was born a year later.

&quot;After her separation, and later her divorce (1954), from Parviz, she lost custody of her son because she had had several affairs. Her son Kamyar, whom she affectionately calls Kami, was taken away from her and brought up by Parviz and his family. Forugh was given very few visiting rights, and the child was brought up with the impression that his mother had abandoned him for poetry and the pursuit of her sexual pleasures. The thought of her son thinking that she willingly abandoned him was a source of great sorrow and constant torment for her.&quot;

Farrokhzad spent nine months in Europe in 1958. After returning to Iran, in search of a job she met filmmaker and writer Ebrahim Golestan, who reinforced her own inclinations to express herself and live independently, and with whom she began a love affair. She published two more volumes, &quot;The Wall&quot; and &quot;The Rebellion&quot;, before traveling to Tabriz to make a film about Iranians affected by leprosy. This 1962 documentary film, titled &quot;&quot;, is considered to be an essential part of the Iranian New Wave movement. During the 12 days of shooting, she became attached to Hossein Mansouri, the child of two lepers. She adopted the boy and brought him to live at her mother&#x27;s house.

She published &quot;Reborn&quot; in 1964. Her poetry at that time varied significantly from former Iranian poetic traditions.

==Feminine perspective in Farrokhzad&#x27;s poetry==

Farrokhzad&#x27;s strong feminine voice became the focus of much negative attention and open disapproval, both during her lifetime and in the posthumous reception of her work.

In a radio interview, when asked about the feminine perspective in her poems, Farrokhzad replied: &quot;If my poems, as you say, have an aspect of femininity, it is of course quite natural. After all, fortunately, I am a woman. But if you speak of artistic merits, I think gender cannot play a role. In fact, to even voice such a suggestion is unethical. It is natural that a woman, because of her physical, emotional, and spiritual inclinations, may give certain issues greater attention, issues that men may not normally address. I believe that if those who choose art to express their inner self, feel they have to do so with their gender in mind, they would never progress in their art -- and that is not right. So when I write, if I keep thinking, oh I&#x27;m a woman and I must address feminine issues rather than human issues, then that is a kind of stopping and self-destruction. Because what matters, is to cultivate and nourish one&#x27;s own positive characteristics until one reaches a level worthy of being a human. What is important is the work produced by a human being and not one labelled as a man or a woman. When a poem reaches a certain level of maturation, it separates itself from its creator and connects to a world where it is valid based on its own merits.&quot; Emphasizing human issues, she also calls for a recognition of women&#x27;s abilities that goes beyond the traditional binary oppositions.

==Death==
Farrokhzad died in a car accident on 14 February 1967, at the age of 32. Although the exact circumstances of her demise have been the subject of much debate, the official story is that she swerved her jeep to avoid an oncoming school bus and was thrown out of her car, hitting her head against the curb. It was believed she died before reaching the hospital, however, Farzaneh Milani in her book, &quot;Forugh Farrokhzad: A Literary Biography with Unpublished Letters&quot;, cites an interview with Ebrahim Golestan who speaks about Farrokhzad&#x27;s final moments where she died in his arms. Farrokhzad&#x27;s poem &quot;Let Us Believe in the Dawn of the Cold Season&quot; was published posthumously, and is considered by some to be one of the best-structured modern poems in Persian.

==Legacy==

Farrokhzad&#x27;s poetry was banned for more than a decade after the Islamic Revolution. A brief literary biography of Farrokhzad, Michael Craig Hillmann&#x27;s &quot;A Lonely Woman: Forough Farrokhzad and Her Poetry&quot;, was published in 1987. Farzaneh Milani&#x27;s work &quot;Veils and Words: The Emerging Voices of Iranian Women Writers&quot; (1992) included a chapter about her. Abdolali Dastgheib, literary critic writer, published a critical review of Farrokhzad&#x27;s poems titled &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; (Farsi title پری کوچک دریا) (2006) in which he describes Forugh as a pioneer in modern Farsi poetry who symbolizes feminism in her work. Nasser Saffarian has directed three documentaries about her life: &quot;The Mirror of the Soul&quot; (2000), &quot;The Green Cold&quot; (2003), and &quot;Summit of the Wave&quot; (2004).

In February 2017, on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of Farrokhzad&#x27;s death, the 94-year-old Golestan broke his silence about his relationship with her, speaking to Saeed Kamali Dehghan of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. &quot;I rue all the years she isn&#x27;t here, of course, that&#x27;s obvious,&quot; he said. &quot;We were very close, but I can&#x27;t measure how much I had feelings for her. How can I? In kilos? In metres?&quot;

<doc id="907065" wikidata="Q318393" url="?curid=907065" title="Vasily Polenov">
<text>Vasily Dmitrievich Polenov (; 1 June 1844 – 18 July 1927) was a Russian landscape painter associated with the Peredvizhniki movement of realist artists. His contemporaries would call him the “Knight of Beauty” as he embodied both European and Russian traditions of painting. His vision of life was summarized as following: “Art should promote happiness and joy”. As a painter and a humanist, he would truly believe in the civilizing mission of Art, Culture and Education. 
== Early life and family heritage ==
As a native of St. Petersburg, Polenov grew up in a wealthy, intellectual and artistic family. During his teenage years, in 1860s, Russia was energized by great minds promoting virtues of democracy, progress, education, and they would stand against oppression.

The painter&#x27;s father, Dmitriy Vasilevich Polenov (1806–1872), was a well known archaeologist and bibliographer. As a representative of the Academy of Sciences and then as the secretary of the Russian embassy of Athens, he spent 3 years in Greece. There he would meet important personalities at the time linked to the world of Art and Science: the painter Karl Briullov, the architect Roman Kuzmin (some years after, he would help design and build the Polenov family house at Imotchensy). At his return to Russia, according to the advice he received during his life abroad, Dmitri Polenov started to do archaeological digs in ancient Russian sites. For many years he devoted his knowledge and work to the Secretary of the Russian Archeological Society. In 1860, he travelled with his sons. This long horseback journey led them to Novgorod, Rostov, Yaroslav, Suzdal, Vladimir, Tver. Vasily Polenov was encouraged by his father to draw sketches of any interesting ancient subject he would witness. His mother, Maria Alekseevna (1816–1895), was a painter and a portraitist; she received her lessons from the academician Moldavski, a partner of Karl Briullov. She also wrote a book in 1852 about the life of a family spending the summertime in a dacha. &quot;Summer in Tsarkoye Selo&quot; was then re-edited with illustrations made by Vassili Polenov and his younger sister, Elena, also an artist. From both parents and grandparents Vasily and his siblings would receive general knowledge about physics, history, geography and also the biographies of famous painters and musicians, and this tradition was stated in his mother&#x27;s book in order to reach other children.

His maternal grandmother was also really important during the painter&#x27;s childhood. Vera Voeikova (1792–1873) received an excellent education as a young girl thanks to a woman that raised her after her parents’ death. She knew French and Russian literature. As a “mamie”, she managed to teach the importance of developing artistic abilities and she was also telling stories about the war of 1812. Her fiancé, the Colonel Alexeï Voeikov, had important missions back in the days as a military. Today, at the Museum-House of Polenovo, we can see a glass cup with the Napoleonic coat of arm: Alexeï retrieved it from a chest containing French army official dinner service.

Other important ancestor of Vasily Polenov was his great grandfather, Alekseï Polenov (1738–1816). As a famous scholar, he was the first Russian jurist with a multidisciplinary education (economics, history, philosophy...). He participated to an essay competition organized by the Free Economic Society in 1766 on the following subject: “&quot;what is more useful to the State: that peasants should own land or own only property?&quot;”. His text was then entitled “&quot;On the abolition of the serfdom of russian peasants&quot;”, which became effective 100 years after.

== Studies and European years ==
Vasily Polenov simultaneously enrolled to the Imperial Academy of Arts and to the Law University in Saint Petersbourg (1863–1871). Polenov studied under Pavel Chistyakov and was a classmate and close friend of Rafail Levitsky, a fellow Peredvizhniki artist and photographer. Their letters, which are now stored in the Polenov&#x27;s House museum, are an interesting account of the many art exhibitions, movements and artists of their time.

As bachelors, Polenov and Levitsky lived and worked together in &quot;Devich&#x27;e Pole&quot; (the name of the street &quot;Maiden&#x27;s Field&quot;), in an attic of the Olsufevsky House (the home of Rafail Levitsky&#x27;s future wife Anna Vasilevna Olsufevskaya). This house is illustrated by Polenov in his painting &quot;Grandmother&#x27;s Garden&quot; (1878).

As one of the best students of the Imperial Academy of Fine Arts, he received the Great Medal for his painting &quot;The Resurrection of the daughter of Jairus&quot; (1871, Museum of the Academy of Fine Arts, St. Petersburg). This work was his first approach to a biblical theme for which the young artist had a deep interest. The price he received for this painting allowed him, along with other laureates, to become a pensioner (scholarship&#x27;s owner) abroad and live in Europe at the expenses of the Russian State. At the end of the summer of 1872, Vasily Polenov crossed Germany and Switzerland before settling in Venice and then Rome the following year. His Italian stay did not stimulate him much, he lacked from inspiration and worked very little. Nevertheless, there, two major encounters happened and shaped his lifetime work. In &quot;the Eternal City&quot;, he felt in love with the young Maroussia Obolenskaya who tragically died the same year of measles. However, Rome, has also been the scene of a fruitful and exciting meeting with Savva Mamontov (1841–1918), a rich entrepreneur, art lover and philanthrope. Together, in Italy, they were already planning to create a circle of multidisciplinary artists. The Mamontov&#x27;s estate in Abramtsevo seemed to be the ideal place to set up some artists&#x27; studios and a theater.

It is also in Italy that his passion and admiration for the painter Paul Veronese (1528–1588), a great colourist of the Venetian golden age, was confirmed. Vasily Polenov wrote about him: &quot;&quot;He has something attractive, which makes anyone fall in love with his art; we feel the taste of life in the people he paints&quot; &quot;. He also acquired one of his sketches, &quot;The Struggle of Jacob with the Angel&quot;, which he will keep later in the library of the house-museum.

The second major chapter of his stay in Europe is in France, in Paris and Normandy. It is in Montmartre at 72 rue Blanche and at 13 rue Véron that he established his studio in the autumn of 1973. In Paris, he attended Alexei Bogolyubov’s events (1824–1896), an official painter of the Russian Navy and also in charge of the orientation of the young residents of the Imperial Academy in France. He played a vital role in the careers of young artists because he would find them clients and present them to the restricted circles of the Parisian artistic world. Every Tuesday, the preceptor organized ceramics and etching workshops while bringing together painters, writers and singers. The creation of painted ceramics was also a good mean of acquiring additional incomes for the scholars, as these objects were highly prized in the French capital. These Russian meetings were mainly frequented by the painters Ilya Repine, Vasily Polenov, Konstantin Savitski, Alexander Beggrov, Nikolai Dmitriev-Orenburgsky, Pentaleon Schyndler, Alexei Harlamov and Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolski.

During these years, the painter tried all kinds of painting in order to find his true talent. He painted historical scenes (&quot;The Arrest of the Huguenot&quot;, thanks to which he will obtain the title of Academician), daily life scenes, portraits and many Normandy’s landscapes. When he returned from his trip, he made a decisive statement for his career: &quot;&quot;There, I tried all kinds of painting [...], and I came to the conclusion that I have mostly talent for landscapes and scenes of everyday life, which I will exploit in the future.&quot; &quot;

In the summer of 1874, Ilya Repine and Vasily Polenov followed the advice of their preceptor Bogoliubov and went to Normandy in quest for spontaneous impressions. There, they would mainly work outdoors, according to the influence of the Barbizon School. They spent several months in the company of other Russian artists in Veules-les-Roses, a setting combining cliffs by the sea and countryside. He completed his European work by returning to Paris, devoting himself to historical subjects after this momentous period of his career dedicated to Norman landscapes. In the late 1870s, Polenov concentrated on painting following the realist tradition of Aleksey Savrasov and Fyodor Vasilyev. He attempted to impart the silent poetry of Russian nature, related to daily human life and his paintings generally reflect his sensitivity and delicacy, combining harmony and appeasement but also nostalgia.

Vasily Polenov&#x27;s European residential school ended prematurely because he took part in the Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878) as a war artist.

== The Wanderers’ movement and the Abramtsevo Circle ==
During the 1880s, his work was spotted by Vladimir Stassov, a supporter of the traveling exhibition society (the Wanderers), which he joined then. This artistic movement was born from the desire to break with the themes imposed by the Academy to better represent contemporary concerns. In addition, the members promote the accessibility of art among the people by organizing traveling exhibitions (not limited to the artistic centers of Moscow and St. Petersburg). Through their eminently realistic painting, they seek to denounce the living conditions of the Russian population and to promote greater literacy. His works won the admiration of Pavel Mikhailovich Tretyakov, who acquired many of them for his gallery. He was one of the first Russian artists who achieved a plein air freshness of color combined with artistic finish of composition (&quot;Moscow Courtyard&quot;, 1878; &quot;Grandmother&#x27;s Garden&quot;, 1878; &quot;Overgrown Pond&quot;, 1879). The principles developed by Polenov had a great impact on the further development of Russian (and especially Soviet) landscape painting.

He also began to attend retreats of the Abramtsevo circle. The name comes from the village where the property of Savva Mamontov is. Savva and Vasily had met a decade before in Italy and were now ready to create together surrounded by artists from all disciplines. The very essence of this place was to give freedom of creation, renouncing to academic aesthetic canons. Savva Mamontov would animate his workshops based on traditional art and Russian folklore.

There, all art practices were combined: painting, architecture, music but also decorative and popular arts such as wood crafting and ceramics. In addition to Polenov, the main artists that took part of the circle were Repin, Viktor Vasnetsov, Constantin Korovin, Mikhail Vrubel, Elena Polenova (Polenov&#x27;s younger sister, a brilliant watercolourist and ceramist), Mikhail Nesterov, Maria Iakountchikova (future sister-in-law of the artist) ...

Abramtsevo even received the nickname of &quot;Russian Barbizon&quot;. The Neo Russian style was born within this estate, premise of the national Art Nouveau. Polenov painted among others in Abramtsevo, &quot;The Birch Alley in the Park&quot;, &quot;In the Boat&quot; (1880), &quot;La Voria&quot; (1881) and &quot;The Upper Pond in Abramtsevo&quot; (1882). He also worked in stage design. Most notably, he decorated Savva Mamontov&#x27;s mansion in Abramtsevo and his Russian Private Opera. Later, in 1910–1918, Polenov was involved in a folk theatre project.There he met his future wife, Natalia (1858–1931), Maria Iakountchikova&#x27;s sister.

In 1881, Polenov undertook a trip to the Middle East and Egypt to work on the biblical theme. He hopes to find details of daily life and landscapes that will inspire him to represent the life of the Christ. He painted many studies about scenes of the life of Christ but the most famous is &quot;Christ and the sinner&quot;, his lifetime masterpiece. This painting is considered as the work of his life for both his artistic career as for the realization of his dearest wishes. He first made a real-sized preparatory study in the mansion of Savva Mamontov in Moscow before directly painting the final work that will be part of the fifteenth itinerant exhibition of the winter of 1887. Alexander III will buy it, making the painter financially at ease after this sale.

From 1883 to 1895, Polenov coached many young artists at the Moscow School of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture. His most talented students are Abram Arkhipov, Isaac Levitan, Konstantin Korovin and Alexander Golovine. The artist was very important to the teaching of the technique, being very demanding on the quality of colors and canvases. In 1893 he became a member of the Academy of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg. Polenov was elected a member of the St.Petersburg Academy of arts in 1893.

== The Artist’s studio museum, the House of the Oka ==
In the late 1880s, Polenov dreamed of a house-museum in the countryside in order to spread the benefits of a rich cultural life. He wanted to create his own place of creation and education but also a place where he could expose the archaeological and artistic collections gathered by his family along the decades. In 1889, he made a trip to the area of Taroussa, 130 km south of Moscow, with his friend and disciple Constantin Korovine. Struck by the beauty of the place, he decided that he will make his dream true there, on the banks of the river Oka. Thanks to the purchase by Tsar Alexander III of his painting &quot;Christ and the sinner&quot; (1884) for the amount, huge at the time, of 30 000 rubles, he bought a sandy hill overlooking the river, not far from the small village of Bekhovo.

The house, built based on the model his childhood&#x27;s house in Imotchentsy, was completed in 1892. It is a large three-storey wooden building. He realized himself the plans the design of it and the general style approaches Art Nouveau, which he himself called &quot;Scandinavian&quot;, mixing Romanesque and Gothic architecture but also Western medieval style. From the outside, the house remains very original by multiplying volumes and facades, varying the roofs’ shapes and sizes. The ground floor is occupied by common rooms (library, dining room, games room). On the upper floors are the living rooms, Polenov&#x27;s workshop and his wife&#x27;s office. Large windows are arranged to admire the view of the Oka and Taroussa at the time. Since then, the trees planted by the artist, his children and local peasants, are closing a little bit the view but offers a dense forest. Pines mainly grew up on this sandy land. Little by little, he also built annexes: a cart shed, stables, a house for the workers, &quot;the admiralty&quot;, intended to be the house for the boats (today the room is dedicated to the diorama), a small isba for children, and finally Polenov&#x27;s final workshop, &quot;the abbey&quot; a large brick building to be his last studio (it was also used for theatrical performances).

Paying tribute to the family&#x27;s humanist tradition, the Polenov improved the living conditions of the surroundings ’populations. Struck by the pitiful state of schools and the difficult living conditions of the teachers, with his wife they built two schools and organized cultural trips to Moscow for the instructors. To meet the needs of the peasants, they also build a church of which Polenov is the architect. Children from surrounding villages are regularly invited to theatrical performances at the estate, &quot;Old Borok&quot;. In 1918, after the Revolution, the house-museum became the first national museum and was renamed Polenovo after the death of the artist, in 1927. Polenov&#x27;s great-granddaughter Natalia Polenova has been a director of Polenovo since 2011.

<text>Henry Lee Fambrough (May 10, 1938 – February 7, 2024) was an American vocalist, known for being a member of the R&amp;B quintet The Spinners (also called The Detroit Spinners and The Motown Spinners) from 1954 until his retirement in April 2023. He was the last surviving original member of The Spinners from 2013 until his death.

== The Spinners ==
The Spinners formed in 1954 in Ferndale, Michigan, as the Domingoes before changing their name to the Spinners. Fambrough was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1961 and on his return two years later, the Spinners signed up under Motown Records. They did not have any big hits for the next six years, and Fambrough ended up working as a chauffeur for the mother of label boss Berry Gordy Jr.

During the group&#x27;s heyday from the early to mid-1970s, Henry served as one of the group&#x27;s three lead singers (along with Philippé Wynne and Bobby Smith) and his rich baritone provided lead vocals for the Spinners classic &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Lose You&quot;, as well as co-lead vocals with Wynne on &quot;Living a Little, Laughing a Little&quot;.

On the group&#x27;s classic single &quot;Ghetto Child&quot;, he shared leads with Wynne and Smith. He dueted with Dionne Warwick on the Spinners&#x27; &quot;Just As Long As We Have Love&quot;, from their 1975 album &quot;Pick of the Litter&quot;, and sang lead on the classic album cut &quot;If You Can&#x27;t Be in Love&quot;, from the album &quot;Happiness Is Being with the Spinners&quot; (1976). Fambrough was noted for the whiplash mustache he wore at that time.

With the release of the group&#x27;s most recent album &quot;Round the Block and Back Again&quot; in 2021, Fambrough is the only member of the Spinners to have been featured on every release.

=== Retirement ===
In April 2023, Fambrough announced his retirement, but the Spinners continued to perform without him, and he remained involved with the group behind the scenes. He was in the group for sixty-nine years. The following month, the Spinners were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, sixty-nine years after forming, and thirty-seven years after first being eligible to be inducted.

Following his announcement on retiring, he told Spinners fans: &quot;The Spinners are still here and still singing for our people who want to hear us. And that&#x27;s not going to change. We&#x27;ll still be there for them.&quot;

With the deaths of fellow Spinners members C. P. Spencer in 2004, Billy Henderson in 2007, Pervis Jackson in 2008, and Bobby Smith in 2013, Fambrough was the last original member of the group. He died on February 7, 2024, in Sterling, Virginia, at the age of 85. Fambrough was survived by his wife, Norma and daughter, Heather Williams. His funeral was held in a Detroit church where he was a long-time member and he was interred in Woodlawn Cemetery on the city&#x27;s north side.

<doc id="907075" wikidata="Q2364768" url="?curid=907075" title="Visual field">
<text>The visual field is &quot;that portion of space in which objects are visible at the same moment during steady fixation of the gaze in one direction&quot;; in ophthalmology and neurology the emphasis is mostly on the structure inside the visual field and it is then considered “the field of functional capacity obtained and recorded by means of perimetry”.

However, the visual field can also be understood as a predominantly &quot;perceptual&quot; concept and its definition then becomes that of the &quot;spatial array of visual sensations available to observation in introspectionist psychological experiments&quot;
(for example in van Doorn et al., 2013).

The corresponding concept for optical instruments and image sensors is the field of view (FOV). In humans and animals, the FOV refers to the area visible when eye movements – if possible for the species – are allowed.

In optometry, ophthalmology, and neurology, a visual field test is used to determine whether the visual field is affected by diseases that cause local scotoma or a more extensive loss of vision or a reduction in sensitivity (increase in threshold).

==Normal limits==
 The normal (monocular) human visual field extends to approximately 60 degrees nasally (toward the nose, or inward) from the vertical meridian in each eye, to 107 degrees temporally (away from the nose, or outwards) from the vertical meridian, and approximately 70 degrees above and 80 below the horizontal meridian. 
The binocular visual field is the superimposition of the two monocular fields. In the binocular field, the area left of the vertical meridian is referred to as the left visual field (which is located temporally for the left, and nasally for the right eye); a corresponding definition holds for the right visual field. The four areas delimited by the vertical and horizontal meridian are referred to as upper/lower left/right quadrants. In the European Union, the minimum field requirement for driving is 50 degrees to either side of the vertical meridian and 120 degrees horizontally in total, and 20 degrees above and below the horizontal meridian. The macula corresponds to the central 17 degrees diameter of the visual field; the fovea to the central 5.2 degrees, and the foveola to 1–1.2 degrees diameter.
 Note that in the clinical literature the fovea can refer to the central 1–1.2 deg, i.e. what is otherwise known as the foveola, and can be referred to as the &quot;clinical fovea&quot;.

The nose is situated in the field of view of both eyes, but due to later processing carried out in the brain, it is not noticed during normal visual tasks.

==Measuring the visual field==

The visual field is measured by perimetry. This may be kinetic, where spots of light are shown on the white interior of a half sphere and slowly moved inwards until the observer sees them, or static, where the light spots are flashed at varying intensities at fixed locations in the sphere until detected by the subject. Commonly used perimeters are the automated Humphrey Field Analyzer, Optopol Perimeters, Octopus, the Heidelberg Edge Perimeter, or the Oculus.

Another method is to use a campimeter, a small device with a flat screen designed to measure the central visual field.

Light spot patterns testing the central 24 degrees or 30 degrees of the visual field, are most commonly used. Most perimeters are also capable of testing up to 80 or 90 or even 120 degrees.

Another method is for the practitioner to hold up one, two, or five fingers in the four quadrants and center of a patient&#x27;s visual field (with the other eye covered). This is also known as confrontational field testing. If the patient is able to report the number of fingers properly as compared with the visual field of the practitioner, the normal result is recorded as &quot;full to finger counting&quot; (often abbreviated FTFC). The blind spot can also be assessed via holding a small object between the practitioner and the patient. By comparing when the object disappears for the practitioner, a subject&#x27;s blind spot can be identified. There are many variants of this type of exam (e.g., wiggling fingers in the visual periphery on the cardinal axes).

==Visual field loss==
Visual field loss may occur due to many disease or disorders of the eye, optic nerve, or brain. For the eye, e.g., Glaucoma causes peripheral field defects. Macular degeneration and other diseases affecting the macula cause central field defects. Lesions of the visual pathway cause characteristic forms of visual disturbances, including homonymous hemianopsia, quadrantanopsia, and scotomata.

The main classification of visual field defects is into
#Lesions to the eye&#x27;s retina (heteronymous field defects in Glaucoma and AMD)
#Lesions of the optic nerve (heteronymous field defects)
#Lesions in the chiasm (e.g. Bitemporal hemianopia, loss of vision at the sides)
#Lesions after the chiasm (homonymous field defects like homonymous hemianopia, Quadrantanopia, homonymous scotomata)

Other characterisations are:
#Altitudinal field defects, loss of vision above or below the horizontal meridian – associated with ocular abnormalities
#Central scotoma, loss of central vision
#Peripheral field loss including tunnel vision
#Generalized depression of the entire field of vision 

===Visual field defects in glaucoma===
In glaucoma, visual field defects result from damage to the retinal nerve fiber layer. Field defects are seen mainly in primary open angle glaucoma. Because of the unique anatomy of the RNFL, many noticeable patterns are seen in the visual field. Most of the early glaucomatous changes are seen within the central visual field, mainly in Bjerrum&#x27;s area, 10°-20° from fixation.

Following are the common glaucomatous field defects:

* Generalized depression: Generalized depression is seen in early stages of glaucoma and many other conditions. Mild constriction of the central and peripheral visual field due to contraction comes under generalized depression. If all the isopters show similar depression to the same point, it is called a contraction of the visual field. Relative paracentral scotomas are the areas where smaller and dimmer targets are not detected by the patient. Larger and brighter targets can be seen. Small paracentral depressions, mainly superonasal, occur in normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). The generalized depression of the entire field may occur in cataract also.
* Baring of blind spot: Baring of the blind spot means the exclusion of the blind spot from the central field due to inward curve of the outer boundary of the 30° central field. It is only an early, non-specific visual field change, without much diagnostic value in glaucoma.
* Small wing-shaped paracentral scotoma: Small wing-shaped paracentral scotoma within Bjerrum&#x27;s area is the earliest clinically significant field defect seen in glaucoma. It may also be associated with nasal steps. Scotoma may be seen above or below the blind spot.
* Siedel&#x27;s sickle-shaped scotoma: Paracentral scotoma joins with the blind spot to form Siedel&#x27;s sickle-shaped scotoma. 
* Arcuate or Bjerrum&#x27;s scotoma: This kind of scotoma is formed at later stages of glaucoma by extension of Seidel&#x27;s scotoma in an area either above or below the fixation point to reach the horizontal line. Peripheral breakthrough may occur due to damage of nerve fibers.
* Ring or double arcuate scotoma: Two arcuate scotomas join to form a ring or double arcuate scotoma. This defect is seen in advanced stages of glaucoma.
* Roenne&#x27;s central nasal step: It is created when two arcuate scotomas run in different arcs to form a right angled defect. This is also seen in advanced stages of glaucoma.
* Peripheral field defects: Peripheral field defects may occur in early or late stages of glaucoma. Roenne&#x27;s peripheral nasal steps occur due to contraction of peripheral isopter.
* Tubular vision: Since macular fibers are the most resistant to glaucomatous damage, central vision remains unaffected until the end stages of glaucoma. It results in tubular vision, or tunnel vision, by the loss of peripheral vision with retention of central vision, resulting in a constricted circular tunnel-like field of vision. Retinitis pigmentosa is another disease that causes tubular vision.
* Temporal island of vision: It is also seen in end stages of glaucoma. The temporal islands lie outside of the central 24 to 30° visual field, so it may not be visible with standard central field measurements done in glaucoma.

===Field defects in macular degeneration (AMD)=== 
The macula of the retina is the central area in the visual field of about 10 to 17 deg diameter (in visual angle). It is responsible for high-resolution vision in good light, in particular for &quot;reading&quot;. Many diseases affecting the macula may cause defects in the central field of vision, among them metamorphopsia and central scotomas.

===Field defects in visual pathway lesions=== 

The visual pathway consists of structures that carry visual information from the retina to the brain. Lesions in the pathway cause a variety of visual field defects. The type of field defect can help localize where the lesion is located (see figure).
*A lesion in the optic nerve of one eye causes partial or complete loss of vision in the same eye, with an intact field of vision in other eye. 
*A lesion at the proximal part of optic nerve of one eye cause, central field defect in one eye and temporal half-field defect in the other eye (not shown in the figure).
*A lesion in the center of the optic chiasma causes bitemporal hemianopia 
*A lesion to the optic tract, or involving the complete optic radiation causes homonymous hemianopia
*When part of the optic radiation in the parietal lobe is affected, the resulting field defect may be inferior quadrant hemianopia

===Neurological causes of visual field defects===
* Cerebral palsy: Field loss due to cerebral palsy may be hemianopic affecting even upper or lower half, central scotoma, peripheral scotoma, or islands of vision.
* Epilepsy: Although field defects are rarely associated with epilepsy, defects may occur after temporal lobe surgery for epilepsy. 
* Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL): Bilateral inferior visual field defects may occur due to damage of the optic radiations.

===Other causes of field defects===
* Generalized depression is seen in cataract
* Central visual field loss is seen in Optic neuritis, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy, Macular hole, Cone dystrophy, Branch retinal artery occlusion etc.
* Peripheral visual field loss including tunnel vision is seen in Retinal detachment, Retinitis pigmentosa, Branch retinal vein occlusion etc.
* Hemianopia and quadrantanopia are seen in patients with stroke, traumatic brain injury, tumor etc.
* Altitudinal visual field defect is seen anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, compressive neuropathy (due to a tumor or aneurysm), Branch retinal artery occlusion, Branch retinal vein occlusion, Coloboma, Papilloedema, lesions in visual cortex etc.

The following illustrations are a rough attempt at visualizing a number of visual field defects. Note that they do not (and cannot) visualize the percept (i.e. what is seen by the observer). For example, the visual fields for the two eyes are seen as one field. The missing areas are not seen as white or black – they are simply invisible to the observer, who is, furthermore, typically unaware that they are invisible.

<doc id="907076" wikidata="Q342572" url="?curid=907076" title="Sander Westerveld">
<text>Sander Westerveld (born 23 October 1974) is a Dutch football coach and former professional player who played as a goalkeeper. He was the goalkeeping coach of South African Premier Soccer League club Ajax Cape Town.

The highlight of his playing career, spent in five countries, was a treble of the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup with Liverpool in 2001. Westerveld was included in the Netherlands&#x27; squads for Euro 2000 and Euro 2004, but, due to the consistency of Edwin van der Sar, earned six international caps over five years.

==Club career==
===Early career and Liverpool===
Westerveld&#x27;s first professional match was for Twente in 1994. After two seasons there, he moved to Vitesse for three.

Following the 1998–99 season, during which he helped Vitesse to qualify for Europe, Westerveld was sold to Liverpool, where he succeeded David James. He became the most expensive goalkeeper in British football when he joined the Reds for a reported fee of £4 million during the summer of 1999. Westerveld made his Liverpool debut against Sheffield Wednesday on 7 August 1999 in a 2–1 away win. Then, on 28 August 1999, he saved a Davor Šuker penalty, as Liverpool beat Arsenal 2–0. He was Gérard Houllier&#x27;s first choice to succeed James as Anfield&#x27;s number one, and Westerveld fully justified the manager&#x27;s confidence by playing a leading role in Liverpool&#x27;s return to Europe, conceding the fewest goals in the 1999–2000 Premier League season.

He played a key role in the treble season of 2000–01 for Liverpool, emerging as the hero of the League Cup final victory over Birmingham City, making the winning save from Andrew Johnson in the penalty shoot-out.

However, towards the end of his two-season spell at Liverpool, he was often subjected to criticism from the media. After a major mistake in a match against Bolton Wanderers on 27 August 2001, he was put on the bench by Houllier, who promptly signed two new goalkeepers, Jerzy Dudek and Chris Kirkland. He did not play again after the Bolton error, and was sold to Real Sociedad of La Liga on 16 December 2001, for £3.4 million.

===Real Sociedad===
Sociedad were runners-up in La Liga in the 2002–03 season, and played in the following season&#x27;s Champions League. However, that season saw him loaned to Mallorca, where Miguel Ángel Moyá kept him out of the team. His contract then expired.

===Portsmouth===
In July 2005, he moved back to the Premier League with Portsmouth, being signed by Alain Perrin on a one-year contract. He was expected to be the first choice goalkeeper, ahead of Jamie Ashdown and Kostas Chalkias. However, after an inconsistent time at Fratton Park, in which he played only six league matches, he was allowed to move on a 28-day loan to Everton, rivals of his former club Liverpool, on 24 February 2006. Everton had a temporary goalkeeping crisis in which Nigel Martyn, Richard Wright and Iain Turner were all unavailable, and Westerveld played two matches for them. When he returned to Portsmouth, he remained a substitute and was released by Harry Redknapp on 11 May 2006.

===Later career===
On 28 July 2006, Westerveld signed with Segunda División club Almería for one season, in which he helped them to achieve promotion to La Liga before leaving the club at the end of his contract.

On 7 September 2007, he joined Sparta Rotterdam on a short-term contract and in May 2008 he announced that he was to leave Sparta.

During the summer of 2009, he signed for Italian Lega Pro Prima Divisione club Monza, after a successful trial with the club. He later joined Ajax Cape Town in South Africa where he was the number 1 goalkeeper. At the end of the 2012–13 season, his contract was terminated, and he then became a goalkeeping coach at the club.

==International career==
Westerveld made his debut for the Netherlands on 8 June 1999, in an away friendly 3–1 defeat to Brazil in Goiânia. He was included in the Dutch squad for Euro 2000, and played the last group match against France, both teams being already qualified. The last of his six caps came on 28 February 2001, in a 0–0 friendly home draw with Turkey, although he did make the squad for Euro 2004.

==Personal life==
Son Sem Westerveld who is playing for Jong AZ, is also a professional football goalkeeper.

<text>Żydowski Związek Wojskowy (ŻZW, Polish for &quot;Jewish Military Union,&quot; ) was an underground resistance organization operating during World War II in the area of the Warsaw Ghetto, which fought during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and 1944 Warsaw Uprising. It was formed, primarily of former officers of the Polish Army, in late 1939, soon after the start of the German occupation of Poland.

Due to the ŻZW&#x27;s close ties with the Armia Krajowa (AK), which was closely linked to the Polish Government in Exile, after the war the Soviet-dependent People&#x27;s Republic of Poland suppressed publication of books and articles on ŻZW. Its role in the uprising in the ghetto was downplayed, in favour of the larger, more socialist Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa (&quot;Jewish Fighting Organization&quot;).

==History==

===Formation===

The ŻZW was formed some time in November 1939, immediately after the German and Soviet conquest of Poland. Among its founding members may have been Dawid Mordechaj Apfelbaum (whom scholars now regard as a fictional persona), a pre-war Lieutenant of the Polish Army, who proposed to his former superior, Captain Henryk Iwański, the formation of a Jewish en cadre resistance as an integral part of the general Polish resistance being formed at that time. At the end of December such an organization was indeed formed and received the name of Żydowski Związek Walki. On January 30, 1940, its existence was approved by General Władysław Sikorski, the Polish commander in chief and the prime minister of the Polish Government in Exile.

Initially consisting of only 39 men, each armed only with a Polish Vis 9 mm semi-automatic pistol, with time it had grown to become one of the most numerous and most notable Jewish resistance organizations in Poland. Between 1940 and 1942 additional cells were formed in most major towns of Poland, including the most notable groups in Lublin, Lwów and Stanisławów. Although initially formed entirely by professional soldiers, with time it also included members of pre-war right wing Jewish-Polish parties such as Betar (among them Perec Lasker, Lowa Swerin, Paweł Frenkiel, Merediks, Langleben and Rosenfeld), Hatzohar (Joel Białobrow, Dawid Wdowiński) (Political Chair), and the Revisionist faction of the Polish Zionist Party (Leon Rodal and Meir Klingbeil).

The ŻZW was formed in close ties with Iwański&#x27;s organization and initially focused primarily on acquisition of arms and preparation of a large-scale operation in which all of its members could escape to Hungary, from where they wanted to flee to join the Polish Armed Forces in the West. With time however it was decided that the members stay in occupied Poland to help organize the struggle against the occupiers. In the later period the ŻZW focused on acquisition of arms for the future struggle as well as on helping the Jews to escape the ghettos, created in almost every town in German-held Poland. Thanks to the close ties with the Związek Walki Zbrojnej and then the AK (mainly through Iwański&#x27;s Security Corps, the Polish underground police force), the ŻZW received a large number of guns and armaments, as well as training of their members by professional officers. Those resistance organizations also provided help with weapons and ammunition acquisition, as well as with organizing the escapes.

Although the ŻZW was active in a number of towns in Poland, its major headquarters remained in Warsaw. When most of the Jewish inhabitants were forced into the Warsaw Ghetto, the ŻZW remained in contact with the outside world through Iwański and a number of other officers on the &quot;Aryan side&quot;. By the summer of 1942, the League had 320 well-armed members in Warsaw alone. During the first large deportation from the Warsaw Ghetto, the ŻZW received the news of the German plans and managed to hide most of its members in bunkers, which resulted in fewer than 20 of them being arrested by the Germans. Although Dawid Mordechaj Apfelbaum could not convince Adam Czerniaków to start an armed uprising against the Germans during the deportation, the organization managed to preserve most of its members - and assets. It also started to train more members and by January 1943 it already had roughly 500 men at arms in Warsaw alone. In addition, the &quot;technological department&quot; of the ŻZW, together with Captain Cezary Ketling&#x27;s group of the PLAN resistance organization managed to dig two secret tunnels under the walls of the ghetto, providing contact with the outside and allowing smuggling of arms into the ghetto.

===Structure===
The military leader of the ŻZW at the time of the uprising was Dr. Paweł Frenkiel, and its political leader (Zionist Revisionist), Dr. David Wdowiński. The organization was divided onto groups of five soldiers. Three groups formed a unit, four units formed a platoon and four platoons - a company, composed of roughly 240 men. In early January 1943 the ŻZW had two entirely manned and fully armed companies and two additional &quot;en cadre&quot; companies, to be manned by newly arrived volunteers when need arises. This indeed happened in April 1943, though the actual number of ŻZW soldiers to take part in the Uprising is a matter of debate. Apart from the fighting groups, the ŻZW was organized into several departments.

# Political Chair, Dawid Wdowiński
# Information Department, directed by Leon Rodal;
# Organization Department, directed by Paweł Frenkel;
# Supply Department (&quot;Kwatermistrzowski&quot;), directed by Leon Wajnsztok;
# Finances Department, without a director;
# Communication Department (contacts with Armia Krajowa mainly), directed by Dawid Apfelbaum;
# Medical Department led by dr Józef Celmajster (under pseudonym &quot;Niemirski&quot;);
# Juridical Department under Dawid Szulman;
# Rescue (&quot;Ratowanie&quot;) Department (transporting Jewish children and others outside the ghetto), under Kalma Mendelson;
# Department of Technology, Transport and Supplies (which, among other things, built two tunnels under the Ghetto walls) led by Hanoch Federbusz;
# Military Department under Paweł Frenkel and Dawid Apfelbaum.

==Warsaw Ghetto Uprising==

During the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising ŻZW is said to have had about 400 well-armed fighters grouped in 11 units. ŻZW fought together with AK fighters in Muranowska Street (4 units under Frenkel). Dawid M. Apfelbaum took position in Miła Street. Heniek Federbusz group organized a strong pocket of resistance in a house near Zamenhoff Street. Jan Pika unit took position in Miła Street, while unit of Leizer Staniewicz fought in the Nalewki, Gęsia Street and Franciszkańska street. Dawid Berliński&#x27;s group took position in second part of Nalewki. Roman Winsztok commanded group near Muranowska, where also the headquarters of the Union was located (Muranowska 7/9 Street).

===After the war===
Already during the war the influence and the importance of the Żydowski Związek Wojskowy was being downgraded. The surviving commanders of the leftist ŻOB either did not mention the ŻZW&#x27;s fight in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in their writings at all, or belittled its importance. Also the war-time Soviet propaganda did only briefly mention the fighters as they collided with its aims of presenting the Soviet Union as the only defender of the European Jewry. In addition, except for Dawid Wdowiński none of the high-ranking commanders of the ŻZW survived the war to tell their part of the story and it was not until 1963 that Wdowiński&#x27;s memoirs were published.

This led to a number of myths concerning both the ŻZW and the Uprising being commonly repeated in many modern publications. This was even strengthened by the post-war propaganda of the Polish communists, who openly underlined the value of the leftist Żydowska Organizacja Bojowa, while suppressing all publications on the Armia Krajowa-backed ŻZW.

The &quot;Contact&quot; ring used as a sign between the ŻZW and the Armia Krajowa is displayed in Yad Vashem. A means of identification, used in particular during meetings of higher level officers, were two identical gold rings set with a red stone engraved with Jewish symbols. It was not enough for the contacts to show the ring, they were expected to explain the significance of the symbols.

The ring that was in the possession of the Jewish underground fighters, was destroyed in the ruins of the Ghetto. Its twin remained in the hands of Henryk Iwanski, the Polish underground fighter and later was brought to the museum in Jerusalem, Israel.

==Doubts about veracity of some accounts==
In recent years, new research has been published on the ŻZW which has called into question the validity of some accounts, especially by Henryk Iwanski, which had influenced Maciej Kledzik, Marian Apfelbaum, Stefan Bratkowski and Moshe Arens and uncritically transmitted by many of those who wrote about the revolt and which later found their way into many secondary sources. The research of a Polish-Israeli team, for example, has raised many doubts around the veracity of testimony and memoirs by Henryk Iwański, Kalman Mendelson, Tadeusz Bednarczyk, Jack Eisner, David J. Landau, Maurice Shainberg, Joseph Greenblatt and a number of others. Moreover, they have suggested that Dawid Moryc Apfelbaum may actually have been an entirely fictitious figure and that the contact ring, the most emblematic relic of the Revisionist group, is in all likelihood a forgery. Dariusz Libionka and Laurence Weinbaum suggested the manipulations of the Communist secret police as the source of the alleged distortions. &quot;[...] it should be emphasized that deconstructing the story of Apfelbaum and his purported Polish patrons in no way detracts from the heroism of the ŻZW. Just the contrary. To be sure, the ŻZW fought heroically and played a major role in the revolt. Unfortunately, after the uprising was put down, the ŻZW was sentenced to drown in the waters of Lethe.&quot;

<doc id="907089" wikidata="Q535161" url="?curid=907089" title="José María Córdova International Airport">
<text>José María Córdova International Airport is an international airport located in the city of Rionegro, south-east of Medellín, and is the second largest airport in Colombia after El Dorado International Airport of Bogotá in terms of infrastructure and passenger service. The airport is named after José María Córdova (sometimes spelled &quot;Córdoba&quot;), a Colombian army general who was a native of Ríonegro.

It serves the Medellin Metropolitan Area and is the most important airport in the Antioquia Department. It was also the main hub for low-cost airline Viva Air Colombia until the airline ceased operating in February of 2023. It serves several international destinations, one of the busiest being the route to Miami International Airport. It also serves the most flown route within Colombia: Medellin-Bogota, which is mainly operated by Avianca and LATAM Colombia. 

Freight transport is also one of the strengths of the terminal, providing air transportation to most of the flower exports (and other products) from Antioquia bound to the Americas and Europe.

== Description ==

The airport serves all major international and some minor domestic routes for the Medellín metro area, in contrast to the in-town, yet much smaller Olaya Herrera Airport, which serves the Medellín area with domestic flights only. The airport is about a 30 minute drive from the proper city of Medellín.

The runway is also used by the nearby military base of the Colombian Air Force located in Rionegro, named Air Combat Command No. 5 (CACOM 5), where all types of military and national police aircraft arrive and depart.

The airport has air navigation aids such as VOR, NDB, and ILS, which makes navigation and landings safer in bad weather.

Antioquia&#x27;s exports, mostly flowers and other products from the region, depart en route to international destinations from these terminals. The cargo operator Avianca Cargo has its main base at the airport, and operates flights to countries in South, Central and North America.

The airport was built with a dome shaped roof and has two stories. The airport has 17 gates: 10 domestic and 7 international, with four gates being of mixed use. It has many restaurants and shops, including a duty-free shop after clearing security. There are also banks, money exchange, and car rental services. Avianca has a VIP room, and there are also several VIP lounges operated by Global Lounge Network. Outside the main building is a parking lot and garage, which includes an area for motorcycles.

== History ==

In the 1970s, the need for a larger airport for the Antioquia province arose due to the limitations of the Olaya Herrera Airport caused by insufficient space to expand. Two sites were proposed for the new airport: one in the vicinity of the municipality of Barbosa northeast of the city, and another in the valley of San Nicolas in Rionegro, east of the city. The latter was selected and construction began.

The airport opened on August 29, 1985. During the same year, Avianca conducted test flights of its Boeing 747, first on the original runway at Olaya Herrera Airport, and then at the new José María Córdova. During this time the airport had significant movement of cargo and passengers, as the Olaya Herrera airport was closed from 1986 until 1991. Today, the Olaya Herrera Airport still has significant passenger movements, because it is a main hub for domestic flights within Colombia and the preferred option for domestic flights out of Medellin.

In January 2006, an Airbus A380 landed at the airport to conduct technical tests of the engines. This was the first time a plane of that type had landed on Colombian soil, and also the first time it happened in South America.

In 2016, the airport handled 7,376,160 passengers, and 6,892,104 in 2017.

In August 2019, a new highway opened, which cut the traveling time from the airport to Medellín from almost an hour to just 20 minutes. The route includes a tunnel called &quot;Tunel de Oriente&quot;. The total cost of the project was 1.1 trillion pesos.

== Renovation and expansion ==
The airport underwent an expansion and renovation that enlarged the domestic terminal from to and added five new gates to it, along with three new gates for the international terminal. The expansion increased the passenger handling capacity to 11 million annually. Other improvements included more food and shopping options, more digital displays with flight information, more car rental options, better airport connectivity with the parking lot, better airport connectivity to the parking garage, and the addition of a duty-free shop. The total cost of the works was 350 , and were completed in December 2017.

The cargo terminal expansion was completed in February 2020 at a cost of around $110 million pesos. The terminal went from to .

== Accidents and incidents ==

* On May 19, 1993, SAM Colombia Flight 501 crashed into Mt. Paramo Frontino while making an approach to the airport. The crash killed all 132 people on board, and this way the worst accident of the year 1993. 
* On December 21, 1996, an Antonov An-32B aircraft (registration HK-4008X) operated by SELVA Colombia crashed while on final approach to runway 36. The aircraft had taken off from Bogota for its usual cargo flight to José María Córdova Airport with 6 tons of cargo. During the approach phase, the plane veered three miles to the left of the glide slope, then turned sharply right, finally crashing more than five miles from the south end of the airport. The crash killed all four occupants of the aircraft.
* On December 22, 1998, an Antonov An-32B aircraft (registration HK-3930X) crashed while approaching the runway. The aircraft had taken off from Bogota for a cargo flight to the airport. The accident occurred at dawn and weather conditions were very bad due to the dense fog that was present in the area. The accident killed all five occupants of the aircraft. A similar incident had occurred two years earlier, with a plane of the same company in similar circumstances.
* On October 15, 2004, a Douglas DC-3 (registration HK-1503) belonging to the company Aerovanguardia took off from La Vanguardia Airport in Villavicencio for a cargo flight to the airport. Shortly after takeoff, ATC informed the pilots that the airport was closed due to poor visibility caused by fog. The pilot decided to fly to the alternate Olaya Herrera Airport, but the aircraft collided with power cables during descent, crashing in a wooded area near the town of Santa Elena, west of Rionegro, and killing all three occupants of the aircraft.
* On June 7, 2006, a Tradewinds Airlines Boeing 747-200F (registration N922FT) had an engine failure on takeoff. The pilot aborted the takeoff but the plane overran the runway by 150m. None of the six on board was injured, but the plane was substantially damaged, with the nose gear being completely sheared off.
* On January 3, 2009, American Airlines Flight 924, a Boeing 737-800, took off from Jose Maria Cordova Airport and had to make an emergency landing due to fire in one of its engines. Upon landing, the pilot was forced to use maximum braking, causing the brakes to overheat and one of the tires to explode. The airport was closed for four hours, but none of the 148 passengers on board were injured in the crash.
* On November 28, 2016, LaMia Airlines Flight 2933, a Avro RJ85, crashed on its approach to the airport. The plane was carrying members of the Chapecoense football team who were on their way to compete in the 2016 Copa Sudamericana finals. There were 71 fatalities and six survivors in the accident.

<text>In Norse mythology, Hringhorni (Old Norse &quot;ship with a circle on the stem&quot;) is the name of the ship of the god Baldr, described as the &quot;greatest of all ships&quot;. 

==Mythology==
According to &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;, following the murder of Baldr by Loki, the other gods brought his body down to the sea and laid him to rest on the ship. They would have launched it out into the water and kindled a funeral pyre for Baldr but were unable to move the great vessel without the help of the giantess Hyrrokkin, who was sent for out of Jötunheim. She then flung the ship so violently down the rollers at the first push that flames appeared and the earth trembled, much to the annoyance of Thor.

Along with Baldr, his wife Nanna was also borne to the funeral pyre after she had died of grief. As Thor was consecrating the fire with his hammer Mjolnir, a dwarf named Litr began cavorting at his feet. Thor then kicked him into the flames and the dwarf was burned up as well. The significance of this seemingly incidental event is speculative but may perhaps find a parallel in religious ritual. Among other artifacts and creatures sacrificed on the pyre of &quot;Hringhorni&quot; were Odin&#x27;s gold ring Draupnir and the horse of Baldr with all its trappings.

<doc id="907108" wikidata="Q645813" url="?curid=907108" title="Alfvén wave">
<text>In plasma physics, an Alfvén wave, named after Hannes Alfvén, is a type of plasma wave in which ions oscillate in response to a restoring force provided by an effective tension on the magnetic field lines.

==Definition==
An Alfvén wave is a low-frequency (compared to the ion gyrofrequency) travelling oscillation of the ions and magnetic field in a plasma. The ion mass density provides the inertia and the magnetic field line tension provides the restoring force. Alfvén waves propagate in the direction of the magnetic field, and the motion of the ions and the perturbation of the magnetic field are transverse to the direction of propagation. However, Alfvén waves existing at oblique incidences will smoothly change into magnetosonic waves when the propagation is perpendicular to the magnetic field.

Alfvén waves are dispersionless.

==Alfvén velocity==
The low-frequency relative permittivity formula_1 of a magnetized plasma is given by
formula_2
where is the magnetic flux density, formula_3 is the speed of light, formula_4 is the permeability of the vacuum, and the mass density is the sum
formula_5
over all species of charged plasma particles (electrons as well as all types of ions).
Here species formula_6 has number density formula_7
and mass per particle formula_8.

The phase velocity of an electromagnetic wave in such a medium is
formula_9
For the case of an Alfvén wave
formula_10
where
formula_11
is the Alfvén wave group velocity.
(The formula for the phase velocity assumes that the plasma particles are moving at non-relativistic speeds, the mass-weighted particle velocity is zero in the frame of reference, and the wave is propagating parallel to the magnetic field vector.)

If formula_12, then formula_13. On the other hand, when formula_14, formula_15. That is, at high field or low density, the group velocity of the Alfvén wave approaches the speed of light, and the Alfvén wave becomes an ordinary electromagnetic wave.

Neglecting the contribution of the electrons to the mass density, formula_16, where formula_17 is the ion number density and formula_18 is the mean ion mass per particle, so that
formula_19

==Alfvén time==
In plasma physics, the Alfvén time formula_20 is an important timescale for wave phenomena. It is related to the Alfvén velocity by:
formula_21
where formula_22 denotes the characteristic scale of the system. For example, formula_22 could be the minor radius of the torus in a tokamak.

==Relativistic case==
The Alfvén wave velocity in relativistic magnetohydrodynamics is
formula_24
where is the total energy density of plasma particles, formula_25 is the total plasma pressure, and
formula_26
is the magnetic pressure. In the non-relativistic limit, where formula_27, this formula reduces to the one given previously.

==History==
=== The coronal heating problem ===

The study of Alfvén waves began from the coronal heating problem, a longstanding question in heliophysics. It was unclear why the temperature of the solar corona is hot (about one million kelvins) compared to its surface (the photosphere), which is only a few thousand kelvins. Intuitively, it would make sense to see a decrease in temperature when moving away from a heat source, but this does not seem to be the case even though the photosphere is denser and would generate more heat than the corona.

In 1942, Hannes Alfvén proposed in &quot;Nature&quot; the existence of an electromagnetic-hydrodynamic wave which would carry energy from the photosphere to heat up the corona and the solar wind. He claimed that the sun had all the necessary criteria to support these waves and they may in turn be responsible for sun spots. He stated:

If a conducting liquid is placed in a constant magnetic field, every motion of the liquid gives rise to an E.M.F. which produces electric currents. Owing to the magnetic field, these currents give mechanical forces which change the state of motion of the liquid. Thus a kind of combined electromagnetic–hydrodynamic wave is produced.

This would eventually turn out to be Alfvén waves. He received the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physics for this discovery.

=== Experimental studies and observations ===
The convection zone of the Sun, the region beneath the photosphere in which energy is transported primarily by convection, is sensitive to the motion of the core due to the rotation of the Sun. Together with varying pressure gradients beneath the surface, electromagnetic fluctuations produced in the convection zone induce random motion on the photospheric surface and produce Alfvén waves. The waves then leave the surface, travel through the chromosphere and transition zone, and interact with the ionized plasma. The wave itself carries energy and some of the electrically charged plasma.

In the early 1990s, de Pontieu and Haerendel suggested that Alfvén waves may also be associated with the plasma jets known as spicules. It was theorized these brief spurts of superheated gas were carried by the combined energy and momentum of their own upward velocity, as well as the oscillating transverse motion of the Alfvén waves.

In 2007, Alfvén waves were reportedly observed for the first time traveling towards the corona by Tomczyk &quot;et al&quot;., but their predictions could not conclude that the energy carried by the Alfvén waves was sufficient to heat the corona to its enormous temperatures, for the observed amplitudes of the waves were not high enough. However, in 2011, McIntosh &quot;et al&quot;. reported the observation of highly energetic Alfvén waves combined with energetic spicules which could sustain heating the corona to its million-kelvin temperature. These observed amplitudes (20.0 km/s against 2007&#x27;s observed 0.5 km/s) contained over one hundred times more energy than the ones observed in 2007. The short period of the waves also allowed more energy transfer into the coronal atmosphere. The 50,000 km-long spicules may also play a part in accelerating the solar wind past the corona. Alfvén waves are routinely observed in solar wind, in particular in fast solar wind streams. The role of Alfvénic oscillations in the interaction between fast solar wind and the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere is currently under debate.

However, the above-mentioned discoveries of Alfvén waves in the complex Sun&#x27;s atmosphere, starting from the Hinode era in 2007 for the next 10 years, mostly fall in the realm of Alfvénic waves essentially generated as a mixed mode due to transverse structuring of the magnetic and plasma properties in the localized flux tubes. In 2009, Jess &quot;et al&quot;. reported the periodic variation of H-alpha line-width as observed by Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) above chromospheric bright-points. They claimed first direct detection of the long-period (126–700 s), incompressible, torsional Alfvén waves in the lower solar atmosphere.

After the seminal work of Jess &quot;et al&quot;. (2009), in 2017 Srivastava &quot;et al&quot;. detected the existence of high-frequency torsional Alfvén waves in the Sun&#x27;s chromospheric fine-structured flux tubes. They discovered that these high-frequency waves carry substantial energy capable of heating the Sun&#x27;s corona and also originating the supersonic solar wind. In 2018, using spectral imaging observations, non-LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium) inversions and magnetic field extrapolations of sunspot atmospheres, Grant et al. found evidence for elliptically polarized Alfvén waves forming fast-mode shocks in the outer regions of the chromospheric umbral atmosphere. They provided quantification of the degree of physical heat provided by the dissipation of such Alfvén wave modes above active region spots.

In 2024, a paper was published in the journal &quot;Science&quot; detailing a set of observations of what turned out to be the same jet of solar wind made by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter in February 2022, and implying Alfvén waves were what kept the jet&#x27;s energy high enough to match the observations.

*2024: Alfvén waves are implied to be behind a smaller than expected energy loss in solar wind jets out as far as Venus&#x27; orbit, based on Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter observations only two days apart.

<doc id="907114" wikidata="Q13638761" url="?curid=907114" title="Jack Holt (dinghy designer)">
<text>Jack Holt, [[OBE]] (8 April 1912 – 14 November 1995) was a prolific designer of sailing dinghies. His pioneering designs of dinghies using plywood did much to popularise the sport of sailing in the period immediately following World War II.

Born near the River Thames in Hammersmith, London, Holt designed more than 40 boats, many of which are listed below. He worked for many years with fellow sailing enthusiast and businessman Beecher Moore.

Jack Holt was awarded an OBE in 1979 for his services to sailing.

==Sailing Clubs==

Jack Holt has been associated with several sailing clubs. His premises were next door to Ranelagh Sailing Club, and he designed the Merlin Rocket and his National 12 designs there.

In 1956, he was a co-founder of Wraysbury Lake Sailing Club.

He was closely associated with the London Corinthian Sailing Club, very close to his Putney premises.

A selection of Jack Holt plans are held in the archives of the National Maritime Museum Cornwall.
==Boatbuilding==

In addition to designing boats, Jack was also a boatbuilder. His fittings business was in the loft above the boatbuilding workshop. Naturally he built all the boats he designed, but he also built boats designed by others, including the Albacore.

==Sailing fittings==

Jack collaborated with Glen and Tony Allen from Essex to manufacture and supply a lightweight range of dinghy fittings, the fittings were known as &quot;Holt Allen&quot; fittings for 52 years until 2008 when the Allen side decided to distribute the fittings themselves under the brand &quot;Allen&quot;. The companies now trade separately as Holt Marine Ltd. and Allen Brothers (Fittings) Ltd. Holt Allen also made masts and spars for dinghies and a wide variety of other boat related fittings. Most of the fittings for the Mirror, Miracle, Mirror 14, Mirror 16 and Streaker were all provided by Holt Allen

==Sailmaker==
Sails for early Puffins, those with a puffin silhouette on the main, were deep blue in colour and were made by Jack Holt Sails of Putney, England. Holt sails made sails for a large number of dinghy classes for many years from the 1970s to around the early 2000s

<text>Henry Treece (22 December 1911 – 10 June 1966) was a British poet and writer who also worked as a teacher and editor. He wrote a range of works but is mostly remembered as a writer of children&#x27;s historical novels.

==Life and work==
Treece was born in Wednesbury, Staffordshire, and educated at the town&#x27;s grammar school. After graduating from the University of Birmingham in 1933, he went into teaching with his first placement being at Tynemouth School. In 1939 he married Mary Woodman and settled in Lincolnshire as a teacher at Barton-upon-Humber Grammar School. Their son, Richard Treece, became a musician with Help Yourself and other rock bands.

He published five volumes of poetry: &quot;38 Poems&quot; (London: Fortune Press, 1940), then by Faber &amp; Faber; &quot;Invitation and Warning&quot; 1942; &quot;The Black Seasons&quot; 1945; &quot;The Haunted Garden&quot; 1947; and &quot;The Exiles&quot; 1952. He appeared in the 1949 &quot;The New British Poets: an anthology&quot; edited by Kenneth Rexroth; but from 1952 with &quot;The Dark Island&quot; he devoted himself to fiction. His best known are his juvenile historical novels, particularly those set in the Viking Age, although he also wrote some adult historical novels. Many of his novels are set in transitional periods in history, where more primitive societies are forced to face modernisation, e.g. the end of the Viking period, or the Roman conquest of Britain. His play &quot;Carnival King&quot; (Faber &amp; Faber) was produced at Nottingham Playhouse in 1953. He also worked as a radio broadcaster.

In World War II he served as an intelligence officer in the RAF and helped John Pudney edit &quot;Air Force Poetry&quot;.

Other poetry anthologies he was involved with include &quot;The New Apocalypse&quot; (1939) with J. F. Hendry giving its name to the New Apocalyptics movement; two further anthologies with Hendry followed. He wrote a critical study of Dylan Thomas, called &quot;Dylan Thomas – Dog among the fairies&quot;, published by Lindsay Drummond, London, in 1949. He and Thomas became estranged over Thomas&#x27;s refusal to sign up as a New Apocalyptic.

He also wrote &quot;Conquerors&quot; in 1932, as a way to reflect on the horrors of war.

He edited issues of the magazines &quot;Transformation&quot;, and &quot;A New Romantic Anthology&quot; (1949) with Stefan Schimanski, issues of &quot;Kingdom Come: The Magazine of War-Time Oxford&quot; with Schimanski and Alan Rook, as well as &quot;War-Time Harvest&quot;. &quot;How I See Apocalypse&quot; (London, Lindsay Drummond, 1946) was a retrospective statement. Treece died from a heart attack in 1966.

Treece&#x27;s residency in Barton-upon-Humber is recorded by a blue plaque on East Acridge House, erected by the Civic Society in 2010.

<text>Flagstone (flag) is a generic flat stone, sometimes cut in regular rectangular or square shape and usually used for paving slabs or walkways, patios, flooring, fences and roofing. It may be used for memorials, headstones, facades and other construction. The name derives from Middle English &quot;flagge&quot; meaning &quot;turf&quot;, perhaps from Old Norse &quot;flaga&quot; meaning &quot;slab&quot; or &quot;chip&quot;.
Flagstone is a sedimentary rock that is split into layers along bedding planes. Flagstone is usually a form of a sandstone composed of feldspar and quartz and is arenaceous in grain size (0.16 mm – 2 mm in diameter). The material that binds flagstone is usually composed of silica, calcite, or iron oxide. The rock color usually comes from these cementing materials. Typical flagstone colors are red, blue, and buff, though exotic colors exist.

Flagstone is quarried in places with bedded sedimentary rocks with fissile bedding planes.
Around the thirteenth century, the ceilings, walls and floors in European architecture became more ornate. Anglo-Saxons in particular used flagstones as flooring materials in the interior rooms of castles and other structures. Lindisfarne Castle in England and Muchalls Castle (14th century) in Scotland are among many examples of buildings with surviving flagstone floors.

Flagstone shingles are a traditional roofing material, and are a type of roof shingle commonly used in the Alps, where they are laid dry – often held in place with pegs or hooks. In the Aosta Valley, Italy, buildings in historical areas are required to be covered in stone shingles.

<doc id="907132" wikidata="Q1151402" url="?curid=907132" title="D. E. Shaw &amp; Co.">
<text>D. E. Shaw &amp; Co., L.P. is a multinational investment management firm founded in 1988 by David E. Shaw and based in New York City. The company is known for developing complicated mathematical models and computer programs to exploit anomalies in financial markets. , D. E. Shaw has $70billion in assets under management, including alternative investments and long strategies.

== History ==
===1988–1996: Founding and early years===
The company was founded by David E. Shaw, a former Columbia University computer science professor with a PhD from Stanford University. D. E. Shaw began investing in June 1989, having secured $28 million in capital from Donald Sussman&#x27;s Paloma Partners and several private investors. The company carefully protected its proprietary trading algorithms. Many of its early employees were scientists, mathematicians, and computer programmers. 

In 1994, the company&#x27;s net return was 26 percent. It managed several hundred million dollars in &quot;market-neutral strategies, including statistical arbitrage, Japanese warrant arbitrage, convertible-bond arbitrage and fixed-income trading.&quot; Its non-hedge fund activities in the mid-90s included setting up a broker-dealer subsidiary, founding the email provider Juno Online Services, launching an online banking and brokerage firm, and opening an office in India focused on developing software and systems to support the company&#x27;s trading operations and online businesses.

===1997: Strategic alliance with Bank of America===
In 1997, the firm returned capital to most of its early investors in favor of a structured credit facility of nearly $2 billion from Bank of America, with terms that allowed D. E. Shaw &amp; Co. to keep a higher fraction of profits than hedge fund investors normally allow. In effect, Bank of America provided an infusion of $1.4 billion to D. E. Shaw, hoping to benefit from the latter&#x27;s investment expertise. One year later, Russia defaulted on its debt, resulting in large losses for D. E. Shaw&#x27;s fixed-income portfolio. As a result, Bank of America lost $570 million due to its investment in D. E. Shaw, and paid out an additional $490 million to settle associated shareholder lawsuits.

Following the collapse of this alliance, D. E. Shaw laid off employees, reducing its workforce from 540 employees in 1999 to 180. The company&#x27;s capital shrank from $1.7 billion to $460 million.

===2002: Management transfer===
David E. Shaw directed the company from 1988 to 2001. In 2002, he removed himself from day-to-day involvement in order to focus on D. E. Shaw Research and transitioned leadership of day-to-day activities to a team of six of the firm&#x27;s senior managing directors. The same six-member Executive Committee of Anne Dinning, Julius Gaudio, Louis Salkind, Stuart Steckler, Max Stone, and Eric Wepsic remained intact until 2012 when Steckler retired.

===2007: Financial crisis===
At the beginning of the financial crisis in August 2007, D. E. Shaw&#x27;s multi-strategy fund had assets of $20 billion. A third of the fund&#x27;s exposure was to the equity markets and equity-linked quantitative strategies. As a result, the fund lost five percent of its assets and had its worst-performing month to that point in time. By September 2008, the company&#x27;s capital was four times leveraged. In the final months of 2008, gains on its then $15 billion multi-strategy funds were lost.

Twenty percent of the company&#x27;s assets under management were in its credit strategies and were the hardest hit during the financial crisis.

To avoid further loss of portfolio value and asset fire sales, D. E. Shaw temporarily halted withdrawal of funds. By 2009, D. E. Shaw had returned about $2 billion at clients&#x27; requests. One year later, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that investors estimated the company had honored an additional $7 billion in client redemption requests.

D. E. Shaw&#x27;s total assets under management fell from a high of $34 billion in 2007 to $21 billion in 2010. The company had 1,300 employees, a reduction of 10% of its workforce.

=== 2019: Non-compete agreements ===
In September 2019, D. E. Shaw required all of its employees to sign non-compete agreements, which was common among asset management companies but not previously required at the firm. This was not received favorably by some employees.

=== 2023 ===
In 2023, D. E. Shaw was charged with a penalty of $10 million by the SEC for having its employees sign confidentiality disclosure agreements from 2011-2023, without including whistleblowing rights.

== Investment strategy ==
The company manages a variety of investment funds that make extensive use of quantitative methods and proprietary computational technology to support fundamental research. The company also uses qualitative analysis to make private equity investments in technology, wind power, real estate, financial services firms, and distressed company financing. D. E. Shaw &amp; Co. has also provided private equity capital to technology-related business ventures. Examples include Juno Online Services, an Internet access provider, and Farsight, an online financial services platform that was acquired by Merrill Lynch.

===Assets under management===
The company had $40 billion in aggregate capital and $15.6 billion in hedge fund AUM as of 2011. As of June 1, 2021, the company more than tripled in size with $55 billion in AUM, $35 billion of which are alternative investments and the remaining $20 billion long investments. It was ranked as the 21st-largest hedge fund by &quot;Institutional Investor&quot; in 2011. By 2020, D. E. Shaw &amp; Co. was ranked as the 10th-largest hedge fund globally by discretionary AUM.

===Private equity===
==== U.S. ====
In 2004, a subsidiary of one of the company&#x27;s funds acquired the toy store FAO Schwarz after it had filed for bankruptcy. FAO Schwarz reopened for business in New York and Las Vegas in the fall of 2004. In the same year, D. E. Shaw affiliate Laminar Portfolios acquired the online assets of KB Toys, which continued operating as eToys.com.

In 2006, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported the firm&#x27;s involvement as a potential financing and investment partner for Penn National Gaming (the casino and racetrack company) as an example of the breadth of Wall Street firms&#x27; involvement in the &quot;private equity boom,&quot; describing D. E. Shaw as &quot;a hedge fund group.&quot; The financing was required as Penn National Gaming had a market value of $3.3 billion (2006) and $1.4 billion in annual revenues and wanted to acquire Harrah&#x27;s Entertainment, a company with a market value of $14.7 billion (2006) and at that time the largest US casino operator.

In late 2009, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that D. E. Shaw &amp; Co. had set up a portfolio acquisitions unit, the aim of which was to acquire illiquid assets from rival hedge funds, during the financial crisis.

==== India ====
D. E. Shaw entered the Indian market in 2006, with Anil Chawla then the CEO of GE-Commercial finance, India &amp; South East Asia, as the Country Manager. The India operations were initially headquartered in Hyderabad, Telangana. D. E. Shaw entered into several large private equity deals in the country. This included a joint-venture with India&#x27;s largest private sector company, Reliance Industries, to provide financial services. Other investments included real estate company DLF Assets Limited and publishing group Amar Ujala Publications, which were subject to Indian regulatory scrutiny and legal disputes. Chawla left his position with D. E. Shaw in 2012.

D. E. Shaw scaled back its private equity activities in India after 2013.
== Corporate structure ==
=== Management ===
Currently, the Executive Committee comprises Anne Dinning, Max Stone, Eric Wepsic, Eddie Fishman, Alexis Halaby, and Edwin Jager. The firm has 2,500 employees.

===Ownership===
In 2007, David Shaw sold a 20 percent stake to Lehman Brothers as part of a broader strategy to diversify his personal holdings; D. E. Shaw had $30 billion of assets under management in 2007. At the time of its bankruptcy in September 2008, Lehman Brothers&#x27; holdings in D. E. Shaw &amp; Co. remained intact.

In 2015, Hillspire, the family office of Google chairman Eric Schmidt, acquired the 20 percent passive ownership stake in D. E. Shaw &amp; Co. from the bankruptcy estate of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.

== Corporate affairs ==
===Corporate responsibility===
D. E. Shaw supports educational programs such as the American Regions Mathematics League, United States of America Mathematical Olympiad, the International Mathematical Olympiad, Mathematical Olympiad Program, and The Center for Excellence in Education.

===Office locations===
The firm has offices in the United States, India, China, Singapore, England, Luxembourg, and Bermuda. 
== Defamation lawsuit ==
In 2022, D. E. Shaw was ordered to pay $52 million to a former employee after a defamation lawsuit.

<text>GE MDS (formerly Microwave Data Systems, Inc., MDS) is an American company that designs, manufactures, and sells wireless communications equipment for the industrial market.

==History==
Microwave Data Systems (MDS) was originally part of California Microwave (CalMic). As California Microwave consolidated and sold off businesses, CalMic changed its name to Adaptive Broadband. Both California Microwave and Adaptive Broadband were public companies. MDS was sold to Moseley Associates and operated as a private company for some time. General Electric&#x27;s Multilin division inside GE Consumer and Industrial purchased Microwave Data Systems in 2007 and changed the official business name to &quot;GE MDS, LLC.&quot; GE MDS has operated under the following GE Divisions / Operating Units: GE Consumer and Industrial, GE Industrial, GE Enterprise Solutions, GE Digital Energy, GE Metering and Sensing, GE Energy Management, GE Grid Solutions, GE Automation &amp; Controls, GE Renewable Energy, and GE Grid Solutions (again).

Currently GE MDS operates as a business unit inside GE Renewable Energy / GE Grid Solutions.

GE MDS is headquartered in Rochester, NY. All research and development and manufacturing is done in Rochester, NY (USA). MDS was a subsidiary of Moseley Associates and was acquired, in January 2007, by GE Multilin which was a division of General Electric. The company then became known as GE MDS, LLC. Prior to being a subsidiary of Moseley, Microwave Data Systems was a part of California Microwave.

GE MDS Products include point-to-point and point-to-multipoint radios that operate in the licensed and unlicensed (ISM band) frequency bands under 6GHz. The company is known particularly for long range communications, interference rejection, industrial quality, and high reliability. Customer applications are typically industrial and long range: electric power distribution, oil and gas wellhead monitoring, monitoring oil and gas pipeline transport, railroad locomotive and wayside communications, water/wastewater monitoring, etc.

<doc id="907139" wikidata="Q394317" url="?curid=907139" title="Agmatine">
<text>Agmatine, also known as 4-aminobutyl-guanidine, was discovered in 1910 by Albrecht Kossel. It is a chemical substance which is naturally created from the amino acid arginine. Agmatine has been shown to exert modulatory action at multiple molecular targets, notably: neurotransmitter systems, ion channels, nitric oxide (NO) synthesis, and polyamine metabolism and this provides bases for further research into potential applications.

==History==
The term agmatine stems from A- (for amino-) + g- (from guanidine) + -ma- (from ptomaine) + -in (German)/-ine (English) suffix with insertion of -t- apparently for euphony. A year after its discovery, it was found that agmatine could increase blood flow in rabbits; however, the physiological relevance of these findings were questioned given the high concentrations (high μM range) required. In the 1920s, researchers in the diabetes clinic of Oskar Minkowski showed that agmatine can exert mild hypoglycemic effects. In 1994, endogenous agmatine synthesis in mammals was discovered.

==Metabolic pathways==

Agmatine is a cationic amine formed by decarboxylation of L-arginine by the mitochondrial enzyme arginine decarboxylase (ADC). Agmatine degradation occurs mainly by hydrolysis, catalyzed by agmatinase into urea and putrescine, the diamine precursor of polyamine biosynthesis. An alternative pathway, mainly in peripheral tissues, is by diamine oxidase-catalyzed oxidation into agmatine-aldehyde, which is in turn converted by aldehyde dehydrogenase into guanidinobutyrate and secreted by the kidneys.

==Mechanisms of action==
Agmatine was found to exert modulatory actions directly and indirectly at multiple key molecular targets underlying cellular control mechanisms of cardinal importance in health and disease. It is considered capable of exerting its modulatory actions simultaneously at multiple targets. The following outline indicates the categories of control mechanisms, and identifies their molecular targets: 
* Neurotransmitter receptors and receptor ionophores. Nicotinic, imidazoline I1 and I2, α2-adrenergic, glutamate NMDAr, and serotonin 5-HT2A and 5HT-3 receptors.
* Ion channels. Including: ATP-sensitive K+ channels, voltage-gated Ca2+ channels, and acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs).
* Membrane transporters. Agmatine specific-selective uptake sites, organic cation transporters (mostly OCT2 subtype), extraneuronal monoamine transporters (ENT), polyamine transporters, and mitochondrial agmatine specific-selective transport system.
* Nitric oxide (NO) synthesis modulation. Both differential inhibition and activation of NO synthase (NOS) isoforms is reported.
* Polyamine metabolism. Agmatine is a precursor for polyamine synthesis, competitive inhibitor of polyamine transport, inducer of spermidine/spermine acetyltransferase (SSAT), and inducer of antizyme.
* Protein ADP-ribosylation. Inhibition of protein arginine ADP-ribosylation.
* Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs). Indirect down-regulation of the enzymes MMP 2 and 9.
* Advanced glycation end product (AGE) formation. Direct blockade of AGEs formation.
* NADPH oxidase. Activation of the enzyme leading to H2O2 production.

==Food consumption==
Agmatine sulfate injection can increase food intake with carbohydrate preference in satiated, but not hungry, rats and this effect may be mediated by neuropeptide Y. However, supplementation in rat drinking water results in slight reductions in water intake, body weight, and blood pressure. In addition, force feeding with agmatine leads to a reduction in body weight gain during rat development. It is also found that many fermented foods contain agmatine.

==Pharmacokinetics==
Agmatine is present in small amounts in plant-, animal-, and fish-derived foodstuff and gut microbial production is an added source for agmatine. Oral agmatine is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and readily distributed throughout the body. Rapid elimination from non-brain organs of ingested (un-metabolized) agmatine by the kidneys has indicated a blood half life of about 2 hours.

== Research ==
A number of potential medical uses for agmatine have been suggested.

=== Cardiovascular ===
Agmatine produces mild reductions in heart rate and blood pressure, apparently by activating both central and peripheral control systems via modulation of several of its molecular targets including: imidazoline receptors subtypes, norepinephrine release and NO production.

=== Glucose regulation ===
Agmatine hypoglycemic effects are the result of simultaneous modulation of several molecular mechanisms involved in blood glucose regulation.

=== Kidney functions ===
Agmatine has been shown to enhance glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and to exert nephroprotective effects.

=== Neurotransmission ===
Agmatine has been discussed as a putative neurotransmitter. It is synthesized in the brain, stored in synaptic vesicles, accumulated by uptake, released by membrane depolarization, and inactivated by agmatinase. Agmatine binds to α2-adrenergic receptor and imidazoline receptor binding sites, and blocks NMDA receptors and other cation ligand-gated channels. However, while agmatine binds to α2-adrenergic receptors, it exerts neither an agonistic nor antagonistic effect on these receptors, lacking any intrinsic activity. Short only of identifying specific (&quot;own&quot;) post-synaptic receptors, agmatine fulfills Henry Dale&#x27;s criteria for a neurotransmitter and is hence considered a neuromodulator and co-transmitter. The existence of theoretical agmatinergic-mediated neuronal systems has not yet been demonstrated although the existence of such receptors is implied by its prominence in the mediation of both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Research into agmatine-specific receptors and transmission pathways continues.

Due to its ability to pass through open cationic channels, agmatine has also been used as a surrogate metric of integrated ionic flux into neural tissue upon stimulation. When neural tissue is incubated in agmatine and an external stimulus is applied, only cells with open channels will be filled with agmatine, allowing identification of which cells are sensitive to that stimuli and the degree to which they opened their cationic channels during the stimulation period.

=== Opioid liability ===
Systemic agmatine can potentiate opioid analgesia, and prevent tolerance to chronic morphine in laboratory rodents. Since then, cumulative evidence amply shows that agmatine inhibits opioid dependence and relapse in several animal species.

<doc id="907140" wikidata="Q5303082" url="?curid=907140" title="Downdrift">
<text>In phonetics, downdrift (also known as &quot;automatic downstep&quot;) is the cumulative lowering of pitch in the course of a sentence due to interactions among tones in a tonal language. Downdrift often occurs when the tones in successive syllables are H L H (high, low, high) or H L L H (high, low, low, high). In this case the second high tone tends to be lower than the first. The effect can accumulate so that with each low tone, the pitch of the high tones becomes slightly lower, until the end of the intonational phrase, when the pitch is &quot;reset&quot;.

However, not every sequence of H L H leads to downdrift. In some languages, in some circumstances, the two high tones in a sequence H L H can be pronounced on the same level, with a &quot;plateau&quot; between them; that is, H L H changes to H H H. This occurs for example in Chichewa if the first H is a proclitic word, e.g. &quot;of&quot; + &quot;Malawi&quot; is pronounced &quot;of Malawi&quot;, with a plateau. In other languages, in some circumstances, even longer sequences such as H L L L H can become plateaux, for example, in Luganda, &#x27;it is in Buganda&#x27; is pronounced , with a plateau instead of downdrift.

Two basic types of downdrift are found. In one, called &quot;discrete downdrift&quot;, when downstep occurs all tones shift downward, so that their relative difference in pitch remains constant; in the other, called &quot;tone terracing&quot;, the pitch of the low tone remains at the lower end of the speaker&#x27;s vocal range, while the high tones shift downward, so that their difference in pitch narrows.

Pitch reset is required in the first instance because the tones approach the lower end of the speaker&#x27;s comfort range, and in the second because the tonal distinctions of the language start being lost.

<doc id="907147" wikidata="Q2631696" url="?curid=907147" title="Pitch (climbing)">
<text>In climbing, a pitch is a section of a climbing route between two belay points (or belay stations), and is most commonly related to the task of lead climbing (going up), but is also related to abseiling (going down). Climbing on routes that require only one pitch is known as single-pitch climbing, and climbing on routes with more than one pitch is known as multi-pitch climbing (where the number is large, it can be big wall or alpine climbing). 

Modern climbing ropes are typically in length, which sets the theoretical maximum length of a &#x27;pitch&#x27;, however, other factors mean that the average pitch on a multi-pitch route is circa in length. Advanced climbing techniques such as simul climbing can materially reduce—and even completely remove—the need for &#x27;pitches&#x27; on a multi-pitch climbing route. The term is also used in caving.

==Description==

In lead climbing — either in rock climbing, mountaineering, and ice climbing — the term &#x27;pitch&#x27; describes the length of a section of a climbing route between belays of the &#x27;lead climber&#x27;. A route that requires a leader to be belayed only once (ignoring any follow-up belay of the &#x27;second climber&#x27; by the leader), is called a &#x27;single-pitch climb&#x27;; where there are multiple belays of the leader, it is called a &#x27;multi-pitch climb&#x27;. The term is also applied to the reverse process of abseiling, where it denotes the number of anchor points needed to complete the abseil (abseil anchor points are often, but not always, lead climbing belay points). 

Most lead climbing — and particularly sport climbing — routes are &#x27;single-pitch&#x27;. Single-pitch routes vary from to the full length of the climbing rope, which is typically . Very short single-pitch routes (i.e. under in length) can be classed as highball bouldering routes, and do not require any protection or the need for belaying (i.e. the concept of a &#x27;pitch&#x27; is redundant in bouldering).

Multi-pitch climbing introduces greater risk and requires greater skills and additional climbing equipment. In big wall climbing and in alpine climbing, it is possible to have multi-pitch routes with over 30 pitches, with notable examples being the 31-pitch big wall route, &quot;The Nose&quot; (VI, 5.9, C2) on El Capitan, or the +30-pitch alpine climbing route, the &quot;Walker Spur&quot; (ED1, IV, 5c/6a, A1) on the Grandes Jorasses.

Climbing guidebooks will typically have a topo that outlines the key features of each individual &#x27;pitch(s)&#x27; on a given climbing route (e.g. grade, length, climbing challenges, availability of climbing protection and belay stations etc.,).

==Length==
A single-pitch route can range from to the full length of the climbing rope (by definition, the longest belay of a &#x27;leader&#x27; is limited by the length of the rope). In the 1960s to the 1980s, climbing ropes were typically in length, however, modern ropes are typically in length (and can extend to ), which sets the current theoretical maximum length of a &#x27;pitch&#x27;. 

On multi-pitch routes, the typical average length of a pitch tends to be in the range, which is well inside the length of the most commonly used modern climbing ropes. This is due to the effect of other factors that also determine the ideal length of pitches (and thus the total number of pitches) on a multi-pitch route, including: 

* Belay stations. In multi-pitch climbing, the availability of secure—and comfortable—belay stations is an important factor for climbers; thus where a particularly good belay station presents itself, a pitch might be shortened to avail of it.

* Equipment weight. Longer climbing ropes mean greater weight (and more rope drag) on the lead climber. In addition, the protection requirements of an overly long pitch may require the leader to carry too much equipment (e.g. large SCLDs on a crack climbing route), and thus more manageable pitch lengths are preferred.

* Obstacles and features. Overhangs, roofs, and traverses may require pitches to be broken up to enable the climbers to set themselves up properly. Danger zones (e.g. couloirs prone to avalanche or rockfall) may also have shorter pitches to get both climbers out of the danger area quickly.

* Rope drag. If the line of a pitch is not straight but instead follows an indirect or a zig-zag line (of the climbing protection follows such a line), then the leader will experience rope drag, which can limit the length of the pitch (i.e. the pitch has to be broken up into smaller sections).

* Technical difficulty. If the technical grade of a pitch is high—and particularly relative to the other pitches on the route—then it may be shortened to give the leader a rest after completing it. Conversely, pitches of easier relative technical grades can often be full rope lengths.

==Linking pitches==
On long but easier routes, the climbing pair may use simul climbing (or a running belay), whereby both climbers &quot;simultaneously&quot; ascend the route. The &#x27;lead climber&#x27; acts like on a normal lead climb, however, the &#x27;second&#x27; does not remain belaying in a static position, but instead also climbs, removing/unclipping the protection equipment of the &#x27;lead climber&#x27;. Both climbers are tied to the rope at all times, and both make sure that there are several points of protection in situ between them. Simul climbing is only performed on terrain both climbers are comfortable on, as any fall is serious; often the stronger climber goes second. In such a scenario, the concept of a &#x27;pitch&#x27; is redundant as the pair keeps moving through the belay stations that mark the end of a normal pitch.

Simul climbing techniques, and the linking of pitches, are very common in alpine climbing, where snowfields can be simul-combined as one continuous pitch (although when iced, they have to be belayed in smaller pitches). A classic example is the &quot;1938 Heckmair Route&quot; (ED2, V−, A0, 60° snow) on the Eiger, which has 7-10 sections that most parties will lead climb as individual pitches (e.g. &quot;The Ice Hose&quot;, &quot;The Ice Chimney&quot;, &quot;The Quartz Crack&quot;), while much of the rest of the route can be simul-climbed as a continuous pitch.

Speed climbing on multi-pitch rock climbing routes can also use simul-climbing techniques for greater efficiency. For example, many speed climbing pairs on the 31-pitch route, &quot;The Nose&quot;, use simul-climbing on the easier established pitches, thus reducing the number of actual pitches (i.e. a &#x27;leader&#x27; being belayed by the &#x27;second&#x27; who is static) that they need, which significantly speeds up their rate of ascent. 

In addition, free solo climbing, which by definition avoids using any form of belaying (and therefore any need for any belay stations), can link all the pitches on a route together, with the free soloist only stopping at rest points (which may or may not be a belay station); the concept of a pitch is, therefore, less relevant in free solo climbing. 

The techniques of simul-climbing and free solo climbing—both of which avoid climbing in &#x27;pitches&#x27;, as there is no need for a belay—involve significantly greater risk to the climber(s), but by definition make the concept of a &#x27;pitch&#x27; redundant.

== In caving ==
The term &#x27;pitch&#x27; is also used by cavers to refer to a very steep or vertical section (called a drop, pit, pot, or a shaft) in a cave that needs ladders or single rope technique to descend and ascend (a drop that can be descended and ascended without equipment is a &#x27;climb&#x27;). As caving rope lengths are variable, the length of a &#x27;pitch&#x27; is that of the &#x27;drop&#x27;. The deepest known pitch is in Vrtiglavica Cave in the Julian Alps, Slovenia.

<doc id="907148" wikidata="Q7172964" url="?curid=907148" title="Peter Brimelow">
<text>Peter Brimelow (born October 13, 1947) is an American white supremacist writer. He is the founder of the website VDARE, an anti-immigration site associated with white supremacy, white nationalism, and the alt-right.

Brimelow was previously a writer and editor at &quot;National Review&quot;, and columnist for Dow Jones&#x27; &quot;MarketWatch&quot;. Brimelow founded the in 1999 and served as its first president. He describes himself as a paleoconservative. Brimelow has also been described as a leader within the alt-right movement. In January 2021, a judge dismissed a lawsuit Brimelow brought against &quot;The New York Times&quot;, ruling that his being called a &quot;white nationalist&quot; was not defamatory. According to the &quot;New York Times&quot;, Brimelow had a direct reporting relationship with Rupert Murdoch at Fox News.

==Early life and education==
Brimelow was born in 1947 in Warrington, Lancashire, England, the son of Bessie (&quot;née&quot; Knox) and Frank Sanderson Brimelow, a transport executive. Brimelow (and his twin brother) studied at the University of Sussex (BA, 1970) and Stanford University (MBA, 1972).

== Career ==
After working as a securities analyst, he moved to Toronto to work as a business writer and editor at the &quot;Financial Post&quot; and &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;. From 1978 to 1980, he was an aide to US Senator Orrin Hatch. In 1980, Brimelow moved to New York and worked for &quot;Barron&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;Fortune.&quot;

In 1990, Brimelow and Leslie Spencer&#x27;s article &quot;The Litigation Scandal&quot;, written for &quot;Forbes&quot;, won a Gerald Loeb Award in the &quot;Magazine&quot; category.

==Views and publications==
Brimelow opposes both illegal and legal immigration, despite having immigrated to the United States himself, and has referred to Spanish-speaking immigrants as &quot;completely dysfunctional&quot;. He said California used to be a &quot;paradise&quot; but was &quot;rapidly turning into Hispanic slum&quot;. Brimelow has been described as a white nationalist and a white supremacist. In 2020, Brimelow sued &quot;The New York Times&quot; for labeling him a &quot;white nationalist&quot;. In 2022, Brimelow called for a reversal of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, a 1954 Supreme Court decision that directed an end to segregated schools.

The Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) has described Brimelow&#x27;s website VDARE as a hate group, that was &quot;once a relatively mainstream anti-immigration page&quot;, but by 2003 became &quot;a meeting place for many on the radical right&quot;. The SPLC also criticized VDARE for publishing articles by white nationalists Jared Taylor and Sam Francis. It has been called &quot;white nationalist&quot; by the &quot;Rocky Mountain News&quot;. It has also been described as white supremacist. VDARE has also been described by the Anti-Defamation League as a racist anti-immigrant group. The book &quot;Anti-Immigration in the United States&quot; summarized Brimelow&#x27;s position as being that whites had built American culture and should defend it against non-whites who would try to change it.

Brimelow has appeared as a guest on &quot;The Political Cesspool&quot;, a &quot;pro-white&quot; talk radio show. Following the 2008 presidential election, Brimelow advocated that to win, the Republican Party should focus on &quot;white votes&quot;.

As of 2010 he was a senior contributing editor at Alternative Right, a website edited by Richard Spencer, according to the SPLC. He has spoken at events hosted by the National Policy Institute run by Spencer, according to the SPLC.

Brimelow appeared on a panel discussing multiculturalism during the 2012 Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC 2012), and gave a talk titled &quot;The Failure of Multiculturalism: How the pursuit of diversity is weakening the American Identity&quot;. In the face of condemnation from MSNBC and PFTAW, Al Cardenas of the American Conservative Union denied knowing Brimelow.

Larry Auster, also a prominent immigration restrictionist, was a fierce critic of Brimelow&#x27;s approach to the issue. For example, Auster criticized Brimelow&#x27;s promotion of the views of antisemitic conspiracy theorist Kevin MacDonald in the following manner: &quot;The views of Alex Linder are not fundamentally different from those of Kevin MacDonald, who is published by Peter Brimelow and Richard Spencer. The only real difference between Linder and MacDonald is that Linder explicitly touts his goal of removing all Jews from the earth, while in MacDonald&#x27;s case the same goal is implicit.&quot;

===&quot;Alien Nation&quot;===
Brimelow&#x27;s book &quot;Alien Nation: Common Sense About America&#x27;s Immigration Disaster&quot; criticizes U.S. immigration policy after 1965.

A review in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; acknowledged that the book raised a number of persuasive objections to contemporary American immigration policies, but criticized Brimelow for &quot;defining American identity in racial as opposed to cultural terms&quot;, and for the &quot;extreme character&quot; of his proposals.

The SPLC described it as an &quot;infamous anti-immigrant book&quot;, and pointed to Center for Immigration Studies executive director Mark Krikorian&#x27;s positive review of the book as evidence his organization had close ties to white nationalists.

===&quot;The Worm in the Apple&quot;===
&quot;The Worm in the Apple&quot; discusses public education and teachers&#x27; unions, considering unions as &quot;highly destructive&quot;. David Gordon summarizes Brimelow&#x27;s view in his review of the book in &quot;The Mises Review&quot;: &quot;to attempt so far-reaching a goal as universal high school education is foolish.&quot; John O&#x27;Sullivan praised the book. For the Hoover Institution journal &quot;Education Next&quot;, public policy consultant George Mitchell wrote: &quot;Brimelow... demonstrates how collective bargaining for teachers has produced labor agreements that stifle innovation and risk taking. He makes it clear that the dramatic rise in influence enjoyed by the teacher unions has coincided with stagnant and unacceptable levels of student performance.&quot; However, in the same journal article, education consultant Julia E. Koppich took a more critical angle: &quot;Brimelow uses a variety of linguistic devices to drive home his points. But his over-the-top language soon grates on the nerves... His argument is not that teacher unions are destroying American education, but that they labor long and hard to preserve the status quo... But this book contains so little about education-virtually nothing about classrooms, schools, or districts-even that point gets lost.&quot; Koppich called the book &quot;an anti-public school polemic&quot;.

===&quot;The Patriot Game&quot;===
In an article in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; which was published in 2011, John M. Geddes says that Brimelow&#x27;s book &quot;The Patriot Game: National Dreams and Political Realities&quot; &quot;offered a bracingly of-the-moment conservative critique of Canada,&quot; and said that it was instrumental in shaping the thought process of Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper.

== Personal life ==
Brimelow&#x27;s first wife was Margaret Alice &quot;Maggy&quot; Laws, a native of Newfoundland, Canada who worked for the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research when they met in New York. They were married until her death on February 6, 2004, from cancer. Brimelow had two children with Laws, Alexander and Hannah Claire. As of June 2021, Hannah is a blogger for political commentator Tim Pool&#x27;s website &quot;Timcast&quot;.

In 2007, Brimelow married Lydia Sullivan; at the time, Lydia was 22 and Peter was 59. While Lydia officially claims to have started working for VDARE in 2014, the Southern Poverty Law Center found that Lydia had likely published numerous articles on the VDARE website between 2005 (while she was in college) and June 2014 under the pseudonym &quot;Athena Kerry&quot;, and tax documents associated with the VDARE Foundation listed her as a business partner as early as 2008. As of 2020, she is the president of the VDARE Foundation and the publisher of VDARE.com.

<text>Hedningarna (&quot;The Heathens&quot;) is a Swedish, and for some years partly Finnish, folk music band that mixes electronics and rock with elements from old Scandinavian folk music. Their music features yoik or juoiggus, a traditional Sami form of song.

==History==
Hållbus Totte Mattson, Anders Stake and Björn Tollin formed Hedningarna in 1987. &quot;Hedning&quot; is Swedish for , while &quot;ar&quot; is the plural suffix, and &quot;na&quot; is the definite article (thus &quot;hedningar&quot; &#x27;heathens&#x27;, &quot;hedningarna&quot; &#x27;the heathens&#x27;). They wanted to go far back to the roots of the Old Norse culture, including the use of ancient instruments not much used in current Swedish folk music. Stake, a trained luthier, also began to invent and build new instruments, to produce new sounds.

In 1988, Hedningarna performed a major part of the music to the stage play &quot;Den stora vreden&quot; (roughly meaning The Great Wrath) which aroused great interest. Music arranger was Ale Möller. Their first album titled &quot;Hedningarna&quot; was released on Alice Records in 1989. In 1991, Hedningarna began their collaboration with Silence Records. They met the Finnish singers Sanna Kurki-Suonio and Tellu Paulasto. The album &quot;Kaksi!&quot; (Finnish for &quot;two&quot;) was released in September 1992. In 1993 Hedningarna was awarded a Swedish Grammis (the equivalent of Grammy) for The Best Folk Music Album of the year. The sales of &quot;Kaksi!&quot; reached 35,000 albums, which is very high for a folk music record in Sweden. British Sasha made a remix of Hedningarna&#x27;s &quot;Kruspolska&quot; which climbed the charts in England.

The third album &quot;Trä&quot;, meaning &#x27;wood&#x27; in Swedish (a pun, since &quot;Trä&quot; also sounds a lot like the Swedish word for &quot;Three&quot;: tre) was released in September 1994. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; wrote &quot;it may sound alien, but yet it sounds like the most essential music on the earth.&quot; Hedningarna performed at the Roskilde Festival in the presence of 20,000 people on the second largest stage. In 1995, Hedningarna toured Scandinavia and abroad. A compilation album with songs from &quot;Trä&quot; and &quot;Kaksi!&quot; was released in the United States. By 1995, their albums had been released in Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Poland, Thailand, Great Britain and the U.S.

The singers Kurki-Suonio and Paulasto stayed at home in Finland during 1996 for child birth and their studies. Paulasto decided to leave the band, and she was replaced by Anita Lehtola, who had been in the same class as Paulasto at The Sibelius Academy in Helsinki. Mattson, Stake and Tollin began work on their new album &quot;Hippjokk&quot;. Rock bassist Ulf Ivarsson played the new bass mandora built by Mattson. Finnish Sami yoik singer Wimme Saari participated with his singing and the Norwegian guitarist Knut Reiersrud had also a role in the album. Johan Liljemark played the didgeridoo, which he had learned in Australia while living among the Aboriginals. &quot;Hippjokk&quot; was released in February 1997. The band made tours and festival gigs with the singers in Spain and Belgium, and Ulf &quot;Rockis&quot; Ivarsson became a member of Hedningarna. Anders Stake changed his name to Anders Norudde.

During the winter of 1998, Hedningarna travelled to Karelia, Russia to gather inspiration for their new album, &quot;Karelia Visa&quot;. It was recorded during the spring and summer the same year. A short tour around Spain took place that summer. Ulf Ivarsson left the group after the recordings were finished. Mattson and Tollin together with the violin player Ola Bäckström recorded a CD with music for the dance troupe Virvla. It was released at Silence records in 1999. Sanna Kurki-Suonio released a solo album in Finland the same year. &quot;Karelia Visa&quot; was released in 1999, and it was followed by concerts in Scandinavia and a three-week tour in the USA.

Hedningarna played live to a dance performance based on their music, made and performed by Flying Foot Forum in Minneapolis, USA. The violin player Magnus Stinnerbom joined the group. In 2000, Norudde released a solo album and the percussionist Christian Svensson joined the group, replacing founding member Björn Tollin. By then, even Kurki-Suonio and Lehtola had left the ranks. Tellu Paulasto now known as Tellu Virkkala returned while taking with her Finnish compatriot Liisa Matveinen as a new member. With this line-up the band toured and recorded a couple of new tracks of which two can be found on the compilation CD &quot;1989–2003&quot;, released in 2003. By then, Hedningarna had sold about 150,000 records. The singers left the group in 2003, and the following years the group kept a low profile, doing occasional gigs only. In 2009, the band announced on their homepage that they were working on material for a new studio album, as a trio with singer and fiddle player Samuel Andersson joining founding members Mattsson and Norudde.

In 2011, a remixed version of &quot;Vargtimmen&quot; (&quot;Hour of the Wolf&quot;) from &quot;Trä&quot; was used in the trailer of the video game &quot;The Witcher 2&quot;. 
At the beginning of 2012, the year of 25th anniversary of the band, Hedningarna announced the première of new CD called &quot;&amp;&quot;, released April 2012. The album contained some strong political overtones and featured a collaboration with cult group Philemon Arthur and the Dung. In 2016, an album with previously unreleased recordings from 1992 to 2003 was announced, called &quot;Kult&quot;.

<text>El Otro Yo (, &quot;The Other Me&quot;) is an Argentinean alternative rock band. They made their debut in the late &#x27;80s / early &#x27;90s, with a demo tape called Los Hijos de Alien, followed by Traka-Traka. Later on, the group founded its own label, Besotico Records.

==From the beginnings in Temperley to Abrecaminos (1988–1999)==
El Otro Yo formed in the late 1980s/early 1990s in Temperley, in the south of Greater Buenos Aires. At the age of five, Humberto Cristian and María Fernanda Aldana started playing music at home with their father&#x27;s classical guitar (he was a bolero and tango singer in old bars) and a GEM organ. Under the influence of their mother, who was a poet, they started writing their first songs, which were simple in the early stages but revolutionary nonetheless, in the style of Velvet Underground &amp; Nico. At school, they played together in a band called Revolución, where they covered songs by Sumo, Virus and Miguel Mateos. Afterwards, Cristian formed his first punk rock band: Los Apáticos. Between 1986 and 1987, Cristian played in Los Apáticos and El Gregal, where Ricky Rúa (current EOY drummer) played drums; meanwhile María became part of groups such as Rebecca, whose drummer was also Ricky Rúa. Around those years, they decided to form a band together. Marifer had read a letter that French poet Arthur Rimbaud wrote when he was 16 and which stated “I Am Another” (“Je Suis Un Autre”); that phrase was imbedded in her memory during the formative years of the band. In January 1988, María told Cristian about the title of the poem, he rounded off the idea and thus El Otro Yo became the definite name of the band.

Early line ups included musicians such as Sergio Ucci (Alerta Roja), Gabo Manelli (Los Brujos, Juana La Loca and Babasónicos), Lee-chi (Los Brujos) and many more. Back then, María Fernanda played keyboards meanwhile Cristian was the lead singer and guitar player. Later on, Omar Kischinovsky joined the band on drums and Daniel Rodríguez on bass, but Daniel left the band in order to pursue a career playing the sitar, which has proved to be successful. Due to the lack of a bass player, María Fernanda left the keyboards to replace Daniel. Now a trio, they left Temperley and started playing in Capital Federal, Córdoba, Mendoza and other Argentinian provinces. There are several demos that capture the work of all these line ups, but they never were released on CD. 
Back in 1992, they already had a demo with two tracks (“Los pájaros” and “Sexo en el elevador”) and used two decks to make home recordings of songs such as &quot;Analía&quot;, &quot;Hola papá&quot;, &quot;Vacaciones&quot; and &quot;Caminando&quot;. That same year, they released their first self-managed production: LOS HIJOS DE ALIEN. It was the first release of Besótico Records, the band&#x27;s own label, thus sealing their independent personality. Carrying a small backpack, Cristian was in charge of distributing the album around the record shops. The cassette was regarded as Best Record of the Year by No, the rock section of Página 12, and also voted by several well-known artists as Best Album on the Sí music section of Clarín.

It was then when Daniela Cugliándolo and Sudor frío, her theatre group, joined the band on stage with a performance that depicted two actresses emulating one person. Later on, Daniela kept doing live performances that reflected the different emotions representing the intensity of the music. She appears on the “Corta el pasto” video with giant wings and a set of pruning shears. Afterwards, she became their keyboard player.
In 1994, the three band members - Humberto Cristian Aldana (guitar and voice), his sister María Fernanda (bass and voice), and Omar Kischinovsky (drums) - record at Moebio Studios their second album and first CD: TRAKA TRAKA. Their artistic producer was Guillermo Picolini (Toreros Muertos, Pachuco Cadáver). The CD was launched at the Confitería Ideal.

In 1995, drummer Omar Kischinovsky decides to leave after having played in the band for almost three years. His final show was at El Borde, in Temperley. He was replaced by Raimundo Horacio Fajardo. The band&#x27;s international debut was in Chile, in an exchange with Pánico. The same year, they record MUNDO, which has the distinctive feature of having been recorded with a portable four-track and using as a recording booth a derelict Dodge Polara that belonged to the Aldana family. The album was mixed by Diego Vainer, its recording engineer was Pablo Márquez and it was launched at Dr. Jekyll. To wrap up the year, they recorded a cover version of &quot;Fuck You&quot;, which was the title of a tribute album to Sumo.

In 1996, they re-release a CD version of LOS HIJOS DE ALIEN, with unreleased versions of tracks such as “Lo de adentro” and a remix of “69”, from the album MUNDO, in a production of Fantasías Animadas. That year, they join the Rock &amp; Pop Alternativo Festival at Ferro Stadium, along with Soda Stereo, Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, Silverchair, Tracy Bonham and Robi Draco Rosa among others, thus becoming one of the best bands in the country. 
The following year, María Fernanda told Cristian that she had some very experimental songs of her own that she would like to release. The project kept growing until it became a triple album called ESENCIA, which had a great CD edition and an album recorded by each band member. ESENCIA includes over 70 tracks divided into three albums that were recorded independently. It was presented on two occasions: at the Santa María Theatre and at the Ricardo Rojas Cultural Centre; the latter gathered the biggest audience of the Molotov Sessions (Ciclo Molotov).

In 1998, after touring around the country with Attaque 77, they release a 25-song compilation album called EL OTRO YO DEL OTRO YO, which includes the most outstanding songs of ESENCIA. Besótico also releases a book and solo album by María Fernanda called ENTRESUEÑOS. At the same time, they release EL MAR ALADO, a poetry booked penned by Ray.

In ’99, they release ABRECAMINOS, produced by Diego Vainer. This album will be widely accepted by the audience, thus expanding the frontiers of El Otro Yo. It was presented at the General San Martín Theatre. With songs such as &quot;No me importa morir&quot;, &quot;La música&quot;, &quot;Melodías vibradoras&quot; and &quot;10.000.000&quot;, the band breaks the boundaries of the underground scene. That year, Ezequiel Araujo, Avant Press former bass player, joins the band on keyboards, after Daniela Cugliándolo (who by then had become a theatre director) moved to Barcelona, where nowadays she films and directs Super 8 art videos and is part of Spanish group Bradien.

==&quot;Contagiándose la energía del otro&quot; and the key of success (2000–07)==
In early 2000, they continue touring around different neighborhoods, taking their music to the whole of Buenos Aires and other Argentinian provinces. Their shows in Chile, Uruguay and Peru prove to be successful, and their fan base in those countries rapidly increases. At this stage, Besótico Records starts releasing albums by Sugar Tampaxxx, Victoria Mil (former Victoria Abril), She-Devils, Rey Gurú and De Romanticistas Shaolin. This was a key year for El Otro Yo. By mid-year, they record a new live album during two shows at Cemento. This album was called CONTAGIÁNDOSE LA ENERGÍA DEL OTRO. After years of an independent career, their well-known Gira Interminable tour took them to Obras Sanitarias Stadium for the first time, where they presented their latest production. The street posters for the show read “Independent rock arrives to Obras”. Over five thousand people gathered at this special show. To wrap up the year, they reached an agreement with Gustavo Santaolalla and his Surco label to release ABRECAMINOS internationally.

In 2001, a remastered re-edition of TRAKA TRAKA goes on sale and ABRECAMINOS is released in the United States and Mexico.
They embark on a new Gira Interminable around the country, finishing up once again at Obras Sanitarias Stadium, with guests such as Leo García, Adrián Dárgelos and Rosario Bléfari, among others. As the frontiers expand, they play in the United States and Mexico for the first time. They join the Watcha Tour along with Los Enanitos Verdes, Molotov, La Ley, Juanes, Bersuit Vergarabat and Dover, among others. During this tour, and with the help of Gustavo Santaolalla, La Ley invites EOY to play at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles, with an audience of over 20.000 people. In addition, the band meets Justin Meldal-Johnsen (bass player for Beck, Nine Inch Nails and Air, among others), who invites Beck to an EOY gig in Los Angeles.

During 2002, the band starts recording COLMENA, which is released in December, with “Inmaduro” as its first single. COLMENA is the hive where they concentrated the resulting product of the pollen they collected in each place they visited, shaping and packing it into a CD with fourteen songs and an interactive video. The new material, with an unusual and original cover art, was produced once again by Diego Vainer and featured guests such as Gustavo Santaolalla, Horacio “Gamexane” Villafañe (Todos Tus Muertos), Mariano Martínez (Attaque 77) and Ricardo Espinoza (Flema). It reflects a musical evolution and a greater integration in the songwriting process. Some of the most outstanding tracks are “Inmaduro”, “Viajero”, “Virus”, “Calles” or “Me harté”.

In 2004, the band releases ESPEJISMOS. That year, keyboard player Ezequiel Araujo decides to follow a new path as a producer (Intoxicados, Fidel and many others) and leaves the band. By synchronicity of the magical musical destiny, he is immediately replaced by Gabriel Guerrisi, distant cousin of the Aldana siblings and founder of Los Brujos (mega band from the 1990s), who had just left Juana La Loca. The hardcore moments and strong messages about society and the system that the band always conveyed are back on ESPEJISMOS (“Pecadores”, “Nuevo orden”, “Mascota del sistema” and its first single “Licuadora mutiladora”). Nevertheless, they also show a softer side on songs such as “Debe cambiar” or “Tu ángel”. The album is played at the Obras Sanitarias Stadium on April 16, 2005. That same year, they release PIRATA, a live album with songs captured by the fans during the band&#x27;s latest tour.

In 2006, Besótico releases Marifer&#x27;s new solo album: DIOS TE SALVE MARÍA, a piano CD that comes with poetry and which was recorded at La Alianza Francesa and produced by Diego Vainer and Ezequiel Araujo. Furthermore, the label releases the live CD of the band&#x27;s first show at Obras Sanitarias Stadium on November 4, 2000. CONTAGIÁNDOSE LA ENERGÍA DEL OTRO captures on CD and DVD the best moments of the night. The set list includes the band&#x27;s most acclaimed songs (“10.000.000”, “No me importa morir”, “La música”, “EOY”, “Alegría”) and some distinctive guests: metal singer Claudio O’Connor on “69” and Diego Arnedo on “Fuck You”. The album includes an unreleased track called “Lobizón” and the DVD features documentaries about the 2000 Gira Interminable tour and backstage moments at Obras Sanitarias.

==20 years traveling out of time: &quot;Fuera del Tiempo&quot; (2007–09)==
In June 2007, FUERA DEL TIEMPO goes on sale. The album was produced by Patricio Claypole and American producer Billy Anderson (Melvins, Mr. Bungle, Sick of It All and Los Natas), among others. By the end of the year, the band plays in Ecuador for the first time at the international festival of independent bands, representing Argentina.

In 2008, they officially present FUERA DEL TIEMPO at the Obras Sanitarias Stadium. Once again, they kick off a national and international tour, under the mentorship of Diego Vainer, who also plays synthesizers and keyboards live. During the tour, the play in places such as the Vive Latino Festival, the Foro Sol in Mexico and the pyramids of the Música para los Dioses Festival. They also tour around Mexico with local band Café Tacuba.
In October, they release ESTALLANDO TU LADO SALVAJE, a live CD and DVD from the 2005 show at Obras Sanitarias Stadium, where they presented ESPEJISMOS. This edition also includes images from previous tours and shows, such as the Pepsi Music show in 2007.At the end of the year, they celebrate their 20th anniversary with a show at Parque Roca, with special guests such as Horacio “Gamexane” Villafañe (Todos Tus Muertos), Walas (Massacre), Fernando Ruiz Díaz (Catupecu Machu), Ale Sergi y Juliana Gattas (Miranda), Chary (Loquero), and former EOY members like former drummer Omar Kischinovsky and “Osvaldito”, one of the first bass players, among other guests. On the other hand, they become the first Argentinian rock band to design a pair of trainers with Vans’ Black Fin.

In 2009, they travel to Mexico to record a new album under the production of Paco Huidobro. Furthermore, Cristian becomes the chairman of the Union of Independent Musicians (Unión de Músicos Independientes), a civil association that gathers over 6000 registered bands. In October, and after 15 years, Ray Fajardo decides to leave the band. Once again, musical dharma materializes and, on this occasion, Ricky Rúa becomes EOY drummer. Ricky was the singer in Los Brujos as well as drummer in the first bands that the Aldana siblings formed.

==From Ailabiu EOY to 5ta Dimensión (2010-)==
The band celebrated the special Argentinian and Mexican editions of their new studio album, AILABIU EOY, which was artistically produced by Paco Huidobro and had Jason Carmer&#x27;s technical production. The album was recorded in Mexico City in 2009, mastered by Harris Newman (Arcade Fire, Crystal Castles) at Grey Market Mastering, in Montreal (Canada), and featured renowned members from Café Tacuba, Molotov and Fobia. Along with the release of the album, they become the third band in the world (after Nine Inch Nails and Radiohead) to transform their official website into a social network, called Comunidad EOY, where thousands of fans around the world can sign up and upload pictures, videos, chat with other fans, make friends and get the latest updates on the band. They are also the first Latin American band to offer their own application to iPhone, iPad and iPod Touch users. In addition, they created EOY TV, their own television channel, which can be viewed on their official website. At the same time, their songs become available on all digital stores around the world.

In 2010, they shoot three videos: “Siempre fui yo” (directed by Guillermo Tragant), “Ailabiu” (directed by Juan Chappa) and “Velero” (directed by Mov Productions and with illustrations by Pablo Bisoglio, who also designed many of the band&#x27;s album covers). Furthermore, the band was asked by MTV Latin America to perform a song for the MTV Bicentennial special.

They keep on touring on a national and international level and in October they are chosen by Pixies as guest act for their show at the Luna Park. They are the only Argentinian band to play at the Maquinaria Fest in Chile, where they share the stage with Pixies, Hoppo, Yo La Tengo, Cansei de Ser Sexy, Queens of the Stone Age, Linkin Park and Incubus, among other bands. In November, they are chosen by Smashing Pumpkins to open their show at the Luna Park.

In 2011, they kicked off the year by reviewing their first two records, LOS HIJOS DE ALIEN y TRAKA TRAKA, as well as playing songs from their new record at Unione e Benevolenza. In May, they played an acoustic set at the Centro Cultural de la Memoria Haroldo Conti, in the former ESMA. At the end of that month, they officially launched AILABIU EOY at the Salón Dorado, adding songs from MUNDO and ABRECAMINOS to the repertoire. In July, they debut the video for &quot;El verano&quot;. On an international level, they joined the Unite Tour, which took them all over Mexico during three months and allowed them to play at the prestigious Cervantino Festival in Guanajuato. The band closed the “Espacio Joven” in Tecnópolis, where they played in two occasions (the final show being a special tribute to Horacio &quot;Gamexane&quot; Villafañe, a dear friend of the band), and also closed the festival that celebrated the National Law of Music, at Dos Congresos Square. They ended the year with two shows at Groove. Marifer Aldana releases a new solo album called “Noosfera”, which features guests such as Diego Vainer, Gerardo Farez and Ezequiel Araujo, among other friends.

In early 2012, they went into Panda and Cuzco studios to record their tenth album, 5TA DIMENSIÓN, produced by Gabriel Guerrisi and Cristian Aldana. The record was released in June 2012 and was presented with a show at the Vorterix Theatre. The first single was “Los niños”, a song about gender-based violence. 5TA DIMENSIÓN was presented with a tour around the country, with over 20 dates from North to South. They ended the year at El Teatro de Flores with a show that had Ezequiel Araujo back on keyboards on a permanent basis.

2013 was a special year as the band celebrated their 25th anniversary. The celebrations included a series of shows: the first one was in February at the Vorterix Theatre, where they celebrated the 10th anniversary of COLMENA. In May, it was the turn of &quot;El Otro Yo para poguear&quot;, with the band&#x27;s wildest songs being played at El Teatro de Flores. In September, they did an unplugged show at the ND Theatre, with 15 musicians on stage playing a string quartet, percussion and wind instruments. Special guests such Guillermo Piccolini, Diego Vainer and Gerardo Farez joined the band for this show. In October, they went back to the Vorterix Theatre for the &quot;Mamelucos Fest Silver Anniversary&quot;, which saw the return of the overalls and the opportunity for a fan to win the band&#x27;s official overall. That same month, they released PLATÓN EN LA 5TA DIMENSIÓN, with marked the official launch of 5TA DIMENSIÓN in record stores and which included the track &quot;Platón&quot;, produced by Ezequiel Araujo. From this record, videos were made for &quot;Saltar&quot;, &quot;Te quiero&quot; and &quot;Dinero 666&quot;. They concluded the celebrations at the Auditorio Sur in Temperley with a show called &quot;25 years, 50 songs&quot;, with a set list put together by the fans through the social networks.

<text>Paul Craig Roberts (born April 3, 1939) is an American economist and author. He formerly held a sub-cabinet office in the United States federal government as well as teaching positions at several U.S. universities. He is a promoter of supply-side economics and an opponent of recent U.S. foreign policy.

Roberts received a doctorate from the University of Virginia where he studied under G. Warren Nutter. He worked as an analyst and adviser at the United States Congress where he was credited as the primary author of the original draft of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. He was the United States Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy under President Ronald Reagan and – after leaving government – held the William E. Simon chair in economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies for ten years and served on several corporate boards. A former associate editor at &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, his articles have also appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and he is the author of more than a dozen books and a number of peer-reviewed papers.

Since retiring, he has been accused of antisemitism and conspiracy theorizing by the Southern Poverty Law Center and others.

==Early life and education==
Paul Craig Roberts III was born in Atlanta, Georgia on April 3, 1939, to Paul Craig Roberts and Ellen Roberts (née Dryman).

Roberts received a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial management from the Georgia Institute of Technology where he was initiated into the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. After university, in 1961, he was awarded a Lisle Fellowship to undertake a tour of the Soviet Union. According to a later profile of Roberts in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, his experience watching a queue for meat in Tashkent led to him becoming &quot;born again&quot; as an adherent of supply side economics.

Upon his return to the United States, Roberts enrolled in graduate courses at the University of California Berkeley and Stanford University, before earning a PhD in economics from the University of Virginia where he studied as a Thomas Jefferson Scholar. His dissertation, prepared under the supervision of G. Warren Nutter, was titled &quot;An Administrative Analysis of Oskar Lange&#x27;s Theory of Socialist Planning&quot; and evolved what Roberts described as &quot;seminal but neglected&quot; ideas set-out by Michael Polanyi in his 1951 text &quot;The Logic of Liberty&quot;.

On completion of his doctoral studies, Roberts spent a year on a research fellowship at the University of Oxford, where he was a member of Merton College.

==Career==

===Early career===
Roberts began his career with teaching assignments at Virginia Polytechnic Institute, the University of New Mexico, Stanford University, and Tulane University. He was a professor of business administration and professor of economics at George Mason University and was the inaugural William E. Simon Chair in Political Economy at Georgetown University, serving for 12 years.
While a visiting professor at Georgetown University, he was hired as economics counsel to United States Congressman Jack Kemp, later also serving as economics counsel to United States Senator Orrin Hatch, as staff associate with the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, and as chief economist with the minority staff of the United States House of Representatives Committee on the Budget. He has been credited as the primary author of the original draft of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.

During this time, he also contributed columns to &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; and served as associate editor of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;″s opinion page.

===Later career===
In December 1980, along with Alan Greenspan and Herbert Stein, Roberts was one of the three speakers at the two-day National Forum on Jobs, Money and People at the Innisbrook Resort and Golf Club in Palm Harbor, Florida. Two months later, in 1981, he was appointed by President of the United States Ronald Reagan as Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Economic Policy. As Assistant Treasury Secretary he was a driver behind the economic policy of the first term of the Reagan administration and was lauded as the &quot;economic conscience of Ronald Reagan&quot;. Nonetheless, his singular zealousness for supply-side economics provoked ire in some quarters within the government, with Larry Kudlow – then an official in the Office of Management and Budget – saying that &quot;Craig saw himself as the keeper of the Reagan flame. Only Craig knew what was right. No one else knew what was right&quot;. Roberts&#x27; concern about U.S. budget deficits led him into conflict with other Reagan-era officials such as Martin Feldstein and David Stockman.

Roberts resigned in February 1982 to return to academia. He was a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution, from 1983 to 1993 was the William E. Simon Chair in Political Economy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies and, from 1993 to 1996, a distinguished fellow at the Cato Institute.

From 1983 to 2019, Roberts served as a board director of nine different Value Line investment funds. Between 1992 and 2006 he sat on the board of directors of A. Schulman and, according to the company, was its longest-serving independent director at the time of his retirement.

====Post-retirement writing and media====
In the 2000s, Roberts wrote columns for Creators Syndicate. Later, he contributed to &quot;CounterPunch&quot;, becoming one of its most popular writers. He has been a regular guest on programs broadcast by RT (formerly known as Russia Today). As of 2008, he was part of the editorial collective of the far right website VDARE. He has been funded by the Unz Foundation. His writings are published by &quot;Veterans Today&quot;, &quot;InfoWars&quot;, PressTV and &quot;GlobalResearch&quot;, and he is frequently a guest on the podcasts, radio shows and video channels of the Council of Conservative Citizens, Max Keiser and 9/11 truther Kevin Barrett. His own website publishes the work of Israel Shamir and Diana Johnstone.

==Work==

===Views===
====Economic policy====
Roberts&#x27; commitment to supply-side economics has been a dominant feature of his career. Writing in 1984, Thomas B. Silver said that adherents of supply-side economics had &quot;no more formidable advocate in their ranks&quot; than Roberts. However, Roberts has expressed skepticism at the ability of government to lower taxes and decrease regulation, positing that the personal political ambition of officeholders tends to promote meddling in the economy, a criticism he has directed even at the former Reagan administration of which he was a part.

Ron Hira of the Economic Policy Institute has described Roberts as one of the first prominent economists to &quot;break from the orthodoxy&quot; by opposing offshoring; Roberts believes that the practice is &quot;lethal for America&#x27;s future&quot;. According to him, &quot;a country that doesn&#x27;t make anything doesn’t need a financial sector as there is nothing to finance&quot;. In 2004, Paul Blustein in &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described him as heretical in relation to mainstream US economics for challenging the positive impact of free trade.

Roberts is also a critic of the Federal Reserve System and central banking in general.

====Society and culture====
According to Roberts, &quot;the West in general suffers from an excess of skepticism about its own values and accomplishments. We&#x27;re being gobbled up by nihilism, itself the product of unbridled skepticism. It&#x27;s hard to anchor on to the verities anymore&quot;. He has expressed his opposition to Affirmative Action policies and dismissed the existence of white male privilege. In an opinion column for Scripps Howard News Service in 1997, Roberts opposed gender integration aboard U.S. Navy vessels, opining that gender integration would destroy the &quot;ethos of comradeship&quot; which, in his view, motivated wartime sacrifice more than &quot;abstract concepts such as honor and country&quot;.

In &quot;The New Color Line&quot; (1995), Roberts and co-author Lawrence M. Stratton argue that the Civil Rights Act was subverted by the bureaucrats who applied it.

He believes the US is a police state.

====Drug policy====
Writing in 1995, Roberts expressed skepticism at the war on drugs, saying that it &quot;perfectly illustrates the maxim &#x27;the road to hell is paved with good intentions&#x27;.&quot; In &quot;The Tyranny of Good Intentions&quot; (2000), Roberts and co-author Lawrence Stratton argued that the opposition of some American conservatives to drug-policy reform was an example of &quot;the right&#x27;s myopia&quot;.

====Foreign policy====
He is a strong opponent of neoconservatism, saying, &quot;the neocons are the worst thing that ever happened to the United States. (They’re) really the scum of the earth… They should all be picked up and shipped out of the country. They all belong in Israel. That’s where they should be. Pick ’em up, ship ’em to Israel, revoke their passports.&quot;

Roberts has stated his opposition to United States involvement in the post-2001 War in Afghanistan and to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. According to Roberts, &quot;the Bush regime’s response to 9/11 and the Obama regime’s validation of this response have destroyed accountable, democratic government in the United States&quot;. He believes the US is a puppet government of Israel.

He supports Russian president Vladimir Putin, blames Euromaidan and the Syrian civil war on a neocon plot, and argues that human rights NGOs working in Russia are part of a “US fifth column” working to undermine its government.

====Charges of conspiracy theorizing and antisemitism====
Writing in &quot;USA Today&quot;, Darrell Delamaide has described Roberts as a &quot;conspiracy theorist&quot;, a charge echoed by Luke Brinker of &quot;Salon&quot;, and Michael C. Moynihan of &quot;The Daily Beast&quot;, who has also described him as partaking in &quot;Putin worship&quot;. Roberts has rejected the label and, in turn, described Jonathan Chait and Amy Knight as conspiracy theorists.

Roberts has described himself as a &quot;9/11 skeptic&quot; and spoken at 9/11 Truth movement events. Regarding the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Roberts has written that &quot;all evidence pointed to a plot by the Joint Chiefs, CIA, and Secret Service whose right-wing leaders had concluded that President Kennedy was too &#x27;soft on communism&#x27;&quot;. He has also stated that the &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; shooting has many of the characteristics of a false flag operation&quot; motivated in part “to stifle the growing European sympathy for the Palestinians and to realign Europe with Israel”. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; noted that in 2014 Roberts speculated on his blog that Ebola originated as a US bioweapon and this was picked up by North Korea&#x27;s state media.

====Views on World War II and the Holocaust====
In 2019, Roberts wrote in support of the views of Holocaust denier David Irving, asserting that &quot;Irving, without any doubt the best historian of the European part of World War II, learned at his great expense that challenging myths does not go unpunished... I will avoid the story of how this came to be, but, yes, you guessed it, it was the Zionists&quot;. Roberts added that &quot;No German plans, or orders from Hitler, or from Himmler or anyone else have ever been found for an organized holocaust by gas and cremation of Jews... The &quot;death camps&quot; were in fact work camps. Auschwitz, for example, today a Holocaust museum, was the site of Germany&#x27;s essential artificial rubber factory. Germany was desperate for a work force.&quot;

==Personal life==
Roberts&#x27; wife, Linda, was born in the United Kingdom and professionally trained in ballet. The couple met while he was at the University of Oxford.

==Honors and recognition==
In 1981, Roberts was decorated with the United States Treasury Meritorious Service Award for &quot;outstanding contributions to the formulation of United States economic policy&quot;.

In 1987, he was invested into the French Legion of Honour at the rank of &quot;chevalier&quot; (knight) for his services to economics.

In 2015, Roberts received the International Journalism Award for Political Analysis from Club de Periodistas de Mexico.

In 2017, Roberts received the Lifetime Achievement Award from &quot;Marquis Who&#x27;s Who&quot;.

<doc id="907157" wikidata="Q6442513" url="?curid=907157" title="Kukla, Fran and Ollie">
<text>Kukla, Fran and Ollie is an early American television show using puppets. It was created for children, but was soon watched by more adults than children. It did not have a script and was entirely ad-libbed. It was broadcast from Chicago between October 13, 1947, and August 30, 1957. Comedienne Fran Allison starred, interacting with puppets, Kukla and Ollie (and sometimes other puppets) whose puppeteer was the show&#x27;s creator, Burr Tillstrom. After the original run, the team appeared in other productions over several decades.

== Original series ==

Burr Tillstrom was the creator and only puppeteer on the show, which premiered as the hour-long Junior Jamboree locally on WBKB in Chicago, Illinois, on October 13, 1947. The program was renamed &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; (&quot;KFO&quot;) and transferred to WNBQ (the predecessor of Chicago&#x27;s WMAQ-TV) on November 29, 1948. The first NBC network broadcast of the show took place on January 12, 1949. It aired from 6:00 to 6:30 p.m. Central Time, Monday through Friday from Chicago. 
&quot;Fran&quot; was Fran Allison, a radio comedian and singer who was typically the only human to appear on screen, filling the role of big sister and cheery voice of reason as the puppets engaged each other concerning their foibles. The design style of puppets was that of Neapolitan puppet shows, or Punch and Judy without the slapstick, but their personalities were less caricatured.

The puppet cast included &quot;Kukla&quot;, the earnest leader of the troupe; &quot;Ollie&quot;, or &quot;Oliver J. Dragon&quot;, a roguish one-toothed dragon (who would slam his flat chin on the stage in frustration or roll on his back to be endearing); Madame Ooglepuss, a retired opera diva; Buelah Witch, a brash, madcap witch; Fletcher Rabbit, the troupe&#x27;s mailman and resident fussbudget (who worked at the Easter Bunny&#x27;s Egg Plant during the Easter season); Cecil Bill, the troupe&#x27;s union stagehand who spoke in an unintelligible &quot;tooie talk&quot;; Colonel Crackie, a Southern gentleman; Doloras Dragon, Ollie&#x27;s younger cousin; Mercedes, a bratty grade schooler, Ollie&#x27;s mother Olivia, and a number of others.
The series&#x27; music was written and performed by Jack Fascinato, who first accompanied the troupe on solo piano and later conducted the show&#x27;s small orchestra.

&quot;KFO&quot;&#x27;s humor relied on building a relationship between its characters and the audience over time. The humor was quite tame by the standards of later comedy. There were few laugh-out-loud jokes per show; &quot;KFO&quot; relied on the humor of familiarity. &quot;KFO&quot; evoked not only loyalty but also a deep belief in its characters from regular viewers. Fans became so attached to the show that, when it was cut back to 15 minutes in November 1951, letters of outrage poured into NBC and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;The Bob &amp; Ray Show&quot; was the replacement 15-minute program and received considerable vitriol by angry &quot;KFO&quot; viewers.

From August 1952 to June 1954, &quot;KFO&quot; ran as a weekly program on Sundays (3:00–3:30 p.m. CT). They also began a weekday radio show in October 1952. It was then picked up by the ABC network and returned to the 15-minute daily format (7:00–7:15 p.m. ET) until the last regular program aired on August 30, 1957, a continuous run of nearly ten years.

During that time, &quot;KFO&quot; was a hugely successful show that counted Orson Welles, John Steinbeck, Tallulah Bankhead, Ben Grauer, Milton Caniff and Adlai Stevenson among its many adult fans. The show had sponsors like &quot;Life&quot; magazine, RCA, Nabisco and Ford Motor Co., who surely weren&#x27;t trying to reach children. James Thurber once wrote that Tillstrom was &quot;helping to save the sanity of the nation and to improve, if not even to invent, the quality of television.&quot;

== Awards ==
&quot;Kukla, Fran, and Ollie&quot; won a Peabody Award in 1949 for its &quot;whimsy and gentle satire of the James Barrie–Lewis Carroll sort,&quot; and two Emmy Awards: in 1954 for Best Children&#x27;s Program, and in 1971 for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Programming.

==The Ford 50th Anniversary Show==
In 1953, Kukla and Ollie co-hosted The Ford 50th Anniversary Show, a program that was broadcast live on both NBC and CBS. The puppets introduced various sketches and artists, were featured in a sketch about the history of the Ford Model T, and presented a multi-part &quot;Oliver J. Dragon&quot; compilation of newsreel scenes. Following a song medley by Ethel Merman and Mary Martin, Kukla and Ollie complain about having to follow the two singers performing &quot;There&#x27;s No Business Like Show Business&quot;. Ollie says, &quot;There&#x27;s no business like television, either.&quot; Kukla replies, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s so young.&quot; Ollie says, &quot;Yes. Whenever will it grow up? Maybe tonight. Maybe tonight.&quot; The program attracted an audience of 60 million viewers. Forty years after the broadcast, television critic Tom Shales recalled the broadcast as both &quot;a landmark in television&quot; and &quot;a milestone in the cultural life of the &#x27;50s&quot;.

== Later series ==

After the original series ended in 1957, Tillstrom continued to search for a place for the Kuklapolitans, doing a daily five-minute show for NBC, and even appearing on Broadway. Tillstrom and his puppets returned to NBC television without Allison in the early 1960s for &quot;Burr Tillstrom&#x27;s Kukla and Ollie&quot; show that aired weekdays. In 1967, &quot;KFO&quot; began hosting &quot;CBS Children&#x27;s Film Festival&quot;. In this context, their conversations were restricted to a brief introduction, commercial segues and a summary of the film, and could only provide a hint of what had made KFO so popular. Many people know the troupe only from this filmed show and their later taped series for NET in 1970. Burr also brought the troupe to the Goodman Theatre in Chicago for a series of live performances in the early 1980s.

&quot;KFO&quot; can claim a number of television firsts, including the first ship-to-shore telecast. The first publicly announced network broadcast of a program using the NTSC &quot;compatible color&quot; system was an episode of &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; on August 30, 1953. Burr was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in 1986 for his many contributions to the medium. Tillstrom influenced and mentored many later puppeteers, including Shari Lewis and Jim Henson.

Kukla and Ollie made an appearance on The Carpenters&#x27; 1977 television special for ABC, &quot;The Carpenters at Christmas&quot;, along with Harvey Korman and Kristy McNichol. Kukla and Ollie also appeared as panelists on a 1979 episode of &quot;Match Game PM&quot; and on two episodes of &quot;Match Game &#x27;79&quot;.

==Digital media and stamp ==

&quot;Kukla, Fran, and Ollie&quot; was first released on DVD on August 11, 2009. Five episodes that were shot in color between 1969 and 1971 were released in a box set.

On the same day, August 11, 2009, the United States Postal Service issued a commemorative stamp to honor &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot;. A Hollywood gala was scheduled to celebrate both the stamp and the 60th anniversary at the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.

&quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie – The First Episodes: 1949–54&quot; was released on Fran&#x27;s birthday, November 20, 2010, by The Burr Tillstrom Copyright Trust. It was the first release of the original series, and contains 20 kinescopes. A second volume, featuring 22 additional programs, was released on December 15, 2011. Volume 3 of the series, a 24 episode set, was eventually released in December 2013. DVD sales officially ended on January 31, 2020.

On February 24, 2020, the &quot;Kukla, Fran and Ollie&quot; YouTube channel started posting digital transfers of &quot;KFO&quot; kinescopes on a regular schedule, beginning with the earliest surviving episode. The stated goal is to eventually make all of the surviving episodes from the original series available and free to view online.

<text>In coin collecting, brockage refers to a type of error coin in which one side of the coin has the normal design and the other side has a mirror image of the same design impressed upon it.

==Description==
Brockage errors are caused when an already minted coin sticks to the coin die and impresses onto another blank that hasn&#x27;t been struck yet, pressing a mirror image of the other coin into the blank. Brockages are relatively rare among modern coins of industrialised countries where mints exercise a strict production control and somewhat less rare among the modern coins of some developing countries which operate their own mint (e.g. Nepal); in good condition, coins with clear brockage are a collector&#x27;s item and can sell for substantial amounts of money.

One can distinguish between obverse and reverse brockages. Obverse brockages occur when the previously struck coin was not ejected and gets stuck to the lower die, and reverse brockages when the previously struck coin remains stuck to the upper die.
==History==
In the production of hammered coinage, brockages were very common, although largely restricted to obverse brockages, as the mint worker would likely notice if the coin was stuck in the reverse anvil die. If the mint worker did notice the brockage, they had the option of restriking it. There is no consensus among numismatists concerning the existence of restruck brockages, as they would appear similar to coins with heavily clashed dies.

The use of screw presses drastically reduced the amount of brockages which escaped the mint from the mid 16th-century onwards, but as high speed machinery became more common in the 19th century, more brockages appear. It is known that some unscrupulous mint workers have created brockages in the past simply in order to sell to coin collectors.

<text>The 1904 World Series was not played. It would have been contested between the champions of the two major leagues—the National League (NL) and the American League (AL)—as had been done in October 1903, the first modern World Series.

The league champions in 1904 were the Boston Americans (now the Boston Red Sox) of the AL and the New York Giants (now the San Francisco Giants) of the NL. Boston had clinched their second consecutive AL pennant, while New York won the 1904 NL pennant by a wide margin, 13 games ahead of the Chicago Cubs. With still no formal arrangement in place between the two leagues regarding the staging of the World Series, the Giants under owner John T. Brush refused to play against a team from what they considered an inferior league. The resulting criticism from fans and writers caused Brush to reverse course during the offseason and lead the effort to formalize the World Series between the two leagues.

==Background==
===No formal World Series agreement===
In the first modern World Series in 1903, as well as several postseason series between the National League and the American Association in the 1880s (sometimes referred to as &quot;pre-modern World Series&quot;), the rules for a given season&#x27;s &quot;World&#x27;s Championship Series&quot; had been whatever the two participating clubs had agreed upon. The World Series was not a compulsory event and was not governed by an authoritative body. Thus, when the Boston Americans defeated the National League champion Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1903 World Series, the contest was arranged directly by the two champion clubs, not by the leagues themselves.

===New York Giants===

During this time, there was an intense business rivalry between the two leagues, especially in New York. During spring training in March 1904, New York Giants owner John T. Brush said &quot;there will never be a series&quot; between the New York-based teams—his Giants of the National League and the American League&#x27;s New York Highlanders (now the New York Yankees)—in response to a preseason offer from Highlanders co-owner Frank J. Farrell. 

In July 1904, as reported in &quot;Sporting Life&quot;, Brush stated that his NL club would not play the AL club &quot;if each wins the pennant in its respective league&quot;, in contradiction of a preseason agreement for a championship series between the leagues.

The Giants won the NL by a wide margin (13 games). The club then stuck to their plan, refusing to play &quot;any&quot; AL club in the proposed &quot;exhibition&quot; series (as they considered it). Giants manager John McGraw, who had personal animosity with AL president Ban Johnson, said that his team was already the world champions because they were the champions of the &quot;only real major league&quot;.

===Boston Americans===
The AL race went down to the wire. By July, the Highlanders were just games behind the Boston Americans. The Highlanders then temporarily took over first place on October 7 when they defeated Boston. But the Americans won three of their four remaining games to clinch the AL pennant, and finished games ahead of the Highlanders (who lost three of their final four games) in the final standings of October 10.

==Aftermath==
Stung by criticism from fans and writers, Brush drafted rules that both leagues adopted in mid-February 1905. The rules compelled the two winning clubs to participate and governed the annual determination of sites, dates, ticket prices and division of receipts. These new rules essentially made the World Series the premier annual Major League Baseball event.

Boston slumped in 1905, while New York repeated its NL championship and won the 1905 World Series against the Philadelphia Athletics. The two teams eventually met in the 1912 World Series with the Red Sox winning in eight games (Game 2 was a tie). The Series has been played every year since except , when a 232-day-long players&#x27; strike ended the season in mid-August.

<doc id="907167" wikidata="Q1503028" url="?curid=907167" title="Logocentrism">
<text>&quot;Logocentrism&quot; is a term coined by the German philosopher Ludwig Klages in the early 1900s. It refers to the tradition of Western science and philosophy that regards words and language as a fundamental expression of an external reality. It holds the logos as epistemologically superior and that there is an original, irreducible object which the logos represent. According to logocentrism, the logos is the ideal representation of the Platonic ideal.

== In linguistics ==
According to Jacques Derrida, with the logos as the site of a representational unity, linguistics dissects the structure of the logos further and establishes the sound of the word, coupled with the sense of the word, as the original and ideal location of metaphysical significance. Logocentric linguistics proposes that &quot;the immediate and privileged unity which founds significance and the acts of language is the articulated unity of sound and sense within the phonic.&quot; As the science of language, linguistics is a science by way of this semiotic phonology. It follows, therefore, that speech is the primary form of language and that writing is secondary, representative, and, importantly, outside of speech. Writing is a &quot;sign of a sign&quot; and, therefore, is basically phonetic.

Jonathan Culler in his book &quot;Literary Theory: A Very Short Introduction&quot; says:

:Traditionally, Western philosophy has distinguished &quot;reality&quot; from &quot;appearance,&quot; things themselves from representations of them, and thought from signs that express it. Signs or representations, in this view, are but a way to get at reality, truth, or ideas, and they should be as transparent as possible; they should not get in the way, should not affect or infect the thought or truth they represent. In this framework, speech has seemed the immediate manifestation or presence of thought, while writing, which operates in the absence of the speaker, has been treated as an artificial and derivative representation of speech, a potentially misleading sign of a sign (p. 11).

This notion that the written word is a sign of a sign has a long history in Western thought. According to Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC), &quot;Spoken words are the symbols of mental experience and written words are the symbols of spoken words.&quot; Jean-Jacques Rousseau similarly states, &quot;Writing is nothing but the representation of speech; it is bizarre that one gives more care to the determining of the image than to the object.&quot;

Derrida’s critique of logocentrism examines the limitations of linguistic systems that prioritize speech over writing and assume a direct, stable connection between language and meaning. He argues that traditional linguistics fails to be &quot;general&quot; as it remains bound by rigid distinctions—between inside and outside, essence and fact—which prevent a complete understanding of language&#x27;s structure.

For Derrida, writing isn&#x27;t merely a secondary &quot;image&quot; or representation of speech; rather, it challenges the very notion of a pure linguistic core. He suggests that if signs always refer to other signs, then writing is inherent within language itself, not a detached representation. This concept undermines the idea of language as a transparent tool for representing a stable reality.

Derrida identifies this bias, logocentrism, as central to Western metaphysical thought, which privileges &quot;presence&quot; and direct expression in speech. This bias has stifled deeper inquiry into writing&#x27;s origin and role, reducing it to a mere technical tool rather than acknowledging it as fundamental to meaning-making. Consequently, logocentrism restricts linguistic theory, making it impossible to fully explore the complex, interconnected nature of language and writing. 

== Saussure ==
Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913), it is claimed by Derrida, follows this logocentric line of thought in the development of his linguistic sign and its terminology. Where the word remains known as the whole sign, the unification of concept and sound-image becomes the unification of the signified and the signifier respectively. The signifier is then composed of an indivisible sound and image whereby the graphic form of the sign is exterior.

According to Saussure in his &quot;Course in General Linguistics&quot;, &quot;The linguistic object is not defined by the combination of the written word and the spoken word: the spoken form alone constitutes the object.&quot; Language has, he writes, &quot;an oral tradition that is independent of writing.&quot;

== Derrida ==
French philosopher Jacques Derrida (1930–2004) in his book &quot;Of Grammatology&quot; responds in depth to what he believes is Saussure&#x27;s logocentric argument. Derrida deconstructs the apparent inner, phonological system of language, stating in Chapter 2, &quot;Linguistics and Grammatology&quot;, that in fact and for reasons of essence Saussure&#x27;s representative determination is &quot;...an ideal explicitly directing a functioning which...is never completely phonetic&quot;. The idea that writing might function other than phonetically and also as more than merely a representative delineation of speech allows an absolute concept of logos to end in what Derrida describes as infinitist metaphysics. The difference in presence can never actually be reduced, as was the logocentric project; instead, the chain of signification becomes the trace of presence-absence.

== In literary theory ==
Inherent in Saussure&#x27;s reasoning, a structuralist approach to literature began in the 1950s to assess the literary text, or utterance, in terms of its adherence to certain organising conventions which might establish its objective meaning. Again, as for Saussure, structuralism in literary theory is condemned to fail on account of its own foundation: &#x27;...language constitutes our world, it doesn&#x27;t just record it or label it. Meaning is always attributed to the object or idea by the human mind, and constructed by and expressed through language: it is not already contained within the thing&#x27;.

There is no absolute truth outside of construction no matter how scientific or prolific that construction might be. Enter Derrida and post-structuralism. Other like-minded philosophers and psychoanalysts who have notably opposed logocentrism are Nietzsche, Wittgenstein, Heidegger and Freud, as well as those who have been influenced by them in this vein. Literary critic Roland Barthes (1915–1980), with his essay &quot;The Death of the Author&quot; (1968), converted from structuralism to post-structuralism.

For the post-structuralist the writer must be present in a kind of absence, or &#x27;dead&#x27;, according to Barthes; just as the reader is absent in a kind of presence at the &#x27;moment&#x27; of the literary utterance. Post-structuralism is therefore against the moral formalism of the Western literary tradition which maintains only The Greats should be looked to for literary inspiration and indeed for a means of political control and social equilibrium.

Modernism, with its desire to regain some kind of lost presence, also resists post-structuralist thought; whereas Post-modernism accepts the loss (the loss of being as &#x27;presence&#x27;) and steps beyond the limitations of logocentrism.

== In non-Western cultures ==
Some researchers consider that logocentrism may not be something which exists across all cultures, but instead has a particular bias in Western culture. Dennis Tedlock&#x27;s study of stories in the Quiché Maya culture leads him to suggest that the development of alphabetic writing systems may have led to a logocentric perspective, but this is not the case in all writing systems, and particularly less prevalent in cultures where writing has not been established. Tedlock writes, &quot;The voice is linear, in [Derrida&#x27;s] view; there is only one thing happening at a time, a sequence of phonemes,&quot; and this is reflected in writing and even the study of language in the field of linguistics and what Tedlock calls &quot;mythologics (or larger-scale structuralism)&quot;, &quot;are founded not upon a multidimensional apprehension of the multidimensional voice, but upon unilinear writing of the smallest-scale articulations within the voice.&quot; This one-dimensionality of writing means that only words can be represented through alphabetic writing, and, more often than not, tone, voice, accent and style are difficult if not impossible to represent. Geaney, in writing about ming (names) in early Chinese reveals that ideographic writing systems present some difficulty for the idea of logocentrism, and that even Derrida wrote of Chinese writing in an ambivalent way, assuming firstly that &quot;writing has a historical telos in which phonetic writing is the normal &#x27;outcome&#x27;&quot;, but also &quot;speculat[ing] without irony about Chinese writing as a &#x27;movement of civilization outside all logocentrism&#x27;&quot;.

<text>Armchair Theatre is a British television drama anthology series of single plays that ran on the ITV network from 1956 to 1974. It was originally produced by ABC Weekend TV. Its successor Thames Television took over from mid-1968.

The Canadian-born producer Sydney Newman was in charge of &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; between September 1958 and December 1962, during what is generally considered to have been its best era, and produced 152 episodes.

==History==

===Intent===
&quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; filled a Sunday-evening slot on ITV, Britain&#x27;s only commercial network at the time, in which contemporary dramas were the most common form, though this was not immediately apparent.

The series was launched by Howard Thomas, head of ABC at the time, who argued that &quot;Television drama is not so far removed from television journalism, and the plays which will grip the audience are those that face up to the new issues of the day as well as to the problems as old as civilisation.&quot;

The original producer of the series was Dennis Vance, who was in charge for the first two years. In its early years the series drew heavily on North American sources. The first play, &quot;The Outsider&quot;, was a medical drama adapted from the stage play by Dorothy Brandon, which was transmitted live on 8 July 1956 from ABC&#x27;s Manchester studios in Didsbury. Reportedly Vance had a preference for classical adaptations, though some of these—such as a version of &quot;The Emperor Jones&quot; (30 March 1958) by the American dramatist Eugene O&#x27;Neill—were not conservative choices. Vance was succeeded by Sydney Newman, who was ABC&#x27;s Head of Drama from April 1958.

The perils of live transmission caught up with the production team on 28 November 1958, early in Newman&#x27;s tenure. Whilst &quot;Underground&quot; was being broadcast, 33-year-old actor Gareth Jones suddenly collapsed and died in between his scenes. Such nightmare situations could be handled more easily when &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; was able to benefit from prerecording on videotape, after production of the series moved from Manchester to Teddington Studios near London in the summer of 1959.

Migrating from his native Canada to take up his responsibilities with ABC, Sydney Newman objected to the basis of British television drama at the time he arrived:&quot;The only legitimate theatre was of the &#x27;anyone for tennis&#x27; variety, which, on the whole, presented a condescending view of working-class people. Television dramas were usually adaptations of stage plays, and invariably about upper classes. I said &#x27;Damn the upper classes - they don&#x27;t even own televisions!&#x27;&quot;He converted &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; into a vehicle for the generation of &quot;Angry Young Men&quot; that was emerging after John Osborne&#x27;s play &quot;Look Back in Anger&quot; (1956) had become a great success, although older writers such as Ted Willis were not excluded. Willis&#x27; 1958 play &quot;Hot Summer Night&quot; (1 February 1959) was adapted to shift its focus, from an unhappy marriage of parents in the original stage version, onto their daughter&#x27;s mixed-race relationship with a Jamaican man and the problems they might face if they got married. It was one of the earliest British television plays to have race as a theme.

===Writers and production staff===
A script editor, Peter Luke, was the first to become aware of the writers Clive Exton, who contributed eight plays to the series, Alun Owen, who wrote &quot;No Trams to Lime Street&quot; (18 October 1959),) and Harold Pinter, who contributed &quot;A Night Out&quot; (24 April 1960).) Owen&#x27;s play was the first of a trilogy transmitted during 1959 and 1960, which was completed by &quot;After the Funeral&quot; (3 April 1960) and &quot;Lena, O My Lena&quot; (26 September 1960).

Ratings for the series were regularly about 15 million with the series frequently in the week&#x27;s top ten; it was broadcast immediately after the variety show &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;. Even so, Pinter once estimated that his stage play &quot;The Caretaker&quot;, enjoying its first run at the time, would have to be performed for thirty years before matching &quot;A Night Out&quot;″s audience of 6,380,000.

The German Jewish dramatist Robert Muller, who had arrived in Britain as a refugee in 1938, contributed seven plays to the series, three being transmitted in 1962 and directed by Philip Saville, including &quot;Afternoon of a Nymph&quot;. Saville worked on more than forty episodes in the series, while Muller&#x27;s wife in his later years, the actress Billie Whitelaw, had a part in eleven episodes.

Newman&#x27;s three-and-a-half-season involvement in &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; concluded at the end of December 1962. He was succeeded by Leonard White, an early producer of &quot;The Avengers&quot;. In &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot;″s last years Lloyd Shirley was the series producer. A holdover from the Newman era, Clive Exton&#x27;s legal satire &quot;The Trial of Dr Fancy&quot; (13 September 1964), was among the first television plays on ITV to be suppressed. The deliberately absurd and savage play was a conscious break on Exton&#x27;s part from the social realism of which he had grown tired. Although the Independent Television Authority (ITA), the regulator of the commercial channel at the time, had not objected to the production, Howard Thomas of ABC feared that it would give offence to viewers. The programme controller at ABC, Brian Tesler, explained the later change of heart: &quot;We believe that the climate of opinion concerning black comedy has changed in the past two years. When the play was recorded we felt that many people might fail to appreciate the compassion which underlies the irony in Mr Exton&#x27;s play.&quot;

Another play from this period was not so lucky. &quot;The Blood Knot&quot; (recorded 18 May 1963), a two-hander by the South African writer Athol Fugard with apartheid as its theme, was never scheduled.

===Spin-offs and influence===
The programme occasionally spun off ideas into full-blown series such as &quot;Armchair Mystery Theatre&quot;, hosted by Donald Pleasence, which specialised in crime and mystery thrillers. A 1962 adaptation of John Wyndham&#x27;s short story &quot;Dumb Martian&quot;, scripted by Clive Exton, was a deliberate showcase for the spin-off science fiction anthology &quot;Out of This World&quot;. Two 1967 episodes became series. One of these was developed into the sitcom &quot;Never Mind the Quality, Feel the Width&quot;, while the other, &quot;A Magnum for Schneider&quot;, became the pilot for the spy series &quot;Callan&quot;.

After the 1968 ITV franchise changes and ABC&#x27;s merger into Thames, the programme continued until 1974. Hugely popular at its peak, with audiences occasionally touching twenty million, &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; had an important influence on later programmes such as the BBC&#x27;s &quot;The Wednesday Play&quot; (1964–70), a series initiated by Sydney Newman after he had moved to the BBC.

Overall, 426 plays were made and broadcast under the &quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; banner between 1956 and 1974. As with much early British television, not all of the plays from the original ABC series survive in the archives, owing either to live plays not being recorded or to recordings being destroyed. Two later Thames series used the &quot;Armchair...&quot; prefix: &quot;Armchair Cinema&quot;, effectively a series of TV movies, and &quot;Armchair Thriller&quot; (1978–80), which used a serial format.

&quot;Armchair Theatre&quot; was satirised on the BBC Radio comedy series &quot;Round the Horne&quot; as &quot;Armpit Theatre&quot;.

<doc id="907172" wikidata="Q63347" url="?curid=907172" title="European Remote-Sensing Satellite">
<text>European Remote Sensing satellite (ERS) was the European Space Agency&#x27;s first Earth-observing satellite programme using a polar orbit. It consisted of two satellites, ERS-1 and ERS-2, with ERS-1 being launched in 1991.

==ERS-1==
ERS-1 launched 17 July 1991 from Guiana Space Centre aboard an Ariane 4 rocket. The satellite was put into a Sun-synchronous polar orbit at an altitude of 782–785 km. ERS-1 failed on 10 March 2000 after nine years in orbit.

===Instruments===
ERS-1 carried an array of Earth-observation instruments that gathered information about the Earth (land, water, ice, and atmosphere) using a variety of measurement principles. These included:
* RA (Radar Altimeter) is a single frequency nadir-pointing radar altimeter operating in the Ku band.
* ATSR-1 (Along-Track Scanning Radiometer) is a 4 channel infrared radiometer and microwave sounder for measuring temperatures at the sea-surface and the top of clouds.
* SAR (synthetic-aperture radar) operating in C band can detect changes in surface heights with sub-millimeter precision.
* Wind Scatterometer used to calculate information on wind speed and direction.
* MWR is a Microwave Radiometer used in measuring atmospheric water, as well as providing a correction for the atmospheric water for the altimeter.

To accurately determine its orbit, the satellite included the PRARE (Precision Range and Range-Rate Equipment) and a laser retroreflector. The PRARE became non-operational shortly after launch; later analysis concluded that the failure was due to a memory latchup caused by radiation. The retroreflector was used for calibrating the radar altimeter to within 10 cm.

===Mission===
ERS-1 had various mission phases using 3-day and 35-day repeat cycles. During the geodetic mission, ERS-1 was put in two long repeat cycles of 168 days, which is equivalent to a single 336-day cycle. The geodetic mission allowed for accurate mapping of the Earth&#x27;s bathymetry and geoid over the seas using the Radar Altimeter.

On 10 March 2000, ERS-1&#x27;s attitude control system failed due to a gyroscope malfunction and its mission was officially declared finished.

==ERS-2==

Its successor, ERS-2, was launched on 21 April 1995, on an Ariane 4, from ESA&#x27;s Guiana Space Centre near Kourou, French Guiana. Largely identical to ERS-1, it added additional instruments and improved existing instruments including:
* GOME (Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment) is a nadir scanning ultraviolet and visible spectrometer.
* ATSR-2 included 3 visible spectrum bands specialized for chlorophyll and vegetation

When ERS-2 was launched, ERS-1 shared the same orbital plane. This allowed a tandem mission, with ERS-2 passing the same point on the ground 1 day later than ERS-1. ERS-2 has a repeat cycle of 35 days.

ERS-2 operated without gyroscopes from February 2001, resulting in some degradation of the data provided by the instruments. The tape drive aboard failed on 22 June 2003, leaving the instruments operating only within visibility of a ground station. After the tape drive failure additional ground stations were brought online to increase the data gathering abilities of the satellite. The Wind Scatterometer and GOME were the only instruments of their kind until the launches of MetOp-A and Envisat, respectively.

The successor to ERS-2 was the Envisat satellite, launched 1 March 2002. Envisat contained improved versions of many of the instruments onboard ERS-2. However, even after the launch of its successor, the operational life of ERS-2 was extended until 2011, when the decision was made to end the mission. Over a series of burns in July, August and September, ERS-2 was finally depleted of all fuel on 5 September 2011. At 13:16:38 the batteries were switched off and the satellite decommissioned. The spacecraft was left in an orbit where it will reenter the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and safely disintegrate within 25 years, in accordance with international standards.

In the final stages of emptying the fuel tanks, it was estimated that they would be empty after a 40-minute burn on 2 September 2011. However, the spacecraft survived both this manoeuvre and a second 40-minute burn on 3 September. On 5 September a third burn was initiated. The fuel tanks were finally drained, and the spacecraft orbit was lowered from 785 to 573 km above Earth.

In February 2024, ESA reported that ERS-2 was expected to reenter in an uncontrolled fashion, some time between 16 February and 22 February 2024.

The satellite reentered at 1717 UTC on 21 February, in the Pacific Ocean between Alaska and Hawaii.

<doc id="907179" wikidata="Q1048188" url="?curid=907179" title="Too Fast for Love">
<text>Too Fast for Love is the debut studio album by American heavy metal band Mötley Crüe. The first edition of 900 copies was released on November 10, 1981, on the band&#x27;s original label Leathür Records. Elektra Records signed the band the following year, at which point the album was remixed and partially re-recorded. This re-release, with a different track listing and slightly different artwork (e.g., red lettering on the cover and a different interior photograph of the band), has become the standard version from which all later reissues derive. The re-recorded album also removed the song &quot;Stick to Your Guns&quot;, though it is featured on a bonus track version of the album. The original mix of the album remained unreleased on CD until 2002, when it was included in the &quot;Music to Crash Your Car To: Vol. 1&quot; box set compilation.

While the album only reached number 77 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart in the United States, it would ultimately reach platinum status.

The songs &quot;Stick to Your Guns&quot; and &quot;Live Wire&quot; were released as singles for the album. The cover is an homage to The Rolling Stones&#x27; 1971 album &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;.

==Release history==
The first recording session was in October 1981, a half year after the band first played the Starwood nightclub. They recorded for a few days with engineer Avi Kipper at Hit City West, a small studio in the Hollywood district of Los Angeles.

There are three known vinyl pressings of the Leathür Records version, along with one known cassette. The first vinyl pressing had white lettering on the cover and the record label was white with black lettering. The back cover photo of Vince Neil shows him with a large airbrushed hairdo. The second pressing has red lettering on the cover and the record label is again white with black lettering. The second pressing has a slightly different photo insert of the band. The third pressing has red lettering on the cover and the record label is black with white lettering.

The album was remixed under the supervision of Roy Thomas Baker and rereleased on August 20, 1982, by Elektra Records, with whom the band signed its first recording contract. The Elektra version had a different track order and omitted &quot;Stick to Your Guns&quot;, as well as the first verse from the title track. In addition, a re-recorded (and shorter) version of &quot;Come On and Dance&quot; appears on the re-release. However, the initial release of the album on Elektra in Canada (on both vinyl and cassette) was not the remixed version, but instead the original Leathür version with an Elektra label on it, and it included &quot;Stick to Your Guns&quot;. This was released two months before the remixed version was released by Elektra worldwide, because Mötley Crüe was about to embark on a Canadian tour and Elektra wanted to ensure a product was available while the band was in the country. When the remixed version was completed, later Canadian pressings were the same as the Elektra version everywhere else. &quot;It was amazing because everyone had passed on us first time around...&quot; Neil observed in 2000. &quot;We were just happy that someone was prepared to mass-produce our records and that we could go out on real tours.&quot;

In 1996, Mötley Crüe and Elektra split. The band once again formed their own record company, Mötley Records, and rereleased all the albums before &quot;New Tattoo&quot;. The 2002 version of &quot;Too Fast for Love&quot; adds the Leathür version of &quot;Too Fast for Love&quot;, &quot;Stick to Your Guns&quot; (omitted from the Elektra release), &quot;Toast of the Town&quot; (previously released as a B-side to Leathür&#x27;s &quot;Stick to Your Guns&quot; single), the Raspberries cover song &quot;Tonight&quot; and a live version of &quot;Merry-Go-Round&quot;.

==Reception==

&quot;Too Fast for Love&quot; has received mostly positive reviews. AllMusic reviewer Steve Huey gave the album a rating of four stars and claims that &quot;Mötley Crüe essentially comes across as a bash-&#x27;em-out bar band, making up in enthusiasm what they lack in technical skill&quot;. 

&quot;Too Fast for Love&quot; was also the earliest of seven consecutive Mötley Crüe studio albums to be certified gold or platinum by the RIAA―every album up to and including &quot;Generation Swine&quot; (1997) is at least certified gold.

<doc id="907187" wikidata="Q1399112" url="?curid=907187" title="John Bunny">
<text>John Bunny (September 21, 1863 – April 26, 1915) was an American actor. Bunny began his career as a stage actor, but transitioned to a film career after joining Vitagraph Studios around 1910. At Vitagraph, Bunny made over 150 short films – many of them domestic comedies with the comedian Flora Finch – and became one of the most well-known actors of his era.

==Life and career==
Bunny was born in Brooklyn, New York and educated in New York public schools. The son of an English father and an Irish mother, he initially worked as a clerk in a general store before joining a small minstrel show at the age of twenty. In a stage career spanning twenty-five years, Bunny worked for a number of touring and stock theater companies, with stints in Portland, Seattle, and various cities on the east coast. Bunny eventually worked his way into Broadway, where he was in productions such as &quot;Aunt Hannah&quot; (1900), &quot;Easy Dawson&quot; (1905), and the Astor Theatre&#x27;s inaugural production of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1906), where his performance as Bottom garnered acclaim.

In a 1915 interview, Bunny recounted how he decided to enter the film industry after determining that &quot;it was the &#x27;movies&#x27; that were the main cause of the lean times on stage.&quot; Bunny offered his services to Vitagraph Studios, but was refused a job because the studio manager believed he could not offer Bunny a high enough salary. Bunny, however, insisted on taking the lower pay and began working at Vitagraph Studios around 1910, where he went on to star in over 150 films. At Vitagraph, Bunny was often paired with the comedian Flora Finch, with whom he made many popular comedies – often featuring situational humor in a domestic setting, in contrast with the rowdier slapstick style used in some films at the time – that came to be known as &quot;Bunnygraphs&quot; or &quot;Bunnyfinches&quot;. According to the Library of Congress, the Bunnygraph genre was exemplified by &quot;A Cure for Pokeritis&quot; (1912), which features the efforts of a wife to put a stop to her husband&#x27;s gambling habit by organizing a fake police raid on his weekly poker game.


Regarding a career as a film actor, Bunny said:

There&#x27;s nothing like it. No other work gives an actor or would-be actor the same advantages. In the pictures, a player gets fifty-two weeks in the year. Where is the theatrical manager who can offer that? Not even vaudeville stars can get such bookings. At best, thirty weeks is about all an actor can expect on the stage. He may get summer stock work, but even so it is of uncertain duration. Stage work is a gamble. Even when you have been engaged for a production, rehearsed from three to six weeks without pay, and no doubt bought your own costumes for the piece, you have no guarantee that it will be a success. If the public does not set its stamp of approval, your job is all over perhaps after but one performance, and you can only repeat the procedure by trying again with someone else, charging the other to your loss account, with a credit notation probably on the page marked &#x27;experience.&#x27;

Bunny had been acting in films for only five years when he died from Bright&#x27;s disease at his home in Brooklyn on April 26, 1915. He was survived by his wife and two sons and interred in the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York.

==Reception and legacy==
Bunny was one of the most well known film actors of his lifetime. A &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial published after Bunny&#x27;s death noted that thousands recognized him as &quot;the living symbol of wholesome merriment&quot;, and declared: &quot;Wherever movies are exhibited, and that is everywhere, Bunny had his public. It is perfectly safe to say that no other camera actor was as popular in this country.&quot; The actress Frances Agnew wrote in 1913 that &quot;Mr. Bunny&#x27;s name is a household word, not only from coast to coast in America, but also in every city and town in the world at all acquainted with the &#x27;movies&#x27;&quot;. An article published in London&#x27;s &quot;Daily News&quot; recounted the enthusiastic reception Bunny received while filming &quot;The Pickwick Papers&quot; in England and how his fame was such that a heavy-set member of King George V&#x27;s entourage was mistaken for the actor while the King was visiting Scotland.

Bunny&#x27;s skills as an actor were praised by his contemporaries. In particular, his ability to convey emotion without the use of words drew comment from critics. John Palmer of the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; declared, &quot;Mr. Bunny has an extensive and extremely flexible face. ... We know at once why Mr. Bunny never speaks. He could not possibly find words to convey the extremity of his feelings.&quot; According to &quot;The New York World&quot;, &quot;The advent of the film drama found [Bunny] particularly well endowed for the new art of acting without words. The range of his facial expression was altogether wonderful, and when the emotion of the moment had told its story in his features there was nothing left for the words to do.&quot; The poet and writer Joyce Kilmer wrote glowingly of Bunny&#x27;s acting ability, and claimed that Bunny was responsible for reviving the art of pantomime.

A 1916 &quot;Washington Times&quot; article claimed: &quot;To John Bunny ... must be given the credit of presenting the first bits of refined comedy in photoplay. Previous to his advent into screenland film comedies were either &quot;chases&quot; or grotesque trick photography. He rescued screen humor from the chamber of horrors and placed it in the hall of fame&quot;. In the words of his contemporary Henry Lanier, Bunny demonstrated &quot;that a real actor can make an incredible success before [a film] audience without any of the vulgarity or horseplay which used to be considered essential.&quot; This assessment is echoed by the modern film scholar Wes Gehring, who writes that &quot;Bunny helped elevate at the time what was still often considered a second-class medium to a level of artistic significance&quot;.

According to Frank Scheide, Bunny&#x27;s films might have been taken more seriously because &quot;Bunny&#x27;s humor was based more on comedy of manners than slapstick&quot;, a &quot;polite&quot; and &quot;respectable&quot; form of situational comedy in contrast to the &quot;decidedly lowbrow, crass, and often violent&quot; humor of slapstick films. According to Gehring, Bunny was &quot;the first in a long line of American personality screen comedians&quot;, whose approach is marked by a &quot;subordination of story to character&quot;. The personality focus of Bunny&#x27;s films was also noted by the screenwriter Catherine Carr, who wrote in 1914: &quot;In most big companies at the present day there are maintained actors around whose personality comedies are being written; i.e., John Bunny, Flora Finch, etc. These actors take the mere germ of a comedy and develop it through their clever acting into a screen production that brings laughter wherever it is shown.&quot; Modern viewers may not find Bunny&#x27;s films as funny as Carr described, however. The film scholar Anthony Slide, for instance, writes that Bunny&#x27;s &quot;characterizations contain nothing creative, and he uses no knockabout or slapstick comedy. His comedy is all very middle class and very polite. Often so dull is the storyline that the comedy is difficult to uncover. Time and again one wonders if audiences ever did laugh at his work, and, if so, why?&quot;

Despite his genial on-screen persona, Bunny was disliked by some of his fellow actors at Vitagraph. Bunny and Finch &quot;cordially hated each other&quot; according to Vitagraph&#x27;s co-founder Albert E. Smith, and interviews of former Vitagraph personnel revealed that some found him to be arrogant and difficult to work with.

In 1918, after Bunny&#x27;s passing, Samuel Goldwyn signed George Bunny, John&#x27;s brother, for films but the attempt was not successful. New comedians came to the fore in silent film and John Bunny faded into obscurity. However, in 1960 he was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame (though he made most of his movies in the East) for his contributions to the film industry with a motion pictures star located at 1715 Vine Street in Hollywood.

<text>Propellerheads were an English electronic music duo, formed in 1995 in Bath by Will White and Alex Gifford.

==History==
Prior to Propellerheads&#x27; formation, Alex Gifford played as a backing saxophonist for The Stranglers appearing on the albums &quot;Dreamtime&quot; (1986) and &quot;10&quot; (1990) as well as the live album &quot;All Live and All of the Night&quot; (1988).

Their first release was an EP named &quot;Dive!&quot;, released in 1996 through the independent label Wall of Sound. They gained fame the next year by providing a remix for James Bond movie composer David Arnold&#x27;s Bond tribute album &quot;Shaken &amp; Stirred: The David Arnold James Bond Project&quot; covering John Barry&#x27;s &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, the theme song to the sixth James Bond film, re-orchestrated by Arnold. They also collaborated with Arnold on the track &quot;Backseat Driver&quot; for the soundtrack of the Bond film &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;. The single &quot;History Repeating&quot; followed, a collaboration with Shirley Bassey (also well known for her James Bond music), fusing big beat with jazz. 

The Propellerheads album &quot;Decksandrumsandrockandroll&quot; was released in 1998 by Wall of Sound in Europe and DreamWorks in the US and Japan. The DreamWorks versions include collaborations with hip hop artists De La Soul and Jungle Brothers, and the Japanese version is a two disc special edition including some of their earlier singles. A track from the album, &quot;Spybreak!&quot;, became widely known after its use in the lobby scene in the 1999 feature film &quot;The Matrix&quot;. They are also noted for providing &quot;Crash&quot; (a remixed cover version of Brass Incorporated&#x27;s &quot;At the Sign of the Swinging Cymbal&quot;, perhaps best known as the theme song of BBC Radio 1&#x27;s Pick of the Pops) as the theme tune to Radio 1&#x27;s &#x27;Official Chart Show&#x27; between 1998 and 2002, when Mark Goodier was the host. This song was also used in the 1999 hit comedy film &quot;Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me&quot;.

After touring for their hit album, White fell ill. They released &quot;Extended Play EP&quot; in 1998, and in the song &quot;Props&#x27; Vote of Gratitude&quot;, Alex Gifford raps for the first time, explaining to the listener that the band would &quot;be back after this short break&quot;. Gifford moved to New York and produced the Jungle Brothers&#x27; 1999 album &quot;V.I.P.&quot;, in which he raps with The Black Eyed Peas among others. White provided the drums for the eponymous track. He has also produced &quot;Shadows&quot;, a track for Rufus Wainwright on his 2001 album &quot;Poses&quot;. White has since released a mix compilation for the &quot;Beatz and Bobz&quot; series, and he has also appeared as a member of the De-Fex music project.

In November 1998, the song &quot;Bang On!&quot; was included in the Nintendo 64 video game &quot;Wipeout 64&quot;. Earlier that same year, the same song was also featured on the &quot;Lost in Space&quot; soundtrack. &quot;Bang On!&quot; would later be featured in the 2001 Xbox video game &quot;Mad Dash Racing&quot; as part of the game console&#x27;s launch into the American market. Another song &quot;Lethal Cut&quot; was featured in the PlayStation game &quot;Wipeout 3&quot;, while &quot;Big Dog&quot; was featured in the background music of the PAL version of &quot;Gran Turismo 2&quot;.

Following their 1997 collaboration, in 2000, Propellerheads again worked with Shirley Bassey, this time remixing her 1964 song, &quot;Goldfinger&quot;. This version was included on Bassey&#x27;s remix album, &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;.

In 2001, the band recorded &quot;Star Crossed Lovers&quot; with Martha Wainwright for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Red Hot + Indigo&quot;, a tribute to Duke Ellington, which raised money for various charities devoted to increasing AIDS awareness and fighting the disease.

In October 2003, Wall of Sound commemorated its tenth birthday. To commemorate the occasion, the label released a two disc album charting ten years of its pioneering British music. The first CD featured Röyksopp, The Wiseguys and Mekon, while Gifford provided a mix CD for the second disc. The first track on that disc, &quot;Ten Years (Johnston&#x27;s Strut, Part 1)&quot;, was a new song by Propellerheads featuring the Brooklyn-based writer Livingroom Johnston.

One of the trailers for the Disney/Pixar film &quot;The Incredibles&quot; featured &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;.

Their version of &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; featured as a choice of Horizon presenter Kevin Fong on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, as this was the track he played every morning when driving to the Kennedy Space Center while working with NASA.

White was part of the live incarnation of Long Range, the now defunct project of Phil Hartnoll of Orbital.

<text>Look What the Cat Dragged In is the debut studio album by American glam metal band Poison, released on May 23 1986, by Enigma Records and Capitol Records. Though not a success at first, it steadily built momentum and peaked at #3 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on May 23, 1987. The album spawned three successful singles: &quot;Talk Dirty to Me&quot;, &quot;I Want Action&quot;, and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Forget You&quot;.

&quot;Look What the Cat Dragged In&quot; was certified Gold in 1987 and 3× Platinum in 1990 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It has also been certified silver by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), and platinum in Canada.

==Production and marketing==
The record was described by vocalist Bret Michaels as a &quot;glorified demo&quot;. It was recorded in twelve days at Los Angeles&#x27; Music Grinder Studios with producer Ric Browde, for a cost of US$23,000, part of which was funded from the pockets of the band members and their families.

==Background==
It originally included only one single, &quot;Cry Tough&quot;; however, &quot;Look What the Cat Dragged In&quot; became a surprise success and subsequently spawned three more charting hits: &quot;Talk Dirty to Me&quot;, &quot;I Want Action&quot;, and &quot;I Won&#x27;t Forget You&quot;, The record became the biggest-selling-album in Enigma&#x27;s history. With heavy rotation on MTV, their debut earned the band tours with fellow glam rockers Ratt, Cinderella, and Quiet Riot, as well as a coveted slot in the Texxas Jam in Dallas. The album ultimately sold 4 million copies worldwide.

==Reissues==
In 2006, a 20th Anniversary edition was released by Capitol; this version added single versions of two of the album&#x27;s tracks and a cover of Jim Croce&#x27;s &quot;You Don&#x27;t Mess Around with Jim&quot; as bonus tracks.

<text>Mohammad Hatta ( ; 12 August 1902 – 14 March 1980) was an Indonesian statesman, nationalist, and independence activist who served as the country&#x27;s first vice president as well as the third prime minister. Known as &quot;The Proclamator&quot;, he and a number of Indonesians, including the first president of Indonesia, Sukarno, fought for the independence of Indonesia from the Netherlands. Hatta was an important figure during the Indonesian national awakening and during the national revolution. As a youth he was politically active in both the Netherlands and the Indies, which led him to be imprisoned in the Boven Digoel concentration camp for his activism. He also played a crucial role in the proclamation of Indonesian independence, being the second person to sign the declaration besides Sukarno, thus making him one of the founders of Indonesia.

==Early life, family, and early education==
=== Early life and family ===

Hatta was born in Fort De Kock (now known as Bukittinggi) on 12 August 1902 into a prominent and strongly Islamic family. His grandfather, Sheikh Abdurrahman, was a respected Naqshbandi-Khalidi murshid in Batuhampar, near Payakumbuh. His father, Haji Mohammad Djamil, died when he was eight months old and he was left with his six sisters and his mother. As in the matrilineal society of Minangkabau tradition, he was then raised in his mother&#x27;s family. His mother&#x27;s family was wealthy, and Hatta was able to study Dutch as well as finishing Qur&#x27;an after school.

=== Early education ===
He went to the Dutch language elementary school (ELS or &quot;Europeesche Lagere School&quot;) in Padang from 1913 to 1916 after he had finished &quot;Sekolah Melayu&quot; (&#x27;Malay School&#x27;) in Bukittinggi. When he was thirteen, he passed an exam that entitled him to enroll in the Dutch secondary school (HBS or &quot;Hogere burgerschool&quot;) in Batavia (now Jakarta). However his mother asked him to stay in Padang because he was still too young to go to the capital alone. Hatta then entered junior secondary school or MULO (&quot;Meer Uitgebreid Lager Onderwijs&quot;).

During his spare time, he worked part-time in a post office. Normally, MULO students were not allowed to work, but he was able to work there because of the HBS exam qualification. Hatta was interested in football; he joined his school&#x27;s football team and was made its chairman. He broadened his sphere of contacts by using his position.

Hatta used to visit the office of the &quot;Sarikat Usaha&quot; (United Endeavor), led by Taher Marah Soetan. In the office, he read Dutch newspapers, particularly about political debates in the &quot;Volksraad&quot; (parliament) of the Dutch East Indies. It was at the age of sixteen that Hatta began to be interested in politics and national movements. He was chosen the treasurer of the branch of the &quot;Jong Sumatranen Bond&quot; (or youth association of Sumatra), which was first established in Padang in 1918.

==Time in the Netherlands==
=== Later education ===

In 1919, Hatta finally went to the HBS in Batavia. He completed his study with distinction in 1921, and was allowed to continue to study at Erasmus University Rotterdam (then known as the Netherlands School of Commerce) in Rotterdam. He took economics as his major and earned a &quot;doctorandus&quot; degree in 1932. The degree entitled him to follow a doctorate program. He then continued to pursue the doctorate degree, and completed all requirements to be awarded it, but he never finished his thesis. Politics had taken over Hatta&#x27;s life.

=== Struggle for independence in the Netherlands ===

In the Netherlands, Hatta joined the &quot;Indische Vereeniging&quot; (or the Indies&#x27; Association). In 1922, the organization changed its name to &quot;Indonesische Vereeniging&quot; and later to its Indonesian translation: the &quot;Perhimpoenan Indonesia&quot;. Hatta was the treasurer (1922–1925), and then the chairman (1926–1930). On his inauguration, Hatta delivered a speech with the title of &quot;The Economic World Structure and the Conflict of Power&quot;, in which he supported the idea of Indonesian non-cooperation with the Dutch colonial government in order to gain its independence. The &quot;Perhimpoenan Indonesia&quot; then changed from being a student organization into a political organization and had an unequivocal demand for Indonesia&#x27;s independence. It expressed its voice through the magazine called &quot;Indonesia Merdeka&quot; (or Free Indonesia) of which Hatta was the editor.

To gain more support from other nations, Hatta attended congresses all over Europe, always as the chairman of the Indonesian delegation. In 1926, Hatta and &quot;Perhimpoenan Indonesia&quot; joined the (sixth) International Democratic Congress for Peace in Marc Sangnier&#x27;s domaine de Bierville (Boissy-la-Rivière), France. In February 1927, Hatta went to Brussels to attend a congress held by the League Against Imperialism and Colonial Oppression. He met many other prominent nationalists there, including Jawaharlal Nehru from India, Mohammad Hafiz Ramadan Bey from Egypt and Lamine Senghor from Senegal. Later in the year, Hatta attended another congress held by the International Women&#x27;s League for Peace and Freedom in Switzerland. On that occasion, Hatta delivered a speech with the title of &quot;Indonesia and her Independence Problem&quot;.

By the middle of 1927, &quot;Perhimpoenan Indonesia&quot;″s activities had alarmed the Dutch authorities. In June 1927, Dutch authorities raided the residence of the organization&#x27;s leaders, searching through their rooms and putting Hatta and other four other Indonesian activists behind bars. After spending nearly six months in prison, they were taken to trial in the Hague. They were permitted to explain themselves during the hearing, and Hatta took to the opportunity to explain Indonesia&#x27;s nationalist cause. He made a speech to the court explaining that Indonesia&#x27;s interests were in conflict with those of the Dutch, and that was why they could not cooperate.

Hatta advocated cooperation between Indonesia and the Netherlands, but only if Indonesia was independent and treated as an equal partner, not unequally because of its status as a colony. The speech became famous and it is known as the &quot;Indonesia Vrij&quot; (Indonesia Merdeka) or Free Indonesia speech. In 1929, Hatta and other &quot;Perhimpoenan Indonesia&quot; activists were released. In July 1932, Hatta made his way home to Indonesia.

==Return to Indonesia==
===Struggle in the Dutch East Indies===
==== The Indonesian National Party ====
Hatta returned home in 1932 to an Indonesia whose nationalist momentum had been slowed down by the arrest and imprisonment of Sukarno. By the time Hatta had returned, most of the members of Sukarno&#x27;s PNI had joined the Indonesia Party (Partindo) and more radical PNI members, together with the Dutch-educated Sutan Sjahrir had banded together to form the New PNI. Although the initials were the same, the PNI in this case stood for the Indonesian National Education, indicating that it would focus on cadre training. In August 1932, after returning from the Netherlands, Hatta became the chairman of the New PNI.

In December 1932, Sukarno was finally released from prison and the attention now turned to which party Sukarno would choose. Sukarno, who had wanted one united front to gain Indonesia&#x27;s independence was uncertain, thinking that in choosing one over the other, he would encourage division. In this, he was criticized by Hatta, who was more pragmatic about differences, in this case the conflict between Partindo&#x27;s radical and mass party approach versus the New PNI&#x27;s moderate and cadre party approach. Sukarno insisted on negotiations to unify Partindo and New PNI but after failing, chose to join Partindo.

Between 1932 and 1933, Hatta wrote articles on politics and economics for the New PNI&#x27;s newspaper &quot;Daulat Rakyat&quot; (The People&#x27;s Authority). These articles were aimed at training new cadres for Indonesia&#x27;s leadership.

Hatta seemed to be extremely critical of Sukarno at this point in time. In August 1933, with Sukarno once again arrested and facing trial, he wrote an article called &quot;Sukarno Is Arrested&quot;. This was followed by articles entitled &quot;The Tragedy of Sukarno&quot; (November 1933) and &quot;The Stance of a Leader&quot; (December 1933).

==== Arrest and exile ====
The Dutch colonial government gave Sukarno a harsh punishment, exiling him to Ende on the island of Flores in December 1933. With Sukarno in exile, the Dutch colonial government now turned their eyes to the New PNI and its leadership. In February 1934, they made their move and arrested its leaders from its Jakarta branch (which included Hatta) and its Bandung branch. For a year they were jailed at prisons in Cipinang and Glodok, with Hatta spending his time in Glodok. During his time in prison, Hatta wrote a book entitled &quot;The Economical Crisis and Capitalism&quot;.

In January 1935, it was decided that Hatta and his fellow New PNI leaders (including Syahrir) would be exiled to Boven Digoel in Papua. When Hatta arrived there, he was told by the local authorities that he had two options. The first option was to work for the Dutch Colonial Government as a civil servant for 40 cents a day with the hope of returning from exile, and the second option was being an exile, receiving food but having no hope of returning from exile. Hatta commented if he had decided to take a job as a civil servant in Jakarta, he would have earned a lot of money and knowing that, there was no need to go to Boven Digoel to be paid cheaply. In saying this, Hatta chose the second option.During his exile, Hatta continued to write articles, this time for the Newspaper &quot;Pemandangan&quot; (The View). He earned enough money from that to make ends meet at Boven Digoel and to support his colleagues who had financial troubles. Hatta also used his books (which filled 16 chests when they were packed to leave Jakarta) to give his colleagues lessons on economics, history, and philosophy. Later on these lessons would be made into books entitled &quot;An Introduction on the Way to Knowledge&quot; and &quot;The Nature of Greek Thought&quot; (four volumes).
In January 1936, Hatta and Syahrir were transferred to Bandaneira in Maluku. There they joined more nationalists such as Iwa Kusumasumantri and Dr. Cipto Mangunkusumo. Hatta and Syahrir were given more freedom and were able to interact with the locals. Hatta and Syahrir also gave lessons to the local children, teaching them about politics and history. Hatta adopted a local boy, Des Alwi, as his son while living in Bandaneira. Alwi would become a prominent Indonesian historian and diplomat. In February 1942, Hatta and Syahrir were transferred to Sukabumi in West Java.

=== Japanese occupation ===
==== Japanese invasion ====
By 1942, World War II was well under way and the Empire of Japan was fulfilling its imperial ambitions in East Asia and Southeast Asia. In March 1942, they began landing in Indonesia. Like their counterpart in Europe, the Dutch colonial government crumbled in the face of the invaders and by 9 March 1942, surrendered. On 22 March 1942, Hatta and Syahrir were again transferred to Jakarta.

In Jakarta, Hatta met with Major General , the interim head of government. Harada asked Hatta to become an advisor for the occupational Government. Hatta accepted the job and then asked Harada if Japan was here to colonize Indonesia. Harada assured Hatta that Japan would not do. In Hatta&#x27;s eyes, an acknowledgement of an Indonesian independence by Japan was extremely important. If Japan, with its ultra-nationalistic ideology was able to recognize Indonesia&#x27;s independence, it would put more pressure on the Allies (especially the United States and the United Kingdom) as representatives of democracy to do the same thing. In July 1942, Hatta was reunited with Sukarno who after Flores had been transferred to Sumatra before the Japanese arrived, and had also been asked for his services. Although they had left off on a bad note, Sukarno wanted to speak with Hatta before speaking with anyone else. In a secret meeting at Hatta&#x27;s Jakarta home Sukarno, Hatta and Sjahrir agreed that Sjahrir would go underground to organise the revolutionary resistance while the other two would commence their cooperation with the Japanese occupier.

==== Collaboration with the Japanese ====
Hatta and Sukarno now had the common goal of working with the Japanese and then trying to achieve independence from them. Together with Ki Hadjar Dewantoro and Muhammadiyah chairman, Kiai Haji Mas Mansur, Hatta and Sukarno formed a quattuorvirate of leaders tasked by the Japanese occupational Government as their intermediary with the Indonesian people. Hatta together with the other members of the quattuorvirate worked with much fervor under the Japanese government. They echoed Japanese propaganda and presented the Japanese Empire as the protector, leader, and the light of Asia. At the same time however, Hatta continued to promote Indonesia&#x27;s desire for independence. In a speech in December 1942, Hatta said that Indonesia had been freed from the Dutch colonial government, but if they were freed only to be colonized by another power, he would rather see Indonesia drown to the bottom of the ocean.

On 9 March 1943, the Japanese occupational government approved the formation of the Centre of People&#x27;s Power (Putera) with Hatta and the other quattuorvirate as the co-chairmen of the association. Sukarno thought that this would be a way from which they could gain support for independence, instead the Japanese used this to their own cause and to start their &quot;romusha&quot; (forced labour) regime in Indonesia. On 4 October 1943, Hatta, along with Sukarno and other nationalist figures was appointed to the Javanese Central Advisory Council, which was by set up the occupation government. In November 1943, Hatta and Sukarno&#x27;s efforts in cooperating with the Japanese occupational government was recognized by Emperor Hirohito who decorated them with awards in Tokyo.

As the tide of the war began to turn against the Japanese, the Japanese occupational government in Indonesia became desperate to maintain control. Putera was disbanded and replaced with Djawa Hokokai in March 1944. Although still chaired by Sukarno, the Indonesians had less freedom of movement than they had had in Putera. When defeat began looming on the horizon, Prime Minister Kuniaki Koiso announced in September 1944 that Japan would grant Indonesia its independence in the near future. From then on, momentum began to gather for the independence of Indonesia, fuelled by the nationalist sentiments of Indonesians and supported by sympathizers from Japan such as Rear Admiral Tadashi Maeda. In Maeda&#x27;s case, he even set up a discussion forum called the Free Indonesia Centre and invited Hatta and Sukarno along to deliver lectures on nationalism. This was followed in April 1945, by the formation of the Investigating Committee for Preparatory Work for Independence (BPUPK), which would meet over the next three months and would decide on things such as the constitution and which territories would be part of Indonesia.

==Proclamation of independence==
By August 1945, as Japan was on the eve of defeat, the administration finally approved Indonesian Independence and formed the Preparatory Committee for Indonesian Independence (PPKI) to supervise it. On 8 August 1945, Hatta and Sukarno were summoned to Saigon, to meet with Marshal Terauchi, the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese forces in South East Asia. Terauchi told Hatta and Sukarno that the PPKI would be formed on 18 August and that Indonesia would be independent with Japanese supervision.

=== Japanese surrender ===
Hatta and Sukarno returned to Indonesia on 14 August. In Hatta&#x27;s case, Syahrir was waiting for him with news of the atomic bombs in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Syahrir told Hatta that they would have to encourage Sukarno to proclaim Indonesia&#x27;s independence immediately, because in a couple of days the Japanese might not be there to provide supervision. Syahrir told Hatta not to worry about the Japanese authorities because the people would be on their side. Syahrir and Hatta then went to see Sukarno, with Syahrir repeating his argument in front of Sukarno. Hatta then spoke out, saying that he was worried the Allies would see them as Japanese collaborators. Sukarno shared this sentiment and Syahrir left the meeting out of frustration.

The next day, on 15 August 1945, Japan surrendered to the Allies. In Indonesia, the news was only a rumor and had not been confirmed. Hatta and Sukarno went to the office of the Japanese occupational government in Jakarta, only to find it empty. Hatta and Sukarno then went to Maeda who confirmed that Japan had surrendered to the Allies. Hatta and Sukarno seemed shocked that Japan had surrendered. During the afternoon, Hatta and Sukarno were confronted by Indonesian youths who wanted independence to be proclaimed as soon as possible. A heated exchange followed, with Sukarno telling the youths to have more patience. Hatta, who was aware of this and Sukarno&#x27;s superiority in the exchange, sarcastically commented on the youths&#x27; inability to proclaim independence without Sukarno.

=== Kidnapping and proclamation ===
On the morning of 16 August 1945, Indonesian youths kidnapped both Hatta and Sukarno and took them to the town of Rengasdengklok where they continued trying to force Hatta and Sukarno to declare independence, but without success. In Jakarta, there was panic as the PPKI was due to start meeting that day and had planned to elect Sukarno as chairman and Hatta as vice chairman. When knowledge of Hatta and Sukarno&#x27;s whereabouts became available and the Japanese surrender was confirmed, Achmad Subardjo, a PPKI representative, went to Rengasdengklok to break the news to Hatta and Sukarno. That night, Hatta and Sukarno returned to Jakarta where, at Maeda&#x27;s house, they worked on the Proclamation of Independence. Finally, on 17 August 1945, at Sukarno&#x27;s residence, Indonesia&#x27;s independence was finally proclaimed in a short statement on paper signed by both Sukarno and Hatta.

=== Election as vice president ===
On 18 August 1945, Hatta was selected as Indonesia&#x27;s first vice president by the PPKI to accompany Sukarno, who had been elected as the nation&#x27;s first president. Hatta would make three important decisions in the republic&#x27;s early days. On 16 October, an edict issued by Hatta gave the Central National Committee of Indonesia (KNIP) legislative powers in addition to its advisory role to the president. In the same month, Hatta also authorized the formation of political parties in Indonesia. The next month, in November, Hatta also made the decision which took away the president&#x27;s role as Head of Government and transferred it to a prime minister. Hatta was able to make these crucial decisions because Sukarno was unable to attend the meetings in question, leaving Hatta in charge. For his part, Sukarno did not seem to have a problem with Hatta&#x27;s decisions, at least not during the War of Independence.

==National revolution==
=== Early revolution ===
When the Dutch began sending their troops back to Indonesia, Hatta, together with Syahrir and Sukarno, all agreed that a diplomatic solution should be worked out. This caused tensions with more radical elements within the government such as youth leaders Chairul Saleh and Adam Malik. In January 1946, Hatta and Sukarno moved to Yogyakarta, leaving Syahrir (who was by then prime minister) to head negotiations in Jakarta.

By the end of 1946, the diplomatic solution which Hatta and Sukarno had been looking for seemed to have been found. The Linggadjati Agreement, signed in November 1946, called for Dutch recognition of the Republic of Indonesia. However, territorial recognition would only be over Java, Sumatra, and Madura. In addition, this republic would be part of a United States of Indonesia with the Queen of the Netherlands acting as the Head of State. However, before the agreement was finally ratified by the Dutch House of Representatives, some compromises were made without the consent of the republic. In turn, Indonesia refused to implement its part of the deal, resulting in the first &quot;Police Action&quot; in July 1947.

During this time, Hatta was sent out of the country to look for support for Indonesia. One country that he went to was India, the homeland of his old friend, Nehru. Disguised as an airplane co-pilot, Hatta sneaked out of the country to ask for assistance. There he asked Nehru and Mahatma Gandhi for help. Nehru assured him that India would support Indonesia and would make the support known at international forums such as the United Nations (UN).

In December 1947, negotiations were held aboard and an agreement was signed in January 1948. This agreement was more favorable towards the Dutch and called for the republic to recognize the territories which the Dutch had taken during the first &quot;Police Action&quot;. The agreement caused outrage and caused Amir Sjarifuddin to resign from his position as prime minister.

=== Prime ministership ===
To replace Syarifuddin, Sukarno appointed Hatta as prime minister and declared that the cabinet would be an emergency one and would be answerable to the President instead of the KNIP. Hatta also took on the position of minister of defense. As prime minister, Hatta had to make an unpopular decision. In August 1948, with the republic struggling to pay its troops, Hatta was forced to demobilize some soldiers.

In December 1948, the Dutch launched their second &quot;Police Action&quot; and focused their attack on Yogyakarta. Hatta and Sukarno, instead of running away to fight guerrilla warfare chose to remain in the city and were arrested. Sukarno transferred authority to the Emergency Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PDRI), before going into exile with all the other Republican leaders. Hatta was sent to Bangka.
Resistance continued under General Sudirman and TNI troops who fought a guerrilla war against the Dutch. In March, Sultan Hamengkubuwono IX organized 1 March General Offensive, in which the city of Yogyakarta was held by Indonesian forces for six hours. This played an important role in causing international pressure to be put on the Netherlands. In May 1949, the Roem–Van Roijen Agreement was signed and the Netherlands promised to return the leaders of the Republican Government. In July 1949, Hatta and Sukarno made their return to Yogyakarta.
In August 1949, Hatta headed a delegation to the Hague for a Round Table conference. In November 1949, the formation of the United States of Indonesia was finally agreed. It was to be a federation consisting of the Republic and 15 States which the Dutch had created during the National Revolution. The Queen of the Netherlands would continue to become the symbolic head of state while Sukarno and Hatta would continue as president and vice president. On 27 December 1949, the Dutch authorities finally recognized Indonesian sovereignty. Hatta continued on as the Prime Minister of the United States of Indonesia and presided over the transition of the federal state to the unitary state, which was made official on 17 August 1950.

== Vice presidency (1945–1956) ==
===Intellectual pursuits and cooperatives===
Indonesia soon adopted a constitution which advocated parliamentary democracy and reduced the president to the role of a ceremonial head of state. That left Hatta with little to do as vice president, especially since his term as prime minister was not renewed.

For his remaining time as vice president, Hatta was regularly invited to deliver lectures in universities. He also engaged in intellectual pursuits, writing essays and books about topics such as the economy and cooperatives. The idea of cooperatives being an integral part of economy would become a pet project for Hatta and he would become an enthusiastic promoter of the idea. In July 1951, on the occasion of Cooperatives Day, Hatta went on the radio to deliver a speech on cooperatives. In 1953, Hatta&#x27;s contribution towards promoting cooperatives was recognized and he was given the title &quot;Father of Indonesian Cooperatives&quot; at the Indonesian Cooperative Congress.

===Setting Indonesia&#x27;s foreign policy doctrine===
Aside from cooperatives, Hatta&#x27;s other main contribution to Indonesia governance was the setting of the nation&#x27;s foreign policy doctrine. In 1948, Hatta delivered a speech called &quot;Rowing Between Two Rocks&quot;. In it, he referred to the Cold War and the conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union. Hatta said that Indonesian foreign policy has to look after its own interest first, not that of the US and the USSR. In saying this, Hatta wanted Indonesia to be independent in deciding its stance during the Cold War. Hatta also added that Indonesia should be an active participant in world politics so that once again it would be Indonesia&#x27;s interests that came first. This doctrine, which would become known as the &quot;Independent and Active&quot; doctrine, continues to be the basis of Indonesian foreign policy.

===Retirement===
==== Announcement and cause ====
In 1955, Hatta announced that when the new People&#x27;s Representative Council (DPR) as well as the Constitutional Assembly, a body commissioned to create a new constitution, were formed as a result of the year&#x27;s legislative and assembly elections, he would retire from the vice presidency. He announced this intention in a letter to Sukarno.

On the surface, it seemed as if Hatta was retiring for practical reasons. Because the presidency was a ceremonial role, this made the office of vice president pointless, and Hatta thought that the country was wasting a lot of money paying his wages. There were also personal reasons, however. As a man who believed in democracy, Hatta was beginning to feel disillusioned with Sukarno&#x27;s increasing autocracy and authoritarianism. Hatta had continued to advise Sukarno against taking this road but he was ignored. Hatta finally gave up and thought that he could no longer work with Sukarno. On 1 December 1956, Hatta officially resigned from the vice presidency.

====Aftermath====
Hatta&#x27;s retirement caused shockwaves all around Indonesia, especially for those of non-Javanese ethnicity. In the eyes of non-Javanese people, Hatta was their main representative in a Javanese-dominated Government. The impact of Hatta&#x27;s retirement was evident in the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia (PRRI) rebellion which wanted to break free from Indonesia, and the Universal Struggle (Permesta) movement, which asked for decentralization. In negotiations with the central government, both PRRI and Permesta listed the reunification of the Sukarno/Hatta leadership as one of the concessions that they wanted from the central government.

==Post-vice presidency==
===Government critic===
Now outside the government, Hatta began to openly criticize Sukarno. One of his criticisms was Sukarno&#x27;s lack of commitment towards national development. Hatta said that the revolution ended with the Dutch recognition of Indonesian sovereignty and that the government&#x27;s focus should be on development. Sukarno rejected this idea outright and responded to it during his 1959 Independence Day speech by saying that the revolution was not over.

In 1960, Hatta wrote a book called &quot;Our Democracy&quot;. In it, he criticized Sukarno&#x27;s Guided Democracy as another form of dictatorship. Sukarno immediately banned the book. The same year Sjahrir&#x27;s political party, the Socialist Party of Indonesia was banned and two years later he was imprisoned on conspiracy charges. Hatta wrote a personal letter to Sukarno calling the arrest &#x27;colonial&#x27; and &#x27;non-rational&#x27;, but to no avail. The old revolutionary trinity had definitively broken down.

===The New Order===
==== Transition to the New Order ====

During the tumultuous time which saw the presidency changed hands from Sukarno to General Suharto, Hatta remained in the background. However, he would break his silence in June 1970, just a week before Sukarno died. In a letter to Suharto, Hatta said that he was disappointed that Sukarno was put under house arrest instead of being put on trial. Hatta&#x27;s reason for this was not malicious: he just wanted matters relating to 30 September Movement coup attempt of 1965 to be cleared up and for Sukarno to be given a chance to defend his actions, as many believed that he was not guilty.

==== Corruption investigation commission ====
Hatta&#x27;s involvement with Suharto&#x27;s government came at the beginning of 1970 when protests were made about corruption within it. In January 1970, Suharto appointed Hatta, along with three others as members of a commission to investigate corruption within the government. The results of the commission&#x27;s investigation was never revealed to public until they leaked in July 1970. It then became apparent that the suspicions of the protesters were correct: there was widespread corruption within the government. Controversially, however, in August 1970, Suharto disbanded the commission and allowed for only two cases of corruption to be looked at by the Government.

==== Institute for Constitutional Awareness Foundation ====
In July 1978, together with Abdul Haris Nasution, Hatta set up the Institute for Constitutional Awareness Foundation (YLKB), set up to act as a forum for critics of Suharto&#x27;s regime. Suharto&#x27;s government moved quickly and did not allow YLKB to conduct its first meeting in January 1979. The YLKB did not give up. In August 1979, it managed to hold a meeting which DPR members attended. Perhaps significantly, members of the Indonesian Military also attended. During the meeting, Nasution criticized the New Order for not fully implementing the Pancasila state ideology and the 1945 Constitution.

===Death===
Hatta died on 14 March 1980 at 18:56 at Cipto Mangunkusumo Hospital, Jakarta, after eleven days of being treated there. The next day, he was buried at his residence on Jalan Diponegoro 57, Jakarta and buried at the Tanah Kusir Public Cemetery in South Jakarta. Jakarta was greeted with a state ceremony led directly by the then Vice President, Adam Malik. He was designated as a proclaiming hero in 1986 by the Suharto government.

== Personal life ==
Hatta did not want to get married until Indonesia was independent.

His daughter, Meutia Farida Hatta previously served as Minister for Female Empowerment in Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono&#x27;s Cabinet. She currently serves as President of the Indonesian Justice and Unity Party. 

== Legacy ==

Soekarno-Hatta International Airport is named in his honor. In 2014, a dormitory building for international students at the Erasmus University Rotterdam campus was named after Hatta. In 2025, a locally-built warship of the Indonesian Navy, , was named after him.

<text>Ryk Neethling OIS (born 17 November 1977) is a South African businessman who rose to prominence as a three-time World Aquatic Champion and four-time World Record breaking Olympic swimming champion, participating in five Olympics for South Africa from 1996-2008. He won a gold medal in the 4x100 freestyle relay at the 2004 Athens Olympics, and is known as one of the most accomplished South African swimmers in history. He would later serve as the CEO of the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation South Africa, and found the Ryk Neethling Swimming Schools.

Born in Bloemfontein, S.A. on 17 November 1977, he attended Grey College, and was coached by Simon Gray at the Seals Swim Club of Bloemfontein. In 1994, Ryk eclipsed the 1500m freestyle South African record by ten seconds, formerly set by his own coach Simon Gray in 1976. Around 18, he captured the 400 and 1500m freestyle competition at the 1995 South African swimming championships. During his time at Grey College, he gained national recognition as a swimmer, earning a place with the South African swimming team for the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. He enrolled at the University of Arizona after the 1996 games.

==University of Arizona==
After attending the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia, Neethling attended the University of Arizona in Tucson, Arizona, enrolling in the Fall of 1996 and attending through 2000, where he was managed and trained by ASCAA Hall of Fame Head Coach Frank Busch, and Assistant Hall of Fame Coach Rick DeMont. DeMont was a former holder of the 1500-meter world record in 1972, and an Olympic participant who had initially won the 400-meter freestyle and was well suited to improve Neethling&#x27;s freestyle technique and efficiency. 

Neethling won nine National Collegiate Athletic Association championships while a student at Arizona. As a Sophomore, he won NCAA titles in the 200, 500, and 1650-yard freestyle. He was a Pac-10 Conference individual champion seven times, an All-American seventeen times, and the NCAA Division I Swimmer of the Year for 1998-99. Graduating around 2000, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology and Business from the University.

==Olympics 1996-2008==
He was the first South African to compete in four successive Olympic Games from 1996-2008.

He participated in the 1500 at the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996 finishing fifth with a time of 15:14.63. He again finished fifth in the 1500 with an improved time of 15.00.48 at the 2000 Sydney Olympic games, less than four seconds from contending for a bronze medal. 

==2004 Athens Olympic gold medal==
Neethling won an Olympic gold medal in the 4×100 m freestyle relay freestyle relay at the 2004 Summer Olympics in a high point of his career. The 2004 4x100 meter Olympic gold medal South African relay team that set a winning time of 3:13.17, consisted of Roland Schoeman, Lyndon Ferns, Darian Townsend and Neethling. As one of the events fastest swimmers, Schoeman&#x27;s opening leg in the 4x100 meter freestyle relay, opened up a short lead that remained throughout the race defeating the second place Netherlands team at the finish by a second and defeating the United States team which took the bronze. Making a major contribution, Neethling maintained the lead swimming the anchor position with a time of 47.99, the fastest time of all the South African relay swimmers. Neethling placed 4th in the individual 100 meter freestyle at the 2004 games.

At the 2008 Olympics, he again competed in the 100-meter freestyle placing 30th, and in the 4x100 meter freestyle relay, one of his signature events, he placed seventh.

===World and S.A. records=== 
He is the former joint owner of the 4×100 m freestyle relay world record and broke the 100m Individual Medley World Record three times in 2005. He has held the South African record in the 200 m, 400 m, 800 m and 1500 m freestyle events. He also broke three world records in the 100m individual medley.

===International competition highlights=== 
Neethling participated in the 1998 Commonwealth Games, winning the silver medal in the 1500 m freestyle, but only capturing a fifth place at the 1998 World Aquatics Championships. In 1999 he had a better performance at the Pan Pacific Championships winning silver in the 1500 m freestyle, and bronze in the 400 m and 200 m freestyle. 

After achieving a disappointing fifth place in the 1500 m freestyle event and an eighth in the 400 m freestyle at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, he decided to quit competing in the 1500 m event, preferring to focus on the 50 m and 100 m freestyle events. At the 2002 Commonwealth Games he captured a bronze medal in the 100 m freestyle and finished 4th in the 50 m freestyle events. At the 2006 Commonwealth Games he captured a silver in the 100 m freestyle and was part of the S.A gold medal winning 4×100 m freestyle relay team. He won three individual gold medals at the 2006 FINA World Aquatics Championships in Shanghai. 

In November 2005, he announced that he had refused a multimillion-dollar offer by Qatar&#x27;s Olympic body to switch nationalities and swim for Qatar at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.

==Professional life==
He has served as CEO of the Princess Charlene of Monaco Foundation South Africa, a Laureus Sport for Good Foundation Ambassador, founder of the Ryk Neethling Swimming Schools and a director and shareholder of Val de Vie Estate. He is also an international keynote and motivational speaker. 

Neethling opened the second branch of the Ryk Neethling Swimming School and Academy in South Africa around June of 2012. The academy focuses on teaching children swimming at an early age, a focus Neethling believed could be a life-long benefit.

He has more recently served as a shareholder and marketing director of Val de Vie Estate a luxury property development in Paarl, South Africa.

==Honors==
At the University of Arizona, he was considered one of the most honored swimmers in the history of the school. He was named the American NCAA Swimmer of the Year and Athlete of the Century in 1999. He was an Arizona Athlete of the Year, and won the University of Arizona Athlete of the Century award. He was a Pac-10 Athlete of the Year four years in a row while at Arizona. 

In August, 2024, he was inducted into the South Africa Sports Hall of Fame, along with the three other swimmers who won the gold medal in the 4x100 meter freestyle relay at the 2004 Athens Olympics.

<text>The National Football League draft, also called the NFL draft or (officially) the Player Selection Meeting, is an annual event which serves as the league&#x27;s most common source of player recruitment. It is the largest of several such arrangements for different leagues in the sport of American football, listed below, both proball and college football . Many no longer take place. Their detailed methods vary, but the NFL draft can serve as an example. The Canadian college draft and American Football League draft are others.

In the NFL draft, each team is given a position in the drafting order in reverse order relative to its record in the previous year, which means that the last place team is positioned first and the Super Bowl champion is last. From this position, the team can either select a player or trade its position to another team for other draft positions, a player or players, or any combination thereof. The round is complete when each team has either selected a player or traded its position in the draft. The first draft was held in 1936, and has been held every year since.

Certain aspects of the draft, including team positioning and the number of rounds in the draft, have been revised since its creation in 1936, but the fundamental method has remained the same. Currently, the draft consists of seven rounds. The original rationale in creating the draft was to increase the competitive parity between the teams as the worst team would, ideally, be able to choose the best player available. In the early years of the draft, players were chosen based on hearsay, print media, or other rudimentary evidence of ability. In the 1940s, some franchises began employing full-time scouts. The ensuing success of these teams eventually forced the other franchises to also hire scouts.

The NFL-defined name of the process has changed since its inception. The location of the draft has continually changed over the years to accommodate more fans, as the event has gained popularity. The draft&#x27;s popularity now garners prime-time television coverage. In the league&#x27;s early years, from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s, the draft was held in various cities with NFL franchises until the league settled on New York City starting in 1965, where it remained for fifty years until 2015, when future draft locations started being determined through a yearly bidding process.

<text>A salmon run is an annual fish migration event where many salmonid species, which are typically hatched in fresh water and live most of their adult life downstream in the ocean, swim back against the stream to the upper reaches of rivers to spawn on the gravel beds of small creeks. After spawning, most Atlantic salmon and all species of Pacific salmon die, and the salmon life cycle starts over again with the new generation of hatchlings.

Salmon are anadromous, spending their juvenile life in rivers or lakes, and then migrating out to sea where they spend adult lives and gain most of their body mass. When they reach sexual maturity, the adults return to the upstream rivers to reproduce. Usually they return with uncanny precision to the natal river where they were born, and even to the very spawning ground of their birth. It is thought that, when they are in the ocean, they use magnetoreception to locate the general position of their natal river, and once close to the river, that they use their sense of smell to home in on the river entrance and even their natal spawning ground.

Trout, which are sister species of salmon, also perform similar migrations, although they mostly move potamodromously between creeks and large freshwater lakes, except for some coastal/estuary subspecies such as steelhead and sea trout that migrate seasonally between salty/brackish and fresh water just like salmon do. There are also landlocked populations of some salmon species that have adapted to spend their entire life in freshwater like trout.

In Northwest America, salmons are keystone species, which means the ecological impact they have on other wildlife is greater than would be expected in relation to their biomass. Most salmon species migrate during the autumn (September through November), which coincides with the pre-winter activities of many hibernating animals. The annual salmon run can be a major feeding event for predators such as grizzly bears and bald eagles, as well as an important window period for sport fishermen.

The post-spawning death of salmon also has important ecological consequences, because the significant nutrients in their carcasses, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus, are transferred from the ocean and released to inland aquatic ecosystems, terrestrial animals (such as bears) and the wetlands and riparian woodlands adjacent to the rivers. This has knock-on effects not only for the next generation of salmon, but to every wildlife species living in the riparian zones the salmon reach. The nutrients can also be washed downstream into estuaries where they accumulate and provide significant support for invertebrates and estuarine-breeding waterbirds.

==Background==


Most salmon are anadromous, a term which comes from the Greek &quot;anadromos&quot;, meaning &quot;running upward&quot;. Anadromous fish grow up mostly in the saltwater in oceans. When they have matured they migrate or &quot;run up&quot; freshwater rivers to spawn in what is called the salmon run.

Anadromous salmon are Northern Hemisphere fish that spend their ocean phase in either the Atlantic Ocean or the Pacific Ocean. They do not thrive in warm water. There is only one species of salmon found in the Atlantic, commonly called the Atlantic salmon. These salmon run up rivers on both sides of the ocean. Seven different species of salmon inhabit the Pacific (see table), and these are collectively referred to as Pacific salmon. Five of these species run up rivers on both sides of the Pacific, but two species are found only on the Asian side. In the early 19th century, Chinook salmon were successfully established in the Southern Hemisphere, far from their native range, in New Zealand rivers. Attempts to establish anadromous salmon elsewhere have not succeeded.

The life cycle of an anadromous salmon begins and, if it survives the full course of its natural life, usually ends in a gravel bed in the upper reaches of a stream or river. These are the salmon spawning grounds where salmon eggs are deposited, for safety, in the gravel. The salmon spawning grounds are also the salmon nurseries, providing a more protected environment than the ocean usually offers. After 2 to 6 months the eggs hatch into tiny larvae called &quot;sac fry&quot; or &quot;alevin&quot;. The alevin have a sac containing the remainder of the yolk, and they stay hidden in the gravel while they feed on the yolk. When the yolk has gone they must find food for themselves, so they leave the protection of the gravel and start feeding on plankton. At this point the baby salmon are called &quot;fry&quot;. At the end of the summer the fry develop into juvenile fish called &quot;parr&quot;. Parr feed on small invertebrates and are camouflaged with a pattern of spots and vertical bars. They remain in this stage for up to three years.

As they approach the time when they are ready to migrate out to the sea the parr lose their camouflage bars and undergo a process of physiological changes which allows them to survive the shift from freshwater to saltwater. At this point salmon are called &quot;smolt&quot;. Smolt spend time in the brackish waters of the river estuary while their body chemistry adjusts their osmoregulation to cope with the higher salt levels they will encounter in the ocean. Smolt also grow the silvery scales which visually confuse ocean predators. When they have matured sufficiently in late spring, and are about 15 to 20 centimetres long, the smolt swim out of the rivers and into the sea. There they spend their first year as a &quot;post-smolt&quot;. Post-smolt form schools with other post-smolt, and set off to find deep-sea feeding grounds. They then spend up to four more years as adult ocean salmon while their full swimming ability and reproductive capacity develop.

Then, in one of the animal kingdom&#x27;s more extreme migrations, the salmon return from the saltwater ocean back to a freshwater river to spawn afresh.


==Return from the ocean==


After several years wandering huge distances in the ocean, most surviving salmon return to the same natal rivers where they were spawned. Then most of them swim up the rivers until they reach the very spawning ground that was their original birthplace.

There are various theories about how this happens. One theory is that there are geomagnetic and chemical cues which the salmon use to guide them back to their birthplace. The fish may be sensitive to the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, which could allow the fish to orient itself in the ocean, so it can navigate back to the estuary of its natal stream.

Salmon have a strong sense of smell. Speculation about whether odours provide homing cues go back to the 19th century. In 1951, Hasler hypothesised that, once in vicinity of the estuary or entrance to its birth river, salmon may use chemical cues which they can smell, and which are unique to their natal stream, as a mechanism to home onto the entrance of the stream. In 1978, Hasler and his students found that the way salmon locate their home rivers with such precision was because they could recognise its characteristic smell. They further demonstrated that the smell of their river becomes imprinted in salmon when they transform into smolts, just before they migrate out to sea. Homecoming salmon can also recognise characteristic smells in tributary streams as they move up the main river. They may also be sensitive to characteristic pheromones given off by juvenile conspecifics. There is evidence that they can &quot;discriminate between two populations of their own species&quot;.

The recognition that each river and tributary has its own characteristic smell, and the role this plays as a navigation aid, led to a widespread search for a mechanism or mechanisms that might allow salmon to navigate over long distances in the open ocean. In 1977, Leggett identified, as mechanisms worth investigating, the use of the sun for navigation, and orientation to various possible gradients, such as temperature, salinity or chemicals gradients, or geomagnetic or geoelectric fields.

There is little evidence salmon use clues from the sun for navigation. Migrating salmon have been observed maintaining direction at nighttime and when it is cloudy. Likewise, electronically tagged salmon were observed to maintain direction even when swimming in water much too deep for sunlight to be of use.

In 1973, it was shown that Atlantic salmon have conditioned cardiac responses to electric fields with strengths similar to those found in oceans. &quot;This sensitivity might allow a migrating fish to align itself upstream or downstream in an ocean current in the absence of fixed references.&quot; In 1988, researchers found iron, in the form of single domain magnetite, resides in the skulls of sockeye salmon. The quantities present are sufficient for magnetoception.

Tagging studies have shown a small number of fish do not find their natal rivers, but travel instead up other, usually nearby streams or rivers. It is important some salmon stray from their home areas; otherwise new habitats could not be colonized. In 1984, Quinn hypothesized there is a dynamic equilibrium, controlled by genes, between homing and straying. If the spawning grounds have a uniform high quality, then natural selection should favour the descendants that home accurately. If the spawning grounds have a variable quality, then natural selection should favour a mixture of the descendants that stray and the descendants that home accurately.

Prior to the run up the river, the salmon undergo profound physiological changes. Fish swim by contracting longitudinal red muscle and obliquely oriented white muscles. Red muscles are used for sustained activity, such as ocean migrations. White muscles are used for bursts of activity, such as bursts of speed or jumping. As the salmon comes to end of its ocean migration and enters the estuary of its natal river, its energy metabolism is faced with two major challenges: it must supply energy suitable for swimming the river rapids, and it must supply the sperm and eggs required for the reproductive events ahead. The water in the estuary receives the freshwater discharge from the natal river. Relative to ocean water, this has a high chemical load from surface runoff. Researchers in 2009 found evidence that, as the salmon encounter the resulting drop in salinity and increase in olfactory stimulation, two key metabolic changes are triggered: there is a switch from using red muscles for swimming to using white muscles, and there is an increase in the sperm and egg load. &quot;Pheromones at the spawning grounds [trigger] a second shift to further enhance reproductive loading.&quot;

The salmon also undergo radical morphological changes as they prepare for the spawning event ahead. All salmon lose the silvery blue they had as ocean fish, and their colour darkens, sometimes with a radical change in hue. Salmon are sexually dimorphic, and the male salmon develop canine-like teeth and their jaws develop a pronounced curve or hook (&quot;kype&quot;). Some species of male salmon grow large humps.

==Obstacles==
Salmon start the run in peak condition, the culmination of years of development in the ocean. They need high swimming and leaping abilities to battle the rapids and other obstacles the river may present, and they need a full sexual development to ensure a successful spawn at the end of the run. All their energy goes into the physical rigours of the journey and the dramatic morphological transformations they must still complete before they are ready for the spawning events ahead.

The run up the river can be exhausting, sometimes requiring the salmon to battle hundreds of miles upstream against strong currents and rapids. They cease feeding during the run. Chinook and sockeye salmon from central Idaho must travel and climb nearly before they are ready to spawn. Salmon deaths that occur on the upriver journey are referred to as &quot;en route mortality&quot;.

Salmon negotiate waterfalls and rapids by leaping or jumping. They have been recorded making vertical jumps as high as 3.65 metres (12 ft). The height that can be achieved by a salmon depends on the position of the standing wave or hydraulic jump at the base of the fall, as well as how deep the water is.

Fish ladders, or fishways, are specially designed to help salmon and other fish to bypass dams and other man-made obstructions, and continue on to their spawning grounds further upriver. Data suggest that navigation locks have a potential to be operated as vertical slot fishways to provide increased access for a range of biota, including poor swimmers.

Skilled predators, such as bears, bald eagles and fishermen can await the salmon during the run. Normally solitary animals, grizzly bears congregate by streams and rivers when the salmon spawn. Predation from harbor seals, California sea lions, and Steller sea lions can pose a significant threat, even in river ecosystems.

Black bears also fish the salmon. Black bears usually operate during the day, but when it comes to salmon they tend to fish at night. This is partly to avoid competition with the more powerful brown bears, but it is also because they catch more salmon at night. During the day, salmon are very evasive and attuned to visual clues, but at night they focus on their spawning activities, generating acoustic clues the bears tune into. Black bears may also fish for salmon during the night because their black fur is easily spotted by salmon in the daytime. In 2009, researchers compared the foraging success of black bears with the white-coated Kermode bear, a morphed subspecies of the black bear. They found the Kermode bear had no more success catching salmon at night time, but had greater success than the black bears during the day.

Otters are also common predators. In 2011, researchers showed that when otters predate salmon, the salmon can &quot;sniff them out&quot;. They demonstrated that once otters have eaten salmon, the remaining salmon could detect and avoid the waters where otter faeces was present.

==Spawning==

The term &quot;prespawn mortality&quot; is used to refer to fish that arrive successfully at the spawning grounds, and then die without spawning. Prespawn mortality is surprisingly variable, with one study observing rates between 3% and 90%. Factors that contribute to these mortalities include high temperatures, high river discharge rates, and parasites and diseases. &quot;At present there are no reliable indicators to predict whether an individual arriving at a spawning area will in fact survive to spawn.&quot;

The eggs of a female salmon are called her roe. To lay her roe, the female salmon builds a spawning nest, called a &quot;redd&quot;, in a riffle with gravel as its streambed. A riffle is a relatively shallow length of stream where the water is turbulent and flows faster. She builds the redd by using her tail (caudal fin) to create a low-pressure zone, lifting gravel to be swept downstream, and excavating a shallow depression. The redd may contain up to 5,000 eggs, each about the size of a pea, covering . The eggs usually range from orange to red. One or more males will approach the female in her redd, depositing his sperm, or milt, over her eggs. The female then covers the eggs by disturbing the gravel at the upstream edge of the depression before moving on to make another redd. The female will make as many as seven redds before her supply of eggs is exhausted.

Male pink salmon and some sockeye salmon develop pronounced humps just before they spawn. These humps may have evolved because they confer species advantages. The humps make it less likely the salmon will spawn in the shallow water at margins of the streambed, which tend to dry out during low water flows or freeze in winter. Further, riffles can contain many salmon spawning simultaneously, as in the image on the right. Predators, such as bears, will be more likely to catch the more visually prominent humped males, with their humps projecting above the surface of the water. This may provide a protective buffer for the females.

Dominant male salmon defend their redds by rushing at and chasing intruders. They butt and bite them with the canine-like teeth they developed for the spawning event. The kypes are used to clamp around the base of the tail (caudal peduncle) of an opponent.

== Deterioration ==
The physical condition of the salmon deteriorates the longer they remain in fresh water. Once the salmon have spawned, most of them deteriorate rapidly (a.k.a. &quot;spawned out&quot;) and soon die. Some deteriorating salmon are still alive, but their bodies have already begun the process of rotting, and these deteriorating salmon are sometimes colloquially called &quot;zombie fish&quot;. This is because upstream freshwater bodies (especially creeks) typically do not have sufficient food available for the adult salmon diet, and they have used large amounts of energy swimming upriver, thus exhausting their own internal nutrient reserves. Spawning salmon also have programmed senescence, which is &quot;characterized by immunosuppression and organ deterioration&quot;, making them more vulnerable to diseases. Most zombie fish die within days of spawning, but some can last up to a couple of weeks. Once the salmon die in the river, they are either scavenged by other animals, or they decompose and release inorganic nutrients to the plankton in the river and the riparian vegetation in the floodplain.

The Pacific salmon are a classic example of a semelparous animal, which reproduce only once in their lifetime. Semelparity is sometimes called &quot;big bang&quot; reproduction, since the single reproductive event of semelparous organisms is usually large and fatal to the spawners. It is an evolutionary strategy that concentrates all available resources into maximizing reproduction, at the expense of individual organism&#x27;s life, which is common among insects but rare among vertebrates. All six species of Pacific salmons live for many years in the ocean before swimming to the freshwater stream of its birth, spawning, and then dying. Most Atlantic salmon also die after spawning, but about 5 to 10% (mostly female) return to the ocean where they can recover and spawn again the next season.



==Keystone species==
In the Pacific Northwest and Alaska, salmon is a keystone species, supporting wildlife from birds to bears and otters. The bodies of salmon represent a transfer of nutrients from the ocean, rich in nitrogen, sulfur, carbon and phosphorus, to the forest ecosystem.

Grizzly bears function as ecosystem engineers, capturing salmon and carrying them into adjacent wooded areas. There they deposit nutrient-rich urine and faeces and partially eaten carcasses. It has been estimated that bears leave up to half the salmon they harvest on the forest floor, in densities that can reach 4,000 kilograms per hectare, providing as much as 24% of the total nitrogen available to the riparian woodlands. The foliage of spruce trees up to from a stream where grizzlies fish salmon have been found to contain nitrogen originating from fished salmon.

Wolves normally hunt for deer. A 2008 study suggests that when the salmon run starts, wolves choose to fish for salmon, even if plenty of deer are still available. &quot;Selecting benign prey such as salmon makes sense from a safety point of view. While hunting deer, wolves commonly incur serious and often fatal injuries. In addition to safety benefits we determined that salmon also provides enhanced nutrition in terms of fat and energy.&quot;

The upper reaches of the Chilkat River in Alaska has particularly good spawning grounds. Each year these attract a run of up to half a million chum salmon. As the salmon run up the river, bald eagles arrive in their thousands to feast at the spawning grounds. This results in some of the world&#x27;s largest congregations of bald eagles. The number of participating eagles is directly correlated with the number of spawning salmon.

Residual nutrients from salmon can also accumulate downstream in estuaries. A 2010 study suggests the density and diversity of many estuarine breeding birds in the summer &quot;were strongly predicted by salmon biomass in the autumn&quot;. Anadromous salmon provide nutrients to these &quot;diverse assemblages ... ecologically comparable to the migrating herds of wildebeest in the Serengeti&quot;.

==Prospects==
In 1997, researchers noted that the future of salmon runs worldwide would depend on many factors, most of which are driven by human actions. Among the key driving factors are (1) harvest of salmon by commercial, recreational, and subsistence fishing, (2) alterations in stream and river channels, including construction of dikes and other riparian corridor modifications, (3) electricity generation, flood control, and irrigation supplied by dams, (4) alteration by humans of freshwater, estuarine, and marine environments used by salmon, coupled with aquatic changes due to climate and ocean circulatory regimes, (5) water withdrawals from rivers and reservoirs for agricultural, municipal, or commercial purposes, (6) changes in climate caused at least in part by human activities, (7) competition from non-native fishes, (8) salmon predation by marine mammals, birds, and other fish species, (9) diseases and parasites, including those from outside the native region, and (10) reduced nutrient replenishment from decomposing salmon.

In 2009, NOAA advised that continued runoff into North American rivers of three widely used pesticides containing neurotoxins would &quot;jeopardize the continued existence&quot; of endangered and threatened Pacific salmon. Global warming could see the end of some salmon runs by the end of the century, such as the Californian runs of Chinook salmon. A 2010 United Nations report said that increases in acidification of oceans would mean that shellfish such as pteropods, an important component of the ocean salmon diet, would be finding it more difficult to build their aragonite shells. There were concerns that this too could endanger future salmon runs.

==In popular culture==
In a 1982 video game called &quot;Salmon Run&quot;, the player takes the role of Sam the Salmon, swimming upriver to mate. Along the way he encounters waterfalls, a bear, fishermen, and seagulls.

In the Disney animated feature film, &quot;Brother Bear&quot;, Kenai and Koda reached the salmon run and met a large group of bears led by Tug at the Annual Salmon Run. Featuring the song &quot;Welcome&quot; by The Blind Boys of Alabama and Phil Collins.

<text>Erik Francis Schrody (born August 18, 1969), known by his stage names Everlast and Whitey Ford, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter who was the frontman for hip hop group House of Pain. His breakthrough as a solo artist came in 1998 with his album &quot;Whitey Ford Sings the Blues&quot;, which blended rock and hip-hop and garnered him his first Grammy Award nomination for the song &quot;What It&#x27;s Like&quot;. The album peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart, while the single peaked at number 13 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart. As of 2023, they remain his highest mainstream chart positions for an album and single respectively.

In 2000, Everlast received a Grammy Award for Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal with Latin rock band Santana for &quot;Put Your Lights On&quot;. From 2006 to 2012, he was also part of the hip hop supergroup La Coka Nostra, which consisted of members of House of Pain and other rappers. In 2008, he was nominated an Emmy Award for the main title theme of the TV series &quot;Saving Grace&quot;. He has released eight albums in his solo career, each featuring a blend of hip-hop, rock, blues, folk, and Americana. His most recent release is &quot;Whitey Ford&#x27;s House of Pain&quot;, which came out in 2018.

== Formative years ==
Everlast went to Taft High School in Los Angeles at the same time Ice Cube and N.W.A and the Posse member Krazy Dee were attending. Everlast stated about N.W.A in an interview with &quot;LA Weekly&quot;:

==Career==
===Late 1980s–mid 1990s: Early career and group&#x27;s breakthrough===

Emerging as a member of Ice-T&#x27;s group Rhyme Syndicate, Everlast&#x27;s 1990 debut album &quot;Forever Everlasting&quot; was a commercial disappointment. Following the album&#x27;s failure, Everlast teamed up with fellow Taft High alumni DJ Lethal and Danny Boy to form the hip-hop trio House of Pain. The group was signed to Tommy Boy Records, and their 1992 self-titled debut album went multi-platinum, spawning the successful DJ Muggs produced single &quot;Jump Around&quot;.

Fashioning themselves as rowdy Irish-American hooligans (Lethal is actually Latvian-born), they toured with various rap and alternative rock bands such as the Ramones, Beastie Boys and Rage Against the Machine after their breakthrough. They participated together with Helmet, along with several other rap acts, on the influential 1993 rock-rap collaborative &quot;Judgment Night&quot; movie soundtrack (Everlast also played a villain in the film). The group eventually disbanded in 1996, and Everlast once again pursued a solo career.

=== 1998–2001: Solo breakthrough ===
Everlast&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Whitey Ford Sings the Blues&quot; was both a commercial and critical success (selling more than three million copies). &quot;Whitey Ford Sings the Blues&quot; was hailed for its blend of rap with acoustic and electric guitars, developed by Everlast together with producers Dante Ross and John Gamble. The album&#x27;s lead single &quot;What It&#x27;s Like&quot; proved to be his most popular and successful song, although the follow-up single, &quot;Ends&quot;, also reached the U.S. rock top 10.

Everlast followed up this success by collaborating with Santana on the track &quot;Put Your Lights On&quot; on Santana&#x27;s 1999 album &quot;Supernatural&quot;. It charted at No. 118 on the pop chart, but did considerably better with rock radio airplay, peaking at No. 8 on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Put Your Lights On&quot; won Best Rock Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal at the 2000 Grammy Awards.

Despite the success of &quot;Whitey Ford Sings the Blues&quot; and his success with Santana, Everlast&#x27;s follow-up album, &quot;Eat at Whitey&#x27;s&quot; (2000), stumbled commercially at first in the United States. However, it was eventually certified gold. The album was also embraced critically, especially by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; which reviewed the album between &quot;good&quot; and &quot;great&quot; and focused on it as that month&#x27;s most important release.

=== Feud with Eminem ===
That year, a feud erupted between Everlast and Eminem. Eminem and Everlast crossed paths before a concert in early 1999. Eminem says he did not greet Everlast because he did not recognize him right away, and said Everlast did not acknowledge him. Everlast&#x27;s version is that he tried to congratulate Eminem on his success, and Eminem blew him off.

Everlast&#x27;s verse from the Dilated Peoples all star track &quot;Ear Drums Pop (Remix)&quot; contained a thinly veiled reference to Eminem (&quot;Cock my hammer, spit a comet like Haley/I buck a .380 on ones that act shady&quot;), and went on to warn &quot;You might catch a beatdown out where I come from&quot; in his recounting of the incident. Eminem, in turn, blasted Everlast several times in public and with the song &quot;I Remember (Dedication to Whitey Ford)&quot; released as the B-side to his group D12&#x27;s 12&quot; vinyl single &quot;Shit on You&quot;.

Everlast responded with the track &quot;Whitey&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, released only on his official website. While the song contained references to Eminem&#x27;s strained relationships with his wife and mother, it was &quot;Better run and check your kid for your DNA&quot;, again referring to Eminem&#x27;s daughter, Hailie Jade Mathers, that set Eminem off. The track ends with the spoken words, &quot;I ain&#x27;t wasting no more time with you man. Fuck that shit, That&#x27;s it&quot;.

Eminem and D12 responded with &quot;Quitter&quot;, the second half of which is a take off on &quot;Hit &#x27;Em Up&quot; by 2Pac and the Outlawz (a diss song mainly aimed at The Notorious B.I.G.). The track ends with the spoken words, &quot;Fuck him, that&#x27;s it, I&#x27;m done, I promise, I&#x27;m done, that&#x27;s it.&quot; It was reported that long-time friends of Eminem, group Limp Bizkit, were meant to be featured on &quot;Quitter&quot;, but Fred Durst canceled at the last moment. Everlast echoed similar sentiment on the status of this feud, stating in various interviews that he felt everything had been said and he would now refrain from further responses. However, following Eminem&#x27;s disses towards them on &quot;Quitter&quot;, Evidence of Dilated Peoples responded with the track &quot;Search 4 Bobby Fisher&quot;.

In a TRL interview, current Limp Bizkit and former House of Pain member DJ Lethal made a statement that if Mathers and Schrody were to fight in real life, Everlast would win. This irked Eminem, and an insulting track aimed at both Everlast and Limp Bizkit appeared on D12&#x27;s mainstream debut, &quot;Devil&#x27;s Night&quot;, as a hidden track called &quot;Girls&quot;. B-Real of Cypress Hill claimed that Everlast recorded another diss towards Eminem following the release of &quot;Quitter&quot;, but it went unreleased due to him deciding to instead quash the feud. According to Eminem, their fight has settled since then and there is a mutual respect between Mathers and Schrody. Further indicating an end to lyrical hostilities between the two, Eminem seemingly gave a shout out to Everlast on &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP 2&quot; song entitled &quot;Baby&quot;.

===2002–present: Subsequent success===

After the sale of the Tommy Boy Records&#x27; catalog of master tapes to Warner Bros. Records and its metamorphosis to a dance music label in 2002, Everlast was without a label, but in 2003 he signed with Island/Def Jam. His fourth solo album, &quot;White Trash Beautiful&quot; (2004), was subsequently released after almost a four-year hiatus. Produced by Everlast and Dante Ross and featuring a lead single of the same name, &quot;White Trash Beautiful&quot; was described as an &quot;effective mix of hip-hop trope and bluesy strum.&quot;

In early 2006, Everlast teamed up with his former House of Pain mates DJ Lethal and Danny Boy to join the hip-hop group La Coka Nostra. The group first came to be due to the former House of Pain hype man Danny Boy starting the group as a collective with rappers Slaine and Big Left (who has since left the group). Soon after the group started Ill Bill of a now disbanded Non Phixion and Everlast joined the group. Their first known song was &quot;Fuck Tony Montana&quot; which features B-Real of Cypress Hill and Sick Jacken. Due to the popularity of the song online, the group released several more online for free.

In 2007, Everlast was chosen to do the theme song for the TV show &quot;Saving Grace&quot;. The song plays during the show&#x27;s main title sequence, and was originally released to digital outlets only; however, it was also included on Everlast&#x27;s fifth solo album, &quot;Love, War and the Ghost of Whitey Ford&quot;. The album was released on September 23, 2008, on Everlast&#x27;s own record label Martyr Inc, with distribution by Hickory Records/Sony/ATV Music Publishing. (It was revealed through diditleak.co.uk that the album leaked out early on Friday August 29.) A second single and video, &quot;Letter Home From the Garden of Stone&quot;, was released for free download from martyr-inc.com in December 2007. The third single, a cover of Johnny Cash&#x27;s &quot;Folsom Prison Blues&quot;, was released to download on August 19. The music video for &quot;Stone in My Hand&quot; debuted on the Martyr Inc. website on October 28, 2008 making it the fourth video for the album.

The group&#x27;s debut album &quot;A Brand You Can Trust&quot; was released on July 14, 2009. The album features guests like Snoop Dogg, B-Real, Bun B, Immortal Technique, Sick Jacken, and Q-Unique. La Coka Nostra then joined the likes of Nas and Ill Bill&#x27;s brother Necro on Rock the Bells.

In October 2011, his sixth solo album, &quot;Songs of the Ungrateful Living&quot;, was released through Martyr Inc. in partnership with EMI. Produced by Everlast in collaboration with DJ Lethal, Fredwreck and Darius Holbert, the album featured the lead single &quot;I Get By&quot;. Like &quot;Love, War and the Ghost of Whitey Ford&quot;, a number of tracks on &quot;Songs of the Ungrateful Living&quot; contained overtly political and social themes.

Everlast left the group in 2012 in order to attend to his daughter&#x27;s medical issues.

In 2013, Everlast and Eminem were featured on a Busta Rhymes track together.
On August 27, 2013, Everlast&#x27;s acoustic album &quot;The Life Acoustic&quot; was released via his own record label Martyr Inc. That year, Everlast sued the inflatables company &quot;Jump Around Rentals&quot; for using the phrase &quot;if you want to get down jump around&quot; in their advertising, arguing it belonged to House of Pain.

Starting in 2017, joining with Divine Styler and Sick Jacken, Everlast released a Warporn mixtape.

On September 7, 2018, Everlast&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Whitey Ford&#x27;s House of Pain&quot; was released.

==Personal life==
On the day Schrody finished recording &quot;Whitey Ford Sings the Blues&quot;, he experienced a tightening in his chest. It persisted for five hours, prompting his co-producer and friend John Gamble to insist Schrody go to the hospital. Schrody had a torn aortic valve, and his heart was essentially &quot;drowning in blood&quot;.

By 1996, Everlast had converted from Catholicism to Islam. In a 2011 interview he stated, &quot;even though I would consider myself still to be Muslim, I don&#x27;t really. I really kinda reject all organized religion... when a bunch of people get together and are spiritual and they feel good about each other, great things can happen. But when you start enforcing your philosophy and ideals on other people who don’t necessarily share them all, it turns into Palestine and Israel, and all these kinds of things. Ya know? Indians and Pakistanis, ya know?&quot;

Also in 2015 he said, &quot;To me, Islam is mine. Allah is God of all the worlds, and all mankind and all the Alameen (worlds/universe). Islam is my personal relationship with God. So nobody can put any more pressure on me than I can put on myself. But as far as the mosque where I pray, I have never felt more at home or more welcome.&quot;

== Musical style and influences ==
Everlast&#x27;s music ranges from blues to hip hop and rock. After having previously established himself as a rapper earlier in his career, Everlast subsequently reinvented himself with a new sound that fused acoustic rock, folk, blues and hip hop under the alias Whitey Ford. According to Stephen Thomas Erlewine, &quot;Nobody ever would have guessed that the leader of House of Pain would come back after a bout of obscurity and a serious heart attack to reinvent himself as a hip-hop troubadour, rasping out bluesy folk-rock to a steady-rolling beat.&quot;

Everlast&#x27;s influences include N.W.A, Beastie Boys, Cypress Hill, Ice-T, Gang Starr, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Tom Petty, The Rolling Stones, Bruce Springsteen, Neil Young, and Run-DMC.

<doc id="907215" wikidata="Q1244243" url="?curid=907215" title="Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol">
<text>The Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) is a computer networking protocol that provides for automatic assignment of available Internet Protocol (IP) routers to participating hosts. This increases the availability and reliability of routing paths via automatic default gateway selections on an IP subnetwork.

The protocol achieves this by the creation of virtual routers, which are an abstract representation of multiple routers, i.e. primary/active and secondary/Standby routers, acting as a group. The virtual router is assigned to act as a default gateway of participating hosts, instead of a physical router. If the physical router that is routing packets on behalf of the virtual router fails, another physical router is selected to automatically replace it. The physical router that is forwarding packets at any given time is called the primary/active router.

VRRP provides information on the state of a router, not the routes processed and exchanged by that router. Each VRRP instance is limited, in scope, to a single subnet. It does not advertise IP routes beyond that subnet or affect the routing table in any way. VRRP can be used in Ethernet, MPLS and Token Ring networks with Internet Protocol Version 4 (IPv4), as well as IPv6.

==Implementation==
A virtual router must use as its media access control (MAC) address. The last byte of the address (XX) is the virtual router identifier (VRID), which is different for each virtual router in the network. This address is used by only one physical router at a time, and it will reply with this MAC address when an ARP request is sent for the virtual router&#x27;s IP address.

Physical routers within the virtual router must communicate within themselves using packets with multicast IP address and IP protocol number 112 for IPv4, or and IP protocol number 112 for IPv6.

Routers backing up a virtual router have a priority between 1 and 254, and the router with the highest priority will become the primary/active. The default priority is 100; for the MAC address owner, the priority is always 255.

==Elections of primary/active routers==
A failure to receive a multicast packet from the primary/active router for a period longer than three times the advertisement timer causes the secondary/standby routers to assume that the primary/active router is dead. The virtual router then transitions into an unsteady state and an election process is initiated to select the next primary/active router from the secondary/standby routers. This is fulfilled through the use of multicast packets.

Secondary/standby router(s) are only supposed to send multicast packets during an election process. One exception to this rule is when a physical router is configured with a higher priority than the current primary/active, which means that on connection to the network it will pre-empt the primary/active status. This allows a system administrator to force a physical router to the primary/active state immediately after booting, for example when that particular router is more powerful than others within the virtual router. The secondary/standby router with the highest priority becomes the primary/active router by raising its priority above that of the current primary/active. It will then take responsibility for routing packets sent to the virtual gateway&#x27;s MAC address. In cases where secondary/standby routers all have the same priority, the secondary/standby router with the highest IP address becomes the primary/active router.

All physical routers acting as a virtual router must be in the same local area network (LAN) segment. Communication within the virtual router takes place periodically. This period can be adjusted by changing advertisement interval timers. The shorter the advertisement interval, the shorter the black hole period, though at the expense of more traffic in the network. Security is achieved by responding only to first hop packets, though other mechanisms are provided to reinforce this, particularly against local attacks. The election process is made orderly through the use of skew time, derived from a router&#x27;s priority, and used to reduce the chance of the thundering herd problem occurring during the election. The skew time is given by the formula (expressed in milliseconds).

Secondary/standby router utilization can be improved by load sharing.

==History==
Work on VRRP started in 1997 with a first draft published by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). In 1998, the protocol was officially defined.
VRRP is an open standard, but Cisco claimed that their Hot Standby Router Protocol, a similar but proprietary protocol with essentially the same facility, is patented and licensed.
However, in 2001, in reply to a direct request, Robert Barr of Cisco replied that they will not assert any patent claims unless someone tried to assert a claim against Cisco. IBM also claims covering patents and their statement is readable on the IETF webpage. All patents in question have expired.

The protocol was refined in 2004 as version 2. VRRP version 3, the current version, was published in 2010.

== Derivatives ==
Mellanox offers MAGP, a proprietary protocol based on VRRP that allows active-active operation.

Foundry Networks developed VRRP-E(Extended), a proprietary version of VRRP that avoids a few limitations of RFC 3768

<doc id="907217" wikidata="Q2594452" url="?curid=907217" title="Everlast (brand)">
<text>Everlast is an American brand of sports equipment, focused on boxing, mixed martial arts and physical fitness, which markets its products worldwide. The company was founded in The Bronx and is currently based in Manhattan. In 2007, Everlast was acquired by the British retailing group Frasers Group.

Everlast manufactures a wide range of products for fight sports including boxing gloves, protective gear (head and body protectors, mouthguards, jockstraps, hand wraps), punching bags, punch mitts, boxing rings (and corner stools, canvas, ropes, corner cushions). The company also markets a clothing and footwear line including T-shirts, sleeveless shirts, hoodies, leggings, shorts, pants, compression garment, and sneakers.

== History ==
In 1910, 17-year-old Jacob Golomb, the son of a tailor and an avid swimmer, started the company as a manufacturer of swimwear designed to last longer than previously available swimsuits; he guaranteed his suits would last longer than one year, and named them &quot;Everlast&quot;. Everlast expanded into supplying a wide range of sports equipment. The company first produced boxing gear in 1917 after a young Jack Dempsey asked them to supply him with headgear that would last for more than 15 rounds. It subsequently sponsored Roberto Durán, Joe Frazier, Marvin Hagler, Larry Holmes, Sugar Ray Leonard, and in particular Muhammad Ali and became the most recognizable boxing brand.

Golomb died in the 1950s and was succeeded as head of the company by his son Daniel, who made the Everlast logo on the company&#x27;s boxing gloves larger to increase visibility on television. Ben Nadorf purchased 50% of Everlast Sports Mfg. Corp in 1958 and became sole owner in 1995. In 2000, the company was acquired by George Horowitz&#x27;s Active Apparel Group, which had manufactured men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s sportswear under license for Everlast, and in 2007, Sports Direct acquired Everlast Worldwide.

The company has expanded its activities into MMA and has been awarded the World MMA Awards for Best Technical Equipment Brand five times, most recently in 2016.

Everlast boxing equipment is made in a factory in Moberly, Missouri; other products are manufactured outside the US by licensees. The company also made boxing equipment at a factory in the Port Morris section of the Bronx from the 1980s until 2003.

==UK gym chain==

In 2020 Frasers Group bought a number of DW Sports Fitness (previously JJB Sports) locations out of administration, and started the Everlast Gyms chain. In late 2023 they had nearly 60 branches located across all four countries of the United Kingdom.
