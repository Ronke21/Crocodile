<text>Maple Leaf Stadium was a jewel box-style baseball stadium in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located at the foot of Bathurst Street on the south side of Lake Shore Boulevard (formerly Fleet Street). It was built in 1926 by Lol Solman for his Toronto Maple Leafs baseball team of the International League. Previously, the Maple Leafs had played at Hanlan&#x27;s Point Stadium. It continued to be the home of the Leafs for 42 seasons, until the team left town following the 1967 season. The stadium was demolished in 1968. Fans often referred to the stadium as the &quot;Fleet Street Flats&quot;.

==History==

In 1925, the Maple Leafs acquired land at the foot of Bathurst Street on new land that had been in-filled from the lake by the Toronto Harbour Commission. Maple Leaf Stadium was designed by architects Chapman, Oxley and Bishop. Initial plans were for a 30,000 seat venue for baseball, football, and other sports. Construction was financed by the team and the Commission was to own the stadium. Construction was initially budgeted at $300,000 but was completed for $750,000.

The opening game was held on April 29, 1926, with the Maple Leafs rallying to defeat the Reading Keystones in extra innings before a rain-soaked crowd of 12,781. Toronto mayor Thomas Foster threw out the first pitch, caught by former mayor Thomas Church. Games were held only during the day until 1934 when lights for night games were installed.

In 1951, the Maple Leafs were sold to Jack Kent Cooke. Cooke spent $57,000 to refurbish the stadium. During the 1950s, attendance at games surged as Cooke promoted the games heavily on his radio station, CKEY, and the team gave away prizes to attendees. Twice, the team had better attendance than major-league teams.

On November 8, 1926, Maple Leaf Stadium was the site of the first professional American football game to be played outside the United States, a 28-0 victory for the New York Yankees over the Los Angeles Wildcats, both of the first American Football League. Estimated attendance for the game was 10,000. The Toronto Rifles of the Continental Football League played at the venue for their first season in 1965.

In the early 1960s, Cooke tried to persuade Toronto city council a new stadium was needed to attract a major league team, though the City of Toronto government was unwilling to shoulder the costs. Cooke, who had moved to the United States in 1960, sold the Maple Leafs in 1964. The Maple Leafs were sold again in 1967 and transferred to Louisville, Kentucky. By that time, the stadium was estimated to need $250,000 worth of repairs. The final home game, on September 4, 1967, drew a paid attendance of 802.

After the Maple Leafs left, the stadium was considered to be a safety hazard and demolition began within a few months into 1968. The site is currently occupied by apartment buildings. The adjacent Little Norway Park includes a ball field.

The site was part of the 1976 Toronto Olympic bid, which would have seen a domed stadium built and be part of a larger ‘Harbour City’ concept. Toronto lost out as a candidate city to Montreal in 1968, canceling any plans for a stadium on the site.

<text>Yuliya Nesterenko (alt. spelling: Yulia Nestsiarenka, née Bartsevich (, ; , ; born 15 June 1979) is a Belarusian sprinter who was the Olympic 100 meters champion in 2004.

Nesterenko won the women&#x27;s 100 metres at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens in 10.93 seconds, becoming the first non-black athlete to win the event since the 1980 Summer Olympics. She ran all four times (two qualification rounds, semifinal and final) under 11 seconds.

After the Olympic games in Athens she took an almost year-long break. At the 2005 World Championships in Athletics in Helsinki she reached the final in the 100 metres, though came only 8th (11.13 seconds). She won a bronze medal in another event, the 4 × 100 metres relay, together with her compatriots Natallia Solohub, Alena Neumiarzhitskaya and Aksana Drahun. At the 2006 European Athletics Championships in Gothenburg she was 6th in the 100m final and won a bronze medal in the 4 × 100 m relay.

At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, Nesterenko competed in the 100m again. In her first round heat she came 2nd behind Kim Gevaert in a time of 11.40 to advance to the second round. There she improved down to 11.14 seconds, but finished 4th, normally causing elimination, however hers was the fastest losing time and enough to qualify for the semifinals. She came close to reaching the final to defend her title with a time of 11.26, 5th place, while the first four athletes qualified for the final. Together with Aksana Drahun, Nastassia Shuliak and Anna Bagdanovich she took part in the 4 × 100m relay. In their first round heat they placed 6th with a time of 43.69 seconds, which was the 9th overall out of 16 countries. With this result they failed to qualify for the final.

Nesterenko is a member of the Belarus Olympic Committee.

<text>The Chocolate Soldier (German: Der tapfere Soldat [The courageous soldier] or &quot;Der Praliné-Soldat&quot;) is an operetta composed in 1908 by Oscar Straus based on George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s 1894 play, &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;. The German language libretto is by Rudolf Bernauer and . It premiered on 14 November 1908 at the Theater an der Wien.

English-language versions were successful on Broadway and in London, beginning in 1909. The first film adaptation was in 1915. The 1941 film of the same name enlists much of Straus&#x27;s music but is otherwise unrelated, using a plot based on Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s play &quot;The Guardsman&quot;.

==Background==

When Shaw gave Leopold Jacobson the rights to adapt the play, he provided three conditions: none of Shaw&#x27;s dialogue, nor any of the character&#x27;s names, could be used; the libretto must be advertised as a parody; and Shaw would accept no monetary compensation. In spite of this, Shaw&#x27;s original plot, and with it the central message of the play, remain more or less untouched. The main love aria, for instance, is sung by the heroine just before she meets the &quot;other man&quot;, and the &quot;brave&quot; soldier turns out to be a worse coward than his unmilitaristic rival. Shaw despised the result, however, calling it &quot;a putrid &quot;opéra bouffe&quot; in the worst taste of 1860&quot;, but grew to regret not accepting payment when, despite his opinion of the work, it became an international success.

When Shaw heard, in 1921, that Franz Lehár wanted to set his play &quot;Pygmalion&quot; to music, he sent word to Vienna that Lehár be instructed that he could not touch &quot;Pygmalion&quot; without infringing Shaw&#x27;s copyright and that Shaw had &quot;no intention of allowing the history of &quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot; to be repeated.&quot; &quot;Pygmalion&quot; was eventually adapted by Lerner and Loewe as &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, made possible because they were, at least in theory, adapting a screenplay co-authored by Shaw, with rights controlled by the film company.

==Production history==
As &quot;Der tapfere Soldat&quot;, it premiered on 14 November 1908 at the Theater an der Wien, under the baton of Robert Stolz with Grete Holm singing Nadina, and Louise Kartousch as Mascha, where it was a considerable success.

The first English-language version premiered in New York City, translated by Stanislaus Stange, on 13 September 1909, where it was the hit of the Broadway season. It was revived on Broadway in 1910, 1921, 1930, 1931, 1934, and 1947 (with a revised libretto by Guy Bolton). Its London premiere at the Lyric Theatre in 1910, with C. H. Workman as Bumerli, Elsie Spain as Mascha and Roland Cunningham as Alexius, was also a tremendous success, running for 500 performances. The operetta was adapted as a silent film in 1915.

In 1987, Light Opera Works in Illinois produced and recorded the operetta with a new English translation by its former artistic director, Philip Kraus, and lyrics by Gregory Opelka. In 2002, there was another production at the Kammeroper in Hamburg under Katja Klose and Hans Thiemann. In 2010, it formed part of the program for the Bard SummerScape festival held in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York. In July and August 2012, it was produced by Ohio Light Opera.

==Roles==
==Synopsis==
===Act 1===
The operetta is set in 1885, near the Dragoman pass. Serbia and Bulgaria are at war, and the wife and daughter of the Bulgarian Colonel Popoff are missing their menfolk – the Colonel himself, and Major Alexius Spiridoff, who is engaged to the daughter, Nadina. Mascha, a young cousin of Nadina who is staying at the Popoff&#x27;s residence, also hero worships Alexius. Alone in her bedroom, Nadina clutches her sweetheart&#x27;s photograph and sings of her admiration and love for her &quot;brave hussar&quot; and longs for his return.

An intruder (Bumerli) climbs in through her bedroom window. He is a very ordinary person, nothing like the ideal hero Nadina has been worshipping. In fact he has escaped the battle taking place nearby by climbing the Popoffs&#x27; drainpipe. He is in Serbian uniform, but responds to Nadina&#x27;s patriotic posturing by revealing that his is actually Swiss, and is serving in the Serbian army as a mercenary. When she threatens to call for help he briefly threatens her with his revolver – but soon puts it down. When she picks it up and threatens him he laughs at her – he uses his ammunition pouch to carry chocolates and has no cartridges to load his weapon.

In spite of herself Nadina is amused and charmed by this &quot;Little Chocolate Soldier&quot;. He recounts an incident in battle when a foolish Bulgarian officer lost control of his horse, thus leading an inadvertent cavalry charge against Serb guns that happened to have been supplied with the wrong ammunition and were thus overrun. Nadina is furious to realise that the officer concerned was her Alexius, and orders Bumerli to leave at once – when he starts to leave she calls him back. Just in time, as a squad of bumbling Bulgarian soldiers, led by Captain Massakroff, arrive in pursuit. Fortunately Bumerli has had time to hide behind the bed curtains, and Nadina assures them that she has not seen the intruder. While the Bulgarian soldiers search the rest of the house, Aurelia, Nadina&#x27;s mother, and young Mascha come to the bedroom. They are sure something is going on, and when they spot Bumerli&#x27;s revolver the secret is out.

By the time the soldiers have left the house and Nadina opens her bed curtains Bumerli is asleep, and the lonely women are all very taken with him. They awaken him with their chatter, but he is exhausted and only wants to go back to sleep again. They ransack the house for civilian clothes to enable him to escape – each, unknown to the others, slipping a photograph of herself into the pocket of his jacket – a favourite house coat of the Colonel&#x27;s.

===Act 2===

Six months have passed, and the war is over. Outside the Popoff residence the family and servants are welcoming their heroes home. Nadina is delighted to have her Alexius back, but she soon realises that he is far from the hero she imagined, but is boastful and self-centred. When he boasts of the incident of the charge on the guns he is embarrassed to realise that Nadina knows more about the matter than she should. The ladies are embarrassed in their turn when Popoff tells them of a Swiss soldier in the Serbian army that they met after the fighting was over – and who told them a very funny story of escaping from a battle by hiding in a house where he was sheltered by three ladies who all fell in love with him.

The plot thickens as Bumerli himself returns to the scene. He has come to return the clothes he used to escape, and manages to slip them to the ladies without suspicion being aroused. The menfolk are a little puzzled to meet him again, but they invite him to stay for the wedding of Nadina and Alexius. Bumerli manages to get Nadina alone, and confesses that it is his love for her that has drawn him back. He cannot bear to see her married to another, and starts to leave. Heartbroken herself, Nadina asks for her photograph – but Bumerli never looked in the pocket of her father&#x27;s housecoat – it is still there!

The Colonel is wearing his favourite coat – there is some slapstick as the ladies try to stop him looking in his pocket by finding him matches and a handkerchief. Eventually each of them retrieves a photograph from the pocket – each assuming it is hers. When Nadina goes to return her photograph to Bumerli she finds that it is Mascha&#x27;s, and that there is a compromising message on the back of it. She flies into a jealous fury that removes all possible doubt that it is Bumerli she really loves.

The guests gather for the wedding ceremony – including Captain Massakroff, who recognises Bumerli as the intruder he saw climb the drainpipe in Act I – in the resulting chaos Mascha produces Nadina&#x27;s photograph, with its compromising message. Popoff and Alexius are not very bright, but even they start to put two and two together. Alexius is furious with Nadina, and she in her turn declares that she no longer loves him. As the act curtain falls the wedding is definitely off.

===Act 3===
The scene returns to Nadina&#x27;s bedroom, where she is writing a letter to Bumerli. It is not friendly, as she is still jealous of Mascha. As she finishes the letter, Bumerli himself appears through the window. Nadina gives him his letter, but he does not take it seriously. If she did not love him she would not be so jealous.

Massakroff appears, with a challenge to a duel from Alexius to Bumerli. Bumerli accepts without hesitation, much to Nadina&#x27;s consternation. Alexius is also terrified – he would never have challenged his rival if he had not been sure he was too much of a coward to accept. It seems Alexius is coming round to the idea he would be happier with Mascha anyway.

Any doubts among the family that Bumerli would not make a good husband for Nadina are dispelled by the revelation that he is the son of a wealthy Swiss businessman, and all ends happily.

==Adaptations and song covers==
Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer wished to make a filmed version of &quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot; in 1940, but they were refused permission (or at least permission at a reasonable price) by Shaw. Instead, Louis B. Mayer bought the rights to Straus&#x27;s music, and used the plot from Ferenc Molnár&#x27;s play &quot;Testőr&quot; (also known as &quot;Playing With Fire&quot; and &quot;Where Ignorance is Bliss&quot;, and ultimately adapted by Philip Moeller as &quot;The Guardsman&quot;) as the plot of a 1941 film, &quot;The Chocolate Soldier&quot;, starring Nelson Eddy and Risë Stevens. The plot concerns the jealousy of a Viennese couple, Maria and Karl Lang. To test her loyalty, Karl masquerades as a Russian guardsman and tries to seduce Maria. Complications ensue. The film includes the following non-Straus selections:
*&quot;Mon cœur s&#x27;ouvre à ta voix&quot; from Camille Saint-Saëns&#x27;s &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;
*&quot;Evening Star&quot; from Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tannhäuser&quot;
*&quot;Song of the Flea&quot; by Modest Mussorgsky
*&quot;While My Lady Sleeps&quot; by Bronisław Kaper

A one-hour radio adaptation, with John Barclay as Bumerli, Gladys Swarthout as Nadina, and Nathaniel Shilkret conducting the orchestra, was broadcast in the US on May 22, 1934, on the popular program &quot;Palmolive Beauty Box Theater&quot;. A 1955 television film adaptation also starred Stevens, with Eddie Albert.

Nadina&#x27;s aria, &quot;My hero&quot;, has been performed by various singers. It was used in the 1950 film &quot;Two Weeks with Love&quot;, sung by Jane Powell. In 1955, actress Vivian Vance sang the song in the fourth-season episode of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; titled &quot;Ethel&#x27;s Home Town&quot;. It was Troy Shondell&#x27;s first single in 1958.

<text>Pirate TV is an American sketch comedy series that aired on MTV. The series premiered January 26, 1990.

==Overview==
Set on a boat that beamed illegal television signals, &quot;Pirate TV&quot; consisted of skits and parodies of commercials and television programs, including &quot;Rastapiece Theater&quot;, a takeoff of &quot;Masterpiece Theatre&quot; with a dreadlocked, patois-speaking host, and &quot;Reejok&quot; (jockstraps with inflatable pouches, à la Reebok&#x27;s &quot;Pump&quot; sneaker, popular at the time). It was co-created by Dave Kolin and Steve Kerper.

Originally airing as 13 one-hour episodes, they were later edited down to a half hour. Many of the concepts of the show, and indeed &quot;Rastapiece Theater&quot; itself, later transferred to Kerper and Kolin&#x27;s HBO series &quot;Hardcore TV&quot; (1992-1993)

The crew of the boat were played by, Boyd Hale (himself), James Rosenthal (himself), Gena Rositano (herself), Spruce Henry (himself) and Gregory Wolfe &amp; James Wolfe as &quot;the Wolfe Brothers.&quot;

Some episodes had a special guests such as Sgt. Slaughter, Maury Povich and Clarence Clemons.
Most notably was Tim Blake Nelson as &quot;Scab O&#x27;Hooley&quot;. He would race his pet rats to answer the great questions that plagued the world, so you could &quot;...Quit yer blatherin&#x27; and get on with yer miserable lives. This is Scab O&#x27;Hooley sayin, I&#x27;m not laughin atcha...I&#x27;m not laughin!&quot;

<doc id="919617" wikidata="Q1147086" url="?curid=919617" title="Catgut">
<text>Catgut (also known as gut) is a type of cord that is prepared from the natural fiber found in the walls of animal intestines. Catgut makers usually use sheep or goat intestines, but occasionally use the intestines of cattle, hogs, horses, mules, or donkeys. Despite the name, catgut is not made from cat intestines. In this case, &quot;cat&quot; is short for cattle. 

==Etymology==
The word &quot;catgut&quot; may have been an abbreviation of the word &quot;cattlegut&quot;. 
Alternatively, it may derive by folk etymology from &quot;kitgut&quot; or &quot;kitstring&quot; — the dialectal word &quot;kit&quot;, meaning fiddle, having at some point been confused with the word &quot;kit&quot; for a young cat, the word &quot;kit&quot; being possibly derived from Welsh. 
In the 16th century a &quot;kit&quot; was a &quot;small fiddle used by dancing teachers,&quot; a name probably derived from a shortening of Old English cythere, from Latin cithara, from Greek kithara (see guitar).

==Common uses==
===Musical instruments===
Historically, catgut was the most common material for the strings of harps, lutes, violins, violas, cellos, double basses, viols, acoustic guitars, and other stringed musical instruments, as well as the heads of older marching snare drums.

Most musical instruments produced today use strings with cores made of other materials, generally steel or synthetic polymer. Gut strings are the natural choice for many classical and baroque string players, and gut strings are still most commonly preferred in concert-tension pedal/grand and some lever harps because they give a richer, darker sound as well as withstanding high tension within low alto, tenor, and high-bass ranges. Many acoustic guitarists moved away from gut strings in the early 1900s when the C. F. Martin &amp; Company introduced steel strings, which gave greater volume to the guitar. &quot;The demand for steel came from ensemble players, who couldn&#x27;t make themselves heard clearly without it.&quot; Within a few years the majority of Martin guitars were made with steel strings to accommodate the demand. After World War II, most classical and flamenco guitarists switched from catgut to the new nylon strings for their greater smoothness, durability, and stability of intonation.

Before 1900, the best strings for musical instruments were reputedly from Italy. Musicians believed the best were from Naples, though Rome and other Italian cities also produced excellent strings. Today high quality gut strings are produced mostly in Italy, Germany, and the United States. They are also made elsewhere, for example in India, Mali, and Morocco, for local use.

===Sutures===
Catgut suture was once a widely used material in surgical settings. Catgut sutures remain in use in developing countries where they are locally less expensive and easier to obtain. Catgut treated with chromium salts, known as chromic catgut, is also used in surgery.

===Tennis racquets===
Natural gut is still used as a high-performance string in tennis racquets, although it had more popularity in the past and is being displaced by synthetic strings.

===Clocks===
Catgut is also traditionally used to hang the weights in grandfather clocks.

===Watches===
Catgut was also used in early pocket timepieces from their invention up until the use of the Fusee chain.

==Production==
To prepare catgut, workers clean the small intestines, free them from any fat, and steep them in water. Then they scrape off the external membrane with a blunt knife, and steep the intestines again for some time in potassium hydroxide. Then they smooth and equalize the intestines by drawing them out. Lean animals yield the toughest gut. Next, they twist the prepared gut strands together to make string. String diameter is determined by the thickness of the individual guts, and by the number used. A thin string, such as a violin E, uses only three or four guts, whereas a double bass string may use 20 or more. After twisting and drying, workers polish the strings to the required diameter.

Before the 20th century, the strings were simply rubbed with an abrasive to smooth them. Today they are generally ground down to the desired diameter using a centerless grinder. After drying and polishing, workers bleach and disinfect the strings using sulfur dioxide, dye them if necessary, and sort them into sizes.

Catgut sutures are normally treated with a chromium salt solution to resist body enzymes to slow the absorption process. These are called catgut chromic sutures; untreated catgut sutures are called catgut plain sutures.

<text>Rapso is a form of Trinidadian music that grew out of the social unrest of the 1970s. Black Power and unions grew in the 1970s, and rapso grew along with them. The first recording was &quot;Blow Away&quot; by Lancelot Layne in 1970. Six years later, Cheryl Byron (founder of the New York City based Something Positive Dance Company) was scorned when she sang rapso at a calypso tent; she is now called the &quot;Mother of Rapso&quot;.

It has been described as &quot;de power of de word in the riddim of de word&quot;. Though often described as a fusion of native soca and calypso with American hip hop, rapso is uniquely Trinidadian.

==History==

Rapso music is itself an evolution of the chantwell or griot tradition of African music in the diaspora. It is called &quot;the poetry of Calypso&quot; and &quot;the Power of the Word in the rhythm of the Word&quot;. Rapso is the poetic &quot;rap&quot; form of Trinbagonian music—the next evolutionary step of Calypso and Soca music. It also has origins in the oral tradition elements of the performances of traditional masquerade characters in Trinidad Carnival.

Traditional masquerade characters, such as the Midnight Robber, Pierrot Grenade, and the Wild Indians, each have particular forms of poetic and musical speeches that echoed ancient African masking and poetic traditions. Rapso borrowed many of the rhythmic and performance elements of these forms.

The first wave of rapso music occurred in the late 1960s with the invention of rapso by its pioneer Lancelot Layne. The second wave occurred in the late 1970s with Cheryl Byron who was the first woman to perform this brand of music in calypso tents, and mushroomed in the early &#x27;80s with the work of Brother Resistance and the Network Rhythm Band, alongside other artists such as Brother Cetewayo and Brother Book. This wave mainstreamed rapso music in Trinidad and Tobago and World Music.

The third wave of rapso occurred with the advent of young groups including Kindred, Homefront and Boyz &#x27;N The Road in the early 1990s. They were part of a musical movement entitled the &quot;Kiskadee Karavan&quot; that was led by businessman Robert Amar, who invested his money in the unleashing of the young musical genius of Trinidad and Tobago. The Karavan revolutionised Trinidad’s music by taking &quot;traditional&quot; forms such as the rapso and giving it modern production and promotional methods to take the music to stadiums in the native Trinidad and Tobago. This opportunity uncovered many talents on the ground, and created a series of anthemic musical singles. The song &quot;This Trini Could Flow&quot; by super-group Kindred took rapso into the 21st century and firmly entrenched the music as a form comparable to hip-hop and dancehall.

Modern Rapso music can be described today as the Trinbagonian equivalent of what is known as American rap music as groups like Boyz &#x27;N The Road and Khay (from Boyz &#x27;N The Road) produce and chant to beats and rhythms more heavily influenced by the modern American hip-hop music culture fused with R&amp;B and Jazz, as opposed to the traditional or &quot;Roots&quot; rapso (with calypso and soca music). Nonetheless, traditional rapso continues to live on as super-group Kindred and 3 Canal maintain the balance with the calypso and soca music influences.

==Calypso influence on rap==
The basic elements of hip-hop—boasting raps, rival posses, uptown throwdowns, and political commentary—were all present in Trinidadian music as long ago as the 1800s, though they did not reach the form of commercial recordings until the 1920s and 1930s. Calypso—like other forms of music—continued to evolve through the 1950s and 1960s. When rock steady and reggae bands looked to make their music a form of national and even international black resistance, they took calypso&#x27;s example. Calypso itself, like Jamaican music, moved back and forth between the predominance of boasting and toasting songs packed with &#x27;slackness&#x27; and sexual innuendo and a more topical, political, &#x27;conscious&#x27; style.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;rapso&quot; was not invented until 1980, when the revolutionary Network Riddim Band with its two chantwells Brother Resistance and Brother Shortman released &quot;Busting Out&quot;. Initially dominated by the children of the Black Power movement, changes came in the 1990s with the younger artistes adopting the art form, most significantly the bands Kindred, Homefront, 3 Canal and Ataklan.</text><links>

<text>A software component is a modular unit of software that encapsulates specific functionality. The desired characteristics of a component are reusability and maintainability.

==Value==

Components allow software development to assemble software with reliable parts rather than writing code for every aspect; allowing for implementation to be more like factory assembly than custom building.

==Attributes==

Desirable attributes of a component include but are not limited to:

* Cohesive encapsulates related functionality 

* Reusable

* Robust

* &quot;Substitutable&quot; can be replaced by another component with the same interface

* Documented

* Tested

==Third-party==

Some components are built in-house by the same organization or team building the software system. Some are third-party, developed elsewhere and assembled into the software system. 

==Component-based software engineering==

For large-scale systems, component-based development encourages a disciplined process to manage complexity.

==Framework==

Some components conform to a framework technology that allows them to be consumed in a well-known way. Examples include: CORBA, COM, Enterprise JavaBeans, and the .NET Framework.

==Modeling==

Component design is often modeled visually. In Unified Modeling Language (UML) 2.0 a component is shown as a rectangle, and an interface is shown as a lollipop to indicate a provided interface and as a socket to indicate consumption of an interface.

==History==

The idea of reusable software components was promoted by Douglas McIlroy in his presentation at the NATO Software Engineering Conference of 1968. (One goal of that conference was to resolve the so-called software crisis of the time.) In the 1970s, McIlroy put this idea into practice with the addition of the pipeline feature to the Unix operating system.

Brad Cox refined the concept of a software component in the 1980s. He attempted to create an infrastructure and market for reusable third-party components by inventing the Objective-C programming language.

IBM introduced System Object Model (SOM) in the early 1990s.

Microsoft introduced Component Object Model (COM)
in the early 1990s. Microsoft built many domain-specific component technologies on COM, including Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM), Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and ActiveX.

<text>Douglas Marland (born Marland Messner; May 5, 1934 – March 6, 1993) was an American writer, known for his work as the head writer of several soap operas.

==Career==
Marland began his career as an actor, appearing on the Irna Phillips series &quot;The Brighter Day&quot; and &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. He also did odd jobs on the side as a director for small theatre groups. On one such job, staging the DeSylva, Brown, and Henderson musical &quot;Good News!&quot;, he worked with Broadway dancer Edie Cowan and pianist Ethan Mordden, both of whom went on to professional careers as, respectively, choreographer and writer.

Marland began his writing career by authoring some Nick Carter mysteries, under one of the publisher&#x27;s standard pseudonyms. He first started writing scripts for soap operas in the 1970s, as a script writer for Harding Lemay on &quot;Another World&quot;.

==Soap operas==

=== &quot;The Doctors&quot;===
He was hired by NBC Daytime in 1976 after then head writer, Margaret DePriest, left &quot;The Doctors&quot;. Although Marland&#x27;s writing received critical acclaim and the show received Daytime Emmys, ratings dropped.

During his tenure on &quot;The Doctors&quot;, a variety of new acting talent were added to the program: Kathy Bates (Phyllis), Glenn Corbett (Jason Aldrich), Carol Potter (Betsy Match), Ted Danson (Mitch Pierson), and Jonathan Frakes (Tom Carroll), among other actors. Marland was instrumental in shifting the serial&#x27;s focus away from Hope Memorial Hospital to the Powers and Aldrich families, as well as the Dancy family, introduced by previous head writers Robert Cenedella and Margaret DePriest.

===&quot;General Hospital&quot;===
After his job on &quot;The Doctors&quot;, he was hired by ABC Daytime in 1978 to work with Gloria Monty on their serial &quot;General Hospital&quot;. At that time, the show was near cancellation. Marland&#x27;s writing, along with Monty&#x27;s extensive production changes, helped the show rise in the ratings.

Marland was instrumental in pairing the iconic of Luke Spencer and Laura Webber, as well as creating vixen nurse Bobbie Spencer, and the Quartermaine family. Although the changes at &quot;General Hospital&quot; were a success, Marland was not interested in moving to Los Angeles, where the show was produced, and didn&#x27;t like the show&#x27;s increased pacing by Monty. Marland left the show a year later.

===&quot;As the World Turns&quot; and &quot;Guiding Light&quot;===
Back in New York, he was asked by CBS Daytime to temporarily assume the head writing reins at &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, which he did for thirteen weeks.

In 1979, he assumed the head writing reins of &quot;Guiding Light&quot;. Marland&#x27;s run on &quot;GL&quot; produced popular storylines and characters. One character Marland introduced was Nola Reardon, played by Lisa Brown. The unconventional Nola started as a villainess and became the heroine of the show.

Another story was an envelope-pushing story that featured the character of Carrie Todd Marler (played by Jane Elliot). Carrie was diagnosed with multiple personalities, and Marland had barely delved into her psychosis when Elliot&#x27;s contract was abruptly terminated by Executive Producer Allen M. Potter in 1982; Marland resigned in protest.

===&quot;Loving&quot;===
Marland next teamed up with fellow writer Agnes Nixon to create &quot;Loving&quot;, which premiered in June 1983. He served as head writer for the show&#x27;s first two years. The show was a critical but not commercial success during the time that he wrote it.

===&quot;A New Day in Eden&quot;===
During the 1982–1983 season, he co-wrote, with James Rosin, a show that he had created, &quot;A New Day in Eden&quot; for the cable channel Showtime. The show was hailed as TV&#x27;s first &quot;nude&quot; serial, in which many cast members would perform their love scenes without clothes. The show thrived on the taboo, showcasing bodies and a perverse combination of sex and violence, including a deflowering in a barn, a sexual assault in a shower, and one story in which a woman seduced the rival for another man&#x27;s affections in a lesbian storyline. Despite its controversy and the fact that the cast included Steve Carlson, Jane Elliot (fresh from her run as Tracy on &quot;GH&quot; &amp; Carrie on &quot;GL&quot;), and Lara Parker (famous as the witch Angelique on the cult &quot;Dark Shadows&quot;) and that it was produced and sometimes directed by daytime veteran actress Susan Flannery, &quot;A New Day in Eden&quot; only lasted 66 episodes.

===Return to &quot;As the World Turns&quot;===
Marland was hired in 1985 to return to &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. Marland refocused the show and made the Hughes family central to the plot again. He utilized over 30 years of history to create new storylines for core characters Bob Hughes and Kim Hughes. (One story, where a child previously thought to be dead was found to be alive and living in England, was a dual role played by future Oscar-winning actress Julianne Moore.) He was also credited with bringing original cast members Helen Wagner and Don MacLaughlin back to the center the show as Nancy and Chris Hughes, after they&#x27;d been bumped to recurring status in 1982. When McLaughlin (and his character) died in 1986, Marland paired Nancy with Chief of Detectives Dan McClosky, and then chronicled McClosky&#x27;s subsequent battle with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. He also reached back to Lisa McColl&#x27;s 1965 stint on short-lived &quot;ATWT&quot; spinoff &quot;Our Private World&quot;, giving her a son, Scott Eldridge, hitherto unknown to viewers, who tracked her down as an adult. (He was said to have been born during the several-month-long lapse between when&quot; Private World&quot; ended and when Lisa resurfaced on &quot;ATWT&quot; in mid-1966.)

He also introduced a new working-class family, the Snyders, into the storyline and added new dimensions to the wealthy Lucinda Walsh (Elizabeth Hubbard) by tying the Walshes and Snyders together. This resulted in the pairing of Lily Walsh (Martha Byrne) and Holden Snyder (Jon Hensley). It was also revealed that Iva Snyder (Lisa Brown) was the biological mother of Lucinda&#x27;s adopted daughter Lily. The new Snyder family was based largely on Douglas Marland&#x27;s own experiences; he grew up on a farm in West Sand Lake, NY. In several interviews, Marland remarked that the character of Seth Snyder was based largely on his own life. Seth was the oldest child, who had been taken on great responsibility in helping to raise his siblings following patriarch Harvey Snyder&#x27;s death. This event was key to the formation of the Snyder family dynamic, in that Marland was allowed to write a strong and independent yet maternal figure in matriarch Emma Snyder (Kathleen Widdoes).

Marland was also responsible for adding the first gay male character on an American soap opera to his story during his tenure, Hank Elliot (Brian Starcher). The story was short-lived (Hank was featured for about 18 months), but groundbreaking; the soap opera became a pioneer for others who wished to put gay male characters, heretofore unseen, on their respective shows. Although the story centered on Hank, it allowed viewers to see another side to long running characters, when those characters reacted to the news that Hank was gay. Hank was written off of the show to take care of his lover Charles, who was dying of AIDS. Starcher was nominated for a Soap Opera Digest Award in 1990.

Marland diversified the previously white canvas of &quot;As the World Turns,&quot; introducing an Amerasian character as the child of a Vietnam vet, and also featuring a story of a mixed-race couple marrying and having a baby (and showing negative reactions to the marriage and birth). Another story featured town matriarch Nancy Hughes helping a young, illiterate African-American girl (played by singer/actress Lauryn Hill), learn to read.

Marland also penned a story featuring the character of Ellie Snyder having an abortion; abortion is a rarity in daytime and this again allowed Marland to write about both sides of a controversial issue.

Marland wrote ATWT until his death from complications after abdominal surgery on March 6, 1993.

== Marland&#x27;s Rules ==
During his tenure at &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, Marland gave an interview to a soap magazine with his rules on &quot;how NOT to ruin a soap&quot;. In the years that followed, and since his death, the rules have been much discussed in the serial press and by Internet soap opera fans. 

The rules are: 
* Watch the show.
* Learn the history of the show. You would be surprised at the ideas that you can get from the back story of your characters.
* Read the fan mail. The very characters that are not thrilling to you may be the audience&#x27;s favorites.
* Be objective. When I came in to (the show), the first thing I said was, what is pleasing the audience? You have to put your own personal likes and dislikes aside and develop the characters that the audience wants to see.
* Talk to everyone; writers and actors especially. There may be something in a character&#x27;s history that will work beautifully for you, and who would know better than the actor who has been playing the role?
* Don&#x27;t change a core character. You can certainly give them edges they didn&#x27;t have before, or give them a logical reason to change their behavior. But when the audience says, &quot;He would never do that,&quot; then you have failed.
* Build new characters slowly. Everyone knows that it takes six months to a year for an audience to care about a new character. Tie them in to existing characters. Don&#x27;t shove them down the viewers&#x27; throats.
* If you feel staff changes are in order, look within the organization first. P&amp;G (Procter &amp; Gamble) does a lot of promoting from within. Almost all of our producers worked their way up from staff positions, and that means they know the show.
* Don&#x27;t fire anyone for six months. I feel very deeply that you should look at the show&#x27;s canvas before you do anything.
* Good soap opera is good storytelling. It&#x27;s very simple.

<text>Kieran Miles David Hebden (born September 1977), known as Four Tet, is an English electronic musician. He came to prominence as a member of the post-rock band Fridge before establishing himself as a solo artist with charting and critically acclaimed albums such as &quot;Rounds&quot; (2003), &quot;Everything Ecstatic&quot; (2005) and &quot;There Is Love in You&quot; (2010). In addition to his twelve studio albums as Four Tet, Hebden&#x27;s work includes a number of improvisational works with jazz drummer Steve Reid and collaborations with Burial and Thom Yorke.

Alongside his own recordings, Hebden has produced albums by American improvisational group Sunburned Hand of the Man and Syrian dabke singer Omar Souleyman, and arranged the 2021 Madlib album &quot;Sound Ancestors&quot;. He has also remixed tracks by artists including Aphex Twin, Bicep, Explosions in the Sky, Bloc Party, Super Furry Animals, Radiohead, Ellie Goulding, J Dilla, Lana Del Rey, Manic Street Preachers, Sia, Black Sabbath and Madvillain; several of these were collected on the compilation &quot;Remixes&quot; (2006). He has additionally performed DJ mixes, including sets with American producer Skrillex and British producer Fred Again.

==Early life==
Kieran Hebden was born in Putney, London, England, to a South African-born Indian mother and a British white sociology lecturer father. He attended Elliott School in Putney, where he formed the band Fridge with classmates Adem Ilhan and Sam Jeffers. The band signed a recording contract when Hebden was 15, and released their first album, &quot;Ceefax&quot;, on Trevor Jackson&#x27;s Output Recordings label in March 1997. While working with Fridge, Hebden began a degree in maths and computer sciences at the University of Manchester alongside the members of Simian Mobile Disco.

His stage name &quot;Four Tet&quot; is derived from the 1971 album &quot;4 Tet&quot; by Dutch jazz-saxophonist .

==Career==
Hebden&#x27;s first solo release was the 1997 single &quot;Double Density&quot;, released on the Output label under the artist name 4T Recordings. He began releasing material as Four Tet in 1998 with the 36 minute, 25 second single &quot;Thirtysixtwentyfive&quot;. Later that year, he released another single, the jazz-influenced &quot;Misnomer&quot;. 1999&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue&quot;, again on Output, was Four Tet&#x27;s first full-length album release and fused hip hop drum lines with dissonant jazz samples. This was followed by the double A-side single &quot;Glasshead&quot;/&quot;Calamine&quot;, which was to be Four Tet&#x27;s last release on Output. In late 1999, Warp Records released &quot;Warp 10 + 3: Remixes&quot;, a tenth-anniversary compilation of remixes of Warp tracks. Hebden contributed a remix of the opening track of Aphex Twin&#x27;s &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot;, which was considered to be his break-out release.

In 2001, Four Tet&#x27;s second album &quot;Pause&quot; was released on Domino Recording Company and found Hebden using more folk and electronic samples, which was quickly dubbed &quot;folktronica&quot; by the media and press in an attempt to label the style (often also applied to artists such as Isan and Gravenhurst). &quot;Rounds&quot; was released in May 2003. Three singles were released from the album: &quot;She Moves She&quot;, &quot;As Serious as Your Life&quot; and &quot;My Angel Rocks Back and Forth&quot;. This last single was released as an EP featuring remixes by electronica duo Icarus and Isambard Khroustaliov along with additional Four Tet tracks &quot;I&#x27;ve Got Viking in Me&quot; and &quot;All the Chimers&quot;. An accompanying DVD featured all of Four Tet&#x27;s videos to date. In addition, the closing track &quot;Everything is Alright&quot; was featured in a U.S. Nike commercial in 2001 and 2002.

At the beginning of 2003, Four Tet opened for Radiohead on their European tour. A remix of the song &quot;Scatterbrain&quot; from Radiohead&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; was released in November 2003 as a B-side to the single &quot;2 + 2 = 5&quot; and later included on their 2004 EP &quot;COM LAG (2plus2isfive)&quot;. Furthermore, Hebden was among the people thanked by Radiohead in the booklet accompanying their 2007 &quot;In Rainbows&quot; &quot;discbox&quot; release.

A live album named &quot;Live in Copenhagen 30th March 2004&quot; was released in April 2004 as a limited edition, available exclusively from the Domino Records website.

In March and April 2005, Four Tet performed two shows of improvisational music, in collaboration with jazz drummer Steve Reid, in Paris and London. He also appears on Steve Reid Ensemble 2005 album &quot;Spirit Walk&quot;. This collaboration was extended into a series of international tours, and the release of two albums, &quot;The Exchange Session Vol. 1&quot; and &quot;The Exchange Session Vol. 2&quot; over the course of 2005 and 2006.

His fourth studio album &quot;Everything Ecstatic&quot; was released on Domino on 23 May 2005. The video for the lead single, &quot;Smile Around the Face&quot;, features actor Mark Heap. On 7 November 2005, Domino released a DVD version of &quot;Everything Ecstatic&quot; featuring video clips for each track of the album plus a CD with new material, titled &quot;Everything Ecstatic Part 2&quot;, which was later made available as an individual EP.

Hebden has also remixed, under the Four Tet name, tracks by a wide range of artists including Tegan And Sara, Madvillain, Andrew Bird, Bloc Party, Super Furry Animals, Beth Orton, Badly Drawn Boy, CYNE, The Notwist, Boom Bip, Battles, Kings of Convenience, Lars Horntveth, Bonobo, Rothko, The xx, Thom Yorke and Radiohead. On 25 September 2006, Domino Records released &quot;Remixes&quot;, a two-disc compilation of Four Tet remixes. The first disc contains twelve Four Tet remixes selected by Hebden, with the second disc comprising every official remix to date (both by Hebden himself and by other artists) of Four Tet tracks, many of which had previously been available on vinyl only. A new EP, &quot;Ringer&quot;, was released on 21 April 2008.

In 2008, he collaborated with composer David Arnold to write &quot;Crawl, End Crawl&quot;, the song used for the end credits of the film &quot;Quantum of Solace&quot;. He worked on a secret collaboration with former schoolmate Burial the following year.

In November 2009, he released the fifth full-length Four Tet album. Heavily influenced by a period DJing at the Plastic People club in Shoreditch and entitled &quot;There Is Love in You&quot;, it was released on 25 January 2010. The album was preceded by a limited edition release of the 12&quot; single &quot;Love Cry&quot;.

In 2010, Hebden collaborated with Laurie Anderson playing keyboards on the song Only an Expert from her &quot;Homeland&quot; album. In 2011, he released a split 12&quot; with Burial and Thom Yorke, entitled &quot;Ego&quot;/&quot;Mirror&quot;. He began to release music under the alias Percussions, following a track he produced on his Fabriclive mix CD. He was chosen by Caribou to perform at the ATP Nightmare Before Christmas festival that they co-curated in December 2011 in Minehead, England.

In 2012, Hebden collaborated again with Burial on the track &quot;Nova&quot;.

The sixth full-length Four Tet album, &quot;Pink&quot;, consisting of eight tracks, six of them already released as singles, was released on 20 August 2012 through Hebden&#x27;s own record label, Text Records. Hebden followed up &quot;Pink&quot; with &quot;0181&quot; on 15 January 2013. &quot;0181&quot; is a collection of unreleased material from 1997 to 2001, collected as one track and released online. A vinyl version was also released on the Text Records label.

Hebden released the seventh Four Tet album, &quot;Beautiful Rewind&quot;, in October 2013, and his eighth album, &quot;Morning/Evening&quot; in July 2015.

Hebden undertook a month-long residency as Four Tet for online radio station NTS Radio in May 2014. He has been an occasional DJ for NTS, playing in February, June and November 2015, and again alongside fellow DJ and producer Floating Points in June and October 2016, and March 2017. In September 2017, Hebden released the ninth Four Tet album &quot;New Energy&quot;. That November he was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Remixed Recording, Production, Non-Classical, for his remix of The xx&#x27;s &quot;Violent Noise&quot;.

On 1 March 2019, Hebden released Only Human, his first new track since his last album, New Energy, the track was named &#x27;Best New Music&#x27; by Pitchfork, shortly after release. A month after, on 17 April 2019, Hebden released another new single, &quot;Teenage Birdsong&quot;.

In May 2019, Hebden played two shows at London&#x27;s Alexandra Palace, his largest shows to date. The performance was filmed as part of the music video for Teenage Birdsong. A live recording of the two shows was released on 29 July 2019 under his &quot;4TLR&quot; moniker.

On 29 August 2019, Hebden had released a collection of three brand new songs as part of an EP called &quot;Anna Painting&quot;. The project was made in collaboration with painter Anna Liber Lewis, and features artwork by Liber Lewis in the release.

On 21 January 2020, Hebden announced his tenth album &quot;Sixteen Oceans&quot; for release in March.

Starting in September 2020, Hebden began a string of concurrent live streams. The livestreams included songs from other artists as well as his own remixes. The music was accompanied by various animations from artists, including Anna Liber Lewis. Some of the material was released on Christmas Day of 2020 across two albums, &quot;Parallel&quot; and &quot;871&quot;, under the Four Tet and 00110100 01010100 monikers respectively. Over a year later, on 28 October 2021, the live stream concluded.

Information about a second collaboration with Burial and Thom Yorke, entitled &quot;Her Revolution / His Rope&quot;, surfaced around 2 December 2020, and a very limited 12&quot; was released in three known record stores. Hebden collaborated with Madlib for the album &quot;Sound Ancestors&quot;, which was released on 29 January 2021.

In August 2021, Hebden filed a legal suit against Domino Records for &quot;damages of up to £70,000&quot; in an ongoing dispute regarding streaming royalties. The case pertained to Hebden&#x27;s recording contract with Domino, which he signed in February 2001. Hebden argued that the contract entitled him to 50% of all of his royalties from streaming services based outside of the United Kingdom. Domino argued that contractual clause cited by Hebden does not apply to streaming royalties. The label, citing a separate clause, argued that Hebden &quot;was only entitled to 75% of 18% of the dealer price (i.e. a 13.5% royalty rate).&quot; A settlement out of court was not reached, and the case would be decided upon by a judge of the Business and Property Courts of the High Court of Justice. In November 2021, three albums by Four Tet were removed from streaming services. Hebden claims he was informed by Domino&#x27;s legal team that the label would remove his music from all digital platforms &quot;in order to stop the case progressing&quot;, which he disagreed to. In June 2022, Hebden announced that he won the suit in the Intellectual Property Enterprise Court, receiving £56,921.08, plus his legal costs, after Domino agreed to backpay the 50 percent rate.

In February 2023, Hebden, along with Skrillex and Fred Again, played a 5-hour set in a sold-out show at Madison Square Garden.

In a series of tweets on 12 April 2023, Hebden announced that he was working on a new album with music planned to be released &quot;before the shows start&quot;, in reference to his May 2023 tour with Squidsoup. He also announced that he was working on music with William Tyler. On 25 April, Four Tet&#x27;s single &quot;Three Drums&quot; was played on BBC Radio 6 Music before being released. Although it appeared that his new album was completed and pressed on vinyl due to Instagram stories and a tweet, &quot;TEXT055&quot; was instead a collaboration between Fred Again and Brian Eno.

Hebden released &quot;Three&quot; on 15 March 2024. He first previewed the album with its opening track &quot;Loved&quot; on 10 January 2024. On 14 February 2024, to coincide with Valentine&#x27;s Day, Hebden released the track &quot;Daydream Repeat.&quot; On 9 September 2024, Hebden released the single &quot;In My Dreams&quot;, in collaboration with singer Ellie Goulding.

In November 2024, Hebden received two Grammy nominations for his album &quot;Three&quot;, for &quot;Best Dance/Electronic Recording&quot; with &quot;Loved,&quot; and for &quot;Best Dance/Electronic Album.&quot; He also received a nomination for &quot;Best Dance/Electronic Recording&quot; for his production on &quot;leavemealone&quot;, a collaboration between Fred Again and Baby Keem. 

==Musical style==
AllMusic&#x27;s Paul Simpson called Hebden &quot;perhaps the definitive indie electronic artist&quot;, noting that his &quot;experimental yet highly accessible recordings, which blend organic and electronic sounds, have earned widespread acclaim from critics and fans of electronic music as well as indie rock.&quot; His work has drawn influence from styles such as spiritual jazz, krautrock, folk music, and hip hop. According to Piotr Orlov of &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, Hebden&#x27;s music has touched on genres such as folktronica, electronic jazz and global trance, with his 2003 album &quot;Rounds&quot; specifically drawing from hip hop&#x27;s collage approach and &quot;pushing IDM into a whole new space.&quot; Hebden rejected critics&#x27; early labeling of him as a &quot;folktronica&quot; artist as misleading, calling attention to the influence of hip hop producers such as Rodney Jerkins and Timbaland on his work instead.

An avid moviegoer during his school days at Highgate, he was inspired to make his own films by the work of French New Wave directors like Jean Luc Godard, François Truffaut and Claude Chabrol. Lyne was among a generation of British directors in the 1970s, including Ridley Scott, Alan Parker, Tony Scott and Hugh Hudson, who would begin their career making television commercials before going on to have major success in films. Their techniques in making commercials were admired and copied by major names in the film industry, with Lyne stating: &quot;I remember making this advertisement up in Yorkshire when I got a message that Stanley Kubrick had called. He&#x27;d seen an ad I&#x27;d made for milk in which I&#x27;d used a particular type of graduated filter. He wanted to know exactly which filter I&#x27;d used.&quot; Two of Lyne&#x27;s early short films, &quot;The Table&quot; (1973) and &quot;Mr Smith&quot; (1976), were entries in the London Film Festival. Lyne made his feature filmmaking debut in 1980 with &quot;Foxes&quot;, a look at the friendship of four teenage girls growing up in the San Fernando Valley, starring Jodie Foster.

His next film, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Flashdance&quot;, was an innovative blend of rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll, new dance styles, and visual imagery. Lyne&#x27;s visuals (reminiscent of his 1970s UK commercials for Brutus Jeans), wedded to Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s score, propelled the story of an aspiring ballerina (Jennifer Beals, in her film debut) who works in a factory by day and dances in a club at night. The film generated over $200 million worldwide and was the third highest-grossing film of 1983. The film was also nominated for four Academy Awards, with the theme song, &quot;What a Feeling&quot;, winning the Oscar for Best Song. In 1986, Lyne attracted controversy with &quot;9½ Weeks&quot;. Based on a novel by Elizabeth McNeill, the tale of a sexually abusive relationship starred Mickey Rourke and Kim Basinger. Although considered too explicit by its American distributor, and cut for U.S. release, it became a huge hit abroad in its unedited version.

Lyne&#x27;s fourth film was &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot;, which generated over $320 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of 1987. Based on James Dearden&#x27;s British erotic thriller &quot;Diversion&quot;, the story of a happily married lawyer (Michael Douglas) who tries to break off an affair with an attractive single woman (Glenn Close), only to have her become obsessed with him and endanger his family, the film struck a chord with audiences. Deemed &quot;the zeitgeist hit of the decade&quot; by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; earned six Academy Award nominations including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actress (Glenn Close), Best Supporting Actress (Anne Archer), Best Screenplay and Best Editing.

In 1990, Lyne directed &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;. Written by Academy Award-winner Bruce Joel Rubin (&quot;Ghost&quot;) and starring Tim Robbins, Elizabeth Peña and Danny Aiello, the film takes audiences on a journey through Vietnam veteran Jacob Singer&#x27;s (Robbins) post-war life where apparent reality is interleaved with nightmarish hallucinations, leading to a twist ending. With &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot;, Lyne examined how the sexes look at relationships and money. Starring Robert Redford, Woody Harrelson and Demi Moore, &quot;Indecent Proposal&quot; became a worldwide box office hit. 

Lyne&#x27;s version of &quot;Lolita&quot;, based on the novel by Vladimir Nabokov and starring Jeremy Irons, was filmed for theatrical release in 1997, but American distributors shied away from it due to its controversial subject matter. The film premiered on Showtime and was so well-received that national theatrical distribution soon followed. His next film, &quot;Unfaithful&quot;, was loosely based on Claude Chabrol&#x27;s &quot;La Femme Infidèle&quot;. The movie stars Richard Gere and Diane Lane in a story of a marriage threatened by infidelity and murder. Lane received much praise for her performance, and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award for Best Actress.

=== Twenty-year gap ===
After &quot;Unfaithful&quot;, Lyne did not direct another film for twenty years.

In 2005, Lyne was reportedly linked to Warner Bros.&#x27; biopic of Johnny Stompanato, with Keanu Reeves portraying him and Catherine Zeta-Jones set to star as Lana Turner. In 2006, Lyne was committed to directing &quot;Two Minutes to Midnight&quot;, a Sheldon Turner-scripted thriller for 20th Century Fox. In 2007, he was circling to direct &quot;Prince of Thieves&quot;, which later became &quot;The Town&quot;. In 2012, Lyne was in talks to direct a film adaptation of the John Grisham novel &quot;The Associate&quot;. In 2015, there was talk of him directing Nicole Kidman in an adaptation of the 2013 A.S.A. Harrison novel &quot;Silent Wife&quot;. The next year, Michael Douglas and Halle Berry were connected to another Lyne project called &quot;Silence&quot;. As of 2022, none of these projects have come to fruition.

=== Return to directing ===
He most recently directed the erotic thriller &quot;Deep Water&quot;, based on a novel by Patricia Highsmith. Disney&#x27;s 20th Century Studios released the film on Hulu in the United States and on Amazon Prime Video in other countries. It is Lyne&#x27;s first directorial effort in 20 years, and the first erotic film released by Disney since &quot;Color of Night&quot; in 1994.

<doc id="919680" wikidata="Q6456919" url="?curid=919680" title="Palmdale Regional Airport">
<text>Palmdale Regional Airport is an airport in Palmdale, California, United States. The city of Palmdale took over the airport at the end of 2013, managing it via the Palmdale Airport Authority. The airport currently does not have any scheduled passenger airline service.

==Overview and facilities==
PMD and Plant 42 are separate facilities that share a common runway at the site. The facility is located in the Antelope Valley, approximately 60 miles from downtown Los Angeles.

The airport covers 5,832 acres (2,360 ha) at an elevation of 2,543 feet (775 m) above mean sea level. It has three runways with concrete surfaces: 4/22 is 12,001 by 150 feet (3,658 x 46 m); 7/25 is 12,002 by 200 feet (3,658 x 61 m); 72/252 is 6,000 by 75 feet (1,829 x 23 m). 7/25 was built to withstand an 8.3 Richter Scale earthquake, making it one of the world&#x27;s strongest runways. Another smaller runway, 72/252, is used as an assault strip.

In January 2024, Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger announced a Board-approved proposal for a preliminary site plan for a $1.6 billion, two million square foot bus and passenger rail car hub of manufacturing and innovation located on the eastern section of the airport&#x27;s land holdings. The project is tentatively named the &quot;Center for Transportation Excellence&quot;.

=== Museums ===
The Blackbird Airpark Museum and the adjacent Joe Davies Heritage Airpark (formerly the Palmdale Plant 42 Heritage Airpark) have been opened on Plant 42 property along Avenue P, with displays of the SR-71, U-2, Century Series fighters and other aircraft designed, engineered, manufactured, and flight tested at its facilities. Both museums are free to the public.

The Blackbird Airpark Museum is an extension of the AFFTC Museum at Edwards AFB, while the Heritage Airpark is operated by the city of Palmdale. Both are staffed by retirees who had previously worked in the aerospace industry, some actually having worked on the aircraft displayed at the two parks. All of the aircraft have been carefully restored for public display. The two airparks are located at Avenue P and 25th Street East near Site 9.

=== FAA operations ===
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) operates the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC) at its site near Plant 42 at Avenue P and 25th Street East. This center controls and tracks aircraft over much of the western United States, including parts of California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and the Pacific Ocean.

==History==
The origins of Palmdale Regional Airport go to the early 1930s, when a small airstrip was built in the desert. It was listed in 1935 documentation as CAA Intermediate #5. It was established by the Bureau of Air Commerce (later the Civil Aeronautics Administration) who maintained a network of emergency landing fields. It provided a pilot in distress with a better alternative than landing on a public road or a farmer&#x27;s field.

===World War II===
In 1940, Palmdale Army Airfield was activated as a United States Army Air Corps (later Air Forces) airfield for use as an emergency landing strip and for B-25 Mitchell medium bomber support training during World War II. It was one of many intermediate fields that were used as auxiliary fields or emergency landing fields by the AAF during World War II. Their dispersion along the air routes, their infrequent use, and their U.S. government ownership made them ideal for use by military aircraft. It acted as a sub-base for Muroc Army Airfield and Hammer Army Airfield.

===Postwar use===

Palmdale Army Airfield was declared a surplus facility in 1946 and was purchased by Los Angeles County for use as a municipal airport. The outbreak of the Korean War in 1950 caused the Air Force to reactivate the property for use in final assembly and flight testing of military jet aircraft.

Both the Air Force and its aircraft contractors needed a location away from major population centers - due to sonic booms, other noises and security concerns - but close enough to the major centers of aircraft design and production, while having excellent flying weather the year around. The land that became Plant 42 fit these criteria. Consequently, the Air Force agreed to purchase the land from Los Angeles County in 1951.

Lockheed assembled 250 new TriStar wide body jetliners at their manufacturing plant located at the airport from 1968 to 1984. The first L-1011 TriStar entered service with Trans World Airlines and Eastern Air Lines in 1972.

=== Past airline service ===
From 1970 to 1983 the Los Angeles Department of Airports, now called Los Angeles World Airports (LAWA), acquired about of land east and south of United States Air Force Plant 42 in unincorporated Los Angeles County to be developed into the future &quot;Palmdale Intercontinental Airport,&quot; an alternative to LAX. LAWA has not developed its Palmdale airport land beyond the small airport terminal.

From the late 1960s and early 1980s, commuter air carriers Cable Commuter Airlines followed by successor Golden West Airlines operated de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprop service from the airport with several nonstop flights a day to Los Angeles (LAX). By 1983, Mojave Airlines was operating several nonstop flights a day to LAX with Beechcraft C99 commuter turboprops.

In 1989, LAWA and the U.S. Air Force came to an agreement concerning use of the Plant 42 complex&#x27;s facilities and land for commercial use. The agreement allows a maximum of 400 flights per day.

In 1990, America West Airlines was operating nonstop service to Las Vegas and Phoenix with de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8 turboprops. However, this America West service lasted less than a year. Also during the 1990s, several commuter airlines used the Palmdale Regional Airport passenger terminal sited on Plant 42. These air carriers included SkyWest Airlines operating as the Delta Connection flying Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner propjets nonstop to LAX in the early 1990s and Mesa Airlines operating as United Express flying Beechcraft 1900C turboprops to LAX in the mid 1990s. Both airlines operated up to six round trip flights a day between the airport and LAX before ceasing all service. This civilian terminal was unused from 1998 to 2004.

In March 2001, Los Angeles County hired Tri-Star Marketing to prepare the presentations needed to bring air-passenger service back to Palmdale Regional Airport.

On December 29, 2004, civilian use resumed when Scenic Airlines began scheduled service to North Las Vegas, Nevada, although that service officially terminated in January 2006.

In January 2007, subsidies valued at $4.6 million, with $2 million slated to underwrite losses incurred from providing airline service, were raised to restore commercial service to the airport. The incentive package included a $900,000 grant from the federal government to the city of Palmdale to develop regional airport service. The terminal was remodeled and reopened in May 2007. Convincing airlines of the marketability of the airport without subsidies has been difficult. The communities around LAX and Burbank do not want the noise of additional flights, but most Antelope Valley residents support expanding service at Palmdale.

In February 2007, the city of Palmdale and LAWA selected United Airlines to provide service between Palmdale and San Francisco International Airport (SFO). (The only other proposal was from Delta Air Lines to Salt Lake City). The United Express flights operated by SkyWest Airlines offered twice-daily, Canadair CRJ-200 regional jet service beginning on June 7, 2007. Between June 7 and December 31, 2007, the airport served 12,022 passengers, about 58 per day. On September 3, 2008, the San Francisco United Express service operated by SkyWest Airlines was increased from two 50-seat regional jets a day to four 30-seat Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia turboprop flights per day. On its September 18 schedule update, United canceled all flights beginning December 7, 2008, the day after the expiration of the federal grant and 18 months after the beginning of the SFO-PMD services. United&#x27;s service was the last scheduled airline service at the airport.

The airport was included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a primary commercial service facility based on enplanements in 2008 (more than 10,000 per year). The airport had 10,392 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 82% more than the 5,712 in 2007.

In late 2008, the city of Palmdale expressed interest in assuming operations at Palmdale Airport, including management of the terminal, taxiways, and parking, from LAWA. LAWA indicated that it was receptive to transferring the lease. The city took over the airport at the end of 2013, managing it via the Palmdale Airport Authority. In 2019, the city contracted with outside consultants to develop a new passenger terminal on city property, which was intended to serve the needs of defense contractors based at Plant 42 and Edwards Air Force Base. As of August 2022, these plans were awaiting approval by the Air Force, which needed to sign a joint use agreement before site development could begin.

== Popular Culture ==
A terminal building set was built within a disused hangar at the airport for filming use during production of the 2004 film The Terminal. Around 40 national chains volunteered to build replicas of their shopping outlets on site, in order to take advantage of screen exposure in the Steven Spielberg film.

The hangar space was used again to stage the sea battle scene in the 2007 film Pirates Of The Caribbean: At World’s End.

<doc id="919686" wikidata="Q2164863" url="?curid=919686" title="Headset (bicycle part)">
<text>The headset is the set of components on a bicycle that provides a rotatable interface between the bicycle fork and the head tube of a bicycle frame. The tube through which the steerer of the fork passes is called the head tube. A typical headset consists of two cups that are pressed into the top and bottom of the headtube. Inside the two cups are bearings which provide a low friction contact between the bearing cup and the steerer.

==Sizes==

Traditional bicycle head tubes and headsets are sized for a diameter steerer tube (also known as the fork column). Many frame and fork manufacturers are now building their parts around a steerer tube with a diameter of . The larger diameter of the head tube and headset gives added stiffness to the steering portion of the bicycle.

Common sizes

**26.4 mm crown race (ISO standard)
**27.0 mm crown race (JIS standard)

Other steerer tube sizes are becoming common, more so all the time.

*, as used in the OnePointFive International Standard.
*Cannondale Headshok. Although a Headshok steerer is close to it is actually . The headtube dimensions for and Headshok are very similar, differing only in the minimum press depth.
* &quot;tapered&quot; headsets (2009 onwards). The lower bearing is for increased stiffness and the upper is for reduced weight and to match existing stem interfaces.

The stack height of a headset is the total assembled height of the headset components and, in the case of a threadless system, the stem, discounting the tangs which press into the head tube and (in the case of threaded headsets) the thickness of the top seal of the locknut. The stack height of a frame and fork is the difference between the steerer tube length and the head tube length. Stack height is critical because a headset with a greater stack height than the frame and fork will not fit; the locknut will not thread on sufficiently (threaded) or there will be no room for the stem (threadless). If the headset has a lower stack height than the frame and fork, spacers are added to make up the difference.

==Types==
There are a few different types of headset distinguishable by the way the bearings are held in place (with a lock nut or with a clamping stem), or by where they are located (inside or outside the head tube).

===Threaded===

Threaded headsets are used with forks that have a threaded steerer tube and are the traditional type (as shown in the above picture). There are eight parts in a threaded headset (from bottom to top): crown race, lower bearings, lower frame cup (pictured as &quot;lower head-tube race&quot;), upper frame cup (pictured as &quot;upper head-tube race&quot;), upper bearings, upper race or cone, washer, locknut.

The order of installation of a typical headset follows. The steerer tube is cut to the appropriate length by the bicycle fork manufacturer and the top of the steerer is threaded using a rolling process. This process assures that no material is lost and the steerer would not be weakened as with a die or lathe cutting. Threaded forks necessitate that the threads on the steerer only use the top , therefore the forks are sold in varying lengths. If there is a need to use a fork that is too long, meaning the fork steerer is not threaded down far enough, a bicycle mechanic can use a die to extend the threads. This is not recommended if the threads need to be cut farther than an inch or so. As a side note, one should never try to thread an unthreaded steerer after manufacturing as this will weaken the steerer tube. The threads are normally of the ISO standard 1″-24 TPI (25.4×1.058 mm), but other standards exist. The headtube may be faced and then the cups are pressed into the headtube using a special press that ensures they are square and true. The fork crown may be faced and then the crown race is pressed on to the fork crown with a special press that also makes sure that it is square and true. Then the bearings are placed on top of the crown race, after which the steerer tube is inserted into the headtube. The upper bearings are placed in the upper cup, and the upper race is screwed onto the steerer. A washer, frequently a keyed washer, is placed on top of the upper race and a locknut is screwed on top of that.

The adjustment of the headset to remove play is as follows: the upper race or cone is screwed down until it contacts the bearings in the upper cup. A slight preload is applied by turning the upper cone and additional or of a turn. The locknut is then tightened and the headset is checked for play and smooth operation. Readjustment takes place as necessary.

The stem, of the quill variety, is attached to the fork&#x27;s steerer tube using an expander bolt which fits through the stem from the top with a wedge at the bottom, the stem fits inside the steerer tube and can be adjusted to the correct height without disturbing the headset. To free the stem for adjustment, undo the bolt on the top of the stem a couple of turns and give the bolt a sharp tap to disengage the wedge.

====Internal====

Like threadless headsets, threaded headsets can also be internal. Under the internal design, the races and cones are embedded into the head tube, creating a tidy, streamlined appearance. No component is visible between the fork crown and head tube except for perhaps a plastic ring, and only the locknut protrudes from the top of the head tube. In the image shown of the 2016 Brodie Quantum&#x27;s steering assembly, the lock nut is hidden from view by a plastic cover. The widened top and bottom sections of the head tube contain the bearings. A quill stem inserts into the steering tube.

===Threadless===
The threadless headset is a more recent design. U.S. Patent 5095770 is owned by Cane Creek Cycling Components and expired on September 29, 2010. Headsets of this type are often referred to by the Dia-Compe (now Cane Creek) registered trademark &quot;Aheadset&quot;, and are manufactured under license. Like a traditional headset, it uses two sets of bearings and bearing cups. Unlike a threaded headset, a threadless headset does not have a threaded top headset race or use a threaded steerer tube. Instead the steerer tube extends from the fork all the way through the head tube and above the headset, and is held in place by the stem clamped on top.

Tightening a threadless headset requires tightening the preload bolt (or cap bolt) in the cap on the top of the stem. This bolt is connected to a star nut driven down into the steerer tube that acts as an anchor by gripping the inside of the steerer tube with a downward force. The star nut may be replaced by a self expanding wedge in some designs. The bolt compresses the stem down onto spacers, usually aluminum, which in turn compress the headset bearing cups. The preload bolt does not hold the fork onto the bike; after the preload is set, the stem bolts must be tightened to secure the fork in place. The adjustment must be made such that there is no play in the bearings, but allow the fork to turn smoothly without binding or excessive friction.

In the threadless headset system, the spacers are important in placing the stem and preload bolt in the correct position on the steerer tube. Thus the &quot;stack height&quot; of the stem becomes important. The steerer tube of the fork must be cut to length such that it leaves at least enough of the steerer tube protruding above the headset for the stem to clamp on to; if the steerer tube is cut longer than the stem, then spacers are used to fill the gap between the stem and the conical compression washer. Bicycle racers seeking the greatest saddle-to-handlebar drop for better aerodynamics will often forego spacers and cut the steerer tube down to exactly match the headset bearing cup stack height plus the stem height.

Cutting the steerer tube to its minimum length prevents switching to a taller stem or to a headset cups with a higher stack height. Any increase in handlebar height after this cut requires purchasing a new fork, a stem with more angular rise (some stems can be turned over for greater height), or a special adapter that clamps onto the steerer tube and gives a higher clamping position for the original stem. In addition, many riders who may have less flexibility than a seasoned racer may wish to gain more height on the handlebars, reducing the saddle-to-handlebar drop and providing a more upright and comfortable riding position. If an owner simply wishes to replace the headset with one having a slightly larger stack height, it may be possible for a bike shop or framebuilder to mill or re-face the head tube to gain an extra 1-2 mm of stack height without having to replace the fork. Many threadless fork steerer tubes are cut longer than necessary to allow for adjustments and the steerer tube above the stem is stacked with spacers that can be moved above or below the stem to fine-tune the handlebar height. Often these spacers are aluminum or carbon fiber, but titanium spacers are also available.

====Integrated bearing cups====
A relatively recent development, integrated headsets do away with the upper and lower bearing cups on threadless headsets and instead seat the bearings directly against the head tube of the frame. Favored sometimes for their aesthetic appeal, integrated headsets reduce the number of parts involved in the headset assembly. Prominent standards for integrated headsets include Cane Creek&#x27;s &quot;IS&quot; and Campagnolo&#x27;s standard, which is nameless apart from the manufacturer name. Chris King, a leading headset manufacturer, offers a vehement argument against the implementation of integrated headsets. The basis of King&#x27;s argument is that headtubes with bearing &quot;seats&quot; are far from being machined with reasonable precision. The headset cartridge bearings therefore sit somewhat loosely in the headtube of the bicycle (as opposed to being press fit). During use, the bearings, under thrust loads, will rock in their seats and will easily damage the softer frame material (often aluminum, although some titanium frames are manufactured for integrated headsets). Given enough damage to the frame, there would be no choice but to replace the frame, especially if the frame is made of an aluminum alloy (titanium and steel can potentially be repaired, but usually at great cost to the consumer).
King also argues that the integrated headset is largely a cost-cutting measure for many of the larger bicycle manufacturers, since integrated headsets are somewhat cheaper and take less time to install.

====Internal====
Sometimes referred to as semi-integrated headsets, internal headsets include all of the parts of conventional threadless headsets, but locate the bearings inside the head tube, instead of outside. Unlike integrated headsets, internal headsets still employ cups between the bearings and the frame itself. Prominent standards in internal headsets include Chris King&#x27;s InSet and Cane Creek&#x27;s ZeroStack. These designs use a 44.0 mm internal headtube diameter.

===Comparing threaded and threadless headsets===
The threaded headset has recently been replaced by the threadless headset on better quality bicycles for several reasons:

* Forks with a threadless steerer tube are cheaper for manufacturers because they can be cut to size at the point of sale and the manufacturer can use the same forks on different frame sizes. By comparison, forks with a threaded steerer tube must be matched with a frame&#x27;s headset tube length; therefore, bicycle manufacturers need to make or buy a different sized fork for each frame size.
* Regular allen wrenches can be used to adjust threadless headset bearings. By comparison, large, and relatively expensive, wrenches are required to adjust threaded headset bearings; their size generally precludes carrying them on the road.
* Threadless headsets and forks are quicker to install, saving manufacturing costs.
* A threadless headset and fork is marginally lighter than an equivalent threaded headset and fork.
* A threadless stem is more rigidly attached to the forks, giving improved rigidity at the handlebars.
* On bicycles which have not been maintained, water can find its way between the stem and steerer tube of threaded headsets, causing corrosion and seizing.

Threaded headsets have some advantages as well:
* Threaded steerer tubes are matched to the frame at the factory simplifying the adjustment of handle bar height.
* Threaded headsets use a quill stem that can be adjusted vertically over a wider range than typical threadless headset stems.

===Adjustable head angle===
At least one manufacturer, Cane Creek, offers an after-market threadless headset bearing kits that enables changing the steering axis angle. When all else remains the same, this alters the geometric trail of the bike.

==Bearing types==
Bicycle headset bearings are usually ball bearings, either loose balls, caged balls, or presealed in a cartridge; needle bearings are also available.

It is important to distinguish different standards of cartridge bearings in Integrated headsets.
There are three integrated standards which are not compatible with each other. The numbers (45/45, 36/45, 36/36) refer to the angle on the cartridge bearing they use. All these bearings look similar.

Campagnolo Standard: 45/45. (often referred as Campagnolo standard) This is common in BMX frames, BMX-derived dirt jump frames (like the Transition Trail-Or-Park). They are also common on road bikes. Three most common manufacturers are Campagnolo, FSA and Cane Creek. Head tubes with this standard have a 42.0 mm inner diameter.

Cane Creek Standard: 36/45. Very common on mountain bike frames and a fair number of road frames. Most frames made by Giant that have integrated head-tubes use this standard (which amounts to a lot of bicycles). Two major manufacturers: FSA and Cane Creek. Head-tubes with this standard have a 41.1 mm inner diameter, and Cane Creek claims its CC Standard headsets will fit in a Campagnolo Standard head tube using a 0.25 mm shim under the top cap of the headset.

FSA Standard: 36/36. No one uses this standard for fully integrated headsets (bearing sitting in frame) except for a few niche brands. There are still a lot of 36/36 bearings as they are used in all FSA&#x27;s semi-integrated (internal cup) headsets and some of their standard headsets as well.

==Standard measurements==
Frame and headset manufacturers have developed several sizing standards:

===Fork dimensions===
===Cylindrical bore head tubes===
Traditional headset cups are pressed into a cylindrical head tube. Some standard dimensions of the head tube on the frame (for traditional and semi-integrated/ZeroStack) are:

===Integrated head tubes (with chamfers)===
Bike frames with integrated headsets have cups machined directly in the frame, and the bearing sits directly into the frame instead of via separately installed cups. Fewer tools needed compared to traditional bearing cups which need to be pressed into the frame using special tools (or a hammer and wood block).

==Wear and failure modes==
Headsets on bicycles, particularly those without fenders, are exposed to water and grit thrown off by the front tire, which causes rust and rapid wear. Better headsets use rubber lip seals or &quot;O&quot; rings (dirt skirt) to try to keep water out, with varying degrees of success. External Neoprene bands with a Velcro fastening are available to wrap and protect the lower race, and are removable for cleaning. Some cyclists remove the fork and reassemble with a section of old inner tube over the lower race, which performs the same function, albeit with less convenience.

On bicycles ridden only in dry conditions and/or with fenders, the normal failure mode is a progressive notchiness in the steering, described as &quot;indexing&quot; in the bicycle world, caused by pitting of the races or false brinelling, although the term stems from a misunderstanding of the cause; true brinelling is caused merely by pressing the ball axially into the race, and it is almost impossible to replicate this damage even by striking the fork crown repeatedly with a hammer. The pits are by far deepest at the front and back of the head tube, and are actually caused by flexing of the fork blades, which is transmitted to the steerer tube. This misaligns the bearings and causes fretting, a small amplitude, large stress movement which tears metal from the races at the points where the balls rest.

The solution is to have a 45 degree interface in the headset where this flexing movement can be accommodated, preserving the relative alignment of the races and allowing the ball bearings to take pure axial and rotational loads. Shimano cartridge bearing headsets do this by allowing the cartridges to move relative to the pressed-in cups, while Stronglight roller bearing headsets, and most threadless headsets, now have loose upper and lower races which can move relative to the cups. Modern headsets, therefore, rarely suffer from false brinelling.

A less common headset failure is really a frame failure. The head tube can stretch, allowing a headset cup, which is supposed to be a tight interference fit, to become loose in the tube. Lugless frames are most vulnerable; in a lugged frame the lug reinforces the top and bottom of the head tube and generally prevents stretching of this type. A loose cup can be fixed with a retaining compound such as Loctite 660, and some manufacturers produce slightly oversized cups to cope with this situation. It is usually the lower cup that is affected.

==Add-ons==
In order to provide a cable stop for front cantilever brakes or centerpull brakes, a hanger may be incorporated into the headset, either as part of the washer between the top race and the lock nut in the case of threaded headsets, or as part of a spacer between the top race and the stem in the case of threadless headsets.

<text>Sean Pero MacPherson Cameron (born 5 June 1974) is a New Zealand basketball coach and former player. A FIBA Hall of Fame member, he captained the New Zealand Tall Blacks from 2000 to 2010, helping lead New Zealand to the semifinal of the 2002 FIBA World Championship, earning an All-Tournament Team selection in the process.

== Professional career ==
=== New Zealand NBL ===
In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Cameron played for Mobil Marters Northland in the Conference Basketball League (CBL) where he won a championship in 1991. In 1992, Cameron began playing in the New Zealand National Basketball League for the Waikato Warriors. He went on to win 11 championships (the most in New Zealand NBL history – nine as a player, two as a coach), made the league&#x27;s all-star five seven times, and won the Kiwi MVP award five times. During his career, he played for 11 seasons for the Waikato franchise (played under all three names – Warriors, Titans and Pistons) and seven seasons for the Auckland Rebels.

=== Australian NBL ===
Cameron played five seasons in the Australian National Basketball League, two for the New Zealand Breakers and three for the Gold Coast Blaze. He played for both clubs in their respective inaugural seasons (Breakers in 2003–04 and Blaze in 2007–08). In a total of 130 ANBL games, he averaged 8.7 points, 4.2 rebounds and 2.0 assists per game.

=== Overseas ===
Cameron played six and a half seasons overseas; one for the Ipoh Red Eagles of Malaysia in 1995–96, four for the Chester Jets of England, one for Banvit of Turkey in 2005–06, and half a season playing for Mahram Tehran of Iran in 2007.

== National team career ==
Cameron was first selected for the Tall Blacks in 1994. In 2000, for the Sydney Olympics, he became co-captain of the side, and was elevated to sole captain the following year. His most memorable moment as captain of the Tall Blacks came in 2002 when the team stunned the basketball world by making the semi-finals of the 2002 FIBA World Championship, eventually losing to Germany for fourth place. In the tournament, Cameron averaged 14.7 points, 5.0 rebounds and 3.6 assists per game and became the only non-NBA player to make the All-Tournament Team. He was joined on this team by established NBA superstars Dirk Nowitzki and Peja Stojaković and NBA rookies-to-be Yao Ming and Manu Ginóbili.

Cameron retired from international duties having played in two Summer Olympic Games (Sydney 2000 and Athens 2004) and three FIBA World Cups (2002, 2006 and 2010).

In August 2017, Cameron became the first New Zealander to be inducted into the FIBA Hall of Fame as a player, with the official ceremony occurring on 30 September 2017 in Switzerland.

== Coaching career ==
Cameron began his coaching career with the Wellington Saints in 2010, going on to lead the club to a sixth NBL championship and winning the Coach of the Year award in his first year. He led the Saints to a second consecutive championship in 2011 and subsequently joined the Gold Coast Blaze&#x27;s coaching staff as an assistant in 2011–12.

In June 2011, Cameron was named an assistant coach of the Tall Blacks.

After two more seasons as the Saints&#x27; head coach, Cameron joined his beloved Waikato Pistons as the team&#x27;s head coach/player development manager for the 2014 season. However, in November 2014, the Pistons pulled out of the 2015 season due to financial reasons and he subsequently returned to the Saints head coaching position on a one-year deal on 14 January 2015.

On 9 December 2015, Cameron joined the Gold Coast Rollers as the men&#x27;s team head coach for the 2016 Queensland Basketball League season. He continued on as coach of the Rollers in 2017.

In December 2019, after eight years of being an assistant, Cameron was appointed head coach of the Tall Blacks. In September 2021, he was reappointed Tall Blacks coach for three years.

In October 2021, Cameron signed a one-year deal to be director of basketball for the Taranaki Airs. He also served as the team&#x27;s assistant coach in 2022.

In December 2022, Cameron was appointed assistant coach of the Brisbane Bullets for the rest of the 2022–23 NBL season. He parted ways with the Bullets following the season.

In August 2024, Cameron parted ways with the Tall Blacks after five years as head coach.

== Personal life==
Cameron&#x27;s mother, Mata, from the Māori Ngāpuhi iwi, is an ex-New Zealand representative and a long-time coach of New Zealand age groups. His father is Scottish. His sister, Jody, is a former Tall Fern, and represented New Zealand at the Olympic Games in Athens 2004. His brother, Ray, is a former Waikato Titans/Pistons player. His other sisters, Jeannie and Zeta, also played basketball at a high level.

Cameron and his wife Jennelle have three children. His sons, Tobias and Flynn, were part of the NZ Junior Tall Blacks team that competed at the 2017 FIBA Under-19 Basketball World Cup. Flynn is a member of the Tall Blacks senior team for the 2023 FIBA World Cup, which is coached by his father.

<doc id="919692" wikidata="Q11704324" url="?curid=919692" title="Masonic conspiracy theories">
<text>Hundreds of conspiracy theories about Freemasonry have been described since the late 18th century. Usually, these theories fall into three distinct categories: political (usually involving allegations of control of government, particularly in the United States and the United Kingdom), religious (usually involving allegations of anti-Christian or Satanic beliefs or practices), and cultural (usually involving popular entertainment). Many conspiracy theories have connected the Freemasons (and the Knights Templar) with worship of the devil; these ideas are based on different interpretations of the doctrines of those organizations.

Of the claims that Freemasonry exerts control over politics, perhaps the best-known example is the New World Order theory, but there are others. These mainly involve aspects and agencies of the United States government, but actual events outside the US (such as the Propaganda Due scandal in Italy) are often used to lend credence to claims.

Another set of theories has to do with Freemasonry and religion, particularly that Freemasonry deals with &quot;the occult&quot;. These theories have their beginnings in the Taxil hoax. In addition to these, there are various theories that focus on the embedding of symbols in otherwise ordinary items, such as street patterns, national seals, corporate logos, etc.

There are Masonic conspiracy theories dealing with every aspect of society. The majority of these theories are based on one or more of the following assumptions:
*That Freemasonry is its own religion, requires belief in a unique &quot;Masonic god&quot;, and that belief in this &quot;Masonic god&quot; is contrary to the teachings of various mainstream religions (although usually noted in terms of being specifically contrary to &quot;Christian&quot; belief) 
*That the 33rd degree of the Scottish Rite is more than an honorary degree, coupled with the belief that most Freemasons are unaware of hidden or secretive ruling bodies within their organization that govern them, conduct occult ritual, or control various positions of governmental power
*That there is a centralized worldwide body that controls all Masonic Grand Lodges, and thus, all of Freemasonry worldwide acts in a unified manner

==List of conspiracy theories associated with Freemasonry==
Notable conspiracy theories involving Freemasonry include:
===Political===
* That the British judiciary is heavily infiltrated with Masons, who give fellow Masons &quot;the benefit of the doubt&quot; in court, subverting the legal system
Some conspiracy theories involving the Freemasons and the Illuminati also include the Knights Templar and Jews as part of the supposed plan for universal control of society. This type of conspiracy theory was described as early as 1792 by multiple authors, beginning in France and Scotland.
* That Freemasonry is a Jewish front for world domination or is at least controlled by Jews for this goal. An example of this is the anti-Semitic literary forgery &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot;. Adolf Hitler believed that Freemasonry was a tool of Jewish influence, and outlawed Freemasonry and persecuted Freemasons partially for this reason. The covenant of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas claims that Freemasonry is a &quot;secret society&quot; founded as part of a Zionist plot to control the world. Hilaire Belloc thought Jews had &quot;inaugurated&quot; freemasonry &quot;as a bridge between themselves and their hosts&quot;
* That Freemasonry is tied to or behind Communism. The Spanish dictator Francisco Franco had often associated his opposition with both Freemasonry and Communism, and saw the latter as a conspiracy of the former; as he put it, &quot;The whole secret of the campaigns unleashed against Spain can be explained in two words: masonry and communism&quot;. In 1950, Irish writer Denis Fahey republished a work by George F. Dillon under the title &quot;Grand Orient Freemasonry Unmasked as the Secret Power Behind Communism&quot;. Modern conspiracy theorists such as Henry Makow have also claimed that Freemasonry intends the triumph of Communism
* That Freemasons are behind income taxes in the US. One convicted tax protester has charged that law enforcement officials who surrounded his property in a standoff over his refusal to surrender after his conviction were part of a &quot;Zionist, Illuminati, Free Mason movement&quot;. The &quot;New Hampshire Union Leader&quot; also reported that &quot;the Browns believe the IRS and the federal income tax are part of a deliberate plot perpetrated by Freemasons to control the American people and eventually the world&quot;

===Religious===
There are a number of claims, predominantly made by conservative Protestants, that Freemasons at higher degrees deceive those at lower degrees, and gradually reveal a separate, occult religion:

* That Freemasons worship Baal, Baphomet, Dajjal, or Rahu
* That Freemasonry is occult in nature and worships their own particular god, such as GAOTU the &quot;Great Architect of the Universe&quot;, Gnosis, or Jahbulon, an amalgam of the gods YHWH, Baal, and Osiris
*The Syrian-Egyptian Wahhabi scholar Rashid Rida popularised anti-Semitic and masonic conspiracies across the Arab world and which would later be embraced by various Islamist movements in the 20th century. In Rida&#x27;s worldview, Freemasonry was invented by Jews. Rida&#x27;s views would be adopted in the 1988 Charter of Hamas

* That Freemasons (at NASA and other space agencies) deceive the public to hide the Earth being flat
* That humanoid reptiles are behind secret societies like the Freemasons and the Illuminati
* That some prominent murders involved Freemasons, including the cases of the Italian banker Roberto Calvi, and the U.S. president John F. Kennedy. A conspiracy theory about the death of the Turkish president Mustafa Kemal Atatürk is that he was poisoned to death by the Freemasons due to the closure of Masonic lodges in Turkey in 1935. In 2015, &quot;Yeni Şafak&quot; claimed that his former prime minister İsmet İnönü was in charge of planning the murder.

<text>A bicycle fork is the part of a bicycle that holds the front wheel.

A fork typically consists of two &quot;blades&quot; which are joined at the top by a fork &quot;crown.&quot; The crown is often at the front. Most suspension forks have an arch connecting the two side of the lowers (the part connected to the axle.) It is often in front of the stanchions (shaft the lowers slide on) but not always. Above the crown, a &quot;steerer tube&quot; attaches the fork to the bicycle and the handlebars (via a stem) allowing the rider to steer the bicycle. The steerer tube of the fork interfaces with the frame via bearings called a headset mounted in the head tube.

At the bottom of the fork, &quot;fork ends&quot; hold the wheel. Usually, either the axle is bolted to the fork, or a &quot;quick release skewer&quot; passes through a hollow axle, clamping the axle to the fork. A bicycle dropout (drop out, frame end, or fork end), is a slot in a frame or fork where the axle of the wheel is attached.

The term &quot;fork&quot; is sometimes also used to describe the part of a bicycle that holds the rear wheel, which on 19th century &quot;ordinary&quot; or &quot;penny-farthing&quot; bicycles was also a bladed fork. On most modern bicycle designs the rear wheel is now attached to a rear triangle comprising the seat tube, a pair of seat stays, and a pair of chain stays, rather than an actual fork, but the &quot;rear fork&quot; usage persists.

==Dimensions==

Forks have several key dimensions which include: offset, length, width, steerer tube length, and steerer tube diameter.

===Offset===
Bicycle forks usually have an offset, or rake (which is different from rake of motorcycle forks), that places the fork ends forward of the steering axis. This is achieved by curving the blades forward, angling straight blades forward, or placing the fork ends forward of the centerline of the blades. The latter is used in suspension forks that must have straight blades in order for the suspension mechanism to work. Curved fork blades can also provide some shock absorption.

The purpose of this offset is to reduce &#x27;trail&#x27;, the distance that the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the point where the steering axis intersects the ground. Too much trail makes a bicycle feel difficult to turn.

Road racing bicycle forks have an offset of 40–55 mm. For touring bicycles and other designs, the frame&#x27;s head angle and wheel size must be taken into account when determining offset, and there is a narrow range of acceptable offsets to give good handling characteristics. The general rule is that a slacker head angle requires a fork with more offset, and small wheels require less offset than large wheels.

===Length===
The length of the fork is usually measured parallel to the steerer tube from the bottom of the lower bearing race to the center of the front wheel axle. A 1996 survey of 13 700c road forks found a maximum length of 374.7 mm and a minimum of 363.5 mm.

===Width===
The width of the fork, also called spacing, is measured colinear with the front wheel axle between the inside edges of the two fork ends. Most modern adult sized forks have 100 mm spacing. Downhill mountain bike forks designed for through axles have 110 mm spacing.

===Steerer tube length===
The steerer tube is sized either to just accommodate the headset bearings, in the case of a threaded headset, or to contribute to the desired handlebar height, in the case of a threadless headset.

===Steerer tube diameter===
When sizing a fork to a frame, the diameter of the fork steerer or steer tube – or or – must not be larger than that of the frame, and the length of the steerer tube should be greater than but approximately equal to the head tube length plus the stack height of the headset. Adapter kits are available to enable use of a fork in a frame designed for a steerer tube or a fork in a frame.

Manufacturers of high-end bikes, both road and mountain, have adopted tapered steerer tubes as the de facto standard, with a OD at the top and a OD at the bottom.

===General sizing issues===
The blades must be the proper length to both accommodate the desired wheel and have the correct amount of rake to provide the approximate steering geometry intended by the frame designer. The functional length of the fork is typically expressed in terms of Axle-to-Crown race length (A-C). Also, the axle on the wheel must fit in the fork ends (usually either a 9 mm solid or hollow axle, or a 20 mm thru-axle). Some manufacturers have introduced forks and matching hubs with proprietary standards, such as Maverick&#x27;s 24 mm axle, Specialized 25 mm thru-axle and Cannondale&#x27;s Lefty system.

===Threading===
Fork steerer tubes may be threaded or unthreaded, depending on the headset used to attach the fork to the rest of the bicycle frame. An unthreaded steel steerer tube may be threaded with an appropriate die if necessary. The thread pitch is usually 24 threads per inch except for some old Raleighs which use 26.

==Suspension==

On most mountain bicycles, the fork contains a set of shock absorbers, in which case the blades typically consist of upper and lower telescoping tubes and are called &quot;legs.&quot; The suspension travel and handling characteristics vary depending on the type of mountain biking the fork is designed for. For instance, manufacturers produce different forks for cross-country (XC), downhill, and freeride riding. Forks designed for XC racing are typically lighter, less robust and have less suspension travel than those designed for rougher terrain and more extreme conditions.

Popular makers of suspension forks include Cannondale, Fox, SR Suntour, Manitou, Marzocchi, and RockShox.

Suspension fork design has advanced in recent years with suspension forks becoming increasingly sophisticated and diverse in design. The amount of suspension travel available has increased over time. When suspension forks were introduced, 80–100 mm of travel was deemed sufficient for a downhill mountain bike. Typically this amount of travel is now used in XC disciplines, with downhill forks now offering 150 to 200 mm of travel for handling extreme terrain. This is not the limit of suspension fork travel; for example, the Marzocchi Super Monster T offers 300 mm (12 inches) of travel.

Other advances in design include adjustable travel allowing riders to adapt the fork&#x27;s travel to the specific terrain profile. Typically, less suspension travel is needed for uphill or flat terrain than for downhill terrain. Advanced designs also often feature the ability to lock out the fork to eliminate or drastically reduce the fork&#x27;s travel for more efficient riding over smooth sections of terrain. This lockout can sometimes be activated remotely by a cable and lever on the handlebars.

The shock absorber usually consists of two parts: a spring and a damper or dashpot. The spring may be implemented with a steel or titanium coil, an elastomer, or even compressed air. The choice of spring material has a fundamental effect on the characteristics of the fork as a whole. Coil spring forks are often heavier than designs which use compressed air springs, but they are more easily designed to exhibit a linear, Hookean response throughout their travel. Replacing steel coils with titanium coils in a design can decrease the weight of the design but leads to an increase in expense. Air springs utilize the thermodynamic property of gases that their pressures increase as they are compressed adiabatically. As the &quot;spring&quot; is provided by air rather than a coil of metal, forks with air springs are often lighter. This makes their use more common in XC designs. Another advantage of this type of fork design is that the spring constant can be adjusted by adjusting the air pressure. This allows a fork to be tuned to a rider&#x27;s weight. One disadvantage of this design is the difficulty in achieving a linear response, as pressure varies approximately inversely (not linearly) with volume in a gas. As the fork compresses, the effective spring constant of the fork increases. Increasing the volume of the air inside the spring can reduce this effect, but the volume of the spring is ultimately limited, as it needs to be contained within the dimension of the fork blade.

The damper usually forces oil to pass through one or more small openings or shim stacks in the suspension fork. On some models, the spring, the damper, or both may be adjusted for rider weight, riding style, terrain, or any combination of these or other factors. The two components may be separated with the spring mechanism in one blade and the damper in the other.

==Variations==
There have been many fork design variations tried over the years. Several are still in use today.

===Suspension===
Some have employed linkages to provide the mechanical action instead of relying upon telescoping elements. Others, notably Cannondale use a single shock built into the steerer tube above the crown. Another notable recent development in fork technology is the Lauf Spring which utilises composite leaf springs to provide mechanical shock absorption and damping, whilst offering a sizable weight reduction compared to conventional designs
===Single blade===
Some manufacturers, such as Cannondale and Strida, offer a fork with a single leg. Many of Cannondale&#x27;s single bladed forks, called Lefty, are suspension forks, in either conventional or inverted configurations. These forks use linear needle roller bearings on octagonal races to transmit the steering torque to the wheel, while conventional two bladed suspension forks use tubular linear plain bearings. Use of a Lefty fork requires a special Lefty hub, which attaches to the fork end by means of a screw that presses the hub onto the axle that is fixed to the fork.

===Track bikes===
Track forks traditionally have round-section blades rather than the oval section used on road bikes, partly because a round section is stiffer under the lateral forces imposed by frequent sprinting but mainly because track racing tyres are always narrow and do not require the additional clearance afforded by oval blades. Round blades necessitate a special fork crown with matching round sockets. Track forks may not be drilled for a front brake if the bicycle is intended to be used only on a velodrome. The clearance between the tyre and the underside of the fork crown is often less than 5mm.

===Attachment to the frame===
Not all forks steer on bearings installed in a head tube. The forks on Stridas and Pedersen bicycles pivot about an axis external to the fork, supported at two different points on the frame. A new trend in triathlon bikes is similar, called a bayonet or external-steerer fork, but the pivot bearings are at the top and bottom of something that still resembles a head tube.

==Materials==
Forks have been made from steel, aluminum, carbon fiber, titanium, magnesium, and various combinations. For example, a fork may have carbon fiber blades with an aluminum crown, steerer tube, or fork ends.

In rigid forks the material, shape, weight, and design of the forks can noticeably affect the feel and handling of the bicycle. Carbon fiber forks are popular in road bicycles because they are light, and also because they can be designed to lessen and absorb vibrations from the road surface.

There have also been examples of wooden forks. However, these have not been common in the modern era.

==Attachment points==
Forks may have attachment points for brakes, racks, and fenders. These may be located in the crown, along the blades, and near the fork ends. These are often holes, threaded or not, and may be located on tabs that protrude.

It was founded in June 2003, shortly before the closure of Black Isle Studios, by ex-Black Isle employees Feargus Urquhart, Chris Avellone, Chris Parker, Darren Monahan, and Chris Jones.

Although they have created original intellectual property, many of their games are sequels based on licensed properties. Early projects included &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords&quot; and &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot;, both sequels to BioWare-developed games. The team then developed their first original game, &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot;, in 2010. Other notable works from Obsidian include &quot;&quot;, &quot;Dungeon Siege III&quot;, and &quot;South Park: The Stick of Truth&quot;, all of which are also licensed properties.

Throughout the studio&#x27;s history, many projects—including &quot;Futureblight&quot;, &quot;Dwarfs&quot;, &quot;Aliens: Crucible&quot;, and &quot;Stormlands&quot;—were canceled. Due to having so many projects canceled, the company entered a severe financial crisis in 2012. As a result, Obsidian decided to crowdfund their next game, &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot;, a role-playing game played from an isometric perspective, which ultimately became a success and saved the studio from closure. The team&#x27;s focus then changed from developing licensed titles to creating original games based on the studio&#x27;s own intellectual property, including a sequel to &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot;.

In November 2018, Obsidian Entertainment was acquired by Microsoft and became part of Microsoft Studios (now known as Xbox Game Studios). Their latest releases are the adventure game &quot;Pentiment&quot; and action role-playing game &quot;Avowed&quot;. The studio is currently developing &quot;The Outer Worlds 2&quot;.

==History==
===2003: Founding===
Obsidian Entertainment was founded by Feargus Urquhart, Chris Avellone, Chris Parker, Darren Monahan and Chris Jones on June 12, 2003. Prior to the establishment of Obsidian, they worked for Interplay Entertainment&#x27;s subsidiary Black Isle Studios. At Black Isle they created several role-playing games including &quot;Icewind Dale&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;Fallout 2&quot;, and collaborated with BioWare on &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;, and &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate II&quot;. Most of these games were critically and commercially successful, but Interplay&#x27;s financial situation was poor and the studio lost its license to produce &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-based games. This led to the cancellation of &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate III: The Black Hound&quot;. Urquhart and most of the staff members were dissatisfied and frustrated with the cancellation, as the game had already been under development for a year and a half. Urquhart became convinced that staying at Black Isle was no longer a &quot;viable option&quot; for the team, and decided to leave the company. He was in his early thirties at the time, and thought that if he did not start a new company soon, he might become too old to do so. Urquhart officially left Interplay in 2003 with Avellone, Parker, Monahan, and Jones, and founded Obsidian Entertainment with them the same year.

At the time of the company&#x27;s establishment there were seven employees, including the company&#x27;s five founders. Parker, Urquhart, and Monahan invested $100,000 to $125,000 into their newly founded company. When choosing the name of the company, they had prepared a short list of names for them to choose. The list included &quot;Scorched Earth&quot; and &quot;Three Clown Software&quot;. The team eventually chose &quot;Obsidian Entertainment&quot;, which they thought was strong, memorable, and felt similar to name of their old studio, Black Isle.

Upon its establishment, the studio needed more capital in order to keep its operation running, and thus needed to gain support from publishers. They approached Electronic Arts, but it did not result in a project. The studio also contacted Ubisoft looking to make a &quot;Might &amp; Magic&quot; game, but Ubisoft instead ended up contracting with Arkane Studios on that project, which became &quot;Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic&quot;. Obsidian pitched a game to Take-Two Interactive called &quot;Futureblight&quot;, which was described as a &quot;Fallout&quot;-style game powered by the &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot; engine. Similar to the EA and Ubisoft projects, &quot;Futureblight&quot; was never made.

===Late 2003–2008: Sequels to BioWare games===
Towards the end of 2003, the team was contacted by LucasArts president Simon Jeffrey, who requested that Obsidian make an action role-playing game set in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; universe. The team suggested a game concept which featured first-person lightsaber melee combat and that included established characters like R2-D2. Their idea was rejected, and Jeffrey instead asked Obsidian to create a follow-up to the BioWare-developed &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, as the team at Obsidian was familiar with the technology that the original game used. The partnership between the two companies finalized in late 2003, and development of the game, which became &quot;Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic II: The Sith Lords&quot;, began in October 2003. Obsidian was given 15 months to develop &quot;The Sith Lords&quot;. Originally set for a holiday 2004 release, LucasArts gave the studio an extension into 2005, before shifting the release date back to holiday 2004 following the Electronic Entertainment Expo. While LucasArts did dispatch members of its own staff to help get the game out on time, a number of features wound up being cut due to time constraints. Due to the moved deadline, Obsidian also did not have enough time to polish the game, and &quot;The Sith Lords&quot; suffered from crashes and other technical issues. Despite its issues, &quot;The Sith Lords&quot; was released to positive critical reception. The cut features were eventually restored by modders, who began their effort in 2009 and finished in 2012.

From the beginning, the studio&#x27;s goal was to be able to develop multiple projects simultaneously, and the decision led the company to expand very quickly. Soon after the development of &quot;The Sith Lords&quot; began, the team expanded to 20 employees. As of July 2004, it had expanded to 27, with 18 from Black Isle, and others from Blizzard Entertainment, Electronic Arts, Taldren, Totally Games, Treyarch, and Troika.

Prior to the launch of &quot;The Sith Lords,&quot; Obsidian was approached by Atari. Atari acquired the license to produce &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;-based games, and wanted Obsidian to create a sequel to &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, which became &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot;. Development of the game began in July 2005 with a team of ten people. The development of the game was headed by Monahan and Avellone. Obsidian became the game&#x27;s lead developer, while &quot;Neverwinter&quot; &quot;Nights&quot; creator BioWare provided technical assistance. While they were developing the game, the team&#x27;s size grew to about 50 people. The team were given sufficient time for the game&#x27;s development, and Atari was willing to delay the project&#x27;s targeted release window from Christmas 2005 to October 31, 2006. &quot;Neverwinter&quot; &quot;Nights 2&quot; received a generally positive critical reception. Two expansions, &quot;Mask of the Betrayer&quot; and &quot;Storm of Zehir&quot;, were released in 2007 and 2008.

During &quot;Neverwinter&quot; &quot;Nights 2&quot;″s development, the team approached other publishers to work on additional projects. Disney Interactive Studios commissioned Obsidian to develop a prequel to &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&quot; called &quot;Dwarfs&quot;, which was set to be a third-person action game for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Work began in 2005, and the team developed a prototype and was a year into development when Bob Iger replaced Michael Eisner as CEO of The Walt Disney Company. As CEO, Iger led Disney to head in a completely different direction, which made the Snow White franchise &quot;untouchable&quot; and resulted in the cancellation of the project. According to Urquhart, the team loved the game and its cancellation was a &quot;heartbreaking&quot; experience for them.

===2009–2014: &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot; and licensed properties===
With the development of &quot;Neverwinter Nights 2&quot; coming to an end, Obsidian was contacted by three different publishers. Electronic Arts wanted Obsidian to develop a role-playing game to compete with &quot;The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion&quot;, and another publisher was also interested in having Obsidian develop a fantasy RPG. The third publisher was Sega, who wanted the studio to develop an action role-playing game set within the &quot;Alien&quot; franchise. The game, titled &quot;Aliens: Crucible&quot;, was to feature base-building, dialogue choices, and character customization. In February 2009, Obsidian sent a prototype to Sega. Sega decided to cancel the game three weeks later without inspecting the demo. The cancellation was officially confirmed in June of that year. At around the same time, Atari again approached Obsidian, this time to revive &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate III&quot;. Obsidian requested a large budget, which Atari could not afford, and the deal between the two companies fell apart when Atari Europe was sold to Namco Bandai Games.

Despite the cancellation of &quot;Aliens: Crucible&quot;, Sega was still interested in working with Obsidian to develop another project. Instead of developing a sequel, they were asked to develop a role-playing game based on a new intellectual property. The team came up with an idea of a &quot;spy RPG&quot;. Sega approved the idea and decided to help with the game&#x27;s funding and serve as its publisher. The game would go on to become &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot;. The game&#x27;s development was troubled; the team did not have a precise vision for &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot; and struggled to settle on what gameplay elements to include and what the target audience should be. As a result, it suffered from an identity crisis and featured elements from multiple genres. Sega, for its part, was also unable to make decisions quickly and the publisher cut features from the game after their completion. This resulted in numerous delays and excessively long production time; &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot; took four years to develop. It was finally released in June 2010.

Their first original game, &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot; received mostly mixed reviews from critics. It was also a commercial failure for Sega, which led to their decision to put any plans for a sequel on hold. After the game&#x27;s launch, Urquhart admitted that there was still room for improvements. Even though the game was a commercial failure, it was well received by the community, which has often demanded that Obsidian make a sequel. Urquhart responded by saying that the team hoped that they can develop &quot;Alpha Protocol 2&quot;, and &quot;do better&quot; with it. Avellone later added that they were unable to develop a sequel because the rights to the game were owned by Sega and crowdfunding would not be a suitable option.

On February 11, 2010, Red Eagle Games and Obsidian announced that they would co-develop one or more games based on &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; fantasy novel series by Robert Jordan. On April 25, 2014, however, Urquhart told &quot;Computer &amp; Video Games&quot; that the agreement between the companies had dissolved after Red Eagle had failed to secure the necessary funding.

At the same time that &quot;Alpha Protocol&quot; was in development, Obsidian was also working on &quot;&quot;. Prior to working on &quot;New Vegas&quot;, they were contacted by Bethesda Softworks about developing a &quot;Star Trek&quot; game, but the idea never gained traction. After Bethesda released &quot;Fallout 3&quot; and began to shift its own focus back towards its &quot;Elder Scrolls&quot; series, it approached Obsidian with the idea of having the latter studio develop another game in the &quot;Fallout&quot; series, as several of Obsidian&#x27;s founders had worked on the franchise while at Black Isle. In developing &quot;New Vegas&quot;, Obsidian looked at fan requests, which led to &quot;New Vegas&quot; giving a more prominent role to the in-game factions. When the concept was pitched to Bethesda, it was immediately approved. The development of &quot;New Vegas&quot; began soon after the cancellation of &quot;Aliens: Crucible&quot;, and it was released in October 2010. It received generally positive reviews, with some critics saying that the game&#x27;s quality exceeded that of the critically acclaimed &quot;Fallout 3&quot;.

As was the case with &quot;The Sith Lords&quot;, the development team did not thoroughly assess &quot;New Vegas&quot; for bugs and glitches before it was released. Some players were unable to play the game due to constant crashes. These problems were later patched and fixed. Obsidian considered &quot;New Vegas&quot; to be a learning experience; it was the studio&#x27;s first AAA game, and it taught the studio how to manage quality assurance. Between &quot;The Sith Lords&quot; and &quot;New Vegas&quot;, Obsidian had built a reputation for creating games with technical problems. The team was determined to change this with future titles, and made improvements to their bug-tracking system, These improvements were applied to the studio&#x27;s next project, &quot;Dungeon Siege III&quot;, a sequel to the Gas Powered Games-developed &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot;, published by Square Enix. The game received mixed reviews upon release in 2011, but it enjoyed a stable launch. &quot;Dungeon Siege III&quot; was the first game to use Obsidian&#x27;s own in-house Onyx engine.

In 2011, the company began working on a third-person open world game named &quot;Stormlands&quot;. It was rumored that the game was being produced for the then-unannounced successor to the Xbox 360. The title was ultimately canceled in 2012 by its publisher, Microsoft Studios, causing Obsidian to lay off between 20 and 30 people. Obsidian then transformed &quot;Stormlands&quot; into another game title called &quot;Fallen&quot; and then pitched it to other publishers including 2K Games and Ubisoft. Despite hearing no response from them, &quot;Fallen&quot; became the foundation for one of Obsidian&#x27;s future games, &quot;Tyranny&quot;.

In October 2009, Obsidian was contacted by South Park Digital Studios to develop a game set within the &quot;South Park&quot; universe. The team originally thought the phone call from South Park Digital Studios was a prank carried out by another company located in the same building. Obsidian met with &quot;South Park&quot;″s creators, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, with the two parties agreeing that it was critical that the game share the television show&#x27;s construction paper-like visual aesthetic. Funding was originally provided by Viacom, the parent company of the television channel that &quot;South Park&quot; is broadcast on. In 2011, Viacom decided to let the video game publisher THQ take over as the game&#x27;s publisher. Shortly after THQ took over, they entered into a financial crisis, eventually going bankrupt in late 2011. With THQ unable to continue its publishing and funding roles, an auction was held for other publishers to acquire their titles. Obsidian was worried that if the project was canceled, they too would face severe financial difficulties. Eventually Ubisoft acquired the game, which was released as &quot;South Park: The Stick of Truth&quot; in March 2014. In mid 2014, the studio announced &quot;Armored Warfare&quot;, a tank game developed for My.com. It launched in open beta during 2015.

Obsidian has also maintained a friendly relationship with inXile Entertainment. Like Obsidian, inXile was founded by former employees of Interplay Entertainment. The two companies signed an agreement to share their technology with each other. Obsidian assisted in the development of inXile&#x27;s &quot;Wasteland 2&quot; after its Kickstarter campaign raised $2.1 million, &quot;Wasteland 2&quot; was released in late 2014 and received generally positive reviews upon release.

===2014–2018: Financial troubles and &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot;===
While the studio managed to complete &quot;South Park: The Stick of Truth&quot;, the company faced a precarious financial position. The studio received only a small &quot;kill fee&quot; for their work on an unannounced game, codenamed &quot;North Carolina&quot;. They also lost their bonus for &quot;&quot;, as the game failed to meet Bethesda&#x27;s standard—an aggregate review score of 85 at Metacritic—by 1 point. The team lacked sufficient resources to keep the company&#x27;s operation running. According to Adam Brennecke, an executive producer at Obsidian, if they failed to pitch a project to a publisher in time they would have exhausted their money and gone bankrupt. At that time, the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter was growing popular and Josh Sawyer, creative director of &quot;New Vegas&quot;, proposed that the studio put their canceled game on Kickstarter and attempt to secure funding for it there. Some team members were skeptical about the idea and feared that they may not even be able to raise $100,000 through the platform. The question of whether to pursue a Kickstarter campaign led to numerous debates between key members of the company. The debates ended when &quot;Double Fine Adventure&quot;″s campaign launched and saw huge success.

Secure in the belief that Kickstarter was a viable funding option, the team decided to use it to fund the development of a game they wanted to make for a very long time: a spiritual successor to &quot;Baldur&#x27;s Gate&quot;. The Kickstarter campaign for &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot; was launched in September 2012 under the working name &quot;Project Eternity&quot;, with Obsidian requesting $1.1 million. The studio approached Kickstarter with the mindset that if their campaign was successful the game could eventually be turned into a franchise, while if they were unsuccessful, they would attempt to refine their ideas and try again with another campaign.

Obsidian&#x27;s campaign was hugely successful, raising $4 million and breaking the record set by &quot;Double Fine Adventure&quot;. &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot; was released in March 2015 to a positive critical reception. Paradox Interactive served as the game&#x27;s publisher. Obsidian planned an expansion pack, called &quot;The White March&quot;. It was divided into two different parts, one of which was released on August 25, 2015, and the other on February 16, 2016. A board game for &quot;Pillars of Eternity&quot; titled &quot;Pillars of Eternity: Lords of the Eastern Reach&quot; was announced on May 19, 2015. It was developed by Zero Radius Games with input provided by Obsidian. Like the main game, it was funded through a Kickstarter campaign, and it reached its funding goal within a day.

In June 2015, studio co-founder Chris Avellone announced his departure from Obsidian. In August 2015, Obsidian partnered with inXile and Double Fine to launch a new funding website named Fig, with Urquhart serving as a member of the company&#x27;s advising board. The new platform&#x27;s aim is to offer &quot;equity crowdfunding&quot;, and it will only focus exclusively on video game-related projects. Obsidian is set to use Fig as its future crowdfunding platform.

It was announced in July 2015 that the company was working on the localization for &quot;Skyforge&quot;. On August 13, 2014, Obsidian announced that they had licensed the &quot;Pathfinder Roleplaying Game&quot; to make electronic games, starting with a tablet adaptation of it, which was released for iOS and Android devices in April 2016, with releases for other platforms to be announced. Paizo CEO Lisa Stevens also confirmed plans for an Obsidian-developed computer role-playing game. Urquhart had stated a desire to collaborate with BioWare again on a new &quot;Star Wars&quot; game. After the release of &quot;New Vegas&quot;, there is also a desire to work on another &quot;Fallout&quot; game.

On March 15, 2016, Obsidian announced their new project called &quot;Tyranny&quot;, an isometric RPG set in a world where evil has already won. The game was announced for release in 2016 on Microsoft Windows, Mac and Linux, and was published by Paradox Interactive. The game was originally called &quot;Fury&quot;, whose concept was created in 2006, and is set in &quot;a world that had been laid waste by a magical apocalypse&quot;. The concept later became &quot;Defiance&quot;, whose concept is similar to that of &quot;Tyranny&quot;. &quot;Defiance&quot;, along with ideas of Obsidian&#x27;s other projects later became &quot;Stormlands&quot;. As &quot;Stormlands&quot; was canceled, the company reconsidered the original idea of &quot;Defiance&quot; to make &quot;Tyranny&quot;. In April 2016, Leonard Boyarsky joined Obsidian, becoming the second Troika Games co-founder to work for the company.

On January 27, 2017, Obsidian announced &quot;Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire&quot; and launched a crowdfunding campaign on Fig to raise additional development funds. The project achieved its funding goal in less than a day, and was released in May 2018. In February 2017, it was announced that Obsidian were leaving the development of &quot;Armored Warfare&quot; in the hands of the game&#x27;s publisher to finish the project.

===2018–present: Microsoft acquisition===
On November 10, 2018, it was announced that the studio had been acquired by Microsoft and would become a part of its Microsoft Studios division. Following the announcement of the acquisition, during The Game Awards ceremony in December 2018, Obsidian announced a new intellectual property named &quot;The Outer Worlds&quot;, an action role-playing game set in an alternate future in which megacorporations began colonizing and terraforming alien planets. The game was released on October 25, 2019, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One, and a version for Nintendo Switch released on June 5, 2020. In November 2019, Obsidian announced its next game, titled &quot;Grounded&quot;, describing it as a &quot;survival adventure where you&#x27;re the size of an ant&quot;. On July 23, 2020, at the Xbox Games Showcase, Obsidian Entertainment revealed a brand new role-playing game called &quot;Avowed&quot; was currently in development for Microsoft Windows and Xbox Series X. In 2021, another unannounced open-world project for PC and console was also found to be in development through a technical artist job posting on the company&#x27;s website, which was later revealed to be &quot;The Outer Worlds 2&quot; during the Xbox + Bethesda E3 2021 showcase.

In 2022, Obsidian revealed &quot;Pentiment&quot;, a narrative adventure game for Microsoft Windows, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One with a November 2022 release window. The game director is Josh Sawyer, the game director of &quot;&quot;.

==Philosophy==
Obsidian built its reputation making sequels in well-established franchises including &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;, &quot;Neverwinter Nights&quot;, &quot;Fallout&quot;, and &quot;Dungeon Siege&quot;. Urquhart has stated that the company is fine with developing sequels, as they are often fun to make since the studio can &quot;get to go play in someone else&#x27;s world&quot; and further explore and expand upon the original games&#x27; ideas. The studio also believes that such licensed projects are easier to develop. Obsidian considered the making of these sequels as stepping stones towards eventually making original games based on their own intellectual property. The studio&#x27;s focus did later shift towards developing their own games, which allowed Obsidian to maximize their creative freedom and escape the constraints imposed by publishers. The studio has used the crowdfunding platform Kickstarter as an indicator to see whether a game or genre is popular or not.

As an independent company prior to their 2018 acquisition by Microsoft, Obsidian believed that they must act and react quickly to market changes and not stagnate on any certain point. While the core focus of Obsidian was still developing character-driven role-playing games, the team were willing to try out projects that are smaller and are in different genres. The decision to develop &quot;Armored Warfare&quot; was one result of this strategy.

A dungeon crawler game based on the story of the company&#x27;s five founders was made. The game was housed in an arcade cabinet inside Obsidian.

<doc id="919706" wikidata="Q7153734" url="?curid=919706" title="Paul Spong">
<text>Paul Spong (born 1939) is a New Zealand-born Canadian cetologist and neuroscientist. He has been researching orcas (or killer whales) in British Columbia since 1967, and is credited with increasing public awareness of whaling, through his involvement with Greenpeace.

==Early life==
Spong was born in Auckland, New Zealand, in 1939. He spent his early life in Whakatāne on the northeast coast of New Zealand. He studied law and psychology at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch. In 1963, Spong became a graduate student in Donald B. Lindsley&#x27;s laboratory in the Psychology Department at the University of California, Los Angeles. He also worked in Ross Adey&#x27;s Space Biology Lab in UCLA&#x27;s Brain Research Institute (BRI). Spong&#x27;s work included computer analyses of human brain wave patterns and tracking information pathways. Spong&#x27;s doctoral thesis was on sensory stimulation, perception, and human consciousness.

==Transfer to Vancouver==
In 1967, Murray Newman of the Vancouver Aquarium, asked Patrick McGeer, head of the Neurological Lab at the University of British Columbia (UBC), to find a &quot;whale scientist&quot; to assist him at the aquarium. Spong was selected as the candidate to work at the Vancouver Aquarium with orcas after a successful interview and a recommendation from the head of the lab at UCLA.

Spong arrived in Vancouver with his wife Linda in April 1967. This was a few months after Skana, the orca that Spong would be working with, had been bought by the Vancouver Aquarium from the Pacific Northwest Boat Show.

==Whale research==
Spong started his research by testing the vision of a dolphin named Diana. He determined that she could see underwater about as well as a cat can see in air. He then started testing Skana&#x27;s eyesight, rewarding her with half a herring every time she correctly distinguished between one and two vertical lines displayed on cards dropped into slots on an apparatus.  Skana&#x27;s task was to press a lever beside the card with two lines. The gap between the lines was varied to determine when Skana could no longer discriminate it. She took many hundreds of trials to learn the initial discrimination and became a willing performer.  Then, at a point when Skana was performing at 100% correct, she suddenly switched her behaviour and started pressing only the &quot;wrong&quot; lever.  Her performance fell to 0% and stayed there for many days. After some thought, and finding no comparable report in behavioural literature, Spong concluded that the whale was giving wrong answers on purpose and trying to communicate something to him. It was one word: NO! This was the first breakthrough Paul had in understanding orcas.

In April 1968, a second orca, Hyak was captured and brought to the Aquarium. Hyak was kept in a separate pool from Skana. After many months in isolation, Hyak had become sedentary, floating in one corner of his pool day and night. Spong decided to run an experiment to find out if an acoustic reward could be used to modify Hyak&#x27;s behaviour.  He placed an underwater speaker in one corner of the pool and connected it to audio equipment in his lab next door.  A 3 kHz tone started a trial. If Hyak moved out of his corner, Spong turned on a reward sound. Soon, Hyak was swimming sedately around the pool.  Spong then modified the reward criteria, essentially saying that anything except staying in one corner of the pool would be rewarded with sound. Soon, Hyak was an enthusiastic performer.  Spong learned the importance of acoustics for orcas through these experiments. His experiments with music and sound helped Hyak&#x27;s recovery from lethargy. When the Hyak and Skana were placed in the same pool, he observed that they vocalised together.

Among Spong&#x27;s frequent interactions with the whales was an event involving Skana. Spong had developed a habit of going to the Aquarium in the early morning, before the public arrived and sitting on a little training platform dangling his bare feet in the water.  Skana would come over to him and Spong would rub his feet over Skana&#x27;s head and body.  She seemed to enjoy that.  One morning, Skana swam slowly towards him as usual; then when just a couple of inches away from Spong&#x27;s feet suddenly opened her jaws and slashed them across Spong&#x27;s feet, so close he could feel her teeth on the tops and bottoms of his feet.  Naturally, Spong jerked his feet out of the water and sat trembling on the platform.  After quite some time he calmed down enough to put his feet back into the water.  Skana did it again and Spong reacted the same way.  By now Spong was curious.  What was Skana doing?  They went through this circle 10 or 11 times, until finally Spong was able to leave his feet in the water while Skana slashed her teeth across them without reacting. And then, Skana stopped.  In that moment, Spong realised with sudden insight that he was no longer afraid of Skana. She had quickly and efficiently de-conditioned Spong&#x27;s fear of her immensely powerful jaws and teeth.  Not only that, she had demonstrated that she was in total control of her body, and that she would not harm him.  Spong came to regard this as a great gift from Skana to him, as he has not since experienced fear in the presence of an orca.

===1968 lecture===
In 1968, Spong delivered a lecture at the University of British Columbia, describing his experience with the two whales at the Vancouver Aquarium. He described the whales as &quot;highly intelligent, social animals&quot; and advised that they should not be kept in captivity. He proposed transferring the whales to a semi-wild environment (such as Pender Harbour) in order to study them in their natural habitat. Spong also mentioned that humans could someday communicate with whales.

His comments from this lecture were published in local newspapers and interviews with radio stations were scheduled. However, Dr Newman from the Aquarium did not appreciate Spong&#x27;s recommendation about freeing the whales. This pushed Newman to suspend the research project Spong was working on. Shortly afterwards, Spong&#x27;s contract with the Aquarium came up for renewal. It was not renewed.

=== 1969 address ===
In June 1969, Spong gave an uninvited address to the Western Psychological Association in which he discussed his belief that taking psychedelic drugs helped him tune in to the whales&#x27; space and that this could help with orca–human communications

==KWOOF==
Killer Whale (Orcinus Orca) Foundation, or KWOOF was the foundation that Spong created after leaving the Aquarium. One purpose of the foundation was to stop whale captures in British Columbia, Canada. In December 1969, Spong travelled to Pender Harbour, where fishermen had captured 12 whales. Of the 12 whales, only one whale, Corky, has survived in captivity for more than 50 years. Spong has spent over three decades trying to free her.

==Maplewood Mudflats==
In 1972, Spong was living in a hippie commune in North Vancouver, called the &quot;Maplewood Mudflats&quot;. The District of North Vancouver wanted to turn the mudflats into a shopping centre. Spong led the opposition to the proposal. He was interviewed about the community in a film made for the NFB (National Film Board of Canada), by Robert Fresco and Kris Paterson, called &quot;Mudflats Living&quot;.https://www.nfb.ca/film/mudflats_living/  Another film was made by Seattle film maker Sean Malone called &quot;Living on the Mud&quot;.  While the squatters were evicted and their homes burned, the mudflats ultimately became a conservation area and wildlife preserve.

== OrcaLab ==
In the summer of 1970, Spong established the OrcaLab on Hanson Island. The Lab is located about 200 miles northwest of Vancouver on Blackney Pass. Orca families travel through the pass towards Johnstone Strait where they feast on migrating salmon, socialise with others of their community, and visit special &quot;rubbing beaches&quot;. Hanson Island was an ideal place to study orcas in their natural habitat.

At the laboratory, Spong started to monitor and record the modulations and songs sung by the whales with a hydrophone hung over a convenient rocky shelf in the bay and connected to a tape recorder. Eventually OrcaLab created a network of hydrophones that covered of ocean that became recognised as Critical Habitat for the Northern Resident orca community. At first the hydrophone signals were transmitted to the Lab by VHF radio, then by wireless microwave network. The operational philosophy of OrcaLab as a land based research station is &quot;learning without interference&quot;.

In 2000, Spong with Japanese colleagues set up an online portal for listening to the whales called &quot;www.orca-live.net&quot; which broadcast live sounds from OrcaLab&#x27;s hydrophones via the Internet, making it possible for people around the world with internet access to hear the sounds of orcas. The project also included a link to live video cameras. Viewers could log in and chat to fellow orca enthusiasts. A sister site was set up in Japan to watch turtles under the Nature Network banner. The turtle aspect of the project eventually ended, but the orca webcast continues. and has expanded in partnership with &quot;explore.org.&quot;

===Logging issue===

In the 1980s, the forest of Hanson Island was threatened by clearcut logging. Spong with his wife Helena Symonds and many allies including the &#x27;Namgis First Nation mounted a campaign that opposed the logging. Hundreds of letters from people around the world, including many from Europe and Japan were written to the British Columbia government. The logging company ownership changed. At one point, Spong travelled to New Zealand to appeal to the chairman of the new owner, Fletcher Challenge. Eventually, the forest of Hanson Island was protected under negotiations between the BC government, First Nations, environmental groups and logging companies that established the Great Bear Rainforest. Today it is managed by the Yukusam Heritage Society which includes representatives from three First Nations whose territory includes Hanson Island. OrcaLab&#x27;s work continues under license from the Society. Yulusam is the traditional name of Hanson Island.

== Whaling ==
In 1972, Spong met the Canada author Farley Mowat who was on a national tour promoting his book &quot;A whale for the killing&quot;. Farley convinced Spong about the desperate plight faced by many species of great whales.  Spong with his wife Linda began a campaign as the Canadian branch of Project Jonah aimed at convincing Canada to stop whaling.  Within a year, Canada did so.  Spong set his sights higher and convinced Greenpeace, at the time an anti-nuclear testing organisation, to take up the whales&#x27; cause.  &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; columnist Bob Hunter and other Greenpeacers formed the  &quot;Stop Ahab&quot; committee of Greenpeace and set about planning to confront whalers on the high seas.  In 1973, Spong and Hunter put on the &quot;Christmas Whale Show&quot; at Vancouver&#x27;s Queen Elizabeth Theatre to raise funds for a trip to Japan aimed at convincing that country to stop whaling.  Canadian musician Gordon Lightfoot called during the show and pledged $5,00 to support the effort.  In 1974, Spong and his family travelled to Japan and made presentations at 21 venues that included theatres in shopping malls and schools.  Spong also met with whaling industry and government officials.  These efforts unsuccessful, Spong returned to Canada convinced about the need to confront the whalers directly.  In 1975, Spong and his family took the now named &quot;Greenpeace Whale Show&quot; across Canada, then to Iceland and Norway.  In Norway, they visited the Bureau of International Whaling statistics where Spong, presenting himself as a whale scientist interested in sperm whales, obtained access to whalers&#x27; log books showing the locations of whaling operations off the coast of California.  When Hunter received this information he knew where to head but kept the information to himself until close to the time the Russian whaling fleet would be off the coast of California. The &quot;Phyllis Cormack&quot; headed there in July, confronting the whalers off Mendocino.  A dramatic scene  showing a harpoon flying over the heads of Hunter and Paul Watson in a tiny zodiac was aired on Walter Cronkite&#x27;s CBS evening news show just before the International Whaling Commission (IWC) met in London.  The result was a dramatic uplift in public awareness of the whaling issue and pressure on the Commission which was essentially a whalers&#x27; club at that point. Spong by happenstance managed to attend the Commission&#x27;s meeting, and subsequently was able to attend meetings of the IWC Scientific Committee and plenary meetings of the Commission as an NGO observer, one of many whose aim was to end commercial whaling.   

In 1982, the International Whaling Commission voted by 3/4 majority to impose a moratorium on commercial whaling.  The moratorium came into effect in 1986 and still stands today.  

== Corky ==
In 1990, Switzerland&#x27;s Bellerive Foundation hosted a conference to discuss cetaceans in captivity.  Spong presented information about the Northern Resident A5 pod member named Corky (A16) and suggested her as a candidate for release back into the wild, where her family was well known.  Corky had been captured in Pender Harbour, British Columbia, in 1969 and taken to Marineland of the Pacific, then to SeaWorld San Diego.  An international campaign followed highlighted by appeals to Sea World from children from 21 countries who contributed painted patches that were turned into a huge banner nearly 2 km long.  Corky&#x27;s FREEDOM BANNER was the inspiration of Austria&#x27;s Niki Entrup. It was displayed around Sea World, in European capitals, and in western US states and British Columbia.  Sea World remained obstinate in refusing to consider releasing Corky. In 2000 Corky&#x27;s mother Stripe (A23) died, ending the opportunity for them to meet again. The campaign to Free Corky continued and presently involves creation of the Double Bay Sanctuary on Hanson Island as Corky&#x27;s retirement home where ideally she would be cared for by the Sea World staff she knows well.  Owner of the old Double Bay lodge Michael Reppy, who is building the Sanctuary, has the support of the ‘Namgis First Nation as well as Spong.  Corky is still alive (as of July 2022) so she still has a chance to meet her family again.

<doc id="919708" wikidata="Q7696225" url="?curid=919708" title="Telegraph Avenue">
<text>Telegraph Avenue is a street that begins, at its southernmost point, in the midst of the historic downtown district of Oakland, California, and ends, at its northernmost point, at the southern edge of the University of California, Berkeley campus in Berkeley, California. It is approximately in length.

Among some Berkeley residents, especially University of California students, &quot;Telegraph&quot; refers mainly to a four-block section just south of the university, from Bancroft Way (which borders the campus) to Dwight Way. As a center of campus and community life, this section of Telegraph Avenue is home to many restaurants, bookstores, and clothing shops, along with street vendors occupying its wide sidewalks. Here Telegraph Avenue attracts a diverse audience of visitors, including college students, tourists, hippies, artists, street punks, eccentrics, and the homeless.

==Origins==

Telegraph Avenue originated from several separately named thoroughfares.

In 1859, a telegraph line was constructed between Oakland and Martinez by the Alta Telegraph Company, and the existing roads which ran alongside it were then renamed &quot;Telegraph Road&quot;. The segment of the Telegraph Road which ran from downtown Oakland out to the Peralta estate in Temescal was previously known as the &quot;Peralta Road&quot;. The segment which ran to and up Harwood&#x27;s (now Claremont) Canyon was first known as &quot;Harwood&#x27;s Road&quot;, named for William Harwood, an early Oakland politician who leased grazing land in the canyon.

The Telegraph Road followed the route of present-day Telegraph Avenue from Downtown Oakland to Temescal, then ran along what is now the route of Claremont Avenue up to the summit of the Berkeley Hills where it became Fish Ranch Road, named some time after 1870, the year the Oakland Trout Company incorporated its fish and frog farm in the vicinity.

In Berkeley, the trustees of the private College of California (the predecessor of the University of California) laid out a residential subdivision south of their new campus in order to finance its construction. The streets were named alphabetically from east to west; the third street was named &quot;Choate Street&quot;, after Rufus Choate. Oakland subsequently extended a road to connect with Berkeley&#x27;s Choate, but named it &quot;Humboldt Avenue&quot;.

Oakland&#x27;s first horsecar line was built in 1869 and ran along Telegraph Road to 36th Street. It was extended to Temescal a year later, then to the university campus via Humboldt and Choate after the university relocated from Oakland in 1873. A business district grew up along Choate and Humboldt Streets. The horsecar line was eventually replaced by a steam dummy line, and later by an electric streetcar line. This transportation corridor stimulated the development of neighborhoods along its route, as well as an amusement park, Idora Park, between 56th and 58th Streets.

When the segment of Telegraph Road leading up to Harwood&#x27;s Canyon was renamed &quot;Claremont&quot; to suit the interests of a developer of the district (see Claremont, Oakland/Berkeley, California), the cities of Berkeley and Oakland opted to change Humboldt and Choate to Telegraph since Oakland&#x27;s portion of the thoroughfare was already aligned with what remained of the old Telegraph Road between the new Claremont and downtown Oakland. Since Telegraph Road was a county road, a petition to change its name to Claremont Avenue was presented to the Alameda County Board of Supervisors on January 12, 1880. The petition was granted.

Although the 1880 petition included it, the segment of the old Telegraph Road that ran up the canyon to the summit of the Berkeley Hills was renamed Claremont Road by the Oakland City Council (which by then had annexed the previously unincorporated area) on February 14, 1913, acting on a petition by the owners of the Claremont Hotel. The only discernible difference in naming was the substitution of &quot;Road&quot; for &quot;Avenue&quot; for the canyon segment.

Berkeley changed Choate Street to Telegraph Avenue in 1890.

==Early-mid 20th century==

In 1910, Sather Gate was built at the northern end of Telegraph Avenue. The university built Sproul Hall on Telegraph in the 1940s. In the 1950s the campus expanded south to Bancroft Way; Telegraph Avenue was shortened by 1½ blocks and buildings were demolished to make room for Sproul Plaza and several other new buildings including the new student union building.

The Berkeley end of Telegraph Avenue, along with Sproul Plaza, has been the site of numerous protests and riots beginning in the 1960s. In 1969, Telegraph was the site of massive confrontation between police and demonstrators during the conflict over People&#x27;s Park. Alameda County Sheriff&#x27;s deputies killed one man (James Rector) and permanently blinded another (Alan Blanchard) when they fired buckshot loaded shotguns at people sitting on the roof above Telegraph Ave. At one point, protesters were chased down Telegraph as far as Willard Junior High School (now Willard Middle School) at Derby Street, with Sheriff&#x27;s deputies firing teargas canisters onto the school grounds.

The 1960s also saw the construction of the Grove Shafter Freeway, which parallels Telegraph Avenue half a block west, between Downtown Oakland and 56th Street. The freeway created a wall between Telegraph Avenue and present day Martin Luther King Jr. Way (formerly Grove Street), and sliced the Temescal District in half.

==Post–Vietnam War era==
The events of the 1960s and 1970s had made Telegraph, as well as Berkeley, a symbol of the counterculture of the 1960s. Over the next couple of decades the Berkeley end of Telegraph became home to increasing numbers of homeless people and panhandlers, and by the 1990s had become a destination point for runaways from around the United States. The numbers of panhandlers have decreased since a series of police sweeps in the late 1990s. University students remain the largest daily population on Telegraph, which still serves as the anchor of food, culture and student life on the south side of campus.

More recently, a Korean business district has emerged just south of Temescal along Telegraph Ave. Attempts to change the name of the area to Koreatown have led to controversy, as most residents of the surrounding neighborhoods do not identify as Korean or Korean-American. A large Ethiopian and Eritrean population has also resulted in a string of Ethiopian restaurants, cafes and social clubs, stretching along Telegraph from about 30th Street in Oakland all the way into Berkeley.

As a result of heavy foot traffic and the narrow width of the street, the area near the Berkeley campus is designated as a one-way street by the city, and there have been talks of completely eliminating car access, a topic still hotly debated in the city council. A proposal by AC Transit to build a Bus rapid transit line on Telegraph has stirred up controversy, especially on the northern end where it might result in the elimination of parking and/or car access.

<doc id="919720" wikidata="Q213693" url="?curid=919720" title="Simon Dubnow">
<text>Simon Dubnow (alternatively spelled Dubnov; ; ; 10 September 1860 – 8 December 1941) was a Jewish-Russian historian, writer and activist.

==Life and career==
In 1860, Simon Dubnow was born Shimon Meyerovich Dubnow (Шимон Меерович Дубнов) to a large poor family in the Belarusian town of Mstsislaw (Mogilev Region). A native Yiddish speaker, he received a traditional Jewish education in a &quot;heder&quot; and a &quot;yeshiva&quot;, where Hebrew was regularly spoken. Later Dubnow entered into a &quot;kazyonnoye yevreyskoe uchilishche&quot; (state Jewish school) where he learned Russian. In the midst of his education, the May Laws eliminated these Jewish institutions, and Dubnow was unable to graduate; Dubnow persevered, independently pursuing his interests in history, philosophy, and linguistics. He was particularly fascinated by Heinrich Graetz and the Wissenschaft des Judentums movement.

In 1880 Dubnow used forged documents to move to St Petersburg, officially off-limits to Jews. Jews were generally restricted to small towns in the Pale of Settlement, unless they had been discharged from the military, were employed as doctors or dentists, or could prove they were &#x27;cantonists&#x27;, university graduates or merchants belonging to the 1st guild. Here he married Ida Friedlin.

Soon after moving to St. Petersburg Dubnow&#x27;s publications appeared in the press, including the leading Russian–Jewish magazine &quot;Voskhod&quot;. In 1890, the Jewish population was expelled from the capital city, and Dubnow too was forced to leave. He settled in Odesa and continued to publish studies of Jewish life and history, coming to be regarded as an authority in these areas.

Throughout his active participation in the contemporary social and political life of the Russian Empire, Dubnow called for modernizing Jewish education, organizing Jewish self-defense against pogroms, and demanding equal rights for Russian Jews, including the right to vote. Living in Vilna, Lithuania, during the early months of 1905 Russian Revolution, he became active in organizing a Jewish political response to opportunities arising from the new civil rights which were being promised. In this effort he worked with a variety of Jewish opinion, e.g., those favouring diaspora autonomy, Zionism, socialism, and assimilation.

In 1906 he was allowed back into St Petersburg, where he founded and directed the Jewish Literature and Historical-Ethnographic Society and edited the &quot;Jewish Encyclopedia&quot;. In the same year, he founded the Folkspartei (Jewish People&#x27;s Party) with Israel Efrojkin, which successfully worked for the election of MPs and municipal councilors in interwar Lithuania and Poland. After 1917 Dubnow became a professor of Jewish history at Petrograd University.

He welcomed the first February Revolution of 1917 in Russia, regarding it, according to scholar Robert van Voren, as having &quot;brought the long-anticipated liberation of the Jewish people&quot;, although he &quot;felt uneasy about the increasing profile of Lenin&quot;. Dubnow did not consider such Bolsheviks as Trotsky (Bronstein) to be Jewish, stating: &quot;They appear under Russian pseudonyms because they are ashamed of their Jewish origins (Trotsky, Zinoviev, others). But it would be better to say that their Jewish names are pseudonyms; they are not rooted in our people.&quot;

In 1922 Dubnow emigrated to Kaunas, Lithuania, and later to Berlin. His magnum opus was the ten-volume &quot;World History of the Jewish people&quot;, first published in German translation in 1925–1929. Of its significance, historian Koppel Pinson writes: With this work Dubnow took over the mantle of Jewish national historian from Graetz. Dubnow&#x27;s &quot;Weltgeschichte&quot; may in truth be called the first secular and purely scholarly synthesis of the entire course of Jewish history, free from dogmatic and theological trappings, balanced in its evaluation of the various epochs and regional groupings of Jewish historical development, fully cognizant of social and economic currents and influences ...

During 1927 Dubnow initiated a search in Poland for &quot;pinkeysim&quot; (record books kept by Kehillot and other local Jewish groups) on behalf of the &quot;Yidisher Visnshaftlekher Institut&quot; (YIVO, Jewish Scientific Institute), while he was Chairman of its Historical Section. This spadework for the historian netted several hundred writings; one &quot;pinkes&quot; dated to 1601, that of the Kehillah of Opatów.

In August 1933, after Hitler came to power, Dubnow moved to Riga, Latvia. He chose Latvia in part for its government&#x27;s support for Jewish self-reliance and the vigorous Jewish community in the small country. There existed a Jewish theater, various Jewish newspapers, and a network of Yiddish-language schools. There his wife died, yet he continued his activities, writing his autobiography &quot;Book of My Life&quot;, and participating in YIVO, the Institute for Jewish Research. On the initiative of a Latvian Jewish refugee activist in Stockholm and with help from the local Jewish community in Sweden, Dubnow was granted a visa to Sweden in the summer of 1940 but for unknown reasons he never used it. Then in July 1941 Nazi troops occupied Riga. Dubnow was evicted, losing his entire library. With thousands of Jews, he was transferred to the Riga ghetto. According to the few remaining survivors, Dubnow repeated to ghetto inhabitants: &quot;Yidn, shraybt un farshraybt&quot; (, write and record&quot;). He was among thousands of Jews to be rounded up there for the Rumbula massacre. Too sick to travel to the forest, he was murdered in the city on 8 December 1941. Several friends then buried Simon Dubnow in the old cemetery of the Riga ghetto.

==Political ideals==
Dubnow was ambivalent toward Zionism, which he felt was an opiate for the spiritually feeble. Despite being sympathetic to the movement&#x27;s ideas, he believed its ultimate goal, the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine achieved with international support and substantial Jewish immigration, to be politically, socially, and economically impossible, calling it &quot;a beautiful messianic dream&quot;. In 1898, he projected that by the year 2000, there would only be about 500,000 Jews living in Palestine. Dubnow thought Zionism just another sort of messianism, and he thought the possibility of persuading the Jews of Europe to move to Palestine and establish a state fantastical. Beyond improbability, he worried that this impulse would drain energy away from the task of creating an autonomous Jewish center in the diaspora.

Much stronger than his skepticism towards Zionism, Dubnow rejected assimilation. He believed that the future survival of the Jews as a nation depended on their spiritual and cultural strength, where they resided dispersed in the diaspora. Dubnow wrote: &quot;Jewish history [inspires] the conviction that Jewry at all times, even in the period of political independence, was pre-eminently a spiritual nation,&quot; and he called the push for assimilation &quot;national suicide&quot;.

His formulated ideology became known as Jewish Autonomism, once widely popular in eastern Europe, being adopted in its various derivations by Jewish political parties such as the Bund and his Folkspartei. &quot;Autonomism&quot; involved a form of self-rule in the Jewish diaspora, which Dubnow called &quot;the Jewish world-nation&quot;. The Treaty of Versailles (1919) adopted a version of it in the minority provisions of treaties signed with new east European states. Yet in early 20th-century Europe, many political currents began to trend against polities that accommodated a multiethnic pluralism, as grim monolithic nationalism or ideology emerged as centralizing principles. After the Holocaust, and the founding of Israel, for a while discussion of Autonomism seemed absent from Jewish politics.

==Regional history==

Dubnow&#x27;s political thought perhaps can better be understood in light of historical Jewish communal life in Eastern Europe. It flourished during the early period of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth (1569–1795), when it surpassed the Ottoman Empire and western Europe as a center of Judaism. Dubnow here describes the &quot;autonomous&quot; social-economic and religious organization developed by the Jewish people under the Commonwealth government:

Constituting an historical nationality, with an inner life of its own, the Jews were segregated by the Government as a separate estate, an independent social body. ... They formed an entirely independent class of citizens, and as such were in need of independent agencies of self-government and jurisdiction. The Jewish community constituted not only a national and cultural, but also a civil, entity. It formed a Jewish city within a Christian city, with its separate forms of life, its own religious, administrative, judicial, and charitable institutions. The Government of a country with sharply divided estates could not but legalize the autonomy of the Jewish Kahal.&quot; The Jews also did not speak Polish, but rather Yiddish, an Hebraicized German. &quot;The sphere of the Kahal&#x27;s activity was very large.&quot; &quot;The capstone of this Kahal organization were the so-called &quot;Waads&quot;, the conferences or assemblies of rabbis and Kahal leaders. [They became] the highest court of appeal.&quot; Their activity &quot;passed, by gradual expansion, from the judicial sphere into that of administration and legislation.

Each provincial council or &quot;Waad&quot; (Hebrew &quot;vaad&quot;: committee) eventually joined with others to form a central governing body which began to meet regularly. Its name became &quot;ultimately fixed as the Council of the Four Lands (&quot;Waad Arba Aratzoth&quot;).&quot; These four lands were: &quot;Wielkopolska&quot; (Posen), &quot;Malopolska&quot; (Cracow and Lubin), &quot;Ruthenia&quot; (Lviv (Lemberg)), and &quot;Volhynia&quot; (Ostroh and Kremenets); the fifth land &quot;Lithuania&quot; (Brest and Grodno) withdrew to form its own high &quot;Waad&quot;. The &#x27;Council of the Four Lands&#x27; consisted of the six &quot;leading rabbis of Poland&quot; and a delegate from the principal &quot;Kahalem&quot; selected by their elders, in all about thirty members. &quot;As a rule, the Council assembled in Lublin in early spring, between Purim and Passover, and in Yaroslav (Galicia) at the end of summer, before high holidays.&quot;

The Council or &quot;Wadd Arba Aratzoth&quot; &quot;reminded one of the Sanhedrin, which in ancient days assembled... in the temple. They dispensed justice to all the Jews of the Polish realm, issued preventive measures and obligatory enactments (&quot;takkanoth&quot;), and imposed penalties as they saw fit. All difficult cases were brought before their court. To facilitate matters [the delegates appointed] &#x27;provincial judges&#x27; (&quot;dayyane medinoth&quot;) to settle disputes concerning property, while they themselves [in plenary session] examined criminal cases, matters pertaining to &quot;hazaka&quot; (priority of possession) and other difficult matters of law.&quot; &quot;The Council of the Four Lands was the guardian of Jewish civil interests in Poland. It sent its &quot;shtadlans&quot; to the residential city of Warsaw and other meeting-places of the Polish Diets for the purpose of securing from the king and his dignitaries the ratification of the ancient Jewish privileges. ... But the main energy of the &quot;Waad&quot; was directed toward the regulation of the inner life of the Jews. The statute of 1607, framed [by] the Rabbi of Lublin, is typical of this solicitude. [Its rules were] prescribed for the purpose of fostering piety and commercial integrity among the Jewish people.

This firmly-knit organization of communal self-government could not but foster among the Jews of Poland a spirit of discipline and obedience to the law. It had an educational effect on the Jewish populace, which was left by the Government to itself, and had no share in the common life of the country. It provided the stateless nation with a substitute for national and political self-expression, keeping public spirit and civic virtue alive in it, and upholding and unfolding its genuine culture.

Yet then the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth suffered grave problems of institutional imbalance. Eventually, the Commonwealth was removed from the map of Europe by successive partitions perpetrated by her three neighboring states, each an autocracy, the third and extinguishing partition coming in 1795. Following the Congress of Vienna (1815) the Russian Empire uneasily governed most of these Polish and Lithuanian lands, including the large Jewish populations long dwelling there. The Russian Empire first restricted Jewish residence to their pre-existing Pale of Settlement, and later began to further confine Jewish liberties and curtail their self-government. Not only were their rights attacked, but several of the Tzars allowed the imperial government to propagate and to instigate a series of murderous pogroms against the Jewish people of the realm.

In the cruel atmosphere of this ongoing political crisis in the region, Simon Dubnow wrote his celebrated histories and played an active rôle in Jewish affairs. He supported the broad movements for change in the Russian Empire; yet in the main he sought to restore and to continue the Jewish autonomy, described above at its zenith under the old Commonwealth, into the 20th century.

During his life various large and tragic events were to impact the region, which can be considered as the most horrific of places during the first half of the 20th century. Among these events, ranging from a few positive to news headlines to crimes against humanity, were: the pogroms, the co-opted 1905 Russian Revolution, the founding of the Folkspartei, the First World War, the February Revolution followed by the October Bolshevik, the Balfour Declaration, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Versailles Treaty, the Polish–Soviet War, the Weimar inflation, the U.S.A. Immigration Act of 1924, exile of Leon Trotsky by Joseph Stalin, the Soviet Gulag, the Great Depression, the Holodomor in Ukraine, the Nazi regime, the Nuremberg racial laws, Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, Kristallnacht, the 1939 White Paper, the Nazi–Soviet Pact, the Second World War, the Soviet-Nazi War, and the Shoah. The catastrophe of the genocide claimed the life of the aged historian.

==National values==
Spiritual values were highly esteemed by Dubnow, who viewed the Jewish people as leaders in their advancement. In his &quot;Weltgeschichte&quot; he discusses the ancient rivalry between Sadducee and Pharisee, as a contest between the ideal of a &quot;political nation&quot; versus a &quot;spiritual nation&quot;. He favored the latter, and mounted a critique of the warlike policies of Alexander Jannaeus (r. 103-76 BCE), a king of the Jewish Hasmonean dynasty (167-63 BCE), which was founded by the Maccabees:

This was not the kind of state dreamed of by their predecessors, the hasidim, when the independence of Judea was attained and when the star of the Hasmoneans first began to gleam. Had Judea battled against the Syrian yoke, sacrificed for a quarter of a century its material goods and the blood of its best sons, only in order to become, after attaining independence, a &#x27;despotism&#x27; or warrior state after the fashion of its pagan neighbors? The Pharisees believed that the Jewish nation was created for something better; that in its political life it was not to strive for the ideal of brute force but rather for the lofty ideal of inner social and spiritual progress.

Not only is there the issue of inner purpose and drive of the communal life of a nation, but also of the ethics of nationalism, relations between nations. Dubnow writes: &quot;There is absolutely no doubt that Jewish nationalism in its very essence has nothing in common with any tendency toward violence.&quot; Because of the diaspora experience, &quot;as a Jew, I utter the word &#x27;national&#x27; with pride and conviction, because I know my people... is not able to aspire anywhere to primacy and dominance. My nationalism can be only a pure form...&quot; The prophets &quot;called Israel a &#x27;light to the nations&#x27; [and taught] the spiritual mission of the people of Israel... to bring other peoples, that is, all &#x27;mankind,&#x27; to spiritual perfection.&quot; Thus, the nation inspired by Judaism, &quot;the descendants of the Prophets,&quot; will promote and inspire the social ethics of humanity, and will come to harmonize with its realization: &quot;the equal worth of all nations in the family of mankind.&quot; The &quot;Jewish national idea, which can never become aggressive and warlike&quot; will raise aloft its flag, which symbolizes the joining of the prophetic vision of &quot;truth and justice with the noble dream of the unity of mankind.&quot;

Scholar Baruch Kimmerling describes Dubnow as having &quot;fused nationalism, internationalism, and secular Jewishness into a non-Zionist, non–territorially dependent cultural nationalism.&quot;

==&quot;Jewish History&quot;==
Earlier in a long and well-regarded essay, Dubnow wrote about the &quot;two halves&quot; of Jewish history. The first &quot;seems to be but slightly different from the history of other nations.&quot; But if we &quot;pierce to its depths&quot; we find a &quot;spiritual people&quot;. &quot;The national development is based upon an all-pervasive religious tradition... embracing a luminous theory of life and an explicit code of morality and social converse.&quot; Their history reveals that the Jewish people &quot;has been called to guide the other nations toward sublime moral and religious principles, and to officiate for them, the laity as it were, in the capacity of priests.&quot; &quot;The Prophets were the real and appointed executors of the holy command enjoining the &#x27;conversion&#x27; of all Jews into &#x27;a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&#x27;.&quot; After the close of the Tanakh era in Israel, this first half of their history, the &quot;strength and fertility&quot; of the Jews as a spiritual nation &quot;reached a culminating point&quot;.

Yet then &quot;the providence of history&quot; changed everything and scattered them &quot;to all ends of the earth&quot;. &quot;State, territory, army, the external attributes of national power&quot; became a &quot;superfluous luxury&quot; for the Jews, a hardy and persevering people. Already in the Biblical times, their &quot;character had been sufficiently tempered&quot;, they had learned how to &quot;bear the bitterest of hardships&quot; and were &quot;equipped with an inexhaustible store of energy&quot;, thus they could survive, &quot;live for centuries, yea, for thousands of years&quot; under challenging conditions in ethnic enclaves mostly in Southwest Asia and later throughout Europe, during their post-Biblical &quot;second half&quot;.

&quot;Uprooted from its political soil, national life displayed itself [in the] intellectual fields exclusively. &#x27;To think and to suffer&#x27; became the watchword of the Jewish people.&quot; They brought their &quot;extraordinary mental energy&quot; to the task. &quot;The spiritual discipline of the school came to mean for the Jew what military discipline is for other nations.&quot; Dubnow notes that the Jewish people without an army live as if in a future world where nations no longer rise up against each other in war. Hence, for the Jews, their history has become &quot;spiritual strivings&quot; and cultural contributions. &quot;If the inner life and social and intellectual development of a people form the kernel of history, and politics and occasional wars are but its husk, then certainly the history of the Jewish Diaspora is all kernel.&quot;

&quot;In spite of the noteworthy features that raise Jewish history above the level of the ordinary and assign it a peculiar place, it is nevertheless not isolated, not severed from the history of mankind.&quot; These &quot;pilgrim people scattered in all the countries&quot; are &quot;most intimately interwoven with world-affairs&quot;. On the negative, when &quot;the powers of darkness and fanaticism held sway&quot; the Jews were subject to &quot;persecutions, infringement of the liberty of conscience, inquisitions, violence of every sort.&quot; Yet when &quot;enlightenment and humanity&quot; prevailed in the neighborhood, the Jews were to benefit by &quot;the intellectual and cultural stimulus proceeding from the peoples with whom they entered into close relations.&quot; Across the centuries in our history, such tides seem to ebb and flow.

On its side, Jewry made its personality felt among the nations by its independent, intellectual activity, its theory of life, its literature, by the very fact indeed, of its ideal staunchness and tenacity, its peculiar historical physiognomy. From this reciprocal relation issued a great cycle of historical events and spiritual currents, making the past of the Jewish people an organic constituent of the past of all that portion of mankind which has contributed to the treasury of human thought.

Dubnow states that the Jewish people in the first Biblical half of its history &quot;finally attained to so high a degree of spiritual perfection and fertility that the creation of a new religious theory of life, which eventually gained universal supremacy, neither exhausted its resources nor ended its activity.&quot; In its second &quot;lackland&quot; half the Jews were &quot;a people accepting misery and hardship with stoic calm, combining the characteristics of the thinker with those of the sufferer, and eking out existence under conditions which no other nation has found adequate.&quot; For this people &quot;the epithet &#x27;peculiar&#x27; has been conceded&quot; and Jewish history &quot;presents a phenomenon of undeniable uniqueness.&quot;

==Philosophy==
In a short article, Dubnow presented a memorable portrait of historical depth, and its presence in contemporary life:

Every generation in Israel carries within itself the remnants of worlds created and destroyed during the course of the previous history of the Jewish people. The generation, in turn, builds and destroys worlds in its form and image, but in the long run continues to weave the thread that binds all the links of the nation into the chain of generations. ... Thus each generation in Israel is more the product of history than it is its creator. ... We, the people of Israel living today, continue the long thread that stretches from the days of Hammurabi and Abraham to the modern period. ... We see further that during the course of thousands of years the nations of the world have borrowed from our spiritual storehouse and added to their own without depleting the source. ... The Jewish people goes its own way, attracting and repelling, beating out for itself a unique path among the routes of the nations of the world... .

Another writer of Jewish history although from a younger generation, Lucy Dawidowicz, summarizes the personal evolution and resulting weltanschauung of Simon Dubnow:

Early in his intellectual life, Dubnow turned to history and in the study and writing of Jewish history he found the surrogate for Judaism, the modern means by which he could identify as a Jew, which would give him inner satisfaction and keep him part of the Jewish community. ... Even in his pioneering studies of hasidism, Dubnow&#x27;s rationalism shines through. ... Yet despite his rationalism, despite his modernity, Dubnow believed in a mystic force--the Jewish will to live.

Dubnow himself adumbrates his own philosophical and religious understanding: &quot;I am agnostic in religion and in philosophy... I myself have lost faith in personal immortality, yet history teaches me that there is a collective immortality and that the Jewish people can be considered as relatively eternal for its history coincides with the full span of world history.&quot; Pinson writes &quot;Dubnow with his profound historical approach, weaves into his automomist theories all the strands of Jewish past, present and future.&quot;

==Dubnow Institute in Leipzig==

In honor of Simon Dubnow and as a center for undertaking research on Jewish culture, in 1995, the Leibniz Institute for Jewish History and Culture – Simon Dubnow was founded. It is an interdisciplinary institute for the research of Jewish lived experience in Central and Eastern Europe from the Early Modern Period to the present day. The Dubnow Institute is dedicated to the secular tradition of its namesake. At the Dubnow Institute, Jewish history is always regarded in the context of its non-Jewish environs and as a seismograph of general historical developments. The institute is contributing courses to several degree programs of Leipzig University and offers a Ph.D. research scheme.

<text>Intimacy is a 2001 erotic drama film directed by Patrice Chéreau from a screenplay he co-wrote with Anne-Louise Trividic, based on stories by Hanif Kureishi (who also wrote a novel of the same title). It stars Kerry Fox and Mark Rylance. The film is an international co-production between France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy, featuring a soundtrack of pop songs from the 1970s and 1980s. &quot;Intimacy&quot; contains an unsimulated fellatio scene by Fox on Rylance. A French-dubbed version features voice actors Jean-Hugues Anglade and Nathalie Richard.

The film has been associated with the New French Extremity.

==Plot==
Jay is a bartender who abandoned his family because his wife lost interest in him and their relationship. Now living alone in a decrepit house in London, he has intense weekly sex every Wednesday with a woman whose name he does not know. At first, their relationship is purely physical, but he develops an emotional attachment to her. 

Jay is frustrated at work when his boss employs a junior barman, Ian, without consulting him, but later takes Ian under his wing. 

Wanting to know more about the woman, Jay follows her across the streets of London to the grey suburbs where she lives. He then follows her to a pub theatre where she is working as an actress in the evenings. Jay learns that her name is Claire, and she has a husband, Andy, a black cab driver, and a son, Leo. Jay befriends Andy and Leo, but Claire remains unaware that they are in contact.

Jay&#x27;s deadbeat friend Victor arrives unexpectedly to stay with Jay. Jay reluctantly allows him to stay but then throws him out on Wednesday before Claire is due to arrive. However, Claire does not come. Sometime later, Jay and Ian go to a squat to rescue Victor, as he has apparently fallen into drug abuse. Victor accuses Jay of being heartless. With Victor&#x27;s encouragement, Jay has sex with a woman he meets there, but abruptly leaves in the morning. 

Jay confides in Andy about his failed marriage and that he is having an affair with a mystery woman who he sees every Wednesday. Andy introduces Jay to Claire after a play, and makes a point of mentioning Jay&#x27;s affair to her. Andy and Claire later argue. Andy claims he doesn&#x27;t care about the affair but that she is a bad actress who will never get anywhere, and that her persisting with it infuriates him. She tells him she&#x27;s not going to leave him. 

Andy visits Jay&#x27;s bar and obliquely makes it apparent that he knows about the affair. The next Wednesday, Claire arrives at Jay&#x27;s house while Ian and Victor are helping him to clear it. She makes it clear to Jay that she will not leave her family, and won&#x27;t see him anymore. They have sex one final time, then Claire leaves without looking back.

==Reception==
&quot;Intimacy&quot; was placed at 91 on &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;&#x27;s best films of the 2000s.

In a 2001 lengthy column for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alexander Linklater described the jealousy he experienced when his partner Kerry Fox took the real-sex role in this movie. Linklater concludes that he accepted the unsimulated oral scene, but he insists that the sexual intercourse is an illusion. Nevertheless, critics have declared its realist tendencies. Linda Williams, for instance, writes that &quot;&quot;Intimacy&quot; opens with urgent, hurried and explicit penetrative sex&quot; and Tanya Krzywinska writes that in this first scene &quot;the spectator is left in little doubt that penetration has occurred&quot;.

In a 2015 interview with &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Mark Rylance spoke of his experience on the film. At the time of the film&#x27;s release, talk of the film&#x27;s unsimulated sex scenes in tabloids added stress on his marriage. Rylance commented, &quot;It soured me on my life two months. It’s my mistake, but I felt Patrice [Chéreau] put undue pressure on me on set to do that. And at that point I didn’t have the confidence as a film actor to say no. Now I think a lot of actors that people say are difficult are actually just being sensible.”

==Awards==
&quot;Intimacy&quot; won the Golden Bear for Best Film and the Silver Bear for Best Actress (Kerry Fox) at the Berlin Film Festival in 2001.

<text>George Wesley Bellows (August 12 or August 19, 1882 – January 8, 1925) was an American realist painter, known for his bold depictions of urban life in New York City. He became, according to the Columbus Museum of Art, &quot;the most acclaimed American artist of his generation&quot;.

==Youth==
George Wesley Bellows was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio. He was the only child of George Bellows and Anna Wilhelmina Smith Bellows (he had a half-sister, Laura, 18 years his senior). He was born four years after his parents married, at the ages of fifty (George) and forty (Anna). His mother was the daughter of a whaling captain based in Sag Harbor, Long Island, and his family returned there for their summer vacations. He began drawing well before kindergarten, and his elementary–school teachers often asked him to decorate their classroom blackboards at Thanksgiving and Christmas.

At age 10, George took to athletics, and trained to be a baseball and basketball player. He became good enough at both sports to play semipro ball for years afterward. During his senior year, a baseball scout from the Indianapolis team made him an offer. He declined, opting to enroll at Ohio State University (1901–1904). There he played for the baseball and basketball teams, and provided illustrations for the &quot;Makio&quot;, the school&#x27;s student yearbook. He was encouraged to become a professional baseball player, and he worked as a commercial illustrator while a student and continued to accept magazine assignments throughout his life. Despite these opportunities in athletics and commercial art, Bellows desired success as a painter, although his parents didn&#x27;t encourage it. He left Ohio State in 1904, just before he was to graduate, and moved to New York City to study art.

Bellows was soon a student of Robert Henri, who at the time was teaching at the New York School of Art. While studying there, Bellows became associated with Henri&#x27;s &quot;The Eight&quot; and the Ashcan School, a group of artists who advocated painting contemporary American society in all its forms. By 1906, Bellows and fellow art student Edward Keefe had set up a studio at 1947 Broadway.

==New York==

Bellows first achieved widespread notice in 1908, when he and other pupils of Henri organized an exhibition of mostly urban studies. While many critics considered these to be crudely painted, others found them welcomely audacious, a step beyond the work of his teacher. Bellows taught at the Art Students League of New York in 1909, although he was more interested in pursuing a career as a painter. His fame grew as he contributed to other nationally recognized juried shows.

Bellows&#x27; urban New York scenes depicted the crudity and chaos of working-class people and neighborhoods, and satirized the upper classes. From 1907 through 1915, he executed a series of paintings depicting New York City under snowfall. In these paintings Bellows developed his strong sense of light and visual texture, exhibiting a stark contrast between the blue and white expanses of snow and the rough and grimy surfaces of city structures, and creating an aesthetically ironic image of the equally rough and grimy men struggling to clear away the nuisance of the pure snow. However, Bellows&#x27; series of paintings portraying amateur boxing matches were arguably his signature contribution to art history. They are characterized by dark atmospheres, through which the bright, roughly laid brushstrokes of the human figures vividly strike with a strong sense of motion and direction.

==Social and political themes==
Growing prestige as a painter brought changes in his life and work. Though he continued his earlier themes, Bellows also began to receive portrait commissions, as well as social invitations, from New York&#x27;s wealthy elite. Additionally, he followed Henri&#x27;s lead and began to summer in Maine, painting seascapes on Monhegan and Matinicus islands.

At the same time, the always socially conscious Bellows also associated with a group of radical artists and activists called &quot;the Lyrical Left&quot;, who tended towards anarchism in their extreme advocacy of individual rights. He taught at the first Modern School in New York City (as did his mentor, Henri), and served on the editorial board of the socialist journal &quot;The Masses&quot;, to which he contributed many drawings and prints beginning in 1911. However, he was often at odds with other contributors due to his belief that artistic freedom should trump any ideological editorial policy. Bellows also dissented from this circle in his very public support of U.S. intervention in World War I. In 1918, he created a series of lithographs and paintings that graphically depicted atrocities which the Allies said had been committed by Germany during its invasion of Belgium. Notable among these was &quot;The Germans Arrive&quot;, which gruesomely illustrated a German soldier restraining a Belgian teen whose hands had just been severed. However, his work was also highly critical of the domestic censorship and persecution of antiwar dissenters conducted by the U.S. government under the Espionage Act.

He was also criticized for some of the liberties he took in capturing scenes of war. The artist Joseph Pennell argued that because Bellows had not witnessed the events he painted firsthand, he had no right to paint them. Bellows responded that he had not been aware that Leonardo da Vinci &quot;had a ticket to paint the Last Supper&quot;.

==Later life==
As Bellows&#x27; later oils focused more on domestic life, with his wife and daughters as beloved subjects, the paintings also displayed an increasingly programmatic and theoretical approach to color and design, a marked departure from the fluid muscularity of the early work.

One of Bellows&#x27; central subjects was the sea, and he painted over 250 scenes of it during the course of his career. &quot;The Fisherman&quot; (1917), a significant late canvas focusing on the topic that he made while visiting Carmel, California, is in the collection of the Amon Carter Museum of American Art.

In addition to painting, Bellows made significant contributions to lithography, helping to expand the use of the medium as a fine art in the U.S. He installed a lithography press in his studio in 1916, and between 1921 and 1924 he collaborated with master printer Bolton Brown on more than a hundred images. The Amon Carter Museum of American Art holds one of the largest collections of Bellows&#x27; lithographs, a set of 220 prints acquired from the artist&#x27;s estate in 1985. There are also large collections of his lithographs at the Boston Public Library and the Cleveland Museum of Art.

Bellows also illustrated numerous books in his later career, including several by H.G. Wells.

Bellows taught at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1919. In 1920, he began to spend nearly half of each year in Woodstock, New York, where he built a home for his family. He died on January 8, 1925, in New York City, of peritonitis, after failing to tend to a ruptured appendix. He was survived by his wife, Emma Story Bellows (married 1910), and daughters Anne and Jean. Bellows is buried at Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn. &quot;Of American artists of the first rank,&quot; wrote Joyce Carol Oates, &quot;none had a more tragically foreshortened career than Bellows... [He was] the most famous American artist of his time.&quot;

Paintings and prints by George Bellows are in the collections of many major and regional American art museums, including the Art Museum of Southeast Texas in Beaumont, Texas, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., the Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester, and the Whitney and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, and The Hyde Collection, in Glens Falls, New York. The Columbus Museum of Art in Bellows&#x27; hometown also has a sizeable collection of both his portraits and New York street scenes. The White House acquired his 1919 painting &quot;Three Children&quot; in 2007, and it is now displayed in the Green Room.

The Whitney Museum published a biography of Bellows by fellow artist George William Eggers as part of the American Artists Series. In 1992 it mounted an extensive exhibition of his art (the exhibition was a joint venture with the Los Angeles County Museum of Art).

The Archives and Special Collections at Amherst College holds his papers.

==Posthumous sales and exhibitions==

His work was part of the painting event in the art competition at the 1932 Summer Olympics.

In December 1999, &quot;Polo Crowd&quot;, a 1910 painting, sold for U.S.$27.5 million to billionaire Bill Gates. In November 2008, Bellows&#x27; &quot;Men of the Docks&quot;, a 1912 painting of the Brooklyn docks spanning the East River and depicting the Manhattan skyline in the background, was to be auctioned at Christie&#x27;s in New York. It was expected to set the record for an American painting sold at auction with an estimate of $25–35 million. The painting&#x27;s sale however was a source of controversy at Randolph College because it was the first masterpiece purchased for the Maier Museum of Art by students and locals who raised $2,500 to purchase it in 1920. Due to a series of lawsuits and the deflated art market, the painting remained unsold until 2014 when it became the first major American painting to be purchased by the British National Gallery in London.

In 2001, Thomas French Fine Art became the exclusive agent of the George Bellows Family Trust.

Randolph College was asked by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., to lend &quot;Men of the Docks&quot;, for inclusion in a 2012 exhibition. A major Bellows retrospective was held at the Royal Academy in London in 2013. &quot;Men of the Docks&quot; is now in the National Gallery in London.
In November 2021, the Columbus Museum of Art opened the George Bellows Center to encourage exhibitions, publications and scholarly research on his life and work. Noted Bellows scholar Mark Cole of the Cleveland Museum of Art presented a lecture on Bellows&#x27; life with a specific focus on sports subjects in his work.

<doc id="919728" wikidata="Q6634155" url="?curid=919728" title="List of national stadiums">
<text>Many countries have a national [[sport]] [[stadium]], which typically serves as the primary or exclusive home for one or more of a country&#x27;s national representative sports teams. The term is most often used in reference to an association football stadium. Usually, a national stadium will be in or very near a country&#x27;s capital city or largest city. It is generally (but not always) the country&#x27;s largest and most lavish sports venue with a rich history of hosting a major moment in sports (e.g. FIFA World Cup, Olympics, etc.). In many, but not all cases, it is also used by a local team. Many countries, including Spain and the United States, do not have a national stadium designated as such; instead matches are rotated throughout the country. The lack of a national stadium can be seen as advantageous as designating a single stadium would limit the fan base capable of realistically attending matches as well as the concern of the cost of transportation, especially in the case of the United States due to its geographical size and high population.

A list of national stadiums follows:

However, during reconstruction for the 2014 FIFA World Cup and as the capital city&#x27;s and country&#x27;s greatest stadium, the name &quot;Estádio Nacional&quot; (Portuguese for National Stadium) was added to the old Mané Garrincha stadium, leaving its official name as Estádio Nacional de Brasília Mané Garrincha, even though it doesn&#x27;t act as a solo national stadium. The largest and most well known stadium in Brazil is Estádio do Maracanã located at Rio de Janeiro. The Brazil national football team have most of their high-profile matches in the Maracanã and the venue has hosted multiple World Cup and Copa America matches throughout its history including the two World Cup finals that Brazil has hosted (1950 and 2014).

<doc id="919748" wikidata="Q1283782" url="?curid=919748" title="Wasp waist">
<text>Wasp waist is a women&#x27;s fashion silhouette, produced by a style of corset and girdle, that has experienced various periods of popularity in the 19th and 20th centuries. Its primary feature is the abrupt transition from a natural-width rib cage to an exceedingly small waist, with the hips curving out below. It takes its name from its similarity to a wasp&#x27;s segmented body. The sharply cinched waistline also exaggerates the hips and bust.

==History==
In the 19th century, while average corseted waist measurements varied between , wasp waist measurements of were uncommon and were not considered attractive. Ladies&#x27; magazines told of the side effects of tight lacing, proclaiming that &quot;if a lady binds and girds herself in, until she be only twenty-three inches, and, in some cases, until she be only twenty-one inches, it must be done at the expense of comfort, health, and happiness.&quot; Fashions instead created the illusion of a small waist, using proportion, stripe placement, and color. Retouching photographs was sometimes used to create the illusion of a wasp waist.

Extreme tight lacing () was a fad during the late 1870s and 1880s, lasting until around 1887.

==Health effects==
Among the multitude of medical problems women suffered to achieve these drastic measurements were deformed ribs, weakened abdominal muscles, deformed and dislocated internal organs, and respiratory ailments. The displacement and disfigurement of the reproductive organs greatly increased the risk of miscarriage and maternal death.

<text>Liaoyang () is a prefecture-level city of east-central Liaoning province, China, situated on the Taizi River. It is approximately one hour south of Shenyang, the provincial capital, by car. Liaoyang is home to Liaoning University&#x27;s College of Foreign Studies and a number of vocational colleges. The city hosts a limited number of professional basketball and volleyball games in a modern sports facility. According to the latest statistics in 2020, the age distribution of the population in Liaoyang is as follows: 0–14 years old account for 9.83% of the population; 15–59 years old account for 62.26% of the population; 60 years old and above account for 27.91% of the population; 65 years old and above account for 19.46% of the population.

==History==
Liaoyang is one of the oldest continuously-inhabited cities in northeast China, dating back to before the Warring States period, and the site of the city has not changed ever since. Under the Yan state and the Qin and Han dynasties, Liaoyang (then known as Xiangping) was the capital of Liaodong Commandery and the political center of the Liaodong region. During the Three Kingdoms period, the city was the focus of Sima Yi&#x27;s devastating Liaodong campaign. From the 5th to 7th centuries, Liaoyang was on the northern edge of the Goguryeo kingdom. Remains of Yodong and Baegam, the old Goguryeo cities, can still be seen near the modern city. This was the site of a major battle between the Tang and Goguryeo in 645 AD.

Liaoyang rose to prominence during the Liao dynasty. Several buildings in the city date to this period. Among these is the White Pagoda (baita), which dates back to 1189 in the Liao Dynasty with additions during the Yuan dynasty. The Liaoyang White Pagoda sits in Baita Park within Baita district in the centre of the city. Next to the park is Guangyou Temple, one of the oldest and largest temple complexes in the north east of China covering some .

Under the Jurchen Jin dynasty, the city served as their empire&#x27;s eastern capital under the name Dongjing ().

In the 17th century, the Manchu people rose up against the Ming dynasty of China. Liaoyang was one of the first Ming cities to fall and Nurhaci, the new Emperor of the Later Jin dynasty, made his capital there naming the city Dongjing in 1621. He also moved the tombs of several family members to Liaoyang and they can still be seen in Dongjingling, just east of the city. As the Manchu expanded, they again moved the capital to Shenyang in 1625. After this Dongjing faded in importance. Today, remains of the city walls can still be seen and a small museum stands within the reconstructed south gate.

The year 1900 saw the Boxer Rebellion in China. Russian troops camped in Liaoyang city, burning the ancient Guangyou temple. On the August 24 September 1904, the Battle of Liaoyang took place. This was a major battle of the Russo-Japanese war.

Liaoyang was one of the major centres of the Manchurian revival, a Protestant Christian revival which took place in Mukden (Shenyang) and the surrounding countryside in 1908.

The city was the site of widespread labor protests in March 2002 that were sparked by the bankruptcy and subsequent liquidation of the Liaoyang Ferroalloy Factory, or Liaotie. The protesters were workers from at least seven different factories, including failing textile, chemical, piston, instruments, leather, and precision tool plants. Their grievances involved local government corruption and widespread worker layoffs coupled with arrearage in employee wages, pensions and unemployment benefits. The activists demanded compensation for what they were owed, an investigation into the bankruptcy of Liaotie, and the resignation of the chairman of the local legislature, Gong Shangwu. The protests were eventually dispersed after several days by the government after declaring a curfew under martial law. Two of the workers&#x27; representatives, Xiao Yunliang and Yao Fuxin, were given prison terms of four and seven years, respectively. The government also responded by paying most but not all of the money that the workers were owed, and by ordering an investigation into the charges of corruption at Liaotie which culminated in the arrest and thirteen-year prison sentence of its manager, Fan Yicheng, for smuggling and fraudulent dereliction of duty. The provincial governor who approved the Liaotie bankruptcy was also imprisoned for accepting bribes, but Gong Shangwu evaded punitive action.

==Administrative divisions==
Within Liaoyang prefecture there are one county, five districts and one city.

The largest park within the city is Baita park. There are several historical sites to be visited. The new Liaoyang Museum, open to the public since 2009, contains many antiques. Guangyou temple beside the Baita (White Pagoda) has become one of Liaoyang&#x27;s main tourism attraction in recent years. The first temple on the site dates back to 1145. The temple was destroyed by Russian troops during the 1900 Boxer Rebellion but was later rebuilt. It houses a giant statue of Buddha made from sandalwood. There are two small museums for famous Liaoyang residents: Cao Xueqin, author of the book &quot;Dreams of a Red Mansion&quot;, and Wang Erlie, a notable Qing dynasty official. There is also a small museum just outside the city on the site of Dongjing, the old capital city.

<text>Brighton Beach is a neighborhood in the southern portion of the New York City borough of Brooklyn, within the greater Coney Island area along the Atlantic Ocean coastline. Brighton Beach is bounded by Coney Island proper at Ocean Parkway to the west, Manhattan Beach at Corbin Place to the east, Sheepshead Bay at the Belt Parkway to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south along the beach and boardwalk.

It is known for its high population of Russian-speaking immigrants, and as a summer destination for New York City residents due to its beaches along the Atlantic Ocean and its proximity to the amusement parks in Coney Island.

Brighton Beach is part of Brooklyn Community District 13, and its primary ZIP Code is 11235. It is patrolled by the 60th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically, Brighton Beach is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 48th District.

== History ==

=== Early development ===
Brighton Beach is included in an area from Sheepshead Bay to Sea Gate that was purchased from the Native Americans in 1645 for a gun, a blanket and a kettle.

Brighton Beach was located on sandy terrain, and before development in the 1860s, had mostly farms. The area was part of the &quot;Middle Division&quot; of the town of Gravesend, which was the sole English settlement out of the original six towns in Kings County. By the mid-18th century, thirty-nine lots in the division had been distributed to the descendants of English colonists.

In 1868, William A. Engeman built a resort in the area. The resort was given the name &quot;Brighton Beach&quot; in 1878 by Henry C. Murphy and a group of businessmen, who chose the name as an allusion to the English resort city of Brighton. With the help of Gravesend&#x27;s surveyor William Stillwell, Engeman acquired all 39 lots for the relatively low cost of $20,000. This hotel, with rooms for up to 5,000 people nightly and meals for up to 20,000 people daily, was close to the then-rundown western Coney Island, so it was mostly the upper middle class that went to this hotel. The , double-decker Brighton Beach Bathing Pavilion was also built nearby and opened in 1878, with the capacity for 1,200 bathers. &quot;Hotel Brighton&quot;, also known as the &quot;Brighton Beach Hotel&quot;, was situated on the beach at what is now the foot of Coney Island Avenue. The Brooklyn, Flatbush, and Coney Island Railway, the predecessor to the New York City Subway&#x27;s present-day Brighton Line, opened on July 2, 1878, and provided access to the hotel.

Adjacent to the hotel, Engeman built the Brighton Beach Race Course for thoroughbred horse racing. In December 1887, an extremely high tide washed over the area, creating a new, temporary connection between Sheepshead Bay and the ocean. Wrote the &quot;Brooklyn Daily Eagle&quot;: &quot;Unless [Engeman] is very lucky the next races on the Brighton Beach track will be conducted by the white crested horses of Neptune.&quot;

After that extremely high tide, and a decade of beach erosion, the Brighton Beach Hotel, by then owned by the Railway, faced the possibility of being &quot;undermined and carried away.&quot; A plan termed &quot;highly ingenious and novel&quot; was initiated by the superintendent of the Railway, J.L. Morrow, and its secretary, E.L. Langford, to elevate and move the building as a whole, 495 feet further inland. This was accomplished by lifting the estimated 5000 ton, building, using 13 hydraulic jacks, after which 24 lines of railroad track – a mile and a half length in total – were laid under it, and 112 railroad &quot;platform cars&quot; (flat cars) pulled by six steam locomotives were used to pull the hotel away from the sea. This careful engineering (by B.C. Miller) made the move successful; it began on April 2, 1888, and continued for the next nine days, and was the largest building move of the 19th century.

Anton Seidl and the Metropolitan Opera brought their popular interpretations of Wagner to the Brighton Beach Music Hall, where John Philip Sousa was in residence, and the New Brighton Theater was a hotspot for vaudeville. Visitors for tea at Reisenweber&#x27;s Brighton Beach Casino would be served by Japanese waitresses in full costume. At an enormous private club, the Brighton Beach Baths, members could swim, access a private beach, and play handball, mah-jongg, and cards.

The village, along with the rest of Gravesend, was annexed into the 31st Ward of the City of Brooklyn in 1894.

=== Early 20th century ===
In 1905, Brighton Beach Park opened its own area of amusements, calling it Brighton Pike. Brighton Pike offered a boardwalk, games, live entertainment (including the Miller Brothers&#x27; wild-west show: &quot;101 Ranch&quot;), and a huge steel roller coaster. The park was shut down in 1919 after it burned down. The actual beach remained popular, though.

Brighton Beach was re-developed as a fairly dense residential community with the final rebuilding of the Brighton Beach railway to rapid transit standards, becoming the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation (BMT)&#x27;s Brighton Line, which opened as a subway line in August 1920 (the line is now served by the New York City Subway&#x27;s ). The subway line within the neighborhood is above ground on an elevated structure. The opening of the BMT Brighton Line had conflicting consequences: although it made Brighton Beach viable as a year-round community, it was now much more feasible for visitors to return home in the evening rather than spend the night. This led to the closure of the Brighton Beach Hotel in 1924.

The years just before and following the Great Depression brought with them a neighborhood consisting mostly of first- and second-generation Jewish-Americans and, later, Holocaust concentration camp survivors. Of the estimated 55,000 Holocaust survivors living in New York City as of 2011, most live in Brighton Beach. To meet the bursting cultural demands, the New Brighton Theater converted itself to the States&#x27; first Yiddish theater in 1919.

Today, Brighton Beach has many synagogues and Jewish institutions, including a Chabad center, a Mikvah and a Jewish day school called Mazel.

=== Late 20th century and Soviet immigration ===
After World War II, the quality of life in Brighton Beach decreased significantly as the poverty rate and the ratio of older residents to younger residents increased; this was primarily effectuated by the postwar codification of rent regulation in New York, which incentivized middle-aged residents and retirees (particularly the aforementioned first- and second-generation Jewish-American residents, many of whom had eschewed homeownership in favor of investing their savings in family businesses or postsecondary educations for their children) to retain their units in the prewar six-story semi-fireproof elevator apartment houses that lined Brightwater Court and other nearby thoroughfares for decades. During the 1970s fiscal crisis, the exodus of government workers and other middle class residents to suburban areas accelerated; accordingly, many of Brighton Beach&#x27;s freestanding houses and bungalows were subdivided into single room occupancy residences for the poor, the elderly and the mentally ill. Brighton Beach suffered from arson as much as it did from constant drug trades. During the summer, however, people from all around the city continued to flock to Brighton Beach&#x27;s beach next to the Atlantic Ocean.

In the mid-1970s, Brighton Beach became a popular place to settle for Soviet immigrants, mostly Ashkenazi Jews from Russia and Ukraine. So many Soviet Jews immigrated to Brighton Beach that the area became known as &quot;Little Odessa&quot; (after the Ukrainian city on the Black Sea with a significant Jewish population in the first half of 20th century).

The 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union and the subsequent significant changes in the social and economic circumstances of post-Soviet states led thousands of former Soviet citizens to immigrate to the United States. Many more immigrants from the former Soviet Union, who primarily spoke Russian, chose Brighton Beach as a place to settle. This included an influx of immigrants from the Caucasus, mostly from countries such as Georgia and Azerbaijan.

A large number of Russian immigrant firms, shops, restaurants, clubs, offices, banks, schools, and children&#x27;s play centers opened in the area. The value of real estate in Brighton Beach started to rise again, even though drugs remained a social issue in the area through the early 1990s.

In the early 2000s, a high-income ocean-front condominium complex, the &quot;Oceana&quot;, was constructed. This address has become the destination of wealthy businessmen, entertainers, and senior officials from the former Soviet Union, and with their purchase of units at the Oceana, area housing prices have risen.

Since the early 2010s, a significant number of Central Asian immigrants have also chosen Brighton Beach as a place to settle.

== Culture ==
Brighton Beach Avenue runs parallel to the Coney Island beach and boardwalk. The proximity of Brighton Beach to the city&#x27;s beaches and the fact that the neighborhood is directly served by a subway station make it a popular summer weekend destination for New York City residents.

=== Russian-speaking culture ===

As apartment buildings started to be built in large numbers in the 1930s, many of those who moved into the neighborhood were Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe, often by way of the Lower East Side. They came from many countries, but also set the stage for a later wave of Jewish immigration from the Soviet Union that started in the 1970s, when Brighton Beach became known as &quot;Little Odessa,&quot; and &quot;Little Russia&quot;. An annual festival, the Brighton Jubilee, celebrates the area&#x27;s Russian-speaking heritage, being populated heavily by Russian and Ukrainian Americans. The area has also been called &quot;the land of pelmeni, matryoshkas, tracksuits, and...vodka&quot; due to its large population of Soviet immigrants.

In 2006, Alec Brook-Krasny was elected for the 46th District of the New York State Assembly, which includes Brighton Beach, becoming the country&#x27;s first elected Soviet-born politician.

=== Demographics ===

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Brighton Beach was 35,547, an increase of 303 (0.9%) from the 35,244 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 69.7% (24,774) White, 1.0% (352) African American, 0.2% (61) Native American, 12.9% (4,580) Asian, 0.0% (10) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (139) from other races, and 1.2% (442) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 14.6% (5,189) of the population.

, Brighton Beach had a middle-class, mostly Jewish, older population. 27% of Brighton Beach was of age 62 or older, while the national average of persons aged 62 or older was 13.9%. Since the 1990s, however, the neighborhood&#x27;s ethnic demographics have been changing, with a large influx of mainly Muslim immigrants from Central Asia, such as Uzbeks. In subsequent years, the proportion of whites leveled out, the proportion of the black population decreased significantly, and the proportion of the Asian population increased to 14% as of 2014. , increasing numbers of Muslim Central Asians were moving into Brighton Beach, and based on the historic Soviet influence over these areas, these immigrants also speak Russian.

According to the United States Census report of 2010, Brighton Beach and Coney Island, combined, had 111,063 residents as of 2009. In that year, the median age of the combined Brighton Beach and Coney Island area was 47.9 years, substantially higher than the median age in Brooklyn of 34.2 and in New York City as a whole at 36.0. As DiNapoli and Bleiwas note in a city report, &quot;the number of residents aged 65 years and older in [this area] rose by 4.1 percent, so that senior citizens accounted for more than one-quarter of the area&#x27;s population&quot; at that date. According to the census, the population density in Brighton Beach, per se (52,109 people per square mile), was almost twice the average population density of New York City (27,012 people per square mile), though the average household size was 2.1 people, lower than the city average of 2.6 people. The average income of households in the area was $36,574, while the average income in the whole city was $55,217, according to the 2010 census. In Brighton Beach, 21% of the population lives below the poverty line, compared to only 15.4% citywide.

Most of the population of Brighton Beach are immigrants. Less than a quarter (23.3%) of Brighton Beach residents were born in the United States, and nearly three-quarters were born abroad (72.9%). Because of this, English language proficiency in Brighton Beach is lower than the city average. More than a third (36.1%) of the population of Brighton Beach does not speak or understand English, while citywide, only one in fourteen people (7.2%) cannot speak or understand English.

New York City Department of City Planning showed that in the 2020 census data that there were between 20,000 and 29,000 White residents and between 5,000 and 9,999 Asian residents, meanwhile each the Hispanic and Black populations were each less than 5000 residents.

=== Theater ===
The Brighton Ballet Theater, established in 1987, is one of the most famous Russian ballet schools in the United States. More than 3,000 children have trained in ballet, modern and character dances, and folk dances here.

A Russian-speaking theater near the waterfront, , formerly the Millennium Theater and the Oceana Theatre, features performances by actors from the U.S., Russia, and other countries.

== Police and crime ==
Brighton Beach is patrolled by the NYPD&#x27;s 60th Precinct, located at 2950 West Eighth Street. The 60th Precinct ranked 34th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010. Between 1993 and 2010, major crimes decreased by 72%, including a 76% decrease in robberies, 71% decrease in felony assaults, and 67% decrease in shootings. The 60th Precinct has a substantially lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 77.5% between 1990 and 2022. The precinct reported five murders, 16 rapes, 179 robberies, 373 felony assaults, 159 burglaries, 527 grand larcenies, and 121 grand larcenies auto in 2022.

Brighton Beach is considered a hot spot for the Russian Bratva, though public perception has been that organized crime &quot;has largely gone away.&quot; In the 1970s, the most notorious leg of the mafia was the Potato Bag Gang, which served as a robbery gang for larger Russian crime syndicates in New York City. Marat Balagula was a crime boss from Brighton Beach who denies having any connection to the American Mafia or the Russian-speaking Mafia. The major Russian criminal element in Brighton Beach was the international Russian mafia group, known as vor v zakone or &quot;vory,&quot; and the first vory crime boss in Brighton Beach was Evsei Agron, who controlled the area&#x27;s crime during the 1970s and 1980s until his death in 1985. After the fall of the Soviet Union in the 1990s, many ethnic Russian criminals illegally entered the United States, coming especially to Brighton Beach. The infamous vor Vyacheslav Ivankov, who dominated the Brighton Beach underworld until his arrest in 1995, arrived during this wave.

<text>Jacob Wetzel (born December 26, 1976) is a Canadian rower. He has represented both Canada and the United States at the World Championships and the Olympics. He was born in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada.

== College years ==
As a teenager, Wetzel was on the Canadian Junior Cycling team; he only began rowing in the fall of 1997 at the University of California, Berkeley. His success was immediate and extraordinary. His collegiate boat was undefeated and won the freshman 8 event at the 1998 Intercollegiate Rowing Association Championship (IRA). That summer Wetzel tried out for and made the Canadian National team in the pair event (2-) and finished seventh at the World Championships in Cologne, Germany.

In 1999, 2001, and 2002 he again competed for Berkeley where he was coached by Steve Gladstone, this time in the varsity 8. All three years his boats won the IRA and were de facto national champions. In 1999 and 2001, his boats were undefeated. In 2002, his boat suffered a single loss to the University of Washington, but beat Washington on several other occasions including the IRA.

== International competitions ==
Internationally, Wetzel competed for the United States team in 1999 (Coxed Four (4+) gold medal at the World Championships in St. Catharines) and in 2000 (7th place with the Quad (4x) at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney). In 1999, Wetzel was one of the principal subjects in the &quot;Outside Magazine&quot; article &quot;Blood in the Water&quot; on the difficulties and internal competition involved in trying to make a national team boat.

After a two-year pause because of a shoulder injury caused by a mountaineering accident, in 2003 Wetzel returned to the international rowing scene and he joined Team Canada. Wetzel made the coxless four (4-) and he won a gold medal at the 2003 world championships in Milan, Italy. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, Wetzel&#x27;s boat finished second by inches to Great Britain.

In 2005/2006 Wetzel completed an MSc in Financial Economics at the University of Oxford (Linacre College/Saïd Business School). He was a member of the victorious Oxford crew in the 2006 Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race.

He also won at the 2007 World Championships in Canada&#x27;s M8+.

He won the gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics in the men&#x27;s eights with Andrew Byrnes, Kyle Hamilton, Malcolm Howard, Adam Kreek, Kevin Light, Ben Rutledge, Dominic Sieterle and cox Brian Price.

Wetzel announced his retirement from international rowing at the Beijing Olympics; Wetzel enrolled in the PhD programme in Finance at the University of British Columbia in autumn 2008.

Wetzel was selected as the most highly decorated rower from the Pac-12 conference when he was selected as its Rower of the Century in 2016. In 2017, he became the first University of California, Berkeley rower alum to be inducted into the Cal Sports Hall of Fame as an individual.

<doc id="919779" wikidata="Q2007217" url="?curid=919779" title="Three Sisters (Australia)">
<text>The Three Sisters are an unusual rock formation in the Blue Mountains of New South Wales, Australia, on the north escarpment of the Jamison Valley. They are located close to the town of Katoomba and are one of the Blue Mountains&#x27; best known sites, towering above the Jamison Valley. Their names are Meehni (922 m), Wimlah (918 m), and Gunnedoo (906 m).

The formation receives more than 600,000 visitors per year.

==Formation==
The Three Sisters were formed by land erosion around 200 million years ago during the Triassic period when the sandstone bog the Blue Mountains was eroded over with the time by wind, rain and rivers, causing the cliffs surrounding the Valley to be slowly broken up. 

When the Blue Mountains were covered in seawater, the ocean carried large amounts of sediment that gradually sunk to the floor in crosswise layers. These layers later created rock beds and shales. Around 200 million years ago, volcanoes erupted through the coal, sandstone and shale layers, forming the ridges and the shape of the Three Sisters.

==Aboriginal legend==

The commonly told legend of the Three Sisters is that three sisters, Wimalah, Meeni, and Gunedoo, lived in the Jamison Valley as members of the Katoomba tribe. They fell in love with three men from the neighbouring Nepean tribe, but marriage was forbidden by tribal law. The brothers were not happy to accept this law and so decided to capture the three sisters. A major tribal battle ensued, and the sisters were turned to stone by an elder to protect them, but he was killed in the fighting and no one else could turn them back. 

This legend is commonly claimed to be an Indigenous Australian Dreamtime legend. However, the legend as is commonly told may be traced back to non-indigenous 16-year-old schoolgirl Patricia Stone, who gave the formations their &quot;indigenous&quot; names.

The Aboriginal traditional owners, the Gundungurra, have a different legend that includes the Sisters rock formation is a relief to the system.

The Three Sisters were declared an Aboriginal Place in January 2014, making it the 98th place in New South Wales to be declared as such.

==Giant Stairway==
From nearby Echo Point, a bushwalking trail leads to the Three Sisters and down to the valley floor via 998 steps to the upper lookout called &quot;the Giant Stairway&quot;. Then a 1.5-hour walk on The Federal Pass trail leads to the base of Katoomba Falls and the Katoomba Scenic Railway. Walkers who do not wish to climb back to the top can take the Scenic Railway back to the plateau for a fee.

<text>Nicolas Macrozonaris (, born August 22, 1980) is a Canadian Olympic track and field athlete who has won the 100 metre national title four times and once in the 200 metre.

== Career ==
He was inspired to run track and field after watching Donovan Bailey win the 100 metres at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta. After watching that race, it motivated him to take the sport seriously. A few years later, as a junior, he tied Ben Johnson&#x27;s Canadian national record in the 50 metre sprint, running a time of 5.83. The following year, after 4 years of intensive training, he qualified for the 2000 Sydney Olympics&#x27; 100 meter event at the age of 19. At the Olympics, he ran a time of 10.45 to finish 42nd overall out of 95, being eliminated in the heats.

His culminating moment as a sprinter came in 2003 when he ran a time of 10.03 and beat the then world record holder, American Tim Montgomery in Mexico City. As of 2019, his time of 10.03 is still ranked the sixth fastest Canadian 100m time, behind Bruny Surin and Donovan Bailey who both share the national record with a 9.84 clocking, along with Andre De Grasse (9.90), Aaron Brown (9.96) and Gavin Smellie (10.01).

In 2004, he qualified for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens and finished 28th out of 80 in the 100 meter event, thus improving his position from his previous Olympic Games in Sydney where he finished 42nd.

Nicolas has represented Canada in many international competitions and has qualified for six World Championships, three Francophone Games, two Olympic Games, two Commonwealth games, one World Cup, and one Pan American Championship.

In 2017, he ran for the Action Laval party in the 2017 Laval municipal election, but finished third in the Sainte-Dorothée District.

In 2024, Nicolas was hired as the sprints coach for the Concordia University Stingers Track &amp; Field Team.

<text>The , or Katsura Detached Palace, is an Imperial residence with associated gardens and outbuildings in the western suburbs of Kyoto, Japan. Located on the western bank of the Katsura River in Katsura, Nishikyō-ku, the Villa is 8km distant from the main Kyoto Imperial Palace. The villa and gardens are nationally recognized as an Important Cultural Property of Japan. 

The grounds of the villa are regarded as a notable exemplar of traditional Japanese gardening. Tea ceremony houses within the strolling gardens and the main villa itself are all sited to maximize appreciation of varied foliage and changing seasonal vistas. 

The palace originally belonged to the prince of the &quot;Hachijō-no-miya&quot; (八条宮) family. The Imperial Household Agency currently administers the site. Although the Imperial Villa itself is not open to visitors, public tours of the gardens are available by appointment.

==History==

The Katsura district of Kyoto has long been favored for villas, and in the Heian period, Fujiwara no Michinaga had a villa there. The members of the Heian court found it an elegant location for viewing the Moon.

Prince Hachijō Toshihito (智仁; 1579–1629), the founder of the Katsura Imperial Villa, was born on 13 February 1579. He was the sixth son of Prince Sanehito, and a descendant of Emperor Ogimachi. In 1586, Toshihito was adopted by Hideyoshi Toyotomi, but they separated in 1589 when Hideyoshi had his own son. He presented Toshihito with land that yielded 3000 koku (15,000 bushels of rice) and allowed him to establish a new house in the imperial line, which became the Hachijo family line.

From an early age, Prince Toshihito was very familiar with the Tales of Genji, the Poems of Past and Present, and the works of Po Chu-i. He was incredibly fond of these works, and was said to copy passages from the works for leisure. One such passage, from the Tales of Genji, had written:

When Toshihito obtained land along the south bank of the Katsura River, the location of the novel the Tales of Genji, he set out to construct a villa modeled on passages from it. However, because he lacked wealth and resources, the first constructed villa was similar to &quot;a teahouse in the melon patch&quot;. However, after the marriage of Tokugawa Kazuko to Emperor Go-Mizunoo, which Toshihito had been active in creating, construction of the villa began. As Prince Toshihito became a greater figure in public life, more guests came to visit the Katsura Imperial Villa. By 1624, he had devoted more of his resources to the expansion of the villa, and it was recorded that hills had been formed and a pond had been dug in the middle of the garden. A priest that visited Katsura in 1624 wrote that it had the &quot;finest view in Japan&quot;. By 1631, the villa was called a &quot;palace&quot;.

Prince Toshihito died in 1629, when his son Toshitada (also called Noritada) was ten years old. Because he was only a child, Toshitada made little use of the garden, and the villa was allowed to deteriorate badly. However, he shared the same interests as his father, and visited the villa by 1641. After marrying the daughter of Lord Kaga, which greatly increased his income, he set out to renovate the imperial villa. With the section of the villa his father built known as the &quot;Old Shoin&quot;, Toshitada constructed the main house, as well as several teahouses, and these became part of the section called the &quot;Middle Shoin&quot;. After these renovations, the fame of the Katsura villa grew.

In 1654, Toshitada adopted Prince Sachi, one of the ex-Emperor Go-Mizunoo’s many sons, and a few years afterwards, Go-Mizunoo decided to visit. It is said that the New Palace, also called the &quot;Imperial-Visit Palace&quot;, was built to accommodate the ex-Emperor while he was visiting. Prince Toshitada died in 1662, and his heir died a few years later. After this, the fourth and fifth generation princes died in their teens, making additions to the Katsura Imperial Villa impossible. However, the seventh generation prince, Prince Yakahito, visited the villa numerous times and made repairs to it, leaving most of the layout in its original form.

The Hachijō-no-miya house changed its name to Tokiwai-no-miya (常磐井宮), Kyōgoku-no-miya (京極宮), and finally Katsura-no-miya (桂宮), before the line died out in 1881. The Imperial Household Ministry took control of the Katsura Detached Palace in 1883, and since World War II, the Imperial Household Agency has been in control.

== Connections to traditional Japanese and Buddhist ideas ==

The Katsura Imperial Villa is a good example of the essence of Japanese traditional design. The Villa combines principles usually used in early Shinto shrines and merges it with the esthetics and philosophy of Zen Buddhism.
Villa incorporates many traditional Japanese ideas. One example of Katsura&#x27;s use of traditional ideas is its use of raised floors with tatami mats covering them. Tatami are mats approximately 3 feet by 6 feet in length that are not only used as the floors of the villa, but are also used to define the dimensions of each individual room and the house as a whole. At Katsura, the mats are used to create the sprawling and pinwheel-like plan that it has today. The terraces and porches created by the arrangement of the tatami mats provide opportunities to view the landscape and link interior spaces with the outside world. The floors of each building of the site are also raised as well, which originally was derived from vernacular designs for granaries, as well as early imperial palaces. They serve the purpose of both keeping the floor dry while also giving hierarchy to the space. Another classic characteristic that the Katsura Imperial Villa utilizes is the use of screen walls (the shōji and the fusuma). In traditional Japanese Architecture, the shoji and the fusuma are used to separate the spaces created by the tatami mat into the various rooms of the house. The shoji is the generic term for the white and translucent screen door or wall that is reinforced with wooden lattice and can either be stationary, hanging, or sliding. The fusuma is a subcategory of the shoji and it is the white or painted moving screen partition used on the interior of the house. By moving the fusuma, when in conjunction with a stationary shoji, the resident is able to create new rooms within the architecture. For instance by moving one fusuma wall, one could transform two rooms into one large room and a small storage closet. In the Katsura Imperial Villa, the fusuma allows the rooms to change and open up to the natural world with exterior decks becoming extensions of the interior and framing views of the landscape. An example of this type of transformation is the moon viewing platform connected to the Old Shoin. Besides these characteristics, there are many traditional Japanese ideas that are used in the Katsura Imperial Villa, like the decorative alcove (tokonoma), built-in desk (tsukeshoin) and square posts.
At the Katsura Imperial Villa, the teahouses are perfect examples of how Zen Buddhism has affected the architecture and landscape. The tea ceremony, performed at the pavilions, is a very important part of Japanese society because it is a spiritual ritual symbolizing detached perfection in the Zen tradition, and it has greatly affected the architecture and landscape around it to enhance the experience one receives while in the ceremony. The teahouses were constructed expressly to incorporate the qualities of concord, reverence, pureness, and isolation that are the very essence of the ritual. The four different teahouses are all separated from the main building and are isolated from everything except for the nature around them; to reach each building, one must take a path that doesn’t reveal the view of the pavilion until the very last moment. The teahouses also use rustic elements such as bark covered wooden supports or irregular shaped wooden pieces as extensions of the natural world, for the tea ceremony aims at fusing the spiritual and the natural. Additionally, the teahouses account for many experiences while you are inside of it. The windows and apertures in the pavilion are at eye level when sitting so that one can feel more in tune and closer to nature and so that one can &quot;admire the cherry blossoms in the spring and the crimson leaves in the autumn… while preparing tea and enjoying exquisite cuisine&quot;. Finally, the interior of the buildings were planned so that the designers imparted their reverence for the materials and spatial harmony, which are intended to promote reflection that will achieve inward simplicity and tranquillity of the mind.

== Buildings and gardens ==

The Old &quot;Shoin&quot;, Middle &quot;Shoin&quot; and New Palace are each in the &quot;shoin&quot; style, with irimoya &quot;kokerabuki&quot; (柿葺) roofs.

The Old Shoin was constructed by Prince Toshihito. It is composed of rooms with nine, ten, and fifteen tatami, and has ceilings supported by wooden slats. On the southern side, there is a room with a veranda attached, which shows elements of the &quot;sukiya&quot; style. A bamboo platform, created for moon-viewing, extends beyond the veranda. The Old Shoin was most likely built to accommodate a large number of people at informal gatherings.

Compared to the Old Shoin, The Middle Shoin appears stiff. It is arranged in an L-shape, and at one end there is a tokonoma, and to its right there is a chigaidana (a staggered group of ornamental shelves). The walls of the tokonoma and chigaidana are decorated with ink paintings of landscapes, as well as the Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove. The Middle Shoin is said to have been built as the prince&#x27;s living quarters, which is evidenced by a bath and toilet. A veranda ran along two sides of the Middle Shoin and faced the garden.

The New Palace features a large hipped-and-gabled roof, as well as a veranda enclosed by wooden shutters. The design of the New Palace is more structured than the Old and Middle Shoin, and is composed of an eight-mat room, a six-mat room, and a three-mat area that are arranged into an L-shape. There is a coffered ceiling, and an alcove containing a large window. The Katsura Shelves are especially noteworthy, and are located in the corner opposite of the entrance. Other rooms in the New Palace are the imperial bedchamber, the consort’s dressing room, a pantry, a wardrobe, a bath, a toilet, and a washroom.

Within the garden, there were originally five teahouses. Although currently there are only four standing, the pavilions were implemented for practicing the Japanese art of the tea ceremony. The small structures were built to incorporate qualities that are at the essence of the tea ritual, such as harmony, silence, and reverence. Additionally, the tea rituals tried to incorporate the spiritual and natural world, therefore, the teahouses used natural elements such as wooden supports with bark, continuing the atmosphere of the garden.

The Geppa-rō, also known as the &quot;Moon-wave Tower,&quot; has a view overlooking the pond. Although it is only fifteen by twenty-four feet in area, it is known for its spatial effect due to its exposed ceiling and roof structure. The roof is supported by four slanting beams that rise from the corners of the building with a ridge pole that is further supported by a curving king pole resting on a tie beam. This creates a unique spatial effect as the roof has a decorated underside that exposes the beams and rafters.
Across the pond from the Geppa-rō is the Shōkin-tei, also known as the &quot;Pine-Lute Pavilion.&quot; The pavilions contrast one another, as the Geppa-rō is active and situated on higher ground looking down onto the pond whereas the Shōkin-tei is less active and elevated not far above the water level. The site in which the Shōkin-tei is located was initially the first point in which the visitors could view the pond. But through the development of the land, such as extending the pond to the southwest and reconstruction of the main house, the entire site developed into a tour garden rather than a view garden. It intends for one to walk through the space rather than just view it from the interior of a house. The most prominent and unusual aspect of the teahouse is the unfloored loggia. It is facing the pond with an open pantry in the center for tea ceremonies. This was very unusual to have in view of the tea drinkers and not in the back of the house. Additionally, three oak logs in their natural states support the extended eaves of the loggia. With the thatched roof, the roughness of the pavilion resembles a rustic kiosk. A prominent feature in the interior is the heavy papering with a blue-and-white checkered pattern on walls of the tokonoma and sliding doors between the First and Second rooms.

Leaving the Shōkin-tei, one follows up a &quot;mountain path&quot; to the Shōka-tei, which roughly means &quot;Flower-Appreciation Pavilion,&quot; as cherry trees surround it. It is a small teahouse that is situated at the highest point in the garden. It has the clearest view of the main house through the trees. The posts are barked logs, as the floor plan is made of only four tatami mats in a U-shaped pattern. Emphasizing the atmosphere of a mountain house, strips of dark blue and white cloth are hung on the front of the pavilion. 
As the path away from the Shōka-tei splits, the right leads to the front lawn of the main house, while the left leads to the Onrin-dō, a small ancestral shrine. Following this shrine, there is an open area leading to the Shōiken. It is also referred to as the &quot;Laughing Thoughts Pavilion.&quot; The upper wall of the entry room has uncharacteristic row of six round windows, giving the approaching visitor a feeling that the building is laughing at them. This particular pavilion is different from the others not in appearance but in the arrangement of rooms. From a processing of a narrow toilet to wider rooms to the kitchen and servant quarters, the pavilion appears to operate as an independent house. A small room with a shoin window overlooks the farmlands outside the grounds, connecting the viewer psychologically with the real world rather than the garden.

== Influence outside Japan ==
The buildings, and to a much lesser extent the gardens of Katsura, became a reference point for a number of well known modernist architects in the 20th century through a book published in 1934 by German architect Bruno Taut. Taut arrived in Japan at Tsuruga port on 3 May 1934. On only his second day in the country he was taken to visit the Katsura villa by members of Japan’s International Architectural Society. To the delight of his hosts Taut promptly declared the villa an unparalleled Japanese modernist archetype. In his subsequent publication of ‘Nippon’ and later ‘Personal views on Japanese Culture’ Taut did much to spread the view of the Katsura villa as a symbol of a uniquely Japanese approach to architecture. 

Le Corbusier and later Walter Gropius, who visited in 1953, also found inspiration in the minimal and orthogonal design of the buildings at Katsura. Subsequently, Katsura become well known to a second wave of architects from Australia such as Philip Cox, Peter Muller and Neville Gruzman who visited in the late 1950s and 1960s.

The Katsura villa was also cited as lasting influence of Irish architect Ronnie Tallon who described his many visits to the villa as &quot;like going to Lourdes for a cure&quot;. Tallon’s architectural homage to the influence of the Katsura buildings; the PJ Carroll Tobacco cigarette factory in Dundalk.

The home of Larry Ellison in Woodside, California is a replica of the entire Katsura villa, covering twenty-three acres.

<text>A category of fine art, graphic art covers a broad range of visual artistic expression, typically two-dimensional graphics, i.e. produced on a flat surface, today normally paper or a screen on various electronic devices. The term usually refers to the arts that rely more on line, color or tone, especially drawing and the various forms of engraving; it is sometimes understood to refer specifically to drawing and the various printmaking processes, such as line engraving, aquatint, drypoint, etching, mezzotint, monotype, lithography, and screen printing (silk-screen, serigraphy). Graphic art mostly includes calligraphy, photography, painting, typography, computer graphics, and bindery. It also encompasses drawn plans and layouts for interior and architectural designs.

In museum parlance &quot;works on paper&quot; is a common term, covering the various types of traditional fine art graphic art. There is now a large sector of graphic designers working mostly on web design.

==History==
Throughout history, technological inventions have shaped the development of graphic art. In 2500 BC, the Egyptians used graphic symbols to communicate their thoughts in a written form known as hieroglyphics. The Egyptians wrote and illustrated narratives on rolls of papyrus to share the stories and art with others.

During the Middle Ages, scribes manually copied each individual page of manuscripts to maintain their sacred teachings. The scribes would leave marked sections of the page available for artists to insert drawings and decorations. Using art alongside the carefully lettered text enhanced the religious reading experience.

In 1450, Johannes Gutenberg created the first upgraded moving type of mechanical equipment called as the printing press. His printing press aided the mass creation of text and visual art, eventually obviating the need for hand transcriptions.

Again during the Renaissance years, graphic art in the form of printing played a major role in the spread of classical learning in Europe. Within these manuscripts, book designers focused heavily on the typeface.

Due to the development of larger fonts during the Industrial Revolution, posters became a popular form of graphic art used to communicate the latest information as well as to advertise the latest products and services.

The invention and popularity of film and television changed graphic art through the additional aspect of motion as advertising agencies attempted to use kinetics to their advantage.

The next major change in graphic arts came when the personal computer was invented in the twentieth century. Powerful computer software enables artists to manipulate images in a much faster and simpler way than the skills of board artists prior to the 1990s. With quick calculations, computers easily recolor, scale, rotate, and rearrange images if the programs are known.

The design of street signs has been impacted by scientific examinations into readability. New York City is in the midst of replacing all of its street signs that have all capital characters with ones that only have upper and lower case letters. They anticipate that greater readability will improve wayfinding and greatly reduce collisions and injuries.

<text>Snowball is a small string processing programming language designed for creating stemming algorithms for use in information retrieval.

The name Snowball was chosen as a tribute to the SNOBOL programming language, with which it shares the concept of string patterns delivering signals that are used to control the flow of the program. The creator of Snowball, Dr. Martin Porter, &quot;toyed with the idea of calling it &#x27;strippergram&#x27;&quot;, because it &quot;effectively provides a &#x27;suffix STRIPPER GRAMmar&#x27;&quot;.

The Snowball compiler translates a Snowball script (a .sbl file) into program in thread-safe ANSI C, Java, Ada, C#, Go, Javascript, Object Pascal, Python or Rust. For ANSI C, each Snowball script produces a program file and corresponding header file (with .c and .h extensions). The Snowball compiler checks the consistency of its script, and this check was used to discover a typo in a seminal academic paper by Lovins which had remained undetected for 30 years.

The basic datatypes handled by Snowball are strings of characters, signed integers, and boolean truth values, or more simply strings, integers and booleans. Snowball&#x27;s characters are either 8-bit wide, or 16-bit, depending on the mode of use. In particular, both ASCII and 16-bit Unicode are supported. Like the SNOBOL programming language, the flow of control in Snowball is arranged by the implicit use of signals (each statement returns a true or false value), rather than the explicit use of constructs such as if, then, and break found in C and many other programming languages.

<text>Valentino Clemente Ludovico Garavani (; born 11 May 1932), known mononymously as Valentino, is an Italian fashion designer, the founder of the Valentino brand and company. His main lines include Valentino, Valentino Garavani, Valentino Roma, and R.E.D. Valentino.

== Career ==

=== Early life and 1950s Paris years ===
Valentino was born in Voghera, in the Italian province of Pavia, on the 11th of May 1932. His mother named him after screen idol Rudolph Valentino. He became interested in fashion while in primary school in his native Voghera, when he apprenticed under his aunt Rosa and local designer Ernestina Salvadeo, an aunt of noted artist Aldo Giorgini. Valentino then moved to Paris to pursue this interest with the help of his mother Teresa de Biaggi and his father Mauro Garavani. There Valentino studied at the École des Beaux-Arts and at the Chambre Syndicale de la Couture Parisienne.

His first choice for an apprenticeship, in Paris, was Jacques Fath, then Balenciaga. He found an apprenticeship with Jean Dessès where he helped Countess Jacqueline de Ribes sketch her dress ideas. He then joined Guy Laroche for two years.
After five years, Valentino left Jean Dessès over an incident about prolonging a vacation in Saint-Tropez that still makes him uncomfortable today. Rescued by his friend Laroche, he joined his &quot;tiny, tiny&quot; fashion house. After discussions with his parents, he decided to return to Italy and set up in Rome in 1959, as pupil of Emilio Schuberth and then collaborated with Vincenzo Ferdinandi&#x27;s atelier before opening his own fashion house.

=== Rome ===

In 1960 Valentino left Paris and opened a fashion house in Rome on the posh Via Condotti with the backing of his father and an associate of his. More than an atelier, the premises resembled a real &quot;maison de haute couture&quot;. Everything was very grand and models flew in from Paris for his first show. Valentino became known for his red dresses, in the bright shade that became known in the fashion industry as &quot;Valentino red&quot;.

On 31 July 1960, Valentino met Giancarlo Giammetti at the Café de Paris on the Via Veneto in Rome. One of three children, Giammetti was in his second year of architecture school, living at home with his parents in the haut bourgeois Parioli section of Northern Rome. That day Giammetti gave Valentino a lift home in his Fiat and a friendship, as well as a long-lasting partnership, started. The day after, Giammetti was to leave for Capri for vacation and, by coincidence, Valentino was also going there, so they met again on the island 10 days later. Giammetti would shortly thereafter abandon the University to become Valentino&#x27;s business and life partner. When Giammetti arrived, the business situation of Valentino&#x27;s atelier was in fact not brilliant: in one year he had spent so much money that his father&#x27;s associate pulled out of the business, and had to fight against bankruptcy.

=== Breakthrough in Florence (1962–1967) ===
Valentino&#x27;s international debut took place in 1962 in Florence, the Italian fashion capital of the time.

At some point in 1964, Jacqueline Kennedy had seen Gloria Schiff, the twin sister of the Rome-based fashion editor of American &quot;Vogue&quot; and Valentino&#x27;s friend Consuelo Crespi, wearing a two-piece ensemble in black organza at a gathering. It made such an impression that Kennedy contacted Ms. Schiff to learn the name of the ensemble&#x27;s designer, which was Valentino. In September 1964, Valentino was to be in the United States to present a collection of his work at a charity ball at New York&#x27;s Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Mrs. Kennedy wanted to view the collection but could not attend the event, so Valentino decided to send a model, sales representative and a selection of key pieces from his collection to Mrs. Kennedy&#x27;s apartment on Fifth Avenue. Mrs. Kennedy ordered six of his haute couture dresses, all in black and white, and wore them during her year of mourning following President John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination. From then on, she was a devoted client and would become a friend. Valentino would later design the white Valentino gown worn by Kennedy at her wedding to Greek tycoon Aristotle Onassis. In 1966 he moved his shows from Florence to Rome, where the following year he produced an all-white collection that became famous for the &quot;V&quot; logo he designed.

=== 1970s ===
Throughout the 1970s, Valentino&#x27;s womenswear for both couture and ready-to-wear generally followed the trends of the time, opening the decade with an emphasis on midiskirts worn over miniskirts, fitted, knee-high boots, trousers, and some ethnic looks, mostly with a fit-and-flare silhouette. In 1971, he paired more brightly colored midis and knee-length skirts with that year&#x27;s vogue for hot pants, also continuing to show trousers like culottes and knickers with the gently flared standard trouser of the time. He was noted for his tailored clothes. A forties revival was a focus for a time, and Valentino showed platform shoes, padded shoulders, and knee-length skirts, along with occasional forays into thirties and fifties styles, all kept modern by an emphasis on pants.

In 1972, he started the year favoring trousers but ended it showing only skirts, including being one of the only designers to present day dresses in a period dominated by separates. He did, though, endorse the favored full sleeves and layering that were seen on many runways and continued to move away from his trademark monotone or bicolor palette, often cream and/or red, and moved into brighter colors and prints. He did knee-length, square-shouldered forties revival again in 1973, continuing with bright prints, including a Bakst influence. During these early seventies collections, his evening styles were often ruffled and sometimes had asymmetric hems, and his V logo ranged from prominent to subtle, sometimes paving seemingly every surface, as in 1970, other times a single, barely discernible letter on a belt or scarf.

The mid-seventies move toward fuller peasant silhouettes was seen in Valentino&#x27;s work somewhat – dirndl skirts, off-the-shoulder flounces, petticoats, blousons, shawls, ponchos, and layering, but he deemphasized the look&#x27;s characteristic boots and was sometimes criticized for including styles that were too heavily constructed and stiff in this period of minimal construction and flowing shapes, as well as for emphasizing conspicuous-consumption wealth projection during the more egalitarian atmosphere that prevailed in the mid-seventies. He did, though, return to his serviceable presentation of monochrome and bicolor garment groupings.

With the high-fashion world&#x27;s Fall 1978 move toward big shoulders, more formal suits, and a more conspicuous-consumption, 1940s-50s-retro style, Valentino presented shapes that echoed the big shoulders of the 1930s and adopted the blatantly seductive styles being favored by designers in narrow, slit skirts and black bras worn on their own under padded-shoulder jackets. Along with many other designers, he continued to show this style the following year in stiffly structured, broad-shouldered jackets and dresses presented with forties-fifties accessories like hats, gloves, and cinch belts. This padded-shoulder, high-glamour style would continue to dominate fashion into the eighties and bring Valentino unprecedented fame.
Throughout the 1970s Valentino spent considerable time in New York City, where his presence was embraced by society personalities such as &quot;Vogue&quot;&#x27;s editor-in-chief Diana Vreeland and the art icon Andy Warhol.

=== 1980s ===
Valentino was one of the favorite designers of actress Joan Collins, famous as one of the stars of the popular US television show &quot;Dynasty&quot;, which ran from 1981 to 1989, bringing the designer additional visibility and name recognition among the public. The era&#x27;s conspicuous-consumption, 1940s-50s-inspired ballgowns, cocktail dresses, and broad-shouldered, sharply tailored suits were taken up with aplomb by Valentino, whose style at the time was similar to that of Givenchy and Oscar de la Renta.

A few themes remained constant throughout his eighties collections: his familiar color groupings; his penchant for blatant displays of luxury, wealth, and opulence; broad shoulder padding; and a more comfortable cut than he was showing at the start of the big-shoulder era at the end of the seventies. He continued to show his ready-to-wear collections in Paris and his couture collections in Rome.

In the first half of the eighties, he mostly followed the short, narrow skirt line with broad-shouldered tops also followed by Saint Laurent, Givenchy, Ungaro, and others, but also presented longer, looser looks, the chemise dresses of the era, and a variety of pant shapes. During the mid-eighties, the fashion press and buyers often rated him higher than all other Paris designers, ranking him with Saint Laurent and Lagerfeld. He felt confident enough with this elevated stature that in 1985 he added his moniker to a line of designer jeans. Like other designers, he showed a variety of miniskirts throughout the eighties among his other lengths and garments, and he joined the rest of the fashion world in 1987-88 in showing almost exclusively mini lengths for two seasons and then followed his colleagues by the end of 1988 in retreating from an exclusive mini-length focus.

From 1983 to 1985, Valentino contributed a specially appointed Valentino Edition to the Continental line of US luxury automaker Lincoln.

=== The Accademia Valentino ===
1990 marked the opening of the Accademia Valentino, designed by architect Tommaso Ziffer, a cultural space located near Valentino&#x27;s atelier in Rome, for the presentation of art exhibitions. The next year, encouraged by their friend Elizabeth Taylor, Valentino Garavani and Giancarlo Giammetti created L.I.F.E., an association for the support of AIDS-related patients, which benefits from the activities of the Accademia Valentino.

=== From HdP group to Marzotto group ===
In 1998 Valentino and his partner Giancarlo Giammetti sold the company for approximately US$300 million to HdP, an Italian conglomerate controlled, in part, by the late Gianni Agnelli, the head of Fiat. In 2002, Valentino S.p.A., with revenues of more than $180 million, was sold by HdP to Marzotto Apparel, a Milan-based textile giant, for $210 million. Maison Valentino is controlled since 2012 by Mayhoola for Investments S.P.C., a holding company sustained by a group of private investors from Qatar. It is present in over 90 countries through 160 Valentino directly operated boutiques and over 1300 points of sale.

=== Retirement ===

On 4 September 2007, Valentino announced that he would retire fully in January 2008 from the world stage after his last haute couture show in Paris. He delivered his last women&#x27;s ready-to-wear show in Paris on 4 October.

His last haute couture show was presented in Paris at the Musée Rodin on 23 January 2008. It was, however, somewhat marred by his criticism of fellow Italian design duo Dolce &amp; Gabbana, and the death of Australian actor Heath Ledger, although few allowed these things to detract from his final show, which received a standing ovation from the entire audience that included hundreds of notable names from all areas of show business. Many models returned to attend Valentino&#x27;s last haute couture show; the audience included Eva Herzigová, Naomi Campbell, Claudia Schiffer, Nadja Auermann, Karolína Kurková and Karen Mulder.

In September 2007, Valentino decided to leave the Creative Direction of his brand. Maria Grazia Chiuri and Pierpaolo Piccioli were first nominated Creative Directors of all accessories lines, and the following year, they were appointed Creative Directors of Valentino, guiding all collections, from Prêt-à-Porter to Haute Couture. In June 2015 the Creative Directors were bestowed with the prestigious CFDA International Award, recognition that paid homage to the professional path and to the success of the Maison. On 7 July 2016 Maison Valentino nominated Pierpaolo Piccioli its sole Creative Director of the Maison.

In March 2024, it was announced that Alessandro Michele would take over as creative director following his departure from Gucci.

== Movies ==

In 2006 Valentino appeared in a cameo role, as himself, in the hit movie &quot;The Devil Wears Prada&quot;.

&quot;&quot; a feature-length documentary film on the designer, premiered at the 2008 Venice International Film Festival. Produced and directed by Matt Tyrnauer, special correspondent for &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine, the film follows Valentino and his inner circle throughout various events, including last year&#x27;s anniversary show celebrating his 45-year career.

During the movie&#x27;s production from June 2005 to July 2007, the filmmakers shot more than 250 hours of footage with exclusive, unprecedented access to Valentino and his entourage. &quot;We were let in to the inner circle, but we had to stick it out for a long time, practically move in, to capture the truly great moments&quot;, says Tyrnauer. &quot;Valentino is surrounded by a tight-knit family of friends and employees, but, eventually, their guard came down and they forgot there was a camera crew in the room.&quot; The film had its North American premiere at the 2008 Toronto International Film Festival. It was released theatrically in the United States on 18 March in New York City and selected cities.

== Honors ==
On 6 July 2006, French president Jacques Chirac awarded Valentino the Chevalier de la . During the festivities for the 45th year of Valentino&#x27;s career, the Mayor of Rome, Walter Veltroni, announced that the site of the Valentino Museum would be a building in via San Teodoro in Rome, between the Palatine Hill and the Bocca della Verità. On 24 January 2008, Valentino was presented with the Medal of the City of Paris for his services to fashion in the city where he was educated.

On 7 September 2011, Valentino was presented with the sixth annual Couture Council Award for Artistry of Fashion from the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology at a benefit luncheon held at the David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center in New York City.

In 2017, Valentino was the recipient of the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. His Golden Plate was presented by Awards Council member Jeremy Irons.

In 2023, Valentino won the &#x27;Outstanding Achievement Award&#x27; at the Fashion Awards.

== Home decoration ==

Valentino and his associate Giancarlo Giammetti share homes and apartments around the world including the following:

* Villa on the Via Appia Antica, a historical landmark in Rome bought in 1972. The villa is decorated by Renzo Mongiardino and Adrian Magistretti with influences of China, Italy, and France.
* 19th century mansion in Holland Park, London. The centerpiece of this mansion is the grand salon that houses five late Picassos and a small salon with two Basquiats and one painting by Damien Hirst.
* Penthouse on Fifth Avenue in New York, near the Frick Museum overlooking Central Park decorated by Jacques Grange with paintings by Richard Prince, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Roy Lichtenstein, Andy Warhol, Willem de Kooning and Fernand Léger.
* , a castle in the communes of Crespières and Davron near Paris. A 17th-century residence outside Paris, Château of Wideville was built by Louis XIII&#x27;s finance minister and later home to one of Louis XIV&#x27;s mistresses. Valentino acquired the eight-bedroom castle in 1995 and commissioned its restoration to the eminent interior decorator Henri Samuel. The castle comprises 280-acre gardens designed by Wirtz International, a &quot;pigeonnier&quot; tower, a pavilion containing a shell grotto, a building housing the archives of Valentino Garavani Archives. The chateau stairway is flanked by stone dogs carved in the 17th century by the French artist Jacques Sarazin. Valentino stages always organizes a theme party at the castle during the fashion weeks in Paris.
* Chalet Gifferhorn in Gstaad, Switzerland where he spends winter celebrations. The house has paintings of Arcimboldo and the famous sheep-shaped furniture by les Lalanne.
Valentino also spends half of his time in Giancarlo Giammetti&#x27;s homes:
* 18th-century Villa &quot;La Vagnola&quot; in Cetona, Tuscany which Giancarlo Giammetti purchased in 1986. Renowned Italian decorator Renzo Mongiardino created enchanted interiors inspired by the villa&#x27;s classical gardens. For twenty-five years Giancarlo Giammetti and Valentino vacationed here to escape the pressures of Rome and their international jet set lifestyle.

Portions of the property date back to the 16th-century but it was in 1750, on the occasion of his marriage to Maria Antonietta Vagnoli, that the nobleman Sallustio Terrosi started building the villa. The villa&#x27;s decoration includes Empire pieces and Chinese wooden figurines which once adorned the Royal Pavilion at Brighton and Empire settee that belonged to Princess Mathilde, Napoleon&#x27;s niece, 2,100 rare books that Giammetti miraculously returned to the villa, missing since the 1960s. The design of the spare all-white kitchen was given to one of Giammetti&#x27;s friends, architect Tommaso Ziffer, a young decorator at the time.

The &quot;Sophia Loren&quot; guest room was so named in honor of the room&#x27;s inaugural guest, richly appointed in Old World style with a lacy ceiling designed by Mongiardino. Paolo Peyrone, a pupil of the English landscape designer Russell Page, assisted with the design of the landscaping around the house. The 18th-century stable, as it was photographed in the 1980s, became an orangery with an upstairs exercise room. The villa has a pool pavilion named &quot;La Turkerie&quot; standing in the middle of the garden was built by the Terrosi-Vagnoli family in 1837 in honor of a visiting pasha.
* Penthouse on the Quai d&#x27;Orsay in Paris, decorated by Peter Marino with a collection of modern art including two Andy Warhol Lenin&#x27;s, one red and one black, Rothko, Cy Twombly, Francis Bacon and George Dyer. The furniture includes pieces by Jean-Michel Frank, les Lalanne, Eileen Gray, Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann and Ariane Dandois.
* Apartment in Kensington, London.
* Penthouse in New York decorated by designer Jacques Grange and filled with works by Picasso, Cy Twombly, David Hockney, Jean-Michel Basquiat, and Richard Prince, Rachel Feinstein and Mark Rothko painting. The apartment comprises a pair of Tang-dynasty horses, a gilt-bronze crocodile chair by les Lalanne, a sculpture by Anselm Kiefer.
* Penthouse in Via Condotti, Rome

== Personal life ==

In the 2008 film &quot;,&quot; Valentino and Giancarlo Giammetti discuss how they met on 30 July 1960 in Via Veneto, the epicenter of Rome&#x27;s Dolce Vita. They have been together ever since, for more than 50 years, although their love relationship ended in 1972. As told by Giancarlo in his private memoirs, in 1973 Valentino met 19-year-old Carlos Souza at the Hippopotamus club in Rio de Janeiro, dating him until Carlos married Brazilian socialite Charlene Shorto in 1983. Valentino and Giancarlo later became the godfathers of Charlene and Carlos&#x27; sons, Sean and Anthony. Carlos and Charlene worked as PR for the Maison Valentino even after their divorce in 1990, and have kept a close relationship ever since.

As narrated in the book &quot;Private&quot; by Giancarlo Giammetti, Valentino in the early 1980s met his current boyfriend Bruce Hoeksema, who started as a model at Valentino to later become the vice president of the Maison. Giancarlo Giammetti said that he and Valentino together with Carlos, Charlene and Bruce form a real family. Part of this enlarged family called the &quot;tribe&quot; is also composed by Spanish Duchess Nati Abascal, French-Brazilian Princess Georgina Brandolini d&#x27;Adda and Valentino PR Daniela Giardina.

Valentino&#x27;s mother, Teresa, moved from Voghera to Rome to help with the business. Eventually he told both his parents that he was engaged to Italian actress Marilù Tolo, the only woman he had ever truly loved and with whom he had wished to have children.
Valentino and Giammetti&#x27;s lifestyle has been considered flamboyant. John Fairchild, editor-at-large at &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; and &quot;W&quot;, told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;,
Valentino adores dogs to the point that he once named a second line of clothing after his late pug Oliver. Today Valentino owns six pugs. When traveling on his 14-seat Challenger jet, Valentino and his entourage go to the airport in three cars: one for the staff and luggage, one for five of the pugs, and one for Giammetti, Valentino, and the pug Maude, who always travels with Valentino.

<doc id="919821" wikidata="Q934201" url="?curid=919821" title="1963 NHL amateur draft">
<text>The 1963 [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[NHL entry draft|amateur draft]] was the first NHL entry draft. It was a draft to assign unaffiliated amateur junior-age players to NHL teams. It was held on June 5 at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Quebec. It was the first amateur draft, which consisted of 16-year-old players.

The amateur draft was instituted by NHL president Clarence Campbell as a means of phasing out the sponsorship of amateur teams by the league&#x27;s member clubs. The NHL wanted to create what Campbell called &quot;a uniform opportunity for each team to acquire a star player&quot;. Prior to the creation of the draft NHL teams would sponsor amateur teams and players, pre-empting other NHL clubs from acquiring new, young talent, and limiting amateur players&#x27; prospects in the NHL to the team which sponsored them.

Eligibility in this draft was limited to all amateur players who would reach 17 years of age between August 1, 1963, and July 31, 1964. Under the league rules, teams were not allowed to talk to the drafted players about turning professional until they turned 18. At that point, the teams had 72 hours to get the players signed or placed on their negotiation list. Players already on sponsorship lists were ineligible.

The draft order was determined by giving the teams choice of their place in the six-team order based on a reverse order of the standings, for example, as the Boston Bruins finished last in the 1962–63 season they were given first choice of pick in the order. The final draft order was chosen to be Montreal Canadiens, Detroit Red Wings, Boston Bruins, New York Rangers, Chicago Black Hawks and Toronto Maple Leafs. The order would rotate in the next draft such that each team moved up one spot in the order, and the first pick Canadiens would move to sixth.

This first draft consisted of four rounds, however few top prospects were available to the draft in the early years as most of hockey&#x27;s top junior players had already been assigned to NHL clubs through sponsored junior teams. In the 1963 draft only 21 players, out of a possible 24 picks, were chosen. This is because teams were allowed to defer their pick to the next team in the draft order. The Red Wings chose not to exercise their third and fourth round picks, and the Black Hawks elected not to exercise their fourth round pick.

Of the players selected five eventually played in the NHL, and only one won the Stanley Cup (Peter Mahovlich). None of the players selected have been inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame.

<doc id="919825" wikidata="Q580548" url="?curid=919825" title="Romania at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Romania competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. Romanian athletes have competed at every Summer Olympic Games since its official debut in 1924, missing only two editions, including the 1948 Summer Olympics. The Romanian Olympic and Sports Committee (, &quot;COSR&quot;) sent the nation&#x27;s smallest team to the Games since the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul. A total of 108 athletes, 50 men and 58 women, had competed in 16 different sports, most notably in artistic gymnastics and rowing. For the third time in Olympic history, Romania was again represented by more female than male athletes.

The Romanian team featured several Olympic medalists from Sydney four years earlier, including coxless rowing pair Monica Roşu and Viorica Susanu, sprint canoeists Florin Popescu and Mitică Pricop, gymnastics champion Marius Urzică in men&#x27;s pommel horse, and rowers Doina Ignat and Georgeta Andrunache. Pistol shooter and 1988 Olympic champion Sorin Babii, and rowing legend Elisabeta Lipă, who won a total of seven Olympic medals in her illustrious sporting career, became the first Romanian athletes to compete in six Olympic Games. Having received the second most medals by a single athlete in the nation&#x27;s Olympic history, Lipa reprised her role to carry the Romanian flag in the opening ceremony for the second consecutive time.

Despite being the smallest team to the Games since 1988, Romania left Athens with a total of 19 Olympic medals, 8 golds, 5 silver, and 6 bronze, failing only three golds short of the total achieved in Sydney. Most of these medals were awarded to the athletes in artistic gymnastics and rowing, including three prestigious Olympic titles from Cătălina Ponor in women&#x27;s floor, balance beam, and team all-around exercises. Apart from Ponor&#x27;s Olympic glory, the nation&#x27;s highlight of the Games also came with a powerful triumph of the rowing team, as the Romanians managed to secure their title in the women&#x27;s eight. With a stark tally of eight medals, Lipa greatly emerged as the most successful female rower in the entire Olympic history after winning her fourth consecutive gold and fifth overall within a record span of 20 years.

<text>The banteng (Bos javanicus; ), also known as tembadau, is a species of wild bovine found in Southeast Asia. 

The head-and-body length is between . Wild banteng are typically larger and heavier than their domesticated counterparts, but are otherwise similar in appearance. The banteng shows extensive sexual dimorphism; adult bulls are generally dark brown to black, larger and more sturdily built than adult cows, which are thinner and usually pale brown or chestnut red. There is a big white patch on the rump. Horns are present on both sexes, and are typically long. Three subspecies are generally recognised.

Banteng are active during the day as well as at night, though activity at night is more in areas frequented by humans. Herds comprise two to forty individuals, and generally a single bull. Being herbivorous, banteng feed on vegetation such as grasses, sedges, shoots, leaves, flowers, and fruits. Banteng can survive without water for long stretches during droughts, but drink regularly if possible, especially from standing water. Not much is known about the reproductive physiology of banteng, but it might be similar to that observed in taurine cattle. After a gestation of nearly 285 days (nine to ten months), a week longer than that typically observed in taurine cattle, a single calf is born. Banteng occur in a variety of habitats throughout their range, including open deciduous forests, semi-evergreen forests, lower montane forests, grasslands, and abandoned farms.

The largest populations of wild banteng occur in Java, Cambodia, and possibly in Kalimantan (particularly East Kalimantan and North Kalimantan) and Thailand. Domesticated banteng occur in Bali and many eastern Indonesian islands (such as Sulawesi, Sumbawa, and Sumba), Australia, Malaysia, and New Guinea. Feral populations are found in Sabah and the Northern Territory of Australia. Domesticated populations are primarily used for their highly demanded meat, and are used as draught animals to a lesser extent. The wild banteng is classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, and populations have decreased by more than 50% in the past few decades. Rampant poaching (for food, game, traditional medicine and horns), habitat loss and fragmentation and susceptibility to disease are major threats throughout its range. Wild banteng are legally protected in all countries in their range, and are largely restricted to protected areas (possibly barring Cambodia). The banteng is the second endangered species to be successfully cloned, and the first clone to survive beyond infancy.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The banteng was first described by German naturalist Joseph Wilhelm Eduard d&#x27;Alton in 1823. &quot;Banteng&quot; derived from the Javanese/Sundanese name for the animal (&quot;banṭéng&quot;). D&#x27;Alton based his description on two skulls from Java (Indonesia), a male and a female; while he described the male as a banteng, he referred to the female simply as a wild ox from Java. In 1956, Dirk Albert Hooijer of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie (Leiden), where the skulls were first brought to from Java, noted that d&#x27;Alton used the name &quot;Bibos javanicus&quot;, or &quot;Bos (Bibos) javanicus&quot; if &quot;Bibos&quot; is considered a subgenus (as it is by some authors), to describe the male.

&quot;Bos leucoprymnus&quot; was suggested as a synonym in 1830, but was pointed out to be a cross between a wild banteng and a domesticated individual; Hooijer wrote that he could not infer that this was the case from the original description, and, even if it were a cross, the name would not become invalid. Other names proposed for the banteng include &quot;Bos banteng&quot; and &quot;Bos bantinger&quot;. In a 1845 revision of d&#x27;Alton&#x27;s description, the authors opined that both the specimens were wild oxen, referring to them as &quot;Bos sondaicus&quot; instead. They mistook the female for a young male, an error that continued in several publications by later authors.

===Subspecies===

Four subspecies are generally recognised based on phenotypic differences, though some authors do not accept these, citing extensive breeding between the small remaining banteng populations and other sympatric cattle. The details of these subspecies are given below:
* Javan banteng (&quot;B. j. javanicus&quot;) : Occurs in Java and possibly Bali.
* Indochinese (or Burma) banteng (&quot;B. j. birmanicus&quot;) : Occurs on the Southeast Asian mainland.
* Bali cattle (&quot;B. j. domesticus&quot;) : Occurs in Bali, Australia, the Philippines and New Guinea
* Bornean banteng (&quot;B. j. lowi&quot;) : Occurs only in Borneo. 
A 2015 phylogenetic study obtained the complete mitochondrial genome of the Bornean banteng. It showed that the Bornean banteng is closer to the gaur (&quot;Bos gaurus&quot;) than it is to other banteng subspecies, having diverged from the gaur around . Moreover, the Bornean banteng is genetically distant from taurine cattle and zebu, indicating that the wild Bornean banteng could not have hybridised with them, and therefore might form a purebreeding line. These researchers suggested that the Bornean banteng could be an independent species. A later study in 2021 by Sindling et al, which included the genome of the closely related and now likely extinct kouprey (&quot;Bos sauveli&quot;) from Cambodia, suggested that on the level of the nuclear genome, the gaur, kouprey and banteng were distinct species, but due to incomplete lineage sorting as a result of interbreeding between their ancestors, their mitochondrial genomes did not correspond to species-specific lineages. Admixture analysis suggested that East Asian zebu cattle may have ancestry derived from banteng.

==Characteristics==
The banteng is similar to taurine cattle, with head-and-body length between . Wild banteng are typically larger and heavier than their domesticated counterparts, but are otherwise similar in appearance. The mean shoulder height of wild Javan and Indochinese banteng is for cows and for bulls; Bornean banteng, the smallest subspecies, are shorter. Domesticated banteng cows reach at the shoulder, while the bulls are tall. In the wild cows weigh around , while bulls weigh around . Weights of domesticated individuals range from for females and from for males. The largest bulls attain between pegs (nose to rump) with long tail, at the withers, and weigh or more.

The banteng shows extensive sexual dimorphism; adult bulls are generally dark brown to black, larger and more sturdily built than adult cows, that are thinner and usually pale brown or chestnut red. Females and juveniles additionally have a dark line running along their back. Some bulls may retain their brown colour, sometimes with white spots similar to those seen in deer. The coat of young bulls is reddish brown, and progressively attains the adult colouration starting from the front to the rear parts. Aged bulls may turn grey. The underparts are white to light brown. The face is lighter relative to the rest of the body, whitish or tawny grey at the forehead and around the eyes but darker near the black snout. There is a big white patch on the rump, poorly developed in the Indochinese banteng; the patch may serve as a guide for herds to stay together in the dark. The legs are white below the knees. The back is particularly elevated in bulls due to the unusual lengths of the thoracic vertebrae, giving the impression of a hump. Horns are typically long, and separated by thick skin at the base. Bulls have long, slender horns with sharp tips and a circular cross-section, and are smooth except for the wrinkled base. The horns of cows are short and tightly curved, pointing inward at the tips, while those of bulls arc upwards and slightly forward. The tail, measuring , ends in a black tuft.

==Ecology and behaviour==

Banteng are active during the day as well as at night, though activity at night is more in areas frequented by humans. They typically form herds of two to forty individuals consisting of a single bull, cows and young. Older males form groups of two or three. Banteng are timid and reclusive, and tend to be highly alert, making approach difficult. Domestic individuals get stressed easily, and need to be handled with care. They rest and seek shelter for safety in dense forests. Banteng, particularly cows and calves, walk fast and manoeuvre easily through dense cover. Predators of adult banteng include the local populations of tigers and dholes (Asian wild dogs). Banteng use their strong sense of smell to detect predators and as a means of communication within a herd. Their hearing is also highly developed. Vocalisations such as roars and bellows might be common during the breeding season; calves within seven months may produce soft &quot;eng&quot; sounds. High-pitched cries are used to raise alarm.

===Diet and foraging===

Herbivores, banteng feed on vegetation such as grasses, sedges, shoots, leaves, flowers and fruits. They forage at night in open areas, taking breaks of two to three hours in between to ruminate and rest. They may move to forests at higher altitudes to forage during the rainy season. A study in Deramakot Forest Reserve (Sabah) showed the presence of several herbal seeds (such as &quot;Mimosa pudica&quot; and &quot;Paspalum conjugatum&quot;), bamboo (probably &quot;Dinochloa&quot; species) and tree bark in faecal samples. A study in West Java showed that banteng grazed mostly on the grasses &quot;Axonopus compressus&quot;, &quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot;, &quot;Ischaemum muticum&quot; and &quot;P. conjugatum&quot;, and the woody shrub &quot;Psychotria malayana&quot;. Banteng can survive without water for several days during droughts, but drink regularly if possible, especially from standing water. They frequent salt licks to satisfy their salt requirements; in the absence of licks they drink sea water instead. Banteng can drink highly saline water, and have been observed feeding on seaweed in northern Australia.

===Reproduction and life cycle===

Not much is known about the reproductive physiology of banteng, but it might be similar to that observed in taurine cattle. Domestic banteng can become sexually mature at as early as 13 months of age, and breed after another three months. They conceive easily, with a conception rate of 80–90% recorded in northern Australia. Breeding has been observed throughout the year in captivity and in wild banteng in Myanmar, though wild individuals on Cobourg Peninsula mate mainly in October and November, and in Thailand mating peaks in May and June. After a gestation of nearly 285 days (nine to ten months), a week longer than that typically observed in taurine cattle, a single calf is born. Males weigh at birth, while females weigh . Young are suckled for as long as 16 months, though some cows may continue nursing till the birth of their next calf. A study of wild banteng on Cobourg Peninsula showed that males become sexually mature at three to four years and females at two to four years; males attain their full-grown size five to six years, while females grow completely by three to four years. Calf mortality is high in the first six months of life, and declines quickly thereafter with increasing body size. Banteng live for as long as 26 years.

===Diseases and parasites===
Banteng host several endoparasites such as liver flukes (that cause fasciolosis), intestinal worms (such as &quot;Strongyloides papillosus&quot;) and &quot;Paramphistomum&quot; species (that cause paramphistomiasis). Banteng are susceptible to bovine malignant catarrhal fever caused by ovine gammaherpesvirus 2 (OvHV-2). &quot;Bali ziekte&quot;, which is a skin disease seen exclusively in banteng, begins with a dry eczema, worsening to necrosis and lacerated mucous membranes in the affected area. Other diseases including blackleg and bovine viral diarrhoea, have caused several deaths in captivity.

Ectoparasites recorded in banteng include &quot;Amblyomma testudinarium&quot;, &quot;Haemaphysalis cornigera&quot; and &quot;Rhipicephalus&quot; species. Like water buffaloes, banteng have considerable immunity against ticks and tick-borne diseases. A study in northern Australia revealed a mutually symbiotic relationship between banteng and the Torresian crow, that fed off ectoparasites (possibly ixodid ticks) from exposed parts of the banteng&#x27;s body, mainly between the hind legs. This is especially notable, as it is the first known symbiotic relationship between a native bird species and a non-native wild mammal, and it took only 150 years to develop.

==Habitat and distribution==

Banteng occur in a variety of habitats throughout their range, including open deciduous forests, semi-evergreen forests, lower montane forests, abandoned farms and grasslands. They occur up to an elevation of above the sea level. The largest populations of wild banteng occur in Cambodia, Java and possibly in Borneo, Viet Nam (Tay Nguyen) and Thailand. They are also known to occur in Kalimantan (Borneo) and Myanmar; their presence is uncertain in Bali, Sarawak, China, Laos and they are feared to have gone extinct in (if they were present in) Bangladesh, Brunei and India. Domesticated banteng occur in Bali and many eastern Indonesian islands (such as Sulawesi, Sumbawa, and Sumba), Australia, Malaysia and New Guinea. Feral populations are found in East Kalimantan, the Northern Territory in Australia, and possibly in Enggano and Sangihe in Indonesia.

In the past banteng were widespread in the Southeast Asian mainland, including Yunnan Province (China) and extending to Borneo and Java through Peninsular Malaysia; northeastern India and Bali were probably part of the range. Some researchers have excluded Bali from the historical range in the absence of fossil evidence, considering banteng to be an introduced species. However, in East Kalimantan cave art portraying a bovid, dating back to , has been suggested by some to be a depiction of banteng and led to speculation that the species might have reached up to the Wallace Line by that time. Dutch naturalist Andries Hoogerwerf notes that banteng possibly occurred since prehistoric times in Java, as indicated by remains dating back to discovered in the Sampung cave in Ponorogo Regency, Central Java.

==Interaction with humans==
Human association with banteng could date back several millennia, as suggested by animal remains and art discovered in caves. Hooijer opined that the earliest reference to the banteng was made by the Welsh naturalist Thomas Pennant in his 1800 account &quot;Outlines of the Globe&quot;, where he mentions a record of &quot;wild oxen, of a reddish brown colour, with vast horns, and of a great size&quot; in Java. However, Hoogerwerf pointed out that the banteng may have been mentioned in literature as old as the &quot;Nagarakretagama&quot; (1365 AD), an eulogy to the Javanese king Hayam Wuruk, which includes a description of a royal hunt of several animals including banteng. Moreover, records from the 18th century show that banteng were used as beasts of burden to carry several items such as coffee plants.

===Domestication and uses===

The banteng was domesticated in Indonesian islands of Java or Bali probably around 3,500 BC. The domesticated population consists of mainly the Bali cattle in Indonesia. As of 2016, Bali cattle comprise nearly 25% of the Indonesian cattle population (2.45 million out of the total 9.8 million). Domesticated banteng are docile and can tolerate hot, humid weather. Moreover, they can thrive and maintain their normal body weights even on poor quality fodder. They are primarily used for their highly demanded meat, that has been described as lean and soft. They are also used as draught animals to a limited extent; banteng are reportedly less efficient than zebu in dragging carts on roads, though they are suitable for agricultural work. However, banteng produce little milk; they lactate for only six to ten months, and the daily produce is just . They are also vulnerable to diseases such as bovine malignant catarrhal fever. In 1964, an outbreak of an unidentified disease, locally known as &quot;jembrana&quot;, wiped out 10–60% of domesticated banteng populations in several areas in Bali; similar but less intense outbreaks have continued in the following years. The disease was later determined to be caused by a lentivirus.

====In Australia====

Domesticated banteng were first introduced to Australia in 1849 with the establishment of a British military outpost called Port Essington on Cobourg Peninsula. Twenty animals were taken to the western Arnhem Land, in present-day Northern Territory, as a source of meat. A year after the outpost&#x27;s establishment, poor conditions including crop failure and tropical disease led to its abandonment. On the departure of British troops, the banteng were released from their grazing pastures and allowed to form a feral population. By the 1960s, researchers realised that a population of about 1,500 individuals had developed in the tropical forests of Cobourg Peninsula. As of 2007, around 8,000–10,000 feral banteng occur in Australia, mainly in Garig Gunak Barlu National Park (Cobourg Peninsula, Northern Territory). In a survey published in 1990, the population density in the forests was found to be around , close to that on their initial introduction 140 years ago.

Australian banteng are considered a non-native vermin species, as they reportedly trample and destroy vegetation cover by overgrazing, and sometimes harm and kill people who may closely approach them. Moreover, banteng can transmit lethal diseases such as brucellosis to humans as well as other cattle. As such banteng are occasionally shot to bring down their numbers in Australia, but some have expressed concern about their conservation given the decline in banteng populations outside the country. In a study in the monsoon forests of Garig Gunak Barlu National Park, banteng were found to cause little damage by overgrazing, especially when compared with feral pigs in the region. Instead, grazing by banteng possibly minimises potential dry grass build-up, thus limiting encroachment of seasonal fires (hence postfire grassland) into monsoonal forest areas, and this may help with the dispersal and germination of seeds. 
====Hybrids====

Domesticated banteng have been hybridised with other types of cattle. Madura cattle, found in Java, are fertile hybrids of banteng and zebu. A small breed, the bulls weigh between and the cows weigh . They are used in local traditional events such as bull racing and cow beauty contests. Other hybrids include Donggala, Galekan and Java Brebes (Jabres) cattle. While all hybrids with zebu are fertile, the male hybrids resulting from a cross with taurine cattle are sterile. A program to cross-breed domestic and wild banteng began in June 2011, resulting in five pregnancies. This was intended to help improve the quality and productivity of the domesticated breed. The wild bulls were transported from the Baluran National Park in Situbondo.

=== As symbol ===
Certain elements in the Indonesian independent movements proposed it to be part of the Indonesian flag before the 1939 decided in favour of the plain red-and-white flag.

The banteng&#x27;s head appears as one of the five emblems in the shield of Indonesia&#x27;s coat-of-arms, &quot;Garuda Pancasila&quot;. The emblem appears on the top-left of the shield, representing the fourth principle of the Indonesian five-point state philosophy (Pancasila), &quot;Democracy that is Guided by the Inner Wisdom in the Unanimity Arising Out of Deliberations Amongst Representatives&quot;. A number of political parties in the country used the banteng&#x27;s head as its symbol, including the Indonesian National Party (of President Sukarno), the Indonesian Democratic Party, and the Indonesian Democratic Party of Struggle (of Presidents Megawati Sukarnoputri and Joko Widodo).

===Threats and conservation===

The wild banteng is classified as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, and populations have decreased by more than 50% in the past few decades. In 2008, the IUCN estimated the global banteng population at 5,000–8,000 individuals. Rampant poaching (for food, game, traditional medicine and horns), habitat loss and fragmentation and susceptibility to disease are major threats throughout the range. Most populations throughout the range are small and isolated. Banteng are legally protected in all countries in their range, and are largely restricted to protected areas. 

Most other populations are small and fragmented, and many are on the decline. Surveys in eastern Cambodia between 2009 and 2011 estimated the total population in Sre Pok Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary at 1,980–5,170 individuals. Surveys in the following years (up to 2016) in these sanctuaries and adjacent areas (such as the Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary) gave an approximate total of 4,600 individuals. Recent updates to these surveys suggest widespread collapse of these populations. The Keo Seima Wildlife Sanctuary population is estimated in have decline rapididly from 382 in 2010, with too few recorded in 2020 to produce a population estimate. Populations in Sre Pok Wildlife Sanctuary and Phnom Prich Wildlife Sanctuary have declined from around 1000 in each site in 2010 to only 370 and 485 respectively in 2020.

The only populations of more than 50 individuals in Thailand occur in the Huai Kha Khaeng Wildlife Sanctuary and possibly in the Kaeng Krachan National Park. A survey between 2000 and 2003 in Java identified four to five significant populations, with the highest numbers in the Ujung Kulon National Park (300–800 individuals), the Baluran National Park (206 individuals) and the Meru Betiri National Park (200 individuals). In East Java, a survey between 2011 and 2013 recorded rapid decline in populations in the Baluran National Park, though the numbers appeared to be stable in the Meru Betiri National Park; the researchers identified poaching, habitat disturbance, competition with other species, changes in vegetation cover and habitat loss as major threats. In Borneo numbers have fallen in areas like Kalimantan and Sabah, mainly due to poaching and human disturbance. The steepest decline (by more than 50%) took place between 1970 and 2000 due to deforestation and conversion of forests into plantations. Minor populations have been reported from areas such as Kulamba Wildlife Reserve, Deramakot Forest Reserve and Sipitang Forest Reserve during 2009–2015; individuals might still occur in the Belantikan Hulu region (Central Kalimantan), Kayan Mentarang National Park (North Kalimantan) and Kutai National Park (East Kalimantan).

====Threats to domesticated banteng====

Since a small founder event occurred in Australia with the introduction of only 20 previously domesticated banteng, a genetic bottleneck has inevitably occurred, causing all banteng presently in Australia to lack genetic diversity as a result of inbreeding. Genetic invariability can lead to inbreeding depression, resulting in harmful mutations and reduced immunity to diseases. This was proven by an analysis of 12 microsatellites, that recorded a high inbreeding coefficient of 0.58. Despite the limited genetic pool of this population, conservationists hope that populations at risk can be preserved. Some have proposed that a deliberate introduction of the endangered populations to the stable but non-native Australian variety would enable viable conservation, though how it would affect Northern Territory grazing ranges is unknown.

Another possible threat is introgression with other cattle and similar bovids throughout their range where they coexist in the wild or due to crossbreeding programs, that may compromise the genetic integrity or purity of banteng populations. This, coupled with possibly low genetic diversity in small, isolated populations, is a major concern in Sabah, where water buffaloes might crossbreed with wild banteng. However, little genetic research has been done in this area to conclusively establish the impact of such crossbreeding on banteng survival. In a bid to protect the genetic purity of Bali cattle, Bali has banned other cattle varieties on the island.

====Cloning====

The banteng is the second endangered species to be successfully cloned, and the first clone to survive beyond infancy (the first was a gaur that died two days after birth). Scientists at Advanced Cell Technology in Worcester, Massachusetts extracted DNA from skin cells of a dead male banteng, that were preserved in the San Diego Zoo&#x27;s cryobank Frozen Zoo facility, and transferred it into eggs from domestic banteng cows, a process called somatic cell nuclear transfer. Thirty embryos were created and sent to Trans Ova Genetics, where they were implanted in domestic banteng cows. Two were carried to term and delivered by Caesarian section. The first was born on 1 April 2003, and the second two days later. The second was euthanised, apparently suffering from large offspring syndrome (an overgrowth disorder), but the first survived and lived for seven years at the San Diego Zoo, where it died in April 2010 after it broke a leg and was euthanised.

<text>Quilapayún () are a folk music group from Chile and among the longest lasting and most influential ambassadors of the &quot;Nueva Canción Chilena&quot; movement and genre. Formed during the mid-1960s, the group became inseparable with the revolution that occurred in the popular music of the country under the Popular Unity Government of Salvador Allende.

Since its formation and during its forty-year history both in Chile and during its lengthy period of exile in France the group has seen modifications to its personnel lineup and the subject and content of its work. Controversy regarding irreconcilable differences with the current and former group directors led to the division into two distinctive Quilapayún ensembles; one in Chile (Quilapayún-Histórico) and one in France (Quilapayún-France).

==History==

Quilapayún originated in 1965 when Julio Numhauser and the brothers Julio and Eduardo Carrasco formed a folk music trio, which they simply called &quot;the three bearded men&quot; (viz. &quot;Quila-Payún&quot;) in the Mapuche language (viz. Mapudungun – the language of the people native to the region that is now the south of Chile, the Araucanians). Their first public performances were at the Universidad de Chile in Valparaíso, organized by their first musical director, Ángel Parra (son of Violeta Parra).

In 1966 the group won notice for its Andean music as well as the members&#x27; black ponchos, which became the group&#x27;s trademark. During this time they won their first prize, La Guitarra de Oro (The Golden Guitar) in the Primer Festival Nacional del Folklore &quot;Chile Múltiple&quot; (First National Festival of Folklore). They also made their first recording, appearing on one song of Ángel Parra, &quot;El Pueblo&quot; (&quot;The People&quot;).

At a 1966 performance in Valparaíso, the group met with Víctor Jara, with whom the group maintained a close and productive artistic association for many years. At the request of the group, Jara became Quilapayún&#x27;s musical director and worked on the group&#x27;s discipline and stage performances, and the style and content of the music. Jara presented them to the record label Odeon Records, where they recorded five LPs. Their first album, &quot;Quilapayún&quot;, was basically an Andean music album, but included songs of Ángel Parra, Víctor Jara and new compositions of Eduardo Carrasco such as &quot;La Paloma&quot; and &quot;El canto del cuculi&quot;.

In 1967 Quilapayún recorded an album together with Víctor Jara, &quot;Canciones folklóricas de América&quot; (&quot;Folk Songs of America&quot;). During this time Julio Numhauser left the group over disputes over the group&#x27;s style of music, and was replaced by Guillermo &quot;Willy&quot; Oddó. During 1967 they also toured the USSR, Italy, France and other parts of Europe, and recorded an LP with the Chilean painter and poet Juan Capra.

In 1968, Quilapayún participated in the launch of a new record label of &quot;La Jota&quot; (Chile&#x27;s Communist Party Youth Organization). To the surprise of many commercial record labels, their LP &quot;X Vietnam&quot;, which included songs from the Spanish Revolution, became a nationwide success. This album established the group&#x27;s thematic and aesthetics, and created great interest and a following among progressive youth. From the success of this album the label DICAP (Discoteca del Cantar Popular) appeared, which became the springboard of the &quot;Nueva Canción Chilena&quot; (New Chilean Song) movement. DICAP recorded up to 60 musical productions until the military coup of September 11, 1973, which banned and literally destroyed the record label.

During 1968 Julio Carrasco left the group for political differences, and was replaced by Hernan Gomez. At that time they performed at various universities, and made, with Victor Jara, their first two-hour show during two days in Santiago, which was a tremendous success.

In 1969 they recorded the &quot;Basta&quot; LP, which included an eclectic and highly political collection of songs from different parts of the world, establishing the fundamental element of the New Chilean Song: its Internationalism. This album was released with a lengthy statement by the group about the nature of their work and their commitment to the socialist cause. Rodolfo Parada joined the group at this time.

In 1969 they also appeared supporting Víctor Jara on his album, &quot;Pongo en tus manos abiertas&quot; (&quot;Into your open hands&quot;) in songs such as &quot;A Cochabamba Me Voy&quot;, &quot;El Martillo&quot; and &quot;Movil Oil Special&quot;. They also joined Jara at the &quot;Primer Festival de la Nueva Cancion Chilena&quot; (First Festival of the New Chilean Song), where they jointly interpreted &quot;Plegaria a un Labrador&quot; (Prayer to a Laborer), which won the festival award. After three years Víctor Jara and Quilapayún took different paths, and Eduardo Carrasco became the group&#x27;s director.

Quilapayún was forced into exile in France after the right-wing military coup of 1973. The group settled in the city of Colombes, France, for more than 15 years. Their major works include &quot;Santa María de Iquique&quot; (1970), an album of spoken history, songs, and instrumentals about a notorious massacre in the city of Iquique, and the song &quot;El pueblo unido jamás será vencido&quot; (&quot;The people, united, will never be defeated&quot;), with lyrics by Quilapayún and music by famed Chilean songwriter and playwright Sergio Ortega.

==Split==
Quilapayún&#x27;s path has been marked by internal issues over the years, with some members leaving and others taking their place. In 1987 Willy Oddo, its most charismatic member, decided to leave France to be closer to Chile. He chose to live in Argentina. In October 1988, Pinochet was overthrown by a referendum. After 15 years of exile Quilapayun could return to Chile and performed tours in 1988, 1989, 1991 and 1992. In 1989 Eduardo Carrasco returned to Chile while most of the group continued to live in France and perform around the world. In November 1991 Willy Oddo was murdered by an offender in Santiago.

After Rodolfo Parada registered the name &quot;Quilapayún&quot; without the authorization of the other members, other historic members refused to continue with Parada and Wang, resulting in the group splitting into two, both claiming the name and legacy of Quilapayún, and leading to subsequent litigation. The Chile-based historic faction is celebrating the group&#x27;s 40 year anniversary performing concerts in Chile, Latin America and Europe, together with the &quot;historic&quot; version of Inti-Illimani, another important Chilean group. These joint concerts have been advertised and promoted as Inti+Quila. The current &quot;historic&quot; lineup includes Eduardo Carrasco, Rubén Escudero, Ricardo Venegas, Guillermo García, Ismael Oddó (son of Guillermo &quot;Willy&quot; Oddó), Hugo Lagos, Hernán Gómez, Carlos Quezada and Sebastián Quezada (son of Carlos).

On December 5, 2007, the Court of Appeal of Paris forbade Parada and Wang&#x27;s group &quot;from making use of the name QUILAPAYÚN, subject to a fine of 10 000 euros per infringement&quot;. This judgement was confirmed by the Highest Court of Appeal (Cour de Cassation de Paris) on June 11, 2009. In 2015 the band&#x27;s career reached its fiftieth year and both factions celebrated this anniversary. Parada&#x27;s group performed three big shows at the end August in Santiago, together with other well-known Chilean artists while the &quot;historic&quot; faction made a big concert in front of Palacio de la Moneda in Santiago and announced several other anniversary concerts in Chile, Colombia and Spain on its website. In November 2015, the Chilean trademark conflict ended, since the Instituto Nacional de Patentes Industriales (INAPI), after a thirteen years process gave the exclusive right for using the mark &quot;Quilapayun&quot; to the group headed by Carrasco.

<doc id="919846" wikidata="Q12202092" url="?curid=919846" title="Tabligh">
<text>The process of Islamic Tabligh () or conveying or propagation is a major Islamic mission on which Islam has built its existence and identity in human life. Per the Oxford Dictionary of Islam, the modern use of the term is interchangeable with dawah.

According to scholars, in Islam, tabligh is Quranic preaching as conveying the truth to people’s minds and bringing them out of the darkness of ignorance. Islam claims monotheism as a bright truth called tawhid. Tabligh means conveying that truth to people’s minds and intellects. It can also be said that tabligh is teaching people the rulings of the Islamic religion and divine knowledge, giving people good tidings of paradise and the blessings of Allah, encouraging them to work to obtain the pleasure of Allah, warning them against disobeying the commands of Allah and calling them to believe in the fundamentals of Islam and to act on the branches.

== Etymology==
The linguistic meaning of at-tabligh is propagation, conveyance, deliver or distribution, and its noun is adulthood or youth. Bulug, ablagh and tabligh mean to reach, transport, convey and deliver to a desired goal or desired limit, whether this limit or goal is a place, time or a morally determined matter. This meaning implies a sense of exaggeration in the expression, which takes the word beyond the limits of a realistic meaning. 

==Definition==
It can be deduced from the linguistic meaning and Quranic usage that Tabligh in Islam is presenting and conveying the divine Islamic teachings and guidance to people. Allah said: “O Messenger, proclaim that which has been revealed to you from your Lord. And if you do not, then you have not conveyed His message. And God will protect you from the people.” Many Quranic verses and narrations are found that speak about the status of Tabligh and calling and their importance in the lives of nations and peoples throughout history, due to their connection to the various aspects of human society, its levels, and its otherworldly and worldly requirements, and the fact that they represent the direct intermediary between heaven and earth, and the means that Allah chose to guide, teach, and purify His creation. The detailed hadith that was mentioned about the call, communication, guidance, direction, enjoining good and the like in many places in the Book and Sunnah is nothing but the best evidence of the divine keenness to convey the heavenly laws, especially the Islamic law, and to teach its rulings to the people, which is what we call “the process of communication and calling to Allah.” Therefore, informing people about Islamic rulings and divine knowledge, giving believers good tidings of Paradise and divine bliss, warning those who disobey of punishment, and warning them against the consequences of deviating after worldly desires and pleasures and forgetting the Hereafter is the purpose of Islamic preaching. Preaching is the goal of the existence of every prophet. If it were not for the mission of preaching, sending prophets would have been in vain and meaningless. Sending prophets is a manifestation of the attribute of mercy and compassion. They are like the sun in guidance and benefit to humanity. These two attributes were most evident in Muhammad in the words of Allah in Surat Al-Anbiya: “And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a mercy to the worlds.” If he had not come and renewed the call of the previous prophets, Allah’s mercy would not have been revealed to us, and we would have remained lost and confused in the desert of ignorance, disbelief, and the desolate misguidance.

==In the Quran==
The word is mentioned in many places of Quran including in verse 67 of Sura al-Ma&#x27;idah.
The word “ balagh ” and its derivatives in the Quran originally have this meaning. For example, Quran says: 
That is, until the sacrificial animal reaches its designated place, and the goal or objective here is spatial. For example, the Almighty said: “Until, when he reaches his full strength and reaches forty years, he says, ‘My Lord, inspire me to be grateful for Your favor.’” Until he reaches the time when he is mentally and physically complete, which is the time when he has completed forty years of his life. The goal, as is clear, is temporal. And similar to the saying of Allah: He said, &quot;If I ask you about anything after this, do not accompany me. You have already reached an excuse from me.&quot; meaning that I have reached the point where my excuse is not accepted. This is a spiritual matter. Hence, the meaning of tabligh or conveying that is intended to be explained is to deliver one thing to another. The meaning of tabligh or conveying is often used in spiritual matters and is less often used in tangible matters, such as when we say: I conveyed or delivered a message to Zaid, or someone a warning. Allah said: &quot;I convey to you the messages of my Lord and advise you.&#x27; meaning that I am charged with conveying to you the messages of Allah, which are His teachings and guidance.

The Quran has used different terms, but they all have one meaning, such as:
# Dawah () or Call, such as allahs saying in Surah Nuh: “He said, ‘My Lord, indeed I have called my people night and day.’” [Nuh: 5].
# Irshad () or Guidance, such as Allah&#x27;s in Surah Al-Jinn: “He guides to the right path, so we have believed in him, and we will never associate with our Lord anyone.” [Al-Jinn: 2].
# Tabligh () or Conveying the message, such as Allah&#x27;s saying in Surat Al-Ahzab: “Those who convey the messages of Allah and fear Him and do not fear anyone except Allah. And sufficient is Allah as Accountant.” [Al-Ahzab: 39].
# Tabshir () or Giving good tidings, such as Allah&#x27;s saying in Surat Al-Furqan: “And We have not sent you, [O Muhammad], except as a bringer of good tidings and a warner.” [Al-Furqan: 56].
==Foundations of all the prophets&#x27; tabligh==
Three foundations on which all the prophets&#x27; tabligh was based:

#The comprehensive view, as they address the human being from all aspects, as they address the human being&#x27;s mind, logic, heart and feelings so that these human windows are all in the lights of divine revelation, as the mind, logic and emotions go hand in hand in the call of Muhammad, and one aspect of it is not exploited at the expense of the other, and the Holy Qur’an defines the features of the path of the prophets in the Allah&#x27;s saying in:Surat Yusuf Say, &quot;This is my way; I invite to Allah with insight, I and those who follow me. And exalted is Allah; and I am not of those who associate others with Allah.&quot; 108 [Yusuf: 108].
#One of the foundations of preaching among the prophets is: not waiting for reward from people, but from Allah, who sent them as preachers and guides. Preaching is the job and mission of the prophets, and their motto is: “My reward is only from Allah.”
#Preaching among the prophets leaves the results to God. The job of the prophet is to preach, and as for guiding people and their response, it is for Allah. Fethullah Gülen refers to the state of some prophets who no one believed with them, even though they exerted all their efforts in preaching. However, their enthusiasm did not wane or their resolve weaken until the last moment.
==View on Tabligh==
One of the roles of the school is to teach the student knowledge, but it must whet his appetite to ask for more of it, as Tabligh is a requirement imposed by the increasing need to convey that knowledge to the minds of students because teachers should never forget that knowledge develops with the development of communication needs within the group that seeks knowledge. It is natural that the development of these needs is directly linked to the development of the group at the level of thought and society. This is evident in the development of technology, and the growing division of work also brings new means that parallel the emerging jobs and new technologies. Tabligh is an important issue, today it is at the top of everything, because the world today relies on the support of tabligh (communication) and media.

==Ruling on Tabligh==
Scholars find that the fard or obligation, as is apparent in all the verses that speak about tabligh, is specific to the messengers and does not extend to others, which is contrary to what came in the obligation of calling to Islam, this does not mean that conveying is limited to the messengers only, because the stage of tabligh or Islamic conveying, is in two stages. The first stage is the stage of conveying it from Allah to the people, and it can be expressed as the stage of receiving, and this stage is limited to the messengers who receive Allah&#x27;s teachings from Him and then convey them to the people around them. Then comes the second stage of conveying, which is the stage of spreading, and this stage - the stage of spreading - is one of the duties of the followers of the messengers who believed in their teachings, and in the Islamic nation, the scholars are charged with it, considering that they are his heirs in his teachings and religion. One of the most important duties is to spread Islamic teachings and disseminate them among the people, and this is the meaning of conveying and its ruling is the obligation on the scholars who are able to do so. Hence, the ruling on tabligh or conveying, like the ruling on calling to Islam, is a communal duty. However, the ruling on conveying the message is obligatory for every scholar, even if it is not obligatory for every individual in the nation.

==Tabligh in Salat==
It is one of the followers raising his voice if the imam in congregational prayer has a weak voice so that they can follow the movements of the prayer (salat). The imam must raise his voice so that the congregation he is praying with can hear. If the congregation increases and he cannot hear them, then tabligh is recommended; because tabligh in prayer when there is no need is disliked, but when there is a need it is recommended. The one who is following the imam should limit himself to the voice that ensures that those behind him can hear him, not to increase it.

In the fatwas of Sheikh Imam Muhammad Abduh, scholars stated that tabligh when there is no need is disliked. In fact, some of them reported the agreement of the four imams that tabligh in this case is a reprehensible innovation, i.e. it is disliked. However, when there is a need for it, it is recommended, and they stated that it is disliked for the one reporting to increase the announcement according to the need.

Sheikh Abdul-Aziz Ibn Baz was asked a similar question and he answered by saying: If the congregation can hear the voice of the imam and it is not hidden from them, then there is no need to announce it. However, if it may be hidden from some of them, such as in the back rows, then it is recommended to announce it. Prophet Muhammad prayed one day when he was sick and his voice was weak, so Abu Bakr used to announce it on his behalf, so there is nothing wrong with that. If there is a need to announce it due to the size of the mosque and the large number of people in the congregation, or because the imam’s voice is weak due to illness or something else, then some of the congregation should announce it. However, if the voice is clear to everyone and is not hidden from anyone in the outskirts, and it is known that everyone can hear it, then there is no need to announce it and it is not prescribed.

<text>Larcena Pennington Page (January 10, 1837 – March 31, 1913), born Larcena Ann Pennington, was an American pioneer known for surviving a kidnapping by Apache as a young married woman of 23 years old in present-day Arizona. Left for dead and unable to stand, she crawled over the next sixteen days to reach safety.

After her kidnapping, Larcena was indirectly involved in several other incidents with Apache. Much of her family died during her life as a result of native attacks or from infectious disease on the frontier.

==Early life==
Born Larcena Ann Pennington, in Nashville, Tennessee, she was the daughter of Elias and Julia Ann Pennington. One of 12 children, she had seven sisters and four brothers. Her father, Elias, was the son of Elijah Pennington, a soldier who served under General George Washington at Valley Forge during the American Revolutionary War. Her mother Julia Ann Pennington died within a year after the birth of her twelfth child while her husband was away. After that, the father took the surviving Penningtons to an area near Keechi, Texas.

=== Leaves Texas ===
In 1857, in hopes of economic prosperity, the Pennington family traveled west, originally with the intention of settling in California. From Keechi they headed west with three wagons pulled by oxen and mules, and a herd of cattle. The wagon train forded the Pecos River, where several of the cows drowned; it continued to Paso del Norte. From there they followed the Rio Grande north to Mesilla and then moved west toward Tucson. They passed through several canyons where Apache were known to spring surprise attacks, including Doubtful Canyon, Apache Pass, and Cooke&#x27;s Canyon. (A wagon train was later attacked there in the Battle of Cookes Canyon in 1861.) They passed through the San Simon Valley, Sulphur Springs Valley, the San Pedro and Dragoon Springs on their way west.

In June 1857, the Penningtons temporarily stopped at Sonoita Creek, next to Fort Buchanan, because their animals were either exhausted, or had been stolen by Apache, and Larcena had contracted malaria. The men obtained a contract from the government to supply the fort with hay and the women sewed soldiers&#x27; uniforms for pay. When they completed the contract, the Penningtons moved west to Calabasas, along the Santa Cruz River. Before September 1859 they moved into the former residence of Governor Manuel Maria Gandara, who was displaced after the United States victory in the Mexican–American War.

=== Marriage and family ===
While at Fort Buchanan, Larcena met lumberjack John Hempstead Page and fell in love. The two married on December 24, 1859, becoming the first American citizens to be wed in Tucson. At that time, the settlement had fewer than one thousand people.

== Kidnapped ==

After they married, Larcena moved from the fort to Tucson, but her husband lived and worked at Canoa Ranch, south of present-day Green Valley. Canoa Ranch was owned by Bill Kirkland. Page lived there because it was only east of Madera Canyon and the Santa Rita Mountains, where he and his partner, William Randall, had a small lumber mill at the canyon. There they processed pine trees to transport to Tucson by wagon for sale.

Larcena was employed as a teacher for Kirkland&#x27;s eleven-year-old ward, Mercedes Sais Quiroz. Eventually Larcena moved to Canoa Ranch with Mercedes, but she became ill, possibly with malaria. Page decided to move his wife and Mercedes out of the desert and into a cabin near the &quot;Big Rock&quot; at the lumber mill. He thought that the higher elevation would help Larcena recover. On March 15, 1860, Page and Randall picked up Larcena, Mercedes and their dog for the trip to the cabin by wagon. They headed west through the Santa Rita foothills toward Madera Canyon.

They had nearly reached their destination when they decided to stop and rest for the night. This site was south of the &quot;Big Rock&quot;. They did not know that five Pinal Apache warriors were watching the camp from the surrounding hills. The next morning, Randall went out to hunt for breakfast and, at around 10:00 am, Page rode up the canyon to check on a load of lumber at the mill, leaving Larcena and Mercedes alone at camp. Larcena was alarmed by the dog barking and hearing Mercedes scream. The Apache first captured Mercedes and next entered Larcena&#x27;s tent, removing her husband&#x27;s revolver from her before she could shoot.

The Apache were armed with lances and bows. Four were young men but the fifth was older and spoke a little Spanish. The older Apache told Mercedes that he had killed Page; and Larcena screamed after the girl told her. One of the Apache put his lance to Larcena and threatened to kill her if she didn&#x27;t stop. After stealing &quot;whatever they could&quot; and cutting open the Pages&#x27; sacks of food, the Apache took the two women northeast, who walked roughly along the base of the Santa Rita Mountains, toward one of their strongholds along the San Pedro River.

They stopped a short distance from the camp to take apart a feather bed they had been trying to carry off. Larcena screamed and again was told to be quiet or be killed. Robert H. Forbes, author of &quot;Penningtons: Pioneers of Early Arizona,&quot; wrote that up to that time, neither of the captives had been molested in any way, but Larcena later said that the Apache &quot;pre-tended to ambush them from behind trees or play-fully pointed the captured pistol at them.&quot; One of the Apache recounted that all the land in that area was once part of their domain until the white man came. The journey to the San Pedro was rough, but both Larcena and Mercedes tore off pieces of their clothing and bent twigs to make an easily recognizable trail. Forbes says, &quot;One of the Apaches melted snow in his hands for them [the captives] to drink. Mrs. Page was pushed or pulled up steep places in the trail and Mercedes was carried pick-a-back. Their hats were restored to them from the plunder and fair progress was made...&quot;

=== Left for dead ===
Page had not been killed and returned to camp to discover both his wife and Mercedes missing. He assumed they had been taken by Apache and gathered Randall and a few other men from the mill to help follow their trail. Just before sunset, when the Apache and women captives were about from the camp, east of the present day Helvetia, one of the Apache noticed Page&#x27;s party approaching from behind. The Apache quickened their pace but Larcena could not keep up. While the group was standing atop a ridge, the Apache made Larcena remove her skirt and corset. As she turned to continue walking, one of the natives struck her in the back with a lance. She fell over the side of the ridge, about seventeen feet, becoming lodged against a pine tree. The Apache followed Larcena down the ridge, thrusting their spears into her and throwing rocks at her. One of the rocks hit Larcena in the face and she fell unconscious.

The Apache dragged her body into a snow bank behind a tree to hide her body from the trail. They removed her boots and one of them put them on. Larcena woke up a short time later and could hear her husband&#x27;s voice coming from the trail. She tried to call, but was too weak for him to hear her. Because one of the Apache was wearing Larcena&#x27;s boots, Page followed his trail and passed unknowing by his wife. He trailed the Apache to the Rincon Mountains and beyond the Catalina Mountains. Still unable to find his wife, Page went to Tucson and recruited a posse for a second attempt. Another posse also formed in Tubac but it was also unsuccessful.

=== Crawls to saw mill ===
Larcena remained in the snow bank for about three days before waking up in the middle of the night. First she ate some snow and looked after her wounds, for she had been &quot;bruised with stones and cut with sixteen lance wounds in her back and arms.&quot; She made her way down the ridge, sleeping again until sunrise. On the next morning, she began looking around trying to understand where she was. Knowing that the camp and the lumber mill were to the southeast, she looked in that direction and sighted a &quot;small sharp-pointed hill.&quot; Historians have identified this from her account as Huerfano Hill, about west of Helvetia. Because of her wounds and loss of blood, for the next several days Larcena crawled the back to camp. She survived on &quot;seeds, herbage and wild onions, with snow water to drink.&quot;

According to Forbes, &quot;Night by night (unable to lie on her back because of her wounds) she crouched upon her knees and arms on the ground and dreamed of food; but when in her sleep she reached out for the pot of beans before her, she awoke to find her hands clutching only gravel.&quot; One day, Larcena came across a bear&#x27;s nest and wanted to sleep there but she knew it was a bad idea and went away. Ten days after her &quot;terrible journey&quot; began, on March 26, she climbed to the top of a ridge and saw the road that leads to Madera Canyon and the camp. Hearing the sound of voices and wagon wheels, Larcena attached her petticoat to a stick to signal for help. She also screamed but the people in the wagon passed on without seeing or hearing anything. When Larcena reached the camp, two days later, she found a smoldering campfire, some flour and some coffee that was still on the ground from when the Apaches cut open the sacks of food. Using water from a nearby stream, and a piece of her clothing, Larcena prepared some bread on the fire, made some coffee, and then rested for the night.

On the next morning, March 31, Larcena followed the road east to the Big Rock and the lumber mill. Forbes says that &quot;as she drew near she was seen, but not at first recognized. With clotted hair and gaping wounds, nearly naked, emaciated and sunburned, she was at first mistaken for an unfortunate outcast squaw and the men ran for their guns.&quot; It was only when Larcena called out her name that she was recognized. But even then, one man, named Smith, insisted that she was a ghost because he couldn&#x27;t believe that a twenty-three-year-old woman could survive so long under such trying circumstances. One of the men took Larcena into a building and had her fed and washed while another man went to get a doctor in Tucson and inform John, who was preparing for a third expedition to find his wife. On April 2, Larcena was taken to Tucson where she fully recovered under the care of Dr. C.B. Hughes. The young Mexican girl, Mercedes, was later found by the United States Army and traded for Apache prisoners at Fort Buchanan. She later married Charles A. Shibell and had four children, but died at age 26.

==Later life==

In 1861 the American Civil War was about to begin and Larcena was worried that the Apaches would turn more violent with the absence of military personnel. Larcena and her family soon moved to Patagonia. Due to the Bascom Affair, Chief Cochise and Mangas Coloradas were attacking American settlements all across southern New Mexico Territory. In March or April 1861, her husband, John, was ambushed and killed by Apache north of Tucson while transporting a wagon load of goods to Old Camp Grant. John was buried where he died, &quot;at the top of the hill beyond Samaniego&#x27;s ranch, on the old road; and all that Mrs. Page ever saw of him was his handkerchief, his purse and a lock of his hair.&quot; In the later part of August 1861, her brother, Jack, saved a fellow settler from Apaches during the Battle of Cookes Canyon.

In September 1861, Larcena gave birth to her daughter, Mary Ann, and shortly thereafter she moved again, to Tubac and later to a stone house along the Santa Cruz, about a half-mile from the international border with Mexico. The stone house was located in a dangerous area, frequented by Apaches, and at one point Larcena had to flee to Mowry, a small, fortified, mining town. Constantly moving, by April 1864 the Penningtons had returned to Tubac and were its only residents, as everyone else had fled during the Apache attack in 1861. Larcena&#x27;s young brothers carried very long guns, to protect the family from further attacks.

In 1867 Larcena&#x27;s sister died of malaria and in 1868 her brother, Jim Pennington, was killed during attacks against the Apache. In June 1869, her father and another brother were both murdered while working at a farm by Apaches. The remaining members of the Pennington family left for Tucson and then decided to move to California. About outside Tucson, they had to return when Larcena&#x27;s sister Ellen became gravely ill with pneumonia. Despite seeking medical help, Ellen died. Larcena and her brother were the only two remaining family members. Jack moved to Texas and Larcena decided to remain in Tucson.

=== Marries again ===

In August 1870, she married William Fisher Scott, a Scottish lawyer and judge. Larcena and William had two children, William P. (born September 1871) and Georgie Hazel (born October 6, 1872). Larcena refused to leave Arizona, despite all the hardships she went through there. Larcena became a Christian and was one of the first members of the Congregational Church in Tucson. She was also named president of the Arizona Historical Society. Larcena lived a relatively quiet life from then until her death.

==Legacy==
Pennington Street in downtown Tucson is named after Larcena Pennington and her family. Scott Avenue is named for her second husband William F. Scott. In the early 2000s, a residential community named Stone House was built southeast of Sahuarita, Arizona. It was named after the Penningtons&#x27; stone house along the Santa Cruz River.

<text>The Shanghai Conservatory of Music (SHCMusic) is a municipal public college in Shanghai, China. It is affiliated with the City of Shanghai and is part of the Double First-Class Construction. The college was founded on November 27, 1927.

==History==

The Shanghai Conservatory of Music is a music institute famous at home and abroad. It grew out of the National Conservatory of Music （&quot;Guoli yinyueyuan&quot; 国立音乐院）, which was established by Cai Yuanpei on November 27, 1927. Dr. Xiao Youmei (Shio Yiu-mei) was the director of the new school and curriculum. His teachings were based on the Leipzig Conservatory of Music, where he graduated. It was one of the first institutions of higher learning of modern music in China. It was considered the premiere institution for Western music learning. Professors came from as far as Russia and France. Several of the original professors were recruited from Russian emigres who had fled the Russian civil war (1918-1922) to China.

It was renamed several times: National Training School of Music (1929), Branch of National Conservatory of Music (1943), Shanghai National Training School of Music (1945), Shanghai and Huadong Branches of Chinese Conservatory of Music (early 1950s). It received its current name in 1956.

==Programs==

The Shanghai Conservatory of Music consists of 4 departments. It involves six disciplines and 23 sub-disciplines, some traditional, the others newly developed.

The conservatory supports a high-level music research institute, a specialized music library with a large collection, a first-class museum of Asian instruments, and a unique music publishing house.

A six-year secondary school and a three-year elementary section were established in 1953 and 1956 to prepare better candidates for tertiary education, thus forming a self-contained system with a complete curriculum of music and academic education.

Three art centers integrate teaching, performing and scientific research: Zhou Xiaoyan International Opera Center, International String Academy, and International Piano Art Center. The conservatory has established six performing groups: Symphony Orchestra of Shanghai Conservatory of Music, New Ensemble, String Quartet, Percussion Ensemble, National Music Orchestra and Choir.

Shanghai Conservatory of Music maintains close relationships with many first-class conservatories and famous musicians, including collaborations with schools in the US, France, UK, Russia, Netherlands, Australia, Austria, Germany and Japan. Many internationally well-known musicians such as Isaac Stern, Itzhak Perlman, Yuri Shishkin, Leon Fleisher, Pinchas Zukerman, Seiji Ozawa, Simon Rattle, Mstislav Rostropovich, and Yo-Yo Ma have served as honorary or guest professors.

<text>The University of Shanghai for Science and Technology (USST; ) is a municipal public university in Yangpu, Shanghai, China. The university is affiliated with the City of Shanghai and funded by the Shanghai Municipal People&#x27;s Government.

The school originated from the Hujiang University founded in 1906 and the German Medicine and Engineering School founded in 1907. In the early 1950s, the former Hujiang University and the former National Shanghai Advanced Mechanical Vocational School were respectively reorganized into Shanghai Institute of Mechanical Engineering (renamed East China University of Technology in 1994) and Shanghai Mechanical College. In 1996, the two schools merged to form University of Shanghai for Science and Technology. In 1998, the school was transferred from the former Ministry of Machinery Industry to the management of the Municipality of Shanghai.

==History==
===Origins===
The University of Shanghai for Science and Technology was originally built by the Northern and Southern Baptists of the United States on 26.5 acres of land purchased in late 1905. The first president of the college, originally known as the Shanghai Baptist College and Seminary, was John Thomas Proctor, a Baptist missionary appointed by the board of trustees in August 1906 during a meeting in Moganshan. Proctor was president and professor of history and philosophy at the college until the fall of 1910 when he was replaced by Dr. F. J. White as acting president. The first Chinese professor at the college was Mr. Tong Tsing-En. The first Chinese president was Dr. Herman C. E. Liu from 1928 to 1938.

===Development===

USST is the amalgamation of &quot;East China University of Technology&quot; and &quot;Shanghai Institute of Mechanical Technology&quot;. The former originated from &quot;Shanghai Industry School&quot;, set up on the original campus of Hujiang University (1906–1952) after the establishment of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The latter originated from &quot;Deutsche Medizinschule&quot;, created in 1907. Between 1960 and 1994, the school was known as &quot;Shanghai Institute of Mechanism&quot; (上海機械學院).In May 1996, East China University of Technology and Shanghai Institute of Mechanical Technology were amalgamated and established as USST.

<text>Beijing People&#x27;s Police College (BJPC) is a public university in Beijing, China.

The BJPC is a consolidated police training center, and the campus of the Capital Police for the greater Beijing area. The current location became a campus in September 2003. It is located in the Changping District of northwest Beijing, close to the Ming Tombs and the Badaling Great Wall.

The campus, covering an approximately two kilometer area, has a &quot;large crime scene simulation area, including simulated residential neighborhoods, stores, and banks&quot;. Additionally, the campus has DNA laboratories, lecture areas, and training facilities. It is the largest police college and training center in Asia.

To join the BJPC, recruits have to pass the national college entrance examination and pass the physical check and fitness test. The recruits need to be Beijing residents. Every year among thousands of the applicants, only around 600 are recruited. Male applicants are favored. For instance, a class of 40 students has only 6 women.

It is also the BPSB&#x27;s training center. It provides some short courses for special training.

== History ==

A &quot;Public Security Bureau Public School&quot; was first established in 1949. In 1966, it was closed along with many other educational institutions during the Cultural Revolution. In 1981, the school was reopened as the &quot;Beijing People&#x27;s Police School (BPPS)&quot;. Three years later, in 1984, the institution started to offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees, and then became the Beijing People&#x27;s Police College (BJPC).

Since 1984, and as of 2003, the institution has graduated approximately 40,000 people in police training programs, and 83,000 people with law enforcement degrees. In 2003, 7,411 people were registered as undergraduates, including 1,200 training for police certification, 794 receiving continuing police education, and 5,417 government employees were registered in certification programs (1,799) or bachelor&#x27;s degree programs (3,618) in law enforcement.

As of 2023, the BJPC has held training programs for police officers from at least 20 other countries.

<text>Peking Union Medical College, also as Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, is a national public medical sciences research institution in Dongcheng, Beijing, China. Originally founded in 1906, it is affiliated with the National Health Commission. The college is part of the Double First-Class Construction. The school operates the Peking Union Medical College Hospital and hosts a joint 8-year clinical medicine science degree program with Tsinghua University.

Peking Union Medical College students in the 8-year clinical medicine program could receive a Peking Union Medical College diploma and degree signed by both the Peking Union Medical College and Tsinghua presidents. It was merged with the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in 1957 and operates as one single institution with two names directly under the Ministry of Health, now the National Health Commission. It is the first medical school in China to introduce the 8-year MD program.

== History ==

The Peking Union Medical College Hospital was founded in 1906. The American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions, the Board of Foreign Missions of the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A., the London Missionary Society, and later, the Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and the Medical Missionary Association of London, together with the then-Chinese government cooperated in the foundation and development of the Medical College and maintained it until 1915. The Rockefeller Foundation was established in 1913 and in 1913-1914 the newly formed Foundation created a Commission, including Dr. Franklin C. McLean, to examine medical education in China. Dr Wu Lien-teh strongly supported the establishment of a new medical college in Peking and made a number of recommendations, all of which were adopted. One of its recommendations was that the Foundation - through a subsidiary organization - should assume financial responsibility for the college. On July 1, 1915, the recently established China Medical Board assumed full support of the Union Medical College, having previously acquired the property. The commission&#x27;s members had included both William Welch, the first Dean of the Johns Hopkins Medical School, and Simon Flexner. The China Medical Board modeled the school after Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine following the recommendations of the Flexner Report, which set the foundation of modern Medical Education in the United States and Canada. The PUMC was reorganized in 1917 and celebrated its 90th anniversary with a ceremony attended by the president of Johns Hopkins University, the chair of the China Medical Board and representatives of the Rockefeller family and Rockefeller Brothers Fund. John Black Grant, M.D., M.P.H. was a founding faculty member of PUMC and served from 1921 to 1938 as professor and chair of its Department of Public Health. Dr. Grant is the father of James P. Grant, the third executive director of UNICEF.

The PRC government nationalized PUMC, describing it as a Rockefeller Foundation-created symbol of U.S. cultural imperialism, in January 1951. The Ministry of Health began operating the school.

The Ministry of Health changed its name to China Union Medical College but did not radically alter the curriculum except to switch the language of instruction from English to Chinese. In 1952 the People&#x27;s Liberation Army took charge of operations and remained in charge until 1956. The curriculum was militarized and shortened to one year in order to train army medical officers, and Soviet models were introduced. The basic orientation to Western medicine was maintained and the staff continued to do research and advanced surgeries.

In 1956, autonomy was restored, but the college continued to be criticized for its elitism, cosmopolitanism, and failure to &quot;serve the people&quot; during periodic campaigns. During the Cultural Revolution, the Peking Union Medical College was closed, and the hospital was renamed the Beijing Anti-Imperialism Hospital (北京反帝醫院). In 1979, it reopened as the &quot;Capital University of Medical Sciences&quot; then returned to Peking Union Medical College (协和医科大学) in 1985.

== Current status==
Peking Union Medical College students traditionally attend Peking University biology department for their pre-meds portion of education. Since 2002, Tsinghua University has held a joint MD program in clinical medical science. Enrollment in the clinical medical science at PUMC is based on individual&#x27;s performance in high school and National Exam score at graduation. The curriculum of clinical medical science is 8 years, accepts about 90 students each year and includes 2.5 years of pre-medical education in the School of Life Sciences at Tsinghua University; the students have their pre-med studies at Tsinghua University and are considered as students of both PUMC and Tsinghua University. The college also has its independent Graduate School, which recruits from other medical schools around the country. The health care services at Peking Union Medical College Hospital are widely believed in mainland China to be among the most technically advanced. Many prominent political and social leaders in China have sought medical treatment at the PUMC Hospital.

Peking Union Medical College has provided generations of leaders for academic and clinical medicine and related areas all over the world.

Peking Union Medical College is part of the Project 211 list of universities receiving national funding.

== Rankings and reputation ==
Peking Union Medical College is listed as one of the top 350 universities in the World University Rankings.

<doc id="919953" wikidata="Q384862" url="?curid=919953" title="Toei Ōedo Line">
<text>The is a subway line in Tokyo, Japan, operated by the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation (Toei). It commenced full operations on December 12, 2000; using the Japanese calendar this reads &quot;12/12/12&quot; as the year 2000 equals Heisei 12. The line is completely underground, making it the second-longest railway tunnel in Japan after the Seikan Tunnel.

On maps and signboards, the line is shown in magenta. Stations carry the letter &quot;E&quot; followed by a two-digit number inside a more pinkish ruby circle.

==Overview==
The Ōedo Line is the first Tokyo subway line to use linear motor propulsion (and the second in Japan after the Osaka Metro Nagahori Tsurumi-ryokuchi Line), which allows it to use smaller cars and smaller tunnels (a benefit similarly achieved by the Advanced Rapid Transit system manufactured by Bombardier). This technology, though, is incompatible with other railway and subway lines, which can only operate with vehicles utilizing conventional rotary motors, thus preventing Ōedo Line trains from operating through services onto them. Although vehicles with rotary motor propulsion can technically operate on the Ōedo Line, its smaller tunnels and loading gauge prevents such occurrences, hence making the Ōedo Line the first self-enclosed subway line in Tokyo in over 40 years, and the first and to date only such line operated by Toei, although there is a track connection to the Asakusa Line that can only be used by Class E5000 locomotives.

The line is deep (as low as below ground at points) through central Tokyo, including three underground crossings of the Sumida River. Originally budgeted at ¥682.6 billion and 6 years, the construction ended up taking nearly 10 years and estimates of the final cost of construction range from the official ¥988.6 billion to over ¥1,400 billion yen, making it the most expensive subway line ever built at that point. However, Singapore&#x27;s Downtown MRT line stages 1–3 completed in 2017 are 2.84 times as expensive, at 33,669.5 compared to 11,571.8 US dollars per kilometer after adjusting for inflation and international price differences. In per-kilometer terms New York&#x27;s Second Avenue Subway Phase 1, also completed in 2017, is over 5.5 times costlier at 2,308.3 compared to 416.3 price-adjusted US dollars per kilometer.

Ridership projections originally estimated 1 million users daily, a figure scaled down to 820,000 before opening. At the end of 2006, the line was averaging 720,000 passengers/day. However, its ridership has increased by about five percent each year since its opening, following new commercial and residential development around major stations such as Roppongi and Shiodome. According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, as of June 2009 the Ōedo Line was the fourth most crowded subway line in Tokyo, at its peak running at 178% capacity between Monzen-Nakachō and Tsukishima stations.

There are plans to extend the Ōedo Line westward from its current western terminus at Hikarigaoka Station through to a new terminus in Ōizumigakuenchō, north of Ōizumi-gakuen Station (on the Seibu Ikebukuro Line) then later towards Higashi-Tokorozawa Station (on the Musashino Line). Construction of the first segment to Ōizumigakuenchō is tentatively scheduled for before 2015, and will include the construction of three new stations, temporarily named Doshida station, Ōizumichō station and Ōizumigakuenchō station. Following the awarding of the 2020 Summer Olympics to Tokyo, there has been speculation regarding the addition of another to the proposed extension in order to extend the line to Niiza where the shooting range for the Olympics is to be located. A decision regarding this matter is expected in 2015.

==Services==
The Ōedo Line runs in a loop around central Tokyo before branching out towards Nerima in the western suburbs, meaning the line is shaped like a figure &quot;6&quot; lying on its side. It is not a true loop line: trains from the western Hikarigaoka terminus run anticlockwise around the loop and terminate at the intermediate Tochōmae Station facing towards Hikarigaoka, and vice versa. The arrangement is very much like the London Underground Circle Line since 2009, but does not share any track segments with other lines.

The full trip from Tochōmae around the loop and onward to Hikarigaoka takes 81 minutes. Trains operate once every three to five minutes during rush hours, and once every six minutes during off-peak weekday hours, weekends and holidays.

==Noise complaints==

The Ōedo line is one of the noisiest train lines in the world, with decibel levels reaching 90 decibels frequently along the line. However, during the COVID-19 outbreak, noise levels have reached to over 105 decibels. The train line&#x27;s President states that infection is a more significant concern [than hearing damage], and therefore train&#x27;s windows are kept open to increase ventilation, which caused a number of complaints. As of April 2023, windows continue to be kept open to reduce the risks of Covid-19 transmission. The cause of the Ōedo line&#x27;s high noise levels lies in construction constraints such as preexisting infrastructure and the need to build deep tunnels, resulting in low-radius curves and small tunnels.

==Station list==

All stations are located in Tokyo.

Oedo Line trains are housed and maintained at the Kiba depot, located underneath Kiba Park to the southeast of Kiyosumi-Shirakawa Station. Prior to the completion of the Oedo Line loop in 2000, servicing was performed at a depot near Hikarigaoka Station.

Major overhaul work for Oedo Line trains is performed at the Magome depot, located south of Nishi-Magome Station on the Toei Asakusa Line. Oedo Line trains access this facility using a connecting tunnel to the Asakusa Line near Shiodome Station. Because of differences in infrastructure and technology used preventing trains on either line from accessing the other, a special Toei Class E5000 locomotive powers these ferry runs during overnight hours when the subway is closed.

==History==

The Ōedo Line was first proposed in 1968 as an incomplete loop line from Shinjuku around northern and eastern Tokyo to Azabu. This plan was amended in 1972 to complete the loop back to Shinjuku, extend it to Hikarigaoka and add a spur line to Mejiro from the northern side. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government undertook construction of the line, which was initially called .

The first segment from Hikarigaoka to Nerima began operations on 10 December 1991. The line was extended from Nerima to Shinjuku on 19 December 1997, and later from Shinjuku to Kokuritsu-Kyōgijō on 20 April 2000.

With this extension, Shintaro Ishihara, the governor of Tokyo, named the line &quot;Toei Oedo Line&quot;, where &quot;Oedo&quot; literally means &quot;Great Edo&quot;, a reference to Tokyo&#x27;s former name. As was the case with earlier lines, the public was initially polled to select a name; however, Ishihara rejected the chosen name, , on the grounds that it would not initially form a complete loop, and that calling it such would cause confusion with the Yamanote Line and the Osaka Loop Line.

The full line began operation on 12 December 2000. An additional station (Shiodome Station) was opened on 2 November 2002 to connect to the Yurikamome guideway transit line. Following the addition of Shiodome, the automated announcements in the trains were changed to advertise businesses and facilities near each station, a first in Tokyo (although this was already the practice on the municipal subways of Osaka and Nagoya).

=== Future plans ===
Starting on 18 January 2023, car 4 on all services on the Oedo line were designated as a women-only car in a bid by the railway operator to reduce sexual assaults onboard trains. The restriction is in effect during the morning peak hour.

<doc id="919955" wikidata="Q523831" url="?curid=919955" title="Bowsprit">
<text>The bowsprit of a sailing vessel is a spar extending forward from the vessel&#x27;s prow. The bowsprit is typically held down by a bobstay that counteracts the forces from the forestays. The bowsprit’s purpose is to create anchor points for the sails that extend beyond the vessel’s bow, increasing the size of sail that may be held taut.

The word &quot;bowsprit&quot; is thought to originate from the Middle Low German word &quot;bōchsprēt&quot; – &quot;bōch&quot; meaning &quot;bow&quot; and &quot;sprēt&quot; meaning &quot;pole&quot;.

On some square-rigged ships a spritsail is flown below the bowsprit; these are sometimes accompanied by a sprit topmast, which serves to assist the spritsail while tacking. The bowsprit may also be used to hold up the figurehead.

<text>Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute, or BEIST, is located at No. 7 Fufeng Road, Fengtai District, Beijing. It is a general institution of higher learning that trains professional and technical personnel in information security and office automation for party and government agencies. It is affiliated with the General Office of the Chinese Communist Party. The college is a major research institute of information security in China. It consists of five departments.

== History ==

=== Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute ===
The predecessor of Beijing Electronic Science and Technology Institute was the Youth Training Class of the Central Working Committee, which was established in Xibaipo, Pingshan County, Hebei Province in August 1947. In 1949, it was merged into the Engineering School of the People&#x27;s Revolutionary Military Commission of the Central People&#x27;s Government in Zhangjiakou. In June 1952, some departments were separated again and merged with the East China Military Region in Nanjing and the Third Field Army Youth Cadre School (established in March 1950) to form the Central People&#x27;s Government People&#x27;s Revolutionary Military Commission Confidential Cadre School (Nanjing Confidential Cadre School), which was under the jurisdiction of the Central People&#x27;s Government People&#x27;s Revolutionary Military Commission.Later it was changed to the Central People&#x27;s Government Committee Confidential Cadre School. In December 1954, it was changed to the First Confidential School of the Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army. In May 1955, it was changed to the First Confidential School of the State Council and was incorporated into the State Council. Later, the school moved to Beijing and was referred to as Beijing Jixue School. After that, it moved to Xuanhua, Hebei and was referred to as Xuanhua Jixue School.

In 1981, with the approval of the State Council, Beijing Electronic College was established in Xiaotangshan, Beijing.In the second half of 1983, the school moved to Banbidian, Beijing, and officially began to recruit college students. In 1992, with the approval of the State Education Commission, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications was established on the basis of Beijing Electronic College. It began to recruit undergraduate students and added correspondence education. In 1993, the General Office of the CCP Central Committee decided to merge Zhongnanhai Amateur University into Beijing University of Electronic Science and Technology. In February 1999, the college moved to the new campus in Fengtai, located in the Fengtai Park of Zhongguancun Science Park.

Since the establishment of the school, Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, Xi Jinping and other top leaders have written inscriptions. Among them, Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the CCP Central Committee, also wrote the name of the school. Qiao Shi, Wen Jiabao, Zeng Qinghong, Wang Gang, Li Zhanshu and other party and state leaders have given instructions for the development of the school and visited the school.

=== Zhongnanhai Amateur University ===
In the spring of 1948, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, established the Central Government Amateur School in Xibaipo, Pingshan County, Hebei Province. The central leadership at that time made a special study on this and decided that Liu Shaoqi, one of the five secretaries of the Secretariat of the Chinese Communist Party, would serve as the principal concurrently. Liu Huo from the Propaganda and Education Section would be in charge of the specific teaching work. The courses included political theory and cultural courses such as Chinese and mathematics. There were no full-time teachers, and cadres with high cultural and theoretical levels were hired to teach.

In 1949, the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party moved into Zhongnanhai in Beijing.The school&#x27;s teaching work was handed over to the Central Guard Bureau, which used the scattered and unused old bungalows in Zhongnanhai as classrooms and called it the Zhongnanhai Cultural School.After the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the number of units in Zhongnanhai increased, and the educational levels of the staff varied, so many courses and classes needed to be opened. The leaders transferred more than ten young people with university and college degrees from the graduates of the North China People&#x27;s Revolutionary University to teach. In 1953, there were more than 900 students. The principal was Wang Jingxian, secretary of the Party Branch of Mao Zedong&#x27;s Office and deputy director of the Central Security Bureau. The vice principal was Ma Da, chief of the Propaganda and Education Section of the Security Bureau. At that time, the school offered junior high school and elementary school cultural courses, plus crash courses in literacy, a total of 26 classes. Because the CCP Central Committee Directly Affiliated Organs Committee stipulated that all staff members who did not have a high school education must study at the school, all central directly affiliated organs working in Zhongnanhai, such as the General Office of the CCP Central Committee, the CCP Central Military Commission, the CCP Central Propaganda Department, the Security Bureau, the Secretariat, the Confidential Office, and other units, had staff members enrolled, with the Security Bureau having the largest number of staff members. The State Council and its system working in Zhongnanhai also had a large-scale part-time school, but the teaching location was not in Zhongnanhai.

By the end of the 1950s, half of the students in the school had reached the level of junior high school graduates and needed to go to high school. At this time, the school&#x27;s courses were reduced and the number of students dropped to more than 400.At that time, the Central Military Commission of the CCP and the CCP Propaganda Department moved out of Zhongnanhai, and the staff of other agencies in Zhongnanhai were reduced due to three rectification and reorganizations in 1955, 1957 and 1959The principal, Wang Jingxian, was often on business trips with Mao Zedong and had no time to take care of school affairs. The vice principal, Ma Da, had been transferred to Xinjiang for work. The director, deputy director and many teaching staff left one after another. There were only five teachers left, and they were unable to run a high school.

In early 1960, after Mao Zedong learned of the above situation, he instructed the leaders of the Security Bureau to run a truly comprehensive middle school: (1) It is necessary to attach importance to and do a good job in amateur cultural education, and have Wang Dongxing, the director, serve as the principal; (2) The number of teachers should be increased, and the amateur school should be run as a complete middle school. Like ordinary middle schools, ten courses should be offered: literature, history, geography, mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, physiology and hygiene, foreign languages, and politics. Foreign language courses must be offered, and history courses should be taught more; (3) After the middle school courses are completed, an amateur university should be run; (4) He himself would serve as the honorary principal and personally review and approve the annual teaching plan and summary. He also sent his secretary Hu Qiaomu to the school to study the teaching methods of classical literature with the teachers. At that time, the school had moved from the Siheyuan opposite Huairen Hall to Zhengshi Hall on the South China Sea, very close to Mao Zedong&#x27;s residence.

In order to implement Mao Zedong&#x27;s instructions, four teachers were transferred to the agency to add three high school courses, and two part-time teachers were hired to open a university history class (taught by a teacher from Peking University) and a general English class (taught by Sun Shoumin, a cadre from the Security Bureau Office).

The Cultural Revolution impacted the cultural and educational work of Zhongnanhai, and the school was closed. After the 3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in 1978, Hu Yaobang initiated the restoration of the school. In 1981, the Zhongnanhai Cultural Tutorial School was officially established to provide high school courses for those who had not graduated from high school. In 1983, Zhongnanhai Amateur University was established, with a secretarial department and other subjects. On the eve of the graduation ceremony of the first batch of students in 1985, Hu Yaobang wrote the name of the school for the school.

In 1988, Zhongnanhai Amateur University participated in the establishment of Capital United Workers University.In 1993, the school became independent from the Capital United Workers University and was restored as the Zhongnanhai Amateur University.In 1993, the General Office of the CCP Central Committee decided to merge Zhongnanhai Amateur University into Beijing Institute of Electronic Science and Technology. In 2007, Zhongnanhai Amateur University was given a red card warning by the Ministry of Education and was not allowed to enroll students. As of September 30, 2021, according to the Ministry of Education website, Zhongnanhai Amateur University is still on the list of adult higher education institutions.

<text>China Foreign Affairs University (CFAU; ) is a public university of foreign service in Beijing, China. It is affiliated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The institute is part of the Double First-Class Construction.

Since its foundation, there have been over 300 ambassadors and thousands of senior diplomats among the alumni of CFAU, gaining the university a reputation as &quot;the cradle of Chinese diplomats&quot;. At present, CFAU has two campuses. The first began operating in 1956; the second one came into service in 2012.

The university maintains two campuses in Beijing: the newer Zhanlanguan Rd Campus () in Xicheng and the original Shahe Campus () in Changping.

== History ==
China Foreign Affairs University was founded in 1955 with the advice of then-Premier Zhou Enlai, and is affiliated with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (the university is not to be confused with the University of International Relations, also in Beijing). The predecessor of CFAU was the Department of Diplomacy of Renmin University of China. Vice Premier and Foreign Minister of China Chen Yi was the president of the university from 1961 to 1969. The University was forced to close during the years of Cultural Revolution. It was reopened in 1980 under the auspices of Deng Xiaoping. Most of the former presidents of CFAU are ambassadors. The current president is Wan Fan (), specialist in international relations, and its party secretary is Qi Dayu. Before 2005, the university was called the Foreign Affairs College in English.

== Academic ==
The courses of study offered include foreign languages (English, French and Japanese), foreign policy, international politics and relations and diplomacy, international law and economics. The university awards bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees.

China Foreign Affairs University also holds short-term courses for Chinese civil servants and for foreign diplomats. For example, in 2005, it has trained diplomats for the new governments created after the U.S. invasion of Afghanistan and Iraq for one month each.

== Model United Nations ==
Model United Nations (MUN) is the most renowned student activity of CFAU. On June 3, 1995, CFAU organized the 1st Model United Nations Conference. It was the first of its kind held in China and attended by Chinese students.

In 2002, together with UN Association of China, CFAU organized the 1st Beijing Model United Nations Conference (BMUN. Its name changed into Beijing International Model United Nations (BIMUN) since 2017). It was the first inter-university MUN in China and was later listed as one of the three most prestigious university MUNs.

In 2004, CFAU again cooperated with UN Association of China and hosted the 1st China Model United Nations Conference (CNMUN).

== Praise and criticism ==
* On July 1, 2008, then UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon praised CFAU as &quot;the cradle of Chinese diplomacy; an institution that has firmly established itself as an authoritative forum in active and inter-active discussions on issues concerning China and its expanding role in the international community&quot; in his address given at the university.
* Former French President Jacques Chirac on April 29, 2009 called CFAU &quot;the institute of higher education which cultivates top talents for Chinese diplomacy.&quot; 
* US Ambassador to China Gary Faye Locke celebrated CFAU as &quot;China&#x27;s incubator of diplomatic talent&quot; at the Opening Ceremony of U.S.-China Joint Training Program for Afghan Diplomats at CFAU.

In recent years, CFAU has been criticized for putting too much emphasis on the study of foreign languages at the cost of diplomatic training and education, and some consider many Chinese foreign affairs personnel no more than translators or interpreters.

== Fund scandal ==
In 2013, during a thorough investigation by the National Audit Office of the PRC, noncompliance was discovered in the procurement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, involving more than 52 million RMB. Among them, about 38 million RMB was associated with the construction of CFAU&#x27;s new campus in Shahe.

== Rivalry ==
CFAU has produced an array of senior diplomatic officials and proudly claims itself as &quot;the cradle of Chinese diplomats&quot;. However, having trained hundreds of Chinese ambassadors, Beijing Foreign Studies University (BFSU) also considers itself &quot;the cradle of PRC diplomats&quot;. Rivalry between students of the two universities continue to present day.
