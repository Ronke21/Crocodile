<text>The Battle of Carrhae () was fought in 53 BC between the Roman Republic and the Parthian Empire near the ancient town of Carrhae (present-day Harran, Turkey). An invading force of seven legions of Roman heavy infantry under Marcus Licinius Crassus was lured into the desert and decisively defeated by a mixed cavalry army of heavy cataphracts and light horse archers led by the Parthian general Surena. On such flat terrain, the Legion proved to have no viable tactics against the highly mobile Parthian horsemen, and the slow and vulnerable Roman formations were surrounded, exhausted by constant attacks, and eventually crushed. Crassus was killed along with the majority of his army. It is commonly seen as one of the earliest and most important battles between the Roman and Parthian Empires and one of the most crushing defeats in Roman history. According to the poet Ovid in Book 6 of his poem &quot;Fasti&quot;, the battle occurred on 9 June.

Crassus, a member of the First Triumvirate and the wealthiest man in Rome, had been enticed by the prospect of military glory and riches and decided to invade Parthia without the official consent of the Senate. Rejecting an offer from the Armenian King Artavasdes II to allow Crassus to invade Parthia via Armenia, Crassus marched his army directly through the deserts of Mesopotamia. His forces clashed with Surena&#x27;s troops near Carrhae. Surena&#x27;s cavalry killed or captured most of the Roman soldiers. Crassus himself was killed when truce negotiations turned violent.

His death ended the First Triumvirate. The following four-year period of peace between the remaining two members of the Triumvirate, Julius Caesar and Pompey, argues against the view that Crassus had been a peacekeeper within the group and supports the views of most Roman historians that friction between Crassus and Pompey had always been a greater cause of tension than that between Caesar and Pompey. 

==Background==
=== Triumvirate ===
The war against Parthia resulted from political arrangements intended to be mutually beneficial for Marcus Licinius Crassus, Pompeius Magnus, and Julius Caesar, the so-called First Triumvirate. In March and April 56 BC, meetings were held at Ravenna and Luca, in Caesar&#x27;s province of Cisalpine Gaul, to reaffirm the weakening alliance formed four years earlier. It was agreed that the Triumvirate would marshal its supporters and resources to secure legislation for prolonging Caesar&#x27;s Gallic command and to influence the upcoming elections for 55 BC, with the objective of a second joint consulship for Crassus and Pompey. The Triumvirate aimed to expand their faction&#x27;s power by traditional means: military commands, placing political allies in office and advancing legislation to promote their interests. Pressure in various forms was brought to bear on the elections: money, influence from patronage and friendship and the force of 1000 troopers brought from Gaul by Crassus&#x27;s son Publius. The faction secured the consulship and most of the other offices that were sought. Legislation passed by the tribune Trebonius (the &quot;Lex Trebonia&quot;) granted extended proconsulships of five years, matching that of Caesar in Gaul, to the two outgoing consuls. The Spanish provinces would go to Pompey. Crassus arranged to have Syria with the transparent intention of going to war with Parthia.

=== Developments in Parthia ===
Meanwhile, in Parthia, a war of succession had broken out in 57 BC after King Phraates III had been killed by his sons Orodes II and Mithridates IV, who then began fighting each other over the throne. In the first stage, Orodes emerged victorious and appointed his brother as king of Media (his &quot;de facto&quot; governor) as a compromise. However, another armed clash made Orodes force Mithridates to flee to Aulus Gabinius, the Roman proconsul of Syria. Gabinius sought to interfere in the succession dispute on behalf of Mithridates so that Rome could make him its puppet king and seize control of Parthia in the process. However, Gabinius abandoned his plans and opted to intervene in Ptolemaic Egyptian affairs instead.

Mithridates proceeded to invade Babylonia on his own with some initial success but was soon confronted by the army of the Parthian commander Surena.

Gabinius&#x27;s successor, Crassus, also sought to ally himself with Mithridates and invaded Parthia&#x27;s client-state Osroene in 54 BC but wasted most of his time in waiting for reinforcements on the Balikh River&#x27;s left bank while Surena besieged, defeated and executed Mithridates in Seleucia on the Tigris. Orodes, now unopposed in his own realm, marched north to invade Rome&#x27;s ally Armenia, where King Artavasdes II soon defected to the Parthian side.

=== Crassus&#x27;s preparations ===
The notoriously wealthy Marcus Crassus was around 62 when he embarked on the Parthian invasion. Greed is often regarded by the ancient sources, particularly his biographer Plutarch, as his major character fault and his motive for going to war. The historian Erich S. Gruen believed that Crassus&#x27;s purpose was to enrich the public treasury since personal wealth was not what Crassus most lacked. Most modern historians tend to view insatiable greed, envy of Pompey&#x27;s military exploits and rivalry as his motivations since his long-faded military reputation had always been inferior to that of Pompey and, after five years of war in Gaul, to that of Caesar. His major military achievements had been the defeat of Spartacus in 71 BC and his victory at the Battle of the Colline Gate for Sulla a decade earlier. Plutarch noted that Caesar wrote to Crassus from Gaul and endorsed the plan to invade Parthia, an indication that he regarded Crassus&#x27;s military campaign as complementary and not merely rivalrous to his own.

Another factor in Crassus&#x27;s decision to invade Parthia was the expected ease of the campaign. The Roman legions had easily crushed the numerically superior armies of other eastern powers such as Pontus and Armenia, and Crassus expected Parthia to be an easy target.

Cicero, however, suggested an additional factor: the ambitions of Marcus&#x27;s son, the talented Publius Crassus, who had commanded successful campaigns in Gaul under Caesar. Upon his return to Rome as a highly decorated officer, Publius took steps to establish his own political career. Roman sources view the Battle of Carrhae not only as a calamity for Rome and a disgrace for Marcus Crassus but also as a tragedy that cut short Publius Crassus&#x27;s promising career.

Some Romans objected to the war against Parthia. Cicero calls it a war &quot;nulla causa&quot; (&quot;with no justification&quot;) on the grounds that Parthia had a treaty with Rome. The tribune Ateius Capito put up strenuous opposition and infamously conducted a public ritual of execration as Crassus prepared to depart.

Despite protests and dire omens, Marcus Crassus left Rome on November 14, 55 BC. Publius Crassus joined him in Syria during the winter of 54–53 BC and brought with him the thousand Celtic cavalry troopers from Gaul who remained loyal to their young leader until their death.

==Invasion of Parthia==

Crassus arrived in Syria in late 55 BC and immediately set about using his immense wealth to raise an army. According to Plutarch, he assembled a force of seven legions for a total of about 28,000 to 35,000 heavy infantry. He also had about 4,000 light infantry, and 4,000 cavalry, including the 1000-strong Gallic cavalry that Publius had brought with him. With the aid of Hellenic settlements in Syria and the support of about 6,000 cavalry from Artavasdes, the Armenian king, Crassus marched on Parthia. Artavasdes advised him to take a route through Armenia to avoid the desert and offered him reinforcements of a further 10,000 cavalry and 30,000 infantry.

Crassus refused the offer and decided to take the direct route through Mesopotamia and to capture the great cities in the region. In response, the Parthian king, , divided his army and took most of the soldiers, mainly foot archers with a small amount of cavalry, to punish the Armenians himself. He sent the rest of his forces, an all-cavalry force under the command of &quot;spahbod&quot; Surena, to scout out and harass Crassus&#x27;s army. Orodes did not anticipate that Surena&#x27;s heavily outnumbered force would be able to defeat Crassus and merely wanted to delay him. Plutarch described Surena&#x27;s force as &quot;a thousand mail-clad horsemen and a still greater number of light-armed cavalry&quot;. Including slaves and vassals, Surena&#x27;s expedition numbered ten thousand in total, supported by a baggage train of one thousand camels.

Crassus received directions from the Osroene chieftain Ariamnes, who had assisted Pompey in his eastern campaigns. Crassus trusted Ariamnes, who, however, was in the pay of the Parthians. He urged Crassus to attack at once and falsely stated that the Parthians were weak and disorganized. He then led Crassus&#x27;s army into the most desolate part of the desert, far from any water. Crassus then received a message from Artavasdes that claimed that the main Parthian army was in Armenia, and the letter begged him for help. Crassus ignored the message and continued his advance into Mesopotamia. He encountered Surena&#x27;s army near the town of Carrhae.

== Battle ==

After being informed of the presence of the Parthian army (which numbered roughly 10,000), Crassus&#x27;s army panicked. Crassus&#x27; commanding general, Cassius, recommended that the army be deployed in the traditional Roman fashion, with infantry forming the centre and cavalry on the wings. At first, Crassus agreed, but he soon changed his mind and redeployed his men into a hollow square, each side formed by twelve cohorts. That formation would protect his forces from being outflanked but at the cost of mobility. The Roman forces advanced and came to a stream. Crassus&#x27;s generals advised him to make camp and to attack the next morning to give his men a chance to rest. Publius, however, was eager to fight and managed to convince Crassus to confront the Parthians immediately.

The Parthians went to great lengths to intimidate the Romans. Firstly, they beat a great number of hollow drums and the Roman troops were unsettled by the loud and cacophonous noise. Surena then ordered his cataphracts to cover their armour in cloths and advance. When they were within sight of the Romans, they simultaneously dropped the cloths and revealed their shining armour. The sight was designed to intimidate the Romans.

Though Surena had originally planned to shatter the Roman lines with a charge by his cataphracts, he judged that it would not yet be enough to break them. Thus, he sent his horse archers to surround the Roman square. Crassus sent his skirmishers to drive the horse archers off, but they were driven back by the latter&#x27;s arrows. The horse archers then engaged the legionaries. The legionaries were protected by their large shields (&quot;scuta&quot;) and armour, but they could not cover the entire body. Some historians describe the arrows partially penetrating the Roman shields and nailing the shields to the limbs of the Roman infantry and nailing their feet to the ground. However, Plutarch wrote in his accounts that the Romans were met with a shower of arrows that passed through every kind of cover, hard and soft alike. Other historians state that most wounds inflicted were nonfatal hits to exposed limbs.

The Romans repeatedly advanced towards the Parthians to attempt to engage in close-quarters fighting, but the horse archers were always able to retreat safely and loosed Parthian shots as they withdrew. The legionaries then formed the testudo formation by locking their shields together to present a nearly-impenetrable front to missiles. However, that formation severely restricted their ability in melee combat. The Parthian cataphracts exploited that weakness and repeatedly charged the Roman line, which caused panic and inflicted heavy casualties. When the Romans tried to loosen their formation to repel the cataphracts, the latter rapidly retreated, and the horse archers resumed shooting at the legionaries, who were now more exposed.

Crassus now hoped that his legionaries could hold out until the Parthians ran out of arrows. However, Surena used thousands of camels to resupply his horse archers. Upon this realisation, Crassus dispatched his son Publius with 1,300 Gallic cavalry, 500 archers and eight cohorts of legionaries to drive off the horse archers. The horse archers feigned retreat and drew off Publius&#x27; force, which suffered heavy casualties from arrow fire.

Once Publius and his men were sufficiently separated from the rest of the army, the Parthian cataphracts confronted them while the horse archers cut off their retreat. In the ensuing combat, the Gauls fought bravely, but their inferiority in weapons and armor was evident. They eventually retreated to a hill, where Publius committed suicide while the rest of his men were slaughtered, with only 500 being taken alive.

Crassus, unaware of his son&#x27;s fate but realising that Publius was in danger, ordered a general advance. He was confronted with the sight of his son&#x27;s head on a spear. The Parthian horse archers began to surround the Roman infantry and shot at them from all directions. Meanwhile, the cataphracts mounted a series of charges that disorganised the Romans.

The Parthian onslaught did not cease until nightfall. Crassus, deeply shaken by his son&#x27;s death, ordered a retreat to the nearby town of Carrhae and left behind 4000 wounded, who were killed by the Parthians the next morning.

Four Roman cohorts got lost in the dark and were surrounded on a hill by the Parthians, with only 20 Romans surviving.

The next day, Surena sent a message to the Romans and offered to negotiate with Crassus. Surena proposed a truce to allow the Roman army to return to Syria safely in exchange for Rome giving up all territory east of the Euphrates. Surena either sent an embassy to the Romans by the hills or went himself to state he wanted a peace conference on an evacuation.

Crassus was reluctant to meet with the Parthians, but his troops threatened to mutiny otherwise. At the meeting, a Parthian pulled at Crassus&#x27;s reins and sparked violence in which Crassus and his generals were killed.

After his death, the Parthians allegedly poured molten gold down his throat in a symbolic gesture mocking Crassus&#x27;s renowned greed. Plutarch reports that Crassus&#x27; severed head was then used as a prop for part of a play, Euripides&#x27; Bacchae, performed at a banquet before the king. The remaining Romans at Carrhae attempted to flee, but most were captured or killed. According to the ancient historian Plutarch, Roman casualties amounted to about 20,000 killed and 10,000 captured, which made the battle one of the costliest defeats in Roman history. Parthian casualties were minimal.

== Aftermath ==

Rome was humiliated by this defeat, which was made even worse by the fact that the Parthians had captured several Legionary Eagles. It is also mentioned by Plutarch that the Parthians found the Roman prisoner-of-war who most resembled Crassus, dressed him as a woman, and paraded him through Parthia for all to see. This was a direct attack on Roman military culture, as the Parthians ordered the other Roman prisoners to hail this false Crassus as Imperator while on parade, a direct mockery of a Roman triumph.

, with the rest of the Parthian Army, defeated the Armenians and captured their country. However, Surena&#x27;s victory invoked the jealousy of the Parthian king, who ordered Surena&#x27;s execution. Following Surena&#x27;s death, sent his son Pacorus on an unsuccessful military campaign into Roman Syria.

The Battle of Carrhae was one of the first major battles between the Romans and Parthians. It was the victory that led Parthia to invade Syria and Armenia several times, with varying successes. Rome also realised that its legionaries could not effectively fight against Parthian cavalry unsupported in open terrain.

Gaius Cassius Longinus, a quaestor under Crassus, led approximately 10,000 surviving soldiers from the battlefield back to Syria. He continued to govern the province as a proquaestor for two more years, successfully defending it from further attacks by Orodes&#x27; son Pacorus. Cassius managed to resist the Parthian siege of his capital Antioch, and when Pacorus&#x27; army retreated home he ambushed them at Antigonea, leading to the death of the Parthian second-in-command Osaces. He received praise from Cicero for his victory. Cassius later played a key role in the conspiracy to assassinate Julius Caesar in 44 BC.

=== Prisoners ===

The 10,000 Roman prisoners of war appear to have been deported to Alexandria Margiana (Merv) near the Parthian Empire&#x27;s northeastern border in 53 BC, where they reportedly married local people.

In the 1940s, Homer H. Dubs, an American professor of Chinese history at the University of Oxford, hypothesized that the people of Liqian were descended from these prisoners. The prisoners, Dubs proposed, were resettled by the Parthians on their eastern border and may have fought as mercenaries at the Battle of Zhizhi between the Chinese and the Xiongnu in 36 BC. Chinese chroniclers mention the use of a &quot;fish-scale formation&quot; of soldiers as well as a double wooden palisade structure, which Dubs believed referred to the testudo formation and a defensive tactic that was unique to the Romans. To date, no artifacts that might confirm a Roman presence, such as coins or weaponry, have been discovered in Zhelaizhai, and Dubs&#x27; theories have not been accepted by the vast majority of historians. 

Rob Gifford, commenting on the theory, described it as one of many &quot;rural myths&quot;. Alfred Duggan used the possible fate of the Roman prisoners as the kernel of his novel &quot;Winter Quarters&quot;, which suggested that they were employed as frontier guards on the eastern border of the Parthian Empire.

== Legacy ==

The capture of the golden &quot;aquilae&quot; (legionary battle standards) by the Parthians was considered a grave moral defeat and evil omen for the Romans. When he was assassinated, Caesar was planning a retaliatory war. It was said that there would have been harsh retribution if Caesar won because the surviving son of Crassus would be among the Roman forces.

However, the fall of the Roman Republic intervened, and the beginning of imperial monarchy at Rome followed. Sulla&#x27;s first march on Rome in 88 BC had begun the collapse of the republican form of government, but the death of Crassus and the loss of his legions utterly reconfigured the balance of power at Rome. An old theory ran that the death of Crassus, along with the death of Julia in 54, Pompey&#x27;s wife and Caesar&#x27;s daughter, may have severed the ties between Caesar and Pompey, and the First Triumvirate no longer existed. As a result, civil war broke out. Caesar won, and the Republic quickly became a dictatorship.

Several historians note the lapse of time between Crassus&#x27;s death and the outbreak of civil war. Gaius Stern has claimed that the death nearly cut the links the First Triumvirate enjoyed with the blue-blooded aristocracy, leaving the entire state vulnerable to the friction that eventually turned into civil war. Thus, an immediate effect of the battle may have been the elimination of certain private checks and balances (such as Crassus&#x27;s relationship to Metellus Pius Scipio) that had kept a lid on political tensions.

In a regional context, however, the battle had little negative impact for Rome in the long-term as the following retaliatory invasion of Rome by Parthia in 40 BC was stopped and repulsed by Publius Ventidius Bassus, and it did not prevent an invasion of Parthia by Mark Anthony in 36 BC (although this campaign ended in failure as well).

<doc id="925499" wikidata="Q2354078" url="?curid=925499" title="Elections in Indonesia">
<text>Elections in Indonesia have taken place since 1955 to elect a legislature. At a national level, Indonesian people did not elect a head of state – the president – until 2004. Since then, the president is elected for a five-year term, as are the 580-member People&#x27;s Representative Council (, DPR), the 152-seat Regional Representative Council (&quot;Dewan Perwakilan Daerah&quot;) in 2024 general election, in addition to provincial and municipal legislative councils.

Members of the People&#x27;s Representative Council are elected by proportional representation from multi-candidate constituencies. Currently, there are 77 constituencies in Indonesia, and each returns 3-10 Members of Parliament based on population. Under Indonesia&#x27;s multi-party system, no one party has yet been able to secure an outright majority in a democratic election; parties have needed to work together in coalition governments. Members of the Regional Representative Council are elected by single non-transferable vote. There, Indonesia&#x27;s 34 provinces treated as constituencies and, regardless of the size and population, every province return four senators.

Starting from the 2015 unified local elections, Indonesia started to elect governors and mayors simultaneously on the same date.

The voting age in Indonesia is 17, but anyone who has an ID card (KTP) can vote since persons under 17 who are or were married can get a KTP. Elections are conducted by the General Elections Commission (KPU) and supervised by the General Election Supervisory Agency (Bawaslu); their activities were overseen by Elections Organizer Honorary Council (DKPP).

==Electoral principles==
Indonesian election conduct abides by six principles of direct, general, free, confidential, honest, and fair. Those principles are abbreviated and commonly propagated as &quot;Luber-jurdil&quot;. The first four principles of &quot;Luber&quot; are adopted by the New Order regime from the 1971 election. After the 1998 reform and the following political liberalisation, two extra principles of &quot;Jurdil&quot; are adopted for the first time in the 1999 election.

*Direct (&quot;langsung&quot;): Voters shall vote on their own without any intermediary.
*General (&quot;umum&quot;): All Indonesians that already satisfy voters&#x27; criteria, shall be able to vote without any restriction.
*Free (&quot;bebas&quot;): Voters shall be able to vote by their own conscience without any coercion to vote for a particular candidate.
*Confidential (&quot;rahasia&quot;): Secret ballot are guaranteed, and voters&#x27; choice shall not be known to others but themselves.
*Honest (&quot;jujur&quot;): Voters, candidates, and electoral institutions shall perform their duty in complete honesty.
*Fair (&quot;adil&quot;): Voters and candidates shall receive equal treatment by the law, with no particular voters or candidates shall receive preferential or discriminatory treatment.

The voters vote on the election ballot by punching a hole using a provided nail. For legislative ballots, punching can be done in one of the party logo, ballot number, or candidates&#x27; name. For presidential, gubernatorial, mayoral, and regent elections, punching can be done in one of the candidates&#x27; photograph, ballot number, or name. Ticking method was previously used started in 2009 elections, but it was reverted in 2014 elections.

==History==
Elections were first promised for January 1946 by vice-president Hatta on 3 November 1945, a promise repeated later the same month by Prime Minister Sjahrir and senior minister Amir Sjarifuddin in response to criticism of the cabinet for being non-democratic. They were never held, partly because the Indonesian National Revolution was still ongoing and the Republic only controlled Java, Sumatra and a few other areas, and partly because the socialist government was extremely unpopular due to its policy of negotiating with the Dutch colonial power, and would be expected to do very badly in any election. However, there were regional elections in Bali, Solo and Kediri.

===Early elections (1955)===

Indonesia&#x27;s first general election elected members of the DPR and the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia (&quot;Konstituante&quot;). The election was organised by the government of Prime Minister Ali Sastroamidjojo. Sastroamidjojo himself declined to stand for election, and Burhanuddin Harahap became prime minister.

The election occurred in two stages:
*The election of the members of the DPR, which took place on 29 September 1955. Twenty-nine political parties and individuals took part;
*The election for the members of the Constitutional Assembly, which took place on 15 December 1955.

The five largest parties in the election were the National Party of Indonesia (PNI), Council of Indonesian Muslim Associations Party (Masyumi), Nahdlatul Ulama (NU), Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), and Indonesian Islamic Union Party (PSII).

===Elections under the New Order (1971–1997)===
Most elections during the New Order were conducted by General Elections Institution (LPU), as of 1997 election, it was led by Minister of Home Affairs.

====First election (1971)====

The first election after the establishment of Suharto&#x27;s New Order took place on 5 July 1971. Ten political parties participated.

The five largest political parties were a newly-participate &quot;functional group&quot; Golkar, Nahdlatul Ulama, Muslim Party of Indonesia (Parmusi), PNI and PSII.

====Further elections (1977–1997)====

Five further legislative elections were held under Suharto administration. In accordance with the legislation, these were contested by two parties: United Development Party (PPP) and Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI); as well as Golkar. All elections in this period were won by Golkar.

On every March after the legislative election, the MPR would hold General Sessions (&quot;Sidang Umum MPR&quot;) in which included the election of president and soon after, the vice president; as mandated by the original constitution. On all occasions, Suharto was the only person ever stood as a presidential candidate, thus enabling him to be elected unanimously. On vice-presidential elections, all candidates endorsed by Golkar (and the military faction) went on to be elected unanimously.

To ensure that Golkar always won more than 60% of the popular vote, the New Order regime used a number of tactics. These included:

*Reducing the number of opponents: In 1973, the existing political parties were forced to merge into either PPP or PDI. These were the only parties allowed to contest general elections.
*Weakening the remaining opponents: The two political parties were forbidden to criticise government policy, and the government had to approve all slogans they used. Furthermore, they were not allowed to organise at the village level (where the majority of Indonesians live). To stop the rise of charismatic figures, their candidates had to be vetted by the government. When a potentially charismatic figure (in the form of founding president Sukarno&#x27;s daughter Megawati Sukarnoputri) became a leader of the PDI, the government engineered a political convention in Medan in 1996 to remove her. Ironically, the ensuing disturbances at the PDI&#x27;s Jakarta headquarters began a chain of events that indirectly led to the downfall of the New Order.
*Coercion to vote Golkar: Civil servants and state- and regional-owned enterprises employees were compulsorily members of the Golkar-linked Employees&#x27; Corps of the Republic of Indonesia (KORPRI) and hence ordered to support Golkar, or face accusations of insubordination and even forced relocation to a remote region. Private sector workers were reminded of the need for &quot;stability&quot;. Many people believed the vote was not secret, and the government did little to persuade them otherwise. Many voters were still at school, and they were warned by teachers of a link between their choice at the ballot box and exam success 
*The vote-counting process: The Golkar votes were counted first, then those of the two other parties. In the 1997 election, by 9 p.m. on the day after voting, Golkar had already been awarded 94% of its eventual vote. By contrast, the PPP had been credited with less than 10% of its final tally.
*Vote-rigging: Although the counting at the local ballot boxes was conducted in public, with the ballot papers held up and the scores marked on boards, it was at the later stages where irregularities were frequently reported.
*Multiple voting: There was no effective way of determining who had already voted, allowing many to do so more than once 

===Election in the reform era (1999–present)===
The 1999 election was the first election held after the collapse of the New Order. It was held on 7 June 1999 under the government of B.J. Habibie. Forty-eight political parties participated.

The six largest parties which passed the electoral threshold of 2% were the Indonesian Democratic Party-Struggle (PDI-P), the reformed Golkar Party, PPP, National Awakening Party (PKB), National Mandate Party (PAN), and Crescent Star Party (PBB).

Under the constitution, the new president was elected by members of the all-house MPR in a joint sitting. This meant that although PDI-P won the largest share of the popular vote, the new president was not its nominee, Megawati Sukarnoputri, but Abdurrahman Wahid of PKB. Megawati then became vice president.

During its 2002 annual session, the MPR added 14 amendments to the 1945 Constitution. Included in these amendments were measures to reorganise the Indonesian legislature. Beginning in 2004, the MPR would be composed of the existing DPR and a new Regional Representative Council (DPD). Because all the seats in the MPR would be directly elected, this called for the removal of the military from the legislature, whose 38 seats for the 1999–2004 period were all appointed. This change and an amendment for direct election of the President and Vice-President were significant steps for Indonesia on the road towards full democracy.

The 2004 legislative election was held on 5 April 2004. A total of 24 parties contested the election. Golkar Party won the largest share of the vote, at 21.6%, followed by PDI-P, PKB, PPP and newly formed Democratic Party. 17 parties won legislative seats.

In 2005, Indonesia also began holding direct elections for governors, mayors and regents. Prior to this, local executives had been elected by a vote of the local legislative body. The first region to do so was Kutai Kartanegara, which held a regency election on 1 June 2005.

====2009 legislative and presidential elections====

Legislative elections for the DPD and the DPR were held in Indonesia on 9 April 2009. The presidential election was held on 8 July, with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono winning enough of the vote to make the run-off election unnecessary.

====2014 legislative and presidential elections====

Legislative elections for the DPD and the DPR were held in Indonesia on 9 April 2014. The presidential election was held on 9 July 2014, with Joko Widodo, then the Governor of Jakarta winning the election against Prabowo Subianto, a former general in Indonesia.

====2019 legislative and presidential elections====
In 2019, for the first time, legislative and presidential elections were held on the same day. Joko Widodo, running with Ma’ruf Amin as his vice-presidential candidate, again defeated Prabowo Subianto, running with Sandiaga Uno, winning 55.4% of the vote. In the legislative vote, PDI-P came first, with 19.3% of the vote, followed by Prabowo&#x27;s Gerindra Party with 12.6% .

==== 2024 legislative and presidential elections ====
In 2024, legislative and presidential elections were held on the same day. Prabowo Subianto, with Gibran Rakabuming Raka as his vice-president, defeated both Anies Baswedan, running with Muhaimin Iskandar (24.94%), and also Ganjar Pranowo, running with Mahfud MD (16,4%), winning 58.5% of the vote. On March 20, the KPU certified the results and declared him as the president-elect of Indonesia. Constitutional Court confirmed his status on 22 April 2024. The replacement of the president will be held on 20 October 2024. As for the legislative elections, PDI-P came first, winning 16.7% of the vote, followed by the Golkar Party with 15.2%.

==Voter registration==

==Criticism==
Vote buying is common in Indonesia. In Indonesian, vote-buying is often known as &quot;politik uang&quot; (&#x27;money politics&#x27;). According to a survey of 440 respondents by Institut Riset Indonesia in January–March 2020 in areas where local elections were to be held in 2020, 60% of respondents said that they would allow their vote to be bought. Reasons for accepting vote buying include considering it as a gift that can not be rejected (35–46%), compensation for not working on the election day (25–30%), and supporting daily needs (9–16%). One of the common tactics of vote-buying is the so-called &quot;serangan fajar&quot; (&#x27;dawn attack&#x27;), which involves the giving of money a day or two before the election day. The amount ranges from Rp30,000 to Rp50,000. According to Burhanuddin Muhtadi in his book &quot;Kuasa Uang; Politik Uang dalam Pemilu Pasca-Orde Baru&quot; (The Power of Money; Money Politics in the Post-New Order Elections), vote-buying in Indonesia is done by individual candidates instead of political parties because of intense intra-party competition. This situation forces candidates to rely on their own networks instead of on the party machine.

In 2020, simultaneous local elections across the country were held in a single day amid the COVID-19 pandemic which stirred some controversy among the Indonesian public. During elections, many people are unable to vote outside their domicile, forcing them to be abstentions ().

<text>Thamizhan or &quot;Thamillhan&quot; is a 2002 Indian Tamil-language courtroom drama film directed by debutant Majith and produced by G. Venkateswaran. The film stars Vijay and debutant Priyanka Chopra. This is Chopra&#x27;s debut, first and only Tamil film up to date. Revathi, Nassar, Ashish Vidyarthi and Vivek also play pivotal roles in the film, while the film&#x27;s score and soundtrack were composed by D. Imman. The story involves solving several corruption cases by a lawyer named Surya in the process fighting against a criminal boss and finally making Indian law basics available as a free book to common people.

&quot;Thamizhan&quot; released on 12 April 2002. It received mixed reviews but was a commercial hit and it completed 100 days at the box office.

==Plot==
Surya is a happy-go-lucky guy and often gets involved in petty fights. He falls in love with Priya. His sister&#x27;s lawyer husband Sakthivel advises him to work under senior lawyer Lakshminarayanan. He becomes an upright lawyer who values and tries to redress things legally. Sakthivel is killed in the process of upholding justice by a corrupt bigwig GK.

He takes up a mission to make the layman understand his legal rights and learn the Indian law basics. So, Surya is seen as a hero by the Indian people. GK&#x27;s dairy factory gets sealed by Surya for violating food safety norms. Surya&#x27;s sister Jaya also meets a pitiful end at the hands of GK&#x27;s goons, but Surya refuses to give up. GK&#x27;s goons start a riot in a village and put the blame on Surya. Surya is arrested and beaten up by the corrupt cops, and retaliates in return. Surya is summoned at the court and fights up legally, suggesting several reforms in the judicial system of India. After Surya gets released, GK attempts to shoot him but gets thrashed by the people. Surya tells GK to reform before he gets punished. For his service, Surya is honoured by the President of India. Finally, it is shown that Surya&#x27;s dream had come true.

==Cast==
==Production==
In 2001, producer G. Venkateswaran signed on Thirupathisamy to direct Vijay in an action film titled &quot;Velan&quot;. The film, a remake of the director&#x27;s Telugu film &quot;Azad&quot;, saw Priyanka Chopra, winner of the beauty pageant Miss World 2000, being brought in by Venkateswaren to make her debut and play the lead female role. However, before production began, Thirupathisamy died in an accident and Venkateswaren duly decided to give debutant Majith a chance to direct a film with the same cast. To prepare for her role in the film, Priyanka watched Tamil films and tried to pick up a Tamil accent.

Gautami was initially selected to play Vijay&#x27;s sister in the film, but was later replaced by Revathi. Vivek was signed on to film comedy scenes for a sum of 15 lakh. A new technical team of music director 18-year-old Imman, who had scored for serials earlier, and cinematographer Ekambaram, who had apprenticed with Jeeva, were also selected. Furthermore, the sets were designed by Sabu Cyril, dance choreography was by Raju Sundaram, and stunts were arranged by Super Subbarayan.

A scene for the film featured the producer and lyricist Vairamuthu making guest appearances as themselves during a book launch event. The patriotic nature of the film led to a postal stamp being released with Vijay&#x27;s face on it. The similarities of title and release date between &quot;Thamizhan&quot; and the Prashanth-starrer &quot;Thamizh&quot; created confusion, with the producers of both films unable to accommodate any changes.

==Soundtrack==

The soundtrack of the film was composed by D. Imman, who made his debut at 19 years old. Priyanka Chopra sang a song in the film, with Vijay recommending her after he had heard her humming to a tune.

==Release and reception==
The film was released on 12 April 2002. Made on a high budget of 5 crore, &quot;Thamizhan&quot; was sold for 4.5 crore to distributors.

The film was later dubbed in Telugu as &quot;Dammunte Kasko&quot; (2013).

Malathi Rangarajan of The Hindu praised Vijay&#x27;s image change and claimed he acts out a &quot;creditable portrayal&quot;, while adding that &quot;dialogue is a strong point of the film&quot;. She further added &quot;debutante Priyanka Chopra has precious little to do&quot; and that Revathi&#x27;s role was of a clichéd elder sister. &quot;Cinesouth&quot; wrote &quot;Director Majid&#x27;s bold attempt to make a film on this subject deserves standing ovation. Vijay&#x27;s pavers are better utilized in stories like these than in helping &#x27;unexpected&#x27; loves. This would probably make the theatres as well as the Justice departments to sit up &amp; notice&quot;. In comparison, a reviewer from Bizhat.com stated that &quot;the message conveyed leaves you exhausted and stressed&quot;, giving the film an average review. &quot;Ananda Vikatan&quot; rated the film 40 out of 100.

==Controversy==
A case was filed in the Madras High Court to ban the film as they felt certain acts of Vijay&#x27;s character portrayed lawyers in poor light.

<text>The was a Japanese underworld organization formed by Yoshio Kodama in 1964, and named for the Kantō region from which it drew most of its membership. Kodama envisioned the Kantō-kai as a secret national police force, with the aim of forwarding the far right-wing views he and other organized criminals often held.

Kodama had originally envisioned a Japan-wide gangster society, but in 1963 Kazuo Taoka and his Kansai-based Yamaguchi-gumi gang refused to join, leaving Kodama with a Kantō-heavy organization.

The group disbanded in January 1965, after only fifteen months, but was a crucial step in uniting the many post-war gangs into a more coherent entity (the modern yakuza) instead of disparate, warring factions.

<text>The Japanese political process has two types of elections.
* 

While the national level features a parliamentary system of government where the head of government is elected indirectly by the legislature, prefectures and municipalities employ a presidential system where chief executives and legislative assemblies are directly elected, independently from each other. Many of the prefectural and municipal elections are held together in since 1947, held in years before leap years; but since each election cycle of every chief executive or assembly of any prefecture or municipality is independent and not reset after resignations/deaths/recalls/no-confidence votes/dissolutions/municipal mergers, there are also many non-unified local elections today. Prefectural and municipal assemblies are unicameral, the National Diet is bicameral, with the two houses on independent election cycles.

== History ==
== Rules and regulations, supervision ==
Both national &amp; local elections are regulated by the of 1950.

Elections are supervised by Election Administration Commissions at each administrative level under the general direction of the Central Election Management Council, an extraordinary organ attached to the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC). The minimum voting age in Japan&#x27;s non-compulsory electoral system was reduced from 20 to 18 years in June 2016. Voters must satisfy a three-month residency requirement before being allowed to cast a ballot.

For those seeking offices, there are two sets of age requirements: twenty-five years of age for admission to the House of Representatives and most local offices, and thirty years of age for admission to the House of Councillors and the prefectural governorship. Each deposit for candidacy for national election is 3 million yen (about 27 thousand dollars) for a single-seat constituency and 6 million yen (about 54 thousand dollars) for proportional representation.

==National elections==
National elections include:
* , held every four years unless the lower house is dissolved earlier to elect all members of the House of Representatives at once.
* , held every three years in staggered elections to six-year terms with half of the membership up in each class.
* to fill vacant majoritarian seats
* after an election has been invalidated, e.g. by a winner missing the legal vote quorum or after election law violations

Japan&#x27;s post-WWII national legislature, the , has two directly elected chambers, elected on independent electoral cycles:

=== House of Representatives ===
The has 465 members, elected for a rarely completed four-year term, 289 members in single-seat constituencies and 176 members by proportional representation in 11 regional &quot;block&quot; constituencies.

General elections of members of the House of Representatives are usually held before the end of a four-year term as the chamber may be dissolved by the cabinet via the Emperor. Most prime ministers use that option. The only exception in post-war history was the &quot;Lockheed Election&quot; of 1976 in which the Liberal Democratic Party lost its seat majority for the first time.

The single-seat constituencies are decided by plurality, and the proportional seats are handed out in each &quot;block&quot; constituency to party lists proportionally (by the D&#x27;Hondt method) to their share of the vote. Each voter votes twice, once for a candidate in the local constituency, and once for a party in the regional &quot;block&quot; constituency. In a parallel system, there is no link between votes in one tier and seat numbers in the other; but so-called of one candidate in both tiers simultaneously are allowed. If such dual candidates lose in the majoritarian tier, they still have a chance to be elected in the proportional block. Parties may also place dual district and block candidates on the same list rank; in that case, the system determines the order of candidates.

=== House of Councillors ===
The has 245 members (248 from 2022), elected for a fixed six-year term, 147 (2022–: 148) members by single non-transferable vote (SNTV) in 45 single- and multi-seat constituencies (most are prefectures, two combined constituencies comprise two neighbouring prefectures each) and 98 (2022–: 100) by proportional representation (by D&#x27;Hondt method) with optionally open lists in a single, nationwide constituency.

Regular/Ordinary elections of members of the House of Councillors are held once every three years. In staggered elections, half of the House of Councillors comes up for election every three years in elections. The term is fixed, the House of Councillors cannot be dissolved. This, too, is a parallel electoral system. Dual candidacies are not allowed. As in House of Representatives elections, voters have two votes: In the majoritarian election, the vote has to be for a candidate, but in the proportional election, the vote may be for either a party list or a single candidate; in the latter case, the vote counts as both a vote for the party list (to determine proportional seat distribution), and as a preference vote within that list (to determine the order or proportional candidates within that list). The district magnitudes in the majoritarian tier vary between one and six, dependent on, but not fully proportional to the population of each prefecture. In single-member constituencies, SNTV becomes equivalent to first-past-the-post, whereas seats are usually split between different parties/alliances in multi-member constituencies (and in the proportional constituency by definition). Therefore, the are more likely to swing the election result and often receive more media and campaign attention. The proportional election to the House of Councillors allows the voters to cast a preference vote for a single candidate on a party list. The preference votes strictly determined the ranking of candidates on party lists before 2019. Since the 2019 election, parties are allowed to prioritize individual candidates on their proportional list over voter preferences in a . In the 2019 election, almost all parties continued to use completely open lists; exceptions were the LDP which used the &quot;special frame&quot; to give secure list spots to two LDP prefectural federations affected by the introduction of combined constituencies in 2016, Reiwa Shinsengumi which used it to give secure list spots to two candidates with severe disabilities, and the minor &quot;Labourers&#x27; Party for the liberation of labour&quot;.
=== Double elections ===
The electoral cycles of the two chambers of the Diet are usually not synchronized. Even when the current constitution took effect in 1947, the first House of Councillors election was held several days apart from the 23rd House of Representatives election. Only in 1980 and 1986, general and regular election coincided on the same day because the House of Representatives was dissolved in time for the election to be scheduled together with the House of Councillors election in early summer.

=== By- and repeat elections ===
Vacant district seats in both Houses are generally filled in by-elections. Nowadays, these are usually scheduled in April and October as necessary. Vacant proportional seats in both Houses and district seats in the House of Councillors that fall vacant within three months of a regular election are filled by : the highest ranking candidate on a proportional list or in the electoral district who was not elected and is not disqualified takes the seat. Disqualifications may, for example, happen if a candidate for the House of Councillors runs for the House of Representatives or vice versa, or after a violation of campaign laws.

===Election of the Prime Minister===
Between 1885 and 1947 in the Empire of Japan, the prime minister was not elected by the legislature, but responsible to, chosen and appointed by the Emperor. In practice, the usually nominated a candidate for appointment. The and its elected lower house, the House of Representatives, which were set up in 1890 according to the Imperial Constitution, had no constitutionally guaranteed role in the formation of cabinets. https://www.ndl.go.jp/jikihitsu/e/part2/s2_1.html

Since 1947, the Prime Minister has been chosen in the in the National Diet. It is held after a cabinet has submitted its resignation – the outgoing cabinet remains as caretaker cabinet until the Imperial inauguration ceremony of a new prime minister –; a cabinet must resign en masse under the constitution (Articles 69 and 70) 1. always on convocation of the first Diet after a general election of the House of Representatives, 2. if the post of prime minister has fallen vacant – that includes cases when the prime minister is permanently incapacitated, e.g. by illness, kidnapping or defection –, or 3. if a no-confidence vote in the House of Representatives is not answered by the dissolution of the chamber. Though both Houses of the Diet vote in two-round elections to select a prime minister, the House of Representatives has the decisive vote: If the two Houses vote for different candidates (as they did in 1948, 1989, 1998, 2007 and 2008), a procedure in the may reach a consensus; but eventually the candidate of the House of Representatives becomes that of the whole Diet and thereby prime minister-designate. The designated prime minister must still be ceremonially appointed by the Emperor in the to enter office; but unlike some heads of state, the Emperor has no reserve power to appoint anyone other than the person elected by the Diet.

In 2001, LDP president and Prime Minister Junichirō Koizumi instituted an advisory council to investigate the possibility of introducing direct popular election of the prime minister in a constitutional revision.

==Latest results==
=== October 2024 House of Representatives general and House of Councillors by-election ===

In the wake of the fundraising party kickback scandal, the ruling coalition faced polls predicting a loss of its majority. But the opposition had not come up with a unified nomination strategy after most parties had changed leadership in 2024 and the Communist-non-Communist united front had ended: The main opposition CDP comprehensively cooperated with neither the left (JCP, Reiwa Shinsengumi) nor the centre-right (DPFP, Ishin), so a number of districts were contested by several competing opposition parties against the ruling camp (CDP-Ishin 115, CDP-JCP 142, CDP-DPFP 13), while others only saw LDP-JCP contests among the established parties. In the result, the LDP-Kōmeitō coalition, while losing its majority, maintained a plurality strong enough to continue as a minority government, with DPFP and Ishin willing to cooperate in legislation on a case-by-case basis. Among the far-left parties, ReiShin overtook the JCP, and two far-right parties, Sanseitō and the Conservative Party of Japan managed to enter the House of Representatives.

Summary of results:
* Proportional tier (11 constituencies, 176 seats), turnout 53.83%
** LDP 285 candidates (including 209 dual candidates), 26.7% of votes, 58→59 seats (34% of seats)
** CDP 234 candidates (204 dual), 21.2%, 43→44 seats (25%)
** DPFP 42 candidates (41 dual), 11.3%, 20→17 seats (10%) – The party would have received 20 seats according to the vote result, but had not enough candidates left in two blocs after the removal of disqualified or victorious dual candidates, so the seats were redistributed to the next parties who would have received seats under the proportional D&#x27;Hondt distribution.

The House of Councillors by-election in Iwate after the scandal-related resignation of Megumi Hirose (independent, ex-LDP) who had been the first LDP candidate to win Iwate since 1992 was overwhelmingly won by centre-left ex-incumbent Eiji Kidoguchi (CDP) with 65.9% of the vote.

=== April 2024 House of Representatives by-elections ===

On 28 April 2024, three by-elections were held: in Tokyo 15, Shimane 1 and Nagasaki 3. The CDP carried all three; amid extremely low approval ratings in the wake of the party kickback slush fund scandal, the LDP didn&#x27;t contest Tokyo and Nagasaki (In Tokyo, Hirotada Ototake was supposed to be the LDP/Yuriko Koike affiliated candidate, but the LDP refused to endorse him), but also lost its previously unbroken &quot;conservative kingdom&quot; in Shimane.

=== October 2023 by-elections to both houses ===

In October 2023, two national by-elections were held on the same day as the prefectural assembly election in Miyagi. In Nagasaki&#x27;s 4th House of Representatives district where Seigo Kitamura (LDP) had died in May, Yōzō Kaneko (LDP – Kōmeitō), the son of former Nagasaki governor and senator Genjirō Kaneko, held the seat for the ruling coalition by 7 points over centre-left opposition candidate Seiichi Suetsugu (CDP – SDP). The Tokushima-Kōchi senate seat had fallen vacant when Kōjirō Takano (LDP) had resigned after assaulting his secretary; the seat went to opposition-supported former Kōchi 2 House of Representatives member Hajime Hirota (I) who beat ruling coalition candidate Ken Nishiuchi (LDP – Kōmeitō) by more than 24 points.

=== April 2023 by-elections to both houses ===

Together with the second stage of the unified local elections, five national by-elections were held. The ruling coalition carried four, Nippon Ishin expanded beyond its Osaka base with an FPTP victory in Wakayama, the center-left opposition won none. The House of Councillors by-election in Ōita, the most clear-cut one-on-one government/opposition contest of the evening, was decided in favour of government candidate Aki Shirasaka (LDP – Kōmeitō) by less than 400 votes over Tadatomo Yoshida (CDP – JCP, SDP).

==Malapportionment==
In the 1980s, apportionment of electoral districts still reflected the distribution of the population in the years following World War II, when only one-third of the people lived in urban areas and two thirds lived in rural areas. In the next forty-five years, the population became more than three-quarters urban, as people deserted rural communities to seek economic opportunities in Tokyo and other large cities. The lack of reapportionment led to a serious underrepresentation of urban voters. Urban districts in the House of Representatives were increased by five in 1964, bringing nineteen new representatives to the lower house; in 1975 six more urban districts were established, with a total of twenty new representatives allocated to them and to other urban districts. Yet great inequities remained between urban and rural voters.

In the early 1980s, as many as five times the votes were needed to elect a representative from an urban district compared with those needed for a rural district. Similar disparities existed in the prefectural constituencies of the House of Councillors. The Supreme Court had ruled on several occasions that the imbalance violated the constitutional principle of one person-one vote. The Supreme Court mandated the addition of eight representatives to urban districts and the removal of seven from rural districts in 1986. Several lower house districts&#x27; boundaries were redrawn. Yet the disparity was still as much as three urban votes to one rural vote.

After the 1986 change, the average number of persons per lower house representative was 236,424. However, the figure varied from 427,761 persons per representative in the fourth district of Kanagawa Prefecture, which contains the large city of Yokohama, to 142,932 persons in the third district of largely rural and mountainous Nagano Prefecture.

The 1993 reform government under Hosokawa Morihiro introduce a new electoral system whereby 200 members (reduced to 180 beginning with the 2000 election) are elected by proportional representation in multi-member districts or &quot;blocs&quot; while 300 are elected from single-candidate districts.

Still, according to the 6 October 2006 issue of the Japanese newspaper &quot;Daily Yomiuri&quot;, &quot;the Supreme Court followed legal precedent in ruling Wednesday that the House of Councillors election in 2004 was held in a constitutionally sound way despite a 5.13-fold disparity in the weight of votes between the nation&#x27;s most densely and most sparsely populated electoral districts&quot;.

The 2009 general House of Representatives election was the first unconstitutional lower house election under the current electoral system introduced in 1994 (parallel voting and &quot;small&quot; FPTP single-member electoral districts/&quot;Kakumander&quot;). In March 2011, the Grand Bench (&quot;daihōtei&quot;) of the Supreme Court ruled that the maximum discrepancy of 2.30 in voting weight between the Kōchi 3 and Chiba 4 constituencies in the 2009 election was in violation of the constitutionally guaranteed equality of all voters. As in previous such rulings on unconstitutional elections (1972, 1980, 1983 and 1990 Representatives elections, 1992 Councillors election), the election is not invalidated, but the imbalance has to be corrected by the Diet through redistricting and/or reapportionment of seats between prefectures.

In 2016, a panel of experts proposed to introduce the [John Quincy] Adams apportionment method (method of smallest divisors) for apportioning House of Representatives seats to prefectures. The reform is planned to be implemented after the 2020 census figures are available and not expected to take effect before 2022. In the meantime, another redistricting and apportionment passed in 2017 is designed to keep the maximum malapportionment ratio in the House of Representatives below 2. In the FPTP tier, it changes 97 districts and cuts six without adding any; in the proportional tier, four &quot;blocks&quot; lose a seat each; the total number of seats in the lower house is cut to 465, 289 majoritarian seats and 176 proportional seats.

The malapportionment in the 2010 and 2013 regular House of Councillors elections was ruled unconstitutional (or &quot;in an unconstitutional state&quot;) by the Supreme Court, and has been reduced by a 2015 reapportionment below 3 (at least in government statistics from census data which is regular and standardized but lags behind resident registration statistics and the actual number of eligible voters; using the latter, the maximum malapportionment in the 2016 election remained slightly above 3).

The following table lists the 10 electoral districts with the highest and lowest number of registered voters per member elected for each chamber of the National Diet according to the voter statistics as of September 2016 released by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications – it takes into account the lowering of the voting age and the district reforms to both houses of the Diet in effect since the 2014 and 2016 elections, but not the 2017 redistricting/reapportionment effective from the next House of Representatives election.

==Prefectural and local elections==
Local elections include:
* Prefectural elections
** on an independent four-year cycle
** , general elections are held on an independent four-year cycle
* Municipal elections
** on an independent four-year cycle
** , general elections are held on an independent four-year cycle

There are 47 prefectures &quot;(-to/-dō/-fu/-ken)&quot; of Japan since 1888, they are contiguously subdivided into 1741 municipalities &quot;(-shi/-ku/-chō/-son)&quot; since 2014 (see Administrative divisions of Japan).

===Unified elections===
Unified local elections (統一地方選挙 &quot;tōitsu chihō senkyo&quot;) are held once every four years. Prefectural assemblies and governors, as well as mayors and assemblies in municipalities, are elected for four-year terms. In April 1947, all local elections in the 46 prefectures (excluding Okinawa Prefecture, then under US military rule) and all their municipalities were held at the same time in &quot;unified local elections&quot;. Since then, some gubernatorial and mayoral elections, and most assembly elections, have stayed on this original four-year cycle. Most governors and mayors are now elected on different schedules as the four-year cycle &quot;resets&quot; upon the resignation, death or removal of a sitting governor or mayor. Some assembly election cycles have also shifted due to assembly dissolutions or mergers of municipalities.

The most recent were the 2023 Japanese unified local elections.
As of 2015, the major contests in the unified local elections are as follows:

Although Tokyo&#x27;s metropolitan governor and assembly elections are currently held on separate schedules, 21 of the 23 special wards of Tokyo follow the unified election schedule for their assembly elections, the only exceptions being Katsushika and Adachi. The majority of Tokyo&#x27;s special wards follow separate cycles for their mayoral elections. Tokyo elected its governor as part of the unified elections until 2011, but was forced to hold a 2012 election and 2014 election due to the resignations of Shintaro Ishihara and Naoki Inose.

Iwate Prefecture, Miyagi Prefecture and Fukushima Prefecture are no longer on the unified election cycle due to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, which delayed their elections.

*2011 Japanese unified local elections
*2015 Japanese unified local elections

===Other major local election cycles===

* Since 1971, Ibaraki Prefecture has held its prefectural assembly elections in the December preceding the unified election, making this election a regular leading indicator of the nationwide elections in the following April. The 2014 Ibaraki election was held on the same day as the 2014 Japanese general election.
* Approximately 193 new municipalities were created in a wave of &quot;Heisei mergers&quot; effective in April 2005. Their first municipal elections were held around this time, and coincided with the Chiba and Akita gubernatorial elections and the Nagoya mayoral election, creating a second major local election cycle sometimes referred to as the &quot;mini unified local elections.&quot;
* Okinawa Prefecture and most of its local governments continue to follow a four-year cycle that began following repatriation to Japan in June 1972, with several exceptions (including the city of Naha). Okinawa elections generally occur in the year following the unified elections; the next is scheduled for June 2016.

==Ballots, voting machines and early voting==

Votes in national and most local elections are cast by writing the candidate&#x27;s or party&#x27;s name on a blank ballot paper. In elections for the House of Representatives voters fill in two ballots, one with the name of their preferred district candidate and one with their preferred party in the proportional representation block. For the House of Councillors, the district vote is similar (in SNTV multi-member districts, several candidates can be elected, but every voter has only one vote). But in the proportional vote for the House of Councillors votes are cast for a party list (to determine how many proportional seats a party receives) or a candidate (which additionally influences which candidates are elected from a party&#x27;s list).

Ballots that cannot unambiguously be assigned to a candidate are not considered invalid, but are assigned to all potentially intended candidates proportionally to the unambiguous votes each candidate has received. These so-called are rounded to the third decimal. For example, if &quot;Yamada A&quot; and &quot;Yamada B&quot; both stood in an election and there were 1500 unambiguous votes: 1000 for &quot;Yamada A&quot; and 500 for &quot;Yamada B&quot;; five ambiguous votes for &quot;Yamada&quot; would then count for Yamada A as 5×1000/1500=3.333 votes, and for Yamada B as 5×500/1500=1.667 votes. The official overall result would then be: Yamada A 1003.333 votes, Yamada B 501.667 votes.

In 2002, passage of an electronic voting law allowed for the introduction of electronic voting machines in local elections. The first machine vote took place in Niimi, Okayama in June 2002. In 2003, a system for was introduced. In the 2017 general/House of Representatives election, a record number of more than 21 million Japanese voted early; at the same time overall turnout was low (the second lowest in history), so in 2017, roughly 38% of all actual voters had voted early. For regular/House of Councillors elections, the 2019 election set a new all-time high with more than 17 million early voters, corresponding to roughly a third of actual voters in 2019 as overall turnout hit the second lowest value in history.

== Walkovers ==
In Japan, walkovers in elections are called , &quot;[being] elected without vote&quot;. And there is literally no vote held in a walkover in Japan, no way to vote &quot;no&quot; or abstain explicitly: If there are only as many candidates in an election as there are seats/offices at the start of the legal election period (&quot;official announcement&quot;: in national general and regular elections; in prefectural and municipal elections as well as national by-elections), they are declared the winners. But the otherwise applicable moratorium period after regular elections on recall attempts does not apply after a walkover. (Recalls are a two-/three-step procedure: first, supporters of a recall must collect a sufficient number of signatures; if they do, a referendum is held on whether or not to recall the incumbent; only if that is accepted by a majority, a fresh election is scheduled.) Article 100 of the Public Offices Election Law deals with walkovers, there are additional walkover provisions for subnational elections in the Local Autonomy Law.

Walkovers have become widespread in prefectural and municipal elections in recent years; in the 2019 unified local elections, out of 2277 seats up in 945 electoral districts for 41 prefectural assemblies, a record 612 seats are won by walkovers in a total of 371 districts or 39% of all electoral districts. In one extreme case, a rural single-member electoral district to the Shimane prefectural assembly, there hasn&#x27;t been a contested election in 31 years (the whole Heisei period).

<text>Count István Imre Lajos Pál Tisza de Borosjenő et Szeged (, English: Stephen Emery Louis Paul Tisza, short name: Stephen Tisza); (22 April 1861 – 31 October 1918) was a politician who served as prime minister of Hungary from 1903 to 1905 and from 1913 until 1917. He was also a political scientist, international lawyer, macroeconomist, member of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences and champion duelist. The outbreak of World War One defined his second term as prime minister. He was killed by leftist revolutionaries on 31 October 1918 during the Aster Revolution, the day Hungary declared its independence, dissolving the Dual Monarchy or Austro-Hungarian Empire. Tisza was the most zealous adherent of the Dual Monarchy (the partnership with Austria) among the Hungarian political leaders and pleaded for consensus between liberals and conservatives.
As a Member of the Imperial Council since 1887, he came to fear a political impasse in the conflict between the unyielding temper of the Emperor and the revolutionary spirit of the extremists.

During his political career, Tisza and his party remained bitterly unpopular among ethnic Hungarian voters and therefore - similarly to his father Kálmán Tisza - he drew most of his votes from ethnic minorities during the parliamentary elections.

Like his father, he supported industrialisation at the expense of the agricultural lobby, and opposed Anti-Semitism as economically counterproductive.

As an economist, Tisza stubbornly opposed on principle any governmental redistribution of agricultural land breaking up the large landed estates. During WWI, he opposed extending suffrage to active duty soldiers; before 1918 only 10% of the citizens of Kingdom of Hungary could vote and hold public office.

In international relations, Tisza&#x27;s role model was Otto von Bismarck. In domestic affairs, he followed the English historical school of economics and was heavily influenced by the social and political development of England, which he considered the best way forward for Hungary.

==Early life and education==
Born into the Tisza family as the son of Kálmán Tisza de Borosjenő, who served as prime minister of Hungary between 1875 and 1890 from the Liberal Party. The Tiszas were originally Calvinists of untitled lower noble origins (regarded as equivalent to the British gentry). His mother, Countess Helene von Degenfeld-Schonburg, was a Hungarian-German aristocrat from Baden-Württemberg (born: Helene Johanna Josepha Mathilde Gräfin von Degenfeld-Schonburg).

The young István raised in a puritanical and authoritarian Calvinist environment with high expectations. He had studied at home until the age of twelve, before he gained entry to grammar school named the Calvinist Gymnasium of Debrecen. After completing his secondary education, he took legal studies in Budapest, and then went on to study international law at Heidelberg University, followed by studies at the faculty of economics of Humboldt University of Berlin, obtaining a PhD, and eventually he put himself through the faculty of political science at the University of Oxford, earning a doctorate in political science.

At first, he became acquainted with the practical issues of the public administration at the Ministry of the Interior. He had done several studies on agricultural issues that were published in the Budapest Review. After serving 1 year as a volunteer hussar in the Royal Hungarian Honvéd army; where he got promoted to the rank of hussar officer, he settled in Bihar County and took an active part in the political and economic life of the county as a committee member and honorary chief notary of Bihar county.

==Political career==
===Tisza as a member of parliament===
After overseeing his family estates in Bihar County and Geszt for five years, he decided to pursue a career in politics. He won his first parliamentary electoral mandate in 1886 with the Liberal Party in Vízakna (Now: Ocna Sibiului, Romania), a Transylvanian electoral district that he represented until 1892. Subsequently, he won his second seat in 1892 as a representative of Újbánya district (Now: Nová Baňa, Slovakia). In 1896, he won the seat of Ugra district (Now: Ungra, Romania). Meanwhile, he also became a member of the economic committee of the Hungarian parliament, where he was engaged in conferring about macroeconomic issues.

In the 1890s, having capitalized on a phenomenon that was prevalent among prestigious European politicians at that time, he held a number of sinecures, which thereby provided extraordinary income to him. He was the president of the Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank (Magyar Ipar- és Kereskedelmi Bank); and, besides, he took on positions on numerous corporate boards, e.g., on boards of numerous joint-stock companies and industrial enterprises. In the face of the financial crisis of the 1890s, many of these enterprises became the fastest emerging companies of the country under his lead; some of them could even become inevitably important enterprises in their own sectors. As a result, the mediocre Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank was transformed into the largest Bank of Hungary in a decade.

His uncle, the childless Lajos Tisza received the title of Count from Emperor Franz Joseph in 1897. However, Lajos Tisza conferred his new title upon his nephew Stephen with the consent of the Monarch, on 16 February 1897.

=== Prime minister (first term, 1903–1905) ===
He was chairman and board member of several financial institutions (e.g., the Hungarian Industrial and Commercial Bank) and many industrial companies but resigned from all of his memberships before he was appointed as prime minister. In this period of time, he managed to get the remains of prince Francis II Rákóczi repatriated from Turkey and interred in the St Elisabeth Cathedral of Kassa, today Košice.

==== Target of Leftist and socialist circles ====
On 19 April 1904, a nationwide strike of railroad workers broke out, which paralyzed the Hungarian economy. Tisza solved the crisis quickly but drastically: the organizers of the strike got arrested, and the participant railway workers got recruited into the Hungarian Honvéd army. Besides parliament introduced a Bill increasing the number of draftees and the police came down heavily on peasants for taking part in a Socialist gathering in Bihar, leaving 33 dead and several hundred wounded.

==== Target of anti-Semite circles ====
Tisza often used his influence in parliament to grant titles to wealthy Jewish families; especially for successful industrialists and bankers, of whose lives he thought had set a good example to the people worth following. Many of the young middle-class families were Jews or baptized Jews. Tisza often gathered influential men of Jewish extraction around himself as advisors. He even offered many positions in his cabinets to Jews. His first appointment was Samu Hazai as Minister of War. Two years later he picked János Teleszky as minister of finance. The third Jewish member of his cabinet was János Harkányi, minister of trade. Tisza appointed Samu Hazai as Minister of War during his second premiere. They all served for the duration of Tisza&#x27;s seven years in office. The Liberal Party passed legislation for the Jewish emancipation in 1867 and appointed many Jewish origin MEPs to parliament (both to the upper and lower houses). In return, many Jews supported the party. Many districts of Budapest, where Jews made up half of the voters, reliably voted for the Liberal candidates. Similarly to the policy of his father, István Tisza allowed the unrestricted immigration of Jewish refugees from the Russian Empire, who fled from the Tzarist pogroms. His philosemitic political attitude made him a target of anti-Semite politicians and political circles.

==== Target of radical nationalists ====
At the beginning of the 20th century, only 54.5% (1910 census) of the population of the Kingdom of Hungary considered themselves to be Hungarians. The Tisza&#x27;s party —i.e. &quot;The Liberal Party of Hungary&quot; urgently needed the support of minorities to maintain the majority of the party in the Hungarian parliament. The liberal party was the most popular political force in the electoral districts where the ethnic minorities represented the local majority. However, his main political opponents —i.e. &quot;The nationalist Party of Independence and &#x27;48 and Catholic People&#x27;s Party&quot; could collect mandates only from the Hungarian majority electoral districts.

==== &quot;Election by handkerchief&quot; and the victory of nationalist opposition ====

The rules of the parliamentary procedure of the Kingdom of Hungary in the Dual Monarchy were based on the common law which was the feature of feudal parliaments, meaning that everybody could deliver speeches without any time limit, so, the most prominent speakers could take the stage for as long as 4–8 hours. However, this paralyzed the procedure of the Hungarian legislature. For decades, the opposition often wielded this tactic to obstruct legislation in important cases where the government should have been exercised its authority without disruption.

Tisza decided to have the rules of Parliament modified to get the obstructions of the opposition out of the way. On behalf of The Liberal Party, it was deputy Gábor Dániel who made the proposal to Parliament to modify the rules in a way to substantially have the possibility of the stonewalling tactics of the opposition narrowed. This took place, on 18 November 1904, after István Tisza had delivered a short speech. President of the House, Dezső Perczel had, in violation of the House rules, silently announced the start of the voting on the proposition and then by waving a handkerchief, he gave the members of The Liberal Party the signal to start voting.

In response to what happened; out of curiosity, the members of the opposition stood up because they did not understand the situation. At that time, however, standing up was the means of approving a proposal and staying put was the means of turning down a proposal in Parliament. And after reading the King&#x27;s handwritten message out to Parliament, Dezső Perczel declared that the proposal passed amid an ear-splitting tumult and then the session got adjourned until 13 December. But the next day the opposition unified into an alliance, and shortly afterwards many prominent members left the Liberal Party—e.g., Kálmán Széll, Gyula Wlassics, Pál Teleki, Gyula Andrássy, Miklós Bánffy. Some members of them headed up by Gyula Andrássy broke away to form a rival party and joined the opposition. They first named themselves &quot;The Dissidents&quot; but then their name was changed to The National Constitution Party. For the rest of the year, the opposition made it impossible for Parliament to proceed with the legislative work and by January 1905, the situation became ex lex or anarchical. As a result, the King dissolved Parliament and scheduled to hold a new parliamentary election.

However, these events that went down in history as &quot;election by handkerchief&quot; cost The Liberal Party dear. After the 1905 election, Parliament approved a new coalition government, ending the historic 30-year rule of The Liberal Party and sending the polarizing leader into the opposition which eventually led to the dissolution of The Party.
==== National Party of Work, electoral victory in 1910 ====
On 19 February 1910, Tisza established the National Party of Work (Nemzeti Munkapárt) which subsequently won the election of 1910. This time around he had no intention of forming a government, primarily due to his conflict with Franz Ferdinand who sought to centralise the Habsburg monarchy with universal suffrage. Tisza opposed this initiative, as he believed that this might lead to the weakening of the Hungarian supremacy over ethnic minorities. In addition, he claimed that demagogues — i.e., &quot;politicians of communists and agrarian socialist movements&quot; might manipulate peasants to put the politicians into power that are not in favour of democratic government. Although Tisza had the emperor&#x27;s support, he feared that the faults of his first prime ministership could be repeated and therefore called on Károly Khuen-Héderváry to form the new government. However, despite the fact that Tisza was not in office as prime minister again until 1913, his power and influence on the ruling party was completely absolute.

====Speaker of the House and Act of Protection====

As Speaker of the House of Representatives from 22 May 1912 to 12 June 1913 Tisza supported the reform of the common Austro-Hungarian army to enhance the military power of the dual monarchy. Tisza considered army reform essential (increasing the number of recruits and raising expenditures) because he believed that delaying it would weaken the military position of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy and undermine Hungary&#x27;s security. However the opposition was fighting for more Hungarian interests (i.e., use of the Magyar language in the army). Tisza and his party refused the idea of universal suffrage. According to his threatening prediction, the majority votes of peasants – manipulated by primitive demagogues – would result in the domination of groups whose goals are just contrary to the ideals of metropolitan intellectuals and socialists who call for democracy. The Socialists strongly opposed his acts and decided to organize a protest march. Socialist agents organised a worker rebellion on 22 May 1912 (Blood-Red Thursday), calling for Tisza to resign as President of the House and calling for universal suffrage. On the next day, the protesters and workers marched toward the Parliament building, meanwhile the events transformed to violence, protesters broke the shop windows in the surrounding streets, automobiles and tramcard were damaged by the masses. However, the protesters were stopped by the storm of hussar cavalry units, and they were arrested by the police. Six people died in the clashes, nearly two hundred were injured and three hundred were arrested. This event became known as &quot;Blood-Red Thursday&quot; in the contemporary press and later in the history books.

Tisza tried to solve the question of ethnic minorities based on a clerical approach (like the representation of Orthodox and Greek Catholic Church in The Upper House of the parliament).

He was convinced that the challenging foreign situation called for military preparation and he strongly pushed against opposition obstruction. He did not allow the opposition to speak up regarding rules of House of Parliament. Referring to an act of 1848, he called for the police force to force out numerous opposition representatives. He managed to pass the Act of Protection, resulting in the removal of some members of the opposition party.

As a result, Gyula Kovács, an opposition party representative, tried to assassinate Tisza in the Parliament Building on 7 June 1912. His shots missed and the marks are still visible in the Hungarian Parliament Building to this day. With his last shot Kovács shot himself, but he survived. Tisza then continued the session.

=== Prime minister (second term, 1913–1917) ===

Tisza became prime minister of Hungary again on 7 June 1913.

====Freedom of the press====
Inspired by the Western European model, Tisza&#x27;s cabinet introduced for the first time in the history of Hungarian journalism the legal category of defamation, libel and &quot;scare-mongering&quot;, thus the press became actionable before the courts. Journalists and newspapers had to pay compensations for the victims of defamation and libel. Despite the fact that these institutions and laws worked well in Western Europe and in the United States, the contemporary Hungarian newspapers and journalists considered it as the violation of the Freedom of Speech and the Freedom of Press.

====Croatia====
Count István Tisza tried to solve the longstanding Hungarian-Croatian issue, namely to clarify the relationship; for this matter, he met Count Tivadar Pejácsevich, Count of Verovce, Croatian Ban, and a year later, Baron Lomnica, Ivan Skerlecz, the new Croatian Ban.

Tisza maintained his conciliatory position, promising to reestablish the Croatian Constitution, which had been suspended in May 1912. Tisza appointed his old family friend Baron Ivan Skerlecz, of Šokci origin, as the new ban of Croatia. Negotiations between the Croatian representatives and Tisza bore fruit and allowed the restitution of the Croatian constitutional government in November 1913.

==== Foreign policy and World War I ====
A few days before the assassination of Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, which resulted in World War I, Tisza supported a strong stand against Serbia. However, after the assassination he was against going to war against Serbia, a rare view in Austria-Hungary. He knew the army&#x27;s strength, and he was afraid that with the increase of more Slavic territories the equilibrium inside the monarchy would be upset. Moreover, he was afraid that Romania would seize Transylvania. However he came to realize that ending the alliance with Germany would have meant the end of Austria-Hungary as a Great Power, so he gave in and supported the war. He then became a relentless supporter of the war until its end.

Tisza believed Romania to be an enemy from the beginning. He was afraid that if Romania attacked Hungary then the Romanians in Transylvania would revolt against Hungary. In the end, 40,000 soldiers were moved to protect Transylvania.

The very existence of the dual monarchy came into question during the war. Tisza wanted to solidify the government. He appointed Baron Stephan Burián von Rajecz who planned to increase the prestige of the monarchy and to get parity with Germany but also to negotiate peace with the help of the Americans. But Berlin alienated the United States by announcing full submarine warfare in 1917, with the goal of sinking American ships bringing supplies to the Allies.

Towards the end of the war, Tisza had wanted to give the Serbs and Bosnians autonomy within Austria-Hungary. As a &quot;homo regius&quot; (&quot;king&#x27;s man&quot;), he went to Sarajevo to attempt this, but they demanded independent states. By late October 1918, the dissolution of the dual monarchy and the surrender of Germany were imminent and there was nothing that foreign minister Burián (who was still in that role) could do to change the course of history. Under dualist Austro-Hungarian state, the Emperor held foreign policy and military affairs in his hands, and his influence in Hungary was, by Tisza&#x27;s words, no more than &quot;a weak guiding influence&quot;. However the Western politicians and journalists of the time might have thought that, while Hungary and the Hungarian parliament seemed stable under Tisza&#x27;s leadership (due to the supermajority of his party), Austria was weakened by a series of domestic political crises and the war had broken out with an attack on Serbia, which directly bordered with kingdom of Hungary. After German Emperor Wilhelm II and German General Erich Ludendorff, István Tisza was often described by the Western press to be the &quot;most hated enemy&quot;, as he was considered the third most important man of the Central Powers in 1918.

===== His view on war against Serbia =====
Tisza opposed the expansion of the empire on the Balkan (see Bosnian crisis in 1908), because &quot;the Dual Monarchy already had too many Slavs&quot;, which would further threaten the integrity of the Dual Monarchy.

In March 1914, Tisza wrote a memorandum to Emperor Francis Joseph. His letter had a strongly apocalyptic, predictive and embittered tone. He used the expression &quot;Weltkrieg&quot; (meaning World War) - a term hitherto unknown in German language - in his letter. &quot;It is my firm conviction that Germany&#x27;s two neighbors [Russia and France] are carefully proceeding with military preparations, but will not start the war so long as they have not attained a grouping of the Balkan states against us that confronts the monarchy with an attack from three sides and pins down the majority of our forces on our eastern and southern front.&quot;

On the day of the assassination of Franz Ferdinand, Tisza immediately traveled to Vienna where he met Minister of Foreign Affairs Count Berchtold and Army Commander Conrad von Hötzendorf. They proposed to solve the dispute with arms, attacking Serbia. Tisza proposed to give the government of Serbia time to take a stand as to whether it was involved in the organisation of the murder and proposed a peaceful resolution, arguing that the international situation would settle soon. Returning to Budapest, he wrote to Franz Joseph saying he would not take any responsibility for the armed conflict because there was no proof that Serbia had plotted the assassination. Tisza opposed a war with Serbia, stating that any war with the Serbs was bound to trigger a war with Russia and hence a general European war. He thought that even a successful Austro-Hungarian war would be disastrous for the integrity of the Kingdom of Hungary, where Hungary would be the next victim of Austrian politics. After a successful war against Serbia, Tisza adumbrated a possible Austrian military attack against the Kingdom of Hungary, where the Austrians want to break up the territory of Hungary. He did not trust in the Italian alliance, due to the political aftermath of the Second Italian War of Independence. He also felt the threat of Romania and Bulgaria after the Balkan wars and was afraid of Romanian attack from the east, while Austro-Hungarian forces had to fight against the Russian Empire and maybe against Italy. He was also not sure about the stand of the Germans. Germany&#x27;s stand was of ultimate importance due to the security of the state. 
During a conversation between Franz Joseph and Conrad von Hötzendorf, Hötzendorf asked, &quot;If Germany&#x27;s reply is that they are on our side, do we engage in war with Serbia?&quot; The emperor replied, &quot;Then yes&quot;, &quot;But what if they reply differently?&quot;, &quot;Then the Monarchy will be alone&quot;.

===== Council of Joint Ministers meeting =====
On 7 July, the Council of Joint Ministers debated Austria-Hungary&#x27;s course of action. The most hawkish on the Council considered a surprise attack on Serbia. Count Tisza persuaded the Council that demands should be placed on Serbia before mobilization to provide a proper &quot;juridical basis for a declaration of war&quot;.

At that meeting of the Crown Council, all involved were in full favour of war except Tisza. Tisza warned that any attack on Serbia &quot;would, as far as can humanly be foreseen, lead to an intervention by Russia and hence a world war&quot;. The rest of the participants debated about whether Austria should just launch an unprovoked attack or issue an ultimatum to Serbia with demands so stringent that it was bound to be rejected. Austrian Prime Minister Stürgkh warned Tisza that if Austria did not launch a war, its &quot;policy of hesitation and weakness&quot; would cause Germany to abandon Austria-Hungary as an ally. All present, except Tisza, finally agreed that Austria-Hungary should present an ultimatum designed to be rejected.

The Council agreed on putting harsh demands on Serbia but could not reach consensus on how harsh. Except for Count Tisza, the Council intended to make such harsh demands that their rejection would be very probable. Tisza held out for demands that, while harsh, would not appear impossible to meet. Both views were sent to the Emperor on 8 July. The Emperor&#x27;s opinion was that the gap in opinion could most likely be bridged. An initial set of demands was drafted during the Council meeting.

Kaiser Wilhelm II supported the war, promised to neutralize a Romanian attack, and put pressure on Sofia. After this, Tisza still sought a peaceful solution, but most of all he wanted to wait for the result of the official investigation into the assassination. The only proposal of Tisza, which was accepted, was that the Monarchy should not annihilate Serbia completely in order to avoid Russian support for Serbia. The council finally addressed an ultimatum to the Serbian government and immediately commenced mobilisation of troops. It took the week of 7–14 July to persuade Tisza to support war.

===== After the ultimatum =====
After sending the ultimatum, his view changed. The ultimatum had expired after 48 hours, so Tisza wrote: &quot;it was a difficult decision to take a stand to propose war, but now I am firmly convinced of its necessity&quot;. He was, however, still opposed to the annexation of Serbia to the Monarchy, but failed. On 4 August 1914 Russia, Germany, Britain and France also entered the war, enlarging it to a world war.

Tisza did not resign as prime minister, as he thought that, with his connections in Vienna, remaining in this position was the best way he could represent Hungarian interests inside Austria-Hungary. Moreover, his resignation would have sent a message of weakness to the Entente at the outbreak of war.

His initial opposition to the conflict, only became public after the end of World War 1, on 17 October 1918, when he spoke in the Parliament. He said, &quot;the Monarchy and the Hungarian nation were longing for peace all the way until there were proofs that the enemy was systematically trying to humiliate and destroy us as soon as possible (...) As we have found proofs that the Serbian government took part in organising the assassination, we could not but address an ultimatum to Serbia ... where we stipulated that the war is preventive.&quot;

====Resign====
During the war, the reformists became more and more powerful, but he continued to oppose them. At the time, Tisza was seen as forcing the continuation of the war and was losing a great deal of support.
As the war progressed, he became increasingly opposed to the powerful reform efforts of the opposition, which sought to expand suffrage and implement series of social reforms. With the death of Franz Joseph, István Tisza lost his most significant political patron. His resistance extended to the moderate reform policies of King Charles IV, who ascended the throne on December 30, 1916, following the death of Franz Joseph. He opposed the ideas of the new Emperor, Karl I, and was asked to resign; he did so on 23 May 1917.

As the party founder, István Tisza had enormous authority in the National Parti of Work, which made up the supermajority of the parliament, and therefore had full control over Hungarian politics in parliament even though he no longer held a prime ministerial or any governmental position. He was able to force his successor pm. Móric Esterházy to resign, then controlling the policies of pm. Sándor Wekerle, who succeeded him

===== Service in the front =====
The 57-year-old Tisza joined the 2nd Hussar Regiment of Hungary - which served on the Italian front - as a hussar colonel, and personally led his hussar units during the attacks.

Tisza at the front: &quot;Tisza already felt the not too friendly atmosphere surrounding him at the first days of his joining up to the regiment and at first he tried to ease the general mood by informal behavior. (...) He made an effort from the beginning to use an informal tone both with the staff of officers and - of course within the limits of the service regulations - with the rank and file. In order to get to know his fellow officers better, he invited some young officers to his table every day. In this way he tried to establish better personal relations with his environment. The troops had slowly started to recognize him as a &quot;tough to those above and humane to those below&quot; kind of commander. He distributed his tobacco provisions among the officers and he used his commander pay to improve the catering of the troops, and these of course left a good impression on everybody.
Tisza&#x27;s paternalistic attitude towards his subordinates also manifested itself in civil law cases: he helped with his personal influence in getting done of those petitions what he considered fair, he interceded with notaries, judges, alispáns (deputy-lieutenants) for advancing the home affairs of his men, due to this both the officers and the troops more and more came to like and embrace him. Tisza himself also felt that the front service had been quite useful and productive since on the one hand he could personally experience the dangers of the battleground an on the other hand-at least he was thinking that way and there is a lot of truth in it-he could truly become familiar with the real nature of the simple, peasant origin soldiers. He wrote about peasant soldiers in this way in a letter to Archduke Joseph: &quot;I’ve got to truly know the ordinary [peasants] people now. This is the most extraordinary race of the world that can only be loved and respected. How unfortunate that the political intelligentia doesn’t do anything else, just corrupts this great and God-blessed people.&quot;

==Assassination attempts==


For many, he was the representative of the war policy in the Monarchy, so he was an assassination target. The fourth assassination attempt against him was successful.

The first attempt was made in the Hungarian parliament in 1912 by Gyula Kovács, an opposition politician. He shot two bullets, but missed Tisza. Kovács was arrested by the police, but he was acquitted by the court, the justification was &quot;temporary insanity&quot;.

The second was made by a soldier when Tisza was returning from the front line during the war. The bullet missed him.

The third attempt came on 16 October 1918 when János Lékai, a member of the society Galilei-circle and an anti-military group led by Ottó Korvin, tried to kill Tisza while he was leaving the Hungarian Parliament, but the revolver malfunctioned and Tisza managed to flee. The assassin was sent to prison but was released after 15 days during the Chrysanthemum Revolution.

== Death ==
The fourth and successful assassination attempt came on 31 October 1918, when soldiers broke into his home, the Róheim Villa in Budapest, Hermina út 35., (today the Villa is at nr. 45.) in front of his wife and his grandniece. Some sources suggest these were disgruntled deserters who blamed Tisza for having started the war.

=== Aftermath ===

Subsequently, Mihály Károlyi&#x27;s government initiated an investigation but the identity of the killers was not confirmed at that time, however, family members had identified individuals that they said were the killers. In the trial that followed the fall of the Communist regime and ended on 6 October 1921, Judge István Gadó established the guilt of Pál Kéri, who was exchanged with the Soviet Union; József Pogány, aka &quot;John Pepper&quot;, who fled to Vienna, then Moscow and the USA; István Dobó; Tivadar Horváth Sanovics, who also fled; Sándor Hüttner, who died in a prison hospital in 1923; and Tibor Sztanykovszky, who was the only one to serve his 18-year sentence, being released in 1938.

Famous psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud, who knew both politicians personally, wrote about the assassination of István Tisza and the appointment of Mihály Károlyi as new prime minister of Hungary:

==Personal life==
He married his first degree cousin, Ilona Tisza de Borosjenő. They had two children together.
* István (1886–1918) 
* Juliska (1888-1894)

His son, István died of Spanish flu on 5 November 1918, five days after the death of the father.

Tisza was a &quot;champion duellist&quot; who &quot;had fought more duels than any man in Europe and had never once been seriously wounded&quot;. Having been taught by &quot;the best masters in Germany, France and Italy&quot;, he was equally adept with sword or pistol, despite (by 1913) having had a cataract operation on one of his eyes and wearing &quot;think horn-rimmed spectacles&quot;. In January 1913, he fought Mihály Károlyi in a 34-bout duel with cavalry sabres which lasted an hour until Tisza cut Károlyi&#x27;s arm and the seconds ended the duel. A week later he fought Aladár Széchenyi, again with sabres - the duel lasted one bout, ending with Tisza wounding Széchenyi with &quot;a long cut across the head&quot;. On about 20 August 1913, Tisza fought György Pallavacini (son-in-law and supporter of Opposition leader Gyula Andrássy) at a Budapest fencing school in a duel with &quot;heavy cavalry sabres&quot; and &quot;only slight protection of the body was allowed&quot;. After nine bouts, both duellists were bleeding from cuts to their foreheads, and the seconds declared both principals unable to continue - &quot;[t]he two men shook hands, then embraced, kissing each other on both cheeks, and declared themselves reconciled.&quot;

==Honors==
A István Tisza postage stamp was issued by Hungary on 1 July 1932 in the &quot;Famous Hungarians&quot; series.

<text>Sri Lanka elects on the national level a head of state – the president – and a legislature. Sri Lanka has a multi-party system, with two dominant political parties. All elections are administered by the Election Commission of Sri Lanka.

== President ==

The president is directly elected for a five-year term, through a version of Instant-runoff voting in which electors rank up to three candidates, and limited to only two rounds in total. If no candidate wins a majority in the first round of voting, second and third preferences from ballots whose first preference candidate has been eliminated are used to determine the winner. However, there was never an instance where a &quot;run-off&quot; count was needed since the introduction of directly elected president in the 1980s until the 2024 election. No candidate reached 50% in the first count in that election, so the second count was performed.

== Parliament ==
The Parliament has 225 members, elected for a five-year term, 196 members elected in multi-seat constituencies through proportional representation system where each party is allocated a number of seats from the quota for each district according to the proportion of the total vote that party obtains in the district. The other 29 which is called the national list are appointed by each party secretary according to the island wide proportional vote the party obtains.

== Local Government ==
The Local government bodies in Sri Lanka;
* Municipal Councils
* Urban Councils
* Pradeshiya Sabha
are elected through the mixed electoral system.

<doc id="925519" wikidata="Q4826294" url="?curid=925519" title="Autogram">
<text>An autogram ( = self, = letter) is a sentence that describes itself in the sense of providing an inventory of its own characters. They were invented by Lee Sallows, who also coined the word &quot;autogram&quot;. An essential feature is the use of full cardinal number names such as &quot;one&quot;, &quot;two&quot;, etc., in recording character counts. Autograms are also called &#x27;self-enumerating&#x27; or &#x27;self-documenting&#x27; sentences. Often, letter counts only are recorded while punctuation signs are ignored, as in this example:

The first autogram to be published was composed by Sallows in 1982 and appeared in Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s &quot;Metamagical Themas&quot; column in &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

The task of producing an autogram is perplexing because the object to be described cannot be known until its description is first complete.

==Self-enumerating pangrams==
A type of autogram that has attracted special interest is the autogramic pangram, a self-enumerating sentence in which every letter of the alphabet occurs at least once. Certain letters do not appear in either of the two autograms above, which are therefore not pangrams. The first ever self-enumerating pangram appeared in a Dutch newspaper and was composed by Rudy Kousbroek. Sallows, who lives in the Netherlands, was challenged by Kousbroek to produce a self-enumerating &#x27;translation&#x27; of this pangram into English—an impossible-seeming task. This prompted Sallows to construct an electronic Pangram Machine. Eventually the machine succeeded, producing the example below which was published in Scientific American in October 1984:

Sallows wondered if one could produce a pangram that counts its letters as percentages of the whole sentence–a particularly difficult task since such percentages usually won&#x27;t be exact integers. He mentioned the problem to Chris Patuzzo and in late 2015 Patuzzo produced the following solution:

Later in 2017, Matthias Belz decided to push the boundaries further by making a pangrammatic autogram with a precision of five decimal places:

However, no matter the precision of the rounding, the percentage of the letters used are still not exact. Therefore, in that same year Matthias Belz went on to create an pangrammatic autogram that uses exact percentages instead of rounded values:

A shorter exact percentage autogram can be formed if the pangrammatic property is elided:

==Generalizations==
Autograms exist that exhibit extra self-descriptive features. Besides counting each letter, here the total number of letters appearing is also named:

Just as an autogram is a sentence that describes itself, so there exist closed chains of sentences each of which describes its predecessor in the chain. Viewed thus, an autogram is such a chain of length 1. Here follows a chain of length 2:


==Reflexicons==
A special kind of autogram is the &#x27;reflexicon&#x27; (short for &quot;reflexive lexicon&quot;), which is a self-descriptive word list that describes its own letter frequencies. The constraints on reflexicons are much tighter than on autograms because the freedom to choose alternative words such as &quot;contains&quot;, &quot;comprises&quot;, &quot;employs&quot;, and so on, is lost. However, a degree of freedom still exists through appending entries to the list that are strictly superfluous.

For example, &quot;Sixteen e&#x27;s, six f&#x27;s, one g, three h&#x27;s, nine i&#x27;s, nine n&#x27;s, five o&#x27;s, five r&#x27;s, sixteen s&#x27;s, five t&#x27;s, three u&#x27;s, four v&#x27;s, one w, four x&#x27;s&quot; is a reflexicon, but it includes what Sallows calls &quot;dummy text&quot;, which is only having one of some letter. Dummy text are in the form &quot;one #&quot;, where &quot;#&quot; can be any typographical sign not already listed. Sallows has made an extensive computer search and conjectures that there exist only three pure (i.e., no dummy text) English reflexicons.


==Other variants==
There are many different variants to autograms. One such variant is by representing the letter frequencies using Roman numerals:

The frequency count can also be replaced with the decimal form rather than its corresponding English numeral form:

<text>(sometimes also translated as &quot;corporate bouncers&quot;, &quot;meeting-men&quot;, or &quot;corporate blackmailers&quot;) are specialized racketeers unique to Japan, and often associated with the yakuza, who extort money from or blackmail companies by threatening to publicly humiliate companies and their management, usually in their .

If a company does pay , the will work to prevent others from embarrassing the company, either through intimidation or by disrupting the meeting so they cannot be heard.

The number of has decreased over the years, and in 2023 there were only about 150 , of whom 30 worked in groups and 120 worked alone.

==History==
 originated in the late 19th century. At this time, the unlimited liability of the management put the managers&#x27; personal fortune at risk in case of rumors and scandals. Hence the management hired protection, called , to reduce the risk of such rumors. Even after the Japanese laws included a limited liability, hence reducing the personal risk to the managers, these continued to prosper, and were often used to quiet down otherwise difficult meetings. In that respect, they have even been compared to corporate lawyers in America.

In 1984, the law made first steps to reduce the threat from by establishing a minimum number of holdings (¥50,000) in order to be allowed into the shareholder meeting, leading to a slow decline of the number of . In response to this, the formed fake , announcing embarrassing company secrets, fictional or not, from loudspeakers mounted on trucks in order to extort money from companies.

In 1994, Juntarō Suzuki, vice president of Fujifilm, was murdered by after he stopped paying these bribes.

==Activities==

===Disrupting shareholder meetings===
Individual acquire enough stock from multiple companies in order to gain entrance to a shareholders&#x27; meeting. There, they disrupt the meeting (and embarrass the company) until their demands are met. For this, the often research the company in detail beforehand to uncover incidents of misconduct or other company secrets, and then blackmail the management so that these issues are not raised in the shareholder meeting or elsewhere. Often, they also invent fictional issues that the company would have difficulty disproving.

Modern have developed other, similar methods to accomplish their goals. One less subtle example is the , who disrupt business places with their cries of and praise of the Emperor until they are quietly paid to leave.

===Other disruption===
 also form fake groups, announcing embarrassing company secrets, fictional or not, from loudspeakers mounted on trucks in order to extort money from companies. They may also print special newspapers with topics embarrassing to companies, and then ask the company to buy the entire print at inflated prices, or even to subscribe to these newspapers, generating a steady flow of cash.

===Preventing disruption of shareholder meetings===
 have also been used by companies to drown out questions from legitimate shareholders which company officials do not want presented. One infamous case is related to Minamata disease (mercury poisoning), where the Chisso chemicals company managed to close a number of annual meetings within minutes, despite the presence of hundreds of protesters at the meetings. They have also been active against anti-war protesters and other people who may be viewed as a nuisance by the company at a particular time.

==Countermeasures==
Article 968 of the Japanese corporations code prohibits activity, imposing imprisonment of no more than five years or a fine of no more than ¥5 million for &quot;receiving, demanding or promising a proprietary benefit with regard to&quot; statements or the exercise of voting rights at a shareholder or creditor meeting.

A practical countermeasure used by large corporations is to hold all shareholder meetings on the same day, so cannot disrupt all of them.

==Background==
While in the West a shareholders&#x27; meeting is usually an earnest discussion between the shareholders and the management, in Japan it is often more of a ceremony, and the management does not feel the need to truly inform shareholders. In this atmosphere, the are able to prosper. However, with the trend for more deregulation in the Japanese market the business environment for is getting more and more difficult.

==Companies that have bribed ==
Major Japanese companies that have been found guilty of employing include but are not limited to:

*Mitsubishi, resulting in a number of arrests
*Daiwa Securities Group
*Nikko Securities
*Nomura Securities Co., with three top executive pleading guilty for multimillion-dollar payments. In this case, the sōkaiya actually owned enough stock to propose one of their choosing as a member for the board of directors.
*Nippon Shinpan, forcing the president Yoji Yamada into retirement after various executives paid up to ¥80 million to the subsequently arrested Kikuo Kondo of the Sumiyoshi-kai.
*Tokyo Electric Power Company
*Meiji Seika

<doc id="925525" wikidata="Q1330725" url="?curid=925525" title="U.K. (band)">
<text>U.K. were a British progressive rock supergroup originally active from 1977 to 1980. The band was founded by bass guitarist John Wetton and drummer Bill Bruford, formerly the rhythm section of King Crimson. The band was rounded out by violinist/keyboardist Eddie Jobson, and guitarist Allan Holdsworth. Bruford and Holdsworth left in 1978, and Bruford was replaced by drummer Terry Bozzio. Jobson, Wetton and Bozzio reformed U.K. for a world tour in 2012.

==History==
===Formation and first album===
In 1972, John Wetton (formerly of Family) and Bill Bruford (formerly of Yes) both joined King Crimson, recording three albums before guitarist Robert Fripp disbanded the group at the end of 1974. Wetton then spent a brief time with Roxy Music, who also included Eddie Jobson, before joining Uriah Heep for two albums. In July 1976, after leaving Uriah Heep, Wetton reconnected with Bruford, recording demos originally proposed for a Wetton solo album (two of these demos were later released on the compilation &quot;Monkey Business&quot; in 1998). In September 1976, they formed a band with keyboardist Rick Wakeman, who had previously worked with Bruford in Yes. The project was stopped after rehearsals, by Wakeman&#x27;s label. According to Bruford, &quot;A&amp;M Records were unwilling to let their &#x27;star&#x27;, Wakeman, walk off with a used, slightly soiled King Crimson rhythm section, and the idea failed&quot;.

Bruford and Wetton next approached Robert Fripp to reform King Crimson. When Fripp eventually declined, Bruford and Wetton decided that each would choose a musician in order to form a new band. Wetton brought in Eddie Jobson, who since leaving Roxy Music in 1976 had joined Frank Zappa&#x27;s band, thus &quot;stealing&quot; him from Zappa. Bruford recruited Allan Holdsworth (formerly of Soft Machine, Nucleus, Gong, Tempest and The Tony Williams Lifetime) who had played on Bruford&#x27;s debut solo album, &quot;Feels Good to Me&quot; (1978).

The band&#x27;s formation coincided with the introduction of the Yamaha CS-80 synthesizer, and this instrument became an integral part of their developing sound.

U.K. released their self-titled debut album in 1978 and followed it with a supporting tour. Following two lengthy American tours (June to October 1978), Wetton and Jobson decided to fire Holdsworth over musical differences, and since Bruford had indicated to Wetton that he would favour Holdsworth’s more improvisational approach in the event of a disagreement on the direction of the band, they lined up Terry Bozzio (another former Zappa band member) to replace Bruford. Bruford took several instrumentals with him that he had developed for the live U.K. repertoire (&quot;Forever Until Sunday&quot;, &quot;Sahara of Snow”), that he instead recorded with his solo band Bruford on his second album &quot;One of a Kind&quot; (1979).

===Trio line-up===
U.K. attempted unsuccessfully to find another guitarist before resolving to continue as a trio. They recorded the studio album &quot;Danger Money&quot;, released in March 1979, and spent much of that year touring North America as opening act for Jethro Tull. The album spawned a minor hit single, &quot;Nothing to Lose&quot;, which reached number 67 on the UK charts. A live album, &quot;Night After Night&quot;, was recorded in Japan that spring and released in September 1979. Following a final European tour in December 1979, and in spite of plans to record a new studio album in America in March 1980, U.K. disbanded as Jobson and Wetton had different ideas on how the band should develop. Jobson wanted UK to go on with more long instrumental pieces, while Wetton thought that performing shorter, more commercial songs was a better idea. Jobson stated that one particularly pop-oriented song contributed to the band dissolving: &quot;When Will You Realize&quot;, a non-LP B-side featured on the &quot;Night After Night&quot; single, which Wetton would re-record (with slightly different lyrics) in 1980 on his solo album &quot;Caught in the Crossfire&quot;.

===Aftermath===
Jobson worked with Jethro Tull on the album &quot;A&quot; (1980) and went on to a solo career. Wetton, following the recording of his solo album &quot;Caught in the Crossfire&quot; (summer 1980) and a brief stint with Wishbone Ash (October–December 1980), eventually left E.G. Records to sign with Geffen Records and ex-Yes manager Brian Lane and started Asia with Steve Howe, Carl Palmer and Geoffrey Downes. Bozzio formed Missing Persons with his then-wife Dale Bozzio, guitarist Warren Cuccurullo, bassist Patrick O&#x27;Hearn and Chuck Wild on keyboards– the first four also from line-ups with Zappa. Holdsworth and Bozzio played together in HoBoLeMa almost three decades later. John Wetton and Allan Holdsworth both died in 2017.

===Legacy project===
From 1995 to 1998, Jobson and Wetton worked together on a proposed U.K. reunion album, also recording contributions by Bruford, Tony Levin, Steve Hackett and Francis Dunnery. When Wetton departed, &quot;Legacy&quot; became an Eddie Jobson solo project, with Wetton replaced on vocals by Aaron Lippert. However, Jobson eventually abandoned this project. Three tracks intended for it were included on &quot;Voices of Life&quot;, a compilation by Bulgarian Women&#x27;s Choir organised by Jobson.

===UKZ and reunions===
In October 2007, Jobson announced a new band, UKZ, with Lippert and former King Crimson bassist/guitarist Trey Gunn among others, which released an EP called &quot;Radiation&quot; in March 2009. In late 2009, Jobson and Wetton both talked about a possible reunion of U.K. A reunion tour in February/March 2010 with Jobson, Wetton, Marco Minnemann on drums (from UKZ) and Greg Howe (Victor Wooten, Vitalij Kuprij, Michael Jackson) on guitar was described to promoters, but would not happen until 2011.

Wetton and Jobson performed three concerts in Poland in November 2009 as part of Jobson&#x27;s Ultimate Zero (U-Z) project. The line-up also featured Minnemann, Howe, and Tony Levin (stick). They performed music from UK and King Crimson. A CD compiled from various U-Z performances from 2009, entitled &quot;Ultimate Zero Tour - Live&quot;, including multiple tracks from the Polish shows, was then released.

It was announced on 11 February 2011, and later confirmed by John Wetton on his website, that U.K. had reformed to play two shows in Japan on 15 and 16 April 2011. The line-up was Jobson and Wetton, with Minnemann and Alex Machacek performing drums and guitar respectively. US dates, including a show in San Francisco, were also announced and performed in April 2011. A DVD called &quot;&quot; was culled from these shows and officially released in 2013.

Bozzio then rejoined for an American tour in 2012. The line-up for the subsequent European tour included additional musicians Gary Husband (drums) and a returning Alex Machacek on guitar.

In 2013, U.K. did an &quot;Azure Seas&quot; tour with Machacek once again taking on guitar duties, and an East Coast tour with Virgil Donati performing drumming duties in place of Bozzio, who had once again departed the band. On 8 November of the same year, the band did also a special concert performance of their two studio albums in Kawasaki, in Japan. The drummer for that special concert was Marco Minnemann.

U.K. appeared in the 2014 edition of &quot;Cruise to the Edge&quot; progressive rock festival. The line-up once again included both Machacek and Donati. In 2015 the band announced their final world tour, with the band being joined by Donati and Machacek. Donati was then replaced by then Dream Theater drummer Mike Mangini for the final dates in the USA and Japan.

==Musical style==
Throughout their brief existence, U.K.&#x27;s music was characterised by skilled musicianship, jazzy harmonies, close harmony vocals, mixed meters, electric violin solos, and unusually varied synthesiser (Yamaha CS-80) sonorities. Relative to specific styles, the band spans various genres ranging from progressive rock to jazz fusion.

<doc id="925527" wikidata="Q1128324" url="?curid=925527" title="Elections to the European Parliament">
<text>Elections to the European Parliament take place every five years by universal adult suffrage; with more than 400 million people eligible to vote, they are the second largest democratic elections in the world after India&#x27;s.

Until 2019, 751 MEPs were elected to the European Parliament, which has been directly elected since 1979. Since the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU in 2020, the number of MEPs, including the president, has been 705. No other EU institution is directly elected, with the Council of the European Union and the European Council being only indirectly legitimated through national elections. While European political parties have the right to campaign EU-wide for the European elections, campaigns still take place through national election campaigns, advertising national delegates from national parties.

The election days are 4 consecutive days, from Thursday to Sunday, between April 7th and July 10th. The latest election took place in 2024 and the next election will take place in 2029.

==Apportionment==

The allocation of seats to each member state is based on the principle of degressive proportionality, so that, while the size of the population of each country is taken into account, smaller states elect more MEPs than is proportional to their populations. As the numbers of MEPs to be elected by each country have arisen from treaty negotiations, there is no precise formula for the apportionment of seats among member states. No change in this configuration can occur without the unanimous consent of all governments.


==Voting system==

There is no uniform voting system for the election of MEPs; rather, each member state is free to choose its own system, subject to certain restrictions:
* The system must be a form of proportional representation, under either the party list or the single transferable vote system.
* The electoral area may be subdivided if this will not generally affect the proportional nature of the electoral system.
* The electoral threshold, if there is any, may not exceed 5%. From the 2024 election there might be a minimum threshold of between 2% and 5% for constituencies with more than 35 seats, if the Council Decision (EU, Euratom) 2018/994 of 13 July 2018 is approved by all EU states in accordance with their respective constitutional requirements.

===Voting difference by country===
Most of the member states of the European Union elect their MEPs with a single constituency covering the entire state, using party-list proportional representation. There is however a great variety of electoral procedures: some countries use a highest averages method of proportional representation, some use the largest remainder method, some open lists and others closed. In addition, the method of calculating the quota and the election threshold vary from country to country. Countries with multiple constituencies are:
* Belgium is split into three constituencies: the Dutch-speaking electoral college, the French-speaking electoral college, and the German-speaking electoral college. The first two of these elect their MEPs using party list PR, but the German-speaking constituency only has one member, who is therefore not elected using a proportional method.
* Ireland is split into three constituencies and uses the single transferable vote.
* The United Kingdom, historically up until its exit from the Union, was split into constituencies representing Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and each of the regions of England. Northern Ireland used the single transferable vote while the other constituencies used party lists. Before 1999, England, Scotland and Wales used first-past-the-post.

Germany, Italy and Poland use a different system, whereby parties are awarded seats based on their nationwide vote as in all of the states that elect members from a single constituency; these seats are given to the candidates on regional lists. With the number of seats for each party known, these are given to the candidates on the regional lists based on the number of votes from each region towards the party&#x27;s nationwide total, awarded proportionally to the regions. These subdivisions are not strictly constituencies, as they do not affect how many seats each party is awarded, but are districts that the members represent once elected. The number of members for each region is decided dynamically after the election, and depends on voter turnout in each region. A region with high turnout will result in more votes for the parties there, which will result in a greater number of MEPs elected for that region.

==European political parties==

The European Union has a multi-party system involving a number of ideologically diverse European political parties. As no single European party has ever gained power alone, their affiliated parliamentary groups in the European Parliament work together to pass legislation. Since no pan-European government is formed as a result of European elections, long-term coalitions no do exist.

European parties have the exclusive right to campaign for the European elections; their parliamentary groups are strictly forbidden to campaign and to spend funds on any campaign-related activity. Campaign activities differ per member state since national elections for European Parliament representatives are governed by national law. For instance, a European party may buy unlimited advertising airtime in Estonia, while it is barred from any form of paid advertising in Sweden.

Ahead of the 2014 European elections, European political parties decided to put forward candidates for President of the European Commission, also known as &quot;Spitzenkandidaten&quot; or &quot;lead candidates&quot;. Each lead candidate led the pan-European campaign of its European party. Even though there is no legal obligation on the European Council to propose the lead candidate of the strongest party to the European Parliament as its nominee for President of the Commission, it was assumed that the Council would accept voters&#x27; decision. Indeed, following the victory of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) in the 2014 European elections, its lead candidate Jean-Claude Juncker was nominated by the Council and later approved by the European Parliament. However, following the 2019 European elections, the Council nominated Ursula von der Leyen instead of the EPP&#x27;s lead candidate, Manfred Weber; the European Parliament later approved this nomination.

The two largest European political parties are the centre-right European People&#x27;s Party and the centre-left Party of European Socialists (PES). They also form the two largest parliamentary groups, the EPP Group and S&amp;D, along with national parties not members of the European parties but represented in the European Parliament. 

There are numerous other European parties and groups, spanning the entire political spectrum. Sometimes, two or more European parties sit in the same group, such as members of the European Green Party and of the European Free Alliance sitting together in the Greens–European Free Alliance group. Members of the European Parliament who are not members of a parliamentary group are known as &quot;non-inscrits&quot;.


==Voter behaviour==

A 1980 analysis by Karlheinz Reif and Hermann Schmitt concluded that European elections were fought on national issues and used by voters to punish their governments mid-term, making European Parliament elections de facto national elections of second rank. This phenomenon is also referred to by some experts as the &quot;punishment traps&quot;, wherein voters use the European Parliament elections and other European integration referendums as punishment for governments on account of bad economic performance. There is also a study that showed how voters tend to choose candidates of a party at the European level if it has a history of advancing specific issues that they care about. This is related to the second theory that explains voter behavior and it involves the so-called attitude voting in which voters are assumed to be acting on the basis of their attitude towards the European integration. This is analogous to the American two-party system in the sense that voting on issues and legislation in the Parliament only requires a yes or no vote, which means voters vote for options or candidates that are close to their ideals.

Turnout had constantly fallen in every EU election from 1979 until 2014. The 2019 election, however, saw turnout increase to its highest level since 1994, at 51%. In 2009, the overall turnout was at 43%, down from 45.5% in 2004. In Britain the turnout was just 34.3%, down from 38% in 2004.
Despite falling below 50% between 1999 and 2014, turnout was not as low as that of the US Midterm elections, which usually falls below 40%. However, the comparison with the US voter turnout is hampered due to the fact that the US president is elected in separate and direct elections (presidential system), whereas the President of the European Commission is elected by the European Parliament (parliamentary system), giving the European Parliament elections considerable weight. Some, such as former President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, have also noted that turnout in the 1999 election was higher than the previous US presidential election. German MEP Jo Leinen has suggested that EU parties name their top candidate for the position of President of the European Commission in order to increase turnout. This happened for the 2014 election, with EPP candidate Jean Claude Juncker ultimately selected, after the EPP won the most seats overall.

As of 2024, Bulgaria&#x27;s (GERB, Croatia&#x27;s (HDZ), Cyprus (DISY), Germany&#x27;s (CDU/CSU), Hungary&#x27;s (Fidesz), Malta&#x27;s (Labour Party) and Sweden (Swedish Social Democratic have won every EU election.

==Proposed reforms==

The final report of the Conference on the Future of Europe includes more than 320 proposed measures to reform the European Union. It proposes amending EU electoral law to harmonise electoral conditions (voting age, election date, requirements for electoral districts, candidates, political parties and their financing) for the European Parliament elections, as well as moving towards voting for Union-wide lists, or &#x27;transnational lists&#x27;, with candidates from multiple member states. It also recommends facilitating digital voting possibilities and guaranteeing effective voting rights for persons with disabilities. The report states that European citizens should have a greater say on who is elected President of the European Commission, suggesting this could be achieved either by the direct election of the Commission President or by a lead candidate system.

==Commission President==
The third Delors Commission had a short mandate, to bring the terms of the Commission in line with that of the Parliament. Under the European Constitution the European Council would have to take into account the results of the latest European elections and, furthermore, the Parliament would ceremonially &quot;elect&quot;, rather than simply approve, the council&#x27;s proposed candidate. This was taken as the parliament&#x27;s cue to have its parties run with candidates for the President of the European Commission with the candidate of the winning party being proposed by the council.

This was partly put into practice in 2004 when the European Council selected a candidate from the political party that won that year&#x27;s election. However at that time only one party had run with a specific candidate: the European Green Party, who had the first true pan-European political party with a common campaign, put forward Daniel Cohn-Bendit. However the fractious nature of the other political parties led to no other candidates, the People&#x27;s Party only mentioned four or five people they&#x27;d like to be president. The Constitution failed ratification but these amendments have been carried over to the Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force in 2009.

There are plans to strengthen the European political parties in order for them to propose candidates for the 2009 election. The European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party have already indicated, in their October 2007 congress, their intention for forward a candidate for the post as part of a common campaign. They failed to do so however the European People&#x27;s Party did select Barroso as their candidate and, as the largest party, Barroso&#x27;s term was renewed. The Socialists, disappointed at the 2009 election, agreed to put forward a candidate for Commission President at all subsequent elections. There is a campaign within that party to have open primaries for said candidate.

In February 2008, President Barroso admitted there was a problem in legitimacy and that, despite having the same legitimacy as Prime Ministers in theory, in practice it was not the case. The low turnout creates a problem for the President&#x27;s legitimacy, with the lack of a &quot;European political sphere&quot;, but analysis claim that if citizens were voting for a list of candidates for the post of president, turn out would be much higher than that seen in recent years.

The President of the European Parliament Jerzy Buzek proposed in 2010 that Commissioners be directly elected, by member states placing their candidate at the top of their voting lists in European elections. That would give them individually, and the body as a whole, a democratic mandate.

==Eligibility==

Each Member State has different rules determining who can vote for and run as the European Parliamentary candidates. In &quot;Spain v United Kingdom&quot;, the European Court of Justice held that member states are permitted to extend the franchise to non-EU citizens.

Every EU citizen residing in an EU country of which they are not a national has the right to vote and to stand as a candidate in European Parliamentary elections in their country of residence, under the same conditions as nationals of that country – this right is enshrined in Article 39 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. In addition, the right to vote is included in Articles 20(1) and 22(1) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. To this extent all EU countries keep electoral registers containing the names of all eligible voters in the specific region, to which eligible newcomers to the area can apply at any time to have their names added. EU citizens are then eligible to vote for the duration of their stay in that country.

It is therefore possible for a person to have the choice of voting in more than one EU member state. For example, a Portuguese citizen who studies at university in France and lives at home outside term-time in the family home in the Netherlands has the option of voting in the European Parliamentary election in France, Portugal or the Netherlands. In this scenario, although the Portuguese citizen qualifies to vote in three EU member states, they are only permitted to cast one vote in one of the member states.


==Opinion polling==

Opinion polling for EU Parliament elections is less common than for national parliament elections, and no polls are available on the aggregate level. Europe Elects introduced a monthly seat projection based on publicly available polling data in 2014. This was complemented in 2019 by a popular vote projection based on EU parliament groups.

<doc id="925530" wikidata="Q1252747" url="?curid=925530" title="Elections in Croatia">
<text>Regular elections in Croatia are mandated by the Constitution and legislation enacted by Parliament. The presidency, Parliament, county prefects and assemblies, city and town mayors, and city and municipal councils are all elective offices. Since 1990, seven presidential elections have been held. During the same period, ten parliamentary elections (with two for the upper house when the parliament was bicameral) were also held. In addition, there were nine nationwide local elections. Croatia has also held three elections to elect members of the European Parliament following its accession to the EU on 1 July 2013.

The President of Croatia is elected for a five-year term by a direct vote of all citizens in a majority system, requiring runoff elections if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of votes in the first round. Members of Parliament are elected for a four-year term in ten multi-seat constituencies, with additional members elected in special constituencies reserved for the Croatian diaspora and national minorities. As of July 2020, legislation provides for the election of 151 members of the unicameral parliament (including three representatives of the Croatian diaspora and eight representatives of national minorities). Out of 31 political parties which won seats in Croatian parliamentary elections held since 1990, only six have won ten seats or more in any one parliamentary election. Those were the Croatian Democratic Union, the Croatian Peasant Party, the Croatian People&#x27;s Party – Liberal Democrats, the Croatian Social Liberal Party, Social Democratic Party of Croatia and The Bridge. The county prefects, city/town mayors and municipality presidents are elected for four-year term by a majority of votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority in the first round of voting. Members of county, city/town and municipal councils are elected for a four-year term through proportional representation, with the entire local government unit as a single constituency.

Any Croatian citizen over age 18 may be a candidate in presidential, parliamentary or local government elections, provided that a sufficient number of endorsements by Croatian voters is obtained beforehand. Croatian elections are relatively well-regulated; regulations include spending limits, annual donation limits, a limitation on the number of endorsed candidates and election lists and regulations governing media coverage. Voting takes place in polling stations in Croatia and abroad, monitored by an electoral board and observers at each station. Ballots consist of an alphabetical list of candidates, or an election list with ordinal numbers (which are circled to indicate a vote). All votes are counted by hand. The State Electoral Commission publishes official results and handles complaints, supported by county, city and town electoral commissions during local elections. Decisions of the electoral commissions may be appealed at the Constitutional Court of Croatia.

==Parliamentary elections==
The Parliament of Croatia () consists of 151 members elected to four-year terms in twelve constituencies. Out of that number, 140 are elected in ten multi-seat territorial constituencies. These are defined on the basis of the existing county borders, with necessary amendments to achieve a uniform number of eligible voters in each constituency (plus or minus five percent). The eleventh constituency is for citizens of Croatia living abroad; the number of seats held by this constituency was fixed at three for the parliamentary election held in December 2011. The 2010 constitutional amendments abolished the former scheme, in which the number of MPs elected from the eleventh constituency was proportional to the ratio to the number of ballots cast in the other ten constituencies. In the 2007 general election, this method led to the eleventh constituency electing five MPs.

The standard d&#x27;Hondt formula is applied to the vote (except for the twelfth constituency in which national minority representatives are elected), with a five-percent election threshold in each constituency. Since 2015, the parliamentary elections have an element of preferential voting by letting voters choose not only for a list of candidates, but also a single member of the same list. If the percentage of votes for a candidate exceeds 10%, they are elected as if it was an open list system. The list ranking is maintained for those candidates that do not meet this quota.
An additional eight members of the parliament are elected from the twelfth constituency. It encompasses the entire country; candidates in this constituency are elected by voters belonging to 22 recognized minorities in Croatia: the Serb minority elects three MPs, the Hungarians and Italians elect one MP each, the Czech and Slovak minorities jointly elect one MP, and all other minorities elect the final two MPs. Minority MPs are elected by simple plurality system (candidates with the most votes are elected). The nationality of the voters is listed in the voter registry, which is provided by the registrar&#x27;s office that maintains Croatia&#x27;s vital records. Voter nationalities are normally officially declared by the parents at birth, but any citizen may declare or change that information later on at the registrar&#x27;s office at least 14 days ahead of elections (not at the polling station). The voter&#x27;s nationality need not be declared or may be declared as unknown. During elections, voters who have officially declared they belong to one of the recognized minorities in Croatia may choose to vote for either a territorially applicable list or a corresponding national minority list; a voter of unknown or non-declared nationality may vote for either a territorially applicable list or any minority list; a voter who has declared a nationality other than Croat or a recognized minority may vote only for a territorially applicable list (the same as someone who has declared themselves a Croat). Minority voting and minority representation rules have raised controversy and were eventually upheld by the Constitutional Court.

An election silence is enforced on the day before and the day of the elections, ending at 7:00 pm when the polling stations close and the exit polls are published.

Although political parties fund their campaigns using donations or their own assets, the government reimburses them for each parliamentary seat won. For instance, each seat won in the 2011 parliamentary election brought a party 180,000 kuna ( euros). Smaller sums were paid to parties or candidates failing to win any parliamentary seats, provided that they received more than five percent of the votes cast in a constituency.

===2024 parliamentary election===

===Next parliamentary election===
&quot;See article&quot;: Next Croatian parliamentary election

Parliamentary elections are to be held no later than 60 days after the expiration of the 4-year parliamentary term, counting from the day that parliament is constituted with the election of a Speaker or no later than 60 days after the dissolution of parliament by vote of MPs. The 11th Assembly of Parliament was constituted on 16 May 2024.

===Previous parliamentary elections===

Since 1990, fourteen parliamentary elections have been held in Croatia. These have included the 1990 elections for a tricameral parliament, three elections of the Chamber of Deputies during the bicameral parliament&#x27;s existence, seven elections of the unicameral Parliament and two elections of the Chamber of Counties—the upper house of the bicameral parliament.

The elections held in 1990 were the first multi-party elections after 45 years of Communist rule; candidates vied for all 80 seats in the Social-Political Council of Croatia, all 116 seats in the Municipalities Council of Croatia and all 160 seats in the Associated Labour Council of Croatia (since Parliament had three chambers at the time). The first round of the election saw a turnout of 85.5 percent, and the runoff-election turnout was 74.8 percent. The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) won 205 seats, and the League of Communist of Croatia won 107.

====Previous Chamber of Deputies and unicameral Sabor elections====
Nine parliamentary elections have been held since for the Chamber of Deputies () or the unicameral parliament since then—in 1992, 1995, 2000, 2003, 2007, 2011, 2015, 2016, 2020. Beginning with the 1992 elections, the number of seats in the Chamber of Deputies (and, later, in the unicameral parliament) was significantly changed—ranging from 127 in 1995 to 153 in 2007 and 151 in 2011. In the Croatian parliamentary elections held since 1992, when the number of seats in parliament was limited below 160, only six parties have won ten seats or more in any single election: the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS), the Croatian People&#x27;s Party – Liberal Democrats (HNS), the Croatian Social Liberal Party (HSLS) and the Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP), The Bridge(Most).

Several other political parties (besides the HDZ, HSS, HNS, HSLS, Most and SDP) have won parliamentary seats since the 1990 election. Those are (in alphabetical order): the Alliance of Primorje-Gorski Kotar (previously known as the Rijeka Democratic Alliance), the Croatian Christian Democratic Union, the Croatian Citizen Party, the Croatian Democratic Alliance of Slavonia and Baranja, the Croatian Democratic Peasant Party, the Croatian Independent Democrats, the Croatian Party of Pensioners, the Croatian Party of Rights, the Croatian Party of Rights dr. Ante Starčević, Dalmatian Action, the Democratic Centre, the Istrian Democratic Assembly, the Liberal Party, the Party of Liberal Democrats, the Serb Democratic Party, the Slavonia-Baranja Croatian Party and the Social Democratic Action of Croatia.
The following parties have won the special seats reserved for national minority representatives (also in alphabetical order): the Bosnian Democratic Party of Croatia, the Democratic Union of Hungarians of Croatia, the German People&#x27;s Union – National Association of Danube Swabians in Croatia, the Independent Democratic Serb Party, the Party of Democratic Action of Croatia and the Serb People&#x27;s Party.
In addition, numerous independents have won seats through party lists, and Ivan Grubišić&#x27;s nonpartisan list won seats as a territorial election list. Since the parliamentary seats won belong to individuals, not parties, there have been instances where members have become independent or switched to another political party.

*In the first multi-party elections in 1990 three parliamentary chambers were elected in a two-round majoritarian system: the Social-Political Council, the Council of Municipalities and the Council of Associated Labour. Turnout for the election each chamber varied. It was as follows: Social-Political council (84.5% in first round in all constituencies, 74.82% in second round in 51 of 80 constituencies), Council of Municipalities (84.1% in first round, 74.6% in second round) and Council of Associated Labour (76.5% in first round in all constituencies, 66% in second round in 103 of 160 constituencies).

====Chamber of Counties elections====

Under the Constitution of Croatia adopted in 1990, the Parliament of Croatia became bicameral. The Chamber of Deputies had been elected a few months earlier, and its members enacted legislation creating a new territorial organisation of Croatia. This included 21 counties that were to be represented by the new Chamber of Counties (). The first election of members to the chamber was held on 7 February 1993, with each county acting as a multi-seat constituency; three MPs were elected in each county on the basis of proportional representation. In addition, the President of Croatia appointed up to 5 more members of the Chamber of the Counties to complete its 68-strong membership. The second election for the Chamber of Counties was held on 13 April 1997. The Chamber of Deputies was abolished by a constitutional amendment in 2001.

==Presidential elections==

The President of Croatia (officially the President of the Republic, ) is elected to a five-year term by a direct vote of all citizens, with a majority vote required to win. A runoff election is held if no candidate secures a majority in the first round. The presidential elections are regulated by the constitution and dedicated legislation; however, the latter only defines technical details, appeals and similar issues. Any citizen of Croatia, 18 or older, may be a candidate in a presidential election if the candidate is endorsed by 10,000 voters. The endorsements are required in the form of a list containing name, address, personal identification number and voter signature. The presidential elections are regulated by an act of parliament. Election silence is in force on the day of the elections and the previous day, ending at 7 in the evening as polling stations close; exit polls may be published after that time.
Unless the presidential term is cut short by death, resignation or removal from office, resulting in an early election, the elections for President of the Republic are scheduled to take place every 5 years, with the incumbent having a possibility of re-election. The president is currently term limited to two 5-year terms.

===2024–25 presidential election===

===Next presidential election===

The next presidential election in Croatia is due to be held no more than 60 and no less than 30 days before the expiry of the incumbent president&#x27;s term, as stated in the Constitution of Croatia. If the current president serves out his full term, which began on 19 February 2020 and lasts for 5 years, the election must be held on a date between 21 December 2024 and 20 January 2025.

After his victory in the 2024-25 election, 5th president Zoran Milanović became the 3rd president to be elected to a 2nd term in office. The only candidates eligible to run for a second presidential term are former presidents Ivo Josipović and Kolinda Grabar Kitarović. Both narrowly lost re-election in their respective campaign, with Josipović losing to Grabar Kitarović in 2015, and Grabar Kitarović losing to Zoran Milanović in 2020. Both are therefore eligible for a second term.

===Previous presidential elections===
Presidential elections were held in Croatia for the first time on 2 August 1992, concurrently with the 1992 parliamentary elections. Voter turnout was 74.9 percent. The result was a victory for Franjo Tuđman of the HDZ, who received 57.8 percent of the vote in the first round of the election (ahead of seven other candidates). Dražen Budiša, the HSLS candidate and runner-up in the election, received 22.3 percent of the vote. The second presidential election in modern Croatia was held on 15 June 1997. The incumbent, Franjo Tuđman, ran opposed by Zdravko Tomac (candidate of the SDP) and Vlado Gotovac (nominated by the HSLS). Tomac and Gotovac received 21.0 and 17.6 percent of votes, respectively, in the first round of voting and Tuđman secured another term. The third presidential elections were held on 24 January 2000 to fill the office of President, after incumbent Franjo Tuđman died on 10 December 1999. The first round of voting saw Stjepan Mesić (candidate of the Croatian People&#x27;s Party, or HNS) in front with 41.3 percent of the vote, followed by Dražen Budiša of the HSLS with 27.8 percent and Mate Granić (nominated by the HDZ) receiving 22.6 percent. The runoff election (the first in a modern Croatian presidential election) was held on 7 February; Mesić won, picking up 56.9 percent of the vote. Voter turnout was 63.0 percent in the first round, and 60.9 percent in the runoff. The first round of the fourth presidential election was held on 2 January 2005. No candidate secured a first-round victory; however, incumbent Mesić enjoyed a substantial lead over the other candidates. Mesić received 48.9 percent of the vote; the second- and third-ranked candidates (Jadranka Kosor of the HDZ and Boris Mikšić, an independent) managed only 20.3 and 17.8 percent, respectively, of voter support. Ultimately, Mesić won reelection by receiving 65.9 percent of votes in the runoff held on 16 January. The fifth presidential election was held on 27 December 2009 with Ivo Josipović (SDP) picking up 32.4 percent of the vote, followed by Milan Bandić (independent), Andrija Hebrang (HDZ) and Nadan Vidošević (independent) receiving 14.8, 12.0 and 11.3 percent of the vote respectively. The second round of voting was held on 10 January 2010, when Josipović defeated Bandić with 60.3 percent of the vote. The sixth presidential election was held on 28 December 2014 and saw only four candidates of which none have won majority. In the first round incumbent Ivo Josipović won most of votes in front of second Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović (HDZ) and third Ivan Vilibor Sinčić (ŽZ). The second round was held on 11 January 2015 with Grabar Kitarović closely wins in front of Josipović who become first Croatian president who was not re-elected. The most recent Croatian presidential election was held on 22 December 2019 and 5 January 2020. First round saw 11 candidates running for presidency, three of which has won more than 20% of votes each, what makes it the closest run among top three Zoran Milanović (29.55), Kolinda Grabar Kitarović (26.55) and Miroslav Škoro (24.45). In the second round a battle between incumbent Kolinda Grabar Kitarović and ex-prime minister Zoran Milanović(SDP) was held as Milanović won by the margin of more than 5 p.p.

==Local elections==

Croatia&#x27;s county prefects, city and town mayors are elected to four-year terms by a majority of votes cast within applicable local government units, with a runoff election if no candidate achieves a majority in the first round of voting. Members of county, city and municipal councils are elected to four-year terms through proportional representation, with the entire local government unit as a single constituency. The number of council members is defined by the councils themselves, based on applicable legislation. Electoral committees are tasked with determining whether the national minorities are represented in the council (as required by the constitution), adding further members to the council (who belong to the appropriate minorities) by selecting them from unelected-candidate lists. Election silence, as in all other elections in Croatia, is enforced on the day of the elections and the previous day, ending at 7:00 pm when the polling stations close and exit polls may be announced.

Number of seats in each county, city or municipality is defined by the Law on Local and Regional Self-Government and depends on their population.


Of the nine nationwide local elections held in Croatia since 1990, the most recent were the 2021 local elections to elect county prefects and councils, city and town councils and mayors. In these elections, HDZ-led coalitions won a 13 county-prefects, SDP-led coalitions won two county-prefects while the one was taken by Možemo, IDS and Mreža each and three were independent. In elections for city mayors 56 were won by HDZ candidates, 29 was independent and 22 was from SDP, while rest of 21 mayors are won by some of other 13 parties.

===National Minorities Councils and Representatives Elections===
National Minorities Councils are bodies that enable national minorities participation in public life and management of local affairs. Elections for councils and representatives are regulated by the Constitutional Act on the Rights of National Minorities in the Republic of Croatia and the Law on Election of Councils and Representatives of National Minorities. National minorities are electing municipal and county councils or representatives depending on relative and absolute minority population. Councils are elected in municipalities and cities in which minority population constitute at least 1,5% of the total population and there is at least 200 members of certain minority group. County councils are elected if there is more than 500 members of certain minority in a given Croatian county. Units with smaller numbers of members of certain minority, but in which there is still 100 or more members of given minority are electing minority representatives. 10 members are elected into municipal minority councils, 15 into city councils and 25 into county councils.

Minority elections are called by decision of the Government of the Republic of Croatia. The State Election Commission is proposing to the government the fees for the work of the members of the electoral bodies. Bodies responsible for the implementation of the elections are the State Election Commission, county election commissions, the Election Commission of the City of Zagreb, town and municipal election commissions and polling boards.

==European Parliament elections==

Croatia first elected 12 members of the European Parliament (MEPs) in a by-election held after its accession to the EU in 2013. Thereafter, its number of members in the European Parliament was reduced to 11 and the country elected them as part of the regular election in 2014. Reallocation of seats followed Brexit so Croatia have returned to 12 seates in 2019 elections. The elections are regulated by special legislation enacted by the &quot;Sabor&quot;. Provisions of the legislation are very similar to the parliamentary-election legislation, with the main difference being that the 12 members of the European Parliament are elected in a single constituency encompassing all of Croatia, instead of multiple constituencies used in the parliamentary elections.

==Referendums==
A referendum in Croatia can be called by the Parliament or the President on any issue falling within the purview of parliament, or on any other issue the president considers important to the independence, unity and existence of the republic. Since the constitution was amended in 2001, parliament is obligated by the constitution to call for a referendum if signatures of 10 percent of registered Croatian voters are collected. The signatures, by law, must be collected within a 15-day period. Referendums are regulated by Article 87 of the constitution of Croatia which requires that the parliament passes an act on each referendum and that the outcome is binding unless the referendum is called as an advisory referendum.

There have been three referendums in modern Croatia: Croatian independence referendum, Croatian European Union membership referendum and Marriage definition referendum, and in all three majority voted in favor. There have been four other public initiatives to collect the support of 10 percent of voters for a referendum, none of which were successful: concerning Croatian cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, concerning accession of Croatia to NATO in 2008, concerning Arbitration Agreement on Croatian-Slovenian border issues in 2009, and concerning Labour Act in 2010.

==Political campaigns==

Any Croatian citizen aged 18 or over may become a candidate in presidential, parliamentary or local elections. In order to become an official candidate, 10,000 signatures from Croatian citizens aged 18 or over must be collected and submitted to the State Electoral Commission. This must be done within 12 days following the publication of the decision to hold elections in Narodne Novine, the official gazette of the Republic of Croatia. The endorsements are made in a list comprising name, address and personal identification number (PIN) of each of the citizens supporting a particular candidate. Each citizen may only endorse a single candidate. The election commission verifies the endorsement lists, publishes the candidate list in all daily newspapers in Croatia (and on Croatian Radiotelevision) and delivers it to the Croatian diplomatic missions for publication.

In parliamentary elections, 14-member election lists may be submitted to the State Electoral Commission for any number of constituencies in Croatia. A 14-member list of candidates may also be submitted for the Croatian diaspora constituency, while a two-member list can be submitted for the ethnic-minority representatives. In each case, 500 endorsements are required for an election list to become valid. The lists may be supported by one or more political parties, or by a group of voters as an independent list. No one may be a candidate on two or more lists simultaneously.

The same procedure applies to local elections, except that council-election lists require 100, 150 and 500 endorsements for town, city and county-council lists respectively. The city of Zagreb council is treated as a county council under election law. The number of voter signatures on mayoral and county prefect candidate nominations ranges between 50 (for mayoral elections in towns of up to 1,000 residents), 100 (for other town mayoral candidates), 500 (for mayoral elections in cities of up to 35,000 residents), 1,000 (in cities with populations between 35,000 and 100,000) and 2,000 endorsements for cities of 100,000 residents or more (with the exception of Zagreb). County prefect election candidates require 2,500 endorsements, and candidates running for mayor of Zagreb need 5,000 voter endorsements for their nominations to become valid.

Candidates running for European Parliament seats need not be Croatian citizens and may hold citizenship in any member state of the European Union, while having a permanent (or temporary) residence in Croatia. Their nominations are valid if endorsed by 5,000 Croatian voters.

===Funding===
The funding of political parties, independent politicians and election campaigns is relatively highly regulated in comparison with developed western democracies. Applicable legislation encompasses cash receipts, provision of free services (except the labour of volunteers), and products and other forms of support (including membership fees). The legislation also stipulates that the government budget provides funding for political parties and non-partisan political representatives in the amount of 0.05 percent of the previous year&#x27;s budget expenditures. Additional funds are appropriated in local government budgets. The funds are distributed to elected members of parliament and councils, and the political parties with which they are affiliated receive 10 percent of the funds. Each election candidate (or slate) must have a dedicated bank account to handle election-campaign donations, other related funding, and all campaign-related expenditures. The maximum donation to a single party, candidate or slate made in a year is also regulated. In cases of individuals it is set at 30,000 kuna ( 4,050 euro), regardless of purpose. Companies and other legal persons are limited to the same amount in local elections; 100,000 kuna ( 13,500 euro) for parliamentary or European Parliament elections and 200,000 kuna ( 27,000 euro) for presidential elections to any one candidate, party or slate (whichever is applicable). Total campaign expenditures are also limited to 8 million kuna ( 1.08 million euro) per candidate in presidential elections, 1.5 million kuna ( 202,000 euro) per candidate (or slate) in European Parliament or parliamentary elections, 500,000 kuna ( 67,600 euro) per candidate in Zagreb mayoral elections and 400,000 kuna ( 54,000 euro) per candidate in county-prefect or mayoral elections in cities of 35,000 residents or larger and in county seats. Mayoral election-campaign expenditures in other cities and towns is also limited, depending on the local government&#x27;s population: 250,000 kuna ( 33,800 euro) if the population exceeds 10,000 residents, 100,000 kuna ( 13,500 euro) in population units of 3,000–10,000 and up to 50,000 kuna ( 6,750 euro) in smaller self-governing units. All candidates and parties (or slates) are legally required to publish financial reports detailing their funding, which are audited by the State Electoral Commission and the State Audit Office. They are also legally required to turn over all receipts exceeding the legal limits in favour of the central government budget within eight days.

In the 2007 parliamentary elections, the leading political parties reported campaign spending as follows: the Croatian Democratic Union spent 19.5 million kuna ( euro), the Social Democratic Party of Croatia spent 15.8 million kuna ( euro), the Croatian People&#x27;s Party – Liberal Democrats spent 9 million kuna ( euro), while the Croatian Peasant Party led coalition reported spending 8 million kuna ( euro) and the Croatian Party of Rights spent a similar amount.

All presidential election candidates receiving at least 10 percent of the vote are awarded an equal sum as election-campaign reimbursement. The amount is decided by the government at least 30 days before the election. This amount was set at 250,000 kuna ( euro) for the 2009–2010 presidential election, representing a 50-percent decrease from the sum determined for the previous presidential election (when the reimbursement sum was set at half-a-million kuna). Similarly, the government also reimburses the political parties and slates for each parliamentary seat won. For the 2011 parliamentary election, each seat will be given 180,000 kuna ( euro). A sum of 30,000 kuna ( euro) will be paid to parties or candidates failing to win any parliamentary seats if they receive more than five percent of votes in a constituency. In addition, national-minority-representative candidates running on the minority ballot failing to win parliamentary seats (but still winning at least 15 percent of votes in their constituency) will receive 27,000 kuna ( euro) if the minority comprises less than 1.5 percent of the total population of Croatia. All European Parliament election candidates and county-prefect and mayoral-election candidates receiving at least 10 percent of the vote are also entitled to receive reimbursement of costs in an amount determined by the government ahead of each election.

===Media coverage and promotion===

Legislation requires that all presidential and parliamentary election candidates (or slates) are guaranteed equal opportunity to present and discuss their platforms in the media (in addition to paid advertising). In 2007 the parliamentary election campaign was covered by all media, including nationwide television broadcasters. During this period the broadcasters, which included Croatian Radiotelevision (HTV), RTL Televizija (RTL) and Nova TV, aired 27.8 hours of news on 22 different programs with 1,196 news reports. This total included 171 reports dealing directly with the elections. Analysis of news coverage indicated evenly-matched coverage of the combined ruling party (HDZ) and official government statements on one side, and the main opposition party (SDP) on the other; each received an average of a 37.5-percent share of coverage and a 33-percent share of interviews aired. HTV and Nova TV gave a slight advantage to the HDZ and the government, while RTL gave more coverage to the SDP. However, the differences were small and resulted in matching ratios. Other political parties received considerably less coverage. HNS received an average of approximately 11 percent of the coverage, HSS received six percent and all other parties received less than five-percent coverage. The national television broadcasters air programs where all slates and candidates may talk about their platforms and organise debates.

Paid promotion largely followed this pattern, as the HDZ and the SDP were two dominant parties in that field as well. The Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) noted in its report that the largest parties reported their advertising spending below their actual value, and the largest proportion of expenditure was for television ads. Election silence is in force on the day of the elections and the previous day, ending at 7 in the evening as polling stations close and exit polls may be published after that time.

==Voting and appeals==
Polling stations are set up in public buildings throughout the country; voters may only vote at their assigned polling station (according to their permanent residence), but voters deployed abroad in the armed forces, voters on Croatian-flagged ships and imprisoned voters are allowed to vote elsewhere. Other voters residing in Croatia, but traveling abroad on election day may vote at Croatian diplomatic missions. Polling stations are open from 7:00 am until 7:00 pm, but all voters present at the polling stations at closing time are allowed to vote. Polling stations may be closed early if all registered voters have voted. Presidential election ballots contain a list of candidates verified by the State Electoral Commission, in alphabetical order. This entails the name and PIN of each candidate, and the names of political parties endorsing the candidate (or a note that the candidate is running as an independent). The names are preceded by ordinal numbers. Parliamentary election and European Parliament election ballots contain the name of the slate and the name of the person heading the list, in addition to candidates, who is not necessarily a candidate on the particular list, but may be included as a figurehead symbolizing specific political party or a coalition putting forward the list—usually head of the party of coalition at the national level. The lists are in alphabetical order and preceded by an ordinal number. Voting is done by circling the number associated with a particular candidate. Ballots marked otherwise (but positively indicating a candidate for which a vote is cast) are also considered valid. Blank ballots and ballots on which multiple numbers are circled (or multiple candidates are otherwise indicated) are invalid. Official results are announced and published by the State Electoral Commission.

===Voter registry===
The register of voters in Croatia is defined by law. The register lists all citizens of Croatia aged 18 and over, except those who have been stripped of their voting rights by a court decision. The register is organized according to legal residence () and maintained by government offices in counties and the city of Zagreb. Each citizen of Croatia may request a review of the register and amendments to personal information (supported by applicable documents). The voter register is used to confirm the right to vote at the polling station and to verify voter endorsements of candidates and election lists submitted to the electoral commissions. Voters who expect to travel in Croatia or abroad on election day may require inclusion in a provisional list which allows them to vote at a polling station other than that assigned to them by residence. Failing that, a voter may obtain an excerpt from the registry on election day to be allowed to vote.

A pattern of irregularities has been discovered concerning the updating of the list when citizens of Croatia turn 18 or die. In 2005, it was estimated that the register contained a large number of irregularities and erroneous entries. Since then, public attention was directed to the issue by NGOs monitoring elections through roundtables and advertising campaigns; according to GONG—a NGO specializing in election monitoring—although the register was improved, there is room for further improvement. The 2011 census also indicated a large number of voters in the registry who should not be there, leading to claims that up to a half-million voters in the registry should not be included.

===Complaints and appeals===

Political parties, candidates and voters who have endorsed a particular candidate (or state) in presidential, parliamentary or European Parliament elections may file complaints with the State Electoral Commission regarding irregularities in the election process within 48 hours of a disputed activity. In the European Parliament elections, voter complaints are required to be endorsed by at least 100 voters (or five percent of the voters). If the commission finds the complaint valid, it will order the part of the election process directly affected by the disputed activity to be repeated (possibly postponing the election date if there is insufficient time left). The commission must provide its decision within 48 hours after the complaint is submitted. The decision may be appealed before the Constitutional Court of Croatia within 48 hours of its receipt and once petitioned, the court must return a ruling within 48 hours. In local council elections, complaints are processed by county, city or town electoral commissions (as appropriate). In mayoral elections, complaints are filed with the county electoral commission. This does not apply to Zagreb mayoral elections, where complaints are submitted to the State Electoral Commission (the case also in county prefect elections). The time allowances and appeals procedure are the same as for presidential and parliamentary elections.

===Monitoring===
Elections are governed by the State Electoral Commission and electoral boards. Members of those bodies are required to have a university degree in law, and they may not be members of any political party. The State Electoral Commission prepares and manages elections in accordance with legislation, appoints lower-ranking election-commission and board members, issues directives to such bodies and supervises their work. The State Electoral Commission compiles and publishes candidate lists, supervises the legality of political campaigns and compiles and publishes election results. All members of election boards (or their legal deputies) must be present at assigned polling stations at all times while the polling station is open. The board verifies the identity of voters against the list of registered voters and records the turnout. The turnout number is later checked against number of votes cast; if the number of votes exceeds the turnout, the election at that polling station must be repeated. Votes are tallied by hand, and that information is forwarded (along with all other records kept at the polling station) to the State Electoral Commission.

Further monitoring is performed by non-governmental organizations specializing in election monitoring, such as GONG. There are also other monitoring organisations headquartered in Croatia and abroad; the OSCE set up a limited monitoring mission to observe the 2009–2010 presidential elections. The last parliamentary election (held in 2007) was monitored by 8,540 observers fielded by a number of organisations and political parties.

<doc id="925533" wikidata="Q3068523" url="?curid=925533" title="Elections in Denmark">
<text>There are three types of elections in Denmark: elections to the national parliament (the Folketing), local elections (to municipal and regional councils), and elections to the European Parliament. Referendums may also be called to consult the Danish citizens directly on an issue of national concern.

Parliamentary elections are called by the Monarch on the advice of the Prime Minister, usually three to four years after the last election, although early elections may occur. Elections to local councils (municipal or regional) and to the European Parliament are held on fixed dates. Elections use the party-list proportional representation system. All Danish citizens, living in the Kingdom of Denmark and at least 18 years of age, are eligible to vote in parliamentary elections and long-time residents may vote in local elections.

==Parliamentary elections==

The Kingdom of Denmark (including the Faroe Islands and Greenland) elects a unicameral parliament, the Folketing, on a national level. Of the 179 members of parliament, the Faroe Islands and Greenland elect two members each, 135 are elected from ten multi-member constituencies on a party list PR system using the d&#x27;Hondt method and the remaining 40 seats are allocated to ensure proportionality at a national level. 
To get a share of supplementary seats a party needs to get at least 2% of the total number of votes. 

Only parties that reach any one of three thresholds stipulated by section 77 of the Folketing (Parliamentary) Elections Actwinning at least one constituency seat; obtaining at least the Hare quota (valid votes in province/number of constituency seats in province) in two of the three provinces; or obtaining at least 2% of the national votemay compete for compensatory seats.

Denmark has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments and/or minority cabinets.

Elections to the Folketing must be held at least every four years.

==Latest general election==
The last general election was held in November 2022.
==Local elections==
The latest elections for the ninety-eight municipal councils and the five regional councils were held on 16 November 2021.

==European elections==
The Denmark constituency directly elects thirteen members to the European Parliament every five years. The d&#x27;Hondt method of proportional representation is used. The last elections took place in June 2024.

==Referendums==
The Constitution of Denmark requires a referendum to be held in the following three cases:
* if one third of the members of the Parliament demands a referendum on a law that has been passed in the previous 30 days (excluding some ) (Section 42 of the Constitution), or
* a law that transfers sovereignty to an international organisation has not received a majority of five-sixths of the MPs (Section 20 of the Constitution), or
* in case of changing the electoral age (Section 29 of the Constitution).

The option for one third of the members of the Parliament to put a law to a referendum has a number of restrictions. Finance Bills, Supplementary Appropriation Bills, Provisional Appropriation Bills, Government Loan Bills, Civil Servants (Amendment) Bills, Salaries and Pensions Bills, Naturalization Bills, Expropriation Bills, Taxation (Direct and Indirect) Bills, as well as Bills introduced for the purpose The Work of Parliament of discharging existing treaty obligations shall not be decided by a referendum. (Section 42, Subsection 6 of the Constitution)

Even though the Constitution of Denmark requires referendum to be held only if super-majority of five-sixths of members of Parliament cannot be obtained, in practice, referendums have been held every time new treaties of the European Union have been approved, even when more than five-sixths can be found. Recently, the Danish government was highly criticized when it did not hold a referendum regarding the controversial Lisbon treaty.

In all three cases, to defeat the proposition the no votes must not only outnumber the yes votes, they must also number at least 30% of the electorate.

The Constitution of Denmark can be changed only through the procedure set out in Section 88 of the Constitution. First, the government has to propose a change in constitution, then a parliamentary election is held. After the new parliament approves the same text of the constitutional changes, the proposal is put to a referendum. To pass, the yes votes must not only outnumber the no votes, they must also number at least 40% of the electorate.

Of the 19 referendums held in Denmark, the most recent are the 2015 referendum on ending the opt-out from the European Union justice laws and the 2022 referendum on ending the opt-out from the European Union security and military framework.

<text>France is a unitary semi-presidential republic with a bicameral legislature. Public officials in the legislative and executive branches are either elected by the citizens (directly or indirectly) or appointed by elected officials. Referenda may also be called to consult the French citizenry directly on a particular question, especially one which concerns amendment to the Constitution.

France elects on its national level a head of state – the president – and a legislature.
* The president is elected for a five-year term (previously, seven years), directly by the citizens.
* The Parliament () has two chambers.
** The National Assembly () has 577 members, elected for a five-year term in single seat-constituencies directly by the citizens.
** The Senate () has 348 members, elected for six-year terms. 328 members are elected by an electoral college consisting of elected representatives from each of 96 departments in metropolitan France, 8 of which are elected from other dependencies, and 12 of which are elected by the French Assembly of French Citizens Abroad () which has replaced the High Council of French Citizens Abroad () a 155-member assembly elected by citizens living abroad.

In addition, French citizens elect a variety of local governments. There also are public elections for some non-political positions, such as those for the judges of courts administering labour law (), elected by workers and employers, or those for judges administering cases of rural land leases. This article covers only political elections.

French politics has ordinarily displayed some tendencies characterizing a two-party system in which power alternates between relatively stable coalitions, each being led by a major party: on the left, the Socialist Party, on the right, and its predecessors. This pattern was upset in 2017, when neither of those parties&#x27; candidates reached the second round of the presidential election and the newly formed party gained both the presidency and a comfortable majority in the National Assembly.

Elections are conducted according to rules set down in the Constitution of France, organic laws (), and the electoral code. Voting is not compulsory.

Elections are held on Sundays.
The campaigns end at midnight the Friday before the election; then, on election Sunday, by law, no polls can be published, and no electoral publications or broadcasts can be made. The voting stations open at 8 am and close at 6 pm in small towns or at 8 pm in cities, depending on prefectoral decisions. By law, publication of results or estimates is prohibited prior to that time; estimates are however often available from foreign media and Internet sites, e.g. those located in Belgium and Switzerland, before the official publication in France. The specified times are in the time zone of the district, which is uniform (Paris time) across Metropolitan France, but varies in French overseas territories such as French Guiana, Martinique and Guadeloupe.

The first official estimate of the results can consequently become available from Sunday, 8 pm, Paris time. Due to their different time zones, voters in some overseas territories previously knew the probable results of elections before the polling booths in Metropolitan France had closed, which could have discouraged voter participation in these places. For this reason, since the 2000s, elections in French overseas territories in the Americas, as well as embassies and consulates there, are held on Saturdays as a special exemption.

The most recent national elections took place on June 30 and July 7, 2024.

==Voters==
With the exception of senatorial election, for which there is an electoral college, the voters are French citizens over the age of 18 registered on the electoral rolls. People are automatically registered on reaching the age of 18. For municipal and European, but not national elections, citizens aged 18 or older of other European Union countries may vote in France. Registration is not compulsory, but the absence of registration precludes the possibility of voting.

Citizens may register either in their place of residence or in a place where they have been on the roll of taxpayers for local taxes for at least 5 years, but not in more than one place. Citizens living abroad may register at the consulate responsible for the region in which they live.

Only citizens legally registered as voters can run for public office.

There are exceptions to the above rules. Convicted criminals may be deprived of their civic rights, which include the right to vote, for a certain period of time depending on the crime. In particular, elected officials who have abused public funds may be deprived of the right to run for national public office for as long as 10 years. The application of such rules in the case of certain politicians has been controversial; see for instance the case of Alain Juppé.

Voting by proxy is possible when the citizen cannot easily attend the polling station (reasons include: health problems, the citizen does not live in the voting constituency, away for work or vacations, jailed but has not yet been sentenced and deprived of civic rights etc.) The citizen designates a proxy, who must be a voter from the same &quot;commune&quot;. The designation of the proxy must be made before a legally capable witness: a judge, a judicial clerk, or an officier of judicial police, or, outside France, before an ambassador or consul. In the case of handicapped or severely ill people, an officer of judicial police or delegate thereof can be sent to the home of the citizen to witness the designation. The procedure is meant to avoid pressures on voters.

==Electoral system==
In all elections where there is a single official to be elected for a given area, including the two major national elections (the election of the President of the Republic and the election of the members of the National Assembly), two-round runoff voting is used.

For elections to the European Parliament and some local elections, proportional voting is used.

===National Assembly===
The 577 members of the National Assembly are elected using a two-round system with single-member constituencies.
To be elected in the first round, a candidate is required to secure an absolute majority of votes cast, and also to secure votes equal to at least 25% of eligible voters in their constituency. Should none of the candidates satisfy these conditions, a second round of voting ensues. Most constituencies proceed to a second round election. Only first-round candidates with the support of at least 12.5% of &quot;eligible&quot; voters are allowed to participate, but if only one candidate meets that standard the two candidates with the highest number of votes in the first round may continue to the second round. In the second round, the candidate with a plurality is elected. Of the 577 constituencies, 539 are in metropolitan France, 27 are in overseas departments and territories and 11 are for French citizens living abroad.

=== Party primary elections ===
Primary elections, within registered political parties, are used to select presidential candidates for the general election. Primaries also use two-round runoff voting when there are multiple candidates within a party. (see :Category:Primary elections in France). Open primaries, where any eligible voter may participate with minimal requirements, also occur.

==Voting procedures==

Voting is done using paper and manual counting. The voter gets pre-printed ballot papers () from a table at the entrance of the voting office (mail-in voting is not allowed in France). There is one ballot paper for each candidate, pair of candidates (for departmental elections) or list. These ballot papers are also sent by mail to voters before the election. The voter then has their identity and registration checked by an official, after which the voter takes an envelope. If they also act as a proxy for another voter, they take a second envelope. The voter then enters a curtained booth (), where they are hidden from sight, and inserts the ballot paper of their candidate into the envelope. They walk to the ballot box, where the president of the voting office or their deputy formally checks their identity. Only in municipalities under 1,000 inhabitants is an official identity document optional, if the deputy can attest of the identity. After the officials have acknowledged their right to vote, the ballot box is opened and the voter inserts the envelope. One of the officials, traditionally loudly, announces &quot;&quot;A voté!&quot; (Did vote!)&quot;. This is purely ceremonial and has a double meaning: the voter&#x27;s &quot;voix&quot; (voice) will be taken into account and they have accomplished their civic duty. The voter then signs the voters&#x27; list and their voter registration card is stamped.

Electronic voting is used only for French citizens living abroad and for two specific elections: legislative and consular elections.

===Referendums===
The Constitution of France defines in Article 3 that &quot;National sovereignty shall vest in the people, who shall exercise it through their representatives and by means of referendum.&quot; The Constitution describes two ways for holding a referendum:
* The President may, on the recommendation from the Government or the Parliament, submit to a referendum some government bills.
* A referendum may be held upon the initiative of one fifth of the Members of Parliament, supported by one tenth of the registered voters.

The Constitution explicitly states that a referendum can be called only on a Government Bill &quot;which deals with the organization of the public authorities, or with reforms relating to the economic or social policy of the Nation, and to the public services contributing thereto, or which provides for authorization to ratify a treaty which, although not contrary to the Constitution, would affect the functioning of the institutions&quot; (Article 11 of the Constitution).

The second procedure for holding a referendum has several limitations:
* it cannot be used to repeal laws which are in effect for less than a year, and
* if the proposal fails on a referendum, it cannot be re-submitted to a referendum for next two years.

The second procedure for holding a referendum was added to the Constitution in 2008, and it still has not come into effect (as of 2013). It will come into effect when appropriate legislation is implemented by the Parliament.

The Constitution of France can be amended in two ways:
* on a referendum, or
* by three-fifths super-majority of both houses of the Parliament.
Most constitutional revisions went through the super-majority of the Parliament in Congress.

Ratification of treaties of accession of states to the EU must go through the same procedure as amendment of Constitution of France. All of ratifications went through the super-majority of the Parliament, except the first EU enlargement in 1973.

There were nine referendums in the Fifth Republic:
* two on Algeria (1961, 1962)
* two on amending the Constitution (1969, 2000)
* two on EU treaties (1992, 2005)
* French presidential election referendum of 1962, which also amended the constitution
* one on EU enlargement (1972)
* one on New Caledonia (1988)

===Indirect presidential elections===
* 3rd Republic
* 1947
* 1953
* 1958

<text>Richard Joseph &quot;Dick&quot; Davisson (December 29, 1922 – June 15, 2004) was an American physicist.

Davisson was the son of Clinton Davisson, a Nobel laureate, and his wife Charlotte; Davisson&#x27;s maternal uncle, Sir Owen Richardson, was also a Nobel laureate.

During World War II he worked on the Manhattan Project as part of the Special Engineer Detachment. At Los Alamos, he met Professor Robert Williams, who later recruited him to teach at the University of Washington.

As a graduate student at Cornell after World War II, Davisson built a cosmic ray machine that would do everything but write a grad student&#x27;s thesis. He acquired a huge magnet from Navy surplus, built a cloud chamber and a set of Geiger counters and designed a universal-focus camera to record cosmic ray events. Then he designed and built an early electronic computer to record and sort the events according to energy, mass, charge, direction and frequency. Davisson went on to the University of Washington without a PhD.

Davisson was a member of the University of Washington&#x27;s team which designed a system for detecting subatomic particles known as muons. After the U.S. government pulled the funding on the Superconducting Super Collider project, the team was recruited by CERN to help build part of the muon detector of the ATLAS experiment in the Large Hadron Collider particle accelerator, in which Davisson took part, e.g., creating tools to test the detector tubes and as a liaison between the University of Washington&#x27;s team and the rest of the collaborating group.

Davisson retired in 2000, at the age of 77. He was married for forty years to Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Davisson, a retired psychiatric social worker from whom he separated after fourteen years. They had one son.

<text>Sharon Lea O&#x27;Neill (born 23 November 1952) is a New Zealand singer-songwriter and pianist, who had an Australasian hit single in 1983 with &quot;Maxine&quot; which reached No. 16 on both the Australian Kent Music Report and Recording Industry Association of New Zealand charts.

==Career==
===1960s–1977: Career beginnings===
Sharon O&#x27;Neill is a self taught musician who learned to play guitar by ear and started composing at an early age, by putting chords to her poetry. She began playing the acoustic guitar around Nelson in the 1960s.

O&#x27;Neill began recording with Robin Winch and Nancy Richman under the name Suitewater. An entry into the 1970 Mobil Song Quest, saw Sharon &amp; Nancy make the finals with a song called &quot;Life Upon Life&quot; written by O&#x27;Neill. Another of her songs, &quot;Nothing Makes It Easy&quot;, got her to the finals of the &quot;New Faces&quot; television talent show in 1972 In 1972, O&#x27;Neill released &quot;Love Song&quot; a Lesley Duncan cover on Ode Records. Between 1972 and 1977 O&#x27;Neill joined New Zealand band Chapta, a covers band called Jessica, and a rock-pop band called Shiner. In 1977, encouraged by Shiner guitarist and future husband Brent Thomas, O&#x27;Neill began concentrating on song writing. O&#x27;Neill was featured on the track &quot;If There&#x27;s Still a Little Love&quot; on Mark Williams&#x27; 1977 album &quot;Taking It All in Stride&quot;, with the song also featuring on &quot;Mark Williams Greatest Hits&quot; compilation album released in late 1977. O&#x27;Neill also supported Williams on tour.

===1978–1983: CBS Records===
In 1978, O&#x27;Neill performed the track &quot;Luck&#x27;s on Your Table&quot; on the New Zealand TV show &quot;The Entertainers&quot;, where she finished third. She subsequently signed to CBS Records and released &quot;Luck&#x27;s on the Table&quot; in September 1978. It reached number 27 on the New Zealand singles chart and was included on her debut album &quot;This Heart This Song&quot;, which was released in February 1979. In June 1979, O&#x27;Neill released &quot;Don&#x27;t Say No to Tomorrow&quot;, which was featured on a Telethon. It reached number 6 on the charts. That same year she received an APRA Silver Scroll Award for the song &quot;Face in a Rainbow&quot; from her debut album. O&#x27;Neill won best female artist at the New Zealand Music Awards in 1978, and 1979. In February 1980, O&#x27;Neill released her second studio album titled &quot;Sharon O&#x27;Neill&quot;, which peaked at number 3. At the 1980 New Zealand Music Awards, O&#x27;Neill won her third Female Artist of the Year as well as her first Album of the Year. The album gained moderate success in Australia with the hit &quot;Words&quot; (AUS #56) and the subsequent singles &quot;Asian Paradise&quot; (AUS #76) and &quot;How Do You Talk to Boys&quot; (AUS #25). O&#x27;Neill joined Jon Stevens on a duet called &quot;Don&#x27;t Let Love Go&quot;, which reached number 5 in New Zealand in March 1980.

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s third studio album &quot;Maybe&quot; was released in October 1981. It produced the hits &quot;Waiting for You&quot; and &quot;Maybe&quot; (AUS #38). O&#x27;Neill supported Boz Scaggs on his Australian tour before she moved to Australia to settle. O&#x27;Neill provided the soundtrack to Roger Donaldson&#x27;s 1982 movie &quot;Smash Palace&quot;. It was a five-track extended play and won Best Film Soundtrack/Cast Recording/Compilation at the 1983 New Zealand Music Awards.

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s fourth studio album &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; was released in May 1983. It contained the tracks &quot;Losing You&quot; (AUS #26) and &quot;Maxine&quot; (AUS #16), a song which chronicled the life of a Kings Cross prostitute. In a 2016 interview, O&#x27;Neill said: &quot;I was living in a hotel in Kings Cross when I got the inspiration to write &#x27;Maxine&#x27;. She was always out there working at 3am when we&#x27;d get home bleary-eyed from a gig.&quot; &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; was certified gold in New Zealand.

===1984–1999: Polydor Records and compilations===
A legal battle with her then-record company CBS caused a delay in her career. In 1984, CBS budget label J&amp;B released a best of collection titled &quot;So Far&quot;. During the enforced hiatus, O&#x27;Neill wrote songs for ABC&#x27;s 1984 TV series &quot;Sweet and Sour&quot; including the title song performed by Deborah Conway (later recorded by O&#x27;Neill as &quot;In Control&quot;) and &quot;Glam to Wham&quot;. She wrote &quot;Blood Red Roses&quot; for the movie soundtrack of &quot;Street Hero&quot; and music for &quot;Dancing Daze&quot;. O&#x27;Neill met American keyboardist and songwriter Alan Mansfield on Dragon&#x27;s Body and the Beat Tour of New Zealand in 1984—they later became domestic and professional partners.

In October 1987, O&#x27;Neill returned with her fifth studio album &quot;Danced in the Fire&quot; on Polygram, which featured some biographical songs about her legal wrangles with CBS. &quot;Physical Favours&quot; peaked at number 25 in New Zealand and 39 in Australia. In 1988, CBS Records released a series of four-track EPs; &quot;Volume 18&quot; was O&#x27;Neill and featured four of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s greatest hits.

In 1990, O&#x27;Neill released her sixth studio album &quot;Edge of Winter&quot;. Two singles were taken from this album, &quot;Satin Sheets&quot; and &quot;Poster Girl&quot;, both of which failed to find chart success. &quot;The Very Best of Collette and Sharon O&#x27;Neill&quot; was released in 1991 by J&amp;B Records. It contained eight tracks from Collette Roberts and eight tracks from O&#x27;Neill, including the previously non-album single &quot;Power&quot; from 1984.

In 1991, O&#x27;Neill collaborated with Robert Palmer and wrote &quot;True Love&quot; together for Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm &amp; Blues&quot; album. She also contributed vocals on that release. In 1994, O&#x27;Neill, Palmer, and Palmer&#x27;s girlfriend Mary Ambrose co-wrote &quot;Love Takes Time&quot; for Palmer&#x27;s &quot;Honey&quot; album. O&#x27;Neill contributed vocals to that release, as well as to Palmer&#x27;s 1999 &quot;Rhythm &amp; Blues&quot; and 2003&#x27;s &quot;Drive&quot;.

===2000–present: Later career===
In 2001, she toured as a guest artist with New Zealand female act When the Cat&#x27;s Away. In 2005, she toured Australia as a support act for Leo Sayer and a comprehensive collection of her greatest hits was released by Sony Music Australia under the title &quot;The Best of Sharon O&#x27;Neill&quot;. In 2006 and early 2007, O&#x27;Neill again toured Australia supporting Leo Sayer.

From August–September 2007, O&#x27;Neill toured as part of the &#x27;Countdown Spectacular 2&#x27; concert series Australia-wide and toured Australia and New Zealand on The Let It Be Tour (The Beatles tribute show) in November–December 2007.

In 2014, Sony New Zealand released a new greatest hits collection titled &quot;&quot;. The album peaked at number 6 on the New Zealand albums chart.

In 2018, O&#x27;Neill performed a duet with Ben Ransom titled &quot;Young Years&quot;, the song she co-wrote for the group Dragon. The track is available via digital streaming service Apple Music.

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s partner of 40 years, Alan Mansfield, died in October 2024.

<text>Admiral Sir Hugh Francis Paget Sinclair, (18 August 1873 – 4 November 1939), known as Quex Sinclair, was a British intelligence officer. He was Director of British Naval Intelligence between 1919 and 1921, and he subsequently helped to set up the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS, commonly MI6) and GCHQ.

==Career==
Sinclair was educated at Stubbington House School and joined the Royal Navy as a cadet aged 13 on 15 July 1886. He was promoted to lieutenant on 31 December 1894.

He entered the Naval Intelligence Division at the beginning of the First World War. He became Director of Naval Intelligence in February 1919 and Chief of the Submarine Service in 1921. He became the second director of SIS in 1923. He was promoted vice-admiral on 3 March 1926 and full admiral on 15 May 1930. Sinclair also founded GC&amp;CS, later to be known as GCHQ in 1919.

Beginning in 1919 he attempted to absorb the counterintelligence service MI5 into the SIS to strengthen Britain&#x27;s efforts against Bolshevism, an idea that was finally rejected in 1925. The SIS remained small and underfunded during the interwar years. By 1936, Sinclair realised that the Gestapo had penetrated several SIS stations and Claude Dansey, who had been removed from his station in Rome, set up Z Organization, intended to work independently of the compromised SIS.

In 1938, with a second war looming, Sinclair set up Section D, dedicated to sabotage. In spring 1938, using £6,000 of his own money, he bought Bletchley Park to be a wartime intelligence station.

Sinclair was asked in December 1938 to prepare a dossier on Adolf Hitler, for the attention of Lord Halifax, the Foreign Secretary, and Neville Chamberlain, the Prime Minister. In the dossier, which was received poorly by Sir George Mounsey, the Foreign Office assistant undersecretary, who believed that it did not gel with Britain&#x27;s policy of appeasement, Sinclair described Hitler as possessing the characteristics of &quot;fanaticism, mysticism, ruthlessness, cunning, vanity, moods of exaltation and depression, fits of bitter and self-righteous resentment; and what can only be termed a streak of madness; but with it all there is a great tenacity of purpose, which has often been combined with extraordinary clarity of vision&quot;.

Sinclair became seriously ill with cancer, causing Alexander Cadogan to note on 19 October 1939, that he was &quot;going downhill&quot;. On 29 October, Sinclair underwent an operation for his cancer and died on 4 November 1939, aged 66, five days before the Venlo incident.

==Family==
Hugh was the son of Admiral Frederick Beauchamp Paget Seymour, 1st Baron Alcester and Agnes Sinclair. In his will, Frederick Seymour, left the balance of his estate to Agnes Sinclair for her lifetime. On her death, two fifths were left to Frederick Charles Horace Sinclair and one fifth each to Hugh Francis Paget Sinclair, Claude Hamilton Sinclair and Evelyn Beauchamp Sinclair.

Hugh married, in 1907, Gertrude Attenborough and had two sons. They were divorced in 1920.

==Awards and decorations==
* 1911 King George V Coronation Medal
* 1916 Companion of the Order of the Bath
* 1918 3rd Class, Order of the Rising Sun 
* 1918 Officer, the Legion of Honour 
* 1935 Knight Commander, the Order of the Bath

<doc id="925561" wikidata="Q514420" url="?curid=925561" title="Josephine Earp">
<text>Josephine Sarah &quot;Sadie&quot; Earp (née Marcus; 1861 – December 19, 1944) was the common-law wife of Wyatt Earp, a famed Old West lawman and gambler. She met Wyatt in 1881 in the frontier boom town of Tombstone in Arizona Territory, when she was living with Johnny Behan, sheriff of Cochise County, Arizona.

Josephine was born in New York to a Prussian Jewish family. Her father was a baker. They moved to San Francisco, where Josephine attended dance school as a girl. When her father had difficulty finding work, the family moved in with her older sister and brother-in-law in a working-class tenement. Josephine ran away, possibly as early as age 14, and traveled to Arizona, where she said she went &quot;looking for adventure&quot;. Much of her life from about 1874 to 1882 (when she lived in the Arizona Territory) is uncertain; she worked hard to keep this period of her life private, even threatening legal action against writers and movie producers. She may have arrived in Prescott, Arizona, as early as 1874. The book &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot; (1967), based on a manuscript allegedly written in part by her, describes events she witnessed in Arizona that occurred before 1879, the year she claimed at other times to have first arrived in Tombstone. There is some evidence that she lived from 1874 to 1876 in Prescott and Tip Top, Arizona Territory under the assumed name of Sadie Mansfield, who was a prostitute, before becoming ill and returning to San Francisco. The name Sadie Mansfield was also recorded in Tombstone. Researchers have found that the two names share extremely similar characteristics and circumstances.

Later in life Josephine described her first years in Arizona as &quot;a bad dream&quot;. What is known for certain is that she traveled to Tombstone using the name Josephine Marcus in October 1880. She wrote that she met Cochise County Sheriff Johnny Behan when she was 17 and he was 33. He promised to marry her and she joined him in Tombstone. He reneged but persuaded her to stay. Behan was sympathetic to ranchers and certain outlaw Cowboys, who were at odds with Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp and his brothers, Wyatt and Morgan. Josephine left Behan in 1881, before the gunfight at the O.K. Corral, during which Wyatt and his brothers killed three Cochise County Cowboys. She went to San Francisco in March 1882 and was joined that fall by Wyatt, with whom she remained as his life companion for 46 years until his death.

Josephine and Wyatt moved throughout their life, from one boomtown to another, until they finally bought a cottage in the Sonoran Desert town of Vidal, California, on the Colorado River, where they spent the cooler seasons. In the summer they retreated to Los Angeles, where Wyatt struck up relationships with some of the early cowboy actors, including William S. Hart and Tom Mix. The facts about Josephine Earp and her relationship to Wyatt were relatively unknown until amateur Earp historian Glenn Boyer published the book &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot;. Boyer&#x27;s book was considered a factual memoir, and cited by scholars, studied in classrooms, and used as a source by filmmakers for 32 years. In 1998, reporters and scholars found that Boyer could not document many of the facts he wrote about Josephine&#x27;s time in Tombstone. Some critics decried the book as a fraud and a hoax, and the University of Arizona withdrew the book from its catalog.

== Early life ==
Josephine Sarah Marcus was born in 1861 in New York City, the second of three children of immigrants Carl-Hyman Marcuse (later Henry Marcus) and Sophie Lewis. The Lewis family was Jewish, and came from the Posen region in Prussia, current-day Poland, around 1850. Sophie was a widow with a 3-year-old daughter, Rebecca Levy, when she married Marcuse, who was eight years younger than she. Sophie and Carl had three children together: Nathan (born 1857), Josephine, and Henrietta (born 1864).

=== Move to San Francisco ===
Josephine&#x27;s father Henry was a baker. He struggled to make a living in New York City and read about the growing city of San Francisco. Henry moved the family there in 1868 when Josephine was seven. They traveled via ship to Panama, went over the Isthmus of Panama, and caught a steamship to San Francisco. They arrived while the city was recovering from the disastrous earthquake of October 21, 1868. Upon their arrival, her father found a highly stratified Jewish community. On the inside were the German Jews and on the outside were the Polish Jews. The German Jews were usually more affluent, better educated, and spoke German, while the Polish Jews, who spoke Yiddish, were typically peddlers and much more religious. Henry found work as a baker.

By 1870, San Francisco was riding on the coattails of the still-expanding economic boom caused by the mining of silver from the Comstock Lode. The population had boomed to 149,473, and housing was in short supply. Apartment buildings were crowded, and large homes were converted into rooming houses. Money flowed from Nevada through San Francisco, and for a while the Marcus family prospered. Later that year, Josephine&#x27;s half-sister Rebecca Levy married Aaron Wiener, an insurance salesman born in Prussia, as her parents were.

=== Living conditions ===

As an adult, Josephine claimed her father was German and ran a prosperous mercantile business. Henry Marcus initially made enough money to send Josephine and her sister Hattie to music and dance classes at McCarty&#x27;s Dancing Academy, a family-owned business on Eddy St. that taught both children and adults. In &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot;, author Glen Boyer states that Josephine took dance lessons and had a maid. He wrote (in her voice), &quot;Hattie and I attended the McCarthy Dancing Academy for children on Howard Street (Polk and Pacific). Eugenia and Lottie McCarthy taught us to dance the Highland Fling, the Sailor&#x27;s Hornpipe, and ballroom dancing.&quot;

During 1874, when Josephine was 13, production of gold and silver from the Comstock Lode had fed a feverish stock market, leading to a great deal of speculation. When the Comstock Lode production began to fade, San Francisco suffered. Her father Henry’s earnings as a baker fell. The family was forced to move in with Josephine&#x27;s older sister Rebecca and her husband Aaron &quot;south of the slot&quot; (south of Market Street) at 138 Perry Street between 3rd and 2nd at Harrison in a tenement on the flatlands. It was a working-class, ethnically mixed neighborhood, where smoke from factory chimneys filled the air. The 1880 census places the family in the 9th Ward, between San Francisco Bay, Channel, Harrison and Seventh streets. In early 1880, Henry was living with his son-in-law Aaron, who was employed as a bookkeeper.

=== Youth ===
As a girl, Josephine loved going to the theater. &quot;There was far too much excitement in the air to remain a child.&quot; She apparently resented treatment by her teachers in the San Francisco schools, describing them as &quot;inconsistent of a tolerant and gay populous acting as merciless and self-righteous as a New England village in bringing up its children.&quot; She described the harsh discipline meted out, including the &quot;sting of rattan&quot; and &quot;being slapped for tardiness&quot;. Josephine said that she matured early and developed large breasts.

== Mixing fact and fiction ==
Throughout her later life, Josephine worked hard to manage what the press and public knew about her and Wyatt&#x27;s life in Arizona. Josephine told Earp&#x27;s biographers and others that Earp didn&#x27;t drink, never owned gambling saloons, and that his saloons didn&#x27;t offer prostitutes, which all have been documented. When Frank Waters was writing &quot;Tombstone Travesty&quot;, originally published in 1934, he returned from a research trip to Tombstone to learn that Josephine Earp had visited his mother and sister and threatened court action to prevent him from publishing the book. Waters&#x27; work was later found to be critically flawed, &quot;based upon prevarications, character assassinations, and the psychological battleground that was the brilliant, narcissistic mind of its author.&quot;

In the course of writing &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot; (1931), Stuart Lake learned that Josephine had lived with Johnny Behan in Tombstone and other aspects of Josephine&#x27;s life that she wanted to keep private. Josephine and Wyatt went to great lengths to keep her name out of Lake&#x27;s book, and she threatened litigation to keep it that way. At one point in their contentious relationship, Josephine described Lake&#x27;s book as made up of &quot;outright lies&quot;. After Wyatt died in 1929, Josephine traveled to Boston, Massachusetts, to try to persuade the publisher to stop the release of the book. Although the biography became a bestseller, it was later strongly criticized for fictionalizing Earp&#x27;s life and was found to be markedly inaccurate.

During the later years of her life, in addition to burnishing the life and legend of husband Wyatt Earp, &quot;she scripted a history of make believe to hide a number of things of which she was not terribly proud.&quot;

=== Concealed Wyatt&#x27;s former wife ===

As late as 1936, Josephine took legal action to suppress certain details of her and Wyatt&#x27;s life in Tombstone. Josephine worked hard to conceal Wyatt&#x27;s prior relationship to his common-law wife and former prostitute Mattie Blaylock, with whom Wyatt was living when Josephine first met him in 1880. Earp named a mining claim he filed on February 16, 1880 &quot;Mattie Blaylock.&quot; While Blaylock was living with Earp, she suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to laudanum, an opiate-based pain reliever widely available at the time. After Earp left Tombstone and Blaylock, she waited in Colton, California, to hear from him, but he never contacted her. She met a gambler from Arizona who asked her to marry him. She asked Wyatt for a divorce, but Wyatt didn&#x27;t believe in divorce and refused. She ran away with the gambler anyway, who later abandoned her in Arizona. Mattie resumed life as a prostitute and committed &quot;suicide by opium poisoning&quot; on July 3, 1888.

=== Evasive about Tombstone history ===
The facts about Josephine&#x27;s life in the Arizona Territory and in Tombstone have been obscured by her legal and personal efforts to keep that period private. Josephine&#x27;s own story offers a conflicting account of when she first reached Arizona. Her confusing recollection of events show how easily Josephine mixed fact and fiction.

After Wyatt&#x27;s death, Josephine collaborated with two of her husband&#x27;s cousins, Mabel Earp Cason and her sister Vinolia Earp Ackerman, to document her life. The cousins recorded events in her later life, but they found Josephine evasive about the timing and nature of events during her time in the Arizona Territory and Tombstone. She would not even talk about the key events of 1881–82, their key years in Tombstone. The most she would say is that she returned to the Arizona Territory in 1881 and joined Johnny Behan in Tombstone. She said that she had believed Behan was planning to marry her, but he kept putting it off, and she grew disillusioned.

Based on the story she told the Earp cousins, when correlated with other sources, Josephine may have left her parents’ home in San Francisco for Prescott, Arizona, as early as October 1874, when she was 13 or 14 years old, not 1879 as she told everyone later on. Cason says she and her sister &quot;finally abandoned work on the manuscript because she [Josie] would not clear up the Tombstone sequence where it pertained to her and Wyatt.&quot;

=== Hidden personal past ===

In addition to Josephine&#x27;s concealing Wyatt&#x27;s past relationship with Blaylock, modern researchers think she may also have been concealing her own past as a &quot;sporting lady&quot; or prostitute. When Stuart Lake was researching his book &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot; he heard stories about Sadie&#x27;s personal history. He didn&#x27;t include them in the book, but he did write about them in letters during 1929. Bat Masterson, a friend of Wyatt Earp&#x27;s who was in Tombstone from February to April 1881, described her to Stuart Lake as &quot;an incredible beauty&quot; and as the &quot;belle of the honkytonks, the prettiest dame in three hundred or so of her kind.&quot; Honkytonk bars in that era often had a reputation as places for prostitution and his choice of language (&quot;three hundred or so of her kind&quot;) may have referred to Josephine&#x27;s work as a prostitute.

Other researchers have questioned what she did prior to 1883. A town like Tombstone, full of single men, attracted women who sought adventure with little concern for what others might think. Josephine always sought excitement in her life. In the book &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot; (1967), based on a manuscript which she purportedly wrote, author Glenn Boyer quotes her as saying, &quot;I liked the traveling sort of man... better than the kind that sat back in one town all his life and wrote down little rows of figures all day or hustled dry goods or groceries and that sort of thing... My blood demanded excitement, variety and change.&quot;

Men in Tombstone outnumbered women nine to one, and the miners were eager to pay substantial fees to women who would cook their meals, provide rooms, wash their clothes, and provide sexual services. Many madams and prostitutes had more control of their lives and greater independence than &quot;respectable&quot; women, who often ostracized them. Married women of the era were expected to avoid working outside the home, or risk being considered &quot;public women,&quot; a euphemism for prostitute. A few women of the era chose to remain single as a means to maintain their independence from men, and Josephine was among them.

The type of work available to unmarried women without means in that era was as waitresses, laundresses, seamstresses, or other dull work which Josephine avoided. Some women in Tombstone operated restaurants, boarding houses, and apparel and millinery shops, and a few ran some of the dry goods stores. Many wives of the prosperous mining engineers, merchants, and business owners lived in better class cities where they didn&#x27;t have to contend with being confused for a prostitute.

Josephine&#x27;s life on the frontier and possibly as a prostitute allowed her greater independence. She likely enjoyed the social life and independence that accompanied her role. As an unmarried woman in frontier Tombstone, vastly outnumbered by men, she was likely regarded by some as a prostitute, regardless of her true status.

== Runaway ==

In a remarkable set of coincidences, the known life of Josephine Sadie Marcus overlapped the life of an otherwise unknown prostitute named Sadie Mansfield. Josie attended the Powell Street Primary School on Powell St. between Clay and Washington in San Francisco. One block away on the 1000 block of Clay Street in a neighborhood known for prostitution was a brothel, owned by Hattie Wells. In 1879, five prostitutes lived there. Josephine had to walk past the brothel every day on her way to school. To her the women appeared not as &quot;soiled doves&quot; but nicely dressed women living a life of leisure. Wells also owned a brothel in Prescott, Arizona.

In &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot;, Josephine wrote that one day, &quot;I left my home one morning, carrying my books just as though I was going to school as usual.&quot; She said that at the age of 18, she ran away with two friends, Dora Hirsch, daughter of her music teacher, and a girl named Agnes, who had a role in Pauline Markham troupe&#x27;s production of &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; in San Francisco. Author Sherry Monahan questions why an 18-year-old woman would be carrying books to school and find it necessary to &quot;run away.&quot;

=== First arrival in Arizona ===
In the Cason manuscript, which was in part the basis for the book &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot;, Josephine says she and her friend Dora joined the Pauline Markham Theater Company in 1879, when it visited San Francisco on its Western tour. Markham already had a national reputation as a burlesque dancer and singer. She often appeared on stage and in publicity photos wearing a corset and pink tights: shocking attire for the 1870s. Josephine wrote that Dora was hired as a singer, and she was hired as a dancer. Josie said the two of them sailed with the other six members of the Pauline Markham troupe from San Francisco to Santa Barbara, where they stayed for a few days, performing in San Bernardino before leaving for Prescott, Arizona Territory, by stagecoach.

Josephine said the girls arrived with the troupe in Tombstone on December 1, 1879, for a one-week engagement. This was the same date that Wyatt Earp and his brothers arrived. After a week in Tombstone, the Markham troupe finished their engagement and headed north to Prescott. They performed &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot; more than a dozen times from December 24, 1879, through February 20, 1880. Josephine said she left the acting troupe in February 1880, just after the Markham troupe ended its initial run of performances in Prescott.

Author Roger Ray thoroughly researched Josephine&#x27;s story about joining the theater company and found many inconsistencies. The Markham troupe is documented as leaving San Francisco on board the Southern Pacific Railroad, not a ship nor a stagecoach, in October 1879 for Casa Grande, Arizona, the end of the line. Josephine or Sadie Marcus’s name was never included among those on the Markham troupe’s rolls in 1879. The Yuma &quot;Arizona Sentinel&quot; reported on October 25, 1879, &quot;Tuesday arrived a &quot;Pinafore&quot; Company for Tucson, composed of Misses Pauline Markham, Mary Bell, Belle Howard, and Mrs. Pring, and Messrs. Borabeck and McMahon.&quot; From Yuma, the troupe took a stagecoach to Tucson, not Prescott. Ray says that Josephine didn&#x27;t have a friend named Dora Hirsch. Her real name was Leah Hirschberg, whose mother was a music teacher. This family lived only a few blocks from where Josephine lived with her family. But Leah never left San Francisco with Josephine. She enjoyed some brief success as a juvenile actress on the San Francisco stage during the 1870s.

Professor Pat Ryan stated that Josephine or Sadie may have used the stage name May Bell as a member of the Markham stage group. On October 21, 1879, the &quot;Los Angeles Herald&quot; reported that May Bell was among members of the Markham troupe. But, no other corroborating evidence has been found supporting the thesis that Josephine used May Bell as a stage name, and she never claimed so.

=== Links to prostitute Sadie Mansfield ===

Josephine began using the name Sadie after she arrived in Arizona. Sadie was a well-known nickname for Sarah, Josie&#x27;s middle name, and it was common for prostitutes of that time period to change their first name. In November 1874, a woman named Sadie Mansfield took a stagecoach from San Francisco to Prescott along with several prostitutes working for Madame Hattie Wells. The group included a black woman named Julia Barton. (Josephine in her own account said that she brought her maid, a black woman named Julia, with her. She also told the Earp cousins that Pauline Markham had a maid named Julia.) On October 20, 1875, the &quot;Arizona Weekly Miner&quot; of Prescott, Arizona, noted that among the passengers en route from San Francisco were &quot;Miss Saddie Mansfield... and Mrs. Julia Barton, a servant.&quot; Prostitution wasn&#x27;t illegal in the territory as long as the women paid their licensing fees. Prominent men were, however, expected to be discreet.

===Johnny Behan===
Josephine told others that when she and her friend Dora arrived in Arizona she learned that &quot;some renegade Yuma-Apaches had escaped from the reservation to which they had been consigned and had returned to their old haunts on the war-path.&quot; She wrote that the famous Indian fighter Al Sieber was tracking the escaped Apache. She said that Sieber and his scouts led her stagecoach and its passengers to a nearby adobe ranch house. The group spent 10 days sleeping on the floor. Josephine first met John &quot;Johnny&quot; Harris Behan at the ranch house, whom she described as, &quot;young and darkly handsome, with merry black eyes and an engaging smile. My heart was stirred by his attentions in what were very romantic circumstances. It was a diversion from my homesickness though I cannot say I was in love with him... I am under the impression that he was a deputy sheriff engaged on some official errand.&quot; If as Josephine stated she traveled with Markham&#x27;s troupe from San Francisco in December 1879, there are no contemporary accounts of the trip&#x27;s being interrupted by Indians.

Behan married 17-year-old Victoria Zaff in March 1869 in San Francisco, her step-father&#x27;s home town. She was the step-daughter of Yavapai County Sheriff John P. Bourke. The couple moved back to Prescott, Arizona Territory, where John had been working, and four months later, on June 15, 1869, she had her first child, Henrietta. Behan was on the surface an upstanding citizen, married with a child, but he also frequented brothels.

During 1871–73, Behan succeeded his father-in-law Bourke as Yavapai County Sheriff. On September 28, 1874, Behan was nominated at the Democratic convention to stand for re-election. He began campaigning and the &quot;Prescott Miner&quot; reported on October 6, 1874, that &quot;J.H. Behan left on an &#x27;electioneering&#x27; tour toward Black Canyon, Wickenburg and other places&quot; north and west of present-day Phoenix.

Later that same month, on October 24, 1874, the &quot;Arizona Miner&quot; reported, &quot;Al Zieber, Sergeant Stauffer and a mixed command of white and red soldiers are in the hills of Verde looking for some erring Apaches, whom they will be apt to find.&quot; Three days later, Sieber and Sgt. Rudolph Stauffer found the Apaches that had escaped the reservation at Cave Creek and fought them. The area in which Behan campaigned was also near Cave Creek, where Al Sieber was looking for Indians. Behan was gone for 35 days, returning to Prescott on November 11, 1874, where he lost the election.

The events that Josephine &quot;Sadie&quot; Marcus claimed took place when she was 18 years old in 1879 don&#x27;t correlate with known facts, but do closely correspond to the events in 14-year-old Sadie Mansfield&#x27;s journey to Prescott in 1874.

=== Sadie Mansfield in Arizona ===

Prescott had 668 residents in 1870. In 1874, 14-year-old Sadie Mansfield worked under the watchful eye of Madam Josie Roland as a prostitute in a brothel on Granite Street, between Gurley and Alarcon streets, and near the Yavapai County Courthouse where Sheriff Behan worked. Neighbors in Prescott witnessed Behan visiting the &quot;house of ill fame&quot; on Granite Street on several occasions during December 1874. He had a &quot;relationship with&quot; Sadie Mansfield, likely the same girl who had traveled with Hattie Wells&#x27; prostitutes from San Francisco.

On February 6, 1875, criminal charges were filed against Sadie Mansfield for petty larceny, accusing her of stealing two German silver spoons worth $126.00. The charges against her reported that &quot;one set of German table spoons were stolen from the store of H. Asher and Company in the village of Prescott, Yavapai, A.T.&quot; Sheriff Ed Burnes searched Mansfield&#x27;s residence and confiscated the spoons. The case was tried the same day with only one witness for the defense, Jennie Andrews. The nine-man jury found her not guilty. The &quot;Weekly Arizona Miner&quot; of Prescott reported on February 5, 1875, that Sadie Mansfield won a prize in the &quot;Grand New Year Gift Enterprise&quot;. The paper also reported on April 9, 1875, that a letter was waiting for her in the post office.

On May 22, 1875, Behan&#x27;s wife Victoria filed for divorce. She took the unusual step of asserting in her divorce petition that Behan &quot;at divers times and places openly and notoriously visited houses of ill-fame and prostitution at said town of Prescott.&quot; Victoria cited liaisons with several woman, but specifically mentioned a &quot;Sadie or Sada Mansfield&quot;, a 14-year-old &quot;woman of prostitution and ill-fame&quot; as co-respondent in the divorce action. The divorce also cited Behan&#x27;s threats of violence and unrelenting verbal abuse. Behan claimed their daughter Henrietta wasn&#x27;t his, and a request for support for Henrietta was stricken from the divorce petition.
Behan and his wife were divorced in less than a month, in June 1875. Behan moved for a time to the northwest Arizona Territory, where he served as the Mohave County Recorder in 1877. He lost an election for Mohave County deputy sheriff in Gillet in 1879, but was elected as Mohave&#x27;s representative to the Tenth Territorial Legislature. In the summer of 1879 he moved back to Prescott, the territorial capital. He opened a small business catering to miners and joined a few posses pursuing bandits. The &quot;Weekly Journal-Miner&quot; reported in October 1879 that Behan was planning on opening a business in the silver mining boom town of Tip Top in central Arizona. In November 1879, Johnny Behan opened his new saloon for business. While the town already had five saloons with five courtesans, Johnny&#x27;s new saloon had none.

During the 1880 census in Tip Top, Behan&#x27;s occupation was given as saloon keeper. Nineteen-year-old Sadie Mansfield, the same person his former wife Victoria had named in their divorce five years earlier, was also living in Tip Top. Her occupation was &quot;Courtesan&quot;.

In retelling her life story, Josephine Marcus retold many elements of her experience that corroborated facts in Sadie Mansfield&#x27;s history. These facts may explain why Josephine later thought of this time in her life as &quot;a bad dream.&quot; She said, &quot;the whole experience recurs to my memory as a bad dream and I remember little of its details. I can remember shedding many tears in out-of the way-corners. I thought constantly of my mother and how great must be her grief and worry over me. In my confusion, I could see no way out of the tragic mess.&quot;

===San Francisco===
In her Cason manuscript, Josephine or Sadie wrote that she and Dora were homesick and returned to San Francisco with Sieber&#x27;s help. If Sieber helped her, the only time period that fits Josephine&#x27;s story is when Sieber was in the Prescott area at Camp Verde from 1873 to 1875. Josephine said that Sieber, who was German and may have recognized Josephine&#x27;s German accent, guessed her situation and sent a telegram from Fort Whipple to her brother-in-law Aaron Weiner. She said Weiner used a connection he had in Prescott to help Josephine get home. In January 1876, Josephine or Sadie left Prescott, stopped at a Los Angeles hotel, and returned to San Francisco before March 6.

Josephine told the Earp cousins that she returned to San Francisco before the grand opening of Lucky Baldwin&#x27;s luxury Baldwin Hotel and Theater on the northeast corner of Powell and Market St., which opened on March 6, 1876. The opening date of the Baldwin Hotel is much earlier than the date Josephine said she left for Arizona with the Pauline Markham Troupe in 1879.

Josephine wrote much later that her family wanted to keep her &quot;escapades from the public.&quot; In her memoirs she wrote, &quot;the younger children (niece and nephew), and our friends were told that I had gone away for a visit. Mrs. Hirsch, because of Dora’s part in it was as anxious as my people (family), to keep it a secret. The memory of it has been a source of humiliation and regret to me in all the years since that time and I have never until now disclosed it to anyone besides my husband (Wyatt).&quot; She added, &quot;The fear and the excitement, the weeks of exhausting travel, chagrin over my own foolishness, all together proved too much for my strength. I developed St. Vitus Dance and was unable to attend school very much again. After a time however I very much improved in health so that within two years after my experience I was once more a normal healthy girl.&quot; If Josephine, as she said, left San Francisco at age 18, it&#x27;s unclear why she would still be attending school upon her return two years later. Like cerebral meningitis, St. Vitus Dance is a form of a streptococcus infection. The symptoms of St. Vitus Dance and meningitis are somewhat different, but both can be contracted from the same strain of bacteria through saliva. Both of Behan&#x27;s children, Henrietta and Albert, were ill with meningitis around 1877, and in July of that year, Henrietta died from the disease.

=== Behan proposes ===
In February or March 1879: The Prescott &quot;Weekly Journal-Miner&quot; reported that John Behan was visiting San Francisco. Josephine said Behan asked her to marry him and persuaded her parents to approve their engagement. She said Behan told her family that he could not leave his livery stable business long enough for a wedding in San Francisco. Some modern researchers question the likelihood that her father, a Reform Jew, would approve his daughter&#x27;s union with Behan, a man 14 years older than his daughter, an unemployed office-seeker, Gentile, and divorced father. Later in life, Josephine was not a practicing Jew and did not seem to care whether her partners were Jewish.

Josephine thought Johnny’s marriage proposal was a good excuse to leave home again. She wrote, &quot;life was dull for me in San Francisco. In spite of my bad experience of a few years ago the call to adventure still stirred my blood.&quot; Considering that Josephine reported in later life at having first arrived with the Markham Troupe on December 1, 1879, and that Josephine joined Behan in Tombstone that same year, her reference to &quot;my bad experience of a few years ago&quot; means she must have been in Arizona for some time before 1879.

=== Sadie in Arizona and San Francisco ===
Sadie Mansfield left Gillete, near Tip Top, and arrived in Phoenix on February 13, 1880. During the same week, Behan registered at the Bank Exchange Hotel in Phoenix, and on March 5 the Prescott &quot;Weekly Journal-Miner&quot; reported that Sadie had returned to Gillette from Phoenix on March 2.

On June 2, 1880, the U.S. census had recorded Sadie Mansfield, whose occupation was &quot;courtesan&quot;, as living in Tip Top. On June 1 or 2, 1880, William V. Carroll, the census enumerator for the 9th ward in San Francisco, visited the Marcus home. He lived about two blocks from the family, so he likely already knew the family. He recorded Josephine as a member of the Marcus household, information that may have been offered by her parents. But Josephine said that her parents hid her activities, and they may have been covering for her when the census taker appeared on their doorstep. In a set of extraordinary coincidences, Sadie Mansfield and Sadie Marcus had very similar names and initials and were known by their friends as &quot;Sadie.&quot; Both made a stagecoach journey from San Francisco to Prescott, Arizona Territory; both traveled with a black woman named Julia; both were sexual partners with Behan; both were 19 years old, born in New York City, and had parents from Germany. The only difference noted in the 1880 census is their occupation: Sadie in San Francisco is listed as &quot;At home&quot;, while Sadie in Tip Top is recorded as a &quot;Courtesan&quot;. (In the 1920 census, Sadie reported to the census taker that her family was from Hamburg, Germany, bordering Prussia.)

== Move to Tombstone ==
In September 1880, Behan and Sadie left Tip Top for Tombstone. Soon after they arrived, Behan&#x27;s ex-wife sent their eight-year-old son Albert to live with him. In reconstructing her life story, Josephine said years later that she actually lived with Kitty Jones and her husband, a lawyer, while working as a housekeeper for Behan. Boyer and other modern researchers argue that she actually lived with Behan. In Josephine&#x27;s version of her life story, she left San Francisco to join Behan to Tombstone in October 1880, and was hoping he would fulfill his promises to marry her. When he delayed, she was ready to leave him.

Josephine is quoted in &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot; that she received a letter and $300 from her father, urging her to return to San Francisco. The money was to cover her return trip, and it was ten times what she needed for the fare, and there is no record of him having sent the money to her. Rather than leave Tombstone, Josephine later wrote that Behan convinced her to use the money to build a house for them and continued their relationship. At the time, her parents, her sister Henrietta, and her brother Nathan were all living in a lower-class neighborhood south of Market Street in San Francisco with their daughter, her husband, their four children, and a boarder. Her father worked as a baker. It is unlikely that he was a &quot;wealthy German merchant&quot; as she described him.

While there are no records that her father sent her money, researchers have located records of money orders totaling $50 sent by Josephine to her family in San Francisco. One of these was sent after she ended her relationship with Johnny Behan, indicating that she was earning money as a single woman.

=== Kicks Behan out ===
In early 1881, Josephine returned to Tombstone after a trip to San Francisco. One version of the story is that she had taken Behan&#x27;s son Albert, who was hearing impaired, to San Francisco for treatment. Upon their return, they arrived late in the evening and a day earlier than expected, at the house built with her father&#x27;s money. Finding Behan in bed with the wife of a friend of theirs, she kicked him out.

=== Early relationship with Wyatt Earp ===

How and when she and Wyatt Earp began their relationship is unknown. Tombstone diarist George W. Parsons never mentioned seeing Wyatt and Josephine together and neither did John Clum in his memoirs. While there are no contemporary records in Tombstone of a relationship between them, they certainly knew each other, as Behan and Earp both had offices above the Crystal Palace Saloon.

In his book, &quot;The Tombstone Travesty&quot; (later republished as &quot;The Earp Brothers of Tombstone&quot;), Frank Waters quotes Virgil Earp&#x27;s wife, Allie, as saying that &quot;Sadie&#x27;s charms were undeniable. She had a small, trim body and a &quot;meneo&quot; of the hips that kept her full, flounced skirts bouncing. Sadie was an attractive woman, with thick, dark hair, vivid black eyes, and was well-endowed.

Some modern writers believe that Wyatt Earp moved in with Josephine after she kicked Behan out. But, in April 1881, less than eight months after Behan and Sadie built the house, she rented it to Dr. George Emory Goodfellow. At some point during August and September, Sadie and Wyatt may have become friends and perhaps more seriously involved. Writer Alan Barra suggests that Behan and Earp knew of their mutual attraction to the same woman before the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, which may have contributed to their animosity. Author Stuart Lake wrote in a letter that &quot;Johnny Behan&#x27;s girl&quot; was “the key to the whole yarn of Tombstone”.

A letter written by former New Mexico Territory Governor Miguel Otero appears to indicate that Earp had strong feelings for Josephine shortly after leaving Tombstone in April 1882. Following the Earp Vendetta Ride, the Earp posse went to Albuquerque, New Mexico for two weeks. While there, Wyatt stayed with prominent businessman Henry N. Jaffa, who was also president of New Albuquerque’s Board of Trade. Jaffa was also Jewish.

Wyatt and Holliday had been fast friends since Holliday saved Earp&#x27;s life in Dodge City during 1878. During their stay in Albuquerque, the two men ate at The Retreat Restaurant owned by &quot;Fat Charlie&quot;. Otero wrote in his letter, &quot;Holiday said something about Earp becoming &#x27;a damn Jew-boy.&#x27; Earp became angry and left…. [Henry] Jaffa told me later that Earp’s woman was a Jewess. Earp did mezuzah when entering the house.&quot; Earp&#x27;s anger at Holliday&#x27;s ethnic slur may indicate that his feelings for Josephine was more serious at the time than is commonly known. The information in the letter is compelling because at the time it was written in the 1940s, the relationship between Wyatt Earp and Josephine Marcus while living in Tombstone was virtually unknown. The only way Otero could write about these things was if he had a personal relationship with some of the individuals involved. The Earp party split up in Albuquerque, and Holliday and Dan Tipton rode on to Pueblo, while the rest of the group headed for Gunnison.

=== Names used in Tombstone ===
In June 1881, Sadie sent a postal money order to her mother using the name Josephine Behan, and Wyatt Earp was still living with his common-law wife Mattie Blaylock. The next month, in July 1881, Josephine Behan was reported to be leaving Tombstone by stage. But in August a Tombstone newspaper reported a letter waiting at the post office for Sadie Mansfield. Sadie was apparently no longer claiming to be Behan&#x27;s wife.

=== Presence after gunfight ===

Josephine is quoted in &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot; as saying that on October 26, 1881, the day of the shootout at the O.K. Corral, she was at her home when she heard the sound of gunfire. Running into town in the direction of the shots, Josephine was relieved to see that Wyatt was uninjured. Other researchers and writers aren&#x27;t even sure she was in town that day. No contemporary accounts place her at the scene of the gunfight afterward.

After the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against the Earps and Doc Holliday. During a month-long preliminary hearing, Judge Wells Spicer heard testimony from a large number of witnesses. &quot;The Tombstone Epitaph&quot; reported on November 11, 1881, that &quot;S. Mansfield&quot; from San Francisco had passed Colton, California (where Wyatt Earp&#x27;s parents lived) en route to Arizona, a few days before Wyatt&#x27;s testimony at the Spicer hearing.

=== Leaves Tombstone ===

During the next few months, until April 1882, Sadie Mansfield is recorded in various newspapers as traveling back and forth between Tombstone and San Francisco several times. &quot;The Epitaph&quot; reported on February 27, 1882, that S. Mansfield of Tombstone was returning from the west with other passengers, passing through Colton, California. In March 1882, Sadie sent a postal money order to her mother, Mrs. H. Marcus, in San Francisco. She didn&#x27;t use either Marcus or Behan as her name, but asked a friend to send the postal order for her.

Sadie, traveling as either Mrs. J. C. Earp or Mrs. Wyatt Earp, left Tombstone for her family in San Francisco via Los Angeles on March 24, 1882. This was one week after Morgan Earp was assassinated and five days after Wyatt set out in pursuit of those he believed responsible.

After the Earp Vendetta Ride ended in April 1882, Wyatt left Arizona for Colorado. Earp&#x27;s former wife, Mattie Blaylock traveled with other Earp family members in April 1882, to Colton, California, waiting for Wyatt to telegraph her and invite her to join him. Wyatt never sent for her and she moved to Pinal, Arizona, where she resumed life as a prostitute, eventually committing suicide by taking an overdose of laudanum. Sadie Mansfield reappeared in Tombstone when she was noted in the July 1882 Tombstone census, but Josephine Marcus and Josephine Behan were not. Sadie and John Behan lived at different addresses.

== Life after Tombstone ==
Josephine&#x27;s life after Tombstone and with Wyatt Earp is not well known, although it isn&#x27;t as obscured by stories of her life in Tombstone that she told to hide facts. The &quot;San Diego Union&quot; printed a report from the &quot;San Francisco Call&quot; on July 9, 1882, that Virgil Earp was in San Francisco (receiving treatment for his shattered arm) and that Wyatt was expected to arrive there that day. Following Wyatt&#x27;s return to San Francisco, Josephine began using the name of &quot;Josephine Earp&quot;. Wyatt took a job managing a horse stable in Santa Rosa. Earp developed a reputation as a sportsman as well as a gambler. He was reputed to own a six-horse stable in San Francisco, although it was learned later that the horses were leased. At Santa Rosa, Earp personally competed in and won a harness race. The &quot;Sacramento Daily Record&quot; reported on October 20, 1882, that Virgil had arrived in town from Tombstone to greet his brother Wyatt arriving from the east, although Virgil was living in Colton at the time.

=== Mining camps and boom towns ===
In early 1883, Josephine—or Sadie as Wyatt called her—and Wyatt left San Francisco for Gunnison, Colorado, where Earp ran a Faro bank until he received a request in April for assistance from Luke Short in Dodge City. In December 1883, they visited Galveston, Texas, and in March 1884 they were in Salt Lake City. Josephine and Wyatt traveled through various western states hunting for gold and silver mining they could invest in. In 1884, Wyatt and his wife Josie, his brothers Warren and James, and James&#x27; wife Bessie arrived in Eagle City, Idaho, another new boomtown that was created as a result of the discovery of gold, silver, and lead in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene area. (It&#x27;s now a ghost town in Shoshone County). Wyatt followed the crowd looking for gold in the Murray-Eagle mining district and paid $2,250 for a diameter white circus, in which they opened a dance hall and saloon called &quot;The White Elephant&quot;.

After the Coeur d&#x27;Alene mining venture died out, Earp and Josie briefly went to El Paso, Texas before moving in 1887 to San Diego where the railroad was about to arrive and a real estate boom was underway. They stayed for about four years, living most of the time in the Brooklyn Hotel. Earp speculated in San Diego&#x27;s booming real estate market. Between 1887 and around 1896 he bought four saloons and gambling halls, one on Fourth Street and two near Sixth and E, all in the &quot;respectable&quot; part of town.

The Earps moved back to San Francisco in 1891 so Josie could be closer to her family. Earp developed a reputation as a sportsman as well as a gambler. He held onto his San Diego properties but their value fell, but he could not pay the taxes and was forced to sell the lots. He continued to race horses, but by 1896 he could no longer afford to own horses, but raced them on behalf of the owner of a horse stable in Santa Rosa that he managed for her.

=== Marriage to Wyatt ===

Josephine wrote in &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot; that she and Wyatt were married in 1892 offshore by the captain of Lucky Baldwin&#x27;s yacht. Raymond Nez wrote that his grandparents witnessed their marriage off the California coast. No public record of their marriage has ever been found. Wyatt and Josie never had any children. Josie had two miscarriages during her life and was apparently unable to have children. She maintained a relationship with Johnny Behan&#x27;s son, Albert Price Behan, whom she had grown to love as her own son. They moved frequently, even when living in the same town. From 1891 to 1896, the Earps lived in at least four different locations in San Francisco: 145 Ellis St., 720 McAllister St., 514A Seventh Ave. and 1004 Golden Gate Ave. After moving to southern California in about 1903, they also lived in several different locations.

According to many who knew them, their relationship was often stormy. Wyatt had a mischievous sense of humor. He knew his wife preferred the name &quot;Josephine&quot; and detested &quot;Sadie&quot;, but early in their relationship he began calling her &#x27;Sadie&#x27;. Josephine frequently griped about Wyatt’s lack of work and financial success and even his character and personality. Wyatt would often go on long walks to get away from her.

Each may have engaged in extramarital affairs. Josephine could be controlling. Grace Spolidora was a teenager during the Earp&#x27;s many visits to her family&#x27;s home near Needles, California, and sometimes went to San Diego with them. She attributed the highly exaggerated stories about Wyatt Earp to Josephine. Sadie &quot;would always interfere whenever Wyatt would talk with Stuart Lake. She always interfered! She wanted him to look like a church-going saint and blow things up. Wyatt didn&#x27;t want that at all!&quot;

Among the facts Josephine wanted scrubbed from Earp&#x27;s history, she persuaded biographers Flood, Lake and Burns to write that Earp was a non-drinker. Charlie Welsh, Grace Spolidora&#x27;s father, was a good friend of Earp&#x27;s. He was known to disappear for days at a time &quot;to see property&quot;, the family euphemism for a drinking binge, and Earp was his regular partner. Director John Ford said that whenever Josephine left town for religious conventions, Earp would come into town, play poker, and get drunk with the cowboy actors.

=== Nevada to Alaska to Nevada ===
On August 5, 1897, Earp and Josie once again joined in a mining boom and left Yuma, Arizona for San Francisco. They planned to head for Alaska to join in the Alaska Gold Rush, but their departure was delayed for three weeks when Wyatt fell while getting off Market Street streetcar and bruised his hip. Josephine got pregnant at the same time, and she thought she could persuade Earp from heading to Alaska. He was in agreement, but Josephine, who was 37, miscarried soon after.

They boarded the steamship &quot;Rosalie&quot; for Nome, Alaska, on September 21. When they got to Wrangell, the season was already late, and they chose to winter in Rampart. They rented a cabin from Rex Beach for $100 a month and spent the winter of 1898–1899 there. He managed a small store during the spring of 1899 in St. Michael on the Norton Sound, a major gateway to the Alaskan interior via the Yukon River.

In the spring they decided the gold rush in Dawson was drawing to an end and headed for Nome instead. Earp and partner Charles E. Hoxie built the Dexter Saloon, the largest in Nome. Josephine gambled so recklessly that Wyatt cut her off and asked other gambling houses to do the same. She also gambled on the boats to and from Alaska.

In November 1899, they left Alaska for a period and went to Seattle, Washington, with a plan to open a saloon and gambling room. On November 25, 1899, the &quot;Seattle Star&quot; reported Earp&#x27;s arrival. Although gambling was illegal, the police were paid by John Considine, owner of the three largest gambling concessions, to look the other way. Considine tried to keep Earp from succeeding, and arranged for his establishment to be raided. The Earps returned briefly to San Francisco in April 1900, but they returned to Seattle before boarding the steamer &quot;SS Alliance&quot;. On June 14, 1900, Wyatt and Josephine were bound for Nome, Alaska.
Wyatt and Josie returned to Los Angeles on December 13, 1901, and stayed at the Hollenbeck Hotel. They had an estimated $80,000, a relative fortune (equivalent to about $ today). In February 1902, they arrived in Tonopah, Nevada, known as the &quot;Queen of the Silver Camps,&quot; where silver and gold had been discovered in 1900 and a boom was under way. He opened the Northern Saloon in Tonopah and served as a Deputy U.S. Marshal under Marshal J.F. Emmitt.

=== Desert cottage ===


After Tonopah&#x27;s gold strike waned, Wyatt staked mining claims just outside Death Valley and elsewhere in the Mojave Desert. In 1906 he discovered several deposits of gold and copper near the Sonoran Desert town of Vidal, California, on the Colorado River and filed more than 100 mining claims near the Whipple Mountains. Wyatt and Josie Earp summered in Los Angeles and lived in at least nine small Los Angeles rentals as early as 1885 and as late as 1929, mostly in the summer. They bought the only home they ever owned, a small cottage in Vidal, and lived there during the fall, winter and spring months of 1925 – 1928, while he worked his Happy Days mines in the Whipple Mountains a few miles north. Wyatt had some modest success with the gold mines and they lived on the slim proceeds of income from that and investments in Oakland and Kern County oil field. Josie&#x27;s three nieces, daughters of her half-sister Rebecca and husband Aaron Wiener, would frequently visit the couple during the winter months at their desert camp.

=== Life in Los Angeles ===
In about 1923, Charles Welsh, a friend who Earp had known since his time in Dodge City in 1876, and a retired railroad engineer, frequently invited the Earps to visit his family in San Bernardino, Needles, and later in Los Angeles. The Earps were frequent visitors and often spent the holidays with the Welsh family, but they did not appreciate Josephine&#x27;s gambling habits.

=== Gambling habit ===
Josephine loved to play poker and developed a serious gambling habit, losing heavily at times.

While they lived in San Diego, Wyatt raced Otto Rex, the horse he had won in a card game. The horse was a frequent winner and sometimes Wyatt bought Josephine some jewelry with the proceeds. To feed her gambling habit, Josephine would pawn the jewelry to millionaire Lucky Baldwin, but Wyatt would later buy the jewelry back. Josephine eventually sold virtually all of her jewelry to Baldwin. Josephine was addicted to gambling on horse racing and her wagering increased until Wyatt gave her an ultimatum. &quot;You&#x27;re not a smart gambler. And you have no business risking money that way. Now after this I&#x27;m not going to redeem any more of your jewelry.&quot; He also told Baldwin to stop lending money to Josephine, but she continued to gamble anyway. He was furious about her gambling habit, during which she lost considerable sums of money.

Wyatt refereed the Fitzsimmons vs. Sharkey boxing match on December 2, 1896, and was accused of fixing the outcome. He called a foul on Fitzsimmons that no one saw, and Wyatt was widely accused of taking a bribe. During an investigation of the boxing match by a panel appointed by San Francisco Mayor Washington Bartlett, they learned Josephine Earp was a &quot;degenerate horseplayer&quot; and that she frequently took loans out against her jewelry. The &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; ran a series of stories over three days describing Earp&#x27;s life in exaggerated detail that ridiculed him. Eager to escape the controversy over the boxing match dogging him, Earp gave up managing race horses in San Francisco and on December 20, 1896, he and Josie left for Yuma, Arizona.

In the 1920s, Wyatt gave Josie signed legal papers and filing fees to a claim for an oil lease in Kern County, California. She gambled away the filing fees and lied to Wyatt about what happened to the lease, which later turned out to be valuable. Distrustful of her ability to manage her finances, Wyatt made an arrangement with her sister Henrietta Lenhardt. Wyatt put oil leases he owned in Henrietta&#x27;s name with the agreement that the proceeds would benefit Josie after his death. Henrietta&#x27;s three children voided the agreement after their mother&#x27;s death and didn&#x27;t pass on the royalties to Josephine.

=== Later relationship with Wyatt ===
Grace Welsh Spolidora, Welsh&#x27;s daughter, spent a lot of time with the Earps. She said that during the last years of Wyatt&#x27;s life, Josephine received an allowance from her family and gambled it away, often leaving Wyatt hungry. Wyatt became critically ill in late 1928. Grace recalled that Josie, who had never had many domestic skills, did very little housekeeping or cooking for Wyatt. She and her sister-in-law Alma were concerned about the care Josie gave Wyatt. Even though he was very ill, she still didn&#x27;t cook for him. Grace, her sisters, Alma, and her mother brought in meals.

Wyatt died on January 13, 1929. Grace Welsh and her sister-in-law Alma were the legal witnesses to Wyatt&#x27;s cremation. Josephine was apparently too full of grief to assist or to attend the funeral itself. Grace was upset that Josephine didn&#x27;t attend. &quot;She didn&#x27;t go to his funeral, even. She wasn&#x27;t that upset. She was peculiar. I don&#x27;t think she was that devastated when he died.&quot; After Wyatt&#x27;s death, Josephine told her friends and family to stop calling her Sadie, Wyatt&#x27;s name for her, and insisted they call her Josie.

While in Los Angeles, Wyatt and Josephine became friends with many celebrities, including Cecil B. DeMille and Gary Cooper. In 1939 Josephine sued 20th Century Fox for $50,000 in an attempt to keep them from making the film titled &quot;Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal&quot;. With the provision that Wyatt&#x27;s name be removed from the title, the movie was released as &quot;Frontier Marshal&quot;. She received some royalties from the movie and one-half of the royalties earned by Stuart Lake&#x27;s book about her husband. After Wyatt died, Josephine spent her last years in Los Angeles.

=== Death and burial ===
When Wyatt died in 1929, Josephine Earp had his body cremated and secretly buried him in the Marcus family plot in the Jewish Hills of Eternity Memorial Park in Colma, California. Josephine died at age 83 on December 19, 1944, in the same bungalow she and Wyatt shared at 4004 W. 17th Street in the West Adams district of Los Angeles. She died penniless. Sid Grauman of Grauman&#x27;s Theater and cowboy actor and long-time friend of Wyatt Earp William S. Hart paid for her funeral and burial. Although she was never active in her Jewish faith, her service was conducted by a rabbi. Her body was cremated and buried next to Wyatt&#x27;s remains.

She paid for a small white marble headstone which was stolen shortly after her death in 1944. It was discovered in a backyard in Fresno, California. A second stone of flat granite was also stolen. On July 7, 1957, grave-robbers dug into the Earp&#x27;s grave in an apparent attempt to steal the urn containing his ashes, but unable to find them, stole the grave stone. Actor Hugh O&#x27;Brian, who was playing Earp in the 1955–61 television series &quot;The Life and Legend of Wyatt Earp&quot;, offered a reward for the stone’s return. It was located for sale in a flea market.

Cemetery officials re-set the stone flush in concrete, but it was stolen again. Actor Kevin Costner, who played Earp in the 1994 movie &quot;Wyatt Earp&quot;, offered to buy a new, larger stone, but the Marcus family thought his offer was self-serving and declined. Descendants of Josie&#x27;s half-sister Rebecca allowed a Southern California group in 1998–99 to erect the stone currently in place. The earlier stone is on display in the Colma Historical museum.

== In popular culture ==
In their later years Josephine worked hard to eliminate any mention that she had been Johnny Behan&#x27;s mistress or of Wyatt&#x27;s previous common law marriage to the prostitute Mattie Blaylock.

=== Book &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp&quot; ===


She successfully kept both women&#x27;s names out of Stuart Lake&#x27;s biography of Wyatt and after he died, Josephine may have threatened litigation to keep it that way. Lake corresponded with Josephine over several years, and he claimed she attempted to influence what he wrote and hamper him in every way possible, including consulting lawyers.

After Wyatt Earp&#x27;s death, Josephine insisted on being called Josie or Josephine. Josephine sought to get her own life story published and gained the assistance of Wyatt&#x27;s cousins Mabel Earp Cason and Cason&#x27;s sister Vinolia Earp Ackerman. They recorded events in her life but found Josephine was evasive about her early life in Tombstone. She approached several publishers for the book, but backed out several times due to their insistence that she be completely open and forthcoming, rather than slanting her memories to her favor. Josephine wanted to keep what she viewed as their tarnished history in Tombstone private. Josephine insisted she was striving to protect Wyatt Earp’s legacy. She was also in need of money, and tried to sell a collection of books to Lake while he was writing the book.

Josephine finally changed her mind and asked Wyatt&#x27;s cousins to burn their work, but Cason held back a copy, to which Glenn Boyer eventually acquired the rights, and is now in the custody of the Ford County Historical Society in Dodge City.

The University of Arizona Press published the book in 1976 under the title &quot;I Married Wyatt Earp: The Recollections of Josephine Sarah Marcus&quot;. It was immensely popular for many years, becoming the university&#x27;s fourth all-time best selling book with over 35,000 copies sold. It was cited by scholars and relied upon as factual by filmmakers.

Beginning in about 1994, critics began to challenge the accuracy of the book, and eventually many parts of the book were refuted as fictional. In 1998, a series of articles by Tony Ortega in the &quot;Phoenix New Times&quot;, including interviews with Glenn Boyer, argued that Boyer invented large portions of the book. In 2000, the University responded to criticism of the university and the book and removed it from their catalog.

The book has become an example of how supposedly factual works can trip up researchers, historians, and librarians. It was described by the &quot;Annual Review of Information Science and Technology&quot; in 2006 as a creative exercise that cannot be substantiated or relied on.

<text>Skutterudite is a cobalt arsenide mineral containing variable amounts of nickel and iron substituting for cobalt with the ideal formula CoAs3. Some references give the arsenic a variable formula subscript of 2–3. High nickel varieties are referred to as nickel-skutterudite, previously chloanthite. It is a hydrothermal ore mineral found in moderate to high temperature veins with other Ni-Co minerals. Associated minerals are arsenopyrite, native silver, erythrite, annabergite, nickeline, cobaltite, silver sulfosalts, native bismuth, calcite, siderite, barite and quartz. It is mined as an ore of cobalt and nickel with a by-product of arsenic.

The crystal structure of this mineral has been found to be exhibited by several compounds with important technological uses.

The mineral has a bright metallic luster, and is tin white or light steel gray in color with a black streak. The specific gravity is 6.5 and the hardness is 5.5–6. Its crystal structure is isometric with cube and octahedron forms similar to that of pyrite. The arsenic content gives a garlic odor when heated or crushed.

Skutterudite was discovered in Skuterud Mines, Modum, Buskerud, Norway, in 1845. Smaltite is an alternative name for the mineral. Notable occurrences include Cobalt, Ontario, Skuterud, Norway, and Franklin, New Jersey, in the United States. The rare arsenide minerals are classified in Dana&#x27;s sulfide mineral group, even though it contains no sulfur.

==Crystal structure==
The crystal structure of the skutterudite mineral was determined in 1928 by Oftedahl to be cubic, belonging to space group Im-3 (number 204). The unit cell can be considered to consist of eight smaller cubes made up of the Co atoms. Six of these cubes are filled with (almost) square planar rings of As, each of which is oriented parallel to one of the unit cell edges. The As atoms then form octahedra with Co in the center.

In crystallographic terms, the Co atoms occupy the 8c sites, while the As atoms occupy the 24g sites. The position of the Co atoms within the unit cell is fixed, while the positions of the As atoms are determined by the parameters x and y. It has been shown that for the As-rings to be fully square, these parameters must satisfy the Oftedahl relation x + y = 1/2. Any deviation from this relation yields a rectangular configuration of the As atoms; indeed, this is the case for all known compounds with this structure, and the As atoms do not form a perfect octahedron.

Together with the unit cell size and the assigned space group, the aforementioned parameters fully describe the crystal structure of the material. This structure is often referred to as &quot;the skutterudite structure&quot;.

==Applications==
Materials with a skutterudite structure are studied as a low cost thermoelectric material with low thermal conductivity. See also Skutterudite thermoelectrics.

<doc id="925573" wikidata="Q1361072" url="?curid=925573" title="Parthian shot">
<text>The Parthian shot is a light cavalry hit-and-run tactic made famous by the Parthians, an ancient Iranian people. While performing a real or feigned retreat at full gallop, the horse archers would turn their bodies back to shoot at the pursuing enemy. The maneuver required superb equestrian skills, since the rider&#x27;s hands were occupied by his composite bow and his body was twisted around. As the stirrup had not been invented at the time of the Parthians, the rider relied solely on balance to stay mounted and guide his horse.
==History==

In addition to the Parthians and their successors, the Sasanians, this tactic was used by most nomads of the Eurasian Steppe, including the Scythians, Xiongnu, Huns, Turks, Magyars, Koreans, Mongols, as well as the Urartians and the Comanche.

The Parthians used the tactic to great effect in their victory over the Roman general Crassus in the Battle of Carrhae.

A tactic similar to the Parthian shot was attributed to the Phoenicians from Sidon by Silius Italicus.

The tactic was also used by Muslim conqueror Muhammad of Ghor in the Second Battle of Tarain in 1192 against Indian elephants, heavy cavalry and heavy infantry, by Alp Arslan in the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 against the Byzantines, and by Subutai in the Battle of Legnica in 1241 against Polish knights.

==As metaphor==
The term &quot;Parthian shot&quot; is also used as a metaphor to describe a barbed insult, delivered as the speaker departs.

<text>Glenn Corbett (born Glenn Edwin Rothenburg; August 17, 1933 – January 16, 1993) was an American actor in movies and television for more than 30 years. He came to national attention in the early 1960s, when he replaced George Maharis in the cast of the popular CBS adventure drama &quot;Route 66&quot;. He followed this with roles in high-profile films and television shows, including a guest role in the original &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, the daytime soap opera &quot;The Doctors&quot;, the primetime soap &quot;Dallas&quot;, and movies such as &quot;Chisum&quot; with John Wayne, as one of Jimmy Stewart&#x27;s sons in &quot;Shenandoah&quot;, and the World War II epic &quot;Midway&quot;.

==Early years==
Corbett was born on August 17, 1933, in El Monte, California, the son of Sarah Bell (Holland) and John Warren Rothenburg, a garage mechanic.

After serving in the United States Navy as a Seabee, he met his wife Judy at Occidental College in Los Angeles, and with her encouragement, he began acting in campus theater plays. He was seen by a talent scout and was signed to a contract with Columbia Pictures. In his youth Corbett had done male modeling for photographer Bob Mizer.

==Film and television career==
Corbett&#x27;s film debut was in &quot;The Crimson Kimono&quot; (1959); it was followed with supporting roles in &quot;The Mountain Road&quot;, &quot;Man on a String&quot; (1960), and &quot; All the Young Men&quot; (all 1960). He took the lead role in William Castle&#x27;s suspense thriller, &quot;Homicidal&quot; (1961) and was cast as one of the sons of Jimmy Stewart&#x27;s character in the Civil War film &quot;Shenandoah&quot; (1965). In other film work, he starred as Pat Garrett, opposite John Wayne in &quot;Chisum&quot; (1970). He again co-starred with Wayne in &quot;Big Jake&quot; (1971). Later, he appeared in &quot;Nashville Girl&quot; (1976) and &quot;Midway&quot; (1976).

In 1963, Corbett replaced George Maharis on &quot;Route 66&quot;. Corbett, playing Lincoln Case, co-starred with Martin Milner during part of the third season and the fourth and final season of the series (1963–64). In 1964–65, he had a role on &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; as Lt. Tom Lockridge for two episodes.

Corbett&#x27;s other television roles in the early to late 1960s include Wes Macauley on &quot;It&#x27;s a Man&#x27;s World&quot; (1962–63). He was featured in 1964 as Dan Collins in an episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; titled &quot;Chicken&quot; in which a man gets an undeserved reputation as a gunman when he is found at a way station with four dead outlaws at his feet. Corbett was cast in a 1965 episode of &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Mighty Is the Word&quot;, in which he portrayed a gunfighter who finds religion and becomes a preacher, only to be confronted by a vengeful man whose brother he had killed. In the 1965–1966 season, Corbett guest-starred on &quot;The Legend of Jesse James&quot;. Corbett also guest-starred in an episode of &quot;The Virginian&quot;, entitled &quot;The Awakening&quot;, in which his character, David Henderson, is a destitute former minister who has had a crisis of faith and comes to Medicine Bow just as a dispute breaks out at a local mine over safety issues. He appeared as Chance Reynolds, a regular cast member on &quot;The Road West&quot; (1966–67). He guest-starred in the second season &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Metamorphosis&quot; (1967) as Zefram Cochrane, inventor of the warp drive.

In 1971, Corbett had a guest appearance with Mariette Hartley on &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; (episode: &quot;Phoenix&quot;). In the 1970s, he had guest-starring roles on the television shows &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;Cannon&quot;, &quot;The Streets of San Francisco&quot;, &quot;Police Woman&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, and &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;.

In 1976, Corbett joined the cast of the NBC daytime soap opera &quot;The Doctors&quot; as Jason Aldrich, and stayed on the series until 1981. Throughout the 1980s, Corbett was a recurring guest star on the long-running television series &quot;Dallas&quot; as Paul Morgan from 1983 to 1984, and then from 1986 to 1988.

==Death==
In January 1993, Corbett died of lung cancer at the Veterans Administration hospital in San Antonio, Texas, at the age of 59. He was buried in Fort Sam Houston National Cemetery, San Antonio.

<doc id="925576" wikidata="Q366063" url="?curid=925576" title="Yamaha CS-80">
<text>The Yamaha CS-80 is an analog synthesizer introduced by Yamaha Corporation in 1977. It supports true 8-voice polyphony, with two independent synthesizer layers per voice each with its own set of front panel controls, in addition to a number of hardwired preset voice settings and four parameter settings stores based on banks of subminiature potentiometers (rather than the digital programmable presets featured on the Prophet-5 introduced soon after). 

It has exceptionally complete performer expression features, such as a layered keyboard that was both velocity-sensitive (like a piano&#x27;s) and pressure-sensitive (&quot;after-touch&quot;) but unlike most modern keyboards the aftertouch could be applied to individual voices rather than in common, and a ribbon controller allowing for polyphonic pitch-bends and glissandos. 

Production of the instrument ceased in 1980. Vying with the Sequential Circuits Prophet-5 and Oberheim OB-X polysynths for the title, the CS-80 is often described as the pre-eminent polyphonic analog synthesizer, and, together with the monophonic Moog modular synthesizer, commands amongst the highest resale price of any synthesizer.

== Software and hardware emulations ==
There are plug-in instrument software emulations of the CS-80 for usage in digital audio workstation, music sequencer and other software which supports the plug-in formats. This includes the following plugins with the year they were first released:

* Arturia CS-80 V (2003)
* Cherry Audio GX-80 (2022)
** &quot;CS-80 emulation combined with its predecessor the GX-1.&quot;
* memorymoon ME80 (2009)
* Softube Model 77 (2024)
* Xils-Lab The Eighty (2025) 

There are no known hardware clones of the entire CS-80. At the 2014 NAMM Show, Studio Electronics premiered the Boomstar SE80 synthesizer which includes a cloned filter section of the CS-80. Black Corporation&#x27;s Deckard&#x27;s Dream (2017) and upcoming Deckard&#x27;s Dream MK2 (autumn 2024) are rackmount synthesizer with CS-80 inspired architectures and features which support polyphonic aftertouch using compatible third party external keyboards.

In 2015, Yamaha introduced the Reface CS, a 37 key mini synth, based on the CS-80.

== Vangelis ==

The Greek composer Vangelis used the Yamaha CS-80 extensively. He described it as &quot;the most important synthesizer in my career — and for me the best analogue synthesizer design there has ever been ... It needs a lot of practice if you want to be able to play it properly, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the only synthesizer I could describe as being a real instrument, mainly because of the keyboard — the way it&#x27;s built and what you can do with it.&quot;

Vangelis first used the CS-80 on his 1977 album &quot;Spiral&quot; and would continue to use it for the rest of his life. It was his main synthesizer during the late 1970s and much of the 1980s, featuring prominently on &quot;China&quot;, &quot;Opera Sauvage&quot;, the soundtracks for &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; and &quot;Blade Runner&quot; and the first three Jon &amp; Vangelis albums.

== Other users and appearances ==

Other users and prominent appearances of the Yamaha CS-80 include:

* Don Airey (used CS-80 in his work with Rainbow and with Ozzy Osbourne, including the &quot;Blizzard of Ozz&quot; tracks &quot;Mr Crowley&quot; and &quot;Revelation (Mother Night)&quot;) 
* Tony Banks (used CS-80 extensively on the Genesis album &quot;Duke&quot;)
* Roy Bittan (used CS-80 on various Bruce Springsteen tracks, including &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m on Fire&quot; and the main synth horn sound on &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot;)
* Kate Bush (used CS-80 on songs including &quot;Babooshka&quot; and &quot;Hounds of Love&quot;)

<text>Carnival Records was the name given to at least two record labels.

==Carnival Records (1961–1962)==
In 1961, Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss started a short-lived label that was the precursor to A&amp;M Records. They released two singles. &quot;Tell It to the Birds&quot;/&quot;Fallout Shelter&quot; by Dore Alpert was distributed by Dot Records outside California.

==Carnival Records (1962–1983)==
Jazz saxophonist Joe Evans set up Carnival Records label in the early 1960s and based it in New York and relocated in Newark, New Jersey, in 1963. Releasing 63 singles and two albums, the label focus was rhythm and blues and soul music. Joe Evans ran the label with a small staff that included his wife. The final record was released in 1983.

Carnival&#x27;s biggest success was The Manhattans, a band signed in August 1964.

Carnival Records is exclusively represented by Westwood Music Group.

<doc id="925580" wikidata="Q1154190" url="?curid=925580" title="Tatsuro Yamashita">
<text>, occasionally referred to as Tatsu Yamashita or Tats Yamashita, is a Japanese singer-songwriter and record producer, who is known for pioneering the city pop style of music. 

His most well-known song is &quot;Christmas Eve&quot;, a best-selling song released in Japan in the 1980s. It has appeared on the Japanese charts for over 35 consecutive years.

He is known for his collaborations with his wife Mariya Takeuchi on many songs, including &quot;Plastic Love&quot;, and the American songwriter Alan O&#x27;Day, with whom he co-wrote the songs &quot;Your Eyes&quot;, &quot;Magic Ways&quot;, &quot;Love Can Go the Distance&quot;, and &quot;Fragile&quot;. He is sometimes called the &quot;king&quot; of city pop.

Yamashita is considered a major contributor to Japanese music and is ranked by HMV Japan as the sixth among the top 100 Japanese Artists.

== Career ==
Yamashita was a member of the band Sugar Babe with musicians Taeko Onuki and Kunio Muramatsu, who released their only album &quot;Songs&quot; in 1975. After the group disbanded in 1976, Yamashita signed to RCA and launched his solo career, releasing the album &quot;Circus Town&quot; the same year. Also in 1976, he teamed up with Eiichi Ohtaki, the producer of Sugar Babe, and Sugar Babe member Ginji Ito to release &quot;Niagara Triangle Vol. 1&quot; which was cited by MTV as one of the finest collaborative efforts of that period. His 1979 award-winning album &quot;Moonglow&quot; gained only moderate success, but his 1980 song &quot;Ride on Time&quot; reached No. 3 on the Japanese Oricon chart and the album of the same name topped the chart subsequently, propelling him to stardom.

Tatsuro&#x27;s music has been regarded as a symbol of Japanese city pop, as represented by &quot;Ride on Time&quot; and &quot;For You&quot; in the early 1980s.

In 2011, Yamashita&#x27;s newly-released album &quot;Ray of Hope&quot; topped the weekly Oricon Albums Chart, making him the fourth singer to have topped the chart at least once per decade for four decades running.

He has been called a &quot;sound craftsman&quot; because of his commitment to music-making. A mutli-faceted musician, some of his songs are recorded entirely by himself, including vocal backup, guitar arrangement, synthesizer, and percussion. His music is heavily acoustic, but also demonstrates a wide range of knowledge about analog and digital recording, and latest musical production technology, including computer programming.

&quot;Christmas Eve&quot;, one of Yamashita&#x27;s best-known songs in Japan and the best-selling Japanese single of the 1980s, first appeared on his 1983 album &quot;Melodies&quot;. It topped the charts in 1990 and has since ranked in the top 100 on the Japanese charts every Christmas season. The song was most famously a commercial song for JR Central&#x27;s &quot;Xmas Express.&quot; It has sold nearly 2 million copies since its release and continues to be sold in small quantities as a limited edition every Christmas season. The English-version of the song, with lyrics by Alan O&#x27;Day, was also recorded by Yamashita and has been covered by artists such as Pentatonix, the Commodores, All-4-One, and Idina Menzel. 

As a solo artist, Yamashita has released 13 original studio albums, five cover albums, two live albums, multiple compilations, and over 50 singles. He is the most commercially successful Japanese male solo recording artist in the history of the Japanese album chart, selling approximately 9 million albums in total. He has also composed for films and television commercials, and worked on records by other artists. Yamashita frequently collaborated with Alan O&#x27;Day, who wrote the English lyrics for some of his most popular songs, such as “Christmas Eve”. He has also collaborated with his wife Mariya Takeuchi, whom he married in 1982. They have one daughter.

==Controversy==
, a Japanese record producer, who discussed Johnny Kitagawa&#x27;s sexual harassment allegations in various media outlets, had his management contract terminated by , to which he had belonged. He alleged that Yamashita and his wife Mariya Takeuchi, who also belong to the company, were in agreement with the company&#x27;s policy.

<doc id="925586" wikidata="Q360638" url="?curid=925586" title="Yoshito Usui">
<text>was a Japanese manga artist known for the popular &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot; series. He was born in Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan.

==Personal life==
In 1977, he graduated from Saitama Kasukabe technical high school (埼玉県立春日部工業高等学校). After graduating he attended a part-time design-related college but dropped out. In 1979, he joined an advertising company called POP Advertising. He made his debut as a cartoonist in 1987 when &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot; began running his &quot;Darakuya Store Monogatari&quot;.

In August 1990, his series &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot; began running in &quot;Weekly Manga Action&quot;, the series started as a spin-off of the character Shinnosuke Nikaido (二階堂信之介) of Darakuya Store Monogatari. An animated series based on the comics began in 1992, and a &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot; boom followed the release of a 1993 animated film. For a year beginning in 1995, Usui&#x27;s &quot;Super Shufu Tsukimi-San&quot; comic strip ran in the magazine &quot;Manga Life&quot;.

Usui was a devotee of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses who had a church facility constructed adjacent to his home in 1994. He was known in the industry to read out the New Testament for a full 20 minutes at each meeting with his publisher and handing them out copies of the Bible as a gift.

He and his wife raised two daughters; both had moved out of the house at the time of Usui&#x27;s death.

== Death ==
On September 12, 2009, Usui&#x27;s family reported him missing from his hometown of Kasukabe when Usui did not return from hiking in nearby Gunma Prefecture. On September 19, 2009, a body with clothes matching those described in the report filed by Usui&#x27;s family was found at the bottom of a cliff at Mount Arafune in Gunma. The body was identified by dental records and family members the next day as being that of Usui. His camera was recovered and the final shot was taken from the cliff.

His funeral was held September 23 in a private service. It was attended by three thousand people.

==Legacy==
ONE or Tomohiro, the creator of One Punch Man and Mob Psycho 100, cites the manga series &quot;Crayon Shin-chan&quot; by Usui as having influenced his decision to become a manga artist.

<text>Anthony Edward Charles Rayner (born 19 November 1952) is a New Zealand musician who spent ten years as a keyboardist in the band Split Enz. He has also played in the groups Orb, Space Waltz, Crowded House, the Makers, The Angels in 1986-1987 and 801.

== Biography ==
Rayner was born in Lower Hutt, New Zealand, in 1952.

Rayner has released two solo albums. The first, &quot;Horse&quot;, was an instrumental offering released in 1995, recorded entirely at Rayner&#x27;s home studio in Melbourne, Australia. The second was entitled &quot;Play it Straight&quot;, a play on a Philip Judd Split Enz song called &quot;Play it Strange&quot; that was a particular favourite of Rayner&#x27;s during the mid- to late-1970s. The song was not released at the time, but was played live when Judd rejoined the band in 1977. &quot;Play it Straight&quot; consisted of re-arranged and re-recorded versions of material gleaned from other New Zealand composers.

Rayner&#x27;s keyboard talents were a notable part of the Split Enz sound. Paul McCartney caught one of their shows in 1979 and became a fan of the band, eventually inviting Rayner to play keyboards on his sixth solo album, &quot;Press to Play&quot;, which was released in 1986. Rayner has also produced material for many artists including Models, Margaret Urlich, Rikki Morris, Margot Smith, and The Exponents, as well as two Enzso recordings with Split Enz members, Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra.

During the late 1990s Eddie Rayner decided to take the Split Enz songs to an orchestral setting. This sparked the idea for the Enzso project. Along with his synth, the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra, some Newland Singers and some former members of Split Enz, he created orchestral versions for Split Enz songs. The project ended between late 1999 and early 2000.

Recently he has acted as musical director for television show &quot;New Zealand Idol&quot;, and participated in reunions of Split Enz and Space Waltz. He is also a member of the 1960s cover band The Con-Rays. He has also recorded with Double Life, whose other members are guitarist Adrian Stuckey, Mark Dennison (sax, flute and clarinet), and drummer Patrick Kuhtze.

In 2022, Rayner collaborated with Tim Finn on a project called Forenzics. The resulting album, &quot;Shades and Echoes&quot;, used elements from early Split Enz songs combined with Rayner&#x27;s jams with Double Life.

Rayner has performed Split Enz songs along with other ex-Split Enz members, such as a 2013 tour that included other ex-members Mike Chunn, Geoff Chunn, Emlyn Crowther, and Wally Wilkinson. Vocalists on that tour included The X Factor victor Jackie Thomas, contestant Tom Batchelor, and guest vocalists Annie Crummer, Rima Te Wiata, Rikki Morris and Jesse Sheehan.

Eddie&#x27;s son Harley Rayner is a member of dub band Mt Eden.

==Instruments==

During the career of Split Enz, Rayner used a wide, changing array of keyboards. In the band&#x27;s early progressive rock incarnation keyboards he used included grand piano, organ, clavinet and a Mellotron, but his mainstays during the band&#x27;s most popular phase were a Yamaha CP-80 electro-acoustic piano, a Yamaha CS-80 synthesizer and a Prophet 5. When he played keyboards for Crowded House on tour during the late 1980s, he was seen to be using a Yamaha DX7 and a Yamaha Clavinova. Later, during Split Enz reunion tours, Rayner used a Yamaha Motif, Ensoniq TS12 and a Clavia Nord Wave.

<text>Slovenj Gradec (; &quot;, &quot;after about 1900 &quot;Windischgraz&quot;) is a town in northern Slovenia. It is the centre of the Urban Municipality of Slovenj Gradec. It is part of the historical Styria region, and since 2005 it has belonged to the NUTS-3 Carinthia Statistical Region. It is located in the Mislinja Valley at the eastern end of the Karawanks mountain range, about west of Maribor and northeast of Ljubljana.

==History==
&quot;Gradec&quot;, Slovene for &#x27;little castle&#x27;, was first mentioned in a 1091 deed, then part of the Imperial March of Styria. The prefix &quot;Windisch&quot; (the traditional German name for Slavs in general and Slovenes in particular) was added to distinguish it from the city Graz (whose name has the same etymology). The modern Slovene name, Slovenj Gradec (literally: the Slovene Graz), derives from this German denomination. From 1180 until 1918, Slovenj Gradec belonged to the Duchy of Styria, since 1804 a crown land of the Austrian Empire. It was the ancestral seat of the Windisch-Graetz noble family first documented in 1220. Upon the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918, with the rest of Lower Styria, it was included in the newly established Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.
Until 1918, the town was a German-speaking island in a Slovene-speaking area. In the 1880 census, the town was 75 percent German-speaking and 25 percent Slovene-speaking. Many inhabitants, like the family of the composer Hugo Wolf, were of mixed ethnic origin. After the end of World War I, many of the local German-speaking inhabitants emigrated to Austria. Those who remained were gradually assimilated into the now Slovene-speaking majority. During World War Two, the town was occupied by the Nazis and annexed to the Third Reich. The local Slovenes were submitted to a policy of violent Germanization and many died of various persecutions. The partisan insurgency developed in the area, especially in the hills to the east of the town. After World War II, the remaining ethnic Germans were expelled from Yugoslavia, and Slovenj Gradec lost its traditional presence of German speakers.

From the 1950s onward, the town experienced a rapid industrialization and eventually became the unofficial economic and political center for Slovenian Carinthia. In 1994, it became one of the 11 municipalities in Slovenia with the status of Urban Municipality.

==Climate==
==Main sights==
The parish church in the town is dedicated to Saint Elizabeth of Hungary and belongs to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Maribor. It was first mentioned in written documents from 1235. Next to it stands a Gothic chapel dedicated to the Holy Spirit with frescos dating to the mid-15th century.

In 1994, an archaeological excavation uncovered the remains of what is believed to be the oldest church in Styria, dating to the Carolingian period (second half of the 9th century).

The Slovenj Gradec Art Gallery () was founded in 1957 and is located on the first floor of the old town hall in the town centre. The gallery hosted international fine art exhibitions under the sponsorship of the United Nations in 1966, 1975, 1979, 1985, and 1991. The 1997 exhibition &quot;The Artist and Urban Environment&quot; displayed art activity in Peace Messenger Cities from all over the world. In 2012, Slovenj Gradec and Ptuj were partners with Maribor, the European Capital of Culture. As a result, the gallery presented further exhibitions that attracted Europe-wide attention.

<text>Bereg (; ) was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now mostly in western Ukraine and a smaller part in northeastern Hungary. The capital of the county was Beregszász (&quot;Berehove&quot; in Ukrainian, &quot;Berehovo&quot; in Rusyn, &quot;Bergsaß&quot; in German, &quot;Beregovo&quot; in Russian, &quot;Bereg&quot; in Romanian).

==Geography==

Bereg county shared borders with the Austrian crownland Galicia (now in Poland and Ukraine) and the Hungarian counties Máramaros, Ugocsa, Szatmár, Szabolcs and Ung. It was situated between the Carpathian Mountains in the north and the river Tisza in the south. Its area was 3788 km2 around 1910.

==History==
Bereg is one of the oldest counties in Hungary. In 1920 the Treaty of Trianon assigned most of the territory to Czechoslovakia. The southwestern part remained in Hungary and the county of Szatmár-Ugocsa-Bereg was created in 1923. 

Following the First Vienna Award Szatmár County was recreated, thus Bereg-Ugocsa county was created with Beregszász as capital. In 1939, after the breakup of Czechoslovakia the complete county was occupied and annexed by Hungary, however the redeemed territories of the former county remained separate as the administrative branch offices of Bereg.

After the Second Vienna Award, the county was recreated again.

After World War II, most of the territory of Bereg county became part of the Soviet Union, Ukrainian SSR, Zakarpattia Oblast. The remainder was merged into the newly formed Szatmár-Bereg County. In 1950 it became part of Szabolcs-Szatmár County, which was renamed in 1990 to Szabolcs-Szatmár-Bereg.

Since 1991, when the Soviet Union split up, the Zakarpattya region is part of Ukraine.

<text>Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids (stylized as either Nick GaS or Nickelodeon GaS and commonly known as Nick GAS) was an American cable television network that was part of MTV Networks&#x27; suite of digital cable channels. The channel was available to all digital cable providers and satellite provider Dish Network. With its focus on classic Nickelodeon game shows (most of which had been removed from the parent network between 1999 and 2002), Nick GAS was essentially a children&#x27;s version of (and Viacom&#x27;s answer to) Game Show Network and ESPN.

The VP/General Manager of the network was Nickelodeon executive Mark Offitzer, producer of numerous Nick specials including the &quot;Kids Choice Awards&quot;. Summer Sanders was named on-air Commissioner of the network; Dave Aizer (1999–2003) and Vivianne Collins (1999–2003) were the network&#x27;s original on-air hosts, with Mati Moralejo (2001–05) joining soon after and later on Nadine (2004) and George (2004) separately during commercials.

==History==
Nickelodeon Games and Sports for Kids (or Nickelodeon GAS) was announced on November 3, 1998. The channel had been in development for months as Nickelodeon conducted research among children to determine their sports-related interests.

Nick GAS launched on March 1, 1999. Olympic skater Tara Lipinski joined the new network as a special host and sports correspondent. Upon launch, Nick GAS reached less than a million of the 70 million-plus cable and satellite subscribers in the U.S. However, it soon became one of the most sought-after channels among cable operators. Its programming primarily consisted of children&#x27;s game shows and sports-related programs from parent network Nickelodeon.

Nick GAS also produced its own original programming, such as &quot;Play to Z&quot;, &quot;Gamefarm&quot; and &quot;Splash TV&quot;. GAS also featured original blocks &quot;Camp GAS&quot; during the summer, &quot;Double Dare Double Play&quot; (both removed in 2004), and &quot;Pumping GAS&quot; (removed in 2005).

In place of commercials, Nick GAS aired interstitial segments, some of which were produced at Nickelodeon on Sunset and the defunct Nickelodeon Studios at Universal Studios Florida, promos for Nick GAS original programming, aired during commercial breaks. However, in-show advertising (like consolation and grand prizes of the network&#x27;s shows) were left intact, as it was part of the show itself.

The studio segments in the &quot;GAS Garage&quot; often included competitions between families, or interviews with athletes and other celebrities. Programs were usually grouped together in the blocks &quot;Heads Up!&quot;, &quot;Wild Card&quot;, &quot;Family Fuel&quot;, &quot;Extreme GAS&quot; (all removed in 2002) and aired during commercial breaks. Other interstitials included &quot;Heroes of the Game&quot;, &quot;GAS Grill&quot;, &quot;Trade Tricks&quot;, &quot;Time Out&quot;, T.U.M.E.G., &quot;Skill Drill&quot;, &quot; The MLS Play of the Week&quot;, &quot;Global GAS&quot;, &quot;Home Turf Highlights&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s Just Play&quot;, &quot;In Play Today&quot;, &quot;All Access&quot;, &quot;FastBreak&quot;, &quot;GasCaster Report&quot;, and in the early years of the network &quot;This Day in Sports History&quot;.

From October 31, 2005, onwards, Nick GAS&#x27;s programming was fully automated, putting seven shows on a permanent timeslot (&quot;GUTS&quot;, &quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot;, &quot;Figure It Out&quot;, &quot;Get the Picture&quot;, &quot;Double Dare 2000&quot;, &quot;Nick Arcade&quot; and &quot;Finders Keepers&quot;) and regular segments. In September 2006, &quot;Finders Keepers&quot; was removed from the network, leaving only six shows on the channel in its last years.

===Shutdown===
On August 13, 2007, Viacom announced that Nick GAS would shut down at the end of the year. It was replaced by a 24-hour version of Noggin&#x27;s teen-oriented block The N, which started airing on Noggin in April 2002.

On December 31, 2007, Nick GAS officially closed at 6:00 a.m. Eastern Time, after an episode of &quot;Figure It Out&quot;. Two bumpers were briefly aired afterwards, the second one being interrupted by The N&#x27;s programming stream, which aired &quot;Instant Star&quot; at the time of the transition. The N&#x27;s separate channel was subsequently replaced by TeenNick on September 28, 2009.

Dish Network retained an automated loop of Nick GAS on the air for 15 months, continuing to maintain the split of Noggin/The N manually on its existing channel slot. On April 23, 2009, Dish announced it would remove Nick GAS and replace it with the Pacific of Cartoon Network the following day, and it ended at 3:30 a.m. ET after an episode of &quot;Legends of the Hidden Temple&quot; before switching to the Pacific feed of Adult Swim in progress. Both Noggin and The N finally acquired their own 24/7 Dish channels weeks later, in time for the announced rebranding of both networks; The N had launched previously in November on Dish&#x27;s testing tier on channel 9476 before shifting to the regular Dish lineup at that time.

===Pluto TV revival as NickGames===
On November 19, 2019, Viacom announced the addition of several new networks to its Pluto TV video streaming service, including a new network called NickGames. The network featured much of the older Nickelodeon game show programming carried by Nick GAS, along with newer Nickelodeon competition and reality programming produced after Nick GAS&#x27;s demise. The network wound down on August 18, 2020. As of 2024, a similarly formatted channel exists under the title of &quot;No Parents Allowed&quot;, which includes Nickelodeon and non-Nickelodeon shows.

==Programs==

Most of the programming on GAS consisted of past Nickelodeon game shows, making up a library of 1,000 hours. Such programs included &quot;Double Dare&quot;, &quot;Nickelodeon Guts&quot;, &quot;Figure It Out&quot;, &quot;Wild &amp; Crazy Kids&quot;, and &quot;Sports Theater&quot; starring Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. The network also carried &quot;Renford Rejects&quot; from Nickelodeon&#x27;s UK network, and the television version of &quot;Sports Illustrated for Kids&quot; originally aired by CBS.

In its early years, Nick GAS signed deals with several sports associations which would provide exclusive game coverage and short features. Nick GAS also aired non-game programming such as &quot;Salute Your Shorts&quot;, &quot;Speed Racer X&quot;, and &quot;Rocket Power&quot; (all of which mainly involved extreme sports and competition).

The network also aired a one-hour block of video game programming on Saturday nights from 2003 to 2004. &quot;Play to Z&quot; (mainly re-purposed content from the UK-based Game Network) and &quot;Gamefarm&quot; (an original series featuring video game news and competitions) aired during this time. Nick GAS also acquired reruns of &quot;Nickelodeon Robot Wars&quot;, a program adapted from the UK original.

<text>Julius J. Epstein (August 22, 1909December 30, 2000) was an American screenwriter, who had a long career, best remembered for his screenplay, written with his twin brother, Philip, and Howard E. Koch, of the film &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), for which the writers won an Academy Award. It was adapted from an unpublished play, &quot;Everybody Comes to Rick&#x27;s,&quot; written by Murray Bennett and Joan Alison.

His identical twin died in 1952, a loss that he felt for the rest of his life. He continued writing, receiving two more Oscar nominations. In 1998, he received a Los Angeles Film Critics Association career achievement award. His credits included &quot;Four Daughters&quot; (1938) for which he received his first Oscar nomination, &quot;The Bride Came C.O.D.&quot; (1941), &quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1942), &quot;Mr. Skeffington&quot; (1944), &quot;The Tender Trap&quot; (1955), &quot;Light in the Piazza&quot; (1962), &quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot; (1964), &quot;Pete &#x27;n&#x27; Tillie&quot; (1972), &quot;Cross of Iron&quot; (1977) and &quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot; (1983).

Epstein had a less successful result as a playwright in Broadway theatre. He adapted his play &quot;Front Porch in Flatbush&quot; into &quot;Saturday Night&quot;, the first professional musical written by Stephen Sondheim. The musical was intended to open on Broadway in 1955, but was shelved due to the death of its lead producer. His play, &quot;But, Seriously&quot; (starring Richard Dreyfuss and Tom Poston) would prove to be the last to be staged at Henry Miller&#x27;s Theatre for more than 30 years, opening on February 27, 1969, and closing after only four performances.

==Biography==
Epstein was born Julius Epstein as a twin to his brother Philip to a Jewish family on August 22, 1909 on the Lower East Side of Manhattan in New York City, New York. Their parents owned a livery stable at a time when horses were widely used in the city. He and Philip both graduated from The Pennsylvania State University in 1931, where they were champions in boxing; Julius became an NCAA Bantamweight Champion. He graduated with a BA in Arts and Letters. He maintained close ties with Penn State throughout his life (often as a guest lecturer at the film school). At his request, he was buried in a Penn State polo shirt.

After college, the Epsteins went to Hollywood, hoping to work in the movies. They became successful screenwriters and began collaborating in 1939. They were noted for their Academy Award-winning &quot;Casablanca,&quot; written together with Howard Koch and the uncredited Casey Robinson.

Jack L. Warner, head of Warner Brothers, had a tortuous relationship with the Epstein twins. While he could not argue with their commercial acumen, he deplored their pranks, their work habits and the hours they kept. In 1952, Warner gave their names to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). They never testified before the committee, but on a HUAC questionnaire, when asked if they ever were members of a &quot;subversive organization,&quot; they responded, &quot;Yes. &quot;Warner Brothers&quot;.&quot;

Epstein married the actress Frances Sage and they had two children, James and Elizabeth. They later divorced. Epstein married Ann (1919-2003) and they had a son Philip, who died in 2000.

In 1994, he was interviewed by Walter Matthau.

He died on December 30, 2000, in Los Angeles, California.

==Career==
Epstein shared an Academy Award nomination for the screenplay of &quot;Four Daughters,&quot; written with Lenore Coffee (with Thyra Samter Winslow contributing to the treatment and Lawrence Kimble contributing to the script), as an adaptation from Frances Hurst&#x27;s novel, &quot;Sister Act.&quot;

In 1944, the Epstein brothers attempted their first film in the capacity of both writers and producers with &quot;Mr. Skeffington.&quot; The picture was a box-office success and won both Bette Davis and Claude Rains Oscar nominations. After leaving Warner Bros. in 1948, the Epstein brothers wrote five more screenplays together, two of which, &quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot; and &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, were released after Philip Epstein&#x27;s death in 1952.

==Notable quote==
About writing under the studio system of the 1930s and &#x27;40s, Epstein said in a 1984 interview:

There wasn&#x27;t one moment of reality in &#x27;Casablanca.&#x27; We weren&#x27;t making art. We were making a living. Movies in those days were prevented from reality. Every leading man had to be a great sexual athlete. Every boy and girl had to &#x27;meet cute,&#x27; and the girl had to dislike the hero when they met. If a woman committed adultery, she had to die. Now the woman who commits adultery is your heroine.

==Works==
*&quot;Four Daughters&quot; (1938), for which he received his first Oscar nomination for an adapted screenplay.

Together, he and his brother collaborated on the following:
*&quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942)
*&quot;The Strawberry Blonde&quot; (1941)
*&quot;The Bride Came C.O.D.&quot; (1941) 
*&quot;The Man Who Came to Dinner&quot; (1942) 
*&quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot; (1944)
*&quot;Mr. Skeffington&quot; (1944)
*&quot;My Foolish Heart&quot; (1949)
*&quot;The Last Time I Saw Paris&quot; (1954; released 2 years after Philip&#x27;s death)
*&quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; (1954; released 6 years after Philip&#x27;s death)

After his brother&#x27;s death in 1952, Epstein continued to write. His later films include: 
*&quot;The Tender Trap&quot; (1955) 
*&quot;Light in the Piazza&quot; (1962) 
*&quot;Send Me No Flowers&quot; (1964) 
*&quot;Return from the Ashes&quot; (1965)
*&quot;Pete &#x27;n&#x27; Tillie&quot; (1972) 
*&quot;House Calls&quot; (1978)
*&quot;Reuben, Reuben&quot; (1983)

He wrote screenplays for more than 50 films in his 50-year career.

==Family==
Epstein has two living children: a daughter, Elizabeth, and a son, James Epstein, who is a criminal lawyer in Los Angeles. Another son, Philip Epstein, died in 2000.

After his twin brother&#x27;s death, Epstein looked out for Philip&#x27;s son, Leslie, who became a novelist and director of the creative writing program at Boston University. Epstein was the great-uncle of Leslie&#x27;s children: Theo Epstein, former Chicago Cubs President of Baseball Operations and former Boston Red Sox general manager, and Anya Epstein, a television writer.

<text>Philip G. Epstein (August 22, 1909 – February 7, 1952) was an American screenwriter most known for his screenplay for the film &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), which won an Academy Award. He had written it in partnership with his twin brother Julius and Howard Koch as an adaptation of the unproduced play &quot;Everybody Comes to Rick&#x27;s&quot;, written by Murray Bennett and Joan Alison.

==Early life and education==
Epstein was born to a Jewish family in New York City and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan; his identical twin brother was Julius Epstein. Their father Harry was a livery stable owner in the days when horses were widely used in the city. He and his brother Julius attended Pennsylvania State College (now Penn State University), gaining his degree in 1931. Following college, Philip took up acting and Julius became a professional boxer.

==Marriage and family==
Epstein was married to Lillian Targan from 1932. His son Leslie Epstein directs the creative writing program at Boston University and is a novelist. In 2003, Leslie published a fictionalized version of his boyhood titled &quot;San Remo Drive: A Novel from Memory.&quot; His grandson Theo Epstein is a former baseball executive who previously served as the president of baseball operations for the Chicago Cubs and as the general manager of the Boston Red Sox. His granddaughter Anya Epstein is a screenwriter.

==Hollywood==
After college the Epstein twins headed to Hollywood, hoping to work in the movie industry. They became successful screenwriters. Jack L. Warner, head of Warner Brothers, had a love-hate relationship with the Epstein twin brothers. He could not argue with their commercial success, but he deplored their pranks, their work habits and the hours they kept. In 1952, Warner gave the brothers&#x27; names to the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). They never testified before the committee, but on a HUAC questionnaire, when asked if they ever were members of a &quot;subversive organization,&quot; they wrote, &quot;Yes. Warner Brothers.&quot;

Epstein died of cancer in Hollywood, California in 1952 at the age of 42. Julius outlived him by 48 years, dying in 2000 at age 91.

<doc id="925624" wikidata="Q407485" url="?curid=925624" title="Chrysocolla">
<text>Chrysocolla ( ) is a hydrous copper phyllosilicate mineral and mineraloid with the formula (&quot;x&quot; &lt; 1) or . 

The structure of the mineral has been questioned, as a 2006 spectrographic study suggest material identified as chrysocolla may be a mixture of the copper hydroxide spertiniite and chalcedony.

Chrysocolla typically forms amorphously.

==History==
The name &quot;chrysocolla&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek (&#x27;) and (&#x27;), meaning &quot;gold&quot; and &quot;glue&quot; respectively, in allusion to the name of the material used to solder gold. The word was first used by Theophrastus in 315 BC.

==Geology==
Chrysocolla has a cyan (blue-green) color and is a minor ore of copper, having a hardness of 2.5 to 7.0. It is of secondary origin and forms in the oxidation zones of copper ore bodies. Associated minerals are quartz, limonite, azurite, malachite, cuprite, and other secondary copper minerals. It is typically found as botryoidal or rounded masses and crusts, or vein fillings.

A 2006 study has produced evidence that chrysocolla may be a microscopic mixture of the copper hydroxide mineral spertiniite, amorphous silica and water.

==Jewelry==
Due to being somewhat more common than turquoise, its wide availability, and vivid, beautiful blue and blue-green colors, chrysocolla has been popular for use as a gemstone for carvings and ornamental use since antiquity. It is often used in silversmithing and goldsmithing in place of turquoise and is relatively easy to work and shape. Chrysocolla exhibits a wide range of Mohs hardness ranging from 2 through 7, which is dependent on the amount of silica incorporated into the stone when it is forming. Generally, dark navy blue chrysocolla is too soft to be used in jewelry, while cyan, green, and blue-green chrysocolla can have a hardness approaching 6, similar to turquoise. Chrysocolla chalcedony is a heavily silicified form of chrysocolla that forms in quartz deposits and can be very hard and approach a hardness of 7.

<text>Garden design is the art and process of designing and creating plans for layout and planting of gardens and landscapes. Garden design may be done by the garden owner themselves, or by professionals of varying levels of experience and expertise. Most professional garden designers have some training in horticulture and the principles of design. Some are also landscape architects, a more formal level of training that usually requires an advanced degree and often a state license. Amateur gardeners may also attain a high level of experience from extensive hours working in their own gardens, through casual study, serious study in Master gardener programs, or by joining gardening clubs.

==Elements==
Whether gardens are designed by a professional or an amateur, certain principles form the basis of effective garden design, resulting in the creation of gardens to meet the needs, goals, and desires of the users or owners of the gardens.
Elements of garden design include the layout of hardscape such as paths, walls, water features, sitting areas and decking, and the softscape, that is, the plants themselves, with consideration for their horticultural requirements, their season-to-season appearance, lifespan, growth habit, size, speed of growth, and combinations with other plants and landscape features. Consideration is also given to the maintenance needs of the garden, including the time or funds available for regular maintenance, which can affect the choice of plants in terms of speed of growth, spreading or self-seeding of the plants, whether annual or perennial, bloom-time, and many other characteristics.

Important considerations in the garden design include how the garden will be used, the desired stylistic genre (formal or informal, modern or traditional, etc.), and the way the garden space will connect to the home or other structures in the surrounding areas. All of these considerations are subject to the limitations of the prescribed budget.
===Location===
A garden&#x27;s location can have a substantial influence on its design. Topographical landscape features such as steep slopes, vistas, hills, and outcrops may suggest or determine aspects of design such as layout and can be used and augmented to create a particular impression. The soils of the site will affect what types of plant may be grown, as will the garden&#x27;s climate zone and various microclimates. The locational context of the garden can also influence its design. For example, an urban setting may require a different design style in contrast to a rural one. Similarly, a windy coastal location may necessitate a different treatment compared to a sheltered inland site.

===Soil===
The quality of a garden&#x27;s soil can have a significant influence on a garden&#x27;s design and its subsequent success. Soil influences the availability of water and nutrients, the activity of soil micro-organisms, and temperature within the root zone, and thus may have a determining effect on the types of plants which will grow successfully in the garden. However, soils may be replaced or improved to make them more suitable.
Traditionally, garden soil is improved by amendment, the process of adding beneficial materials to the native subsoil and particularly the topsoil. The added materials, which may consist of compost, peat, sand, mineral dust, or manure, among others, are mixed with the soil to the preferred depth. The amount and type of amendment may depend on many factors, including the amount of existing soil humus, the soil structure (clay, silt, sand, loam, etc.), the soil acidity/alkalinity, and the choice of plants to be grown. One source states that, &quot;conditioning the soil thoroughly before planting enables the plants to establish themselves quickly and so play their part in the design.&quot; However, not all gardens are, or should be, amended in this manner, since many plants prefer an impoverished soil. In this case, poor soil is better than a rich soil that has been artificially enriched.

===Boundaries===

The design of a garden can be affected by the nature of its boundaries, both external and internal. In turn, the design can influence the boundaries, including via creation of new ones. Planting can be used to modify an existing boundary line by softening or widening it. Introducing internal boundaries can help divide or break up a garden into smaller areas.

The main types of boundary within a garden are hedges, walls and fences. A hedge may be evergreen or deciduous, formal or informal, short or tall, depending on the style of the garden and purpose of the boundary. A wall has a strong foundation beneath it at all points, and is usually – but not always – built from brick, stone or concrete blocks. A fence differs from a wall in that it is anchored only at intervals, and is usually constructed using wood or metal (such as iron or wire mesh).

Boundaries may be constructed for several reasons: to keep out livestock or intruders, to provide privacy, to create shelter from strong winds and provide micro-climates, to screen unattractive structures or views, and to create an element of surprise.

===Surfaces===
In temperate western gardens, a smooth expanse of lawn is often considered essential to a garden. However, garden designers may use other surfaces, for example those &quot;made up of loose gravel, small pebbles, or wood chips&quot; to create a different appearance and feel. Designers may also use the contrast in texture and color between different surfaces to create an overall pattern in the design.

Surfaces for paths and access points are chosen for practical as well as aesthetic reasons. Issues such as safety, maintenance and durability may need to be considered by the designer. Gardens designed for public access need to cope with heavier foot traffic and hence may use surfaces – such as resin-bonded gravel – that are rarely used in private gardens.
===Planting design===
Planting design requires design talent and aesthetic judgement combined with a good level of horticultural, ecological and cultural knowledge. It includes two major traditions: formal rectilinear planting design (Persia and Europe); and formal asymmetrical (Asia) and naturalistic planting design.

====History====
Persian gardens are credited with originating aesthetic and diverse planting design. A correct Persian garden will be divided into four sectors with water being very important for both irrigation and aesthetics. The four sectors symbolize the Zoroastrian elements of sky, earth, water and plants. Planting in ancient and Medieval European gardens was often a mix of herbs for medicinal use, vegetables for consumption, and flowers for decoration. Purely aesthetic planting layouts developed after the medieval period in Renaissance gardens, as are shown in late-Renaissance paintings and plans. The designs of the Italian Renaissance garden were geometrical and plants were used to form spaces and patterns. The gardens of the French Renaissance and Baroque &quot;jardin à la française&quot; era continued the formal garden planting aesthetic.

In Asia the asymmetrical traditions of planting design in Chinese gardens and Japanese gardens originated in the Jin dynasty (266–420) of China. The gardens&#x27; plantings have a controlled but naturalistic aesthetic. In Europe the arrangement of plants in informal groups developed as part of the English Landscape Garden style, and subsequently the French landscape garden, and was strongly influenced by the picturesque art movement.

====Application====
A planting plan gives specific instructions, often for a contractor about how the soil is to be prepared, what species are to be planted, what size and spacing is to be used and what maintenance operations are to be carried out under the contract. Owners of private gardens may also use planting plans, not for contractual purposes, as an aid to thinking about a design and as a record of what has been planted. A planting strategy is a long-term strategy for the design, establishment and management of different types of vegetation in a landscape or garden.

Planting can be established by directly employed gardeners and horticulturalists or it can be established by a landscape contractor (also known as a landscape gardener). Landscape contractors work to drawings and specifications prepared by garden designers or landscape architects.
===Garden furniture===

Garden furniture may range from a patio set consisting of a table, four or six chairs and a parasol, through benches, swings, various lighting, to stunning artifacts in brutal concrete or weathered oak. Patio heaters, that run on bottled butane or propane, are often used to enable people to sit outside at night or in cold weather. A picnic table is used for the purpose of eating a meal outdoors such as in a garden room. The materials used to manufacture modern patio furniture include stones, metals, vinyl, plastics, resins, glass, and treated woods.

===Lighting===

Garden lighting can be an important aspect of garden design. In most cases, various types of lighting techniques may be classified and defined by heights: safety lighting, uplighting, and downlighting. Safety lighting is the most practical application. However, it is more important to determine the type of lamps and fittings needed to create the desired effects. 

Light regulates three major plant processes: photosynthesis, phototropism, and photoperiodism. Photosynthesis provides the energy required to produce the energy source of plants. Phototropism is the effect of light on plant growth that causes the plant to grow toward or away from the light. Photoperiodism is a plant&#x27;s response or capacity to respond to photoperiod, a recurring cycle of light and dark periods of constant length.

===Sunlight===

While sunlight is not always easily controlled by the gardener, it is an important element of garden design. The amount of available light is a critical factor in determining what plants may be grown. Sunlight will, therefore, have a substantial influence on the character of the garden. For example, a rose garden is generally not successful in full shade, while a garden of hostas may not thrive in hot sun. As another example, a vegetable garden may need to be placed in a sunny location, and if that location is not ideal for the overall garden design goals, the designer may need to change other aspects of the garden.

In some cases, the amount of available sunlight can be influenced by the gardener. The location of trees, other shade plants, garden structures, or, when designing an entire property, even buildings, might be selected or changed based on their influence in increasing or reducing the amount of sunlight provided to various areas of the property. In other cases, the amount of sunlight is not under the gardener&#x27;s control. Nearby buildings, plants on other properties, or simply the climate of the local area, may limit the available sunlight. Or, substantial changes in the light conditions of the garden may not be within the gardener&#x27;s means. In this case, it is important to plan a garden that is compatible with the existing light conditions.

===Renaissance formal gardens===

A formal garden in the Persian and European garden design traditions is rectilinear and axial in design. The equally formal garden, without axial symmetry (asymmetrical) or other geometries, is the garden design tradition of Chinese and Japanese gardens. The Zen garden of rocks, moss and raked gravel is an example. The Western model is an ordered garden laid out in carefully planned geometric and often symmetrical lines. Lawns and hedges in a formal garden need to be kept neatly clipped for maximum effect. Trees, shrubs, subshrubs and other foliage are carefully arranged, shaped and continually maintained. 
A French formal garden or &quot;jardin à la française&quot;, is a specific kind of formal garden, laid out in the manner of André Le Nôtre; it is centered on the façade of a building, with radiating avenues and paths of gravel, lawns, parterres and pools (&quot;bassins&quot;) of reflective water enclosed in geometric shapes by stone coping, with fountains and sculpture. The French formal garden style has origins in fifteenth-century Italian Renaissance garden, such as the Villa d&#x27;Este, Boboli Gardens, and Villa Lante in Italy. The style was brought to France and expressed in the gardens of the French Renaissance. Some of the earliest formal parterres of clipped evergreens were those laid out at Anet by Claude Mollet, the founder of a dynasty of nurserymen-designers that lasted deep into the 18th century. The Gardens of Versailles are an ultimate example of &quot;jardin à la française&quot;, composed of many different distinct gardens, and designed by André Le Nôtre.

English Renaissance gardens in a rectilinear formal design were a feature of the stately homes. The introduction of the parterre was at Wilton House in the 1630s. In the early eighteenth century, the publication of Dezallier d&#x27;Argenville, &quot; La théorie et la pratique du jardinage&quot; (1709) was translated into English and German, and was the central document for the later formal gardens of Continental Europe.

Traditional formal Spanish garden design evolved with Persian garden and European Renaissance garden influences. The internationally renowned Alhambra and Generalife in Granada, built in the Moorish Al-Andalus era, have influenced design for centuries. The Ibero-American Exposition of 1929 World&#x27;s Fair in Seville, Spain was located in the celebrated Maria Luisa Park (&quot;Parque de Maria Luisa&quot;) designed by Jean-Claude Nicolas Forestier.

Formal gardening in the Italian and French manners was reintroduced at the turn of the twentieth century. Beatrix Farrand&#x27;s formal Italian garden areas at Dumbarton Oaks in Washington, D.C., and Achille Duchêne&#x27;s restored French water parterre at Blenheim Palace in England are examples of the modern formal garden. The Conservatory Garden in Central Park of New York City features a formal garden, as do many other parks and estates such as Filoli in California.

The simplest formal garden would be a box-trimmed hedge lining or enclosing a carefully laid out flowerbed or garden bed of simple geometric shape, such as a knot garden. The more developed and elaborate formal gardens contain statuary and fountains.

Features in a formal garden may include:
*Avenue
*Bosquet
*Broderie
*Eyecatchers
*Garden sculpture

*Hedge maze
*Jeux d&#x27;eau
*Orangery
*Parterre
*Pavilion

*Pergola
*Reflecting pool
*Sylvan theater
*Terrace
*Topiary
*Trellis
===English Landscape and Naturalistic gardens===
The English landscape garden style practically swept away the geometries of earlier English and European Renaissance formal gardens. William Kent and Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown were leading proponents, among many other designers. The naturalistic English garden style (French:&quot; Jardin anglais&quot;, Italian: &quot;Giardino all&#x27;inglese&quot;, German: &quot;Englischer Landschaftsgarten&quot;) of the 1730s and on transformed private and civic garden design across Europe. The French landscape garden subsequently continued the style&#x27;s development on the Continent.
===Cottage gardens===

A cottage garden uses an informal design, traditional materials, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants. Cottage gardens go back many centuries, but their popularity grew in 1870s England in response to the more structured Victorian English estate gardens that used restrained designs with massed beds of brilliantly colored greenhouse annuals. They are more casual by design, depending on grace and charm rather than grandeur and formal structure. The influential British garden authors and designers, William Robinson at Gravetye Manor in Sussex, and Gertrude Jekyll at Munstead Wood in Surrey, both wrote and gardened in England. Jekyll&#x27;s series of thematic gardening books emphasized the importance and value of natural plantings were an influence in Europe and the United States. Also influential half a century later was Margery Fish, whose surviving garden at East Lambrook Manor emphasizes, among other things, native plant life and the natural patterns produced by self-spreading and self-seeding.

The earliest cottage gardens were far more practical than modern versions—with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, along with fruit trees, beehives, and even livestock if land allowed. Flowers were used to fill any spaces in between. Over time, flowers became more dominant. Modern day cottage gardens include countless regional and personal variations of the more traditional English cottage garden.

===Kitchen garden or potager===

The traditional kitchen garden, also known as a potager, is a seasonally used space separate from the rest of the residential garden – the ornamental plants and lawn areas. Most vegetable gardens are still miniature versions of old family farm plots with square or rectangular beds, but the kitchen garden is different not only in its history, but also its design.

The kitchen garden may be a landscape design feature that can be the central feature of an ornamental, all-season landscape, but can be little more than a humble vegetable plot. It is a source of herbs, vegetables, fruits, and flowers, but it is also a structured garden space, a design based on repetitive geometric patterns.

The kitchen garden has year-round visual appeal and can incorporate permanent perennials or woody plantings around (or among) the annual plants.

===Shakespeare garden===
A Shakespeare garden is a themed garden that cultivates plants mentioned in the works of William Shakespeare. In English-speaking countries, particularly the United States, these are often public gardens associated with parks, universities, and Shakespeare festivals. Shakespeare gardens are sites of cultural, educational, and romantic interest and can be locations for outdoor weddings.

Signs near the plants usually provide relevant quotations. A Shakespeare garden usually includes several dozen species, either in herbaceous profusion or in a geometric layout with boxwood dividers. Typical amenities are walkways and benches and a weather-resistant bust of Shakespeare. Shakespeare gardens may accompany reproductions of Elizabethan architecture. Some Shakespeare gardens also grow species typical of the Elizabethan period but not mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays or poetry.

===Rock garden===

A rock garden, also known as rockery or alpine garden, is a type of garden that features extensive use of rocks and stones, along with plants native to rocky or alpine environments. Rock garden plants tend to be small, both because many of the species are naturally small, and so as not to cover up the rocks. They may be grown in troughs (containers), or in the ground. The plants will usually be types that prefer well-drained soil and less water.
The usual form of a rock garden is a pile of rocks, large and small, aesthetically arranged and with small gaps between, where the plants are rooted. Some rock gardens are designed and built to look like natural outcrops of bedrock. Stones are aligned to suggest a bedding plane and plants are used to conceal the joints between the stones. This type of rock garden was popular in Victorian times, often designed and built by professional landscape architects. The same approach is sometimes used in modern campus or commercial landscaping, but can also be applied in smaller private gardens. 

The Japanese rock garden, in the west often referred to as &quot;Zen garden&quot;, is a special kind of rock garden which contains few plants. Some rock gardens incorporate bonsai. 

Rock gardens have become increasingly popular as landscape features in tropical countries such as Thailand. The combination of wet weather and heavy shade trees, along with the use of heavy weed mats to stop unwanted plant growth, has made this type of arrangement ideal for both residential and commercial gardens due to its easier maintenance and drainage.

===Native garden===

Natural landscaping, also called native gardening, is the use of native plants, including trees, shrubs, groundcover, and grasses which are indigenous to the geographic area of the garden.

Natural landscaping is adapted to the climate, geography and hydrology and should require no pesticides, fertilizers and watering to maintain, given that native plants have adapted and evolved to local conditions over thousands of years. However, these applications may be necessary for some preventive care of trees and other vegetation in areas of degraded or weedy landscapes.

Native plants suit today&#x27;s interest in low-maintenance gardening and landscaping, with many species vigorous and hardy and able to survive winter cold and summer heat. Once established, they can flourish without irrigation or fertilization, and are resistant to most pests and diseases. Many municipalities have quickly recognized the benefits of natural landscaping due to municipal budget constraints and reductions and the general public is now benefiting from the implementation of natural landscaping techniques to save water and create more personal time.

Native plants provide suitable habitat for native species of butterflies, birds, pollinators, and other wildlife. They provide more variety in gardens by offering myriad alternatives to the often planted introduced species, cultivars, and invasive species. The indigenous plants have co-evolved with animals, fungi and microbes, to form a complex network of relationships. They are the foundation of their native habitats and ecosystems, or natural communities.
Such gardens often benefit from the plants being evolved and habituated to the local climate, pests and herbivores, and soil conditions, and so may require fewer to no soil amendments, irrigation, pesticides, and herbicides for a lower maintenance, more sustainable landscape.

===Contemporary garden===

The contemporary style garden has gained popularity in the UK in the last ten years. This is partly due to the increase of modern housing with small gardens as well as the cultural shift towards contemporary design. This style of garden can be defined by the use &quot;clean&quot; design lines, with focus on hard landscaping materials like stone, hardwood, rendered walls.
Planting style is bold but simple with the use of drifts of one or two plants that repeat throughout the design. Grasses are a very popular choice for this style of design.

Garden lighting plays an integral role in modern garden design. Subtle lighting effects can be achieved with the use of carefully placed low voltage LED lights incorporated into paving and walls. With the combination of increasing demand for more efficient lighting, increasing availability of sustainable designs, light pollution considerations, and aesthetic and safety concerns, the methods and equipment of outdoor illumination have been evolving. The increasing use of LEDs, solar power, low voltage fixtures, energy efficient lamps, and energy-saving lighting design are examples of innovation in the field.

===Residential gardens===

A residential or private domestic garden such as the front garden or back garden is the most common form of garden. The front garden may be a formal and semi-public space and so subject to the constraints of convention and local laws. While typically found in the yard of the residence, a garden may also be established on a roof, in an atrium or courtyard, on a balcony, in windowboxes, or on a patio. Residential gardens are typically designed at human scale, as they are most often intended for private use. However, the garden of a great house or a large estate may be larger than a public park, and may contain specialized gardens (such as those for exhibiting one particular type of plant) and eyecatchers. 

Some early residential gardens include the Donnell Garden in Sonoma, California. The garden was designed by landscape architect, Thomas Church, with Lawrence Halprin and architect, George T. Rockrise, which was completed in 1948. The garden is currently regarded as a modernist icon and has been applauded for its well maintained garden of its time. The garden was recognized for its unique and organic forms that represented a modern style of California. The garden is on top of a hillside overlooking the northern area of San Francisco Bay.

===East Asian gardens===

Japanese and Korean gardens, originally influenced by Chinese gardens, can be found at private homes, in neighbourhood or city parks, and at historical landmarks such as Buddhist temples. Some of the Japanese gardens most famous in the Western world and Japan are Japanese gardens in the &quot;karesansui&quot; tradition. The Ryōan-ji temple garden is a well-known example. There are Japanese gardens of various styles, with plantings often evoking &quot;wabi-sabi&quot; simplicity. In Japanese culture, garden-making is a high art, intimately linked to the arts of calligraphy and ink paintin

<text>Travel Channel (stylized as Trvl Channel since 2018) is an American pay television channel owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, who previously owned the channel from 1997 to 2007. The channel is headquartered in Manhattan, with offices in Silver Spring, Maryland and Knoxville, Tennessee, U.S.

Travel Channel features documentaries, reality, and how-to shows related to travel and leisure around the United States and throughout the world. Programming has included shows on African animal safaris, tours of grand hotels and resorts, visits to significant cities and towns around the world, programming about various foods around the world, and programming about ghosts and the paranormal in notable buildings.

, Travel Channel is available to approximately 67,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2011 peak of 96,000,000 households.

==History==

=== Original format ===
The Travel Channel was launched on February 1, 1987; it was founded by TWA Marketing Services (a subsidiary of Trans World Airlines). The channel&#x27;s name was derived from the travel-related filler programming that aired between programs on the Home Theater Network. TWA purchased the name rights from Group W Satellite Communications in 1986, and took over HTN&#x27;s transponder spot following the shutdown of the premium cable channel in January 1987. In 1992, the network was sold to Landmark Communications, then-owner of The Weather Channel; five years later, Landmark sold it to Paxson Communications.

Discovery Communications acquired a 70% ownership stake in the channel in 1997, and subsequently acquired the remaining 30% interest from Paxson in 1999. In May 2007, Discovery Communications sold Travel Channel to Cox Enterprises subsidiary Cox Communications as part of a larger multibillion-dollar transaction.

On November 5, 2009, Scripps Networks Interactive acquired a 65% ownership interest in the network for $1.1 billion; the deal closed in January 2010. Following the purchase, Travel Channel began to add programming from sister networks such as Food Network In 2015, Scripps relocated the channel&#x27;s headquarters from Chevy Chase, Maryland to Knoxville, Tennessee.

On February 25, 2016, SNI acquired the remaining 35% stake in Travel Channel from Cox Communications, giving it full control over the network. Discovery regained ownership of the network on March 6, 2018, after acquiring SNI.

Available data shows that viewership peaked in Spring 2008 at 27.78 million views per 7 days, and has been in decline ever since. As of Spring 2017, the channel got 17.25 million views.

=== Rebrand and shift to paranormal programming ===
On October 1, 2018, Travel Channel revealed a new logo stylized as Trvl Channel, and shifted its programming to focus on &quot;the paranormal, the unsolved, the creepy and terrifying&quot;. From 2015 to 2017, Destination America had undergone a similar shift to paranormal programming themselves. Certain Travel Channel shows (such as &quot;Bizarre Foods&quot;, its spinoff series &quot;Bizarre Foods Delicious Destinations&quot;, &quot;Man v. Food&quot;, &quot;Food Paradise&quot;, &quot;Hotel Impossible&quot;, and &quot;Xtreme Waterparks&quot;) would move to either Destination America or Cooking Channel.

On January 12, 2021, it was reported that there were plans for selected Travel Channel programs to premiere exclusively on Discovery+ as timed exclusives.

==Programming==
==Outside the United States==
On March 22, 2012, Scripps Networks Interactive announced that it had agreed to pay £65 million (equivalent to US$102.7 million) to acquire Travel Channel International Limited, the UK-based broadcaster which operates across the Europe, Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific markets, but had no direct relation to the American television channel until then. The deal was completed on May 1, 2012, following regulatory approval.

In Canada, Travel Channel&#x27;s programming has aired on T+E, and later, DTour.

<doc id="925636" wikidata="Q1232048" url="?curid=925636" title="Transport in Beijing">
<text>[[Beijing]], as the capital and one of the four municipalities of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), is a transport hub, with a sophisticated network of roads, railways and two major airports. Five completed ring roads encircle the city with nine expressways heading in virtually all compass directions, supplemented by eleven China National Highways.

Transport in the capital is overseen by the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport.

==Road network==
===Ring roads===

The city is served by five completed ring roads. From the centre of the city outward, they are:

* 2nd Ring Road
* 3rd Ring Road
* 4th Ring Road
* 5th Ring Road
* 6th Ring Road

The &quot;1st Ring&quot; of Beijing refers to the historic tram route (now demolished) through Xidan, Ping&#x27;anli, Di&#x27;anmen, Beixinqiao, Dongdan and Tiananmen. No ring roads are built on this route but it is still called &quot;1st Ring&quot;. From that on, ring road built on Beijing&#x27;s historic city limit is called 2nd Ring.

===Expressways===

:&quot;Main topic: Expressways of Beijing&quot;

Nine toll expressways link Beijing to its suburbs, outlying regions, and other cities; these are:

* Jingzang Expressway (Madian Bridge to Badaling and Yanqing District)
* Jingcheng Expressway (Connects Beijing to Chengde in Hebei province)
* Airport Expressway (Sanyuanqiao to Beijing Capital International Airport)
* Jingtong Expressway (Dawang Bridge – Tongzhou District)
* Jingha Expressway (Beiguan Roundabout – Yanjiao in Hebei province)
* Jingshen Expressway (Sifang Bridge – Shenyang)
* Jinghu Expressway (Runs from Beijing to Shanghai)
* Jingkai Expressway (Yuquanying–Yufa)
* Jingshi Expressway (Liuliqiao–Shijiazhuang)

===China National Highways===

Eleven China National Highway routes depart from Beijing in virtually all compass directions:

* China National Highway 101 (Dongzhimen–Chengde–Shenyang)
* China National Highway 102 (Chaoyangmen–Harbin)
* China National Highway 103 (Fenzhongsi–Tianjin–Tanggu)
* China National Highway 104 (Yongdingmen–Fuzhou)
* China National Highway 105 (Yongdingmen–Zhuhai–Macau)
* China National Highway 106 (Yuquanying–Guangzhou)
* China National Highway 107 (Guang&#x27;anmen–Shenzhen)
* China National Highway 108 (Fuxingmen–Kunming)
* China National Highway 109 (Fuchengmen–Lhasa)
* China National Highway 110 (Deshengmen–Yinchuan)
* China National Highway 111 (Dongzhimen–Heilongjiang province)

===Traffic congestion===

Beijing as of 2011 has an estimated 5 million registered cars on its roads, so traffic congestion is widespread. Traffic in the city centre is often gridlocked and is only predicted to get worse as the number of vehicles on Beijing&#x27;s roads increase. It is predicted by 2016 Beijing will have over 6 million cars on its roads. To combat congestion the local government has rapidly been building the subway system adding more lines and working towards doubling the length of the subway system by 2015. In addition to this they have decreased the cost of fares in an attempt to encourage more people to use public transport. In 2008 Beijing introduced restrictions on the number of cars on its roads in attempt to reduce congestion and pollution during the Olympic games period. They did this by adopting odd-even traffic restriction on alternative days. Cars with number plates ending with odd numbers were restricted one day and the next day cars with number plates ending with even numbers were restricted. Drivers who were unable to use their cars did not have to pay road or vehicle taxes, costing the city around 1.3 billion yuan. On Feb 21, 2022, Beijing experienced its worst traffic in five years due to the beginning of school and reserved Olympic lanes remaining closed to the public.

==Urban public transportation==

Beijing has an extensive public transportation network of buses, trolleybuses, suburban rail and a rapidly expanding subway system.

===Beijing Subway===
The Beijing Subway now has 29 lines and 523 stations, covering . Subway travel is generally fast, clean, economical and during peak periods congested. As of 2023, on average, around 9.46 million journeys are taken on the metro each day, with this number increeasing to around 10.8 on working days. A ¥3 minimum fare that rises according to the distance travelled applies to all lines, except the Capital Airport Express (¥25) and the Daxing Airport Express (¥10 - ¥35). The electronic commuter fare card, &quot;Yikatong&quot; is accepted on all lines.
===Beijing Suburban Railway===
The Beijing Suburban Railway, a suburban commuter train service, is managed separately from the Beijing Subway. The two systems, although complementary, are not related to each other operationally. Beijing Suburban Railway is run as part of the China Railway Beijing Group.

There are 4 suburban railway lines currently in operation: Line S2, Sub-Central line, Huairou–Miyun line and Tongmi line.

===Bus, Trolleybus and BRT===


The Beijing Public Transport Holdings, Ltd. (&quot;BPT&quot;) is the main bus and trolleybus operator in the city. It is owned by the city and, as of 2009, operated nearly 28,000 buses (including trolleybuses) on 882 bus routes and delivered 5.03 billion rides in 2009. in 2011, Beijing had more than 28,343 buses carrying over 13.39 million person/trips a day. Over 1,100 Dual-mode trolleybuses operate on 29 routes and is gradually being expanded to combat urban air pollution. BPT also currently operates 4 bus rapid transit lines.

====Bus pass====
The BPT offered month-long bus passes until 2006.

====Bus enquiry services====
The BPT provides enquiry services via both its official website http://www.bjbus.com and a helpline: +86-10-96166.

==Taxi==

Taxi fares depend on the vehicle type: these start at CNY 13 for the first 3 kilometers, and go up by CNY2.30 per extra kilometer; the per-kilometer charge is based upon the make and model of the vehicle. After 10 pm the base fare goes up by 20%. Idling time is also factored into the total fare, which is CNY2.30 (CNY4.60 during rush hours of 07:00−09:00 and 17:00−19:00) per 5 minutes of standing or running at speeds lower than . All legal cabs will be part golden yellow or all black in color, and display their permits and paperwork on the dash board and windshield.

There are also many illegal cabs known as (&quot;heiche&quot;, meaning &#x27;Black Cabs&#x27; as in &quot;black market&quot; or &quot;illegal&quot;), which operate via a pre-negotiated fare.

Taxi-like services, including Pedicabs, are also widely used. A motorized or manual bicycle is probably the most commonly seen form, although pedicabs are still available in certain parts of the city. These quaint modes of transport also employ the pre-negotiated fare system

In 1999, the environmentally unsound &quot;bread cars&quot; (Minivans) (&quot;mianbao che&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;miandi&quot;) were decommissioned in a stringent manner. They used to charge CNY 1 per kilometre. Although it was sound, budget-wise, their poor environmental record and an increasing consciousness of the image of the capital were the factors that landed them in the dumpster. As of 2004, 1.20 RMB/km taxicabs were phased out, and as of 2006 all taxi fares were 2.00 RMB per km with the same 10 RMB starting fare for 3 km rule. The Hyundai Elantra is the common new type of taxi, along with the Volkswagen Jetta CiF.

==Intercity transportation==
=== Air ===
====Beijing Capital International Airport====

Beijing has two of the world&#x27;s largest airports. Beijing Capital International Airport (IATA: PEK) is located in bordering Shunyi and being northeast of the city center in Chaoyang. It is the second busiest airport in the world after Atlanta&#x27;s Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Capital Airport&#x27;s Terminal 3, built during the expansion for the 2008 Olympics, is one of the largest in the world. Capital Airport is the main hub for Air China and Hainan Airlines. The Airport Expressway and Second Airport Expressway, connects to Capital Airport from the northeast and east of the city center, respectively. Driving time from city center is about 40 minutes under normal traffic conditions. The Capital Airport Express line of Beijing Subway and the Capital Airport Bus serves the Capital Airport.

====Beijing Daxing International Airport====

Beijing Daxing International Airport (IATA: PKX) located south of the city in Daxing District bordering the city of Langfang, Hebei Province, opened on September 25, 2019. The Daxing Airport has one of the world&#x27;s largest terminal buildings and is expected to be a major airport serving Beijing, Tianjin and northern Hebei Province. Daxing Airport is connected to the city via the Beijing–Xiong&#x27;an intercity railway, the Daxing Airport Express line of the Beijing Subway and two expressways.

====Other airports====
With the opening of the Daxing Airport in September 2019, the Beijing Nanyuan Airport (IATA: NAY), located south of city center in Fengtai District, has been closed to civilian airline service. Other airports in the city at Liangxiang, Xijiao, Shahe and Badaling are primarily for military use.

====Visa requirements for air passengers====
, tourists from 45 countries are permitted a 72-hour visa-free stay in Beijing. The 45 countries include Singapore, Japan, the United States, Canada, all EU and EEA countries (except Norway and Liechtenstein), Switzerland, Brazil, Argentina and Australia. The programme benefits transit and business travellers with the 72 hours calculated starting from the moment visitors receive their transit stay permits rather than the time of their plane&#x27;s arrival. Foreign visitors are not permitted to leave Beijing for other Chinese cities during the 72 hours.

===Trains===
====Stations====

Beijing has four main railway stations: Beijing railway station, Beijing North railway station, Beijing West railway station, Beijing South railway station. The latter two are among the biggest railway stations in the world. Beijing Chaoyang railway station is a station for high-speed trains from the northeast. Other railway stations in urban Beijing include: Beijing East, Beijing Fengtai, Guang&#x27;anmen, Changping North. The Hepingli railway station is no longer in service.

Several more stations are under construction. Beijing Fengtai railway station will be a very large station in southwest Beijing with both high-speed and conventional services calling at it. Beijing Sub-Center railway station is situated in Tongzhou District and will be both a terminus and an intermediate station on multiple intercity lines.

====Railways====
Beijing is a major railway hub in China&#x27;s railway network. The following eight major railways radiate out of Beijing:

* Jingguang Railway, to Guangzhou, Guangdong
* Jinghu Railway, to Shanghai
* Jingha Railway (includes Jingqin Railway), to Harbin, Heilongjiang
* Jingbao Railway, to Baotou, Inner Mongolia
* Jingtong Railway, to Tongliao, Inner Mongolia
* Jingyuan Railway, to Yuanping, Shanxi
* Jingcheng Railway, to Chengde, Hebei
* Jingjiu Railway, to Shenzhen, Guangdong (&quot;Jiu&quot; refers to Kowloon, in Hong Kong across the border). 

The city also hosts a number of high speed railway lines:

* Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway, to Tianjin
* Beijing-Shanghai High Speed Railway, to Shanghai
* Jingguang High-speed Railway, to Shijiazhuang, Wuhan and Guangzhou, opening late 2012.

Further high speed connections being proposed include links to Shenyang, Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Kowloon, Taipei, and Taiyuan.

====International trains departing from Beijing====

The main media agency in the province is the &quot;Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu Daily Newspaper&quot;.

Determining tourism as one of the pillars of local socio-economic development, in early 2017, Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province decided to re-establish the Tourism Department. By the end of the year, the Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu Provincial Party Committee had issued a resolution on developing high-quality tourism, which aimed to develop the tourism infrastructure and improve the quality of tourism products and services in the direction of modernity and difference, while ensuring a safe, civilized and friendly tourist environment.

With the efforts of the provincial tourism industry and local authorities, the image of Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu tourism has created a positive impression for visitors. Many other visitors to Vũng Tàu at this time have also been impressed by the changes in the destination. Vũng Tàu tourism is very much regaining its prestige and class.

==Infrastructure==
BRVT serves as a major trade gateway for Vietnam due to its proximity to industrial zones, port complex, major highways, and transshipment routes. Infrastructure investments in the province have not only increased connectivity within the province but also with neighboring economic hubs such as Ho Chi Minh City and Đồng Nai province.

In addition, the new Long Thành International Airport which is under construction is only around 30 minutes from the port complex and 50 km from the province.

===Highways===
The province has access to major national highways such as National Highway 51 and National Highway 1. In addition, expressways such as Ho Chi Minh City – Long Thành – Dầu Giây Expressway, Biên Hòa - Vũng Tàu expressway, and Bến Lức - Long Thành highway (to open in 2020) further increase connectivity with the surrounding provinces.

<doc id="925638" wikidata="Q415037" url="?curid=925638" title="Forsterite">
<text>Forsterite (Mg2SiO4; commonly abbreviated as Fo; also known as white olivine) is the magnesium-rich end-member of the olivine solid solution series. It is isomorphous with the iron-rich end-member, fayalite. Forsterite crystallizes in the orthorhombic system (space group &quot;Pbnm&quot;) with cell parameters &quot;a&quot; 4.75 Å (0.475 nm), &quot;b&quot; 10.20 Å (1.020 nm) and &quot;c&quot; 5.98 Å (0.598 nm).

Forsterite is associated with igneous and metamorphic rocks and has also been found in meteorites. In 2005 it was also found in cometary dust returned by the Stardust probe. In 2011 it was observed as tiny crystals in the dusty clouds of gas around a forming star.

Two polymorphs of forsterite are known: wadsleyite (also orthorhombic) and ringwoodite (isometric, cubic crystal system). Both are mainly known from meteorites.

Peridot is the gemstone variety of forsterite olivine.

==Composition==

Pure forsterite is composed of magnesium, oxygen and silicon. The chemical formula is Mg2SiO4. Forsterite, fayalite (Fe2SiO4) and tephroite (Mn2SiO4) are the end-members of the olivine solid solution series; other elements such as Ni and Ca substitute for Fe and Mg in olivine, but only in minor proportions in natural occurrences. Other minerals such as monticellite (CaMgSiO4), an uncommon calcium-rich mineral, share the olivine structure, but solid solution between olivine and these other minerals is limited. Monticellite is found in contact metamorphosed dolomites.

==Geologic occurrence==
Forsterite-rich olivine is the most abundant mineral in the mantle above a depth of about ; pyroxenes are also important minerals in this upper part of the mantle. Although pure forsterite does not occur in igneous rocks, dunite often contains olivine with forsterite contents at least as Mg-rich as (92% forsterite – 8% fayalite); common peridotite contains olivine typically at least as Mg-rich as . Due to its high melting point, olivine crystals are the first minerals to precipitate from a magmatic melt in a cumulate process, often with orthopyroxenes. Forsterite-rich olivine is a common crystallization product of mantle-derived magma. Olivine in mafic and ultramafic rocks typically is rich in the forsterite end-member.

Forsterite also occurs in dolomitic marble which results from the metamorphism of high magnesium limestones and dolomites.
Nearly pure forsterite occurs in some metamorphosed serpentinites. Fayalite-rich olivine is much less common. Nearly pure fayalite is a minor constituent in some granite-like rocks, and it is a major constituent of some metamorphic banded iron formations.

==Structure, formation, and physical properties==

Forsterite is mainly composed of the anion SiO44− and the cation Mg2+ in a molar ratio 1:2. Silicon is the central atom in the SiO44− anion. Each oxygen atom is bonded to the silicon by a single covalent bond. The four oxygen atoms have a partial negative charge because of the covalent bond with silicon. Therefore, oxygen atoms need to stay far from each other in order to reduce the repulsive force between them. The best geometry to reduce the repulsion is a tetrahedral shape. The cations occupy two different octahedral sites which are M1 and M2 and form ionic bonds with the silicate anions. M1 and M2 are slightly different. M2 site is larger and more regular than M1 as shown in Fig. 1. The packing in forsterite structure is dense. The space group of this structure is Pbnm and the point group is 2/m 2/m 2/m which is an orthorhombic crystal structure. 
This structure of forsterite can form a complete solid solution by replacing the magnesium with iron. Iron can form two different cations which are Fe2+ and Fe3+. The iron(II) ion has the same charge as magnesium ion and it has a very similar ionic radius to magnesium. Consequently, Fe2+ can replace the magnesium ion in the olivine structure.

One of the important factors that can increase the portion of forsterite in the olivine solid solution is the ratio of iron(II) ions to iron(III) ions in the magma. As the iron(II) ions oxidize and become iron(III) ions, iron(III) ions cannot form olivine because of their 3+ charge. The occurrence of forsterite due to the oxidation of iron was observed in the Stromboli volcano in Italy. As the volcano fractured, gases and volatiles escaped from the magma chamber. The crystallization temperature of the magma increased as the gases escaped. Because iron(II) ions were oxidized in the Stromboli magma, little iron(II) was available to form Fe-rich olivine (fayalite). Hence, the crystallizing olivine was Mg-rich, and igneous rocks rich in forsterite were formed.
At high pressure, forsterite undergoes a phase transition into wadsleyite; under the conditions prevailing in the Earth&#x27;s upper mantle, this transformation would occur at pressures of ca. 14–15 GPa. In high-pressure experiments, the transformation may be delayed so that forsterite can remain metastable at pressures up to almost 50 GPa (see fig.).

The progressive metamorphism between dolomite and quartz react to form forsterite, calcite and carbon dioxide:

&lt;chem&gt; 2CaMg(CO3)2 + SiO2 -&gt; Mg2SiO4 + 2CaCO3 + 2CO2&lt;/chem&gt;

Forsterite reacts with quartz to form the orthopyroxene mineral enstatite in the following reaction:

&lt;chem&gt;Mg2SiO4 + SiO2 -&gt; 2MgSiO3&lt;/chem&gt;

==Discovery and name==

Forsterite was first described in 1824 for an occurrence at Mount Somma, Vesuvius, Italy. It was named by Armand Lévy in 1824 after the English naturalist and mineral collector Adolarius Jacob Forster.

==Applications==
Forsterite is being currently studied as a potential biomaterial for implants owing to its superior mechanical properties.

<text>National Geographic (formerly National Geographic Channel; abbreviated and trademarked as Nat Geo or Nat Geo TV) is an American pay television network and flagship channel owned by the National Geographic Global Networks unit of Disney Entertainment and National Geographic Partners, a joint venture between the Walt Disney Company (73%) and the National Geographic Society (27%), with the operational management handled by Disney Entertainment.

The flagship channel airs non-fiction television programs produced by National Geographic and other production companies. Like History (which is 50% owned by Disney through A&amp;E Networks) and Discovery Channel, the channel features documentaries with factual content involving nature, science, culture, and history, plus some reality and pseudo-scientific entertainment programming. Its primary sister network worldwide, including the United States, is Nat Geo Wild, which focuses on animal-related programs. 

, Nat Geo is available to approximately 70,000,000 pay television households in the United States- down from its 2016 peak of 91,000,000 households.

==History==
In the United States, under leadership of its president Tim T. Kelly, the National Geographic Channel launched on January 7, 2001, as a joint venture of National Geographic Television &amp; Film and Fox Cable Networks. National Geographic provides programming expertise and the Fox Networks Group provides its expertise on distribution, marketing, and advertising sales.
&quot;The &#x27;90s: The Last Great Decade&quot;, a documentary series narrated by Rob Lowe, pulled in 1.10 million viewers, and was the second highest-rated July telecast in the National Geographic Channel rating history. &quot;The 2000s: A New Reality&quot;, also narrated by Lowe, premiered on July 12, 2015.

On November 14, 2016, National Geographic Channel was renamed as simply National Geographic, dropping the &quot;Channel&quot; from its name.

On December 14, 2017, in a deal, the Walt Disney Company announced it would buy the majority of 21st Century Fox. Disney would assume control of Fox&#x27;s controlling stake in the National Geographic partnership thereafter. Following the acquisition, National Geographic and its sister channels were folded into Walt Disney Television, with the president of the National Geographic Partners reporting directly to the Walt Disney Television chairman. Disney officially closed the deal on March 20, 2019, having then added Nat Geo into its portfolio of networks.

On September 15, 2023, Byron Allen made a $10B bid to buy ABC, FX &amp; National Geographic as Bob Iger claimed it &#x27;may not be core&#x27; to Disney. On November 29, 2023, Iger announced he was no longer interested in selling Disney&#x27;s linear TV assets, effectively rejecting Bryon Allen&#x27;s offer.

==Theme fanfare music==
The National Geographic Channel&#x27;s signature theme fanfare music, which is played at the beginning of many of the channel&#x27;s television programs, was composed by Elmer Bernstein. It was originally written in 1964 for the Society&#x27;s television specials, which were broadcast on CBS, ABC, PBS and NBC from 1964 until the early 2000s.

==Other National Geographic US channels==
===National Geographic HD===
The United States 720p high definition simulcast of the National Geographic Channel launched in January 2006. It is available on all major cable and satellite providers.

===Nat Geo Wild===

Nat Geo Wild (stylized as Nat Geo WILD or abbreviated as NGW) is a cable/satellite TV channel focused on animal-related programs. It is a sister network to National Geographic Channel and it is the latest channel to be jointly launched by the National Geographic Society and Fox Cable Networks. It was launched in United States on March 29, 2010, focusing primarily on wildlife and natural history programming.

===Nat Geo Mundo===

Nat Geo Mundo is broadcast in American Spanish, and was launched in 2011. It shares programming with the Nat Geo Channel available in Hispanic American countries. The channel is fully-owned by the National Geographic Society with no involvement from Disney General Entertainment Content.

===Nat Geo TV===
Nat Geo TV is an application for smartphones and tablet computers, along with Windows 10. It allows subscribers of participating pay television providers (such as Spectrum and Comcast Xfinity) numerous viewing options, including individual episodes of National Geographic and Nat Geo Wild&#x27;s original series and documentaries (which are made available live). On August 24, 2024, it was announced that the Nat Geo TV app would shut down on September 23 along with all other Disney-owned TV Everywhere apps, such as DisneyNOW, Freeform, FXNow and ABC. However, viewers can still watch episodes on the Nat Geo website even after said date.

==Controversy and criticism==
Archaeologists have protested that National Geographic shows such as &quot;Diggers&quot; and &quot;Nazi War Diggers&quot; promote the looting and destruction of archaeological sites by promoting the work of metal detecting souvenir hunters and collectable dealers. In 2013 the National Geographic Channel set off a firestorm of controversy with its reality show &quot;Diggers&quot;. Professional archaeologists from the Society for Historical Archaeology, the largest scholarly group concerned with the archaeology of the modern world (A.D. 1400–present), roundly criticized the network for promoting the theft of cultural materials on public and private land.

The show &quot;Nazi War Diggers&quot; was accused of showing unscientific and disrespectful handling of human remains. A promotional quote from a military relic dealer, &quot;I feel that by selling things that are Nazi-related and for lots of money, I am preserving things that museums don&#x27;t want to deal with,&quot; was removed from the channel&#x27;s website in March 2014. National Geographic expressed regret for how the series was presented by its own website but maintained that many of the accusations against the series were based on misinformation. The show was repackaged, amid controversy, as &quot;Battlefield Recovery&quot; for air during 2016 on Channel 5 in the UK.

<doc id="925640" wikidata="Q814186" url="?curid=925640" title="Command-line completion">
<text>Command-line completion (also tab completion) is a common feature of command-line interpreters, in which the program automatically fills in partially typed commands.

Command line interpreters are programs that allow a user to interact with the underlying operating system by typing commands at a command prompt using a command line interface (CLI), in contrast to pointing and clicking a mouse in a graphical user interface (GUI). Command-line completion allows the user to type the first few characters of a command, program, or filename, and press a completion key (normally ) to fill in the rest of the item. The user then presses or to run the command or open the file.

Command-line completion is useful in several ways, as illustrated by the animation accompanying this article. Commonly accessed commands, especially ones with long names, require fewer keystrokes to reach. Commands with long or difficult to spell filenames can be entered by typing the first few characters and pressing a completion key, which completes the command or filename. In the case of multiple possible completions, some command-line interpreters, especially Unix shells, will list all possible completions beginning with those few characters. The user can type more characters and press again to see a new, narrowed-down list if the typed characters are still ambiguous, or else complete the command/filename with a trailing space. An alternate form of completion rotates through all matching results when the input is ambiguous.

Completable elements may include commands, arguments, file names and other entities, depending on the specific interpreter and its configuration. Command-line completion generally only works in interactive mode. That is, it cannot be invoked to complete partially typed commands in scripts or batch files, even if the completion is unambiguous. The name tab completion comes from the fact that command-line completion is often invoked by pressing the tab key.

==History==
Tab completion showed up early in computing history; one of the first examples appeared in the Berkeley Timesharing System for the SDS 940, where if a typed string were ambiguous, the interpreter would do nothing, but if the string was &quot;not&quot; ambiguous, it would automatically complete it without any command from the user. This feature did not work well with the all too frequent typos, and so was a mixed blessing. This feature was imitated by Tenex&#x27;s developers who made an important change: Tenex used &quot;escape recognition&quot;, in which the interpreter would not attempt to autocomplete unless the escape key was struck (thus the name) by the user. The domain was also expanded from only program names on the Berkeley system to both program names and files on Tenex. The Tenex descendant TOPS-20 moved command line completion from command interpreter to the operating system via the COMND JSYS system call, to make it available to other user applications. From there it was borrowed by Unix.

==Example==
To open the file with Firefox one would type:

 firefox introduction-to-command-line-completion.html

This is a long command to type. Instead we can use command-line completion.

===Prompting completion===
The following example shows how command-line completion works in Bash. Other command line shells may perform slightly differently.

First we type the first three letters of our command:

 fir

Then we press and because the only command in our system that starts with &quot;fir&quot; is &quot;firefox&quot;, it will be completed to:

 firefox

Then we start typing the file name:

 firefox i

But this time is not the only file in the current directory that starts with &quot;i&quot;. The directory also contains files and . The system can&#x27;t decide which of these filenames we wanted to type, but it does know that the file must begin with &quot;introduction-to-&quot;, so the command will be completed to:

 firefox introduction-to-

Now we type &quot;c&quot;:

 firefox introduction-to-c

After pressing it will be completed to the whole filename:

 firefox introduction-to-command-line-completion.html

In short we typed:

 firic

This is just eight keystrokes, which is considerably less than 52 keystrokes we would have needed to type without using command-line completion.

===Rotating completion===
The following example shows how command-line completion works with rotating completion, such as Windows&#x27;s CMD uses.

We follow the same procedure as for prompting completion until we have:

 firefox i

We press once, with the result:

 firefox introduction-to-bash.html

We press again, getting:

 firefox introduction-to-command-line-completion.html

In short we typed:

 firi

This is just seven keystrokes, comparable to prompting-style completion. This works best if we know what possibilities the interpreter will rotate through.

==Completion in different command line interfaces==
*Unix shells, including Bash (the default shell in most Linux distributions) and ksh among many others, have a long-standing tradition of advanced and customizable completion capabilities.
** Bash programmable completion, codice_1 and codice_2 commands have been available since the beta version of 2.04 in 2000 and offers at least Pathname and filename completion.
** For KornShell users, file name completion depends on the value of the EDITOR variable. If EDITOR is set to vi, you type part of the name, and then . If EDITOR is set to Emacs, you type part of the name, and then .
** The Z shell (zsh) pioneered the support for fully programmable completion, allowing users to have the shell automatically complete the parameters of various commands unrelated to the shell itself, which is accomplished by priming the shell with definitions of all known switches as well as appropriate parameter types. This allows the user to e.g. type and have the shell complete only tarred gzip archives from the actual filesystem, skipping files which are incompatible with the input parameters. A modern zsh installation comes with completion definitions for over five hundred commands.
** Tcsh offers default file, command, and variable name completion activated using . The &#x27;complete&#x27; builtin command provides fully programmable completion. The source code comes with a &#x27;complete.tcsh&#x27; file containing many examples of its completion syntax.
*Windows PowerShell, the extensible command shell from Microsoft, which is based on object-oriented programming and the Microsoft .NET framework, provides powerful and customizable completion capabilities similar to those of traditional Unix shells.
*The command processor of Windows NT-based systems supports basic completion. It is possible to use a separate key-binding for matching directory names only.
* enables file and directory name completion characters (^F and ^D by default). Use for more information.
*TweakUI can be used to configure the keys used for file name and directory name completion.
*The MS-DOS command processor did not have command-line completion: pressing the tab key would just advance the cursor. However, various enhanced shells for MS-DOS, such as 4DOS, the FreeDOS version of , or the Enhanced DOSKEY.COM feature Unix-style tab completion.
*Far Manager apart from its file management functions provides command history and line completion for Windows.

<text>Nicktoons is an American pay television channel owned by the Paramount Media Networks division of Paramount Global through the Nickelodeon Group. The channel is geared towards children aged 7 to 11. 

, Nicktoons is available to approximately 43,000,000 pay television households in the United States-down from its 2013 peak of 69,000,000 households.

== History ==
Nicktoons was launched as a standalone channel on May 1, 2002, as Nicktoons TV, part of the digital cable-exclusive MTV Digital Suite, in order to entice cable operators to pick up the network and give them a marketing advantage over satellite services. However, by early 2004, Nickelodeon management changed course and offered it to digital satellite services DirecTV and Dish Network. The network was originally marketed as commercial-free, with comedic promos involving Nickelodeon Animation Studios, two-minute cartoon shorts from foreign markets, and former program promotions that had previously been used on Nickelodeon taking up commercial time. By September 23, 2005, as the network&#x27;s distribution increased, it began to carry regular advertising.

On September 28, 2009, the network&#x27;s logo changed as part of Nickelodeon&#x27;s universal rebranding effort. A high-definition feed was launched on August 13, 2013, and is available on several providers. Like Viacom&#x27;s other HD channels, any programming produced in 4:3 SD is pillarboxed on this feed. As the network blended in more Nickelodeon programming into its schedule, the Nicktoons website was sunset to a parking page directing viewers to Nick.com before it was eventually redirected quietly to the latter website.

== Programming ==
Since its inception, Nicktoons has mainly aired programs carried over from the main Nickelodeon channel, with some occasional airing of Nickelodeon&#x27;s live-action programming depending on Viacom&#x27;s programming direction at the time.

Beginning in the mid-2000s, many older shows such as &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; and &quot;CatDog&quot;, were removed from the schedule as more acquired programming and Nicktoons Network originals were premiering, many were cancelled by the early-2010s, with some having different reasons, for example, &quot;Fantastic Four: World&#x27;s Greatest Heroes&quot;, &quot;Iron Man: Armored Adventures&quot;, and &quot;Wolverine and the X-Men&quot; were effectively cancelled when The Walt Disney Company acquired Marvel Studios in 2009.

Starting in the summer of 2024, the network&#x27;s entire schedule is exclusively episodes of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; and &quot;The Patrick Star Show&quot;, promoted as &quot;Non-Stop SpongeBob&quot;. The episodes air in a random and unthemed order.

Since 2006, Nickelodeon has used Nicktoons to burn-off the remaining episodes of under-performing shows. Including shows both acquired and initially created for the Nickelodeon channel. Some first run shows include &quot;As Told By Ginger&quot;, &quot;Back at the Barnyard&quot;, &quot;Breadwinners&quot;, &quot;Bunsen Is a Beast&quot;, &quot;Harvey Beaks&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s Pony&quot;, &quot;The Mighty B!&quot;, &quot;Pig Goat Banana Cricket&quot;, &quot;Planet Sheen&quot;, &quot;Robot and Monster&quot;, &quot;T.U.F.F. Puppy&quot;, &quot;Welcome to the Wayne&quot;, and season 10 of &quot;The Fairly OddParents&quot;. Some acquired shows that were moved over and finished their runs on the network include &quot;Alvinnn!!! and the Chipmunks&quot;, &quot;Ollie&#x27;s Pack&quot; and &quot;Rabbids Invasion&quot; (though the series moved to Netflix for its fourth and final season).

=== NickSports ===
On September 3, 2014, a two-hour Wednesday prime time programming block named NickSports was launched on the channel, tying into the Kids&#x27; Choice Sports inaugurated that year. The block presented mainly licensed programming focusing on sports, including the Rob Dyrdek-starring &quot;Wild Grinders&quot; and &quot;NFL Rush Zone: Guardians of the Core&quot;, along with sports-related feature films such as &quot;Bend It Like Beckham&quot;, &quot;Cool Runnings&quot;, and &quot;Space Jam&quot;. Sometime in 2015, the block was moved to a Friday prime time slot. The block ended in September 2018.

== Mascot ==
From 2006 until 2009, Nicktoons Network used a robot mascot in bumpers and advertisements for the channel. The mascot, named &quot;ACOW,&quot; which stands for Animation Capital of the World, was a complex robot character with a large singular eye, animated using &quot;photo-puppetry.&quot; ACOW was prominently featured on the NicktoonsNetwork.com website and was used as part of the &quot;Nicktoons Network: Animation Capital of the World&quot; logo. Several similar-looking eyeball-based characters were seen in promos for the network.

<doc id="925651" wikidata="Q65122132" url="?curid=925651" title="H2 (American TV channel)">
<text>H2 (formerly History International) was an American specialty television channel that was owned by A+E Networks (a joint venture between the Hearst Corporation and the Disney–ABC Television Group), available on multi-channel television providers.

Launching in 1998 as History International, a spin-off of the History Channel focused on international history, it re-launched as H2 in September 2011, primarily carrying reruns of documentary programming previously seen on its parent network from the mid-2000s onward, original historical and popular science documentaries, and pseudoscientific entertainment programs. The channel ceased operations on February 29, 2016 and was subsequently replaced by Viceland.

==History==
The network launched on November 16, 1998 as History Channel International (abbreviated as &quot;HI&quot; or variations on &quot;H-INT&quot;). It originally focused mainly on programs and specials focusing on world history. History International occasionally featured shows in languages other than English, such as French or Spanish for use with the National Cable &amp; Telecommunications Association&#x27;s Cable in the Classroom initiative. By 2010, this was reduced to an hour-long Spanish language program on weekday mornings titled (the English translation of &quot;The History Channel&quot;).

On September 26, 2011, the network was rebranded as H2, with its programming being refocused to feature documentary content from sister network History prior to that network&#x27;s shift towards more reality programming, along with original programs (such as the special &quot;The Universe: Beyond the Big Bang&quot; and the first-run series &quot;America&#x27;s Book of Secrets&quot;), as well as exclusive new episodes of the former History series &quot;The Universe&quot;, &quot;Ancient Aliens&quot; and &quot;Modern Marvels&quot;, in addition to international-focused programming. H2 did not have plans to add reality series as its sister channel has done. Newer documentaries more recently seen on History migrated to the network as part of the rebrand, which would rotate with the documentaries from History International that primarily span from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s.

In August 2014, A&amp;E Networks acquired a 10% stake in Vice Media, and on November 3, 2015, A&amp;E announced that H2 would be &quot;replaced&quot; by Viceland, a new lifestyle-focused network programmed by Vice Media. H2 signed off on February 29, 2016 at 6:00 a.m. ET, being replaced by pre-launch programming for Viceland.

==Availability==
, H2 was available to 70.1 million households in the United States.

<text>Asad ad-Dīn Shīrkūh bin Shādhī (; ), also known as Shirkuh, or Şêrko (meaning &quot;lion of the mountains&quot; in Kurdish) (died 23 March 1169) was a Kurdish Mercenary commander in service of the Zengid dynasty, then the Fatimid Caliphate and uncle of Saladin. His military and diplomatic efforts in Egypt were a key factor in establishing the Ayyubid dynasty in that country.

==Name==
The pronunciation and the meaning of Shirkuh is not quite clear: it could mean “the mountain lion” or possibly Shirguh (Sher-gue) in Kurdish “having the lion’s ear&quot;. 

His Arabic honorific &quot;Asad ad-Din&quot; similarly means &quot;the lion of faith&quot;. In Latin, his name was rendered as &quot;Siraconus&quot;; William of Tyre, referring to the expedition of 1163, describes him as:

an able and energetic warrior, eager for glory and of wide experience in military affairs. Generous far beyond the resources of his patrimony, Shirkuh was beloved by his followers because of this munificence. He was small of stature, very stout and fat and already advanced in years. Though of lowly origin, he had become rich and risen by merit from his humble estate to the rank of prince. He was afflicted with cataract in one eye. He was a man of great endurance under hardships, one who bore hunger and thirst with an equanimity quite unusual for that time of life.

==Origins and earlier career==
He was originally from a Kurdish village in Armenia near the town of Dvin. He was the son of Shadhi ibn Marwan, a Kurdish chief, and the brother of Najm ad-Din Ayyub, the ancestor of the Ayyubid dynasty. The family was closely connected to the Shaddadid dynasty, and when the last Shaddadid was deposed in Dvin in 1130, Shahdi moved the family first to Baghdad and then to Tikrit, where he was appointed governor by the regional administrator Bihruz. Ayyub succeeded his father as governor of Tikrit when Shahdi died soon after. When Shirkuh killed a man who was a Christian in some versions of the story, and with whom he was quarrelling in Tikrit in 1138, alternatively, Shirkuh might have killed that man due to insulting or sexual assault on a young woman, the brothers were exiled (Shirkuh&#x27;s nephew Yusuf, later known as Saladin, was supposedly born the night they left). They joined Nur ad-Din Zengi&#x27;s army, and Shirkuh served under Nur ad-Din Zengi who succeeded Zengi in Mosul. Shirkuh was later given Homs, ar-Rahba and other appanages by Nur ad Din Zengi as his vassal. Ayyub served as governor of Baalbek and later Damascus, and the two brothers negotiated the surrender of Damascus to Nur ad-Din in 1154.

In 1163 Nur ad-Din was asked by Shawar to intervene in Egypt in a dispute between him and Dirgham over the Fatimid vizierate. Nur ad-Din sent Shirkuh, and this was to be the first of three ventures Shirkuh made into Egypt, nominally on Nur ad-Din&#x27;s behalf. On this first occasion, his nephew Saladin accompanied him as an advisor. Shawar was restored and Dirgham was killed, but after quarrelling with Shirkuh, Shawar allied with Amalric I of Jerusalem, who marched into Egypt in 1164 and besieged Shirkuh at Bilbeis (see Crusader invasion of Egypt). In response Nur ad-Din attacked the Crusader states and almost captured the Principality of Antioch.

==Later career==
Shirkuh was invited back into Egypt by the Fatimid Caliph Al-Adid in 1167, to help defeat the Crusaders who were attacking Cairo. Shawar once again allied with Amalric, who besieged Shirkuh in Alexandria until he agreed to leave; however, a Crusader garrison remained in Egypt and Amalric allied with the Byzantine Empire, planning to conquer it entirely. To destroy the garrison, Shawar switched alliances, from Amalric to Shirkuh. The Muslims fought a pitched battle with the Crusaders, who did not have the resources to conquer Egypt and were forced to retreat.

Shirkuh and his associates enjoyed widespread support among the civil elite In Egypt for religious reasons. Although the Fatimid rulers were Shiite, the majority of people remained Sunni Muslims. In January 1169 Shirkuh entered Cairo and had the untrustworthy Shawar executed. When he reached Cairo with his armies he was welcomed by the Fatimid Caliph Al-Adid and treated with great honour. He accepted the office of vizier, but died two months later on 22 March; as Baha ad-Din ibn Shaddad describes, &quot;it was the case that Asad ad-Din was a great eater, excessively given to partaking of rich meats. He suffered many bouts of indigestion and from quinsy, from which he would recover after putting up with great discomfort. He was taken severely ill, afflicted with a serious quinsy, which killed him on 22 Jumada II 564 [23 March 1169].&quot;

==Legacy==
He was succeeded as vizier by his nephew Saladin, who had served with him on his campaigns in Egypt. Saladin eventually succeeded Nur ad-Din as well, uniting Egypt and Syria, which enabled him to almost completely drive out the crusaders from Syria and Palestine. A number of historians have offered the view that Shirkuh&#x27;s death was an important factor in allowing Saladin to consolidate his position as Sultan and as undisputed head of the Ayyubid family.

Although Nur ad-Din Zengi took back the domain of Homs on Shirkuh&#x27;s death, in 1179 Saladin gave Homs to Shirkuh&#x27;s son Muhammad ibn Shirkuh and his descendants continued to rule in Homs thereafter until the death in 1263 of his last descendant the emir, Al-Ashraf Musa, Emir of Homs. After this Homs was ruled directly as part of the Mamluk Empire.

<doc id="925661" wikidata="Q21194" url="?curid=925661" title="Vũng Tàu">
<text>Vũng Tàu (&quot;Hanoi accent:&quot; , &quot;Saigon accent:&quot; ) is the largest city of Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province in southern Vietnam. It is the province&#x27;s economic, financial and cultural centre, and a popular tourist hub in southern Vietnam. The city area is , consists of 16 urban wards and one commune of Long Sơn Island. Vũng Tàu was the capital of the province until it was replaced by the much smaller Bà Rịa city on 2 May 2012. The city is also the crude oil extraction center of Vietnam.

==Administrative divisions==
Since April 2015, Vũng Tàu consists of 16 wards (phường): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, Thắng Nhất, Thắng Nhì (formerly Ward 6), Thắng Tam, Nguyễn An Ninh, Rạch Dừa, and the commune (xã) of Long Sơn.

The wards are divided into quarters (khu phố), which are divided into smaller groups (tổ dân phố). The commune is divided into hamlets (thôn).

==History==


According to archeological excavations in 2002 and 2005 in Giồng Lớn, a coastal sandbank in Long Sơn island, humans have existed about 2000 BCE. Evidence of burial sites, working tools, clay pots, jewelleries, weapons and other tools suggested close connections with Óc Eo Culture and trade activities with nearby countries.

Between 1st and 7th centuries, Vung Tau was ruled by Funan, who were replaced by the Chenla Kingdom. Little is known of Vũng Tàu during the Funan and Chenla period.

In 1295, Zhou Daguan (), a Yuan Chinese diplomat serving under Temur Khan, passed by Vũng Tàu on his official voyage to Angkor, Chenla. In his book &quot;The Customs of Cambodia&quot; (, literally &quot;Chenla Culture and Land Report&quot;) referred to Vũng Tàu as Zhenpu 真蒲, which he described as the border of Chenla.自溫州開洋，行丁未針。歷閩、廣海外諸州港口，過七洲洋，經交趾洋到占城。又自占城順風可半月到真蒲，乃其境也。

Since departing from Wenzhou, it has not done anything yet. It traveled through the ports of Fujian and Guangzhou, crossed the Qizhou Sea, and reached Champa via the Jiaozhi Sea. Moreover, if the wind blows from Champa, you can reach Zhenpu in half a month, which is its territory.During 14th and 15th centuries, the cape that would become Vũng Tàu was a swamp which European trading ships visited regularly. The ships&#x27; activities inspired the name Vũng Tàu, which means &quot;&quot;. The Portuguese referred to this place as &quot;Oporto Cinco Chagas&quot; or simply &quot;Cinco Chagas&quot; in their maps. Apres de Mannevillette (1707–1780), one of the greatest French chart-publishers, mentioned Saint Jacques in his book &quot;La Neptune Oriental&quot;. This term was later adopted by Europeans and the French.

The French Indochinese government later named it Cap Saint-Jacques (&quot;Cap Xanh Giac&quot;, in Vietnamese). The cliff of Vũng Tàu is now called Mũi Nghinh Phong (literally meaning &quot;Cape of breeze welcome&quot; or &quot;Cape of greeting the wind&quot;).

=== Vietnamese settlement ===
During the 16th and 17th century, conflicts caused by the opposing clans in the Trịnh–Nguyễn War led to emigrations of Vietnamese people from Thuận Quảng to the coastal area near Vũng Tàu.

Vũng Tàu was originally referred to as Tam Thắng (&quot;Three Boats&quot;) in memory of the first three villages in this area: Thắng Nhất, Thắng Nhị, Thắng Tam, within the province of Biên Hòa under the Nguyễn dynasty. Under the reign of king Gia Long (1761–1820), when Malay pirates built a base here and subsequently became a danger to traders in Gia Định city, the king sent 3 army detachments to crack down on the pirates. The pirates were defeated and the troops were given the land as an incentive to continue to protect the area. The villages, then named Thắng Nhất 勝一, Thắng Nhì 勝二, Thắng Tam 勝三 occupied arable areas at the southern tip and along the western shore of the peninsula.

The kings Gia Long, Minh Mạng and Thiệu Trị invested heavily into Vũng Tàu&#x27;s protection, by opening various defensive facilities. A military barrack, Phước Thắng bảo 福勝堡, on the hill slope overlooking the Buffalo Cape, then called was built in 1839. The barrack was operated as a fortress and armed with 6 bronze cannons

=== French colonisation ===
10 February 1859 marked the first use of cannons by Nguyễn&#x27;s army, when they fired at French battleships from the fortress of Phước Thắng, located 100m from Vũng Tàu&#x27;s Front Beach. This marked an important period in Vietnam&#x27;s war against French invaders in southern Vietnam (then called Cochinchina).

In 1876, according to a decree by the French government, Vũng Tàu was merged in Bà Rịa county per Saigon&#x27;s administration. During the 1880s there were talks about moving Saigon&#x27;s port facilities to Vũng Tàu, but this came to nothing due to Saigon&#x27;s better infrastructure.

On 1 May 1895, the governor of Cochinchina established by decree that Cap Saint Jacques would thereafter be an autonomous town. In 1898, Cap Saint Jacques was merged with Bà Rịa county once again, but re-divided in 1899. In 1901, the population of Vũng Tàu was 5,690, of which 2,000 persons were immigrants from northern Vietnam. Most of the town&#x27;s population made their living in the fishing, farming and service industries. On 4 April 1905, Cap Saint Jacques was made an administrative district of Bà Rịa province. In 1929, Cap Saint Jacques became a province, and in 1934 became a city (commune).

Between 1885 and 1934 period, the French designed the town centre along the Front Beach, then named &quot;Baie de Cocotiers&quot;, along with several notable architectural works for the administrative function such as &quot;l&#x27;Hôtel de l&#x27;Inpsection&quot;, the Post Office, Grand Hotel and the Lighthouse. In 1898, the French governor of Indochina, Paul Doumer (who later became president of France), built the &quot;Villa Blanche&quot; in Vũng Tàu that is still a prominent landmark.

A national route was paved in 1896 (then called Colonial route 15), as well as a jetty in the Front Beach to connect Cap with Saigon.

In the First Indochina War Vũng Tàu&#x27;s military hospital facility was used by French soldiers on sick leave.

On 21 July 1952 Viet Minh fighters disguising themselves in French military uniforms and armed with machetes, grenades, and Sten submachine guns snuck into the building&#x27;s R&amp;R centre, where a number of unarmed French officers were having dinner with their families. The rebels threw a grenade from the kitchen killing the Vietnamese bartender, then shot the cook Nguyen Van Loc who was trying to play dead. Attackers stationed in the hallway found the four children of Air Vietnam President Jean Perrin-Christian, Elysabeth, Michel, and Nicole- who were playing a game of hide-and-seek. Elysabeth, Christian and Nicole were gunned down by the Viet Minh, and Michel who tried to run away was hacked to death with machetes. Now that the coast was clear they entered the dining room where the French customers were attacked with gunfire and grenade attacks. Twenty people including four Vietnamese civilians were killed in the attack, and 23 were injured. The only people to survive unharmed were a boy who hid behind a chair and a lieutenant who covered himself in a dead woman&#x27;s blood to make it appear he was dead.

=== South Vietnam ===

After the Geneva Agreement was signed, the State of Vietnam and Republic of Vietnam resettled 1 million people from the North to southern Vietnam, including more than 800,000 Catholic Christians. Three temporary resettlement camps were established in Vung Tau. The local government placed these new residents at key locations along Route 15 such as Ben Da, Thang Nhi, Thang Nhat, Rach Dua, Phuoc Thang and Phuoc Thanh, forming many religious Catholic parishes throughout the region.

With a strategic location right at the sea route close to the capital city of Saigon, the government of the Republic of Vietnam and its allies in the United States, Australia, and South Korea consolidated and developed Vung Tau into a strategic defense spot. After taking over French military facilities here, the Army of the Republic of Vietnam established many large training facilities such as the Training Center for Rural Construction Officers, the Communications School, and the Military Police School, Cade School and Military Hospital.

During the Vietnam War, the 1st Australian Logistics Support Group was based in Vũng Tàu – as were various United States military units at different times. Vũng Tàu also became popular for R&amp;R, among in-country US, Australian and New Zealand personnel.

Due to its rising significance as a military base and coastal beach resort, Vung Tau attracted a large number of residents during the war time. Its population rose from 29,390 in 1955 to a whopping 119,300 in 1973.

=== The fall of Vũng Tàu ===
In the last days of April 1975, many South Vietnamese troops retreated to Vũng Tàu as the communists closed on southern Vietnam. After the capture of Bà Rịa and Phước Tuy province on 27 April, the 3rd NVA Division forces began their attacks on Vũng Tàu. However, the Cỏ May bridge had been destroyed, and strong defense from ARVN Airborne at the south end of the bridge proved fatal to the northern forces. The Division&#x27;s 12th Regiment was then landed by fishing boats behind the Airborne lines and this, together with a renewed attack by the 2nd Regiment, forced the Airborne to retreat into Vũng Tàu. At 01:30 on 30 April the Division began its attack on Vũng Tàu forcing the Airborne into the city center where they eventually succumbed at 11:00.:chapter 6 

A fierce armed hostage crisis took place between the ARVN officers and the communists at Palace Hotel ended with the final surrender at 13:30.

=== Reunified Vietnam ===
After the reunification of Vietnam, Vũng Tàu was administered as a city under the Republic of Southern Vietnam. Potilically, it is governed by the Military Administration Committee of Vũng Tàu City, led by Phạm Văn Hy (Tư Hy), Chairman, who is also the secretary of the Communist Party Committee of the City. In January 1976, a major adjustment of administrative boundary in southern Vietnam saw the merger of Vũng Tàu and three nearby provinces into Đồng Nai. Vũng Tàu then became a district-level town (thị xã) of this new province. 

After the war, due to Vietnam being put under debilitating trade embargoes by the United States and failing economy, Vũng Tàu was a common launching place for the &quot;Vietnamese boat people&quot; – refugees escaping the post-war Communist regime. The government-led nationalisation of private entreprises, collectivisation of the economy, central planning and money changes carried out in the post-war years brought in hardships for the majority of people.

=== Special zone ===
After oil was discovered in southern Vietnamese waters, the Vietnamese government pushed for the exploitation and extraction of this new resource. On 30 May 1979, Vũng Tàu was merged with Côn Đảo Islands to form Vũng Tàu-Côn Đảo Special Zone in a bid to facilitate the new service and logistics hub for the oil industry. Between 1980 and 1982, the city saw drastic changes in infrastructure and demographically was transformed into a service and logistics hub for the new industry. Politically, the Special zone was given the same status as provinces and centrally-run cities. Administratively, it was divided into 1 district (Côn Đảo) and 5 wards: Châu Thành, Thắng Nhất, Thắng Nhì, Thắng Tam, Phước Thắng and Long Sơn commune.

The central government assigned nearly 10,000 officers and professional engineers from many non-business units, industries, construction and the military. A seaport logistics service area serving the import and export of technical materials and petroleum products was established in a swamp area along the shore of Ganh Rai Bay.

After the signing of Soviet-Vietnam agreement on oil exploitation and establishment of Vietsovpetro, the city welcomed more than 2,000 Soviet officials and experts to work in the joint venture. To create comfortable accommodation for the new workers, in 1985 the special zone government and the General Department of Petroleum built a separate dormitory for these people, often called the &quot;5-storey area&quot;. Currently, this apartment complex still has more than 520 households with about 1,000 Russians living and working.

=== Provincial city ===
On 12 August 1991, the Special Zone was dissolved by a governmental decree. Bà Rịa–Vũng Tàu province was officially created from this former zone and nearby districts of Đồng Nai Province. Vũng Tàu once again was re-established as a &quot;thành phố&quot; (city).

Success from Đổi Mới and profits from seafood and petroleum exports brought a large budget source to Ba Ria-Vung Tau province, creating positive changes to repel the socio-economic crisis. The production value of economic sectors across the city only reached 271 billion VND at the time of establishment, by 2021, it reached 70,500 billion VND (260 times than the origin).

The tourism and industrial production sectors began to thrive. In 1996, the city inaugurated Dong Xuyen Industrial Park.

In the late 1990s and 2000s, the city carried out a spectacular transformation with the construction and improvement of inner city roads, and the expansion of many key projects such as Le Hong Phong Road, Martyrs Memorial and Nga Nam roundabout. Ba Thang Hai Road (National Highway 51C) was also built and inaugurated during this period, replacing 30 Thang 4 (National Highway 51A) as the main road leading into the centre. As of 2023, 100% of roads and alleys were paved and solidified. The openings of Gò Găng and Cửa Lấp bridges helped connect Vũng Tàu with nearby districts faster.

Numerous commercial and urban developmental projects were established during the 2000s such as Vung Tau City Commercial Centre, Chi Linh Urban Area, Dai An Urban Area and A Chau Urban Area.

In 2012, the provincial administrative centre moved to Bà Rịa.

==Economy and tourism==

===Shipping and oil exploration===
The city is located in the south of Vietnam, situated at the tip of a small peninsula. It has traditionally been a significant port, particularly during Vietnam&#x27;s period of French rule. Today, the city&#x27;s importance as a shipping port has diminished, but it still plays a significant role in Vietnam&#x27;s offshore oil industry. Vũng Tàu is the only petroleum base of Vietnam where crude oil and natural gas exploitation activities dominate the city&#x27;s economy and contribute principal income to Vietnam&#x27;s budget and export volume. Vũng Tàu shipyard&#x27;s reconstruction was scheduled to be completed in 2008, supplied with up-to-date anchor handling supply vessels of Aker.

===Industry===
PEB Steel operates several factories in Vũng Tàu.

===Beaches===
Vũng Tàu has 4 extensive beaches, including Back Beach (Bãi Sau), Front Beach (Bãi Trước), Strawberry Beach (Bãi Dâu), Pineapple Beach (Bãi Dứa).

===Resorts and theme parks===
A big resort project has just been licensed by the Vietnamese government, the Saigon Atlantis. Upon completion, this entertainment project worth US$300 million in capital investment will include resorts, shopping and sailing. The investor of this project is proposing to raise the investment capital to US$4 billion. Two other noteworthy entertainment projects awaiting licensing are Vũng Tàu Aquarium, which will cost US$250 million, and Bàu Trũng, a Disneyland-like entertainment park which will cost US$250 million. The project includes Landmark Tower, an 88-story skyscraper proposed to be built and completed by 2010 in Vũng Tàu by a USA-based company, Good Choice Import – Export Investment Inc, once built will likely be the highest building in Vietnam. The project is under consideration for approval by the local provincial government.

==Culture==
Vũng Tàu boasts a rich and diverse culture thanks to its unique location and history of foreign influences and domestic immigration.

===Local traditions and festivals===
As a coastal city, Vũng Tàu&#x27;s culture is deeply rooted in its connection to the sea and maritime heritage. Descendents of the original Tam Thắng villages in Vũng Tàu usually celebrate temple feasts, which are hosted once a year. A sizeable number of fishermen, particully those living near Thắng Tam village temple also celebrate holidays related to fishing and the sea, with Lễ hội Cá Ông (Whale Festival) or Lễ hội Nghinh Ông (Whale Celebration Festival) being most prominent. Other festivals in the region include the Kite Festival and World Food Festival Culture. 

Sea Festivals are vibrant modern festival activities including a wide range of activities such as beach sports competition, seafood fairs, music concerts and cultural exhibitions. Contrary to traditional feasts, this festival is usually held in summer months and aims to promote tourism and foster community spirit.

Australian tourists come to Vũng Tàu in August to mark the anniversary of the Battle of Long Tân.

===Religion===


As in most provinces and cities in Vietnam, Buddhism is the predominant religion. Mahayana Buddhism, the dominant form of the religion in Vietnam, was brought to Bà Rịa-Vũng Tàu by the Vietnamese settlers from the north at the beginning of the 17th century during the expansion of the Nguyễn lords. When they came bringing their original religion they built many Buddhist pagodas, temples and statues in the city. Three Buddhist temples in particular, Thích Ca Phật Đài, Phổ Đà Sơn Quan Âm Bồ Tát Tự Temple, and Niết Bàn Tịnh Xá temple, draw pilgrims from around the country.

Before the area was settled by ethnic Vietnamese, the Khmer people practiced Theravada Buddhism. The area has some 14 Catholic wards with active services. A notable monument in the city is the Christ of Vũng Tàu, a large statue built by Vietnam&#x27;s Catholic minority. It was completed in 1974, with the height of 32 metres and two outstretched arms spanning 18.4 metres. It is among the tallest statues of Christ in Asia.

There has been a Russian village in Vũng Tàu ever since the Soviet era; these Russians generally worked for the Russian-Vietnamese joint venture Vietsovpetro. It is believed that these &quot;Russians&quot;, or &quot;citizens of the former Soviet Union&quot;, were once the most dominant group of foreigners in Vũng Tàu. Some have remained in Vũng Tàu after the dissolution of the Soviet Union. They formed a parish of the Russian Orthodox Church. 

One of the Vietnamese whale worship sites, the Lăng Ông Nam Hải Whale Temple, hosts a skeleton of a whale, being respected in the name of &quot;Nam Hai General&quot;, a whale god. Nam Hai General is said to govern the ocean and protect people from evils, monsters, and disasters, and an annual festival is held in recognition.

===Cuisine===

Vũng Tàu&#x27;s local culinary scene presents a strong emphasis on fresh seafood and local flavours.

Bánh xèo Vũng Tàu are pancakes famous for its taste which cannot be found in anywhere. Ingredients include rice flour, shrimp, pork, bean sprouts but it tastes is more significant thanks to the crust made from fresh chicken eggs, and the filling full of onions and mushrooms.

Snails and sea snails: are street food dishes comprising various snails that are often steamed or grilled and served with a variety of dipping sauces. 

=== Art and music ===

==Climate==
==Transport==
From Hồ Chí Minh City, it takes about two hours to reach Vũng Tàu by road (51A Expressway), and two and a half hours by high speed ferry, or one and a half hours by car on the freeway.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

*Ganja, Azerbaijan
*Ha Long, Vietnam
*Padang, Indonesia
*Parramatta, Australia

<doc id="925666" wikidata="Q3503559" url="?curid=925666" title="Sultanate of Serdang">
<text>The Sultanate of Serdang () was an early modern Malay-Indonesian monarchy, Serdang was founded in 1723 and joined the Republic of Indonesia in 1946. The Sultanate separated from the Sultanate of Deli after a dispute over the royal throne in 1720. Like other kingdoms on the east coast of Sumatra, Serdang prospered due to the opening of tobacco, rubber and oil palm plantations.

==History==
===Establishment of the Sultanate of Deli===
According to history, an Laksamana from Sultan Iskandar Muda Aceh named Sri Paduka Gocah Pahlawan, have a title Laksamana Khoja Bintan, married to the younger brother of Raja Urung (state) Sunggal, a Karo Tribal area that already converted to Islam. Then, by the 4 Kings of the Urung Karo tribe who were already Muslim, this Laksamana was appointed king in Deli in 1630. With that event, the Kingdom of Deli was officially established, and the Laksamana became the first Deli King. In the coronation process of the Deli King, King Urung Sunggal was in charge as Ulun Jandi, namely to say obedience from the Big Men and people to the king. Then, the Datuk Empat Institution was formed, and Raja Urung Sunggal was a member of the Datuk Empat Institution.

===Crisis===
In its development, in 1723 there was chaos when Tuanku Panglima Paderap, the 3rd Raja Deli died. This crisis happened because the eldest son of the King who was supposed to replace him had a defect in his eyes, so he could not become king. Son number 2, Tuanku Pasutan who was very ambitious to become king then took over the throne and expelled his younger brother, Tuanku Umar with his mother, Permaisuri Tuanku Puan Sampali, to Serdang region.

According to Malay custom, Tuanku Umar was supposed to replace his father as the Deli King, because he was the son of garaha (permaisuri), while Tuanku Pasutan was only a concubine. However, because he was still a minor, Tuanku Umar was finally eliminated from the Deli. To prevent civil war from happening, the 2 Great Men of Deli, namely Raja Urung Sunggal and Raja Urung Senembal, together with an East Urung Batak King in the upstream Serdang region (Tanjong Merawa), and an official from Aceh (Lumu Kejeruan), then rationing Tuanku Umar as the first Serdang King in 1723. Since then, the Serdang Kingdom has been established as a fraction of the Deli Kingdom.

<text>Dunhill Records was started in 1964 by Lou Adler, Jay Lasker, Pierre Cossette and Bobby Roberts as Dunhill Productions to release the music of Johnny Rivers on Imperial Records. It became a record label the following year and was distributed by ABC Records.

The first Dunhill single was &quot;My Prayer/Pretty Please&quot; (catalog #D-4001) by Shelley Fabares, who was married to Adler at the time. In the summer of 1967 Adler sold his shares to ABC Records, creating ABC-Dunhill Records, after which he started yet another label Ode Records (which was first distributed by CBS and later by A&amp;M Records). Until 1975, ABC continued to release records on the Dunhill label, after which all remaining artists were absorbed into the ABC Records roster before MCA Records bought the label outright in 1979.

Buluu Dunhill Records was an offshoot of the ABC/Dunhill days using catalog series #B-73001 (45 RPM singles) and #B-60001 (LP).

Today, the Dunhill catalog is managed by Geffen Records.

A later independent reissue label called Dunhill Compact Classics was formed in 1986 to reissue recordings on the new CD format. British American Tobacco, a UK tobacco company, sued the company because of the use of the &quot;Dunhill&quot; name, forcing the company to rename itself DCC Compact Classics.

== Dunhill label variations ==
*1965–1968—Black label with DUNHILL in white outline letters inside yellow frame
*1968—Same as above, but with the &quot;abc&quot; logo added in front of the DUNHILL logo
*1968–1969—Black label with 3-compartment multi-color box consisting of smaller DUNHILL logo (now in white letters inside white frame) in the left hand box and the white circular &quot;abc&quot; logo and &quot;RECORDS&quot; in the right hand boxes
*1969–1973—Same as above, but with the multicolor &quot;DUNHILL&quot; and &quot;abc RECORDS&quot; boxes separated
*1973–1974—Black label with DUNHILL spelled out in children&#x27;s blocks (followed by a block with the &quot;abc&quot; logo) in white box (This variation only lasted a few months before the label was changed back to the multi-color box logo in which both the &quot;one box&quot; and &quot;two box&quot; variations were used)
*1974–1975—Yellow, orange, red and purple label with &quot;abc Dunhill&quot; (&quot;abc&quot; circle logo in black) in between two black lines
*White labels were used for most promotional issues.

<doc id="925673" wikidata="Q5066504" url="?curid=925673" title="Chadstone Shopping Centre">
<text>Chadstone Shopping Centre (colloquially known as Chaddy) is a shopping centre located in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of Malvern East. Chadstone Shopping Centre is the largest indoor shopping centre in Australia by both floor area and number of stores, as well claims to be the largest in the Southern Hemisphere. The centre opened on 3 October 1960 and was the first self-contained regional shopping centre in Melbourne.

The centre contains 129,924m2 of shop floor space, about 530 stores and more than 9300 free car parking spaces. It has as many as 68,000 visitors on its busiest trading days and attracts about 400,000 tourists a year from interstate and 200,000 from overseas. Sales at the centre exceed $1.4 billion—the highest turnover of all Australian shopping centres—and it has more than 20 million visitors annually.

The centre, also known colloquially as &quot;Chaddy&quot;, includes anchor stores such as the Myer and David Jones department stores, H&amp;M, Zara and Uniqlo (opened late 2016 as part of a renovation), Coles, Woolworths and Aldi supermarkets, as well as Kmart and Target discount department stores, JB Hi-Fi, and more than 500 specialty stores, of which the majority are fashion-related, including numerous high-end labels like Dior, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Tiffany &amp; Co and more. Also located in the centre is an Apple Store and Legoland Discovery Centre with a Lego Store and Hoyts. There are two food courts, two office towers located at the southern side of the centre and a newly built hotel. 
The centre&#x27;s owners had sought a further expansion to include a 250-room hotel and 15,000m2 of offices (including its owner Vicinity Centres Head Office), to take total floor space to 221,217m2, including 156,924m2 of shop floor space. Construction of the $130 million building started in early 2018 and opened to the public in late 2019.

==History==


===Origins===

Opened in October 1960 at a cost of £6 million, Chadstone Shopping Centre was the first self-contained regional shopping centre in Melbourne, and the largest built in Australia to that time. The centre was built and owned by the Myer Emporium, and marked the transformation of shopping in Australia from the traditional central city and strip-shopping precincts to the now familiar mall-type shopping centre.

The site of the current shopping centre was once extensive paddocks of the Convent of the Good Shepherd on which cattle grazed until the mid-1950s. The initial of land was sold to Myer in March 1958.

The development of Chadstone was driven by Ken Myer, who in 1949 looked to the US for the lead in retail developments, with decentralised centres fuelled by expanding suburban growth and car reliance. Further development of the concept occurred after Myer&#x27;s 1953 visit to the US, where he met with a number of architects involved with the design of shopping malls, and in 1954 Myer secured of land in Burwood for a shopping centre. The Burwood site was ultimately not used for the project.

In 1958 the American firm of Welton Becket and Associates was appointed as the design architect, with Tompkins and Shaw Architects as the production architect. During the project the senior board of Myer was unhappy with the process, concerned that the architects did not understand the &quot;Australian Concept&quot;, and were blindly adopting the American shopping mall model.

In 1960 the Myer board wrote:

:&quot;Although based in a broad way on the pattern of shopping centres in the United States, Chadstone has been individually designed to suit local needs and its own location.&quot;

The original shopping centre consisted of a single open-air mall with Myer at the southern end and a Dickins New World supermarket at the northern end; following the US pattern of shopping malls.

===Early years===
The first major change was made to the centre in the 1970s or 1980s: the mall was roofed over with translucent fibreglass, an acknowledgement that the open mall did not suit the Melbourne climate. During the same period a bowling alley and auditorium were opened, and the Dickens store was altered to be more easily accessed from the mall.

In the early 1980s, the Myer Emporium sold the shopping centre to the Gandel Group, which has since managed and developed the complex. 

In 1984 the centre had its first major expansion: in 1985 now Coles New World was relocated into a new mall and a Target Discount Department Store was relocated from downstairs to a new store where Coles used to be, and in 1986 a Hoyts 8 Cinema Complex was opened. A major extension doubled the lettable area in the late 1980s, and during the same era the Convent of the Good Shepherd was demolished to extend the carpark of the complex. 

===Redevelopments===

Chadstone has reclaimed the title &quot;Southern hemisphere&#x27;s largest shopping centre&quot; since 2009 and also &quot;Australia&#x27;s largest shopping centre&quot; since 2007, thanks to regular development. Westfield Knox (Knox City Shopping Centre at the time) held the latter title from November 2002 until 2007 after the completion of their own expansion works. Chadstone initially held both of these titles from its original opening day to 2002 and was quickly inspired to take back the records. Chadstone&#x27;s main local rivals are Westfield Doncaster to the north, Westfield Knox to the east and Westfield Southland to the south.

====Pre–2007====
Throughout the 1990s, Chadstone had undergone numerous developments. These include the development of multi-storey carparks due to the boundaries of the centre being built-up with no further room to expand. Approximately 20% of the original mall structure is left intact with this number to be reduced due to the construction of the West Mall.

By 1999 Chadstone&#x27;s lettable area covered 126,000m2, after the extension of the Myer and David Jones stores. Part of stages 20 and 21, this expansion cost $150 million and took two and a half years to complete. Probuild was responsible for every major stage of expansion and redevelopment at Chadstone Shopping Centre, commencing at stage 5 in 1989, with stage 33 (West Mall) having been completed in 2009.

====2007–2009====
In December 2007 a A$100 million upgrade saw the centre&#x27;s owners extend Chadstone&#x27;s lettable area to 171,217 m2, with the centre reclaiming the title as the largest shopping centre in Australia. 

The new extension, dubbed &quot;Chadstone Place&quot;, featured a Woolworths Supermarket (the first Woolworth supermarket in Victoria to have the new branding and relocated), First Choice Liquor, Aldi and a Dick Smith Electronics Concept Store along with an airport-style waiting area bus interchange, two new health clubs (Contours and Fitness First Platinum) and a crèche. On 29 October 2007 the first section of the redevelopment was open. Named &quot;The Loop Mall&quot;, it featured 44 new stores including a redesigned Jetty Surf and new entrances opposite Kmart and Toys &#x27;R&#x27; Us.

The major redevelopment, commencing in early 2007, impacted on almost a quarter of the centre, (the oldest section of the centre, from Sportsgirl to Mrs. Field&#x27;s/Borders, being closed), from 31 May 2008, until November 2009.

The development also included redesigning the roads leading into Chadstone to allow for better traffic flow into the centre. As part of the development an independent community group launched and maintained a website to keep track of construction developments. The State Government refused to impose a condition sought by the Stonnington Council calling for a transport study by the Government and Gandel, including the possible construction of a rail link.

On 22 August 2009, 50 new stores, including Sportsgirl, Portmans, Esprit, Witchery, were opened. In November, a golden strip of luxury retailers were officially opened. Twelve international fashion houses now have stores at Chadstone including Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, Chanel, Miu Miu, Tiffany &amp; Co., Ralph Lauren, Hugo Boss, Omega, Burberry, Coach and Jimmy Choo. The expansion provided a total of 530 stores.
====2011–present====


On 20 August 2011, managing director of Colonial First State Global Asset Management, Darren Steinberg, announced a proposal to expand Chadstone&#x27;s floor area to 221,217m², to enable a redevelopment of the oldest part of the property to the north and construct two buildings of up to 14 storeys on its southern boundary facing Princes Highway. Up to 60,000 m2 of floor area would be revamped and an extra 27,000 m2 added to the centre. The proposal includes refurbishments of the cinemas and food precincts. An extra 1400 car-parking spaces are proposed for the centre, taking total car spaces to 10,708. The project, scheduled to be completed in late 2015 at a cost of A$520 million, will be the biggest non-retail extension in the centre&#x27;s history. The redevelopment plans were supported by an independent planning panel in July 2012 and approved by the City of Stonnington on 14 August 2012. On 10 November 2012, the centre&#x27;s redevelopment plans were given the final approval from the State Government.

The CFS Retail and Gandel Group boards gave the go-ahead for part of the works in May 2014, which would add 34,000 square metres to a total of 212,000 sq m. The west mall would be &quot;revitalised&quot; with an expanded luxury section, while work at the northern end would create a new retail and leisure precinct accommodating a Hoyts digital cinema complex, up to five international flagship stores in 11,000 sq m of space, 40 new retailers and a 1300-seat, 26-tenant food gallery. The northern expansion, including a new Target store on the lower ground floor, would be accommodated within a four-level glass-roofed atrium. The expansion would also include a 17,000 sq m 10-level office tower, new bus interchange and an additional 800 car park spaces, taking total car spaces to 10,090. The new northern extension would create &quot;racecourse&quot; style malls running around the centre on both the Ground and Lower Ground floors. Demolition began in June 2014 and construction in September 2014, with staged openings through to completion on 13 October 2016.

This extension opened in October 2016, and was marketed as &quot;The New Chadstone&quot;. The renovated section includes many global brands such as H&amp;M, Sephora, Uniqlo, and many others

Legoland Discovery Centre indoor theme park was later announced to open as part of the new development. This is the first Lego themed attraction for Merlin Entertainments in the Southern Hemisphere. It opened on 18 April 2017.

Construction on the 250-room M Gallery by Sofitel hotel began in May 2018 with completion in late 2019.

==Revenue and profit==
Chadstone Shopping Centre was the first shopping centre in Australia to have its total worth valued at more than A$1 billion. Chadstone Shopping Centre&#x27;s net income was $970 million in 2004. Its annual profit in (2004) was A$79.03 million, with its entirety of stores gaining an income of A$119.23 million. In 2004, Chadstone Shopping Centre had an Annual Traffic Movement of 16.7 million moving through the centre.

In 2007, the annual turnover was A$1 billion, making it the shopping centre in Australia with the highest annual turnover and the first to have an annual turnover of A$1 billion.

In 2010, Chadstone had a 20% increase in the moving annual turnover (MAT), making A$1.28 billion in sales that year.

The centre reported an annual turnover for 2013 of $1.4 billion, an increase of 3 percent on the previous year, making it the shopping centre with the highest turnover in Australia. The next biggest was Westfield Bondi Junction, with $1 billion turnover. As of 2013, the centre&#x27;s value exceeds A$3 billion.

==Transport==
Chadstone Shopping Centre was designed as a car-based centre when this was the norm and remains highly dependent on cars for customer access. The centre has more than 9300 car parking spaces and the proportion of staff and customers arriving by car continues to grow: between 2002 and 2011 the share of customers arriving by bus fell sharply from 17% to 12%, while the proportion of those walking or cycling fell from 5% to 3%. Planners now acknowledge it would be a major challenge to reverse the trend.

Recent studies show that the centre contributes to &quot;significant traffic issues&quot; in the area, with traffic on nearby major arterial networks heavily congested and intersections &quot;close to saturated at peak times&quot;. A planning panel report said problems also arose from overflow parking in nearby streets at peak times such as Christmas and major sales. The panel concluded that the ability to further expand floor space would be limited unless road capacity was enhanced through major arterial roadworks and a substantial shift in the mode of transport for visitors and staff.

Traffic congestion also impacts on the 14 bus routes that service the shopping centre, including two higher frequency SmartBus routes (Routes 900 and 903). Buses often take 15 minutes to travel to or from Holmesglen, 1.8 km away. The Public Transport Users Association (PTUA), which is campaigning for improved public transport in and around the centre, says buses are slow, often travelling less than in the area and are often overcrowded. Services for many bus routes are infrequent after hours and on weekends.

The nearest railway stations are at Hughesdale and Oakleigh on the Cranbourne/Pakenham lines and Holmesglen and East Malvern on the Glen Waverley line. Hughesdale station is about 20 minutes&#x27; walk from the shopping centre; Holmesglen is about 30 minutes. The Public Transport Users Association (PTUA) and Town and Country Planning Authority (TCPA) support an extension of the Alamein railway line to Oakleigh railway station via Chadstone for either Tram or Train services and the RACV has also asked the state government to consider providing an underground rail link. Stonnington Council has proposed a Municipal Strategic Statement and Local Planning Policy in which it would seek a fixed rail link to Chadstone Shopping Centre. State government transport authority Public Transport Victoria also views a rail link to Chadstone as desirable, but says the cost of building one would be &quot;prohibitive&quot;.

==Tenants==
Chadstone Shopping Centre has 211,929m² of floor space, comprising 550 stores over four levels serviced by over 10,000 car spaces. The major retailers, which are located at either end of the centre, include David Jones, Myer, H&amp;M, Sephora, Uniqlo, Zara, Muji, Apple, Target, Kmart, Cotton On, Woolworths, Coles, Aldi, Rebel Sport, JB Hi-Fi, Strike Bowling Bar, Legoland Discovery Centre and Hoyts Cinema.

<doc id="925675" wikidata="Q5656824" url="?curid=925675" title="Harehills">
<text>Harehills is an inner-city area of east Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It is about northeast of Leeds city centre. Harehills is between the A58 (towards Wetherby) and the A64 (towards York). It sits in the Gipton &amp; Harehills ward of Leeds City Council and the Leeds East parliamentary constituency, between Burmantofts and Gipton, and adjacent to Chapeltown.

Its boundaries are defined by the city council as &quot;the boundary of Spencer Place to the West, Harehills Avenue to the North, the boundary of Foundry Place to the East and Compton Road and Stanley Road to the South.&quot; As the name suggests, it is a hill area, basically a south-facing slope, with many streets of terraced houses on hills. In the middle is Banstead Park, a grassy slope with trees and play areas, giving a view over the city of Leeds.

There are two main shopping streets, Harehills Lane and Harehills Road which join at the junction of Roundhay Road (A58 road) leading to Oakwood. Also, heading up Harehills Lane towards the A64 York Road at the junction with Compton Road, is Harehills&#x27;s other main shopping area. Harehills provides many shops such as casinos, corner shops and fast food. You may also find jewellery and barber shops. St James&#x27; University Hospital is situated in Harehills. Since the 1890s, cheap housing has made it attractive to immigrants, with the result that it has a considerable cultural and ethnic mixture.

On the August Bank Holiday the Leeds Carnival is held with a procession through Harehills and Chapeltown.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Harehills&quot; is first attested in 1576, as &quot;Hayr Hylls&quot;. Scholars agree that the second element of the name &quot;Harehills&quot; is the topographic term &#x27;hill&#x27;. There has been some debate about the first element, however. Eilert Ekwall, in his influential &quot;Concise Oxford Dictionary of English Place Names&quot;, thought that the name came from the Old English word &quot;hār&quot; (&#x27;grey&#x27;). However, the subsequent research by A. H. Smith for the English Place-Name Society concluded that, as the modern spelling would suggest, the name does originate from &quot;hare&quot;, and thus originally meant &#x27;hill characterised by the presence of hares&#x27;.

==History==
===19th century===
In the early 19th century, the area covered by Harehills existed as woods between Leeds and the village of Chapel Allerton. Leeds had developed in the west, north and south but not much to the east. The area began to be developed from the 1820s, when people sought to escape the overcrowding in the centre of Leeds, wide streets and detached houses were envisaged in a plan titled &#x27;New Leeds&#x27;. However, it was closely packed back-to-back housing for workers that came to be built in the 1890s. Expansion happened very rapidly. Harehills was on the route of the Leeds Tramway to Roundhay and Chapeltown opened from 1891. Transport links contributed to the growth of the area.

In 1891, Harehills Board School opened on Roundhay Road, designed by Charles Barker Howdill (1863–1940). In 1897, the Gipton Board School was opened on Harehills Road, designed by Walter Samuel Braithwaite (1854–1922). Braithwaite used features found in many of the Leeds Board Schools built at this time, in a Renaissance Revival style. It later became known as Gipton Council School, and in the 1950s, Harehills County Secondary School. It became Harehills Middle in the 1970s and closed in 1992 later being redeveloped as a business centre that encourages start-ups and social enterprises. In the 1890s, St Aidans Anglican church was built on Roundhay Road in a Romanesque style with mosaics by Frank Brangwyn; it was designed by Robert James Johnson of Newcastle.

===20th century===
Irish Catholics who settled in the area received a parish church in 1905; Scottish Presbyterians also settled here early on. Following rapid growth around the turn of the century, two churches were built on Harehills Road close to each other: a temporary Catholic church and Congregationalist church built by Tom Dyer in 1900–1901. The Sunday School of the Congregationalist Church is now the Bilal Mosque, constructed in 1999 to designs by Atba Al-Samarraie. The Baptist community planned a chapel on Harehills Lane designed by the London firm James Cubitt &amp; Manchip in 1906–1907, finally built after World War I; the hall is notable for its use of light and its Italian Romanesque design. On Harehills Avenue, Trinity Presbyterian Church was built in 1906 by W H Beevers in a Gothic style and a Primitive Methodist Chapel by Dinsley was also built on the Avenue.

By the time that the 1906 Ordnance Survey map was produced, Harehills was an established community. At this time Harehills was home to a purpose-built reservoir sited between Harehills Lane and Harehills Recreation Ground, shown on the 1906 map as owned by the Leeds Corporation Water Works. The 1906 map also shows two clothing factories on Hudson Road along with a shoe works and a brick works between Hudson Road and Harehills Lane as well as an iron works on York Road. Harehills and the surrounding area also had significant mining infrastructure.

Sydney Kitson designed the Church of England parish church of St Wilfrid in an Arts and Crafts style in 1913, but its construction did not begin until 1927. Jewish refugees from Russia and Poland formed a community around Spencer Place in the 1920s. The Third Church of Christ Scientist on Easterly Road was designed by Davidson, Son &amp; Sherwood in 1927; it became the home of the Pentecostal New Testament Church of God in 1984 after the group had met in private homes in Leeds since 1959. The Catholic church of St Augustine was designed by Gribbon, Foggit and Brown in 1937 in a more modernist style notable for its open interior structure, replacing the early 20th century temporary church on the site. In 1958–9, Geoffrey Davy designed the Anglican church of St Cyprian with St James on Coldcotes Avenue; it is designed in a Corbusier style around an organ from St James church in the city centre and has typical contemporary stained glass used by Davy in several churches.

After 1921, Montague Burton&#x27;s established the largest textile factory in the world on Hudson Road, where 10,000 people worked, producing 3,000 suits a week; the factory had a large canteen. In the middle of the 20th century, Harehills had three cinemas, a roller rink and dance hall, all have closed since. To the south of Harehills, St James&#x27; Hospital grew out of a workhouse and industrial school particularly in the 1950s and 1960s. Following World War II, Greek Cypriots and Eastern European immigrants settled in Harehills; there has been a Lithuanian supermarket there since the 1970s. In the 1950s, invited workers arrived from the West Indies, particularly Saint Kitts, and in the 1960s, immigrants arrived from Pakistan and Bangladesh. The arrival of many people from the West Indies in the 1950s led to a growth of Pentecostal communities. The Greek community bought a former Methodist church on Harehills Avenue in 1966 and renovated it to make a church and accommodation for social and schooling activities, consecrating the church of The Three Hierarchs in 1985. Since World War II, the manufacturing industry in the area has declined to be replaced by small shops and restaurants reflecting the vibrant ethnic mix of the area. Many pubs have closed because of the change in population with many Muslims in the area; the Clock cinema has become a shop.
In the 1970s and 1980s, the Fforde Grene pub hosted many gigs. In 1984, some terraced houses in the area around the roads &quot;Sandhurst Terrace&quot;, &quot;Dorset Road&quot;, &quot;Dorset Mount&quot; and &quot;Dorset Avenue&quot; appeared in the beginning of rock band Queen&#x27;s music video for &quot;I Want To Break Free&quot;.

The Central Jamia Mosque or Leeds Islamic Centre, Spencer Place was designed by Finn &amp; Downes Associates in 1997–2000, replacing the Chadssidishe Shul synagogue of 1934 whose hall still exists behind the mosque.

===21st century===
In the 2000s, many Eastern European immigrants moved to Harehills, particularly from Poland and the area is also home to refugees from Zimbabwe, Somalia and Iraq as well as asylum seekers. Shah Jalal Mosque in Ellers Road was built in 2003-2004 designed by Atba Al-Samarraie, replacing a late 1970s conversion of two houses into a mosque by the Bangladesh Islamic Society; it is noted for its sensitive engagement with the surrounding Victorian red-brick terraced houses.

Racial tensions have caused problems in the area, contributing to the Harehills riot in 2001. Residents interviewed in 2002 noted their discontent at how the area had deteriorated since the 1970s. One resident described Harehills as &quot;a horrible place to live&quot; and complained about joy riding, rubbish, drug dealing, arson and vermin. The man&#x27;s report went on to say: &quot;Often you will see a group of young children chasing vermin into an overgrown backyard. This is a sight you would expect to see in a third-world country not the modern, vibrant city that Leeds portrays itself to be.&quot; Another resident described it as being a pleasant place until the 1970s, but has since changed &quot;beyond recognition&quot;. However a third interviewed resident was more positive, although critical in her report, and echoing many of the complaints before, she mentions the &quot;pride of the residents in the upkeep of their houses&quot;.

As housing has increasingly been bought to let out much less money has been spent on the upkeep of houses and gardens. A report published in 2008 notes that there was a high level of crime in the area particularly related to drugs and gangs. The Fforde Grene Public House (now closed) was raided by police in 2004 who recovered drugs and guns. A man was shot in 2008, believed to be a case of mistaken identity. Another shooting also occurred in 2008. In 2008, a 14-year-old girl was sexually assaulted and murdered by a serial attacker who lived nearby. In 2019, police and firefighters were pelted with bricks and other missiles on Bonfire Night.

Community groups have combatted youth crime by running cultural and sporting activities. A feature of the community effort is a number of colourful mosaic street signs, made by youths who are residents of Harehills. In 2014–15, it was reported that several voluntary sector agencies operate within the area including Shantona Women&#x27;s&#x27; Centre, Bangladeshi Centre, ECHO centre, Bilal Sports Centre and CATCH Hovingham Hub. Over the past years residents and local agencies have come together and organised community events like the Harehills Festival in 2018.

Since 2008, Shine social enterprise has had a great impact supporting non-violent women ex-offenders to reintegrate into society and take care of their children; providing education and cultural activities for local children; supporting entrepreneurs and artists to develop sustainable local businesses; and in helping the environment by providing green space and working towards improving pedestrian and cycling routes in Harehills.

The area saw more rioting on 18 July 2024, with West Yorkshire Police officers attacked, cars and a First West Yorkshire bus set alight by local residents, substantial vandalism, and anti-police sentiment as a result of local residents upset by a disturbance involving agency workers and children. The rioting began when a crowd of hundreds of people began attacking a marked police car. Footage shared on social media showed individuals using scooters, pushchairs, bikes, and bats to assault the vehicle. The police car was overturned, and fires were lit on the streets of the community.

==Regeneration==

In November 2003, Harehills received £100,000 toward regeneration from Yorkshire Forward. Investment has also included a children&#x27;s centre which opened in March 2006. Improvements to The Compton Centre community hub and library have been made to include a one-stop centre and job shop for Leeds City Council. In 2014–2015, the Harehills Neighbourhood Improvement Plan was put in place addressing issues of health and wellbeing; unemployment and local economy; crime and anti-social behaviour; the local environment; and community activities to encourage community cohesion. Harehills Lane Shopping was allocated £200,000 of funding under the Town and District Centre scheme. Leeds City Council reported investment in the area in 2021.

==Amenities==
Harehills&#x27; amenities are not located within one centre but spread across the area, mainly on Roundhay Road and Harehills Lane; there are many small shops, restaurants and supermarkets, including catering for different immigrant communities. Roundhay Road has been referred to as &#x27;Curry Mile&#x27;. There are several public houses in Harehills, although considerably fewer than there once were. The last Pub remaining in Harehills is the Samuel Smith Old Brewery pub, &quot;The Brown Hare&quot;.

Harehills Conservative Club is a large brick building on Harehills Lane, and Harehills Liberal Club is round the corner on Foundry Approach.

Schools include Bankside Primary School, Co-op Academy Nightingale, Co-op Academy Woodlands, Hovingham Primary School, Harehills Primary School and St Augustine&#x27;s Catholic Primary School. There are no secondary schools actually in Harehills.

==Transport==

Harehills is between the A58 and the A64. Harehills is well-placed for access to Leeds city centre and Wetherby. Buses run through Harehills to Leeds city centre, Oakwood, Roundhay, Gipton, Seacroft and Wetherby.

Harehills was served by the Leeds Tramway. In 1949 Tetley&#x27;s Coaches, a local coach operator, was founded in Harehills. However, since then the coach operator has moved its offices to Hunslet.

Harehills was on a proposed route of the Leeds Supertram before its cancellation. The location of St James&#x27; University Hospital prompted the inclusion of Harehills in the Trolleybus project however the Trolleybus plans were cancelled in May 2016 because it was claimed that they would have provided little value for money.

== Demographics ==
Part of the Gipton and Harehills ward, in 2015 this ward had the highest levels of unemployment in Leeds. In 2020, it was described as the second most socio-economically deprived area in Leeds; 74.2% of households in the area were deprived in 2021. In 2023, the most frequently reported crimes were violence and sexual offences, public order violations, and incidents of criminal damage and arson. In 2024 West Yorkshire Police reported that crime in the ward had reduced by 40% over the preceding year.

According to the 2021 census for the wider ward, 38.2% of people are Asian, 34.5% are white, 17.4% are Black, with mixed, Arab and other ethnic groups comprising the rest of the community. Within the total population, 23.7% are self-define as English, Welsh, Scottish or Northern Irish, whilst 22.6% are Pakistani or British Pakistani. The community is diverse, with a local resident describing the area as: &quot;Romanian, Gypsy, Pakistani, Asian – this is what it means to be from Harehills&quot;. Leeds&#x27; Roma community is mostly based in the area, although there are also Roma communities living in Beeston and Armley.

==Religion==
The area has at least eight places of worship, indicative of the changing population of the area, with an Anglican church being the oldest and a mosque the most recent. The oldest is St Aidan&#x27;s, the Church of England parish church. The Anglican Church St Wilfrid&#x27;s on Chatsworth Road is part of the Forward in Faith movement. The Roman Catholic parish church is St Augustine&#x27;s, a 1937 brick building on Harehills Road, a little to the north of Banstead Park. On Banstead Terrace, the north side of Banstead Park is the Trinity United Church a 1983 brick building. It combined congregations from a Methodist and two United Reformed Churches in the area. On Harehills Lane is the Baptist Church, a 1928 brick building and the Jamia Masjid Bilal Mosque built in 1996 to serve the local Pakistani community, but now having a much more diverse congregation of recent immigrants. On Easterly Road an old school building is (since 1988) home to the New Testament Church of God, a Pentecostal congregation of mainly African or Afro-Caribbean origin. The only Greek Orthodox Church in Leeds is The Three Hierarchs, in a former Methodist Church (1906 stone building) on Harehills Avenue, which attracts worshippers from all over Yorkshire.

As of the 2021 United Kingdom census, the area&#x27;s religious makeup is 41.9% Muslim, 37% Christian, 17.4% No Religion, with smaller numbers of Hindu and Sikh communities.

<text>Guntars Krasts (born 16 October 1957) is a Latvian politician, former Prime Minister, and former Member of the European Parliament for the single Latvia constituency. Born in Riga, he was the Minister of Economy of Latvia from December 1995 to August 1997, Prime Minister of Latvia from August 1997 to November 1998, and the Deputy Prime Minister from November 1998 to June 1999. Krasts was a member of Saeima, the Latvian parliament, from June 1999 until being elected to the European Parliament in 2004.

==Guntars Krasts in the European institutions==
Guntars Krasts was elected in the 2004 Euroelections as MEP for the single Latvia constituency as a member of For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK. He sits with the Union for a Europe of Nations group (UEN). He left For Fatherland and Freedom/LNNK in February 2008 but joined no other party. As of 31 March 2009, his European Parliament profile shows no national party membership.

On 28 March 2008, Libertas Latvia gave a press conference in which Krasts was named as the head of the Libertas Latvia list. The list would total eight candidates to contend the nine seats assigned to the single Latvia constituency. In the EP elections of 2009, the Libertas.lv list fell short of entering parliament, receiving 4,3% of the vote.

==Later activities==
After the elections, Krasts distanced himself from politics, working in a United Nations and European Union project in Moldova as a government advisor for state reform and EU integration for the Government of Moldova. In 2018, it was announced that he had joined the Latvian Association of Regions.

<text>PYE or Pye Records is an independent British record label. It was first established in 1955 and played a major role in shaping rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll and pop music history. The Pye name was dropped in 1980 due to trademark issues, after which it produced almost no music until the company name and trademark was acquired by the Scottish broadcaster and music producer Tony Currie in September 2024. 

The new Pye Records has begun to release new albums on vinyl: &quot;Race the Sun&quot; from the Tony Currie Orchestra, conducted by Gavin Sutherland (principal guest conductor for the English National Ballet), and Callum Au. &quot;Race the Sun&quot; was conceived to pay tribute to the pop orchestras of the original Pye Records. The revived label has also released &quot;Harvest Gold&quot; by the London-based singer-songwriter Andrea Black. 

Pye Records was best known for artistes such as Lonnie Donegan (1956–1969), Petula Clark (1957–1971), the Searchers (1963–1967), the Kinks (1964–1971), Sandie Shaw (1964–1971), Status Quo (1968–1971) and Brotherhood of Man (1975–1979). The label changed its name to PRT Records (distributing as Precision Records &amp; Tapes) in 1980, before being briefly reactivated as Pye Records in 2006. 

In September 2024, Pye was relaunched by Currie, using a wind-powered pressing plant in Edinburgh to press its vinyl.

==History==
The Pye Company originally manufactured televisions and radios with its main plant situated off what used to be Haig Road, in Cambridge. The company entered the record business when it bought Nixa Records in 1953. In 1955, the company acquired Polygon Records, a label that had been established by Leslie Clark and Alan A. Freeman to control distribution of the recordings of the former&#x27;s daughter, Petula Clark. Pye merged it with Nixa Records to form Pye Nixa Records.

===Pye International===
In 1958, Pye International Records was established. The company licensed recordings from American and other foreign labels for the United Kingdom market, including Chess, Disques Vogue (France), A&amp;M, Kama Sutra, Colpix, Warner Bros., Buddah, Cameo, 20th Century, Casablanca Record and Filmworks and King. It also released recordings from British artist Labi Siffre which were produced outside the company.

===Expansion===
Pye Nixa became Pye Records in 1959, and ATV acquired 50% of the label. ATV bought the other half of the business in 1966.

Under the management of Louis Benjamin, the company entered the budget-priced album market in 1957, reissuing older Pye material on Pye Golden Guinea Records, priced at a guinea (one pound and one shilling). A series of classical recordings was released on Golden Guinea Collector; for example, a version of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Music for the Royal Fireworks&quot; in 1959. This featured the conductor Charles Mackerras who made other recordings on the label, including a Janacek compilation. Golden Guinea Collector was closed in the 1970s and replaced by Marble Arch Records, selling at an even lower price. 

===Piccadilly and Dawn labels===
A full-price subsidiary, Piccadilly Records, was for new pop acts, including Joe Brown &amp; the Bruvvers, Clinton Ford, the Rockin&#x27; Berries, Sounds Orchestral, the Sorrows, The Bystanders, Jackie Trent and, later on, the Ivy League. In 1969, Pye launched a less mainstream label for folk, jazz, blues and progressive acts, Dawn Records. The label artists included Mungo Jerry, Man, Donovan, Comus, Titus Groan and Trifle.

===Quadraphonic releases===
Beginning in 1971, Pye issued a series of &quot;4D Stereo&quot; LP recordings in the UK. These were designed for playback in 4-channel quadraphonic sound. The records were encoded in the QS Regular Matrix system which was licensed from Sansui in Japan. Pye also marketed its own line of consumer electronics used for decoding quadraphonic records. These products were not especially successful. The last LP release in this series was in 1977. 

===As PRT Records===
When the rights to the name Pye (then owned by Philips) expired in 1980, the label changed its name to PRT, which stood for Precision Records and Tapes, via a brief flirtation with Precision. At that time, it had sub-labels such as Fanfare Records, a late 1980s and early 1990s UK-based Hi-NRG label issuing records by Sinitta; R&amp;B Records, a 1980s disco/electro label featuring Imagination; and Splash Records, which featured Jigsaw and the Richard Hewson Orchestra/RAH Band. PRT provided manufacturing and distribution for Gary Numan&#x27;s label Numa Records, founded in 1984, which went on to release two dozen singles by a variety of acts alongside its eponymous founder, including actress Caroline Munro. Postman Pat songs and music, from the television series of the same name, were recorded at PRT Studios.

PRT&#x27;s parent company ACC was purchased by The Bell Group of Australia in 1982. In 1988, the Bell Group was purchased by the Bond Corporation. However, the Bond Corporation was suffering financial problems itself and proceeded to quickly sell off most of its assets. PRT&#x27;s record and cassette factory was sold to another record manufacturer, Meekland. Most of the masters of PRT&#x27;s catalogue (except classical music catalogue) were sold to Castle Communications, which eventually became Sanctuary Records (now a division of BMG Rights Management). Precision Records &amp; Tapes Ltd, formerly Pye Records Ltd, was officially liquidated in December 2013.

At the same time, EMI acquired masters of PRT&#x27;s classical music catalogue and assigned them to EMI Classics.

===Brief revival===
In July 2006, Pye Records was reactivated by Sanctuary Records as an indie and alternative label, featuring artists such as Scottish alternative rock group Idlewild. However, plans for continued usage of the Pye name were abandoned when Universal Music Group bought Sanctuary in 2007. To fulfil conditions imposed by the European Commission following UMG&#x27;s acquisition of EMI in 2012, Universal sold Sanctuary to BMG Rights Management in 2013.

===Previous ownership=== 
Universal Music Group, which owned the label&#x27;s catalogue from 2007 to 2013, controls the catalogue of reissues from Pye/PRT artists&#x27; releases on Sanctuary&#x27;s behalf after BMG assigned UMG to distribute them in October 2023. Previously, it was distributed by Warner Music Group through its Alternative Distribution Alliance division from 2017 to 2023. WMG owns Pye&#x27;s American former distributors Warner Records (formerly Warner Bros. Records) and Reprise Records.

With its acquisition of EMI Classics&#x27; catalogue in 2013, WMG now owns the Pye/PRT classical music catalogue and controls it via Warner Classics.

===ATV Music Publishing===
Pye Records was a sister company to the better-known ATV Music Publishing. This company, which owned the Beatles&#x27; publisher Northern Songs, was bought by Michael Jackson in 1985 and later merged with Sony to form Sony/ATV Music Publishing.

==International divisions==

===Pye in the US===
Starting with the &quot;British Invasion&quot; of 1964, Pye placed their artists in the US mostly on labels that they distributed in the UK: the Kinks to Cameo Records and then to Reprise Records, David Bowie, the Sorrows and Petula Clark to Warner Bros. Records, Donovan to Hickory Records, the Searchers to Mercury Records, Liberty Records, and finally Kapp Records, and Status Quo to Chess Records (which issued their records on their newly created Cadet Concept Records label).

From 1969 to 1971, Pye was a co-owner with GRT (General Recorded Tape) of Janus Records, which at the outset served as the US label for such Pye acts as Jefferson, Sounds Orchestral, Pickettywitch, Mungo Jerry and Status Quo, and also re-issued the early (pre-1966) recordings of Donovan. Pye sold its share of Janus back to GRT in 1971.

In 1972, Bell Records set up a short-lived Pye label, featuring Michel Pagliaro, a Canadian artist whose first English-language album (largely recorded in England) was issued on UK Pye, and Jackie McAuley, whose lone solo album was originally issued on UK Dawn.

In 1974, Pye established an American version of its record label. The label was not a success, however, and closed its US operations in 1976. The head of the US division, Marvin Schlachter, then started Prelude Records, named after one of Pye&#x27;s acts of the time, Prelude; its initial LP and 45 catalogue series were carried over from the ill-fated American Pye label (with the catalogue prefix changed from PYE- to PRL-), and Prelude had a string of disco and dance music hits into the early 1980s.

===Pye in Canada===
Whilst Pye did not have its own operations in Canada, it arranged with Canadian record companies to issue Pye recordings on the Pye label in Canada. Before then, Quality Records issued Pye recordings on the Quality label. Its earliest Pye Canada releases such as Lonnie Donegan&#x27;s &quot;My Old Man&#x27;s A Dustman&quot; were distributed by Astral Music Sales. Around 1963, distribution shifted to Allied Record Corporation. In 1968 distribution shifted to Phonodisc.

<text>Villers Abbey () is a former Cistercian abbey located in the town of Villers-la-Ville, Walloon Brabant, Belgium. Founded in 1146, the abbey was abandoned in 1796. Most of the site has since fallen into ruins. These ruins now belong to the Walloon Region and are classified as part of &quot;Wallonia&#x27;s Major Heritage&quot;.

==History==
In 1146, twelve Cistercian monks and three lay brothers from Clairvaux came to Villers in order to establish the abbey on land granted to them by Gauthier de Marbais. After establishing several preliminary sites (Villers I and Villers II), work was finally undertaken in the 13th century to build the current site. The choir was constructed by 1217, the crypt by 1240, and the refectory by 1267. The church itself took 70 years to build and was completed by the end of the century.

During this period, the abbey reached the height of its fame and importance. Contemporary accounts suggest that roughly 100 monks and 300 lay brothers resided within its walls, although this is possibly an exaggeration. The lands attached to the abbey also expanded considerably, reaching some of woods, fields, and pasturage.

Decline set in during the 16th century, tied to the larger troubles of the Low Countries. Spanish &quot;tercios&quot;, during the campaign of 1544, did considerable damage to the church and cloister, both of which were partially restored in 1587.

In the early 17th century, Crisóstomo Henríquez wrote the history of the abbey.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the abbey&#x27;s fortunes continued to diminish. The number of monks and the abbey&#x27;s wealth dwindled, and it was finally abandoned in 1796 in the wake of the French Revolution.

==After dissolution==

Further degradation to the site occurred in 1855, when the railway line between Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve and Charleroi passed through the old abbatial grounds.

In 1893, the Belgian state purchased the site and launched a conservation effort. Classed as an official historic site in 1973, the abbey has subsequently enjoyed considerable restoration, and the remains of the abbey along with numerous outbuildings can still be seen, including the cloister, refectory, kitchens, dormitories, and brewing house. Since 1992, the site has been maintained by the (APTCV).

The church, although in ruins, is an outstanding example of Cistercian architecture, with imposing vaulting, arches, and rose windows.

The abbey now hosts an annual choir festival &quot;La Nuit des Chœurs&quot; in which a number of choirs sing a variety of music—classical through to gospel, jazz and pop arrangements—from different parts of the grounds over successive nights, culminating in a fireworks display and centre stage concert.

<text>Ode Records (also known as Ode Sounds and Visuals) was an American record label, started by Lou Adler in 1967 after he sold Dunhill Records to ABC Records. It was distributed by CBS&#x27;s Epic Records except between 1970 and 1976, when the label was distributed by A&amp;M Records. The original incarnation was closed in 1978 and CBS took over most of catalog, often with Epic logos replacing Ode logos on reissues. Ode has the distinction of being the first non-CBS label to be distributed by CBS Records.

Adler reactivated the label several times, including another short run with A&amp;M in 1989. It was disbanded when A&amp;M was sold to PolyGram in late 1989.

Ode is now part of Sony Music Entertainment (the successor to CBS), excluding:
* Cheech &amp; Chong catalogue is controlled by Warner Music Group. After Cheech &amp; Chong switched to Warner Bros. Records in 1978, they took also its past catalog to their new home label. Depending on reissue, they can have &quot;Warner Bros. Records Inc.&quot;, &quot;Warner Records Inc.&quot; or &quot;Ode Records&quot; printed as copyright owner. It is believed that Lou Adler still owns copyrights for its Ode releases.
* Soundtrack to &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; and the London Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s version of &quot;Tommy&quot; are still owned by Lou Adler, with reissues distributed under license to third party oldies labels like Rhino, Castle Communications and more recently, The Orchard, another subsidiary of Sony Music.

<text>Roberto Goyeneche (January 29, 1926 in Saavedra, Autonomous City of Buenos Aires – August 27, 1994 in Buenos Aires) was an Argentine tango singer who epitomized the archetype of 1950s Buenos Aires&#x27; bohemian life, and became a living legend in the local music scene.

Despite being of Basque descent, he was known as &quot;El Polaco&quot; (&quot;the Pole&quot;) due to his light hair and thinness, like young Polish people of the time. He is identified with the neighborhood of Saavedra, where he grew up.

== Career ==
Roberto Goyeneche was formed in the style of the tango of Carlos Gardel, later reached a more personal style characterised by his particular way of phrasing with rubato. In 1944, at the age of 18, he joined Raúl Kaplún&#x27;s orchestra after winning a local contest and soon gave his live debut performance on Radio Belgrano. In 1952 Goyeneche teamed up with Horacio Salgán.

In 1956, he became the singer in the orchestra of his dear friend Aníbal Troilo, with whom he recorded 26 songs. Later, Goyeneche became the first singer to record Ástor Piazzolla&#x27;s classic &quot;Balada Para Un Loco&quot;, after starting his solo career in 1963.

During the 1980s, Goyeneche appeared as special guest in the movies &quot;El exilio de Gardel&quot; and &quot;Sur&quot;, both directed by Fernando Solanas.
At the time of his death on 27 August 1994 in Buenos Aires (Aged 68), he was considered the greatest tango singer active. As a tribute, an avenue in the neighborhood of Saavedra, in Buenos Aires, is named after him.

<doc id="925691" wikidata="Q141461" url="?curid=925691" title="Norway at the 2004 Summer Olympics">
<text>Norway competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s twenty-fourth appearance at the Summer Olympics, except for the 1904 Summer Olympics in St. Louis, and the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, due to the country&#x27;s support of the United States boycott. With the absence of women&#x27;s football and handball teams, Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports sent the nation&#x27;s smallest delegation to the Games since the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City. A total of 53 athletes, 36 men and 17 women, competed only in 12 different sports. There was only a single competitor in badminton, swimming, taekwondo, weightlifting, and wrestling.

Sixteen athletes from the Norwegian team had previously competed in Sydney, including Olympic silver medalists Kjersti Plätzer in women&#x27;s race walk and Olaf Tufte in men&#x27;s single sculls. At age 51, rifle shooting veteran Harald Stenvaag became the second Norwegian in Summer Olympic history to participate in six Games, tying a record set by sailor Magnus Konow. He was appointed by the National Olympic Committee to carry the Norwegian flag in the opening ceremony. Other notable Norwegian athletes featured kayak pair and world champions Nils Olav Fjeldheim and Eirik Verås Larsen, yachting siblings Christoffer and Siren Sundby, and breaststroke swimmer Alexander Dale Oen, the youngest of the team at age 19.

Despite fielding its smallest team since 1968, Norway left Athens with a remarkable tally of six medals, five golds and one bronze. As a result, the Games were considered the nation&#x27;s most successful Summer Olympics since 1920.

<text>Torna (Slovak: &quot;Turňa&quot;, Latin and Hungarian: &quot;Torna&quot;, ) is the name of a historic administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. It was located in present-day southeastern Slovakia and northern Hungary; today Turňa is only an informal designation of the corresponding territory in Slovakia.

The initially large county was one of the original counties in the Kingdom of Hungary, but was gradually reduced to a territory corresponding to a small territory around the Turňa River (). The capital of the county was Turňa Castle (), later the town of Turňa nad Bodvou ().

From 1785 to 1790, 1848–1859, and ultimately in 1882 it was merged with the county Abov to form the county Abaúj-Torna (&quot;Abov-Turňa&quot;).</text><links>

<doc id="925695" wikidata="Q7493975" url="?curid=925695" title="Shelter Records">
<text>Shelter Records was a U.S. record label started by Leon Russell and Denny Cordell that operated from 1969 to 1981. The company established offices in both Los Angeles and Tulsa, Russell&#x27;s home town, where the label sought to promote a &quot;workshop atmosphere&quot; with a recording studio in a converted church, adjoining houses for artists working at the studio, and other facilities. The Tulsa recording studio was housed in the historic The Church Studio. Russell remained with Shelter until 1976, when he and Cordell fell out. In a settlement, Cordell then became sole owner of the label, while Russell left to start his own label, Paradise Records.

The Shelter Records trademark is owned by Teresa Knox of The Church Studio.

In addition to Russell, the label signed other talents, such as Tulsa Sound artists J. J. Cale, Dwight Twilley Band and the Gap Band, as well as Alan Gerber, Jesse Barish (of Jesse, Wolff and Whings), Don Nix, Freddie King, Tom Petty &amp; the Heartbreakers, Phoebe Snow, Richard Torrance and Eureka, Willis Alan Ramsey, and the Grease Band.

Shelter Records also released &quot;Duppy Conqueror&quot;, the first American single by reggae artist Bob Marley.

==Distribution history==
Shelter Records was originally distributed by Blue Thumb Records, but then it was distributed by Capitol/EMI from 1970 until 1973. During this time, the label was red with an egg on top with an inverted Superman logo on the egg. This logo did not sit well with DC Comics, and they sued Shelter for trademark infringement. Shelter then blacked out the Superman logo on subsequent releases until the distribution deal ran out with Capitol/EMI. Afterwards, the Shelter logo was replaced by an egg with a hand-scrawled &quot;S&quot; on it.

From 1974 until 1975 (sporting a yellowish label and their new logo), Shelter was then distributed by MCA Records. Afterwards from 1975 to 1977, the label was distributed by ABC Records (the first label being yellow; the second one was reddish-orange with the Shelter egg inside a Saturn-style ring with a crescent Man in the Moon at the bottom of the label). In 1977, Shelter transferred distribution to Arista (principally for the Dwight Twilley Band), but the rights to Tom Petty and J. J. Cale were retained by ABC. Shelter continued as an active label until 1979, when ABC was sold to MCA. MCA released one more album using the Shelter label (a J.J. Cale album), then all remaining Shelter recordings held by ABC were put on another MCA subsidiary entitled Backstreet Records. The Shelter/Arista deal terminated in 1981, which was the effective end of Shelter Records. Shortly after the label&#x27;s demise, the catalog was purchased by Dunhill Compact Classics (later known as DCC), which reissued several Shelter catalog LPs and compilations. DCC (which issued mostly compilation CDs mostly licensed from other labels, many remastered by respected recording engineer Steve Hoffman) later went out of business.

In 1991, the Shelter music publishing catalog was sold to Rondor Music. During 1993, the Shelter catalogue was bought out by Capitol/EMI, and their imprint The Right Stuff reissued many titles (except for Tom Petty and J. J. Cale albums, as the Tom Petty Shelter albums are controlled by Petty&#x27;s estate and currently distributed by Rhino, owned by the Warner Music Group, also owners of Petty&#x27;s former label Reprise Records, and the J. J. Cale Shelter albums are controlled by Universal Music Group, the successor to MCA).

In the United Kingdom, records on the Shelter label were distributed by Island Records in the late 1970s.

<text>Sally Robbins (born 15 July 1981) is an Australian sportswoman. Originally from Perth, Western Australia, she attended the rowing program at the Western Australian Institute of Sport, and later represented Australia at the women&#x27;s four at the 2000 Olympics and the women&#x27;s eight at the 2004 Olympics. At the 2004 Olympics she stopped rowing due to exhaustion during the final part of the race, for which she was heavily criticised. After the conclusion of her rowing career, Robbins attempted to become a professional cyclist.

==Biography==
Robbins was born in Perth, Western Australia, and attended Melville Senior High School. She began rowing at the age of 13, and attended the Western Australian Institute of Sport.

Robbins was involved in an infamous incident in the 2004 Olympics final held on 22 August. The team was third through the first 1000 metres but had dropped to fifth position with 500 metres remaining, three seconds behind the Romanian crew in first position. During the final 400 metres Robbins, who was physically exhausted, dropped her oar, allowing it to drag in the water, gave up and lay back on teammate Julia Wilson&#x27;s lap. Australia, consequently, finished last, ten seconds behind the fifth-place crew.

Robbins was accused of mental weakness and publicly ridiculed in the Australian media as &quot;Lay-down Sally&quot;, a play on the Eric Clapton song of the same name. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported: &quot;In a team sport such as rowing what she did was unforgivable. It appears Robbins committed the greatest crime there is in honest sport: she quit.&quot; Even then Australian Prime Minister John Howard became involved in the row, saying: &quot;I&#x27;m not taking sides but it&#x27;s always regrettable, it&#x27;s tough and there&#x27;s a lot of pressure. It&#x27;s always a good idea to bind together but look, I wasn&#x27;t there and I can understand the passion the emotion and the effort that goes into these things and the sense of disappointment people feel.&quot;

This was not the first time Robbins had been involved in such an incident. In the women&#x27;s quad scull at the 2002 World Rowing Championships in Seville, Robbins had also dropped her oar, costing Australia certain victory. 2000 Summer Olympics silver medallist Rachael Taylor was quoted as saying: &quot;Australia was blitzing the race, leading the entire field all the way. It was as about as sure a thing as you could get to having the world title in the bag, when with approximately 400 metres to go Sally Robbins stopped rowing. The Australian crew dropped back and finished in fourth position. Sally&#x27;s three teammates were understandably shocked, devastated and inconsolable: not at all dissimilar to the sickening re-enactment I witnessed on Sunday.&quot;

In March 2006, Robbins conducted televised media interviews and expressed her goal to row for Australia at the 2008 Summer Olympics. However, ultimately, Robbins did not achieve the qualification times and was omitted from the squad.

In April and May 2007, Robbins&#x27; motivational problems were discussed in court by former team members Katie Foulkes (coxswain) and Kyeema Doyle when they were called upon by Sydney broadcaster Alan Jones to give evidence on his behalf in response to a defamation suit brought by Australian Olympic Committee President John Coates.

Without any apparent sense of irony, on Rowing Australia athletes profile page, Robbins personal motto is recorded as &quot;Never surrender the dream&quot;.

<text>The Kagawong River is a river on Manitoulin Island in Manitoulin District, Ontario, Canada which flows from Lake Kagawong to empty into Mudge Bay on the North Channel Lake Huron. The river falls over a limestone bluff at Bridal Veil Falls. &quot;Kagawong&quot; means &quot;mists rising from falling water&quot; in the Ojibwe language.

The Kagawong River consists of two parts. The first, at the level of Lake Kagawong, flows in an easterly direction out of the Lake reaching and passes under Highway 540 just above Bridal Veil Falls. The river is navigable by canoe, kayak, paddleboat and other shallow draft boats.

The lower Kagawong River below Bridal Veil Falls is fast flowing and shallow, and is therefore not navigable by boat. However, a viewing platform and a riverside walk give visual access to the Falls and provide a river walk down to the downtown area of Kagawong, and the harbour.

In late September – mid October, there is a salmon run.

<doc id="925706" wikidata="Q2663658" url="?curid=925706" title="Dark Horse Records">
<text>Dark Horse Records is a record label founded by former Beatle George Harrison in 1974. The label&#x27;s formation coincided with the winding down of the Beatles&#x27; Apple Records and allowed Harrison to continue supporting other artists&#x27; projects while maintaining his solo career. The initial signings were Indian musician Ravi Shankar and Splinter, the latter of whom provided the label with its only significant commercial success until Harrison himself signed with Dark Horse in 1976. The label was distributed internationally by A&amp;M Records for the first two years of its operation. Following a highly publicised split with A&amp;M, Harrison and Dark Horse formed a long-term partnership with Warner Bros. Records that lasted until the expiration of his contract in 1994.

Attitudes, Stairsteps and Keni Burke were among the other artists who recorded for Dark Horse, although it increasingly became a vehicle for Harrison&#x27;s solo releases once Warner&#x27;s had taken over distribution. After a ten-year period of inactivity, the label returned in 2002 with the posthumous release of Harrison&#x27;s final studio album, &quot;Brainwashed&quot;, followed by his &quot;Dark Horse Years&quot; box set in 2004. Dark Horse Records also issued the Shankar–Harrison compilation box set &quot;Collaborations&quot; in 2010.

In March 2021, the record label released &quot;Assembly&quot;, a new remastered collection of Joe Strummer&#x27;s solo work.

==Background==
Since the formation of the Beatles&#x27; EMI-affiliated Apple Records in 1968, George Harrison had produced and helped nurture acts signed to the label, including Jackie Lomax, Billy Preston and Badfinger, all of whom were little known at the time. Following the Beatles&#x27; break-up in 1970, Harrison continued in this role while maintaining a successful solo career, adding prestigious signings such as Ravi Shankar and Ronnie Spector to Apple&#x27;s roster. By 1973, when he was producing an ambitious &quot;East-meets-West&quot; album by Shankar and the debut by a duo from South Shields, Splinter, Apple was being wound down following Harrison, John Lennon and Ringo Starr severing their ties with Beatles manager Allen Klein. While all the former Beatles were contractually obliged to EMI until 26 January 1976, as solo artists, Harrison sought a new avenue for his extracurricular projects. He and Starr considered buying Apple in 1973 and running it themselves, but Harrison was wary of business complications associated with the label.&lt;ref name=&quot;ContraBand/StartingGate&quot;&gt;&quot;At the Starting Gate&quot;, Contra Band Music, 21 August 2012 (retrieved 28 October 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1974, he began a dialogue with David Geffen, head of Asylum Records in Los Angeles, and, according to Tom Petty&#x27;s later recollection, he also consulted Leon Russell, co-founder of Shelter Records, about setting up a label. Harrison eventually agreed terms with A&amp;M Records for the latter to distribute his new label worldwide. For a company name, Harrison used the title of a song he had written in 1973, &quot;Dark Horse&quot;. The inspiration for the Dark Horse Records logo came from a label on a tin that Harrison found during a trip to India. The logo features the seven-headed horse Uchchaisravas, a common figure in Indian art and mythology.

==History==
After Harrison signed with Dark Horse Records on 27 January 1976, all of his subsequent recordings were released through the label, starting with that year&#x27;s &quot;Thirty Three &amp; 1/3&quot; and ending with &quot;Live in Japan&quot; in 1992. After the latter, it went into hiatus for ten years.

Dark Horse was distributed by A&amp;M Records (1974–76), Warner Bros. Records (1976–94) and EMI (2002–04).

Dark Horse was revived with the posthumous release of &quot;Brainwashed&quot; in 2002. Harrison&#x27;s back catalogue on the label was remastered and reissued as the &quot;Dark Horse Years 1976–1992&quot; box set during 2004. In 2010, Dark Horse released the Ravi Shankar–George Harrison box set &quot;Collaborations&quot;, with distribution through Rhino Entertainment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olivia/Spinner&quot;&gt;Olivia Harrison, &quot;George Harrison and Ravi Shankar Box Set &#x27;Collaborations&#x27; Is a Labor of Love for Me&quot;, &quot;Spinner&quot;, 18 October 2010 (archived version retrieved 12 August 2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 all original Apple and Dark Horse Records albums were reissued and distributed by Universal Music Group.

On 22 January 2020, Dark Horse signed a distribution deal with BMG Rights Management. The deal marked the label&#x27;s revival by Harrison&#x27;s son Dhani, who announced that it had acquired Joe Strummer&#x27;s catalogue. Many classic Dark Horse albums returned to print under this new deal.

In December 2023, Sonicbond Publishing published the book &quot;Dark Horse Records: The Story of George Harrison&#x27;s Post-Beatles Record Label&quot;, a retrospective biography of the record company written by music journalist and radio host Aaron Badgley.

==Artists==
Though Dark Horse ultimately focused solely on Harrison&#x27;s releases, the label also released albums by the following artists between 1974 and 1978:
*Ravi Shankar
*Attitudes, a Los Angeles band
*Splinter, a South Shields duo
*The Stairsteps, a Chicago soul vocal group
*R&amp;B vocalist Keni Burke, a former member of the Stairsteps
*Henry McCullough, formerly guitarist with Joe Cocker and Wings
*Jiva, a California band

<text>Night and Day II is the 15th studio album by Joe Jackson, released in 2000. It is a sequel to his 1982 album, &quot;Night and Day&quot;. It is also a revisit to the style that album, featuring songs about the New York City lifestyle, seen through different characters.

While the original &quot;Night and Day&quot; took a satirical look at the downfalls of city life through songs such as &quot;TV Age&quot;, &quot;Cancer&quot; and &quot;Real Men&quot;, &quot;Night and Day II&quot; focuses primarily on the dark side of inner city living (the song, &quot;Happyland&quot;, for instance, is about the 1990 arson fire at Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx that killed 87 people) as seen though the eyes of a cynical New Yorker, as Jackson lived in New York at the time.

The cover artwork is a dark nighttime shot taken from within a New York City cab, with the World Trade Center in the background, taken a year prior to 9/11.

The music is built with contributions from Graham Maby (bass), and Sue Hadjopoulos (percussion). Also featured are the string quartet Ethel, and three guest vocalists: Iranian diva Sussan Deyhim, drag performer Dale De Vere and Marianne Faithfull, who sings vocals on &quot;Love Got Lost&quot;.

<doc id="925710" wikidata="Q32367" url="?curid=925710" title="Borsod County">
<text>Borsod was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. The capital of the county was Miskolc. After World War II, the county was merged with the Hungarian parts of Abaúj-Torna County and Zemplén counties to form Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén county.

==Etymology==
The name comes from the personal name &quot;Bors&quot; (an early medieval magnate) with the -d suffix used to derive place names in old Hungarian language. The personal name &quot;Bors&quot; could have derived from &quot;bors&quot; (Hungarian &quot;pepper&quot;) and/or derived from Turkish (a theory of János Melich) or from the Slavic personal name &quot;Boriš&quot; (a theory of Elemér Moór). The problem has not been sufficiently resolved yet. E.g. Lajos Kiss suggests the Turkish origin, whilst Slovak scholars have been suggesting the Slavic origin since the times of Ján Stanislav who accepted Moór&#x27;s theory as more reliable and pointed to several place names with similar etymology (&quot;*Bor[I]ša&quot;). Ján Steinhübel points to the Czech name Borša (a member of the retinue of Břetislav II); from the same name derives also e.g. Boršov nad Vltavou.

==Geography==
Before World War I, Borsod county shared borders with the counties of Gömör-Kishont, Abaúj-Torna, Zemplén, Szabolcs, Hajdú and Heves. The river Tisza formed the southeastern border, and the river Sajó flowed through the county. Its area was 3,629 km2 around 1910.

==History==
Borsod is one of the oldest counties of the Kingdom of Hungary. In the early history of the Kingdom of Hungary, each county (in Latin &quot;comitatus)&quot; formed around a castle (the majority of these castles were motte castles; most of the stone-built castles were constructed after the Mongol invasion of Hungary in the mid-13th century). The castle – which stood near modern-day Edelény – bore the name of its first steward, Bors, who lived during the reigns of either High Prince Géza or his son Stephen I.

The county&#x27;s borders became permanent in the early 14th century, when the neighbouring Torna County was formed, and they remained basically unchanged for the next six hundred years. Judging from the place names, originally the majority of the population were ethnic Hungarians, but later other groups immigrated to the area too: Pechenegs (in the late 10th/early 11th century) and &quot;úz&quot; groups (11th–12th century). This is also evident from place names like Szirmabesenyő &quot;(besenyő&quot; is the Hungarian word for Pecheneg) and Ózd (from &quot;úz&quot;).

The parishes of the county belonged to the Diocese of Eger from the beginning. Several monasteries were founded in the region, in Százd (by the Aba clan, 11th century), Boldva (by the queen, 12th century), Kács (by the Örsúr clan), Tapolca (by the Miskolc clan), Bélháromkút (by the Bishop of Eger, after 1232).
The Battle of Mohi – marking the beginning of the Mongol invasion which had a disastrous effect on Hungary – took place in Borsod county, near the village of Muhi, on 11 April 1241. The Mongols defeated the army of King Béla IV. During the two-year invasion, 16 of the county&#x27;s 69 villages were completely destroyed.

In 1248, when King Béla ordered stone castles to be built throughout the kingdom, several new castles were constructed in Borsod county too (Cserépvár, Csorbakő, Dédes, Diósgyőr, Éleskő), many in places of former, destroyed motte castles. The monastery of Boldva was destroyed during a second Mongol invasion in 1285.

In the papal tithe registers from 1332 to 1335, the county is mentioned as having 91 parishes. The county had about 240 villages at that time. Before the battle of Mohács (1526), which marks the beginning of the Ottoman occupation of Hungary (lasting for over 160 years) the county had 13 castles, 13 market towns &quot;(oppidum&quot;, including Miskolc and Mezőkövesd) and 250 villages, owned by 235 different feudal lords including dioceses and monasteries. The steward of the county was the captain of the Castle of Diósgyőr.

In 1566, the Ottomans occupied the castles of Dédes and Diósgyőr, and after the Battle of Mezőkeresztes ( 26–28 October 1596) they occupied Miskolc too. These areas were under Ottoman control until 1687.

In the next century, an important historical event of Prince Rákóczi&#x27;s freedom fight took place in the county: the Diet of Ónod, where Hungary was declared independent of Habsburg rule, was held here, next to the village of Ónod, on 18 June 1707.

In 1724, it was decided that the county hall of Borsod would be built in Miskolc, thus the town officially became the seat of the county. The building was constructed between 1825 and 1827.
There were some minor changes in the area of the county during the 19th century: between 1807 and 1812 the villages Szőlőske, Cegléd, Tihamér, Almagyar, Felnémet and Bekölce (many of these are today city parts of Eger) were annexed to the neighbouring Heves county, while Egerfarmos, Ivánka, Szőkepuszta and the mill of Kistálya were annexed from Heves to Borsod. In 1850 several other towns and villages of Borsod were annexed to neighbouring counties: Andornak, Kistálya and Felsőtárkány to Heves, Domaháza and Sikátor to Gömör and Kishont. Onga, formerly belonging to Abaúj county, and Külsőböcs, formerly of Zemplén county, became parts of Borsod. In 1907, Miskolc was granted the rank of city with municipal rights, becoming &quot;de jure&quot; independent from Borsod county.

Of the 63 counties of Hungary, Borsod was the 39th largest by area, 23rd largest by population and 11th largest by population density (80 persons/km2) in 1910. Between 1899 and 1913 many people left Hungary and emigrated to other countries; from Borsod 23,797 people emigrated, which, not counting the 7,313 who eventually came back, makes the county 18th in the list of Hungarian counties with the most emigrees.

In 1919, Borsod county had 177 villages (13 of them had a population larger than 2000).

After World War I and the Treaty of Trianon, Hungary lost many of its territories to neighbouring countries. The loss did not affect Borsod county, its borders remained unchanged, but of the surrounding counties, Abaúj-Torna (Abaúj had been merged with Torna in 1882) lost 48% of its area to the newly formed state of Czechoslovakia, Zemplén lost 72% and Gömör-Kishont lost 92.5%. In 1923, Borsod county was merged with the remaining part of former Gömör-Kishont county to form &quot;Borsod-Gömör-Kishont temporarily united county&quot; with its capital at Miskolc.

On 2 November 1938, the First Vienna Award returned to Hungary some parts of Gömör and Kishont lost in 1920; Borsod and Gömör-Kishont became independent from each other again but the border between them slightly changed.

In 1941, the county had 382,324 inhabitants (378,303 Hungarians, 272 Germans, 240 Slovaks, 165 Romanians, 210 Ruthenians, 2103 Gypsies and 2324 other; 225,476 Roman Catholics, 19,625 Greek Catholics, 226 Greek Orthodox, 8657 Evangelicals, 109,809 Protestants, 105 Unitarians, 970 Baptists, 16,997 Jews, 164 of other religions).

After World War II, the Vienna Award was declared void and Hungary lost the northern territories to Czechoslovakia again; in 1945, the 1938 law was repealed and the remaining part of Gömör-Kishont was merged with Borsod county again, forming Borsod-Gömör county. On 16 March 1950, during an extensive administrative reform, the remaining parts of Abaúj-Torna and Zemplén counties were merged to Borsod-Gömör, creating the modern-day county of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén, with only Borsod&#x27;s county seat Miskolc keeping its county seat status – Sátoraljaújhely, of Zemplén, and Szikszó, of Abaúj county, lost it.
Today, the area that was once Borsod county is the most urbanized and industrialized area of Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén, with 3/4 of the county&#x27;s population living there. The county&#x27;s three largest cities – Miskolc, Ózd and Kazincbarcika – can also be found there. In colloquial speech, &quot;Borsod county&quot; is often used to mean Borsod-Abaúj-Zemplén as a whole.

<text>The Mindemoya River is a river on Manitoulin Island in Ontario, Canada, which flows about from Lake Mindemoya to empty into Providence Bay on Lake Huron. There is a boardwalk and large sandy beach at the mouth of the river. &quot;Mindemoya&quot; comes from the Ojibwe word &quot;mindimooyenh&quot;, which means &quot;old woman&quot;. The river is accessible by both boat and foot at a number of points and is often fished for salmon and trout.

<doc id="925713" wikidata="Q2265719" url="?curid=925713" title="I.R.S. Records">
<text>I.R.S. Records was a major American record label founded by Miles Copeland III and Jay Boberg in 1979. I.R.S. produced some of the most popular bands of the 1980s, and was particularly known for issuing records by college rock, new wave and alternative rock artists, including R.E.M., the Go-Go&#x27;s, Wall of Voodoo, and Fine Young Cannibals. Currently the label is distributed by parent company Universal Music Group.

==History==
Miles Copeland III, the son of CIA officer Miles Copeland Jr., played many roles in the U.K. punk rock and new wave music industry of the middle to late 1970s: agent, manager, producer, magazine publisher, record company and label owner. His brother Ian was the head of a talent agency, Frontier Booking International (F.B.I.), while his brother Stewart played drums for The Police, a band that Copeland managed. The Police&#x27;s first album was released on A&amp;M Records in 1978 with a hit single, &quot;Roxanne&quot;, that Copeland called a turning point in his life.

Building on success with the Police, Copeland convinced Jerry Moss, co-owner of A&amp;M, to establish the I.R.S. division in 1979. I.R.S. stood for International Record Syndicate.

From 1983 to 1987, I.R.S. Records sponsored a monthly MTV show called &quot;I.R.S. Records Presents The Cutting Edge&quot;, hosted by Peter Zaremba of The Fleshtones. The series concentrated on bands that recorded for the label. The show concept would later evolve into the alternative rock program &quot;120 Minutes&quot;, which was launched in 1986 and co-existed with &quot;Cutting Edge&quot; for about a year and a half.

I.R.S. releases were distributed by A&amp;M until 1985, then by MCA Records until 1990, and by EMI until the label folded in 1996. In 1985, Copeland brokered a deal to switch the label&#x27;s distributor to MCA Records. Under the agreement, A&amp;M continued to release the label&#x27;s pre-1985 catalog, much of which still can be found under the A&amp;M banner. Copeland sold the I.R.S. music publishing to Rondor Music in 1995.

The label folded in May 1996, with its last release being &quot;All Set&quot; by Buzzcocks, issued two weeks before the closure. Shortly after, Copeland formed Ark 21 Records.
In 2011, EMI revived the label; as of 2012, the new label had Chiddy Bang and Foxy Shazam on its roster. In October 2013, shortly after the integration of EMI into its successor, Universal Music Group, the label was revived again as I.R.S. Nashville, with Striking Matches, Marc Scibilia and Cowboy Jack Clement on its roster before being shut down once again in 2015.

==Faulty Products labels==
Faulty Products was the UK holding company for I.R.S. Records of the UK record labels set up by Copeland. It included Illegal Records, Deptford Fun City Records and others. Faulty Products was also an American independent record label and distribution company for other indie labels between 1980 and 1982. Faulty handled artists (such as The Bangles) that did not go through I.R.S.&#x27;s distribution deal with A&amp;M.

Illegal Records was set up by Miles Copeland with his younger brother Stewart and the manager of The Police, Paul Mulligan. The label released The Police&#x27;s debut single, &quot;Fall Out&quot;. Deptford Fun City Records was set up by Miles Copeland in the late 1970s as an outlet for Deptford, England bands such as Alternative TV and Squeeze.

I.R.S. No Speak, also known as No Speak Records, was set up as an all-instrumental imprint of I.R.S. in January 1988. It released albums by Stewart Copeland, Wishbone Ash, and William Orbit.

Tribal America was a label run by Rob DiStefano that was distributed by I.R.S. from 1991 until IRS folded in 1996. It concentrated on house music, a type of electronic dance music. The most prominent releases on its roster were by the production team Murk and also the song &quot;So Get Up&quot; an iconic vocal poem by Californian author/songwriter Ithaka Darin Pappas, backed by the Progressive house sounds of USL from Lisbon, Portugal. DiStefano went on to found Twisted America Records.

<doc id="925715" wikidata="Q831087" url="?curid=925715" title="Geographic Data Files">
<text>Geographic Data Files (GDF) is an interchange file format for geographic data.
In contrast with generic GIS formats, GDF provides detailed rules for data capture and representation, and an extensive catalog of standard features, attributes and relationships. The most recent extension expanded applicability further towards pedestrian navigation, 3-D map rendering, and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).

GDF is commonly used for data interchange in many industries such as automotive navigation systems, fleet management, dispatch management, road traffic analysis, traffic management, and automatic vehicle location.

Originated as a flat plain-text file, GDF is not intended to be used directly for any large scale geographic application and normally requires conversion into a more efficient format. Consumability has been increased with most-recent developments for XML and SQL renditions.

The maps in GDF format are provided by many map vendors such as HERE, TomTom, Mapscape BV, GeoSmart, Automotive Navigation Data, AutoNavi and NavInfo.

==Standardisation==

GDF is an international standard that is used to model, describe and transfer road networks and other geographic data.

The standard was initially drawn up by CEN in co-operation with digital map providers, automotive and electronic equipment manufacturers. The outcome of these standardisation efforts (CEN GDF 3.0, or ENV14825:1996) has formed the major input to a global standard created by ISO/TC204 Sub Working group 3:
* ISO GDF 4.0, formally referred to ISO14825:2004, now replaced by
* ISO GDF 5.0, formally referred to ISO14825:2011.

However, despite the existence of an ISO GDF standard, the nature of model abstractions as well as semantic interpretations and proprietary content extensions lead to interoperability issues between flavors of GDF map products from different vendors. In practice the GDF files are not fully interchangeable due to vendor specific extensions. To this end, GDF5.0 provides major improvements in terms of extended meta data and flags for signalling implementation choices.

===The new GDF5.0===

The specifications of GDF5.0 were developed and compiled between 2001 and 2008, involving experts from Australia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Japan, Republic of Korea, the Netherlands, and the United States of America. Extensive activities towards harmonization with ISO/TC211 standards were undertaken. GDF 5.0 was published in July 2011.

Major GDF5.0 enhancements include UML model migration &amp; refinements; harmonization with linear referencing and geo-spatial web standards; support for 3-D content and time coordinates; comprehensive character set and phonetic representations; and new XML and SQL based delivery formats.

===Background and rationale of GDF standardization===

By the late 1980s, producers and users of digital road map data became increasingly aware of the need for a common data interchange standard. Lack of such a standard was seen as an impediment to the commercial growth and success of industries using such data. Before the advent of the Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) industry, development of spatial data interchange standards was done mostly on a regional basis and not designed for the specialised requirements of road transport-related applications.

In the 1990s, the GDF standard was instrumental in enabling the European business-to-business (B2B) market for in-vehicle navigation in that it provided interoperability for exchanging digital map data between map manufacturers and navigation system integrators. The GDF specifications provided a base for both the capturing of geographic content and the exchanging of it. Its original design foresaw a powerful, application-independent model, while its initial rendition as a standard specifically addressed the requirements for the richness of navigable map databases. Since then, GDF has evolved in terms of data modelling capabilities, broadened international applicability, expanded geographic domains, and diversified exchange formats. As a result, GDF covers a wide range of application domains and has been adapted to many geo-spatial technologies.

<doc id="925718" wikidata="Q2736088" url="?curid=925718" title="Seacroft">
<text>Seacroft is an outer-city suburb/township consisting mainly of council estate housing covering an extensive area of east Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. It lies in the LS14 Leeds postcode area, around east of Leeds city centre.

It sits in the Killingbeck &amp; Seacroft ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds East parliamentary constituency.

The population of the corresponding Leeds City Ward was nearly 18,000 in 2001 and fell to 14,426 in 2011. The name is often used as a catch-all for Seacroft and the neighbouring areas of Whinmoor and Swarcliffe, other large east Leeds council estates which merge into each other.

Seacroft includes one of the largest council estates in the country and Yorkshire&#x27;s second-largest council estate, after Bransholme in Kingston upon Hull. The latter, however, was part of Humberside county from 1974 to 1996. Because of its size, Seacroft has often been referred to as a town. The original vision, envisaged by the council, was that it would be a &#x27;Town within the City Limits&#x27;, and the Seacroft Civic Centre was often referred to as the &#x27;Seacroft Town Centre&#x27;.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Seacroft&quot; is first attested in the Domesday Book of 1086, as &quot;Sacroft&quot; and &quot;Sacrofft&quot;; the spellings &quot;Secroft&quot;, &quot;Secrofte&quot; are attested around 1090 (surviving in a manuscript of 1403). The name comes from the Old English words (&quot;large body of water&quot;) and (&quot;enclosure&quot;). Thus the name once meant &quot;enclosure near a pool or marsh&quot;.

In vicinity of Seacroft was once found the field-name &quot;Chetwde&quot;, attested in 1341, which is unusual among English names for deriving partly from Common Brittonic: its first element is the word found today in modern Welsh as (&quot;woodland&quot;). The second element, added after Brittonic ceased to be understood in the region is the English word &quot;wood&quot;, making the name tautological in meaning.

==The Green==
Seacroft was at one time a small village between Leeds and York. The village green, known as &quot;The Green&quot; still exists, and is one of the oldest in the country. It has the Cricketers Arms pub on the north side and St James parish church (built 1845, architect T. Hellyer) on the south side. John Wesley preached on The Green, and as a result a Wesleyan Chapel (Methodist Church) was built close by. Seacroft Green has an active residents&#x27; association.

==History==
===Seacroft village===

Seacroft village is mentioned in the Domesday Book (1086). Evidence of much earlier inhabitation was found during construction of the estate in the 1950s. A stone axe dating from the Neolithic age (3500–2100 BC) was found on Kentmere Avenue. In addition, two silver Roman coins were found on The Green in the 1850s.

Seacroft village is the original part of Seacroft, around The Green and Cricketers Arms (pictured above), and is often referred to today. Seacroft Hall was built in the 17th century by the Shiletto family incorporating extensive landscaping and parkland. Despite being a listed building, the hall was demolished in the 1950s. The original entrance lodge still stands on York Road, with Parklands School on South Parkway now occupying the location of the hall. There is one shop in the area that was originally Seacroft Village, a small village off licence, which has been built since the building of the estate.

Seacroft Grange was built in 1627 for the Tottie family and is also known as Tottie Hall. It is a grade II listed building, along with its service buildings. Although the English Heritage record says it was rebuilt in 1837 other sources record the building as original, noting that in 1837 the new tenant John Wilson renamed it to Seacroft Grange and set his coat of arms over the door. The building included a celebrated late 17th century staircase thought to have been brought from Austhorpe Hall. It is now part of Seacroft Grange Care Village.

See also The Seacroft Village Preservation Society.

There is an old non-operating windmill, that pre-dates the estate, which has been incorporated into a hotel (now known as the Britannia Hotel Leeds).
===Satellite town within the city boundary===
The village developed slowly over the centuries and saw very little change until the post-war years. Work on the estate began in the 1950s. Many of the older houses on the estate are more traditional red-brick semis built around the Beechwood area, to the North of the estate. In the 1960s many prefabricated houses and high-rise flats were constructed on the estate. Two main roads were built through the estate, these being North Parkway and South Parkway. North Parkway was built with a dual carriageway, in a similar way as Oak Tree Drive, Coldcotes Drive and Gipton Approach in neighbouring Gipton.

In 1934, Leeds City Council bought for municipal housing, and after World War II the majority of houses and blocks of flats were built. The council had planned for Seacroft to be a &quot;satellite town within the city boundary&quot;

In addition to this vision, other areas surrounding Seacroft were built using the same principle. In the 1960s building work in the Swarcliffe and Stanks areas started, and in the 1970s in Whinmoor. However, none of these were as large or ambitious as Seacroft, with the intention that these areas use many of the amenities built along with the Seacroft Estate such as the Civic Centre and Seacroft&#x27;s secondary schools. As such amenities were kept to a minimum in Swarcliffe and Whinmoor, with the estates only having small local shops, public houses and primary schools. Seacroft also has the main central bus interchange for North East Leeds, although the nearest railway station is in Cross Gates.

===Seacroft Civic Centre===

The 1960s also saw the construction of the Seacroft Civic Centre, which was at the time a novel way of building an outdoor purpose built town centre. The Civic Centre had a Grandways supermarket and a Woolworths Group as well as many other smaller shops, banks, pubs and a library. In the 1990s it had become apparent that the condition of the Civic Centre had deteriorated significantly in the 30 years since its construction. Talks were held with Leeds City Council, and Tesco were found as the preferred bidder to rebuild the Seacroft Civic Centre.

===Seacroft Green Shopping Centre===
In 1999, work began clearing the site and in 2000 the new Seacroft Green Shopping Centre opened. The Tesco supermarket was cited at the time to be the largest in Europe, a claim which may not have been true. It is, however, still an enormous supermarket spread over two levels (the second being a large mezzanine level, which was built a few years after the Tesco store had opened to give more space within the store). The car park was also enlarged and other shop units were built along the side of the supermarket, making the centre a crescent shape. The huge supermarket as well as the other shops promised to create hundreds more jobs then would be lost through the loss of trade in the Civic Centre, which among other factors made the redevelopment favourable with many Seacroft residents.
The Seacroft Green Shopping Centre is also the main transport interchange in Seacroft, with the main bus station for Seacroft and the surrounding areas being centred there. From here buses run out through the estate as well as to the city centre, Wetherby and Harrogate. Seacroft bus station has five stands and an average daily footfall of 2,687. (See Transport)

The centre was not entirely popular with many local residents who said they had lost their town centre to a Tesco supermarket and to an extent, this may be true. Although there are shops besides Tesco, they are far fewer than there were, the precinct area has been lost, the pubs in the centre have been lost, and there are no offices. Until the building of the new centre, and since the closure of Grandways, it was said that Seacroft suffered from &#x27;food poverty&#x27; and fresh produce could not be bought on the estate. This was probably not true as there was a Co-op (now McColls in 2018) on South Parkway.

The rebuilding of the Civic Centre did not alter the deprivation on the estate. Throughout the 2000s (decade), the condition of many of the houses on the estate deteriorated, particularly amongst the prefabricated housing to the South West of the estate. Many houses were vacated and either their condition or lack of demand dictated that the council boarded them up. The estate&#x27;s high rise flats are seen as a refuge as they are harder to break into and in better condition than the houses, as such they have largely been allocated to older residents. Some (including Queensview) have become sheltered housing.

===Amenities elsewhere===
Regular bus services allow residents to use amenities in Leeds city centre, Cross Gates and Wetherby. The Cross Gates Centre (formerly Arndale Centre) provides many high street shops which Seacroft lacks, while Wetherby&#x27;s many pubs make it an alternative destination for evening entertainment.

==Architecture==


Seacroft has a variety of styles of architecture. The area surrounding the green has many old buildings, dating back to the 18th century and before. The estate also shows a variety of different styles employed by Leeds City Council for the duration of the estate&#x27;s construction. The earlier houses dating back to the 1950s are red brick traditional terraces and semis. In the late 1960s and 1970s prefabricated housing was built towards the South West of the estate. The build quality of these houses was notably poor and many have now been demolished to be replaced with modern housing . The older council houses were generally built to a higher quality and are still in good condition. The brutalist Seacroft Civic Centre stood until its demolition in 1999, when it was replaced by the Seacroft Green Shopping Centre, which is of a fairly standard design for a large supermarket and purpose-built shops. There are also many high-rise blocks of flats around the estate, mainly near the Shopping Centre, towards the bottom of South Parkway and Beechwood Avenue, around the Ramshead area and in the Bogart Hill area. Starting in 2018, many new houses are being built on the eastern end of South Parkway.
Religious buildings include the stone-built St James&#x27;s Parish Church (C of E, 1845), a brick Wesleyan Chapel (1874), a brick Congregational Church (1951, badly damaged in an arson attack in 2015, leading to its demolition in 2017) and a brick Roman Catholic Church, Our Lady of Good Counsel (1954).
==Seacroft Hospital==
Seacroft Hospital is Leeds&#x27; third-largest hospital, being significantly smaller than the Leeds General Infirmary and St James&#x27; University Hospital. Situated between Seacroft and Killingbeck, opposite the former Killingbeck Isolation Hospital, the hospital is accessible from the A64 York Road. It was constructed between 1893 and 1904, with a brick clock tower (also a water tower) designed by E. T. Hall under Arts and Crafts influence.

Services have been moved from Seacroft Hospital to other hospitals around Leeds. Many of the buildings are in a poor state of repair. The health authority, in keeping with its policy to concentrate all services at the Leeds General Infirmary and St James hospitals, considers selling off the older parts of the hospital for redevelopment.

==Industry==
There is a small industrial estate in Seacroft on Limewood Approach. Cable and Wireless had a depot there for many years, but it closed in 2008. On the estate, Seacroft Waste Sorting Facility is based, Leeds City Council have a major depot and Transco operated a small facility until 2008. Large factories of Agfa and Unilever are situated in nearby Whinmoor.

==Education==

===Primary===
The primary schools in Seacroft are:
*Beechwood Primary School, Kentmere Avenue LS14 6QB
*Grange Farm Primary School , Bancroft Rise LS14 1AX
*Our Lady of Good Counsel Catholic Primary School, Pigeon Cote Road LS14 1EP
*Parklands Primary School , Dufton Approach LS14 6ED
*Seacroft Grange Primary School, Moresdale Lane, LS14 6JR

===Secondary===

The Bishop Young Church of England Academy opened on 1 May 2017, the building was previously the David Young Community Academy (DYCA) which was founded in 2006 and closed in spring of 2017, named after David Young, a former bishop of Ripon. It is a state-funded academy sponsored by the Church of England.
Leeds East Academy is a coeducational school that originated in Parkland Girls&#x27; High School (built 1954) on South Parkway. This was the last single-sex state school in Leeds before its closure. Leeds East Academy has now relocated to new buildings on the same site.

The main secondary school in Seacroft was Foxwood School, which became an adult education centre, the East Leeds Family Learning Centre, but was demolished in 2009.
The school was used as &#x27;San Quentin High&#x27; in &quot;The Beiderbecke Affair&quot;. The buildings were completed in 1962 and are a complex of buildings set in a square with a central courtyard. The main building was a six-storey tower block. Notable former pupils include Andrew Edge (musician), David Harvey (footballer) and Ellery Hanley (rugby league player). Former teachers include Colin Burgon (Labour Party MP for Elmet which included Wetherby, Garforth, Cross Gates and Swarcliffe), who himself was from Gipton.

==Politics==
Seacroft falls into the Killingbeck &amp; Seacroft electoral ward of Leeds City Council and Leeds East parliamentary constituency, represented by Labour MP Richard Burgon. As of 2018, it has three Labour councillors.

Seacroft was formerly a township in the parishes of Whitkirk and Leeds and a chapelry in the parish of Whitkirk, in 1866 Seacroft became a separate civil parish, on 9 November 1912 the parish was abolished and merged with Leeds. In 1911 the parish had a population of 1695.

==Local media==
The local newspaper for Seacroft is the &quot;Yorkshire Evening Post&quot;, thought the &quot;Wetherby News&quot; is also sold in the area (although its news coverage generally stops beyond the Shadwell and Whinmoor areas). The local BBC radio station is BBC Radio Leeds. Many other Leeds radio stations can be received, but ChapelFM deals specifically with Seacroft and surrounding areas. Neighbouring areas such as Whinmoor are often covered in Wetherby&#x27;s Tempo FM.

==Reputation==
Seacroft has a poor reputation across Leeds. A large portion of the housing is council owned, and the few jobs tend to be low paid casual or manual work. Many of the houses, particularly prefabricated housing around South Parkway have been boarded up and are unfit for any future habitation. This is due to a multimillion-pound city re-development scheme whose earlier progress can be seen in the similar estates around the Coal Road area. The area&#x27;s poor reputation has been focused on by journalist Donal MacIntyre. Neighbouring Gipton also shares this poor reputation. 85.49% of occupied houses in Seacroft fall within the Band A council tax rate (the lowest based on house values). However, the negative image of Seacroft was challenged in 2008 by a BBC article called &#x27;The Estate&#x27; depicting life on the estate.

===Recorded crime statistics===

==Transport==

===Public transport===

Seacroft bus station was rebuilt as part of the Seacroft Green Shopping Centre and has five drive-in-reverse-out stands. Buses go from here to Leeds City Centre and to other neighbouring areas of the city such as Cross Gates, Gipton and Whinmoor as well as Wetherby. First Leeds runs the majority of the services that serve the bus station. Their service 49 serves the Monkswood Gate area in the north of Seacroft, but not the bus station.

The closest railway station is Cross Gates, with services operating to Leeds, Garforth, Bradford Interchange, Halifax, York, Hull and Scarborough.

===East Leeds Orbital Route (ELOR)===
Since the 1960s, the Leeds Outer Ring Road has been considered to create a social barrier between Seacroft and Swarcliffe, which prompted calls for a bypass around East Leeds&#x27; suburbs. The project started in summer 2018 and is set to build a new route linking the orbital Ring Road (A6120) at Red Hall to the A58, the A64 and Leeds Road to connect with Thorpe Park at Junction 46 of the M1, set to be complete by summer 2023 with enhancement finished by autumn 2023.

The East Leeds Orbital Route is the biggest infrastructure project undertaken by Leeds City Council for fifty years, since the completion of the Leeds Inner Ring Road in 1974. It is intended to ease congestion in existing residential areas like Cross Gates, Seacroft and Whitkirk, and will also play a key role in the growth plans for the city for years to come. It will allow the development of the surrounding areas of the road, with the development of possible new shops, houses, and schools.

<doc id="925719" wikidata="Q1224694" url="?curid=925719" title="Digital asset management">
<text>Digital asset management (DAM) and the implementation of its use as a computer application is required in the collection of digital assets to ensure that the owner, and possibly their delegates, can perform operations on the data files.

== Terminology ==

The term &quot;media asset management&quot; (MAM) may be used in reference to Digital Asset Management when applied to the sub-set of digital objects commonly considered &quot;media&quot;, namely audio recordings, photos, and videos. Any editing process that involves media, especially video, can make use of a MAM to access media components to be edited together or combined with a live feed in a fluent manner. A MAM typically offers at least one searchable index of the images, audio, and videos it contains, constructed from metadata harvested from the images using pattern recognition, or input manually.

Digital asset management (DAM) may focus on the electronic management of any form of a digitally stored piece of information. DAM is certainly strategic, while MAM is almost always tactical. Both asset management primarily reflect long-term stored content that is used for archiving, preservation, and most notably reuse.

==Management==

===Creation===

Applications implement Digital Asset Management (DAM) by importing it from the analog and/or digital domains (by encoding, scanning, optical character recognition, etc.) or by authoring it as a new object.

===Indexing===
A primary function of a DAM system is to make assets easily available to its users by providing a searchable index that supports retrieval of assets by their content and/or metadata. The cataloging function is usually part of the ingestion process for new assets.

===Workflow===
Digital assets will typically have a lifecycle, which may include various states such as creation, approval, live, archived, and deleted.

===Version control===
Often a DAM system will store earlier versions of a digital asset and allow those to be downloaded or reverted to. Therefore, a DAM system can operate as an advanced type of version control system.

===Access control===
Finally, a DAM system typically includes security controls ensuring relevant people have access to assets. This will often involve integration with existing directory services via a technology such as single sign-on.

== Categorization ==

Smaller DAM systems are used in a particular operational context, for instance, in video production systems. The key differentiators between them are the types of input encoders used for creating digital copies of assets to bring them under management, and the output decoders and/or formatters used to make them usable as documents and/or online resources. The metadata of a content item can serve as a guide to the selection of the codec(s) needed to handle the content during processing and may be of use when applying access control rules to enforce authorization policy.

=== Requirements ===
Assets that require specific technologies to be used in a workflow need to have their bandwidth, latency, and access control requirements considered in the design of the tools that create or store them, as well as in the architecture of the system that distributes and archives them.
When assets are not actively being worked on, they can be stored in a DAM in various formats, including as a blob (binary large object in a database) or as a file in a standard file system, which is &quot;cheaper&quot; to store than the form needed during operations on them. This allows the implementation of large-scale DAM as an assembly of high-performance processing systems within a network with a high-density storage solution at its center.

==Types of systems==

Digital asset management systems fall into the following classifications:
* Brand management system: Enforce brand presentation within an organization by making approved logos, fonts, and product images easily accessible.
* Library or archive: Provide bulk storage of infrequently changing video or photo assets.
* Media asset management systems: Handling assets in the audiovisual domain including audio, video, or still images.
* Production management systems: Manage assets being created on the fly for use in live media production or as visual effects for use in gaming applications, TV, or films.
* Streaming: Facilitate on-demand delivery of digital content, like TV shows or movies, to end users on behalf of digital retailers.

All of these types will include features for workflow management, collaboration, project management, and revision control.

== Media asset issues ==

An asset can exist in several formats and in a sequence of versions. The digital version of the original asset is generally captured in as high resolution, colour depth, and (if applicable) frame rate as needed to ensure that results are of acceptable quality for the end-use. There can also be thumbnail copies of lower quality for use in visual indexing.

Metadata for an asset can include its packaging, encoding, provenance, ownership and access rights, and location of original creation. It is used to provide hints to the tools and systems used to work on, or with, the asset about how it should be handled and displayed.
