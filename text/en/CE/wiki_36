<text>Sir Ronald Macmillan Algie (22 October 1888 – 23 July 1978) was a New Zealand politician who served as Speaker of the House of Representatives for six years in the 1960s. He described himself as &quot;a Tory in the old tradition&quot;.

==Early life==
Algie was born on 22 October 1888, in Wyndham, a small town in New Zealand&#x27;s Southland Region. He was educated at Arrowtown, Thames High School and Balclutha District High School. He became a teacher at Paeroa District High School before transferring to a school in Ponsonby and later was the junior English master at Seddon Memorial Technical College. He attended Auckland University College to study law and gained an LLB in 1913 and an LLM in 1915. In 1920, aged 31, he became the first professor of law at Auckland University College. He was noted for his strong intellectual performance, and also for his conservative views.

On 4 December 1917 at St Mary&#x27;s pro-Cathedral, Parnell, Algie married Helen Adair McMaster, a prominent alpinist whose climbs included an ascent of Aoraki / Mount Cook.

==Member of Parliament==




In 1937, Algie became the director of the Freedom Association, an organisation which strongly opposed the left-wing Labour Party government of the time. The Freedom Association quickly became linked to the new National Party, and Algie became one of the party&#x27;s more prominent supporters and was involved in the electorate. The incumbent MP for Remuera was National&#x27;s Bill Endean who was unpopular among supporters, so much so that he was nearly deselected for the planned 1941 general election. The 1941 election was postponed due to the war, though, and Endean failed to get selected by the National Party for the and Algie was chosen instead. Endean was overseas at the time of the selection, but even if he had been present, Gustafson believes that the &quot;elderly, dull Endean would have been no match for the clever and witty Algie&quot;. Endean was the first sitting National MP who failed to get re-selected. Algie won the seat and entered Parliament.

Algie proved to be a skilled Parliamentary debater, and has been described by Hugh Templeton as the best debater of his time. Even opponents such as Bob Semple respected Algie&#x27;s rhetorical abilities. He was also noted for remaining polite throughout debates, and for his willingness to apologise for any offence he accidentally gave.

===Cabinet minister===
After the 1949 election, when Sidney Holland formed the first National government, Algie was immediately elevated to Cabinet. He was initially appointed Minister of Education, and later became Minister of Broadcasting and Minister for Science and Industrial Research. He also co-led the committee that looked into the future of the Legislative Council, the upper house of the New Zealand Parliament, which was abolished from 1951. In the end, however, Algie&#x27;s proposals for a Senate were not pursued, and New Zealand&#x27;s parliament has not had an upper house since that time.

In 1953, Algie was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal. Algie briefly returned to Opposition after the 1957 election, which National lost. In opposition he was appointed Shadow Minister of Foreign Affairs.

===Speaker of the House===
When National regained power after the 1960 election, Algie is believed to have wanted the post of Minister of External Affairs, but was not given it (possibly because of his age; he was seventy-two). Instead, he was convinced to take up the Speakership. He officially assumed office at the beginning of the 1961 parliamentary term.

As Speaker, Algie was known for his strong insistence on politeness in debates. He also undertook a number of reforms of Parliamentary procedure to accommodate the changing nature of politics. He served six years as Speaker, retiring at the 1966 election. He was generally praised for his performance in the role and in the 1964 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours Algie was appointed a Knight Bachelor. Algie was succeeded in the Remuera seat by Allan Highet.

Algie died in Auckland on 23 July 1978.

<doc id="914767" wikidata="Q3879579" url="?curid=914767" title="Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Women's 4 × 100 metre medley relay">
<text>The women&#x27;s 4 × 100 metre medley relay took place on 20–21 August at the Olympic Aquatic Centre of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Athens, Greece.

The Australians reinforced their claim to become the strongest women&#x27;s team in the world with a convincing triumph over their American rivals in the event. Giaan Rooney, Leisel Jones, Petria Thomas, and Jodie Henry broke almost a full second off the world record set by Team USA in 2000, stopping the clock at 3:57.32. At the start of the race, the U.S. team got off to a flying start in the backstroke, until the Australians reeled them in on the butterfly leg. Thomas blasted a remarkable split of 56.67, the fastest of all-time in Olympic history, to overhaul Jenny Thompson of the U.S. team, and eventually move the Aussies in front of the race. The anchor freestyle leg left Henry to go up against Kara Lynn Joyce, and the Australians looked unbeatable with Henry, touching the wall first in 52.97, the second-fastest split of all-time.

Meanwhile, the U.S. team of Thompson, Joyce, Natalie Coughlin, and Amanda Beard settled only for the silver in 3:59.12, almost two seconds behind the Aussies. The Germans maintained their pace to earn a bronze, and finished in a European record of 4:00.72.

Competing in her fourth Olympics for Team USA, Thompson became the most decorated American athlete in history with her twelfth career medal, including 10 from the relays.

<doc id="914771" wikidata="Q83756" url="?curid=914771" title="Wes Brown">
<text>Wesley Michael Brown (born 13 October 1979) is an English former professional footballer who played as a centre back or right back. He spent the majority of his career at Manchester United, where he won 13 trophies including five Premier League titles and two UEFA Champions Leagues.

Brown began his career with Manchester United by joining the club&#x27;s academy at the age of 12 in 1992. After turning professional in 1996, he made his senior debut in 1998 and became a semi regular first team player during the 1998–99 season, when the club won the Treble. After a year-long hiatus due to injury, Brown became a regular fixture in the first team from 2000 onwards. Over the next eight years, he won numerous honours, including four more Premier League titles and another Champions League. Former Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson has stated that Brown is &quot;without question the best natural defender this club has had for years&quot;. After 15 years with Manchester United, Brown was allowed to leave for Sunderland, where he spent five years and helped them reach the 2014 League Cup final.

Brown earned his first England cap in 1999 and was selected to play at the 2002 World Cup. He played in the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifiers but England failed to progress to the final tournament. He scored his first international goal in 2008 against the Czech Republic. Brown announced his retirement from international football on 8 August 2010, just a day after being recalled to the England squad by Fabio Capello.

==Club career==

===Manchester United===
Born in Longsight, Manchester, Brown began his football career as a schoolboy playing for the Burnage High School and Fletcher Moss Rangers, a Greater Manchester youth side, and was a former student of the Lilleshall Hall FA School of Excellence, as well as spending time at United&#x27;s football Academy, which he joined at the age of 12. Brown showed talent and maturity at an early age, signing full professional terms with boyhood club Manchester United on 4 November 1996 at the age of 17.

Brown went on to success with the reserve and youth sides, winning the FA Youth Cup and a Lancashire Division One medal with the reserves. He also added two Jimmy Murphy (Young Player of the Year) awards to his collection, becoming only the second player to receive the award for a second time (the other being Ryan Giggs).

On 4 May 1998, Brown made his first team FA Premier League debut against Leeds United, coming on as a substitute. His breakthrough would occur the next year, the 1998–99 season, where he made several first-team appearances at right-back as well as his more natural position of centre-back. United completed the treble that season, winning the Premier League, FA Cup and UEFA Champions League.

Brown suffered the first of what would be a string of injuries while training for the 1999–2000 campaign. As a result, he did not play a single competitive game all season, while United went on to seal their sixth Premier League title in eight seasons.

His strong comeback the following year prompted praise from all corners, with club manager Sir Alex Ferguson making waves by proclaiming Brown to be Manchester United&#x27;s most talented defender.
A fine 2000–01 campaign was followed by another solid year in 2001–02. His reputation grew even greater during the 2002–03 season, but again, his performances were marred by injury. Brown tore a knee ligament on the final day of the season, and did not return until midway through the 2003–04 season. Brown finished the season in good form, notably giving an imperious, man of the match-winning performance in the FA Cup semi-final win over Arsenal. It was after this fine display that Ferguson re-iterated his confidence in Brown&#x27;s abilities.

Brown was a member of the side that won the FA Cup that year, against Millwall in Cardiff, and later went on to collect runners-up medals in the 2005 and 2007 finals.

The signing of Nemanja Vidić in January 2006, who would go on to forge a highly successful partnership with Rio Ferdinand, along with Brown&#x27;s continuing injury problems, meant the defender continued to struggle to hold down a place in United&#x27;s starting line-up. In the 2007–08 season, however, Brown established himself as the club&#x27;s first-choice right-back. He ended the season by assisting Cristiano Ronaldo&#x27;s goal in the 2008 Champions League final, which United eventually won on penalty kicks to complete a league and European double.
After nearly three years without scoring a Premier League goal for United, Brown scored on 23 March 2008 against Liverpool, the first in a 3–0 win.

After initially rejecting a new contract offer in December 2007, Brown signed a new five-year contract along with fellow defender Rio Ferdinand and midfielder Michael Carrick in April 2008, which was to keep him at Old Trafford until 2013.

On 4 October 2008, Brown scored only the fourth goal of his Manchester United career when he headed in Wayne Rooney&#x27;s cross in United&#x27;s 2–0 win away to Blackburn Rovers. The goal was controversial, however, as Blackburn&#x27;s players believed that Nemanja Vidić had impeded their goalkeeper, Jason Brown, allowing Brown to head in at the far post.

Brown was ruled out of first team action for around five weeks in November 2008, following an exploratory ankle operation. Brown made his first start in eight months away against Hull City on 24 May 2009.

Brown started the following season, featuring throughout August in the league, but between September and October only appeared in United&#x27;s League Cup campaign, before injury to both Rio Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidić saw Brown return to Premier League action as he partnered Jonny Evans in central defence against Blackburn, and both men produced an assured and professional display. This was Brown&#x27;s first Premier League start since the 2–1 victory against Arsenal, at the end of August.

Brown captained the League Cup game against Wolverhampton Wanderers in which they won 3–2. On 19 February, he scored his first FA Cup goal in Manchester United&#x27;s 1–0 win over Crawley Town. He also captained United again in the Crawley match.

===Sunderland===
Brown joined Sunderland on 7 July 2011 on a four-year contract for an undisclosed fee. Brown made his debut on the opening day of the season at Liverpool, where he was awarded man of the match as Sunderland drew 1–1. On 5 November 2011, Brown scored an own goal in a match against his former club, Manchester United. Brown&#x27;s first goal for Sunderland came on 21 December 2011, when he scored the winning goal with two minutes remaining in a 3–2 victory away to Queens Park Rangers. Brown&#x27;s season ended through injury in the FA Cup fourth-round tie with Middlesbrough in January 2012.

He made his Premier League comeback on 2 November 2013 in a 1–0 defeat against Hull. On 23 November 2013, Brown was sent off during a 2–0 defeat against Stoke City, a decision that was overturned on appeal on 26 November 2013. Brown was sent off again on 21 December 2013, in a 0–0 draw against Norwich City. Brown was given his third red card of the season in the fourth minute of Sunderland&#x27;s 2–0 defeat to Hull City.

On 28 February 2015, Brown was sent off during a match against Manchester United, which Sunderland lost 2–0, though it was John O&#x27;Shea who actually committed the foul. Referee Roger East insisted he got the decision right. The red card was later rescinded after Sunderland won an appeal.

At the end of the 2014–15 season, Brown was named as one of several Sunderland players available on a free transfer at the end of his contract in June 2015. On 12 June 2015, however, manager Dick Advocaat signed Brown to a one-year contract extension.

===Blackburn Rovers===
On 21 September 2016, following a number of injury set-backs and three-and-a-half months training with the club to regain fitness, Brown signed a short-term contract with Blackburn Rovers, lasting until the end of the season. As part of the deal, Brown would also take up a coaching role with the club&#x27;s development squad, a team for which he had played a number of games while regaining fitness. He worked alongside existing coaches Damien Johnson and David Dunn and offered guidance and advice to the club&#x27;s younger players. He made his debut and scored his first goal for Blackburn against Reading on 17 December 2016.

===Kerala Blasters===
Brown reunited with former Manchester United coach René Meulensteen in August 2017, joining Meulensteen at Indian Super League club Kerala Blasters.

==Coaching career==
Brown was part of the Blackburn Rovers Under-23s and Academy coaching setup during his time with the club. He holds the UEFA &#x27;A&#x27; Licence, which he achieved with the Irish Football Association.

==International career==
Brown has represented England at international level, making 23 appearances since debuting in 1999. He was notably part of the England squad at the 2002 FIFA World Cup in Japan and South Korea.

Brown made his debut in 1999 against Hungary and booked a place in Sven-Göran Eriksson&#x27;s squad for the 2002 World Cup, although he spent his time on the bench.

Brown performed consistently well in the 2005–06 season which led to his recall to the England squad for the friendly game against Uruguay. Although he played no part in this fixture, he hoped to make it into the final England squad for the 2006 World Cup, though he was ultimately not selected.

He was once again recalled to the England squad by coach Steve McClaren, and played in a defeat of Andorra in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying on 2 September, partnering John Terry at the heart of the England defence in place of injured Manchester United teammate Rio Ferdinand. He replaced Terry in a friendly against Brazil on 1 June 2007, but he slipped up with his first touch of the ball and nearly scored an own goal.

===Fabio Capello era===
Fabio Capello named Brown as a starter in both of his first two games in charge of the national team, against Switzerland and France. He also played 56 minutes in England&#x27;s 2–0 win over the United States on 28 May 2008.

Brown scored his sole senior international goal in a friendly against the Czech Republic on 20 August 2008 at Wembley Stadium, heading in a David Beckham corner in the 45th minute.

Brown made three appearances for England in their qualification for the 2010 World Cup in wins over Croatia (4–1), Kazakhstan (5–1) and Belarus (3–1).

Brown was called up for the England squad to face Slovenia in a friendly match on 5 September 2009, but was an unused substitute. He was then called up for a friendly against Brazil to be played Khalifa International Stadium in Qatar, where he played the full 90 minutes.

Brown also played in England&#x27;s 3–1 win over Egypt on 3 March 2010. He did not, however, make the England squad for the 2010 World Cup in South Africa after an injury-hit season.

Brown retired from international football on 8 August 2010, one day after being selected for a friendly against Hungary.

==Personal life==
Brown was married to Leanne Wassell, with whom he has three daughters. They broke up in 2022 His father, Bancroft Brown, died in February 2008. His half-sister, Claire Fallows, died on 19 July 2008 during pregnancy. Brown&#x27;s younger brother, Reece, played for Bury having joined the Manchester United Academy at the age of nine, also plays at centre-back and is an England under-20 international. Another brother, Clive, was on the books of Manchester City as a youth player in the late 1990s, before going on to play for Hyde United, Bangor City, Mossley, Woodley Sports and currently plays for New Mills.

He was declared bankrupt on 12 April 2023.

<doc id="914772" wikidata="Q5158442" url="?curid=914772" title="Conceptual semantics">
<text>Conceptual semantics is a framework for semantic analysis developed mainly by Ray Jackendoff in 1976. Its aim is to provide a characterization of the conceptual elements by which a person understands words and sentences, and thus to provide &quot;an explanatory semantic representation&quot; (title of a Jackendoff 1976 paper). &quot;Explanatory&quot; in this sense refers to the ability of a given linguistic theory to describe how a component of language is acquired by a child (as proposed by Noam Chomsky; see Levels of adequacy).

Recently, conceptual semantics in particular, and lexical semantics in general, have taken on increasing importance in linguistics and psycholinguistics. Many contemporary theories of syntax (how sentences are constructed from individual words) rely on elements that are idiosyncratic to words themselves. As a result, a sound theory accounting for the properties of the meanings of words is required.

==Meaning and decomposition==

Jackendoff has claimed that the goal of conceptual semantics is to investigate:

Conceptual semantics distinguishes a single, universal meaning to a word. Instead of having a lexical semantic meaning in addition to the conceptual representation of the actual referent, here the two are combined into what Jackendoff calls &quot;lexical concepts&quot; (Murphy 2010:59). Conceptual semantics is considered to be not just a linguistic theory, but a theory on human cognition. As do many semantic theories, Jackendoff claims that a decompositional method is necessary to explore conceptualization. Just as one of the ways a physical scientist tries to understand matter is by breaking it down into progressively smaller parts, so a scientific study of conceptualization proceeds by breaking down, or decomposing, meanings into smaller parts. However, this decomposition cannot go on forever, for at some point, meanings can no longer be broken down.

This is the level of conceptual structure, the level of mental representations which encode the human understanding of the world, containing the primitive conceptual elements out of which meanings are built, plus their rules of combination. Conceptual semantics does not work with a mental dictionary, in the classical sense. There are no definitions attached to concepts and reference, only the idea of the concept or reference itself. Just as generative syntax posits a finite set of syntactic categories and rules for combining them, so, too, does Conceptual Semantics posit &#x27;a finite set of mental primitives and a finite set of principles of mental combination&#x27; governing their interaction (Jackendoff 1990: 9). Jackendoff refers to this set of primitives and the rules governing them as the &#x27;grammar of sentential concepts&#x27; (Jackendoff 1990: 9).

His starting point is a close analysis of the meanings of lexemes dedicated to bringing out parallelisms and contrasts which reveal the nature of the conceptual structures underlying them. Jackendoff considers the lexicon to be made of three parts: phonological, syntactic, and conceptual. These three aspects of a concept give a &quot;full picture of a word&quot; (Murphy 2010:60). What his method shows, he says, is that the psychological organization on which meaning rests &#x27;lies a very short distance below the surface of everyday lexical items –
and that progress can be made in exploring it&#x27; (1991: 44).
Jackendoff claims that a decompositional method is necessary to explore conceptual structure, in which the concepts underlying word
meaning are broken down into their smallest elements: conceptual primitives envisaged as the semantic equivalents of phonological features. Conceptual Semantics posits &#x27;a finite set of mental primitives and a finite set of principles of mental combination&#x27; governing their interaction. The conceptual structure of a lexical item is an element with zero or more open argument slots, which are filled by the syntactic complements of the lexical item.

== Semantic structures ==
Conceptual semantics breaks lexical concepts up into ontological categories: events, states, places, amounts, things, and property, to name a few. These ontological categories are called semantic primes, or semantic primitives. Jackendoff poses that any concept in the human brain can be expressed using these semantic primes. Conceptual semantics is compositional, in that the meanings of phrases, clauses, and sentences can be determined from the lexical concepts that make them up. (Murphy 2010:66)

==Problems==

Jackendoff&#x27;s system has been criticised for its highly abstract primitives, which linguists such as Wierzbicka (2007a, 2007b) and Goddard (1998, 2001) have called &quot;obscure&quot;. The main reason for this is because one requires special training to understand them, and they often must be translated into plain English to be communicated. Another criticism often raised against conceptual semantics is that it is arbitrary. In its current state, there are no clear procedures for determining when a primitive is justified. Another criticism Wierzbicka and Goddard have raised is that the theory was formulated around and applied only to English, though it claims to be universal.

Jackendoff responds to these criticisms by saying:

<text>Traffic Message Channel (TMC) is a technology for delivering traffic and travel information to motor vehicle drivers. It is digitally coded using the ALERT C or TPEG protocol into Radio Data System (RDS) carried via conventional FM radio broadcasts. It can also be transmitted on Digital Audio Broadcasting or satellite radio. TMC allows silent delivery of dynamic information suitable for reproduction or display in the user&#x27;s language without interrupting audio broadcast services. Both public and commercial services are operational in many countries. When data is integrated directly into a navigation system, traffic information can be used in the system&#x27;s route calculation.
== Development ==
Detailed technical proposals for an RDS-TMC broadcasting protocol were first developed in the European Community&#x27;s DRIVE programme research project RDS-ALERT, a partnership of the BBC, Philips, Blaupunkt, TRRL and CCETT led by Castle Rock Consultants (CRC). The main goal of the project was to develop and build consensus upon a draft standard for broadcasting RDS-TMC traffic messages in densely coded digital form.

An initial proposal for defining RDS-TMC data fields had been made to the European Conference of Ministers of Transport (ECMT) in Madrid, based on a scheme developed by CCETT and Philips in the Eureka-sponsored CARMINAT research project. This proposal required the use of at least two 104-bit RDS data groups for each message. Within these RDS Groups, 32 bits per group would be used for traffic data, giving a total traffic message length of 64 bits. A second proposal, by Bosch-Blaupunkt and the German Road Research Institute BASt, sought to use just a single RDS Group per traffic message. Then, in 1987, the CEC invited Castle Rock Consultants to lead a joint team that would take TMC development a stage further. CRC produced a proposal for a modified BASt/Blaupunkt single group message definition, which became known as the ALERT A coding scheme. Tests also continued at CCETT and BBC on the CARMINAT approach, which formed the basis of an alternative ALERT B coding proposal.

A major question addressed in the Alert A scheme was the total number of traffic event locations to be coded. Initial estimates suggested that, in Europe, a maximum of 65,000 significant junctions might be needed for the Federal Republic of Germany. An efficient coding system would require only 16 bits to code these, simply by numbering each intersection from 1 to 65535. Calculations for France, Britain and elsewhere suggested that around 30,000 to 40,000 locations should be enough for most European national or U.S. statewide systems. A standard 16-bit location code was, therefore, adopted for inter-urban networks. The Madrid proposal of 1987, by comparison, had required 33 bits to code problem location, with separate fields for road number, road class, area of the country, etc. These 33 bits gave a theoretical total of 8.5 billion location codes, most of which could never be used.

After consultation with ECMT, a combined approach was developed called the ALERT C Protocol that aimed to combine the best features of each approach. ALERT A and C replaced the CARMINAT message categories cause, effect and advice with a single 11-bit basic message code. This permits up to 2048 basic message phrases to be broadcast. The new ALERT protocols significantly increased the efficiency of message coding, shortening the basic message content from 18 to 11 bits. In conjunction with the revised location codes, which saved 17 of the 33 bits previously assigned, this allowed the great majority of traffic messages to be broadcast using a single TMC data sequence. In 1991, ECMT recommended moving forward with further testing of the protocols. The work continued with a larger consortium including Volvo and Ford Motor Company in the European Commission&#x27;s DRIVE II project ATT-ALERT.

== Operation ==
Each traffic incident is binary-encoded and sent as a TMC message. Each message consists of an event code, location code, expected incident duration, affected extent and other details.

The message contains a list of up to 2048 event phrases defined by 11 binary bits (of which 1402 were in use as of 2007) that can be translated by the receiver into the user&#x27;s language. Some phrases describe individual situations such as a crash, while others cover combinations of events such as construction causing long delays.

In Europe, location code tables are maintained on a national level. Those location tables are integrated in the maps provided by in-vehicle navigation system companies such as HERE Technologies and TomTom and by vehicle manufacturers such as Volvo. In other countries, such as the U.S. and Canada, private companies maintain the location tables and market TMC services commercially.

Sources of traffic information typically include police, traffic control centers, camera systems, traffic speed detectors, floating car data, winter driving reports and roadwork reports.

== Coordination ==
TMC-Forum, a non-profit organization whose members included service providers, receiver manufacturers, car manufacturers, map vendors, broadcasters (public and private), automobile clubs, and public authorities, was a forum to discuss traffic information related matters. It maintained the TMC-Standard (ISO 14819). On 11 November 2007, the TMC-Forum and the TPEG-Forum merged into the Traveller Information Services Association (TISA). TISA has taken over all of TMC-Forum&#x27;s activities and responsibilities.

== Functionality ==
RDS-TMC is a low-bandwidth system. Each RDS-TMC traffic message comprises 37 data bits sent at most 1–3 times per second, using a low capacity data channel primarily designed for FM radio station name identification and tuning. Compressing traffic incident descriptions in multiple languages into 16 bits for a location, 11 bits for an event description code, plus 3 bits for the event&#x27;s extent and a few extra bits for the duration/system management was necessary due to pre-existing constraints in the RDS standard. Almost all the other broadcast data bits were already assigned from each 104-bit RDS Group.

A major design challenge of RDS-TMC was to find a way of describing traffic event locations across an entire state or country. Such a system could not convey precise latitude-longitude data (available 25 years later using GPS in applications such as Waze). Instead, RDS-TMC relies on the use of location tables that point only to significant highway junctions. The precision of each traffic event&#x27;s location is low compared to that of modern smartphone devices. The user&#x27;s navigation system locates a driver to about 3 metres (10 feet), but only knows, for example, that a crash took place between Exit 3 and Exit 4, northbound on a particular motorway. This limitation requires that traffic events (accidents, congestion, burst water mains, faulty traffic lights, etc.) have to be superimposed onto maps by mapping the reported location to the TMC location table. If the nearest location table point lies at some distance from the exact position of the incident, then the report appears on a section of main road between two junctions instead of at its exact location. The limited precision can make a significant difference as to how navigation devices interpret the incident, potentially leading to an occasional poor route choice.

In the US and elsewhere, systems such as CARS (Condition Acquisition and Reporting System) can pinpoint event locations or their start and end points with one-metre precision. These real-time data are published in XML for access by companies such as Google and TomTom. These incident reports can be delivered to mobile phones and handheld devices in vehicles. However, major real-world traffic incidents usually spread from hundreds of metres up to many kilometres, once traffic backups have developed. On motorways and other major roads, there are typically few or no detours available between significant junctions, which are all included in the TMC location tables. Many traffic report locations are only approximate, and as queues grow, locations can change swiftly. So GPS-based systems are more &quot;precise&quot;, but are not necessarily more &quot;accurate&quot;.

== Security ==
In April 2007, two Italian security researchers presented research about RDS-TMC at the CanSecWest security conference. The presentation, entitled &quot;Unusual Car Navigation Tricks&quot;, raised the point that RDS-TMC is a wireless cleartext protocol and showed how to build a receiver and transmitter with inexpensive electronics capable of injecting false and potentially dangerous messages.

Detailed instructions and schematics were published in Issue No. 64 of &quot;Phrack&quot; hacking magazine.

The TMC Forum responded by stating that the effects of any &#x27;pirate&#x27; TMC broadcasts would be non-existent on users not on routes affected by fake obstruction messages and that such broadcasts would directly interfere with that country&#x27;s TMC carrier station, which would lead to criminal or civil liability. They stated that it was therefore unlikely that such activity would take place.

Actual RDS-TMC attacks have been known to occur, for instance in Belgium in 2019 where road users were warned of &quot;air raids on the E40 road&quot; in March and that &quot;firefights broke out on the E17&quot; in August
. Official government advice was to ignore these messages, local police services admitted that locating the source of the transmissions was going to be difficult and that – even though clearly communication laws were broken – arrests or convictions were unlikely.

==Devices and navigation programs==
An RDS-TMC receiver is a special FM radio tuner that can decode TMC data. Satellite TMC receivers use a dedicated data channel that is broadcast as part of much larger broadcast digital audio channels. TMC data is decoded by matching event and location codes against look-up tables of phrases and locations. The results can be translated into audio or visually displayed on a Sat nav device. The look-up tables must be implemented in a service-specific database mapped to geographic routes and intersections. As with the navigation systems themselves, periodic upgrades are needed as the road system changes. This provides opportunities for vendors to generate revenue.

The technical concepts of RDS-TMC originated about 30 years ago, initially by Blaupunkt and Philips. With European Commission funding, the BBC, Transport Research Laboratory and CCETT came together in a team led by Castle Rock Consultants to develop the standard. More recently, personal navigation devices (PND) have emerged as an alternative way to deliver traffic information via mobile devices employing GPS.

Automobile companies continue to roll out RDS-TMC products. One reason is that the use of mobile devices is attracting legislative attention due to concerns about driver distraction. Like car radios, in-vehicle navigation systems have not so far generated the same concerns and may continue to outsell handheld solutions.

Higher-end models of personal navigation assistants come with a built-in TMC receiver, and depending on the country, the service is available in Eclipse, Garmin, iPhone (Navigon), Navman, Navway, Mio, Pioneer, TomTom and Uniden navigation systems, as well as in Volvo, BMW and Ford Falcon navigation systems, among many others.

TMC adapters can extend mobile navigation systems with integrated GPS receivers with TMC functionality. They can include a bluetooth or USB connection. The adapter passes traffic messages to the navigation software for route calculations. The adapters generally include a connector for FM/TMC, an antenna (2,5mm phone jack or MCX jack 50 Ohm). Compatible navigation programs include AvMap, Destinator PN, Falk Navigator TMC Edition (special version for MyGuide Navigator 6500XL TMC Bundle), GoPal, iGO, Mireo, Navigon MN5, Route 66, and Sygic.

== Coverage ==
In some places, TMC coverage is smaller than that of the radio programme carrying the TMC service, therefore s exist. For example, in the US, one of the two TMC commercial services is run by Clear Channel Communications, whose 95 FM station urban markets typically have some level of traffic information service. Another is Sirius Satellite Radio, which covers all of North America, including sparsely-populated rural areas and near-empty deserts. Although vendors are beginning to make arrangements with information systems such as CARS, operated by state police and state departments of transportation, coverage is likely to remain sketchy in some states during the next few years.

== Operation worldwide ==

The following countries provide a TMC service:

=== Australia ===

Intelematics Australia broadcasts a national encrypted RDS-TMC service focused initially on urban Australia under the brand &#x27;SUNA Traffic Channel&#x27;. The service reaches around 85% of urban Australia, using commercial FM broadcasters in seven cities, as well as via XML for online and smartphone applications. The service is available on GPS navigation systems including Navman, Mio, Uniden, iPhone (Navigon &amp; Sygic), Eclipse, Pioneer, Alpine and Clarion. SUNA Traffic Channel is also available in Ford, Holden, Honda, Toyota, Nissan, Mercedes-Benz, and many other navigation systems. SUNA is currently the only source of comprehensive, metropolitan congestion monitoring content in Australia – proprietary technology interfaces to traffic light control systems. The SUNA broadcast service is fully compliant with both RDS and TMC. However, since the broadcast is encrypted it does not work on in-car GPS navigation systems that do not have a commercial arrangement with SUNA.

A public service was available in Sweden. Swedish Transport Administration, or Trafikverket, was responsible for the location tables. Version v2.3 contained about 17337 data points, and covered 1138000 km of the Sweden road network.

The public service has not been developed since 2009 when the government decided to stop distribution of end user services. The service ended in August 2022.

Sweden is divided into 8 broadcasting zones to avoid transmitting traffic information that is not useful at that location. They cover the European, national and major county highways. The service is broadcast on Sveriges Radio P3 radio station and covers 98 percent of Sweden.

Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) has an information page for Trafikverket RDS-TMC in Swedish.

=== Switzerland ===

A TMC service is available in Switzerland. The broadcaster is SRG SSR idée suisse or &quot;Swiss Broadcasting Corporation&quot; who transmits TMC on &quot;FM chain 1&quot; and &quot;FM chain 3&quot; all over Switzerland.

* In German speaking areas: Radio SRF 1 (G) / Radio SRF 3 (G) / La 1ère (F) / Rete Uno (I) partly
* In French speaking areas: La 1ère (F) / Couleur 3 (F) / Radio SRF 1 (G) / Rete Uno (I) partly
* In Italian speaking areas: Rete Uno (I) / Rete Tre (I) / Radio SRF 1 (G) / La 1ère (F)

Daughter company &quot;Viasuisse&quot; operates the service.

Location codes are the responsibility of the &quot;Swiss Federal Roads Authority FEDRO&quot; but &quot;B+S Ingenieur (Bundesamt für Strassen)&quot; distributes the location tables. Version 5.5 contains around 10,000 codes.

=== Taiwan ===

The Taiwanese police radio station and Ministry of Transportation and Communication (MOTC) both broadcast RDS-TMC traffic data. It is currently available for TomTom, Garmin, Panasonic, PaPaGo and Mio devices.

=== Turkey ===
Turkey has 3 RDS TMC services.
1: HERE (previously NAVTEQ) has the broadest RDS-TMC service in Turkey, covering the largest 11 cities in the country: Istanbul, Ankara, Adana, Bursa, Mersin, Izmir, Eskisehir, Antalya, Konya, Kayseri and Gaziantep. The service was launched in July 2012.
2: TMC service in Turkey has been published by Basarsoft and TrafficNav in 2012. RDS TMC is available only in the cities where the traffic congestions are a big problem for the people. Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Antalya, Bursa are the cities where broadcasting is being done. 
3: TMC service in Turkey was published by Be-Mobile and Infotech in 2012. The RDS TMC service is available in Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, Bursa and Antalya.
All 3 Turkish TMC services are paid services and users can have it in Navigation devices. Both PND and Automotive products are using TMC service in Turkey.

=== United Kingdom ===

The INRIX provides a commercial TMC service, iTMC in the United Kingdom. It is broadcast nationally on Classic FM and other commercial radio stations. The BBC Charter prohibits it from carrying a commercial service. ITIS provides traffic data on RDS-TMC to major automotive companies (BMW, Mercedes, Toyota, Ford, Renault, Jaguar Land Rover and others). The price of the service is included in the price of the car or navigation system.

This system uses Floating Vehicle Data, which include positional information from over 160,000 fleet vehicles fitted. The data is complemented by journalistic or &quot;Incident&quot; data provided by Trafficlink. Trafficlink is owned by ITIS and provides traffic and travel bulletins to BBC Radio and to over 95% of the UK commercial radio stations. Incident data includes road works, accidents and closures.

Trafficmaster, a Teletrac Navman brand, operated a national service using local and regional radio broadcaster Global Radio which provided reception across mainland Britain. This system used road-side infrastructure to measure vehicle travel time between sensors placed a few miles apart, and used number plate recognition technology. Data sources used by Teletrac Navman included Floating Vehicle data from fitted telematics devices, 8500 under-road inductance loops, over 1800 CCTV cameras, Congestion Zone charging cameras, Police control rooms plus a proprietary network of ANPR and IR sensors cameras across the road network. Teletrac Navman provided traffic data on RDS-TMC to major automotive OEM brands including VW, Audi, Skoda, Mazda, Chrysler, Honda, Seat and Vauxhall. Teletrac Navman also supplies the Department for Transport with historical traffic data for modelling purposes which is used by central and local governments and their sub-contractors when analyzing road network improvement opportunities. The Trafficmaster service via RDS-TMC was withdrawin at the end of March 2023.

Both services maintain their own location tables. The current location table version of ITIS is 5.1. The last location table version of Trafficmaster was 3.1.

=== United States and Canada ===

In the United States of America, XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio provide TMC service all over the US. Navteq provides traffic data to both providers. Navteq Traffic delivers traffic information and related advertising via RDS and HD signals to navigation devices nationwide. Navteq also provided traffic data sourced from sensors, probes and other technologies in 10+ countries as of December 2009. INRIX, Inc. fuses TMC data with real-time flow information from its crowd-sourced network of floating cars and mobile devices with information from other public and private sources to deliver real-time and predictive traffic information.

iHeartMedia and Tele Atlas have a TMC service called Total Traffic &amp; Weather Network (TTWN) (also iHeartMedia&#x27;s branding for traffic and weather reporting), using FM RDS in 77 US cities and three Canadian metropolitan areas. These services are both offered by subscription and were initially available to many in-car navigation units via an expansion module purchased separately.

The TomTom RDS-TMC Traffic Receiver acquires information through an FM signal broadcast by Clear Channel&#x27;s regional providers. By connecting a compatible TomTom navigation device to the RDS-TMC Traffic Receiver, users receive traffic information via the TMC connection. Traffic alerts appear in the traffic bar on the right side of the screen. Tapping the traffic bar reveals further information, such as accident or traffic delays. The RDS-TMC Traffic Receiver is compatible with the TomTom VIA series, GO 920, TomTom GO 720, TomTom ONE XL and TomTom ONE 3rd edition. It integrates RDS-TMC Traffic information with TomTom GO and ONE products.

In addition to these after-market services, six major motor manufacturers offer RDS-TMC as standard in their U.S. vehicles, including Volvo and BMW.

iBiquity HD Radio provides a TMC service based on RDS-TMC.

=== Other areas ===
In the Netherlands, a map of current and planned TMC service is available from the Traffic Message Channel.

In Luxembourg, no service is currently planned.

A location table for UAE v4.0 has been certified.

In Turkey, various location tables are available.

In China, investigations are ongoing to choose a technology for its traffic information system. The main candidates are the Japanese system VICS and the European &quot;TMC&quot;. A TMC Location table version 1.0 has already been certified. Following the advancement of 4G/5G and IoT, China is actively planning in using 5G to broadcast traffic message and Hong Kong is also in the path. Several consultations in ITIS and Electric Vehicle are proceeding in 2019.

In Serbia, an RDS-TMC system along A1 highway started in July 2019, however with limitations.

<text>The South Atlantic United States form one of the nine Census Bureau Divisions within the United States that are recognized by the United States Census Bureau. This region, U.S. Census Bureau Region 3, Division 5, corresponds to the South (states/areas that were geographically part of the Thirteen Colonies) with the addition of Florida.

==Terminology==
The name of the census division does not refer to the South Atlantic Ocean, but rather to its location along the Atlantic Coast of the United States. Farther north are the Census-defined Middle Atlantic and New England (or North Atlantic) states.

==Geography==
This division includes eight states and one district; Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington. This division is also a recognized geographical division used by the United States Geological Survey. All entities within the region apart from the District of Columbia and West Virginia border the North Atlantic Ocean.

Together with the East South Central States (Alabama, Kentucky, Mississippi and Tennessee) and the West South Central states (Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Texas), the South Atlantic states constitute the United States Census Bureau&#x27;s broader Census Bureau Region of the South (the other three regions being the Northeast, Midwest and West, all of which have two divisions).

==Demographics==

As of 2010, the South Atlantic states had a combined population of 61,774,970. The South Atlantic states region covers . With the exception of West Virginia, the region has seen rapid population growth and economic development in recent decades.



==Politics==
*Bold denotes election winner.
*&quot;Note&quot;: Election results for the Upper South Atlantic States (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia and Washington, D.C.) are included in the table of the Mid-Atlantic states article.

<text>The Islamic Republic of Iran Army Ground Forces (, &quot;Niru-yē Zamini-yē Artēš-ē Žomhūri-yē Ēslâmi-yē Irân&quot;), acronymed NEZAJA (, NEZEJA) are the ground forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army.

In Iran, it is also called &quot;Artesh,&quot; () which is Persian for &quot;army.&quot; In 2007, the regular Iranian Army was estimated to have 357,000 personnel (167,000 conscripts and 190,000 professionals) plus around 350,000 reservists for a total of 700,000 soldiers according to the CSIS. It is the 9th largest ground force in the world, the 9th largest armoured force globally and possesses the biggest Army Aviation fleet in the Middle East. Conscripts serve for 21 months and have professional military training.

Iran has two parallel land forces with some integration at the command level: the regular Artesh (Army), and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, also known as the Sepâh (IRGC).

==History==
===Antiquity===
A national army of sorts has existed in Iran since the establishment of the Persian Empire. National armies usually appeared throughout the country&#x27;s points of strength, while in times of weakness mercenaries and conscript armies were recruited temporarily from fiefdoms. The original core of full-time troops and imperial body guards were called the Immortals, these were established in 580 BC by Cyrus the Great. These were replaced by the Junishapur Shâhanshâh (King of Kings) in the Sassanid Dynasty after a period of disunity and chaos in the country. Following the Islamic invasion of Iran and eventual resurgence of Iranian dynasties a new full-time army was formed by the name of Qezelbash in the Safavid dynasty. 

===Qajar era===
The Qajar period saw several attempts to re-model the traditional Iranian military based on western models. These were met with limited success at the time.

&quot;In 1918 the Qajar armed forces consisted of four, separate, foreign-commanded military units. Several provincial and tribal forces could also be called on during an emergency, but their reliability was highly questionable. More often than not, provincial and tribal forces opposed the government&#x27;s centralisation efforts, particularly because Tehran was perceived to be under the dictate of foreign powers. Having foreign officers in commanding positions over Iranian troops added to these tribal and religious concerns.&quot;

&quot;Loyal, disciplined, and well trained, the most effective government unit was the 8,000-man Persian Cossack Brigade. It was created in 1879 and commanded by Russian Imperial Army officers until the 1917 Russian Revolution. After that date its command passed into Iranian hands, and the brigade represented the core of the new, Iranian armed forces. Swedish officers commanded the 8,400-man Gendarmerie, organised in 1911 as the first, internal security force. The 6,000-man South Persia Rifles was financed by Britain and commanded by British officers from its inception in 1916. Its primary task was to combat tribal forces allegedly stirred up by German agents during the First World War. The Qajar palace guard, the Nizam, commanded by a Swedish officer, was a force originally consisting of 2,000 men, although it deteriorated rapidly in numbers because of rivalries. Thus, during the First World War, the 24,400 troops in these four, separate, military units made up one of the weakest forces in Iranian history.&quot;

After the First World War, the army had shrunk, but not much on paper, ostentiably numbering 25,000 in total. By 1920 it consisted of the Persian Cossacks; the Gendarmerie, expanded from two regiments that had stayed loyal; and the South Persia Rifles and the regular army, reduced to the Central Brigade in Tehran, with a theoretical strength of 2,200.

===Pahlavi era===
Following the rise of the Pahlavi dynasty in 1925, the new Imperial Iranian Army became a priority. By 1941, it stood at 125,000 troops—five times its original size—and was considered well trained and well equipped. However, the army was focused on internal security operations, rather than, Farrokh says &#x27;fighting well-led and equipped Soviet and Western armies.&#x27; Ward writes that the &#x27;army&#x27;s sixteen divisions were spread across the country in their home garrisons, and only some of the western divisions had received any significant reinforcements of infantry and artillery. Maj. Gen. Hassan Mogaddam, the 5th Division commander, was put in charge of all western forces.&quot; The defence of the Khorramshahr-Ahvaz area was put under the navy&#x27;s Rear Admiral Gholamali Bayandor, with his sailors plus a brigade of the army&#x27;s 6th Division.

In August 1941 the Soviets and British launched the Anglo-Soviet invasion of Iran, which began on 25 August and lasted until 17 September. London and Moscow had insisted that the Shah expel Iran&#x27;s large German population and allow shipments of war supplies to cross the country en route to the Soviet Union. Both of these proved unacceptable to Reza Shah; he was sympathetic to Germany, and Iran had declared its neutrality in the Second World War. Iran&#x27;s location was so strategically important to the Allied war effort, however, that London and Moscow chose to violate Tehran&#x27;s neutrality. From the south came the British Paiforce, under the command of Lieutenant-General Edward Quinan. Paiforce was made up of the 8th and 10th Indian Infantry Divisions, plus three other brigades. Meanwhile, the Soviets invaded from the north. Three armies, the 44th, 47th and 53rd Armies of the Transcaucasian Front under General Dmitry Timofeyevich Kozlov, occupied Iran&#x27;s northern provinces.

Against the Allied forces, the army was overwhelmed in three days, while the fledgling Imperial Iranian Air Force and Imperial Iranian Navy suffered heavy damage. Conscripts deserted by the thousands. His institutional power base ruined, Reza Shah abdicated in favour of his young son, Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi. In the absence of a broad political power base and with a shattered army, Mohammad Reza Shah faced an almost impossible task of rebuilding. There was no popular sympathy for the army in view of the widespread and largely accurate perception that it was a brutal tool used to uphold a dictatorial regime. The young shah, distancing Tehran from the European military, in 1942, invited the United States to send a military mission to advise in the reorganisation effort. With American advice, emphasis was placed on quality rather than quantity.

The small but more confident army that resulted from American training was capable enough to participate in the 1946 campaign in Azarbaijan to put down a Soviet-inspired, separatist rebellion. During the three years of occupation, Stalin had expanded Soviet political influence in Azerbaijan and the Kurdish area in northwestern Iran. On 12 December 1945, after weeks of violent clashes, a Soviet-backed separatist People&#x27;s Republic of Azerbaijan was founded. The Kurdish People&#x27;s Republic was also established in late 1945. Iranian troops sent to re-establish control were blocked by Soviet Red Army units. When the deadline for withdrawal arrived on 2 March 1946, six months after the end of hostilities, the British began to withdraw, but Moscow refused, &quot;citing threats to Soviet security,&quot; sparking the Iran crisis of 1946. Soviet troops did not withdraw from Iran proper until May 1946, following Iran&#x27;s official complaint to the newly formed United Nations Security Council and intense pressure from the United States.

Unlike its 1925 counterpart, the 1946 Majlis was suspicious of the shah&#x27;s plans for a strong army. Many members of the parliament feared that the army would once again be used as a source of political power. To curtail the shah&#x27;s potential domination of the country, they limited his military budgets.

From the 1966-67 edition to the 1969-70 edition, the IISS Military Balance listed the Iranian Army with one armoured division, seven infantry divisions, and one independent armoured brigade. By the 1971-72 edition, two armoured divisions, five infantry divisions, the independent armoured brigade, and other independent brigades were listed. Within two years after that, the listing quickly changed to three armoured divisions and three infantry divisions.

Dramatic reforms brought in a host of western advisors and over the course of more than three decades the army was to become the world&#x27;s fifth strongest by 1979. Throughout the 1970s the Imperial Iranian Ground Forces, as they were then known, underwent a rapid transformation and increase in strength. During this period, Iran established the &quot;Imperial Iranian Army Aviation&quot; (IIAA). It was mainly equipped with American aircraft types.

In the early 1970s the Sultan of Oman was fighting the Dhofar Rebellion with British support. As a result of Sultan Qaboos&#x27;s diplomatic initiatives, the Shah sent a brigade of troops numbering 1,200 and with its own helicopters to assist the Sultan&#x27;s Armed Forces in 1973. The Iranian brigade first secured the Salalah-Thumrait road. In 1974, the Iranian contribution was expanded into the Imperial Iranian Task Force, numbering 4,000. They attempted to establish another interdiction line, codenamed the &quot;Damavand Line&quot;, running from &quot;Manston&quot;, a few miles east of Sarfait, to the coast near the border with South Yemen (the PDRY). Heavy rebel opposition, which included artillery fire from within South Yemen, thwarted this aim for several months. Eventually, the town of Rahkyut, which the PFLO had long maintained as the capital of their liberated territory, fell to the Iranian task force. The IITF remained in Oman in December 1975, then at a strength of 3,000.

The Library of Congress Country Studies volume for Iran issued in 1978 wrote that:

&quot;During the 1970s ..the Imperial Iranian Ground Forces was undergoing a rapid increase in strength; that year [sic] it was a largely mechanized and armoured force of about 220,000. In late 1977 its former organization into three army corps, with headquarters in Kermanshah, Tehran, and Shiraz, was dropped; divisional commanders subsequently reported directly to the army commander. The army contained three armoured divisions, each with six tank battalions and five mechanised infantry battalions; four infantry divisions; four independent brigades (two infantry, one airborne and 1 special force); and the Army Aviation Command (one infantry division and one independent infantry brigade formed the Imperial Guard). These combat units.. were said to be 85 per cent operational, though some outside observers doubted this claim.
During the mid-1970s, fully 80 per cent of Iran&#x27;s ground forces were deployed along the Iraqi border, though official sources maintained that a large portion could be sent anywhere in the country.. by means of air force transports. Troop deployment was expected to shift south in the late 1970s with the opening of the Chah Bahar facility.&quot;

&quot;The rapidly growing Army Aviation Command, whose major operational facilities were located at Isfahan, was largely equipped with American aircraft, though some helicopters were of Italian manufacture. In 1977 army aviation operated some sixty light fixed-wing aircraft, though its strength lay in its fleet of some 700 combat helicopters.&quot;

Two years later, Gabriel listed the major formations of the Imperial Iranian Ground Forces in the final year of the Shah, 1979, as including the 16th (Hamadan), 81st, 88th (Zahedan/Chah Bahar), and 92nd Armored Divisions. Other data suggests one division was being organised in Sistan Baluchestan, presumably the 88th Armoured Division. He also listed three infantry divisions, the 2nd in Tehran, the 28th Infantry Division at Sanandaj, and the 77th Infantry Division at Mashad; two infantry brigades (the 64th at Mahabad and the 84th at Khorramabad), the 55th Airborne Brigade at Shiraz and the Special Forces Brigade HQ in Tehran.

===Islamic Republic of Iran===
Immediately after the 1979 revolution a series of purges gutted the core of the army&#x27;s Western trained senior commanders. These included numerous executions ordered by Sadegh Khalkhali, the new Revolutionary Court judge. Between February and September 1979, Iran&#x27;s government executed 85 senior generals and forced all major-generals and most brigadier-generals into early retirement. By September 1980, the government had purged 12,000 army officers. These purges resulted in a drastic decline in the Iranian military&#x27;s operational capacities. Their regular army (which, in 1978, was considered the world&#x27;s fifth most powerful) had been badly weakened. A shortage of spare parts for Iran&#x27;s U.S.-made and British-made equipment began to cripple Iran&#x27;s military forces. The desertion rate reached 60%, and the officer corps was devastated. The most highly skilled soldiers and aviators were exiled, imprisoned, or executed.

The last general to head the Imperial Iranian Army was General Gholam Ali Oveissi, who was assassinated in Paris along with his brother in 1984. He was replaced by General Abbas Gharebaghi, as armed forces chief of staff, who allied with the Islamic Republic and dismantled the Imperial Iranian Army, which was renamed the Islamic Republic of Iran Army.

The two Iranian Imperial Guard divisions were combined into the 21st Infantry Division.

The purges left the Army poorly prepared when Iraq invaded Iran at the beginning of the Iran–Iraq War. A Central Intelligence Agency assessment of 7 November 1979 said that Iranian military capabilities &#x27;..had not recovered significantly since the collapse of the armed forces in the February revolution. Ground forces capabilities remain limited despite some improvement in discipline and operational readiness in recent months.&#x27;

====Iran–Iraq War====

Iraq invaded Iran, beginning the Iran–Iraq War, on 22 September 1980. Throughout the war, Iran never managed to fully recover from the post-revolutionary flight of military personnel. Continuous sanctions prevented Iran from acquiring many heavy weapons, such as tanks and aircraft. When the invasion occurred, many pilots and officers were released from prison, or had their executions commuted to combat the Iraqis. In addition, many junior officers were promoted to generals, resulting in the army being more integrated as a part of the regime by the war&#x27;s end, as it is today. Iran still had at least 1,000 operational tanks, and could cannibalize equipment to procure spare parts.

From July 1985, the IISS started attributing an estimated three army headquarters to the Iranian Army where previously no headquarters above division level has been identified. These were identified by other sources later as the 1st Army (HQ Kermanshah), 2nd Army (HQ Tehran) and 3rd Army (HQ Shiraz).

In 1987, and on the verge of the end of the Iran–Iraq War, the Artesh was organised as follows:
* Three mechanised divisions,
** Each of which composed of three armoured and six mechanised battalions organised into three brigades
* Seven infantry divisions (seemingly including the 21st, 64th and 77th Infantry Divisions),
* One special forces division composed of four brigades,
* One airborne brigade (55th Airborne Brigade?)
* One air support command,

and some independent armoured brigades including infantry and a &quot;coastal force.&quot;

The war finally ended in 1988.

====Post Iran–Iraq War====
A new cadre of commanders, shaped by their experiences in the war, drastically reduced reliance on foreign supplied equipment and training. Following the war the military pursued a dramatic restructuring, much of it under total secrecy. While still only a mere shadow of its pre-revolutionary self, the Artesh rapidly re-asserted its abilities and started to grow again.

The IISS determined that at some point between 1992 and 1995 an additional army headquarters was raised (making a total of four). Later, some time between mid-1997 and mid-1999, the listing changed to that of four corps. The Jaffee Center&#x27;s Middle East Military Balance 99-00 also lists the four corps the IISS had attributed.

Jane&#x27;s reported in 2006 that the Army was commanded via three army level headquarters with 15 divisions. The IISS reported in the Military Balance 2008 that there 12 Corps level regional headquarters, five armoured divisions with some independent brigades, seven infantry divisions with some independent brigades, one special forces brigade, two commando divisions with some independent brigades, plus an airborne brigade. There were also six artillery groups, and aviation forces. The number of divisions reported has not changed for some years. Often reported formations include the 23rd Special Forces Division, established in 1993–94, and the 55th Paratroop Division. &quot;Jane&#x27;s Sentinel Security Assessments&quot; reports that the 23rd Special Forces Division is amongst the most professional formations in the Iranian Army, with at least 6,000 personnel, all of whom are believed to be regulars.

The regular armoured divisions, including the 92nd Armored Division, are sub-divided into three brigades.

==Structure== 
=== 2012 ===

Globalsecurity.org says on its page on the Iranian Army:

* &quot;The regular army.. has a number of independent brigades and groups, though there is almost no reliable data on the size and number of these smaller independent formations. These include one logistics brigade, an infantry brigade, an airborne brigade, special forces (Takavar) brigades, and five artillery brigades/regiments. There are also coastal defence units, a growing number of air defence groups, between four and six army aviation units, and a growing number of logistics and supply formations.&quot;
* &quot;There are a variety of other reports of doubtful veracity. Some sources claim that small light formations in the regular army include an Airmobile Forces Group created after the Iran–Iraq War. This formation is said to include the 29th Special Forces Division, which was formed in 1993-1994, and the 55th Paratroop Division. Other sources claim that the commando forces of the regular army and IRGC are integrated into a Corps of about 30,000 soldiers, with integrated helicopter lift and air assault capabilities. These airborne and special forces troops are said to train together at Shiraz.&quot;

Many of these assessments appear to be copyright violations from research conducted by the Burke Chair in Strategy at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Washington DC, for example, an updated military balance report dated 2012.(see also CSIS Iran and Gulf Military Balance, 11 July 2012, p51

Most soldiers of the Iranian Army are well trained and determined, but their equipment is outdated or obsolete. They primarily use outdated Western-style equipment or newer, locally produced equipment, which is lower quality. Commanders generally appoint men to high level positions based on loyalty, rather than military skills.

Since 2010 Iranian Army has undergone a reorganization process called Thamen alaeme general structure plan (طرح جامع ساختاری ثامن الائمه), this plan includes transformation from a division-centered model towards a brigade-centered model, a re-positioning of Army bases, the adding of new units and an increase in mobility of existing army units. To that effect, it has sheered off some brigades from existing divisions as well as establishing new brigades alongside of them. By March 2012 31 new independent brigades have been established throughout the army.

The commander of the Iranian Army&#x27;s Ground Forces is Brigadier General Kioumars Heydari.

==Iranian Army commissioned officers and enlisted ranks==

;Officers
;Enlisted
==Equipment==

Iran&#x27;s main battle tanks include an estimated ~1500 or possibly more, indigenous Zulfiqar MBTs, 480 T-72S, 150 M-60A1s, 75 T-62s, 100 Chieftain Mk 3/Mk 5 MBTs, 540 T-54/T-55/Type 59s, and 150 M-47/M-48s. Separately reported are Karrar tanks.

The Zulfiqar is the defence industry of Iran&#x27;s most recent main battle tank, named after the twin-pointed legendary sword of Ali. Born as the brainchild of Brigadier General Mir-Younes Masoumzadeh, deputy ground force commander for research and self-sufficiency of the armed forces, the vehicle has been developed from major components of the American M-60 tank. One of the features which has drawn the attention of the Defense Ministry is that indigenously-made parts have been used in it. The prototypes of the tank were tested in 1993. Six semi-industrial prototypes were produced and tested in 1997. The IISS estimates that around 150 Zulfiqar 1&#x27;s are now in service.

The main attack helicopter of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army is the AH-1J Sea Cobra. The number of AH-1Js in service was estimated by the IISS in 2009 as 50, though 202 were delivered before the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Iran also operates an unknown number of the Panha 2091, which is an unlicensed, locally-made upgrade of the AH-1J.

The main transport helicopter of the Islamic Republic of Iran Army is the CH-47C Chinook. The number of CH-47Cs in service was estimated as 20 though 57 were delivered before the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Islamic Republic of Iran Army lost one of them in 2011.

<text>Adelaide railway station is the central terminus of the Adelaide Metro railway system. All lines approach the station from the west, and it is a terminal station with no through lines, with most of the traffic on the metropolitan network either departing or terminating here. It has nine below-ground platforms, all using broad gauge track. The station is located on the north side of North Terrace, west of Parliament House.

The Adelaide Casino occupies the majority of the station building, which no longer houses railway administrators. Until 1984, Adelaide station was also the terminus for regional and interstate passenger trains, but regional passenger train services ceased to exist in South Australia and all interstate services are handled at Adelaide Parklands Terminal.

==History==

===Early growth===

Adelaide&#x27;s first railway station opened on the current North Terrace site in 1856. It served the broad gauge line between Adelaide and Port Adelaide, which was the first government-owned and operated steam railway in the British Empire. The first passenger train departed from Adelaide station on 19 April 1856, carrying the Governor of South Australia and various dignitaries to a celebratory lunch at Port Adelaide. The original Adelaide station handled all passenger, freight and livestock traffic at the North Terrace site. Livestock was unloaded adjacent to the markets and abattoirs, which were opposite the Newmarket Hotel, on the corner of West Terrace. Workshops also occupied the site. By 1865, the station precinct had become crowded, covering an area of only . In 1883, the workshops were replaced by new premises at Islington, to the north.

The Port line opened for public service on 21 April 1856. It was single track, with intermediate stations at Bowden, Woodville and Alberton and terminated at the original Port Dock station (1856-1981). There were six trains per day in each direction, and two on Sundays. A second line opened to Smithfield (near Gawler) on 1 June 1857, the predecessor of today&#x27;s Gawler line. This diverged from the Port line at a junction in the north parklands, and was extended to Kapunda in 1860, and Burra by 1870, both important copper mining towns in the early days of the colony.

The next line into the station was built by the Holdfast Bay Railway Company and opened on 24 May 1880. This branched off the main line where today&#x27;s Belair and Seaford lines separate from the Outer Harbor and Gawler lines. It ran via Mile End and Plympton to Glenelg, and should not be confused with the other railway from South Terrace to Glenelg, which later became the Glenelg tram line. To cope with increasing traffic, interlocked signals and points were installed in 1875, and the Port line was upgraded to double track in 1881.

The South line through the Adelaide Hills was opened to Aldgate on 14 March 1883, and extended to Nairne (November 1883) and Bordertown (May 1886). The first through train between Adelaide and Melbourne, the &quot;Intercolonial Express&quot;, ran on 19 January 1887, and was the first intercapital rail journey in Australia without a change of trains at a break-of-gauge station.

===Early 20th century===

With the basic framework of lines in place, the South Australian Railways continued building branch lines to promote settlement and agricultural development of the state&#x27;s hinterland. Most of this expansion was complete by the early years of the 20th century and the resulting increase in traffic caused troublesome congestion in the vicinity of Adelaide station. In an attempt to cope with this, the original 1856 station buildings were demolished and replaced in 1900.

The South line was double tracked as far as Mitcham in 1908, and suburban trains ran to a new terminus at Clapham. The first section of the route that became the Seaford line opened from Goodwood Junction to Marino in 1913, and further extended to Willunga by 1918, this forming the Willunga line. On the north side of the city, a separate pair of tracks was built from the junction of the Port and North lines in the parklands through to Adelaide station yard, including a new bridge across the River Torrens.

In 1912, Mile End Goods Yard and engine sheds opened, and the Gaol Loop was built to allow freight trains to access the new yards at Mile End, bypassing Adelaide station. At the same time the livestock markets and abattoirs were relocated to Pooraka in the north of the metropolitan area, still countryside at the time. This allowed the area immediately around Adelaide station to concentrate on passenger and parcels traffic, and the old goods shed was then converted into a platform for Glenelg line trains. Adelaide station yard was also re-signalled in July 1915, using American-style three-position semaphore signals. This was the first installation of an electric signalling system in South Australia and was subsequently extended along the main lines of the South Australian Railways.

===Webb era===

The period from 1922 to 1930 was known as the Webb era on South Australian Railways. Under the leadership of a new Railways Commissioner, William Alfred Webb, South Australian Railways began a massive rehabilitation programme. Worn-out infrastructure, under-powered steam locomotives, undersized rolling stock and outdated operating systems were all modernised and upgraded along essentially American lines.

Among the many improvements that Webb championed, two of the best remembered are the introduction of new powerful steam locomotives and the rebuilding of Adelaide station. Nineteen designs were submitted and considered for the new station. The winner was a design proposed by local architecture firm Garlick &amp; Jackson. The initial plan had forward-thinking provisions for extra platforms (which were never built) to serve Commonwealth Railways trains, on the assumption that its standard gauge line would be extended from Port Augusta and Port Pirie into Adelaide. The foundation stone of the new station building was laid on 24 August 1926, and the building was completed in 1928.

The new station comprised a massive sandstone building in neo-classical style. The upper three storeys housed the railways administration, which had previously been scattered in various buildings around the city. The concourse had many facilities to cater for long distance travellers as well as daily commuters - a dining room, hairdressers, and refreshment rooms. Of particular note was the enormous domed Marble Hall, which served as a grand and dignified main waiting room, and is now incorporated into the Adelaide Casino. The new station had 13 platforms, each covered by an individual canopy to alleviate the problems of smoke and fumes previously endured with an overall roof. The cost of the rebuilding greatly exceeded the original budget and the project became a source of great controversy within South Australia as the state came close to bankruptcy with the onset of the Great Depression.

===Post World War II===
Patronage of country rail services declined through the 1950s and 60s as car ownership became more widespread. However, much of rural South Australia still retained daily passenger trains. Many of these services were operated by air-conditioned Bluebird Railcars, which had been introduced by the South Australian Railways from 1954 onwards. The following destinations were served from Adelaide in 1965:
*Bute / Kadina / Wallaroo / Moonta
*Port Pirie Junction (connection with Commonwealth Railways&#x27; Trans-Australian Railway line to Kalgoorlie)
*Hamley Bridge / Balaklava
*Blyth / Gladstone / Wilmington
*Riverton / Burra / Terowie (connection to Peterborough &amp; Broken Hill)
*Kapunda / Eudunda / Robertstown
*Nuriootpa / Angaston / Truro
*Murray Bridge / Tailem Bend / Barmera / Loxton / Waikerie
*&quot;The Overland&quot; to Melbourne
*Naracoorte / Mount Gambier / Kingston SE
*Mount Barker / Strathalbyn / Victor Harbor / Milang
*Morphett Vale / McLaren Vale / Willunga
In March 1978, South Australia Railways was divided between two owners. The federal government owned Australian National (AN) took over ownership and operation of all country lines outside the Adelaide metropolitan area. The State Government owned State Transport Authority (STA) retained the suburban routes around Adelaide, including ownership and operation of Adelaide station. AN&#x27;s longer distance trains continued to arrive and depart from Adelaide station for several years, paying an access charge to the STA, until AN&#x27;s new Keswick Passenger Terminal (now known as Adelaide Parklands Terminal) opened on 18 May 1984, a kilometre or two west of the Adelaide city centre in an industrial suburb. Adelaide station is now served only by suburban trains.

===Renewal===
The years 1985 to 1987 saw the biggest change at Adelaide station since the rebuilding of the 1920s. The Adelaide Station and Environs Redevelopment (ASER) project involved:
*Refurbishment of much of the exterior of the heritage-listed station building and conversion of the interior to a casino (the main building had become underutilised as railway operations shrank and AN relocated its headquarters to Keswick).
*Construction of the Hyatt Regency hotel (now the InterContinental Adelaide) over the eastern part of the station site adjacent to the station building.
*Construction of the original Adelaide Convention Centre and the Riverside Centre office block over the central part of the station site.
*Construction of the Exhibition Hall (today Convention Centre Halls I, J, K) and basement carpark in place of the original Platforms 1-2.
*Partial relocation and reduction of platforms; Platforms 1-2 and 12-13 were demolished while 9 to 11 were rebuilt 80 metres (260 ft) shorter. The remaining Platforms 3 to 11 were renumbered, becoming Platforms 1 to 9.

The remaining platforms became partially underground and a special extraction system was needed to remove the exhaust fumes from the diesel railcars. Later expansion of the Adelaide Convention Centre fully enclosed the platforms beneath the centre&#x27;s Central Building (opened 2001).

The track layout in the station yard was modified and resignalled in 1987/88, and operation of points and signals transferred to a new control centre overlooking the railcar depot and station. This resignalling resulted in closure of the two signal cabins that controlled movements in the station area; Adelaide Station Cabin (near Morphett Street bridge) was demolished, but the heritage-listed Wye Cabin today sits derelict at the divergence of the South and Port/North lines.

Adelaide&#x27;s main railcar depot was located just outside the station at North Terrace. In 2008 it was announced that the depot would be moved to a new site at Dry Creek, freeing up the Adelaide site for the new Royal Adelaide Hospital. The Dry Creek depot opened in February 2011, and the City depot closed soon after. In January 2013, the station closed for a month-long shutdown in connection with the rail electrification of the Seaford railway line. A set of escalators was recently added to the southern entrance of the railway station and the adjoining staircase was refurbished, enabling the station to handle larger numbers of people. The train control centre was relocated to Dry Creek in 2018, from its former location adjacent to the old railcar depot.
On 28 February 2020, Renewal SA announced a revitalisation programme of the station building. In conjunction with the new northern entrance, the architectural features of the building would be restored and enhanced, the North Terrace frontage upgraded, and new food and retail tenancies added. Between August 2023 and January 2024, the pedestrian airbridge running over the concourse — constructed in the 1980s to provide a valet service between Adelaide Casino and the InterContinental, and obsolete since 2021 — was removed.

Woodgate began his career at Middlesbrough but moved to Leeds United at the age of sixteen. He was sold to Newcastle United for £9 million in 2003, where he impressed despite injury problems. His performances in Europe for Newcastle led to Real Madrid signing him for £13.4 million in 2004. Injuries blighted his time in Madrid, and throughout his career, and he failed to make a single appearance in the entire 2004–05 season. On his debut for Real Madrid, he scored an own goal and was sent off for two bookable offences.

He went on to play 14 times for them before joining his hometown club Middlesbrough on loan, then permanently for a fee of £7 million. He joined Tottenham Hotspur for £8 million in 2008. He scored the winning goal for Spurs in the League Cup final against Chelsea and went on to play 44 times in the 2008–09 season. After more injury problems, he only made four appearances in the next two seasons and was released in 2011 and signed a pay-as-you-play deal with Stoke City. He spent the 2011–12 season at Stoke and after his contract expired re-signed for Middlesbrough, remaining there until his retirement in 2016.

Following retirement, Woodgate took up various coaching roles at Middlesbrough until June 2019 when he was appointed manager of the club, following the departure of Tony Pulis. He remained in the role for just over a year before he was dismissed in June 2020. He joined the coaching staff at AFC Bournemouth on 1 February 2021 before being appointed as caretaker manager two days later, following the sacking of Jason Tindall. On 21 February, he was given the role until the end of the season, but left in June after failing to lead the club back to the Premier League via the playoffs.

==Club career==

===Leeds United===
Woodgate began his career at Middlesbrough but moved to Leeds United at the age of sixteen after disagreements over his future between Middlesbrough and his family. He helped Leeds to win the FA Youth Cup in 1997, and in October the following year made his debut for the senior side. Woodgate was a consistent and impressive performer for Leeds during his time there, competing with the likes of Rio Ferdinand, Lucas Radebe and Dominic Matteo for a starting place. He was regarded as one of the most complete all round players to come through the Leeds academy, and performed for Leeds in a time when they competed in the UEFA Cup, Champions League and regularly finished towards the top of the Premier League.
His number of appearances were heavily reduced due to picking up several injuries on different occasions. But as a result of Leeds&#x27; financial problems Woodgate was sold to Newcastle to raise some much needed funds. He was described as the club&#x27;s &#x27;jewel in the crown&#x27; and his sale caused anger for many Leeds United fans as Peter Ridsdale revealed the perilous financial situation at the club. The sale also led to the dismissal of Terry Venables who disagreed with Woodgate&#x27;s departure.

===Newcastle United===
Woodgate signed for Newcastle United in January 2003 for £9 million with add ons. He impressed and quickly became a fan favourite. One of his finest games came in Newcastle&#x27;s 2004 UEFA Cup semi final clash with Marseille, completely nullifying the threat of their forward line and clinical forward Didier Drogba. Unfortunately for Newcastle, a serious injury saw him end his final season early, and he could not feature in the second leg, where Newcastle were defeated 2–0 and knocked out.

===Real Madrid===
Woodgate signed for Real Madrid in August 2004 for a transfer fee of £13.4 million. This was to the surprise of many in the football world, due to his frequent absences through injury at his previous clubs, and indeed he was injured at the time of the transfer.

Woodgate did not make any appearances for Real Madrid in his first season in Spain, eventually making his debut on 22 September 2005, in a league match against Athletic Bilbao. The game did not go well for him, as he scored an own goal and was later sent off for a second bookable offence. He scored his only goal for Real Madrid by heading the equaliser in the 4–1 UEFA Champions League defeat of Rosenborg on 19 October, his first appearance for the club in European competition.

By February 2006, Woodgate had established himself as a first team player, with the other centre half position rotating among Sergio Ramos, Iván Helguera, Francisco Pavón and Álvaro Mejía. One Spanish newspaper even described him as having &quot;become Madrid&#x27;s true leader&quot;. However, further injury setbacks again stopped him playing. He was considered to have an outside chance of making the England squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but due to surgery on his back was not named in the squad.

In July 2007, Woodgate was voted the worst signing of the 21st century by users of the website of Spain&#x27;s leading sports daily, &quot;Marca&quot;, polling 37.11% of the votes cast.

===Middlesbrough===

On 30 August 2006, Woodgate signed a one-year loan move to hometown club Middlesbrough. He made his debut against Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium on 9 September. He was later voted man of the match by local radio station, Century FM. In April 2007, Middlesbrough announced Woodgate would be their first summer signing for a fee of £7 million. He signed a four-year contract, keeping him at the club until June 2011.

In October 2007, he was crowned North East Player of the Year by the Prince&#x27;s Trust, beating players from Newcastle and Sunderland. During the 2007–08 pre-season Woodgate suffered an injury that allowed fellow hometown defender David Wheater to start in his place during pre-season. Wheater&#x27;s form in pre-season earned him a place in the starting XI for the opening day Premier League fixture – Wheater&#x27;s form then continued which triggered the transfer of Woodgate to Tottenham Hotspur.

===Tottenham Hotspur===

After rejecting the chance to re-sign for Newcastle, Woodgate moved to Tottenham Hotspur for a reported fee of £8 million on 28 January 2008. He made his Tottenham debut against Everton two days later and scored his first Tottenham goal on 24 February 2008 which was a header in the League Cup final against Chelsea in extra-time to win Tottenham their first trophy since 1999. His performance won him the Man of the match award.
Woodgate scored his first Spurs league goal on 19 March 2008, coincidentally also against Chelsea, in a 4–4 draw at White Hart Lane. He first captained Tottenham in a 2–1 defeat at White Hart Lane to Aston Villa on 15 September. Following Harry Redknapp&#x27;s appointment, Woodgate became the second vice-captain, behind Robbie Keane.

On Spurs&#x27; disastrous start to the 2008–09 season, Woodgate told the press that it was worse than when Leeds were relegated. Woodgate had been transferred to Newcastle United some 16 months before Leeds&#x27;s eventual relegation at the end of 2003–04. Woodgate played just three times in Spurs highly successful 2009–10 campaign after succumbing to a long term groin injury. Harry Redknapp hinted at Woodgate&#x27;s exit due to having to comply with new Premier League rules which limited squad sizes to 25 – ironically these rules were put in place in order to help the careers of English and Welsh footballers. Woodgate travelled to Australia to have surgery.

On 19 January 2011, Woodgate played his first game in 14 months in a friendly match with QPR. The defender completed 45 minutes in a 9–2 victory at Spurs Lodge. Following this, on 15 February, a Champions League tie with Milan, he came on in the 59th minute for the injured Vedran Ćorluka. He played out the rest of the game; however, was later diagnosed with a strain to his left adductor muscle. Spurs were unsuccessful in persuading Woodgate to agree a pay-as-you-play deal, and he was released on 16 June 2011.

===Stoke City===
Woodgate signed a one-year contract on a pay-as-you-play deal with Stoke City on 11 July 2011, with a view of a further year on his contract, if he proved his fitness. Following his move to Stoke, Woodgate stated that he wanted to get his career back on track. He also revealed that he turned down a number of other contract offers from different clubs. He made his debut for Stoke in a pre-season friendly against Aldershot Town, playing for 62 minutes. He made his full debut for Stoke in a 1–0 win over Hajduk Split in the UEFA Europa League, playing the full 90 minutes. He then completed his first full 90 in the Premier League for Stoke in a 0–0 draw with Chelsea. Woodgate was left out of Stoke&#x27;s Europa League squad by manager Tony Pulis who feared a recurrence of Woodgate&#x27;s injuries if he spent too long travelling.
Despite a decent enough start to his Stoke career, Woodgate went on to have poor performances against Sunderland, Newcastle, and Bolton. He was dropped by Pulis and admitted that he needed to up his game. He failed to improve much, and in a match against Wolverhampton Wanderers Woodgate started the match at right back. He struggled against Matt Jarvis and gave away a penalty, then was substituted after twenty minutes by Pulis. He continued to play at right back though and admitted that his performances at Stoke had been &#x27;up and down&#x27;. His contract with Stoke expired on 30 June 2012 and despite being offered a new deal he chose to return to his former club, Middlesbrough.

===Return to Middlesbrough===
Woodgate re-joined his hometown club Middlesbrough on 6 July 2012, signing a three-year contract. He made his second debut for Boro against Bury in the League Cup on 11 August. Woodgate scored his first goal for Middlesbrough in a 4–1 victory against Charlton Athletic on 3 November.

On 10 February 2015, Woodgate started a match for Middlesbrough for the first time in 6 months and scored the first goal in a 2–1 win against Blackpool which sent Boro to the top of the Championship table. He was an unused substitute on 25 May as they lost the play-off final to Norwich City at Wembley. On 16 July 2015, Woodgate signed a one-year extension despite previously announcing retirement as a player. After playing only one game in the 2015–16 season, Woodgate left Middlesbrough on the expiration of his contract in May 2016 and retired from football.

==International career==
Woodgate was first called up to the England squad in April 1999, Kevin Keegan named him in the squad for the friendly against Hungary. However, he picked up an injury playing for Leeds United and had to withdraw from the squad. In May 1999, he was called up for the Euro 2000 qualifiers against Sweden and Bulgaria. On 9 June, Woodgate made his debut in the 1–1 draw against Bulgaria; he started the game before being replaced by Ray Parlour in the 64th minute. He retained his place in the squad for the Euro 2000 qualifiers against Luxembourg and Poland, but did not feature in either game. Woodgate was called up for the friendly against Belgium in October 1999, but he later withdrew from the squad because of a back injury. This turned out to be his last involvement with the England squad for nearly three years. The Football Association decided that Woodgate would not be allowed to play for England until the court case stemming from an incident during a night out in Leeds in January 2000 was over, and any subsequent punishments served. This meant he would miss out on both Euro 2000 and the 2002 FIFA World Cup.

On 2 September 2002, manager Sven-Göran Eriksson recalled Woodgate to the England squad for the friendly against Portugal. He went on to earn his second cap, replacing Rio Ferdinand at half-time in the 1–1 draw at Villa Park. Woodgate was called up for the Euro 2004 qualifiers against Slovakia and Macedonia in October 2002; he started and played the whole 90 minutes in both games. Injuries blighted Woodgate over the next couple of years, but he did manage to win his fifth cap in a friendly against Sweden on 31 March 2004. He started in the 1–0 defeat at Ullevi in Gothenburg, and was replaced by Anthony Gardner at half-time. A thigh injury picked up whilst playing for Newcastle United, in April 2004, ruled Woodgate out of the Euro 2004 tournament in Portugal.

After almost three years without an international cap, England manager Steve McClaren recalled Woodgate to the squad for the friendly against Spain in February 2007. On 7 February, Woodgate started in the 1–0 defeat at Old Trafford, before being replaced by Jamie Carragher in the 65th minute. The following month, he retained his place in the squad for the Euro 2008 qualifiers against Israel and Andorra. He would go on to miss both games because of a knee injury. In early 2008, Woodgate was named in Fabio Capello&#x27;s first two England squads, for the friendlies against Switzerland and France, but failed to feature in either game. In May 2008, Woodgate was named in the England squad for the end-of-season friendlies against the United States and Trinidad and Tobago. He was an unused substitute in the 2–0 win against the United States, before winning his seventh cap in the 3–0 win against Trinidad and Tobago. On 20 August, Woodgate won his eighth and last cap in the friendly against the Czech Republic, he replaced Rio Ferdinand in the 58th minute of the 2–2 draw at Wembley.

==Coaching career==

===Middlesbrough===

After a brief spell as an international scout for Liverpool in Spain and Portugal, on 31 March 2017, Woodgate was appointed as an assistant coach to newly appointed Middlesbrough caretaker manager Steve Agnew, following the dismissal of Aitor Karanka, with Woodgate becoming one of three new arrivals in the club&#x27;s coaching staff alongside fellow part-timers Joe Jordan and Paul Jenkins. After the club were relegated from the Premier League at the end of the season, Woodgate vacated his position after new manager Garry Monk brought in his own coaching staff, with him being replaced by James Beattie.

Following his departure from the first team, Woodgate joined the club&#x27;s Academy coaching staff in June 2017, as the under-18 team&#x27;s assistant coach under Mark Tinkler. In December 2017, Woodgate returned to his previous position as first team assistant coach, under the management of Tony Pulis, who replaced a dismissed Monk. In May 2019, Woodgate was the only member of Pulis&#x27; coaching staff not to be relieved from his duties, which saw him become the frontrunner to succeed the Welshman.

After huge speculation, on 14 June 2019, Woodgate was appointed as the new permanent manager of Middlesbrough, signing onto a three-year contract. He brought in former associates Robbie Keane and Leo Percovich as his assistants, whereas Danny Coyne was appointed as the club&#x27;s new goalkeeping coach. Following his appointment, Woodgate stated that he wanted to reintroduce attacking football to the club, having informed club chairman Steve Gibson that he wanted to &quot;play a more expansive game&quot;, with both parties wanting to redevelop the team&#x27;s style of play after Pulis&#x27; controversial spell.

The summer transfer window saw the Smoggies complete the signings of former club goalkeeper Tomás Mejías, Marcus Browne, Marc Bola and Anfernee Dijksteel. Woodgate&#x27;s first game as a manager came on 2 August, a 3–3 draw against newly promoted Luton Town, which saw supporters criticise his side&#x27;s defence. At the end of August, Middlesbrough sat eighteenth in the Championship, having recorded a single victory out of a possible six as well as collecting three draws and two defeats. Middlesbrough slipped into the relegation zone following a goalless draw against Fulham, remaining there for a further two matches until a 2–2 draw with Hull City saw them climb into twenty-first, only qualifying for a higher league position through goal difference.

After an indifferent start to management, Middlesbrough supporters demanded for Woodgate to be sacked, with many doubting his side&#x27;s ability to avoid relegation. With pressure mounting on Woodgate, tabloids alleged that former Cardiff City and highly experienced Premier League manager Neil Warnock was favoured to replace him, causing chairman Gibson to openly state that he &quot;is really behind&quot; the manager, with him &quot;understanding January needs&quot; to improve the team. December, however, was a positive month for Middlesbrough; recording four victories as well as a singular draw and defeat. Crucial victories over Charlton Athletic, Stoke City, Huddersfield Town and then-league leaders West Bromwich Albion, a draw over Nottingham Forest and defeat to Swansea City saw them rise up to sixteenth in the Championship table, finishing off 2019 nine points above the relegation zone. As a result of Middlesbrough&#x27;s turn around in form, Woodgate was rewarded as being named the Championship Manager of the Month for December.

During the winter transfer window, Middlesbrough were heavily active: Patrick Roberts, Lukas Nmecha, Ravel Morrison and Harold Moukoudi all arrived on loan, whereas Dejan Stojanović joined for an undisclosed fee from St. Gallen. Middlesbrough dipped in form resulting in Woodgate&#x27;s side heavily dropping down the league table; a 1–0 defeat to Yorkshire rivals Leeds United saw Middlesbrough drop to twenty-first, tying on points with Wigan Athletic, the latter looming in the relegation zone. After this, supporters once again demanded for Woodgate to be sacked; the manager later assured unsettled supporters that Gibson continued to &quot;back him&quot; despite their frequent dip in form.

Woodgate was sacked as Middlesbrough manager on 23 June 2020, with the club only outside the Championship relegation zone on goal difference after 38 games, following a 3–0 home defeat to Swansea in the club&#x27;s first game following the season&#x27;s restart. He was replaced by Neil Warnock on the same day.

===AFC Bournemouth===
On 1 February 2021, Woodgate was appointed as senior first team coach of AFC Bournemouth on a contract until the end of the 2020–21 season. Following the sacking of manager Jason Tindall two days later, Woodgate was appointed as caretaker manager on a temporary basis, before being appointed head coach until the end of the season on 21 February 2021. Following six wins from seven games, confirming their place in the play-offs in the process, Woodgate was awarded the Championship Manager of the Month award for April 2021. Bournemouth finished the season in 6th and entered the playoffs against Brentford, but despite winning 1–0 during the first leg, they lost 3–2 on aggregate, consigning them to another season in the championship. Scott Parker was appointed on 28 June 2021 as Woodgate&#x27;s successor and Woodgate subsequently left the club upon his contract&#x27;s end.

=== Return to Middlesbrough ===
After over a year of unemployment, Woodgate returned to Middlesbrough in October 2022 as a first team coach following the appointment of new manager Michael Carrick.

==Personal life==
Woodgate grew up supporting his local side Middlesbrough and cites Gary Pallister as his hero.

In 2000, he was a defendant with teammate Lee Bowyer in a court case after his involvement in an altercation outside the Majestyk nightclub in Leeds, in which a student was left with injuries to his face. The initial trial at Kingston upon Hull Crown Court collapsed, and following a second trial, also at Kingston upon Hull Crown Court in December 2001, Bowyer was cleared of charges of grievous bodily harm with intent and affray, while Woodgate was convicted of affray and sentenced to 100 hours&#x27; community service. He was also banned from international selection by the Football Association, which prevented him from being selected in the England squad for the 2000 European Championship and the 2002 World Cup.

Woodgate has two children with his wife Natalie Downing, the sister of former Middlesbrough teammate and England midfielder Stewart Downing.

Woodgate has a popular drink named after him at student nightclub Jimmy Allen&#x27;s in Durham following his successful season at Newcastle United.

<text>RubyCocoa is a macOS framework that provides a bridge between the Ruby and the Objective-C programming languages, allowing the user to manipulate Objective-C objects from Ruby, and vice versa. It makes it possible to write a Cocoa application completely in Ruby as well as to write an application that mixes Ruby and Objective-C code. An Apple project called MacRuby was under development to replace RubyCocoa in 2008. A proprietary spin-off called RubyMotion was subsequently released in 2012, available for iOS, macOS and Android.

RubyCocoa is used for exploration of a Cocoa object&#x27;s features with irb interactively, prototyping of a Cocoa application, writing a Cocoa application that combines the features of Ruby and Objective-C, and wrapping macOS&#x27; native GUI for a Ruby script.

RubyCocoa is free software, released under both the Ruby License and the LGPL.

== History ==
RubyCocoa was started in 2001 by Hisakuni Fujimoto when he implemented a Ruby extension module to wrap NSObject and NSClassFromString function. Later it was integrated with Project Builder (which later became Xcode). In 2002 the project was registered on SourceForge and the development team began to grow.

In 2006 the committers list was first joined by a developer from Apple, Laurent Sansonetti, and then a RubyCocoa presentation was made during WWDC. Apple stated that RubyCocoa will be included and supported in Mac OS X v10.5 “Leopard”.

In August 2008, Sansonetti confirmed that MacRuby &quot;is supposed to replace RubyCocoa.&quot; in the future.

== Functionality ==
RubyCocoa is sometimes interpreted as a set of bindings to the Cocoa frameworks, which is false. RubyCocoa is a real bridge between the Objective-C and Ruby programming languages.

=== Lazy class import ===
RubyCocoa will import the Objective-C classes into the Ruby world on demand. For example, when you access codice_1 for the very first time in your code, RubyCocoa will retrieve all the necessary information regarding this class from the Objective-C runtime and create a Ruby class of the same name that will act as a proxy. It will also import in the same way all the inherited classes.

=== Forwarding messages ===
Every time the user sends a Ruby message to a proxy object, RubyCocoa will try to forward it to the embedded Objective-C instance, by translating the message name to an Objective-C selector and asking the Objective-C runtime to forward it.

If an exception is raised from the Objective-C world, RubyCocoa will convert it to a Ruby exception and forward it to you.

RubyCocoa uses the libffi library to call the Objective-C methods implementations.

=== Automatic method overriding ===
RubyCocoa makes it easy to override an Objective-C method from Ruby, either in a subclass or directly to the class (as you would do in Objective-C using a category).

Once your method is inserted, RubyCocoa will retrieve the signature of the existing Objective-C method and inject a new one to the Objective-C runtime, of the same signature, but which now points to your code.

To accomplish this, RubyCocoa uses the libffi library to dynamically create a closure that will call the Ruby method, and just passes a pointer to that new closure to the Objective-C runtime.

=== Accessing the C bits ===
Due to the nature of the Objective-C language, you can freely use C from Objective-C code. In order to bridge the relevant C parts of an Objective-C framework, such as C structures, functions, enumerations, constants and more, RubyCocoa relies on the BridgeSupport project.

RubyCocoa will interpret at runtime the BridgeSupport files (using the very fast libXML2&#x27;s xmlTextReader) and accordingly handle their content. It will for instance construct the Ruby proxy classes for the C structures and also create the functions.

Note that the costly operations, such as localizing the symbols, are done on demand, and obviously only once.

=== Format strings ===
RubyCocoa is able to detect APIs that use format strings, like NSLog or NSString.stringWithFormat, and appropriately convert the variable arguments to the types specified in the format string.

=== Function pointers ===
RubyCocoa allows you to pass Ruby codice_2 objects as function pointer arguments. It will then use the libffi library to dynamically create a closure and pass it to the underlying function/method.

== Creation of Cocoa applications written in Ruby ==

Installing RubyCocoa also automatically installs the corresponding Xcode templates. This allows developers to select &quot;Cocoa-Ruby Application&quot; as the Xcode project type and Xcode will generate all necessary files for them.
== How to call Objective-C methods from Ruby ==
To invoke an Objective-C method, you replace each colon in the method name except the last with an underscore. Thus, for example, the NSWindow instance method codice_3 becomes codice_4.

All Cocoa classes and functions belong to codice_5 module, so for example, the Objective-C code:
[[NSWindow alloc] initWithContentRect:frame
 styleMask:NSTitledWindowMask
 backing:NSBackingStoreBuffered
 defer:NO]
will become:
OSX::NSWindow.alloc.initWithContentRect_styleMask_backing_defer(frame,
 OSX::NSTitledWindowMask,
 OSX::NSBackingStoreBuffered,
 false)
As you can see, this decreases the code readability by rendering Objective-C parameter naming useless. So, there is another convenient way to write the method calls — the codice_6 method, which accepts Ruby symbols as parameter names. For example, the previous code can also be written as:
OSX::NSWindow.alloc.objc_send(:initWithContentRect, frame,
 :styleMask, OSX::NSTitledWindowMask,
 :backing, OSX::NSBackingStoreBuffered,
 :defer, false)
== Advantages of RubyCocoa ==
* As Ruby is an interpreted language, there&#x27;s no need to recompile the application frequently during development.
* Some of Ruby&#x27;s rich features, like built-in [[regular expression]] support, make writing the code faster, and also make RubyCocoa an ideal tool for prototyping.

== Disadvantages ==
* Ignoring the speed of the Ruby interpreter, RubyCocoa applications will always be slower than Objective-C/Cocoa applications due to the added overhead of object conversion.
* Because Ruby isn&#x27;t thread-safe, it isn&#x27;t possible to dispatch multiple native threads to execute RubyCocoa code. Ruby&#x27;s emulated threads, however, can be used.

<text>&quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot; is a science fiction short story by American writer Ray Bradbury, first published in &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazine on June 28, 1952, and later in Bradbury&#x27;s 1953 collection &quot;The Golden Apples of the Sun&quot;.

==Plot summary==
In the year 2055, time travel has become a practical reality, and the company Time Safari Inc. offers wealthy adventurers the chance to travel back in time to hunt extinct species such as dinosaurs. A hunter named Eckels pays $10,000 to join a hunting party that will travel back 65 million years to the Late Cretaceous period, on a guided safari to kill a &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;. As the party waits to depart, they discuss the recent presidential elections in which a candidate, Deutscher, has been defeated by his opponent Keith, to the relief of many concerned.

When the party arrives in the past, Travis, the hunting guide, and his assistant warn Eckels and the two other hunters about the necessity of minimizing the events they change before they go back, since even the smallest alterations to the distant past could snowball into catastrophic changes in history. Travis explains that the hunters are obliged to stay on a levitating path to avoid disrupting the environment, any deviation will be punished with hefty fines and prosecution, Time Safari scouts had been sent back to select and tag prey whose death will have minimal effect on the future prior to the hunt, and the time machine &quot;steps aside&quot; to prevent people from encountering themselves in the past.

Although Eckels is initially excited about the hunt, when the monstrous &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; approaches, he loses his nerve. Travis tells him to go back to the time machine, but Eckels panics, steps off the path, and stumbles into the forest. The other four shoot and kill the dinosaur and see that Eckels has found his way back to the time machine. Travis threatens to leave him in the past before ordering him to remove the bullets from the dinosaur&#x27;s body, as they cannot be left behind.

Upon returning to 2055, Eckels and the rest of the party notice major changes; English words are now spelled phonetically, and worst of all, Deutscher has won the election to the approval of the pro-fascist populace. Looking at the mud on his boots, Eckels finds a crushed golden butterfly, whose death has apparently changed the nature of the alternative present to which the safari has returned. He frantically pleads to undo the damage, and the story ends on a gunshot fired by Travis.

==Adaptations==
A comic-book version appeared in issue #25 of EC Comics&#x27;s &quot;Weird Science-Fantasy&quot; (1954), adapted by Al Feldstein with art by Al Williamson and Angelo Torres.

The story was adapted for the first issue of Topp&#x27;s Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Ray Bradbury Comics&quot; (1993) with art by Richard Corben.

The story was adapted for the third season episode six of &quot;The Ray Bradbury Theater&quot; on October 8, 1989, starring Kiel Martin.

A film adaptation of the same name starring Ben Kingsley, Edward Burns, and Catherine McCormack was released in 2005. Famed film critic Roger Ebert stated that while he &quot;cannot endorse it, [he] can appreciate it&quot; as a film that is bad because it &quot;want[s] so much to be terrific that [it] explode[s] under the strain.&quot;

A Game Boy Advance video game based on the film was also released. It was finished in time for the film&#x27;s planned 2003 release, delayed along with it, and ultimately released in February 2005. Planned console ports were canceled.

The story is parodied in the &quot;Time and Punishment&quot; section of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror V&quot;.

The story is referenced in a brief scene at the beginning of the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Space Babies&quot;.

The story is mentioned by the protagonists in the novel &quot;11/22/63&quot; by Stephen King on page 648.

==Influence==
&quot;A Sound of Thunder&quot; is often credited as the origin of the term &quot;butterfly effect&quot;, a concept of chaos theory in which the flapping of a butterfly&#x27;s wings in one part of the world could create a hurricane on the opposite side of the globe. The term was actually introduced by meteorologist Edward Norton Lorenz in the 1960s. However, Bradbury&#x27;s concept of how the death of a butterfly in the past could have drastic changes in the future is a representation of the butterfly effect and is used as an example of how to consider chaos theory and the physics of time travel.

<text>(Abarenbō Shōgun) was a Japanese television program on the TV Asahi network. Set in the eighteenth century, it showed fictitious events in the life of Yoshimune, the eighth Tokugawa &quot;shōgun&quot;.

The program started in 1978 under the title &quot;Yoshimune Hyōbanki: Abarenbō Shōgun&quot; (&quot;Chronicle in Praise of Yoshimune: The Unfettered Shōgun&quot;) who went after rogue councilors and &quot;daimyō&quot; who were abusing their power. After a few seasons, they shortened the first two words and the show ran for two decades under the shorter title until the series ended in 2003; a two-hour special aired in 2004. The earliest scripts occasionally wove stories around historic events such as the establishment of firefighting companies of commoners in Edo, but eventually the series adopted a routine of strictly fiction.

Along with Zenigata Heiji and Mito Kōmon, it ranks among the longest-running series in the jidaigeki genre. Like many other jidaigeki, it falls in the category of &quot;kanzen-chōaku&quot;, loosely, &quot;rewarding good and punishing evil&quot;.

== Repeating characters ==

===Regulars===

Tokugawa Yoshimune
:Disguised as Tokuda Shinnosuke—Shin-san to his friends—the third son of a hatamoto, the shogun roams freely about his capital, using the Megumi fire company as his base. The captain of the company knows his identity, but others are unaware that he is the shogun. Yoshimune-as-Shinnosuke is portrayed as the nearly invincible samurai warrior who seldom loses a fight no matter how many enemies opposing him there are.

Ōoka Echizen-no-Kami Tadasuke
:Like Yoshimune, Tadasuke was a historical personage. Yoshimune appointed him to the position of Minami Machi Bugyō, one of the two chief administrators of Edo. In this office, he was mayor, police chief, judge and jury. He instituted and oversaw the operations of the commoners&#x27; fire companies. He also oversaw the Koishikawa &quot;City Hospital&quot; (Koishikawa Yōjōsho, another Yoshimune innovation). He was aware of Yoshimune&#x27;s secret activities and originally did not approve, but grew to accept them as necessary and was a loyal accomplice. In the first episode, it was revealed that when he was Yamada Magistrate he had once reprimanded Yoshimune for illegal fishing when the shogun was younger, proving both his integrity and his devotion to the law.

:Tadashi Yokouchi played Tadasuke for nearly twenty years; Ryō Tamura replaced him in the closing seasons.

Goyō toritsugi
:The &quot;goyō toritsugi&quot; (御用取次) or &quot;soba yōnin&quot; () was the person who scheduled appointments for the Shogun. He is generally a man of advanced years. Yoshimune frequently referred to him informally as &quot;jii&quot; (&quot;old man&quot; or &quot;gramps&quot; [depending on the subtitle translation]) while in the castle while outside he would generally refer to him by the polite &quot;oji-ue&quot; (&quot;uncle&quot;) outside. In the first two casts, the character&#x27;s name was Kanō Gorozaemon (played by comic Ichirō Arishima). Next came Tanokura Magobei (Eiji Funakoshi), and a few followed in the cast changes of the last years of the show.
Fire captain
:Tatsugoro, originally the boss of a construction gang, was the founder of the Megumi fire company and thus reported directly to Tadasuke. In the first episode, it was revealed that he was a former drinking and fighting companion of Yoshimune&#x27;s before the young lord&#x27;s elevation to the shogunate. Enka singer Saburō Kitajima played in the series from beginning to end. Although somewhat short-tempered and never one to shun a brawl for a righteous cause, this short, stocky character was altruistic to a fault, stubborn, and fiercely loyal to Yoshimune.

:Kitajima also sang the closing theme songs for several years.

:Later, Tatsugorō retired from the Megumi and assumed a different occupation; the writers of the series brought in Jōji Yamamoto, another singer (and a disciple of Kitajima) to play Chōjirō, the successor to Tatsugorō. In all, there were three captains during the series.

Women of Megumi
:Three actresses played Osai, the feisty wife of Tatsugoro, and Omachi the younger sister of Tatsugoro. Later, when Tatsugorō left the fire company, the new captain Chōjirō married Obun, the young fishmonger/beat cop. The third captain was unmarried; his widowed sister Okyō was the lady of the Megumi.

Firemen
:The cast always included half a dozen firefighters (&quot;hikeshi&quot;). While the roles were minor, together they were a prominent presence in the series. Character actors and comics played these parts.

:The fire companies were named with a single kana such as め followed by the word &quot;-gumi&quot;. The show featured the &quot;Me-gumi&quot;, whose auspicious name could also mean &quot;blessing&quot;; the squad was formed in the third episode &quot;The First Fireman&#x27;s Banner&quot;.

:In the first several years, a retired sumo wrestler named Ryūko was a member of the cast. He played a retired sumo wrestler named Ryūko, who was initially a guest of the captain. He later became a bone-setting doctor, and finally joined the crew of the fire company. Long after leaving the series, he made an appearance as a guest star.

Oniwaban (ninja)
:The show always had a male and a female &quot;oniwaban&quot; from the Iga Clan who acted as both spies and bodyguards for Yoshimune. A few of the actors and actresses have gone on to starring roles in other series. The original female, Osono, was played by Yōko Natsuki. Her successor Sagiri, Asaka Mayumi in Season 2, is currently active. In the third series, Reiko Sugano played Hayate; then Takashima Reiko, who has gone on to star in television and film, succeeded her, with the name Kozue. Mayuko Irie (Akane), Akiko Andō (Koyuki), Hitoe Ōtake (Ayame), Chika Kochihira (Satsuki), Kaori Yamaguchi (Nagisa), and Kaori Matsunaga (Azami) followed, with Miki Murai appearing in the final special as Kaede. The men include Yabuta Sukehachi (portrayed by Hiroshi Miyauchi, who was killed saving Yoshimune&#x27;s life in Season One Episode 87) and Ōtsuki Hanzō (Shun&#x27;ya Wazaki, who was appointed Sukehachi&#x27;s replacement by Kanō Gorozaemon and made &quot;Oniwaban&quot; leader by Yoshimune in Episode 88) opposite Osono, the first Saizō (Shigeru Araki, paired with Hayate), Sagenta (Kiyotaka Mitsugi) and the second Saizō (played by Takayuki Godai). Hayami Saheiji (Toshihide Wakamatsu) in Season 6, Jūmonji Hayato, and finally Gorōta followed.

Narrator
:Genzō Wakayama narrated the show from the first episode to the last.

===Semi-regulars===
Tokugawa Muneharu (徳川宗春)
:The historical Yoshimune came to power when the main line of succession to the Tokugawa shogunate came to an end. He was chosen from the second of the three cadet branches of the Tokugawa clan, and the head of the senior branch, Muneharu, was passed over. The television series frequently presented Muneharu as a rival who tried to assassinate Yoshimune and take over the shogunate. Even when he did not appear, many villains acted in his name, or planned to receive their reward from Muneharu when he became shogun. First played by Akira Nakao and later by Tokuma Nishioka.
Yamada Asaemon (山田朝右衛門)
: Nicknamed Kubikiri Asa. An executioner for the shogunate, he quits and becomes a &quot;rōnin&quot; and ally of Yoshimune. Asahi Kurizuka played the role in many episodes.
O-Yuri no Kata (お由利の方)
: Also known as Jōen&#x27;in (浄円院). Yoshimune&#x27;s mother. Sons of samurai overlords were often separated from their mothers at an early age to develop sternness in them, and Yoshimune was no different. Although Yoshimune offered Oyuri room and board in Edo Castle, she refused, living instead an austere life in a house often seen nearly falling apart. They love each other as an ordinary mother and son, but they conceal their relationship to others as this is part of the Shinnosuke myth used by the Shogun. Played by Tamao Nakamura.

== Guest stars ==

Over the course of a quarter of a century, the show featured a parade of celebrities. Singers, actors, and athletes of all ages played various roles, in some cases including themselves: Ryūko appeared as a guest several years after leaving the regular cast. Hibari Misora, the famous singer, also appeared in the series. Former and future regular characters occasionally made guest appearances.

Among the guest stars were the following:

* Yoshio Inaba
* Hiroyuki Sanada
* Tetsuro Tamba
* Rika Miura
* Nobuo Yana
* Masashi Ishibashi
* Nana Okada
* Toshiaki Nishizawa
* Hirohisa Nakata
* Yukari Yamamoto
* Midori Nishizaki
* Wakiko Kano
* Aiko Tachibana

== Stories ==
The show was frequently topical, and touched on many themes of present-day life, the most common subject being political corruption. Many shows covered include topics of current interest such as drugs, unequal power relationships, poverty, urbanization, the generation gap, yakuza, prostitution, inflation, and the tension between Japanese and foreign knowledge.

=== Climax ===

At the end of about eight hundred episodes, Yoshimune confronts the corrupt official or officials in their safehaven. The official calls his men, but Yoshimune stands firm to reveal and criticize his crimes without hesitation. At first, the official behaves rudely and insultingly as he believes Yoshimune is just a man of low social status, but then after looking closely at Yoshimune&#x27;s face has a flashback leading him to recognize Yoshimune as Shogun and kneel down in obeisance. However, on hearing Yoshimune&#x27;s demand that he commit harakiri, he declares Yoshimune to be an impostor and orders his men to kill him. Always outnumbered, Yoshimune ends up easily defeating his attackers with the help of his male and female oniwaban. Using the unsharpened back side of his sword so as to injure without killing the corrupt official, he orders his oniwaban to execute him with the words, &quot;sei bai&quot; (&quot;Punish him!&quot;). In the premiere episode &quot;The Star of Edo&quot;, Yoshimune confronts the main villain as himself inside Castle Edo and the villain recognizes him as the &quot;hatamoto&quot;; after attempting to flee, being disarmed by Yoshimune and surrounded by Yoshimune&#x27;s ninja and the palace guards, he is allowed to kill himself.

=== Lines of rebellion ===
In confronting Yoshimune, the official declares his rebellion with a variety of reasons, including the doubt of the appearance of the Shogun at that place and time or losing his respect to Yoshimune, etc., and it&#x27;s one of the enjoyable points in the climax.

Example:

*Lord Tokugawa cannot be here
*He is an insolent person calling himself Lord Tokugawa
*It&#x27;s fine if the person were Lord Tokugawa
*Everything ends, kill, kill him
*Lord Tokugawa, I will fight with you
*We lob your life, Lord Tokugawa
*You are just Shinnosuke Tokuda dying now
*I decorate the last minute as an evil (to defeat you)
*You are like a moth flying into the flame
*Your Highness exists because of us, subordinates&#x27; dedication (not because of your ability)
*The eighth shogunate will end
*Now is the time
*Shame on you
*Bring his head to our lord Muneharu
*I have forgotten the face of Lord Tokugawa
*There is no reason to obey the order of Lord Tokugawa
*It is you who cut your own body, not I
*We have planned to make you die
*You must give up your life
*I am a person who should have died at once (so, I&#x27;m not afraid if you try to execute me)
*If you know the situation completely, in for a penny, in for a pound
*How stupid saying who you are, it&#x27;s the best timing that you show up here (to be killed)

== Music ==
Shunsuke Kikuchi wrote the opening theme, which is popular as a ring tone. He also composed the incidental music. Saburō Kitajima sang the closing theme songs to various series. Late series omitted the closing theme, having instead introductory music by Kikuchi leading into an opening theme song sung by Kitajima. Due to the show&#x27;s popularity in the Hawaiian islands where a large portion of the population is Japanese, the opening theme has become one of the official sports themes played at University of Hawaii sporting events.

== Broadcasts ==
The original broadcasts were on the TV Asahi network in Japan. The &quot;Jidaigeki Senmon Channel&quot; has rebroadcast the series on cable and satellite. Also, full English-subtitled programs have been broadcast in Hawaii via KIKU and have become very popular even among younger generations probably due to the large Japanese-American population and heavy Asian influence on modern Hawaiian culture.

<text>Antonije Pušić (; born 14 June 1963), known professionally as Rambo Amadeus (), is a Yugoslav and Montenegrin author and performer. A self-titled &quot;musician, poet, and media manipulator&quot;, he is a noted artist across the countries of former Yugoslavia.

His songs combine satirical lyrics on human nature and the silliness of local politics with a mixture of musical styles including jazz, rock, hip-hop and lately drum and bass, and self-conscious ironic wit; for example, his most popular alias is &quot;Rambo Amadeus Svjetski Kilo Car&quot; (&quot;Rambo Amadeus the World Kilo Tzar&quot;), formerly &quot;Rambo Amadeus Svjetski Mega Car&quot; (&quot;Rambo Amadeus the World Mega Tzar&quot;) (RASMC) (changed in 2012 because of his belief in the importance of modesty in an environmentally conscious society). His stage name itself is made from John Rambo and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

His concerts are never mere repetitions of recorded songs, but a mixture of free improvisation and satirical humor exploiting all aspects of human nature in a crude manner. Some fans compare his style with Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart.

Rambo Amadeus represented Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku, Azerbaijan, with the song &quot;Euro Neuro&quot;.

==Early life==
Antonije Pušić was born in Kotor, SR Montenegro, SFR Yugoslavia though his family lived in nearby Herceg Novi where he was raised. His writer and painter mother Bosiljka was born in Ćuprija and raised in Jagodina, Serbia before meeting Ilija Pušić from the coastal village of Kumbor near Herceg Novi and moving there upon marrying him. The couple soon moved to Herceg Novi proper and started a family, with their first child, son , born in 1960 followed by Antonije in 1963. After completing elementary and secondary education in his hometown, Antonije graduated in tourism studies from the University of Belgrade&#x27;s Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences. He also completed six grades of elementary music school for piano before dropping out.

Before pursuing music and performing arts as a career choice, Pušić was an accomplished competitive sailor. Between 1972 and 1984, he represented Yugoslavia in numerous international regattas. During this period he was the Montenegrin champion several times, an 8-time South-Adriatic champion, national title winner in the junior category, as well as International Đerdap Cup winner in 1980. He still occasionally attends and participates in some recreational sailing regattas in the Gulf of Kotor.

He began to sing and compose during his first year of high school (gymnasium) which soon led to involvement with various local bands in Herceg Novi and Titograd. One of his first performances saw him play the mandolin in an orchestra entertaining guests at Herceg Novi&#x27;s Plaza hotel.

In 1985, he moved to Belgrade in pursuit of higher education. Parallel to his university studies, he also played with various amateur bands and musicians.

==Musical career==

===1970s===
In 1979, Rambo Amadeus started off in a band called &quot;Radioaktivni otpad,&quot; which was short lived. He was also in a band called &quot;The Blues Band.&quot; He didn&#x27;t like the content produced, so he rearranged the setup. The band lasted throughout his high school years, playing in Herceg Novi, Nikšić and Igalo (5 km distance from Herceg Novi).

===1980s===
In 1988, he dropped into the music scene out of nowhere with his debut album &quot;O tugo jesenja.&quot; His sound was a seemingly coarse blend of folkish ululations and opera, further mixed in with humorous lyrics and classic guitar riffs. Since very few people had prior knowledge of him, Rambo was delighted in creating confusion by introducing himself as Nagib Fazlić Nagon, a mine shaft operator who saved up enough money to record an album. He also jokingly referred to his own musical style as turbo folk, long before this term would begin to be applied to an actual musical style, which critics refer to with a grave social connotation and came to symbolise the moral and cultural decline throughout the Balkans during the wars of the 1990s.

Producer Saša Habić gave Rambo the opportunity to sign for the state television&#x27;s record company PGP RTB (Rambo later wrote an anecdotal tribute to that event, in the hit song &quot;Balkan Boy&quot;). Habić also played the synthesiser on this album, from which a track named &quot;Vanzemaljac&quot; (Extraterrestrial) continues to be popular to this day. The record&#x27;s sales weren&#x27;t particularly high, but Rambo created enough of a buzz to remain active on the scene.

His next album &quot;Hoćemo gusle&quot; was released in 1989 and gave a small taste of Rambo&#x27;s future musical direction – overt political satire. The track &quot;Amerika i Engleska (biće zemlja proleterska)&quot; was originally supposed to be named &quot;Kataklizma komunizma&quot; (Cataclysm of Communism) but local authorities did not allow it. The album title pokes fun at a bizarre event from the 1989 protests in Montenegro that eventually grew into the anti-bureaucratic revolution that swept Milo Đukanović, Momir Bulatović, and Svetozar Marović into power. Protesters were heard chanting &quot;Hoćemo Ruse&quot; (&quot;We want the Russians&quot;), but when the authorities and state-controlled media criticized them for it, many quickly began backpedaling by claiming they actually chanted &quot;Hoćemo gusle&quot; (&quot;We want gusle&quot;).

Other songs like &quot;Glupi hit&quot; and the aforementioned &quot;Balkan boy&quot; would also become considerable hits. Rambo even received solid critical acclaim for chances he took in &quot;Samit u buregdžinici Laibach&quot;. On that track, he created a catchy hybrid by mixing the unique sound of Laibach with lyrics borrowed from the poetry of Laza Kostić and Desanka Maksimović, as well as from folk &quot;kafana&quot; standard &quot;Čaše lomim&quot; mixing with his own humorous lyrics. The album sleeve lists the lyrics of a song that wasn&#x27;t actually recorded, and explains that &quot;it was dropped at the last moment because there was no room for it,&quot; but gives assurances that it would appear on the next album. Since the song in question, named &quot;Pegepe ertebe,&quot; was all about taking shots at Rambo&#x27;s label PGP RTB, but however, it didn&#x27;t appear on the next or any other album.

===1990s===
In the early 1990s, Rambo was growing into an established performer. His third album &quot;Psihološko propagandni komplet M-91&quot; came out towards the end of 1991 at a time when the breakup of the former Yugoslavia was already in full swing. For obvious reasons, the least of which was the album&#x27;s subtitle – &quot;Psychological Propaganda Set&quot;, many songs contained heavy lyrics and a dark, militaristic atmosphere. In your face profanity and descriptive cursing was also par for the course, making this the first major music release in former Yugoslavia to take such narrative liberties. Tracks like &quot;Smrt popa Mila Jovovića&quot; (30-year-old poem by Božo Đuranović), &quot;Jemo voli jem&quot; (incorporating samples from Yugoslav aviators&#x27; anthem &quot;Hej vojnici vazduhoplovci&quot; as well as Šemsa Suljaković&#x27;s &quot;Izgubila sve sam bitke&quot;), &quot;Inspektor Nagib&quot; and &quot;Zdravo damo&quot; became instant hits.

The discrepancy between what&#x27;s listed on the cover and what is actually recorded is there again as sleeve announces the track called &quot;KPGS&quot; which would, this time for real, appear on the next live album, but does not list &quot;Halid invalid Hari&quot; and &quot;Prijatelju, prijatelju&quot; which were included and became big hits. Many consider the two tracks to be classic Rambo: observant, opinionated, direct and profane. The latter of the two originally included excerpts from Slobodan Milošević and Franjo Tuđman speeches, but the record company censors took them out.

This album further solidified Rambo&#x27;s presence on the scene as he started playing bigger arenas like Sava centar. Due to his outspoken and entertaining nature he would often get invited on various TV and radio outlets across the country.

During &quot;Belgrade spring&quot; festival in 1992. he showed civil courage when he interrupted a concert by &quot;Bebi Dol&quot; during live TV broadcast and said to tens of thousands of viewers:

&quot;As we play here bombs are falling on Dubrovnik and Tuzla. We won&#x27;t entertain the political voters no more. F*** your mothers!&quot; 

He threw the microphone on the floor, left the stage and the show was over.

Trying to take the new situation in stride, he hit the road, becoming one of the first performers from FR Yugoslavia to regularly start touring Macedonia and Slovenia in the years following those states&#x27; declarations of independence.

After the live album &quot;KPGS&quot; (taped on 29 December 1992 in Skopje) that included the new studio track &quot;Karamba karambita&quot; followed by a greatest hits compilation &quot;Izabrana dela 1989–1994&quot;, Rambo recorded peculiar new material during July 1995 in Paris with Goran Vejvoda. Released the following year as &quot;Mikroorganizmi&quot;, it featured an inaccessible, moody sound garnered with terse, experimental music marking a sizable departure from his usual antics.

He simultaneously released &quot;Muzika za decu&quot;, a personal musical take on Ljubivoje Ršumović&#x27;s poetry featuring two bonus new tracks – &quot;Sex&quot; and &quot;ABVGD&quot;.

Old-school Rambo fans did not have to wait long for a return to earlier style. Towards the end of 1996, on &quot;Titanik&quot; he delivered a new batch of traditional fare like &quot;Šakom u glavu&quot;, &quot;Sado-mazo&quot;, &quot;Zreo za penziju&quot; and &quot;Otiš&#x27;o je svak ko valja&quot; (dedicated to Toma Zdravković and members of Šarlo Akrobata). Seasoned musicians like Ognjen Radivojević (who would become famous for working with such musicians like Goran Bregović and Zdravko Čolić), Goran Ljuboja, Dragan Markovski and Marija Mihajlović) took part in recording sessions for this album.

An extensive tour followed and it again included Slovenia (a live album was recorded over two Ljubljana concerts in April 1997 and later released as &quot;Koncert u KUD France Prešeren&quot;), as well as Bosnia where Rambo appeared as a guest at Sejo Sexon&#x27;s Zabranjeno pušenje gig in Sarajevo. That appearance in December 1997 was the first post-war visit by a Montenegrin performer to Bosnia.

On 9 June 1998 Rambo played Belgrade&#x27;s Dom Sindikata hall in what he announced to be the farewell performance before retirement. Even if many doubted his sincerity, the concert was a memorable one. Soon, Rambo packed his bags and left for the Netherlands, though not before squeezing in two more shows in Bosnia. In the Netherlands, he worked a series of menial jobs including construction, before deciding to return to Belgrade after only four months abroad. Back home, not surprisingly, he also returned to music and continued to break down inter-ethnic barriers: on 10 December 1998 he and Margita Stefanović played a show in Pula at the local cinema with KUD Idijoti, which was a first opportunity since the war for a Croatian audience to see performers from Serbia and Montenegro.

===2000s===
Throughout 2000, Rambo worked on what would eventually become the &quot;Don&#x27;t Happy, Be Worry&quot; album. This album included the song &quot;Laganese&quot; which sampled the Norwegian journalist Åsne Seierstad singing the Norwegian Folk song &quot;Eg rodde meg ut på seiegrunnen&quot; and swearing. By this time, sampling and local pop-cultural references had become two more staples of his sound, and this material, too, was heavy on both. Produced by Iztok Turk, it featured tracks like &quot;Čoban je upravo napustio zgradu&quot; (loose cover of Neda Ukraden&#x27;s &quot;Zora je svanula&quot;), &quot;Moj skutere&quot; that borrows from Oliver Dragojević&#x27;s &quot;Moj galebe&quot;, and &quot;Izađite molim&quot; with sprinkled in dialogues from Goran Marković&#x27;s 1982 movie &quot;Variola vera&quot;.

In 2004, Rambo released his third live album &quot;Bolje jedno vruće pivo nego četri ladna&quot;, which was followed by the studio album &quot;Oprem dobro&quot; in mid-2005.

He made a song &quot;Dikh tu kava&quot; in collaboration with ethno-jazz fusion band Kal, and in 2007 he appeared on their album as a featured artist in the song &quot;Komedija&quot; (&quot;Comedy&quot;).

In autumn 2007 he did a performance called &quot;Mixing of alternative rocks&quot;, when he &quot;played&quot; on 12 concrete mixers in front of the audience during The Alternative Rock Festival in SKC, Belgrade.

For the purpose of the New Year&#x27;s show on RTV, he appeared in the song &quot;Rakija&quot; followed by Zorule, the traditional folk orchestra. This song was used later as one of the tracks for &quot;Vratiće se rode&quot; TV serial. In February 2008, Rambo Amadeus performed as a guest star of The RTS Big Band jazz orchestra, for their 60th Anniversary.

&quot;Hipishizik Metafizik&quot; is his latest studio album, released for PGP RTS in July 2008.

===2010s===
Rambo Amadeus was internally selected by the Montenegrin national broadcaster RTCG to represent Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest 2012 in Baku, Azerbaijan. His winning song &quot;Euro Neuro&quot; gained controversy for its video. He ultimately succeeded in his goal of obtaining a very low ranking in the competition and announced that he is honoured to have written the worst song on Eurovision.

 In 2013, he released a video for the new single &quot;O&#x27;Ruk on the Road Again&quot; with Three Winnettous.

In 2015, he released the album &quot;Vrh dna&quot;, which featured previously unreleased track &quot;Rano Za Početak&quot; from 2011, and he retitled it &quot;Samo Balade&quot; for the album&#x27;s release.

In 2016, he landed two voice-work roles, as Mighty Eagle in the Croatian-language and Serbian-language version of &quot;The Angry Birds Movie&quot;, and as Crush in the Serbian-language version of &quot;Finding Dory&quot;.

In 2018, he tried to represent Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2018 with the song Nema Te, a duet with jazz singer Beti Đorđević. They performed the song in Beovizija 2018. and came 9th.

==Other endeavours==
In addition to a prolific solo recording career, Rambo frequently engaged in different, often bizarre side projects.

*In 1989 in Sarajevo, for a short while, he hosted an erotic quiz show with actress Jasna Beri named &quot;Turbo-lilihip&quot;, which aired on a local TV station SA3.
*He wrote music for different theatre plays such as &#x27;, &#x27;, as well as &quot; for which he was awarded the Sterija prize in 1994.

*In 1994, he also wrote a musical score for the 1927 silent movie &quot;Metropolis&quot; by Fritz Lang. At a movie screening at Sava Center, Rambo&#x27;s music was played by the Belgrade Philharmonic. The material was later recorded by Rambo himself along with Miroslav Savić and Heavily Manipulated Orchestra, and released as Metropolis B (Tour-de-Force)
*A year later, he arranged a cadenza within &quot;A concerto for piano and orchestra in C-minor&quot; by W.A. Mozart. In 1995, this cadenza was performed by Ivan Tasovac, while the entire concert was conducted by Oskar Danon at Belgrade&#x27;s Kolarac concert hall.
*Since early 2005, Rambo has written a column &quot;&quot; (&quot;Mega-Imperial Thoughts&quot;) for the daily tabloid &quot;Blic&quot;.
* In December 2010, he was a guest on Studio B&#x27;s Agape program together with Serbian Orthodox bishop Porfirije where they talked about the meaning of life, finding ones&#x27;s self way in life, slowing down, drug abuse and rehabilitation (Rambo confessed to using marijuana for 20 years).
* Rambo has done voice-work for the Serbian-Croatian language dubs of &quot;The Lion King&quot; franchise, &quot;Despicable Me&quot;, &quot;Ice Age: Continental Drift&quot;, &quot;Madagascar 3: Europe&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;, &quot;The Angry Birds Movie&quot; and &quot;Finding Dory&quot;.

<doc id="914804" wikidata="Q1370527" url="?curid=914804" title="Military dictatorship in Brazil">
<text>The military dictatorship in Brazil (), occasionally referred to as the Fifth Brazilian Republic, was established on 1 April 1964, after a coup d&#x27;état by the Brazilian Armed Forces, with support from the United States government, against president João Goulart. The Brazilian dictatorship lasted for 21 years, until 15 March 1985. 

The coup was planned and executed by the most senior commanders of the Brazilian Army and received the support of almost all high-ranking members of the military, along with conservative sectors in society, like the Catholic Church and anti-communist civilian movements among the Brazilian middle and upper classes. The military regime, particularly after the Institutional Act No. 5 of 1968, practiced extensive censorship and committed human rights abuses. Those abuses included institutionalized torture, extrajudicial killings and forced disappearances. Despite initial pledges to the contrary, the military regime enacted a new, restrictive Constitution in 1967, and stifled freedom of speech and political opposition. The regime adopted nationalism, economic development, and anti-communism as its guidelines.

The military coup of 1964 was supported by José de Magalhães Pinto, Adhemar de Barros, and Carlos Lacerda (who had already participated in the conspiracy to depose Getúlio Vargas in 1945), then governors of the states of Minas Gerais, São Paulo, and Guanabara, respectively. The U.S. State Department supported the coup through Operation Brother Sam and thereafter supported the regime through its embassy in Brasília.

The dictatorship reached the height of its popularity in the early 1970s with the so-called &quot;Brazilian Miracle&quot;, even as the regime censored all media, and tortured, killed and exiled dissidents. João Figueiredo became president in March 1979; in the same year he passed the Amnesty Law for political crimes committed for and against the regime. While combating the &quot;hardliners&quot; inside the government and supporting a redemocratization policy, Figueiredo could not control the crumbling economy, chronic inflation and concurrent fall of other military dictatorships in South America. Amid massive popular demonstrations on the streets of the main cities of the country, the first free elections in 20 years were held for the national legislature in 1982. In 1985, another election was held, this time to indirectly elect a new president, being contested between civilian candidates for the first time since the 1960s and won by the opposition. In 1988, a new Constitution was passed and Brazil officially returned to democracy.

Brazil&#x27;s military government provided a model for other military regimes and dictatorships throughout Latin America, being systematized by the so-called &quot;National Security Doctrine&quot;, which was used to justify the military&#x27;s actions as operating in the interest of national security in a time of crisis, creating an intellectual basis upon which other military regimes relied. In 2014, nearly 30 years after the regime collapsed, the Brazilian military recognized for the first time the excesses committed by its agents during the dictatorship, including the torture and murder of political dissidents. In May 2018, the United States government released a memorandum, written by Henry Kissinger, dating back to April 1974 (when he was serving as Secretary of State), confirming that the leadership of the Brazilian military regime was fully aware of the killing of dissidents. It is estimated that 434 people were either confirmed killed or went missing and 20,000 people were tortured during the military dictatorship in Brazil. While some human rights activists and others assert that the true figure could be much higher, and should include thousands of indigenous people who died because of the regime&#x27;s negligence, the armed forces have always disputed this.

==Background==

Brazil&#x27;s political crisis stemmed from the way in which the political tensions had been controlled in the 1930s and 1940s during the Vargas Era. Vargas&#x27; dictatorship and the presidencies of his democratic successors marked different stages of Brazilian populism (1930–1964), an era of economic nationalism, state-guided modernization, and import substitution trade policies. Vargas&#x27; policies were intended to foster an autonomous capitalist development in Brazil, by linking industrialization to nationalism, a formula based on a strategy of reconciling the conflicting interests of the middle class, foreign capital, the working class, and the landed oligarchy.

Essentially, this was the epic of the rise and fall of Brazilian populism from 1930 to 1964: Brazil witnessed over the course of this time period the change from export-orientation of the First Brazilian Republic (1889–1930) to the import substitution of the populist era (1930–1964) and then to a moderate structuralism of 1964–80. Each of these structural changes forced a realignment in society and caused a period of political crisis. A period of right-wing military dictatorship marked the transition between the populist era and the current period of democratization.

The Brazilian Armed Forces acquired great political clout after the Paraguayan War. The politicization of the Armed Forces was evidenced by the Proclamation of the Republic, which overthrew the Brazilian Empire, or within tenentism (lieutenants&#x27; movement) and the Revolution of 1930. Tensions escalated again in the 1950s, as important military circles (the &quot;hard-liners&quot;, old positivists whose origins could be traced back to the Brazilian Integralist Action and the Estado Novo) joined the elite and middle classes, and right-wing activists in attempts to prevent presidents Juscelino Kubitschek and João Goulart from taking office due to their supposed support for Communism. While Kubitschek proved to be friendly to capitalist institutions, Goulart promised far-reaching reforms, expropriated business interests, and promoted economical-political neutrality with the United States.

After Goulart suddenly assumed power in 1961, society became deeply polarized, with the elites fearing that Brazil would, like Cuba, join the Communist Bloc, while many thought that the reforms would greatly boost Brazil&#x27;s growth and end its economical subservience with the U.S., or even that Goulart could be used to increase the popularity of the Communist agenda. Influential politicians, such as Carlos Lacerda and even Kubitschek, media moguls (Roberto Marinho, Octávio Frias, Júlio de Mesquita Filho), the Church, landowners, businessmen, and the middle class called for a coup d&#x27;état by the Armed Forces to remove the government. The old &quot;hard-line&quot; army officers, seeing a chance to impose their economic programme, convinced the loyalists that Goulart was a Communist menace.

==Goulart and the fall of the Fourth Republic==
After the presidency of Juscelino Kubitschek, the right wing opposition elected Jânio Quadros, who based his electoral campaign on criticizing Kubitschek and government corruption. Quadros&#x27; campaign symbol was a broom, with which he would &quot;sweep away the corruption&quot;. In his brief tenure as president, Quadros made moves to resume relations with Socialist countries and approved controversial laws, but without legislative support, he could not follow his agenda.

In the last days of August 1961, Quadros tried to break his impasse with Congress by resigning from the presidency, apparently with the intention of being reinstated by popular demand. Quadros&#x27; vice president, João Goulart, was a member of the Brazilian Labour Party and had been active in politics since the Vargas Era. At that time, Brazil&#x27;s president and vice president were elected from different party tickets. With Quadros&#x27; resignation, the high ranking military ministers tried to prevent Goulart, who was on a trip to China, from assuming the presidency, accusing him of being a Communist. The military&#x27;s actions triggered the Legality Campaign in support of Goulart. The crisis was solved by the &quot;parliamentary solution&quot;, a political compromise in which Goulart would take office, but with reduced powers by turning Brazil into a parliamentary republic with a prime minister, which was filled by Tancredo Neves.

Brazil returned to presidential government in 1963 after a referendum, and, as Goulart&#x27;s powers grew, it became evident that he would seek to implement his &quot;base reforms&quot; such as land reform and nationalization of enterprises in various economic sectors. The reforms were considered Communist and Goulart sought to implement them regardless of assent from established institutions such as Congress. 

Goulart had low parliamentarian support, due to the fact that his centrist attempts to win support from both sides of the spectrum gradually came to alienate both. Over time, the president was forced to shift to the left of his mentor Getúlio Vargas and was forced to mobilize the working class and even the peasantry amid falling urban bourgeois support. 

On 1 April 1964, after a night of conspiracy, rebel troops led by general Olímpio Mourão Filho made their way to Rio de Janeiro, considered a legalist bastion. São Paulo&#x27;s and Rio de Janeiro&#x27;s generals were convinced to join the coup. In order to prevent a civil war and knowing that the United States would openly support the rebels, Goulart fled to Rio Grande do Sul, and then went to exile in Uruguay, where his family owned large estates.

===United States involvement===
The U.S. ambassador Lincoln Gordon later admitted that the embassy had given money to anti-Goulart candidates in the 1962 municipal elections, and had encouraged the plotters; many extra U.S. military and intelligence personnel were operating in four U.S. Navy oil tankers and the aircraft carrier USS &quot;Forrestal&quot;, in an operation code-named Brother Sam. These ships had positioned off the coast of Rio de Janeiro in case rebel Brazilian troops required military assistance during the 1964 coup. A document from Gordon in 1963 to U.S. president John F. Kennedy also describes the ways João Goulart should be put down, and his fears of a communist intervention supported by the Soviets or by Cuba.

Washington immediately recognized the new government in 1964, and hailed the coup as one of the &quot;democratic forces&quot; that had allegedly staved off the hand of international communism. American mass media outlets such as Henry Luce&#x27;s &quot;Time&quot; magazine also gave positive remarks about the dissolution of political parties and salary controls at the beginning of Castelo Branco&#x27;s term. According to Vincent Bevins, the military dictatorship established in Brazil, the fifth most populous nation in the world, &quot;played a crucial role in pushing the rest of South America into the pro-Washington, anticommunist group of nations.&quot;

Brazil actively participated in the CIA-backed state terror campaign against left-wing dissidents known as Operation Condor.
===The alleged Communist threat===
The argument used to justify the establishment of a military dictatorship in Brazil was the imminence of a &quot;Communist threat&quot; in 1964. The historian disputes the assertion that communism was of sufficient strength in Brazil to threaten the democratic system in 1964. In an interview, Motta stated that:

Instead, Motta argued that the assertion of a &quot;Communist threat&quot; was fabricated to unify the Brazilian armed forces and increase their support among the general population.

&quot;The Intercept&quot; reported that the asserted threat of Jango&#x27;s &quot;guerrillas&quot;, the weapons in possession of the Peasant Leagues, and the communist infiltrations into the armed forces were nothing more than fantasy, and that the 1964 coup occurred without resistance, since &quot;there was no resistance.&quot; Moreover, the Communist armed struggles only appeared after the implementation of the dictatorship, and not before it, and in fact never put Brazilian democracy at risk.

==Divisions within the officer corps==
The armed forces&#x27; officer corps was divided between those who believed that they should confine themselves to their barracks, and the hard-liners who regarded politicians as willing to turn Brazil to Communism. The victory of the hard-liners dragged Brazil into what political scientist Juan J. Linz called &quot;an authoritarian situation&quot;. However, because the hard-liners could not ignore the counterweight opinions of their colleagues or resistance IN society, they were unable to institutionalize their agenda politically. In addition, they did not attempt to eliminate liberal constitutionalism because they feared disapproval of international opinion and damage to their alignment with the United States. The United States as bastion of anticommunism during the Cold War provided the ideology that the authoritarians used to justify their hold on power. Washington also preached liberal democracy, which forced the authoritarians to assume the contradictory position of defending democracy, while destroying it. Their concern for appearances caused them to abstain from personal dictatorship by requiring each successive general-president to hand over power to a successor.

==Establishing the regime, Castelo Branco==
The Brazilian Army could not find an acceptable civilian politician to all of the factions that supported the ouster of João Goulart. On 9 April 1964, coup leaders published the First Institutional Act, which greatly limited the civil liberties of the 1946 constitution. The act granted the president the authority to remove elected officials, dismiss civil servants, and revoke for 10 years the political rights of those found guilty of subversion or misuse of public funds. On 11 April 1964, Congress elected the Army Chief of Staff, marshal Humberto de Alencar Castelo Branco as president for the remainder of Goulart&#x27;s term.

Castelo Branco had intentions of overseeing a radical reform of the political-economic system and then returning power to elected officials. He refused to remain in power beyond the remainder of Goulart&#x27;s term or to institutionalize the military in power. However, competing demands radicalized the situation. Military hard-liners wanted a complete purge of left-wing and populist influences while civilian politicians obstructed Castelo Branco&#x27;s reforms. The latter accused him of hard-line actions to achieve his objectives, and the former accused him of leniency. On 27 October 1965, after victory of opposition candidates in two state elections, he signed the Second Institutional act which purged Congress, removed objectionable state governors and expanded president&#x27;s arbitrary powers at the expense of the legislative and judiciary branches. This gave him the latitude to repress the populist left but also provided the subsequent governments of Artur da Costa e Silva (1967–69) and Emílio Garrastazu Médici (1969–74) with a &quot;legal&quot; basis for their hard-line authoritarian rule.


Through the Institutional Acts, Castelo Branco gave the executive the unchecked ability to change the constitution and remove anyone from office as well as to have the president elected by Congress. A two-party system was created: the ruling government-backed National Renewal Alliance (ARENA) and the mild not-leftist opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) party. In the new Constitution of 1967 the name of the country was changed from United States of Brazil to the current Federative Republic of Brazil.

==Hardening of the regime, Costa e Silva==

Castelo Branco was succeeded to the presidency by general Artur da Costa e Silva who was a representative of the hard-line elements of the regime. On 13 December 1968 he signed the Fifth Institutional Act that gave the president dictatorial powers, dissolved Congress and state legislatures, suspended the constitution, and imposed censorship. On 31 August 1969 Costa e Silva suffered a stroke. Instead of his vice president, all state power was assumed by military junta, which then chose general Emílio Garrastazu Médici as the new president.

== Years of Lead, Médici ==

A hardliner, Médici sponsored the greatest human rights abuses of the regime. During his government, persecution and torture of dissidents, harassment against journalists and press censorship became ubiquitous. The succession of kidnappings of foreign ambassadors in Brazil embarrassed the military government. The anti-government demonstrations and the action of guerrilla movements generated an increase in repressive measures. Urban guerrillas from the National Liberation Action and the 8th October Revolutionary Movement were suppressed, and military operations undertaken to finish the Araguaia Guerrilla War.

The &quot;ideological frontiers&quot; of Brazilian foreign policy were reinforced. By late 1970, the official minimum wage dropped to $40 per month, reducing the purchasing power of over one-third of the Brazilian workforce—whose wages were tied to it—by about 50% compared to 1960 levels under Juscelino Kubitschek&#x27;s administration.

Nevertheless, Médici was popular, as his term was met with the largest economic growth of any Brazilian president as the Brazilian Miracle unfolded and the country won the 1970 World Cup. In 1971 Médici presented the First National Development Plan aimed at increasing the rate of economic growth, especially in remote Northeast and the Amazon. The results of his economic policy consolidated the option for the national-development model. Because of these results, the country&#x27;s foreign economic connections were transformed, allowing its international presence to be broadened.

In November 1970 federal, state, and municipal elections were held. Most of the seats were won by ARENA candidates. In 1973, an electoral college system was established and in January 1974 general Ernesto Geisel was elected to be the next president.

==Resistance==

Goulart&#x27;s fall worried many citizens. Many students, Marxists, and workers formed groups that opposed military rule. A minority of these adopted direct armed struggle, while most supported political solutions to reverse the mass suspension of human rights in the country. In the first few months after the coup, thousands of people were detained, while thousands of others were removed from their civil service or university positions.

In 1968 there was a brief relaxation of the nation&#x27;s repressive policies. Experimental artists and musicians formed the Tropicália movement during this time. However, some of the major popular musicians such as Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, for instance, were arrested, imprisoned, and exiled. Chico Buarque also left the country, in exile, to Italy.

In 1969 the 8th October Revolutionary Movement kidnapped Charles Burke Elbrick, the U.S. ambassador to Brazil. The resistance fighters demanded the release of imprisoned dissidents who were being tortured in exchange for Elbrick. The government responded by adopting more brutal measures of counter-insurgency, leading to the assassination of Carlos Marighella, a guerrilla leader, two months after Elbrick&#x27;s kidnapping. This marked the beginning of the decline of armed opposition. In 1970, Nobuo Okuchi, the Japanese consul general in Sāo Paulo, was kidnapped, while Curtis C. Cutter, the U.S. consul in Porto Alegre, was wounded in the shoulder but escaped being kidnapped. Also in 1970, Ehrenfried von Holleben, the West German ambassador, was kidnapped in Rio de Janeiro and one of his bodyguards was killed.

== Repression ==

After the military coup, the new government put forward a series of measures to strengthen its rule and weaken the opposition. The complex structure of the state&#x27;s repression reached several areas of Brazilian society, and involved the implementation of measures of censorship, persecutions, and violations of human rights.

The systematic repression during this period in the Brazilian history was dependent on and alternated between the so-called &quot;moderates&quot; (&quot;&#x27;&quot;) and &quot;hard-liners&quot; (&quot;&#x27;&quot;) in power. The most aggressive set of repressive measures took place during the period between 1968 and 1978, called the &quot;Years of Lead&quot; (&quot;&quot;). The repressive characteristic of the regime, however, was present in Brazilian society throughout the military rule.

=== Censorship ===

The mainstream media, initially cooperating with the military intervention on the eve of the coup, later opposed the government and thus fell under heavy censorship. The management of all sectors of the country&#x27;s communication was overseen by the Special Counsel of Public Relations (&#x27;) created in the beginning of 1968, while censorship was institutionalized through the Higher Counsel of Censorship (&#x27;) later on that same year.

The Higher Counsel of Censorship was overseen by the Ministry of Justice, which was in charge of analysing and revising decisions put forward by the director of the Federal Police department. The ministry was also responsible for establishing guidelines and norms to implement censorship at local levels. Institutionalized censorship affected all areas of communication in Brazilian society: newspaper, television, music, theater, and all industries related to mass communication activities, including marketing companies.

Despite the regime&#x27;s efforts to censor any and all pieces of media that could hurt the government, the population found ways to get around it as much as possible. Even though artists and journalists needed permission from the counsel to publish any piece of communication, they sometimes were able to surpass censorship barriers through unconventional ways. Musicians would rely on word play to publish songs with veiled criticisms towards the government while famous newspapers would fill in empty spaces left blank due to censored articles with random cake recipes, a way to indicate to the population that the content had been censored by the government.

===Human rights violations===

As early as 1964, the military government was already using the various forms of torture it devised systematically not only to gain information it used to crush opposition groups, but also to intimidate and silence any further potential opponents. This radically increased after 1968.

While other dictatorships in the region at the time killed more people, Brazil saw the widespread use of torture, as it also had during the Estado Novo of Getúlio Vargas. Vargas&#x27;s enforcer Filinto Müller has been named the &quot;patron of torturers&quot; in Brazil. Advisors from the United States and United Kingdom trained Brazilian forces in interrogation and torture. To extinguish its left-wing opponents, the dictatorship used arbitrary arrests, imprisonment without trials, kidnapping, and most of all, torture, which included rape and castration. The book &quot;Torture in Brazil&quot; provides accounts of only a fraction of the atrocities committed by the government.

The military government murdered hundreds of others, although this was done mostly in secret and the cause of death often falsely reported as accidental. The government occasionally dismembered and hid the bodies. French general Paul Aussaresses, a veteran of the Algerian War, came to Brazil in 1973. Aussaresses used &quot;counter-revolutionary warfare&quot; methods during the Battle of Algiers, including the systemic use of torture, executions and death flights. He later trained U.S. officers and taught military courses for Brazil&#x27;s military intelligence. He later acknowledged maintaining close links with the military.

Despite the dictatorship&#x27;s fall, no individual has been punished for the human rights violations, due to the 1979 Amnesty Law written by the members of the government who stayed in place during the transition to democracy. The law granted amnesty and impunity to any government official or citizen accused of political crimes during the dictatorship. Because of a certain &quot;cultural amnesia&quot; in Brazil, the victims have never garnered much sympathy, respect, or acknowledgement of their suffering.

Work is underway to alter the Amnesty Law, which has been condemned by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. The National Truth Commission was created in 2011 attempting to help the nation face its past and honour those who fought for democracy, and to compensate the family members of those killed or disappeared. Its work was concluded in 2014. It reported that under military regime at least 191 people were killed and 243 &quot;disappeared&quot;. The total number of deaths probably measures in the hundreds, not reaching but could be nearing one thousand, while more than 50,000 people were detained and 10,000 forced to go into exile.

According to the &quot;&quot;, the &quot;Brazilian death toll from government torture, assassination and &#x27;disappearances&#x27; for 1964–81 was [...] 333, which included 67 killed in the Araguaia guerrilla front in 1972–74&quot;. According to the Brazilian Army, 97 military and civilians were killed by terrorist and guerrilla actions made by leftist groups during the same period. In a 2014 report by Brazil&#x27;s National Truth Commission, which documented the human rights abuses of the military government, it was noted that the United States &quot;had spent years teaching the torture techniques to the Brazilian military during that period&quot;.

== Geisel government, &quot;&quot;, and 1973 oil shock ==

Retired general Ernesto Geisel (1974–79) was elected to the presidency with Médici&#x27;s approval in 1974, a year after the oil crisis. Geisel was a well-connected army general and former president of Petrobras. There had been intense behind-the-scenes maneuvering by the hard-liners against him, but also by the more moderate supporters of Castelo Branco in his support. Geisel&#x27;s older brother, Orlando Geisel, was the Minister of Army, and his close ally, general João Batista Figueiredo, was chief of Médici&#x27;s military staff. Once in power, Geisel adopted a more moderate stance with regard to political opposition than his predecessor Médici.

===Decompression policy===

Although not immediately understood by civilians, Ernesto Geisel&#x27;s accession signaled a move toward a less oppressive rule. He replaced several regional commanders with trusted officers and labeled his political programmes &quot;&#x27;&quot; (opening) and &#x27; (decompression), meaning a gradual relaxation of authoritarian rule. It would be, in his words, &quot;the maximum of development possible with the minimum of indispensable security&quot;.

Together with his Chief of Staff, minister Golbery do Couto e Silva, Geisel devised a plan of gradual, slow democratization that would eventually succeed despite threats and opposition from the hard-liners. However, the torture of the regime&#x27;s left-wing and Communist opponents by DOI-CODI was still ongoing as demonstrated by the murder of Vladimir Herzog.

Geisel allowed the opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) to run an almost free election campaign before the November 1974 elections, and the MDB won more votes than ever. When the opposition MDB party won more seats in the 1976 Congress elections, Geisel used the powers granted to him by AI-5 to dismiss Congress in April 1977, and introduced a new set of laws (April Package), that made gubernatorial elections indirect and created an electoral college for electing the next president, thus safeguarding ARENA positions.

In 1977 and 1978 the presidential succession issue caused further political confrontation with the hard-liners. In October 1977 Geisel suddenly dismissed the far-right Minister of the Army, general Sylvio Frota, who had tried to become a candidate for the next presidency. In May 1978 Geisel had to deal with the first labour strikes since 1964. Over 500,000 workers led by the future president Lula da Silva demanded and won a 11% wage increase.

By the end of his presidency Geisel had allowed exiled citizens to return, restored habeas corpus, repealed the extraordinary powers, ended the Fifth Institutional Act in December 1978, and imposed general João Figueiredo as his successor in March 1979.

===Economy===
Geisel sought to maintain the high economic growth rates of the Brazilian Miracle which were tied to maintaining the prestige of the regime, even while seeking to deal with the effects of the 1973 oil crisis. Geisel removed the long-time Minister of Finance Antônio Delfim Netto. He maintained massive state investments in infrastructure—motorways, telecommunications, hydroelectric dams, mineral extraction, factories, and nuclear energy. All this required more international borrowing and increased state debt.

Fending off nationalist objections, he opened Brazil to oil prospecting by foreign firms for the first time since the early 1950s. Geisel also tried to reduce Brazil&#x27;s reliance on oil by signing a US$10 billion agreement with West Germany to build eight nuclear reactors in Brazil. During this time, an ethanol production initiative was promoted as an alternative to gasoline and the first ethanol fueled cars were produced in the country.

Brazil suffered drastic reductions in its terms of trade as a result of the oil crisis. In the early 1970s, the performance of the export sector was undermined by an overvalued currency. With the trade balance under pressure, the oil shock led to a sharply higher import bill. Thus, the Geisel government borrowed billions of dollars to see Brazil through the oil crisis. This strategy was effective in promoting growth, but it also raised Brazil&#x27;s import requirements markedly, increasing the already large current-account deficit. The current account was financed by running up the foreign debt. The expectation was that the combined effects of import substitution industrialization and export expansion eventually would bring about growing trade surpluses, allowing the service and repayment of the foreign debt.

Brazil shifted its foreign policy to meet its economic needs. &quot;Responsible pragmatism&quot; replaced strict alignment with the United States and a worldview based on ideological frontiers and blocs of nations. Because Brazil was 80% dependent on imported oil, Geisel shifted the country from uncritical support of Israel to a more neutral stance on Middle Eastern affairs. His government also recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China and the new socialist governments of Angola and Mozambique, both former Portuguese colonies. The government moved closer to Latin America, Europe, and Japan.

Brazil&#x27;s intention to build nuclear reactors with West Germany&#x27;s help created tensions with the U.S. which did not want to see a nuclear Brazil. After the election of Jimmy Carter as president, a greater emphasis was put on human rights. The new Harkin Amendment limited American military assistance to countries with human rights violations. Brazilian right-wingers and military viewed this as an incursion on Brazilian sovereignty and Geisel renounced any future military aid from the United States in April 1977.

==Transition to democracy, Figueiredo==

President João Figueiredo steered the country back to democracy and promoted the transfer of power to civilian rule, facing opposition from hardliners in the military. Figueiredo was an army general and former head of the secret service, the National Information Service.

As president, Figueiredo continued the gradual &quot;abertura&quot;&quot; process that had begun in 1974. The Amnesty Law, signed by Figueiredo on 28 August 1979, amnestied those convicted of &quot;political&quot; or &quot;related&quot; crimes between 1961 and 1978. In the early 1980s, the military regime could no longer effectively maintain the two-party system established in 1966. The Figueiredo administration dissolved the government-controlled ARENA and allowed new parties to be formed. The president was often incapacitated by illness and took two prolonged leaves for health treatment in 1981 and 1983, but the civilian vice president Aureliano Chaves did not enjoy major political power.

In 1981 Congress enacted a law on the restoration of direct elections of state governors. The general election of 1982 brought a narrow victory to ARENA&#x27;s successor, pro-government Democratic Social Party (43.22% of the vote), while the opposition Brazilian Democratic Movement Party received 42.96% of votes. The governorship of three major states, São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, and Minas Gerais, was won by the opposition.

However, the political developments were overshadowed by increasing economic problems. As inflation and unemployment soared, the foreign debt reached massive proportions making Brazil the world&#x27;s biggest debtor, owing about US$90 billion to international lenders. The austerity measures imposed by the government brought no signs of recovery for the Brazilian economy.

In 1984, the movement known as &quot;&quot; took over the country and epitomized the newly regained freedoms of assembly and expression, but the movement&#x27;s primary objective was not attained, and the 1985 presidential election was held indirectly, via a selected electoral college. The opposition vigorously struggled for passing a constitutional amendment that would allow direct popular presidential elections in November 1984, but the proposal failed to win passage in Congress. The opposition candidate Tancredo Neves succeeded Figueiredo when Congress held an election for the new president.

==Foreign relations==


During this period Brazil&#x27;s international agenda incorporated new perceptions. With nationalist military — who were state-control devotees — in power, there was increased energy for questioning the disparities of the international system. Interest in expanding state presence in the economy was accompanied by policies intended to transform Brazil&#x27;s profile abroad. The relationship with the United States was still valued, but policy alignment was no longer total. Connections between Brazilian international activity and its economic interests led foreign policy, conducted by foreign minister José de Magalhães Pinto (1966–67), to be labeled &quot;Prosperity Diplomacy&quot;.
This new emphasis of Brazil&#x27;s international policy was followed by an appraisal of relations maintained with the United States in the previous years. It was observed that the attempted strengthening of ties had yielded limited benefits. A revision of the Brazilian ideological stand within the world system was added to this perception. This state of affairs was further enhanced by the momentary relaxation of the bipolar confrontation during détente.

In this context, it became possible to think of substituting the concept of limited sovereignty for full sovereignty. Development was made a priority for Brazilian diplomacy. These conceptual transformations were supported by the younger segments of Itamaraty (Ministry of External Relations), identified with the tenets of the Independent Foreign Policy adopted by country in the early 1960s.

Based on the priorities of its foreign policy, Brazil adopted new positions in various international organizations. Its performance at the II Conference of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 1968, in defence of non-discriminatory and preferential treatment for underdeveloped countries&#x27; manufactured goods, was noteworthy. The same level of concern distinguished the Brazilian stand at the Economic Commission for Latin America (ECLA) meeting in Viña del Mar in 1969. On this occasion, Brazil voiced its support of a Latin American union project.

In the security sphere, disarmament was defended and the joint control system of the two superpowers condemned. Brazil was particularly critical of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, with a view to guarantee the right to develop its own nuclear technology. This prerogative had already been defended previously, when the Brazilian government decided not to accept the validity of the Treaty for the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons (TNP) in Latin America and the Caribbean. Brazil&#x27;s position on the TNP became emblematic of the negative posture that it would, from then onwards, sustain regarding the power politics of the United States and the Soviet Union. Its initial detailing was influenced by the presence of João Augusto de Araújo Castro as ambassador to the UN and president of the Security Council in the years 1968–69. Brazil tried to strengthen its position with nuclear cooperation negotiated settlements with countries such as Israel (1966), France (1967), India (1968) and the United States (1972).

The changes in Brazilian diplomacy were to be also reflected in other matters on the international agenda, such as the moderate stance taken with regard to the &quot;Six-Day War&quot; between Arabs and Israelis. In the multilateral sphere, the country championed the cause of the reform of the United Nations Organization charter.

The expansion of Brazil&#x27;s international agenda coincided with the administrative reform of the Ministry of External Relations. Its move to Brasília in 1971 was followed by internal modernization. New departments were created, responding to the diversification of the international agenda and the increasing importance of economic diplomacy. Examples include the creation of a trade promotion system (1973) and the Alexandre de Gusmão Foundation (1971) to develop studies and research foreign policy.

Foreign policy during the Gibson Barboza mandate (1969–74) united three basic positions. The first one, ideological, defended the existence of military governments in Latin America. To achieve that, the Organization of American States fought terrorism in the region. The second one criticized the distension process between the two superpowers, condemning the effects of American and Soviet power politics. The third requested support for development, considering that Brazil, with all its economic potential, deserved greater responsibility within the international system.

New demands and intentions appeared, related to the idea that the nation was strengthening its bargaining power in the world system. At international forums, its main demand became &quot;collective economic security&quot;. The endeavor to lead Third World countries made Brazil value multilateral diplomacy. Efforts in this direction can be observed at the UN Conference on Environment (1972), the GATT meeting in Tokyo (1973) and the Law of the Sea Conference (1974).

This new Brazilian stance served as a base for the revival of its relationship with the United States. Differentiation from other Latin American countries was sought, to mean special treatment from the United States. Nevertheless, not only was this expectation not fulfilled but military assistance and the MEC-USAID educational cooperation agreement were interrupted.

Washington remained aloof at the time of President Médici&#x27;s visit to the United States in 1971. In response, especially in the military and diplomatic spheres, nationalist ideas were kindled and raised questions about the alignment policy with the United States.

The presence of J.A. de Araújo Castro as ambassador to Washington contributed to the re-definition of relations with the American government. The strategic move was to try to expand the negotiation agenda by paying special attention to the diversification of trade relations, the beginning of nuclear cooperation, and the inclusion of new international policy themes.

In 1971 the military dictatorship helped rig Uruguayan elections, which &quot;Frente Amplio&quot;, a left-wing political party, lost. The government participated in Operation Condor, which involved various Latin American security services (including Pinochet&#x27;s DINA and the Argentine SIDE) in the assassination of political opponents.

During this period, Brazil began to devote more attention to less-developed countries. Technical cooperation programmes were initiated in Latin America and in Africa, accompanied in some cases by state company investment projects – in particular in the fields of energy and communication. With this pretext, an inter-ministerial system was created by Itamaraty and the Ministry of Planning, whose function was to select and coordinate international cooperation projects. To foster these innovations, in 1972 foreign minister Gibson Barboza visited Senegal, Togo, Ghana, Dahomey, Gabon, Zaïre, Nigeria, Cameroon, and Côte d&#x27;Ivoire.

However, the prospect of economic interests and the establishment of cooperation programmes with these countries was not followed by a revision of the Brazilian position on the colonial issue. Traditional loyalty was still with Portugal. Attempts were made to consolidate the creation of a Portuguese-Brazilian community.

<text>Mitcham Railway Station is located on the Belair line in Adelaide. Situated 8.5 kilometres from Adelaide station, it is in the suburb of Lower Mitcham.

== History ==

Mitcham station opened in March 1883 with the opening of the Adelaide to Aldgate section of the Adelaide-Melbourne line. It was originally planned to call the station Lower Mitcham but the name was changed prior to opening. It was previously served by the &quot;Melbourne Express&quot;. Mitcham previously was a junction for lines to Clapham and Sleeps Hill. It is currently a stop on the Belair suburban commuter line. Mitcham and Blackwood are the only stations between Goodwood and Belair to have more than one platform in use.

In 1995, as part of the One Nation Adelaide-Melbourne line gauge conversion project, the third platform on the station&#x27;s western side was converted to standard gauge.

The Mitcham railway station garden, known as Nellie&#x27;s Garden, is named in honour of Nellie Iris Ellis (1920-1983) who established the garden. Mrs Ellis was the wife of a former stationmaster. The garden is maintained by volunteers and is one of only five public gardens provided by the City of Mitcham.

In 2019, portions of &quot;Escape from Pretoria&quot;, a 2020 Australian prison film, was shot at the station and Nellie&#x27;s Garden. During this time, trains did not stop at Mitcham.

<text>Nepenthes albomarginata is a tropical pitcher plant native to Borneo, Peninsular Malaysia, and Sumatra.

The specific epithet &quot;albomarginata&quot;, formed from the Latin words &quot;albus&quot; (white) and &quot;marginatus&quot; (margin), refers to the white band of trichomes that is characteristic of this species.

==Botanical history==

&quot;Nepenthes albomarginata&quot; was first collected by Thomas Lobb in 1848. It was formally described a year later by John Lindley in &quot;The Gardeners&#x27; Chronicle&quot;.

The species was introduced into cultivation in the United Kingdom in 1856.
In the 1996 book &quot;Pitcher-Plants of Borneo&quot;, &quot;N. albomarginata&quot; is given the vernacular name white-collared pitcher-plant. This name, along with all others, was dropped from the much-expanded second edition, published in 2008.

==Description==

&quot;Nepenthes albomarginata&quot; is a climbing plant. The stem may reach lengths of up to and is up to in diameter. Internodes are cylindrical in cross section and up to long.

Leaves are in texture. The lamina or leaf blade is in shape and up to long by wide. It has an acute apex and its base is gradually and . The leaves of this species are characteristic in that they completely lack a petiole. Longitudinal veins are indistinct. Tendrils are up to long.

Rosette and lower pitchers are bulbous in the basal third and cylindrical above. They are relatively small, reaching only in height by in width. A pair of fringed wings up to wide runs down the front of each pitcher. The pitcher mouth is round and rises to form a short neck at the rear. The peristome is cylindrical in cross section, up to wide, and bears indistinct teeth. The inner portion of the peristome accounts for around 34% of its total cross-sectional surface length. A dense band of short white trichomes is present directly below the peristome, although these may be missing from pitchers that have caught termites. The glandular region covers the bulbous portion of the pitcher&#x27;s inner surface. The lid or operculum is and lacks appendages. An unbranched spur (≤ long) is inserted near the base of the lid.

Upper pitchers are similar to their lower counterparts in most respects. They are cylindrical- throughout and have a pair of ribs in place of wings.

&quot;Nepenthes albomarginata&quot; has a racemose inflorescence that is usually longer in male plants. The peduncle is up to long, while the rachis reaches lengths of up to . Partial peduncles are one- or two-flowered, up to long, and lack a bract. Sepals are to oblong in shape and up to long. A study of 120 pollen samples taken from a herbarium specimen (&quot;J.H.Adam 2417&quot;, collected in Borneo at an altitude of ) found the mean pollen diameter to be (SE = 0.4; CV = 6.2%).

Most parts of the plant are covered in a dense indumentum of very short, white hairs. However, the underside of the lamina bears a dense covering of long hairs.

==Ecology==
&quot;Nepenthes albomarginata&quot; is a widespread species, occurring in Borneo, Peninsular Malaysia, and Sumatra. It is also found on smaller islands such as Nias and Penang. It has an altitudinal distribution of 0–1200 m above sea level.
Its typical habitat consists of &quot;kerangas&quot; forest, but it has also been recorded from the summit vegetation of lowland peaks. It is known from peat and limestone substrates.

==Carnivory==
&quot;Nepenthes albomarginata&quot; is notable for specializing in termites; most of the species in the genus &quot;Nepenthes&quot; are unselective about their prey. According to botanist Marlis A. Merbach and coworkers, this specialization to a single prey taxon is unique amongst carnivorous plants.

&quot;Nepenthes albomarginata&quot; has a unique morphological feature: a rim of living white trichomes directly below the peristome. The rim&#x27;s hairs tend to be missing from pitchers that have caught termites. Merbach said &quot;For several days, nothing would happen, then — after a single night — pitchers would fill with termites and their rim hairs would disappear.&quot;

Merbach investigated this phenomenon by placing fresh intact pitchers, together with pitchers with their white rims removed, near to the head of foraging columns of the termite &quot;Hospitalitermes bicolor&quot;. When the column found the pitcher, termites grazed on the rim.

While grazing, many termites (both workers and soldiers) fell into the pitchers. Once in the pitcher, they were unable to climb out. Merbach counted up to 22 individuals per minute falling into the pitchers and noted that the capture rate could easily exceed this for denser columns. After about an hour, the hairs were all gone and the pitcher was evidently no longer attractive to termites (and was filled with termites trying to escape).

It is not known how the trichomes lure termites to the plant. Merbach detected no long-range olfactory attraction during his experiments and noted that &quot;all contacts seemed to happen by chance, with termites often missing pitchers less than 1 cm away from them.&quot;

Merbach also points out that &quot;N. albomarginata&quot; is the only plant species to offer its tissue as a bait.

==Related species==

In 2001, Clarke performed a cladistic analysis of the &quot;Nepenthes&quot; species of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia using 70 morphological characteristics of each taxon. The following is a portion of the resultant cladogram, showing &quot;Clade 6&quot;, which is only weakly supported at 50%. The sister pair of &quot;N. angasanensis&quot; and &quot;N. mikei&quot; has 79% support.

===&quot;N. albomarginata&quot; × &quot;N. northiana&quot;===
&quot;Nepenthes × cincta&quot; is a rare plant and, due to the localised distribution of &quot;N. northiana&quot;, only grows at a few sites in Bau, Sarawak, usually on a substrate of limestone.

The traits of &quot;N. albomarginata&quot; are very dominant in this hybrid; the wide flared peristome of its larger parent species (&quot;N. northiana&quot;) is almost completely lost. Pitchers are narrowly (funnel-shaped) throughout and range in colour from cream to dusky purple with red or black spots.

===&quot;N. albomarginata&quot; × &quot;N. reinwardtiana&quot;===

Its natural range covers the islands Borneo and Sumatra. The type specimen was collected by Shigeo Kurata in Kenukat, West Kalimantan, in 1981. Kurata described the hybrid the following year.

<text>Porlock is a coastal village in Somerset, England, west of Minehead. At the 2011 census, the village had a population of 1,440.

In 2017, Porlock had the highest percentage of elderly population in England, with over 40% being of pensionable age as of 2010.

==History==

East of the village is Bury Castle, an Iron Age hill fort.

There is evidence for 10th or 11th century origin for the name Porlock as Portloc or Portloca meaning enclosure by the harbour, from the Old English &quot;port&quot; and &quot;loca&quot;, and in the Domesday Book the village was known as &quot;Portloc&quot;. In 914 the Vikings plundered Porlock.

Porlock was part of the hundred of Carhampton.

The area has links with several Romantic poets, and R. D. Blackmore, the author of &quot;Lorna Doone&quot;, and is popular with visitors. The visitor centre has exhibits and displays about the local area. Also on display are the bones of an aurochs, discovered on Porlock beach in 1999.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of West Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Williton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism.

Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning.

As Porlock falls within the Exmoor National Park some functions normally administered by district or county councils have, since 1997, fallen under the Exmoor National Park Authority, which is known as a &#x27;single purpose&#x27; authority, which aims to &quot;conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks&quot; and &quot;promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the Parks by the public&quot;, including responsibility for the conservation of the historic environment.

Porlock has an electoral ward called &#x27;Porlock and District&#x27; which stretches westwards to the Devon boundary, eastwards to Minehead and south to Wootton Courtenay. The total population of the ward at the 2011 census was 2,338.

It is also part of the Tiverton and Minehead county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Prior to Brexit in 2020 it was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

==Geography==

The village adjoins the Porlock Ridge and Saltmarsh nature reserve, created from the lowland behind a high shingle embankment which was breached by the sea in the 1990s, which has now been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Copses of white dead trees remind the visitor of when this was freshwater pasture.

A stream flows down a wooded combe called Hawkcombe leads about three miles (5 km) from the village up to high open moorland. The stream, called &quot;Hawkcombe Waters&quot;, runs past a Victorian hunting lodge, called The Cleeve, then underground beneath the Overstream Hotel in the centre of the village.

The South West Coast Path goes through Porlock, many walkers stopping rather than continuing the long walk to Lynton. There is also a &#x27;Coleridge Way&#x27; walk.

Culbone Church is said to be the smallest church in England. The main structure is 12th century. Services are still held there, despite the lack of road access – Culbone is a two-mile (3 km) walk from Porlock Weir, and some 3–4 miles (about 6 km) from Porlock itself.

A toll road bypasses the 1 in 4 gradient on Porlock Hill. There is the prehistoric Porlock Stone Circle on the hill.

===Submerged forest===
At low tide the remains of a submerged forest can be seen on Porlock Beach. The area was several miles inland until the sea level in the Bristol Channel rose about 7000 to 8000 years ago.

==Church==

The Church of St Dubricius dates from the 13th century. The spire was damaged in a storm of 1703. The church has been designated as a grade I listed building. Within the church is a 15th-century tomb of John Harrington who fought alongside Henry V in France in 1417.

==Cultural references==

===&quot;Person on business from Porlock&quot;===
In 1797, poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who lived nearby at Nether Stowey (between Bridgwater and Minehead), but — due to illness — had &quot;retired to a lonely farm house between Porlock and Lynton&quot;, was interrupted during composition of his poem &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; by &quot;a person on business from Porlock&quot;, and claimed he found afterwards he could not remember what had come to him in a dream.

Coleridge and William Wordsworth (who lived nearby at Alfoxden) would often roam the hills and coast on long night walks, leading to local gossip that they were &#x27;spies&#x27; for the French. The Government sent an agent to investigate, but found they were &quot;mere poets&quot;. Their walks are celebrated by the Coleridge Way which ends in Porlock. Their friend Robert Southey published a poem titled &quot;Porlock&quot; in 1798.

===William Blake===
Legend has it that the area beyond Culbone towards Lynmouth where Glenthorne is now situated is where Jesus may have alighted on a trip with Joseph of Arimathea. This is said to have inspired a passage from William Blake&#x27;s famous poem &quot;&quot;:

<text>Islington Works railway station was located on the Gawler railway line located in the inner northern Adelaide suburbs of Regency Park and Kilburn to serve the adjacent Islington Railway Workshops.

It is located from Adelaide station, but is now closed, along with the workshop. Both platforms are 50 metres in length. The station was first closed in 2000, with all trains running express, and demolished in 2020, due to the Gawler line electrification project.

To the west of the station lies the Australian Rail Track Corporation Adelaide-Crystal Brook line.

<text>In statistics, &quot;G&quot;-tests are likelihood-ratio or maximum likelihood statistical significance tests that are increasingly being used in situations where chi-squared tests were previously recommended.

==Formulation==
The general formula for &quot;G&quot; is
:formula_1

where formula_2 is the observed count in a cell, formula_3 is the expected count under the null hypothesis, formula_4 denotes the natural logarithm, and the sum is taken over all non-empty cells. The resulting formula_5 is chi-squared distributed.

Furthermore, the total observed count should be equal to the total expected count:formula_6where formula_7 is the total number of observations.

===Derivation===
We can derive the value of the &quot;G&quot;-test from the log-likelihood ratio test where the underlying model is a multinomial model.

Suppose we had a sample formula_8 where each formula_9 is the number of times that an object of type formula_10 was observed. Furthermore, let formula_11 be the total number of objects observed. If we assume that the underlying model is multinomial, then the test statistic is defined byformula_12where formula_13 is the null hypothesis and formula_14 is the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of the parameters given the data. Recall that for the multinomial model, the MLE of formula_15 given some data is defined byformula_16Furthermore, we may represent each null hypothesis parameter formula_17 asformula_18Thus, by substituting the representations of formula_13 and formula_20 in the log-likelihood ratio, the equation simplifies toformula_21Relabel the variables formula_22 with formula_23 and formula_9 with formula_25. Finally, multiply by a factor of formula_26 (used to make the G test formula asymptotically equivalent to the Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test formula) to achieve the form

formula_27

Heuristically, one can imagine formula_28 as continuous and approaching zero, in which case formula_29 and terms with zero observations can simply be dropped. However the &quot;expected&quot; count in each cell must be strictly greater than zero for each cell (formula_30) to apply the method.

==Distribution and use==
Given the null hypothesis that the observed frequencies result from random sampling from a distribution with the given expected frequencies, the distribution of &quot;G&quot; is approximately a chi-squared distribution, with the same number of degrees of freedom as in the corresponding chi-squared test.

For very small samples the multinomial test for goodness of fit, and Fisher&#x27;s exact test for contingency tables, or even Bayesian hypothesis selection are preferable to the &quot;G&quot;-test. McDonald recommends to always use an exact test (exact test of goodness-of-fit, Fisher&#x27;s exact test) if the total sample size is less than 1 000 .
:There is nothing magical about a sample size of 1 000, it&#x27;s just a nice round number that is well within the range where an exact test, chi-square test, and &quot;G&quot;–test will give almost identical  values. Spreadsheets, web-page calculators, and SAS shouldn&#x27;t have any problem doing an exact test on a sample size of 1 000 .
:::: — John H. McDonald

&quot;G&quot;-tests have been recommended at least since the 1981 edition of &quot;Biometry&quot;, a statistics textbook by Robert R. Sokal and F. James Rohlf.

==Relation to other metrics==

===Relation to the chi-squared test===
The commonly used chi-squared tests for goodness of fit to a distribution and for independence in contingency tables are in fact approximations of the log-likelihood ratio on which the &quot;G&quot;-tests are based.

The general formula for Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test statistic is
:formula_31

The approximation of &quot;G&quot; by chi squared is obtained by a second order Taylor expansion of the natural logarithm around 1 (see #Derivation (chi-squared) below).
We have formula_32 when the observed counts formula_28 are close to the expected counts formula_34 When this difference is large, however, the formula_35 approximation begins to break down. Here, the effects of outliers in data will be more pronounced, and this explains the why formula_35 tests fail in situations with little data. 

For samples of a reasonable size, the &quot;G&quot;-test and the chi-squared test will lead to the same conclusions. However, the approximation to the theoretical chi-squared distribution for the &quot;G&quot;-test is better than for the Pearson&#x27;s chi-squared test. In cases where formula_37 for some cell case the &quot;G&quot;-test is always better than the chi-squared test.

For testing goodness-of-fit the &quot;G&quot;-test is infinitely more efficient than the chi squared test in the sense of Bahadur, but the two tests are equally efficient in the sense of Pitman or in the sense of Hodges and Lehmann.

====Derivation (chi-squared)====
Consider 
:formula_38 
and let formula_39 with formula_40 so that the total number of counts remains the same. Upon substitution we find,
:formula_41 
A Taylor expansion around formula_42 can be performed using formula_43. The result is
:formula_44 and distributing terms we find,
:formula_45 
Now, using the fact that formula_46 and formula_47 we can write the result,
:formula_48

===Relation to Kullback–Leibler divergence===
The &quot;G&quot;-test statistic is proportional to the Kullback–Leibler divergence of the theoretical distribution from the empirical distribution:

:formula_49

where &quot;N&quot; is the total number of observations and formula_50 and formula_51 are the empirical and theoretical frequencies, respectively.

===Relation to mutual information===
For analysis of contingency tables the value of &quot;G&quot; can also be expressed in terms of mutual information.

Let
:formula_52 , formula_53 , formula_54, and formula_55.

Then &quot;G&quot; can be expressed in several alternative forms:

:formula_56

:formula_57

:formula_58

where the entropy of a discrete random variable formula_59 is defined as
:formula_60
and where
:formula_61
is the mutual information between the row vector &quot;r&quot; and the column vector &quot;c&quot; of the contingency table.

It can also be shown that the inverse document frequency weighting commonly used for text retrieval is an approximation of &quot;G&quot; applicable when the row sum for the query is much smaller than the row sum for the remainder of the corpus. Similarly, the result of Bayesian inference applied to a choice of single multinomial distribution for all rows of the contingency table taken together versus the more general alternative of a separate multinomial per row produces results very similar to the &quot;G&quot; statistic.

==Application==
* The McDonald–Kreitman test in statistical genetics is an application of the &quot;G&quot;-test.
* Dunning introduced the test to the computational linguistics community where it is now widely used.
* The R-scape program (used by Rfam) uses G-test to detect co-variation between RNA sequence alignment positions.

==Statistical software==
* In R fast implementations can be found in the AMR and Rfast packages. For the AMR package, the command is codice_1 which works exactly like codice_2 from base R. R also has the likelihood.test function in the Deducer package. Note: Fisher&#x27;s &quot;G&quot;-test in the GeneCycle Package of the R programming language (codice_3) does not implement the &quot;G&quot;-test as described in this article, but rather Fisher&#x27;s exact test of Gaussian white-noise in a time series.
* Another R implementation to compute the G statistic and corresponding p-values is provided by the R package entropy. The commands are codice_4 for the standard G statistic and the associated p-value and codice_5 for the G statistic applied to comparing joint and product distributions to test independence.
* In SAS, one can conduct &quot;G&quot;-test by applying the codice_6 option after the codice_7.
* In Stata, one can conduct a &quot;G&quot;-test by applying the codice_8 option after the codice_9 command.
* In Java, use codice_10.
* In Python, use codice_11 with codice_12.

<doc id="914821" wikidata="Q2984458" url="?curid=914821" title="List of quasars">
<text>This article contains lists of quasars. More than a million quasars have been observed, so any list on Wikipedia is necessarily a selection of them.

Proper naming of quasars are by Catalogue Entry, Qxxxx±yy using B1950 coordinates, or QSO Jxxxx±yyyy using J2000 coordinates. They may also use the prefix QSR. There are currently no quasars that are visible to the naked eye.

==List of quasars==
This is a list of exceptional quasars for characteristics otherwise not separately listed


==List of named quasars==
This is a list of quasars, with a common name, instead of a designation from a survey, catalogue or list.

==List of multiply imaged quasars==
This is a list of quasars that as a result of gravitational lensing appear as multiple images on Earth.

==List of visual quasar associations==
This is a list of double quasars, triple quasars, and the like, where quasars are close together in line-of-sight, but not physically related.

==List of physical quasar groups==
This is a list of binary quasars, trinary quasars, and the like, where quasars are physically close to each other.

===Large Quasar Groups===

Large quasar groups (LQGs) are bound to a filament of mass, and not directly bound to each other.

==List of quasars with apparent superluminal jet motion==
This is a list of quasars with jets that appear to be superluminal due to relativistic effects and line-of-sight orientation. Such quasars are sometimes referred to as &quot;superluminal quasars&quot;.

Quasars that have a recessional velocity greater than the speed of light (&quot;c&quot;) are very common. Any quasar with z &gt; 1 is receding faster than &quot;c&quot;, while z exactly equal to 1 indicates recession at the speed of light. Early attempts to explain superluminal quasars resulted in convoluted explanations with a limit of z = 2.326, or in the extreme z &lt; 2.4. The majority of quasars lie between z = 2 and z = 5.

==Firsts==
==Extremes==
==First quasars found==

==Most distant quasars==

In 1964 a quasar became the most distant object in the universe for the first time. Quasars would remain the most distant objects in the universe until 1997, when a pair of non-quasar galaxies would take the title (galaxies CL 1358+62 G1 &amp; CL 1358+62 G2 lensed by galaxy cluster CL 1358+62).

In cosmic scales distance is usually indicated by redshift (denoted by &quot;z&quot;) which is a measure of &quot;recessional velocity&quot; and inferred distance due to cosmological expansion.

<doc id="914823" wikidata="Q17149240" url="?curid=914823" title="Machine head">
<text>A machine head (also referred to as a tuning machine, tuner, or gear head) is a geared apparatus for tuning stringed musical instruments by adjusting string tension. Machine heads are used on mandolins, guitars, double basses and others, and are usually located on the instrument&#x27;s headstock. Other names for guitar tuners include pegs, gears, machines, cranks, knobs, tensioners and tighteners.

Non-geared tuning devices as used on violins, violas, cellos, lutes, older Flamenco guitars and ukuleles are known as friction pegs, which hold the string to tension by way of friction caused by their tapered shape and by the string pull created by the tight string.

== Construction and action ==
Traditionally, a single machine head consists of a cylinder or capstan, mounted at the center of a pinion gear, a knob or &quot;button&quot; and a worm gear that links them. The capstan has a hole through the far end from the gear, and the string is made to go through that hole, and is wrapped around the capstan. To complete the string installation, the string is tightened by turning the capstan using the tuning knob. The worm gear ensures that the capstan cannot turn without a movement on the knob; it also allows precise tuning.

Banjos usually employ a different mechanism using planetary gears - in this case, the knob and the capstan both rotate on the same axis. A few guitars (e.g. the original Gibson Firebird, early Gibson basses and Mario Maccaferri&#x27;s plastic instruments) have used this design.

The guitarist adjusts the tension of the various strings using the knobs so that they are correctly tuned: a higher tension yields a sharper pitch, a lower tension a flatter pitch. Typical tensions for steel-string acoustic guitars with &quot;light&quot; tension strings are 10.5 kgf (23.3 lbf, 103 N) to 13.8 kgf (30.2 lbf, 135 N).

== Varieties ==
Several kinds of machine head apparatus exist:
* on classical guitars (with nylon strings), the worm gears are generally exposed; the strings are wound on the pins inside grooves in the head;
* on modern steel-string guitars, including &quot;folk&quot; acoustic and electric guitars, the worm gears are generally placed in individual sealed enclosures with permanent lubrication, although budget models may have exposed gears fixed on plates housing a row of gears. Vintage and vintage-reproduction guitars frequently have individual open-gear tuners, enclosed tuners not having become common until after WWII. Several machine head placements are possible, depending on the shape of the headstock:
** rectangular head, 2 rows of 3 pins (or 6 pins for 12-string guitars): found on most &quot;Folk&quot; and &quot;Jazz&quot; guitars and on Gibson Les Paul guitars;
** a single diagonal row of 6 pins: found on Fender Telecaster and Stratocaster guitars;
** one diagonal row of four pins and one diagonal row of two pins: found on Music Man guitars;
* on bass guitars, where string tension is extremely high, larger, heavier-duty machine heads than those used on guitars are used. Bass tuners generally feature larger knobs than guitar tuners as well; often these are distinctively shaped, and known as &quot;elephant ears&quot;. Gear ratios of 20:1 are used often. Exposed gears are much more common in premium bass guitars than in six-string non-bass instruments.

On some guitars, such as those with Floyd Rose bridge, string tuning may be also conducted using &quot;microtuning&quot; tuners incorporated into the guitar bridge.

Likewise, &#x27;headless&#x27; guitars and basses, notably those designed by Steinberger and their licensed imitations, such as the Hohner Jack Bass, and unlicensed imitations such as the Washburn Bantam, have the machine heads at the body end. Steinbergers and Hohners require specialist double-ball end strings, whereas the Washburn Bantam can take regular strings.

Presently, most worm-gear tuners provide a gear ratio of 14:1. In older designs, 12:1 was common, and lower ratios as well. Lower ratios allow a replacement string to be brought more quickly up to pitch, though with less precision for fine-tuning. Lower ratios are also more forgiving of imperfect machining, and of factors that might compromise the gear surfaces (corrosion, grit, poor lubrication).

As increased precision of milling became more cost-effective, higher ratios appeared on the market, with 14:1 being the modern standard, trading accuracy against slower initial string winding. More recently, versions with an 18:1 gear ratio are available (particularly from Grover), and the Gotoh 510 offers 21:1.

===Locking tuners===
The term &quot;locking tuners&quot; has two meanings. Presently, it refers to some sort of mechanism in the string peg (usually a cam or screw) that locks the string in place, preventing slippage. With the popular increase of extreme vibrato-arm usage in the 1980s, several manufacturers introduced a modified design, commonly called &quot;locking machine heads&quot;, where the individual tuner has an additional mechanism to lock the string in place and stabilize tuning, primarily intended for musicians who make regular use of the vibrato. Some designs increase string breakage at the point they grip the string.

The term &quot;locking&quot; is much older, possibly originating with Grover, and refers to an &quot;anti-backlash&quot; design of the gears, which greatly reduced the slippage of the basic worm-and-gear system. The gear&#x27;s teeth are shaped to lock into those of the worm, with the string tension insufficient to overcome the friction between the gears. Such a design is called self-locking. Grover Rotomatics and similar designs from other manufacturers are rightly called &quot;locking tuners&quot;.

== Resistance to usage ==
Musicians playing certain instruments, most notably the violin family, (excepting the double bass) remain resistant to the use of machine heads, insisting on the continued use of friction pegs. Such factors as appearance, weight, tradition and simplicity are cited as justification, despite issues with friction pegs slipping out of tune, coming loose or jamming. In the early 2000s, tuning pegs were introduced with planetary gearing inside a friction-peg shaped casing that can be fitted to an instrument without physical alterations. While reasonably well-accepted, planetary pegs can make string changes more time-consuming.

== Innovators ==

* Cittern maker John Preston is often credited with a linear-pull tuning machine, appearing in the latter 1700s
* Johann Georg Stauffer (1778–1853) was an Austrian luthier generally credited with creating the worm-and-gear tuning machine
* the &quot;Stauffer-style&quot; tuner was brought to the United States by Christian Frederick Martin, founder of Martin Guitars (1833)
* John Kluson established a Chicago machine shop in 1925, specifically for making tuning machines, with the &quot;Kluson-style&quot; design having each mechanism enclosed in a stamped-sheetmetal shell
* A. D. Grover (1865–1927) held at least 50 patents for musical instrument parts and accessories. The company he founded (now Grover Musical Products) continued to refine the machine-head concept through the 20th century, particularly a design with the mechanism sealed in a cast-metal shell.

<text>Splodgenessabounds are an English punk rock band formed in Keston, Kent. The band is associated with the Oi! and punk pathetique genres. Their frontman is Max Splodge (born Martin Everest). They have scored three UK singles chart entries, including one Top 10 hit and a second Top 30 hit.

==Career==
The band was formed over a cab office called Baron Cars in Queens Road, Peckham. The group members are from Orpington.

The band were originally fronted by Max Splodge (formerly drummer in punk bands The Tarts and The Mistakes) and his girlfriend of the time, who was known as Baby Greensleeves. The band won a recording contract with Deram Records after finishing runner-up in the 1979 Battle of the Bands contest, even though Deram was planning to cease all activities in the music markets outside of classical music. The band&#x27;s first release for Deram in 1980 was &quot;Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please&quot;. The song consists of a man attempting to order two pints of lager and a packet of crisps from a pub, but he is repeatedly ignored. He becomes increasingly impatient, and time is called before his request is fulfilled. The song was released as a triple A side vinyl single, along with &quot;Simon Templer&quot; (a pastiche of the theme tune of the TV series, &quot;Return of the Saint&quot; featuring the character Simon Templar) and &quot;Michael Booth&#x27;s Talking Bum&quot;.

&quot;Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please&quot; was the only song from that release that picked up any airplay, first from John Peel on his BBC Radio 1 show, and later on daytime radio as a novelty song. The song peaked at No. 7 in the UK singles chart in June 1980, however the band members were unable to capitalise on their success by appearing on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, because the show was off the air due to strike action at BBC Television.

The follow-up to &quot;Two Pints of Lager and a Packet of Crisps Please&quot; was a cover version of &quot;Two Little Boys&quot; (a live version that appeared in the soundtrack to the 1981 film, &quot;Urgh! A Music War&quot;). It was a quadruple A-side, with &quot;Horse&quot;, &quot;The Butterfly Song&quot; and &quot;Sox&quot;. The initial copies of the single came with a cardboard boomerang, &#x27;guaranteed not to come back&#x27;. The band then performed on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, but the single only reached No. 26 in September 1980. Their eponymous debut album (released in January 1981 when the band was on hiatus) failed to chart.

In the band&#x27;s early days, they were noted for playing pranks. These included leaving Splodge stranded on top of a set of speakers for an entire set; supporting themselves when the support band failed to show by playing the wrong instruments badly at deafening volume levels; and a stunt where Splodge was rumoured to be held in Maidstone Prison and came on stage handcuffed to a prison officer. Splodgenessabounds&#x27; stage show sometimes went to carnivalesque extremes. Police were frequenting their concerts, due to unsubstantiated reports of public nudity and &quot;farting on demand&quot; during renditions of &quot;Michael Booth&#x27;s Talking Bum&quot;.

The group often made humorously grandiose press release claims, such as that their debut album would be a triple, including a side of &quot;old material transcribed from their own cassettes, coupled with their &#x27;Pathetic Movements Manifesto&#x27;, and including a free Christmas tree with every copy.&quot;

Splodge got back into the studio – having lost the rest of his band in 1980 – with help from the Heavy Metal Kids, whose lead singer and guitarist Gary Holton was a friend of Splodge and sometime member of Splodgenessabounds. Their single &quot;Cowpunk Medlum&quot; (a medley of the theme song of the Western film &quot;High Noon, a&quot; section of &quot;Ghost Riders in the Sky&quot; and the TV series &quot;Bonanza&quot;) reached No. 69 in June 1981, but after this, Deram terminated the band&#x27;s recording contract. Nevertheless, the new Splodgenessabounds (temporarily shortened to Splodge for legal reasons) released a follow-up single, &quot;Mouth and Trousers&quot;, along with the album &quot;In Search of the Seven Golden Gussets&quot; on the independent Razor Records. Despite the single getting good airplay and favourable reviews (being a ska song rather than their usual punk style), without the backing of Deram Records, it became the first Splodgenessabounds single to fail to chart.

A new album, &quot;A Nightmare on Rude Street&quot; was recorded in 1991, but sales and reviews were poor. Splodge continued the band with various line-ups also pursuing his career as an actor and bingo caller, as well as playing with Angelic Upstarts.

In 1999, after going for a DNA blood test, Splodge discovered he was a direct descendant of Genghis Khan. Splodge penned five songs: &quot;Genghis Khan&quot;, &quot;Lulluby of Mongolia&quot;, &quot;These Are the Things That Make the Mongols So Great&quot;, &quot;Too Mongolia&quot; and &quot;Mongols on the Streets of London&quot; (written with Mat Sargent of Sham 69).

Two subsequent albums &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot; (2000) and &quot;The Artful Splodger&quot; (2001) recorded and produced by Dave Goodman, were released by Captain Oi! Records. The albums sold well and the band did two UK and European tours, and also appeared in Canada and the United States.

A live show in Brighton was released on DVD in 2005 and featured Motörhead guitarist Würzel who often guested with Splodge, and also a joint single with John Otway, &quot;No Offence – None Taken&quot;, (available for download only).

In 2006, the band appeared on &quot;Harry Hill&#x27;s TV Burp&quot;, after being featured on &quot;Rock School&quot; with Gene Simmons. Splodgenessabounds performed at the end of the show, accompanied by Hill dressed as &quot;The Demon&quot;, Gene Simmons.

In 2008, Splodge recorded a new song; &quot;You&#x27;ve Been Splodged&quot;, this was released on an Oi compilation album.

In 2012, Splodge recorded a Christmas song that appeared on a punk compilation album called &quot;Cashing in on Christmas&quot;, which was released on Black Hole Records.

Splodge can still be found touring with Bad Manners and is a regular performer at the Rebellion Festival. Max also hosts the bingo at the festival which opens the acoustic stage each day.

<text>Hakan Şükür (; born 1 September 1971) is a Turkish former professional footballer who played as a striker. Nicknamed the &quot;Bull of the Bosphorus&quot; and &quot;Kral&quot; (king), he spent the majority of his professional career with Galatasaray, being a three-time &quot;Gol Kralı&quot; (Goal King, title and award given to the annual top goalscorer of the Süper Lig), representing the club in three different spells and winning a total of 14 major titles.

Şükür represented Turkey a total of 112 times, scoring 51 goals, making him the nation&#x27;s top goalscorer and 19th in the world at the time of his retirement. One of the most prolific strikers of the modern era, he netted 383 goals throughout his club career as well as the fastest ever in a World Cup, in 2002. He retired from football in 2008.

In the 2011 general elections, he was elected as an Istanbul MP for the Justice and Development Party. He resigned from the party in December 2013, to serve as an independent. He is wanted for arrest in Turkey since August 2016 for being a member of Gülen movement and has lived in exile in the United States since mid 2016. On 14 July 2017, a decree was issued stating that all medals awarded to Hakan Şükür were to be revoked.

==Club career==
===Early years===
Born in Sapanca, Sakarya Province, Şükür began his football career with local club Sakaryaspor, making his professional debut shortly after his 17th birthday. His first goal came in a match against Eskişehirspor on 26 February 1989: with the match tied 2–2, he entered the pitch as a substitute and scored the winning goal; he went on to score a further 18 Süper Lig goals in his three-year spell with the club.

In the summer of 1990, Şükür joined fellow first division side Bursaspor. He scored six goals in 27 games in his second season, helping the team to a sixth-place finish, and making his Turkey national team debut shortly after.

===Galatasaray – Torino===
Subsequently, Şükür signed for national giants Galatasaray. Nicknamed the &quot;Bull of the Bosphorus&quot;, he scored 19 goals in thirty matches in his first year with the club, helping it win both the league and cup titles, adding 16 and 19, respectively, in the next two seasons and attracting the attention of Torino. In 1995, he moved to Turin, becoming the second Turkish player to ever play in Serie A, but returned to his country and Galatasaray in the following winter transfer window, after failing to settle and only netting once in the league.

Upon his return to Galatasaray, Şükür regained his scoring form, scoring 16 goals in the league and helping the club to win the cup. The following season, he collected 38 goals in the league, tying him for second-most goals scored in a season with Metin Oktay, one goal behind record holder Tanju Çolak; both players were playing for Galatasaray when they broke the record. Şükür also finished third in the ESM Golden Boot rankings with 57 points, behind Mário Jardel (60) and Ronaldo (68). He won the &quot;Gol Kralı&quot; award the following two seasons, netting 33 and 18 goals respectively, with the Galatasaray winning the title in all three seasons.

In the 1999–2000 season, Şükür&#x27;s last with Galatasaray in his second stint, the team completed a domestic double for the second year in succession, and added the year&#x27;s UEFA Cup, becoming the first Turkish side to win a European title; in the 4–1 penalty shootout win against Arsenal, he scored on his attempt, having netted ten times in 17 games during the campaign.

===Return to Italy – Blackburn===
Şükür then moved to Italy again, this time to Inter Milan, scoring six goals in 35 official matches. His appearances were limited by the presence of Ronaldo and Christian Vieri in the team&#x27;s attack and January 2002, after seasons, he signed with another team in the country, Parma, but was unable to produce again, only finding the net three times. He helped Parma win the Coppa Italia, but only played in the first leg of the final.

Having been released, on 9 December 2002, Şükür joined Blackburn Rovers in the Premier League for the remainder of the campaign, signed by former Galatasaray manager Graeme Souness. His spell began with him sustaining a broken leg in training, which ruled him out for two months, after which made his debut for the club on 1 March 2003, replacing the injured Egil Østenstad at half time in a 1–0 home win over Manchester City; he scored twice from nine appearances, both goals coming in a 4–0 defeat of Fulham at Loftus Road on 7 April.

===Third spell at Galatasaray===

Şükür returned to Galatasaray on 7 July 2003, after failing to negotiate a new contract with Blackburn. He scored 12 times in 28 league games in his first season and 18 in the following, with the team winning the 2005 Turkish cup during that timeframe. Also, on 3 December 2003, he found the net twice in a 2–0 home defeat of Juventus for the 2003–04 UEFA Champions League; in November 2003, to celebrate UEFA&#x27;s Jubilee, he was selected as Turkey&#x27;s Golden Player by the Turkish Football Federation, as their most outstanding player of the past fifty years.

In the 2005–06 season, Şükür again scored in double digits (ten) as Galatasaray again won the league. After helping the club win a record-tying 17th first division title in 2007–08, netting eleven goals, he decided to retire from the game, aged nearly 37. Subsequently, he often appeared as a television pundit on the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation; during his career, he scored 38 goals in all European competitions.

==International career==
Şükür won his first cap for Turkey in a friendly with Luxembourg in March 1992 – his debut being awarded by German manager Sepp Piontek – scoring his first international goal in his next match, against Denmark, and totalling six in his first 11 appearances. He netted seven in qualification for UEFA Euro 1996 and started all of the matches at the finals in England, in which they were eliminated in the group stage without scoring a single goal.

Şükür scored eight times in qualification for the 1998 FIFA World Cup: half of those in a 6–4 home win over Wales on 20 August 1997, but Turkey did not reach the play-offs. At Euro 2000, he netted twice for the quarter-finalists, in a 2–0 group stage win against co-hosts Belgium.

During the 2002 World Cup, held in South Korea and Japan, Şükür scored once for Turkey in seven matches, as the national team finished in third place. On 29 June, he scored the fastest ever goal in a FIFA World Cup and in any major international football tournament, netting against South Korea 10.8 seconds into the third-place play-off, which Turkey went on to win 3–2.

Of his 112 senior appearances, Şükür captained Turkey in thirty. After appearing in some Euro 2008 qualifiers, notably scoring four against Moldova in a 5–0 win in Frankfurt, Germany, he was not selected for the finals, his last game being a 0–1 home loss to Greece at the age of 36 (17 October 2007).

==Personal life==
Şükür is of Albanian origin. Both of his parents are immigrants from Yugoslavia, his father being born in Pristina, and his mother in Skopje. His surname is spelled &quot;Shykyr&quot; in Albanian. His first wife, Esra Elbirlik, married him in a ceremony broadcast live on television, initiated by Prime Minister Tansu Çiller and performed by Mayor of Istanbul Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

The couple divorced after four months, and Elbirlik and her family died in the 1999 İzmit earthquake. Şükür fathered three children with his second spouse, Beyda. In 2010, the football stadium of Sancaktepe was named after him. In April 2014, his name was removed again. 

==Politics==
On 18 June 2011, Şükür was elected as a Member of Parliament to the Grand National Assembly of Turkey in the 2011 general elections, from the ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP), representing the 2nd electoral district of Istanbul Province.

On 16 December 2013, Şükür, known for his links to the Islamic Gülen movement of the Turkish cleric Fethullah Gülen, resigned from his position in protest after the interdiction of the group&#x27;s &quot;dershane&quot; system, and decided to continue working as an independent MP. He subsequently went on to work as a football pundit for Turkish Radio and Television Corporation.

== Prosecution and exile ==
In February 2016, Şükür was charged with insulting president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan on Twitter. In August, a warrant was issued for his arrest as he was charged with being a member of the Gülen movement, designated as a terrorist organization in Turkey.

In an interview published in May 2018 by The New York Times, Hakan Şükür stated that he left Turkey in September 2015 and moved to California to be with a friend. He mentioned that after his term as a member of parliament ended in 2015, he faced obstacles in every job he tried to pursue in Turkey, which led him to decide to live in the United States. He then called his wife and asked her to join him with their three children. After obtaining an investor EB-5 visa in the United States, he became a part-owner of a cafe in Palo Alto in 2016. He would later leave this job because &quot;strange people kept coming into the bar&quot;. He noted that his long-term plan in the United States was not to run a cafe but to coach at a sports academy, similar to what he had planned to do in Turkey.

In November 2019, he revealed in a video on his YouTube channel that he was working as an Uber driver. Germany&#x27;s &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot;, in an interview with Şükür, reported that he had closed his cafe to work as an Uber driver and was also selling books. Additionally, he mentioned that the Turkish government had seized his properties, businesses, and bank accounts in Turkey.

On 3 April 2023, Hakan Şükür announced on his Twitter account that after years in the United States, he and his family had received their green cards, which would allow them to reside and work in the US.

As of August 2023, Hakan Şükür has opened a football school in Palo Alto, California, for boys aged 10-13 and 13-17.

The Turkish government seems to be still very sensitive to the subject. In December 2022 during the TRT broadcast of a World Cup match between Canada and Morocco, commentator Alper Bakircigil commented on Hakim Ziyech&#x27;s goal in the fourth minute about a record held by Şükür, who scored the fastest goal in World Cup history at 10.8 seconds, in their third place match against South Korea at the 2002 World Cup. He was removed from the broadcast at half-time and fired from his job later that day. News accounts speculated that his firing was due to his employer (state-run TRT) reacting to the mention of the name.

<doc id="914836" wikidata="Q329584" url="?curid=914836" title="John Ellis (executioner)">
<text>John Ellis (4 October 1874 – 20 September 1932) was a British executioner for 23 years, from 1901 to 1924. His other occupations were as a Rochdale hairdresser and newsagent.

==Personal life==

Born in Balderstone, Rochdale on 4 October 1874, he first worked in a series of jobs as a casual labourer in and around Manchester before gaining a job at a spinning mill in Bury. After another stint in a factory he decided to follow his father&#x27;s trade by becoming a barber and hairdresser in Rochdale, where he subsequently also opened a newsagent&#x27;s shop, which he ran with his wife and children.

==Career==
At the age of 22 he applied to the Home Office to become an executioner and was invited to attend training at Newgate Prison. He first participated in an execution in Newcastle in December 1901, as assistant to William Billington. Ellis served as Chief Executioner from 1907 and was involved in a total of 203 executions.

Among the executions he performed were those of Hawley Harvey Crippen (known as Dr. Crippen) in 1910, Frederick Seddon in 1912, Sir Roger Casement in 1916, Herbert Rowse Armstrong in 1922, and Edith Thompson in 1923. The ordeal of executing Edith Thompson in 1923 had a profound effect on Ellis. Thompson had collapsed in terror at the prospect of her hanging and, unconscious, had to be supported on the gallows by four prison warders. Various accounts report, &quot;that guards had to tie her to a small wooden chair before drawing the noose around her neck&quot;, and that &quot;she was hanged in a bosun&#x27;s chair&quot;.

==Resignation and death==
Ellis resigned from his post in March 1924. Whether this was due to his experiences at the Thompson hanging is open to dispute, especially since he performed 11 more executions (among which was one of another woman) before he withdrew. Ellis took to drinking heavily, and attempted suicide in 1924 by shooting himself in the jaw.

Suicide was at that time a criminal offence, and Ellis was charged and bound over for 12 months at Rochdale Magistrates Court.
Eight years later, in September 1932, after another bout of heavy drinking, Ellis died by suicide, cutting his throat with a razor.

==Controversy==
His relations to his fellow executioners were strained. Henry Pierrepoint was struck off the list of executioners following a complaint by Ellis. Pierrepoint, arriving at Chelmsford prison slightly intoxicated on 13 July 1910, had started a row, and would have beaten Ellis up, had not warders intervened. Pierrepoint&#x27;s brother Thomas, also an executioner, is reported to have said about John Ellis that &quot;it was impossible to work with him&quot;.

Ellis was persuaded to take on the dramatic role of executioner in the play
&quot;The Life and Adventures of Charles Peace&quot;, which opened in Gravesend in December, 1927. This attracted a degree of controversy as some considered his participation inappropriate. Attendances dwindled and after the production closed, Ellis used the scaffold as part of his tours.

Insights into his behaviour, way of thinking and the methods he employed can be read in the book &quot;Diary of a Hangman&quot;, in which he describes his methods and recalls the final moments of some of those he executed.

<text>The parabasalids are a group of flagellated protists within the supergroup Excavata. Most of these eukaryotic organisms form a symbiotic relationship in animals. These include a variety of forms found in the intestines of termites and cockroaches, many of which have symbiotic bacteria that help them digest cellulose in woody plants. Other species within this supergroup are known parasites, and include human pathogens.

==Characteristics==
The flagella are arranged in one or more clusters near the anterior of the cell. Their basal bodies are linked to parabasal fibers that are associated with a prominent Golgi complex, together forming a parabasal apparatus distinctive to the group. Attachment of a parabasal fiber to the first Golgi cisterna by thin filaments has been reported in &quot;Tritrichomonas foetus&quot;. Usually they also give rise to a sheet of cross-like microtubules that runs down the center of the cell and in some cases projects past the end. This is called the axostyle, but is different in structure from the axostyles of oxymonads.

Parabasalids are anaerobic, and lack mitochondria, but this is now known to be a result of secondary loss, and they contain small hydrogenosomes which apparently developed from reduced mitochondria. Similar relics have been found in other amitochondriate flagellates, and the parabasalids are probably related to them, forming a group called the metamonads. They lack the feeding grooves found in most others, but this is probably a secondary loss as well.

==Classification==
Before reclassification, the parabasalids were divided into about seven to 10 orders depending on sources. Present classification divides Parabasalia into four orders, that is, Trichonymphida, Spirotrichonymphida, Cristamonadida, and Trichomonadida. 

* The trichomonads have one group of 4–6 flagella, one of which is attached to the side of the cell and often forms an undulating membrane. Many are found in vertebrate hosts, including &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;, which causes a sexually transmitted disease in humans.
* The other orders, formerly grouped as the hypermastigids, have a large number of flagellar clusters and are found exclusively in the guts of insects. (The term &quot;Hypermastigida&quot; is still occasionally encountered.)

==Evolution==

The parabasalid &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; is not known to undergo meiosis. However, Malik &quot;et al.&quot; examined &quot;T. vaginalis&quot; for the presence of 29 genes that function in meiosis and found 27 such genes, including eight genes specific to meiosis in model organisms. These findings suggested that the capability for meiosis, and hence sexual reproduction, was likely present in a recent parabasalid ancestor of &quot;T. vaginalis&quot;.

<text>QSR J1819+3845 is a quasar notable for being the most variable known extragalactic radio source. This quasar shows variations of factors of four or more on a timescale of hours.

The variations have been shown to be due to scattering in the interstellar medium (ISM). This quasar furnished the elegant proof of the role of scattering due to the ISM, or interstellar scintillation, by showing a time delay in arrival between the signal at widely spaced telescopes (in the US and Netherlands).

Interstellar scintillation is the observed effect of interference and refractive phenomena due to the ISM. It can be thought of as the ISM focusing and defocusing the radio waves from the source, producing a pattern of dark and bright patches, rather like light and dark patches at the bottom of a fish pond. As the Earth moves through these patches we observe a temporal variation in the radio intensity (like a fish swimming through light and dark patches).

If the standard theory of diffractive scintillation is assumed to apply, ground-based radio traces would seem to require that J1819+3845 contains a component that must be less than about 5 microarcseconds across; this would require its temperature to be in excess of 1015 K. However, the scintillation may perhaps be interpreted as being due to an unusual piece of intervening interstellar medium.

Nonetheless, its importance lies in having proved the importance of interstellar scintillation in creating the observed variations in brightness in at least some quasars, which had been the subject of some discussion.

<doc id="914844" wikidata="Q309497" url="?curid=914844" title="Trichomonas">
<text>Trichomonas is a genus of anaerobic excavate parasites of vertebrates. It was first discovered by Alfred François Donné in 1836 when he found these parasites in the vagina of a patient suffering from vaginitis, an inflammation of the vagina. Donné named the genus from its morphological characteristics. The prefix tricho- originates from the Ancient Greek word (thrix) meaning hair, describing &quot;Trichomonas&quot;’s flagella. The suffix -monas ( – single unit), describes its similarity to unicellular organisms from the genus &quot;Monas&quot;.

==Habitat and ecology==
&quot;Trichomonas&quot; is typically found in anaerobic environments. It is a known parasite of many different animals including humans, birds, dogs, and cats. In humans, it can be found in the urogenital tract and in the oral cavity. It is estimated that 276 million new cases of urogenital infections occur each year. Depending on the &quot;Trichomonas&quot; species, it can either be transmitted through direct sexual contact or through contaminated water sources. In birds, it can be found in the upper digestive tract and is transmitted when adult birds regurgitate food to feed their young, when a bird of prey feeds on an infected bird, and through contaminated food or water.

==Morphology==
&quot;Trichomonas&quot; is around 10 μm in length and is normally pear-shaped. It has four flagella at its anterior end, distinguishing itself from closely related organisms that have different numbers of anterior flagella. At the base of these flagella are the parabasal bodies, kinetosomes accompanied by Golgi stacks. The pelta is a sheet of microtubules that curve around the flagellar bases. Posterior to the pelta is the axostyle, is a bundle of microtubules that extends from the anterior end of the organism all the way to the posterior end. The nucleus of &quot;Trichomonas&quot; is situated close to where the pelta and axostyle meet.

Another distinguishing feature of &quot;Trichomonas&quot; is the presence of an undulating membrane. The undulating membrane is a fin-like extension of the plasma membrane located on the side of the organism. A flagellum that extends to the posterior end of the organism is attached to the outer edge of the undulating membrane. At the base of the undulating membrane is a striated fiber called the costa which is thought to exist for structural support.

&quot;Trichomonas&quot; has a very interesting organelle: the hydrogenosome. Hydrogenosomes are double-membraned organelles used by trichomonads, instead of mitochondria, to produce ATP. They do not require oxygen and instead use pyruvate:ferredoxin oxido-reductase and hydrogenase to produce ATP from pyruvate, generating hydrogen gas as a by-product.

==Genetics==
&quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;, being the species that causes the most complications in humans, is the only fully sequenced &quot;Trichomonas&quot; species. Through whole-genome shotgun sequencing, the &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; genome is estimated to be around 160 Mb long, divided into six chromosomes. However, at least 65% of its genome was found to be redundant. The redundant genetic material is hypothesized to have emerged during &quot;Trichomonas&quot;&#x27;s transition from aerobic to anaerobic environments.

In addition to discovering the large proportion of repetitive DNA in &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; genome, the sequenced genes were also characterized. Approximately 60,000 protein-coding genes were found. Transfer RNAs for all 20 amino acids and approximately 250 ribosomal RNA were all found on the same chromosome.

==Life cycle==
&quot;Trichomonas&quot; has a trophozoite form, its pear-shaped form, which is most commonly observed, and an amoeboid form, which appears during host colonization. It lacks a cyst form, but many studies have noted a unique form in which &quot;Trichomonas&quot; appears ovoidal rather than its typical pear-shaped form. In this ovoidal form, all its flagella are retracted in endocytic vacuoles, giving the impression of a cystic form. However, due to the lack of a cystic wall surrounding the organism, many studies describe this form as a pseudocystic form.

In its trophozoite form, &quot;Trichomonas&quot; undergoes cell division through an interesting process called cryptopleuromitosis. There are three common forms of mitosis: open, closed, and semi-open. In open mitosis, the nuclear envelope disappears so that mitotic spindles can interact with the chromosomes. In closed mitosis, the nuclear envelope does not disappear but mitotic spindles appear within the nucleus to separate the chromosomes. In semi-open mitosis, the nuclear envelope remains intact but the mitotic spindles pierce through the nuclear envelope to divide the chromosomes. Cryptopleuromitosis is different from all the other more commonly known methods of cell division. In cryptopleuromitosis, the chromosomes divide without the breakdown of the nuclear envelope and without the entry of mitotic spindles into the nucleus.

==Diseases==
&quot;Trichomonas&quot; causes disease in humans and in birds. In humans, the causative species is &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; and &quot;Trichomonas tenax&quot;. In birds, the causative species are &quot;Trichomonas gallinae&quot;, &quot;Trichomonas gypactinii&quot;, and &quot;Trichomonas stableri&quot;.

===In humans===
&quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; is a sexually transmitted disease and causes trichomoniasis. It resides on squamous epithelium of the urogenital tract. Many carriers of &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot;, especially men, are asymptomatic. Complications for symptomatic women include vaginitis, endometritis, infertility, and cervical cancer. Complications for symptomatic men include urethritis, prostatitis, epididymitis, and infertility. It is also associated with increased risk of transmission and acquisition of HIV.

&quot;Trichomonas tenax&quot; is transmitted through exchange of saliva and contaminated water sources. It is an opportunistic pathogen and may cause pulmonary trichomoniasis.

===In birds===
&quot;Trichomonas&quot; in birds inhabit the upper digestive tract and also cause trichomoniasis. It creates lesions in the trachea and esophagus, occupying space and eventually causing emaciation and asphyxiation.

==Species==
* &quot;Trichomonas brixi&quot; — inhabits the oral cavity of dogs and cats.
* &quot;Trichomonas gallinae&quot; — inhabits the upper digestive tract of primarily pigeons and doves, but also other birds.
* &quot;Trichomonas gypactinii&quot; — inhabits the upper digestive tract of scavenging birds of prey, such as vultures.
* &quot;Trichomonas stableri&quot; — inhabits the upper digestive tract of pigeons.
* &quot;Trichomonas tenax&quot; — inhabits the oral cavity of humans.
* &quot;Trichomonas vaginalis&quot; — inhabits the urogenital tract of humans.

<doc id="914846" wikidata="Q2032451" url="?curid=914846" title="Naegleria">
<text>Naegleria is a genus consisting of 47 described species of protozoa often found in warm aquatic environments as well as soil habitats worldwide. It has three life cycle forms: the amoeboid stage, the cyst stage, and the flagellated stage, and has been routinely studied for its ease in change from amoeboid to flagellated stages. The &quot;Naegleria&quot; genera became famous when &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;, the causative agent of the usually fatal human and animal disease primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), was discovered in 1965. Most species in the genus, however, are incapable of causing disease.

== Etymology ==

The genus &quot;Naegleria&quot; is named after the German protozoologist, Kurt Nägler.

== History ==

In 1899, Franz Schardinger discovered an amoeba that had the ability to transform into a flagellated stage. He named the organism &quot;Amoeba gruberi&quot;, which was later changed to the genus &quot;Naegleria&quot; in 1912 by Alexeieff. Before 1970, the genus was generally used as a model organism to study the changes from amoeboid to flagellated stages. However it garnered much more attention when a human pathogenic species (&quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;) was discovered in Australia in 1965, and described in 1970.

== Habitat and ecology ==

&quot;Naegleria&quot; is found worldwide in typically aerobic warm aquatic environments (freshwater such as lakes and rivers) and soil habitats. As a typically free living genus, it feeds on bacteria and can be maintained on a diet of gram negative bacteria. It feeds via phagocytosis. The few species that are pathogenic seem to be characteristically thermophilic, preferring warmer temperatures such as nuclear power plant cooling water. One species, &quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;, can be an opportunistic and usually fatal pathogen of humans if it enters the depths of the nasal cavity.

== Description of organism ==

=== Morphology/anatomy ===

&quot;Naegleria&quot; are free-living amoebae, with some strains being opportunistic pathogens. Cells range from 10-25 um depending on the life stage it is currently in. Species are not classified morphologically anymore but historically have been by flagellar shape. New species are often defined by ribosomal DNA sequences. The unicellular organism&#x27;s cytoplasm has distinct separations of an ectoplasm (outer) and endoplasm (inner). As a mitochondriate, aerobic organism it has many mitochondria in the endoplasm. The endoplasm also contains ribosomes, food vacuoles, contractile filaments/vacuoles, and protoplasmic filaments. Notably, Golgi is not visibly identifiable although expression of Golgi-associated machinery has been identified. It has a nucleus with a prominent nucleolus.

=== Life cycles ===

&quot;Naegleria&quot; has 3 different life cycle stages: amoebae, cyst, and flagellate.

The amoebae stage is the feeding stage and has blunt pseudopodia (lobopodia) that give the cell an overall irregular, yet generally cylindrical shape. The overall size is usually around 10–20 um at this stage. The pseudopodia are actin based extensions of the body and form at irregular regions of the cell. Movement occurs in this stage via extending the pseudopodia, and having the cytoplasmic internal contents follow subsequently. As the feeding stage of the organism, pseudopodia are also used to engulf prey, such as bacteria. This is also the stage that the organism spends the most time in, and also the reproductive phase. Reproduction occurs here by binary fission and it can reproduce every 1.6 hours on a bacterial diet. Reproductive division involves promitosis, or intranuclear mitosis, which does not occur with nuclear envelope breakdown. Sexual reproduction has not been observed in this genus but the genes for meiosis do exist in the genome.

The cyst stage is a double walled spherical stage. The double wall consists of a thick endocyst and a thin endocyst. The cyst contains usually 2-8 pores (often depending on the species) and is formed when conditions become adverse, such as residing in non optimal temperature. Cysts are favourable as they are naturally resistant to environmental hardships. When adverse conditions are restored to normal, the organism can escape the cyst through the pores in its amoeboid form. Cysts have been observed to be formed in all but one species where the ability to form a cyst is inhibited by a bacterial parasite.

The flagellate stage consists of two flagella which are induced by de novo assembly of a primarily microtubule cytoskeleton from a former actin based cytoskeleton (from the amoeboid form). The microtubule skeleton is prominent along with the development of basal bodies. The entire flagellar structure consists of 200 proteins. Division of the organism does not occur in this life stage, although two species have been found to divide as an exception. There is no cytostome (feeding groove) present suggesting that feeding occurs primarily in the amoeboid stage via phagocytosis. There is a single nucleus which is near the flagellar root. The flagellated stage is typically encountered when the genus needs to move to a more desirable location, which is often encountered when conditions are not optimal. Therefore, this flagellated stage is transient and the organism usually reverts to the amoeboid form within an hour, with transformation taking about 100 minutes. The reversion to the amoeboid form can be induced by changes in ionic concentration of the water it resides in (such as placing it in distilled water); during which transformation the cell disassembles its microtubules. Notably, five species have never been observed in this flagellate life stage.

=== Genetics ===

The genome of &quot;Naegleria gruberi&quot; has been sequenced and consists of a 41 Mb nuclear genome with 15,727 protein-coding genes. It has a 33% GC content, and 57.8% of the genome is coding with about 36% consisting of introns. This suggests a mean of about 0.7 introns per gene. There are at least 12 chromosomes present. About 1% of the genes have homology to bacterial genes suggesting that lateral gene transfer may have occurred at some point. The genome also notably contains the required genes for Golgi but it is visibly lacking. Although only seen to be asexual, meiotic genes are also present.

Compared to other protists, &quot;Naegleria&quot; also has a larger set of mitochondrial genes with about a 50 kb mitochondrial genome. The mitochondrial genome clearly encodes for aerobic respiration which is seen through its ability to perform oxidative phosphorylation and use oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor. Remarkably the organism&#x27;s genome also encodes for an elaborate anaerobic metabolism such as substrate-level phosphorylation and an ability to use fumarate as the terminal electron acceptor. This anaerobic system is hypothesized to be used in slightly anoxic muddy environments during the cyst life stage.

The genus &quot;Naegleria’s&quot; ribosomal DNA (rDNA) consists of an extrachromosomal plasmid of which about 4000 exist in each cell. Comparison of 5.8S rDNA is the current way of molecularly classifying new species. Species can also be distinguished by their internal transcribed spacers type 2 (ITS2) sequences.

=== Practical importance ===
One species of &quot;Naegleria&quot; is known to be a potential pathogen to humans&quot;Naegleria fowleri&quot;. It is typically free living, but is a thermophilic parasite if it encounters the right host. Besides being found in freshwater, it can also be found in warm water of industrial plants, as well as poorly chlorinated swimming pools. It enters through the nose of the host (who is typically found to be in contact through warm water such as thermal nuclear plant cooling water), and attaches to the olfactory epithelium where it goes to the brain by locomotion (pseudopodia). There it destroys neurons and causes primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a very rare, yet fatal disease. PAM shows symptoms very similar to bacterial meningitis. &quot;N. fowleri&quot; is one of four known free living amoebae found in association with human disease. The end result is almost always death, even in healthy people. &quot;N. fowleri&quot; possess secreted proteases, phospholipases, and pore-forming peptides which are characteristics of a pathogenic process.

Two other species, &quot;Naegleria austerealiensis&quot; and &quot;Naegleria italica&quot; have been shown to produce disease in experimental animals. They have been observed to cause central nervous system (CNS) infections in animals such as mice, rats, squirrels, guinea pigs, sheep, as well as the gills of fish.

Another practical importance of the genus is that it is extensively studied for its transformation from the amoeboid phase into the flagellated stage, which can be difficult to induce in other genera. The transformation from flagellate to amoeboid stage can be induced by changes in ionic concentration, such as placing the organism in distilled water making it a great model organism for doing so.

<text>John de Halton (died 1324), also called John de Halghton, was an English priest and Bishop of Carlisle from 1292 to 1324.

==Life==

Little is known of Halton&#x27;s background, but he attended Oxford University. He was a canon and cellarer in Carlisle Cathedral. He was elected bishop on 23 April 1292, and consecrated on 14 September 1292. He was not enthroned until January 1293, however, because after his consecration he was with King Edward I of England in Scotland. He was present at Berwick when Edward decided that the throne of Scotland should go to John Balliol. Halton spent much of the time between 1292 and 1295 in Scotland, for Pope Nicholas IV had appointed Halton to collect the crusading tax that the pope had imposed. However, when England and Scotland went to war in 1296, Halton returned to his diocese and remained there.

In January 1298 Halton appeared at a meeting in York held by Roger Bigod the Earl of Norfolk and Humphrey de Bohun the Earl of Hereford and excommunicated all opponents of Magna Carta. During the reign of King Edward II of England his diocese was exposed to constant raids from the Scots, and much of his time was spent in trying to repair the damage from the raids. In 1309 he excommunicated Robert the Bruce for the murder of John Comyn three years earlier. He served as an envoy to Scotland again in 1320. He was an attendee of the gathering, or anti-Parliament, held at Sherburn and led by Thomas the Earl of Lancaster in June 1321. This gathering was part of the baronial uprising against King Edward II and his favorites the Despensers, but Halton does not seem to have played any further role in the conflict.

Halton died on 1 November 1324 at his manor at Rose. He was probably buried in his cathedral, but his tomb no longer survives. His register episcopal acts, however, does survive, and is the first one from Carlisle still extant.

<doc id="914854" wikidata="Q7867707" url="?curid=914854" title="USS Betelgeuse (AK-260)">
<text>USS &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; (AK-260) was the last of the &quot;Greenville Victory&quot;-class cargo ships in service in the United States Navy. On 10 April 1944, it was renamed the SS &quot;Colombia Victory&quot; after being launched as a Victory ship to carry cargo during World War II. She was transferred to the US Navy in 1951.

==Ship&#x27;s history==
===Construction===
&quot;Betelgeuse&quot; was a constructed by the California Shipbuilding Company, Los Angeles, California, and commissioned in the merchant service as SS &quot;Colombia Victory&quot; in May, 1944. From 1944 through 1948, she was operated by the Grace Steamship Company, the Waterman Steamship Corporation and the Isthmian Steamship Company. In 1948, she was placed in Maritime Reserve Fleet until 1951 when she was purchased by the U.S. government and converted for Navy use.

==World War II - SS &quot;Colombia Victory&quot;==

SS &quot;Colombia Victory&quot;, a U.S. Merchant Marine ship, was very active in the Pacific War operations during World War II. The SS &quot;Colombia Victory&quot; was tasked with delivering ammunition to troops The &quot;Colombia Victory&quot; was attacked at the Battle in the Philippines three times from November 4 to November 25, 1944. Her Naval Armed Guard crews earned &quot;battle stars&quot; for participating in the assault and occupation of Iwo Jima from 25 February to 6 March 1945. On 1 March 1945, the ship was delivering ammunition to marines on the beach of Iwo Jima and came under fire by Japanese artillery. Shore batteries opened fire on her and hit a worker on the aft deck but the ship was quickly turned around and moved out of firing range. The SS &quot;Colombia Victory&quot; also delivered supplies to US troops taking part in the Battle of Okinawa and Occupation of Okinawa from 27 May to 4 June 1945. As a Merchant Marine ship, she was operated by the Ishmian SS Corporation, the Waterman SS Corporation, and the Grace Lines.

After the war in 1948, &quot;Colombia Victory&quot; was laid up Wilmington, Delaware, as part of the United States Navy reserve fleets.

==USS &quot;Betelgeuse&quot;==

On 15 April 1952 at Savannah, Georgia, she was commissioned by the Navy as the USS &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; (AK-260) and placed under the operational control of the Service Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. Cargo ships, like &quot;Betelgeuse&quot;, were named after heavenly bodies; Betelgeuse being a large star in the constellation Orion.

From her commissioning in 1952 through 1960, &quot;Goose&quot; made resupply missions to the Caribbean and the Mediterranean with occasional trips to base in the West Indies, Bermuda, and the Azores. While performing her mission as a Navy Cargo ship, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; transferred practically every kind of cargo to ships, barges, and piers using every known transfer method.

===1960s===

====Conversion for Polaris support====

In the summer of 1960, a significant modification was accomplished when &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; was modified to carry Polaris missiles and components in support of the Fleet Ballistic Missile program. This modification changed the mission of &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; from a fleet resupply ship to a link in the Polaris program.

After two years of operation as a Polaris resupply ship, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; entered the shipyard for further modifications keyed to a more efficient stowage and transfer of Polaris missiles and their components. The major undertaking of this modification was the installation of vertical stowage of the Polaris missiles in Number Three hold. During the period 1 June through 7 September 1962, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot;, along with a normal overhaul, was again converted. Number Three hold received another major conversion, this time to the new concept of vertical stowage and transport of missiles.

With this conversion, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; could now transport fourteen missiles in Number Three hold, five missiles (in containers), in Number Four hold, and four missiles (in containers) on the main deck, one on each side of both Number Four and Five hatches, for a total capacity of twenty-three missiles.

====1962 operations====
Commencing in 1962, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; (AK-260) made resupply runs to Holy Loch, Scotland and Naval Station Rota, Spain. She not only carried Polaris missiles and their components, but she also carried food, repair parts, clothing, fuel, and many other items which enabled the Polaris submarines to operate from a mobile base.

====1965–1966 operations====
From December 1965 through March 1966, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; underwent a regular overhaul at Detyen&#x27;s Shipyard, Mount Pleasant, South Carolina. &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; was the first major ship to be overhauled at this shipyard and the largest ship ever to navigate the Wando River to the shipyard site. During the overhaul, two men earned the Navy and Marine Corps Medal for risking their lives in a successful rescue of two shipyard workers from a fume filled tank of an aviation gas barge.

&quot;Betelgeuse&quot; underwent refresher training in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, in June 1966 following an FBM (fleet ballistic missile) resupply voyage to Rota, Spain in May with a four-day operational visit to Barcelona, Spain. Two FBM resupply voyages were made to Holy Loch, Scotland in July and September and an operational visit to Portsmouth, England. Two more FBM resupply voyages were made to Rota, Spain in October and November prior to going into upkeep and leave period in Charleston, South Carolina for the month of December.

====1967 operations====
&quot; Betelgeuse&quot; (AK-260) was a unit of Service Squadron Eight until 1 July 1967 and then was transferred to Commander Submarine Force, US Atlantic Fleet and placed under the operational control of Commander Submarine Flotilla Six at Charleston, South Carolina.

From 1 January 1967 until 30 August 1967, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; operated with the U.S. Atlantic Submarine Force providing services as required from retrieving torpedoes during target services to replenishment of the Polaris site at Charleston, South Carolina, with the exception of the period 4–22 June 1967 when &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; participated in Operation New Look. While on Operation New Look, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; was granted a port visit to New York City.

====Collision with &quot;Simon Bolivar&quot;====

While conducting submarine services in August 1967, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; was involved in a collision with the submarine which was submerged. Extensive damage to the underwater hull caused immediate flooding in Number Three hold with resultant leaks into Number Two hold and the engine room. There were no personnel injuries and &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; was able to return to Charleston under her own power and entered the Charleston Naval Shipyard for repairs during the period of 1 September through 8 October 1967. On 9 October 1967, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; conducted sea trials with outstanding results.

====1967 operations====

In October 1967, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; made an FBM resupply trip to Rota, Spain. Upon returning to Charleston, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; commenced loading for a replenishment trip to Bangor, Washington, via the Panama Canal for the first WESTLANT/EASTPAC replenishment, transiting the Panama Canal 17 November and arriving in Bangor, Washington 27 November. While in Washington, a visit to the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard had to be made to repair a leaky economizer tube in Number One boiler. On the return trip to Charleston, a one-day port visit was made of Balboa, Panama.

====1968 operations====

From January 1968 through April 1968, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; provided target services and retrieved torpedoes for submarines, performed site replenishment of the Polaris site at Charleston, made a liberty port visit to Miami, Florida, and an FBM resupply to Holy Loch, Scotland.

A dependent&#x27;s cruise was conducted on 26 July 1968 and a liberty port visit was made to Fort Lauderdale, Florida, in August and another FBM resupply was made to Holy Loch, Scotland at the end of August 1968.

&quot;Betelgeuse&quot; participated in the first operational test of the fleet ballistic missile system for Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet in October and November 1968.

====Rescue of &quot;Spirit of Love&quot; crew====

Departing Charleston on 15 November 1968 for Holy Loch, Scotland, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; came in contact with a 35-foot sailboat &quot;Sprit of Love&quot; foundering off course approximately 300 miles northeast of Bermuda on 18 November. &quot;Spirit of Love&quot; had departed New York for St. Thomas, Virgin Islands on 2 November. The three crewmen were taken on board and the sailboat taken in tow. The master had advised that the boat&#x27;s engine was inoperative, sails gone, water and cooking fuel depleted, and only about two days food remained on board and the crew had been bailing for the past five days. While in tow in heavy seas and taking on water, &quot;Spirit of Love&quot; sank. The three crewmen were transferred via helicopter to the and then flown to Bermuda. &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; resumed her track to Holy Loch, Scotland, arriving on 26 November. On 8 December 1968, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; entered dry-dock in the at Holy Loch. After undocking on 20 December, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; departed for Charleston and arrived 1 January 1969.

====1969 operations====

During 1969, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; twice provided target services and retrieved torpedoes for submarines and participated in two operational tests of the fleet ballistic missile system as down range support ship and once again a liberty port visit was made to Miami, Florida.

&quot;Betelgeuse&quot; went through a shipyard overhaul in Charleston Naval Shipyard from May through August 1969 in which $1,543,704 were spent in repairs and preservation of the ship. In December 1969, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; went through refresher training at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

===1970s===

From 1 January through 31 March 1970, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; made one FBM site replenishment to Rota, Spain, and two FBM site replenishments to Holy Loch, Scotland. While underway on the second trip to Holy Loch on 28 February, after experiencing heavy seas for several days, the weather appeared to be clearing and the seas calming when the ship rode up on an unusually large wave of about 60 feet and pounded heavily, resulting in the rupture of a fuel tank under Number One hold. Arriving on 4 March, temporary repairs were made at Holy Loch. The ship then returned to Charleston arriving 21 March for dry-docking and permanent repairs.

During the months of April, May, August, and September, &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; was downrange support ship for operational tests of the fleet ballistic system for Commander Submarine Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet. An operational visit was made to Ponta Delgada, São Miguel, Azores during the first test.

====Deactivation and decommissioning====
The Sub-Board of Inspection and Survey, Atlantic conducted a pre-inactivation inspection during the period 21–23 September 1970 and found &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; fit for further service provided three deficiencies were corrected. On 15 October 1970, operational control of &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; shifted to Naval Inactive Ship Maintenance Facility Portsmouth, Charleston Detachment and became inactive to prepare to enter the mothball fleet.

&quot;Betelgeuse&quot; was formally decommissioned on 15 January 1971.

&quot;Betelgeuse&quot; was towed to Philadelphia Naval Shipyard on 16 January 1971 and used in an experiment for encapsulation of mothballed ships. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1974.

====Destruction====
Sold for scrapping to Luria Brothers &amp; Co. in December 1975, while being towed to Texas in January 1976, the tug boat had to cut the tow cable due to high seas and &quot;Betelgeuse&quot; ran aground at Rodanthe, North Carolina.

<text>The peryton is a fictional hybrid animal combining the physical features of a stag and a bird. The peryton was invented by Jorge Luis Borges in his 1957 &quot;Book of Imaginary Beings,&quot; using the fictional device of a supposedly long-lost medieval manuscript.

Some historical versions of the heraldry of King Charles VI of France featured winged stags as heraldic supports, as did some versions of the late medieval battle standard of the Dukes of Bourbon

==Description==
The peryton is said to have the head, neck, forelegs and antlers of a stag, combined with the plumage, wings and hindquarters of a large bird, although some interpretations portray the peryton as a deer in all but coloration and bird&#x27;s wings.

According to Borges, perytons lived in Atlantis until an earthquake destroyed the civilization and the creatures escaped by flight. A peryton casts the shadow of a human until it kills one during its lifetime, at which time it starts to cast its own shadow. Some descriptions of the peryton allege that a sibyl once prophesied that the perytons would lead to the downfall of Rome.

==In science==
The term &quot;peryton&quot; is also used for radio signals of terrestrial origin that mimic fast radio bursts, pulses that appear to be coming from outside of our galaxy. This was assigned to this source type by the scientist that first identified them in the data, Sarah Burke-Spolaor, because they demonstrated some properties that appeared man-made and some that appeared natural. These perytons were found to be the result of premature opening of a microwave oven door, which releases a frequency-swept radio pulse, which mimics a fast radio burst, as the magnetron turns off.

==In popular culture==
Perytons have made appearances in modern literature and games.

* A version of the peryton appears in the tabletop game Dungeons and Dragons and its derivative novel &quot;Darkwell&quot;, a book in &quot;The Moonshae Trilogy&quot; where a flock of perytons are among an army of evil monsters summoned by the book&#x27;s main antagonist.
* The peryton features in John and Carole Barrowman&#x27;s novel &quot;Hollow Earth&quot;.
* Perytons appear in &quot;Across the Green Grass Fields&quot;, the 6th of the Wayward Children series by Seanan McGuire.
* A group of perytons appear in the fourth Fablehaven book by Brandon Mull, &quot;&quot;.

<doc id="914869" wikidata="Q3295867" url="?curid=914869" title="The Coca-Cola Company">
<text>The Coca-Cola Company is an American multinational corporation founded in 1892. It manufactures, sells and markets soft drinks including Coca-Cola, other non-alcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups, and alcoholic beverages. Its stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange and is a component of the DJIA and the S&amp;P 500 and S&amp;P 100 indexes.

Coca-Cola was developed in 1886 by pharmacist John Stith Pemberton. At the time it was introduced, the product contained cocaine from coca leaves and caffeine from kola nuts which together acted as a stimulant. The coca and the kola are the source of the product name, and led to Coca-Cola&#x27;s promotion as a &quot;healthy tonic&quot;. Pemberton had been severely wounded in the American Civil War, and had become addicted to the pain medication morphine. At the time, cocaine was being promoted as a &quot;cure&quot; for opioid addiction, so he developed the beverage as a patent medicine in an effort to control his addiction.

In 1889, the formula and brand were sold for $2,300 (roughly $71,000 in 2022) to Asa Griggs Candler, who incorporated the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta, Georgia in 1892. The company has operated a franchised distribution system since 1889. The company largely produces syrup concentrate, which is then sold to various bottlers throughout the world who hold exclusive territories.

==History==

In July 1886, pharmacist John Stith Pemberton from Columbus, Georgia invented the original Coca-Cola drink, which was advertised as helpful in the relief of headache, to be placed on sale primarily in drugstores as a medicinal beverage. Pemberton had made many mixing experiments and reached his goal during the month of May, but the new product was as yet unnamed and uncarbonated. Pemberton&#x27;s bookkeeper, Frank Mason Robinson, is credited with naming the product and creating its logo. Robinson chose the name Coca-Cola because of its two main ingredients (coca leaves and kola nuts) and because it is an alliteration. John Pemberton had taken a break and left Robinson to make, promote, and sell Coca-Cola on his own. Robinson promoted the drink with the limited budget that he had, and succeeded.

American businessman Asa Griggs Candler purchased the Coca-Cola formula and brand, forming the Coca-Cola Company in Atlanta in 1892. By 1895, Coca-Cola was being sold nationwide. In 1919, the company was sold to Ernest Woodruff&#x27;s Trust Company of Georgia, after which it was soon reincorporated under the Delaware General Corporation Law that same year.

Coca-Cola&#x27;s first ad read &quot;Coca Cola. Delicious! Refreshing! Exhilarating! Invigorating!&quot; Candler was one of the first businessmen to use merchandising in his advertising strategy. As of 1948, Coca-Cola had claimed about 60% of its market share. By 1984, the Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s market share decreased to 21.8% due to new competitors.

===Acquisitions===
Coca-Cola acquired Minute Maid in 1960 for an undisclosed amount. In 1982, it acquired the movie studio Columbia Pictures for $692 million. Coca-Cola then launched a series of entertainment takeovers, namely Merv Griffin Enterprises and Embassy Communications in the mid-1980s, forming the Entertainment Business Sector, which would later merge with Tri-Star Pictures to start out Columbia Pictures Entertainment, with CPE holding a stake in the company. Coca-Cola sold Columbia to Sony for $3 billion in 1989. In 1986, Coke sold off two assets, namely Presto Products and Winker-Flexible Products to an investment group led by E.O. Gaylord for $38 million.

The company acquired the Indian cola brand Thums Up in 1993, and the American soda company Barq&#x27;s in 1995. In 1999, Coca-Cola purchased 50% of the shares of Inca Kola for $200 million, subsequently taking control of overseas marketing and production for the brand. In 2001, it acquired the Odwalla brand of fruit juices, smoothies, and bars for $181 million. It announced Odwalla&#x27;s discontinuation in 2020. In 2007, it acquired Fuze Beverage from founder Lance Collins and Castanea Partners for an estimated $250 million.

The company&#x27;s 2009 bid to buy Chinese juice maker Huiyuan Juice Group ended when China rejected its $2.4 billion bid, on the grounds the resulting company would be a virtual monopoly. Nationalism was also thought to be a reason for aborting the deal.

In 2011, it acquired the remaining stake in Honest Tea, having bought a 40% stake in 2008 for $43 million. In 2013, it finalized its purchase of ZICO, a coconut water company. In August 2014, it acquired a 16.7% (currently 19.36% due to stock buy backs) stake in Monster Beverage for $2.15 billion with an option to increase it to 25%, as part of a long-term strategic partnership that includes marketing and distribution alliance, and product line swap. In 2015, the company took a minority stake ownership in the cold pressed juice manufacturer, Suja Life LLC. In December 2016, it bought many of the former SABMiller&#x27;s Coca-Cola operations. The Coca-Cola Company owns a 68.3% stake in Coca-Cola Bottlers Africa. Coca-Cola Bottlers Africa&#x27;s headquarters located in Port Elizabeth South Africa.

The Coca-Cola Company acquired a 40% stake in Chi Ltd on January 30, 2016. The Coca-Cola Company acquired the remaining 60% stake in Chi Ltd on January 30, 2019. In 2017, the Coca-Cola Company acquired Mexican sparkling water brand Topo Chico. On August 31, 2018, it agreed to acquire Costa Coffee from Whitbread for £3.9bn. The acquisition closed on January 3, 2019. During August 2018, the Coca-Cola Company acquired Moxie for an undisclosed amount. On August 14, 2018, the Coca-Cola Company announced a minority interest in Body Armor. On September 19, 2018, the Coca-Cola Company acquired Organic &amp; Raw Trading Co. Pty Ltd the manufacturer of MOJO Kombucha in Willunga, Australia.

==Revenue and sales==

According to the Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s 2005 annual report, it had sold beverage products in more than 200 countries that year. The 2005 report further states that of the approximately 50 billion beverage servings of all types consumed worldwide, daily, beverages bearing the trademarks owned by or licensed to Coca-Cola account for more than 1.3 billion. Of these, beverages bearing the trademark &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; or &quot;Coke&quot; accounted for approximately 55% of the company&#x27;s total gallon sales.

In 2010, it was announced that Coca-Cola had become the first brand to top £1 billion in annual UK grocery sales. In 2017, Coca-Cola sales were down 11% from the year before due to consumer tastes shifting away from sugary drinks.

==Stock==

Since 1919, Coca-Cola has been a publicly traded company. Its stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol &quot;KO&quot;. One share of stock purchased in 1919 for $40, with all dividends reinvested, would have been worth $9.8 million in 2012, a 10.7% annual increase adjusted for inflation. A predecessor bank of SunTrust received $100,000 for underwriting Coca-Cola&#x27;s 1919 public offering; the bank sold that stock for over $2 billion in 2012. In 1987, Coca-Cola once again became one of the 30 stocks which makes up the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is commonly referenced as a proxy for stock market performance; it had previously been a Dow stock from 1932 to 1935. Coca-Cola has paid a dividend since 1920 and, as of 2019, had increased it each year for 57 years straight.

==Staff and management==

The following are key management as of March 2023 (excluding VP positions and regional leaders):
The following are all directors as of March 2023:

==Bottlers==
In general, the Coca-Cola Company and its subsidiaries only produce syrup concentrate, as well as sourcing beverage base including coffee beans, tea leaf, juices, etc., which is then sold to various bottlers throughout the world who hold a local Coca-Cola franchise. Coca-Cola bottlers, who hold territorially exclusive contracts with the company, produce the finished product in packages from the concentrate and beverage base, in combination with filtered water and sweeteners. The bottlers then sell, distribute, and merchandise the Coca-Cola product to retail stores, vending machines, restaurants, and food service distributors. Outside the United States, these bottlers also control the fountain business.

Since the 1980s, the company has actively encouraged the consolidation of bottlers, with the company often owning a share of these &quot;anchor bottlers&quot;.

In January 2006, the company formed the Bottling Investments Group (BIG), by bringing company-owned bottling operations together to strategically invest in select bottling operations, temporarily taking them under Coca-Cola ownership, and utilizing the leadership and resources of the company. Also, the company has accelerated refranchising both company-owned bottlers and independent bottling partners to consolidate their operations and move away from the capital-intensive and low-margin business of bottling, with maintaining minor share ownership of these consolidated bottlers and secure the right to nominate directors and/or executives through shareholders agreement and/or capital and business alliance agreement.

As a result of the refranchising and bottler consolidations, multi-national/large-scale bottlers and three U.S.-based bottlers now dominate the manufacturing and distribution of the company&#x27;s products except the territories managed by BIG bottlers.

In 2021, the company announced its intention to list Coca-Cola Beverages Africa as a publicly traded company. However, in June 2022 it announced that it was delaying this plan, pending an evaluation of macroeconomic conditions.
==Products and brands==


As of 2020, the Coca-Cola Company offers more than 500 brands in over 200 countries. In September 2020, the company announced that it would cut more than half of its brands, as a result of the economic effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Non-food assets===

====Columbia Pictures====
Coca-Cola bought Columbia Pictures in 1982, owing to the low monetary value of the studio. The film company was the first and only studio ever owned by Coca-Cola. During its ownership of the studio, Columbia released many popular films including &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Stripes&quot;, &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, and some others. However, two years after the critical and commercial failure of the 1987 film &quot;Ishtar&quot;, Columbia was spun-off and then sold to Tokyo-based Sony in 1989.

====World of Coca-Cola====
Coca-Cola operates a soft drink themed tourist attraction in Atlanta, Georgia; the World of Coca-Cola is a multi-storied exhibition. It features flavor sampling and a history museum, with locations in Las Vegas, Nevada, and Lake Buena Vista, Florida.

===Brands===
====Other soft drinks====

The Coca-Cola Company also produces a number of other soft drinks including Fanta (introduced circa 1941), Sprite and Lilt, which was discontinued after 50 years and renamed Fanta Pineapple &amp; Grapefruit. Fanta&#x27;s origins date back to World War II during a trade embargo against Germany on cola syrup, making it impossible to sell Coca-Cola in Germany. Max Keith, the head of Coca-Cola&#x27;s German office during the war, decided to create a new product for the German market, made only from products available in Germany at the time, which they named Fanta. The drink proved to be a hit, and when Coke took over again after the war, it adopted the Fanta brand as well. Fanta was originally an orange-flavored soft drink that can come in plastic bottles or cans. It has become available in many different flavors now such as grape, peach, apple, pineapple, and strawberry.

In 1961, Coca-Cola introduced Sprite, a lemon-lime soft drink, another of the company&#x27;s bestsellers and its response to 7 Up.

Tab was Coca-Cola&#x27;s first attempt to develop a diet soft drink, using saccharin as a sugar substitute. Introduced in 1963, the product was sold until fall 2020, although its sales had dwindled since the introduction of Diet Coke.

Coca-Cola South Africa also released Valpre Bottled &quot;still&quot; and &quot;sparkling&quot; water.

In 1969, the company released Simba, which was a take on Mountain Dew, and had packaging that was African desert-themed, replete with an African Lion as the symbol of the brand. The tagline was &quot;Simba – It Conquers the African Thirst.&quot;

Also in 1969, the company released a line of products under the name of Santiba, which was targeted for mixing cocktails and party usage, products including Quinine water and Ginger Ale. Like the above-mentioned Simba, the Santiba line of products was short-lived in the marketplace.

====BreakMate====
No longer manufactured, the Coca-Cola BreakMate was a three-flavor dispenser introduced by Coca-Cola and Siemens in 1988. Intended for use in offices with five to fifty people, its refrigerated compartment held three individual one-litre plastic containers of soda syrup and a CO2 tank. Like a soda fountain, it mixed syrup in a 1:5 ratio with carbonated water. In North America, Coca-Cola discontinued spare BreakMate parts in 2007 and stopped distributing the syrup in 2010.

====Healthy beverages====
During the 1990s, the company responded to the growing consumer interest in healthy beverages by introducing several new non-carbonated beverage brands. These included Minute Maid Juices to Go, Powerade sports beverage, flavored tea Nestea (in a joint venture with Nestlé), Fruitopia fruit drink, and Dasani water, among others. In 2001, the Minute Maid division launched the Simply Orange brand of juices including orange juice. In 2016, Coca-Cola India introduced Vio to enter into the value-added dairy category. The product lays the foundation for Coca-Cola&#x27;s new segment after carbonated beverages, water and juices.

In 2004, perhaps in response to the burgeoning popularity of low-carbohydrate diets such as the Atkins diet, Coca-Cola announced its intention to develop and sell a low-carbohydrate alternative to Coke Classic, dubbed C2 Cola. C2 contains a mix of high fructose corn syrup, aspartame, sucralose, and Acesulfame potassium. C2 is designed to more closely emulate the taste of Coca-Cola Classic. Even with less than half of the food energy and carbohydrates of standard soft drinks, C2 is not a replacement for zero-calorie soft drinks such as Diet Coke. C2 went on sale in the U.S. on June 11, 2004, and in Canada in August 2004; it was replaced in 2013 by Coca-Cola Life.

Starting in 2009, the Coca-Cola Company invested in Innocent Drinks, first with a minor stake, increasing to 90% in the first quarter of 2013.

It was in May 2014 when Finley, a sparkling fruit-flavored drink, was launched in France. It was launched in other countries later, including Belgium and Luxembourg in September 2014. Coca-Cola first started developing the drink in Belgium in 2001. As of 2014, the drink is targeted for adults, and is low in sugar with four flavors.

====Best selling====
Coca-Cola is the best-selling soft drink in most countries, and was recognized as the number one global brand in 2010. While the Middle East is one of the few regions in the world where Coca-Cola is not the number one soda drink, Coca-Cola nonetheless holds almost 25% market share (to Pepsi&#x27;s 75%) and had double-digit growth in 2003. Similarly, in Scotland, where the locally produced Irn-Bru was once more popular, 2005 figures show that both Coca-Cola and Diet Coke now outsell Irn-Bru. In Peru, the native Inca Kola has been more popular than Coca-Cola, which prompted Coca-Cola to enter in negotiations with the soft drink&#x27;s company and buy 50% of its stakes. In Japan, the best selling soft drink is not cola, as (canned) tea and coffee are more popular. As such, the Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s best selling brand there is not Coca-Cola, but Georgia. In May 2016, the Coca-Cola Company temporarily halted production of its signature drink in Venezuela due to sugar shortages. Since then, the Coca-Cola Company has been using &quot;minimum inventories of raw material&quot; to make their signature drinks at two production plants in Venezuela.

====Information====
On July 6, 2006, a Coca-Cola employee and two other people were arrested and charged with trying to sell trade secret information to the soft drink maker&#x27;s competitor PepsiCo for $1.5 million. The recipe for Coca-Cola, perhaps the company&#x27;s most closely guarded secret, was never in jeopardy; instead, the information was related to a new beverage in development. Coca-Cola executives verified that the trade secret documents in question were genuine and proprietary to the company. At least one glass vial containing a sample of a new drink was offered for sale, court documents said. The conspiracy was revealed by PepsiCo, which notified authorities when it was approached by the conspirators.

====Green tea====
The company announced a new &quot;negative calorie&quot; green tea drink, Enviga, in 2006, along with trying coffee retail concepts Far Coast and Chaqwa.

====Glaceau====
On May 25, 2007, Coca-Cola announced it would purchase Glaceau, a maker of flavored vitamin-enhanced drinks (vitamin water), flavored waters, and Burn energy drinks, for $4.1 billion in cash.

====Huiyuan Juice====
On September 3, 2008, Coca-Cola announced its intention to make cash offers to purchase China Huiyuan Juice Group Limited (which had a 42% share of the Chinese pure fruit juice market) for US$2.4bn (HK$12.20 per share). China&#x27;s ministry of commerce blocked the deal on March 18, 2009, arguing that the deal would hurt small local juice companies, could have pushed up juice market prices, and limited consumers&#x27; choices.

====Coke Mini can====
In October 2009, Coca-Cola revealed its new 90-calorie mini can that holds 7.5 fluid ounces. The mini can is often sold in 8 packs. Despite costing nearly 30 percent more per ounce, the mini cans have been met with positive sales figures.

====Holiday can====
In November 2011, Coca-Cola revealed a seasonal design for its regular Coke cans as part of a partnership with the World Wildlife Fund. However, it was withdrawn only a month after release due to consumer complaints about a similar look to the silver cans commonly used for Diet Coke. There were also complaints about deviating from traditional red as the color of Coca-Cola cans previously.

====Stake in Monster Beverage====
It was announced on August 14, 2014, that the Coca-Cola Company was making a cash payment of $2.15 billion for a 16.7 percent stake in Monster Beverage Corp to expand its market for energy drinks, with Coke to transfer ownership in Full Throttle and Burn to Monster and Monster to transfer its ownership in Hansen&#x27;s Natural Sodas, Peace Iced Tea, and Blue Sky Soda to the Coca-Cola Company. Muhtar Kent, Coke&#x27;s former chief executive officer, stated that the company has the option to increase its stake to 25 percent but could not exceed that percentage in the next four years.

====Alcoholic beverages====
In 2021, the Coca-Cola Co used its Mexican sparkling mineral water brand Topo Chico to launch a range of vegan friendly alcoholic hard seltzers in the United Kingdom and in the United States.

==Advertising==

Coca-Cola advertising has &quot;been among the most prolific in marketing history,&quot; with a notable and major impact on popular culture and society. The company in recent years has spent approximately an annual $4 billion globally to promote its drinks to the public; and spent approximately $4.24 billion on advertising in fiscal year 2019, most of which was spent to advertise Coca-Cola.

Coca-Cola advertises through direct marketing, web-based media, social media, text messaging, and sales promotions. The company also markets via mobile marketing in text messages, e.g. viral marketing campaigns.

Fan engagement spans 86 million globally across social media channels: online interaction, and social, cultural, or sporting events.

In the retail setting, direct store beverage delivery trucks (mobile advertising) as well as point of sale coolers and vending machines have bright red logo blazoned branding.

==Front groups==
As part of its corporate propaganda campaign to deflect public attention away from the harmful health effects of its sugary drinks, the Coca-Cola Company has funded front organizations.

The Beverage Institute for Health and Wellness was led by Rhona S. Applebaum, who was also the Coca-Cola Company&#x27;s Chief Science and Health Officer. It was announced in 2005, when Coca-Cola executive Donald Short, then the company&#x27;s vice president, published a paper about his company&#x27;s commitments to consumers&#x27; health in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. Their paid advisers include Baylor College of Medicine researcher John Foreyt. The Institute &quot;sponsors continuing professional education for registered dietitians, nurses and other professionals.&quot; This has led critics to say that &quot;corporate influence is both tainting the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics&#x27;s reputation and affecting its positions.&quot;

The company funded creation of the front organization the Global Energy Balance Network (GEBN) to address the growing evidence that the company&#x27;s products are a leading cause of the epidemic of childhood obesity in the United States and the growing number of Americans, including children, with type 2 diabetes. GEBN designed its own studies to arrive at conclusions set in advance and cherry picked data to support its corporate public relations agenda. After an August 2015 investigative report exposed the GEBN as a Coca-Cola Company front organization, GEBN was shut down.

Three years after the shutdown of GEBN, the company, together with several other junk food giants, was revealed to be behind an initiative in China called &quot;Happy 10 Minutes&quot;, funded through a group called the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI). The aim of the initiative was to address decades of research on diet-related diseases, such as Type 2 diabetes and hypertension, by promoting physical exercise to the population but avoiding discussion of the link between such diseases and junk foods, including sugary drinks. ILSI through the 1980s and 1990s had been promoting the tobacco industry&#x27;s agenda in Europe and the United States.

==Sponsorship==
Coca-Cola&#x27;s advertising expenses accounted for US$3.256 billion in 2011.

===Sports===
Coca-Cola sponsored the English Football League from the beginning of the 2004–05 season (beginning August 2004) to the start of 2010–11 season, when the Football League replaced it with NPower. Along with this, Coca-Cola sponsored the Coca-Cola Football Camp, that took place in Pretoria, South Africa during the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

Other major sponsorships include the AFL, NHRA, NASCAR, the PGA Tour, NCAA Championships, the Olympic Games, the NRL, the FIFA World Cups, Premier League and the UEFA European Championships. The company partnered with Panini to produce the first virtual sticker album for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, and they have collaborated for every World Cup since. Each fall, Coca-Cola is the sponsor of the TOUR Championship by Coca-Cola held at the East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta, Georgia. The Tour Championship is the season-ending tournament of the PGA Tour. In the Philippines, it had a team in the Philippine Basketball Association, the Powerade Tigers.

In 2017, Major League Baseball signed a multi-year deal with Coca-Cola to be the official soft drink, replacing Pepsi. Nineteen MLB teams (Los Angeles Angels, Houston Astros, Toronto Blue Jays, Atlanta Braves, St. Louis Cardinals, Los Angeles Dodgers, San Francisco Giants, Seattle Mariners, New York Mets, Washington Nationals, San Diego Padres, Philadelphia Phillies, Pittsburgh Pirates, Texas Rangers, Tampa Bay Rays, Cincinnati Reds, Boston Red Sox, Colorado Rockies and Chicago White Sox ) have Coca-Cola products sold in their ballparks. In 2023, the Chicago Cubs and Milwaukee Brewers added Coca-Cola as the official soft drink.

In October 2018, Coca-Cola started sponsoring the Formula 1 team McLaren with several 1 year deals being signed since then.

Since 2019, Coca-Cola has been the title sponsor of the Uzbekistan Super League in soccer, which is officially called &quot;Coca-Cola Uzbekistan Super League&quot;.
Coca-Cola has also sponsored the Overwatch league since season two. They also sponsor all major Overwatch tournaments such as the world cup

In February 2020, Coca-Cola became the title sponsor for the eNASCAR iRacing series.

In February 2025, Coca-Cola became a sponsor of the Northern Super League, the top women&#x27;s soccer league in Canada.

===Television===
Coca-Cola sponsored Walt Disney&#x27;s first television show &quot;One Hour in Wonderland&quot; broadcast on Christmas Day 1950.

Coca-Cola sponsored the 1965 airing of the television special &quot;A Charlie Brown Christmas&quot;.

Coca-Cola also sponsored the popular Fox singing-competition series &quot;American Idol&quot; from 2002 until 2014.

Coca-Cola was a sponsor of the nightly talk show on PBS, &quot;Charlie Rose&quot; in the US.

Coca-Cola is also an executive producer of Coke Studio (Pakistan). It was a franchising that started in Brazil, broadcast by MTV Brasil and there are various adaptations of Coke Studio such as Coke Studio (India), Coke Studio Bangla and Coke Studio Africa.

===Theme parks===
While not necessarily having naming rights to anything in all locations, the company does sponsor and provide beverages in many theme parks, usually in an exclusive capacity. This includes the Disney Experiences, Merlin Entertainment, Universal Destinations &amp; Experiences, Six Flags, Cedar Fair, and United Parks &amp; Resorts which are six of the nine largest theme park operators worldwide (it is unknown whether OCT Parks China, the Chimelong Group, or Fantawild, the fourth, seventh, and eighth largest theme park operators respectively, use Coca-Cola).

The company also formerly sponsored, with naming rights, the Coca-Cola London Eye and the Coca-Cola Orlando Eye.

The company also operates &quot;Coca-Cola&quot; visitor centers in Israel, Belgium and Turkey.

==Consumer relations and civic involvement==
After Martin Luther King Jr. won the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize, plans for an interracial celebratory dinner in still-segregated Atlanta were not initially well supported by the city&#x27;s business elite until Coca-Cola intervened.

Throughout 2012, Coca-Cola contributed $1,700,500 to a $46 million political campaign known as &quot;The Coalition Against The Costly Food Labeling Proposition, sponsored by Farmers and Food Producers&quot;. This organization was set up to oppose a citizen&#x27;s initiative, known as Proposition 37, demanding mandatory labeling of foods containing genetically modified ingredients.

In 2012, Coca-Cola was listed as a partner of the (RED) campaign, together with other brands such as Nike, Girl, American Express, and Converse. The campaign&#x27;s mission is to prevent the transmission of the HIV virus from mother to child by 2015 (the campaign&#x27;s byline is &quot;Fighting for an AIDS Free Generation&quot;).

In 2024 Coca-Cola sponsored the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump

In 2025, Coca-Cola gifted President Donald Trump with a custom Coke bottle commemorating his inauguration.

==Criticism==
Since the early 2000s, the criticisms over the use of Coca-Cola products as well as the company itself, escalated with concerns over health effects, environmental issues, animal testing, economic business practices and employee issues. The Coca-Cola Company has been faced with multiple lawsuits concerning these various criticisms.

=== Plastic production and waste ===

The Coca-Cola Company produces over 3 million tonnes of plastic packaging each year including 110 billion plastic bottles.

The company has been referenced as &quot;the worst plastic polluter in the world&quot; pumping out 200,000 plastic bottles a minute. Problems also arose in places such as Samoa where Coca-Cola switched away from reusable glass bottles to one time use plastic bottles. Residents of Samoa have seen an increase in plastic pollution since this switch has been made. Alternatives to plastic such as aluminum have also been overlooked with Coca-Cola releasing a new plastic bottle slightly bigger than a can size.

The magazine &quot;Forbes&quot; has labeled Coca-Cola as the world&#x27;s most polluting brand. The company&#x27;s global chief executive stated that &quot;Coca-Cola has no plans to reduce its use of plastic bottles&quot; and opposes bottle bill legislation, as consumers prefer the plastic bottles that &quot;reseal and are lightweight&quot;. They also contribute to plastic waste producing up to three million tons of plastic packaging a year including over 110 billion plastic bottles.

In 2018, Coca-Cola pledged to use 50% recycled materials in its packaging and to recycle the equivalent of 100% of its packaging by 2030. That same year, the company started to sell reusable bottles in Brazil, which customers could return to the point of sale for a discount of subsequent purchases. The initiative was expanded to several other South American countries by 2022. In 2019, the company&#x27;s Swedish branch marked the first to fully transition to recyclable bottles by 2020.

==== Sustainability misses ====
In December 2024, Coca-Cola announced adjustments to its sustainability goals, specifically revising its target to recycle the equivalent of 100 percent of its packaging by 2030. The company has acknowledged that it will not meet this goal as initially set. Instead, Coca-Cola has decided to focus on other sustainability measures, which has sparked discussions among environmental advocates and industry analysts.

In 2023, Coca-Cola&#x27;s packaging composition included 47.7% plastic, 26% aluminum, and 10.4% glass. The company&#x27;s efforts towards increasing the reuse of packaging have been limited, with only 1.2% of its packaging being reusable in the previous year. Additionally, Coca-Cola has increased its use of virgin plastics by approximately 6% since 2019.

=== Energy usage of corn syrup manufacturing ===
Coca-Cola&#x27;s use of high-fructose corn syrup is less sustainable when compared to producing sugary drinks with sugar cane. High-fructose corn syrup is carbon intensive due to the substantial amounts of fossil fuels required to power heavy machinery. Turning corn into high-fructose corn syrup is an energy intensive process requiring large amounts of carbon to be expended especially during corn growth. Burning fossil fuels releases and which is the main source of energy for producing high-fructose corn syrup. The environmental impact of corn production can be attributed to three primary effects of field emissions, irrigation and grain decay.

=== Water usage ===
Coca-Cola has also been under fire for depleting water sources through their high water usages. Local villagers have testified that Coca-Cola&#x27;s entry in Kaladera Rajasthan intensified lower water sources. Documents from the government&#x27;s water ministry reveal water levels remained stable from 1995 until 2000, when the Coca-Cola was first operational. Water levels then dropped by almost ten meters during the next five years. Other communities in India that are located around Coca-Cola&#x27;s bottling plants are experiencing water shortages as well as environmental damage taking heavy tolls on harvests as well as drying up wells.

=== Racial discrimination ===
In November 2000, Coca-Cola agreed to pay $192.5 million to settle a class action racial discrimination lawsuit and promised to change the way it manages, promotes, and treats minority employees in the US. In 2003, protesters at Coca-Cola&#x27;s annual meeting claimed that black people remained underrepresented in top management at the company, were paid less than white employees, and fired more often. In 2004, Luke Visconti, a co-founder of DiversityInc, which rates companies on their diversity efforts, said: &quot;Because of the settlement decree, Coca-Cola was forced to put in management practices that have put the company in the top 10 for diversity.&quot;

In March 2012, 16 workers of color sued Coca-Cola, claiming they had to work in a &quot;cesspool of racial discrimination&quot;.

In February 2021, recordings of an employee training course were leaked on social media. The course instructed employees to &quot;be less white&quot;, which the course equated with being less &quot;arrogant&quot; and &quot;oppressive&quot;.

<text>Project Brass Ring was a 1950 United States Air Force project designed to deliver an early hydrogen bomb to within of a target using a drone version of the B-47 Stratojet, which would be guided by a mother ship and destroyed in the detonation. This project was given considerable support, due to uncertainty concerning the possible yield of a hydrogen bomb, then estimated to lie between 10 and 40 megatons. Brass Ring was meant to provide an interim nuclear weapons delivery capability while more capable (and less costly) systems were under development. The fear and concern surrounding the Soviet Union&#x27;s development of its own nuclear weapons capability was the impetus to quickly begin the project. Project Brass Ring was similar in concept to the World War II Operation Aphrodite.

<text>Tardebigge () is a village in Worcestershire, England.

The village is most famous for the Tardebigge Locks, a flight of 30 canal locks that raise the Worcester and Birmingham Canal over over the Lickey Ridge. It lies in the county of Worcestershire, although it was also historically an exclave of Staffordshire or Warwickshire at different times in its history.

==Toponymy==

&quot;Tyrde Bicgan&quot; is Old English for &quot;big tower&quot; or &quot;tower on a hill,&quot; reflecting the position of the church. It was called &quot;Terdeberie&quot; in the Domesday book and subsequently spelt &quot;Tardebigg&quot;, &quot;Tardebig&quot;, and &quot;Tarbick&quot;.

Eilert Ekwall, however, writes that the name &quot;Tærdebicga&quot; has no likely meaning in Old English or Celtic and calls it &quot;unexplained&quot;.

==History==

Tardebigge was once a much greater township, which included much of Redditch, including the modern day town-centre. Its name was recorded twice in a will as Anglo-Saxon &quot;æt Tærdebicgan&quot;.

Records of the parish begin in the late 10th century. Tardebigge was bought by the Dean of Worcester for his Church from King Ethelred the Unready. In the later Dark Ages there were battles fought between Ethelred&#x27;s son Edmund Ironside and Cnut the Dane.

In the 12th century, the parish was granted to Bordesley Abbey. For three hundred years the area remained in the Church&#x27;s possession. In 1538 the Roman Catholic Church was disestablished by King Henry VIII, and the area became the possession of The Crown, until under an arrangement with Henry, the possessions of Bordesley Abbey passed to Andrew Lord Windsor, and therefore to the stewardship of the Earl of Plymouth at adjacent Hewell Grange. The land was gradually managed and sold off by the Earl; it was not until the mid 19th century that the parish of Tardebigge began to dissolve and the modern boundaries began to appear.

==St Bartholomew&#x27;s Church==
The local parish church of St Bartholomew by Francis Hiorne of 1777 contains an impressive monument to Sir Thomas Cookes, 2nd Baronet, the benefactor of Worcester College, Oxford, as well as several monuments to the Earls of Plymouth who lived at adjacent Hewell Grange. Several members of the earls&#x27; families are buried in the cemetery of St Bartholomew&#x27;s, including Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth, GBE, CB, PC (1857–1923), and his parents-in-law, Sir Augustus Berkeley Paget, GCB (1823–1896), and Walburga, Lady Paget (1839–1929), the diarist, writer and friend of Queen Victoria.


==Economy==
===Worcester and Birmingham Canal===
The village contains the Tardebigge Locks, a flight of 36 canal locks that raise the Worcester and Birmingham Canal over over the Lickey Ridge.

===Building material===
The area was well known for the manufacture of bricks during the 18th and 19th century. There is little industry in the village remaining, apart from minor canal narrow boat repairing works.

===Fruit and cider===
The area become predominantly a fruit growing area until the end of the 20th century with the famous Tardebigge orchards supplying produce to the Birmingham conurbation. Most of these orchards were grubbed up in the 1970s and 1980s with the last orchard being removed in 2000, when cheaper imported fruit replaced the home grown produce. The only orchard planted recently is the small orchard of Tardebigge Cider.

Tardebigge Cider is a craft cider maker based in Tutnall, about from the church. The cidermaker Steve Cooper planted a mixed orchard of traditional apple varieties of about 100 trees in 1995. The varieties are primarily Dabinett, Michelin, and Harry Masters Jersey with a few culinary varieties included along with some pears, Moorcroft and Worcester Black. The fruit from these trees and other Worcestershire fruit go to make about of high quality cider which is only sold locally.

===Local Enterprise===
For many years, Tardebigge has been home to The Barns Rural Business Park, which is a collection of many local SME businesses. There is a good mix of businesses, including industrial and manufacturing, artists, beauty and holistic, as well as an on-site tea room.

<doc id="914891" wikidata="Q138627" url="?curid=914891" title="David Wilkie (swimmer)">
<text>David Andrew Wilkie (8 March 1954 – 22 May 2024) was a Scottish swimmer who was the Olympic 200m breaststroke champion in 1976, the first British swimmer to win an Olympic gold medal since Anita Lonsbrough in 1960. He is the only person to have held British, Commonwealth, European, World and Olympic swimming titles at the same time. Wilkie, a member of the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame and the International Swimming Hall of Fame, has been described as Scotland&#x27;s greatest and Britain&#x27;s finest swimmer. Fellow Olympic breaststroke gold medallist Duncan Goodhew considered him an &quot;extraordinary talent&quot; and &quot;one of Britain&#x27;s greatest ever athletes&quot;.

==Early days==
David Wilkie&#x27;s parents came from Aberdeen, Scotland, but were stationed in Colombo, Ceylon, when Wilkie was born on 8 March 1954. His family regularly patronised the open air Colombo Swimming Club, where Wilkie learned to swim.

When he was 11 years old his parents sent him to Scotland as a boarding school pupil at Daniel Stewart&#x27;s College in Edinburgh, and, while a pupil there, he joined the Warrender Baths Club, one of Scotland&#x27;s most successful swimming clubs. It was there that he began to train intensively and develop his specialist stroke, the breaststroke under one of Britain&#x27;s leading coaches Frank Thomas, whom Wilkie credited with giving him the motivation to become a world class swimmer. In 1969, Wilkie was chosen to join the elite Scottish Training Squad organised by the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association.

==National and international success==
In 1969, Wilkie swam representing Britain for the first time in an international swimming contest, where he came up against the Russian 200-metre breaststroke world record-holder Nikolai Pankin.

Wilkie broke the British record for the 200-metre breaststroke in an international match against Denmark in July 1970. He then won a bronze medal in front of his home crowd in the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh in the 200-metre breaststroke breaking his own British record again. He wore a swim cap for that event during the Commonwealth Games, making him the first elite swimmer to wear one in a major competition.

In 1970, the Scottish Amateur Swimming Association awarded Wilkie the Nancy Riach Memorial Medal Award (awarded to the person who has the done the most to enhance or uphold the prestige of Scottish Swimming during the year) and the W.G. Todd Cup and Prize (Junior Swimmer of the Year). This was the first time in the Association&#x27;s history that both awards had gone to the same person in the same year. Wilkie continued to hold the Nancy Riach award every year from 1972 to 1976.

At the Scottish national long course championships in 1972, Wilkie won five events. However Wilkie&#x27;s world breakthrough came when he won silver in the 200-metre breaststroke at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany, in a European record time of 2:23:67 in spite of being ranked only 25th in the world. He also broke the Scottish record times for the 100-metre breaststroke and the 200-metre individual medley.

Starting in 1973, Wilkie was studying and swimming in the United States. He won the World Championship for 200-metre breaststroke in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and broke the world record.

At the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, New Zealand, he won a gold in the 200-metre breaststroke, a second gold in the 200-metre individual medley, and a silver in the 100-metre breaststroke. Also in 1974 at the European Championships in Vienna, Austria, he won a gold in the 200-metre individual medley in a world record time. He also won gold for the 200-metre breaststroke and silver as a member of the British 4x100-metre medley relay team. From 1972 to 1976 he was unbeaten in 200-metre breaststroke races.

==Olympic gold==
However, it was after several years of further intensive training, while studying at the University of Miami on an athletic scholarship and competing for the university&#x27;s Miami Hurricanes swimming and diving team, that Wilkie&#x27;s finest hour came. He won gold in the 200-metre breaststroke at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal, in a world-record time of 2:15:11 and preventing an American sweep of the men&#x27;s swimming gold medals. He also added a 100-metre silver medal to his collection in a time of 1:03:43. His world record was to remain unbroken for six years.

Wilkie won three Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) National US Championships and three NCAA Men&#x27;s Swimming and Diving Championships (NCAA) US college championships while at Miami, was four times All-American and was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame in 1987. The head swimming coach there was Bill Diaz and his individual coach was Charlie Hodgson.

He was European Swimmer of the Year three times, British Sports personality of the year in 1975, in 1977 he was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire, in 1982 he was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame and in 2002 was inducted into the Scottish Sports Hall of Fame.

==After competitive swimming==
Following his retirement, Wilkie remained active in the world of swimming, involved in swimming aids and technology. He was said to be the first swimmer to wear a head-cap and goggles together in competition to improve the streamline effect within the water although he also said he wore the goggles because of an allergy to chlorine in the water and the cap to keep his long hair in.

Wilkie co-founded a healthcare company called Health Perception (UK) Ltd. in 1986. It was sold to William Ransom and Son plc in 2004 for £7.8 million. In 1985 he met his Swedish partner Helen Isacson with whom he had two children, Natasha and Adam who were 23 and 20 in 2013. In 2009 he helped found Pet&#x27;s Kitchen, a pet food company supplying British supermarkets.

In an interview with bunkered.co.uk in April 2016, Wilkie criticised the re-introduction of golf to the Olympic Games. He called Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player&#x27;s claims that the Olympics would grow the game globally as &quot;absolute bullshit&quot;, while he also said that players who did not stay in Rio de Janeiro for the duration of the Games could not be classed as true Olympians.

=== &quot;The David Wilkie problem&quot; ===
In 2017, BBC News reported that Wilkie (then aged 62) &quot;was accused of swimming too fast&quot; in his local Virgin Active swimming pool. Wilkie quit his Virgin Active membership and joined another gym. &quot;Outdoor Swimmer&quot; magazine subsequently coined the phrase &quot;the David Wilkie problem&quot;, meaning &quot;the issue of how swimming pools manage their facilities to provide swimmers with a wide range of abilities, aspirations and expectations the best possible experience. The fact that &#x27;lane rage&#x27; exists suggests that currently, they don&#x27;t do a very good job of it.&quot;

==Death==
Wilkie died of cancer on 22 May 2024, at the age of 70.

<doc id="914895" wikidata="Q459495" url="?curid=914895" title="Beşiktaş">
<text>Beşiktaş () is a district and municipality of Istanbul Province, Turkey. Its area is 18 km2 and its population is 175,190 (2022). It is located on the European shore of the Bosphorus strait. It is bordered on the north by Sarıyer and Şişli, on the west by Kağıthane and Şişli, on the south by Beyoğlu, and on the east by the Bosphorus. Directly across the Bosphorus is the district of Üsküdar.

The district includes a number of important sites along the European shore of the Bosphorus, from Dolmabahçe Palace in the south to the Bebek area in the north. It is also home to many inland (and relatively expensive, upper-middle class) neighborhoods such as Levent and Etiler. Some of its other well-known neighborhoods include Yıldız, Kuruçeşme, Ortaköy, and Arnavutköy.

Beşiktaş&#x27; historic commercial centre is the Beşiktaş quarter and Çarşı (literally, &quot;marketplace&quot;), which adjoins the small Abbasağa Park. Running in the north–south direction, Barbaros Boulevard is a major feeder road for the inner-city motorway Otoyol 1 and the Bosphorus Bridge, terminating at the important public transport hub of Zincirlikuyu. Büyükdere Avenue also runs through the district.

Although it is a relatively small district of Istanbul, both in terms of population and area, Beşiktaş is one of the city&#x27;s most important areas due to its business and shopping areas, historic sites, universities, scenic views of the Bosphorus strait, and feeder roads for the Bosphorus and Fatih Sultan Mehmet bridges passing through it. The district is also the leading financial center of Turkey.

In a 2013 ranking of Turkish districts, Beşiktaş placed first overall due to its high quality of life, prosperity, and cultural level. Beşiktaş is also the highest ranking Turkish district in terms of the Human Development Index, with an HDI of 0.864, while also ranking first in the individual indexes for income and education. The municipality is taking part in the Cities4Europe campaign and has qualified as a &quot;European 12 Star City&quot;.

==Name==
The district takes its name from the Beşiktaş quarter located in the modern-day Sinanpaşa neighborhood. Along with Çarşı, this historic center is sometimes referred to as &quot;Köyiçi&quot; (roughly &quot;inner village&quot;) by locals.

The word &quot;beşik&quot; means &quot;cradle&quot; in Turkish, while &quot;taş&quot; means &quot;stone&quot;.

According to one story, there was a Byzantine church in modern-day Beşiktaş with the name Kounopetra, Greek for &quot;stone cradle&quot;. The church was built to honor a relic, a stone reportedly taken from the stable in Bethlehem where Jesus was born. This stone was later relocated to Hagia Sophia and disappeared during the Fourth Crusade, possibly to be sold in Europe&#x27;s relics market.

Another story states that a cleric from a Saint Menas (Aya Menas) Church where Beşiktaş now is returned from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem with a cradle-shaped stone used in the baptism of Jesus and placed it in the church.

One other explanation is that the name is a corruption of &quot;beş taş&quot;, Turkish for &quot;five stones&quot;, referring to the five stone pillars built to moor ships by Barbarossa Hayreddin Pasha.

==History==

The Bosphorus has been settled for a long time, and there are many places of historical interest in Beşiktaş. The area is believed to have been settled by Constantine the Great during his reign (306–337 CE). This stretch of the Bosphorus shore is somewhat sheltered from the strong northeasterly winds that bring storms to Istanbul, and thus it forms an ideal mooring place for ships.

In Byzantine times, the area was called &quot;Diplokionion&quot;, meaning &quot;double pillar&quot; in Greek, as it was the location of a set of twin pillars marking a key entry from the water into Constantinople. These columns would later provide the model for the twin pillars at the water&#x27;s edge in Venice.

In ancient times the villages on the Bosphorus shore were isolated communities in the forest that lined the water-side. The Bosphorus, however, was prominent in the history and mythology of the ancient Greeks, and villages like Beşiktaş would have had their place in traditional tales such as &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;. In the Byzantine era, churches and a monastery were built and the tradition of having a summer palace on the Bosphorus was begun by the Byzantines with their Ayios Mamas palace complex. The Bosphorus settlements, however, being outside the city walls, were vulnerable to raiders from the Black Sea coasts, and little of this architecture or the statuary that would have decorated it so gloriously has survived.

In the Ottoman period, once the Sultans had established control of the Black Sea coasts, the Ottoman navy was docked in the Bosphorus and the Bosphorus villages became safe and attractive again. One man, in particular, the sailor Barbarossa Hayreddin, built his palace and mosque in Beşiktaş, making it his home. By now Beşiktaş was an established Bosphorus crossing for caravans trading across Anatolia and along the Silk Road, and for Ottoman armies.

According to Ottoman estimations of 1882, the district of Beşiktaş had a total population of 28,777, consisting of 10,753 Muslims, 9,248 Greeks, 4,897 Armenians, 3,057 Jews, 601 Catholics, 203 Bulgarians and 18 Latins.

This coast was very attractive to the Ottoman rulers, who built hunting lodges and then great palaces in the area, and the Beşiktaş district today contains some of the most important and grand Ottoman buildings. The area was thus the scene of great intrigues of the late Ottoman period such as the dethronement of Sultan Abdülaziz at Dolmabahçe Palace in a coup in 1876, the announcement of the founding of the Ottoman parliament in 1908, and the deposing of Sultan Abdul Hamid II at Yıldız Palace in 1909.

Following the foundation of the Turkish Republic in 1923, the Ottoman ruling family was deported and the palaces and mansions along the coast were emptied. Some were given to new government ministries, some used as schools and other public buildings, others burnt down or were demolished.

Today, it is widely accepted by the residents of the area that the most significant resident of Beşiktaş was Zübeyde Hanım, the mother of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, who lived in the old quarter at the heart of Beşiktaş, literally right next to the then headquarters of Beşiktaş J.K.

Besides the more historic areas such as Yıldız, Ortaköy, Kuruçeşme, Arnavutköy, Bebek, many residential areas in the district started to form around the 1950s. For example, the foundations of Levent (named after the Levent Farm previously located there) were established in the 1950s when construction began on a prestigious suburban mass housing project. The Etiler, Konaklar, Akatlar, Nisbetiye, Levazım and Kültür neighborhoods followed soon after.

In 2016 and 2017, there were two terror attacks in the district. One was outside a stadium and the other was at a nightclub. The site of the 216 attack has been commemorated as the 10 December Martyrs Park.

== Climate ==
Beşiktaş experiences a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa/Cf&quot;) according to both Köppen and Trewartha climate classifications, with cool winters and warm to hot summers. As its location in the middle of coastal Istanbul suggests, it has a transitional climate between the oceanic climate to the north, and the Mediterranean climate to the south, and is a good average of climates across Istanbul. It is classified as USDA hardiness zone 9a, and AHS heat zone 3.

== Government ==
Beşiktaş is located on the European side of Istanbul Province. It became an independent district in 1930 after its separation from Beyoğlu, and the municipal government was founded in 1984. The district is composed of 23 neighbourhoods:

== Economy ==
With the Ottoman dynasty&#x27;s settlement in Dolmabahçe in the 17th century and many workers eventually settling in houses and mansions in Beşiktaş, many shopping places like Çarşı popped up, helping the area to be a developing economic center. But with the proclamation of the Republic of Turkey, and the capital being moved to Ankara, Beşiktaş&#x27;s economic development came to a halt.

In the 1950s with the birth of the Levent and Etiler neighborhoods, and the construction of Barbaros Boulevard. The district started growing back and eventually transportation levels in the neighborhoods rose, and with the construction of the Bosphorus Bridge in 1973, many businesses centers and shopping malls got constructed and the district became a business district and tourism, with many skyscrapers and hotels like the Sabancı Center and Isbank Towers eventually getting built.

<text>Thomas Merke (or Merks; died 1409) was an English priest and Bishop of Carlisle from 1397 to 1400.

Educated at Oxford University, Merke became a Benedictine monk at Westminster Abbey and was consecrated as Bishop of Carlisle about 23 April 1397. He served Richard II as an ambassador to various German princes, was one of the commissioners who negotiated the dowry of Isabella of Valois in 1398 and accompanied the king as his advisor and military chaplain during the suppression of Irish rebels in 1399.

Merke supported Richard against the usurper Henry IV and in 1400 was imprisoned in the Tower of London and deprived of his bishopric as a result. Although released and conditionally pardoned the following year, he was replaced as Bishop by a supporter of Henry&#x27;s. Merke resumed his duties as an auxiliary Bishop and went on to serve as acting Bishop of the Diocese of Winchester several times. He was among the Catholic bishops who sided against Pope Gregory XII at Lucca in 1408, during the Great Schism of the West. He died in 1409. 

Merke&#x27;s role in supporting the king is represented in Samuel Daniel&#x27;s poem &quot;The Civil Wars Between the Houses of Lancaster and York&quot; and in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Richard II&quot;.

<doc id="914901" wikidata="Q583147" url="?curid=914901" title="Sard's theorem">
<text>In mathematics, Sard&#x27;s theorem, also known as Sard&#x27;s lemma or the Morse–Sard theorem, is a result in mathematical analysis that asserts that the set of critical values (that is, the image of the set of critical points) of a smooth function &quot;f&quot; from one Euclidean space or manifold to another is a null set, i.e., it has Lebesgue measure 0. This makes the set of critical values &quot;small&quot; in the sense of a generic property. The theorem is named for Anthony Morse and Arthur Sard.

== Statement ==
More explicitly, let

:formula_1

be formula_2, (that is, formula_3 times continuously differentiable), where formula_4. Let formula_5 denote the &quot;critical set&quot; of formula_6 which is the set of points formula_7 at which the Jacobian matrix of formula_8 has rank formula_9. Then the image formula_10 has Lebesgue measure 0 in formula_11.

Intuitively speaking, this means that although formula_12 may be large, its image must be small in the sense of Lebesgue measure: while formula_8 may have many critical &quot;points&quot; in the domain formula_14, it must have few critical &quot;values&quot; in the image formula_11.

More generally, the result also holds for mappings between differentiable manifolds formula_16 and formula_17 of dimensions formula_18 and formula_19, respectively. The critical set formula_12 of a formula_2 function 
:formula_22 
consists of those points at which the differential 
:formula_23 
has rank less than formula_18 as a linear transformation. If formula_25, then Sard&#x27;s theorem asserts that the image of formula_12 has measure zero as a subset of formula_16. This formulation of the result follows from the version for Euclidean spaces by taking a countable set of coordinate patches. The conclusion of the theorem is a local statement, since a countable union of sets of measure zero is a set of measure zero, and the property of a subset of a coordinate patch having zero measure is invariant under diffeomorphism.

== Variants ==
There are many variants of this lemma, which plays a basic role in singularity theory among other fields. The case formula_28 was proven by Anthony P. Morse in 1939, and the general case by Arthur Sard in 1942.

A version for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds was proven by Stephen Smale.

The statement is quite powerful, and the proof involves analysis. In topology it is often quoted — as in the Brouwer fixed-point theorem and some applications in Morse theory — in order to prove the weaker corollary that “a non-constant smooth map has at least one regular value”.

In 1965 Sard further generalized his theorem to state that if formula_22 is formula_2 for formula_4 and if formula_32 is the set of points formula_33 such that formula_34 has rank strictly less than formula_35, then the &quot;r&quot;-dimensional Hausdorff measure of formula_36 is zero. In particular the Hausdorff dimension of formula_36 is at most &quot;r&quot;. Caveat: The Hausdorff dimension of formula_36 can be arbitrarily close to &quot;r&quot;.

<doc id="914902" wikidata="Q4712821" url="?curid=914902" title="Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta">
<text>The Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta is a yearly hot air balloon festival that takes place in Albuquerque, New Mexico, during early October. The Balloon Fiesta is a nine-day event occurring in the first full week of October, and has over 500 hot air balloons each year, far from its beginnings of merely 13 balloons in 1972. The event is the largest balloon festival in the world, followed by the Grand Est Mondial Air in France, and the León International Balloon Festival in Mexico.

== History ==

The Balloon Fiesta began in 1972 as the highlight of a 50th birthday celebration for 770 KOB Radio. Radio station manager Dick McKee asked Sid Cutter, owner of Cutter Flying Service and the first person to own a hot air balloon in New Mexico, if KOB could use his new hot-air balloon as part of the festivities. The two began discussing ballooning, along with conversation and help from Oscar Kratz, and McKee asked what the largest gathering of hot air balloons to date had been (which had been 19 balloons in England). Kratz asked &quot;Can we get 19 here?&quot; Cutter agreed to try. He got commitments from 21 pilots, but bad weather kept some of them from arriving in time. The first fiesta ended up as a gathering of 13 balloons on April 8, 1972, sponsored by KOB. The first event was located in the parking lot of the Coronado Center Shopping Mall with 20,000 spectators and with balloonists from Arizona, California, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada and Texas taking part. McKee, Cutter, and Kratz are the three men who had originally started the balloon races. The first fiesta incorporated a &quot;Roadrunner-Coyote Balloon Race&quot; with 1 balloon being the &quot;Roadrunner&quot; and the others being &quot;Coyote&quot; balloons (the &quot;Roadrunner&quot; balloon was actually emblazoned with likenesses of both Warner Bros. characters). The winner of the race – the &quot;Coyote&quot; that landed closest to the Roadrunner – was Don Piccard, flying a balloon of his company&#x27;s design and construction (his wife also placed in the race). This race has continued as part of the Balloon Fiesta today.

The next year Albuquerque hosted the first World Hot-Air Balloon Championships in February and the fiesta became an international event. In 1975 Albuquerque was looking at hosting the World Championships again, but the event was scheduled for October. So the fiesta was moved to correspond with the championships. To maintain interest in Albuquerque&#x27;s bid to host the championships, a balloon rally was held in February of that year. Autumn being a far better flying time than February, the event has remained in early October to the present day.

The Balloon Fiesta grew each year for decades, and today is the largest balloon convention in the world. The number of registered balloons reached a peak of 1,019 in 2000, prompting the Balloon Fiesta Board to limit the number to 750 starting in 2001, citing a desire for &quot;quality over quantity&quot;. The limit was changed to 600 in 2009 – citing recent growth in the city and a loss of landing zones. On any given day during the festival, up to 100,000 spectators may be on the launch field where they are provided the rare opportunity to observe inflation and take off procedures. Countless more people gather at landing sites all over the city to watch incoming balloons. The limit was increased to 1,000 in 2011.

The Balloon Fiesta 49th Edition, like most public gatherings in 2020, was postponed for one year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It resumed the next year.

== Events ==

===Dawn Patrol===
The Dawn Patrol began at the Balloon Fiesta in 1978, when two California balloonists developed position lighting systems that allowed them to fly at night. Dawn Patrol pilots take off before sunrise and fly until it is light enough to see landing sites. Fellow balloonists appreciate the Dawn Patrol because they can watch the balloons and get an early idea of wind speeds and directions at different altitudes.

===Mass Ascensions===
One of the biggest events of the fiesta, where all participating balloons launch in two waves, filling the sky with hundreds of balloons at once. Launch directors, also known as &quot;zebras&quot; because of their black-and-white-striped outfits, serve as &quot;traffic cops,&quot; coordinating the launch so balloons leave the field in a safe and coordinated manner. The first wave of the mass ascension typically begins at around 7 am, around the time of Albuquerque&#x27;s sunrise in early October.

===Artistic Vision===
Many local artists take advantage of the balloons as favorite subject matter for their paintings. Balloons often land in Albuquerque neighborhoods. Many residents watch the balloons from the comfort of their backyards.

===Special Shape Rodeo===
Many non-traditional, uniquely shaped balloons are launched at the same time. Some of the most famous shapes include a milk cow, a wagon coach, twin bees, and many others like soda pop cans and animals. This is the most popular part of the event as families can see how balloons can be all different in shapes and sizes.

===Balloon Glows===
Large numbers of balloons are illuminated at night by their propane burners. They stand static and do not take off during these events. The &quot;Glowdeo&quot; is a night glow for the special shapes balloons. Evening Balloon glows are often followed by fireworks displays.

===Special Events and Competitions===
Various events like:

*The Fiesta Challenge, a game where balloonists attempt to drop a marker closest to a target.
*America&#x27;s Challenge Gas Balloon Race, where special long-distance gas balloons are inflated and then launched. The winner of the race is the balloon that travels the farthest. Some balloons in the race have gone as far as Canada and the U.S. East Coast.
*The Flight of the Nations Mass Ascension, where balloonists from each nation launch, one at a time, to their national anthem and waving their nation&#x27;s flag.
*Other piloting, skill, and speed competitions.
*Music Fiesta, the fiesta invites artists for concerts and shows.
*Rainbow Ryders, the official balloon rides that people can book and enjoy.

== Local impact ==
The convention has also become a major showcase of New Mexican culture and history and features numerous cultural exhibitions. The fiesta is one of Albuquerque&#x27;s largest tourist attractions and constitutes a major source of income for the city and local businesses. Albuquerque also has the most instate/resident balloonists at over 300 people. In 2015, the fiesta logged 955,703 visitors. Typically, tourists and fiesta visitors take thousands of pictures of the balloons, so it is no surprise that for several years the fiesta was sponsored by Kodak and was given the title, the &quot;Kodak Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta&quot;, though that title was usually only used in print ads and on official memorabilia. In 2018 the fiesta was presented by Canon, a Japanese camera and imaging company.

== Albuquerque box ==
The success of the Fiesta depends in part on the cool Albuquerque morning temperatures in October and the &quot;Albuquerque box&quot;. The &quot;box&quot; is a set of predictable wind patterns that can be exploited to navigate the balloons. At low elevations the winds tend to be northerly (from the north), but at higher elevations they tend to be southerly. Balloonists use these winds to navigate in a vertical box: they ascend slightly from the launch park, move south, ascend further, move north, descend, and repeat the box or land back in the launch park or quite nearby. During events involving on-field targets, such as the &quot;Key Grab&quot; (where pilots attempt to grab prizes, including a set of keys to a new vehicle, from atop tall, flexible poles), it&#x27;s not uncommon to see the same balloon make 5 or 6 passes at the targets, simply by working the &quot;Box&quot; to keep returning to the field.

== Location ==
Balloon Fiesta Park, from which the balloons are launched, is located on the northern edge of the city. The park is a multi-use field and is home to many other events throughout the year. In 2005, the Anderson-Abruzzo Albuquerque International Balloon Museum was opened on the grounds. The museum is dedicated to the history, science, sport, and art of ballooning and other innovative forms of flight.

== Organization ==

The Balloon Fiesta is organized by Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

== Trademark == 
Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta, Inc owns the trademark for the name &quot;Balloon Fiesta&quot;.

==Incidents==
===2004 radio tower collision===
On October 9, 2004, while landing, a Smokey Bear imaged balloon collided with, and became entangled in, one of KKOB&#x27;s radio transmitter towers. The three passengers were able to climb out of the basket onto the tower. However, the tower was energized and could have led to electrocution once the passengers set foot on ground, so KKOB shut down its transmitter following the accident in order to enable them to climb down to safety. This accident was recorded by several local television stations, and the footage has become a standard story on a number of televised reality programs which deal with &quot;caught on camera&quot; incidents.

===2024 radio tower collision and collapse===
On the morning of October 11, 2024, a balloon named &quot;Blue Moon&quot; from Tucson, Arizona, USA, collided with one of the guy wires of the KKOB tower, causing the tower to collapse. No one was injured in this incident, and the pilot subsequently made a safe landing.

<text>Risk compensation is a theory which suggests that people typically adjust their behavior in response to perceived levels of risk, becoming more careful where they sense greater risk and less careful if they feel more protected. Although usually small in comparison to the fundamental benefits of safety interventions, it may result in a lower net benefit than expected or even higher risks.

By way of example, it has been observed that motorists drove closer to the vehicle in front when the vehicles were fitted with anti-lock brakes. There is also evidence that the risk compensation phenomenon could explain the failure of condom distribution programs to reverse HIV prevalence and that condoms may foster disinhibition, with people engaging in risky sex both with and without condoms.

By contrast, shared space is an urban street design method which consciously aims to increase the level of perceived risk and uncertainty, thereby slowing traffic and reducing the number and seriousness of injuries.

==Overview==
Risk compensation is related to the broader term behavioral adaptation which includes all behavior changes in response to safety measures, whether compensatory or not. However, since researchers are primarily interested in the compensatory or negative adaptive behavior the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. The more recent version emerged from road safety research after it was claimed that many interventions failed to achieve the expected level of benefits but has since been investigated in many other fields.

===Peltzman effect===
The reduction of predicted benefit from regulations that intend to increase safety is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Peltzman effect&quot; in recognition of Sam Peltzman, a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, who published &quot;The Effects of Automobile Safety Regulation&quot; in the &quot;Journal of Political Economy&quot; in 1975 in which he controversially suggested that &quot;offsets (due to risk compensation) are virtually complete, so that regulation has not decreased highway deaths&quot;. Peltzman claimed to originate this theory in the 1970s but it was used to oppose the requirement of safety equipment on trains in the Nineteenth Century. 

A reanalysis of his original data found numerous errors and his model failed to predict fatality rates before regulation. According to Peltzman, regulation was at best useless, at worst counterproductive. Peltzman found that the level of risk compensation in response to highway safety regulations was &quot;complete&quot; in original study. But &quot;Peltzman&#x27;s theory does not predict the magnitude of risk compensatory behaviour.&quot; Substantial further empirical work has found that the effect exists in many contexts but generally offsets less than half of the direct effect. In the U.S., motor vehicle fatalities per population declined by more than half from the beginning of regulation in the 1960s through 2012. Vehicle safety standards accounted for most of the reduction augmented by seat belt use laws, changes in the minimum drinking age, and reductions in teen driving.

The Peltzman effect can also result in a redistributing effect where the consequences of risky behaviour are increasingly felt by innocent parties (see moral hazard). By way of example, if a risk-tolerant driver responds to driver-safety interventions, such as compulsory seat belts, crumple zones, antilock brakes, etc. by driving faster with less attention, then this can result in increases in injuries and deaths to pedestrians.

===Risk homeostasis===
Risk homeostasis is a controversial hypothesis, initially proposed in 1982 by Gerald J. S. Wilde, a professor at Queen&#x27;s University in Canada, which suggests that people maximise their benefit by comparing the expected costs and benefits of safer and riskier behaviour and which introduced the idea of the &quot;target level of risk&quot;. He proposed four constituents to a person&#x27;s calculations relating to risk:
* Expected benefits of risky behavior (e.g., gaining time by speeding, fighting boredom, increasing mobility)
* Expected costs of risky behavior (e.g., speeding tickets, car repairs, insurance surcharges)
* Expected benefits of safe behavior (e.g., insurance discounts for accident-free periods, enhancement of reputation of responsibility)
* Expected costs of safe behavior (e.g., using an uncomfortable seat belt, being called a coward by one&#x27;s peers, time loss)

Wilde noted that when Sweden changed from driving on the left to driving on the right in 1967, this was followed by a marked reduction in the traffic fatality rate for 18 months after which the trend returned to its previous values. He suggested that drivers had responded to increased perceived danger by taking more care, only to revert to previous habits as they became accustomed to the new regime. A similar pattern was seen following Iceland&#x27;s switch from left- to right-hand driving.

In a Munich study, part of a fleet of taxicabs were equipped with anti-lock brakes (ABS), while the remainder had conventional brake systems. In other respects, the two types of cars were identical. The crash rates, studied over three years, were a little higher for the cabs with ABS, Wilde concluded that drivers of ABS-equipped cabs took more risks, assuming that ABS would take care of them; non-ABS drivers were said to drive more carefully since they could not rely on ABS in a dangerous situation.

The idea of risk homeostasis is disputed. One author claimed that it received &quot;little support&quot;, another suggested that it &quot;commands about as much credence as the flat earth hypothesis&quot;, a third noted that the proposal did create considerable media attention: &quot;What set the debate alight, rather like petrol on flames, was the proposition in 1982 that road users did not just adapt to perceptions of changing risk through compensatory behaviors, but that the process was a homeostatic one, producing overall equilibrium in safety-related outcomes&quot;. Others claimed that road fatality statistics, which have fallen considerably since the introduction of safety measures, do not support the theory.

=== Preventive measures ===
To create preventive measures in order to make a certain activity safer, risk compensation and risk compensation behavior has to be mapped in order to evaluate whether the measures are effective. When measures create risk compensation this might nullify the made measures. Then the measures might not lead to less injuries or in worse cases enhance injuries.
==Examples==

===Road transport===

====Anti-lock brakes====
Anti-lock braking systems are designed to increase vehicle safety by allowing the vehicle to steer while braking.

A number of studies show that drivers of vehicles with ABS tend to drive faster, follow closer and brake later, accounting for the failure of ABS to result in any measurable improvement in road safety. The studies were performed in Canada, Denmark, and Germany. A study led by Clifford Winston and Fred Mannering, a professor of civil engineering at the University of South Florida supports risk compensation, terming it the &quot;offset hypothesis&quot;. A study of crashes involving taxicabs in Munich of which half had been equipped with anti-lock brakes noted that crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and concluded this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks.

However, the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety released a study in 2010 that found motorcycles with ABS were 37 percent less likely to be involved in a fatal crash than models without ABS. A 2004 study found that ABS reduced the risk of multiple vehicle crashes by 18 percent, but had increased the risk of run-off-road crashes by 35 percent.

====Seat belts====
A 1994 research study of people who both wore and habitually did not wear seatbelts concluded that drivers were found to drive faster and less carefully when belted.

Several important driving behaviors were observed on the road before and after the belt use law was enforced in Newfoundland, and in Nova Scotia during the same period without a law. Belt use increased from 16 percent to 77 percent in Newfoundland and remained virtually unchanged in Nova Scotia. Four driver behaviors (speed, stopping at intersections when the control light was amber, turning left in front of oncoming traffic, and gaps in following distance) were measured at various sites before and after the law. Changes in these behaviors in Newfoundland were similar to those in Nova Scotia, except that drivers in Newfoundland drove slower on expressways after the law, contrary to the risk compensation theory.

In Britain in 1981 at a time when the government was considering the introduction of seat belt legislation, John Adams of University College London, suggested that there was no convincing evidence of a correlation between the seat-belt legislation and reduction of injuries and fatalities based on a comparison between states with and without seat belt laws. He also suggested that some injuries were displaced from car drivers to pedestrians and other road users. The &quot;Isles Report&quot; echoed these concerns. Adams subsequently argued that the reduction in fatalities that followed the introduction of legislation could not be attributed with confidence to seat-belt use due to the simultaneous introduction of breath testing for driving under the influence of alcohol.

However, a 2007 study based on data from the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration concluded that between 1985 and 2002 there were &quot;significant reductions in fatality rates for occupants and motorcyclists after the implementation of belt use laws&quot;, and that &quot;seatbelt use rate is significantly related to lower fatality rates for the total, pedestrian, and all non-occupant models even when controlling for the presence of other state traffic safety policies and a variety of demographic factors&quot;. A comprehensive 2003 US study also did &quot;not find any evidence that higher seat belt usage has a significant effect on driving behavior.&quot; Their results showed that &quot;overall, mandatory seat belt laws unambiguously reduce traffic fatalities.&quot;

====Swedish change to driving on the right====
In Sweden, following the change from driving on the left to driving on the right in 1967 there was a drop in crashes and fatalities, which was linked to the increased apparent risk. The number of motor insurance claims went down by 40 percent, returning to normal over the next six weeks. Fatality levels took two years to return to normal.

====Speed limits====
The control of traffic speeds using effectively enforced speed limits and other traffic calming methods plays an important role in the reduction of road traffic casualties; speed limit changes alone without accompanying enforcement or traffic calming measures will not.

A 1994 study conducted to test the risk homeostasis theory, using a driving simulator, found that increasing posted speed limits and a reduction of speeding fines had significantly increased driving speed but resulted in no change in the accident frequency. It also showed that increased accident cost caused large and significant reductions in accident frequency but no change in speed choice. The results suggest that regulation of specific risky behaviors such as speed choice may have little influence on accident rates.

====Shared space====

Shared space is an approach to the design of roads, where risk compensation is consciously used to &quot;increase&quot; the level of uncertainty for drivers and other road users by removing traditional demarcations between vehicle traffic by removing curbs, road surface markings, and traffic signs. The approach has been found to result in lower vehicle speeds and fewer road casualties.

====Bicycle helmets====
Campaigns and legislation to encourage the wearing of cycle helmets have not been shown to reduce significant head injuries, and &quot;there is evidence to suggest that some cyclists ride less cautiously when helmeted because they feel more protected&quot;. In one experimental study, adults accustomed to wearing helmets cycled more slowly without a helmet, but no difference in helmeted and unhelmeted cycling speed was found for cyclists who do not usually wear helmets. A Spanish study of traffic accidents between 1990 and 1999 found no strong evidence of risk compensation in helmet wearers but concluded that &quot;this possibility cannot be ruled out&quot;.

Motorists may also alter their behavior toward helmeted cyclists. One study by Walker in England found that 2,500 vehicles passed a helmeted cyclist with measurably less clearance (8.5 cm) than that given to the same cyclist unhelmeted (out of an average total passing distance of 1.2 to 1.3 metres). The significance of these differences has been re-analysed by Olivier, who argued that the effect on safety was not significant since the passing distances were over 1 metre, and again by Walker, who disagreed with Olivier&#x27;s conclusion.

In 1988, Rodgers re-analysed data which supposedly showed helmets to be effective and found both data errors and methodological weaknesses. He concluded that in fact the data showed &quot;bicycle-related fatalities are positively and significantly associated with increased helmet use&quot; and mentioned risk compensation as one possible explanation of this association.

===Infrastructure===
Levees are structures which run parallel to rivers and are meant to offer protection from flooding. The perception of safety can lead to unsafe land development in the floodplain which is supposed to be protected by the levee. Consequently, when a flood does occur or the levee breaches, the effects of that disaster will be greater than if the levee had not been built.

===Sport===

====Martial arts====

This principle is recognised in some martial arts, including karate, where it is suggested that wearing protective gloves might lead to harder strikes and punches, possibly resulting in more severe injuries. It has also been suggested in historical European martial arts.

====Ski helmets====
Recent studies indicate that skiers wearing helmets go faster on average than non-helmeted skiers, and that overall risk index is higher in helmeted skiers than non-helmeted skiers. Moreover, while helmets may help prevent minor head injuries, increased usage of helmets has not reduced the overall fatality rate.

Other recent studies have concluded that helmet use is not associated with riskier behavior among skiers and snowboarders, and that helmet usage reduces the risk and severity of head injuries.

====Football helmets====
Some researchers have found the counterintuitive result that wearing helmets in gridiron football actually increases the chance of injury, and thus they recommend players occasionally practice without helmets. When hard shells were first introduced, the number of head injuries increased because players had a false sense of security and made more dangerous tackles.

====Skydiving====
&#x27;Booth&#x27;s rule #2&#x27;, often attributed to skydiving pioneer Bill Booth, states, &quot;the safer skydiving gear becomes, the more chances skydivers will take, in order to keep the fatality rate constant&quot;. Even though skydiving equipment has made huge leaps forward in terms of reliability, including the introduction of safety devices such as AADs, the fatality rate has stayed roughly constant when adjusted for the increasing number of participants. This can largely be attributed to an increase in the popularity of high performance canopies, which fly much faster than traditional parachutes. A greater number of landing fatalities in recent years has been attributed to high speed maneuvers close to the ground.

===Safety equipment in children===
Experimental studies have suggested that children who wear protective equipment are likely to take more risks.

===Health===

====Risky sexual behavior and HIV/AIDS====
Evidence on risk compensation associated with HIV prevention interventions is mixed. Harvard researcher Edward C. Green argued that the risk compensation phenomenon could explain the failure of condom distribution programs to reverse HIV prevalence, providing a detailed explanations of his views in an op-ed article for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; and an extended interview with the BBC. A 2007 article in the &quot;Lancet&quot; suggested that &quot;condoms seem to foster disinhibition, in which people engage in risky sex either with condoms or with the intention of using condoms&quot;. Another report compared risk behaviour of men based on whether they were circumcised.
A 2015 study showed that adolescents with safe-sex beliefs (adolescents who believe that sex with condoms is 100% safe) have an earlier sexual initiation.

==== PrEP ====
While pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with anti-HIV drugs appears to be extremely successful in suppressing the spread of HIV infection, there is some evidence that the reduction in HIV risk has led to some people taking more sexual risks; specifically, reduced use of condoms in anal sex, raising risks of spreading sexually transmitted diseases other than HIV.

<doc id="914909" wikidata="Q263886" url="?curid=914909" title="Natalie Cook">
<text>Natalie Louise Cook (born 19 January 1975) is an Australian professional beach volleyball player and Olympic gold medallist. She became the first Australian woman to compete at five Olympic Games.

==Early life==
Cook was born in Townsville, Queensland. She was the dux of her school, Corinda State High (located in the western suburbs of Brisbane). She enrolled in pre-medicine college courses, and also took up volleyball, captaining the Australian Indoor Junior Team in 1992. In 1993 she began playing beach volleyball. In 1994 she went professional and gave up her pursuit of a medical degree. 

==Career==

Cook partnered with Kerri Pottharst to represent Australia at the Atlanta Olympics in 1996, winning a bronze medal—the first time that beach volleyball had been an Olympic sport. In the same year, the pair won a silver medal at the world championships, and came first in the World Tour Event in Japan.

Cook and Pottharst did not play together again until 2000. They finished third in the World Tour Events, held in France and Portugal, and then participated in the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. They dominated the competition, winning the gold medal. In the aftermath of their Olympic win, the pair were awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia. Cook and Pottharst were included in the Fédération Internationale de Volleyball&#x27;s Team of the Decade.
After the Olympics, Pottharst retired, and Cook found a new partner in Nicole Sanderson. They won a bronze medal at the 2003 Beach Volleyball World Championships in Rio de Janeiro, and by the end of the 2003 world tour, were ranked fourth in the world. They were subsequently selected to represent Australia at the 2004 Athens Olympics. After a promising start, they finished out of medal contention, losing to teams from Brazil and the United States. For the 2008 Summer Olympics, Cook partnered with Tamsin Barnett, finishing fifth overall.
On 1 August 2012, Cook&#x27;s record breaking beach volleyball career came to an end with her elimination from her fifth games in London.

==Recognition==
In January 2001, Cook was awarded the Australian Sports Medal.

Cook was also awarded the Medal of the Order of Australia in the 2001 Australia Day Honours in recognition of her service to sport as a gold medallist at the Sydney 2000 Olympic Games.

In 2024, Cook was named as a Queensland Great.

==Personal life==
Cook currently resides in Brisbane and is married to fellow beach volleyballer Sarah Maxwell. In addition to her sporting career, Cook tours on the public speaking circuit as a leading motivational speaker attracting big audiences and launched her own beach volleyball-related business, &quot;Sandstorm&quot; at the QEII Stadium in Brisbane.

<doc id="914913" wikidata="Q216614" url="?curid=914913" title="Alan Smith (footballer, born 1980)">
<text>Alan Smith (born 28 October 1980) is an English football coach and former professional footballer. Smith first came to prominence as both a striker and a right winger, however later became a holding midfielder.

Smith began his career with hometown club Leeds United and became a mainstay in their Premier League teams between 1998 and 2004. Initially playing as a striker during his Elland Road days he scored 38 goals in 172 games. In 2004 following the clubs relegation he joined rivals Manchester United however, after moving to the club he broke his leg and dislocated his ankle in a match against Liverpool, whereupon manager Sir Alex Ferguson converted him to a holding midfielder, a role in which he continued after his transfer to Newcastle United. He later moved to Milton Keynes Dons for several seasons before signing for Notts County. He had a short spell as caretaker manager of County in 2017, but later reverted to the role of player-coach after the appointment of Kevin Nolan as manager.

He has also represented the England national team, winning 19 caps. Smith was known for his aggressive mentality on the pitch and his high-pressing style of football and earned a reputation as a hard-tackling player and is noted for his high work rate.

==Early life==
Smith was born and brought up in Rothwell, West Yorkshire, where he attended Rodillian School. In 1995, he attended the Football Association School of Excellence along with fifteen other students at Lilleshall Hall in Shropshire, where he was one of the subjects of a 1999 ITV documentary &quot;The World At Their Feet&quot;, which followed the futures of the academy&#x27;s 1995 intake. During his time at Lilleshall, Smith attended Idsall School in Shifnal.

==Club career==

===Leeds United===
Smith started his career with Leeds and scored in his first-team debut against Liverpool, aged 18. He went on to become an undisputed first-choice, as the side consolidated on domestic and European fronts, reaching the semi-finals of the 2000–01 Champions League. Smith was part of an offensive line that included Michael Bridges and Australian Mark Viduka.

His senior FA Premier League debut was as a substitute for Leeds United against Liverpool at Anfield, where he displayed his natural scoring ability by scoring with his first shot of the game, three minutes after coming off the bench. That goal helped propel him into the 1998–99 English football season, as he was one-half of manager David O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s first-choice striker pairing, along with Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink.

Smith continued his run in the Leeds side, as the club began to grow in stature. He showed his class in 2001 while helping to lead the Leeds side through the Champions League, though his experience ended on a sour note as he was sent off in the semi-final. The following season saw Smith switched to the right of midfield, his versatility being utilised by O&#x27;Leary, as the Leeds United manager tried to accommodate new signings. 2001 also saw Smith&#x27;s break into the England national football team squad. An England youth international at multiple levels, Smith made his senior England debut in May 2001. He did not make the final cut for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and accepted a position with the England Under-21 side. He scored four goals in a UEFA Cup tie at Hapoel Tel Aviv in November 2002. He signed a new three-and-a-half-year contract with Leeds in February 2003.

A hometown hero for supporters of Leeds United, Smith won the &quot;Supporter&#x27;s Player of the Year&quot; award two years running between 2003 and 2004—a first in the club&#x27;s history. Though his goal tally was not excellent by any means, his willingness to play any role on the pitch and his tireless efforts to save &quot;The Whites&quot; from relegation was greatly appreciated by the Leeds fans.

Leeds&#x27; relegation in May 2004 saw Smith kissing the badge on his shirt and crying at what would be his last match for the club. His transfer to bitter rivals Manchester United, however, led to controversy. His exit was marred by accusations of treachery, and in the space of a day he went from hero to villain in the eyes of some Leeds fans; this was despite the fact that club had publicly stated that they could not afford to pay his wages, that they were open to offers for him, and that no other club had registered an interest. Due to the financial difficulties at Leeds, Smith chose to waive the personal transfer fee owed to him by the club. This did not stop some Leeds fans from feeling betrayed, and they held up banners in subsequent games that compared Smith to Judas.

It has since been revealed by Peter Lorimer that the only club Leeds would allow Smith to join was Manchester United, and that Leeds had in fact engineered the move. With Manchester United being the only club offering the requested money up-front, instead of on an instalment basis (as offered by Everton and Newcastle United), and with Leeds facing administration, Smith faced allowing Leeds to go into administration or joining Leeds&#x27; bitter rivals. However, Smith had earlier gone on record saying he would never play for Manchester United.

===Manchester United===

As Leeds were relegated at the end of the 2003–04 season, Smith joined Manchester United for £7 million. The second chapter of his career began on 8 August 2004, in the Community Shield clash against Arsenal, scoring for the club with a swerving volley in the 55th minute, as United lost 3–1. He scored his first league goal against Norwich City, scoring the winning goal with a &quot;stunning volley&quot; in the 49th minute, having earlier setting up a goal for David Bellion.

An injury hampered his first season, causing him to miss out on important matches such as the League Cup semi-final against Chelsea and the 2005 FA Cup final against Arsenal at the Millennium Stadium, which Manchester United lost on penalties. The forward scored 10 goals overall in his first season, but, with Wayne Rooney in good form and Ruud van Nistelrooy back in the team after injury, was relegated to the bench.

In the summer of 2005, it emerged that Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson was grooming Smith as a successor to Roy Keane in the Manchester United midfield. Ferguson stated: &quot;Roy sees characteristics in Alan that he saw in himself as a young player, which could help Alan develop into a very good player in that position.&quot; Smith got his chance to prove his credentials as a replacement for Keane when the Manchester United captain was injured early in the 2005–06 season. Smith began a prolonged run in the midfield &#x27;anchor&#x27; role, with little effectiveness. The criticism aimed at Smith and his teammates reached its peak with United&#x27;s 4–1 defeat away to Middlesbrough and the subsequent 1–0 defeat to Lille in the Champions League. Smith was believed to be one of several Manchester United stars who were heavily criticised by Keane, in an MUTV interview that was thought too explosive to be aired and consigned to the cutting room floor by club officials. It seemed that Smith&#x27;s performance in the crucial home match against league leaders Chelsea would be meticulously scrutinised in the light of Keane&#x27;s damning words. Smith responded in determined fashion, his performance in the 1–0 win resulting in &quot;The Guardian&quot; naming him as the man of the match.

He scored only one goal in 33 appearances in 2005–06, in a 3–1 away win over Charlton Athletic. On 18 February 2006, during a 1–0 defeat by Liverpool at Anfield in the FA Cup, Smith broke his leg and dislocated his ankle while attempting to block a free kick from Liverpool&#x27;s John Arne Riise, an injury described by Ferguson as &quot;one of the worst I&#x27;ve seen&quot;. Reports at the time claimed Liverpool fans attacked Smith&#x27;s ambulance as it left Anfield, but Smith has since refuted these claims. He had an operation the next day, after which it was estimated that he would be out of the game for around nine months. A week later, Manchester United beat Wigan Athletic 4–0 in the League Cup final. After the match, Manchester United&#x27;s players paid tribute to Smith by collecting the trophy in T-shirts printed with the words &quot;For you Smudge&quot; (Smith&#x27;s nickname).

Ahead of the 2006–07 season, Ferguson sold Van Nistelrooy to Real Madrid and said he intended to replace him by returning Smith to his natural centre-forward position: &quot;We are going to convert Alan Smith back into being a forward. He will be back in training soon and should be available by the end of August or the beginning of September.&quot; After three appearances for the reserves in August 2006, Smith returned to the Manchester United first team in September 2006, first as an unused substitute in the 3–2 home win over Celtic in the Champions League on 13 September, before taking the field for the last five minutes of the 1–0 away win over Benfica two weeks later.

Smith made his first start for eight months in Manchester United&#x27;s 2–1 away win over Crewe Alexandra in the fourth round of the League Cup. However, he was still not fully match-fit and made only one substitute appearance in the next four months. As he continued his training, both Cardiff City and former club Leeds United expressed an interest in signing Smith on loan, but he said he intended to fight for his place in the Manchester United team.

Smith returned to action again in the second leg of the Champions League round of 16 tie against Lille on 7 March 2007, coming on for goalscorer Henrik Larsson in the 75th minute of the 1–0 win. He made his first start at Old Trafford since his injury on 14 March in a friendly against a Europe XI to commemorate 50 years since the signing of the Treaty of Rome. His first competitive start at Old Trafford, however, came on 19 March 2007 in an FA Cup quarter-final replay win over Middlesbrough.

After a succession of games in which he was either a substitute or substituted himself, Smith played the full 90 minutes of Manchester United&#x27;s Champions League quarter-final second leg at home to Roma on 10 April 2007 as Manchester United won 7–1; he scored Manchester United&#x27;s second goal in the 17th minute, his first goal since November 2005. He was then named in the starting line-up against Manchester City on 5 May 2007; United won the game 1–0 and were crowned league champions a day later, when Chelsea were held to a 1–1 draw at the Emirates Stadium against Arsenal.

Despite falling one game short of the 10 appearances needed to qualify for a Premier League winner&#x27;s medal, the league granted special dispensation for Smith to receive a medal on the last day of the season. He made his last competitive appearance for Manchester United a week later in the 2007 FA Cup final against Chelsea, the first final played at the new Wembley Stadium, coming on for Darren Fletcher in the second minute of extra time.

===Newcastle United===
Smith appeared in all four games of Manchester United&#x27;s pre-season tour of the Far East, but on 2 August 2007, Newcastle United confirmed they had reached an agreement to sign Smith for around £6 million. The deal was confirmed on 3 August, with Smith moving to Newcastle on a five-year contract. He scored the winning goal on his debut for the Magpies, in a 1–0 friendly victory against Sampdoria. However, the striker struggled to establish himself at Newcastle in his first season, failing to score a league goal.

His progress the following season was hampered by stress fracture of the ankle sustained in the pre-season, meaning it took until February 2009 before he played in a competitive fixture by coming on as a substitute against Everton. Despite the comeback, Smith was relegated for the second time in his career as Newcastle lost by a single goal to Aston Villa. Again, he finished the season without a goal.

In the summer of 2009, Smith played against his former club Leeds United in a pre season friendly at St James Park, the match was the first time he had played against Leeds since leaving the club for bitter rivals Manchester United, his every touch was booed throughout the game by Leeds fans and he was heavily booed when he was substituted. Smith was made vice-captain for the 2009–10 season, but captained the team in almost every game due to Chris Hughton&#x27;s preference of Smith to first choice captain Nicky Butt. Smith has been a regular feature, but in a much deeper role acting as a central defensive midfielder.

Despite playing regularly as a deep lying midfielder, he lost his place after the January transfer window with the arrival of Wayne Routledge and Danny Guthrie&#x27;s excellent form in central midfield. To allow two strikers up front in the form of Peter Løvenkrands and Andy Carroll for more games, Smith was dropped to accommodate. Newcastle won promotion to the Premier League.

Smith started Newcastle&#x27;s first four Premier League games due to the injury of Danny Guthrie, Smith partnered Joey Barton for the 3–0 loss to former club Manchester United, the 6–0 victory over Aston Villa, the 1–1 draw with Wolverhampton Wanderers and the 2–0 loss to Blackpool. He lost his place to new signing Cheick Tioté and the arrival of Hatem Ben Arfa. Smith was given time in the Football League Cup, where Chris Hughton gave young players and fringe players such as himself, Ryan Taylor and Peter Løvenkrands a chance.

With Tioté cementing his place as the in-form defensive midfielder, Smith served a lot of bench duty, although he saw a return to action in Newcastle&#x27;s 3–1 cup defeat to Stevenage on 8 January 2011. With Tioté suspended for three games following his sending-off in the same game, Smith started in Newcastle&#x27;s 1–1 derby draw with Sunderland, but came off after half an hour with an injured ankle, which was later confirmed to rule him out for the rest of the season.

After returning to full training in April 2011, it was reported by assistant manager John Carver that Smith would be in contention to start Newcastle&#x27;s penultimate fixture to Chelsea with the club likely to rest Cheick Tioté to save him from a three-match ban.

On 7 June 2011, Smith was notified by the Newcastle management that his services would no longer be required, and he was free to leave the club.

On 8 June 2011, Leeds United chairman Ken Bates revealed that he was not ruling out a move to acquire Smith subject to his wage demands and fitness. After being made available for transfer, Smith was linked with a move to his former club Leeds United with Leeds manager Simon Grayson confirming his interest in the player.

Smith was released by Newcastle United on 1 June 2012.

===Milton Keynes Dons===
On 29 January 2012, Smith joined Milton Keynes Dons on loan until the end of the season. His first appearance was as a 50th-minute substitute for Adam Chicksen on 31 January 2012 in a League One game against Sheffield Wednesday. The game ended as a 1–1 draw. He made his first start for the club on 4 February 2012, playing 66 minutes of the 1–1 draw against Huddersfield Town, before being replaced by Jabo Ibehre. On 23 February 2012, Smith completed his first full 90 minutes for the Dons in the 2–1 win against Bury. The winning goal of the game came as a result of a penalty which Smith won just before half-time, after he was fouled by Bury goalkeeper Cameron Belford before Dean Bowditch duly converted the spot-kick. On 21 April, he scored his first goal in five years, in a 1–0 win against Sheffield United. On 15 May 2012 he came on as a substitute for MK Dons in the League One play-off semi-final against Huddersfield Town scoring with a diving header in injury time.

On 31 May 2012, it was reported that MK Dons manager Karl Robinson had opened talks with Smith&#x27;s representatives over a permanent move to the club. Smith made 18 appearances after joining the club from Newcastle United in late January, scoring two goals in the process. The move was completed on 10 July, with Smith signing a two-year contract. Smith has taken control of MK Dons XI sides in the Berks &amp; Bucks Cup, alongside former coach Ian Wright, as well as featuring in the unfamiliar position of centre back for a game. On 16 May 2014 Smith was released from the club along with three other players.

===Notts County===
Smith signed for Notts County on a one-year contract in 2014 as a player-coach. He signed a new one-year deal in May 2015. He had a short spell as caretaker manager of Notts County in 2017, but later reverted to the role of player-coach after the appointment of Kevin Nolan as manager.

He was released by Notts County at the end of the 2017–18 season.

==International career==
An England youth international at multiple levels, Smith was called into the England squad for the friendly against Italy in November 2000, but later withdrew in order to rest. He eventually earned his first cap in May 2001 in a friendly against Mexico, but did not make the final cut for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, and continued representing the under-21s. Smith scored on his full debut against Portugal in September 2002, being set up by Leeds teammate Lee Bowyer. In a Euro 2004 qualifier against Macedonia in October 2002, he received his first international red card from a second yellow card after a tackle on Aleksandar Vasoski.

In August 2005, Smith drew some criticism after withdrawing from the England squad to play Denmark (a game England lost 4–1) in order to play for the Manchester United reserves. After a prolonged absence from international football, Smith was called up for an England B match on 26 May 2007, against Albania. He scored the first goal of the game which ended in a 3–1 win. The next day he was named in the senior team to face Brazil, on 1 June 2007.

== Post-playing career ==
As of December 2020, Smith lives in the Orlando, Florida area working with male and female youngsters as a coach at the XL Soccer World Academy.

In South Korea, one&#x27;s &quot;Leeds days&quot; (, &quot;Lijeu sijeol&quot;) is a common way to refer to one&#x27;s prime or heyday; originally in reference to the relative decline in Smith&#x27;s fortunes after his transfer to a Manchester United team which also featured Korean Park Ji-sung.

<text>Union Pacific Corporation is a publicly traded railroad holding company. It is incorporated in Utah and is headquartered in Omaha, Nebraska. Its only operating subsidiary is Union Pacific Railroad. Along with BNSF Railway, owned by Berkshire Hathaway, the companies have a near-duopoly on freight railroad transportation west of the Mississippi River.

The corporate entity currently called Union Pacific Corporation was incorporated in 1969 as a holding company.

Notable companies acquired by Union Pacific and merged into Union Pacific Railroad include Missouri Pacific Railroad which included the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad, the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company, the Western Pacific Railroad, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, the St. Louis Southwestern Railway, the SPCSL Corporation, and the Southern Pacific Transportation Company. 

==History==
On July 1, 1862, after the passage of the Pacific Railway Acts, an entity called Union Pacific Railroad was incorporated. The act was approved by President Abraham Lincoln, and it provided for the construction of railroads from the Missouri River to the Pacific as a war measure for the preservation of the Union. The railroad was constructed westward from Council Bluffs, Iowa to meet the Central Pacific Railroad line, which was constructed eastward from San Francisco Bay. The railroads were united with the &quot;Golden spike&quot; in May 1869. The combined Union Pacific-Central Pacific line became known as the First transcontinental railroad and the train route that operated on it was called the Overland Route.

Union Pacific was entangled in the Crédit Mobilier scandal, a fraud involving the company, which hurriedly constructed the railroad, and Crédit Mobilier of America, which was formed to finance the construction, from 1864 to 1867 and exposed in 1872. The company was significantly overbilled, with executives and financiers, led by Thomas C. Durant, Oakes Ames, and Oliver Ames, embezzling large sums of money. The company faced financial difficulty during the Panic of 1873.

In the 1870s, under the ownership of Jay Gould, the company expanded its rail network noticeably. On January 24, 1880, Union Pacific Railroad was consolidated with Kansas Pacific Railway and Denver Pacific Railway under a new holding company called Union Pacific Railway. Jay Gould controlled all three railroads but, after leveraging the company and paying large dividends, Gould sold a large stake that year.

The Union Pacific Railway declared bankruptcy during the Panic of 1893, in part due to losses from the fraud and new competition, and went into government receivership. In 1898, under a bankruptcy plan sponsored by Kuhn, Loeb &amp; Co., it emerged from the receivership under a new similarly named entity controlled by E. H. Harriman.

In 1901, the company acquired a 46% interest in Southern Pacific Railroad; however, the government forced the company to sell the stake in 1913 due to antitrust concerns.

The current holding company, Union Pacific Corporation, was established in 1969 with its incorporation in Utah as a holding company for the railroad and other subsidiaries.

In 1982, Union Pacific Corporation acquired Missouri Pacific Railroad, which included the Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad, and the Western Pacific Railroad. The Missouri Pacific Railroad continued operations until January 1, 1997 when it was legally merged into Union Pacific Railroad.

In 1986, the company acquired Overnite Transportation Company (now TForce Freight) for $1.2 billion. At the time, it was the fifth largest trucking company in the United States and represented the expansion of Union Pacific east of the Mississippi River. It also created the first transcontinental transportation system in the United States. However, the companies did not integrate well, exacerbated by issues with labor unions. In 2001, the division acquired Motor Cargo Industries for $580 million. In 2003, Union Pacific completed a corporate spin-off and initial public offering of Overnite. In 2005, the company was acquired by United Parcel Service for $1.3 billion.

Union Pacific completed the corporate spin-off of Union Pacific Resources, its hydrocarbon exploration subsidiary, in 1996. Anadarko Petroleum acquired Union Pacific Resources in 2000 for $4.4 billion in stock.

In June 1995, the company acquired the 70% of Chicago and North Western Transportation Company that it did not already own for $1.1 billion.

In 1996, Union Pacific Corporation acquired the Southern Pacific Rail Corporation, which included the Southern Pacific Transportation Company, the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad, the St. Louis Southwestern Railway and the SPCSL Corporation, for $5.4 billion. It was led by Philip Anschutz.

In 1997, the company sold 220 miles of track in northern Wisconsin and Michigan to Wisconsin Central Ltd. for $85 million.

In 2000, due to a slowdown in business activity during the early 2000s recession, the company cut 2,000 jobs.

In 2005, James R. Young was named CEO of the company.

In 2015, Union Pacific Corporation legally merged the Southern Pacific Rail Corporation into Union Pacific Railway.

===Headquarters history===
Union Pacific was headquartered in New York City at the time of the company&#x27;s re-founding in 1969. In 1998, CEO Drew Lewis relocated the corporate headquarters to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. In 1997, the headquarters was shifted to Dallas, Texas. In 2004, the corporate headquarters was relocated to Omaha to join the Union Pacific Railroad headquarters.

<text>Essex was an American whaling ship from Nantucket, Massachusetts, which was launched in 1799. On November 20, 1820, while at sea in the southern Pacific Ocean under the command of Captain George Pollard Jr., the ship was attacked and sunk by a sperm whale. About from the coast of South America, the 20-man crew was forced to make for land in three whaleboats with what food and water they could salvage from the wreck.

After a month at sea the crew landed on the uninhabited Henderson Island. Three men elected to stay on the island, from which they were rescued in April 1821, while the remaining seventeen set off again for the coast of South America. The men suffered severe dehydration, starvation and exposure on the open ocean, and the survivors eventually resorted to cannibalism. By the time they were rescued in February 1821, three months after the sinking of &quot;Essex&quot;, only five of the seventeen were alive.

First mate Owen Chase and cabin boy Thomas Nickerson later wrote accounts of the ordeal. The tragedy attracted international attention, and inspired Herman Melville to write his 1851 novel, &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;.

==Ship and crew==
When &quot;Essex&quot; departed from Nantucket, Massachusetts, on her fateful voyage in August 1819, she was considered to be a lucky vessel, as her previous six whaling expeditions had brought in good profits. She was twenty years old and had been refitted during the summer. At only in length, and measuring about 239 tons burthen, &quot;Essex&quot; was small for a whaling ship. She was equipped with five whaleboats, each about in length.

&quot;Essex&quot; set sail with a crew of twenty-one men. Twelve, including the officers and two of the three boatsteerers, were born or raised in Nantucket while nine were off-islanders. The captain, 29-year-old George Pollard Jr., had sailed as second mate of &quot;Essex&quot; in 1815-1816, and as first mate in 1817-1819. The first mate, 21-year-old Owen Chase, had sailed on &quot;Essex&quot; in 1817-1819. The second mate was 26-year-old Matthew Joy. The three boatsteerers were Obed Hendricks and Benjamin Lawrence, both 20 years old and from Nantucket, and Englishman Thomas Chappel. At age 14, cabin boy Thomas Nickerson was the youngest member of the crew, while at least five more were under the age of 20.

==Final voyage==
===Round Cape Horn===
&quot;Essex&quot; departed from Nantucket on August 12, 1819, on what was expected to be a roughly two-and-a-half-year voyage to the whaling grounds off the west coast of South America. The route towards Cape Horn was an indirect one dictated by the prevailing winds of the Atlantic Ocean. First the ship would sail with the westerlies towards Europe and Africa, and then back towards South America with the northeast trade winds. There were scheduled stops at the Azores and Cape Verde Islands, where the ship could be stocked with provisions more cheaply than at Nantucket.

A few days into the voyage, &quot;Essex&quot; was hit by a sudden squall in the Gulf Stream. She was knocked on her beam-ends and nearly sank; damages included the loss of her topgallant sail and two whaleboats, with an additional whaleboat sustaining minor damage. Pollard&#x27;s initial thought was to return to Nantucket for repairs, but he accepted the arguments of Chase and Joy, the first and second mates, who wished to continue to the Azores. At the Cape Verde Islands the crew were able to purchase a whaleboat. Later, as &quot;Essex&quot; sailed down the east coast of South America, three months into the voyage, the first whale was killed.

In the face of strong winds from the west, &quot;Essex&quot; took over a month to round Cape Horn into the whaling grounds of the South Pacific. In January 1820 she met up with other whalers from Nantucket at St Mary&#x27;s Island off the west coast of Chile.

===Whaling grounds depleted===
After several months searching for whales off the coast of Chile, &quot;Essex&quot; sailed north and met with more success off the coast of Peru. Within two months they had killed enough whales to produce 450 barrels of oil. In May 1820, &quot;Essex&quot; hailed &quot;Aurora&quot;, another whaler from Nantucket, whose captain told them that another whaling ground, known as the &quot;offshore ground&quot;, had been discovered more than off the Peruvian coast. Pollard decided that, after making provisioning stops, he would set sail for these new grounds, rather than stay in the depleted coastal grounds.

In September 1820, &quot;Essex&quot; sailed to the Peruvian port town of Atacames (now part of Ecuador). It was here that Henry DeWitt jumped ship, leaving &quot;Essex&quot; with a crew of only twenty. When whales were spotted from &quot;Essex&quot;, the three whaleboats, each with an officer, a boatsteerer and four crew members, would go in pursuit. Without DeWitt, there would be only two crew members left aboard &quot;Essex&quot;, not enough to safely handle a ship of &quot;Essex&quot;″s size and type.

===Repairs and resupply at the Galápagos Islands===
To restock their food supplies for the long journey, &quot;Essex&quot; sailed for Charles Island (later renamed Floreana Island) in the Galápagos Islands. The crew needed to fix a serious leak and initially anchored off Hood Island (now known as Española Island) on October 8, 1820. During a week at anchor, they captured 300 Galápagos giant tortoises to supplement the ship&#x27;s food stores. They then sailed for Charles Island, where on October 22 they took another sixty tortoises. The tortoises weighed between each. The sailors captured them alive and allowed some of them to roam the ship at will; the rest they kept in the hold. They believed the tortoises were capable of living for a year without eating or drinking water (though in fact the tortoises slowly starved).

While hunting on Charles Island, Chappel lit a fire as a prank. It was the height of the dry season, and the fire quickly burned out of control, surrounding the hunters and forcing them to run through the flames to escape. By the time the men returned to &quot;Essex&quot;, almost the entire island was burning and Pollard swore vengeance on whoever had set it. The next day, the island was still burning as the ship sailed for the offshore grounds; even after a full day of sailing, the fire was still visible on the horizon. Chappel would only admit that he had set the fire much later after &quot;Essex&quot; sank. Many years later, Nickerson returned to Charles Island and found a blackened wasteland; he observed &quot;neither trees, shrubbery, nor grass have since appeared&quot;.

===Whale attack===
When &quot;Essex&quot; reached the hunting grounds about west of the Galápagos Islands, whales still proved elusive. When they finally found a whale on November 16, 1820, it surfaced directly beneath Chase&#x27;s boat. No one was injured, but the boat required repairs.

At eight in the morning of November 20, 1820, the lookout sighted spouts, and the three remaining whaleboats set out to pursue a pod of sperm whales. On the leeward side of &quot;Essex&quot;, Chase&#x27;s whaleboat harpooned a whale, but its tail struck the boat and opened up a seam, forcing the crew to cut the harpoon line and return to &quot;Essex&quot; for repairs. Two miles away off the windward side, Pollard&#x27;s and Joy&#x27;s boats each harpooned a whale and were dragged towards the horizon away from &quot;Essex&quot;.

Chase was repairing the damaged whaleboat on board &quot;Essex&quot; when the crew sighted an unusually large sperm whale bull (reportedly around in length) acting strangely. It lay motionless on the surface facing the ship and then began to swim towards the vessel, picking up speed by shallow diving. The whale rammed &quot;Essex&quot;, rocking her from side to side, and then dove under her, surfacing close on the ship&#x27;s starboard side. As its head lay alongside the bow and the tail by the stern, it was motionless and appeared to be stunned. Chase prepared to harpoon it from the deck when he realized that its tail was only inches from the rudder, which the whale could easily destroy if provoked by an attempt to kill it. Fearing to leave the ship stuck thousands of miles from land with no way to steer it, Chase hesitated. The whale recovered, swam several hundred yards forward of the ship, and turned to face the ship&#x27;s bow.

The whale crushed the bow, driving the vessel backwards, and then finally disengaged its head from the shattered timbers and swam off, leaving &quot;Essex&quot; quickly going down by the bow. Chase and the remaining sailors retrieved the spare whaleboat while the steward, William Bond, ran below to gather the captain&#x27;s sea chest and whatever navigational aids he could find. The whaleboats of Pollard and Joy were about from &quot;Essex&quot; when one of the boatsteerers looked back and saw the ship falling on her beam-ends. The two boats hurriedly released their whales and rowed back to &quot;Essex&quot;.

The cause of the whale&#x27;s aggression is not known. In &quot;In the Heart of the Sea&quot;, author Nathaniel Philbrick speculated that it may have first struck the boat accidentally or have had its curiosity aroused by the sound of a hammer as the damaged whaleboat was being repaired. The frequency and sound of the nailing may have sounded similar to those made by bull sperm whales to communicate and echolocate.

== Survivors ==
===Abandoning the wreck===

The crew spent the next two days salvaging what supplies remained from the waterlogged wreck of &quot;Essex&quot;. Three whaleboats were rigged with makeshift masts and sails were taken from &quot;Essex&quot;, and boards were added to heighten the gunwales and prevent large waves from spilling over the sides. Inside Pollard&#x27;s sea chest, which Bond&#x27;s quick thinking had managed to save, were two sets of navigational equipment and two copies of maritime charts. These were split between Pollard&#x27;s and Chase&#x27;s boats; Joy&#x27;s boat was left without any means of navigating except to keep within sight of the other boats.

&quot;Essex&quot; sank approximately west of South America. The officers debated which route to take towards land. Pollard favoured sailing west with the prevailing winds and current. The nearest islands to the west were Marquesas Islands, about away, but Pollard was afraid they would encounter cannibals there and concluded that it would be better to sail to the Society Islands, about . Chase and Joy disagreed, fearing that the Society islanders might be cannibals, and suggested sailing south for about and then picking up a band of variable winds to take them to the coast of Chile or Peru, all the time hoping to come across another whaleship. In fact, both the Marquesas and Society Islands would have been safe destinations, as the inhabitants were at that time friendly towards mariners, but Pollard accepted the suggestion of Chase and Joy. 

Herman Melville later speculated that the crew would all have survived had they followed Pollard&#x27;s recommendation and sailed to the Society Islands, writing: &quot;All the sufferings of these miserable men of the Essex might, in all human probability, have been avoided had they immediately after leaving the wreck, steered straight for Tahiti, from which they were not very distant at the time. But they dreaded cannibals&quot;.

The crew were divided between the three boats, under the command of Pollard, Chase and Joy, and on November 22, 1820, set off for land. Never designed for long voyages, all the whaleboats had been very roughly repaired, and leaks were a constant and serious problem during the voyage. After losing a timber, the crew of one boat had to lean to one side to raise the other side out of the water until another boat was able to draw close, allowing a sailor to nail a piece of wood over the hole. Storms and rough seas frequently plagued the tiny whaleboats, and the men who were not occupied with steering and trimming the sails spent most of their time bailing water from the bilge.

Food and water were rationed from the beginning, with the men first consuming the bread that had been soaked in seawater, even though it increased their thirst. After ten days of eating only meagre rations of bread, they slaughtered the first of the giant tortoises that had been salvaged from the wreck and achieved a small respite from hunger.

=== Landfall ===
On December 20, exactly one month after the whale attack, with the men suffering from starvation, dehydration and exposure, the boats landed on uninhabited Henderson Island, a small uplifted coral atoll within the modern-day British territory of the Pitcairn Islands. The men incorrectly believed that they had landed on Ducie Island, a similar atoll to the east. Had they landed on Pitcairn Island itself, to the southwest, they might have received help; the descendants of the survivors of , who had famously mutinied in 1789, still lived there.

On Henderson Island, &quot;Essex&quot;″s crew found food in the form of birds, eggs, crabs, fish and peppergrass but water proved more difficult to find, although they eventually came across a freshwater spring below the tideline. After just one week, they had largely exhausted the island&#x27;s food resources. On December 26, they concluded they would starve if they remained much longer. As most of the crew prepared to set sail in the whaleboats once again, three men – William Wright, Seth Weeks and Thomas Chappel, the only white members of the crew who were not natives of Nantucket – opted to stay behind on the island. Pollard promised, if he made it back to South America, to see that they were rescued. Pollard was true to his word, and the three men on Henderson Island were rescued by &quot;Surry&quot;, an Australian trading vessel, in April 1821.

=== Separation and cannibalism ===
The remaining &quot;Essex&quot; crewmen, now numbering seventeen in three boats, resumed their journey on December 27 with the intention of reaching Easter Island. On January 4, 1821, they estimated that they had drifted too far south of Easter Island and decided to make for Más Afuera Island off the coast of Chile. On the same day they exhausted their supply of fish and birds from Henderson Island and were back on daily rations of a cup of water and three ounces of bread.

On January 10, Joy, who had been in poor health even before &quot;Essex&quot; left Nantucket, died; his body was consigned to the sea. Pollard&#x27;s boatsteerer, Obed Hendricks, took over the command of Joy&#x27;s boat. The following day, Chase&#x27;s boat became separated from the others during a squall. On January 20, Richard Peterson died on Chase&#x27;s boat and his body too was buried at sea.

On the same day, more than to the north, Lawson Thomas died on Hendricks&#x27; boat. By this time the provisions on Pollard&#x27;s and Hendricks&#x27; boats had almost run out, and they decided to eat the body. Two days later Charles Shorter died and was eaten. Within a few days Isaiah Sheppard and Samuel Reed suffered a similar fate. On the night of January 29, the boats of Pollard and Hendricks became separated. Hendricks&#x27; boat lacked any navigational equipment and he and his two remaining crew members, William Bond and Joseph West, were never seen again. Months later a whaleboat with four skeletons in it was found washed up on Ducie Island, and it was suggested that the boat was Hendricks&#x27;.

By February 6, the crew of Pollard&#x27;s boat were again starving. It was decided to draw lots, and Owen Coffin was shot and eaten. Five days later Barzillai Ray died and was eaten by Pollard and Charles Ramsdell. Meanwhile, the men in Chase&#x27;s boat had resorted to cannibalism when Isaac Cole died on February 10. &quot;I have no language to paint the anguish of our souls in this dreadful dilemma&quot;, Chase later recounted in his memoirs.

==Rescue and reunion==
On the morning of February 18, Lawrence, who was steering Chase&#x27;s boat, spotted a sail a few miles distant. They managed to catch up with the vessel, which turned out to be the British ship . Too weak to climb aboard the ship, Chase, Lawrence and Nickerson had to be lifted from their boat and carried to the captain&#x27;s cabin. Later that day they came within sight of Más Afuera, the island towards which Chase had, with remarkable accuracy, been navigating. A few days later &quot;Indian&quot; sailed into the port of Valparaíso. The whaleboat, which was being towed behind &quot;Indian&quot;, was lost in a gale.

On 23 February, ninety-three days after the sinking of &quot;Essex&quot;, Pollard and Ramsdell were spotted by the Nantucket whaleship &quot;Dauphin&quot; near St Mary&#x27;s Island off the coast of Chile, where &quot;Essex&quot; had stopped over a year before. Pollard and Ramsdell were close to starvation, sucking on the bones of their dead shipmates and drifting in and out of consciousness when they were taken aboard &quot;Dauphin&quot;. They were then transferred to another Nantucket whaleship, , which was sailing for Valparaíso. On March 17 they reached the port and were reunited with Chase, Lawrence and Nickerson, who had been recovering on the frigate under the care of the ship&#x27;s surgeon. All the whaleboat survivors were Nantucketers. On March 23, Chase, Lawrence, Nickerson and Ramsdell set off for Nantucket in the whaleship &quot;Eagle&quot;. Pollard was still too weak to make the journey and followed them aboard &quot;Two Brothers&quot; in May.

The commander of &quot;Constellation&quot; arranged the rescue of the three seamen who had stayed on what they thought was Ducie Island (actually Henderson Island). He asked the captain of an Australian trading vessel &quot;Surry&quot;, which was returning to Australia, to stop at Ducie Island and pick up the survivors. When they found Ducie Island uninhabited, the captain of &quot;Surry&quot; wondered if the officers of &quot;Essex&quot; had confused Ducie and Henderson Islands and decided to sail on to Henderson Island, where they found Chappel, Weeks and Wright on April 9.

==Aftermath==
Pollard returned to sea in early 1822 to captain &quot;Two Brothers&quot;. She was wrecked on the French Frigate Shoals to the northwest of the Sandwich Islands during Pollard&#x27;s first voyage as her captain. The crew, which included Nickerson and Ramsdell, took to two whaleboats and were picked up the following day by the whaleship &quot;Martha&quot;, who had been sailing with them. This wreck was to end Pollard&#x27;s whaling career; he was considered a doomed captain, or &quot;Jonah&quot;, whom no whaleship owner would trust with a vessel. After one voyage aboard a merchant vessel, he retired from the sea and became a night watchman on Nantucket. Every year on November 20, the anniversary of the sinking of &quot;Essex&quot;, he would lock himself in his room and observe a fast. He died in Nantucket on January 7, 1870, aged 78.

Chase returned to Nantucket on June 11, 1821, to find he had a 14-month-old daughter he had never met. Four months later he had completed an account of the disaster, the &quot;Narrative of the Most Extraordinary and Distressing Shipwreck of the Whale-Ship Essex&quot;; Herman Melville used it as one of the inspirations for his 1851 novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;. Chase then sailed as first mate on the whaleship &quot;Florida&quot;, returning to Nantucket in 1823. His wife died after the birth of their third child, and he married the widow of former &quot;Essex&quot; mate Matthew Joy. He then captained the New Bedford whaleship &quot;Winslow&quot; and the Nantucket whaleship &quot;Charles Carroll&quot;, in which he owned a share. Chase married again after the death of his second wife, only to divorce his third wife when he found out she had given birth sixteen months after he had last seen her, although he subsequently brought up the child as his own. In September 1840, two months after the divorce was finalized, he married for the fourth and final time and retired from whaling. Haunted by memories of his ordeal, Chase suffered headaches and nightmares and began hiding food in his attic. He spent a period of about eight years in Quaise Asylum on the island. He died in Nantucket on March 7, 1869, aged 73.

Lawrence captained the whaleships &quot;Dromo&quot; and &quot;Huron&quot; before retiring and buying a small farm at Siasconset on Nantucket. He died on Nantucket on March 28, 1879, aged 80.

Ramsdell captained the whaleship &quot;General Jackson&quot;. He died on Nantucket on July 8, 1866, aged 62.

Nickerson became a captain in the merchant service and moved to Brooklyn, New York. Late in his life he returned to Nantucket, where he ran a boarding house for summer visitors and wrote an account of the sinking, titled &quot;The Loss of the Ship &quot;Essex&quot; Sunk by a Whale and the Ordeal of the Crew in Open Boats&quot;. Nickerson wrote this account fifty-six years after the sinking, in 1876, and it was lost until 1960; the Nantucket Historical Association published it in 1984. He died in February 1883, aged 77.

The three men, Chappel, Weeks and Wright, who had been rescued from Henderson Island continued to work as crew members of their rescue ship &quot;Surry&quot; before making their way back to England and the United States. Chappel retired from sailing and became a missionary; he died of plague fever in Timor at an unknown date. Wright was lost at sea in a hurricane in the West Indies about 1834. Weeks became a captain and retired to Cape Cod, where he died on September 12, 1887, having outlived the rest of the &quot;Essex&quot; survivors.

==Cultural works==
As well as inspiring much of American author Herman Melville&#x27;s classic 1851 novel &quot;Moby-Dick&quot;, the story of the &quot;Essex&quot; tragedy has been dramatized in film, television, and music:

* The dramatized documentary &quot;Revenge of the Whale&quot; (2001), was produced and broadcast on September 7, 2001, by NBC.
* The television movie &quot;The Whale&quot; (2013) was broadcast on BBC One on December 22, wherein an elderly Thomas Nickerson (played by Martin Sheen) recounted the events of &quot;Essex&quot;. Charles Furness played the younger Nickerson, Jonas Armstrong played Owen Chase, and Adam Rayner played Captain Pollard.
* The 2015 film &quot;In The Heart of the Sea&quot;, directed by Ron Howard, was based on Nathaniel Philbrick&#x27;s book of the same name. Chris Hemsworth starred as Owen Chase and Benjamin Walker as Captain Pollard. Brendan Gleeson and Tom Holland portrayed the elder and younger Nickerson, respectively.

<doc id="914932" wikidata="Q317778" url="?curid=914932" title="Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed">
<text>Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed (13 May 1905 – 11 February 1977) was an Indian lawyer and politician who served as the president of India from 1974 to 1977.

Born in Delhi, Ahmed studied in Delhi and Cambridge and was called to the bar from the Inner Temple, London in 1928. Returning to India, he practiced law in Lahore and then in Guwahati. Beginning a long association with the Indian National Congress in the 1930s, Ahmed was finance minister of Assam in the Gopinath Bordoloi ministry in 1939. He became the Advocate General of Assam in 1946, and was finance minister again from 1957 to 1966 under Bimala Prasad Chaliha. He was made a national cabinet minister by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi in 1966 and was in charge of various ministries including Power, Irrigation, Industries and Agriculture. He was elected president of India over Tridib Chaudhuri in 1974.

As president, Ahmed imposed The Emergency in August 1975 and gave his assent to numerous ordinances and constitutional amendments that severely restricted civil liberties and allowed Indira Gandhi to rule by decree. He supported the Emergency in public speeches. Lampooned in an iconic cartoon by Abu Abraham, Ahmed&#x27;s reputation was tarnished by his support for the Emergency. He has been described as a rubber stamp president.

Ahmed died in February 1977 of a heart attack. He was accorded a state funeral and is buried in a masjid near Parliament House in New Delhi. Ahmed, who was the second Muslim to become the president of India, was also the second president to die in office. Ahmed was succeeded by B. D. Jatti as acting president and by Neelam Sanjiva Reddy as the sixth president of India in 1977.

== Early life and family ==
Ahmed was born in Delhi on 13 May 1905. Ahmed&#x27;s grandfather, Kaliluddin Ali Ahmed, was an Islamic scholar and his father, Col. Zalnur Ali was a doctor who belonged to the Indian Medical Service and is thought to be the first medical graduate from Assam. Ahmed&#x27;s mother, Sahibzadi Ruqaiyya Sultan, was a daughter of the Nawab of Loharu. Ahmed was one of ten children, including five sons, of Colonel Ali. In 2018 it emerged that several of Ahmed&#x27;s relatives were left out of the National Register of Citizens for Assam as they could not produce documents to prove their antecedents.

==Education and legal career==
Ahmed attended government high schools in Gonda, United Provinces and in Delhi. He attended St. Stephen&#x27;s College, Delhi during 1921–22, before leaving for England. He passed his history tripos from St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge in 1927. He was called to the bar from the Inner Temple, London in 1928. He returned to India the same year and practiced law at the Lahore High Court before moving to Guwahati in 1930 where he worked initially as a junior lawyer under Nabin Chandra Bardoloi. At Guwahati, Ahmed, who later became the Advocate General for the state, was the founding president of the Bar Association of the Assam High Court after its formation in 1948.

==Role in the Indian National Congress==
Ahmed joined the Indian National Congress as a primary member in 1931 and was a member of the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee, the Working Committee of the Assam Pradesh Congress Committee and the All India Congress Committee from 1936 onwards, except for short breaks. He was a member of the Working Committee of the All India Congress Committee in 1946–47 and again from 1964 to 1974 during which period he was also a member of the Parliamentary Board of the party.

==Electoral career in pre-Independence India==
Ahmed was elected to the legislative assembly of Assam in the provincial elections of 1937 which were held in accordance with the Government of India Act, 1935. He was one of three Muslim ministers in the Congress government headed by Gopinath Bordoloi, serving as Minister for Finance, Revenue and Labour from 20 September 1938 to 16 November 1939.

In his budget for 1939–40, Ahmed introduced several new taxes, including an agricultural income tax, taxes on amusements and betting and a tax on sale of goods in an effort to eliminate the state&#x27;s revenue deficit. The tax on agricultural income imposed a levy on the profits of the tea industry, a part of which was to be used for the welfare of workers in the tea plantations. This, and the pro-labour stance he took during the strike in the Assam Oil Company, was deemed inimical to British commercial interests in Assam but won much public support for the Bordoloi Ministry.

At the outbreak of the Second World War, Congress governments across India resigned in protest against Viceroy Lord Linlithgow&#x27;s action of declaring India a belligerent without consulting them. In 1940, Ahmed was arrested and imprisoned for a year when he performed a satyagraha on Gandhi&#x27;s behest. After the launch of the Quit India Movement, Ahmed was arrested on 9 August 1942, along with several other leaders of the Assam Provincial Congress Committee. He was detained as a prisoner for a further three years at the jail in Jorhat.

Ahmed was opposed to the Muslim League&#x27;s demand for the creation of Pakistan and to the Partition of India along communal lines. However, in the elections of 1946, while the Congress won the majority of seats to form a government in Assam under Gopinath Bordoloi, Ahmed was defeated in the North Kamrup constituency by the Muslim League&#x27;s Moulvi Abdul Hye. Although the Congress Party under Gopinath Bordoloi spent much money and effort in order to try and secure victory for Ahmed, he won only 844 votes against the 7,265 votes polled by Hye. Ahmed was thereafter appointed the Advocate General of Assam, a post he held until 1952.

== Career in independent India ==
Although he was offered a seat in the legislative assembly elections of 1952, Ahmed refused to contest the elections due to disagreements with the leadership of the Congress party and the Chief Minister Bishnuram Medhi. In April 1954, he was elected to the Rajya Sabha and was a member until he resigned in March 1957. He contested and won the 1957 Assam Legislative Assembly election from Jania winning 66.13% of the votes cast, and was re-elected to the seat in the 1962 Assam Legislative Assembly election; he improved his majority, winning 84.56% of the votes. Under the governments headed by Chief Minister Bimala Prasad Chaliha, Ahmed served as Minister of Finance, Law, Community Development, Panchayats and Local Self Government during 1957-1962 and was the Minister of Finance, Law, Community Development and Panchayats during 1962–66.

Ahmed facilitated the entry of Muhammed Saadulah, the Muslim League leader who preceded Gopinath Bordoloi as Assam&#x27;s Prime Minister, into the Congress Party in 1951. Ahmed played a role in frustrating Chief Minister Chaliha&#x27;s attempts at enforcing the Prevention of Infiltrators Plan which, based on the National Register of Citizens, 1951, sought to identify and deport illegal migrants to Assam. He argued that if the Congress Party were to continue with this plan, it would lead to its loss of support among Muslims in Assam and across the rest of India. He has been accused of thus allowing the steady influx of Muslims from East Pakistan who became a votebank for the Congress Party. Salman Khurshid has identified this strategy, which he attributes to Ahmed, as one of the factors that led to the Nellie Massacre.

==Union Minister==
=== Minister of Irrigation and Power ===
In January 1966, while serving as Assam&#x27;s Finance Minister, Ahmed was appointed the Union Minister for Irrigation and Power in Indira Gandhi&#x27;s first cabinet. He was one of a handful of ministers she brought to Shastri&#x27;s cabinet, which initially remained largely unchanged under her leadership. In April of that year, he was elected to the Rajya Sabha for a second time.

===Minister of Education===
Ahmed was shifted to the Ministry of Education, succeeding M.C. Chagla, and served as the Union Minister for Education between 13 November 1966 and 12 March 1967. In his brief period in that Ministry, Ahmed voiced concerns over the reduced allocations made to the Ministry and its likely impacts on educational reconstruction programs and oversaw the Amending Bill of 1966 to the Banaras Hindu University Act.

=== Minister of Industrial Development and Company Affairs ===
Ahmed was made the Minister of Industrial Development and Company Affairs on 13 March 1967. In the parliamentary elections of 1967, Ahmed was elected to the Lok Sabha from the Barpeta constituency in Assam, winning over 60% of the votes. During Ahmed&#x27;s tenure as Minister of Industrial Development, his ministry, through the Directorate General of Technical Development, issued a letter of intent to Sanjay Gandhi to manufacture 50,000 Maruti cars annually, even though Gandhi lacked the technical expertise and the capital required for establishing such a venture.

In 1969, Ahmed introduced a bill in Parliament seeking to ban corporate funding to political parties. The bill, which sought to amend the Companies Act, 1956, aimed to curb the influence of large businesses on the political establishment. It also aimed to hamstring the centre-right Swatantra Party by preventing its access to funding. The ban, introduced without establishing an alternative financing mechanism, resulted in the abolishment of a key legal source of election funds for parties and a subsequent proliferation of illegal practices in campaign funding.

In September 1969, Ahmed was sent to Rabat, Morocco as head of the Indian delegation at the Islamic Summit held there. However, upon his arrival in Morocco the Indian delegation was barred from attending the summit on the objections of the Pakistani delegation led by General Ayub Khan. The incident proved to be a diplomatic fiasco for India and led to a vote of censure in Parliament. The censure was defeated by the Government with the help of the communist and regional parties, as the Congress Party&#x27;s own strength in Parliament had reduced following an August split in the party.

=== Minister for Food and Agriculture ===
Ahmed was appointed Minister for Food and Agriculture on 27 June 1970, serving in that office until 3 July 1974. He was re-elected from Barpeta in the general election of 1971, winning over 72% of the votes polled. In May 1971, he was also made the minister in charge of wakf under the Muslim Wakfs Act, 1954. In 1971 the Central Land Reforms Committee was constituted, with Ahmed as its chairman, with the aim of helping the state governments undertake comprehensive land reform. The recommendations of the committee included fixing land ceilings at the level of the family, restrictively defining the family to include only a husband, wife and their minor children, and fixing ceilings between 10 and 18 acres of land for different types of land. Its recommendations paved the way for introduction of agricultural land ceilings in state legislations. 2.7 million hectares of excess land holdings were discovered, of which 53% was subsequently redistributed among people from the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

As minister, Ahmed supported the creation of food and fertilizer buffer stocks to meet shortfalls in production. The nationalization of the wholesale trade in wheat by the government of India was implemented under Ahmed in 1973. Although it was aimed at preventing market distortions and ensuring stability of prices, the policy proved disastrous, leading to lower procurements and the running down of buffer stocks, and eventually forcing the import of over 60 lakh tonnes of grain at high prices. Consequently, proposals to extend nationalization to the trade in rice and for the wheat crop of April 1974 were abandoned.

==President of India (1974–1977)==
===Election as president===

In July 1974, Ahmed was chosen by Indira Gandhi and the Congress Party as their candidate to be the next President of India. In doing so, they overlooked the then Vice President, Gopal Swarup Pathak, who had been elected to that post in 1969 with the support of the Congress Party. Polling for the 1974 Indian presidential election was held on 17 August in a direct contest between the Congress Party&#x27;s Ahmed and the opposition candidate Tridib Chaudhuri, a Lok Sabha MP from the Revolutionary Socialist Party. Ahmed won 765,587 votes (or 80.18% of the 954,783 votes cast) against Chaudhuri&#x27;s 189,196 and he was declared elected on 20 August.

Ahmed was sworn in as the fifth president of India on 24 August 1974, becoming the second Muslim to hold that office and the first person to be directly elevated to the presidency from the Union Cabinet. He was also the first president to be elected after the amendments to the Presidential and Vice-Presidential Elections Act, 1952 that imposed a security deposit of and made it mandatory for every candidate in a presidential election to be supported by ten proposing and ten seconding legislators. Ahmed&#x27;s election was challenged unsuccessfully before India&#x27;s Supreme Court by Charu Lal Sahu, an advocate-on-record.

===Promulgation of the Emergency===
Ahmed imposed a national emergency under Article 352 of India&#x27;s Constitution late in the night of 25 June 1975 on the advice of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The legality of its imposition – on the ground that &quot;a grave emergency exists whereby the security of India is threatened by internal disturbances.&quot; – was dubious, as there were no reports to that effect from the Intelligence Bureau, the Home Ministry or from any or the governors of the states, nor had the proposal been considered by the Union Council of Ministers. Although the constitutional impropriety was pointed out to him, Ahmed raised no questions and chose to sign the order imposing the emergency, a draft of which was brought to him by the Prime Minister&#x27;s personal secretary, R. K. Dhawan.

In the early hours of the next day, electricity supply was cut off to newspaper offices in Delhi and the main leaders of opposition parties placed under arrest. The Cabinet met at 7AM on 26 June, where it was informed by the prime minister of the imposition of emergency the previous night. Prime Minister Gandhi subsequently addressed the nation on All India Radio announcing the Emergency, beginning with the words &quot;The President has proclaimed an emergency. This is nothing to panic about.&quot; The Emergency, which lasted until 21 March 1977, saw the suppression of civil liberties, the arrest of opposition politicians and clampdown on political parties, the suspension of fundamental rights guaranteed by the Indian Constitution and the muzzling of the media. It has been described as a period of darkness for India&#x27;s democracy.

===Ordinances and Constitutional Amendments===
The two-thirds majority enjoyed by the Congress Party in India&#x27;s Parliament allowed it to undertake several wide-ranging constitutional amendments. The Prime Minister also instructed Ahmed to issue ordinances, sidestepping Parliament and allowing for rule by decree. In August 1975, the thirty-eighth and thirty-ninth Constitutional Amendment Bills passed by Parliament received presidential assent. The 38th Amendment precluded the Emergency and the ordinances passed during this period from judicial review, while the 39th Amendment barred the courts from adjudicating election petitions filed against the president, the vice president, the prime minister and the speaker of the Lok Sabha and rendered any pending proceedings before the courts null and void.

Ordinances issued in 1975 included one abolishing bonded labour, the Equal Remuneration Ordinance which provided for equal pay for equal work or work of similar nature, the amendment to the Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling Activities Act, 1974 allowing detention of offenders for a period of two years, and an amendment to the Import and Export (Controls) Act increasing the severity of penalties for offences relating to the misuse of import licences and imported goods among scores of other ordinances issued during the year. In December 1975, while President Ahmed was on a state visit to Egypt and Sudan, the government dispatched a special courier carrying three executive ordinances preventing the publication of material deemed objectionable by the government, abolishing the Press Council of India and lifting immunities on media&#x27;s coverage of Parliament. These were promptly signed in Cairo by the President. The first session of Parliament in 1976 therefore had to consider and replace with acts the numerous ordinances issued since the proclamation of Emergency in June 1975.

In January 1976, President&#x27;s rule was declared in Tamil Nadu after Ahmed dismissed its government, headed by Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi, and dissolved the state&#x27;s legislative assembly. By two ordinances issued in March 1976, the responsibility of maintaining government accounts were taken away from the Comptroller and Auditor General of India and vested with the accounts offices of individual government departments, while making the Comptroller and Auditor General responsible for the audit of these accounts. In June 1976, an ordinance extended by a year the validity of provisions allowing the government to detain any person for up to one year without disclosing the grounds for detention to the detainee under the Maintenance of Internal Security Act. In December 1976, the Forty-second Constitutional Amendment Bill received President Ahmed&#x27;s assent. The bill, passed by both houses of Parliament in November, amended as many as 59 articles of the Constitution and the Preamble, besides introducing a new section containing the Fundamental Duties of citizens. Furthermore, it sought to severely circumscribe the powers of the Supreme Court, transferred several responsibilities hitherto entrusted with the state governments to the Central government, and extended the tenure of the Lok Sabha to six years.

===Support for the Emergency===
As president, Ahmed publicly spoke in favour of the imposition of Emergency throughout this period. In his address to the nation on Independence Day, 1975 he assured citizens that the Emergency was a &quot;passing phase&quot; and its imposition was necessary to save India from chaos and disruption. He also cautioned that liberty should not &quot;degenerate into licence&quot; and exhorted the nation to focus on increasing production. Elsewhere, he reiterated that the &quot;Emergency is a passing phase but the era of permissive politics and national degeneration is over and we will never allow that phase to be repeated again&quot; and that the indiscipline and disorder brought about by reactionary forces had slowed down India&#x27;s development. Addressing the nation on Republic Day, 1976, Ahmed said that the Emergency had helped India&#x27;s economy and brought about &quot;national discipline at all levels&quot;. On the Independence Day in 1976, he stated that the Emergency would not be used to switch over from the parliamentary to a presidential system of government or to accumulate more power than was permitted under the Constitution and that it had been issued instead &quot;to bring about such economic, social and political changes as have become relevant and necessary in the interests of the people of India&quot;.

In private, Ahmed appeared to have misgivings about the Emergency. This was revealed in an embassy cable sent from the United States Embassy in Delhi in August 1976 which suggested an estrangement between Ahmed and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The cable noted Ahmed&#x27;s growing concern that Indira and Sanjay Gandhi were &quot;pushing too hard on the political and Constitutional system of India&quot; and reported that he had rebuffed her suggestion to replace the vice-president, B.D. Jatti with her former defence minister, Swaran Singh. Indira Gandhi&#x27;s proposal to replace her entire cabinet with younger ministers was also cautioned against by Ahmed, who warned her that this would jeopardize the unity of the Congress Party. The cable went on to note that Ahmed was &quot;uncomfortable with some of Mrs. Gandhi&#x27;s actions and certainly with those of her son&quot; and that Indira Gandhi had apologized to Ahmed on behalf of Sanjay Gandhi for his rude remarks when the President declined to give a statement for the inaugural issue of the younger Gandhi&#x27;s magazine, Surya.

=== Abu Abraham&#x27;s cartoon and the rubber stamp presidency ===
On 10 December 1975, a cartoon by Abu Abraham, which escaped the notice of the government censors, appeared in the &quot;Indian Express&quot;. The cartoon showed Ahmed, semi-naked and in a bathtub filled to its brim, handing over a paper he has signed to an outstretched hand of a person clothed in a formal suit and shirt. The speech balloon reads: &quot;If there are any more ordinances, just ask them to wait.&quot; The cartoon, which lampooned Ahmed&#x27;s pliability in signing ordinances put before him, became an iconic image of the Emergency. The cartoon irreparably damaged Ahmed&#x27;s image and legacy, and he is widely regarded as a rubber stamp President, who was willing to sign ordinances and the proclamation of Emergency put to him without questioning the government or asking it to be reconsidered. Subsequent Presidents of India who have been thought of as pliant and meekly submitting to the government of the day have been compared to Ahmed&#x27;s rubber stamp presidency.

===State visits===
President Ahmed made state visits to Indonesia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, Egypt, Sudan, Iran and Malaysia during his term in office. His visit to Saudi Arabia in March 1975 to attend the funeral of King Faisal was the first time an Indian President was personally present at the funeral of another head of state and the first visit to Saudi Arabia by a senior Indian leader after Jawaharlal Nehru&#x27;s visit in 1956. He was conferred with an honorary degree of Doctor of Law by the University of Pristina, Kosovo during his visit to Yugoslavia. During his state visit to Sudan in December 1975, Ahmed visited Juba in South Sudan, where he addressed the Regional Peoples&#x27; Assembly, in one of the earliest visits by an Indian dignitary to South Sudan.

=== Interest in sports ===
Ahmed was a keen sportsman throughout his life and was an active golfer during his presidency. He was a centre-half in field hockey and played for the Combined Universities Hockey Team in Cambridge. For many years he was president of Assam&#x27;s State Football and Cricket Associations. He served as the vice-chairman of the Assam Council of Sports and was later President of the All-India Lawn Tennis Federation. Ahmed is credited with reviving the Shillong Golf Club and resurrecting the mini golf course at the Rashtrapati Bhavan. Ahmed introduced the President&#x27;s Polo Cup as an open tournament in 1975, when he was the patron-in-chief of the Indian Polo Association. Temporarily discontinued in 2005, it has been held since 2013 as the President&#x27;s Polo Cup Exhibition Match.

== Death and burial ==
On 10 February 1977, Ahmed, who was on a three nation visit to Malaysia, Philippines and Burma, flew back to New Delhi from Kuala Lumpur. He had been forced to curtail his official engagements in Malaysia due to ill health and was reportedly too weak to attend a guard of honour arranged for him at the Kuala Lumpur airport. In the morning of 11 February, Ahmed, who had previously suffered heart attacks in 1966 and 1970 and whose health was described as being uncertain, was found lying unconscious in his bath in the Rashtrapati Bhavan. He was attended to by doctors but was declared dead at 8:52 a.m. having succumbed to a heart attack. He was India&#x27;s second president to die in office. Vice President B. D. Jatti was sworn in as the acting president within a few hours and thirteen days of national mourning were declared, with flags flying at half-mast.

Ahmed&#x27;s body lay in state in the Durbar Hall of the Rashtrapati Bhavan where common citizens, politicians, ministers and constitutional functionaries from various parties paid their respects to him. He was accorded a state funeral and buried in the grounds of the Jama Masjid near Parliament House on 13 February. Among the foreign dignitaries who attended his funeral were Lillian Carter, the mother of President Jimmy Carter, Prince Michael of Kent and , representing the Soviet Union.

Ahmed&#x27;s death came amidst the campaigning for the general elections of 1977. They had been announced after Ahmed, on the advice of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, had dissolved Parliament in January. In his address to the nation on Republic Day, 1977 Ahmed had called for an election campaign free of bitterness and rancor. Although his death brought a lull to the campaign, it was decided that the polls would be held in March 1977 as planned.

===Tomb===
Ahmed&#x27;s tomb was designed by the architect Habib Rahman. Rahman was also the architect of the tomb for Zakir Hussain, who was the first Muslim and the first President to die in office. The tomb is open to the sky and features thin framed marble jalis which are clamped with the help of internal pins onto structural elements made of steel. The tomb is a post-modern interpretation of traditional Islamic forms, and an abstraction of the silhouette of the Taj Mahal. Its openness makes it an &quot;austere&quot; and &quot;elegant&quot; building and one of Delhi&#x27;s most remarkable pieces of modern architectural heritage, in the view of some critics.

==Family==

Ahmed was married to Begum Abida Ahmed and had two sons and a daughter with her. Begum is credited with having overhauled the presidential kitchen and ensuring Awadhi cuisine was included in its repertoire, as well as redecorating the rooms and upholstery of the Rashtrapati Bhavan. In the 1980s, she went on to become a two-term MP of the Indian National Congress from Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh. The elder of their sons, Parvez Ahmed, is a doctor who contested the General Elections of 2014 from Barpeta as a candidate of the Trinamool Congress party. Their other son, Badar Durrez Ahmed, served as a judge of the Delhi High Court and retired as Chief Justice of the Jammu and Kashmir High Court.

A former director of the Swedish Coast Guard, the Swedish Customs Service, the Swedish police, and president of Interpol. He was, from 1996 to 31 August 2009, governor of Östergötland County, residing at the Linköping Castle.

==Career==
Eriksson was born in Stockholm, Sweden, the son of CFO K-G Eriksson and his wife Aina (née From). He graduated from the Stockholm School of Economics in 1968 and worked at Sparbankernas bank from 1968 to 1969. He then served at the Ministry of Finance/Ministry of Budget, as desk officer from 1969 to 1976, director from 1977 to 1981 and budget director from 1981 to 1983. He was then the General Customs Director and Head of the Swedish Customs Service and the Swedish Coast Guard from 1983 to 1988. In 1988 Eriksson was appointed to the chair of the World Customs Organization. Eriksson served as the National Police Commissioner from 1988 to 1996 and chairman of the National Society for Road Safety from 1993. Eriksson was also vice president of Interpol from 1992 to 1994 and president from 1994 to 1996, after which he was appointed its first honorary president; he retains that title today. In 1996, Eriksson published &quot;Björnkramar&quot; with anecdotes from his time with the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol).

Eriksson served as Governor of Östergötland County from 1996 to 2009. As governor, he was voted Linköping resident of the year in 2005, and as the Östergötland resident of the year in 1998, in a poll organized by Radio Östergötland. Eriksson has been a driving force in efforts to establish a center for research on economic crime and supported the &quot;Tema genus&quot; and research on Bridget of Sweden. He has also supported Linköping University and was conferred with an honorary Doctor of Philosophy degree in the spring of 2006. During his time as county governor, Eriksson annually invited Östergötland residents to song and theater performances at Linköping Castle, where he participated as an actor sometimes alternating as a bun baking and coffee serving host. His wife Helena Eriksson was artistic director of the performances. The town of Rimforsa, Kinda Municipality has a street named after Eriksson.

After Eriksson&#x27;s resignation as governor, he ran the company Björn E Consulting, where he was engaged to give lectures on various subjects. In 2009-2010 he was the government&#x27;s coordinator for the reception of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children. Since 2011, Eriksson has been a member of the board of the Swedish Sports Confederation, and was elected chairman in 2015. He was also chairman of the Swedish Biathlon Federation 2001-2011, and is now on the same union&#x27;s Advisory Board and the Advisory Board for the security company BRM. Eriksson is a board member of the Martial Arts Delegation (&quot;Kampsportsdelegationen&quot;), Vätternrundan International, the Development Committee of the Swedish Biathlon Federation, and the &quot;Säkerhetsbranschen&quot;″s training organization Bya. Since 2013 Eriksson has been the chairman of the private security industry&#x27;s trade association. Eriksson was previously on the board of Gunnebo Group, AIK, Falcon Brewery and Stjärnurmakarna. Eriksson is chairman of the &quot;Årets nybyggare&quot; (&quot;Settler of the Year&quot;), ED Bygger Drömmar, Stenhammar Foundation, &quot;Äldreforskningen vid Linköpings universitet&quot; (&quot;Older research at Linköping University&quot;), Yump and the &quot;Stiftelsen Sveriges Modernaste Myndighet&quot; (&quot;Sweden&#x27;s Most Modern Authority Foundation&quot;).

In 2013 Eriksson became chairman of the board of the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences and the trade association &quot;Säkerhetsbranschen&quot;. 2014-2015 was Eriksson Chairman of the Swedish Athletics Association.

Björn Eriksson was the government&#x27;s national coordinator on sports-related violence between 2011-2013. In April 2013, he presented the report &quot;Less Violence for Money&quot; (&quot;Mindre våld för pengarna&quot;), and the following year presented the final report &quot;More Joy For the Money&quot; (&quot;Mer glädje för pengarna&quot;). He has previously proposed including a tightening of the refusal of access which enables the banning of hooligans, as well as a masking ban for those attending sports arenas. For his work as national coordinator against sports violence Eriksson was named 2013 Security Ambassador by the magazine &quot;SecurityUser.com&quot; think tank &quot;Säkerhet för Näringsliv och Samhälle&quot; (SNOS).

Eriksson worked in 2015 as leader of Cash Uprising (&quot;Kontantupproret&quot;), a movement that wants to see cash as a means of payment in the future.

<doc id="914947" wikidata="Q542182" url="?curid=914947" title="Peugeot 1007">
<text>The Peugeot 1007 is a small three-door car manufactured by Peugeot from 2004 to 2009, noted for its user-swappable interior trim pieces and its four pillar design incorporating two power sliding doors. It shares its platform with the Peugeot 206, Citroën C2 and Citroën C3. Sales commenced in April 2005 in Europe.

==Background==
The 1007 is the production version of the Sésame concept, which was presented at the 2002 Paris Motor Show.

The car featured the optional &quot;2-Tronic&quot; automated manual transmission, also used (under the name &quot;Sensodrive&quot;) on the Citroën&#x27;s C2, C3 and C3 Pluriel which shares the 206&#x27;s 1.4 L and 1.6 L petrol engines and 1.4 L and 1.6 L diesel engines.

For its size, the 1007 was expensive, with prices around €14,000 / £10,000. Euro NCAP awarded the vehicle its second best ever rating for adult occupant safety. It has been described as a supermini, an urban hatchback, a city car, and a small car, while some of the 1007&#x27;s features have been compared to those of multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs). The vehicle was generally described as a &quot;petit monospace&quot;, &quot;minispace&quot; (small MPV) or &quot;microspace&quot; (smaller small MPV) by French press. Pininfarina, the studio that designed the 1007, described it as an MPV. Peugeot referred to the 1007 as a &quot;berline monocorps&quot; (one-box car).
==Features==
The 1007 is the first mainstream car from Peugeot to feature a &quot;double zero&quot; number. In English speaking countries, the name was marketed with the pronunciation &quot;ten oh seven&quot;.

Originally launched with the pronunciation, &quot;one double oh seven&quot;, and James Bond style promotion, Peugeot revised their strategy, under pressure from the Bond franchise owners. It is also commonly called the &quot;one thousand and seven&quot;. In France, it was marketed as the &quot;mille sept&quot;.

==Discontinuation in Europe==
The 1007 was dropped from Peugeot&#x27;s model line up in the United Kingdom in 2008, although the car was still in production in mainland Europe until the end of 2009.

== Reception ==
Although the concept car received good reception from the public, once in production, the 1007 was regarded as one of Peugeot&#x27;s largest sales failures. Overall, due to poor sales, Peugeot lost an estimated €15,380 per vehicle produced.

<text>Joyce Young (born c. 1925) is a Canadian woman famous for a single act of philanthropy, a donation of CAD$40 million to the Hamilton Community Foundation in 2000. She is the wife of Bill Young, a retired Major in the Canadian Armed Forces and the aunt of Red Hat, Inc. founder Bob Young.

==Early life==
Bill Young graduated from Hillfield Strathallan College in 1935 and Joyce graduated from Hillfield in 1943. After graduating, Bill served in the Canadian military during World War II, serving in England, Italy, and northwest Europe. The couple met after Bill returned from the war.

Joyce left The University of Toronto to become a full-time home-maker. The couple have three children, Douglas, Catherine, and William.

==Red Hat, Inc.==

Young and her husband Bill Young, both residents of Ancaster, Ontario, opted to help their nephew Bob with his high-tech venture shortly after its founding in 1993. Bob&#x27;s company, Red Hat, Inc., is one dedicated to open source software such as Red Hat Linux, and the proprietary Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

When Red Hat&#x27;s stock rose significantly after its initial public offering in 1999, the elder Youngs were able to sell enough stock to recoup their initial investment, but chose to retain some stocks. Joyce was quoted as saying,
By January 2000, the remaining stock was valued in the millions. This enabled Joyce to make a donation of CAD$40 million in June 2000, to the Hamilton Community Foundation. The money was given for the purpose of improving Hamilton-area health facilities. This act represented one of the largest charitable donations in Canadian history. A long-time volunteer with local community groups, Joyce later stated her biggest concern was in giving away the money responsibly.

==Projects==

* $50,000 was donated to Hillfield Strathallan College.
* $50,000 was donated for the beautification of the Royal Military College of Canada Memorial Arch.
* $50,000 was donated to the Juno Beach Centre.

Established by 2552 Major (Ret&#x27;d) Bill Young (RMC 1936) and Joyce Young, the J.D. Young Memorial lecture, a speech given at the Royal Military College of Canada, as well as other activities by the Young Memorial Visitor, honour the memories of 2360 Major John Douglas Young (RMC 1937) who was killed in action on D-Day, and his father, Maj.-Gen. James V. Young (RMC 1911). Major Doug Young, having no known grave, is commemorated in the Bayeux Memorial in Calvados.

<text>Riomaggiore (, locally ) is a village and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of La Spezia, situated in a small valley in the Liguria region of Italy. It is the first of the Cinque Terre villages one encounters when travelling north from La Spezia. 
The village, dating from the early thirteenth century, is known for its historic character and wine produced by the town&#x27;s vineyards. Riomaggiore is in the Riviera di Levante region. It has a shoreline on the Mediterranean&#x27;s Gulf of Genoa, with a small beach and a wharf framed by tower houses. Riomaggiore&#x27;s main street is Via Colombo, where numerous restaurants, bars, and shops can be found.

The &quot;Via dell&#x27;Amore&quot; is a path connecting Riomaggiore to its &quot;frazione&quot; Manarola, also part of the Cinque Terre.

Riomaggiore is the most southern village of the five Cinque Terre, all connected by trail. The water and mountainside have been declared national parks.

Riomaggiore inspired paintings by Telemaco Signorini (1835–1901), one of the artists of the Macchiaioli group.

== Transportation ==
Riomaggiore railway station is on the Genoa–Pisa railway. It is served by trains run by Trenitalia, including services from .

Inside Riomaggiore, all major attractions are walkable for tourists.

==In popular culture==
Riomaggiore was featured in the 2014 driving video game &quot;Forza Horizon 2&quot;. The village was not featured as the central location but was referenced on various road signs.

Riomaggiore and other Cinque Terre towns were the inspiration for the fictional Portorosso in the 2021 animated film &quot;Luca&quot;.

<doc id="914970" wikidata="Q6307377" url="?curid=914970" title="Julian McGauran">
<text>Julian John James McGauran (born 5 March 1957) is an Australian former politician who served as a member of the Australian Senate, representing the state of Victoria. Elected as a member of the National Party, he resigned from the Nationals and joined the Liberal Party of Australia in February 2006. His brother, Peter McGauran, was the National member for Gippsland until 2008, and was Minister for Agriculture in the Howard government.

==Background and early career==
McGauran attended Xavier College in Kew, Melbourne. Before attending university, he worked in the stables for racehorse trainer Bart Cummings at Flemington Racecourse. He obtained a Bachelor of Economics from Monash University, then becoming a Certified Practising Accountant and then a company director for the McGauran Group of Companies, and a board member of the Victorian Employers&#x27; Chamber of Commerce and Industry between 1986 and 1988. He was elected to the Melbourne City Council 1985–88, representing the Central Business District.

During his time at the Council, McGauran called for the popular vote of the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, instead of the traditional means of selection by fellow councillor, in an attempt to curtail the &quot;invariable cronyism&quot; of the Melbourne City Council at the time.

==Political career==
===National Party===
McGauran won National Party preselection for a Senate seat in the 1987 double-dissolution election, and was subsequently elected. Following the announcement of the election results other senators negotiated, against McGauran&#x27;s objections, to allocate him a three-year rather than a six-year Senate term.

In 1990, due to the circumstances of an historic agreement forming a Coalition Senate ticket he was required to step out of Parliament for three years. In 1993 he was re-elected to the Senate on the Coalition Senate ticket.

On 2 November 1989, McGauran introduced the End of War List (Private Members Bill) into the Senate. The Bill was passed unanimously in the Senate, and was aimed at recognising the &quot;unsung heroes&quot; of the Vietnam War. Although it was unsuccessful in the House of Representatives at the time, in 1999 the Howard Government did establish the War List and more than 80 Vietnam Vets have been honoured for their acts of bravery since this time.

McGauran was a strong advocate for the freedom of East Timor. He campaigned from 1993 through to 1999 for the East Timor cause against the then-policy of the major parties.

Diagnosed with malaria following a trek along the Kokoda Trail, McGauran ignored doctor&#x27;s orders and flew to Canberra to speak on the controversial Euthanasia Laws 1996 Bill – supporting the Bill to overturn Northern Territory legislation legalising euthanasia. The debate saw the bill narrowly passed in the Senate. The following day he collapsed in his Melbourne office and spent the next week recovering in hospital.

In November 2000, McGauran called for an inquiry into an incident at the Royal Women&#x27;s Hospital where an abortion was performed on a 32-week-old fetus. He argued a possible breach of the Victorian Crimes Act which creates an offence of child destruction after 28 weeks gestation had occurred. After years of public debate and argument, the issue was investigated by the Medical Practitioners Board of Victoria.

In 2001, McGauran became the first Federal MP to join the Australian Army as part of the Federal Government&#x27;s MP exchange program. He Joined 2RAR on exercise at Jimma training base in Queensland. McGauran documented his experience in a diary later published.

Before the 2004 election, McGauran faced a pre-selection challenge from three party members, including a former staffer to Trade Minister Mark Vaile. McGauran retained National Party pre-selection after media reports suggested the federal coalition agreement would be endangered if he lost, and thus gained the guaranteed second position on the joint Liberal-National ticket and was re-elected.

On 11 August, after the Liberal-National Coalition narrowly won a vote in the Senate, he gave the finger to Labor Party senators on the floor of the Senate in response to comments. This prompted calls from Labor senators and Greens Senator Bob Brown that he be sacked as Deputy Government Whip in the Senate. Senate President Paul Calvert ruled that the gesture was &quot;unseemly but not obscene.&quot;

In 2004, the McGauran family bankrolled the Democratic Labor Party&#x27;s High Court challenge against the Australian Electoral Commission which was forcing the political party under threat of deregistration to disclose party membership details.

Although the legal challenge was unsuccessful, the DLP survived, largely due to the support of Julian McGauran, who commented, &quot;We had a serious interest in the outcome of the case, and our heart was with the DLP. I wouldn’t want to see them fade away&quot;. 
McGauran&#x27;s links to the DLP stem from his first Senate election win in 1987 when DLP preferences were critical in his narrow win over former Communist John Halfpenny.

In 2005, McGauran was accused of releasing to &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper the private patient records of a woman who had had an abortion, in breach of a Supreme Court suppression order; however, he denies this accusation. The then Victoria Health Minister, Bronwyn Pike, is quoted in the article as saying that McGauran was &quot;exploiting this woman in pursuit of his own ideological agenda&quot;, describing the act as an assault on the doctor-patient relationship.

===Liberal Party===
On 23 January 2006, McGauran announced that he was resigning from the National Party and would apply to join the Liberal Party. He said there was no longer any significant policy difference between the Nationals and Liberals in Victoria at a federal level, and that he would be best able to represent rural Victorians as a member of the Liberal Party. His application was accepted by the Liberals on 3 February.

Rumours abounded that Liberal deputy leader and Treasurer Peter Costello, himself a Victorian, lobbied McGauran to switch parties. However, Costello and Howard denied this. Nonetheless, federal Nationals leader Mark Vaile condemned McGauran&#x27;s defection as a betrayal while state Nationals leader Peter Ryan claimed that McGauran would be &quot;treated and reviled&quot; as a deserter &quot;for the rest of his days.&quot; One of the few Liberals who didn&#x27;t welcome McGauran to the party was former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett, who called it &quot;a gross act of disloyalty.&quot; McGauran&#x27;s defection highlighted the historically strained relationship between the non-Labor parties in Victoria. The Liberals and Nationals sat separately for most of the second half of the 20th century; while they governed as a Coalition under Kennett, they had gone their separate ways after their shock defeat in 2002.

In 2009, McGauran was the first to speak up against the Liberal policy supporting the Government&#x27;s Emissions Trading Scheme. He said he would not vote for the scheme in any form, in defiance of the then-Liberal leader Malcolm Turnbull.

In April 2010, McGauran, a long time campaigner on censorship issues, called for the sacking of the Australian Classification Board Chairman for the Board&#x27;s release of the formerly banned film &quot;Salò, or the 120 Days of Sodom&quot; by Pier Paolo Pasolini. McGauran described the movie as &quot;a paedophile&#x27;s treat&quot; and a &quot;handbook for deviants&quot;.

In the 2010 election, McGauran lost his Senate seat to the DLP. His term in the Senate expired 30 June 2011.

On 12 May 2011, &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper reported that &quot;Senator Julian McGauran has accused Professor Graham Burrows of giving concocted evidence at the trial of Arthur Freeman, the man serving a life sentence for the murder of his daughter Darcey.&quot; &quot;The Age&quot; reported on McGauran&#x27;s speech in the Australian Senate, saying &quot;Senator McGauran said defence lawyers used Professor Burrows as a &#x27;gun for hire&#x27; and &#x27;psychiatrist of last resort&#x27; and one who will sing whatever song the defence wants&quot;.

On 21 June 2011, McGauran delivered his valedictory speech to the Senate. He referred to his recent performances as an extra in Opera Australia&#x27;s season of &quot;The Pearl Fishers&quot;, saying &quot;That is the thrill of politics: it is an opera. I hope I played it well. So now I leave the stage and the curtain must fall.&quot;

==Post-political career==

McGauran was, until October 2021, a religion, ethics, and commerce &amp; law teacher at Ivanhoe Girls&#x27; Grammar School. He has also taught at Marcellin College and Santa Maria College in Melbourne. As of 2023, he teaches at Sacred Heart Girls&#x27; College.

<text>The Renco Group, Inc. is an American New York City-based holding company controlled by Ira Rennert that invests in other companies across a range of industries.

== History ==
In August 2004, it was announced that Ronald Perelman&#x27;s MacAndrews &amp; Forbes Holdings company would form a joint venture with AM General&#x27;s current owner, Renco Group, to give Perelman 70% ownership of AM General. The deal reportedly cost close to US$1 billion. In 2007, Renco Group lost ownership of its bankrupt subsidiary WCI Steel to its lenders. Through subsidiary Inteva Products, LLC, Renco Group purchased Delphi&#x27;s Global Interiors and Closures businesses in March 2008. In June of 2021 Renco Group purchased Renfro Brands, Renfro Brands is a designer, manufacturer, and marketer of socks and legwear products.

In November 2024 the group acquired Coach USA, which had gone in bankruptcy proceedings.

==Pollution==
The Renco Group also owns various mills and mines in the United States and South America, and pollution problems at some of the company&#x27;s properties have sparked public outcries, environmental lawsuits, and hundreds of millions of dollars in environmental penalties and fines.

One Renco subsidiary, magnesium producer US Magnesium (USM), is accused of polluting the Great Salt Lake in Utah.

Smelting operations by another Renco subsidiary, Doe Run Company, are responsible for elevated levels of lead, arsenic, and cadmium in Herculaneum, Missouri, and elevated levels of lead, copper, zinc, and sulfur dioxide in La Oroya, Peru. In 2007, La Oroya was listed by Blacksmith Institute as one of the &quot;World&#x27;s Worst Polluted Places&quot;.

<doc id="914987" wikidata="Q786993" url="?curid=914987" title="Soroban">
<text>The is an abacus developed in Japan. It is derived from the ancient Chinese suanpan, imported to Japan in the 14th century. Like the suanpan, the soroban is still used today, despite the proliferation of practical and affordable pocket electronic calculators.

==Construction==
The soroban is composed of an odd number of columns or rods, each having beads: one separate bead having a value of five, called and four beads each having a value of one, called . Each set of beads of each rod is divided by a bar known as a reckoning bar. The number and size of beads in each rod make a standard-sized 13-rod soroban much less bulky than a standard-sized suanpan of similar expressive power.

The number of rods in a soroban is always odd and never fewer than seven. Basic models usually have thirteen rods, but the number of rods on practical or standard models often increases to 21, 23, 27 or even 31, thus allowing calculation of more digits or representations of several different numbers at the same time. Each rod represents a digit, and a larger number of rods allows the representation of more digits, either in singular form or during operations.

The beads and rods are made of a variety of different materials. Most soroban made in Japan are made of wood and have wood, metal, rattan, or bamboo rods for the beads to slide on. The beads themselves are usually biconal (shaped like a double-cone). They are normally made of wood, although the beads of some soroban, especially those made outside Japan, can be marble, stone, or even plastic. The cost of a soroban is commensurate with the materials used in its construction.

One unique feature that sets the soroban apart from its Chinese cousin is a dot marking every third rod in a soroban. These are &quot;unit rods&quot; and any one of them is designated to denote the last digit of the whole number part of the calculation answer. Any number that is represented on rods to the right of this designated rod is part of the decimal part of the answer, unless the number is part of a division or multiplication calculation. Unit rods to the left of the designated one also aid in place value by denoting the groups in the number (such as thousands, millions, etc.). Suanpan usually do not have this feature.

==Usage==

===Representation of numbers===

The soroban uses a bi-quinary coded decimal system, where each of the rods can represent a single digit from 0 to 9. By moving beads towards the reckoning bar, they are put in the &quot;on&quot; position; i.e., they assume value. For the &quot;five bead&quot; this means it is moved downwards, while &quot;one beads&quot; are moved upwards. In this manner, all digits from 0 to 9 can be represented by different configurations of beads, as shown below:

These digits can subsequently be used to represent multiple-digit numbers. This is done in the same way as in Western, decimal notation: the rightmost digit represents units, the one to the left of it represents tens, etc. The number &quot;8036&quot;, for instance, is represented by the following configuration:

The soroban user is free to choose which rod is used for the units; typically this will be one of the rods marked with a dot (see the 6 in the example above). Any digits to the right of the units represent decimals: tenths, hundredths, etc. In order to change &quot;8036&quot; into &quot;80.36&quot;, for instance, the user places the digits in such a way that the 0 falls on a rod marked with a dot:

===Methods of operation===
The methods of addition and subtraction on a soroban are basically the same as the equivalent operations on a suanpan, with basic addition and subtraction making use of a complementary number to add or subtract ten in carrying over.

There are many methods to perform both multiplication and division on a soroban, especially Chinese methods that came with the importation of the suanpan. The authority in Japan on the soroban, the Japan Abacus Committee, has recommended so-called standard methods for both multiplication and division which require only the use of the multiplication table. These methods were chosen for efficiency and speed in calculation.

Because the soroban developed through a reduction in the number of beads from seven, to six, and then to the present five, these methods can be used on the suanpan as well as on soroban produced before the 1930s, which have five &quot;one&quot; beads and one &quot;five&quot; bead.

==Modern use==

The Japanese abacus has been taught in school for over 500 years, deeply rooted in the value of learning the fundamentals as a form of art. However, the introduction of the West during the Meiji period and then again after World War II has gradually altered the Japanese education system. Now, the strive is for speed and turning out deliverables rather than understanding the subtle intricacies of the concepts behind the product. Calculators have since replaced sorobans, and elementary schools are no longer required to teach students how to use the soroban, though some do so by choice. The growing popularity of calculators within the context of Japanese modernization has driven the study of soroban from public schools to private after school classrooms. Where once it was an institutionally required subject in school for children grades 2 to 6, current laws have made keeping this art form and perspective on math practiced amongst the younger generations more lenient. Today, it shifted from a given to a game where one can take The Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry&#x27;s examination in order to obtain a certificate and license.

There are six levels of mastery, starting from sixth-grade (very skilled) all the way up to first-grade (for those who have completely mastered the use of the soroban). Those obtaining at least a third-grade certificate/license are qualified to work in public corporations.

The soroban is still taught in some primary schools as a way to visualize and grapple with mathematical concepts. The practice of soroban includes the teacher reciting a string of numbers (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) in a song-like manner where at the end, the answer is given by the teacher. This helps train the ability to follow the tempo given by the teacher while remaining calm and accurate. In this way, it reflects on a fundamental aspect of Japanese culture of practicing meditative repetition in every aspect of life. Primary school students often bring two soroban to class, one with the modern configuration and the one having the older configuration of one heavenly bead and five earth beads.

Shortly after the beginning of one&#x27;s soroban studies, drills to enhance mental calculation, known as in Japanese, are incorporated. Students are asked to solve problems mentally by visualizing the soroban and working out the solution by moving the beads theoretically in one&#x27;s mind. The mastery of anzan is one reason why, despite the access to handheld calculators, some parents still send their children to private tutors to learn the soroban.

The soroban is also the basis for two kinds of abaci developed for the use of blind people. One is the toggle-type abacus wherein flip switches are used instead of beads. The second is the Cranmer abacus which has circular beads, longer rods, and a leather backcover so the beads do not slide around when in use.

==Brief history==
The soroban&#x27;s physical resemblance is derived from the suanpan but the number of beads is identical to the Roman abacus, which had four beads below and one at the top.

Most historians on the soroban agree that it has its roots on the suanpan&#x27;s importation to Japan via the Korean peninsula around the 14th century. When the suanpan first became native to Japan as the soroban (with its beads modified for ease of use), it had two heavenly beads and five earth beads. But the soroban was not widely used until the 17th century, although it was in use by Japanese merchants since its introduction. Once the soroban became popularly known, several Japanese mathematicians, including Seki Kōwa, studied it extensively. These studies became evident on the improvements on the soroban itself and the operations used on it.

In the construction of the soroban itself, the number of beads had begun to decrease. In around 1850, one heavenly bead was removed from the suanpan configuration of two heavenly beads and five earth beads. This new Japanese configuration existed concurrently with the suanpan until the start of the Meiji era, after which the suanpan fell completely out of use. In 1891, Irie Garyū further removed one earth bead, forming the modern configuration of one heavenly bead and four earth beads. This configuration was later reintroduced in 1930 and became popular in the 1940s.

Also, when the suanpan was imported to Japan, it came along with its division table. The method of using the table was called in Japanese, while the table itself was called the . The division table used along with the suanpan was more popular because of the original hexadecimal configuration of Japanese currency . But because using the division table was complicated and it should be remembered along with the multiplication table, it soon fell out in 1935 (soon after the soroban&#x27;s present form was reintroduced in 1930), with a so-called standard method replacing the use of the division table. This standard method of division, recommended today by the Japan Abacus Committee, is in fact an old method which used counting rods, first suggested by mathematician Momokawa Chubei in 1645, and therefore had to compete with the division table during the latter&#x27;s heyday.
==Comparison with the electric calculator==
On November 11, 1946, a contest was held in Tokyo between the Japanese soroban, used by Kiyoshi Matsuzaki, and an electric calculator, operated by US Army Private Thomas Nathan Wood. The basis for scoring in the contest was speed and accuracy of results in all four basic arithmetic operations and a problem which combines all four. The soroban won 4 to 1, with the electric calculator prevailing in multiplication.

About the event, the &quot;Nippon Times&quot; newspaper reported that &quot;Civilization ... tottered&quot; that day, while the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; newspaper described the soroban&#x27;s &quot;decisive&quot; victory as an event in which &quot;the machine age took a step backward...&quot;.

The breakdown of results is as follows:
*Five additions problems for each heat, each problem consisting of 50 three- to six-digit numbers. The soroban won in two successive heats.
*Five subtraction problems for each heat, each problem having six- to eight-digit minuends and subtrahends. The soroban won in the first and third heats; the second heat was a no contest.
*Five multiplication problems, each problem having five- to 12-digit factors. The calculator won in the first and third heats; the soroban won on the second.
*Five division problems, each problem having five- to 12-digit dividends and divisors. The soroban won in the first and third heats; the calculator won on the second.
*A composite problem which the soroban answered correctly and won on this round. It consisted of:
**An addition problem involving 30 six-digit numbers
**Three subtraction problems, each with two six-digit numbers
**Three multiplication problems, each with two figures containing a total of five to twelve digits
**Three division problems, each with two figures containing a total of five to twelve digits

<text>Daylight is a 1996 American disaster film directed by Rob Cohen and starring Sylvester Stallone, Amy Brenneman, Viggo Mortensen, Dan Hedaya, Stan Shaw, Jay O. Sanders, Karen Young and Danielle Harris. Its plot concerns a group of people attempting to find their way out of an underground tunnel in Manhattan, after explosions cause both ends of the tunnel to collapse.

&quot;Daylight&quot; was released by Universal Pictures on December 6, 1996, in the United States, and on December 26 in the United Kingdom. It received mixed reviews and grossed $159 million worldwide.

==Plot==
In upstate New York, a waste management firm loads barrels of toxic waste onto trucks to illegally dispose of them at a site in New Jersey. They head into a tunnel beneath the Hudson River along with several commuters, including struggling playwright Maddy Thompson, a bus of juvenile offenders, a vacationing family, an elderly couple with a dog, and athlete Roy Nord. Meanwhile, a gang grabs gems from a gem buyer after mugging him and takes his car to escape the NYPD by racing into the tunnel. The gang force reach the north tube traffic where the driver loses control and smashes through a security booth and into one of the trucks, causing it to detonate, and resulting in a sympathetic detonation of the remaining trucks. The tunnel entrances cave in, and a fireball sweeps through the tunnel, incinerating most of the motorists within it.

About to enter the Manhattan end of the tunnel, former New York City Emergency Medical Services Chief Kit Latura, now working as a taxi driver, witnesses the fireball erupting from the entrance. While racing to help whomever he can, he runs into an old EMS colleague who says that the damaged tunnel could collapse if any wrong moves are made. Most of the old exits have been sealed off or are considered unsafe. Kit enters the tunnel through the ventilation system, risking his life as the fans can only be slowed down for a short time.

Survivors band around Nord, who believes that he can exit through the mid-river passage, a service corridor running between the north and south tubes. Kit arrives and warns Nord that the passage could soon come down, but Nord dismisses the possibility. Kit escapes as the passage collapses, killing Nord and causing another explosion which kills a juvenile offender.

Water begins seeping in from the river above, and Kit uses an explosive to stop the leak. Police officer George Tyrell returns from investigating the Manhattan end and is crushed under a truck as the road shifts. The group frees him before he can drown, but he is left with a broken neck. The water level continues to rise, and the angry survivors confront Kit. He claims that he can slow it down but not stop it, as the clean-up effort on the Manhattan side of the tunnel is causing water to enter their side. There are sleeping quarters beside the tunnels (leftover from the tunnel&#x27;s construction), and Kit asks George how to access them. Kit finds one by swimming under a security booth and leads the group to this area, but George has to be left behind. He gives Kit a bracelet intended for his girlfriend Grace.

Elderly survivor Eleanor is distressed that her late son&#x27;s dog Cooper is missing. She refuses to go on, then passes away, presumably from hypothermia. The group moves to another room as the first one floods, convincing Eleanor&#x27;s husband Roger to come with them. As they reach the top of an old wooden staircase, Kit notices Cooper swimming in the water below and dives down to rescue him, passing him up to a survivor, but a beam falls and destroys the lower half, sending Kit into the water. Maddy tries to help Kit up, but she falls as well, as more of the staircase is knocked down. Kit orders the rest of the group to leave. The majority of the group escape through a manhole into daylight while the corridor caves in behind them, leaving Kit and Maddy behind in the rising water.

Kit and Maddy swim around looking for an exit, with the main highway tunnel now almost completely submerged. Kit realizes that he will have to use his explosives to cause a &quot;blow out&quot; and rip the tunnel roof open. A mass of mud crushes Kit, and Maddy tries to pull him out. The blast forces Maddy towards the surface, but Kit gets stuck in the mud. Maddy finds a barely conscious Kit and keeps him afloat as a boat discovers them offshore. Lying on a stretcher, Kit sees Grace in the crowd and hands her George&#x27;s bracelet. Maddy insists on riding with him in the ambulance.

The film has a 28% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 43 reviews and an average rating of 4.9 out of 10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;The opening&#x27;s got a great fiery explosion and Stallone puts in another earnest, sympathetic performance, but all else in &quot;Daylight&quot; feels designed to annoy the audience into submission.&quot;

There were, however, some moderate and positive reviews. Roger Ebert gave the film two stars out of four, commenting, &quot;&quot;Daylight&quot; is the cinematic equivalent of a golden oldies station, where you never encounter anything you haven&#x27;t grown to love over the years. At one point, when a trapped civilian asks him if they have a chance, I expected him to say, &#x27;Calm down, lady. I&#x27;ve done this in a dozen other movies.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film four stars out of five, stating, &quot;&quot;Daylight&quot; is great because it never tries to be any more than it is — a disaster movie with all the special-effects hoopla the &#x27;90s can bring.&quot; Randy Edelman&#x27;s musical score was also praised.

Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

About the film, Stallone simply said: &quot;The premise was really good, but it didn&#x27;t deliver&quot;.

===Accolades===
The film won a Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing and was nominated for an Academy Award in the same category (Richard L. Anderson and David A. Whittaker). It was also nominated for two Golden Raspberry Awards, Worst Actor (Sylvester Stallone) and Worst Original Song (&quot;Whenever There Is Love&quot;). For the 1996 Stinkers Bad Movie Awards, Stallone was nominated for Worst Actor too.
The movie was famous for introducing the Panerai special line of watches (Panerai Daylight) by the request of Stallone himself.

==Novelization==
A novelization based on the film by Max Allan Collins titled &quot;Daylight&quot;, was released in 1996.

<text>Robert Wever was an English poet and dramatist of the sixteenth century (&quot;floruit&quot; c. 1550) about whom little biographical information seems to have survived. His name is often given as Richard Wever or simply R. Wever. &quot;An Enterlude called lusty Juventus&quot;, an interlude, attributed to him, was published in 1565.

The poem &quot;In Youth is Pleasure&quot; (In a herber green asleep whereas I lay...), is a popular and remembered anthology piece, has been several times set to music, and supplied the writer and painter Denton Welch with the title of his second novel.

Video Archives closed in 1995, and Tarantino purchased its video inventory and rebuilt the store in his home.

In a 1994 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Tarantino called it &quot;the best video store in the Los Angeles area&quot;, saying &quot;Video Archives is like LA.’s answer to the &quot;Cahiers du Cinéma&quot;&quot;. In 1992, Roger Avary described it as &quot;less a video store than a film school [...] we&#x27;d have these intense, eight-hour-long arguments about cinema. Customers would walk in and they&#x27;d get into it. It became this big clubhouse of film making—and probably the best film-making experience anyone could ever get.&quot;

Video Archives is also the namesake of the Video Archives Cinema Club, the 20-seat micro-cinema at the Tarantino-owned Vista Theatre.

== The Video Archives Podcast with Quentin Tarantino &amp; Roger Avary ==
On July 19, 2022, Tarantino and Avary launched a podcast named after Video Archives called &quot;The Video Archives Podcast with Quentin Tarantino &amp; Roger Avary&quot;, in which they revisit movies from the store and discuss the films. They also discuss the films with producer Gala Avary and guests such as Eli Roth and former employees of Video Archives.

<text>Halfdan the Valiant (&quot;Hálfdan snjalli&quot;) (7th century?) was a legendary Scanian prince, who was the father of Ivar Vidfamne according to &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;, the &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;, &quot;Njal&#x27;s Saga&quot; and &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot;. The genealogical work &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot; gives his father as Harald the Old, his grandfather as Valdar and his great-grandfather as Hróarr (i.e. the Hroðgar of &quot;Beowulf&quot;).

==&quot;Ynglinga saga&quot;==
&quot;Ynglingasaga&quot;, authored by Snorri Sturluson in c. 1230, relates that the Swedish king Ingjald Ill-ruler married his daughter Åsa to king Guðröðr of Scania. Åsa was her father&#x27;s daughter and made Guðröðr murder his own brother Halfdan, the father of Ivar Vidfamne. As it seems, Ivar had to flee Scania after his father&#x27;s death. Later, she was the cause behind Guðröðr&#x27;s death as well, and was forced to escape back to her father. People afterwards called her Åsa Ill-ruler similar to her father Ingjald.

Now Ivar Vidfamne hastily returned to Scania. He mustered a large army and approached Ingjald and his daughter at a place in Svithiod called Ræning. Seeing themselves unable to fight the Scanians, the two committed suicide by burning themselves to death inside the hall. Ivar then subjugated large parts of the Baltic region.

==&quot;Hervarar saga&quot;==
Whereas &quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; does not inform about Halfdan&#x27;s mother, &quot;Hervarar saga&quot; provides the information that she was called Hild, the daughter of the Gothic king Heiðrekr Ulfhamr, the son of Angantyr who defeated the Huns. However, another source, &quot;Hversu Noregr byggdist&quot;, gives the name of Halfdan&#x27;s mother, spouse of Harald the Old, as Hervor, daughter of Heiðrekr.

&quot;Hervarar saga&quot; then tells that Halfdan had the son Ivar Vidfamne, who attacked Ingjald Ill-ruler, which led to Ingjald&#x27;s suicide by burning down his own hall at Ræning together with all his retinue. After this, Ivar Vidfamne conquered Sweden.

==Other sources==
Two other Icelandic 13th-century sources give Halfdan the Valiant an Anglo-Saxon connection. One of the sagas of Olaf Tryggvason says that he was married to Moald Digra, the aunt of a certain Kinrik (Cynric) whose son Olaf became tributary ruler in Northumbria under Halfdan&#x27;s great-great-grandson Sigurd Ring. &quot;Sögubrot&quot;, a fragmentary saga of some legendary Swedish and Danish kings, mentions that Halfdan was the overlord of Northumbria, as were his descendants Ivar Vidfamne and Harald Wartooth after him. In &quot;Sögubrot&quot; Halfdan is compared to &quot;Balder among the Aesir, and all the gods wept [when he perished]&quot;. This is juxtaposed with his warlike and scheming son Ivar who is likened to the Midgard Serpent.
