<text>Wild Swans: Three Daughters of China is a family history that spans a century, recounting the lives of three female generations in China, by Chinese writer Jung Chang. First published in 1991, &quot;Wild Swans&quot; contains the biographies of her grandmother and her mother, then finally her own autobiography. Her grandmother had bound feet and was married off at a young age as the concubine of a high-status warlord. Chang&#x27;s mother rose in status as a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Chang took part in the Cultural Revolution as a member of the Red Guards, but eventually her father was tortured and she was sent to the countryside for thought reform. Later, she earned a scholarship to study in England, where she still lives. 

&quot;Wild Swans&quot; won the 1992 NCR Book Award and the 1993 British Book of the Year. It has been translated into 37 languages and sold over 13 million copies.

== Synopsis ==

===Chang&#x27;s grandmother&#x27;s story===
The book starts by relating the biography of Chang&#x27;s grandmother (Yu-fang). From the age of two, she had bound feet. As the family was relatively poor, her father schemed to have her taken as a concubine to high-ranking warlord general Xue Zhi-heng, in order to gain status, which was hugely important in terms of quality of life. After a wedding ceremony to the general, who already had a wife and many concubines, the young girl was left alone in a wealthy household with servants, and did not see her &quot;husband&quot; again for six years. Despite her luxurious surroundings, life was tense as she feared the servants and the wife of the general would report rumors or outright lies to him. She was allowed to visit her parents&#x27; home, but never allowed to spend the night.

After his six year absence, the general made a brief conjugal visit to Yu-fang, during which Chang&#x27;s mother, was conceived. The general named her Bao Qin, meaning &quot;precious zither,&quot; but did not stay long after her birth. During the child&#x27;s infancy, Yu-fang opposed persistent requests for her to be brought to the general&#x27;s main household, until he became very sick and it was no longer a request. She then had no choice but to comply. During her visit to the household, the general was dying. Since he had no male heir, Bao Qin was very important to the family. Realizing that the general&#x27;s wife would have complete control over her life and her child&#x27;s after the general&#x27;s death, Yu-fang and her daughter returned to her parents&#x27; home, sending false word to Zhi-heng&#x27;s family that the child had passed away. With his last words, the general unexpectedly proclaimed her free at age twenty-four. Eventually, she married a much older doctor (Dr. Xia) with whom she and her daughter, Chang&#x27;s mother, made a home in Jinzhou, Manchuria. &quot;Wild Swans&quot; portrays her role as a wife rather than concubine.

===Chang&#x27;s mother&#x27;s story===
The book now moves to the story of Chang&#x27;s mother (Bao Qin/De-hong), who at the age of fifteen began working for the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Mao Zedong&#x27;s Red Army. As the Chinese Communist Revolution progressed, her work for the CCP helped her rise through the ranks. She met the man who would become Chang&#x27;s father (Wang Yu/Shou-yu), a high-ranking officer. The couple were soon married but CCP dictates meant they were not allowed to spend much time together. Eventually, the couple were transferred to Yibin, Chang&#x27;s father&#x27;s hometown. It was a long and arduous trek. Chang&#x27;s mother traveled on foot because of her rank, while her father rode in a jeep. He was not aware that Chang&#x27;s mother was pregnant. After arrival at Nanjing, Chang&#x27;s mother undertook gruelling military training. After the strain of the training coupled with the journey, she suffered a miscarriage. Chang&#x27;s father swore to never again be inattentive to his wife&#x27;s needs.

In the following years Chang&#x27;s mother gave birth to Jung and four other children. &quot;Wild Swans&quot; shifts again to cover Jung&#x27;s own autobiography.

===Chang&#x27;s story===

The Cultural Revolution started when Chang was a teenager. Chang willingly joined the Red Guards though she recoiled from some of their brutal actions. As Mao&#x27;s personality cult grew, life became more difficult and dangerous. Chang&#x27;s father became a target for the Red Guards when he mildly but openly criticised Mao due to the suffering caused to the Chinese people by the Cultural Revolution. Chang&#x27;s parents were labeled as capitalist roaders and made subjects of public struggle sessions and torture. Chang recalls that her father deteriorated physically and mentally, until his eventual death. Her father&#x27;s treatment prompted Chang&#x27;s previous doubts about Mao to come to the fore. Like thousands of other young people, Chang was sent down to the countryside for education and thought reform by the peasants, a difficult, harsh and pointless experience. At the end of the Cultural Revolution Chang returned home and worked hard to gain a place at university. Not long after she succeeded, Mao died. The whole nation was shocked in mourning, though Chang writes that: &quot;People had been acting for so long they confused it with their true feelings. I wondered how many of the tears were genuine&quot;. Chang said that she felt exhilarated by Mao&#x27;s death.

At university Chang studied English. After her graduation and a stint as an assistant lecturer, she won a scholarship to study in England and left for her new home. She still lives in England today and visits mainland China on occasion to see her family and friends there, with permission from Chinese authorities.

==Reception==

&quot;Wild Swans&quot; was translated into 37 languages and sold 13 million copies, receiving praise from authors such as J. G. Ballard.
Although it has also been translated into Chinese, it is banned in Mainland China. However, the book is available in Hong Kong and Taiwan.

== Adaptations ==
The book was translated for the stage in early 2012, for the Young Vic. The book was adapted by Alexandra Wood and directed by Sacha Wares. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; gave it four out of five stars, and called it &#x27;enormously refreshing&#x27; while &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the production design.

On November 26, 2006, &quot;Variety&quot; announced that Portobello Pictures had purchased the film rights to the book with Christopher Hampton on board to write the screenplay. However, a film adaptation has yet to materialise. In a March 2020 interview with &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, Chang said that there had been &quot;many, many attempts&quot; for a screen adaptation of &quot;Wild Swans&quot; but that &quot;distributors are fearful of getting on the wrong side of the powers that be in China.&quot;

<doc id="921577" wikidata="Q885885" url="?curid=921577" title="Blue Sky Studios">
<text>Blue Sky Studios, Inc. was an American visual effects and computer animation studio, which was active from 1987 to 2021. Headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut, it was founded on February 22, 1987, by Chris Wedge, Michael Ferraro, Carl Ludwig, Alison Brown, David Brown, and Eugene Troubetzkoy after their employer, Mathematical Applications Group (MAGI), one of the visual effects studios behind &quot;Tron&quot; (1982), shut down. Using its in-house rendering software, the studio created visual effects for commercials and films before dedicating itself to animated film production. It produced 13 feature films, the first being &quot;Ice Age&quot; (2002), and the final one being &quot;Spies in Disguise&quot; (2019).

Blue Sky Studios was a subsidiary of 20th Century Animation until its acquisition by the Walt Disney Company, as part of their acquisition of 21st Century Fox assets in 2019. Disney closed down Blue Sky in April 2021 due to the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business operations.

&quot;Ice Age&quot; and &quot;Rio&quot; were the studio&#x27;s most commercially successful franchises, while &quot;Robots&quot; (2005), &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; (2008), &quot;The Peanuts Movie&quot; (2015), and the aforementioned &quot;Spies in Disguise&quot; were among its most critically praised films. Scrat, a character from the &quot;Ice Age&quot; franchise, was the studio&#x27;s mascot.

== History ==
=== 1980–1989: Formation and early computer animation ===
In the late 1970s, Chris Wedge, then an undergraduate at Purchase College studying film, was employed by Mathematical Applications Group, Inc. (MAGI). MAGI was an early computer technology company which produced SynthaVision, a software application that could replicate the laws of physics to measure nuclear radiation rays for U.S. government contracts. At MAGI, Wedge met Eugene Troubetzkoy, who held a Ph.D in theoretical physics and was one of the first computer animators. Using his background in character animation, Wedge helped MAGI produce animation for television commercials, which eventually led to an offer from Walt Disney Productions to produce animation for the film &quot;Tron&quot; (1982). After &quot;Tron&quot;, MAGI hired Carl Ludwig, an electrical engineer, and Mike Ferraro transferred to the film division from the Cad Cam division of MAGI. As MAGI&#x27;s success began to decline, the company employed David Brown from CBS/Fox Video to be a marketing executive and Alison Brown to be a managing producer. After MAGI was sold to Vidmax (Canada), the six individuals—Wedge, Troubetzkoy, Ferraro, Ludwig, David Brown, and Alison Brown—founded Blue Sky Studios in February 1987 to continue the software design and produce computer animation.

At Blue Sky, Ferraro and Ludwig expanded on CGI Studio, the studio programming language they started at MAGI and began using it for animation production. At the time, scanline renderers were prevalent in the computer graphics industry, and they required computer animators and digital artists to add lighting effects in manually; Troubetzkoy and Ludwig adapted MAGI&#x27;s ray tracing, algorithms which simulate the physical properties of light in order to produce lighting effects automatically. To accomplish this, Ludwig examined how light passes through water, ice, and crystal, and programmed those properties into the software. Following the stock market crash of 1987, Blue Sky Studios did not find their first client until about two years later: a company &quot;that wanted their logo animated so it would be seen flying over the ocean in front of a sunset.&quot; In order to receive the commission, Blue Sky spent two days rendering a single frame and submitted it to the prospective client. However, once the client accepted their offer, Blue Sky found that they could not produce the entire animation in time without help from a local graphics studio, which provided them with extra computer processors.

=== 1989–2002: Television commercials, visual effects and &quot;Bunny&quot; ===
Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, Blue Sky Studios concentrated on the production of television commercials and visual effects for film. The studio began by animating commercials that depicted the mechanisms of time-release capsules for pharmaceutical corporations. The studio also produced a Chock Full O&#x27; Nuts commercial with a talking coffee bean and developed the first computer-animated M&amp;M&#x27;s. Using CGI Studio, the studio produced over 200 other commercials for clients such as Chrysler, General Foods, Texaco, Pepsi, and the United States Marines. They made a cartoon bumper for Nicktoons that features an orange blob making a dolphin, a dinosaur, and a walking person.

In 1996, MTV collaborated with Blue Sky Studios on the film &quot;Joe&#x27;s Apartment&quot;, for which Blue Sky animated the insect characters. Other clients included Bell Atlantic, Rayovac, Gillette and Braun. The Braun commercial was awarded a CLIO Award for Advertising. Recalling the award, Ludwig stated that the judges had initially mistaken the commercial as a live action submission as a result of the photorealism of the computer-animated razor. In August 1997, 20th Century Fox&#x27;s Los Angeles-based visual effects company, VIFX, acquired majority interest in Blue Sky Studios to form a new visual effects and animation company, temporarily renamed &quot;Blue Sky/VIFX&quot;. Following the studio&#x27;s expansion, Blue Sky produced character animation for the films &quot;Alien Resurrection&quot; (1997), &quot;A Simple Wish&quot; (1997), &quot;Mouse Hunt&quot; (1997), &quot;Star Trek: Insurrection&quot; (1998) and &quot;Fight Club&quot; (1999), as well as for &quot;The Sopranos&quot; episode &quot;Funhouse&quot;.

Meanwhile, starting in 1990, Wedge had been working on a short film named &quot;Bunny&quot;, intended to demonstrate CGI Studio. The film revolves around a rabbit widow who is irritated by a moth. The moth subsequently leads the rabbit into &quot;a heavenly glow, reuniting her with her husband.&quot; At the time, Wedge had been the thesis advisor for Carlos Saldanha while Saldanha was a graduate student at the School of Visual Arts; Wedge shared storyboard panels for &quot;Bunny&quot; with Saldanha during this time. After Saldanha&#x27;s graduation, Blue Sky Studios hired him as an animator, and he later directed a few commercials. It was not until 1996 when Nina Rappaport, a producer at Blue Sky Studios, assigned Wedge to complete the &quot;Bunny&quot; project, which required CGI Studio to render fur, glass, and metal from multiple light sources, such as a swinging light bulb and an &quot;ethereal cloudscape&quot;. In the initial stages of the &quot;Bunny&quot; project, Ludwig modified CGI Studio to simulate radiosity, which tracks light rays as they reflect off of multiple surfaces. Blue Sky Studios released &quot;Bunny&quot; in 1998, and it received the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. &quot;Bunny&quot;″s success gave Blue Sky Studios the opportunity to produce feature-length films.

=== 2002–2019: Feature films under 20th Century Fox ===

In March 1999, Fox decided to sell VIFX to another visual effects house, Rhythm &amp; Hues Studios, while Blue Sky Studios would remain under Fox. According to Wedge, Fox considered selling Blue Sky as well by 2000 due to financial difficulties in the visual effects industry in general. Instead, Wedge, film producer Lori Forte, and animation executive Chris Meledandri presented Fox with a script for a comedy feature film titled &quot;Ice Age&quot;. Studio management pressured staff to sell their remaining shares and options to Fox on the promise of continued employment on feature-length films. The studio moved to White Plains, New York and started production on &quot;Ice Age&quot;. As the film wrapped, Fox feared that it might bomb at the box office. They terminated half of the production staff and tried unsuccessfully to find a buyer for the film and the studio. Instead, &quot;Ice Age&quot; was released by 20th Century Fox on March 15, 2002, and was a critical and commercial success, receiving a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards in 2003. The film established Blue Sky as the third studio, after Pixar and DreamWorks Animation, to launch a successful CGI franchise.

In January 2009, the studio moved from White Plains to Greenwich, Connecticut, taking advantage of the state&#x27;s 30 percent tax credit and having more space to grow. In April 2017, the studio stated that it intended to stay in Connecticut until 2025.

In 2013, Wedge took a leave of absence to direct Paramount Animation&#x27;s live-action/animated film &quot;Monster Trucks&quot;. He then returned to Blue Sky Studios and worked on multiple projects for the company, such as serving as an executive producer.

=== 2019–2021: Disney acquisition and closure ===
Ownership of Blue Sky Studios was assumed by The Walt Disney Company as part of their acquisition of 21st Century Fox, which concluded on March 20, 2019. On March 21, Disney announced that Blue Sky Studios and its parent company 20th Century Fox Animation (now 20th Century Animation) would be integrated as units within the Walt Disney Studios with co-presidents Andrea Miloro and Robert Baird continuing to lead the studio, while reporting to Walt Disney Studios chairman Alan Horn. In July 2019, Miloro announced that she would be stepping down from her role as co-president, thus leaving Baird as sole president.

In August 2019, former Walt Disney Animation Studios head Andrew Millstein was named as co-president of Blue Sky Studios alongside Baird, while Pixar Animation Studios president Jim Morris also took a supervising role.

&quot;Spies in Disguise&quot; was released by 20th Century Fox on December 25, 2019. It ended up as the final feature film released under the Blue Sky name, and the only feature film produced by Blue Sky that Disney released.

On February 9, 2021, Disney announced that it was closing Blue Sky Studios in April 2021. A spokesperson for the company explained that in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic&#x27;s continued economic impact on all of its businesses, it was no longer sustainable for them to run a third feature animation studio. In addition, production on a film adaptation of the webcomic &quot;Nimona&quot;, originally scheduled to be released on January 14, 2022, was cancelled as a result of its closure. The studio&#x27;s film library and intellectual properties are retained by Disney. Although Disney did not give an exact date as to when the studio would be closing down initially, former animator Rick Fournier confirmed on April 10 it was their last day of operation, three days after co-founder Chris Wedge released a farewell letter on social media.

As of June 19, 2021, Blue Sky Studios&#x27; website now redirects to Disney.com.

===2021–present: Aftermath===
On May 4, 2021, fan site Disney Television Animation News reported that it was rumored that a short series produced by Blue Sky known as &quot;Scrat Tales&quot; would be coming to Disney+. The series would follow the titular Scrat, who discovers that he has a son. Footage of the series was later leaked onto YouTube, with former Blue Sky animators revealing that the series would be coming to Disney+ in 2022 after &quot;The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild&quot;. On February 22, 2022, Disney officially announced the series, with a release date for April 13, 2022.

A spin-off film in the &quot;Ice Age&quot; franchise, titled &quot;The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild&quot;, was produced by Walt Disney Pictures, and without the involvement of Blue Sky Studios. Although Blue Sky was not involved with the film before closure, the film was originally produced by 20th Century Studios and 20th Century Animation before being moved to Walt Disney Pictures during production for unknown reasons. It was animated by Canadian animation studio Bardel Entertainment and was released on Disney+ on January 28, 2022, to generally negative reviews from critics.

Additionally, in January 2022, a third film in the &quot;Rio&quot; franchise was revealed to be in development for Disney+.

Days after the release of &quot;The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild&quot;, it was reported that Disney had lost the rights of Scrat to fashion designer and artist Ivy Supersonic. She was said to have originally created Scrat under the name &quot;Sqrat&quot; and pitched the character to Fox, only to get turned down by the studio. Supersonic claims the studio&#x27;s own documents actually identified the character in &quot;Ice Age&quot; as &quot;Sqrat&quot;, though her creation was not saber-toothed. Supersonic was offered a $300,000 settlement by Fox, but she turned it down and subsequently lost in court. The case later went to appeal (Case # 04401 Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, NYC). Supersonic still had hopes of receiving damages for her claimed infringement, later winning a partial summary judgment from the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board in a reverse suit, Fox Entertainment Group and Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation v. Ivy Silberstein (her real name), in which Fox had tried to prevent her from registering the trademark &quot;SQRAT&quot;. Rumors originally circulated in 2020 that Disney lost the rights to the character following the trademark dispute and later circulated as Scrat was not featured in &quot;The Ice Age Adventures of Buck Wild&quot;. However, after the unveiling of &quot;Scrat Tales&quot;, it was revealed that Disney did not lose the rights to Scrat.

In March 2022, amid the controversy of Disney&#x27;s involvement in Florida House Bill 1557, referred to by some as the &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Gay&quot; bill, and lack of criticism from CEO Bob Chapek until after the bill had passed, &quot;Insider&quot; reported that three former Blue Sky staff members stated &quot;Nimona&quot; received pushback from Disney leadership in mid-2020, centered around the film&#x27;s LGBT themes and a same-sex kiss. Initially, Blue Sky leadership removed the same-sex kiss from &quot;presentations to Disney, despite hoping to ultimately include it in the film, the sources said. [...] Blue Sky leadership eventually showed reels to staffers that included the kiss, the sources said, but the studio was shut down soon after&quot;. &quot;Nimona&quot; was picked up by Annapurna Pictures on April 11, 2022, with DNEG Animation taking over production, for release on Netflix on June 30, 2023.

&quot;Ice Age: Scrat Tales&quot;, the last official Blue Sky production, was released as scheduled on April 13, 2022. The final episode of the series, &quot;Nut The End&quot;, concluded its ending credits with a parting message from the company:

Scrat was the first character to appear in Blue Sky&#x27;s first movie, &quot;Ice Age&quot;.&lt;br&gt;Like him, we were reaching for something that might have been unattainable.&lt;br&gt;Yet time after time both we and Scrat have managed to&lt;br&gt;get our arms around versions of that elusive acorn.

Unfortunately it&#x27;s not possible to hold on to anything forever.

We&#x27;ve had more fun bringing our movies to life than anyone should be allowed.&lt;br&gt;We hope you&#x27;ve been able to feel some of that joy.

Thank you, from the bottom of our Blue Sky collective hearts,&lt;br&gt;for being with us all those years.

On the same day, a short video was uploaded to YouTube by an unlisted channel known as Finale, titled &quot;The End&quot;, which featured Scrat finally capturing his acorn and eating it before scurrying away. The description revealed this was the final piece of animation made by Blue Sky Studios, done in their final days of operation by a small team of artists as &quot;a farewell, a send-off, on our own terms.&quot;

<text>The TKS spacecraft (, , &quot;Transport Supply Spacecraft&quot;, GRAU index 11F72) was a Soviet spacecraft conceived in the late 1960s for resupply flights to the military Almaz space station.

The spacecraft was designed for both crewed and autonomous uncrewed cargo resupply flights, but was never used operationally in its intended role – only four test missions were flown (including three that docked to Salyut space stations) during the program. The Functional Cargo Block (FGB) of the TKS spacecraft later formed the basis of several space station modules, including the Zarya FGB module on the International Space Station.

The TKS spacecraft consisted of two spacecraft mated together, both of which could operate independently:
* The [[VA spacecraft]] (known mistakenly in the West as the &quot;Merkur spacecraft&quot;), which would have housed the cosmonauts during launch and reentry of a TKS spacecraft, while traveling to and from an Almaz space station. 
* And the [[Functional Cargo Block]] (FGB) which, in order to resupply an Almaz space station, carried docking hardware, tanks, and a large pressurized cargo compartment. Furthermore, the FGB carried the on-orbit maneuvering engines for the TKS.

While the VA carried the reentry hardware, and only minimal life support and maneuvering systems, the FGB would have been used as the primary orbital maneuvering system and cargo storage for the TKS spacecraft.

The FGB could also be used alone as an uncrewed cargo module without a VA spacecraft, which enabled the FGB design to be re-purposed as FGB space station modules later on. The VA spacecraft, on the other hand, was also intended to be launched as &quot;Almaz APOS&quot;, mated with an Almaz-OPS space station core as the primary orbital maneuvering system, instead of an FGB.

In the 2010s, Excalibur Almaz planned to use old VA capsules as low-cost cargo return vehicles. However, the company ultimately sold much of their equipment and announced that the remainder was to become an educational exhibit.

== Design ==

The TKS spacecraft was designed by Vladimir Chelomei (the VA capsule) and V. N. Bugayskiy (the FGB block) as a crewed spacecraft launched with Proton rocket alternative to the Soyuz spacecraft for use with &quot;Almaz&quot; space stations. Development began in 1965; the &quot;Almaz programme&quot; had been abandoned by the time the first TKS spacecraft flew in 1977.
The VA spacecraft (&quot;Vozvrashaemiy Apparat&quot;) was flown separately on four test missions with two craft per launch to test the design, as well as one &quot;all-up&quot; test mission and three resupply missions.

The project had further evolved with space station &quot;Modulny&quot; (&quot;Modular&quot;) based on the TKS design outline, reworked to dock with Salyut 7, Mir and ISS space stations. This development was designated FGB, or Functional Cargo Block.

The TKS spacecraft consisted of an 11F74 &quot;Vozvraschaemyi Apparat&quot; (or &quot;Return Vehicle&quot; commonly referred to as the VA), attached to an 11F77 &quot;Transportniy Korabl Snabzheniya&quot; (&quot;Functional/Cargo Block&quot; module or FGB).

=== TKS VA ===

The TKS VA spacecraft was itself a very compact and efficient spacecraft. Typically it would reenter the atmosphere within 2 orbits, but could fly autonomously for up to 31 hours. The pressurized crew re-entry capsule was equipped with its own environmental control system, and topped with reaction control system, de-orbit braking engine, parachute system, and soft landing engines. Although extensively flight tested, it never flew with a crew on board.

The VA design was derived from the planned capsule for the Chelomei&#x27;s LK-1 crewed circumlunar spacecraft of the 1960s. It was also the basis for Chelomei&#x27;s LK-700 Lunar Lander crew capsule. The VA looked somewhat similar to the Apollo capsule, but was 30% smaller than its NASA counterpart.

=== TKS FGB ===

The FGB was entered from the VA spacecraft via a short tunnel. At the aft end a pilot station was equipped with controls and windows for manual docking with the Almaz space station. The docking port was also located here. Operational TKS spacecraft would have delivered KSI film return capsules to Almaz stations. These would have been stored around the docking port for transfer to the film capsule airlock for loading.

== Missions ==

===VA spacecraft test flights===

Four flights with eight VA spacecraft without an FGB module were conducted to speed up the development of the TKS spacecraft:
* Orbital test of a pair of two VA spacecraft Kosmos 881 and Kosmos 882 in 1976-12-15 that started jointly and reentered on the same day.
* VA #009L/P and VA #009P/P: Launched on 1977-08-04. Launch vehicle failure forty seconds into the flight on a suborbital test of two VA spacecraft. VA #009L/P is destroyed in the resulting booster explosion, VA #009P/P is rescued by the Proton SAS abort system and is recovered safely.
* On 1978-03-30 pair of two VA spacecraft Kosmos 997 and Kosmos 998 started jointly and reentered separately
* On 1979-05-23 pair of two VA spacecraft Kosmos 1100 and Kosmos 1101 that started jointly and reentered separately

=== TKS-1 (Kosmos 929) ===

Kosmos 929 was the first flight of a &quot;complete&quot; TKS spacecraft (VA spacecraft with FGB), launched on 17 July 1977 – it was a &quot;solo&quot; test flight and was not destined for a Salyut space station. The VA capsule returned to Earth 16 August 1977. The remainder of the spacecraft – the FGB – deorbited on 2 February 1978.

=== TKS-2 (Kosmos 1267) ===

On 25 April 1981, TKS-2 was launched uncrewed as Kosmos 1267, the first FGB to dock with a space station. After separation and recovery of the VA capsule on 24 May 1981, the FGB docked on 19 June with Salyut 6, after 57 days of autonomous flight. It remained attached to the station until both deorbited and were destroyed on 29 July 1982.

=== TKS-3 (Kosmos 1443) ===

On 2 March 1983, TKS-3 was launched uncrewed as Kosmos 1443. This time, the VA remained attached and the first &quot;complete&quot; TKS docked to Salyut 7 two days after launch. TKS-3 separated from the station on 14 August. After undocking, the FGB and the VA spacecraft separated and the VA spacecraft continued in space for four more days demonstrating autonomous flight, before the VA capsule successfully re-entered on 23 August 1983, landing 100 km south-east of Aralsk and returning 350 kg of material from the station. The FGB deorbited itself on 19 September 1983.

=== TKS-4 (Kosmos 1686) ===
TKS-4 was launched uncrewed as Kosmos 1686 on 27 September 1985. The landing systems, ECS, seats, and crewed controls were removed from the VA spacecraft, and instead other payload was installed: a high-resolution photo apparatus, an infrared telescope and the &quot;Ozon&quot; spectrometer. The TKS successfully docked with Salyut 7.

The &quot;military&quot; long-duration crew Salyut 7 EO-4, consisting of Viktor Savinykh, Alexander Volkov and the commander Vladimir Vasyutin, had crewed Salyut 7 that month to conduct experiments with TKS-4. Commander Vasyutin fell ill soon after arriving at the station.
Originally scheduled to have a six-month stay aboard Salyut 7, Vasyutin&#x27;s illness forced the crew to make an emergency return to Earth on 21 November 1985, preventing the crew from finishing the TKS experiments.
The crew of Soyuz T-15 returned to Salyut 7 in May 1986, to conclude some of the experiments and ferry equipment to the then new Mir space station.

Salyut 7 was moved to a higher orbit after that mission, while awaiting another &quot;TKS&quot; crew – there were even plans to return using the Buran shuttle. Such flights never materialized before Salyut 7 and Kosmos 1686 deorbited on 7 February 1991, burning up together over Argentina.

== Further usage ==

The TKS design, which has never been flown crewed, has gone on to provide the basic structure for several later space-station components, such as:
* Kvant-1 tug
* Kvant-2 Mir module
* Kristall Mir module
* Spektr Mir module
* Priroda Mir module
* Polyus (FGB) spacecraft
* Zarya (FGB-1) ISS module
* Russian Research Module (FGB-2) ISS module (canceled)
* Nauka (FGB-2) ISS module

Two TKS/Almaz VA capsules were bought for commercial use by the private spaceflight company Excalibur Almaz. As of 2014, one of those were auctioned for 1 million euro, and the other was reportedly shipped away from the company&#x27;s headquarters on Isle of Man in an undisclosed direction.

==Existing hardware==
Some VA capsules are on display in museums or in storage.

<text>Scott Jennings (born ), also known as Lum the Mad, is an American commentator on MMORPG games. He is best known for creating a website, &quot;The Rantings of Lum The Mad&quot;, a pioneer blog, which existed from 1998 to 2001, when Jennings was hired by MMO developer Mythic Entertainment, where he remained until 2006.

==Biography==
Jennings was born c. 1966, and began gaming at the age of 10, when he began playing &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. He created his first website to post tips and tricks about the 1996 game &quot;The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall&quot;. Around 1998/1999, his focus shifted to &quot;Ultima Online&quot; (UO), an early graphical MMO first released in 1997, and one of the first to become well known in popular culture. Jennings, whose primary career was as a database programmer, became a respected critic of UO, as he posted detailed critiques of the game. Jennings&#x27;s strong views on &quot;macroing&quot; – the practice of automating aspects of the game, effectively making it easier – made him very popular with some UO players. As noted by game researcher Edward Castronova, this was an early example of a site where a game&#x27;s designers had strong opposition from certain players, who would use their websites to actively critique a game&#x27;s development. Jennings&#x27; writing was characterized by a mixture of humor and vitriolic anger, and his posts were known to readers as &quot;rants&quot;. The site became frequented by both fans and haters of UO, along with some of UO&#x27;s developers and personnel, as well as developers of competitor games.

With the 1999 release of a competitor to UO, &quot;EverQuest&quot;, Jennings expanded his writing to the new game. His early analysis of EQ focused on its differences to UO. However, he went on to criticize EverQuest directly. Jennings argued that the game forced players to spend long periods of time to gain very little, and that this was not fun. He also argued that the game consisted of fighting the same monsters repeatedly. He offered several examples of player greed, in his view, damaging the experience of the game for other players. Other issues he covered included &quot;squatting&quot; by large guilds, class balance, real-money trading, server lag, &quot;raiding&quot; as an end-game, and the later expansions&#x27; lack of finished and working content.

Jennings continued to write about a number of other MMORPGs as they were released, including &quot;Asheron&#x27;s Call&quot; and &quot;Anarchy Online&quot;. His later works became even more elaborate, such as a mock-up event for &quot;Shadowbane&quot; created entirely with &quot;Warcraft II: Tides of Darkness&quot; sprites. Instead of the usual review article for &quot;World War II Online&quot;, he posted a long, profane and amusing chatlog of him testing the game offline, in which he proclaimed, &quot;I WILL TAXI TO VICTORY!&quot;, a phrase which became a favorite among his fans.

Jennings&#x27; website attracted many well-known MMORPG staff and developers who took part in discussions on the forums. These included Richard Garriott, Raph Koster, and Mark Jacobs. Discussions often centered around the very virtual worlds they built, with much input from the community, both constructive and negative.

In 2001, when Jennings lost his job due to the dot-com crash, he was hired as a database programmer by Jacobs&#x27; company, Mythic Entertainment, makers of &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot;. He developed the Camelot Herald.

Once he began working for Mythic, Jennings decided he could not continue writing for his Lum the Mad site. It subsequently had its name changed to slownewsday.net and was maintained by volunteers for a time, but eventually closed.

Also in 2001, Jennings started a new blog, &quot;Broken Toys&quot;, which he infrequently updates about random subjects sometimes but not always relating to online gaming. Work from previous blogs is hosted in a separate archive.

In 2005, Jennings published the book &quot;Massively Multiplayer Games for Dummies&quot;.

On February 17, 2006, Jennings left Mythic and began working at another MMO company, NCsoft in Austin, Texas.

August 13, 2008 was Jennings&#x27; last day at NCsoft, having been let go as part of corporate refocusing. According to his blog, Jennings will begin working on a game called Webwars with John Galt Games.

In 2010 Jennings returned to NCsoft, first as a contract developer and then as a full-time employee. His employment with NCsoft ended in September, 2012.

He was employed at Portalarium until Jun 20, 2018.

==Personal life==

Around 1995, Jennings married. He and his wife Pat have a son, Robert.

==Origin of name==

Lum the Mad was the name of Jennings&#x27;s &quot;Ultima Online&quot; characters. The original &quot;Lum the Mad&quot; was a character in the Greyhawk campaign setting for Dungeons &amp; Dragons and was previously mentioned in the 2nd edition Advanced Dungeons and Dragons book &quot;The Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; in the artifact section referring to &quot;The Machine of Lum the Mad&quot;.

In the game Baldur&#x27;s Gate II: Throne of Bhaal, there is a machine built by one &quot;Lum the Mad&quot;. This is an artifact originally described in the 1st Edition Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide. In the computer game this machine is found on the fourth level of the dungeon called &quot;Watcher&#x27;s Keep.&quot;

Lum the Mad is also referenced briefly at the finale of .

<text>The PZL TS-8 &quot;Bies&quot; (Devil) is a Polish trainer aircraft, used from 1957 to the 1970s by the Polish Air Force and civilian aviation.

==Development==
The aircraft was designed in response to a Polish Air Force requirement for a modern piston-engined trainer with a retractable tricycle landing gear to replace Junak 3 and Yak-11 aircraft. The main designer was Tadeusz Sołtyk – hence the designation letters TS. The plane was named &quot;Bies&quot; – a folk name for the devil. Work started in 1953 and the first prototype was flown on July 23, 1955. In 1956 and 1957 it beat three international records in its class. The second prototype was shown at the Paris Air Show in 1957.

In 1957 the first experimental series of 10 aircraft was produced by WSK-Okecie (designated as TS-8 BI). A slightly improved main variant, designated as the TS-8 BII, was produced from 1958 to 1960 by WSK Mielec. The last 10 machines, TS-8 BIII, were built with better avionics, in total 251 TS-8 were produced of which 229 were the TS-8 BII variant.

The TS-8 had good handling and performance; a noisy engine being one of its few flaws. It was the first really modern aircraft designed in Poland after the war, that also used a Polish engine.

==Design==
The TS-8 was an all-metal low-wing cantilever monoplane, with metal-covered semi-monocoque fuselage, oval in cross-section. The three-part single-spar wing, of semi-monocoque design, creating a transverse inverted gull wing &quot;W&quot; shape. It had a Tricycle retractable landing gear, and a 7-cylinder WN-3 radial engine in front, delivering 330 hp take-off power and 283 hp normal power to a 2.2 m diameter two-blade variable pitch wooden propeller.

The crew of two, sat in a tandem enclosed cockpit, with twin controls, the student in front with the instructor in the rear. Canopy sections above the crewmen slid rearwards.

The plane had no armament, except for the experimental series TS-8 BI, which had one 12.7mm machine gun and two small bomb pylons.

==Operational history==
The TS-8s began to be withdrawn from Polish Air Force service in the mid-1960s, being replaced by PZL TS-11 Iskra jet trainers. Over 100 withdrawn aircraft were handed over to the civilian aviation (aero clubs). Most TS-8s were finally withdrawn from civilian aviation by 1978, with three currently remaining airworthy. Two TS-8s were used by Indonesia.

<text>Walter Thomas John McKechnie (born June 19, 1947) is a Canadian former professional hockey centre. He played for nine teams in the National Hockey League (NHL) and four minor professional teams over a 17-year pro career. Being drafted sixth overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1963 NHL amateur draft, he is the franchise&#x27;s first ever draft pick. 

==Playing career==
McKechnie was drafted sixth overall by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1963 NHL amateur draft of 16-year-old players. He played junior hockey with the London Nationals from 1965 to 1967 before turning professional with the Phoenix Roadrunners of the Western Hockey League (WHL) in the 1967–68 season, where he was named the league&#x27;s rookie of the year. In February 1968, he was acquired by the expansion Minnesota North Stars and played four games in the NHL regular season followed by nine playoff games. For the next three years, he split his time between the North Stars and their minor league affiliates.

In May 1971, McKechnie was traded to the California Golden Seals and received a lot of ice time over his three years with the team, scoring 23 goals and 52 points in the 1973–74 season. In June 1974, he was involved in a three-way trade using the intra-league draft where he was claimed by the New York Rangers and immediately sent to the Boston Bruins for Derek Sanderson. He struggled with the Bruins and was dealt mid-season to the Detroit Red Wings. The next year in Detroit, he put up what would be his NHL career-high numbers, with 26 goals and 82 points, leading the team in scoring. McKechnie followed that a 25-goal season in 1976–77. After the season, he played for Team Canada in the 1977 World Ice Hockey Championships.

Before the next season, McKechnie was traded to the Washington Capitals. He got off to a poor start in Washington and was traded to the Cleveland Barons in December 1977. McKechnie became the property of the Minnesota North Stars when the Barons and North Stars franchises were merged following the 1977–78 season. He was traded to the Toronto Maple Leafs prior to the 1978–79 season, where he scored 25 goals. His goal production dropped the next year, and McKechnie was traded to the Colorado Rockies, where he continued to struggle. He was signed as a free agent by the Red Wings in 1981 and rebounded with an 18-goal season, followed by 14 goals in 1982–83. McKechnie spent the 1983–84 season in the Central Hockey League (CHL) with the Salt Lake Golden Eagles and then retired at age 37. In 955 career NHL games, he scored 214 goals and 392 assists for 606 points.

==Personal==
McKechnie was a regular at The Strand Billiards in London while playing for the Ontario Hockey Association&#x27;s London Nationals during the mid-1960s. The pool hall, owned by the late Len Bonk since it first opened in 1952 and closed in September 2005, was like a second home to McKechnie, who refers to The Strand as &quot;the academy.&quot;

From 1986 to 2009 he owned and operated &quot;McKeck&#x27;s&quot;, a family-style restaurant on Highland Street in Haliburton, Ontario. He has retired from that business, but the restaurant still operates under the same name. In 2009, McKechnie was inducted into the London Sports Hall of Fame.

Most recently his efforts are directed at fundraising for Prostate Cancer Canada.

McKechnie was elected to Dysart et al municipal council in 2010, and was acclaimed as the municipality&#x27;s deputy mayor in the 2022 municipal elections.

<doc id="921601" wikidata="Q6942287" url="?curid=921601" title="Music of Tahiti">
<text>Prior to the arrival of Europeans, the music of [[Tahiti]] was dominated by festivals called &quot;heiva&quot;. Dancing was a vital part of Tahitian life then, and dances were used to celebrate, pray and mark almost every occasion of life. Examples include the men&#x27;s ʻōteʻa dance and the couple&#x27;s &#x27;upaʻupa.

Professional dance troupes called ʻarioi were common, and they moved around the various islands and communities dancing highly sensually and erotically. In the early 19th century, however, colonial laws severely restricted these and other dances, which were considered immoral. Herman Melville celebrated one such dance (he called it the &#x27;lori-lori&#x27;) for its sensuality. They were replaced instead by genres of Christian music such as himene tarava. The word &#x27;himene&#x27; is derived from the English word &#x27;hymn&#x27; (Tahiti was first colonized by the English). Likewise, the harmonies and tune characteristics / &#x27;strophe patterns&#x27; of much of the music of Polynesia is western in style and derived originally from missionary influence via hymns and other church music.

One unique quality of Polynesian music is the use of the sustained 6th chord in vocal music, though typically the 6th chord is not used in religious music. Traditional instruments include a conch-shell called the pu and a nose flute called the vivo, as well as numerous kinds of drums made from hollowed-out tree trunks and dog or shark skin.

===Explanation of the novel&#x27;s title===

The name Tin Woodman is derived from &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; Tin Woodman character. The name is used as a euphemism for the alien, the subject of the novel, who like the Woodman seeks happiness by having its heart restored.

==Adaptations==

Bischoff and Bailey based this novel on their short story of the same name, which was nominated for a Nebula Award in 1977.

This book was adapted into a &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode, &quot;Tin Man&quot;, also written by Bischoff &amp; Bailey. The core story comes from the novel, but the novel itself was not associated with the Star Trek universe. Many changes had to be made to adapt the story into the Star Trek universe, such as the characterization of the crew, and the book&#x27;s ending.

<text>Semiha Berksoy (24 May 1910 – 15 August 2004) was a Turkish opera singer and painter. 

==Early life==
Semiha Berksoy was born in Çengelköy, Istanbul on 25 May 1910. Her mother was a painter, her father a poet and accountant. Semiha Berksoy studied music and the visual arts at Istanbul Conservatory.

==Career==
Berksoy started her acting career with the role of &quot;Semiha&quot; in the first Turkish sound movie &quot;İstanbul Sokaklarında&quot; directed by Muhsin Ertuğrul in 1931. She was cast in operettas in Istanbul theaters early in her career. She sang in the first Turkish opera &quot;Özsoy&quot; in 1934 (commissioned by Kemal Atatürk, composed by Adnan Saygun). She was honoured as the First Turkish Opera Singer and rewarded with the opportunity to go to Berlin Music Academy for further training. She started her international singing career in 1934, performing in Turkey, Germany and Portugal, becoming known as a Wagnerian soprano.

In 1939, for the 75th birthday of Richard Strauss in Berlin, she sang the role of &quot;Ariadne&quot; in &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot;, becoming the first Turkish prima donna to perform on stage in Europe. Back in Turkey, she worked with Carl Ebert helping him in his efforts to create the Turkish State Opera and Ballet. This initiative lead to the creation of the Experimental Stage of the Ankara State Conservatory in 1940.

Berksoy retired from the Istanbul Opera in 1972. She was decorated with the &quot;Atatürk Opera Award&quot; at the 50th anniversary ceremony commemorating the introduction of women&#x27;s rights to vote and to be elected. She received the title of &quot;State Artist&quot; in Turkey in 1998. Following her retirement, she remained active mostly as a theater artist.

Her paintings, frequently showing a small girl in a representation of herself, were also well known.

At the age of 90, she appeared in a dramatic scene singing &quot;Liebestod&quot; in Robert Wilson&#x27;s opera &quot;The Days Before: Death, Destruction and Detroit III&quot; at the Lincoln Center in New York City (1999).

She died in Istanbul at the age of 94 due to complications related with heart surgery. She is survived by her daughter, Zeliha Berksoy.

==Commemoration==
On 24 May 2019, on Berksoy’s 109th birthday, she was honoured with a Google Doodle.

Berksoy was celebrated in an exhibition &quot;Cumhuriyet Kadınları Sahneye Çıkıyor: Cevval, Akılcı, Dirençli, Sabırlı ve İnançlı&quot;, (Republican Women Take to the Stage: Brave, Rational, Resistant, Patient and Faithful) organised at Goethe-Institut Ankara from 5 December 2023 to 4 February 2024 in honour of the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Republic of Turkey and the 90th anniversary of Turkish women gaining the right to vote. It showcased the lives and careers of six women who were educated in the young Turkish Republic and the Weimar Republic and whose careers made an impact on the world. Alongside Berksoy the exhibition featured archaeologist Halet Çambel, architect Mualla Eyüboğlu Anhegger, computer scientist Marianne Laqueur, paediatrician Erna Eckstein Schlossmann and architect Margarete Schütte-Lihotzky.

<doc id="921638" wikidata="Q3058779" url="?curid=921638" title="Eastern Ontario">
<text>Eastern Ontario (census population 1,892,332 in 2021) () is a secondary region of Southern Ontario in the Canadian province of Ontario. It occupies a wedge-shaped area bounded by the Ottawa River and Quebec to the northeast and east, the St. Lawrence River and New York to the south, and Northern Ontario and Central Ontario to the west and northwest.

== Definitions ==
The traditional definition of the region boundary can be traced back to early colonial districts in the British Province of Quebec and Upper Canada. The Midland and Eastern Districts, originally known as the Mecklenburg District and Lunenburg District, from 1788 to 1792, were originally designated as everything east of north-south lines intersecting the outlets of the Trent River into the Bay of Quinte (in the case of Mecklenburg/Midland) and the Gananoque River into the St. Lawrence River (in the case of Lunenberg/Eastern). The original boundary lines followed a straight north-south alignment, but were eventually changed to a northwest-southeast orientation, similar to how the modern county boundaries are aligned.

Some government sources may include Hastings County, Prince Edward (considered part of the Eastern Ontario extended area), and occasionally Northumberland County within the definition of Eastern Ontario, but are otherwise classified as part of Central Ontario.

The region is also occasionally referred to as Southeastern Ontario to differentiate it from Northeastern Ontario, a secondary region of Northern Ontario.

==History==
Indigenous peoples had occupied Eastern Ontario for thousands of years prior to European settlement. Archaeological sites such as the Point Peninsula Complex indicate the presence of Paleo-Indians in the area dating back approximately 9,000 years. First Nations peoples located in the region included Anishinaabe, Algonquin, and Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) peoples.

Initial European settlement and colonization of the region occurred in the 17th and 18th centuries by the French and by fur traders as part of the colony of Canada within New France. Étienne Brûlé and Samuel de Champlain were the first colonists to navigate the Ottawa River in 1610 and 1613, respectively. The oldest continually-inhabited European settlement in Eastern Ontario is Kingston, which originated as a pre-European settlement named &quot;Cataraqui&quot;, and was established as &quot;Fort Cataraqui&quot; in 1673. The city would eventually serve as Canada&#x27;s first capital city from 1841 to 1844. Further development occurred under the British as part of the Province of Quebec from 1763 to 1791, and eventually the Province of Upper Canada from 1791 to 1841. Many cities in Eastern Ontario were established as United Empire Loyalist settlements following the American Revolution. The earliest loyalist settlement was Cornwall, originally known as &quot;New Johnstown&quot;, was established in 1784. Belleville was originally settled as a logging outpost in 1789, known originally as &quot;Meyer&#x27;s Creek&quot;. Ottawa was originally settled as &quot;Wright&#x27;s Town&quot; and later &quot;Bytown&quot; in 1800 as an agricultural and logging community. Further development of the community was spurred during the construction of the Rideau Canal, conceived as an alternate waterway bypassing the St. Lawrence River, a vulnerable location to American attacks following the War of 1812. The town was formally established as &quot;Ottawa&quot; in 1855, and remained inconsequential until it was selected as the permanent capital of Canada by Queen Victoria in 1857. Ottawa was chosen as the capital due to being situated in an isolated area further away from the US-Canada border, with the intention of being more defensible, and as a political compromise between Canada West and Canada East, who each desired Toronto and Montreal to serve as the national capital, respectively.

The region&#x27;s economy was initially focused largely on the fur trade, forestry, mining, and agriculture when the major cities were all colonial outposts. The dominance of the public sector and government services in both the cities of Ottawa and Kingston emerged during the 19th and 20th centuries, with both serving as historical federal capital cities. Kingston initially served as a major military outpost and operated some of United Canada&#x27;s earliest major hospitals and prisons. In Ottawa, the Public Service of Canada is the single-largest employer in the city, hosting Parliament Hill, the national headquarters for all major federal departments, and the National Defense Headquarters for the Department of National Defense. The 1980s and 1990s saw the emergence of &quot;Silicon Valley North&quot; in Ottawa, Canada&#x27;s original technology cluster, and currently one of the largest in Canada.

== Geography ==
Eastern Ontario is located within both the Mixedwood Plains Ecozone (as classified by Environment and Climate Change Canada, further subclassified into the St. Lawrence Lowland, Frontenac Axis, Manitoulin-Lake Simcoe regions), and Boreal Shield Ecozone (further subclassified into the Algonquin-Lake Nipissing region). Surficial geology largely consists of glacial till, glaciolacustrine and glaciomarine silt/clay plains, and low-lying wetlands underlain by sedimentary limestone, dolostone, siltstone, sandstone, arkose, and shale bedrock, in addition to sections of plutonic igneous granite, quartz, gneiss, and conglomerate bedrock of the Canadian Shield, which is exposed at the surface in many locations. Eastern Ontario&#x27;s geography is highly varied, with flat plains and rolling hills in the eastern section of the region, near the St. Lawrence River and Lake Ontario, and rugged highland areas in the sections that the Canadian Shield covers, including the Laurentian Highlands and Opeongo Hills, ranging from Algonquin Provincial Park south toward Lake Ontario. The Thousand Islands region is a unique bedrock archipelago in the St. Lawrence River that consists of approximately 1,864 islands straddling the Canada-US border. Geological fault zones run through the region, including the Western Quebec Seismic Zone and the St. Lawrence Rift System. These fault zones result in a graben (Ottawa-Bonnechere Graben) that forms the Ottawa Valley, running the length of the Ottawa River and Mattawa River north to Lake Nipissing. Subsequently, the region is prone to sinkholes and earthquakes. More severe earthquakes (Richter Magnitude scale of 5-6 or greater) occur at a frequency of approximately 60 years on average. The most recent severe earthquake to occur, the 2010 Central Canada Earthquake, caused minor damage to power grid systems and buildings in Ottawa and other nearby areas. Additional major historical earthquakes include the 1944 Cornwall-Massena Earthquake.

Eastern Ontario maintains significant forest coverage, predominantly in the areas of the Canadian Shield that could not be cleared for agricultural purposes. A singular forest region is located in Eastern Ontario, known as the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence forest. The historical prominence of the logging industry has resulted in significant historical clearing of these forests, but the implementation of more sustainable forestry practices and governmental protections on certain areas has resulted in regrowth and retention of forests on areas not suitable for agriculture. One major federally protected area, Thousand Islands National Park, is located in Eastern Ontario. Multiple provincial parks are also located in the region, with the most significant of which being Algonquin Provincial Park, itself established to encourage sustainable forestry practices after being clearcut in the late 19th century.

==Climate==
Eastern Ontario&#x27;s climate is heavily influenced by the proximity of the Great Lakes and its relative northern latitude compared to other parts of Southern Ontario. Winters in the region are typically severe, with regions experiencing low temperatures and significant amounts of snow and ice during winter months. Highland regions experience more severe winters due to their higher elevation. Significant snowfall is common in the area even into the spring. Summers are typically hot and humid in lower-lying areas, with milder and cooler summers occurring in the north. Eastern Ontario also experiences ice storms on a regular basis due to the presence of the arctic high-pressure system, heavily impacting the low-lying areas of the Ottawa Valley and St. Lawrence Valley, with significant events including the 1998 North American Ice Storm and the 2023 Canadian Ice Storm. Eastern Ontario also regularly experiences severe weather events, including tornadoes, and thunderstorms as a result of humid summer temperatures.

Under the Köppen climate classification, Eastern Ontario has a humid continental climate, with the entire area experiencing a warm-summer &quot;Dfb&quot; climate&quot;.&quot; Temperatures are warmer along the north shore of Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River, in areas such as Prince Edward County, in comparison to the more northern areas of the region.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Roads ===

The vast majority of the primary vehicular traffic network in Eastern Ontario is served mainly by the controlled-access 400-series highways. Highway 401, the main highway in the network, starts as a continuation of Autoroute 20 at the Quebec border in South Glengarry and runs southwest to Belleville, where it continues southwest through the Golden Horseshoe and Southwestern Ontario. Highway 416, another major highway, runs north from Highway 401 near Johnstown, where it connects with Highway 417 in Ottawa. Highway 417 starts as a continuation of Autoroute 40 at the Quebec border in East Hawkesbury and runs northwest through Ottawa toward Arnprior, after which it becomes Highway 17. Highways 401 and 417 carry Trans-Canada Highway designations throughout Eastern Ontario. Additional major provincial highways in the region include Highway 7, Highway 15, Highway 16, Highway 33, Highway 37, Highway 62, Highway 137, and Highway 138. An extension of Highway 417 toward Renfrew is under construction as of 2024. In 2024, the province announced that ownership of Highway 174 will be transferred to the provincial government from the city of Ottawa.

Eastern Ontario also has multiple road connections with the United States. These include the Thousand Islands Bridge near Gananoque, the Odgensburg-Prescott International Bridge in Johnstown, and the Seaway International Bridge in Cornwall, all of which cross the St. Lawrence River. Multiple bridges also connect the region with Quebec, including the Champlain Bridge, Chaudiere Bridge, Portage Bridge, Alexandra Bridge, and the MacDonald-Cartier Bridge in Ottawa, and the Long-Sault Bridge in Hawkesbury, all of which cross the Ottawa River. Additional major bridges include the Norris Whitney Bridge in Belleville and the Quinte Skyway near Desoronto, which cross the Bay of Quinte.

=== Rail ===
Via Rail operates inter-regional passenger train service on the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, in Toronto-Ottawa-Montreal and Toronto-Montreal configurations, running predominantly along the route adjacent to Lake Ontario and the St. Lawrence River toward Montreal, but for trains bound for Ottawa, there is a spur route that runs north of Brockville and through Smiths Falls to Ottawa, as well as an additional line that roughly follows Highway 417 from Ottawa to Quebec. Ottawa is currently the only municipality in Eastern Ontario that has a rail-based transit system in operation. This transit system is known as the O-Train, which as of 2024, has two lines; the east-west Line 1 Confederation and the north-south Line 2 Trillium. Multiple lines are currently under construction as of 2024, including an extension of Line 1 Confederation, an extension/reconstruction of Line 2 Trillium, a new Line 3 Confederation spur, and a new Line 4 Airport Link, which connects the transit system to Ottawa MacDonald-Cartier International Airport. Additional future extensions of the O-Train system are planned for Barrhaven and Kanata, and connections with the proposed Gatineau LRT are also planned. A proposed commuter rail system called Letsgomoose that would extend as far as Arnprior, Smiths Falls, and Alexandria in Ontario, as well as Bristol, La Peche, and Montebello in Quebec, was initially proposed in 2007 by a private company called Moose Consortium Inc., but no movement has been made on the proposal since 2017.

Freight rail in the region is dominated by CN Rail and CPKC, the two major cross-national Canadian rail companies.

=== Waterways ===
Eastern Ontario does not have any major ports. While cargo ships transit through the region as part of the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Seaway system, most major port activities are located upstream in Thunder Bay, Windsor, and Hamilton, or downstream in Montreal and Quebec City. Minor ports are located in Belleville, Picton, Bath, and Kingston. 

The Ontario government currently operates passenger ferry services connecting Kingston to Wolfe Island. Other smaller locally-operated ferry services provide transit through the Thousand Islands on the Canadian side of the St. Lawrence River.

=== Airports ===
Eastern Ontario is home to only one major airport; Ottawa MacDonald-Cartier International Airport (YOW), in addition to multiple minor airports in either Ottawa or various smaller communities, such as Kingston Norman Rogers Airport (YKR), Pembroke &amp; Area Airport (YTA), and Rockliffe Airport (YRO). Ottawa International Airport is a major airport in the Canadian transportation network and offers flights to many major cities across Canada, in addition to select cities in the United States and the Caribbean. Additionally, a major Canadian Forces base, CFB Trenton (YTR), is located in Trenton and is operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force.

==Education==

Eastern Ontario has multiple tertiary education institutions in the form of both universities and colleges. Two universities, University of Ottawa and Queen&#x27;s University, are part of the U15 Group, the association of Canada&#x27;s dominant research universities.

=== Universities ===

* Carleton University, founded in 1942 in Ottawa;
* Queen&#x27;s University, founded in 1841 in Kingston;
* Royal Military College of Canada, founded in 1876 in Kingston;
* University of Ottawa, founded in 1848 in Ottawa;
** Saint Paul University, founded in 1848 in Ottawa;

=== Colleges ===

* Algonquin College, founded in 1967 in Ottawa;
** Additional campuses in Carleton Place, Hawkesbury, Perth, Pembroke, and Renfrew;
* Collège La Cité, founded in 1989 in Ottawa;
** Additional campus in Hawkesbury;
* Loyalist College, founded in 1967 in Belleville;
** Additional campuses in Bancroft and Tyendinaga Mohawk Territory;
* St. Lawrence College, founded in 1967 in Kingston;
** Additional campuses in Brockville and Cornwall.

== Culture ==

=== Language ===
The accent/dialect in the region, Ottawa Valley English, is distinct from the rest of Ontario. The region also has a significant Francophone population, encompassing approximately 15.4% of the Eastern Ontario population and 43.1% of all Franco-Ontarians as of 2022, owing to the region&#x27;s historical roots in French colonization and proximity to Quebec.

=== Sports ===
Eastern Ontario has a rich professional sports scene, largely centred on Ottawa, where two &quot;Big Six&quot; teams (MLB, NBA, NFL, NHL, MLS, and CFL) currently play - the Ottawa Senators of the NHL, and the Ottawa Redblacks of the CFL. The Ottawa Charge of the PWHL also play in the city, in addition to multiple other additional professional franchises from other leagues, including the AHL, CEBL, CPL, and NLL. Additional professional hockey teams were previously located in the region, including in the NHA&#x27;s (the predecessor of the modern NHL) Renfrew Creamery Kings, and the WHA&#x27;s (which later merged with the modern NHL) Ottawa Civics and Ottawa Nationals. Historical Canadian football teams from the ORFU and QRFU included the Brockville Football Club, Kingston Granites, and Ottawa Trojans. The history of professional sports in the Ottawa region has long been tumultuous and saw professional franchises leave the city on multiple occastions, including the original Ottawa Senators of the NHL, being founded in 1883 and relocating in 1934, the Ottawa Rough Riders of the CFL, being founded in 1876 and folding in 1996, and the Ottawa Renegades of the CFL, being founded in 2002 and folding in 2008.

A bid for a Major League Soccer franchise was made by former Ottawa Senators owner Eugene Melnyk in 2010, with intention of constructing a new stadium in Kanata. The Ottawa bid was ultimately rejected in favour of the Portland Timbers and Vancouver Whitecaps expansion teams.

This was the nation&#x27;s nineteenth appearance at the Summer Olympics, excluding the 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam. The Brazilian Olympic Committee (, &quot;COB&quot;) sent the nation&#x27;s largest ever delegation in history to the Games. A total of 243 athletes, 124 men and 119 women, competed in 24 sports.

Brazil left Athens with a total of 10 medals (5 golds, 2 silver, and 3 bronze), the lowest in Summer Olympics since 1992. Although the nation&#x27;s final medal count could not surpass its previous records set in Atlanta (15 medals) and Sydney (12 medals), Brazil produced a record of five golds at these edition, a performance only surpassed 12 years later in Rio de Janeiro, when Brazil was the host country and won seven gold medals.

Brazil conquered its first gold medal ever in Equestrian as also in a mixed Olympic event, with the gold medal won by Rodrigo Pessoa in individual jumping.

==Summary==

Until the Athens 2004 Games, Brazil had only a two-time Olympic champion, the legendary Adhemar Ferreira da Silva, who shone on the triple jump in Helsinki-1952 and Melbourne-1956. That changed when sailor Robert Scheidt shone in the Laser class and secured his second gold medal (he had already been champion in Atlanta 1996).

Also in the sailing, Torben Grael and Marcelo Ferreira reached gold in the Star class. Both became two-time Olympic champions since they had won in Atlanta-1996. With the achievement, Torben Grael wrote his name in history (at the time) as the greatest Olympic athlete in Brazil at all times, with five medals ( a performance also matched by Robert Scheidt 8 years later ). He is also one of the sailors with the largest number of Olympic medals at all times, along with Robert Scheidt and British Ben Ainslie.

In the men&#x27;s volleyball the team coached by the victorious Bernardo Rezende and led by Gilberto Godoy Filho, who started the greatest era of achievements with the Brazil men&#x27;s national volleyball team, Brazil defeated Italy in the final by 3 to 1 and secured the second gold medal of national volleyball in the Olympic Games. In the team were Maurício Lima and Giovane Gávio, unique remnants of the historic triumph of the tournament of Barcelona 1992.

In men&#x27;s beach volleyball, Emanuel Rego and Ricardo Santos defeated the Spaniards Javier Bosma and Pablo Herrera in the final and secured the gold. It was the first gold medal ever won by Brazilian men in beach volleyball. In women&#x27;s beach volleyball Shelda Bede and Adriana Behar again came to the decision, but as they did four years earlier in Sydney, they silver medalists, after losing to Kerri Walsh and Misty May.

Led by Formiga and Marta, women&#x27;s national football team finally won the first Olympic medal ever. The team advanced to the final against United States. After a very tough match with a draw of 1–1 in regular time, the Americans won the gold medal match by 2–1 at extra time, leaving Brazil with the silver medal.

Brazilian judokas won two more podiums for Brazil. Leandro Guilheiro was responsible for giving the country the first medal in Athens, the bronze in men&#x27;s 81 kg. The second Brazilian medal in that edition also came from judo, with the bronze of Flávio Canto, in men&#x27;s 81 kg category.

In the men&#x27;s marathon, one of the most remarkable scenes of the Athens 2004 Games, which gained worldwide notoriety, involved the marathon runner Vanderlei de Lima. He was leading the race, which closes the Olympics, when, at the time of the 36th of the 42 kilometers of the race, he was attacked by Irish religious fanatic Cornelius Horan. The Brazilian was pushed off the track by Cornelius. Despite that, Vanderlei returned to the race, but with the time lost in the unforeseen event, he was overtaken by the Italian Stefano Baldini and the American Mebrahtom Keflezighi. Vanderlei, meanwhile, maintained the third position and, thus, was left with the bronze medal. He was the first and so far the only Brazilian marathon runner to obtain an Olympic medal. Later, Vanderlei de Lima received the prestigious Pierre de Coubertin Medal to his achievements for sportsmanship. The medal, one of the most important awarded by the International Olympic Committee, is dedicated to athletes who value sport more than victory itself. At the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, Vanderlei de Lima received the honour of lighting the Olympic Flame as the final member of the torch relay.

Brazilian equestrian and show jumper Rodrigo Pessoa was the originally the silver medalist in individual jumping. On October 8, 2004, the International Federation for Equestrian Sports ordered a suspension for Ireland&#x27;s Cian O&#x27;Connor after his horse Waterford Crystal failed a doping test for fluphenazine and zuclopenthixol. Because O&#x27;Connor decided not to appeal and formally strip off his Olympic title in men&#x27;s show jumping, silver Rodrigo Pessoa was subsequently awarded and received his gold medal at a public ceremony on Copacabana Beach in August 2005. This was the first and so far the only gold medal won by Brazil not only in Equestrian as also in a mixed Olympic event.

Brazil has qualified two teams in eventing and jumping. Show jumper Rodrigo Pessoa originally claimed a silver medal in men&#x27;s show jumping. On October 8, 2004, International Federation for Equestrian Sports announced that Waterford Crystal, owned by Ireland&#x27;s Cian O&#x27;Connor, failed a horse doping test for fluphenazine and zuclopenthixol that formally stripped off O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s Olympic title in early 2005. Pessoa was eventually presented with his gold medal at a ceremony on Copacabana Beach in August 2005.

<doc id="921672" wikidata="Q548046" url="?curid=921672" title="While My Guitar Gently Weeps">
<text>&quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1968 double album &quot;The Beatles&quot; (also known as the &quot;White Album&quot;). It was written by George Harrison, the band&#x27;s lead guitarist, as an exercise in randomness inspired by the Chinese &quot;I Ching&quot;. The song conveys his dismay at the world&#x27;s unrealised potential for universal love, which he refers to as &quot;the love there that&#x27;s sleeping&quot;.

The song also serves as a comment on the disharmony within the Beatles after their return from studying Transcendental Meditation in India in early 1968. This lack of camaraderie was reflected in the band&#x27;s initial apathy towards the composition, which Harrison countered by inviting his friend and occasional collaborator, Eric Clapton, to contribute to the recording. Clapton overdubbed a lead guitar part, although he was not formally credited for his contribution. Harrison first recorded it with a sparse backing of acoustic guitar and harmonium – a version that appeared on the 1996 &quot;Anthology 3&quot; outtakes compilation and, with the addition of a string arrangement by George Martin, on the &quot;Love&quot; soundtrack album in 2006. The full group recording was made in September 1968, at which point the song&#x27;s folk-based musical arrangement was replaced by a production in the heavy rock style. The recording was one of several collaborations between Harrison and Clapton during the late 1960s and was followed by the pair co-writing the song &quot;Badge&quot; for Clapton&#x27;s group Cream.

On release, the song received praise from several music critics, and it has since been recognised as an example of Harrison&#x27;s maturing as a songwriter beside his Beatles bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; 135th on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, seventh on the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;, and at number 10 on its list of &quot;The Beatles 100 Greatest Songs&quot;. Clapton&#x27;s performance was ranked 42nd in &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s 2008 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos&quot;. Harrison and Clapton often performed the song together live, during which they shared the lead guitar role over the closing section. Live versions featuring the pair were included on the &quot;Concert for Bangladesh&quot; album in 1971 and &quot;Live in Japan&quot; in 1992. Backed by a band that included McCartney and Ringo Starr, Clapton performed the song at the &quot;Concert for George&quot; in November 2002, a year after Harrison&#x27;s death.

==Background and inspiration==

George Harrison wrote &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; after his return from India, where the Beatles had been studying Transcendental Meditation under Maharishi Mahesh Yogi during the spring of 1968. The visit had allowed Harrison to re-engage with the guitar as his primary instrument, after focusing on the Indian sitar for the previous two years, and also marked the start of a prolific period for him as a songwriter. Inspiration for the song came to him when he was visiting his parents in Warrington, Cheshire, and he began reading the &quot;I Ching&quot;, or &quot;The Book of Changes&quot;. As Harrison put it, &quot;[the book] seemed to me to be based on the Eastern concept that everything is relative to &quot;everything&quot; else, as opposed to the Western view that things are merely coincidental.&quot; Embracing this idea of relativism, he committed to writing a song based on the first words he saw upon opening a book, which happened to be &quot;gently weeps&quot;. Harrison continued to work on the lyrics after this initial writing session.

The song reflects the disharmonious atmosphere within the Beatles following their return from India. Harrison had led the band in their highly publicised endorsement of Transcendental Meditation and viewed this spiritual pursuit as superior in importance to their career momentum. When discussing another song he wrote at this time, &quot;Not Guilty&quot;, Harrison said it referred to &quot;the grief I was catching&quot; from John Lennon and Paul McCartney for leading them to Rishikesh and supposedly hindering the group&#x27;s career and the launch of their Apple record label. Eric Clapton, with whom Harrison collaborated on several recordings throughout 1968 as a distraction from the Beatles, said that &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; conveyed Harrison&#x27;s spiritual isolation within the group. Author Jonathan Gould writes that, although in the past each of the Beatles had become temporarily subsumed in fads and personal interests, the level of Harrison&#x27;s commitment to Indian spirituality as an alternative to the band was unprecedented.

A demo that Harrison recorded at his home in Esher includes an unused verse: &quot;I look at the trouble and hate that is raging / While my guitar gently weeps / As I&#x27;m sitting here, doing nothing but ageing …&quot; This version also includes the line &quot;The problems you sow are the troubles you&#x27;re reaping&quot;, which he similarly discarded. An early acoustic guitar and harmonium performance of the song features a slightly different third verse: &quot;I look from the wings at the play you are staging / While my guitar gently weeps / As I&#x27;m sitting here, doing nothing but ageing …&quot; This version was released on the 1996 compilation &quot;Anthology 3&quot; and was used as the basis of the 2006 &quot;Love&quot; remix, with a string arrangement by George Martin.

==Composition==
===Music===
&quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; was one of the few Beatles compositions from early 1968 that changed markedly from demo form to the official recording. Harrison&#x27;s demos suggest the influence of folk music, yet the Beatles&#x27; version is in the heavy rock style typical of much of the band&#x27;s late 1960s work. While noting the importance of Harrison&#x27;s return to the guitar during this period, Gould describes the song as &quot;virtually a declaration of his recommitment to rock&quot;.

The song as originally issued by the Beatles is in the key of A minor, changing to A major over the bridges. Aside from the intro, the composition is structured into two rounds of verse and bridge, with an instrumental passage extending the second of these verse sections, followed by a final verse and a long instrumental passage that fades out on the released recording. All the sections consist of an even sixteen bars or measures, which are divided into four phrases.

The chord progression over the verses includes a descending bass of A–G–F–F (I–VII–VI–VI) over an A-minor chord, leading to F-major on the F bass note. According to musicologist Dominic Pedler, the I–VII–VI–VI progression represents a hybrid of the Aeolian and Dorian modes. The change to the parallel major key is heralded by a C chord as the verse&#x27;s penultimate chord (replacing the D used in the second phrase of each verse) before the E that leads into the bridge. Musicologist Alan Pollack views this combination of C and E as representing a sense of &quot;arrival&quot;, after which the bridge contains &quot;upward [harmonic] gestures&quot; that contrast with the bass descents that dominate the verse. Such contrasts are limited by the inclusion of minor triads (ii, iii, and vi) played over the E chord that ends the bridge&#x27;s second and fourth phrases.

===Lyrics===
In his lyrics to &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;, Harrison revisits the theme of universal love and the philosophical concerns that were evident in his overtly Indian-influenced compositions, particularly &quot;Within You Without You&quot;. The song is a lament for how a universal love for humankind is latent in all individuals yet remains unrealised. In the description of theologian Dale Allison, the song &quot;conveys spiritual angst and an urgent religious point of view without being explicitly theological&quot;. Harrison sings of surveying &quot;you all&quot; and seeing &quot;the love there that&#x27;s sleeping&quot;. Musicologist Walter Everett comments that the change from the minor-mode verse to the parallel major might express hope that &quot;unrealized potential&quot; described in the lyrics is to be &quot;fulfilled&quot;, but the continued minor triads &quot;seem to express a strong dismay that love is not to be unfolded&quot;. During the bridges, Harrison adopts a repetitive rhyming scheme in the style of Bob Dylan to convey how humankind has become distracted from its ability to manifest this love. He sings of people that have been &quot;inverted&quot; and &quot;perverted&quot; from their natural perspective.

&quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; follows in a lyrical tradition established by Woody Guthrie, Pete Seeger and Bo Diddley, whereby emotions and actions are attributed to a musical instrument. According to an &quot;NME&quot; reviewer, writing in 1998, the song conveys &quot;serious concern&quot; for the Beatles&#x27; &quot;dwindling &quot;esprit de corps&quot;&quot;. Harrison biographer Joshua Greene says that its message reflects the pessimism encouraged by world events throughout 1968, such as the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy in the United States, and the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Allison writes that the lyrics represent the &quot;antithesis of spiritual triumphalism&quot;, in which Harrison &quot;mourns because love has not conquered all&quot;.

==Recording==
===Early attempts and basic track===
The Beatles recorded &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; several times during the sessions for their self-titled double album, also known as &quot;the White Album&quot;. The recording sessions, which began in late May 1968, were characterised by a lack of co-operation among the four band members, and by what Lennon&#x27;s bandmates regarded as the overly intrusive presence of his new girlfriend, Yoko Ono. In this atmosphere, Harrison had initially been reluctant to present his new compositions to the group. Take 1 on 25 July – the version later issued on &quot;Anthology 3&quot; – was a solo performance by Harrison, playing his Gibson J-200 acoustic guitar, with an overdubbed harmonium part.

Sessions on 16 August and 5 September produced full band recordings of the song. In the case of the 16 August version, an overdubbing session on 3 September marked the first time that the Beatles had used eight-track recording at EMI Studios. According to Ken Scott, the band&#x27;s recording engineer, Harrison saw the eight-track recorder in a corridor and, defying EMI regulations that new equipment should be thoroughly tested, insisted that they use it immediately. At the same session, Harrison overdubbed a backwards (or &quot;backmasked&quot;) guitar solo, as he had done two years before on &quot;I&#x27;m Only Sleeping&quot;, on the &quot;Revolver&quot; album, but he was not satisfied with the results. The Beatles then remade the basic track on 5 September – a session that marked Ringo Starr&#x27;s return to the group after he had walked out on 22 August, upset at the unpleasant atmosphere. While Harrison led the band in welcoming back their drummer, by installing a large flower display all over Starr&#x27;s drum kit, he continued to think that his bandmates were not giving their best to the song.

===Overdubs===

On 6 September, during a ride from Surrey into London, Harrison asked Clapton to play guitar on the track. Clapton, who recognised Harrison&#x27;s talent as a songwriter, and considered that his abilities had long been held back by Lennon and McCartney, was nevertheless reluctant to participate; he later recalled that his initial response was: &quot;I can&#x27;t do that. Nobody ever plays on Beatles records.&quot; Harrison convinced him, and Clapton&#x27;s lead guitar part, played on Harrison&#x27;s Gibson Les Paul electric guitar &quot;Lucy&quot; (a recent gift from Clapton), was overdubbed that evening. Recalling the session in his 2007 autobiography, Clapton says that, while Lennon and McCartney were &quot;fairly non-committal&quot;, he thought the track &quot;sounded fantastic&quot;, adding: &quot;I knew George was happy, because he listened to it over and over in the control room.&quot;

Harrison recalled that Clapton&#x27;s presence also ensured that his bandmates &quot;tr[ied] a bit harder&quot; and &quot;were all on their best behaviour&quot;. The Beatles carried out the remaining overdubs, which included an ascending piano motif, played by McCartney, over the introduction, Hammond organ by Harrison, and further percussion by Starr. McCartney also added a second bass part, played on his Fender Jazz Bass rather than on either of his usual Höfner or Rickenbacker models.

===Mixing===
Still wary that his contribution might present too much of a departure from the band&#x27;s sound, Clapton requested that Harrison give the lead guitar track a more &quot;Beatley&quot; sound when mixing the song. During final mixing for the album, on 14 October, the guitar part was run through an ADT circuit with &quot;varispeed&quot;, with engineer Chris Thomas manipulating the oscillator to achieve the desired &quot;wobbly&quot; effect. According to Everett, Lennon&#x27;s tremolo-rich guitar part, recorded on 5 September, was retained only in the song&#x27;s coda.

Everett credits Clapton&#x27;s guitar contribution with making the Beatles recording a &quot;monumental&quot; track. As particularly notable features, he highlights the increasing lengths of thrice-heard first scale degrees (0:17–0:19), the restraint shown by rests in many bars then unexpected appearances (as at 0:28–0:29), commanding turnaround phrases (0:31–0:33), expressive string bends marking modal changes from C to C (0:47–0:53), power retransition (1:21–1:24), emotive vibrato (2:01–2:07), and a solo (1:55–2:31) with a &quot;measured rise in intensity, rhythmic activity, tonal drive and registral climb&quot;. In October 1968, Harrison reciprocated by co-writing &quot;Badge&quot; with Clapton and playing on Cream&#x27;s recording of the track. Released on Cream&#x27;s final album, &quot;Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Badge&quot; reflected Harrison&#x27;s pop sensibilities and helped Clapton transition from the heavy blues style and its reliance on extended soloing, and onto the more song-based approach that he and Harrison admired in the Band&#x27;s 1968 album &quot;Music from Big Pink&quot;.

==Release and reception==
Apple Records released &quot;The Beatles&quot; on 22 November 1968. One of four Harrison compositions on the double album, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; was sequenced as the penultimate track on side one in the LP format, between Lennon&#x27;s &quot;The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill&quot; and &quot;Happiness Is a Warm Gun&quot;. The song was issued as the B-side of &quot;Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da&quot;, a McCartney-written song that had also tested the Beatles&#x27; patience during the White Album sessions. This single was an international hit, topping charts in Australia, Austria, Switzerland and West Germany, but was not released in Britain or the United States.
Recalling the release in his 1977 book &quot;The Beatles Forever&quot;, Nicholas Schaffner said that, in returning to pop/rock songwriting after his excursions into the Indian classical style, Harrison&#x27;s four White Album songs &quot;firmly established him as a contender&quot; beside Lennon and McCartney. In Schaffner&#x27;s description, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; was the most instantly popular of &quot;a quartet of more conventionally accessible pop songs [written by Harrison] that many felt were among the finest on the album&quot;. According to Beatles historian Erin Torkelson Weber, the release of the White Album marked the start of a period when many observers began to consider his songs &quot;equal to some of Lennon and McCartney&#x27;s best compositions&quot;, a view that was heightened with his two contributions to the Beatles&#x27; 1969 album &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;. &quot;New Yorker&quot; columnist Mark Hertsgaard, writing in his 1995 book &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, said &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; was &quot;the first great composition of George&#x27;s career and perhaps the single most impressive song on the White Album&quot;.

Among contemporary reviews, Jann Wenner of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; was &quot;one of George Harrison&#x27;s very best songs&quot;, and likened it to &quot;Blue Jay Way&quot; in that it &quot;recalls California, the simple Baja California beat, the dreamy words of the Los Angeles haze, the organic pace lapping around every room as if in invisible waves&quot;. Wenner found the lyrics &quot;slightly self-righteous and preaching&quot;, representing &quot;a general set of incidents, a message, like a sermon, impersonally directed to everyone&quot;, and concluded: &quot;I am willing to bet something substantial that the lead guitarist on this cut is Eric Clapton, yet another involution of the circular logic on which this song [is] so superbly constructed as a musical piece.&quot; In his review for the &quot;International Times&quot;, Barry Miles said the song was a &quot;great tune&quot; with &quot;nice hi-hats&quot; but a &quot;lifeless&quot; guitar part.

Alan Smith of the &quot;NME&quot; credited the &quot;warm voice&quot; and &quot;very strong melody&quot; to McCartney and said that the track was one of the &quot;highlights ... moving into a slightly Hendrix thing&quot; and was bound to be &quot;Another hit for somebody&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith/NME&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Three weeks later, Smith acknowledged that the singer and composer was in fact Harrison, and added: &quot;the words are evocative and the melody line is creeping into my mind to stay.&quot; Geoffrey Cannon wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;George Harrison has seen the truth, and is anxious that we should see our truth. He&#x27;s a preacher, man of fire. When his songs speak of &#x27;you&#x27;, the address is direct. He achieves his character in &#x27;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&#x27;, which, with Phil Ochs&#x27; &quot;Tape from California&quot;, is the first track I know that succeeds in making magnanimous love serious and touching.&quot;

==Retrospective assessment and legacy==
&quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; became a staple of US rock radio during the early 1970s, on a par with songs such as &quot;Layla&quot; by Clapton&#x27;s short-lived band Derek and the Dominos, Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; and the Who&#x27;s &quot;Won&#x27;t Get Fooled Again&quot;. In 1973, it appeared on the Beatles&#x27; double album compilation &quot;1967–1970&quot;, as one of only three tracks representing the White Album. Capitol Records included it on &quot;The Best of George Harrison&quot; in 1976; a year before this, Harrison released a sequel to the song, titled &quot;This Guitar (Can&#x27;t Keep from Crying)&quot;, which also served as the final single issued by Apple in its original incarnation. The Beatles&#x27; recording appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;Withnail and I&quot;, a 1987 comedy film set in late-1960s London and produced by Harrison&#x27;s company HandMade Films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pirnia/MentalFloss&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing for &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2004, Pete Paphides described &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; as &quot;George Harrison&#x27;s startling coming of age as a songwriter&quot; and one of the few tracks that &quot;pick themselves&quot; when listeners attempt to edit the double album down to a single disc. In his book &quot;Revolution in the Head&quot;, Ian MacDonald was less impressed with the track, saying that it &quot;exudes a browbeating self-importance which quickly becomes tiresome&quot;. McCartney identified it as one of his favourite selections on the 1995–96 &quot;Anthology&quot; outtakes series, and he grouped the song with &quot;Something&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot; as candidates for Harrison&#x27;s &quot;greatest track&quot;. Starr paired it with &quot;Something&quot; as &quot;Two of the finest love songs ever written&quot;, adding: &quot;they&#x27;re really on a par with what John and Paul or anyone else of that time wrote.&quot; In their written tributes to Harrison following his death in November 2001, Mick Jagger and Keith Richards each expressed their admiration for the song. Jagger said: &quot;It&#x27;s lovely, plaintive. Only a guitar player could write that ...&quot;

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; 136th on its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;, seventh on the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Songs of All Time&quot;, and at number 10 on its list of &quot;The Beatles 100 Greatest Songs&quot;. Clapton&#x27;s performance was ranked 42nd in &quot;Guitar World&quot;″s 2008 list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos&quot;. Among other critics&#x27; lists of the best Beatles songs, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine and &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; each ranked it at number 4, while &quot;Mojo&quot; placed it at number 17.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander/Mojo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In his commentary for the &quot;Mojo&quot; selection, English songwriter Chris Difford said that he had only come to fully appreciate the lyrics following Harrison&#x27;s death in 2001; describing them as a &quot;riposte&quot; to Harrison&#x27;s bandmates, particularly Lennon and McCartney, Difford added: &quot;George was the one who came back from India with the spiritual awakening and carried it through to the rest of his life, whereas the others came back with the postcards.&quot; In 2018, the music staff of &quot;Time Out London&quot; ranked &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; 20th on their list of the best Beatles songs. Coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the White Album&#x27;s release, Jacob Stolworthy of &quot;The Independent&quot; listed it at number 1 on his ranking of the album&#x27;s 30 tracks. He said the song was &quot;hands down one of The Beatles&#x27; greatest&quot; and, having been conceived through &quot;disharmony – in the world, as well as in the band he&#x27;d grown up with&quot;, &quot;testament to Harrison&#x27;s genius&quot;.

==Harrison live performances==
Harrison played &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; at every one of his rare concerts as a solo artist. Writing for &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2003, Ashley Kahn attributed the track&#x27;s &quot;classic&quot; status to its evocation of &quot;a band falling out of harmony&quot; and, with regard to the enduring musical bond between Harrison and Clapton, its standing as &quot;&quot;their&quot; song&quot;. At Harrison&#x27;s Concert for Bangladesh, held at Madison Square Garden in New York on 1 August 1971, Clapton performed the song on a Gibson Byrdland, a hollow-body guitar more suited to jazz or country music than rock. He later said that this was a poor decision and, as with his substandard playing at the event, one that was indicative of his descent into heroin addiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clapton/BD Revisited&quot;&gt;&quot;The Concert for Bangladesh Revisited with George Harrison and Friends&quot;, DVD, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In his entry for &quot;The Concert for Bangladesh&quot; in the book &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot;, Tom Moon nevertheless describes Clapton and Harrison&#x27;s interplay as &quot;one of the more thrilling two-man guitar explorations in rock&quot;, adding: &quot;As they finish each other&#x27;s thoughts, the two extend and amplify the song&#x27;s intent: You haven&#x27;t heard the full gamut of gentle (and not so) guitar weeping until you&#x27;ve heard this.&quot;

The version performed by Harrison during his brief set at the 1987 Prince&#x27;s Trust Concert reunited him with Starr and Clapton, and features an extended coda with the guitars of Harrison and Clapton interweaving. On their 1991 tour of Japan, Harrison and Clapton performed &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; with additional background vocals. An edit combining parts of the 14 December and 17 December Tokyo Dome performances of the song was included on Harrison&#x27;s 1992 double album &quot;Live in Japan&quot;.

Harrison also featured the song in the set list for his only other tour as a solo artist, a series of North American concerts over November–December 1974 with Ravi Shankar. Harrison shared the lead guitarist&#x27;s role with Robben Ford, often extending the piece to eight minutes. While it was a popular inclusion in a set list that barely acknowledged Harrison&#x27;s past as a former Beatle, his alteration of some of the lyrics – so that his guitar &quot;gently smiles&quot; and &quot;tries to smile&quot; – disappointed many concert-goers and reviewers. Author Simon Leng comments that on Harrison&#x27;s return to Madison Square Garden towards the end of the tour, his playing on the song nevertheless received a standing ovation.
==Cover versions==
Canadian guitarist Jeff Healey covered &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; on his 1990 album &quot;Hell to Pay&quot;. Harrison participated in the recording, contributing on acoustic guitar and backing vocals. Also issued as a single, Healey&#x27;s version peaked at number 27 in Canada, number 85 in the UK and number 25 in New Zealand.

American nu metal band Spineshank released a cover of the song on their 1998 debut album Strictly Diesel.

During the Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II concert at Buckingham Palace Garden on 3 June 2002, McCartney performed the song with Clapton, as a tribute to Harrison. The performance appears on the DVD release &quot;Party at the Palace&quot;. On 29 November the same year, Clapton, backed by a large band that included McCartney, Starr, Dhani Harrison, Jeff Lynne and Marc Mann, performed &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; at the Concert for George in memory of Harrison. Author Ian Inglis writes that while Clapton was already &quot;permanently associated&quot; with &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; due to his presence on the &quot;White Album&quot; recording and the Concert for Bangladesh and &quot;Live in Japan&quot; versions, his long, closing solo at the Concert for George contained &quot;perhaps the most expressive&quot; playing of all those versions.

American musician Todd Rundgren covered &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; for the 2003 album &quot;Songs from the Material World: A Tribute to George Harrison&quot;. Rundgren said of his contribution to the multi-artist tribute: &quot;[Before the Beatles], I&#x27;d never heard the term &#x27;lead guitarist.&#x27; George created the job description for my first paying gig, the vocation that I&#x27;m still lucky enough to practice today …&quot; Johnny Loftus of AllMusic views the recording as one of the collection&#x27;s highlights, saying that Rundgren &quot;effortlessly replicates the grandeur&quot; of the Beatles&#x27; track. As his personal tribute to Harrison, Peter Frampton released a version of the song on his 2003 album &quot;Now&quot;.

In 2004, when Harrison was inducted posthumously into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a solo artist, &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; was played in tribute by a large band consisting of Tom Petty, Jeff Lynne, Steve Winwood, Marc Mann, Dhani Harrison, Prince, Steve Ferrone, Scott Thurston, Jeff Young, and Jim Capaldi. The performance concluded with a highly acclaimed extended guitar solo by Prince, who was also being inducted into the Hall of Fame.

Among other cover versions, the song has also been recorded by guitarists such as Marc Ribot, Phish and Charlie Byrd, and on ukulele by Jake Shimabukuro. Toto did a cover version for their album &quot;Through the Looking Glass&quot; and in a live performance in &quot;Live in Amsterdam&quot;. Santana did a cover for his twentieth album &quot;Guitar Heaven: The Greatest Guitar Classics of All Time&quot;, in 2010, featuring singer India Arie and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Released as a single, it charted on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult Contemporary. A recording of the song by Regina Spektor appears in the 2016 film &quot;Kubo and the Two Strings&quot;.

==2016 music video==
In June 2016, Apple Corps and Cirque du Soleil released a music video for &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot;. The video was created for the tenth anniversary re-staging of Cirque du Soleil&#x27;s &quot;Love&quot; theatrical production. The video was directed by Dandypunk, André Kasten and Leah Moyer. Ryan Reed, describing the clip for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, wrote that &quot;Dandypunk&#x27;s hand-drawn illustrations depict Harrison&#x27;s lyrics falling off the page into the air, transporting LOVE performer Eira Glover into a series of fantastical locations. Projection mapping – and no CGI – was used to create the clip.&quot;

<text>NEXT (; stylized as &quot;N.EX.T&quot; as an abbreviation for New EXperiment Team) was a South Korean rock band known for its provocative songs that critiqued social injustice. The band was formed by iconic Korean experimental rock singer Shin Hae-chul and debuted in 1992 with the album &quot;Home&quot;. NEXT went through several line-up changes over the years and has been inactive since Shin&#x27;s death in 2014.

==History==
NEXT (New EXperiment Team) was the band of singer/songwriter Shin Hae Chul (신해철). The group split up following the 1997 release of Lazenca: A Space Rock Opera, and the instrumentalists formed the alternative metal band Novasonic with rapper Kim Jun Pyo. 

N.EX.T reformed around 2003 following the disbanding of Novasonic, and composed the soundtrack for the Korean release of &quot;Guilty Gear XX #Reload&quot;. A few of its instrumental songs were re-worked into songs with vocals on the following album, The Return Of N.EX.T Part 3: The Book of War/The Diary of a Soldier. The Return of N.EX.T Part 3 included the song &quot;Dear America&quot; which featured many prominent Korean vocalists such as Psy, Kim Jun Pyo and Crash&#x27;s Ahn Heung-Chan. Guitarist Kim Se-hwang released his first solo album, Vivaldi: The Four Seasons, on June 27, 2011.

In 2014, group leader Shin Hae-chul died after poor medical treatment for cardiac arrest. On August 8, 2015, the band made their last appearance at the Pentaport Rock Festival, along with other musicians, for a special memorial stage for Shin. Since then, NEXT has been considered to be on hiatus.

==Themes==
NEXT&#x27;s songs contain many cultural criticisms, with &quot;Turn Off the T.V.&quot; and &quot;Money&quot; pointing to mediation and consumerism. Criticism of human disregard for the environment can be found in &quot;Lazenca, Save Us&quot; and &quot;The World We Made,&quot; which creates musical contrasts between a pleasant, natural world and a terrifying, industrial, human-influenced world. &quot;Cyber Budha Company Ltd.&quot; tells of a dark future in which humans can purchase small amounts of divinity through the use of machines and credit cards.

<text>Witold Chmielecki (1 June 1966 – 14 October 2022), better known by the pseudonym of Feliks Wiktor Kres, was a Polish fantasy writer. Winner of the Janusz A. Zajdel Award for his 1992 novel &quot;&quot;.

== Life ==
He debuted with his short story &quot;Mag&quot; (&quot;Mage&quot;), submitted to a writing contest of the &quot;Fantastyka&quot; magazine. Kres subsequently published seven novels and dozens of short stories. His pseudonym may be translated as &quot;lucky (or happy) end&quot; – &quot;Felix&quot; in Latin means lucky and &quot;kres&quot; means &quot;the end&quot; in Polish.

Kres was born in Łódź in 1966. He became best known for his two fantasy cycles - &quot;Księga całości&quot; (&quot;The Book of Entirety&quot;), which takes place in a world called Szerer, where intelligence, in addition to humans, was given also to cats and vultures, and &quot;Piekło i szpada&quot; (&quot;Hell and épée&quot;), dark fantasy set in an alternative 17th century, with demons and beings older than Satan himself. His works have been translated into Czech, Russian and Spanish. Second volume of his Book of the Entirety series won the Janusz A. Zajdel Award. 

For several years he ran a guide for young writers in the magazines &quot;Fenix&quot;, &quot;Magia i Miecz&quot;, and &quot;Science Fiction&quot;.

Kres died on 14 October 2022, at the age of 56.

<text>The Moscow rules are rules-of-thumb said to have been developed during the Cold War to be used by spies and others working in Moscow.

The rules are associated with Moscow because the city developed a reputation as being a particularly harsh locale for clandestine operatives who were exposed. The list may never have existed as written.

== The rules ==
Agent Tony Mendez wrote:Although no one had written them down, they were the precepts we all understood for conducting operations in the most difficult of operating environments: the Soviet capital. By the time they got to Moscow, everyone knew these rules. They were dead simple and full of common sense.In the International Spy Museum in Washington, D.C., the Moscow Rules are given as:
* Assume nothing. 
* Never go against your gut.
* Everyone is potentially under opposition control.
* Do not look back; you are never completely alone.
* Go with the flow, blend in.
* Vary your pattern and stay within your cover.
* Lull them into a sense of complacency.
* Do not harass the opposition.
* Pick the time and place for action.
* Keep your options open.

<text>James Claude &quot;Howie&quot; McKenny (born December 1, 1946) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey player and broadcaster.

As a defenceman, McKenny played in the National Hockey League from 1966 to 1978, mostly for the Toronto Maple Leafs, in addition to a short tenure with the Minnesota North Stars. His nickname &quot;Howie&quot; is due to a resemblance to Howie Young. Known for witty one-liners, McKenny once said of professional ice hockey that &quot;half the game is mental, the other half is being mental&quot;.

After retiring from playing hockey, McKenny settled in Toronto where he began a career in broadcasting, most notably working as a local television sports reporter on Citytv from 1984 until 2010.

==Junior hockey career==
Born in Ottawa, Ontario, McKenny played with the Neil McNeil Maroons of the Metro Junior A league in 1962–63. When the league folded in 1963, McKenny transferred to the Ontario Hockey Association&#x27;s Toronto Marlboros who won the Memorial Cup in 1964. 

As a junior, McKenny was considered by many scouts as the second-best defenceman prospect after Bobby Orr. 

In later years, McKenny spoke openly of his personal life and career being negatively affected by periods of alcoholism developed during his teenage years.

==Pro hockey career==
Drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the third round of the 1963 NHL amateur draft (17th overall), McKenny had difficulty staying in the NHL early in his career and often played forward instead of his usual position on defence. He was called up from the Marlboros to play two games with the Leafs in the 1965–66 season. He was given two other opportunities with the Leafs in 1966–67 and 1967–68 but only played a total of eleven games. However, on February 24, 1968, he scored the game-winning goal in a 1-0 win over Boston, which was the second goal of his NHL career. He struggled to stick with the Maple Leafs for several years, attributed to a poor attitude, possibly his alcoholism and his antipathy towards the high-pressure style of coach and general manager Punch Imlach. He played in the minor leagues for the Tulsa Oilers, Rochester Americans, and Vancouver Canucks of the Western Hockey League. Throughout the mid-1960s with the Rochester Americans, young McKenny and veteran Don Cherry were roommates when on the road.

McKenny finally became a full-time member of the Maple Leafs during the 1969–70 season and became one of the Leafs top defencemen for eight seasons. McKenny has the sixth-highest points total for Leafs defencemen, accumulating 327 points (81 goals, 246 assists) in 594 games, behind only Börje Salming, Tomáš Kaberle, Morgan Rielly, Tim Horton, and Ian Turnbull. McKenny was paired frequently with former Marlboro team-mate Brian Glennie, with offensive skills complementing the hard-hitting, defence-oriented style of Glennie. In 1974, McKenny played in the NHL All-Star Game. In 1971, he also appeared in the movie &quot;Face-Off&quot; as the skating stand-in for Art Hindle.

Near the end of his career, McKenny was sent down to the Dallas Black Hawks Central Hockey League (CHL) for the 1977–78 season, and was subsequently named to the CHL&#x27;s Second All-Star Team. On May 15, 1978, McKenny was traded to the Minnesota North Stars for cash and future considerations (the rights to Owen Lloyd), playing in only ten games before retiring from the NHL.

McKenny played the 1979-80 season in Europe—in Lyon, France and Rapperswil, Switzerland with SC Rapperswil–Jona—before retiring completely from hockey.

==Post-hockey==
After hockey, McKenny returned to Toronto and began attempting to break into the broadcasting industry, selling advertising and volunteering on the weekends at radio stations CHUM-AM and CHUM-FM. He soon landed a gig as a colour commentator for Canadian-Italian Hockey League (CIHL) games at St. Mike&#x27;s Arena, working Friday nights alongside play-by-play announcer Brad Diamond on local station CFMT-TV branded as &quot;Multilingual Television&quot;.

He was then hired by Gary Slaight at the Slaight Communications-owned Q107 radio station to sell advertising and contribute on the microphone on a show with Scruff Connors and Gene Valaitis.

Throughout this time, McKenny supplemented his income with modelling gigs.

===Citytv===
In 1984, after longtime Citytv sports anchor Jim Tatti left to launch &quot;Sportsline&quot; on the Canada-wide Global Television Network, 37-year-old McKenny was hired at Citytv. In addition to filing sports reports, McKenny began appearing as in-studio sports anchorman on the daily &quot;CityPulse&quot; 6p.m. and 11p.m. newscasts. During their on-camera banter before and after the sports segments, lead anchorman Gord Martineau usually addressed McKenny by his nickname &quot;Howie&quot;.

Over time, in addition to professional sports, McKenny devoted a significant portion of his &quot;CityPulse&quot; segments to covering local Toronto-area high school sports. During the high school sports season, this included the &#x27;Athlete of the Week&#x27; feature celebrating a different high school athlete&#x27;s exceptional performance; the segment eventually became somewhat of a signature for the reporter.

While on vacation in Montego Bay, Jamaica during November 2002, 55-year-old McKenny suffered a heart attack following a workout. After being taken to Half Moon Clinic in Jamaica, he was transported by air ambulance to South Miami Hospital where he underwent angioplasty. He has since been able to make a full recovery. In later interviews, McKenny talked about having to borrow US$70,000 from friends in order to immediately cover the U.S. airlift and hospital costs due to not having his Canadian medical insurance information on him.

The December 27, 2009 broadcast of &quot;CityPulse Tonight&quot; (11p.m. air time) was McKenny&#x27;s last with Citytv as the station refocused its sports coverage solely around the younger anchor Kathryn Humphreys. McKenny agreed to a deal to continue anchoring the sports package on the weekend newscasts for another year due to Humphreys&#x27; unwillingness to work the weekends.

McKenny, at the age of 64, did not pursue further jobs in broadcasting after leaving Citytv, and instead counselled alcohol addicts.

In 2013, McKenney was inducted into the Ottawa Sports Hall of Fame.

==Personal==
===Family===
McKenny and his wife Christine have two children, a son and a daughter. His daughter died in a car accident in 2013.

===Alcoholism===
McKenny struggled with alcoholism for much of his career in hockey and television, starting during his late teens and continuing well into his forties. He has been sober for over two decades. He now helps other addicts by working as a counsellor at the Canadian Centre for Addictions, based in Port Hope, Ontario.

<doc id="921727" wikidata="Q1972236" url="?curid=921727" title="The Wanderer (Old English poem)">
<text>The Wanderer is an Old English poem preserved only in an anthology known as the Exeter Book. It comprises 115 lines of alliterative verse. As is often the case with Anglo-Saxon verse, the composer and compiler are anonymous, and within the manuscript the poem is untitled.

==Origins==
The date of the poem is impossible to determine, but scholarly consensus considers it to be older than the Exeter Book itself, which dates from the late 10th century. The inclusion of a number of Norse-influenced words, such as the compound &quot;hrimceald&quot; (ice-cold, from the Old Norse word &quot;hrimkaldr&quot;), and some unusual spelling forms, has encouraged others to date the poem to the late 9th or early 10th century.

As is typical of Old English verse, the metre of the poem is alliterative and consists of four-stress lines, divided between the second and third stresses by a caesura. Each caesura is indicated in the manuscript by a subtle increase in character spacing and with full stops, but modern print editions render them in a more obvious fashion. It is considered an example of an Anglo-Saxon elegy.

==Contents==

&quot;The Wanderer&quot; conveys the meditations of a solitary exile on his past happiness as a member of his lord&#x27;s band of retainers, his present hardships and the values of forbearance and faith in the heavenly Lord. The warrior is identified as &quot;eardstapa&quot; (line 6a), usually translated as &quot;wanderer&quot; (from &quot;&quot; meaning &quot;earth&quot; or &quot;land&quot;, and &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;to step&quot;), who roams the cold seas and walks &quot;paths of exile&quot; (&quot;wræclastas&quot;). He remembers the days when, as a young man, he served his lord, feasted together with comrades, and received precious gifts from the lord. Yet fate (&quot;wyrd&quot;) turned against him when he lost his lord, kinsmen and comrades in battle—they were defending their homeland against an attack—and he was driven into exile. Some readings of the poem see the wanderer as progressing through three phases; first as the &quot;ānhaga&quot; (solitary man) who dwells on the deaths of other warriors and the funeral of his lord, then as the &quot;mōdcearig&quot; man (man sorrowful of heart) who meditates on past hardships and on the fact that mass killings have been innumerable in history, and finally as the &quot;snottor on mōde&quot; (man wise in mind) who has come to understand that life is full of hardships, impermanence, and suffering, and that stability only resides with God. Other readings accept the general statement that the exile does come to understand human history, his own included, in philosophical terms, but would point out that the poem has elements in common with &quot;The Battle of Maldon&quot;, a poem about a battle in which an Anglo-Saxon troop was defeated by Viking invaders.

However, the speaker reflects upon life while spending years in exile, and to some extent has gone beyond his personal sorrow. In this respect, the poem displays some of the characteristics of Old English wisdom poetry. The degeneration of “earthly glory” is presented as inevitable in the poem, contrasting with the theme of salvation through faith in God.

The wanderer vividly describes his loneliness and yearning for the bright days past, and concludes with an admonition to put faith in God, &quot;in whom all stability dwells&quot;.

== Interpretation ==

=== Critical history ===

The development of critical approaches to &quot;The Wanderer&quot; corresponds closely to changing historical trends in European and Anglo-American philology, literary theory, and historiography as a whole.

Like other works in Old English, &quot;The Wanderer&quot; would not have been understood between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries because of the rapid changes in the English language after the Norman Conquest. Until the early nineteenth century, the existence of the poem was largely unknown outside of Exeter Cathedral&#x27;s library. In John Josias Conybeare&#x27;s 1826 compilation of Anglo Saxon poetry, &quot;The Wanderer&quot; was erroneously treated as part of the preceding poem &quot;Juliana&quot;. It was not until 1842 that it was identified as a separate work, in its first print edition, by the pioneering Anglo-Saxonist Benjamin Thorpe. Thorpe considered it to bear &quot;considerable evidence of originality&quot;, but regretted an absence of information on its historical and mythological context. His decision to name it &quot;The Wanderer&quot; has not always been met with approval. J. R. R. Tolkien, who adopted the poem&#x27;s &quot;ubi sunt&quot; passage (lines 92–96) into &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; for his &quot;Lament for the Rohirrim&quot;, was one of the scholars who expressed dissatisfaction. As early as 1926–7 Tolkien was considering the alternative titles &quot;An Exile&quot;, or &quot;Alone the Banished Man&quot;, and by 1964–5 was arguing for &quot;The Exile&#x27;s Lament&quot;. Despite such pressure, the poem is generally referred to under Thorpe&#x27;s original title.

=== Themes and motifs ===

Critics have identified the presence in &quot;The Wanderer&quot; of a number of themes and formal elements common to the Old English elegies, including the &quot;beasts of battle&quot; motif, the &quot;ubi sunt&quot; formula, the exile theme, the ruin theme, and the journey motif, as also seen in &quot;The Seafarer&quot;.

The &quot;beasts of battle&quot; motif, often found in Anglo-Saxon heroic poetry, is here modified to include not only the standard eagle, raven, and wolf, but also a &quot;sad-faced man&quot; (&quot;sumne drēorighlēor&quot;, l. 83). It has been suggested that this is the poem&#x27;s protagonist.

The &quot;ubi sunt&quot; or &quot;where is/where are they&quot; formula is present in lines 92–94, in the form &quot;hwær cwom&quot; (&quot;where has ___ gone&quot;):

The motific use of this phrase emphasises the sense of loss that pervades the poem.

It has been argued that the concluding admonition is a later addition, as it lies at the end of a poem that some would say is otherwise entirely secular in its concerns. Opponents of this interpretation such as I. L. Gordon have argued that because many of the words in the main body of the poem have both secular and religious meanings, it is not necessarily the case that the poem&#x27;s explicitly religious conclusion represents a later addition.

In &quot;The Wanderer&#x27;s Courage&quot; (2005), L. Beaston describes the psychological or spiritual progress of the wanderer as an &quot;act of courage of one sitting alone in meditation&quot;, who through embracing the values of Christianity seeks &quot;a meaning beyond the temporary and transitory meaning of earthly values&quot;.

=== Speech boundaries ===

A plurality of scholarly opinion holds that the main body of the poem is spoken as monologue, bound between a prologue and epilogue voiced by the poet. For example, lines 1–5, or 1–7, and 111–115 can be considered the words of the poet as they refer to the wanderer in the third person, and lines 8–110 as those of a singular individual in the first person. Alternatively, the entire piece can be seen as a soliloquy spoken by a single speaker. Due to the disparity between the anxiety of the &quot;wanderer&quot; (&quot;ānhaga&quot;) in the first half and the contentment of the &quot;wise one&quot; (&quot;snottor&quot;) in the second half, others have interpreted it as a dialogue between two distinct personas, framed within the first person prologue and epilogue. An alternative approach grounded in post-structuralist literary theory, and posited by Carol Braun Pasternack identifies a polyphonic series of different speaking positions determined by the subject that the speaker will address.

<text>The Diefenbunker, formerly known by its military designation, Canadian Forces Station Carp (CFS Carp), is a large underground four-storey reinforced concrete bunker and nuclear fallout shelter located in the rural area of Carp, Ontario approximately west of downtown Ottawa. Between 1957 and 1961, during the Cold War the Government of Canada led by then Prime Minister John Diefenbaker authorized the Diefenbunker to be designed and built as the Central Emergency Government Headquarters (CEGHQ Carp) in an attempt to ensure the continuity of government subsequent to a nuclear weapons attack by the Soviet Union. In 1994, CFS Carp was decommissioned and closed.

In 1994, the Diefenbunker was designated a National Historic Site of Canada because it is considered the most important surviving Cold War site in Canada. The bunker is important as an engineering achievement and to the critical path method of planning used in its construction. In addition, the Diefenbunker is symbolic of the Cold War, a strategy of nuclear deterrence and the Canadian people&#x27;s determination to survive as a nation following a nuclear war. The Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada (HSMBC) plaque located at the Diefenbunker states:

In 1998, the facility was re-opened as a museum called the &quot;Diefenbunker: Canada&#x27;s Cold War Museum&quot; allowing the general public year-round access to tour the facility.

==History==

In 1958, at the height of the Cold War and the infancy of the intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) threat, Prime Minister John Diefenbaker authorized the creation of close to 50 Emergency Government Headquarters (nicknamed &quot;Diefenbunkers&quot; by opposition parties) across Canada. These shelters were part of what came to be known as the Continuity of Government plan, which was meant to protect various members of government in the event of a nuclear attack.

The original site, some east of Almonte (), was abandoned when ground water proved impossible to remove. An abandoned gravel pit outside Carp was selected instead, where construction soon began in 1959 and was completed by 1962.

The Carp shelter would be the largest of such facilities (over ) and the only one in the immediate Ottawa area. The underground 4-storey bunker required 32,000 tonnes of concrete and 5,000 tonnes of steel. The structure was capable of withstanding a nuclear blast of up to 5 megatons from away. It had massive blast doors at the surface, as well as extensive air filters to prevent radiation infiltration. Although supposedly effective against surface nuclear detonations, the facility was later found to be vulnerable to conventional Bunker buster bombs developed after its construction, as these bombs had time delay fuses that would detonate after they had penetrated deeply enough underground.

Underground storage was built for food, fuel, fresh water, and other supplies. The bunker was built to accommodate 565 people for up to one month without receiving additional supplies from the outside. It included an emergency broadcast studio for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and a vault on the lowest level to hold the gold reserves of the Bank of Canada.

These facilities were administered by the Royal Canadian Corps of Signals (later the Communications and Electronics Branch). A decentralized transmitter site, the Richardson Detachment, with numerous transmitter antennas, was located further to the west near Perth, Ontario that was supported from a 2-storey underground facility of similar construction to the Carp facility but much smaller. The Perth bunker has seen some recent local controversy, as it still remains on government owned land, surrounded by local development. Radio receiving facilities CFS Carp Almonte Detachment and CFS Carp Dunrobin Detachment, with complete receiving antenna arrays, were also built in the region, however, all of those buildings were above ground.

==Diefenbunker, Canada&#x27;s Cold War Museum==

CFS Carp was decommissioned in 1994 following the reduction of the ICBM threat.

From 1959 to 1994, the site was owned and operated by the Canadian Department of National Defence. After the local municipality took control of the facility in 1994, the community took a great interest in the bunker, requesting access to public tours of the facility. The local municipality took control of the facility and a group of local volunteers, recognizing the heritage and tourism value of the Carp Diefenbunker, undertook to open the facility as a cold war museum and conduct public tours. It was purchased by the Diefenbunker Development Group in 1998, and officially opened as a museum. The name of the facility was changed to &quot;Diefenbunker, Canada&#x27;s Cold War Museum&quot; shortly thereafter. It is currently open year-round for public tours.

Many areas of the bunker, including the PM&#x27;s Suite, the Emergency Government Situation Centre, the CBC Emergency Broadcasting Studio, the Military Federal Warning Centre, the External Affairs Ministerial Office, the Public Works Minister&#x27;s Office and the Bank of Canada Vault, are being restored to their operational condition. The rest of the 358 rooms have been converted to exhibits of the Cold War era.

===Growth of the Museum===

Upon its opening in 1998, the museum was run entirely by volunteers. However, the 5,000 visitors received by the museum that year was too much to be handled solely by volunteers.

In 1999, the museum&#x27;s second year of operation, a curator was hired along with some students. The museum&#x27;s visitation doubled to 10,000 people that year.

The museum continued to grow in popularity during the 2000s. Close to 15,000 visitors passed through the Diefenbunker in 2000. Additional part-time staff were hired throughout the year to keep up with museum maintenance and upkeep. As of 2008, the Diefenbunker averages approximately 25,000 visitors each year. Four full-time staff, nine part-time staff and numerous volunteers work to keep the museum running smoothly. In 2012, the museum had 45,280 visitors. This was one of the highest increases in attendance other than the opening year of the Bunker. In 2017, Canada&#x27;s sesquicentennial, the Diefenbunker welcomed 88,000 visitors through its blast doors. Since March 2016, the museum has also hosted an escape room that they state is the world&#x27;s largest.

The mandate of Diefenbunker, Canada&#x27;s Cold War museum is &quot;to increase throughout Canada and the world, interest in and a critical understanding of the Cold War, by preserving the Diefenbunker as a national historic site, and operating a Cold War Museum.

==Collections and research==
The Diefenbunker houses a collection of Cold War artifacts, an archive and a library, all of which are made available to researchers upon request, and to the general public through the exhibitions.

==Funding==
The Diefenbunker: Canada&#x27;s Cold War museum is a not-for-profit, charitable museum. It is funded privately; the main source of revenue for the museum comes from admission sales (approximately 75% of total revenue). The Diefenbunker actively applies for private, municipal, provincial and federal grants. The museum also relies on the generous support of the community through donations and sponsorship.

==Additional services==
The Diefenbunker offers additional services on top of public tours. The museum has space available to rent both for events and storage. The decommissioned bunker has been used as a movie set on several occasions, including for &quot;The Sum of All Fears&quot; and &quot;Rulers of Darkness&quot;.

<text>The [[Revolutionary Workers League/Ligue Ouvrière Révolutionnaire|Revolutionary Workers League]] was a Canadian Trotskyist group, formed in 1977 by a merger of four other organizations.

The RWL had a number of members active in the New Democratic Party (NDP), while also maintaining a separate public organization and newspaper (therefore they did not consider themselves to be entrists). The party generally endorsed NDP candidates in elections, but ran their own on some occasions, generally in ridings which the NDP did not contest, or had very little chance of winning.

Larry Johnston was the sole candidate of the Manitoba branch of the Revolutionary Workers League in the 1977 provincial election, campaigning in the Winnipeg riding of Osborne. He received 47 votes.

This appears to have been the only time that the Manitoba RWL endorsed one of its own candidates in a provincial election. It is not clear how long Johnston remained in the RWL after this.

During the 1980s, the RWL became divided between Trotskyist supporters of permanent revolution and followers of the American Socialist Workers Party, which after 1982 supported Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba as the vanguard of world revolution. It is unclear if the Manitoba RWL still existed by the time of this division.

<doc id="921759" wikidata="Q124337524" url="?curid=921759" title="MegaMan NT Warrior">
<text>is an anime and manga series based on the &quot;Mega Man Battle Network&quot; series by Capcom, both using the same name but heavily diverging from each other in terms of plot. The manga series was written by Ryo Takamisaki and ran in Shogakukan&#x27;s &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot; between 2001 and 2006, while the anime television series, produced by Xebec, Nihon Ad Systems and TV Tokyo, ran for five seasons on TV Tokyo in Japan between March 2002 and September 2006, reaching 209 episodes in total, as well as a feature film. Viz Media would license the series for distribution in North America, including all the main chapters of the manga between 2004 and 2008, while the anime would only have its first season and &quot;Axess&quot; aired on Kids&#x27; WB! from 2003 to 2005.

&quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot; takes place in an unspecified year of the 21st century (&quot;200X&quot;) in which the internet has rapidly progressed and is now the driving force of everyday life. Users are able to interact with the internet using PErsonal Terminals (PETs) handhelds and Net Navigators, online avatars with special functionalities including the ability to delete Viruses using Battle Chips. &quot;NT Warrior&quot; focuses on Lan Hikari and his NetNavi MegaMan.EXE in which they, alongside their friends attempt to stop the villain (initially the crime organization World Three, before diverging later on) from taking over or destroying the world. Both adaptations were commissioned alongside the first game&#x27;s development to ensure the series&#x27; success.

&quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot; was a success; during its run, the anime drew high viewership in North America and Japan, while the manga adaptation would see monthly sales up to 1.5 million. In 2022, as part of promotion for &quot;Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection&quot;, both the Japanese and English dubs (with the first episode of &quot;Axess&quot; being available with English subtitles, due to unknown reasons) of the anime were re-released onto the official YouTube channel until September 20.

==Plot==

=== Setting and characters ===

The series focuses on Lan Hikari and his NetNavi, MegaMan.EXE as they build their friendship while dealing with threats from various NetCrime organizations. Along with Lan are friends Maylu Sakurai, Dex Ogreon, Yai Ayano, Tory Froid, and their respective Navis: Roll, GutsMan, Glide, IceMan. Although the series originally remains fairly close to the original &quot;Battle Network&quot; in terms of storyline, it begins to diverge greatly partway into the series. For example, there is no evidence showing that Lan and MegaMan were twin brothers in the anime, unlike in the games where it is revealed near the end of the first &quot;Battle Network&quot; game.

=== Manga ===
The manga consisted of six storylines, each loosely adapted the elements from the games. The first storyline follows Lan and MegaMan fighting against World Three in a villain of the week format. After a series of attacks by World Three, Lan and MegaMan developed a rare ability of Full-Synchro—a state where the operator and Navi&#x27;s minds merge together allowing for quicker reactions at the cost of any damage on the Navi also being inflicted on the operator. Due to this, he is given a Net-Battler license and officially employed by the police to help in defeating World Three. Eventually, the leader of World Three, Dr. Willy, starts a massive attack on the world&#x27;s electronics and intends to use his creation, the Life Virus, to control the satellites in space to destroy the Earth. Lan and MegaMan managed to find an opening and defeat the Life Virus with MegaMan got blown all the way to the underground internet, the Undernet.

In the second storyline, Lan and MegaMan fight the remnants of World Three, only to be suddenly attacked by the strongest Navi of the Undernet, the &quot;Black Shadow&quot; Bass. They are swiftly defeated, but promise each other to improve their skills for an eventual rematch. Both soon enter an ancient pyramid and encounter PharaohMan, a NetNavi coming from an ancient civilization who bestows them the power of Hub-Style upon his deletion. MegaMan&#x27;s new power attracted the attention of criminal organization, Grave, who aims to rob MegaMan&#x27;s power by using their Multibug Organism, Gospel. Bass joined the fight and started their long awaited rematch, with MegaMan emerged victorious.

After Grave&#x27;s destruction, Lan and MegaMan were approached by a famous Net-battler instructor, Mr. Famous, who warned them of new enemies in the form of dark power led by the Quartet of Evil that rendered Hub Style useless. The dark power soon surrounds the city, causing Net Navis within to materialize in the real world. Mr. Famous assembled experienced Net-Battlers to combat the threat, but all were defeated save for Lan and MegaMan, and their friends, Chaud Blaze and ProtoMan who gained new power called the Muramasa-style from the King of Undernet, Serenade. Together, they defeat the Quartet of Evil, who have accumulated the darkness to revive Bass as a Dark Navi. Bass began his attack on the human world, absorbing Serenade in the process. Using the new program left behind by Serenade, Double Soul, MegaMan gained a new form, the Proto Soul, by absorbing 99% of ProtoMan&#x27;s power and defeated Bass. However, after Bass&#x27; defeat, two Dark Navis, LaserMan and MegaMan DS (Dark Soul), revealed themselves as Darkloids, the true preparators of the Dark Navis.

The dark dome recedes and NetNavis return to their PETs and the Cybernet. With the assistance of a Net Navi from Schaero, SearchMan, and BubbleMan, they find the black hole that the Darkloids used to enter their world. MegaMan and Lan used Hub Style to entered the black hole and confronted by MegaMan DS who has ShadeMan separate MegaMan and Lan&#x27;s consciousness, and severely injured Lan to make MegaMan gave in to his hatred, which reinforced MegaMan DS&#x27; power and allowed him to completely absorb Bass. ProtoMan and SearchMan followed MegaMan, and with their combined efforts as well as Bass rebelling from inside MegaMan DS, finally defeated MegaMan DS and LaserMan. A Netopia army led by NetNavi Colonel arrived shortly and destroyed the remaining the Dark Loids and close the portal to the Dark Cybernet. Days later, the Netopia army received the order to imprison MegaMan fearing a potential Double-Soul between him and Bass would result in world destruction, forcing MegaMan to be on the run.

Lan followed MegaMan to Netopia with Chaud&#x27;s help and discovered that the Netopia Army has been infiltrated by the Darkloids. After proving himself trustworthy, Colonel and his operator Baryl allowed MegaMan and Lan to join their cause to defeat the Darkloids led by Regal. In retaliation, Regal unleashes the dark program Nebula Gray which threatens to absorb the Cybernet. The Netopia Military attempts to invade Regal&#x27;s server but are wiped out by Nebula Gray except Colonel. Attracted by Nebula Gray&#x27;s dark power, Bass also joined the fight, soon followed by MegaMan, ProtoMan, TomahawkMan, and GyroMan. Everyone but MegaMan, Bass, and Colonel were defeated, so MegaMan was left with no choice but to merge himself with Bass, becoming Bass Cross MegaMan. While they overpowered Nebula Gray, the dark program recovered itself by absorbing Bass&#x27; power. MegaMan found a new power called Beast Out and used it to finally deleted Nebula Gray.

Sometimes after the battle against Nebula Gray, MegaMan was approached by a NetNavi named Iris. She gathered potentially strong NetNavis and told them to fight against each other and the winner will be bestowed the ultimate program that capable of resealing Cybeast Gregar, the origin of MegaMan&#x27;s Beast Out power. As the NetNavis battle each other to retrieve the loser&#x27;s Navi Mark, another Cybeast Falzer appeared and targeted him. MegaMan was given the Navi Marks of his friends, but was still incapable of defeating Falzer. Bass appeared and absorbed Falzer&#x27;s power, but Gregar and Falzer fused with each other into Super Cybeast Grezar to replace the power they have lost. Their fusion turns reality into data and absorbs it, with only MegaMan and Bass left to fight the Cybeast. Eventually, MegaMan with his Super Beast Out power destroyed the Cybeast&#x27;s core and was seemingly deleted in the explosion, leaving Lan distraught. A year later, the Cybernet was re-opened and MegaMan returned, happily reuniting with Lan.

=== Anime ===
&quot;EXE&quot; is roughly split into two separate storylines. The first concerns the original World Three and Mr. Wily&#x27;s plan on finding the Ultimate NetNavi, culminating in the N1 Grand Prix, a NetBattling tournament. At its conclusion, the Ultimate NetNavi PharaohMan awakens from his slumber and proceeds to claim the net as his own, deleting MegaMan in the process. PharaohMan would eventually be weakened by the two tournament finalists, ProtoMan and a newly rebuilt MegaMan, leading to his capture by Wily. The second half of the season has the characters take on Grave, a NetMafia syndicate spearheaded by Wily that seeks to create a virus beast with the capability to destroy the net.

Months later, Lan&#x27;s father Yuichiro Hikari completes his research on the Synchro Chip, a device that enables Operators and NetNavis to become one through the use of Cross Fusion. This development coincides with a plot by Nebula (led by the notorious Dr. Regal) and the Darkloids to take over both the human and cyberworlds. Lan manages to use the then-untested Synchro Chip to Cross Fuse with MegaMan and defeat the Darkloids that materialize in the real world with the aid of Dimensional Area Generators. Because of this, Lan is invited to become a NetSaver (Net Savior), an Official NetBattler charged with protecting the net. As a result of Cross Fusion, MegaMan loses his Style Change option, but instead gains the ability to use Double Soul (Soul Unison) with which allows him to combine his powers with other NetNavis.

Following the end of &quot;Axess&quot;, Duo, a being from outer space who seeks to destroy humanity after witnessing the chaos caused by Dr. Regal, appears. Intrigued by Cross Fusion, he decides to spare mankind temporarily, bestowing a test upon the main characters to assess whether or not humans truly merit survival. He sends his subordinate, Slur, to Earth, where she hands Navis possessing the powers of Duo&#x27;s asteroid to unsuspecting people to observe what they will do with such might. Lan and the other net saviors must work together to foil Duo and his subordinate. In the process, Neo WWW is formed by Tesla Gauss to cause havoc. Dr. Regal also returns during the movie, and again towards the end of &quot;Stream&quot;, with the focus of &quot;Stream&quot; shifting to time travel.

&quot;Beast&quot; introduces the warring Cybeasts Gregar and Falzar, as well as the Navi Trill. Pitted against the newly emerged Zoanoroid armies of the Cybeasts, Lan, MegaMan, and a select group of their partners, find themselves drawn into the parallel world of Beyondard. Guided by a mysterious girl, Iris, they join the human resistance in the fight to claim the &quot;Synchronizer&quot; powers of Trill, with which MegaMan is able to &quot;Beast Out&quot;. Nearing the end of &quot;Beast&quot;, the android brain belonging to Wily of Beyondard reveals himself along with his lackeys, Blackbeard and Yuika, hoping to acquire the victor Cybeast as his new body. Ultimately, the two merge into the Super Cybeast Grezar, which becomes Wily&#x27;s vessel with assistance from Trill&#x27;s powers. MegaMan and Trill merge and lend their strength to Lan to form a &quot;Juuka Style&quot; into Beast Form Cross Fusion Megaman, giving him the strength to destroy it.

&quot;Beast+&quot; consists of a string of arcs beginning with the appearance of the Professor and Zero (both from &quot;Mega Man Network Transmission&quot;). An ex-WWW member, the Professor recovers the remains of Gregar, intent on reviving it for his own purposes. Following its deletion and Zero&#x27;s decision to break ties with his master, the second arc takes place. The vengeful Professor, however, later resurfaces, unleashing a new subordinate known as Zero One. Moved by the kindness that has been shown to him, Zero sacrifices himself to put a stop to the Professor once and for all. The storyline then continues toward its finale with the introduction of Cache, the final boss of the Japan-exclusive mobile game &quot;Phantom of Network&quot;, who threatens to consume the world with the aid of Phantom Navis and cache data before being defeated by Cross-Fusion MegaMan.

==Media==

===Manga===
The &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot; manga series was written and illustrated by Ryo Takamisaki and published in the Shogakukan magazine &quot;CoroCoro Comic&quot;; Takamisaki stated the decision for a loose adaptation was requested by Capcom early on in its development, since they felt a direct adaptation would be too boring for readers. Prior to the first game&#x27;s release, Takamisaki was only able to access press material, and had to base the setting off what he had until he was able to obtain a copy, at which point he went back and reworked anything that contradicted the lore.

A total of 13 &quot;tankōbon&quot; (bound volumes) were published in Japan from July 2001 to November 2006. All 13 volumes of the series were licensed in North America by Viz Media and published between May 19, 2004, and February 5, 2008.

===Anime===

The anime adaptation first aired on TV Tokyo March 4, 2002. It spawned four sequels, &quot;Axess&quot;, &quot;Stream&quot;, &quot;Beast&quot;, and &quot;Beast+&quot;. The total number of episodes between all 5 series is 209. There was also a feature film within the &quot;Stream&quot; storyline subtitled &quot;Program of Light and Darkness&quot;. Only the first and second (&quot;Axess&quot;) series were adapted into English. The English adaptation was produced by Viz Media and recorded by Ocean Productions; it was announced by Warner Bros. on February 14, 2003, and first aired May 17, 2003, on Kids&#x27; WB in the United States and Teletoon in Canada. After airing just 13 episodes, the series went on hiatus before continuing on May 1, 2004, with 26 more episodes. Jetix Europe acquired Pay-TV rights to the series in a majority of regions from ShoPro Entertainment in March 2004.

The English adaptation of &quot;Axess&quot; aired in February 2005 in the United States and April 2005 in Canada, with the first episode airing as a &quot;sneak preview&quot; on November 22, 2004. It would be dropped and revived only to complete the final episodes from &quot;Axess&quot; before dropping it once more, leaving the series unfinished. In May 2005, it was announced that the anime would be licensed for Latin American regions in summer 2005. As with many anime series airing at the time, &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot; underwent censorship; in particular, names relating to either fire or explosives were changed to remove such references.

For South-East Asian countries, Voiceovers Unlimited produced an alternate English dub using the original Japanese terms, opening, and ending themes; unlike the Viz Media adaptation, this dub was completely uncensored.

===Film===
The movie, , was shown alongside the &quot;Duel Masters&quot; feature film, &quot;Duel Masters: Curse of the Deathphoenix&quot;, as part of a double-billing March 12, 2005, in Japan. The film itself is set during the events of the franchise&#x27;s third season, &quot;Stream&quot;

==Merchandise==

Merchandising for the &quot;Rockman.EXE&quot; series was heavy in Japan with a variety of toys. Toys ranged from action figures and plush dolls to board games and trading cards. Many toys were originally released by Bandai, including an electronic Plug-In PET replica of the PET used in the original &quot;EXE&quot;, but Takara took over with merchandising starting with &quot;Axess&quot;. Electronic PET toys have since been released with every new model used in the show: Advanced PET and Advanced PET II (&quot;Axess&quot;), Progress PET (&quot;Stream&quot;), and Link PET and Link PET_EX (&quot;Beast&quot; and &quot;Beast+&quot;). Battle Chips for use in the PETs are often packaged with other merchandise, including action figures and even Japanese installments of &quot;Battle Network&quot; video games.

Most of the merchandise remains Japan-exclusive. However, to help promote the English version of the anime series, Mattel created a line of original &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot; action figures for the U.S. market. The series were released in two waves with a third wave planned but never released. The action figures featured many prominent characters from the anime with detachable limbs—interchangeable with other figures—so that Battle Chip weaponry could be attached. Mattel also released all twelve DoubleSoul MegaMan figures (featured in &quot;Battle Network 4&quot; and &quot;Axess&quot;) with detachable armor, as well as various miniature figurines (usually depicted in battle) and a few taller figurines, including a talking CrossFusion MegaMan figure.

Furthermore, the Advanced PET toy (featured in &quot;Axess&quot;) was imported in three available designs: blue/gray (MegaMan), red/black (ProtoMan), and black/purple (Bass). The Advanced PET II model was planned but never released. English Battle Chips were packaged with nearly every piece of &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot; merchandise, but chips could also be bought separately in booster packs. Japanese and English Battle Chips will work on either Japanese or English versions of the PETs, although only the Progress PET featured backwards compatibility with previous generations of Battle Chips.

In 2004, Decipher also distributed a trading card game in the United States called &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior Trading Card Game&quot;. However, it was not a translation of the pre-existing trading card games in Japan. Three sets were released before the game was discontinued in 2005, after the end of the Mega Man Battle Network video games.

In Japan, various soundtracks have been released featuring background music and theme songs used in the show. Also, every episode of the anime has been released across sixty-five DVDs usually containing three episodes per disc. In the United States, thirteen DVDs have been released covering the original 52 episodes of &quot;EXE&quot;, including the English and Spanish dubs; the first six volumes were also released in VHS form, while the English version of &quot;Axess&quot; has yet to be released on DVD. In 2022, as part of promotion for the &quot;Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection&quot;, it was announced that both dubs would be re-released onto YouTube on the official &quot;Mega Man&quot; channel; episodes of the Japanese version released on December 14, while the English version was streamed on Twitch before their release.

Other merchandise includes a life-sized Mega Buster that fires foam darts, an original &quot;MegaMan NT Warrior&quot;-themed board game, and MegaMan.EXE Halloween costumes.

According to a viewership sample conducted in the Kantō region by Video Research, the anime drew in an average of 4.5% and a maximum of 5.9% of households during the last year of its original run. During the English dub&#x27;s run, Kids&#x27; WB! wrote that the series had outperformed all competitors with similar demographics. The manga adaptation reportedly sold 1.5 million units per volume in Japan alone.

<doc id="921770" wikidata="Q599915" url="?curid=921770" title="Dynamite Cop">
<text>Dynamite Cop, known in Japan as , is a 1998 beat &#x27;em up video game published by Sega and initially released in arcades on Sega Model 2 hardware. It is the sequel to the 1996 game &quot;Dynamite Deka&quot;, which was released outside Japan as &quot;Die Hard Arcade&quot;. The game was ported to the Dreamcast and released internationally in 1999, this time without the &quot;Die Hard&quot; license. A second sequel, &quot;Dynamite Deka EX: Asian Dynamite&quot;, was released only in arcades. In 2002, an Xbox version was announced by Sega and Cool Net Entertainment under the joint brand name &quot;CoolCool&quot;, but since then there has been no information and the project has been abandoned. CoolCool itself has not released anything other than Rent-a-Hero No. 1 and appears to have disappeared.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Dynamite Cop&quot; is a 3D beat &#x27;em up for up to two players in which players play as either Bruno Delinger, Jean Ivy, or Eddie Brown and fight through levels on board a cruise ship and on a deserted island to save the President&#x27;s daughter from a band of modern-day pirates led by Wolf &quot;White Fang&quot; Hongo, the main antagonist from the first game. The classic Sega arcade game &quot;Tranquilizer Gun&quot; (1980) is included as a bonus game on the Dreamcast version. Clearing all missions will enable you to play &quot;Tranquilizer Gun&quot; an unlimited number of times.

==Appearances in other games==
Its main character, Delinger, makes a cameo appearance in &quot;The House of the Dead 2&quot; as a playable character via a special item obtainable in the original mode (present in home versions of &quot;The House of the Dead 2&quot;). Bruno Delinger also makes an appearance in &quot;Project X Zone&quot; as a solo unit character.

A chicken-leg from &quot;Golden Axe&quot; makes a cameo appearance on the Island stage.

==Reception==
The Dreamcast version received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews according to the review aggregation website GameRankings. Jeff Chen of &quot;NextGen&quot; called the game&#x27;s Japanese import &quot;An entertaining, if somewhat last-generation-looking, game.&quot; In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 30 out of 40.

Also in Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the arcade version in their August 1, 1998 issue as the fourth most-successful arcade game of the month.

Scary Larry of &quot;GamePro&quot; said of the Dreamcast version in one review, &quot;Unfortunately, all the heart-stopping action-movie chop-sockie comes to an abrupt end. The game is extremely short, and even a mediocre player can get through in less than an hour. Even with the multiple paths, the game has to rely on gimmicky diversions like an art gallery or bonus games to extend its life. A weekend rental? Perfect for you weekend warriors.&quot; In another review, Larry &quot;Major Mike&quot; Hryb said, &quot;If you&#x27;re looking for an action game where brainpower takes a backseat to brute force, then walk the &quot;Dynamite Cop&quot; beat. Others will be satisfied with a rental.&quot;

<text>Gerard Marcus Meehan (born September 3, 1946) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey left winger and the former general manager and Senior Vice President of the Buffalo Sabres.

==Playing career==
Meehan was born in Toronto, Ontario and raised in Newmarket, Ontario. He played minor hockey for St. Michael&#x27;s College School and junior for the Toronto Marlboros. He played for the 1966–67 Marlboros that won the Memorial Cup.

Meehan was drafted by the Toronto Maple Leafs in the 1963 NHL amateur draft, fourth round, 21st overall. He played for the National Hockey League&#x27;s Toronto Maple Leafs, Philadelphia Flyers, Buffalo Sabres, Vancouver Canucks, Atlanta Flames, Washington Capitals, as well as the Ontario Hockey Association&#x27;s Toronto Marlboros, American Hockey League&#x27;s Rochester Americans, CPHL&#x27;s Tulsa Oilers, Western Hockey League&#x27;s Phoenix Roadrunners, Seattle Totems, and the World Hockey Association&#x27;s Cincinnati Stingers. He served as captain for both the Sabres and Capitals.

One of Meehan&#x27;s career highlights as a Sabre remains a lowlight to Flyers fans. In the last game of the 1971–72 regular season, the Flyers needed a win or a tie against the Sabres to beat out the Pittsburgh Penguins for the final playoff spot. The score was tied, but with just four seconds on the clock, Meehan took a shot from the top of the blue line that somehow got by Flyers goalie Doug Favell – ending the Flyers&#x27; season.

==Retirement==
After completing his undergraduate degree from Canisius College in Buffalo, Meehan graduated from the University at Buffalo School of Law in 1982. He practiced sports, corporate, and immigration law with the firm Cohen, Swados, Wright, Hanifin, Bradford and Brett, including working on player contracts with Scotty Bowman, then the Sabres&#x27; coach and general manager. Meehan had joined the firm hoping to work with the Sabres.

==General manager and VP==
In 1984, the team made Meehan the first former Sabre to serve in a front-office position, as assistant general manager under Bowman. During the 1986–87 season, Bowman stepped down, and Meehan was promoted to general manager. With the departures of Bowman and superstar Gilbert Perreault, the Sabres finished the season in last place overall that year, but rebounded the next year as NHL&#x27;s most improved team, with a record of 37–32–11 – and 21 points higher in the standings.

Meehan&#x27;s years as a general manager were marked by the addition of a number of top-caliber players, including No. 1 draft pick Pierre Turgeon, Soviet defector Alex Mogilny, Dale Hawerchuk, Pat LaFontaine, and Dominik Hašek. In 1993, Meehan was named the executive vice president of sports operations, taking a more active role in the organization&#x27;s business and legal affairs. 

In 1996, Gerry left the Sabres organization and founded GMM Consulting Services, now Cardinal Consultants Ltd., which provides a wide variety of consulting services to sports teams, leagues, associations, and athletes.

<text>Baby Looney Tunes is an American animated television series depicting toddler versions of several &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters. It was produced by Warner Bros. Animation as its first preschool animated series. The series focused on real world problems and morals that children may relate to, such as sharing, understanding emotions, and playing with others. The Looney Tunes babies first live with Granny, but starting in the fourth season, were cared for by babysitter Floyd, Granny&#x27;s nephew.

The show premiered as a full series on September 16, 2002, and ran on WB stations from 2002 to 2003. The show moved to Cartoon Network in 2002 (by following suit nine days later on September 16) where it remained until ending on April 20, 2005. It aired in reruns on Cartoon Network and also on Boomerang from 2005 to 2009, and again from 2015 to 2016. Reruns on Boomerang continued for some time until the mid 2020. 53 episodes were produced.

In 2003, a series of direct-to-video puppet films were produced, aimed at infants and toddlers. Two films were released, &quot;Baby Looney Tunes: Musical Adventures&quot; and &quot;Baby Looney Tunes: Backyard Adventures,&quot; featuring the same voice cast as the TV series. The films were never released on DVD. However, &quot;Baby Looney Tunes: Musical Adventures&quot; became available on HBO Max and Tubi later on. &quot;Baby Looney Tunes: Backyard Adventures&quot; was formerly available on Binge in Australia.

The series aired reruns again on the American version of Cartoonito on Cartoon Network starting on September 13, 2021, being the first show to air on that block.

==Episodes==

==Characters==
===Main===
* Baby Bugs (voiced by Sam Vincent) – He is known to be the oldest of the babies (but only just), which makes him their delegated leader. His leadership however does tend to cause arguments, especially with Daffy and Lola.
* Baby Daffy (voiced by Sam Vincent) – He is the second-in-command of the babies. When he does not get what he wants, he believes he is treated unfairly, not noticing the inconvenience inflicted on the others. But he does have a good heart. He is known to have a fear of robots, and quite frequently, he has made fun of Bugs by making fun of his name and other things.
* Baby Tweety (voiced by Sam Vincent) – A yellow canary. He is the youngest and smallest of the gang. Depicted as the logical thinker, because he comes up with ideas when the others are unable to. He is very insecure about his small build (which he must overcome in most episodes centered around him) and curious about what he encounters.
* Baby Lola (voiced by Britt McKillip) – Sometimes, she takes charge. Her independence is greater than the others and she has more boyish tendencies than all of the other girls, though she wears a purple bow in her hair.
* Baby Taz (voiced by Ian James Corlett) – Whilst less aggressive than his adult counterpart, Taz is mild-mannered, often mistakes various objects for food, and sometimes breaks things with his spin due to this. He has a sense of humor that exceeds all the others. He is sometimes more sensitive.
* Baby Sylvester (voiced by Terry Klassen) – A tuxedo cat who is often shy and anxious. He makes an easy target for Daffy to mock and take advantage of. He is rarely seen using his claws. He likes to get attention from Granny more than the others. Sylvester is afraid of lightning and he hates pickles.
* Baby Melissa (voiced by Janyse Jaud) – She often hangs out with Petunia; the two were abruptly added to the main cast early into the second season. She is a highly logical and practical girl with an easy-going personality, but at times she can be a control freak and clash with the others. She wears a green bow in her hair.
* Baby Petunia (voiced by Chiara Zanni) – She often hangs out with Melissa; the two were abruptly added to the main cast early into the second season. She is the most intelligent of the babies with an adventurous streak. Starting with the episode &quot;Business As Unusual&quot;, she (and other babies) wear no more diapers anymore, as by the time Petunia wears frilly yellow training panties with a white bow in the middle and &quot;Petunia the Piggy Bank&quot;, she learned to save money. She has her hair tied in pigtails with two orange hairbows.
* Granny (voiced by June Foray) – Granny is friendly, professional, intelligent, practical and level-headed. She offers unconditional love and care for the babies. Being the only adult in their lives, the babies are fascinated and inspired by her guidance, advice and ability to overcome problems when they arise with ease.
* Floyd Minton (voiced by Brian Drummond) – Granny&#x27;s nephew. Sometimes he is overwhelmed by the responsibility he takes on the babies, but he is determined never to let Granny down. He often keeps an eye on one of the individual babies in each episode during Season 4.

===Others===
Several other Looney Tunes characters have made cameos over the course of the show&#x27;s run, mainly as guest spots or during songs. Baby Marc Antony, Baby Prissy, and Baby Penelope appear in the songs, &quot;Paws and Feathers&quot;, &quot;Down by the Cage&quot;, and &quot;Vive Le Pew&quot; respectively. Baby Marvin (Sam Vincent), Baby Elmer (Brian Drummond), Baby Instant Martians, Baby Gossamer, and Baby Foghorn (Scott McNeil) appear in &quot;War of the Weirds&quot;, &quot;A Bully for Bugs&quot;, &quot;A Mid-Autumn Night’s Scream&quot;, &quot;Cock a Doodle Do It!&quot;, and &quot;Stop and Smell Up the Flowers&quot;, respectively. Baby Wile E. and Baby Road Runner appear in multiple songs, as do Baby Pepé (Terry Klassen), Baby Porky, and Baby Sam.
* Baby Marvin (voiced by Samuel Vincent) – An alien toddler from Mars. He appears in &quot;War of The Weirds&quot;. He is timid and meek but friendly Martian who was visiting for a while. The babies regarded him &quot;creepy&quot; and hesitated to befriend him, yet Taz was the only one who was kind to him. The babies eventually realize their error and receive him as a friend, and he finally speaks to them.
* Baby Elmer Fudd (voiced by Brian Drummond) – Appears as a baby in the songs, and as an older toddler in &quot;A Bully for Bugs&quot;. In his only proper episode, he was a bully who harassed Bugs and stole his candy, and was bullying the other babies too. In the end, he admits that he felt alone and actually wanted to be friends with them. The babies soon forgave him and accepted him as a friend.
* Baby Foghorn (voiced by Scott McNeil) – Appears in &quot;Cock a Doodle Do It&quot;. He&#x27;s a young, somewhat neurotic, farm rooster, who&#x27;s ostracized by the older roosters. The other babies visiting, helps him to gain self-confidence and win the other roosters&#x27; respect. At the end, he faces a dog with the help of his new friends, and finally becomes a respected member of the corral.
* Baby Pepé (voiced by Terry Klassen) – Appears first in &quot;New Cat in Town&quot; as a baby, and later in &quot;Stop and Smell Up the Flowers&quot; as an older toddler. In his first episode, the babies all mistook him for a cat and doted on him. Sylvester was initially jealous of him, but got over it when he heard Pepé say “Sylvester” as his first word. By his second appearance, he is working for a garden, but his skunk smell was an issue for the other babies, initially being put off by this. Eventually they apologize and truly accept him for who he is in the end. He is revealed to be friends with Baby Gossamer.

==Production==
In January 2002, it was announced Warner Bros. Animation would be developing a TV series featuring baby versions of the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters under the working title of &quot;Looney Tunes Babies&quot; The idea for the series came about from the successful &quot;Looney Tunes Lovables&quot;, later revamped as &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot; line of merchandise. 

As a cost saving measure, the show hired Canadian voice actors rather than the current voice actors for the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; characters with the exception of Granny&#x27;s actor June Foray who&#x27;d voiced the character since the 1950s. As the show was aimed at an audience of 2- to 5-year-olds the style of the show used softer water colors to reflect the gentler tone of the series. An educational expert also examined the series even though it wasn&#x27;t explicitly designed to be educational.

==Music==
Underscoring for the series was written by veteran animation composers Steven and Julie Bernstein. They were nominated for a Daytime Emmy (Outstanding Music Direction and Composition) in 2006. They also composed the score for the Easter movie, &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&#x27; Eggs-traordinary Adventure&quot;, writing the music and lyrics for the featured songs.

==Home media==
Warner Home Video has released 15 of the 53 episodes of &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot;, including the DVD of the only &quot;Baby Looney Tunes&quot; movie: &quot;Eggs-traordinary Adventure&quot;.

In the United Kingdom, 4 volumes were released on DVD from July 15, 2013. Each disc contains 4 half-hour episodes.

<text>The Da Vinci Hoax is a non-fiction book written by Carl E. Olsen and Sandra Miesel for the express purpose of critiquing Dan Brown&#x27;s novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot; The book was first published in 2004 by Ignatius Press. According to Olson and Miesel, they wrote it out of concern that Brown&#x27;s novel is popularizing theories, history and beliefs, which are used as the basis of the novel&#x27;s plot, and defended by its author as factual, and that purport to expose Christianity as founded on lies that have been kept secret by the Roman Catholic Church throughout the centuries.

The authors state that the theories, while presented as great revelations of hidden knowledge, are actually based on elements of gnostic and feminist ideas. They contend that the theories transparently contradict serious scholarship, and present detailed arguments and expositions against them.

==Quote from the book==

*&quot;The misrepresentation of Christian beliefs in &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot; is so aggressive and continual that we can only conclude that it is a result of willful ignorance or purposeful malice and hatred.&quot; (p. 37)

<doc id="921826" wikidata="Q535170" url="?curid=921826" title="Tech Romancer">
<text>is a 1998 3D fighting arcade game by Capcom that draws heavily from the various subgenres of mecha anime. It was later ported to the Dreamcast console. The player controls a giant robot which is used to fight another robot in one-on-one combat. Studio Nue designed the robots in this game.

==Story==
The setting of &quot;Tech Romancer&quot; takes place in a far future of Earth, where advanced technology have made things calm and decent for the citizens of Japan and the rest of the world. However, the peace doesn&#x27;t last long as an evil alien tyrant named Goldibus invades the planet with its loyal followers and seeks to conquer the world while enslaving the human race with an emotionless iron fist. An unlikely group of heroes band together to fight against the threat of Goldibus with their own unique mecha robots and all of them won&#x27;t rest until Goldibus is defeated and the world is safe from the imminent danger.

==Game modes==
The game is primarily played in two modes: Story Mode, and Hero Challenge Mode. The Dreamcast version also had minigames that could be played on the VMU for points.

===Story Mode===
Each mecha has its own story mode, which plays out like an anime series, with each battle broken up by an episode title, eyecatch, and dialog scenes before and after each battle. Each mecha has its own story (where it is the star of its own show), and decisions made in the dialog scenes, as well as the conditions under which a battle is won, can cause some stories to branch out and have multiple paths and endings. The other mecha and characters naturally make appearances, but their role may vary from their actual origins to fit the &quot;star&quot; mecha&#x27;s story.

===Hero Challenge Mode===
An &quot;Arcade-style&quot; mode where the player fights through each of the major mecha and bosses. Various hidden mecha and pilots found in the game can only be used in Hero Challenge Mode. In the Dreamcast version, points earned in Hero Challenge Mode and the VMU minigames could be used to purchase hidden characters including boss characters and movies.

===Matching Service===
In Japan, the game is re-released as &quot;Choukou Senki Kikaioh For Matching Service&quot; because of its online functionality.

==Gameplay==
Battles take place mostly on a flat 3D plane, with buildings and other terrain features scattered around. Destroying the terrain (by attacking or walking through them) releases power-ups, which include three weapons (vary between each character/mecha), armor or life powerups, and the Hero Mode powerup, which increases the power of your mecha&#x27;s attacks, and may also unlock additional abilities or moves.

Rather than rounds, the matches are decided by the life meters of the fighters. Each fighter has two life meters, and is destroyed when the second one is depleted. In addition, each mecha gets an armor gauge that, when broken by consistent brute attacks, lowers the mecha&#x27;s defense and makes it harder to recover from attacks received.

Each mecha has at least two super attacks, as well as a Final Attack, which is usable when the opponent is down to the last 50% of their second lifebar. This attack, when activated and successfully connected, automatically destroys the opponent, winning the battle.

==Reception==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed the arcade version in their November 15, 1998 issue as the fourth most-successful arcade game of the week.

The Dreamcast version received favorable reviews. In Japan, &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it a score of 29 out of 40, just one point away from &quot;Silver Awards&quot; Editors&#x27; Choice. Greg Orlando of &quot;NextGen&quot; said of the game, &quot;It&#x27;s not often when we get to step into our favorite anime and beat some metal ass. Now if only the fighting were as inspired as the off-the-wall anime plot...&quot; James Mielke of &quot;GameSpot&quot; described the game as &quot;a combination of great graphics and solid fighting fun&quot;. He noted that the game contains more replay value than &quot;JoJo&#x27;s Bizarre Adventure&quot;, &quot;Street Fighter III&quot;, and &quot;Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein&quot; combined. Anoop Gantayat of &quot;IGN&quot; described the game as having &quot;the greatest single player mode ever in a fighting game&quot; through both the game&#x27;s &quot;Power Stone&quot;-style rewards system and story mode which contained branching paths and multiple endings for the playable characters. BenT of &quot;PlanetDreamcast&quot; described the game as &quot;a great surprise from Capcom&quot; due to its Japanese anime stylings and superb character design, as well as the simple yet addictive gameplay, but criticized the overly simplistic gameplay and underwhelming graphics compare to other titles released for the Dreamcast around the same time (most notably &quot;Resident Evil – Code: Veronica&quot; which was also made by Capcom and &quot;MDK2&quot; from Bioware).

Kilo Watt of &quot;GamePro&quot; said of the game in one review, &quot;If you&#x27;re purely a fighting game fan or casual gamer, you might want to pass on &quot;Tech Romancer&quot; since it&#x27;s not the pinnacle of robot fighting. For avid mech anime fans, this is one of those games you&#x27;ve dreamed about.&quot; In another &quot;GamePro&quot; review, however, Jake The Snake said that the game &quot;will appeal to serious fighting game fans who like the anime-style mech basher, but casual button-mashers and mech game fans may want to pass or rent first.&quot;

&quot;GameRevolution&quot; listed &quot;Tech Romancer&quot; as 44th on their list of the 50 Worst Game Names Ever.

<text>Arthur Brown Jr. (May 21, 1874—July 7, 1957) was an American architect, based in San Francisco and designer of many of its landmarks. He is known for his work with John Bakewell Jr. as Bakewell and Brown, along with later works after the partnership dissolved in 1927.

==Career==
Brown was a member of Beta Theta Pi fraternity and graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1896, where he and his future partner, John Bakewell Jr. (1872–1963), also a member of Beta Theta Pi, were both protégés of famed Bay Area architect Bernard Maybeck. Brown went to Paris and graduated from the &quot;École des Beaux-Arts&quot; in 1901, attending the atelier of Victor Laloux, before returning to San Francisco to establish his practice with Bakewell in 1905.

Their first commissions included the interior of the City of Paris department store and the city hall for Berkeley, California, before entering the competition for the 1915 San Francisco City Hall for which they are best known. Brown also designed the city&#x27;s War Memorial Opera House and Veterans Building, the former in collaboration with G. Albert Lansburgh. Brown was meticulously trained in the rigorous Beaux-Arts tradition, and in the City Hall project his attention extended to the smallest details of light fixtures, floor patterning and doorknobs. 
In addition to their well-known monumental works, Bakewell and Brown designed several homes in the Arts and Crafts style championed by Maybeck. Early among them were two redwood framed &quot;double houses&quot; for Stanford University in 1908, and the only fraternity house they designed de novo, the Beta Chi Chapter House of Sigma Nu in 1910 (razed by the University in 1991 despite student and alumni efforts to give it historic designation and restore it). They later designed additions to Ernest Coxhead&#x27;s 1893 Beta Theta Pi house they had lived in as undergraduates, now a listed Berkeley landmark.

The firm went on to design a series of familiar San Francisco landmarks, and many buildings at Stanford University, before Brown dissolved the partnership in 1927. For contractual reasons many buildings at Stanford through the 1930s continued to be credited to both.

Bakewell and Brown also designed the Byzantine-inspired Temple Emmanuel (1926) at Lake St. and Arguello Blvd. in San Francisco, and the Pasadena City Hall (1927).

Most of Brown&#x27;s later San Francisco works employed a stripped-down classicism. The poured-concrete Art Moderne Coit Tower (1932), that crowns Telegraph Hill is an important Modernist landmark in the Bay Area. Coit Tower was the site of some of the first public works murals executed under the Public Works Administration, later known as the WPA. &quot;The primitive nature of Coit Tower would lend itself better to that sort of thing than other public buildings,&quot; was Arthur Brown&#x27;s first reaction to the project. Diego Rivera included Brown among the designers and craftsmen in his fresco mural of &quot;The Making of a Fresco Showing the Building of a City&quot; (1931).

In Washington, D.C., Brown designed the Interstate Commerce Commission Building, its near-twin the Department of Labor Building, and the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium. All three form part of the Federal Triangle, the largest construction project undertaken by the US Federal government prior to The Pentagon. Preliminary designs were begun in 1927, with construction in the Depression years between 1932 and 1934. The new buildings were to be designed to reflect the &quot;dignity and power of the nation.&quot;

Brown&#x27;s last works were primarily at UC Berkeley, where Brown served as campus planner and chief architect from 1936 to 1950. His principal buildings there include Sproul Hall, the Bancroft Library, and the Cyclotron Building, commissioned by Ernest Lawrence and J. Robert Oppenheimer.


Brown was elected a Fellow in the American Institute of Architects in 1930. Among the draftsmen in his office was Clarence W. W. Mayhew. In 1943, Brown was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate member, and became a full member in 1953.

<text>Hyndman is a Scottish surname.

==Origins==
The surname Hyndman has two origins. First, it may be an occupational surname, either from &#x27;farm labourer&#x27; + , or a variant of . Second, it may have originated from a nickname, possibly &#x27;courteous&#x27; + . Variant spellings include Hindman. Early records of bearers of the surname include a Hector Hyndman of Renfewshire in the &quot;Exchequer Rolls of Scotland&quot; for 1553.

The Scottish Register of Tartans lists three tartans for families named Hyndman. Two are restricted tartans: one for the family of Captain Henry Hyndman (1785–1849), the son of an East India Company colonel who settled in Hong Kong; the other for the family of Daniel Hyndman in Edinburgh and Ontario. The third, created for C. P. Hyndman (stated to be &quot;the first Hyndman to record arms in the Lyon Register since 1672&quot;), has a design chosen to reflect his family&#x27;s association with the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers and the town of Paisley, and by C. P. Hyndman&#x27;s wishes is available for all bearers of the surname born in Northern Ireland.

==Statistics==
The 1881 United Kingdom census found 338 bearers of the surname Hyndman, primarily in the west of Scotland. Statistics compiled by Patrick Hanks on the basis of the 2011 United Kingdom census and 2011 Ireland census showed 718 bearers of the surname on the island of Great Britain and 367 on the island of Ireland. In the United States, the 2010 Census found 1,054 people with the surname Hyndman, making it the 23,943rd-most-common surname in the country. This represented an increase from 1,038 (22,999th-most-common) in the 2000 Census. In both censuses, roughly nine-tenths of people with this surname identified as non-Hispanic White, and roughly six percent as non-Hispanic Black or African American.

<doc id="921858" wikidata="Q1150666" url="?curid=921858" title="World cinema">
<text>World cinema is a term in film theory in the United States that refers to films made outside of the American motion picture industry, particularly those in opposition to the aesthetics and values of commercial American cinema. The Third Cinema of Latin America and various national cinemas are commonly identified as part of world cinema. The term has been criticized for Americentrism and for ignoring the diversity of different cinematic traditions around the world.

==Types==
World cinema has an unofficial implication of films with &quot;artistic value&quot; as opposed to &quot;Hollywood commercialism.&quot; Foreign language films are often grouped with &quot;art house films&quot; and other independent films in DVD stores, cinema listings etc.
Unless dubbed into one&#x27;s native language, foreign language films played in English-speaking regions usually have English subtitles. Few films of this kind receive more than a limited release and many are never played in major cinemas. As such the marketing, popularity and gross takings for these films are usually markedly less than for typical Hollywood blockbusters. The combination of subtitles and minimal exposure adds to the notion that &quot;World Cinema&quot; has an inferred artistic prestige or intelligence, which may discourage less sophisticated viewers. Additionally, differences in cultural style and tone between foreign and domestic films affects attendance at cinemas and DVD sales.

Foreign language films can be commercial, low brow or B-movies. Furthermore, foreign language films can cross cultural boundaries, particularly when the visual spectacle and style is sufficient to overcome people&#x27;s misgivings. Films of this type became more common in the early 2000s, as &quot;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&quot;, &quot;Amélie&quot;, &quot;Brotherhood of the Wolf&quot;, &quot;Y Tu Mama Tambien&quot; and &quot;Talk to Her&quot; enjoyed great successes in United States cinemas and home video sales. The first foreign and foreign language film to top the North American box office was &quot;Hero&quot; in August 2004. &quot;The rule for foreign-language films is that if you&#x27;ve done $5 million or better (in United States cinemas), you&#x27;ve had a very nice success; if you do $10 (million) or better (in United States cinemas), you&#x27;re in blockbuster category,&quot; Warner Independent Pictures ex-president Mark Gill said in 2009.

On the other hand, English-dubbed foreign films rarely did well in United States box office (with the exception of anime films). The 1982 United States theatrical release of Wolfgang Petersen&#x27;s &quot;Das Boot&quot; was the last major release to go out in both original and English-dubbed versions, and the film&#x27;s original version actually grossed much higher than the English-dubbed version. Later on, English-dubbed versions of international hits like &quot;Un indien dans la ville&quot;, &quot;Godzilla 2000&quot;, &quot;Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Pinocchio&quot; and &quot;High Tension&quot; flopped at United States box office. When Miramax planned to release the English-dubbed versions of &quot;Shaolin Soccer&quot; and &quot;Hero&quot; in the United States cinemas, their English-dubbed versions scored badly in test screenings in the United States, so Miramax finally released the films in United States cinemas with their original language.

===Pioneering film-making on camera phones===
After the launching of high pixel camera phones, these are being widely used for filmmaking. The early films, made with camera phones are: New Love Meetings, a documentary film shot on Nokia N90, directed by Barbara Seghezzi and Marcello Mencarini in 2005 from Italy; Why Didn&#x27;t Anybody Tell Me It Would Become This Bad in Afghanistan, a docufiction film shot on Samsung, directed by Cyrus Frisch in 2007 from Netherlands; SMS Sugar Man, a narrative film shot on Sony Ericsson W900i, directed by Aryan Kaganof in 2008 from South Africa; Veenavaadanam a documentary film shot on Nokia N70, directed by Sathish Kalathil in 2008 from India; Jalachhayam a narrative film shot on Nokia N95, directed by Sathish Kalathil in 2010 from India. These are among the first noted experimental works with the first generation camera phones, which paved the way for other filmmakers across the globe.

Hooked Up, To Jennifer, Tangerine, 9 Rides, Unsane, High Flying Bird, Ghost, Pondicherry I WeirDo, Banger are some examples shot on iPhones.

<doc id="921865" wikidata="Q886194" url="?curid=921865" title="Beyond the Valley of the Dolls">
<text>Beyond the Valley of the Dolls is a 1970 American satirical musical melodrama film starring Dolly Read, Cynthia Myers, Marcia McBroom, Phyllis Davis, John LaZar, Michael Blodgett, Erica Gavin, and David Gurian. The film was directed by Russ Meyer and written by Roger Ebert from a story by Ebert and Meyer.

Originally intended as a sequel to the 1967 film &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; was instead revised as a parody of the commercially successful but critically reviled original. &quot;Beyond&quot; met a similar fate; critics initially panned it, but it became a box office success. The film developed a cult following in subsequent decades and earned some critical reappraisal for its satirical and metafictional elements.

==Plot==
Three young women—Kelly MacNamara, Casey Anderson, and Petronella &quot;Pet&quot; Danforth—perform in a rock band, the Kelly Affair, managed by Harris Allsworth, Kelly&#x27;s boyfriend. The four travel to Los Angeles to find Kelly&#x27;s estranged aunt, Susan Lake, heiress to a family fortune. After Susan promises Kelly a third of her inheritance, Porter Hall, her sleazy financial advisor, discredits Kelly as a &quot;hippie&quot; to dissuade Susan from dividing the fortune he secretly wants to embezzle.

Undeterred, Susan introduces the Kelly Affair to a flamboyant, well-connected rock producer, Ronnie &quot;Z-Man&quot; Barzell, who coaxes them into an impromptu performance at one of his outrageous parties (after a set by the real-life band Strawberry Alarm Clock). The band is so well-received that becomes their svengali manager, changing their name to the Carrie Nations and starting a long-simmering feud with Harris.

Kelly drifts away from Harris and dates Lance Rocke, a high-priced gigolo, who has his own designs on her inheritance. After losing Kelly, Harris is seduced by the sexually aggressive porn star Ashley St. Ives. She soon tires of his conventional nature and waning libido due to increasing drug and alcohol intake. Harris&#x27;s further descent into drug and alcohol use leads to a fistfight with Lance and a one-night stand with Casey, which results in pregnancy. Kelly ends her affair with Lance after he severely beats Harris.

Casey, distraught at getting pregnant and wary of men&#x27;s foibles, has a lesbian affair with fashion designer Roxanne, who pressures her to have an abortion. Pet has a seemingly enchanted romance with law student Emerson Thorne after a meet cute at one of parties. Their fairy-tale romance frays when Pet sleeps with Randy Black, a violent prize fighter who beats up Emerson and tries to run him down with a car.

Porter offers Kelly $50,000 to relinquish any claim to Susan&#x27;s inheritance. When Kelly angrily rejects his offer at one of parties, Susan learns of his underhanded ploy and severs her ties with him.

The Carrie Nations release several records despite constant touring and drug use. Upset at being pushed to the sidelines, Harris attempts suicide by leaping from the rafters of a sound stage during a television appearance by the band. Harris survives the fall but becomes paraplegic from his injuries.

Kelly devotes herself to caring for Harris, and Emerson forgives Pet for her infidelity. Casey and Roxanne share a tender romance, and Susan Lake is reunited with her former fiancé, Baxter Wolfe. This idyllic existence ends when invites Casey, Roxanne, and Lance to a psychedelic-fueled party at his house. After tries to seduce Lance, who spurns him, he reveals that he has breasts and is a female in drag. goes on a murderous rampage: he kills Lance with a sword, stabs his servant Otto to death, and shoots Roxanne and Casey, killing them.

Responding to a desperate phone call Casey made shortly before her death, Kelly, Harris, Pet, and Emerson arrive at house to subdue him. Pet is wounded in the melee, which ends in death. Harris is able to move his feet, which is the start of his recovery from paralysis. Three couples—Kelly and Harris, Pet and Emerson, and Susan and Baxter—wed while Porter watches from outside the courthouse window.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; was originally intended as a straightforward sequel to the 1967 film &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;.

Jacqueline Susann, author of the novel &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, had come up with the title while she was writing her second novel &quot;The Love Machine&quot;. Susann wrote a treatment for &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls,&quot; and by June 1968, Fox wanted &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; screenwriter Dorothy Kingsley to return to write the new film. However, Kinglsey was unavailable and busy on &quot;Bracken&#x27;s World&quot;. In November, it was reported that Barbara Parkins would return in the film, but Patty Duke and Sharon Tate would not.

In June 1969, Fox announced the film would be made in the next 18 months and would come from Irving Mansfield Productions; Irving Mansfield was the husband and agent of Jacqueline Susann. A script was written by Jean Holloway.

===Russ Meyer===
Two months later, Fox decided that Irving Mansfield would no longer make the film. Instead, they hired Russ Meyer, whose recent X-rated independent movie &quot;Vixen!&quot; had been a commercial success. Holloway&#x27;s script was discarded, and the film critic Roger Ebert, a friend of Meyer&#x27;s, took a five-week leave of absence from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; to write a script. Parkins was no longer attached to the film.

Meyer said Richard Zanuck, head of Fox, gave him a weekend to come up with an idea of how it could be done, &quot;stressing budget strongly in line with the whole ideas of making movies more cheaply&quot; and encouraging him to &quot;make an R film smashing against an X rating&quot;.

===Script===
Meyer says he and Ebert wrote a 127-page treatment in 10 days and the script in three weeks. Neither of them had read the novel, but they watched the 1967 film and used the same formula: &quot;Three young girls come to Hollywood, find fame and fortune, are threatened by sex, violence, and drugs, and either do or do not win redemption&quot;, according to Ebert. He later added: &quot;We would include some of the sensational elements of the original story- homosexuality, crippling diseases, characters based on &#x27;real&#x27; people, events out of recent headlines - but, again, with flat-out exaggeration&quot;.

The script was not only a spoof of the original film but also, in Ebert&#x27;s words, &quot;a satire of Hollywood conventions, genres, situations, dialogue, characters, and success formulas, heavily overlaid with such shocking violence that some critics didn&#x27;t know whether the movie &#x27;knew&#x27; it was a comedy&quot;.

Ebert said the plot was derived in collaboration &quot;by creating characters and then working out situations to cover the range of exploitable content we wanted in the film. Meyer wanted the film to appeal, in some way, to almost anyone who was under thirty and went to the movies. There had to be music, mod clothes, black characters, violence, romantic love, soap opera situations, behind-the-scenes intrigue, fantastic sets, lesbians, orgies, drugs and (eventually) an ending that tied everything together&quot;.

Meyer&#x27;s intention was for the film to &quot;simultaneously be a satire, a serious melodrama, a rock musical, a comedy, a violent exploitation picture, a skin flick, and a moralistic expose (so soon after the Sharon Tate murders) of what the opening crawl called &#x27;the oft-times nightmarish world of Show Business&#x27;&quot;.

Meyer submitted the script to Richard Zanuck at Fox in September, and Zanuck greenlit the film. Meyer said when Fox offered him the film, &quot;I felt like I had pulled off the biggest caper in the world&quot;. He described the film as &quot;a soap opera for young people, a cornocopia of wild, way-out now entertainment&quot;. Ebert later recalled:
At the time we were working on BVD I didn&#x27;t really understand how unusual the project was. But in hindsight I can recognize that the conditions of its making were almost miraculous. An independent X-rated filmmaker and an inexperienced screenwriter were brought into a major studio and given carte blanche to turn out a satire of one of the studio&#x27;s own hits. And BVD was made at a time when the studio&#x27;s own fortunes were so low that the movie was seen almost fatalistically, as a gamble that none of the more respectable studio executives really wanted to think about, so that there was a minimum of supervision (or even cognizance) from the Front Office.

===Character influences===
Roger Ebert revealed that many of the film&#x27;s themes and characters were based upon real people and events, but because neither Ebert nor Russ Meyer actually met these people, their characterizations were based on pure speculation.
* Ronnie &quot;Z-Man&quot; Barzell – the fictional eccentric rock producer turned Carrie Nations manager was loosely based on real-life producer Phil Spector. More than three decades later, Spector was convicted of murder after the body of Lana Clarkson was found at his mansion, which is somewhat reminiscent of the events of the film&#x27;s climax.
* Randy Black – the heavyweight champ character was loosely based on the real World Heavyweight Champion Muhammad Ali.
* The climactic, violent ending, which was not in the original script, was inspired by the real-life Tate-LaBianca murders perpetrated by members of the Manson Family. The film began production on December 2, 1969, shortly after the murders, which were covered heavily by the media. &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; star Sharon Tate was among the murder victims, as was Jay Sebring. Vocalist Lynn Carey, who was dating Sebring and had been invited to join him the night of the Tate-LaBianca murders, refused his invitation, according to her comments on the DVD extras.
* Porter Hall – this scheming lawyer shares the name of a character actor who often played movie villains.
* Susan Lake and Baxter Wolfe were, in an original draft script, Anne Welles and Lyon Burke from &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;. Their back-story stated in &quot;BVD&quot; (&quot;He proposed to her but it was the wrong time&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s been three years...&quot;), matches the ending of the original. Following Jacqueline Susann&#x27;s legal-action proceedings against 20th Century Fox, the characters were renamed and recast. Barbara Parkins, who played Anne, was originally under contract to appear in &quot;BVD&quot; and was disappointed when she was abruptly removed from the project. The special edition DVD features a screen test with Michael Blodgett and Cynthia Myers enacting the bedroom scene between Lance and Kelly. Based on an early script, the dialogue has them make reference to Anne Welles, not Susan Lake, as Kelly&#x27;s Aunt.

===Casting===
The cast was composed almost entirely of unknowns. Meyer said that &quot;&quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; plus my own name will be enough&quot;.

Meyer said they would not have used her if Parkins had wanted to do the film because she was too costly to hire.

Cynthia Myers was a &quot;Playboy&quot; Playmate hired to play one of the girls who realizes she&#x27;s a lesbian. In Meyer&#x27;s comment: &quot;It&#x27;s a loving and tender thing. It&#x27;s not &quot;The Killing of Sister George&quot;&quot;.

Edy Williams was under contract to Fox at the time.

Pam Grier made her film debut as an extra in a party scene.

===Shooting===
Meyer and Ebert kept the costs down by writing &quot;97 percent of the film&quot; for existing sets on the Fox backlot. Ebert said that &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; seemed &quot;like a movie that got made by accident when the lunatics took over the asylum&quot;. Ebert says Meyer &quot;directed his actors with a poker face, solemnly discussing the motivations behind each scene. Some of the actors asked me whether their dialogue wasn&#x27;t supposed to be humorous, but Meyer discussed it so seriously with them that they hesitated to risk offending him by voicing such a suggestion. The result is that BVD has a curious tone all of its own... from actors directed at right angles to the material&quot;.

Because the film was put together so quickly, some plot decisions, such as the character Z-Man being revealed as a woman in drag, were made on the spot, without the chance to align previous already-shot scenes with the new development. As they were shooting, the cast was uncertain whether the dialogue was intended to be comic, which would alter their approach to acting it. Because Meyer always discussed their roles and the film so seriously, they did not want to unintentionally insult him by asking, so they broached the question to Ebert instead. Meyer intended to have the actors straightforwardly perform the material because &quot;if the actors perform as if they know they have funny lines, it won&#x27;t work&quot;. Ebert described the resulting tone as &quot;curious&quot;.

In 1980, Ebert looked back on the film and said of it:
I think of it as an essay on our generic expectations. It&#x27;s an anthology of stock situations, characters, dialogue, clichés and stereotypes, set to music and manipulated to work as exposition and satire at the same time; it&#x27;s cause and effect, a wind-up machine to generate emotions, pure movie without message.

===Music and soundtrack===
Most of the film&#x27;s music was written by Stu Phillips. Phillips adapted Paul Dukas&#x27; &quot;The Sorcerer&#x27;s Apprentice&quot; for the psychedelic scene at Z-Man&#x27;s house near the film&#x27;s end.

Members of the fictitious Carrie Nations neither sing nor play their own instruments in the film. Vocals for the lip-synced songs were performed by Lynn Carey, a blue-eyed soul singer based in Los Angeles, together with Barbara Robison, the lead singer of Peanut Butter Conspiracy. Carey&#x27;s and Robison&#x27;s voices are showcased on the apocalyptic rocker &quot;Find It&quot; (by Stu Phillips and Carey), the earnest folk anthem &quot;Come With the Gentle People&quot; (by Stu Phillips and Bob Stone), the raunchy R&amp;B of &quot;Sweet Talking Candyman&quot; (by Phillips and Stone), the lilting ballad &quot;In the Long Run&quot; (by Phillips and Stone), and the soulful strut of &quot;Look On Up At the Bottom&quot; (also by Phillips and Stone). Carey also sings &quot;Once I had Love&quot;, written by Stu Phillips and herself.

Strawberry Alarm Clock performed their 1967 hit &quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot;, the mid-tempo rocker &quot;Girl from the City&quot; (written by Paul Marshall), and the power pop anthem &quot;I&#x27;m Comin&#x27; Home&quot; (also by Marshall) during the first party scene at Z-Man&#x27;s house. The film&#x27;s title song was performed by A&amp;M artists The Sandpipers and is heard twice near the end of the movie. The group released the song as a single and on their 1970 &quot;Come Saturday Morning&quot; LP.

Different versions of the soundtrack album exist because of disputes over royalties. CD &#x27;Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls / Groupie Girl - Original Film Score&#x27;, produced by the label: Screen Gold Records - SGLDCD00010, does not contain the original film versions; only the new recordings for the 1970 four-song LP, the Ami Rushes sings and two songs sung entirely by Barbara &quot;Sandi&quot; Robison. Due to contractual reasons, Lynn Carey was not allowed to sing on the LP recording, although she co-wrote and co-wrote a few songs and provided vocals for the film versions, along with Barbara &quot;Sandi Robison. So the film features the two of them, but the 1970 LP had Ami Rushes singing part of it.

However, on the 2003/4 Beyond the Valley of the Dolls CD, there are the original film versions, with Lynn Carey and Barbara &quot;Sandi&quot; Robison as bonus tracks. Released by the label Soundtrack Classics - SCL 1408 and Harkit Records - HRKCD 8032. The content of the songs is the same on both CDs. Both labels also released vinyl editions with different covers and extended songs compared to the 1970 LP. For the first time, all original versions of film songs are included.

Lynn Carey and Barbara Robison sang the original versions.

The CD, from the labels: Soundtrack Classics - SCL 1408 and Harkit Records - HRKCD 8032, is missing the song &quot;Once I Had Love&quot;, which is mentioned in the credits but not heard in the film itself. So this was only released on the 1970 LP and various reprints, on vinyl, only so far in the version with Lynn Carey, from the Harkit Records label HRKLP 8402, and so far only on the CD &quot;Beyond The Valley Of The Dolls / Groupie Girl - Original -Film soundtrack, from the label: Screen Gold Records - SGLDCD00010, in the version released with Barbara &quot;Sandi&quot; Robison.

The six songs, initially sung by Lynn Carey and Barbara Robison, are: &quot;Find It&quot;, &quot;In the Long Run&quot;, &quot;Sweet Talkin&#x27; Candyman&quot;, &quot;Come with the Gentle People&quot;, &quot;Look On Up At the Bottom&quot;, and &quot;Once I Had Love&quot;.

&quot;Incense and Peppermints&quot;, some incidental music, and the Strawberry Alarm Clock&#x27;s Hammond organ instrumental &quot;Toy Boy&quot; are missing from all soundtrack releases.

==Release==
The film had its world premiere at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood on June 17, 1970. Jacqueline Susann, the author of the unconnected novel &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, sought an injunction against its release but failed.

Initially the film was given an X rating by the MPAA; in 1990, it was reclassified as NC-17. Meyer&#x27;s response to the original X rating was to attempt to re-edit the film to insert more nudity and sex, but Fox wanted to get the movie released quickly and would not give him the time.

===Lawsuit===
Susann sued Fox for $10 million for damaging her reputation by making the film, saying that the &quot;sex exploitation film, employs total nudity and is scandalous of content&quot;.

As a result, the studio placed a disclaimer at the film&#x27;s beginning, informing the audience that the two films were not intended to be connected. Posters for the movie read, &quot;This is not a sequel—there has never been anything like it&quot;.

The suit did not go to trial until after Susann&#x27;s death in September 1974. Her estate won a $2 million verdict against the studio in August 1975.

===Home media===
&quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; was released as a two-disc, special-edition DVD set on June 13, 2006, and is now out of print.

==Reception==
===Critical reception===
The film was critically panned upon release. Ebert&#x27;s future TV co-host Gene Siskel gave the film zero stars out of four, writing in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; that the film &quot;unfolds with all of the humor and excitement of a padded bra ... Boredom aplenty is provided by a screenplay which for some reason has been turned over to a screenwriting neophyte&quot;. He later put it on his list of the 20 worst films of the year.

Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;comes off with a slightly higher rating&quot; than the original &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot; book and movie, but thought that by &quot;quite consciously attempting to parody his earlier movies&quot; Meyer had &quot;become patronizing&quot;.

&quot;Variety&quot; wrote that it was &quot;not much of a film. Producer-director Russ Meyer, who once made low-budget sex pix which had a crude and innocuous charm but not much of a story, this time around spent between 20 and 30 times the money he used to have, and got less for it&quot;.

Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; panned the film as &quot;a treat for the emotionally retarded, sexually inadequate and dimwitted. It is a grievously sick melange of hypermammalian girls, obvious double-entendres and sadistic violence&quot;.

Gary Arnold of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; declared it &quot;a mess, a disaster, a stinkeroo, the most wretched of wretched movies. Disregard anything you hear in the so-bad-it&#x27;s-good or it&#x27;s-all-a-put-on veins. It&#x27;s a depressing picture — witless, hysterical, gratuitous, technically inept, needlessly brutal&quot;. Mike Wallington of &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; called it &quot;corny, moralising, guileless, and visually about as appealing as a Christmas wrapper. It is also perversely enjoyable if one is prepared to laugh at it as well as with it&quot;.

John Waters has expressed admiration for the film, citing it as &quot;one of the best movies ever made&quot;.

Since its release in 1970, the film has acquired a cult following and has even been included in various &quot;best of&quot; lists by movie critics. The reviews have improved to become more mixed, with critics agreeing it was much better than the film it parodied. In 2000, Canadian magazine &quot;Take One&quot; included it in their &quot;Best Films of the 1970s&quot; critics poll. In 2001, the &quot;Village Voice&quot; named the film #87 on its list of the 100 Greatest Films of the Century. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds a rating of 77% from 30 reviews. The critical consensus reads: &quot;Confidently campy and played with groovy conviction, &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; is an exuberant expression of both the hilarity and terror that comes with free love&quot;.

===Box office===
According to Fox records, the film required $4,100,000 in theatrical rentals to break even. By December 11, 1970, it had made $7,000,000, more than enough to be profitable for the studio.

Despite an X rating and a modest budget of $900,000, &quot;Beyond the Valley of the Dolls&quot; grossed ten times that amount in the U.S. market, qualifying it as a hit for Fox. In 1997, when Roger Ebert &amp; Gene Siskel were guests on Howard Stern, Ebert claimed it made $55 million. In 2004, Ebert claimed it had grossed $40 million.

The production of the film, along with &quot;Myra Breckinridge&quot;, helped lead to the ousting of Richard Zanuck from Fox.

<doc id="921874" wikidata="Q4501243" url="?curid=921874" title="Milton S. Eisenhower">
<text>Milton Stover Eisenhower (September 15, 1899 – May 2, 1985) was an American academic administrator. He served as president of three major American universities: Kansas State University, Pennsylvania State University, and Johns Hopkins University. Eisenhower was also the head of the U.S. delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). He was the youngest brother of, and advisor to, U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower.

==Early life and education==
He was born as the seventh boy in Abilene, Kansas, to Ida Elizabeth Stover (1862–1946) and David Jacob Eisenhower (1863–1942); the family was poor. His mother had wanted a girl, and so she treated young Milton as female until, according to the family, it became embarrassing. Eisenhower attended public schools and graduated from Kansas State University in 1924 with a Bachelor of Science degree in industrial journalism.

== Career ==

After graduating from undergrad at Kansas State, Eisenhower was assistant to the American consul in Dunfermline, Scotland from 1924 to 1926.

===U.S. Department of Agriculture===
Eisenhower served as Director of Information for the U.S. Department of Agriculture from 1928 to 1941, where he was a spokesman for the New Deal under Henry A. Wallace. Previously he had been secretary to the Secretary of Agriculture William Marion Jardine, since September 1926 who had also been the college president while he was an undergraduate at Kansas State. He also was a key member of the Department of Agriculture&#x27;s Employee Organization, the Organization of Professional Employees of the United States Department of Agriculture (OPEDA).

===World War II===
Early in 1942, he was appointed director of the War Relocation Authority, the U.S. government agency responsible for the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Eisenhower was opposed to the mass incarceration, and at initial meetings with pro-exclusion officials he suggested allowing women and children to remain on the West Coast, but the proposal was rejected. In his position as WRA director, he attempted to mitigate the consequences of the &quot;evacuation,&quot; establishing a Japanese American advisory council with Mike Masaoka, a work program that allowed some Japanese Americans to leave camp for employment on labor-starved farms, and a student leave program that allowed Nisei who had been enrolled in college to continue their education. He also tried to get the Federal Reserve Bank to protect the property that Japanese Americans were forced to leave behind, and to convince governors of states outside the exclusion zone to allow Japanese Americans to resettle there, but these efforts were largely unsuccessful. 

In the 1943 government propaganda film, &quot;Japanese Relocation&quot; he said, &quot;This picture tells how the mass migration was accomplished. Neither the Army, nor the War Relocation Authority relish the idea of taking men, women and children from their homes, their shops and their farms. So, the military and civilian agencies alike determined to do the job as a democracy should – with real consideration for the people involved.&quot; Eisenhower resigned after only ninety days, and from June 1942 to mid-1943 he was associate director of the Office of War Information.

===College administrator===
In May 1943, Eisenhower became President of Kansas State University (his alma mater), a position he held until 1950. During this time, he also served as the first Chairman of the U.S. National Commission for UNESCO. In this role, Eisenhower sought to also establish a UNESCO commissions for each state. He personally organized the first such commission, in Kansas. As head of the U.S. delegation to UNESCO, Eisenhower appealed to the people of the United States to &quot;send aid at once to the refugees of the Palestine war in the Middle East.&quot; He had seen &quot;the sea of suffering humanity&quot; and appealed to Americans to send clothing, food, and money to relieve the refugees. He warned in December 1948 that &quot;If aid is not given to these unfortunate people, thousands of them are going to be freezing to death and dying of hunger and malnutrition. They nearly all are Arabs.&quot; Eisenhower also sought to create more opportunity for African Americans at Kansas State, pushing for the racial integration of the Big Seven Conference (later Big Eight Conference) in 1949.

Eisenhower was often referred to as &quot;Doctor.&quot; However, he did not hold an earned doctoral degree; instead, he had received an honorary doctorate of humane letters from the University of Nebraska in 1949. After leaving Kansas State University in 1950, Eisenhower served as president at two other universities: Pennsylvania State University from 1950 to 1956 and Johns Hopkins University from 1956 to 1967 and 1971 to 1972.

In July 1956, Milton Eisenhower assumed the presidency of Johns Hopkins University, succeeding Lowell J. Reed. During Eisenhower&#x27;s first term, University income tripled and the endowment doubled. More than $76 million in new buildings were constructed, including the Milton S. Eisenhower Library, completed in 1964 and named for Eisenhower in 1965. Respected and admired by faculty and students alike, Eisenhower was arguably the most popular Hopkins president since Daniel Coit Gilman. He kept office hours when any student could drop in, and he was welcome at students&#x27; off-campus parties.

When Eisenhower retired in 1967, he was given the title &quot;president emeritus&quot; in recognition of his service. In March 1971, after Lincoln Gordon&#x27;s abrupt resignation, the trustees asked Eisenhower to return until a permanent successor could be found. He reluctantly agreed to return, making it clear that the search for a permanent successor must begin immediately. His second administration, lasting ten months, required him to reduce a large deficit and slow the growth of the University&#x27;s administration. His reputation for fairness helped greatly in that turbulent time, and, despite the budgetary problems, he was able to push forward with planning and design for a new student center. In January 1972, he was succeeded as president by Steven Muller, who (although hired by Lincoln Gordon) had served a ten-month &quot;apprenticeship&quot; under Eisenhower as vice president and provost. Eisenhower enjoyed a second active retirement until his death on May 2, 1985.

===Political career===
In 1956 during the re-election campaign of his brother Dwight, Milton&#x27;s influence over Latin American foreign policy became a campaign issue. Democrat nominee Adlai Stevenson II claimed that Milton exerted undue influence over Latin American policy with the State Department, a claim which was denied by John Foster Dulles.

He served as a presidential adviser in the administrations of his brother Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953–1961), John F. Kennedy (1961–1963) and Lyndon B. Johnson (1963–1969). In 1968, he was appointed chairman of the National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence by President Johnson.

Following the Bay of Pigs in 1961, President Kennedy asked Eisenhower, Eleanor Roosevelt, and labor leader Walter Reuther to negotiate the release of captured Americans with Cuban leader Fidel Castro.

In 1964 Milton Eisenhower was lightly considered and named by brother Dwight as a potential candidate for President of the United States, opposing the forces behind eventual nominee Barry Goldwater.

In 1980, Eisenhower appeared on the ballot in Texas as the running mate of Representative John B. Anderson, Independent candidate for U.S. President.

==Personal life==
On October 12, 1927, Eisenhower married Helen Elsie Eakin (1904–1954), with whom he had a son, Milton Stover Eisenhower, Jr. (1930–2002), and a daughter, Ruth Eakin Eisenhower (1938–1984).

While attending college at Kansas State University, Eisenhower was a member of the fraternities Delta Sigma Pi, Phi Kappa Phi, Sigma Alpha Epsilon and Sigma Delta Chi. He was also the editor of the campus newspaper, the &quot;Collegian&quot;.

Eisenhower died of cancer in Baltimore, Maryland, on May 2, 1985.

== Legacy ==
* The Milton S. Eisenhower Library of Johns Hopkins University, opened in 1964 and containing 2.5 million volumes, is named after him. It has the unusual feature of being almost entirely underground (because of the slope of the site where it was built). The south wall is entirely windows.
* The primary research facility at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory was previously named the Milton S. Eisenhower Research Center (now the Research and Exploratory Development Department).
* The Milton S. Eisenhower Auditorium, a 2,595-seat center for the performing arts on the University Park campus of Penn State, opened in 1974. Eisenhower Chapel, on the same campus, is named for his wife, Helen Eakin Eisenhower.
* Eisenhower Hall, opened in 1951 on the Kansas State campus, is also named in his honor. It is home to the College of Arts and Sciences dean&#x27;s office and the departments of History and Modern Languages. 
The Milton S. Eisenhower Symposium is an acclaimed, student-organized lecture series founded in 1967 at Johns Hopkins University. All events take place on the Homewood campus in Shriver Hall and are free and open to the public.

<text>Cradle 2 the Grave is a 2003 American action film directed by Andrzej Bartkowiak. It stars Jet Li and DMX. The film follows the story of Tony Fait (DMX), a skilled jewel thief who finds himself entangled in a dangerous situation when a heist goes wrong. During a robbery, Tony inadvertently steals a cache of black diamonds sought after by a ruthless crime lord named Ling (Mark Dacascos). To retrieve the diamonds, Ling kidnaps Tony’s daughter, compelling him to team up with a Taiwanese intelligence officer named Su (Jet Li). Together, Tony and Su navigate the underworld of Los Angeles, facing off against formidable adversaries and executing daring heists to rescue Tony’s daughter and thwart Ling’s nefarious plans.

The film was released in the United States on February 28, 2003. Despite receiving generally negative critic reviews, it grossed $56 million worldwide, making it a modest success.

==Plot==
Anthony Fait and his crew of thieves attempt to steal diamonds for a Frenchman named Christophe, who serves as the middleman for a mysterious employer. When Fait contacts Christophe, a Taiwanese intelligence agent named Su intercepts the conversation and attempts to identify the criminals.

While the crew gathers up as many diamonds as they can, including a bag of black diamonds, Agent Su calls Fait and demands that he and his crew leave the diamonds in the vault, warning him that the police are on the way. However, Fait ignores this warning, and the criminals attempt a daring escape past a SWAT team blockade. While Fait, and his crew members Daria and Tommy, all manage to escape, Agent Su captures Miles and recovers Miles&#x27; share of the diamonds. Su is disappointed to find that Miles does not have the black diamonds though. Meanwhile, Fait asks his friend Archie to appraise the black diamonds he had stolen. Arriving at the San Francisco International Airport, Christophe&#x27;s mysterious employer, Ling, is informed by his assistant Sona, that Christophe has been attacked and that Fait and his gang have taken the black diamonds.

Later that night, Fait runs into Su. During this inadvertent meeting, Fait receives a phone call from Ling, who demands that Fait hand over the black diamonds. Fait refuses and is subsequently attacked by two of Ling&#x27;s henchman. With Su&#x27;s help, he defeats them and escapes. After the fight, Archie tells Fait that some gangsters came to his workshop and demanded the black diamonds as well. After some hesitation, Archie admits that he gave the stones to the gangsters to spare his own life. Fait also receives another call from Ling, who has kidnapped Fait&#x27;s daughter, Vanessa, to persuade Fait to give up the diamonds. Now with a common enemy, Fait and Su team up to recover the diamonds from the gangsters and rescue Vanessa from Ling.

Fait visits jailed crime lord &quot;Jump&quot; Chambers, most likely the employer of the gangsters who had robbed Archie. When Chambers refuses to cooperate, Fait goes to Chambers&#x27; night club, hoping to find the stones somewhere in his office. The plan goes awry, and Fait and the gang have to leave empty-handed. Meanwhile, Su and Archie go to an underground club to try to find the gangsters who attacked Archie. Because the club does not allow guests, Su is forced to enter as a fighter in the club&#x27;s fighting ring. During Su&#x27;s fight, Archie sees the man they are looking for, recognizing the man&#x27;s ring. Through this informant, they learn that the diamonds are hidden in the bubble bath in Chamber&#x27;s office. When they return to the nightclub to retrieve the diamonds, they find that Ling&#x27;s men have already taken the stones. Meanwhile, while locked in a van, Vanessa, who has been bound and gagged with duct tape frees herself, and finds a cell phone to call her father. Just before the phone&#x27;s battery runs out, Vanessa gives some clues as to her location. With these clues, the gang surmises that Vanessa is being held in an airport hangar.

Realizing that Ling will want to auction off the stones, which are actually weapons of mass destruction, the group searches flight schedules to find an airport where a large number of private flights will be landing that night. Finding the right airport, the group races to the hangar. While driving to the hanger Fait learns from Su that he and Ling are former childhood best friends, that they both joined the government at the same time but Ling&#x27;s thirst for money and power led him to take out they&#x27;re entire task team but Su managed to escape. The group arrives at wick airfield, where Ling&#x27;s auction is already starting. A fight ensues, and Fait and his crew take out members of Ling&#x27;s team, while Su battles Ling in a one on one fight. Eventually, Vanessa is rescued and Ling is killed after Su forces him to swallow a capsule of synthetic plutonium and then breaks the capsule lodged in his neck. When the police arrive, Fait promises to end his criminal career in order to lead a safe and happy life with Vanessa.

<text>The Nickey line (also known as the Harpenden to Hemel Hempstead branch railway) is a disused railway that once linked the towns of Hemel Hempstead and Harpenden (initially Luton), via Redbourn, in Hertfordshire, England. The former trackbed has been redeveloped as a rail trail and is part of the Oxford to Welwyn Garden City route of the National Cycle Network. It is approximately long.

== Toponymy ==
The origin of the nickname &quot;Nickey line&quot; is shrouded in obscurity. Suggestions include being named after the parish of St Nicholas in Harpenden, through which it runs; Hemel&#x27;s connection with Nicholas Breakspear; the knickerbockers worn by the navvies who constructed the line; or &quot;down the nick&quot;, a slang term of engine drivers which meant &quot;to run out of steam&quot; and may have been applicable on the line&#x27;s difficult inclines.

The spelling of the line&#x27;s name is recorded as appearing as &quot;Nickey&quot; on signs and tickets for special trains and in the local press; when the line was converted to a shared-use path, the signs which were erected omitted the &quot;e&quot; in the legend &quot;&quot;Nicky&quot; Line Footpath and Cycleway&quot;. The line is commemorated in the modern Marlowes pedestrianisation scheme by a children&#x27;s playground train and a sign labelled &quot;Nicky Line Halt&quot;, though no such named station ever existed.

Another possible origin for the name is that the navvies who constructed the line gave it the nickname as the steep climb from the old A6 road (now the A1081) in Harpenden up to the Roundwood Halt is a 1 in 37 gradient, the same as the railway incline called the &quot;Lickey Incline&quot; south of Birmingham.

The local paper notes that the engines themselves were referred to as &quot;Puffing Annies&quot; by locals, as the climb from the town centre up through Highfield was steep; the engines created much steam and smoke ascending this incline. Older generations in Hemel still refer to the line as the &quot;Puffing Annie&quot;, rather than the Nickey line.

==Early proposals==

In 1837, the London and Birmingham Railway opened the first stretch of the main line from to Birmingham Curzon Street as far as Hemel Hempstead (today&#x27;s West Coast Main Line), with the line fully opened as far as Birmingham in 1838. The L&amp;BR&#x27;s construction had been delayed for several years by vigorous lobbying by a number of powerful and well-connected local landowners, including the eminent surgeon Sir Astley Cooper of Gadebridge House, who were all keen to protect their estates from invasion by the &quot;iron horse&quot;. Their campaign was successful and the main line was routed along the River Bulbourne instead of the River Gade, skirting around the edge of Hemel Hempstead. As a result, the railway station serving Hemel Hempstead was built one mile outside the town centre at Boxmoor; &quot;Boxmoor and Hemel Hempstead&quot; railway station (today&#x27;s Hemel Hempstead railway station) opened in 1837.

The first proposal for a more convenient rail link for the townspeople of Hemel Hempstead was presented in 1862 by John Grover. His proposal was for a short spur from the main line at Boxmoor, following the route of the River Gade to the lower end of the (old) town at Bury Mill End. At the same meeting, another (more ambitious) proposal was put forward by a Mr Stocken and a Mr Stallon, extending the line to Redbourn to link to the Great Northern Railway at Harpenden. However, Grover&#x27;s design found a sponsor and, following an act of Parliament in 1863, the &quot; and London &amp; North Western Railway Company&quot; (HH&amp;L&amp;NWR) was formed to construct and operate the line. However, no construction work was undertaken due to difficulties with local landowners and problems agreeing the connection to the main line at Boxmoor; after a number of years of stagnation the earlier proposals were re-examined.

By 1865, the Midland Railway was developing its route out of , opening up new interchange possibilities to the north of Hemel Hempstead. A new railway scheme was put forward by engineers G.W. Hemans and A. Ormsby, which followed the original HH&amp;L&amp;NWR plan as far as Hemel but involved tunnelling under Highfield to connect to the MR at Harpenden, with an option to extend (via another tunnel) to on the GNR&#x27;s Hertford, Luton &amp; Dunstable branch. The tunnelling proposals proved to be prohibitively expensive, and further opposition from landowners resulted in the scheme being rejected by Parliament in 1865. With the assistance of Grover, the plans were revised and resubmitted for Parliamentary approval which was obtained in 1866. The railway company had meanwhile already commenced construction work in anticipation of approval. The new line was to follow the route authorised in 1863 through Hemel Hempstead and Redbourn, before curving north around Harpenden, crossing the turnpike road (A1081) and passing under the Midland line to connect with the GNR at Harpenden East, with provision for a spur to connect to the MR line north of Harpenden Central.

==Construction and opening==
Construction proceeded extremely slowly, the lower spur from Boxmoor to Hemel Hempstead only being completed by 1871, though the connection to Boxmoor was via an awkward turntable arrangement. Eventually, the HH&amp;L&amp;NWR company ran into financial difficulties and it was the Midland Railway that came to the rescue, financing completion of the line and agreeing to operate it once it was built. At this time, the transporting of goods and coal was the primary driving factor in the development of railways rather than commuter rail. The thriving hat making industry in Luton created demand for a transport link with the straw plait trade that existed in Hemel and, as a result, the initial connection with the MR at Harpenden headed north towards Luton rather than south towards London. Passengers travelling on this route changed trains at to reach London. The connection to the GNR&#x27;s line at Harpenden East was never achieved.

The line was finally opened on 16 July 1877 to great fanfare with celebrations led by the Berkhamsted Rifle Corps Band. A special train was laid on from Hemel to Luton and champagne receptions were held in Luton and Hemel town halls. Church bells were rung and a banner hung across Alexandra Road in Hemel proclaimed &quot;Success to the Hemel Hemptead and Midland Railway Company.&quot;

When it opened, the new line did not extend as far as Boxmoor, but terminated in Hemel Hempstead. Relations between the Hemel Hempstead Company and the LNWR (which had absorbed the London and Birmingham Railway in 1846) were difficult. The LNWR regarded the Hemel Hemptead and Midland Railway route to St Pancras as a threat to their service into Euston. The two companies could not reach an agreement to connect the Nickey line to the LNWR main line because of this intense rivalry. Instead, the southern terminus for the Hemel line was originally &quot;&quot; (known locally as the Midland Station), and this served as the main passenger facility within the town. This railway station stood at the junction of Midland Road and Adeyfield Road, opposite the Midland Hotel; today, the site is occupied by a modern housing development, although the hotel still exists.

The section of line south of this remained disused until 1880, when the Midland Railway opened the line to provide coal trains to the Duckhall gasworks near to Boxmoor. A connection was constructed as far as the LNWR sidings at Boxmoor; the Nickey line ran along a cutting, rising up to the main line level and under the northernmost arch of the Roughdown Road bridge. A Midland Railway trespass notice was affixed to this bridge, indicating the limit of extent of the company&#x27;s property. For a few years, the Nickey Line was connected to the Boxmoor goods yard via a turntable, but the LNWR removed it in 1897, severing the connection with the main line.

Rivalry between the LNWR and the Midland Railway grew intense in the 1880s. On one occasion, when a Midland Railway locomotive entered the LNWR siding at Boxmoor, the track was lifted by angry LNWR workers to prevent it from completing it journey. The LNWR began to operate a regular horse bus service to transport passengers from the town centre to the main line station at Boxmoor, where they could take trains to . These passengers were able to reach London St Pancras more quickly via the Hemel Hempstead Company&#x27;s line. Competition increased further when the Hemel Hempstead Motor Car Company started to run a motor bus service to Boxmoor, and this was later taken on by the LNWR in place of its equestrian service. In 1906 the Midland Railway extended passenger services along the Nickey line as far as Heath Park Halt, a high-level railway station which was located on a viaduct extending across Marlowes, close to the present-day site of the former Kodak headquarters building. Additional halts were built on the line at Beaumont&#x27;s Halt and Godwin&#x27;s Halt.

Eventually, the straw plait trade declined and the need for goods trains gave way to passenger demand; local businessmen wanted a fast route into London without having to go via Luton. In order to help the line pay its way, the junction at Harpenden was realigned in 1888 so that it headed south instead of north; passengers now changed trains at Harpenden Junction.
===Stations===
The full list of stations on the route is:


Heath Park Halt was the terminus for passenger services, which opened on 9 August 1905. Passenger services were withdrawn 16 June 1947 and the railway station closed with the line in 1959. Nothing of the station now remains, although its site may be seen at the junction of St. John&#x27;s Road and Corner Hall Road with Station Road. A combined iron drinking fountain and gas lamp still stands near the site of the now demolished Heath Park Hotel, which had stood directly opposite the railway station.

==Grouping==
After the First World War, Britain&#x27;s railway companies were failing commercially and making losses. In 1923, the railways were merged into the &quot;Big Four&quot; in the Grouping of the British railway companies. Former competitors, Midland and LNWR, were absorbed into the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS); the Nickey line and the neighbouring main lines at Boxmoor and Harpenden all became part of the same organisation. A new railway station was opened at Roundwood Halt in 1927.

== Ro-Railer trials ==
The LMS also inherited the bus service which the LNWR had been running from into Hemel town centre; rather than transfer passenger traffic to the Nickey line, the LMS decided to extend the bus service to run from Boxmoor to Harpenden instead, duplicating the railway route which it then reduced to two trains per day.

In 1930, the LMS experimented with new transport technology in an attempt to reduce costs and to rationalise its bus and rail operation through Hemel Hempstead. The Nickey line was used to trial a hybrid road–rail vehicle system called the &quot;Ro-Railer&quot;, a bus that could travel on both roads and railways. The experiment was short-lived and did not catch on.

== Decline and closure ==
Passenger demand was never high and further declined during the inter-war years. The rivalry between the Midland and LNWR railway companies had ensured that the line ultimately failed to serve the people of Hemel Hempstead in the most useful way possible; the bus service continued under the LMS had shifted passenger demand away from the railway and onto the road. By the end of 1946, the only regular rail passengers on the Harpenden service were six schoolchildren. The LMS also moved its main goods operation from Hemel Hempstead to Boxmoor; it was only the demand for coal supplies to the Duckhall gasworks that kept the Nickey line operational. During the harsh winter of 1946–47, a national coal shortage hit the British economy and passenger trains were &quot;temporarily&quot; suspended. As it turned out, the service was never to be reinstated and the last passenger service on the Nickey line ran on 16 June 1947.

In 1948, the nationalisation of the railways was enacted; the LMS and other railway companies were absorbed into the new state-owned corporation British Railways. Goods traffic continued to decline on the Nickey line and, in 1959, the stretch of track between railway station and the Duckhall gasworks was taken over by the Hemel Hempstead New Town Development Corporation. Hemel had been designated for redevelopment as a New Town in post-Second World War regeneration; plans were in place to demolish the viaduct crossing the lower end of Marlowes, severing the Nickey line link with the Midland Main Line. In order to maintain the supply of coal to the gasworks, new track was laid at Boxmoor joining the Nickey line to the West Coast Main Line, via a siding. The connection of the Nickey line to the former LNWR line, which had so long been a bone of contention among competing railway companies, was finally achieved. It was not to last long; this service ran for all of six months in 1959 before the gasworks shut down and the link was closed. A year later, on 2 July 1960, the Marlowes railway viaduct was demolished and the removal of the Nickey Line had begun. Many people turned out to witness the demolition of this local landmark and the event was well recorded in photographs.

The closure of the remaining parts of the line continued in stages; railway station closed in 1963, followed by Godwin&#x27;s Halt in 1964; cuttings were filled in and commercial buildings and housing estates were built on the former railway land. The line between Cupid Green (north of Godwin&#x27;s Halt) and Harpenden survived for some more years, however, having been leased by British Rail in 1968 to the Hemelite concrete company who continued to use the line privately to transport raw materials for manufacturing building blocks via Harpenden to their works at Claydale. Hemelite&#x27;s goods operations continued on this line until British Rail decided that the branch line should close. The junction with the Midland Main Line at Harpenden Junction was severed on 1 July 1979. The last journey on the line was made by a Hemelite Drewry locomotive, which was taken off the tracks at Redbourn and transported by lorry to work on the Yorkshire Dales Railway. Track lifting was undertaken in 1982, with the trackbed being converted into a public footpath in the following year.

It is notable that, prior to Hemel Hempstead being chosen as the site for a new town, Redbourn was also considered. Had this occurred, then the Nickey line would have been significantly upgraded to provide a link between the West Coast Main Line at Hemel Hempstead and a new railway station at Redbourn.

==Preservation==
The course of most of the railway has been redeveloped as a shared-use path by St Albans District Council and Dacorum Borough Council. It was opened in 1985, as the &quot;Nicky Line&quot;, though later corrected to the &quot;Nickey Line&quot;. It is part of Route 57 of the National Cycle Network (the Oxford to Welwyn Garden City route) and is approximately long.

Since much redevelopment of the town took place subsequent to its closure, the course of the lower part of the line is hard to follow nowadays. The course of the connection from Boxmoor is discernible in places; the gasholders at Duckhall are still present and the boundaries delineate the curve of the original trackbed. The abutment of the bridge that crossed the A41 is still present on the northern side, followed by a few hundred yards of heavily wooded embankment which still have one or two remaining sleepers. Remains of the brick-built bridges crossing the Bulbourne and Grand Union Canal are indistinct but discernible, but the remainder of the embankment to Heath Park has been levelled and landscaped as a public park and cricket pitches. 

From Heath Park, the line went roughly to the site of the present day &quot;Magic Roundabout&quot;, where it crossed the lower end of Marlowes over a viaduct. From there, it followed a course roughly where the modern day Maynard Road runs (an unsurfaced car park locates a 200m section of the former railway), through the site of Hemel Hempstead Hospital (the hospital existed when the railway was active, but was far smaller; the line passed to its east), through the housing developments of Concorde Drive (the former Hemel Hempstead (Midland) Station), to cross under Midland Road next to the Midland Hotel. 

From this point, the course of the line is easier to follow, as much of it still exists as footpaths. The Midland Road bridge is still extant, though now largely buried. The line can be traced easily across Keen&#x27;s Fields, to cross Queensway on a high-level brick arch bridge which is still complete. From there, the line tracks through Highfield and the course follows a well-maintained path all the way up to Cupid Green. This part of the line once again becomes obscured by modern developments, such as a car dealership and a modern industrial estate. Here once stood &quot;Godwin&#x27;s Halt&quot;, a very minor railway station named for a former landowner of the area. The original bridge at Godwins Halt remains, though again largely filled in. It carries a footpath between Highfield and Pennine Way, which is a lane predating the redevelopment of Hemel Hempstead new town.

The line becomes easier to follow a few hundred yards further on, since this part of the line was open until 1979. From here, the line crosses largely open country, roughly parallel with the main Redbourn road. Most bridges are still intact and have been maintained as part of the cycle route. The modern Redbourn by-pass, built in the 1980s, cuts across the route several times and there are no separate bridges. The wrought iron bridge carrying the line across the A5 at Redbourn remains intact. This bridge is of a type identical to those originally crossing the Bulbourne and the canal at Boxmoor. There was once a railway station at Redbourn, just beyond this point, but very little evidence of this remains; the site is marked with an information board today. The route then crosses more open countryside, including fields belonging to the Rothamsted Experimental Station, to Harpenden, where it crosses over the main London road on a brick arch bridge, to connect with the Midland Main Line. The course of the original connection towards Luton is also discernible.

<text>The 1994 [[Commonwealth Games]] (French: &quot;XVéme Jeux du Commonwealth&quot;) were held in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, between 18 and 28 August 1994. Ten types of sports were featured at the Victoria Games: athletics, aquatics, badminton, boxing, cycling, gymnastics, lawn bowls, shooting, weightlifting, and wrestling. These were the fourth and most recent Commonwealth Games to be hosted by Canada, after Hamilton 1930, Vancouver 1954, and Edmonton 1978.

==Host selection==
Three bids for the 1994 Commonwealth Games were submitted. Victoria, New Delhi, and Cardiff were the bidding cities. On 15 September 1988, the Commonwealth Games Federation voted to award Victoria the 1994 Commonwealth Games.

== Venues ==

* University of Victoria – Athletes&#x27; Village
* Centennial Stadium – Athletics
* McKinnon Gym – Badminton
* Victoria Memorial Arena – Gymnastics
* Royal Athletic Park – Field Lacrosse (demonstration)
* Royal Theatre – Weightlifting
* Heal&#x27;s Range – Shooting
* Saanich Commonwealth Place – Aquatics
* Juan de Fuca Recreation Centre – Cycling, Lawn bowls, Wrestling
* Archie Browning Sports Centre (Esquimalt) – Boxing

== Final &quot;Original Games&quot; ==
The 1994 games was the last time team sports were excluded. In 1991, the Commonwealth Games Federation deemed the original setup of ten sports to be obsolete. Beginning with the 1998 games, team sports such as Rugby sevens, Basketball, and Field hockey were added. The decision was taken to encourage more revenue streams from television by making the games more attractive to viewing audiences.

== Opening ceremony ==
A simple friendly atmosphere was the theme to the Opening Ceremonies. In the presence of Prince Edward, the Athletes had a long march past to their seated area (an idea created four years previously and emulated since at the 2014 Games in Glasgow). Welcome speeches and flag raisings were followed by a precision horse riding display by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. A visual and theatrical display by the Four Nations Tribes culminated in a massive Thunderbird symbol covering the entire inner field. This was followed by a flypast by the Snowbirds Canadian Forces aerobatic display team.

==Games==

===Participating teams===
There were 63 participating nations at the 1994 Commonwealth Games. The XV Commonwealth Games marked South Africa&#x27;s return to the Commonwealth Games following the apartheid era, and 36 years since the country last competed in the Games in 1958. Namibia participated in its first Games after gaining independence from South Africa in 1990, and the Caribbean island of Montserrat also made their Games debut. This was Hong Kong&#x27;s last appearance at the Games before the transfer of sovereignty from Britain to China.

===Calendar===
The following table shows a summary of the competition schedule.

===Medal table===
This is a full table of the medal count of the 1994 Commonwealth Games. These rankings sort by the number of gold medals earned by a country. The number of silvers is taken into consideration next and then the number of bronze. If, after the above, countries are still tied, equal ranking is given and they are listed alphabetically. This follows the system used by the IOC, IAAF and BBC.

This was the first time since the commencement of the British Empire Games (in 1930) that England did not achieve a medal ranking in the top two.

==Boxing committee==
In preparation for 1994 Commonwealth Games, a boxing committee was formed in 1989. The chairperson of the boxing committee was Hassan Sunderani, and the initial members were Brian Zelley, Glyn Jones and Mike Sartori.

In the initial stages, of the committee one of the immediate tasks was to prepare a guide as to what was expected at the Games, and to document some history of amateur boxing in the Greater Victoria area. The primary work was done by chairperson Sunderani while the local boxing history was assigned to committee member Zelley, a previous news editor for the British Columbia Amateur Boxing Association in the mid-1980s and a contributor of boxing news to various news outlets in the 1970s and 80s.

The next order of business was to start the process of organising volunteers. The first formal public meeting to begin this process took place in Victoria in the boardroom of the Victoria Commonwealth Games Society on 21 April 1990. The meeting included three of the committee members, a VCHS official, and seven potential volunteers including two former Vancouver Island Amateur Boxing commissioners – Bert Wilkinson and Rick Brough.

The primary decision was to arrange a bigger meeting and consider reviving the Greater Victoria Amateur Boxing Association on a formal or informal basis, and to have former experienced people with some background in the sport of amateur boxing. That meeting took place on 13 May 1990 with 23 persons in attendance and was listed as the &quot;Greater Victoria Amateur Boxing Association Founding Meeting&quot;. This would become an important meeting to begin the real work in preparation of volunteers, have a representative attend the 1990 Seattle Goodwill Games to observe, and plan and prepare for a test event in 1993. Preliminary coverage of the 13 May meeting included a piece titled &quot;Approaching Games to lift amateur boxing&#x27;s profile&quot;. The reporter Jeff Rud interviewed Games official John Stothart and boxing committee members Mike Sartori and Brian Zelley.

The 1993 test event was held in August and included some top Canadian boxers such as Dale Brown of Calgary. Brown was highlighted in the local paper with the headlines &quot;Brown building impressive ring career&quot;; at the end of the tournament the local &quot;Times-Colonist&quot; newspaper reported &quot;Tournament was a perfect dry run&quot;.

===Interim boxing chairman===
During 1991 Hassan Sunderani resigned as the chairman and committee member Brian Zelley stepped-in for a one-year period as the acting chairman of the committee. During this period, the primary role was to attend Sports Committee meetings while the local boxing community started to organise for potential boxing club activity. In 1992, Sunderani resumed his position and steps were taken to prepare for the pre-Commonwealth Games event in 1993. Also, some new members were appointed to the boxing committee such as Tom Black.

<doc id="921904" wikidata="Q2986962" url="?curid=921904" title="Kirby's Avalanche">
<text>Kirby&#x27;s Avalanche, known in Europe as Kirby&#x27;s Ghost Trap, is a puzzle video game developed by Compile and HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It was released in North America and Europe in February 1995. It is a Western release of the Japanese &quot;Super Puyo Puyo&quot; featuring characters from the &quot;Kirby&quot; series. There was not a Japanese release, and the game remains the only &quot;Kirby&quot; title not released there. In Europe and Australia, the game was re-released on the Wii&#x27;s Virtual Console service on July 27, 2007 and in North America on September 24, 2007. The game was re-released for the Nintendo Switch Online service on July 21, 2022.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is the same as in &quot;Super Puyo Puyo&quot;, with groups of two colored blobs fall from the top of the screen. The player must rotate and move the groups before they touch the bottom of the screen or the pile, so that matching-colored blobs touch from above, below, the left or the right. Once four or more same-colored blobs touch, they will disappear, and any blobs above them will fall down to fill in space. If a player manages to set off a chain reaction with these blobs, rocks will fall on the other player&#x27;s screen, filling it up and giving them less room to drop additional blobs. The number of rocks that falls depends on both the number of blobs popped and the number of consecutive chain reactions. These rocks will only disappear if a player manages to pop a group of blobs that are in direct contact with the rocks. A player will lose if either of the middle columns in the top row is filled with a blob or rock.

==Plot==

King Dedede has challenged Kirby and other members of Dream Land to an Avalanche Competition at the Fountain of Dreams. Kirby decides to take on the challenge, battling his way through the forest in Avalanche matches against an assortment of his old foes from &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Land&quot; and &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; (including recurring bosses such as Whispy Woods, Kracko and Meta Knight), and ultimately to a final showdown at the Fountain of Dreams with King Dedede to win the Cup.

==Version differences==
While the core gameplay remains the same, the Japanese and Western versions are drastically different cosmetically. As the story in &quot;Super Puyo Puyo&quot; is more focused on Arle Nadja and Carbuncle&#x27;s adventures like the &quot;Madou Monogatari&quot; and Mega Drive &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; versions, the Western version replaced them with Kirby characters to appeal to Western audiences.

As a game released later in the SNES&#x27;s life cycle, this game has bright colors and advanced graphics for its time. The sound consists of remixed tracks from &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Adventure&quot; and &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Dream Course&quot;, with only one original track from the &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; game itself (the panic music). The game also includes several voice samples.

Both versions have cinematics between each round, with differences being Kirby and his opponents shown having full conversations and trash-talking each other in full sentences in the Western version, and that Kirby&#x27;s personality comes off as a lot more sarcastic and confrontational, just as Arle and Carbuncle were in the Japanese version. This differs greatly from other &quot;Kirby&quot; games, where Kirby hardly speaks at all and is also friendlier in general.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirby&#x27;s Avalanche&quot; received generally positive reviews, garnering an aggregate score of 74% on GameRankings based on seven reviews. &quot;IGN&quot; awarded the game 7.5 out of 10, comparing it favorably to &quot;Dr. Robotnik&#x27;s Mean Bean Machine&quot;, another &quot;Puyo Puyo&quot; reskin released for the Sega Genesis in North America. &quot;GamePro&quot; commented that &quot;Although &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Avalanche&quot; is a rehash of an overdone puzzler theme, it&#x27;s so well done that it&#x27;s worth playing - that is, if you don&#x27;t already have three puzzle games just like it.&quot; They particularly praised the graphics and the cuteness of the digitized speech.

&quot;Next Generation&quot; stated that &quot;While we&#x27;ve seen this kind of game before, and this version doesn&#x27;t offer any improvements it&#x27;s still excellent fun.&quot;

In 1997 &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; ranked &quot;Kirby&#x27;s Avalanche&quot; and &quot;Mean Bean Machine&quot; collectively as number 84 on their &quot;100 Best Games of All Time&quot;, calling it &quot;one of the simplest, most addicting puzzle games around.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; rated the game 68th on its &quot;Top 100 SNES of All Time.&quot; In 1995, &quot;Total!&quot; listed the game 9th on their Top 100 SNES Games.

<text>Myocardial disarray, also known as myocyte disarray, is a term to describe the loss of the normal parallel alignment of myocytes (the muscle cells of the heart). Instead, the myocytes usually form circles around foci of connective tissue. Myocardial disarray is associated with myocardial fibrosis (the replacement of the myocytes with non-contractile scar tissue).

Myocardial disarray can be seen in a number of disease states, including:
* Aortic stenosis
* Congenital heart disease
* Hypertensive heart disease
* Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy

The common factor amongst all these diseases is that they all cause varying degrees of remodelling (myocardial fibrosis) of the ventricles.

<text>Meaux () is a commune on the river Marne in the Seine-et-Marne department in the Île-de-France region in the metropolitan area of Paris, France. It is east-northeast of the centre of Paris.

Meaux is, with Provins, Torcy and Fontainebleau, one of the four subprefectures (&quot;sous-préfectures&quot;) of the department of Seine-et-Marne, Melun being the prefecture. In France a subprefecture is the chef-lieu (the seat or administrative capital) of an &quot;arrondissement&quot;: Meaux is the subprefecture of the arrondissement of Meaux. It is also the chef-lieu of a smaller administrative division: the canton of Meaux. Finally, since its creation in 2003, Meaux has been the centre and the main town of an agglomeration community, the Communauté d&#x27;agglomération du Pays de Meaux.

==Demographics==
With a population of 55,416 inhabitants in 2018, Meaux is the most populous city in the Seine-et-Marne department, just before Chelles (55,148 inhabitants in 2018).

==History and culture==
Inhabitants of Meaux are called &quot;Meldois&quot;. Both names &quot;Meaux&quot; and &quot;Meldois&quot; originated with the &quot;Meldi&quot;, the Latin name of the original Gaulish tribe who occupied this area of the valley of the Marne river. Although during the Roman period the city was called Iantinum by the Romans, the name of the Meldi persisted and was finally kept for naming both the city and its inhabitants.

Historical buildings and monuments in Meaux are mainly located in the old city, inside the old defensive walls, still nowadays partially kept thanks to an important segment of the original surrounding wall from the Gallo-Roman period. A meander of the Marne river divides the old city into the North Quarter (called among the &quot;Meldois&quot; as the Cathedral Quarter) and the South Quarter (known among the locals as the Market Quarter). In the North Quarter there is the Meaux Cathedral, the episcopal palace and its gardens (outlining the shape of a bishop&#x27;s mitre), the old seat of the chapter (&quot;le vieux chapitre&quot;), part of the defensive walls (as mentioned), some keeps and towers, and the archaeological remains of the sanctuary of La Bauve, all-embracing the Gaulish period (4th, 3rd and 1st centuries BC), the era of the early Roman Empire (Gallo-Roman: 1st, 2nd and 3rd centuries AD) and the early Christian Era and subsequent centuries (from the 3rd to the 18th centuries, with the remains, among others, of the Saint-Faron Abbey, demolished during the French Revolution). The South Quarter of the old city mainly includes the historic covered market and the Canal Cornillon, built during the Middle Ages, in the year 1235. Centuries later, in 1806, during the Napoleonic era, was built the Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq, destined to the inland navigation when the Marne river is not navigable because of temporary sandbanks.

At 73, Rue du Marché stood the house of Etienne Mangin in which he started the first Calvin-inspired Protestant church in France. The house was ordered by the Parliament in Paris to be razed and a chapel built in its place following the execution at the stake of fourteen members of the congregation for heresy in 1546. Rather than a chapel, there remains a fairly nondescript building on the site to this day with a plaque which bears the following inscription (translated): &quot;Here stood the house of ETIENNE MANGIN in which was constructed the first Reformed Church of France. In front of this location 14 Reformists, arrested during a cult, were burned on 8 October 1546 at the decree of the Parliament in Paris on 4 October 1546. Offered by the City of Meaux 1985.&quot;

Meaux is nowadays mainly known for Brie de Meaux (a variety of Brie cheese) and the local variety of mustard. Following the official administrative French AOC there are two designations of Brie de Meaux: &quot;Brie de Meaux fermier&quot; (&quot;farm Brie de Meaux&quot;, made out of the milk from the cows of a single unique producer) and &quot;Brie de Meaux laitier&quot; (&quot;laitier&quot;, that is from the French &quot;lait&quot;, &quot;milk&quot;, which designates here an agreement, a mixture of the milk of different producers). The &quot;Moutarde de Meaux&quot; (&quot;Meaux Mustard&quot;) recipe is since the 18th century a label commercially owned by the Pommery company and is nowadays derived not only in its traditional well known form but also in a variety of new different ingredient combinations: Honey Mustard, Green Pepper Mustard, &quot;Moutarde Royale&quot; (that latter including Cognac in its composition) etc.

Several festivals and concerts are celebrated in Meaux, venues for live music like the Music Festival &quot;Musik&#x27;elles&quot; (usually at the end of every summer). There&#x27;s a local public concert band in Meaux: &quot;L&#x27;Harmonie du Pays de Meaux&quot;. It is constituted by three different ensembles, following different ages: &quot;Les Minimes&quot; (children), &quot;Les Juniors&quot; (teenagers) and &quot;L&#x27;Harmonie de Meaux&quot; (adults). The band is also one of the two official music academies of the town. The other one is the conservatory of the city.

Also, every summer for more than 30 years, during several weekends per summer, a show is played by stage actors in the esplanade situated between the cathedral and the episcopal palace: the &quot;Spectacle historique&quot; (&quot;History show&quot;). The show represents the history of Meaux all along the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and also, more recently, during World War I (the German advance had been halted at Meaux in 1914 during the First Battle of the Marne).

There is only one cinema in Meaux: The Majestic, a former stage theatre. In modern days there are three stage theatres in the city. One is the &quot;Théâtre Gérard Philippe&quot;, a private theatre, situated close to the covered market. Not far from the market, in the same area but in a bigger and more recent building, there is the official subsidised theatre of the city, the &quot;Théâtre Luxembourg&quot;, divided in two separated auditoriums in the same building: the &quot;Salle Luxembourg&quot; (601 seats) and the &quot;Salle du Manège&quot; (107 seats). In an eastern area of Meaux, the Beauval quarter, there is the third stage theatre of the town, the &quot;Salle Champagne&quot; (200 seats), located in the &quot;Espace Caravelle&quot;, a building dedicated to cultural activities. Private theatre companies and community arts associations play in all three theatres.

Two museums can be found in Meaux: the &quot;Musée Bossuet&quot; (located in the episcopal palace, this is the art and history museum of Meaux) and the &quot;Musée de la Grande Guerre du pays de Meaux&quot; [fr] (the largest World War I Museum in the world).

==Relevant historical episodes==


===Middle Ages: Siege of Meaux===
The Siege of Meaux took place between October 1421 and May 1422, during the Hundred Years&#x27; War between England and France. The besiegers were the English, under Henry V. The town&#x27;s defence was led by the Bastard of Vaurus, notorious for his savagery. The siege commenced on October 6, 1421, and mining and bombardment soon brought down the walls. Casualties began to mount in the English army, including John Clifford, 7th Baron de Clifford who had been at the siege of Harfleur, the Battle of Agincourt, and received the surrender of Cherbourg. The English also began to fall sick rather early into the siege, and it is estimated that one sixteenth of the besiegers died from dysentery and smallpox. On 9 March 1422, the town surrendered, although the garrison held out. Under continued bombardment, the garrison gave in as well on 10 March, following a siege of six months. The Bastard of Vaurus was decapitated, as was a trumpeter named Orace, who had once mocked King Henry. Sir John Fortescue was then installed as English Captain of Meaux Castle.

===World War I: First Battle of the Marne===
During the First Battle of the Marne (September 1914), the German troops were stopped at the gates of Meaux. This heroic action not only prevented the city from being taken by the Germans but also changed the course of the war. In 1932, at the place of the battlefield, the people of the United States of America had a monument erected in the memory of the French soldiers fallen in action. Called, in French, (&quot;The Tearful Liberty&quot;), the sculpture by Frederick MacMonnies is popularly known among the French as &quot;Le Monument américain&quot; (&quot;the American Monument&quot;). 
In 2011, beside the monument was built the Museum of the Great War (&quot;Musée de la Grande Guerre du pays de Meaux&quot; [fr]).
==Sports==
The town is represented by the CS Meaux association football club. Many other sports are also practiced in Meaux like rugby or field hockey, especially water sports. There are in Meaux, for example different sporting clubs dealing with canoeing (mainly practiced in the Canal de l&#x27;Ourcq), scuba diving (the club &quot;Asterina&quot;, named after a starfish genus, trains in the swimming pools of the city), swimming (&quot;Club sportif Meaux Natation&quot;).

==Transport==
Meaux is served by Meaux station on the Transilien Paris – Est suburban rail line and on several national rail lines. The rail line connecting Paris to Meaux was established in 1849. The nowadays SNCF train station, still in use, was built in 1890.

<text>The Chrysler Town &amp; Country is a minivan that was manufactured and marketed by Chrysler from 1990 to the 2016 model years. The third Chrysler minivan introduced in North America, the Town &amp; Country adopted its nameplate from the flagship Chrysler station wagon line, adopting its exterior woodgrain trim as a design feature for several generations. 

Marketed as the flagship of the Chrysler minivan line, five generations of the Town &amp; Country were slotted above the extended-wheelbase Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager. For 2017, Chrysler retired the nameplate, with sixth-generation Chrysler-division minivans becoming the Chrysler Pacifica. After the 2016 model year, Chrysler marked the sale of its 12 millionth minivan (under all three nameplates). Produced almost continuously for 75 years (with the exception of World War II and 1989), the Town &amp; Country nameplate is the longest-produced Chrysler; its longevity is second only to the Chevrolet Suburban in worldwide automotive history. 

Chrysler assembled the first three generations of the model line in its Saint Louis Assembly facility (Fenton, Missouri). The fourth and fifth-generation Town &amp; Country were produced by Chrysler Canada by Windsor Assembly (Windsor, Ontario).

==First generation (1990)==


The Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan was introduced as a minivan in the spring of 1989 as an early 1990 model. Originally slated for a 1989 model-year release, the nameplate had been placed on hiatus for the first time since 1945 as Chrysler discontinued station wagon production after the 1988 model year. Having sold the line as one of its flagship vehicles (similar to the New Yorker and Imperial until the end of the 1970s), Chrysler sought to continue the name for a minivan (as the vehicles replaced full-size station wagons across multiple premium brands). Though its 1980s namesake was a station wagon counterpart of the Chrysler LeBaron sedan, a Town &amp; Country minivan was benchmarked as the equivalent of the largest Chrysler sedans, including the 1989-1990 New Yorker Landau and Fifth Avenue. 

The 1990 Chrysler Town &amp; Country used the Chrysler S platform, sharing its bodyshell with the Dodge Grand Caravan and Plymouth Grand Voyager. Alongside its role of securing higher-profit sales, another objective behind the development of the model line (introduced roughly 18 months before the release of its successor) was to repurpose pre-manufactured long-wheelbase bodies already slated to be sold by Dodge and Plymouth. To minimize any potential tooling costs of a distinct nameplate, the Town &amp; Country was distinguished from its counterparts with relatively few changes. 

Initially offered solely in white, black was added as an optional color in June 1989; all versions were produced with a tan interior. Retaining its traditional exterior (simulated) wood trim (from LE-trim Voyagers/Caravans), the model line was styled with a largely monochrome exterior (with body-color bumpers and side mirrors). While the grille was designed specifically for the Town &amp; Country (adopting the Chrysler lettering from the export Voyager), the 15-inch wheels were shared with the Voyager LX (painted white), with the lower body cladding shared with the Caravan ES (slightly extended to compensate for the longer wheelbase). Shared with the New Yorker and Fifth Avenue, the Town &amp; Country received a crystal Chrysler Pentastar hood ornament. 

The interior was trimmed with leather seats and leather door panels (adopting a more contemporary design than Chrysler sedans), along with upgraded wood trim. In contrast to LE-trim Dodge and Plymouth minivans, the Town &amp; Country was equipped with effectively every feature, including power windows and locks, seven-passenger seating, roof luggage rack, and front and rear air conditioning; the Infinity sound system was shared with the Imperial.

In total, Chrysler produced 1,789 examples in 1989 and 3,615 during 1990.

===Engines===
When launched, the Town &amp; Country was originally fitted with the Mitsubishi-produced 6G72 3.0L V6, producing 142hp; these vehicles were certified as 1989 vehicles by the EPA. For 1990 production, the Chrysler-produced 3.3L V6 replaced it, increasing output to 150hp; this engine was shared with the Dodge Dynasty, Chrysler New Yorker, and Chrysler Imperial. 

Both engines were paired solely with a 4-speed &quot;Ultradrive&quot; automatic transmission.
* 3.0 L Mitsubishi &quot;6G72&quot; V6, , 
* 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6, , (after July 1989)
==Second generation (1991–1995)==

Introduced in November 1990, the second-generation Town &amp; Country minivan adopted the Chrysler AS platform, using the 119-inch wheelbase of the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager. Sharing only the front doors and side door with its 1990 predecessor, the chassis underwent extensive upgrades. As with the previous generation, the Town &amp; Country was structurally unrelated with the Chrysler K-Cars (discontinued for 1991), but shared powertrain commonality with its AC/AY-platform derivatives (Chrysler New Yorker/Fifth Avenue/Imperial and Dodge Dynasty). 

In contrast to the Caravan and Voyager, the Town &amp; Country was sold in a single trim level with few distinct options; no short-wheelbase version was offered. In addition to its waterfall grille and crystal Pentastar (similar to the New Yorker), the Town &amp; Country shared its headlights and taillight clusters with the Voyager. In line with the previous generation, the exterior was styled with monochrome paint (including matching side mirrors and body cladding) and model-specific alloy wheels. Moving beyond the limited-production status of previous generation, Chrysler offered a variety of exterior of colors, keeping the woodgrain trim standard. 

The interior was fitted with standard leather trim (similar to the Chrysler Imperial), woodgrain dashboard/door trim (replacing black trim) and a standard digital instrument cluster (including a tachometer). In a change from the previous generation, the dashboard was fitted with a glovebox. The second row of seats was offered in two configurations; a bench seat was standard, with &quot;Quad Command&quot; second-row bucket seats offered as an option for the Town &amp; Country (and the highest-trim Voyager/Caravan); for 1992, the latter design was made standard. Though Chrysler introduced integrated child safety seats for 1992, the feature was designed only with bench seats, precluding its fitment with the Town &amp; Country. 

Introduced as an option when the model was launched, the Town &amp; Country (and its Caravan/Voyager counterparts) was the first minivan sold with a driver-side airbag; for 1992, the driver airbag was made standard. Though technically a light truck, the model line adopted 3-point seatbelts for each outboard seating position. 

=== Engines ===
* 1991–1993: 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6, , 
* 1994–1995: 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot; V6, , 

===Year-to-year changes===
*1991: Second-generation Chrysler Town &amp; Country minivan is introduced with improved aerodynamics, fit and finish, and upgraded interior controls. 1991 vehicles are distinguished by door handle design (shared with the previous generation). Only year for optional airbag and standard 2nd-row bench seat. 
*1992: Driver-side airbag and &quot;quad command&quot; rear seats made standard; all-wheel drive introduced as optional feature. Door handles redesigned (larger, better-integrated design). For the first time, Chrysler offers an exterior woodgrain trim delete option for the Town &amp; Country, replaced by a monochrome exterior with a gold pinstripe; new gold-color alloy wheels were introduced. 
*1993: There were several interior revisions. On the exterior, a stainless steel exhaust system and new available wheel designs greeted buyers for 1993.
*1994: For a mid-cycle revision, the dashboard underwent a design, introducing dual airbags; to meet 1998 side-impact standards, the front doors and sliding door were fitted with internal impact beams. Woodgrain-delete vans were fitted with body-color grilles (with some vehicles deleting all chrome). The 3.3L V6 was replaced by a larger-displacement 3.8L V6 (from the 5th Avenue/Imperial).
*1995: Largely carryover in a shortened final year. In a safety change, the keyless-entry remote was revised. To prevent an accidental opening of the rear liftgate, a user now had to press the release button within five seconds.
==Third generation (1996–2000)==


Introduced at the beginning of 1995, the third-generation Town &amp; Country debuted the all-new Chrysler NS platform, marking the most extensive redesign of the Chrysler minivans since their 1984 release. Adopting cab-forward design to a minivan format, Chrysler sought a design that maximized interior space and visibility. Alongside its Dodge and Plymouth counterparts, the 1996 Town &amp; Country introduced several features to the segment, including a driver-side sliding door, and rear seats mounted on deployable wheels (&quot;Easy Out Roller Seats&quot;). In a break from tradition, the 1996 Town &amp; Country was no longer offered with simulated woodgrain exterior trim (offered either as an option or as standard since 1965). The hood ornament was deleted; in place of the crystal Pentastar, the model line debuted a grille-mounted Chrysler &quot;blue ribbon&quot; emblem (revived from the mid-1930s). 

Sharing its bodyshell with the Caravan and Voyager, the Town &amp; Country was styled with a largely monochrome appearance, with chrome limited to body moldings, wheels, and the grille (the only Chrysler NS minivan with a chrome grille). To match the Town &amp; Country against smaller competitors, Chrysler introduced a version of the model line using the standard 113-inch wheelbase (non-&quot;Grand&quot;) body. In a major change, the rear liftgate was fitted with an external release handle (unlatched separately from being unlocked) 

Distinguished primarily by its woodgrain trim, the interior of the Town &amp; Country shared its dashboard with both the Caravan and Voyager; the digital instrument cluster was retired in favor of analog instruments. 

&quot;Car and Driver&quot; included the Town &amp; Country on their Ten Best list for 1996 and 1997. In 1999, Chrysler presented a concept minivan, the Pacifica using the Town &amp; Country&#x27;s body shell and bearing resemblance to the Town &amp; Country and the LHS.

=== Trim ===
For the third generation of the model line, Chrysler expanded the Town &amp; Country several distinct trim levels. To allow Chrysler to compete against smaller minivans (including the Oldsmobile Silhouette and Mercury Villager), the company introduced a shorter-length version (adopting the body of the Caravan/Voyager, not the Grand Caravan/Grand Voyager).

For 1996, the previous-generation Town &amp; Country was designated as the &quot;LXi&quot; trim, again featuring leather and wood interior trim, 8-way adjustable front seats. A base-trim long-wheelbase was introduced; largely replacing the Plymouth Grand Voyager LE, the model was fitted with cloth trim and standard bench seats (allowing for integrated child safety seats as an option). The short-wheelbase &quot;LX&quot; trim replaced the Plymouth Voyager LX, featuring the same feature content as the base-trim model. 

For 1997, the trim range was revised, with the base LWB model becoming the &quot;LX&quot; and the previous LX renamed the &quot;SX&quot; (denoting its shorter-wheelbase status). With the exception of engines (SX and LX used a 3.3L V6; a 3.8L V6 for LXi, optional on AWD LX vans), the LX and SX shared optional equipment standardized on the premium LXi. 

For 1999, the &quot;Limited&quot; was introduced, becoming the flagship minivan trim above the LXi. In addition to chrome wheels and door handles, the Limited was fitted with a distinct design for a third-row seat (with individual outer seatbacks). 

===Engines===
Engines included a 3.3 L gasoline-powered engine (8th VIN digit R), a 3.3 L flexible-fuel 3.3 L engine (8th VIN digit G), and a 3.8 L engine (8th VIN digit L). In Canada, Town &amp; Country models came standard with the 3.8 L V6 and were offered only in long-wheelbase (LWB) versions.
* 1996–2000: 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6, , 
* 1996–1997: 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot; V6, , 
* 1998–2000: 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot; V6, , 

===Year-to-year changes===

==== 1996 ====
* Third-generation Town &amp; Country introduced, retiring woodgrain exterior trim and Pentastar hood ornament. Model line expanded into SWB LX (replacing Plymouth Voyager LX), base model (replacing Grand Voyager LE), and LXi (successor to previous Town &amp; Country). Driver-side sliding door introduced as new optional feature, with rear bench &quot;Easy Out Bench Seats&quot; using deployable rollers for removal.
* Optional sliding rear passenger doors.

==== 1997 ====
* Trim revised to SWB SX, LWB LX and LXi. Driver-side sliding door made standard equipment (on Town &amp; Country). All-wheel drive returned as an option, with front-wheel drive vehicles receiving optional low-speed traction control (standard on LXi). 

==== 1998 ====
* Mid-cycle revision for exterior introduced. The new front bumper received an enlarged black eggcrate grille, with the Chrysler &quot;blue-ribbon&quot; badge trimmed with chrome wings; the headlamps were enlarged, paired with round foglamps. The interior underwent several revisions, including new upholstery for SX and LX trims. The dashboard was revised in design slightly, updating several HVAC vents. 

==== 1999 ====
* Flagship &quot;Limited&quot; trim introduced, slotted above LXi; externally distinguished by additional chrome trim, the Limited interior is fitted with suede/leather seats and trim and a fold-down console for the third-row seat. The middle row bench seat began to be phased out in the model line; an optional integrated child seat was introduced for second-row bucket seats. 

==== 2000 ====
* The short-wheelbase SX was discontinued, shifting the model line entirely to the long-wheelbase &quot;Grand&quot; bodyshell. Coinciding with the retirement of Plymouth during the 2000 model year, Chrysler adopted the Voyager under its own brand in the latter part of the model year, offering it only in a short-wheelbase configuration. 

==Fourth generation (2001–2007)==


The fourth-generation Town &amp; Country went on sale in January 2000 as a 2001 model. It was redesigned using the Chrysler RS platform and initially available only in long-wheelbase (LWB) form.

Chrysler&#x27;s short-wheelbase minivan was marketed using the Voyager nameplate, which had been transferred to the Chrysler line in mid-2000 when the Plymouth brand was discontinued. After 2003, the Voyager nameplate was dropped and the short-wheelbase (SWB) versions were once again part of the Town &amp; Country lineup.

Trim levels for 2001 were carried over from the previous generation. They included the entry-level LX, mid-level LXi, and the range-topping Limited. By 2002, extra feature packed eL and eX models were added. These were value-priced versions of the LX and LXi, respectively, that included the most popular option packages.

The 2004 model year included a new unnamed base short-wheelbase model. The LX, LXi, and Limited were the Canadian trim levels, but only the LXi and Limited were sold to retail consumers. The lowest level LX was restricted to fleet sales.

The 2005 Town &amp; Country received a mid-cycle refresh including revised exterior styling and a mildly restyled interior. The most significant change was the introduction of &quot;Stow&#x27;n Go&quot;, a system of second and third-row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments. The redesigned 2nd- and 3rd-row seats also meant the elimination of the all-wheel drive system. The Stow&#x27;n Go system was prominently featured in this model&#x27;s marketing campaign.

For the remainder of this generation, the Town &amp; Country was available in the short-wheelbase base model, and long-wheelbase LX, Touring, and Limited models. As with the pre-refresh model, only the Touring and Limited were sold to consumers in Canada, the LX being restricted to fleets.

A driver&#x27;s side knee airbag was now standard on all models. The front seat-mounted side airbags of previous years were discontinued in favor of side-curtain airbags for all three rows. These were standard on Limited trim and optional on all other models, however could not be ordered with the moonroof option. Uconnect Bluetooth phone pairing was now available, as well as an overhead rail storage system with three moveable or removable compartments.

===Engines===
Some Town &amp; Country models with the 3.3 L V6 from 1998 to 2003, and all models with the 3.3 L V6 from 2004 to 2007 can use E85 fuel. For more details on these engines see this article.

===Safety===
The 4th generation Town &amp; Country (Grand Voyager, as it is known in Europe) right hand drive (RHD) version performed very poorly in the Euro NCAP car safety tests and achieved the following ratings:

In the tests, the LHD car performed significantly better than the RHD car in the frontal impact, scoring 9 points, giving a potential four star adult occupant rating.&quot;
Thatcham&#x27;s New Car Whiplash Ratings (NCWR) organization tested the 4th generation European Grand Voyager for its ability to protect occupants against whiplash injuries with the car achieving an &#x27;Acceptable&#x27; rating overall.

===Security===
The Grand Voyager was tested by Thatcham&#x27;s New Vehicle Security Ratings (NVSR) organisation and achieved the following ratings:


==Fifth generation (2008–2016)==


===2008 model year===
The fifth-generation Town &amp; Country went on sale on August 16, 2007, as a 2008 model. The short-wheelbase model was discontinued.

The minivans featured styling by Ralph Gilles, a six-speed automatic, a new 4.0 L V6 engine as standard on the Limited model — and a system of second row seats that swiveled to face the third row — marketed as &quot;Swivel&#x27;n Go&quot; seating. A small table, which stored in the bins below the floor, could be positioned between the two rear rows when they were facing each other. Much like its competitors, the Toyota Sienna and Honda Odyssey, the Town &amp; Country now featured power windows on the sliding doors and moved the gear shift from the steering column to the center console, in a higher position. Another new feature of this generation was an available rear overhead console which featured LED map lights as well as halo ambient lighting. A new DVD system was also available, which featured dual screens for the rear passengers. SIRIUS Backseat TV was also offered, which featured three channels of children&#x27;s programming (Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, and Cartoon Network).

A version of this vehicle is sold in several export markets (Australia/South Africa/Middle East/China/Singapore/Russia) as the Chrysler Grand Voyager. In Continental Europe, it was rebadged as the Lancia Voyager from the 2011 model year and up. Before 2011 it was sold as a Chrysler. Since 1991, the model has been sold in the Philippines under the Town and Country nameplate. In the Philippine market, the powertrain options are identical to those of the European Grand Voyager with a 2.8 L turbodiesel I4 as standard and an optional gasoline V6 (initially the 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot;, later upgraded to the 3.6

Both engines were mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission.

Production at the St. Louis plant ended in late 2008 in a bid to save money, but continued at Windsor Assembly in Ontario, Canada.

===Trim Levels===

The Town &amp; Country was offered in many distinct trim levels:

The LX, from 2008–2010, served as the &quot;base&quot; Town &amp; Country trim level. Standard features included a 3.3 L V6 engine, a 4-speed automatic transmission, an AM/FM stereo with CD player and a 4-speaker sound system, sixteen-inch (16&quot;) black-painted steel wheels with plastic wheel covers, stain-repellent cloth seating surfaces, keyless entry, wood interior trim accents, carpeted floor mats, and Chrysler&#x27;s Stow &#x27;N&#x27; Go fold-in-floor seating system. The trim level, which was discontinued after 2010, was reintroduced for 2015, once again as the &quot;base&quot; Town &amp; Country trim level. For 2015, it included a 3.6 L &quot;Pentastar&quot; VVT V6 engine, a 6-speed automatic transmission, seventeen-inch alloy wheels, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a touch-screen sound system, a 6-speaker sound system, power-sliding rear doors and a power tailgate, a rear-seat DVD entertainment system, and a security system.

The Touring had been the &quot;midrange&quot; Town &amp; Country trim level since 2008. From 2008 to 2010, it added the following equipment to the base LX trim level: a 3.8 L V6 engine, sixteen-inch alloy wheels, an AM/FM stereo with CD/MP3 player and a 6-speaker sound system, a security system, second-row bucket seats, power-sliding rear doors and a power tailgate, and power second-row windows and third-row vent windows. Since 2011, it has included the following features (it was the &quot;base&quot; trim level from 2011 to 2014): a 3.6 L &quot;Pentastar&quot; VVT V6 engine, a 6-speed automatic transmission, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a touch-screen sound system, power-sliding rear doors and a power tailgate, power second-row windows and third-row vent windows, and a rear-seat DVD entertainment system.

The S was the &quot;sporty&quot; Town &amp; Country trim level since 2014. It added dark-finished alloy wheels, a darkened front grille, darkened front headlamps, and unique leather-trimmed seating surfaces to the midrange Touring trim level.

The Touring L was the &quot;upgraded&quot; Town &amp; Country trim level since 2012. It adds heated front bucket seats, a third-row DVD entertainment system screen, and upgraded eighteen-inch (18&quot;) alloy wheels to the midrange Touring trim level.

The Limited was the top-of-the-line Town &amp; Country trim level from 2008 to 2014. From 2008 to 2010, it added the following features to the midrange Touring trim level: a 4.0 L V6 engine, a 6-speed automatic transmission, a touch-screen sound system with rear DVD entertainment system, leather-trimmed seating surfaces, a 9-speaker premium 506-watt surround-sound system with external amplifier and subwoofer, and chrome wheels. From 2011 to 2014, it added the following features to the midrange Touring trim level: a 9-speaker premium 506-watt surround-sound system with external amplifier and subwoofer, and upgraded interior trim. In 2015, the Limited Platinum replaced the Limited as the top-of-the-line Town &amp; Country Trim level, and the standard upgraded premium surround-sound system was dropped from the standard equipment list.
Also included was the elimination of the front an rear fender chrome bars. Now it just had the mouldings for them. Eventually (2011) they would be removed, streamlining the look of the body.

The Limited Platinum has been the top-of-the-line Town &amp; Country trim level since 2015. It adds the following features to the Limited trim level: special alloy wheels, upgraded interior trim, and a 9-speaker premium 506-watt surround-sound system with external amplifier and subwoofer.

For 2014, a 30th Anniversary Edition Town &amp; Country was available to celebrate the minivan&#x27;s 30th anniversary (Chrysler invented the term &quot;minivan&quot; in 1984, and the 2014 Dodge Grand Caravan also received special treatment).

==Seating innovation==
Chrysler has regularly innovated new seating systems for their minivans, to enhance interior flexibility.

===Quad command===
Introduced in 1990 for the 1991 model year, Chrysler marketed second-row &quot;captains chairs&quot; as a substitute to the &quot;partial bench&quot; second-row seat.

===Integrated child safety seats===
In 1991 introduced a second-row bench seat integrating two child booster seats. These seats have continued as an available option through Generation 5.

===Easy-Out Roller Seats===
In 1995, Chrysler introduced a system of seats to simplify installation, removal, and re-positioning— marketed as &quot;Easy-Out Roller Seats&quot;. When installed, the seats are latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lift each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks have locator depressions for rollers, thus enabling simple installation. Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks release the floor latches single-handedly without tools and raise the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks are permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions are aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter.

When configured as two- and three-person benches (available through Generation IV), the Easy Out Roller Seats could be unwieldy. Beginning in 2000, second- and third-row seats became available in a &#x27;quad&#x27; configuration — bucket or captain chairs in the second row and a third-row three-person 50/50 split &quot;bench&quot; — with each section weighing under 50 lbs. The Easy-out system remained in use through Generation V — where certain models featured a two-person bench &quot;and&quot; the under-floor compartments from the &quot;Stow&#x27;n Go&quot; system.

The Volkswagen Routan, a rebadged nameplate variant of the Chrysler minivans, used the Easy Out Roller Seats on its second-row seating. These were made available on upper trims the Town and Country after the discontinuation of the Swivel &#x27;n Go seats.

=== Stow&#x27;n Go seating===
In 2005, Chrysler introduced a system of second- and third-row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments — marketed as &quot;Stow &#x27;n Go&quot; seating and exclusively available on long-wheelbase models.

In a development program costing $400 million, engineers used an erector set to initially help visualize the complex interaction of the design and redesigned underfloor components to accommodate the system — including the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking brake cables, rear climate control lines, and the rear suspension. However, the new seating system precluded incorporation of an AWD system, effectively ending that option for the Chrysler minivans.

The system in turn creates a combined volume of of under floor storage when second row seats are deployed. With both rows folded, the vans have a flat load floor and a maximum cargo volume of .

The Stow &#x27;n Go system received &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best of What&#x27;s New&quot; for 2005 award.

The Stow &#x27;n Go system was not offered on the (now discontinued) Volkswagen Routan, a rebadged nameplate variant of the Chrysler minivans.

The Stow &#x27;n Go seating and storage system in the Town &amp; Country and Dodge Grand Caravan was improved, revised, and renamed &quot;Super Stow &#x27;n Go&quot; for the 2011 model year. This system is still on the Grand Caravan and was adapted for the new Pacifica.

In 2021 Chrysler added an AWD option compatible with Stow &#x27;n Go.

===Swivel &#x27;n Go===
Chrysler introduced a seating system in 2008, marketed as &quot;Swivel&#x27;n Go&quot;. In the system, the two second-row seats swivel to face the third row. A detachable table can be placed between the second and third-row seats. Swivel&#x27;n Go is available with Stow &#x27;n Go seating after 2008 models. The Swivel &#x27;n Go system is offered on the Dodge Caravan, but not the Volkswagen Routan, a rebadged nameplate variant of the Chrysler minivans.

These Swivel &#x27;n Go Seats were manufactured by Intier, a division of Magna. The tracks, risers, and swivel mechanisms are assembled by Camslide, a division of Intier. The swivel mechanism was designed by and is produced by Toyo Seat USA Corp.

The system is noted for its high strength. The entire load of the seat in the event of a crash is transferred through the swivel mechanism, which is almost twice as strong as the minimum government requirement.

The swivel mechanism includes bumpers that stabilize the seat while in the lock position. When rotated the seat comes off these bumpers to allow easy rotation.

The seat is not meant to be left in an unlocked position or swiveled with the occupant in it, although this will not damage the swivel mechanism.

Swivel &#x27;n Go was dropped from the 2011 line of Chrysler and Dodge minivans due to a lack of consumer interest.

==Minivan production==
Chrysler Town &amp; Country and Dodge Grand Caravan minivans with &quot;Stow &#x27;n Go&quot; &amp; &quot;Swivel &#x27;n Go&quot; seats are built in Windsor, Ontario.

Two plants have had the task of building the Town &amp; Country, with Saint Louis Assembly building it from 1989 to 2001, and Windsor from 2001 to the present. As of May 2006, Windsor Assembly will be the lead producer of the RT, but will not fully take over until 2009 when they phase out current production of the Pacifica (CS). Saint Louis Assembly minivan plant was closed in October 2008 making Windsor the sole producer of the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and Dodge Grand Caravan.

Taiwanese-market Town &amp; Country minivans were assembled in Yangmei, Taiwan under license by the China Motor Corporation, starting with the 2006 model year. They are based on the European market Chrysler Grand Voyager with the 3.3L engine, with minor changes for the local market including LED taillights and backup cameras. In 2007, production ended and the production line was relocated to China where Soueast continued to assemble it under the Chrysler Grand Voyager and Dodge Grand Caravan nameplates from 2008 until late 2010.

From 1991 to 2007 Chrysler Voyager/Grand Voyager cars were assembled in Austria and sold out in Europe and in many other global markets. Since 2008 the European-Version is also produced in Ontario, although diesel engines are still available, and the trim is also different. From the outside the cars look very similar to the North American &quot;Town &amp; Country&quot; Model, but are sold as the &quot;Chrysler Grand Voyager&quot;.

The Town &amp; Country is also marketed in Mexico, Venezuela, and from 2011 on, in Brazil, as it was previously sold there rebadged as the Chrysler Caravan.

==Town &amp; Country Plug-in hybrid==

In September 2008, Chrysler unveiled a plug-in hybrid version of the Town &amp; Country along with similarly engineered 4-door Jeep Wrangler and a purely electric sports car. The Town &amp; Country prototype had an all-electric range of before gasoline starts. However, in November 2009 Fiat SpA disbanded Chrysler&#x27;s ENVI electric car division and dropped these models from future product plans.

A two-year demonstration program with 25 flexible-fuel plug-in minivans began in April 2012. The first Town and Country were delivered in Auburn Hills, Michigan and Charlotte, North Carolina. The -million demonstration project is partially financed by a million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The plug-in hybrid minivans are equipped with an E85-compatible 3.6 L Pentastar engine mated to a front-wheel-drive, with two-mode hybrid transmission. The plug-in hybrid is powered by a liquid-cooled 12.1 KWh lithium-ion battery that delivers a total output of 290 horsepower. The total vehicle range is .

A plug-in hybrid version of the next-generation Chrysler minivan launched in the U.S. in late 2016.

;Fire incident

In September 2012 Chrysler temporarily suspended the demonstration program. All 109 Dodge Ram 1500 Plug-in Hybrids and 23 Chrysler Town &amp; Country plug-in hybrids deployed by the program were recalled due to damage sustained by three separate pickup trucks when their 12.9 kWh battery packs overheated. The carmaker plans to upgrade the battery packs with cells that use different lithium-ion chemistry before the vehicles go back on service. Chrysler explained that no one was injured from any of the incidents, and the vehicles were not occupied at the time, nor any of the minivans were involved in any incident, but they were withdrawn as a precaution. The demonstration is a program jointly funded by Chrysler and the U.S. Department of Energy that includes the first-ever factory-produced vehicles capable of reverse power flow. The experimental system would allow fleet operators to use their plug-in hybrids to supply electricity for a building during a power outage, reduce power usage when electric rates are high, or even sell electricity back to their utility company. The company reported that the demonstration fleet had collectively accumulated 1.3 million miles (2.1 million km) before the vehicles were recalled. Chrysler also reported that the plug-in pickups delivered peak average fuel economy of , while the plug-in hybrid minivans delivered .

<text>Giaan Leigh Rooney, OAM (born 15 November 1982) is an Australian former competitive swimmer and television personality. As a member of the Australian team in women&#x27;s 4×100-metre medley relay, she won an Olympic gold medal and broke a world record at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Rooney is currently an Australian television presenter.

==Personal life==
Rooney was born in Brisbane and moved to the Gold Coast at age 8 where she attended Miami State Primary School and All Saints Anglican School.

Giaan is married to Sam Levett. On 17 March 2014, Rooney gave birth to her first child, a boy, and on 14 June 2017 a girl.

==Swimming career==
Rooney&#x27;s career began at age 11 at the Miami club in Queensland, where she was coached by Denis Cotterell. Training partners there included Grant Hackett and Daniel Kowalski. In 2002 Rooney moved to Melbourne, coached by Ian Pope at the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre. Training partners included Matt Welsh, Michael Klim (who was also her boyfriend for two years) and Brett Hawke.

Rooney made her international swimming debut for Australia at the 1998 Commonwealth Games, where she won a gold medal in the 100 m backstroke as a 15-year-old. Rooney was also part of Australia&#x27;s gold medal-winning 4×100-metre medley relay team at the 1998 Games.

At the 2000 Olympics in Sydney Rooney won two silver medals as a part of the 4×200-metre freestyle relay (with Kirsten Thomson, Susie O&#x27;Neill and Petria Thomas) and 4×100-metre medley relay (swam in morning preliminary session).
In 2001 Rooney claimed the world champion title in the 200 m freestyle, winning at the 2001 Fukuoka World Swimming Championships in Japan. This meet was also widely remembered for the disqualification of the Australian women&#x27;s team after they jumped in the water to celebrate apparent victory in the 4×200-metre freestyle relay: the team of Elka Graham, Petria Thomas and Linda Mackenzie joined anchor swimmer Rooney in the water to celebrate their win, but as it was before all other competitors had finished the event, they were disqualified. Furthermore, the team found out about their disqualification while they were giving a post race interview for television.

Rooney competed in the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester, England, winning silver in the 4×200-metre freestyle relay (with Elka Graham, Rebecca Creedy and Petria Thomas) and bronze in the 100-metre backstroke.

In 2004 Rooney won a gold medal in world record time at the 2004 Summer Olympics in the women&#x27;s 4×100-metre Medley Relay. Rooney swam a personal best and new Australian record time of 1:01.18 to help Australia to the gold – the maiden victory by Australia in this event in Olympic history.

After the withdrawal of Grant Hackett from the 2006 Commonwealth Games due to injury, Rooney was appointed as the captain of the national swimming team. She won a silver medal behind teammate Sophie Edington in the 100-metre backstroke, and qualified fastest for the 50-metre backstroke. However, she was upset by Edington by 0.01 of a second, again winning a silver medal. There is, however, conjecture about that official result with video suggesting Rooney touched first but did not activate the timing pad immediately. Rooney retired from competitive swimming after this meet.

==Television career==

Rooney has performed on television with appearances on Torvill and Dean&#x27;s Dancing on Ice competition and holiday season weather presenter on Nine Network&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot;, filling in for Steven Jacobs, despite having no experience or qualification in meteorology.

Giaan also appeared as a presenter on the Nine Network&#x27;s television health series &quot;What&#x27;s Good For You&quot; (2007), &quot;Getaway&quot; (2007–08) and &quot;Battlefronts&quot; (2009). She also attended Bond University as a sporting scholar.

In 2010, Rooney was appointed as host of the Victorian edition of &quot;&#x27;Postcards&quot;&#x27;, a local travel series broadcast on the Nine Network replacing Suzie Wilks, and in 2011, Nine Network appointed her as occasional host of their Sunday sports program &quot;Nine&#x27;s Wide World of Sports&quot;.

In December 2012, Rooney joined the Seven Network as a fill-in weather presenter on &quot;Seven News Melbourne&quot; while David Brown was on holidays, and in February 2013, she was appointed regular weather presenter on &quot;Seven News Melbourne&quot; replacing Brown who became network meteorologist.
In January 2014, Rooney went on maternity leave, and was replaced by Jo Silvagni. She returned from maternity leave in June 2014 to present weather on weekends.

In February 2015, Rooney resigned as weekend weather presenter on &quot;Seven News Melbourne&quot;, and in October 2015 she became sports anchor for &quot;Seven News Brisbane&quot;. No longer in this role, she remains part of the Seven Network&#x27;s news and sport division.

In April 2018, Rooney was part of the Seven Network&#x27;s 2018 Commonwealth Games commentary team.

As the Seven Network in late 2020, she debuts as a presenting team on the show Helloworld. After the second season and after a 3-year hiatus, Rooney now return to the show on the Nine Network with returning presenter Lauren Phillips which co-hosting the first season, also new presenters to the show Eddie McGuire, Anthony Lehmann and Luke Nguyen.

<text>The Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF; ; often abbreviated as 海基會) is a semiofficial organization set up by the Government of the Republic of China (Taiwan) to handle civil and business matters with the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). Though technically a private organization, it is funded by the government and under the supervision of the Mainland Affairs Council of the Executive Yuan. Its role is effectively to function as the &quot;de facto&quot; embassy to the PRC, as a means of avoiding acknowledgement of the PRC&#x27;s statehood status.

Its counterpart in the PRC is the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).

==History==

Business and civil activities across Taiwan Strait resumed when the armed conflict between the two side ceased after the end of the Cold War. Due to the complexity of the political and legal status of cross-strait relations and lack of contact between the two opposing governments during the conflict, the ROC government had to create an intermediary body from the private sector to deal with cross-strait matters. Thus on 9 March 1991, the SEF was formally established with the help of the government and private sector funds.

At the same time, the PRC government established ARATS. The creation of these two offices facilitate a new stage in cross-strait relations after they had been virtually non-existent for almost 50 years since the establishment of PRC.

==Organization structure==

* Department of Cultural Affairs
* Department of Economic Affairs
* Department of Legal Affairs
* Department of Planning and Public Affairs
* Secretariat

== List of chairpersons ==
==SEF branch office in Mainland China==
On 11 April 2013, the Executive Yuan approved a bill to open SEF branch offices in Mainland China. In the initial announcement, three offices were planned.

==SEF building==
The current SEF building in Beian Road originated since its groundbreaking construction on 25 September 2010 when its ceremony was presided over by then SEF Chairman Chiang Pin-kung. On 31 March 2012, the finished constructed building was refurbished and SEF started to move there on 4 April 2012 from their old rented office building on Minsheng East Road. The new building was opened for service on 9 April 2012. On 18 May 2012, President Ma Ying-jeou presided over the building&#x27;s official opening ceremony.

The SEF building is adjacent to Dazhi Station of the Taipei Metro on the Brown Line.

<text>The Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS; ; often abbreviated as ) is a united front organization set up by the Taiwan Affairs Office of the People&#x27;s Republic of China for handling technical and business matters with Taiwan.

The foundation&#x27;s founding chairman was former Shanghai mayor Wang Daohan, honorary chairman Rong Yiren. Negotiations with SEF stopped in 1999, and after Wang&#x27;s death in 2005, no new chair was appointed until 2008. Following the election of Ma Ying-jeou to the presidency of Taiwan, talks between ARATS and SEF have restarted and progress was made in the areas of transport and economy such as the Three Links in 2008 and Economic Cooperation Framework Agreement in 2010. Chen Yunlin, who was formerly head of the Taiwan Affairs Office, was the head of ARATS from 2008 to 2013. He has met his counterpart Chiang Pin-kung in 2008.

In 2024, Taiwan&#x27;s Mainland Affairs Council banned its citizens from working at ARATS due to national security concerns.

<text>The Mainland Affairs Council (MAC) is a cabinet-level administrative agency under the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China (Taiwan). The MAC is responsible for the planning, development, and implementation of the cross-strait relations policy which targets mainland China, Hong Kong and Macau.

The MAC&#x27;s counterpart body in the People&#x27;s Republic of China is the Taiwan Affairs Office. Both states officially claim each other&#x27;s territory, though both sides control only part of the claimed territory. The affairs related to the PRC in mainland China is dealt by the MAC, instead of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The council plays an important role in setting policy and development of cross-strait relations and advising the central government. It is administered by a cabinet level Minister. The current Minister is Chiu Tai-san. The agency funds and indirectly administers the Straits Exchange Foundation which directly interacts with agencies from the PRC.

==History==
The government of ROC does not recognize the legitimacy and sovereignty of PRC since its establishment in 1949, and heated armed conflicts went on between both parties. The Republic of China controls only Taiwan, Penghu, and some other islands, and therefore is usually known as &quot;Taiwan&quot;, sometimes referred to as the &quot;Free Area&quot; in the Republic of China by the Constitution of the Republic of China. The People&#x27;s Republic of China controls mainland China as well as Hong Kong, Macau, and other islands, and is therefore usually known as &quot;China&quot;. As the relation between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait cooled down, ROC government allowed family-related visits to mainland China in November 1987. The Executive Yuan established the Inter-Agency Mainland Affairs Committee in August 1988 as a taskforce to handle mainland-related affairs among the authorities. In April 1990, the ROC government drafted the Organization Act for the Mainland Affairs Council to strengthen mainland China policy making and to enhance policy making efficiency. The third reading of the act was passed by the Legislative Yuan on 18 January 1991. On 28 January 1991, the act was promulgated by President Lee Teng-hui thus officially authorized the Mainland Affairs Council to be the agency for the overall planning and handling of affairs towards mainland China.

In 2017, some of the responsibilities of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission (MTAC) were absorbed into the MAC&#x27;s Department of Hong Kong and Macao Affairs, creating the expanded Department of Hong Kong, Macao, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet Affairs.

As cross-strait relations worsened again in the early 2020s, the MAC banned Taiwanese citizens from working at Confucius Institutes, the Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), the All-China Youth Federation, and the All-China Federation of Taiwan Compatriots in 2024 out of national security concerns. In January 2025, the MAC revoked the operating license of &quot;The Strait Herald&quot; due to its united front work on the island.

==Organizational structure==
The agency is organized in the following departments:

===Internal departments===
* Department of Policy Planning
* Department of Cultural and Educational Affairs
* Department of Economic Affairs
* Department of Legal Affairs
* Department of Hong Kong, Macao, Inner Mongolia, and Tibet Affairs
* Department of Information and Liaison

<text>In proof theory, proof nets are a geometrical method of representing proofs that
eliminates two forms of &quot;bureaucracy&quot; that differentiate proofs: (A) irrelevant syntactical features of regular proof calculi, and (B) the order of rules applied in a derivation. In this way, the formal properties of proof identity correspond more closely to the intuitively desirable properties. This distinguishes proof nets from regular proof calculi such as the natural deduction calculus and the sequent calculus, where these phenomena are present. Proof nets were introduced by Jean-Yves Girard. 

As an illustration, these two linear logic proofs are identical:

And their corresponding nets will be the same.

== Correctness criteria ==
Several correctness criteria are known to check if a sequential proof structure (i.e. something that seems to be a proof net) is actually a concrete proof structure (i.e. something that encodes a valid derivation in linear logic). The first such criterion is the long-trip criterion, which was described by Jean-Yves Girard.

<text>Central Ontario is a secondary region of Southern Ontario in the Canadian province of Ontario that lies between Georgian Bay and the eastern end of Lake Ontario.

The population of the region was 1,123,307 in 2016; however, this number does not include large numbers of seasonal cottage country residents, which at peak times of the year swell its population to well in excess of 1.5 million. Although it contains many small and medium-sized urban centres, much of Central Ontario is covered by farms, lakes (with freshwater beaches), rivers or sparsely populated forested land on the southern edge of the Canadian Shield.

==Definitions==

Central Ontario is located within the primary region of Southern Ontario, which places it geographically in the south-central part of the province. Although most of the census divisions (which in Ontario take the form of counties, regional and district municipalities, territorial districts, and some cities) in the south-central tier of the province are commonly grouped as a distinct secondary provincial region, nearly all of them have affiliations or orientations towards other primary or secondary provincial regions to the north, south, and east.

The Parry Sound territorial or judicial district and Muskoka district municipality are geographically within Central Ontario but are administered as part of the primary region of Northern Ontario by federal economic development programs because of these districts&#x27; special economic circumstances. Parry Sound, but not Muskoka, is also classed administratively with an &quot;extended&quot; primary Northern Ontario region by the provincial government for reasons similar to those at the federal level. The southern part of the territorial or judicial district of Nipissing lies in Central Ontario which extends geographically as far north as the Mattawa River. However like Muskoka and Parry Sound, all of Nipissing is treated administratively as part of Northern Ontario.

Grey and Bruce counties may on occasion be included with Central Ontario as they are near or north of 44 degrees latitude, but are far more often treated as part of Southwestern Ontario. They are also part of the Georgian Triangle area, which includes parts of both Central and Southwestern Ontario. Further east at about the same latitude, Simcoe, Peterborough, and Northumberland counties and the City of Kawartha Lakes also have a southward orientation as part of the Greater Golden Horseshoe region centered around the west end of Lake Ontario.

Even further east, Hastings County and Prince Edward County may be considered part of Central Ontario by different sources but are more often included with the secondary region of Eastern Ontario, mostly because they share the same telephone area codes (613 and 343), have better transportation links to this region, and are part of the coverage area of Kingston-area media. This leaves Haliburton County as the only census division in Central Ontario that has no affiliations with any other secondary provincial regions of Ontario.

==Geography==
The Canadian Shield runs over the northern part of Central Ontario, a recreational area with a much-increased summer-time population, including the wilderness of Algonquin Provincial Park. Often referred to as &#x27;Cottage Country&#x27;, this area&#x27;s lakes and rivers are dotted with numerous cottages, some of them seasonal, but in recent years there is a growing trend for some of these &#x27;summer cottages&#x27; to be used as year-round residences due to a number of factors, abundance of outdoor recreation, baby-boom retiree population, increased local services and improved wireless communication.

The Trent-Severn Waterway, constructed over many years in the mid-19th century, spans Central Ontario via a series of boat locks, connecting Georgian Bay with Lake Ontario, entering the bay at Port Severn and Lake Ontario at the Trent River on the Bay of Quinte at Trenton (access to Lake Ontario also can be had by using the Murray Canal). Bypassing many rapids, this waterway is used by pleasure boaters and anglers during the summer months.

Along the northern edge of Central Ontario, are some of the highest elevations in Southern Ontario. These highlands are known as the Opeongo Hills, and they stretch into portions of Eastern Ontario as well.

==Climate==

The climate of this area is a humid continental climate with large seasonal variation moderated somewhat by the Great Lakes. Summers are warm and humid (sometimes hot) but are shorter than further south with generally cooler nights. Winters are cold with significant snowfalls; some snowbelt areas receive an average of over per year. Severe summer storms are also commonplace, particularly in Simcoe County which for Ontario has a high tornado prevalence and was the site of the infamous Barrie Tornado in 1985.

<text>&quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; is a song by American rock band Linkin Park. It is the ninth track from their second studio album, &quot;Meteora&quot;, and was released as the fifth and final single from the album. The song was a hit and it became the fifth consecutive single from &quot;Meteora&quot; to reach number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, a feat unmatched by any other artist in the history of that chart. It was also the third single from the album to reach number one on the Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. The song also peaked at number 20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was certified Gold by the RIAA. The song was also successful in many other countries, except in the UK where it became their first single to chart outside of the top thirty, faring only better than their previous single &quot;From the Inside&quot; which failed to chart. On September 4, 2012, &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot;, &quot;Shadow of the Day&quot;, &quot;New Divide&quot;, and &quot;Burn It Down&quot; were released in the &quot;Linkin Park Pack 02&quot; as downloadable content for the music rhythm video game, &quot;Rock Band 3&quot;.

==Background==
&quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; features a strong electronica-influenced opening, live strings, and guitar. It is an exception from their previous nu metal/rap rock performances as no distorted guitar riffs are included nor are there any rapping vocals from Mike Shinoda, a style they would further explore on their later albums.

A common misconception about the song is that it was written by lead singer Chester Bennington due to his struggles with substance abuse. Band member Mike Shinoda began composing the song before he met Bennington. In the album notes, it was said that the song was originally going to be an instrumental track lasting a little over three and a half minutes, but Shinoda was convinced by the band to change it. The instrumental was later released on the &quot;Underground 9.0&quot; Fan Club as a demo track titled &quot;Drawing&quot;.

The concept for the song came from Shinoda having a lyrical idea of an emotion he had been trying to express for 5 to 6 years before the production of &quot;Meteora&quot;. To him, the lyrics had sounded wrong until listening to the &quot;Drawing&quot; demo one night and they fell together. He showed the lyrics he wrote to Bennington, who read them and teared up, relating to the words to a point where he had difficulty performing the song live for almost a year after the release of &quot;Meteora&quot;; the band would eventually perform it live for the first time at the 2003 Smokeout Festival.

An original 2002 demo of this song with different lyrics and Shinoda on lead vocals appears on &quot;LP Underground XIV&quot;.

==Music video==
The music video for &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; was animated by Gonzo; it was directed by Joe Hahn and co-produced by Eric Calderon. It uses an anime stylization which was supervised by Kazuto Nakazawa, who had previously directed the animated segment of Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s &quot;Kill Bill: Volume 1&quot; among other things. The video was shot of the band performing the song and was later rotoscoped. The video has gone on to be a favorite amongst MTV viewers, going as far as winning the 2004 MTV VMA Viewer&#x27;s Choice Award.

As the video begins, a deceased man is shown lying on a car&#x27;s roof. The surrounding area has been taped off and is littered with investigating police officers as well as onlookers. The video cuts to another character, a girl who breaks a mirror, then writes &quot;I&#x27;m nothing&quot; onto a sheet of paper. She picks up a shard of glass, clenches it in her hand, and smears her blood on the note. Throughout the different scenes, a wisp of smoke meanders around the characters as their stories play out, and the human face of Chester Bennington singing the song flashes various times. Another character is a young woman throwing tomatoes at a man. At a point, the ubiquitous smoke drifts over the deceased man&#x27;s body and enters his mouth, and the video begins to seemingly rewind itself, the woman throwing tomatoes at the man who is her husband or boyfriend, is shown coming home to see the man with another woman in bed suggesting they just had sex. The body of the deceased man begins to rise, falling in reverse, towards the roof of a tall building. It is revealed that the body is that of Chester, who had apparently fallen to his death. Upon landing on the roof, he joins with the rest of the band in performing the remainder of the song.

There is also a second music video, titled &quot;Breaking the Habit (05.28.04 3:37 PM)&quot;, showing the band in their studio performing the song. The video was directed by Kimo Proudfoot and is available on the &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; DVD.

===iTunes===
The video for &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; is available on iTunes, along with a live video version of the video. The live video was taken from the &quot;Road to Revolution: Live at Milton Keynes&quot; DVD concert.

==Reception==
“Breaking the Habit” has been ranked among the best Linkin Park songs by &quot;Billboard&quot; (6th), Stereogum (2nd), and &quot;The Independent&quot;.

==Live performances==
&quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; was not initially performed in the tour for &quot;Meteora&quot;, until it received a full performance on November 15, 2003, in San Bernardino. Since then, it has found itself in the majority of their concerts. From its debut up until the end of the tour cycle for the band&#x27;s 3rd album, &quot;Minutes to Midnight&quot;, &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; was played with a piano intro, where the first verse and chorus were played, and after that, the actual song would start. &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; is also sometimes played live with an extended outro consisting of an a cappella performance of the chorus. After Linkin Park&#x27;s &#x27;Concert for the Philippines&#x27; on January 11, 2014, &quot;Breaking the Habit&quot; was dropped from the band&#x27;s setlist. It would not be played live again until May 17, 2015, at Rock on the Range in Columbus, Ohio.

<text>The Western Independence Party of Manitoba was a political party in the Province of Manitoba, Canada. It was formed in 1987 by Fred Cameron, formerly the leader of the province&#x27;s Western Canada Concept. It is unclear if the Manitoba WIP was simply a renamed WCC or an entirely new organization. The Manitoba WCC seems to have disappeared soon after the WIP&#x27;s founding.

Like the WCC, the WIP promoted independence and nationhood for Canada&#x27;s four western provinces (Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta and British Columbia). The Manitoba branch of the party participated in the province&#x27;s 1988 and 1990 elections, with Cameron as its leader.

The WIP ran 16 candidates in the 1988 election, considerably more than the five run by the WCC in the 1986 election. Cameron ran against Gary Doer in the north Winnipeg riding of Concordia, and received 114 votes. No WIP candidate came close to being elected.

The WIP ran six candidates in the 1990 election. Cameron again ran against Doer, this time receiving 168 votes. Once again, no WIP candidate came close to being elected.

The party was still registered with Elections Manitoba in the 1995 election, but did not run any candidates. In 2003, a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation report on the Saskatchewan WIP made reference to the Manitoba party&#x27;s continued existence. It has not participated in any elections since 1990, however.

<text>Billy Vera (born William Patrick McCord; May 28, 1944) is an American singer, songwriter, actor, author, and music historian. He has been a singer and songwriter since the 1960s, his most successful record being &quot;At This Moment&quot;, a US number 1 hit in 1987. He continues to perform with his group Billy Vera &amp; The Beaters and won a Grammy Award in 2013.

==Life and career==
Vera was born in Riverside, California, and is the son of the radio and television announcer Bill McCord. He grew up in Hartsdale, New York, and attended Our Lady of Mt. Carmel School and Archbishop Stepinac High School. His mother, singer Ann Ryan, was a member of The Ray Charles Singers backing Perry Como on his TV show and his hit records.

===1960s===
Vera began his recording career in 1962 as a member of the Resolutions followed by the regional hit &quot;My Heart Cries&quot;/&quot;All My Love&quot; as Billy Vera &amp; the Contrasts. He went on to a songwriting career in the 1960s, writing for Barbara Lewis, Fats Domino, The Shirelles and Ricky Nelson. He also wrote the garage band classic &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, performed by the Remains and later covered by Robert Plant.

In 1967, Vera with Chip Taylor, wrote &quot;Storybook Children&quot; and brought it to Atlantic Records. The groundbreaking decision to place former gospel singer Judy Clay with Vera in a white-black duet to record the song was a commercial and artistic success. &quot;Storybook Children&quot; is considered to be the first interracial love song to chart in the US. Prior to this, duo Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Red Foley had recorded &quot;Have a Little Talk with Jesus&quot; in 1952, which was a B-side.

The duo became big favorites at Harlem&#x27;s Apollo Theater and their follow-up, &quot;Country Girl-City Man&quot; also charted. He had a solo hit single later that same year with the Bobby Goldsboro penned &quot;With Pen in Hand&quot;, which was also the name of his next album.

===1970s thru 1990s===
The 1970s were a slow period for Vera. In 1977, he issued a solo album called &quot;Out of the Darkness&quot; in the US, and as &quot;Private Clown&quot; in the UK. It failed to have an impact in either country. 1979 began with his song &quot;I Really Got the Feeling&quot;, a number 1 hit for Dolly Parton. During that decade he served as conductor for many oldies acts, including the Shirelles and Ronnie Spector as well as fronting the band at the 1972 Reunion concert of Dion &amp; the Belmonts. Before moving to Los Angeles in 1979, he played many New York area clubs with his band, which included Ben Beckley on drums, Micheal Montecalvo on drums, Tommy Wolk on bass, John Levanthal on guitar, and Joe Renda on keyboards.

Living in Los Angeles and writing songs for Warner Bros. Records, Vera and his old friend, bass player Chuck Fiore, decided to put together a band to play the local club scene. Modeling their band on Ray Charles&#x27;s 1950s band, The Beaters were born. They featured a horn section, as well as a pedal steel guitar, along with drums, piano, Fiore&#x27;s bass, and Vera on guitar and vocals. As a result of the buzz the band generated from their now-legendary Monday midnight shows at the Troubadour, they were offered a recording contract by Alfa Records, a major Japanese record company that had recently opened an American office in Los Angeles. They recorded the band live, at the Roxy (video was produced by Paul Flattery and directed by Bruce Gowers), calling the album &quot;Billy &amp; The Beaters&quot;. The 1981 album yielded the minor hits &quot;I Can Take Care of Myself&quot;, which reached number 39 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in the US, and &quot;At This Moment&quot;, which (initially) charted at number 79. Both songs were credited to Billy &amp; The Beaters.

The following year, Vera recorded a self-titled solo album, with instrumentation by The Muscle Shoals Sound Rhythm Section and produced by Jerry Wexler. However, Vera&#x27;s record deal evaporated almost immediately upon the album&#x27;s release, as Alfa Records closed its U.S. offices in July 1982. The &quot;Billy Vera&quot; album spun off no hits, and failed to chart. A small-label album release from 1983, &quot;The Mystic Sound of Billy Vera&quot;, similarly met with little commercial success.

Vera returned to playing the clubs of Southern California, and resumed calling his backing band &quot;The Beaters&quot;, which featured an ever-shifting lineup of players. In 1985, a producer from the television show &quot;Family Ties&quot; was in the audience and heard the band play &quot;At This Moment&quot;. The song was subsequently featured in 1985 as a backdrop for romantic interludes between lead character Alex P. Keaton (Michael J. Fox) and his girlfriend Ellen (Tracy Pollan). In real life, the two wed and are still married today. Viewers responded by clamoring for the song, and in 1986, Rhino Records released &quot;By Request: The Best of Billy Vera &amp; the Beaters&quot;, which was essentially a reissue of most of the tracks from &quot;Billy &amp; The Beaters&quot;, plus two tracks from &quot;Billy Vera&quot;. The single &quot;At This Moment&quot; became a number one hit on its re-release, reaching the top in January 1987, and remained on the charts for 21 weeks.

Aiming to capitalize on renewed interest in the group, Vera continued with his musical career, releasing another Billy Vera &amp; the Beaters album on Capitol Records in 1988 called &quot;Retro Nuevo&quot;. While the album&#x27;s single, &quot;Between Like and Love&quot; peaked at number 9 on the Adult Contemporary chart, it missed the Hot 100, where Vera has not charted since &quot;At This Moment&quot;.

Before &quot;At This Moment&quot;, Vera had a small career in movies and television including appearances in &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai&quot;, &quot;Late for Dinner&quot;, &quot;The Doors&quot; and soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. &quot;At This Moment&quot; propelled his movie career as he and the Beaters were featured prominently in the Bruce Willis movie &quot;Blind Date&quot;. He appeared in one episode of the TV series &quot;Wiseguy&quot; and had several other roles on shows such as &quot;Baywatch&quot;, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, and a recurring role as Duke on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; as well as nine appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;. These roles would lead him into singing theme songs for TV shows, such as &quot;Empty Nest&quot; and &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, as well as voice acting on Cartoon Network cartoons. He served as band leader on Rick Dees&#x27; short-lived late-night talk show &quot;Into the Night&quot; on ABC in 1990. He also made a guest appearance in an episode of &quot;Double Rush&quot; in 1995.

During that period, Vera co-produced three Lou Rawls albums with his friend Michael Cuscuna, for Blue Note Records, including &quot;At Last&quot;, which reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; jazz chart. Vera also produced Rawls&#x27;s final album, &quot;Rawls Sings Sinatra&quot;, which remained on the jazz chart for over six months. Rawls recorded seven of Vera&#x27;s songs, including &quot;If I Were A Magician&quot; (1989), &quot;Room with a View&quot; and &quot;You Can&#x27;t Go Home&quot;. In 1990, Vera&#x27;s tune &quot;Papa Come Quick (Jody &amp; Chico)&quot; was included on Bonnie Raitt&#x27;s album, &quot;Luck of the Draw&quot;. Vera also recorded as a duo with Nona Hendryx on the 1992 album &quot;You Have To Cry Some Time&quot;.

===2000s and 2010s===
Currently, the Beaters are still playing the Southern California club scene, and Vera continues his work as a music historian. He has helped produce, archive, and write liner notes for over 200 reissue albums and sets, from artists such as Little Richard, Sam Cooke, Louis Jordan, Ray Charles, and Louis Prima, among others.

Vera has been the voice for AM/PM Mini Mart commercials since 1999 and is one of the top voice-over artists in Los Angeles. &quot;At This Moment&quot; was included on Michael Bublé&#x27;s number one album, &quot;Crazy Love&quot;. Vera&#x27;s CD &quot;Hopeless Romantic: The Best Of Billy Vera &amp; The Beaters&quot;, was issued on Shout Factory Records, and &quot;The Billy Vera Story&quot; was released on Rock Beat Records. With his old friend Evie Sands, Billy recorded &quot;Queen of Diamonds/Jack of Hearts&quot;, a CD featuring songs by their early mentor Chip Taylor.

In 2015, Vera released &quot;Billy Vera: Big Band Jazz&quot; with arrangements by Chris Walden, a tribute to the black songwriters of the 1920s, 30s and 40s. It was issued on Varese-Sarabande Records, and Vera has appeared with a big 18-piece band in New York City, Hollywood, and at various jazz festivals.

Vera returned to the studio in 2019 to record the album &quot;Timeless&quot; with three of the Beaters, augmented by some of LA&#x27;s top sidemen.

Vera also has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at the corner of Vine Street and Yucca Street, right in front of the Capitol Records Building in Hollywood. He won a 2013 Grammy Award for Best Album Notes for the Ray Charles box set &quot;Singular Genius: The Complete ABC Singles&quot;.

Book publishing came calling and in 2016, his first effort, &quot;Vintage Neon: Los Angeles, 1979&quot;, featuring photographs from Vera&#x27;s nocturnal hunts for old neon signs was released. His second book, a memoir entitled &quot;Harlem to Hollywood&quot; was released in 2017. Reviews hailed it as &quot;an astounding story...the purest treatise on the subject ever produced.&quot; Award-winning documentarian Alan Swyer has directed a documentary on Billy Vera, also titled &quot;Harlem to Hollywood&quot; now available on Amazon. For BMG Books, Billy has written &quot;Rip It Up: The Specialty Records Story&quot;, for release in November 2019. In 2020, Vera&#x27;s first novel, &quot;A Dollop of Toothpaste&quot;, was issued. It&#x27;s a dystopian story and political satire in which the Mafia returns to their rightful place in society.

<doc id="921972" wikidata="Q284166" url="?curid=921972" title="Sondra Locke">
<text>Sandra Louise Anderson (née Smith; May 28, 1944 – November 3, 2018), professionally known as Sondra Locke, was an American actress, director, and singer.

An alumna of Middle Tennessee State University, Locke broke into regional show business with assorted posts at the Nashville-based radio station WSM-AM, then segued into television as a promotions assistant for WSM-TV. She performed in the theater company Circle Players Inc. while employed at WSM. In 1968, she made her film debut in &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot;, for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and earned dual Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress and New Star of the Year.

Locke went on to appear in such box-office successes as &quot;Willard&quot; (1971), &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; (1976), &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; (1977), &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot; (1978), &quot;Bronco Billy&quot; (1980), &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot; (1980), and &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; (1983). She worked regularly with Clint Eastwood, who was her companion from 1975 to 1989 despite their marriages to other people. She also directed four films, notably &quot;Impulse&quot; (1990). She published an autobiography, &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Very Ugly: A Hollywood Journey&quot;, in 1997.

Locke&#x27;s persona belied her age. She claimed to have been born several years later than 1944, often playing roles written for women far younger than herself, and kept her true age a secret throughout her career. For reasons never made clear, her death was not publicly announced and was only confirmed by vital statistics six weeks after she died of cardiac arrest at the age of 74. From 1967 until her death, Locke was the wife of sculptor Gordon Leigh Anderson, in a mixed-orientation union they reputedly never consummated.

Sandra Louise Smith was born on May 28, 1944, the daughter of New York City native Raymond Smith, then a soldier stationed at Camp Forrest, and Pauline Bayne, a pencil factory worker from Huntsville, Alabama, who was of mostly Scottish descent, with matrilineages in South Carolina extending back to the late 18th century. Locke&#x27;s parents separated before her birth. In her autobiography, Locke noted, &quot;although Momma would not admit it, I knew Mr. Smith never married my mother.&quot; She had a maternal half-brother, Donald (born April 26, 1946), from Bayne&#x27;s subsequent brief marriage to William B. Elkins. When Bayne married Alfred Locke in 1948, Sandra and Donald assumed his surname. She grew up in Shelbyville, Tennessee, where her stepfather owned a construction company. The family later moved to nearby Wartrace. Self-described as introspective and ambitious, Locke started working part-time at age 16, drove her own car, and had a phone installed in her bedroom. She was raised a Baptist, but stopped going to church as an adult.

Locke was a cheerleader and class valedictorian in junior high, as well as editor-in-chief of &quot;The Royal&quot; yearbook and a star player on the girls&#x27; basketball team. From 1958, she attended Shelbyville Central High School, where she again served as valedictorian and was voted &quot;Duchess of Studiousness&quot; by classmates. She continued to play basketball at SCHS, served as parent–teacher–student association representative, and was president of the French club. Regardless, she was not considered &quot;date material&quot; by the more socially prominent boys in her class. Locke&#x27;s first beau, according to locals&#x27; reminiscences, was Fred Thomas Jones, a carpenter&#x27;s son. Her graduation yearbook listed her grade average 97.72% and her ambition &quot;always to take disappointments with a smile.&quot; In 1962, Locke matriculated at Middle Tennessee State University (then Middle Tennessee State College) in Murfreesboro on a full scholarship. Majoring in theatre, she was a member of the Alpha Psi Omega honor society while at MTSU, and appeared on stage in &quot;Life with Father&quot; and &quot;The Crucible&quot;. She dropped out after completing two semesters of study.

In or around 1963, Locke essentially broke off contact with her family, concluding: &quot;It made no sense for any of us to spend our lives pretending to have relationships that did not really exist.&quot; She never knew her biological father, and did not attend the funerals of her mother (deceased 1997) or stepfather (deceased 2007), nor did she have anything to do with her brother, sister-in-law and three nieces. Donald blamed Gordon Anderson—Locke&#x27;s best friend since adolescence and future husband—for the rift, claiming Anderson had &quot;an almost hypnotic spell on her.&quot;

Locke held a variety of jobs, including as a bookkeeper for Tyson Foods and receptionist in a real-estate office. For a time, she lived at South Water Apartments in the commuter town of Gallatin. In 1964, she joined the staff at radio station WSM-AM 650 in Nashville, and was promoted to its television affiliate WSM-Channel 4 the following year. Locke&#x27;s biggest coup while employed there was hosting actor Robert Loggia when he visited Nashville to promote his TV pilot &quot;T.H.E. Cat&quot;, during which he &quot;flirted outrageously&quot; with Locke. She also modeled for &quot;The Tennessean&quot; fashion page, acted in commercials for Rich-Schwartz ladies apparel and Southerland Gel mattresses, among others, and gained further stage experience in productions for Circle Players Inc. In 1966, the 22-year-old appeared in a UPI wire photo that showed her cavorting in new-fallen snow. Within one year of this exposure, she decided to pursue a career in film, and changed the spelling of her first name to avoid being called Sandy.

==Career==

===Rise to prominence===

In July 1967, Locke competed with 590 other Southern actresses and dozens of New York hopefuls for the part of Mick Kelly in a big-screen adaptation of Carson McCullers&#x27; novel &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot; opposite Alan Arkin. For the first audition in Birmingham, Alabama, then-fiancé Gordon Anderson gave his bride a so-called Hollywood makeover; he bound her bosom, bleached her eyebrows, and carefully fixed her hair, makeup, and outfit so as to create a more gamine appearance. Locke lied about her age, shaving off six years to make herself seem younger—a pretense she would keep up not only for the rest of her career, but also the entirety of her public life. After callbacks in New Orleans and Manhattan, she was cast in the role by recommendation from entertainment coordinator Marion Dougherty. The film&#x27;s shooting wrapped in the fall of 1967. Locke, who had quit her post at WSM, opted to wait until its release before choosing a follow-up project. In the nine-month interim, she was asked to play the female protagonists in &quot;True Grit&quot; and Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot;. She said she turned down the former on the grounds that it was too similar to the role she had just done, and the latter because of the nudity required.

&quot;Heart&quot; came out in the summer of 1968 to critical acclaim. Locke&#x27;s performance garnered her an Academy Award nomination, as well as a pair of Golden Globe nominations for Best Supporting Actress and Most Promising Newcomer – Female. Being the oldest nominee in the latter category, she concealed this distinction through retconning with aid from studio publicists. At a film exhibitor convention in Kansas City, she won the Show-A-Rama Award from the Motion Picture Association of America as &quot;Most Promising New Star of the Year&quot;. Although her salary for the film was reported as $15,000 in contemporary articles, Locke later claimed it was less than one-third that amount.

===Commercial ups and downs, missed roles, TV work===

Hoping to shed the plain image she accentuated in her screen debut, in January 1969, Locke posed for a seminude pictorial by photographer Frank Bez, which was published in the December issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;. The &quot;Playboy&quot; layout established Locke&#x27;s status as a sex symbol, and the images were recycled in other men&#x27;s magazines as her fame increased. Nearly three decades later, Locke said she still got those photos in fan mail requesting her autograph.

Her next role was as Melisse in &quot;Cover Me Babe&quot; (1970), originally titled &quot;Run Shadow Run&quot;, opposite Robert Forster. She made it as part of a $150,000 three-picture deal with 20th Century Fox, and was compensated for the other two which never materialized. It was announced that she would play the lead in &quot;Lovemakers&quot;—a film adaptation of Robert Nathan&#x27;s novel &quot;The Color of Evening&quot;—but no movie resulted. Locke was offered Barbara Hershey&#x27;s role in &quot;Last Summer&quot; (1969), but her management turned it down without telling her. Shortly afterwards, she passed on the lead in &quot;My Sweet Charlie&quot; (1970), which won an Emmy for its eventual star Patty Duke. She also declined the part of Bruce Dern&#x27;s pregnant wife in &quot;They Shoot Horses, Don&#x27;t They?&quot; (1969).

In 1971, Locke co-starred with Bruce Davison and Ernest Borgnine in the psychological thriller &quot;Willard&quot;, which became a surprise box-office smash. Locke felt overqualified for her role, but did it as a favor to Davison, who at the time was her unofficial paramour. She was then featured in William A. Fraker&#x27;s underseen mystery &quot;A Reflection of Fear&quot; (1972), which required her to project the image of a character half her age, and held the title role in first-time director Michael Barry&#x27;s &quot;avant garde&quot; drama &quot;The Second Coming of Suzanne&quot; (1974), winner of three gold medals at the Atlanta Film Festival. Both films were shelved for two years before finally opening in arthouse cinemas, attracting little attention at first. Over time, &quot;Suzanne&quot; has accrued a cult following, while &quot;Reflection&quot; is cited as an early example of media portrayals of transgender people.

In 1973, Locke was attached to star in &quot;Terminal Circle&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s a woman&#x27;s role that comes along once in a lifetime,&quot; she said. The San Francisco-based film was to be directed by Mal Karman and shot by cinematographer Robert Primes, who did camerawork for &quot;Gimme Shelter&quot;, but it was scrapped for lack of funds. She was up for a big part in &quot;Earthquake&quot; (1974), but lost out to Geneviève Bujold.

Locke guest starred on top-rated television drama series throughout the first half of the 1970s, including &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;Cannon&quot; (as two different characters), &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot;, and &quot;Kung Fu&quot;. She was advised by her agents to stay away from TV, but thought it foolish to sit around not working between films. In the 1972 &quot;Night Gallery&quot; episode &quot;A Feast of Blood&quot;, she played the victim of a curse planted by Norman Lloyd; the recipient of a brooch that devoured her. Lloyd acted with Locke again in &quot;Gondola&quot; (1973), a racially themed, three-character teleplay co-starring her real-life significant other at the time, Bo Hopkins, and commended the actress for &quot;a beautiful performance – perhaps her best ever.&quot; Ron Harper, who worked with Locke on the short-lived 1974 show &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, was even more effusive: &quot;After acting with her in a couple of scenes, there was something so feminine about her that I could picture myself easily falling for her ... She&#x27;s one of those women who exudes femininity, and you just become so attracted to that.&quot;

===Films with Clint Eastwood===
In mid-1975, Locke was cast in &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; as the love interest of Clint Eastwood&#x27;s eponymous character. Locke said she chose the role for its exposure, following a run of unremarkable credits. She took a pay cut just to be in the film; her salary for &quot;Josey Wales&quot; was $18,000—less than half of what she had earned for her previous job. The film emerged as one of the top-15 grossing films of 1976 and revived Locke&#x27;s career. She followed it up with a lead role alongside Eastwood in the popular action road film &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; (1977), the duo replacing Steve McQueen and Barbra Streisand, who bowed out from the production owing to a reported clash of egos. Its pre-publicity touted Locke as &quot;the first actress ever to be in a Clint Eastwood movie and get equal billing on screen with the macho star.&quot; Eastwood predicted that she would win an Oscar for her performance. Locke was not even nominated, and received mixed critical response at best; on the upside, Vincent Canby of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;Locke is not only pretty, but also occasionally genuinely funny&quot; and &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Kevin Thomas stated that Locke &quot;has not received such a rich opportunity since her Academy Award-nominated debut&quot;; in contrast, Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said, &quot;she&#x27;s wasted here&quot; and &quot;TV Guide&quot; felt that &quot;Locke is simply repulsive.&quot;

Over the course of their decade-and-a-half-long personal relationship, Locke did not work in any capacity on any theatrical motion picture other than with Eastwood except for 1977&#x27;s experimental horror Western &quot;The Shadow of Chikara&quot;. The home-invasion film &quot;Death Game&quot; (1977), though released after they became an item, was actually shot in 1974. &quot;Clint wanted me to work only with him,&quot; said Locke. &quot;He didn&#x27;t like the idea of me being away from him.&quot;

In 1978, Locke and Eastwood appeared with an orangutan named Manis in that year&#x27;s fourth-highest grossing film, &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot;. She portrayed country singer Lynn Halsey-Taylor in the adventure-comedy. Its 1980 sequel &quot;Any Which Way You Can&quot;—for which Locke earned a six-figure salary plus a share of the profits—was nearly as successful. Locke recorded several songs for the soundtracks of these films, and was whispered to be shopping for a record deal at the time. On the coattails of the franchise&#x27;s success, she performed live in concert (one-off gigs) with The Everly Brothers, Eddie Rabbitt, and Tom Jones.

During this period, Eastwood did a few movies that had no prominent female character for Locke to play. In the meantime, she accepted some television offers, co-starring with an all-female ensemble cast in &quot;Friendships, Secrets and Lies&quot; (1979) and portraying big band-era vocalist Rosemary Clooney in &quot;Rosie: The Rosemary Clooney Story&quot; (1982). While the biopic followed Clooney from ages 17 to 40, Locke was 38 when she played the role, and though hardly counting as a proper exception due to its nonlinear structure, this marked the only time she played a mother onscreen. As part of the promotional push behind &quot;Rosie&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot;″s Rick Du Brow wrote a flattering article in which he called Locke &quot;one of the most-watched and popular motion picture actresses in the world.&quot;

Locke starred as a bitter heiress who joins a traveling Wild West show in &quot;Bronco Billy&quot; (1980), her only film with Eastwood not to reach blockbuster status, though it still ranked among the annual box-office top 25. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Janet Maslin noticed that &quot;each of them works more delicately here than they have together previously&quot; and the film&#x27;s director of photography, David Worth, enthused how &quot;being able to capture the true love between Clint and Sondra was very special.&quot; Locke cited &quot;Bronco Billy&quot; and &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; as her favorites of the movies they made. The couple&#x27;s final collaboration as performers was &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; (1983), the highest-grossing film in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; franchise, in which Locke played an artist with her own code of vigilante justice. Her fee was a reported $350,000.

Locke never appeared in a wide release after &quot;Sudden Impact&quot;. The film premiered five months short of her 40th birthday, declared by &quot;People&quot; as &quot;the pre-Fonda age cutoff for actresses.&quot; Despite Locke&#x27;s past nomination for an Academy Award and repeat appearances in box-office hits, she had failed to achieve first-magnitude stardom or win the affection of the moviegoing public. By 1979, the year Eastwood and she made their fourth film together, accusations of nepotism arose. Cultural critic Joe Queenan, writing for &quot;Mail &amp; Guardian&quot;, would express particular contempt for her in a 2010 editorial about Eastwood&#x27;s career, believing that &quot;his worst movies, without question, are the ones he made with Sondra Locke, who briefly played Linda McCartney to Eastwood&#x27;s Sir Paul.&quot; In late 1983, Locke announced plans to develop and star in a movie about Marie Antoinette, but the project fell apart. Eastwood then directed Locke in a 1985 &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; episode entitled &quot;Vanessa in the Garden&quot;, with Harvey Keitel.

===Directing===

Locke made her feature directorial debut with &quot;Ratboy&quot; (1986), a parable about a youth who is part rat and part human, produced by Eastwood&#x27;s company Malpaso. When asked why she had been absent from her longtime beau&#x27;s recent star vehicles, Locke replied simply, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t right for the roles.&quot; &quot;Ratboy&quot; had very limited distribution in the United States, where it was a critical and financial flop, but was well received in Europe, with French newspaper &quot;Le Parisien&quot; calling it the highlight of the Deauville Film Festival. Locke, who also appeared in the lead role alongside Sharon Baird as the title character, was nominated for a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress.

Locke&#x27;s second foray behind the camera was &quot;Impulse&quot; (1990), starring Theresa Russell as a police officer on the vice squad who goes undercover as a prostitute. Siskel &amp; Ebert gave the film &quot;two thumbs up&quot;. In a subsequent interview with Siskel, Locke said she was not eager to act again. &quot;If you love the craft of filmmaking as much as I do, it&#x27;s hard to go back to acting after you&#x27;ve tasted the high of directing.&quot;

Immediately following the completion of &quot;Impulse&quot;, two of its co-stars, Jeff Fahey and George Dzundza, were hired by Locke&#x27;s now ex-boyfriend Eastwood to appear in &quot;White Hunter Black Heart&quot;, a move which raised eyebrows among the film community.

After a long interruption in her career due to legal difficulties and health issues, Locke directed the made-for-television film &quot;Death in Small Doses&quot; (1995), based on a true story, and the independent feature &quot;Trading Favors&quot; (1997), starring Rosanna Arquette.

===Memoir and final projects===
In 1997, Locke&#x27;s autobiography &quot;The Good, the Bad, and the Very Ugly: A Hollywood Journey&quot; was published by William Morrow and Company. In it, she called Eastwood &quot;a completely evil, manipulating, lying excuse for a man.&quot; Eastwood&#x27;s lawyers sent a warning letter to the publisher, and although no slander charges arose, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; canceled a scheduled interview with Locke. She was also bumped from &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, and in her words, &quot;shut out of most venues to promote the book, in particular the networks.&quot; The book received a supportive rave review from &quot;New York Daily News&quot; writer Liz Smith, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Dana Kennedy dismissed the book as a &quot;peculiar, not terribly consequential, life story.&quot;

Locke told a Spanish website that she had been informed that &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; originally planned to publish a positive review, but for reasons unclear, it was pulled and a negative review appeared, instead. &quot;The Advocate&quot;, a monthly LGBT-interest magazine, was set to do a big article on Locke&#x27;s book; suddenly and uncharacteristically, Eastwood gave &quot;The Advocate&quot; an interview, and they decided not to run the piece. She reflected in 2012: &quot;Clint has said so many bad things about me to the media since we split up, and he has so much more access and power to do that. He&#x27;s said things that were hurtful to my character and hurtful to me professionally.&quot; Locke was nonetheless grateful to have a platform at all, stating: &quot;It was a miracle that a major publisher took it.&quot;

The day after the book&#x27;s release, &quot;Eastwood on Eastwood&quot;, a feature-length overview of her ex&#x27;s career directed by Richard Schickel, premiered on TNT. John Hartl of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; emphasized that &quot;clips from the Locke/Eastwood movies have been edited so carefully that she doesn&#x27;t appear to have been in any of them. It&#x27;s like making a documentary about Humphrey Bogart and failing to mention Lauren Bacall.&quot; Locke would once again be notably deleted from a montage commemorating Eastwood at the 2002 Maui Film Festival.

After 13 years away from acting, Locke re-emerged in 1999 to appear opposite Dennis Hopper in &quot;The Prophet&#x27;s Game&quot; and Wings Hauser in &quot;Clean and Narrow&quot;, the latter shot in Texas. Both films went straight to video. About that time, she planned to direct &quot;a two-guys-on-the-run film&quot; called &quot;The Hard Easy&quot;, which did not eventuate. In 2014, Locke served as an executive producer on the Eli Roth film &quot;Knock Knock&quot;, starring Keanu Reeves. She came out of retirement once more in 2016, shooting Alan Rudolph&#x27;s indie &quot;Ray Meets Helen&quot; with Keith Carradine. The film had only a brief run in three theaters in May 2018, less than six months before Locke died.

==Other activities==
===Philanthropy===
In the 1960s during her tenure at WSM, Locke participated in the annual United Cerebral Palsy (UCP) telethons. One year, she toured Birmingham with folk singer Richard Law.

Following her then-partner&#x27;s April 15, 1986, inauguration as the 30th mayor of Carmel-by-the-Sea, California, Locke became the &quot;de facto&quot; First Lady of Carmel.

In 1992, she served as honorary chairwoman for the &quot;Starry, Starry Night&quot; silent auction in Costa Mesa, California, to benefit Human Options, a shelter for victims of domestic violence. &quot;Being a woman, I have great empathy for these women. I can understand how stranded they must feel, how hard it is to change one&#x27;s life,&quot; Locke said.

===Wellness===
By the end of the 1970s, Locke became a follower of research scientist Durk Pearson&#x27;s views on longevity. In the book &quot;Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach&quot; (1982), which promotes the theory that free radicals are a primary cause of aging and recommends antioxidant supplements to prevent the damage they supposedly do, Locke was written about as a pseudonymous celebrity (Miss Jones) using the principles.

Locke was an avid sportswoman. In 1979 and 1982, respectively, for instance, she competed in the John Denver Celebrity Pro-Am ski tournament at Heavenly Mountain Resort and the Senator&#x27;s Cup at John Gardiner&#x27;s Tennis Ranch.

==Personal life==

===Marriage===
On September 25, 1967, Locke married sculptor Gordon Leigh Anderson (born August 2, 1944, Batesville, Arkansas) at the First Presbyterian Church in Nashville, one week after &quot;The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter&quot; commenced principal photography. Dr. Walter Rowe Courtenay presided over the ceremony. They remained married for 51 years until her death in 2018.

Locke had known Anderson since at least the late 1950s; accounts as to when they met vary by as much as four years. In early 1969, as Locke was flooded with script offers after her Oscar nomination, Anderson and she left Tennessee and moved into a condo at The Andalusia in West Hollywood.

According to a 1989 affidavit, the marriage was &quot;tantamount to sister and brother&quot; and they never consummated it. Anderson was gay. Locke, testifying under oath to a jury, characterized her husband as being &quot;more like a sister to me&quot; and explained, &quot;it&#x27;s funny the sort of cultural changes, but in those days males and females never lived together unless they were married.&quot; According to her death certificate, the two were residing at the same address when she died, and he was the person who registered her death.

Anderson is a central presence in Locke&#x27;s autobiography, but she does not elaborate on her reasons for marrying him beyond the following passage:

===Romances===

Given that Locke waited decades to confirm that her marriage was platonic, most of her actual romantic attachments went unpublicized. In the mid-1960s, she dated her supervisor at WSM-TV&#x27;s advertising department, Brad Crandall. She started as secretary to Tom Griscom in local sales for WSM Radio. According to co-worker Alan Nelson, fellow staff members perceived Locke&#x27;s promotion as an act of nepotism.

George Crook, a cameraman for WSM, squired Locke to Nashville society events such as the 1965 hunt ball. He later got into local politics and was elected mayor of Belle Meade in 2000. Another early boyfriend, personal injury attorney Gary Gober, starred with Locke in Circle Players&#x27; productions while attending Vanderbilt University Law School. Locke also dated sportscaster Larry Munson prior to marrying Anderson.

During her marriage, Locke was rumored to have been linked amorously to co-stars Robert Fields (&quot;Cover Me Babe&quot;), Bruce Davison (&quot;Willard&quot;), Paul Sand (&quot;The Second Coming of Suzanne&quot;), and Bo Hopkins (&quot;Gondola&quot;), as well as producer Hawk Koch, real-estate agent Herb Goldfarb, and John F. Kennedy&#x27;s nephew Robert Shriver. For a while in the early 1970s, she shared a liaison with married actor David Soul after they played siblings in an episode of &quot;Cannon&quot;.

Locke referred to these intervals as &quot;casually exploring for a romantic relationship,&quot; noting that she had not fallen in love with any of the men. &quot;Love ... was not something to search out actively; it finds you, I believed.&quot;

===Life with Eastwood===

Locke and actor/director Clint Eastwood entered a domestic partnership in October 1975. She first met Eastwood in 1972, when she unsuccessfully lobbied for the title role in his film &quot;Breezy&quot; (1973); they became involved upon arrival at the shooting location of &quot;The Outlaw Josey Wales&quot; (1976) in Page, Arizona. &quot;It was just an immediate attraction between the two of us,&quot; Locke recalled in a 2012 documentary. She further revealed that they made love on their first date. Locke had simultaneously been wooed by screenwriter Philip Kaufman, but chose Eastwood over him. After wrapping the film in December 1975, the couple shuttled between Eastwood&#x27;s houses in Carmel and L.A.&#x27;s Sherman Oaks neighborhood, as well as rented homes in San Francisco and its elite suburb Tiburon. They eventually settled at 846 Stradella Road in Bel-Air, which Eastwood still owned at the time of Locke&#x27;s death.

Eastwood was married during the early years of their relationship, before their affair became public in 1977, but his marriage was a nominal one just as Locke&#x27;s was; he had sired at least two publicly unacknowledged children outside the marriage and confided he had &quot;never been in love before.&quot; Locke claimed Eastwood even sang &quot;She Made Me Monogamous&quot; to her. Eastwood&#x27;s wife Maggie Johnson lived on a colossal estate in Pebble Beach, where Eastwood rarely stayed, and Johnson and he were understood to have had an open marriage from the start. &quot;I never knew I could love somebody so much, and feel so peaceful about it at the same time,&quot; Locke said he told her. Conversely, the media&#x27;s going myth was that Eastwood &quot;left&quot; or &quot;walked out on&quot; his wife for Locke as opposed to simply giving up the facade. Locke resented having her romance with Eastwood labeled merely as an affair and being made to feel sordid as if she had &quot;stolen&quot; a married man, but did not contemporaneously refute such notions.

Late in the 1970s, Locke became pregnant by Eastwood twice; she terminated both pregnancies. &quot;I&#x27;d feel sorry for any child that had me for a mother,&quot; she told syndicated columnist Dick Kleiner in 1969. In 1979, at the age of 35, Locke underwent a tubal ligation at UCLA Medical Center, citing Eastwood&#x27;s adamancy that parenthood would not fit into their lifestyle. When this became public knowledge a decade after the fact, Eastwood issued a statement:

Locke professed mixed feelings on the matter, stating in one chapter of her autobiography that she was grateful she had not had Eastwood&#x27;s children, while writing in another, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t help but think that that baby, with both Clint&#x27;s and my best qualities, would be extraordinary.&quot; Eastwood claimed Locke told him on multiple occasions that she never wanted to have children.

Eastwood and Locke were still cohabiting, when in the latter half of the 1980s, he secretly fathered another woman&#x27;s two children—a fact that did not come to light for almost 20 years. Despite her affirmed ignorance, Locke sensed growing tension in the relationship around 1985, recollecting, &quot;although I definitely still loved Clint, I didn&#x27;t much like him, nor did I much trust him anymore.&quot; In retrospect, she gathered, &quot;either he changed from white to black, or I had been living with somebody I didn&#x27;t even know.&quot;

====Palimony suit====
According to court testimony, Locke confronted Eastwood over his passive-aggressive behavior on December 29, 1988, eliciting estrangement between the couple. Locke testified that after Eastwood and she made their final joint appearance on January 6 at the American Cinema Awards, they spent exactly two nights together, without intimate contact. Eastwood then effectively vacated their Bel-Air mansion, sleeping in the adjacent caretakers&#x27; quarters or at his apartment in Burbank. Locke thought Eastwood was acting out &quot;because he wasn&#x27;t number one at the box office anymore, or because he was facing his mortality.&quot; (Eastwood was 58 at the time.) As far as she was concerned, their relationship was still salvageable. At any rate, she called divorce lawyer Norman Oberstein to explore her options should the separation be permanent. Unbeknownst to Locke, Eastwood eavesdropped on those consultations by means of a wiretap that he placed on their home phone in early March.

On the morning of April 3 or 4, Eastwood complained in the kitchen that Locke was &quot;sitting on [his] only real estate in Los Angeles&quot; and bolted. Locke later defensively declared: &quot;Clint is not good at direct communication. He really is a man of few words. You might just as well have a direct confrontation with a wall.&quot; On April 10, 1989, Malpaso employees changed the locks on the family residence, moved Locke&#x27;s possessions into storage, and posted security guards at the front gate per Eastwood&#x27;s order. Locke was shooting &quot;Impulse&quot; at the time of the lockout. She filed a $70 million palimony suit on April 26, charging Eastwood with breach of contract, emotional distress, forcible entry, and possession of stolen goods. Forced abortions and compulsory sterilization were also cited, though Locke later recategorized those operations as a &quot;mutual decision&quot;.

During their 14 years as husband and wife &quot;de facto&quot;, Locke and Eastwood had occupied seven homes and acquired four, including a retreat in Sun Valley, Idaho, and the Rising River Ranch near Cassel, California. Locke sought half of Eastwood&#x27;s earnings and an equal division of property, requesting title to the house in Bel-Air and to the Gothic-style West Hollywood place Eastwood had leased to Gordon Anderson since 1982. She also asked Judge Dana Senit Henry to bar Eastwood from the Bel-Air house &quot;because I know him to have a terrible temper ... and he has frequently been abusive to me.&quot;

Locke battled Eastwood in court for 19 months; she developed breast cancer during proceedings, and said the treatments sapped her will to fight. In November 1990, the parties reached a private settlement wherein Eastwood set up a $1.5 million multiyear film development/directing pact for Locke at Warner Bros. in exchange for dropping the suit. She was awarded the West Hollywood property (valued at $2.2 million), $450,000 cash, and unspecified monthly support payments, as well.

The breakup affected Locke&#x27;s social life. Her closest friends had been the wives of Eastwood&#x27;s colleagues: Maria Shriver, Cynthia Sikes Yorkin, and Lili Fini Zanuck, all 10–11 years younger than Locke and married to film-industry heavyweights Arnold Schwarzenegger, Bud Yorkin, and Richard D. Zanuck, respectively. Locke&#x27;s friendships with those women gradually faded as their husbands ghosted her. The female comrades Locke credited with loyalty and support were those she had known before Eastwood—art director Elayne Barbara Ceder, whom she met on &quot;The Second Coming of Suzanne&quot;, and realtor Denise Fraker, wife of &quot;A Reflection of Fear&quot; director William A. Fraker.

====Fraud suit====
Between 1990 and 1993, Warner Bros. rejected more than 30 scripts that Locke pitched to the studio—including those for &quot;Junior&quot; (1994) and &quot;Addicted to Love&quot; (1997)—and refused to let her direct any of their in-house projects. When her contract had yielded no directing assignments three years in, Locke became convinced the deal was a sham. She began to seek corroboration, and came across incriminating printouts from WB&#x27;s bookkeeping records. Locke contended that the money WB pretended they were paying her came from Eastwood&#x27;s pocket and was laundered through the operating budget of &quot;Unforgiven&quot; (1992). In June 1995, she sued him again, for fraud and breach of fiduciary duty. According to Locke&#x27;s attorney Peggy Garrity, Eastwood committed &quot;the ultimate betrayal&quot; by arranging the &quot;bogus&quot; deal as a way to keep her out of work. Garrity added that Eastwood had held out the allegedly counterfeit deal &quot;like a dangled carrot&quot; to persuade Locke to drop the earlier palimony suit. Locke said that she &quot;was stunned and outraged at the way I had been tricked and cheated a second time.&quot;

The case went to trial in September 1996. One juror divulged that the panel sided with Locke by a 10-to-2 vote (nine votes are needed for a verdict) and were only debating the amount. Before any court decision could be made, Locke settled the case with Eastwood for an undisclosed amount of money. The outcome, Locke said, sent a &quot;loud and clear&quot; message to Hollywood, &quot;that people cannot get away with whatever they want to just because they&#x27;re powerful.&quot; According to Locke, &quot;in this business, people get so accustomed to being abused, they just accept the abuse and say, &#x27;Well, that&#x27;s just the way it is.&#x27; Well, it isn&#x27;t.&quot;

For his part, Eastwood waved the lawsuit off as a &quot;dime-novel plot,&quot; continuing, &quot;it&#x27;s all about money ... about getting something for nothing.&quot; He accused Locke of using her cancer to gain the jury&#x27;s sympathy: &quot;She plays the victim very well. Unfortunately, she had cancer and so she plays that card.&quot;

Locke brought a separate action against Warner Bros. for allegedly conspiring with Eastwood to sabotage her directorial career. As had happened with the previous lawsuit, this ended in an out-of-court settlement, in May 1999. By then, Locke had fired Garrity and hired Neil Papiano to represent her. The agreement with Warner Bros., Locke said, was &quot;a happy ending.&quot; &quot;I feel elated. This has been the best day in a long, long time,&quot; she told reporters on courthouse steps. The case is used in some modern law-school contract textbooks to illustrate the legal concept of good faith.

===Illness; last relationship===

A lifelong nonsmoker (save for a few film roles), Locke practiced Transcendental Meditation and worked out with weights, though she hated running. In September 1990, she confirmed reports that she had breast cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philadelphia Enquirer 9/20/90&quot;&gt;&quot;Sick-bay report&quot;. &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. September 20, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Due to factors in my personal life, I have sustained two years of extreme and unnecessary stress, which my doctors tell me has been my enemy,&quot; Locke said at the time. She added that Eastwood never reached out to her after her diagnosis: &quot;He doesn&#x27;t care if I live or die.&quot;

Locke underwent a double mastectomy at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, followed by chemotherapy. During treatment, she began dating Scott Cunneen (born September 10, 1961, Long Beach, California), an intern assigned to perform the postsurgical checkup. Unfazed by their 17-year age difference—and the fact Locke was only three years younger than his mother—they soon went public with the romance, dining at paparazzi hotspot Spago on one of their early dates in November 1990. Cunneen moved in with her in the spring of 1991. She called it a &quot;real, supportive, and equal relationship.&quot;

In February 2001, Locke purchased a six-bedroom gated mansion in the Hollywood Hills, where she resided for the remainder of her life. Built in 1925, the home&#x27;s interior was redesigned to look like Locke&#x27;s old house on Stradella Road. Cunneen and she eventually broke up, albeit without publicity, since she had faded from public view.

In 2004, Locke settled a personal-injury lawsuit brought against her in Beverly Hills by one Mark Feigin, whom she had struck with a car the previous year.

In 2015, after a 25-year period of apparent remission, Locke&#x27;s cancer returned and metastasized to her bones.

==Death==

Locke died at age 74 on November 3, 2018, at her Los Angeles home from cardiac arrest related to breast and bone cancer. Her remains were cremated on November 9 at Pierce Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park and Mortuary and the ashes were given to her widower, Gordon Anderson. Locke bequeathed Anderson an estimated fortune of $20 million and seemed to have always supported him financially.

===Media blackout===
Locke&#x27;s death was kept secret until December 13, when Radar Online broke the news the day before Eastwood&#x27;s latest film &quot;The Mule&quot; (2018) opened in theaters nationwide, citing the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health. The Associated Press said, &quot;it is not clear why it took nearly six weeks to come to light.&quot; Anderson, according to the scant AP report, was unreachable, and a representative for Locke ignored &quot;People&quot;″s request for comment. So hidden had basic facts been kept, that &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted 41 days after she died: &quot;A list of survivors was not immediately [&quot;sic&quot;] available.&quot;

Locke&#x27;s death received no television coverage except for a 15-second spot on &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot;. Eastwood did not comment on the death, nor did any of Locke&#x27;s other living exes, nor any of her friends or relatives. Co-stars such as Richard Dreyfuss, Cicely Tyson, Louie Anderson, Sally Kellerman, Stacy Keach, and Ted Neeley—all active on social media—were equally silent. On the 91st Academy Awards telecast, broadcast nearly four months after Locke died, she was omitted from the &quot;In Memoriam&quot; segment. In absence of any explanation, some surmised that Locke must have requested the blackout in her final wishes, perhaps to keep her real age under wraps.

==Legacy==


Locke is remembered as an early pioneer for women in Hollywood. She was one of 11 female filmmakers in 1990, the year WB released her sophomore feature, &quot;Impulse&quot;. By the time of &quot;Trading Favors&quot; (1997), her fourth effort, still only eight percent of all films were made by women, per the Directors Guild of America.

Locke&#x27;s influence as a feminist icon was duly acknowledged by the mainstream press. In 1989, Claudia Puig of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described her lawsuit against Clint Eastwood as a &quot;precedent-setting legal case, as it raises the question of whether a woman, who is legally married to one man, can claim palimony rights from another.&quot; Childfree by choice—unusual for a person of her generation—Locke was among the first celebrities to publicly discuss her abortion experiences. The avowal made Locke &quot;a talking-point in America&#x27;s sexual politics debate,&quot; according to &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Peter Bradshaw. Locke&#x27;s subsequent relationship with a doctor young enough to be her son added to her notoriety.

Cinematographer David Worth credits Locke with his big break. She is admired by such actresses as Frances Fisher and Rosanna Arquette, who applauded the strength of her directorial accomplishments, however short-lived.

During the last quarter of her life, Locke maintained she was blacklisted from the film industry as a result of her acrimonious split from Eastwood; his career went forward unscathed. Peggy Garrity, Locke&#x27;s former counsel, recalled the courtroom drama in her book &quot;In the Game: The Highs and Lows of a Trailblazing Trial Lawyer&quot; (2016). Garrity revealed that Locke&#x27;s 1999 confidential settlement from WB &quot;was for many millions more than the settlement with Clint had been.&quot; &quot;Locke v. Warner Bros. Inc&quot; also catalyzed changes within the legal system. In a landmark decision, California&#x27;s Supreme Court ruled that access to civil trials could no longer be closed off to the public.

Numerous outlets faced pushback over their chosen headlines for Locke&#x27;s obituary. Several major publications prefaced news of her death by tagging Eastwood&#x27;s name atop the article, which drew criticism by some who deemed it a sexist epitaph, with fans online pointing out that Locke was an Oscar nominee prior to meeting Eastwood. Women&#x27;s blog &quot;Jezebel&quot; criticized &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; for ostensibly regarding Locke as a nonentity; &quot;THR&quot; subsequently changed its headline. News organization &quot;TheWrap&quot;—whose editor, Sharon Waxman, reviewed Locke&#x27;s memoir for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1997—opined that her story &quot;should stir resonance in this age of the #MeToo movement.&quot; In a tribute to the late actress, author Sarah Weinman wrote: &quot;Sondra Locke, like Barbara Loden, deserves to be known for her work, not for the famous man she was disastrously involved with.&quot;

Among those voicing an unfavorable opinion of Locke was film critic Rex Reed, who had interviewed her for a 1967 &quot;New York Times&quot; profile. &quot;[She] lied so much during her brief but colorful career that when she lost her battle with cancer at age 74, I wondered if it was a publicity stunt,&quot; Reed wrote in an essay for &quot;Observer&quot;.

Candid photographs of Locke and Eastwood in their heyday are on display at the Frazetta Art Museum in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, next to Frank Frazetta&#x27;s exaggerated portrait of the couple that was used on the poster for &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; (1977).

The end credits of &quot;Bad Therapy&quot; (2020) pay homage to her.

===&quot;Our Very Own&quot;===
In 1971, fifth graders at Eastside Elementary in Locke&#x27;s hometown of Shelbyville, Tennessee, were left star-struck when Locke made a visit and held pretend &quot;auditions&quot; in the class to show them what it was like in Hollywood. One student, Cameron Watson, was inspired by Locke and is now an actor/director. Watson&#x27;s period drama &quot;Our Very Own&quot; (2005) takes place in Shelbyville in 1978 and concerns a group of teenagers who want to meet Locke when she returns to town for the local premiere of &quot;Every Which Way but Loose&quot;. Watson decided to do the movie after performing a standup routine about Locke and about how people in Shelbyville were obsessed with her. Locke attended one of those performances in 2004 at the Tiffany Theater in West Hollywood. &quot;The minute she heard the first reference to her or to her family, she threw up her arms: &#x27;What the hell is this? Watson said. &quot;By the end of the reading, she was doubled over.&quot; Locke gave the script her blessing and accepted an invitation to be special guest at the film&#x27;s premiere. The movie was a &quot;special gift&quot; to Locke, according to Deborah Obenchain, another Eastside student who said she did not think Locke really understood her impact on the small town she once called home. &quot;I think it meant just as much to her. … In our own way … we got to live out a little bit of our dreams by making the movie and meeting her.&quot;

<text>Brandon Cruz (born Brandon Edwin Williams on May 28, 1962) is an American musician, actor, editor and consultant. He is best known as a child actor for his role as Eddie Corbett, son of widower Tom Corbett (played by Bill Bixby), on the television series &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;. Cruz is also a punk rock musician, having sung for bands such as Dr. Know and the reunited version of the Dead Kennedys.

==Early life==
Cruz was born in Bakersfield, California, U.S., to Mexican-American parents. When he was two months old, the family moved to Silver Strand Beach in Oxnard, California.

==Career==
===Acting===
At age seven, he auditioned for and won his breakthrough role as Eddie Corbett in the television series &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;, which aired from 1969 to 1972. Co-star Bill Bixby and Cruz spent considerable time together, especially when the show was on hiatus, prompting Cruz to tell &quot;American Profile&quot; magazine &quot;Bill Bixby was like my second father.&quot; Cruz is the last living cast member of the series following co-star Kristina Holland’s death in 2023.

Cruz continued as a child actor for several years following the cancellation of &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot; with a number of guest appearances in television shows like &quot;Kung Fu&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, and &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot;—which reunited him on-screen with Bixby. Cruz also played the role of Joey Turner in the 1976 movie &quot;The Bad News Bears&quot;.

===Music===
Cruz turned his attention to punk rock in the late 1970s, and in 1981 was performing with the hardcore punk band Dr. Know. The group released several records, and after a name change to KNOW, toured Europe in 2017. Cruz also was the lead vocalist with Dead Kennedys from 2001 until 2003. Cruz was interviewed in the documentary &quot;American Hardcore: The History of American Punk Rock, 1980–1986&quot;. Reflecting on life after being a child star, which has brought tragedy to so many others, Cruz told &quot;American Profile&quot; &quot;Surfing and punk rock probably saved my life.&quot; Dr. Know still plays shows. They are writing a new album and will tour the world in 2024.

===Editing===
Cruz has worked behind-the-scenes in television and film, such as an assistant editor on the animated series &quot;South Park&quot;. He later worked for the United Paramount Network, the Discovery Channel and &quot;American Chopper&quot;.

==Honors and awards==
In 1991, Cruz was honored by the Young Artist Foundation with its Young Artist Former Child Star Lifetime Achievement Award for his role as Eddie on &quot;The Courtship of Eddie&#x27;s Father&quot;.

==Personal life==
Cruz and nurse Elizabeth &quot;Liz&quot; Finkelstein were married in 1994. They divorced in 2018. They have a son, Lincoln Bixby Cruz (born 1995), and a daughter, actress Ruby Jean Cruz (born 2000). Cruz now works as a consultant to people suffering from addictions and is a practicing Buddhist. A book on his life is in the early stages.

<text>Erik Jan Hanussen, born Hermann Steinschneider (2 June 1889 – 25 March 1933), was an Austrian Jewish publicist, charlatan and clairvoyant performer. Acclaimed in his lifetime as a hypnotist, mentalist, occultist and astrologer, Hanussen was active in Weimar Republic Germany and also at the beginning of Nazi Germany. He is said to have instructed Adolf Hitler in performance and the achievement of dramatic effect, and for treating Hitler during his depression.

==Early years==
Although Hanussen claimed to be a Danish aristocrat, he was in fact a Moravian Jew, born as Hermann (Herschel Chaim) Steinschneider.

Hanussen&#x27;s parents travelled constantly through Austria and Italy with acting and musical troupes, taking Hanussen with them.

==Career==

At the age of 20, Hanussen became a chief reporter for the newspaper &quot;Der Blitz&quot; He was later drafted into the army during World War I. During this time, he used mentalism to entertain the other troops. In 1917, he adopted the name Erik Jan Hanussen, or sometimes Erik van Hanussen, and joined a circus. He soon wrote two booklets dealing with subjects including telepathy, clairvoyance, and mind-reading, which he labelled as fraudulent practices. However, he later treated these practices as genuine and claimed to have supernatural abilities.

Hanussen performed a mind reading and hypnosis act at (former ) that catapulted him to stardom. At his height, he enjoyed the company of Germany&#x27;s military and business elite, also becoming close with members of the SA (&quot;Brownshirts&quot;). It is claimed he was a supporter of the Nazis despite his Jewish ancestry, which was an open secret. Hanussen converted from Judaism to Protestantism in order to join the Nazi Party. He also published anti-Semitic propaganda.

Stories abound of meetings between Hanussen and Hitler, including an encounter shortly before the election of November 1932, during which Hanussen taught Hitler his crowd control techniques of using gestures and dramatic pauses. Hanussen was also quite close to other important Nazi officials, to whom he had often lent money, including Wolf-Heinrich Graf von Helldorff, Karl Ernst and Friedrich Wilhelm Ohst.

Dr. Walter C. Langer, a psychoanalyst, prepared a psychological profile of Hitler for the United States&#x27; Office of Strategic Services (OSS) in 1943. The profile included a reference to Hanussen: &quot;...during the early 1920s Hitler took regular lessons in speaking and in mass psychology from a man named [Hanussen] who was also a practising astrologer and fortune-teller. He was an extremely clever individual who taught Hitler a great deal concerning the importance of staging meetings to obtain the greatest dramatic effect.&quot;

In 1931 Hanussen purchased a Breslau printing firm and began publishing an occult journal, &quot;Hanussen Magazin&quot; and &quot;Bunte Wochenschau&quot;, a popular bi-weekly Berlin tabloid which included astrological columns. He used the proceeds from his publishing ventures and stage shows to purchase a mansion which became known as &quot;The Palace of the Occult&quot;, which he renovated and turned into a luxurious interactive theatre for fortune telling games. Guests would sit around a large circular table and place their palms on glass with symbols lit from beneath; the room lights would be lowered in a séance-like fashion; and various gimmicks would highlight Hanussen&#x27;s dramatic verbal presentation of prophecies to the guests. He predicted events in the lives of the individuals present, but controversy arose when he predicted the future of Germany. He became successful, was always in demand in various venues, and had a full-time valet.

Alfred Neubauer, a famous motor racing team manager, refers to Hanussen in his autobiography, &quot;Speed Was My Life&quot; (first published in English in 1960). In the chapter &#x27;A Prophecy Comes True&#x27;, he describes a prediction made by Hanussen before the race at AVUS in Germany in May 1932. While at the Roxy Bar with other drivers, Neubauer challenged Hanussen to predict the winner of the following day&#x27;s race. After some &#x27;leg pulling&#x27;, Hanussen wrote two names on a piece of paper, which he folded, and put in an envelope. This was placed in the custody of the barman. He had strict instructions that it be left unopened until after the race. Hanussen announced, &#x27;One of us at this table will win tomorrow, another will die. The two names are in this envelope.&#x27; During the race, driver Georg Christian of Lobkowicz was killed, and Manfred von Brauchitsch won. After the race, Neubauer states he opened the envelope and found those names inside. Several days later, a Berlin newspaper reported that Hanussen had urged the German Automobile Club to persuade Prince Lobkowicz not to take part in the race, but Club officials had taken no action.

===Reichstag fire and assassination===
Predicting the Reichstag fire, a decisive event that allowed recently appointed Chancellor of Germany Adolf Hitler to seize absolute power in 1933, was Hanussen&#x27;s most famous feat of clairvoyance. It also was possibly a miscalculated use of inside information that led to his death shortly thereafter.

Hanussen was assassinated on 25 March 1933, probably by a group of SA men, and was hastily buried in a field on the outskirts of Berlin, near Stahnsdorf. He was a potential competition to Hermann Göring and Joseph Goebbels for the attention of their Führer, which may also have led to his murder. Hanussen&#x27;s body was discovered over a month later. There are unsubstantiated claims that he may have been involved in the Reichstag fire, hypnotizing and directing Marinus van der Lubbe, the convicted arsonist, to commit the act.

Erik Jan Hanussen is buried in the Südwestkirchhof, Stahnsdorf, near Berlin.

==Personal life==

Hanussen&#x27;s daughter, Erika Fuchs Steinschneider, was born to his first wife Theresia Luksch in 1920.

<text>The National Capital Region (NCR) (, ), also known as Canada&#x27;s Capital Region and Ottawa–Gatineau, is an official federal designation encompassing the Canadian capital of Ottawa, Ontario, the adjacent city of Gatineau, Quebec, and surrounding suburban and exurban areas. Despite its designation, the NCR is not a separate political or administrative entity and falls within the provinces of Ontario and Quebec.

Defined by the &quot;National Capital Act&quot; (1985), the NCR covers an area of , straddling the Ottawa River, which serves as the boundary between Ontario and Quebec. This area is smaller than the Ottawa–Gatineau census metropolitan area (CMA), which spans . Ottawa–Gatineau is the only CMA in Canada that crosses provincial boundaries.

The Algonquins are indigenous to Ottawa-Gatineau. The first European settlement in the region was led by Philemon Wright, a New Englander from Woburn, Massachusetts who, on March 7, 1800, arrived with his own and five other families along with twenty-five labourers to start an agricultural community on the north bank of the Ottawa River (Hull, Quebec) at the portage to the Chaudière Falls.

The National Capital Region was first specified by the &quot;National Capital Act&quot; (1985).

== Geography ==


Ottawa is located in the sub-region of Southern Ontario called Eastern Ontario. Gatineau is located in southwestern Quebec. Although overall Ontario is west of Quebec, the boundary in this region is situated in such a way that Gatineau is north of Ottawa, and northwest of the city centre.

The National Capital Region is situated close to where the Canadian shield and the Saint Lawrence Lowlands intersect. The area has several major fault lines and small earthquakes do occur somewhat regularly, including the 2010 Central Canada earthquake that occurred in Quebec. The Gatineau Hills are the foothills of the Laurentian Mountains and located in the region.

=== Climate ===
The National Capital Region experiences a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Dfb&quot;), with four distinct seasons and is between Zones 5a and 5b on the Canadian Plant Hardiness Scale. In Ottawa, the average July maximum temperature is 26.6 °C (80 °F). The average January minimum temperature is −14.4 °C (6.1 °F). In Gatineau, the average July maximum is 26 °C (78.8 °F) while the average January minimum temperature is −15 °C (5 °F).

== Demographics ==
Most of the National Capital Region is recognized as a bilingual region for federal language-of-work purposes.

In addition, the City of Ottawa has a bilingualism policy, but is not declared &quot;officially bilingual&quot; (which would require amendments to the provincial law). About 19% of the population of the City of Ottawa has French as their first language, while 40% of the total population of the city declares itself fluent in both languages.

As for Gatineau, it is the most bilingual city in Canada, above Montreal. About 64% of the population is able to speak both English and French.

The National Capital Region includes the majority English-speaking (Ottawa) and majority French-speaking (Gatineau) cores. The metro region has a bilingual population of 496,025, an English-only population of 507,175, and a French-only population of 102,375.

In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, the Ottawa - Gatineau CMA recorded a population of 1,488,307 living in 604,721 private dwellings, a change of from its revised 2016 population of 1,371,576. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.



==Economy==

===Silicon Valley North===
During the decade of 1990–2000, Ottawa was home to several very successful tech companies, including Nortel Networks, JDS Uniphase, and Newbridge Networks. High-tech employment doubled in five years to reach 80,000 by 2001. With Nortel failing to meet high earnings expectations and layoffs starting in 2002 in the wake of the dot-com bubble, the company started to decline, a devastating shock to the tech industry in Ottawa. Others described it as an &#x27;anchor&#x27; for the industry in Ottawa, and an &#x27;incubator&#x27; and that without it the Ottawa high-tech industry could not sustain itself.

By the mid-2000s, other Canadian regions were competing for the title of Silicon Valley North. The term was being adopted to refer to the area between Toronto and Kitchener-Waterloo, which is home to Research in Motion (BlackBerry), and offices for Google, Adobe Inc., and Microsoft. With companies such as Shopify, Halogen Software, and Kinaxis Inc, all headquartered in Ottawa, as well as over 1,700 other technology companies, Ottawa still has a significant high-tech presence today.

== National Capital Commission ==
The National Capital Commission (NCC) is a corporation established by the Canadian government in 1959 to manage federal buildings and land within the National Capital Region (NCR). While the NCR is not a separate political jurisdiction, the NCC has a mandate to develop the region into a source of pride and unity for Canadians by engaging in political, cultural, and land use planning matters that are typically powers reserved for the provincial government under the Constitution of Canada. In the Supreme Court of Canada case of &quot;Munro v. National Capital Commission&quot;, it was determined that the NCC has authority to be involved in zoning matters in the NCR.

In 2006, the NCC completed work on Confederation Boulevard, a ceremonial route connecting key attractions in the NCR on both sides of the Ottawa River. The NCC River House, originally constructed in 1914, underwent substantial restoration from 2019 to July 2023. It is located adjacent to the Ottawa River near the Sir George-Étienne Cartier Parkway.

The NCC reports to Parliament through the Minister of Heritage, and is governed by the &quot;National Capital Act&quot;. Its headquarters are in the Chambers Building on Elgin Street, between Queen and Sparks Streets.

== Attractions ==

The National Capital Region (NCR) has numerous attractions, including festivals, national museums, iconic buildings, sports, and entertainment. Ottawa is known for its examples of Gothic Revival architecture.

=== Festivals ===
Annual events include the music festival Bluesfest, winter festival Winterlude, the Canadian Tulip Festival, Capital Pride, RCMP Musical Ride, Gatineau Hot Air Balloon Festival, Buskers festival, and the largest Canada Day celebrations in the nation.

=== Built heritage ===
The region hosts several national museums, such as the Canadian Museum of History, Canadian War Museum, Canadian Museum of Nature, Canada Science and Technology Museum, National Art Gallery, and Canada Aviation Museum.

Prominent buildings include Parliament Hill, the Prime Minister&#x27;s home 24 Sussex Drive, the Governor General&#x27;s home Rideau Hall, the Canadian Museum of History, the National Gallery of Canada, the Supreme Court of Canada, the Royal Canadian Mint, the American Embassy, and the National Library.

There are 29 National Historic Sites of Canada within the National Capital Region, including landmarks like the &quot;Former Almonte Post Office&quot; and &quot;Rosamond Woollen Mill&quot; in Almonte, the &quot;Gillies Grove and House&quot; in Arnprior, the Manoir Papineau in Montebello and the &quot;Symmes Hotel&quot; in the Aylmer sector of Gatineau.

=== Sports and entertainment ===
The NCR is home to various sports teams, including the Ottawa Senators (NHL), Ottawa Redblacks (CFL), and Atlético Ottawa (CPL). The Ottawa 67&#x27;s (OHL) and Quebec Maritimes Junior Hockey League (QMJHL).

Universities like Carleton University and the University of Ottawa compete in U Sports, with teams like the Carleton Ravens and Ottawa Gee-Gees achieving national recognition. Gatineau&#x27;s Université du Québec en Outaouais offers a range of sports activities at its large sports center where you can practice a multitude of sports like Yoga, Zumba and more. Algonquin College has also won numerous national championships.

== Transportation ==
The National Capital Region (NCR) has several major freeways including the 417, Ontario Highway 416, Quebec Autoroute 5, Quebec Autoroute 50, Regional Road 174, and Highway 7 in Ontario.

The 417 is Ottawa&#x27;s east–west commuter expressway. It begins at the Ontario-Quebec border (continuing the route of Quebec Autoroute 40), reaches the urban portion of Ottawa at the 417-174 split, bisects the urban area, and continues westward to just beyond the city boundary where it gives way to Highway 17 in Renfrew County.

The 416 starts at the 401 near the Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge and continues north for 75 km until it ends at the 417 in Ottawa&#x27;s west end.

The freeway section of Highway 7 branches off the 417 in Ottawa&#x27;s west end near Stittsville and is currently undergoing a 4-lane expansion to reach the eastern fringe of Carleton Place at McNeely Avenue.

Public transportation is handled by OC Transpo on the Ontario side, and the STO on the Quebec side. Together they serve a population over 1,130,761 and have an estimated annual ridership of over 113.2 million.

OC Transpo operates a light rail transit (LRT) system named the O-Train with two lines in operation. The O-Train Trillium Line is a north–south line using diesel-powered units and has just over 2 million riders per year. The Confederation Line links the western suburbs and the eastern suburbs via downtown, and uses electrically powered light-rail vehicles. The Confederation Line is 12.5 km long with 13 stations, 3 of which are underground in downtown Ottawa. There is a proposed LRT system in Gatineau that would connect with the Confederation and Trillium Lines in Ottawa.

Gatineau&#x27;s bus transitway, the Rapibus, commenced operation in October 2013.

OC Transpo has about 1,050 buses which run on city streets and an expansive Transitway. The STO has around 300 buses that serve the Quebec side of the Ottawa River, some routes crossing into downtown Ottawa.

Ottawa Macdonald–Cartier International Airport serves as the primary international airport for the NCR. In 2023, it accommodated over 4 million passengers, ranking it as the sixth busiest airport in Canada and the second busiest in Ontario. The airport provides non-stop flights to various destinations in Canada, the United States, the Caribbean, and Europe. Additionally, it is a key component of some of the nation&#x27;s busiest air routes, offering hourly flights to and from Montreal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport and Toronto Pearson International Airport.

== Area codes ==
The National Capital Region uses 613, 343, and 753 on the Ontario side of the Ottawa River, while 819, 873, and 468 are used on the Quebec side.

Previously, Ottawa and Hull operated as a single local calling area, with exchange protection measures to maintain seven-digit dialing between the two cities. However, with the implementation of ten-digit local dialing since 2006, this practice has ceased. Despite this, a &quot;dual dialability&quot; system remains for federal government numbers, allowing for seamless communication across the provincial border.

== Newspapers ==
Three main daily local newspapers are printed in Ottawa: two English newspapers, the &quot;Ottawa Citizen&quot; and the &quot;Ottawa Sun&quot;, and one French newspaper, &quot;Le Droit&quot;.

== Capital district proposals ==
Proposals have been made to separate the National Capital Region and establish it as a distinct capital district, similar to the District of Columbia or the Australian Capital Territory. These gained attention during periods when the Parti Québécois held power in Quebec, particularly due to the federalist inclination of the Hull/Gatineau area. However, any potential federal support waned after the 1995 Quebec referendum, where the predominantly federalist vote in Hull/Gatineau significantly influenced the outcome. Recent efforts for a separate capital district haven&#x27;t gained momentum, with no active movement as of 2024.

<text>Cleavon Jake Little (June 1, 1939 – October 22, 1992) was an American stage, film and television actor. He began his career in the late 1960s on the stage. In 1970, he starred in the Broadway production of &quot;Purlie&quot;, for which he earned both a Tony Award and a Drama Desk Award. His first leading television role was that of the irreverent Dr. Jerry Noland on the ABC sitcom &quot;Temperatures Rising&quot; (1972–1974). While starring in the sitcom, Little appeared in what has become his signature performance, portraying Sheriff Bart in the 1974 Mel Brooks comedy film &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot;.

In the 1980s, Little continued to appear in stage productions, films, and in guest spots on television series. In 1989, he won a Primetime Emmy Award for his appearance on the NBC sitcom &quot;Dear John&quot;. He later starred on the Fox sitcom &quot;True Colors&quot; (1991–1992).

==Early life==
Little was the brother of singer DeEtta Little West, best known for her performance (with Nelson Pigford) of the vocals on the chart-topping Bill Conti song &quot;Gonna Fly Now,&quot; the main theme to &quot;Rocky&quot;. He had another sister, Rosemarie Little Martin, and two brothers, Everett and Roy.

Little was raised in San Diego, California, and attended Kearny High School, graduating in 1957. He graduated from San Diego State College in 1965 with a degree in speech therapy and appeared in &quot;A Raisin in the Sun&quot; in 1962 at the Old Globe Theatre in San Diego. He worked his way through college as a janitor and gave Black poetry presentations to clubs and groups. He won a scholarship from the American Broadcasting Company to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City and was named the best actor in the class of 1967.

==Career==

Little made his professional debut in February 1967, appearing off-Broadway at the Village Gate as the Muslim Witch in the original production of Barbara Garson&#x27;s &quot;MacBird&quot;. This was followed by the role of Foxtrot in the original production of Bruce Jay Friedman&#x27;s long-running play &quot;Scuba Duba&quot; which premiered in October 1967. While portraying Foxtrot at night, he portrayed Hamlet during the days at schools and parks on behalf of the New York Shakespeare Festival.

The following year, he made his first film appearance in a small uncredited role in &quot;What&#x27;s So Bad About Feeling Good?&quot; (1968), and his first television appearance as a guest star on two episodes of &quot;Felony Squad&quot;. A series of small roles followed in films such as &quot;John and Mary&quot; (1969) and &quot;Cotton Comes to Harlem&quot; (1970).

Little made his Broadway debut in 1969 as Lee Haines in John Sebastian and Murray Schisgal&#x27;s musical &quot;Jimmy Shine&quot; with Dustin Hoffman in the title role. In 1970, he returned to Broadway to portray the title role in Ossie Davis&#x27;s musical &quot;Purlie&quot;, for which he won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Musical and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actor in a Musical.

A year later, Little was hired as an ensemble player on the syndicated TV variety weekly &quot;The David Frost Revue&quot; and he portrayed Shogo in &quot;Narrow Road to the Deep North&quot; on Broadway. In 1971, Little was chosen to portray the blind radio personality Super Soul in the car-chase movie &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;. The same year, he played preacher Hawthorne Dooley in the pilot for &quot;The Waltons&quot; called &quot;The Homecoming: A Christmas Story,&quot; helping John-Boy Walton search for his father; then appeared as a different character in season four, in an episode called &quot;The Fighter,&quot; about a prizefighter who desires to build a church and be a preacher. He also played a burglar in a 1971 episode of &quot;All in the Family&quot; titled &quot;Edith Writes a Song.&quot;

He then starred on the ABC sitcom &quot;Temperatures Rising&quot;, which aired in three different iterations from 1972 to 1974, with Little&#x27;s character of Dr. Jerry Noland as the only common element. In 1974, he starred in the television disaster film &quot;The Day the Earth Moved&quot;, opposite Jackie Cooper and Stella Stevens. Little made a minor appearance in the &quot;Six Million Dollar Man&quot; episode, &quot;Population: Zero&quot;, as one of the NASA deliveryman handing Colonel Steve Austin his space suit.

In 1974 he was cast as Sheriff Bart in Brooks&#x27;s comedy western &quot;Blazing Saddles&quot; (1974), after the studio rejected Richard Pryor, who co-wrote the script. Studio executives were apparently concerned about Pryor&#x27;s reliability, given his reputation for drug use and unpredictable behavior, and thought Little would be a safer choice. This role earned him a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Most Promising Newcomer to Leading Film Roles.

In 1975, Little returned to Broadway to portray the role of Lewis in the original production of Murray Schisgal&#x27;s &quot;All Over Town&quot; under the direction of Dustin Hoffman. The following year, he appeared as Willy Stepp in the original production of Ronald Ribman&#x27;s &quot;The Poison Tree&quot; at the Ambassador Theatre.

Over the years he made guest appearances on &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;The Rookies&quot;, &quot;Police Story&quot;, &quot;The Rockford Files&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;ABC Afterschool Specials&quot;, &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;, &quot;MacGyver&quot;, and a special Christmas episode of &quot;ALF&quot;.

==Later career==
Little played a supporting role to Pryor in the racing movie &quot;Greased Lightning&quot; (1977), based on the true life story of Wendell Scott, the first black stock car racing winner in America. Other films included &quot;FM&quot; (1978), &quot;Scavenger Hunt&quot; (1979), &quot;The Salamander&quot; (1981), &quot;High Risk&quot; (1981), &quot;Jimmy the Kid&quot; (1982), &quot;Surf II&quot; (1984), &quot;Toy Soldiers&quot; (1984), &quot;Once Bitten&quot; (1985), The Gig (1985) and &quot;Fletch Lives (1989).&quot;

Little returned to the New York stage in 1981 in the off-Broadway production &quot;The Resurrection of Lady Lester&quot;, a &quot;poetic mood song&quot; by OyamO, playing the legendary jazz saxophonist Lester Young.

In December 1985, Little opened at Broadway&#x27;s Booth Theatre as Midge in Herb Gardner&#x27;s play &quot;I&#x27;m Not Rappaport&quot; with Judd Hirsch, who won the Tony Award for Best Actor in a Play. Little had originated the role of Midge in the Seattle Repertory Theatre production.

In 1989 he appeared as a closeted gay man in Hirsch&#x27;s sitcom &quot;Dear John&quot; in the episode &quot;Stand by Your Man,&quot; for which Little won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series, defeating Robert Picardo, Jack Gilford, Leslie Nielsen, and Sammy Davis Jr.

Little was slated to star on the television series &quot;Mr. Dugan&quot;, where he was to play a black congressman, but that series was poorly received by real black congressmen and was cancelled before making it to air. In 1991, he replaced Frankie Faison as Ronald Freeman, a black dentist married to a white housewife, on the Fox sitcom &quot;True Colors&quot;. The same year, he also had a supporting role on the television series &quot;Bagdad Cafe&quot;, appearing in 12 episodes. Later that year, he was cast as a civil-rights lawyer in the docudrama, &quot;Separate but Equal&quot;, starring Sidney Poitier, who portrayed the first black U.S. Supreme Court Justice, Thurgood Marshall, NAACP lead attorney in the 1954 Supreme Court case that desegregated public schools. He also appeared in the television series &quot;MacGyver&quot; as Frank Colton, one half of a bounty hunter brother duo.

Little&#x27;s last appearance as an actor was in a guest role on a 1992 episode of the television series &quot;Tales from the Crypt&quot; entitled &quot;This&#x27;ll Kill Ya&quot;. Eleven years after his death, he appeared in the music video for &quot;Show Me How to Live&quot; by Audioslave, through archive footage from &quot;Vanishing Point&quot;.

==Personal life ==
Little married Valerie Wiggins in 1972. They divorced in 1974. His daughter is Adia Millett.

Little died of colon cancer at his home in the Sherman Oaks area of Los Angeles on October 22, 1992.

==Legacy==
For Little&#x27;s contribution to motion pictures, he was posthumously honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 1, 1994. The star is located on the south side of Hollywood Boulevard near El Cerrito Place.

The Cleavon Little Scholarship, which provides assistance to minority students, was created at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts through a campaign led by Little&#x27;s fellow alumnus and co-star Judd Hirsch.

<doc id="921997" wikidata="Q272878" url="?curid=921997" title="Lisa Hartman Black">
<text>Lisa Hartman Black (born June 1, 1956) is an American actress and singer from Houston, Texas.

Hartman gained prominence after her role in the prime time drama &quot;Knots Landing&quot; from 1982 to 1986. She recorded four solo albums between 1976 and 1987, with her most notable song being &quot;If Love Must Go&quot;. She achieved significant success with a duet with her husband, country singer Clint Black, called &quot;When I Said I Do&quot;, which reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks charts in 1999. Hartman has appeared in various films and TV shows, including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Back to You and Me&quot;, and &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;. She married Black in 1991, and the couple has a daughter, Lily Pearl Black. They have lived in Nashville, Tennessee, since 2002.

==Career==
After some minor television appearances, Hartman starred on the short-lived &quot;Bewitched&quot; spin-off, &quot;Tabitha&quot; during 1977–78. She subsequently appeared frequently on television in guest roles, and appeared in the 1981 CBS TV remake of Jacqueline Susann&#x27;s &quot;Valley of the Dolls&quot;, as Neely O&#x27;Hara. She was on WLS-TV&#x27;s 1979 special &quot;You&#x27;re Never Too Old&quot; recorded at Marriott&#x27;s Great America in Gurnee, Illinois.

Hartman&#x27;s breakthrough as an actress came in 1982 when she began appearing on the prime time drama &quot;Knots Landing&quot;, playing rock singer Ciji Dunne. Her character engaged in romances with the characters played by Ted Shackelford and Michael Sabatino. Hartman was popular with audiences, and when Ciji was murdered off-screen in 1983, there was a public uproar. As a solution, Hartman was brought back on the show as Cathy Geary, also a singer, who later marries an unbalanced televangelist played by a young Alec Baldwin. Hartman remained with the show until 1986, when she was released due to budget cuts and because the show&#x27;s writers felt there were no further storylines for her character. During her time on the series, she appeared in the film &quot;Where the Boys Are &#x27;84&quot; produced by Allan Carr. She also sang the film&#x27;s theme song.

Hartman recorded four solo albums between 1976 and 1987 – two for Kirshner Records, one for RCA Records, and one for Atlantic Records. Her most notable song is &quot;If Love Must Go&quot;, which she performed on various television shows like &quot;Solid Gold&quot; and &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;. Despite additional contributions from successful songwriters and producers including Jeff Barry, Dobie Gray, Bryan Adams, Rick Springfield, Will Jennings, and Holly Knight, the albums were not commercially successful. She achieved her most notable success with a duet with her husband entitled &quot;When I Said I Do&quot;. It reached Number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks charts on December 18, 1999, and was nominated for a Grammy Award. The duet was ranked No. 11 on &quot;CMT&#x27;s 100 Greatest Duets in Country Music&quot; in 2005. They recorded a second duet titled &quot;Easy For Me to Say&quot;, which peaked at No. 27 on the country music charts in 2002.

In the summer of 1994, Hartman co-hosted &quot;Universal Studios Summer Blast&quot;, a TV special celebrating the 30th anniversary of Universal Studios.

In April 2011, her albums &quot;Lisa Hartman&quot;, &quot;Hold On&quot; and &quot;Letterock&quot; were released on CD with bonus tracks by Wounded Bird Records under license from Sony. Her last album, &quot;&#x27;Til My Heart Stops&quot; was reissued on CD in 2008 on Wounded Bird Records as well.

In May 2012, Hartman starred in &quot;&quot;, a movie from Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment. She plays the mother of a budding equestrian rider (Kacey Rohl).

In 2005, Hartman starred in a made-for-TV film, &quot;Back to You and Me&quot;, on the Hallmark Channel.

In 2020, she and husband Clint Black appeared in season four of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Snow Owls&quot;, notably competing as the series&#x27; first duet competitors while riding in an egg-shaped vehicle.

==Personal life==
Hartman grew up in Houston, Texas. In 1991, she married musician Clint Black. In 2001, the couple had a daughter, Lily Pearl Black. They have lived in Nashville, Tennessee since 2002 after living in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles, California.

<text>Jemma Gwynne Griffiths (born 18 May 1975), known by her stage name Jem, is a Welsh singer, songwriter, and record producer.

Born and raised in Penarth, Glamorgan, she began songwriting at an early age. After graduating from university in 1996, she worked as a DJ as well as co-founder of record label Marine Parade in Brighton. On 24 March 2004, she released her debut studio album &quot;Finally Woken&quot; through ATO Records. Featuring the singles &quot;They&quot;, &quot;Just a Ride&quot; and &quot;Wish I&quot;, the album saw the most success in the United Kingdom, where it was certified Platinum. Jem followed up her debut with her second album, &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, released on 18 September 2008. Her third album, &quot;Beachwood Canyon&quot;, was released in 2016.

==Early life and education==
Jemma Griffiths was born in Penarth, Wales, a small town near Cardiff on 18 May 1975. Jem originally found her passion for singing and songwriting whilst attending Stanwell School. During her early school years she explored her musical interests with the family piano, penning her first song at the age of thirteen. Jem has three siblings, older sister Chloe, eldest sister Georgia, who provided vocals for the Welsh indie/punk band Weapons of Mass Belief alongside brother Justin, who also goes by the name Yestyn, of Glass Pear.

In 1993, Jem moved to Brighton to study Law at the University of Sussex. Both during her studies and after graduating in 1996, Jem spent time as a club and festival promoter and also began working as a DJ in Brighton&#x27;s club scene under the name Jem, inspired by the animated series &quot;Jem and the Holograms&quot;.

==Career==
===1999–2006: &quot;It All Starts Here...&quot; and &quot;Finally Woken&quot;===
In early 1998, alongside Adam Freeland, she co-founded and helped run the specialist breakbeat/hip hop record label Marine Parade. However, after spending two years acting as agent and promoter for other aspiring musicians, she soon felt that she had neglected her own musical career. In November 1999, she left Brighton and returned to Wales, where she assembled a mobile recording studio and focused on developing her own individual songwriting and music production skills, completing a collection of four demos that acted as the basis of her break into the music industry.

In 2000, Jem moved to London where she met Sugababes manager Sarah Stennett, with whom she began a professional relationship. Stennett introduced her to other writers and producers. She had a writing session with electronic producer Guy Sigsworth, during which the song &quot;Nothing Fails&quot; was created; the song was eventually picked up by Madonna for her 2003 studio album, &quot;American Life&quot;. In 2001, Jem travelled to Brooklyn, New York City, teaming up with hip hop producer Ge-Ology and co-producer Yoad Nevo. In March 2002, Jem stopped by independent radio station KCRW to leave a demo of her song &quot;Finally Woken&quot; in Nic Harcourt&#x27;s mailbox. Harcourt began playing it on his show &quot;Morning Becomes Eclectic&quot;. This attracted the attention of Bruce Flohr, an A&amp;R rep for RCA Records and newly established ATO Records, who offered her a recording contract. She was subsequently signed to the label and Jem relocated to Los Angeles. 

On 13 October 2003, in preparation for the release of her full-length album, Jem released the EP &quot;It All Starts Here...&quot;, consisting of five tracks. Her full-length studio album &quot;Finally Woken&quot; was released in the United States on 24 March 2004. In the United Kingdom, &quot;They&quot; was released as her lead single on 13 March 2005. This was followed by &quot;Just a Ride&quot; in June and &quot;Wish I&quot; in September, which was used as the theme tune to UK reality television programme &quot;Celebrity Love Island&quot;. &quot;Finally Awoken&quot; spent 32 weeks on the UK Album Chart and peaked at number 6. Jem licensed every song on her album to be broadcast on American television programs, films and advertisements as a method of promotion. Television program &quot;The O.C.&quot; was the first to use Jem&#x27;s music in several of their episodes, eventually inviting her to guest-star on the show. She performed a cover version of Paul McCartney&#x27;s 1970 song &quot;Maybe I&#x27;m Amazed&quot; in the first season finale. Since then, every song from the album has appeared in various television programs, such as &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;, &quot;Without a Trace&quot; and &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;.

===2007–2009: &quot;Down to Earth&quot;===
In 2006, Jem decided to cease touring and to spend a year focusing on writing new material and developing her second studio album. She parted from Yoad Nevo and met with four different producers across the United States. Over the next few years she worked with Jeff Bass in Detroit as well as meeting with Lester Mendez in Los Angeles. Producers Mike Bradford and Greg Kurstin also collaborated with Jem. During the production of her album, Jem wrote and lent her vocals to the song &quot;Once in Every Lifetime&quot; which appeared on the &quot;Eragon&quot; movie soundtrack.

Jem&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Down to Earth&quot; was released in the United States, Canada, and Japan on 18 September 2008 with the European releases varying by each country between January and March 2009. The album peaked at 48 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and 64 on the UK Albums Chart The lead single of the album &quot;It&#x27;s Amazing&quot; originally appeared on the &quot;soundtrack&quot; for the 2008 movie &quot;Sex and the City&quot;. Released 3 June 2008, the song failed to chart in the United States or the United Kingdom. Her following single releases off the album included: &quot;Crazy&quot; in August 2008, &quot;And So I Pray&quot; in May 2009, and &quot;I Want You To...&quot; in October 2009, however, they did not grant as much commercial success as her debut album. On 4 December 2009, Jem released the single &quot;Until the Morning Comes&quot;, which was a collaboration with her brother, Glass Pear.

===2010–2016: Other projects and &quot;Beachwood Canyon&quot;===
In 2011, Jem contributed to the record &quot;Ten Years On: A Collection of Songs in Remembrance of September 11th 2001&quot;. In 2012, Jem returned to producing her third album. In November, she recorded tracks at the Grand Master Studios, in Hollywood, and originally anticipated a release in early 2013. Outside of music, she also announced that she had spent several years writing a screenplay.

After numerous delays, in January 2016, Jem published the first photoshoots for the &quot;Beachwood Canyon&quot; album on her Facebook page and announced the official release of the album for spring 2016. The first single &quot;Beachwood Canyon&quot; was released on 1 July. On 5 August 2016, the album was released digitally worldwide.

==Musical style==
Jem&#x27;s musical style is varied and encompasses genres such as trip hop, electronica, pop rock and new wave, with critics often associating her with other female musicians Dido and Beth Orton.

==Personal life==
In September 2009, Jem married American musician and songwriter Joseph George in Montecito, California. They had originally met in 2005, on the set of filming the music video for &quot;Wish I&quot;, where George acted the role of Jem&#x27;s love interest. They both currently reside in Los Angeles.

<text>Chantal Petitclerc (born 15 December 1969) is a Canadian wheelchair racer and a Senator from Quebec.

==Early life==
At the age of 13, Petitclerc lost the use of both legs in an accident when at a friend&#x27;s farm, a heavy barn door fell on her, fracturing her spine at the L1-T12 vertebra. Gaston Jacques, a high school physical education teacher, was to have a decisive influence on her life when he taught her to swim for four lunch hours a week throughout high school as she was unable to participate in the gym course. In a 2011 interview, she stated that, &quot;[swimming] really helped me get more fit and stronger, and helped me live a more independent life in a wheelchair.&quot; Swimming also allowed her to discover her competitive drive. While she had previously been first in her class academically, it was her introduction to the world of competitive racing.

==Sport==
When she was eighteen, Pierre Pomerleau, a trainer at Université Laval in Quebec City, introduced her to wheelchair sports. Using a homemade wheelchair, she took part in her first race and came last, well behind the other competitors. However, she had fallen in love with wheelchair racing and a long and fruitful career had begun.

While Petitclerc was developing her skills as a wheelchair athlete, she pursued her studies, first in social sciences at the CEGEP de Sainte-Foy and then in history at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, where she registered in order to be able to train with Peter Eriksson, who remains her coach to this day.

Petitclerc competed in the Paralympic Games for the first time in Barcelona in 1992, returning with two bronze medals, the start of collection that now includes twenty one Paralympic medals, fourteen of them gold. Four years later, at the Atlanta games, she took gold medals in the 100 and 200 m events and three silvers in the 400, 800, and 1500 m races. At the 2000 Summer Paralympics, she won two golds, in the 200 m and 800 m, and two silvers, in the 100 m and 400 m races. She won three gold medals (in 100 m, 200 m, and 400 m) and a bronze (800 m) at the 2002 World Championships and a gold at the 2002 Commonwealth Games in the 800 m. At the 2004 Summer Olympics (where wheelchair racing was an exhibition sport) she won the 800 m, and went on to an impressive showing with 5 gold medals at the 2004 Summer Paralympics. When she returned from Athens in 2004, Petitclerc told reporters the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing would be her last big international meeting but that she will continue training and road racing for a while. For her performance in 2008, she was awarded the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canadian athlete of the year and the Canadian Press&#x27;s Bobbie Rosenfeld Award as Canada&#x27;s female athlete of the year. Petitclerc was also awarded the Best Female award at the Paralympic Sport Awards.

With her 5 golds in the 2004 Paralympics, she tied the existing Canadian gold medal record at a single Games, Winter or Summer, set by Stephanie Dixon at the 2000 Summer Paralympics. Her 5 golds in the 2008 Paralympics tied that record. As of 2010, the record still stood. As of 2012 she holds five world records for wheelchair racing. she is still the most gold-medalled female paralympic athlete with 14 golds and 21 medals.

She was chosen as the flagbearer of the Canadian team at the opening ceremonies of the 2006 Commonwealth Games.

Petitclerc lives in Montreal, and trains at Complexe sportif Claude-Robillard.

Rio Tinto Alcan is her main sponsor since 1998.

Petitclerc was appointed as a coach and mentor to the British athletics team ahead of the 2012 Summer Paralympics, working alongside her former coach and UK Athletics&#x27; Paralympic head coach Peter Eriksson.

Petitclerc was named the Chef de Mission for Canada&#x27;s 2014 Commonwealth Games team. She was also named Chef de Mission for the 2016 Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.

==Personal life==
Petitclerc is married to electro-acoustic music composer James Duhamel and gave birth to son Elliot in December 2013.

==Senate==
On 18 March 2016, Petitclerc was named to the Senate of Canada on the advice of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. She sits as a member of the Independent Senators Group. Her main priorities in the Senate are health as well as the rights of persons with disabilities. In June 2016, Senator Petitclerc delivered her first speech in the Chamber on Bill C-14, An Act to amend the Criminal Code and to make related amendments to other Acts (medical assistance in dying). Her speech moved many of her colleagues, when she quoted: &quot;When you have a disability, the worst part is feeling as if you have no control over your own life, over your own body. It happens to all people with disabilities, I can assure you.&quot; She also sponsored Bill S-5, An Act to amend the Tobacco Act and the Non Smokers&#x27; Health Act and to make consequential amendments to other acts.

==Honours and awards==
The St-Marc-des-Carrières municipal ice hockey arena now bears her name.

In 2002, Petitclerc was awarded with the Meritorious Service Medal (civil division).

In 2005, Petitclerc was invested as a Knight of the Order of Quebec. That year, Petitclerc became part of the Canadian Disability Hall of Fame.

On 16 June 2009, it was announced that Petitclerc would receive a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in Toronto. The induction ceremony was held on 12 September 2009.

In 2009, she was invested as a Companion of the Order of Canada &quot;for her achievements as a Paralympic champion known internationally as an inspiration, and for her commitment to developing sports for athletes with a disability&quot;.

In 2010, she was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in Calgary, Alberta.

In 2012, she was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree by the University of Alberta.

Petitclerc has also received both the Queen&#x27;s Golden Jubilee Medal and the Queen&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee Medal.

In 2015, Petitclerc was inducted into the Canadian Paralympic Hall of Fame of the Canadian Paralympic Committee.

<text>Spytihněv II (also &quot;Spitignew&quot;, &quot;Spitihnew&quot; or &quot;Spytihnev&quot;; ; 1031 – 28 January 1061), a member of the Přemyslid dynasty, was Duke of Bohemia from 1055 until his death in 1061.

==Life==
He was the eldest son of Duke Bretislav I (d. 1055) and his consort Judith of Schweinfurt. While his father entered into conflict with the Salian king Henry III, young Spytihněv from 1039 onwards spent several years as a hostage at the German court.

When he succeeded his father as duke, his coronation was celebrated with the first known rendition of &quot;Hospodine pomiluj ny&quot;, the earliest known song in Czech. After his accession to the throne, he went at once to Regensburg to receive imperial confirmation. According to the contemporary chronicler Cosmas of Prague, this loyalty to the Holy Roman Empire did not prevent him from expelling all Germans from his lands, including his mother Judith, and the new anti-German policy continued to his death.

In 1056, Spytihněv had all the monks driven out of Sazava Abbey, yet despite this, Pope Nicholas II sought the alliance of the Bohemian duke in 1059. Thus, Rome granted Spytihněv the right to wear the mitre and tunic of a bishop for the annual sum of 100 marks.

His brothers having inherited Moravia, Spytihněv tried to reduce their authority by arresting 300 Moravian magnates and stripping his brothers of their rights in the province. Thus, Vratislaus of Olomouc fled to Hungary in 1058.

Spytihněv was succeeded by Vratislaus, who in turn entrusted Moravia to his brother Conrad.

==Marriage==
About 1054 Spytihněv was married to Ida of Wettin (&quot;Hidda&quot;), a daughter of Margrave Theodoric II of Lusatia. They had:

*Svatobor (&quot;Friedrich&quot;), Patriarch of Aquileia in 1084. Shortly afterwards, on 23 Feb 1086, he was murdered.

<text>The Pilatus SB-2 Pelican was a civil utility aircraft developed by a purposely founded development bureau at the ETH Zurich on behalf of the Federal Air Authority. In November 1940 it was decided to go on with the project and build the aircraft, in February 1941 the Authority approved the development bureau to have it built at the newly formed Pilatus Aircraft company.

==Design and development==
In 1938 the Federal Air Authority was looking for an aircraft able to land at minial airfields in mountain valleys. In fact the aircraft was desired to define the criteria such possible future airfields would have to meet. So this was not to be the aircraft for such air transport itself but a means to find possible airfield locations.

The previous project of a four-seater STOL experimental aircraft under the designation Studienbüro für Spezialflugzeuge SB-1 was not implemented, so it was followed by the SB-2, which at some moments was also discussed for commercial use.
Work on the SB-2 Pelican, a special “slow-flying” aircraft, commenced in the winter of 1941. Good short takeoff and landing credentials, plus steep climbing capabilities, were essential attributes of the aircraft flown in the narrow Alpine valleys at that time. The aircraft was designed to carry five people, the double controls could be reduced to one if flown with only one pilot.

The configuration of the SB-2 was slightly unusual, in that it was provided with tricycle undercarriage (an uncommon feature at the time), and a wing that had a slight forward sweep.

As it turned out, the type was never actually tested in its originally intended role. Only twice the aircraft was used later by the company it was sold to, Alpar, to land in a narrow mountain valley.

The SB-2 also served as the basis for the design work on a larger STOL aircraft with an increased passenger capacity, the Studienbüro für Spezialflugzeuge SB-5, whose development was stopped prior to any construction work.

==Operational history==
The SB-2 made its maiden flight on 30 May 1944. After extensive trials, the only model built went to Alpar AG in Bern. The Pelikan was well suited for passenger operations, but could have also been used for aerial photography, which it never was. The bottom loading opening was useful for some freight transport and agricultural work.

During an air display on 13 June 1948, the Pelican flipped over because the nosewheel sheared off from an unnoticed transverse slip. It was stored damaged during which time still improvements were discussed by the chief engineer Belart of the Studienbüro, while Alpar was hoping to raise the takeoff weight and asked Pilatus to submit a bid for a conversion to seven seats at the end of January 1949. Calculations were made and drawings produced with other wheels. When Pilatus refused to offer a price and insisted on effort calculation, estimated at 160&#x27;000 Swiss Francs, Alpar had to give up plans to rebuild the aircraft. On March 23, 1949, the aircraft was removed from the Swiss registry.

<text> (; ) is an Italian card game, and one of the three major national card games in Italy, the others being and . It is also popular in Argentina and Brazil, brought in by Italian immigrants, mostly in the variation. is also played in former Italian colonies such as Libya and Somalia or some other countries like Tunisia and even Morocco, with changed appearance in the cards. It is played with a standard Italian 40-card deck, mostly between two players or four in two partnerships, but it can also be played by three or six players.

The name is an Italian noun meaning &#x27;broom&#x27;, since taking a means &#x27;to sweep&#x27; all the cards from the table. Watching a game of can be a highly entertaining activity, since games traditionally involve lively, colorful, and somewhat strong-worded banter in between hands. However, skill and chance are more important for the outcome of the game.

==History==
 was already widespread throughout Italy in the 18th century, but there is no earlier evidence of its origin.

==Cards==

A deck of Italian cards consist of 40 cards, divided into four suits. Neapolitan, Piacentine, Triestine, and Sicilian cards are divided into (Cups), or (Golds or Coins), (Swords) and (Clubs) or (Clubs in Sicilian), while Piemontesi, Milanesi and Toscane cards use the &#x27;French&#x27; suits, that is (Hearts), (Diamonds, ), (Flowers) and (Spades, ).

The values on the cards range numerically from one through seven, plus three face cards in each suit: Knave [ in Italian] (worth a value of 8), Knight [ in Italian] in the Neapolitan-type decks, Queen [ in Italian] in the Milanese-type decks (worth 9), and King [ in Italian] (worth 10). A Knave is a lone male figure standing. The Knight is a male figure riding a horse; the Queen is a female figure. The King is a male figure wearing a crown. To determine the face value of any numeric card, simply count the number of suit icons on the card. Since the Coins/Diamonds are important in winning some points, the cards of that suit are also nicknamed as &quot; (handsome): so, &quot; is the Seven of Coins/Diamonds, &quot; is the ace of Coins/Diamonds.

==Rules==
All players arrange themselves around the playing surface. If playing in teams, team members should be opposite each other. One player is chosen to be the dealer.
Each player receives three cards. The dealer deals them out one card at a time, in a counter-clockwise direction, beginning with the player to their right. During this deal, the dealer will also place four cards face up on the table. A table card may be dealt before the deal begins, immediately after dealing a card to themselves but before dealing to the next player, or after dealing all players all three cards.

As it is impossible to sweep in a game where the initial table cards include three or four kings, such a deal is considered invalid. The cards are re-shuffled, and the dealer deals again.

The player to the dealer&#x27;s right begins play. This player has two options: either place a card on the table or play a card to capture one or more cards. A capture is made by matching a card in the player&#x27;s hand to a card of the same value on the table, or if that is not possible, by matching a card in the player&#x27;s hand to the sum of the values of two or more cards on the table. In both cases, both the card from the player&#x27;s hand and the captured card(s) are removed and placed face down in a pile in front of the player. These cards are now out of play until scores are calculated at the end of the round. If by capturing, all cards were removed from the table, then this is called a , and an additional point is awarded at the end of the round (unless this happened with the final card played by the last player of the last hand of a round, in which case cards are still captured but no additional point is awarded).
:Example: the player&#x27;s hand contains the 2 of coins, 5 of swords, and 7 of clubs (or batons). On the table are the ace of coins, 5 of cups, and 6 of swords. The player&#x27;s options are:
# Place the 2 of coins on the table;
# Capture the 5 of cups using the 5 of swords, and place both cards face down in front of themselves;
# Capture the 6 of swords and ace of coins using the 7 of clubs, and place all three cards face down in front of themselves.

Note that it is not legal to place on the table a card that has the ability to capture. For example, if a 2 and a 4 are on the table and a player holds a 6, the player must either take that trick or play a different card from their hand.

In any circumstance in which a played card may capture either a single or multiple cards, the player is forced to capture only the single card. For example, if the cards on the table are 1, 3, 4, and 8 (Knave, or in Italian), and the player plays another Knave, the player is not allowed to capture the 1, 3, and 4, even though their total does add up to 8. Instead, the player is only allowed to capture the Knave.

After all players have played all three cards, the dealer deals out three more cards to each player, again beginning with the player to their right. That player then begins play again. No additional cards are dealt to the table. This process is repeated until no cards remain in the deck.

After the dealer has played the final card of the final hand of the round, the player who most recently captured is awarded any remaining cards on the table, and points are calculated for each player or team. If no team has yet won the game, the deal moves to the right. The new dealer shuffles and deals the cards as described above.

==Scoring==
Points are awarded at the completion of each deal. If playing in teams, the team members combine their captured cards before counting to calculate points. Players get one point for each &quot;.

In addition, there are up to four points available for the following, each worth 1 point apiece:
* captured the greatest number of cards.
* captured the greatest number of cards in the suit of coins.
* captured the seven of coins (&quot; or &quot;&quot;).
* obtained the highest &quot;prime&quot; (), erroneously referred to as simply &quot;capturing the majority of sevens&quot;.

If two or more teams or players capture the same number of cards, the same number of coin cards, or the same prime value, no point is awarded for that result, e.g. if both team 1 and team 2 capture 20 cards total, neither gets a point for the most cards.

The &quot;prime&quot; for each team is determined by selecting the team&#x27;s &quot;best&quot; card in each of the four suits, and totaling those four cards&#x27; point values. When calculating the prime, a separate point scale is used. The player with the highest number of points using this separate point scale gets one point toward the game score.

The most common version of the separate scale is:
If one team captures the seven of cups and coins, the six of clubs and the ace of swords, that team&#x27;s prime is (21 + 21 + 18 + 16) = 76.

Other versions of the prime&#x27;s point scale exist. Most use the same ranking of cards but have variant scores, e.g. 0 points for face cards instead of 10. A variant that is popular in America but disliked by purists is to award the prime to the person with the most sevens, or the person with the most sixes if there is a tie, down to aces, and so on.

Obviously, the seven of coins is the most valuable card in the deck, as it alone contributes to all the four points. A player or team can win the &quot;prime&quot; even with only one seven but other useful cards. If one player has three sevens (3x21) and no cards of the fourth suit (sum=63), their opponent can win the &quot;prime&quot; with one seven (21) and three aces (3x16), for their sum would be 69. Therefore, it is a common tactic, while playing the game, to capture aces and sixes whenever possible.

Likewise, if a player is holding a six and there are an ace, a two, a four, and a five on the table, they should choose the five plus the ace, unless they have already taken the seven or the six of the suit of the ace and unless one of the two remaining cards is of the coins suit and they have not made the point of coins yet.

In addition to the four standard points (called &quot;, ), teams are awarded additional points for every &quot; they took during game play. A is awarded when a team manages to sweep the table of all cards. That is, if the table contains only a 2 and a 4, and player A plays a 6, player A is awarded a . Clearing the table on the last play of the last hand of a round does not count as a .

The game is played until one team has at least 11 points and has a greater total than any other team. No points, including points, are awarded mid-round; they are all calculated upon completion of the round. For that reason, if the current score is 10 to 9, and the team with 10 points captures the seven of coins or a , the team cannot immediately claim victory. It is still possible that the opposing team could end up with a tied or higher score once all points are calculated.

In some Italian cities, before the game the players can agree to play with the variant. In that scenario, if a player is winning 7 points to 0 then the game can be considered over and the player does not have to reach the total of 11 points.

It is also possible to agree on a different score, usually with increments of five or ten, e.g., 16, 21 or 31 points.

==Idioms==
Traditionally, one card from a sweep is turned face up in the captured cards, to remind players while calculating points that a was won, and to taunt them. Many players deal the initial table cards in a 2x2 square.

==Variants==
There are many variants and minor variations of . Since there are no formal rules, it is good manners to agree with the other players on the rules that are to be used before starting a game.

Many of the variations here can be combined. For example, a common variant in the Milan area combines &quot;, &quot; and &quot;.

===Playing with French-suited cards===
When playing with a standard 52-card pack with French suits, 12 cards need to be removed from the deck. Easiest for most new players is to remove the face cards, and therefore play with cards ranging numerically from one through ten. More traditional is to remove the eights, nines, and tens from the deck, which yields the 40-card &quot; deck. With the Milanese deck the Jack is 8, the Queen is 9, and the King is 10 (note that in some Neapolitan decks, the Jack is called &quot;Lady&quot; and is worth 8). Regardless of which cards are removed, the diamonds suit is used for the Italian coin suit, making capturing the most diamonds and the seven of diamonds each worth a point.

Alternatively, it is possible to play an 8 player game of scopa using all 52 cards. 4 cards are placed face-up on the table, and 3 cards are dealt to each player for 2 rounds (52 = 4 + 3 * 8 * 2). Jacks are treated as value 11, Queens as 12, and Kings as 13. It is recommended to play multiple games so that each player has the opportunity to deal and to mitigate first-player advantage. Points can be rewarded for ties, and the player with the most points after all the games is the winner.
In this variation of the game, playing an Ace captures all cards currently on the table (and does not count as a ).

Depending on the variant chosen, it can happen that an ace is already on the table when one draws an ace. Rules vary as to whether or not the player will take all the cards, but usually, the player takes only the ace already on the table. This event, that every player will try to avoid, is called &quot;burning an ace&quot;.

===Scopone===
The game of (sometimes referred to as ) is based on . In this game, which must be played in two teams of two, players are dealt all nine of their cards at the start of each round. Play proceeds around the table until all players have played all of their cards.

In another form of the game, , the players are dealt ten cards each so that none are left.

 is mostly played in the latter variant.

===Napola===
In this variation (also known as ), a team capturing the ace, two, and three of coins achieves the (aka ) and is awarded additional points equal to the highest consecutive coin they obtain, e.g. if a team captures the ace, two, three, four, and five, and eight of coins, that team is awarded 6 additional points. 3 points for the , 1 point for each other (card in the suit of coins). ( 7) is then worth 2 points (one for the card and one for being in the sequence) as is ( K), if the variation below is played.

Because of the higher number of points awarded per game, the game is played until one team has 21 points, rather than 11. Sometimes a team that manages to capture all 10 coins in a single round wins the game immediately.

===Additional points===
In the () version, the King of coins also counts as a point, just as does the seven of coins.

In some regions of Calabria (especially near Cosenza), a point is awarded for the seven of cups in addition to the seven of coins.

In Napoli, if a player gets all four sevens in a hand, as well as scoring a point for the primiera they get an additional point (). 
In this variation, the played card does not take a card or set of cards that sum to the value of the card played. Rather, it takes any set of cards including itself that add to 15. If the table is A, 3, 5, 7, playing a 2 would take itself plus the A, 5 and 7 (A + 2 + 5 + 7 = 15).
The game of (in Ligurian or ) is the variant most commonly found in Liguria and bordering areas such as Lower Piedmont, and is usually played with the 40-card Genoese deck by 2, 3 or 4 players. This variant combines elements of traditional , , and , and awards additional points for special combinations held in the hand or captured.

Each player is dealt three cards, and four cards are dealt to the table. If two or more aces are dealt to the table, the cards are collected, re-shuffled, and dealt again by the next dealer.

====Capture====
Cards in can be captured in one of three ways:
* &#x27;Simple capture&#x27;. Like in , a card in one&#x27;s hand can capture a card on the table of the same rank; or multiple cards whose ranks add up to its value. When a single card can capture different combinations of cards, players may choose whichever combination suits them best. They are not forced to take the least amount of cards possible. Thus, with &#x27;J 5 3&#x27; on the table, a player holding a &#x27;J&#x27; would be free to either capture the &#x27;J&#x27;, or the &#x27;5&#x27; and &#x27;3&#x27; (and not be forced to take the first option, like in ).
* &#x27;Fifteen-capture&#x27;. Similarly to , a card in one&#x27;s hand can capture one or more cards on the table when the total sum of their values adds up to 15. Similarly to above, when multiple captures are available with a single card, players may choose the one they prefer. For example: with &#x27;A 6 7&#x27; on the table, a player holding a &#x27;J&#x27; could choose to either capture the &#x27;7&#x27; (since ) or the &#x27;A&#x27; and the &#x27;6&#x27; ().
* &#x27;Ace-capture&#x27;. Playing an ace allows a player to capture all cards on the table, and counts as a (worth one point). This type of capture is always possible, unless an ace is already on the table – in which case playing the ace can only capture the ace already on the table (or be used to perform a &#x27;fifteen-capture&#x27;, if applicable).

When multiple types of captures are possible, players are always free to choose the one that suits them best, with the exception of the ace-capture which is unavailable when an ace is already on the table.

====Bonuses====
There are two hand bonuses available which award points for certain combinations of the three cards held in the hand:
* A &#x27;three-point bonus&#x27; (in Ligurian or ) is awarded to players who hold three cards whose values add up to strictly less than 10 (e.g. &#x27;7 A A&#x27;, &#x27;A 3 4&#x27;, etc.). Normally, the player scoring this bonus keeps tracks of the extra points by marking three .
* A &#x27;ten-point bonus&#x27; (in Ligurian ) is awarded to players that hold three cards of the same rank.
Such bonuses must be declared before the player holding them has played their first card (typically this is done by knocking on the table) and the player making the announcement must reveal their hand and leave it turned up. For the rare cases in which a hand qualifies for both bonuses (e.g. when a player holds three threes), only the ten-point bonus is normally awarded, although variations to this rule exist.

Two more bonuses are available to the dealer, as a way of balancing the fact that players in this role are generally at a disadvantage:
* &#x27;One-scopa &#x27;. If the four cards dealt by the dealer to the table at the start of a round add up to 15, the dealer captures them and marks a .
* &#x27;Two- bonus&#x27;. If the four cards dealt to the table at the start add up to 30, the dealer captures them and scores two .

For the purposes of the two hand bonuses and the two dealer bonuses, the &#x27;7&#x27; counts as a wildcard (in Ligurian , in Italian ) and can play the role of any other card that the player chooses, but only as long as doing so allows them to score one of these four bonuses. For instance, a player holding &#x27;Q Q 7&#x27; may declare that the &#x27;7&#x27; is a queen, thus qualifying them for the ten-point bonus. The &#x27;7&#x27; will then keep its declared rank (in this example a queen, which has a value of nine) for the rest of the hand for the purposes of card capturing (and could therefore capture a &#x27;6&#x27; since ), but will then revert to being the &#x27;7&#x27;. On the other hand, a player holding &#x27;Q K 7&#x27; is not allowed to take advantage of the &#x27;7&#x27; as a wildcard since, no matter what value it might be declared to have, this will not allow the player to score a bonus.

====Scoring====
Scoring works similarly to standard , with points being awarded for having captured the most cards, the most diamonds, the &#x27;7&#x27;, holding the best &#x27;prime&#x27;, and an extra point for each ( ). Additionally:
* Three points are awarded for capturing &#x27;A23&#x27;, known in Ligurian as and in Italian as . This bonus can be extended by having captured further cards in the sequence, so that &#x27;A234&#x27; is worth four points, all the way up to &#x27;A23456&#x27; which is worth six points.
* Five points are awarded for capturing &#x27;JQK&#x27;, known in Ligurian as and in Italian as .

With such a high degree of point-awarding combinations and the possibility of scoring dozens of points in a single hand, games are tense affairs, where seemingly desperate situations can be reversed in a matter of minutes. As a result, the game is typically played until a player (or team, if playing the 4-player partnership variant) reaches 51 points. However, if a player or team manages to capture all diamonds in one round, they win the game immediately.

===Libyan Scopa===
Scopa is very popular in Libya and is usually played as mentioned above, but some local variations are often added, such as:
* a sweep of Diamonds (sometimes eight are enough) will reset the opponent to zero,
* players count Scopas based on the value of the winning card (if the &#x27;winning card&#x27; is worth 7, the scopa is worth 7),
* players count Scopa values based on the total number of cards involved (if a scopa numbers 5 cards, the number of points awarded for that scopa equals 5; if a scopa is but 2 cards, only 2 points are awarded).

===Scoring the prime===
A number of variant point systems are used for calculating the prime, most of which produce the same order of hands. One notable variant that does not produce the same order is to count 0 points for each face card.

===Final score===
Some play to 16 or 21 points, or even to an arbitrary score agreed to at the beginning of the game.

==Computer versions==
There is a playable version of within the Nancy Drew game .

There are apps for Android smartphones and the Nokia internet tablet running the Maemo operating system, as well as for iOS iPads and iPhones.

<text>Diane Roy (born January 9, 1971) is a Canadian wheelchair racer. Between 1996 and 2016 she competed at six consecutive Paralympics and five consecutive world championships and won 11 medals, including a gold medal in the marathon at the 2006 World Championships.

==Career==
The 2004 Summer Olympics featured a demonstration of the women&#x27;s 800 m wheelchair event, in which Roy finished fourth. She also participated in the 2004 Summer Paralympics, taking a bronze medal in both the 400 metre and 1500 metre races.

At the 2008 Summer Paralympics Roy was initially awarded the gold medal in the 5000 m T54. However a re-run of the race was ordered by the International Paralympic Committee following protests by the Australian, US and Swiss teams after six competitors were involved in a crash on the penultimate lap. The re-run race resulted in the same three athletes winning medals but in a different order, with Roy placing second.

In 2009, she was inducted into the Terry Fox Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==
Roy spent the majority of her childhood on a farm in Lac-des-Aigles, Quebec. She is the seventh of eight children, having five brothers and two sisters. Once she entered high school, Roy developed an interest in several sports, including basketball, badminton, downhill skiing, tennis, and handball in particular, which she played until her last year of high school. At age 17, an all-terrain vehicle accident left Roy with a paralyzing injury and without the use of her legs. It halted her activities temporarily.

Since about 1998 Roy works as an administrative assistant for Royal LePage. She has a son Émile.

<doc id="922035" wikidata="Q7767670" url="?curid=922035" title="The Swimmer (short story)">
<text>&quot;The Swimmer&quot; is a short story by American author John Cheever. It was originally published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on July 18, 1964, and later in the short-fiction collections &quot;The Brigadier and the Golf Widow&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Stories of John Cheever&quot; (1978). Considered one of the author&#x27;s most outstanding works, &quot;The Swimmer&quot; has received exhaustive analysis from critics and biographers.

In 1968, &quot;The Swimmer&quot; was adapted into a film of the same name, starring Burt Lancaster. This is the only literary work by Cheever that has appeared on screen. &quot;The Swimmer&quot; is also a crucial plot reference in Nanni Moretti&#x27;s 2023 movie &quot;A Brighter Tomorrow&quot; (&quot;Il sol dell&#x27;avvenire&quot;).

==Plot==
The story is told from a third-person limited point-of-view, in which the focal character is Neddy Merrill, a resident of suburban Westchester County, New York.

Neddy Merrill is lounging poolside at the residence of his well-to-do neighbors, the Westerhazys. He is entering middle age, and though in the twilight of his youth, appears to possess a supreme optimism. On a whim, he conceives of returning to his home, located eight miles on the other side of the county, by way of the swimming pools at the homes of fourteen suburbanite couples, all friends or acquaintances of his. Styling himself a new-age &quot;explorer,” he dubs the series of pools the &quot;Lucinda River&quot; in honor of his wife. 

Initially, the journey progresses splendidly. He is greeted warmly by friends and associates, male and female. He imbibes alcoholic beverages along the way. Despite the ever-present afternoon light, it becomes unclear how much time has passed; at the beginning of the story it is clearly midsummer, but eventually all natural signs point to the season being autumn. The story&#x27;s tone gradually becomes sinister and surreal. Threatening storm clouds gather.

Midway through his aquatic journey, some of Neddy&#x27;s friends mention his serious financial misfortunes although he seems unaware of these. He meets with undisguised hostility at the poolside party of the Biswangers, a couple whom Neddy and his wife Lucinda have persistently snubbed socially. At the home of Eric Sachs, one of Neddy&#x27;s closest friends, he is informed by Sachs&#x27;s wife that Eric survived a life-threatening operation three years previous: Neddy has absolutely no recollection of Eric&#x27;s illness. At the pool of Neddy&#x27;s discarded mistress, Shirley Adams, she informs him she won&#x27;t lend him any more money or serve him a drink, and dismisses him. Neddy proceeds on his increasingly grim odyssey.

Neddy&#x27;s physical strength declines precipitously, and it becomes painful for him to swim the length of each pool. Neddy is further disoriented when he feels a chill in the air, and notices, in the darkening skies, the constellations of autumn rather than summer. The normally stoic swimmer begins to weep.

Finally, Neddy staggers to his home only to discover that the doors are locked: The house is empty and long deserted.

==Background==
Some scholars believe the story, originally conceived as a novel and pared down from over 150 pages of notes, is Cheever&#x27;s most famous and frequently anthologized. As published, the story is highly praised for its blend of realism and surrealism; the thematic exploration of suburban America, especially the relationship between wealth and happiness; and his use of myth and symbolism.

According to critic Scott Donaldson, the composition of &quot;The Swimmer&quot; was a protracted struggle which occupied Cheever for two months. He described the &quot;terribly difficult&quot; ordeal in an interview with Alexandra Grant:

Donaldson reports that &quot;it was the last story he wrote for a long time.&quot;

==Critical assessment==
&quot;The Swimmer&quot; is widely regarded as one of Cheever&#x27;s &quot;genuine masterpieces&quot; and perhaps the finest piece of short fiction in his oeuvre. The work is frequently found in anthologies.
Biographer Scott Donaldson writes that &quot;The Swimmer&quot; has received &quot;as much critical attention as anything Cheever wrote, and deservedly so, since it is beautifully crafted and carries a powerful emotional charge.&quot;

W. B. Gooderham of &quot;The New York Times&quot; writes: &quot;Cheever&#x27;s greatest short story transcends its influences and any autobiographical frisson to emerge as a quietly devastating journey into one man&#x27;s heart of darkness. And as a piece of prose it is as near-miraculous as the journey it describes…&quot;

==Theme==
Cheever&#x27;s conception for the story was originally a straightforward and unambiguous invocation of the Greek myth of Narcissus.

Cheever recalled: 

Cheever deepened the metaphoric and mythic elements. Biographer Patrick Meanor identifies several layers of ancient myth and legend in Cheever&#x27;s story. Among these are Arthurian quest for the Holy Grail and the Fisher King, the Homeric tale of Odysseus, and a Dante-like descent into the netherworld.

Meanor also notes &quot;an ethnic arrangement&quot; for the names of the couples Neddy Merrill encounters on his fateful trek, beginning with Scots and English surnames of WASPs, then to surnames associated with &quot;German to the Jewish to the Irish.&quot; Meanor also detects a highly crafted &quot;water metaphor&quot; in the ontological roots of these names.

Literary critic Lynne Waldeland notes that the significance of Neddy Merrill&#x27;s &quot;Lucinda River&quot; is no mere juvenile escapade, and Cheever makes this explicit in the story&#x27;s narrative: &quot;He was not a practical joker nor was he a fool but he was determinedly an original and he had a vague and modest idea of himself as a legendary figure.&quot; Waldeland concludes that &quot;the real point of the story is the celebratory motive of Neddy&#x27;s act with the social realities that emerge as the story progresses, realities that have to do with the role wealth and social status play in the world which Neddy wishes to invest with legendary beauty and meaning...Whatever &quot;happened&quot; we have seen a brightly lit, intelligible, comfortable world suddenly become dark and cold. The story, like a nightmare, leaves the reader with a residual uneasiness.&quot;

Literary critic Samuel Coale observes that &quot;The Swimmer&quot; confronts both his protagonist and the reader with a shocking epiphany:

<text>The Dorsey Brothers were an American studio dance band, led by Tommy and Jimmy Dorsey. They started recording in 1928 for OKeh Records.

==History==
The Dorsey Brothers recorded songs for the dime store labels (Banner, Cameo, Domino, Jewel, Oriole, Perfect). A handful of sides during their Brunswick period were issued by Vocalion.

They signed to Decca in 1934, formed a touring band, with Tommy as front man, and a rather unusual lineup of one trumpet, three trombones, three saxes and four rhythm. The band performed live mainly in the New England area, with acrimony between the brothers steadily building up, until a definitive falling out between Tommy and Jimmy over the tempo of &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Say Never Again Again&quot; in May 1935, after which Tommy walked off the stage. Glenn Miller composed four songs for the Dorsey Brothers when he was a member in 1934 and 1935, &quot;Annie&#x27;s Cousin Fannie&quot;, on which both Tommy and Glenn share the rather racy vocal, &quot;Dese Dem Dose&quot;, &quot;Harlem Chapel Chimes&quot;, and &quot;Tomorrow&#x27;s Another Day&quot;. Miller left in late 1934 to take up the job as Ray Noble&#x27;s musical director and arranger.

In 1935, the Dorsey Brothers Orchestra had two No. 1 recordings on Decca, including &quot;Lullaby of Broadway&quot; with Bob Crosby on vocals, topping the charts for two weeks and No. 1 for three weeks.

Tommy Dorsey permanently left the orchestra in 1935 to take over the Joe Haymes band, turning it into Tommy Dorsey and his Orchestra, with the nucleus of the Dorsey Brothers&#x27; Orchestra carrying on under Jimmy&#x27;s leadership. Tommy&#x27;s chair was filled by the 16-year-old Bobby Byrne. The Dorseys reunited on March 15, 1945, to record a V-Disc at Liederkranz Hall in New York City. Released in June 1945, the disc contained &quot;More Than You Know&quot; and &quot;Brotherly Jump&quot;. The songs were performed by the combined orchestras of Jimmy and Tommy Dorsey. They reunited again in 1947 for the film &quot;The Fabulous Dorseys&quot;. In 1950, Jimmy disbanded his orchestra and joined Tommy&#x27;s band on a permanent basis. On May 23, 1953, the combined orchestra made its television debut on the &quot;Jackie Gleason Show.&quot; Starting in 1954, they had a network TV series, &quot;Stage Show&quot; produced by Jackie Gleason. Elvis Presley made his national television debut on their show in 1956. Charlie Parker, who as a fledgling alto sax player expressed an admiration for Jimmy, died in front of the TV while watching a Dorsey Brothers&#x27; show. When in November 1956 Tommy died in his sleep from choking on his own vomit, Jimmy, already desperately ill, carried on for some months with Tommy&#x27;s silent trombone displayed on stage, until in June 1957 he succumbed to lung cancer.

Jimmy and Tommy appeared as the Mystery Guests on the October 16, 1955 airing of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;. They were guessed by Dorothy Kilgallen.

In 1996, the U.S. Postal Service issued a commemorative postage stamp in honor of Jimmy Dorsey and Tommy Dorsey.

<doc id="922045" wikidata="Q5552874" url="?curid=922045" title="Gerry Marsden">
<text>Gerard Marsden MBE (24 September 1942 – 3 January 2021) was an English singer-songwriter, musician and television personality, best known for being leader of the Merseybeat band Gerry and the Pacemakers. He was the younger brother of fellow band member Freddie Marsden.

Gerry and the Pacemakers had the distinction of being the first act to have their first three recordings go to number 1 in the UK charts. Although they never had a number 1 in the United States, they were the second-most successful group from Liverpool, after the Beatles, to have hits on the United States Billboard pop charts. Their 1965 musical film &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; was co-written by Tony Warren.

==Early life==
Marsden was born at 8 Menzies Street, Toxteth, Liverpool, to Frederick Marsden and Mary McAlindin. His interest in music began at an early age. He remembered standing on top of an air-raid shelter singing &quot;Ragtime Cowboy Joe&quot;, and getting a great reception from onlookers.

==Career==
Gerry and the Pacemakers formed in 1959. They were the second group signed by Brian Epstein, the first being the Beatles, and remained among his favourite artists. Their first single was 1963&#x27;s &quot;How Do You Do It?&quot;, recommended by George Martin after it was initially given to the Beatles. This was the first number one hit for the Pacemakers. It was recorded at Abbey Road Studios and was released on EMI&#x27;s Columbia label.

The group&#x27;s second number one was &quot;I Like It&quot;, followed by &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, both released later in 1963. The group&#x27;s other singles included &quot;It&#x27;s Gonna Be Alright&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m the One&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Let the Sun Catch You Crying&quot;, and &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot;, all released in 1964. A musical film &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot;, considered to be their version of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Hard Day&#x27;s Night&quot;, was co-written by &quot;Coronation Street&quot; creator and writer Tony Warren, and was released in 1965.

The Pacemakers disbanded in October 1966. After leaving the group, Marsden maintained a low-key career on television, including a regular slot on children&#x27;s television in &quot;The Sooty Show&quot;. He also starred in the West End musical &quot;Charlie Girl&quot; alongside Derek Nimmo and Anna Neagle, replacing another pop singer, Joe Brown. A new song, &quot;Liverpool&quot;, was added to the score to tie in with Marsden&#x27;s Liverpool accent.

In 1983, Marsden and the Pacemakers&#x27; &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; was covered by another band from Liverpool, Frankie Goes to Hollywood, in a new arrangement as the B-side of their song &quot;Relax&quot;; at least partly due to this, Marsden began receiving significant royalties (with his total yearly publishing royalties at the time being equivalent to $250,000 USD). By that time, Marsden also owned a radio station in Liverpool and owned real estate in England and Spain.

Marsden returned to #1 in the charts twice during the 1980s with re-recordings of two of his old hits, with all profits going to charity. In 1985 after the Bradford Football Club stadium tragedy in which 56 were killed, he formed a group called the Crowd, which included other musicians, singers, and radio disc jockeys, to produce a new version of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;. On 18 April 1989, three days after the Hillsborough disaster in which 97 Liverpool F.C. fans died, he joined forces with Paul McCartney, the Christians, Holly Johnson, and his production trio Stock, Aitken &amp; Waterman on a new version of &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot;.

In 1993 Marsden published his autobiography, &quot;I&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot;, co-written with former &quot;Melody Maker&quot; editor Ray Coleman. In 1990, he recorded the song &quot;Red White and Blue&quot;, with &quot;The England Supporters Club&quot;, that also appears on the Euro 96 album &quot;England&#x27;s Glory&quot;.

In 2012, Marsden and Paul McCartney were among another of musicians that recorded a cover of &quot;He Ain&#x27;t Heavy, He&#x27;s My Brother&quot; for charity; the single was credited to the Justice Collective.

In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, he released a version of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; in tribute to the National Health Service.

== Personal life and death ==
Marsden had an older brother, Freddie, who co-founded and played drums in Gerry and the Pacemakers and who died in 2006.

In 1965, Marsden married Pauline Behan, and they had two daughters, Yvette and Victoria. Yvette introduced her father to Frankie Goes To Hollywood&#x27;s cover of &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot; after hearing it being played in a discotheque.

In September 2003, Marsden had triple bypass heart surgery at Broad Green Hospital in Liverpool. He had a second heart operation in 2016, and announced his retirement in November 2018, although he appeared with Take That at their concert at Anfield in June 2019.

Marsden died on 3 January 2021 at Arrowe Park Hospital in Merseyside, after being diagnosed with a blood infection in his heart. He was 78 years old.

<doc id="922050" wikidata="Q5314190" url="?curid=922050" title="Dunboy Castle">
<text>Dunboy Castle () is a ruined 15th-century castle on the Beara Peninsula in south-west Ireland near the town of Castletownbere. The castle&#x27;s tower house and bawn were destroyed in the 1602 Siege of Dunboy, though its ruins remain open to the public.

A later manor house, historically known as Puxley Mansion but sometimes also referred to as Dunboy Castle, was built close to the castle ruins during the 19th century.

==History==

Originally a stronghold of the O&#x27;Sullivan Bere clan, Dunboy Castle was built in the 15th century to guard and defend the harbour of Berehaven. Its presence enabled the O&#x27;Sullivan Bere family, including Donal Cam O&#x27;Sullivan Beare a Gaelic clan leader and &#x27;Chief of Dunboy&#x27;, to control the sea fisheries off the Irish coast and collect taxes from Irish and continental European fishing vessels sheltering in the haven. It was also a centre for the import/export trade to and from the continent. 

In the summer of 1602, during the Nine Years&#x27; War, Dunboy Castle was the scene of the noted Siege of Dunboy which ultimately led to the castle&#x27;s destruction and the breaking of the power of the O&#x27;Sullivan Bere. At that time, Donal Cam O&#x27;Sullivan Beare was in rebellion against the English crown, and Elizabeth I had sent a 5000-strong army under the command of Sir George Carew to suppress the insurgents. Even with its small garrison of 143 men, Dunboy Castle was thought to be impregnable but following a fierce artillery bombardment the walls were smashed and after some desperate hand-to-hand fighting amid the rubble the defenders were finally overcome. The 58 survivors of the two-week siege were executed in the nearby market square.

The remains of the castle were left to ruin, until the mid-17th century when a bastion fort was built on the site. Both the 15th-century castle and 17th-century fort were surveyed by arachnologist Edward M. Fahy in the late 1960s. 

==Manor house==
Near the castle ruins stands Puxley Mansion, also known as Puxley Castle, a 19th-century manor house. It was burnt by the IRA in 1920 in reprisal for the destruction of houses that harboured IRA men and weapons by the Crown Forces. While some restoration work was completed in the 2000s, funding issues halted plans to refurbish the mansion and open it as a hotel. Also sometimes known as Dunboy Castle, the refurbished manor house was reportedly sold in March 2022.
