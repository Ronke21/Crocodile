<text>Elections in [[Mexico]] are held for officials at federal, state, and municipal levels. At the federal level, the nation&#x27;s head of state, the president, is directly elected with the popular vote by all Mexican citizens for a six-year non-renewable term. All members of the bicameral federal legislature, the Congress of the Union, are also elected by all Mexican citizens. At the state level, each state has an elective governor and unicameral congress. At the municipal level, the municipal presidents are also elected by their citizens. Since 2016, a constitutional amendment has designed Mexico City to be a fully autonomous entity on par with the states. Its city mayor, city congress, and borough mayors are elected by their citizens in a similar fashion to those states.

== Voting ==
=== Voter eligibility ===

Mexican citizens over 18 years of age are eligible to vote in all Mexican elections. In order to carry the ballot, the citizen should first request a Voting Credential (), a plastic card issues by the National Electoral Institute (, INE) of the federal government. 

To receive Voting Credential, the citizen need:
* Proof of either their birth in Mexico or their naturalization
* Some form of photo ID
* Proof of their residence

=== Electoral system ===
Mexico is a federal republic, the electoral system is regulated by the Constitution of Mexico as well as the constitutions of the 32 federative entities. These constitutions have separation of powers into three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The heads of executive and all members of legislature are open to for elections by the citizens. Officials of the judiciary are not open for election.

The heads of government executive bodies are commonly directly elected with the popular vote for a six-year term. Terms of elected executives are non-renewable, seeking to be reelected is forbidden by the constitutions. The executive election is held through voting on a single plurality voting ballot for the candidate, and the winner is decided by first-past-the-post voting rule.

The members of the legislatures are commonly directly elected with the popular vote for a three-year (most common) or a six-year (federal senate) term. There are usually term limits placed on members of the legislatures. Most legislative elections have mixed electoral systems. The votes are counted toward both candidates and political parties through 1-ballot mixed single voteing or 2-ballot parallel voting. The winners are decided by a hybrid across first-past-the-post voting (single-member district), party-list proportional representation, and/or mixed-member proportional representation.

=== Political parties ===

Mexico has a multi-party system, with three dominant political parties. Prior to 2000 Mexico had a dominant-party system under the Institutional Revolutionary Party, and a number of smaller opposition parties. Alliances and coalitions are common: normally, they are local (state) affairs and involve one of the big three and any number of minor parties, though in extraordinary occasions two of the big three will ally themselves against the third (e.g., 2003 Colima state election or 2004 Chihuahua state election).

=== Indigenous communities ===

Article 2 of the Constitution of Mexico provides for the self-government of indigenous communities according to their &quot;traditional customs&quot; (). This has resulted in several indigenous communities in Mexico maintaining local systems, notably those of Cherán, and areas under Councils of Good Government control.

== Federal elections ==
According to the Constitution of Mexico, several important officials of the federal government of Mexico ( or ) shall be elected by all Mexican citizens, including the president of Mexico who serves as the head of state and head of government, as well as all members of the bicameral Congress of the Union that consists of Chamber of Deputies and Senate of the Republic.

Under the current Mexican electoral system, the president of Mexico is directly elected for a six-year non-renewable term. The 128 senators are elected for a six-year term. The 500 deputies are elected for a three-year term. The elections are synchronized that Mexican citizens elect the president, senators, and deputies at once every six years. A midterm election for the deputies will happen in the mid point of the six-year period. Federal elections are usually held in early June, July, or August of the year. 

The last general election was held on 2 June 2024 for presidential, senate, and chamber of deputies elections. The next chamber of deputies election are expected to be held in 2027; while the next presidential election and senate election are expected to be held in 2030. 

=== Presidential elections ===

The president of Mexico () is elected for a six-year term by direct election of all Mexican citizens. The candidate who wins a plurality of votes is elected president. No president can serve more than a single term in office, therefore every presidential election in Mexico is a non-incumbent election.

Mexico does not have an office of vice president.

==== Eligibility ====
Candidates for president must be at least 35 years old. They must be Mexican citizens by birth, as must one of their parents. They must have been residents of Mexico for at least 20 years. They also cannot have been either the governor of a state or the chief of government of Mexico City for six months prior to the election.

=== Congressional elections ===
The Congress of the Union () is composed of two chambers: Chamber of Deputies and Senate of the Republic.

==== Chamber of Deputies elections ====

The Chamber of Deputies () has 500 deputies (). The deputies are elected to a three-year term through a 2-ballot parallel voting system. Deputies may serve up to four consecutive terms.
* 300 uninominal deputies () are elected by candidate votes in single-seat federal electoral districts () using first-past-the-post method. The federal electoral districts are divided among the 32 federative entities based on population of approximately every 250,000 citizens each..
* 200 plurinominal deputies () are elected by party-list votes in five 40-seat electoral regions () using proportional representation method. Each electoral region contains multiple federative entities that considers the balance of total populations.

To be eligible to place candidates in the multi-seat districts a party must have candidates in at least 200 of the 300 single-seat districts and must win at least 2% of the vote in those elections. The 200 PR-seats are distributed based on the percentage of the total national votes earned by each party without taking into account the 300 plurality-seats (parallel voting). However, since 1996, a party cannot get more seats overall than 8% above its result nationally (i.e., to win 50% of the legislative seats, a party must win at least 42% of the vote nationwide). There are three exceptions on this rule: first, a party can only lose PR-seats due to this rule (and no plurality-seats); second, a party can never get more than 300 seats overall (even if it has more than 52% of the vote nationally); and third, a party can exceed this 8% rule if it wins the seats in the single-member districts. 

==== Senate elections ====

The Senate of the Republic (), or Chamber of Senators (), has 128 senators (). The senators are elected to a six-year term through a 1-ballot mixed single vote system, where the single party-list vote is counted in the following two ways. Senators may run for two consecutive terms.
* 96 senators are elected from the 32 federative entities. Each federative entity elects 3 senators by mixed-member proportional representation, where two seats are awarded to the party with the most votes and one seat is awarded to the party with the second most votes.
* 32 senators are elected by the party-list proportional representation on a nationwide basis.
Candidates for the Chamber of Senators must be registered voters at least 25 years old. They also must have been born in, or been residents of the states they are running in for at least six months.

==== Other restrictions ====
Electoral magistrates, the Secretary of the Electoral Tribunal, and the Executive Secretary and Executive Director of the INE must separate themselves from their positions for at least three years before seeking legislative office.

== State and Mexico City elections ==
Mexico has 32 federative entity () which includes 31 states and Mexico City. Each federative entity elects its own head of executive (governor or head of government) and all members of legislature (congress).

=== Gubernatorial and head of government elections ===

The leader of a federative entity is officially named governor () for a Mexican state, and head of government () for Mexico City. These officials are elected for a six-year non-renewable term by the citizens of that federative entity.

To be a governor or head of government:
* Candidates born in the federative entity must have been a resident for three years previous to the election
* Candidates born outside of the federative entity must have been residents for five years previous to the election
* Candidates must be at least 30 years old
* Candidates cannot have been a minister of any religion for five years previous to the election
* Candidates cannot have been in the military or a head of public security forces for 90 days previous to the election
* Candidates cannot have citizenship in any country other than Mexico

=== Congressional elections ===

Each federative entity has a unicameral legislature officially named congress (). Members of the congresses are called deputies (). All seats of the congress are elected to three-year terms in a mixed electoral system. Deputies can serve up to four consecutive terms.

For example, there are 75 seats in the Congress of the State of México. Forty-five seats are apportioned in direct elections in single-member districts and 30 are apportioned via proportional appointments. Political parties nominate their candidates for proportional appointments before the election. For a party to be eligible for proportional-appointment seats they must run candidates in at least 30 districts and receive at least 3% of the vote throughout the state.

Similar to the federal Chamber of Deputies, a party cannot have more than 8% more seats in the legislature than their percentage of state-wide votes (e.g., to win 50% of the legislative seats, a party must win at least 42% of the vote statewide) unless that excess was earned in the direct elections.

To be a deputy of the congress:
* Candidates born in the federative entity must have been a resident for one year previous to the election
* Candidates born outside of the federative entity must have been residents for three years previous to the election
* Candidates must be at least 21 years old
* Candidates cannot have been a minister of any religion for five years previous to the election
* Candidates cannot have worked for any election commission for two years previous to the election
* Candidates cannot have been a sitting municipal or federal legislator for 90 days previous to the election
* Candidates cannot have been a sitting judge for 90 days previous to the election
* Candidates cannot have been in the military or a head of public security forces for 90 days previous to the election
* Candidates cannot be a sitting governor

== Municipal and borough elections ==
Under the current administrative divisions of Mexico, states are divided into municipalities and Mexico City is divided into boroughs. The autonomy of these divisions are protected by the Constitution of Mexico. Leaders of these divisions, called municipal presidents () or borough mayors (), are directly elected for a six-year non-renewable term. As of March 2024, there are 2,460 municipalities and the 16 boroughs, this constitutes 2476 electoral territorial units.

<text>Elections in Chile are held nationwide, including the presidency, parliament, regional offices, and municipal positions. Chilean citizens and foreign residents with legal residency of at least five years, who are 18 years or older on election day, are eligible to vote. Previously, voting was voluntary, but since 2023, it has become compulsory.

Presidential elections are held to select the chief of state and head of government for a four-year term, allowing for non-consecutive re-election. Candidates can be nominated by political parties or run as independent candidates, requiring a specific number of signatures. Parliamentary elections follow a system of proportional representation, and the country&#x27;s bicameral Congress consists of a Chamber of Deputies and a Senate. The electoral system for parliamentary elections underwent reforms in 2017, which changed the number of electoral districts and senatorial constituencies.

Regional and municipal elections also occur, with direct elections determining regional boards and mayors. Referendums, both national and local, are part of Chile&#x27;s electoral system. The country conducts primaries, both legal and extralegal, to select candidates for various positions. The voting process is conducted in-person and requires a national identity card or passport.

The independent Electoral Service (Servicio Electoral or Servel) oversees the electoral process, with the winners being declared by the Election Certification Court.

==Schedule==

===Election===
===Inauguration===
==Electorate==

Citizens of Chile and foreign residents with legal residency of at least five years, who are 18 years or older on election day, are eligible to vote. All eligible citizens are automatically registered, and voting is compulsory. Between 2012 and 2023, voting was voluntary. Since 2014, Chileans have been able to vote overseas in presidential elections (including primaries) and referendums.

==Presidential elections==
Presidential elections elect a president who serves as the chief of state and head of government for a period of four years. Non-consecutive re-election is permitted.

The president is directly elected by an absolute majority of valid votes (excluding null and blank votes). If no candidate obtains such a majority, a runoff election is held between the two candidates with the most votes. Before 1989, the president was confirmed by Congress if elected by a simple majority.

Each legally operating political party may nominate one of its members as a candidate. Independent candidates must gain the support of a number of independent electors before registering their candidacy. The number of signatures needed is equal to at least 0.5% of the number of people who voted in the most recent Chamber of Deputies election. For the 2013 election, the number was 36,318 signatures.

According to the Constitution, presidential elections take place on the third Sunday of November in the year before the current president&#x27;s term expires. If necessary, a runoff election is held on the fourth Sunday following the first election. The president is sworn in on the day the incumbent president&#x27;s term expires.

Before 2011, presidential elections were held 90 days before the current president&#x27;s term expired. If that day was not a Sunday, the election was moved to the following Sunday. If necessary, a runoff election was held 30 days after the first election, following the Sunday rule. Since 1990, the president has taken office on March 11, so elections were held on or after December 11 of the previous year.

==Parliamentary elections==
===Electoral system until 2017===

Chile&#x27;s bicameral Congress is composed of a Chamber of Deputies (the lower house) and a Senate (the upper house). The country is divided into 60 electoral districts for the Chamber of Deputies and 19 senatorial constituencies for the Senate. (&quot;See&quot; Electoral divisions of Chile &quot;for details.&quot;) Each electoral district and senatorial constituency directly elects two representatives, totaling 120 deputies and 38 senators. Chile is unique in that it was the only country in the world with nationwide two-seat electoral districts.

Deputies serve a four-year term and senators serve an eight-year term. Both deputies and senators are eligible for unlimited reelection. Every four years, half the Senate is replaced. In the first Senate after the restoration of democracy in 1990, senators from odd-numbered regions served a four-year term (1990–1994), while senators from even-numbered regions and the Santiago Metropolitan Region served an eight-year term (1990–1998). The senators from odd-numbered regions elected in 1993 served the standard eight-year term (1994–2002).

According to the Constitution, parliamentary elections must be held in conjunction with presidential elections.

Candidates may register with either the support of a political party or a group of citizens. Party affiliation is optional for candidates supported by a political party, but candidates supported by a group of citizens must not be affiliated with any political party and must collect signatures from independent electors. The number of signatures required is at least 0.5% of the total votes cast in the last Chamber of Deputies election in that electoral district (for a lower-chamber seat) or last Senate election in that senatorial constituency (for a Senate seat).

Two or more political parties can form an alliance, known as a &quot;pact,&quot; to present up to two candidates per electoral district or senatorial constituency. The candidates do not have to be affiliated with any of the parties in the pact, but they cannot be affiliated with a political party outside of the pact.

Political parties that are not part of a pact may present up to two candidates per electoral district or senatorial constituency, and the candidates must be affiliated with that party.

In each electoral district and senatorial constituency election, the two entities (pact, political party not part of a pact, or independent candidate not part of a pact) with the most votes each receive one seat, with the leading candidate in each entity taking the seat. To win both seats, the leading entity must receive at least two times as many votes as the second-leading entity. This is a rare application of the D&#x27;Hondt method, as only two seats are allocated per electoral division.

====Criticism====
This binomial voting system was established by the military dictatorship that ruled Chile until 1990, limiting the proportional system in place until 1973 to two seats per district or constituency. The dictatorship used gerrymandering to create electoral districts that favored rightist parties, with a positive bias towards the more conservative rural areas of the country. The vote-to-seat ratio was lower in districts that supported Pinochet in the 1988 plebiscite and higher in those with the strongest opposition. None of the newly created districts had a margin of more than 2-to-1 in the plebiscite. The authoritarian regime also made it difficult to change the system, requiring a three-fifths majority in both chambers to modify it.

Members of the Concert of Parties for Democracy believe that the system undermines their majority in Congress and exaggerates the representation of the right. The right views the system as necessary for the country&#x27;s stability and to encourage the creation of large coalitions. The left sees the system as undemocratic, denying representation to candidates outside the two main coalitions.

===Changes to electoral system in 2017===

A law reforming the electoral system was published in May 2015. It decreased the number of electoral districts to 28, which were formed by merging existing districts, and reduced the number of senatorial constituencies to 15, with one for each region. Each electoral district elects between three and eight deputies, while each region elects between two and five senators. The number of lawmakers in each chamber was increased, to 155 in the lower chamber, and 50 in the Senate. The D&#x27;Hondt method remains in use to determine the winners. The new system was introduced in the 2017 general elections and significantly changed the composition of Congress.

==Regional elections==

Each region in Chile is governed by a directly-elected regional governor (&quot;gobernador regional&quot;), chosen through a two-round election, unless a candidate secures a minimum of 40% of the vote in the initial round. The governor is supported by a board consisting of regional advisors (&quot;consejeros regionales&quot; or &quot;Cores&quot;), who are also elected directly.

The regional governor serves a four-year term with the possibility of one immediate reelection. Advisors serve four-year terms and are restricted to two consecutive reelections. The number of advisors is proportional to the region&#x27;s population and area in relation to the country.

The position of regional governor was first directly elected in May 2021. Prior to that, the regional government was led by an Intendant (&quot;Intendente&quot;), appointed by the President of the Republic. Regional advisors were first directly elected in November 2013.

=== Electoral reform ===
In October 2009, the Constitution was modified to allow regional advisors to be elected directly through universal suffrage. In June 2013, a law regulated the direct election of regional advisors. Previously, regional advisors were elected by municipal council members in each region, forming electoral colleges for each provincial region. Each region was allocated two advisors per province, with an additional 10 advisors in regions with up to 1 million inhabitants or 14 more in regions with over 1 million residents. These additional advisors were distributed among provinces based on their proportion of the regional population in the latest census, using the D&#x27;Hondt method. The candidate who received the most votes within each province was declared the winner. However, if two or more candidates ran as a list within a province, the winners were determined using the D&#x27;Hondt method. Advisors served four-year terms and could be reelected indefinitely. Elections took place 15 days after the council members took office, and the newly elected advisors were sworn in 60 days after their election.

In December 2012, a temporary article was added to the Constitution, suspending the election scheduled for December 21, 2012, and extending the mandate of the incumbent advisors to March 11, 2014. The same article stated that the advisors&#x27; first direct election would take place on November 17, 2013, coinciding with the presidential and parliamentary elections, provided that the necessary changes to the law were published before July 20, 2013.

In January 2017, the Constitution was modified to allow for the direct election of the regional governor. In February 2018, a law regulated the direct election of regional governors, stating that they would be elected at the same time as mayors, councilors, and regional boards. However, the regional boards would only be elected simultaneously with these offices in October 2024, maintaining the current schedule, which stated that the next regional board elections would take place in November 2021, along with the presidential and parliamentary elections.

==Municipal elections==
Voters directly elect one mayor and a number of councilors per municipality. Mayors are elected by a simple majority, while councilor seats (ranging from 6 to 10, depending on the municipality&#x27;s registered voters) are decided using proportional representation, similar to the D&#x27;Hondt method. Since 2004, mayors and councilors have been elected in separate ballots.

According to the Constitution, councilors have four-year mandates and can be reelected indefinitely. Mayors also have a four-year mandate and can be reelected indefinitely, as set by the law. The election of mayors and councilors takes place on the last Sunday of October, and they take office on December 6 of that year.

The last election was held on October 23, 2016 (moved from its original date of October 30 to avoid conflicting with a four-day holiday), and the next election is scheduled for October 25, 2020.

==Referendums==

===National===
The Constitution provides for binding referendums (&quot;plebiscito&quot;) only in the case where a constitutional reform passed by Congress is completely vetoed by the President and then confirmed by Congress by a two-thirds majority of each chamber. In such an occurrence, the President has the authority to either sign the reform into law or call for a referendum. To date, the President has not exercised this power.

===Communal===
The Constitution allows municipalities to hold binding referendums to address various local issues. Referendums can be initiated by the mayor with council approval, by a two-thirds majority of council members, or by residents who represent 10% of the total voter turnout in the most recent municipal election.

To date, only one such referendum has taken place. It was held in Peñalolén on December 11, 2011, and was used to determine a new zoning plan for the commune.

==Primaries==
===Legal primaries===

There is a system of government-run primaries to select candidates for president, senator, deputy, and mayor. The primaries for president, senator, and deputy are held concurrently.

Primaries can take place within a single political party or within a group of parties, known as a &quot;pact.&quot; Independent candidates may participate in primaries with the backing of a political party or a pact. However, independents are not eligible to be candidates in primaries for congressional seats if the political party supporting the candidate is not part of a pact. Political parties may form separate pacts for presidential and parliamentary primaries. Political parties and pacts are free to decide whether to allow independent electors or electors affiliated with other political parties to participate in their primaries. However, independent electors &quot;must&quot; be allowed to vote in a presidential primary that includes an independent candidate.

According to the Constitution, primary results are legally binding for political parties that use them. Candidates who lose in the primaries are ineligible to run for the same office in the general election, unless the winning candidate dies or resigns before the registration deadline.

The law states that primaries take place on the twentieth Sunday before the election. The first legal primaries for president and deputy took place on June 30, 2013, and the first legal mayoral primaries took place on June 19, 2016.

===Extralegal primaries===

====Presidential====
The Concertación coalition selected its candidate for President of the Republic through primaries in 1993, 1999, and 2009 (in 2005, they were canceled after one of two contenders quit the race). The Juntos Podemos pact selected its presidential candidate in a primary in 2009.

====Parliamentary====
Throughout 2013, the Concertación parties organized primaries to select some of their candidates for seats in Congress.

====Mayoral====
The Concertación organized primary elections on April 1, 2012, in over 40% of communes to select its candidates for mayor for the October 28, 2012 municipal election.

==Voting==
For Chileans, the only document required to vote is a national identity card that is current up to a year before the election or a current passport. Foreigners must present their identity cards in order to vote. The voting process is secret and in-person. Before voting, a voter must present their identity card or passport to verify their registration at the polling place, then sign the registration book. The voter will then receive the ballot(s) with the names, numbers, and party affiliations of all candidates, and go to a voting booth. Using a provided graphite pencil, the voter marks their choices by drawing a vertical line over the printed horizontal line next to the chosen candidate. Marking two or more choices nullifies the vote, and if no candidate is marked, the vote is considered &quot;blank.&quot; After marking the ballot(s), the voter returns them to the polling officer, who removes the serial number, and the voter places them in the appropriate ballot box(es). Finally, the voter&#x27;s national identity card/passport is returned to them.

Most polling places are located in schools or sporting centers, and security is provided by the armed forces and uniformed police (Carabineros) before, during, and after the elections. Since 2012, polling stations have been mixed-sex.

==Suffrage==
The state of suffrage in Chile since 1833:

* From 1833: Men over 25, if single, or 21, if married, able to read and write, and owning property or capital of a certain value fixed by law. (Art. 8 of the 1833 Constitution)
** The 1884 Election Law drops the ownership requirement for men and explicitly bans women from being registered.
* From 1925: Men over 21 able to read and write. (Art. 7 of the 1925 Constitution)
** From 1934: Men over 21 able to read and write (general registry); women over 25 able to read and write (municipal registry, i.e., limited to local elections). (Law No. 5,357)
** From 1949: Men and women over 21 able to read and write. (Law No. 9,292)
* From 1970 until today: Men and women over 18. (Law No. 17,284 modifying Art. 7 of the 1925 Constitution; Art. 13 of the 1980 Constitution)

No Chilean Constitution has ever explicitly prohibited women from voting. The term &quot;chilenos&quot; used in various constitutions to refer to those with the right to vote means both &quot;Chilean men&quot; and &quot;Chilean people,&quot; so no constitutional amendment was necessary to grant women the right to vote.

==Turnout==
Election turnout since 1925.

:&quot;Note: Since 2017, enrollment and turnout figures for presidential elections, presidential primaries and plebiscites include voters from abroad.&quot;

It includes current equipment such as small arms, combat vehicles, explosives, missile systems, engineering vehicles, logistical vehicles, vision systems, communication systems, aircraft, watercraft, artillery, air defence, transport vehicles, as well as future equipment and equipment being trialled.

The British Army is the principal land warfare force of the United Kingdom, a part of British Armed Forces. Since the end of the Cold War, the British Army has been deployed to a number of conflict zones, often as part of an expeditionary force, a coalition force or part of a United Nations peacekeeping operation.

To meet its commitments, the equipment of the Army is periodically updated and modified. Programs exist to ensure the Army is suitably equipped for both current conflicts and expected future conflicts, with any shortcomings in equipment addressed as Urgent Operational Requirements (UOR), which supplements planned equipment programmes.

==Infantry section equipment==
Each rifle section typically consists of 8 soldiers. They are each commanded by a corporal assisted by a lance corporal acting as section second-in-command (2IC). The section is further subdivided into 2 fireteams. The section commander typically commands the Charlie Fire Team, while the 2IC commands the Delta Fire Team.

While equipment formations can be tailored as required by section and platoon commanders, infantry sections are usually issued with the following:

* Charlie Fire Team (4 men)
** 1× Section Commander, Corporal (OR-4), armed with 1 L85A3 rifle and 1 Glock 17 pistol
** 1× Rifleman, Private (OR-1), armed with 1 L85A3 rifle
** 1× Grenadier, Private (OR-1), armed with 1 L85A3 rifle and 1 L123A2 under-barrel grenade launcher
** 1× Sharpshooter, Private (OR-1), armed with 1 L129A1 Sharpshooter rifle
* Delta Fire Team (4 men)
** 1× Second-in-Command, Lance Corporal (OR-3), armed with 1 L85A3 rifle and 1 Glock 17 pistol
** 1× Rifleman, Private (OR-1), armed with 1 L85A3 rifle
** 1× Grenadier, Private (OR-1), armed with 1 L85A3 rifle and 1 L123A2 under-barrel grenade launcher
** 1× Machine Gunner, Private (OR-1), armed with 1 L7A2 general-purpose machine gun

The rifles are typically paired with the ELCAN SpecterOS 4× Lightweight Day Sight (LDS) with a mini-red dot sight (MRD) mounted on the top and a foregrip with an integrated bipod (grenadiers are not issued a foregrip/bipod because they have the L123A2 under-barrel grenade launcher in its place).

The section is also provided MATADOR anti-structure recoilless rifles and NLAW disposable ATGMs, as well as multiple L109A2 high explosive grenades, and L83A1 smoke grenades. Specialist equipment such as claymore mines, L26A1 bangalore torpedoes, L128A1 combat shotgun, etc, can be carried if required.

== Vision systems ==
* Sight Unit Small Arms, Trilux (SUSAT) or SpecterOS Lightweight Day Sights (LDS) - for use with the SA80.
* Advanced Combat Optical Gunsight (ACOG) - to be used with the L129A1 Sharpshooter.
* ARILLS (Assault Rifle In-Line Low Light Sight) - new infrared / thermal imaging sight for the SA80 A3.
* Laser Light Module (LLM &quot;Mk3&quot;) - used for aiming and illumination with the SA80 A3.
* Jim Compact Sight - new infared binoculars that can spot targets from more than 5 km away, have both thermal and low-level light capabilities and can take HD pictures and video recordings. It also has a laser positioning system.
* Magnum Universal Night Sight (MUNS) - high-resolution clip-on night vision weapon sight for the L129A1 Sharpshooter. Detects and recognizes man-size targets in excess of 800 meters.
* FIST Thermal Sight (FTS) - thermal imaging scope designed to be mounted on rifles and light machine guns. Acquired as part of the MoD&#x27;s Future Integrated Soldier Technology.
* Common Weapon Sight (CWS) - image-intensification night vision scope for weapons or handheld surveillance.
* Head mounted Night Vision System (HNVS), based on the American AN/PVS-14.
* Schmidt &amp; Bender 5-25x56 PM II - 25x magnification day scope for the L115A3 Sniper Rifle.
* Sniper Thermal Imaging Capability (STIC) - thermal imagining sight that is mounted on the L115A3 and AX50.
* The command launch unit (CLU) of the Javelin anti-tank missile contains a sophisticated thermal imaging sensor that can double as a reconnaissance tool.
* SMASH X4 sighting system - anti-drone sight mounted on the SA80 A3 that automatically acquires a target from the sight’s field-of-view, and then displays a box around the target in the shooter’s reflex sight, only allowing the shooter to fire when the sight is aligned to hit the target.

== Communications equipment ==
* Personal Role Radio (PRR) - small, light UHF radio with a range of 500m and a battery life of 20 hours, issued to every member of the Infantry section.
* Bowman Combat Net Radio - secure HF, VHF, UHF voice and data communications. The MoD plans to replace Bowman with a system named Morpheus in the future.
* Falcon - joint tactical trunk communications system for the Land Environment.
* Reacher - is a mobile X-Band Satellite Ground Terminal that uses the Skynet V military satellite network
* Small SATCOM - the satellite ground terminal is reasonably lightweight (41 kg) and can be set up by a single trained operator in less than 30 minutes, also using the Skynet V network.
* Skynet - is a family of military communications satellites, they provide strategic and tactical communication services to the branches of the British Armed Forces, the British intelligence agencies, some UK government departments and agencies, and to allied governments including the Five Eyes intelligence alliance members (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States).
* Tactical Satellite Communications (TACSAT) - use low orbiting communications satellites to relay radio signals between operators. The advantage to this method is the ability to communicate in remote areas out of reach of terrestrial transmitters.

====Helmet====
All soldiers are now equipped with the new Virtus helmet (Revision Batlskin Cobra Plus) which provides increased blunt impact protection, has a lighter weight than the preceding Mk7, can be fitted with face and mandible guards for certain roles, is specially shaped to allow effective weapon usage while in a prone position and wearing body armour, and features a permanent universal night vision mount and a scalable counterweight attached to the helmet&#x27;s rear in order to ease strain on the user&#x27;s neck while a night vision device is equipped. The helmet allows the soldier to wear a respirator, hearing protection, goggles and/or a radio headset as necessary.

The previous standard helmet in service was the Mk7 which replaced the older Mk6 and Mk6A helmets on operations.

84,000 Mk 7 helmets were donated to the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2022.

====Combat body armour====
The British Army uses two main combat body armour systems;
The Virtus Scalable Tactical Vest (STV) is the primary body armour system used on live operations, LFTT, and firing ranges and has replaced the previously used Osprey body armour. It is 10 lbs lighter than Osprey and closer-fitting and can have its level of protection more closely scaled to the prevailing threat type. The vest also features a quick-release mechanism to aid safe extraction from hazardous situations such as burning vehicles or drowning and a dynamic weight distribution system which, when linked to a soldier&#x27;s waist belt, aids in spreading the soldier&#x27;s load across the back, shoulders, and hips; a mechanism in the small of the back allows the wearer to adjust the weight bias depending on the situation. The STV can be used in a variety of ways including; load carriage without armour, a fragmentation vest with soft composite armour but no hard plates, a plate carrier with no soft armour, and a full body armour system with both soft armour padding and hard plates.

Enhanced Combat Body Armour (ECBA) is a soft body armour vest that was first introduced in the 1980s and can be augmented with ceramic ballistic plates. It was used on operations until the introduction of the Osprey body armour series in 2006 and is now used solely for training purposes, primarily for non-infantry phase one training recruits.

Ancillary to regular body armour is a three-tier pelvic armour system - issued since 2010 - to mitigate against shrapnel and other blast effects. The first layer is a pair of underwear shorts manufactured from a ballistic silk material. The second layer consists of detachable pelvic body armour that is intended to be worn while &#x27;outside the wire&#x27; to meet the greater threats faced by soldiers on patrol. The third layer consists of knee-length ballistic shorts worn over a soldier&#x27;s combat trousers, offering coverage of the upper leg and wider abdominal region and designed for use by soldiers operating hand-held metal detectors to search for explosive devices or otherwise serving in a combat role where greater levels of protection are required.

8,450 sets of Osprey body armour were donated to the Armed Forces of Ukraine in 2022.

====Respirator====

By January 2015, over 300,000 General Service Respirators had been delivered to replace the older S10 respirator.

Features which differentiate it from the S10 which it replaced are:
* Twin filter canisters can be changed more easily while in a CBRN environment
* Single visor give better visibility and reduces the claustrophobic effect
* Improved drinking system 
* Ability to convert to EU standard canisters with a simple modification

These respirators are also used by the rest of the British Armed Forces.

===Uniforms===
The multi-terrain pattern (MTP) combat clothing is designed to blend with the range of environments such as woodland, jungle, compounds, crops, grassland and arid stone. This change to the British camouflage pattern was the first in 40 years. The uniform is flame-retardant and insect-repellent treated.

Troops on operations are issued with knee length, waterproof socks that have antimicrobial properties similar to those found in medical dressings and keep feet warmer than conventional socks.

===Boots===

In 2012, the MOD purchased a newly designed range of brown combat boots from Haix, Alt-Berg, and other manufacturers for the Army, Royal Marines and RAF to replace the black and Desert Combat Boot previously worn. Five different types of boots, developed to match the Multi-Terrain Pattern uniform, are available to Armed Forces personnel depending on where they are based and what role they are in. Black boots have been retained for wear with most non-camouflage uniforms as well as units on parade in full dress uniform, such as regiments performing ceremonial duties in central London.
* Desert Combat – worn by dismounted troops conducting medium to high levels of activity in desert type environments with temperatures exceeding 40 °C
* Desert Patrol – worn by drivers/armoured troops conducting lower levels of activity in desert type environments exceeding 40 °C
* Temperate Combat – worn by dismounted troops for medium to high levels of activity in temperate (European) climates
* Patrol – worn by mounted troops (drivers/armoured troops) taking part in lower levels of activity in temperate (European) climates
* Cold Wet Weather – worn by dismounted troops for medium to high levels of activity in temperatures down to −20 °C.

===Personal Role Radio===
A Personal Role Radio (PRR) is distributed to every member of an eight-strong infantry section.

It consists of a headset attached to a UHF transmitter/receiver which has 256 channels, a 500m range, 20 hour battery life, weighs 1.5 kg, and is effective through thick cover and walls and floors of buildings, increasing the communication and effectiveness of infantry fireteams.

===Load-carrying equipment===


The Virtus webbing system is the current primary load carrying belt system used by the British Army. It consists of a yoke, MOLLE hip belt and dynamic weight distribution (DWD) system, which provides real weight transference, allowing the soldier, while on the move, to shift the weight of the load between 100% on the shoulders to 100% on the hips and anything in-between. The soldier can choose between a variety of pouches to attach to the belt depending on the mission, including grenade, ammo, PRR, UGL, pistol magazine, medical, bayonet scabbard, water bottle, utility, commander&#x27;s pouch and more.

Usage of privately purchased webbing, whether based on or customised PLCE or with MOLLE compatibility, also remains a very common item. &#x27;Airborne&#x27; webbing, which is a single unit webbing set of multiple pouches sewn or stitched directly onto a foam hip pad is favoured among soldiers for its comfort, stability and durability.

Personal load carrying equipment (PLCE), officially known as 95 pattern webbing, is an older webbing system issued temporarily solely for training purposes during phase 1 &#x27;basic&#x27; training for non-infantry recruits, to carry ammunition, food and water, protective equipment, and other individual supplies. The webbing consists of a belt, a yoke harness, and various belt pouches. The system also consists of two daysacks (backpacks) for use with the Combat Order; these can be attached to a larger &#x27;Bergen&#x27; rucksack for use with the Marching Order. The Osprey body armour and webbing series, the later Virtus scalable tactical vest and webbing, and various items associated with either system such as daysacks all feature MOLLE loops for direct attachment of load carrying pouches, thus obviating the need for and mostly supplanting the earlier PLCE webbing.

PLCE sets have previously been manufactured in the newer MTP camouflage pattern, and both this webbing and earlier DPM webbing (due to the quantity of webbing produced and the durability of its construction and materials, and soldiers personal preference) continues to see occasional usage, particularly during training situations which often see soldiers either wearing the non-MOLLE Enhanced Combat Body Armour vest or wearing no armour at all.

Regardless of the particular load carrying system used by any given soldier, Army doctrine prescribes that it should be capable of holding everything that a soldier needs to operate in the field for up to 24 hours without resupply in &quot;Fighting Order&quot;, for up to 48 hours without resupply in &quot;Patrol Order&quot; and for up to two weeks without resupply in &quot;Marching Order.&quot;.

==Combat vehicles==
== Protected patrol vehicles ==
==Artillery ==
==Air defence and radar==
==Engineering and logistics==
== Explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) and CBRN reconnaissance ==
==MITER vehicle fleet==

The job of the Royal Engineers is to restrict the enemy&#x27;s ability to advance, while also allowing friendly combat forces the freedom to maneuver as necessary. Other tasks undertaken are bomb disposal, construction of fortifications, runways, roads and bridges and the improvement of existing infrastructure to support operations – such as improving existing roads for logistic convoys. To achieve this, they operate a large and diverse fleet of vehicles.
In August 2020, AmeyBriggs (new joint venture between Amey plc and Briggs Defence) was awarded a seven year, £240m contract to maintain, manage and support the British Army&#x27;s fleet of earth-moving, engineer construction and mechanical handling capabilities. The C-vehicle Capability, Defence Mechanical Handling Equipment (DMHE), and Protected Engineering Equipment contracts now form part of the new consolidated MITER contract.AmeyBriggs now provides the British Army with a wide range of earthmoving, construction and materials handling/lifting equipment to support their worldwide training and operational requirements.

In recent years the equipment, which includes excavators, bulldozers, dump trucks, concrete mixers, tractors, lighting towers, forklift trucks and cranes, has been used to help with recovery following the devastation caused by Hurricanes Irma and Dorian in the Caribbean, during major flooding incidents in the UK and supporting the military response to COVID-19 by loading and off-loading vital medical supplies.

==All-terrain vehicles==

There are a number of all-terrain vehicles in service with the British Army.

The Supacat ATMP is a lightweight 6×6 used by 16 Air Assault Brigade Combat Team. It can carry up to 8 troops with a standard NATO pallet of stores and ammunition.

Approximately 900 Grizzly 450 quad bikes are used as light transport for food, water and ammunition to the front line in difficult to access areas or where larger vehicles are not suitable, effectively moving alongside dismounted troops. They also have the ability to evacuate two casualties at a time, thereby speeding up emergency aid.

==United Kingdom Special Forces==

In 2001, 65 Supacat High Mobility Transporter (HMT) 400 vehicles were ordered under Project Minacity after being in development since the late 1990s. The Minacity vehicles entered service in 2003 in Afghanistan. In 2007, the Ministry of Defence ordered the HMT 400 for regular forces, designated as the Jackal.

In 2008, 24 Australian Bushmaster armoured vehicles were purchased for the UKSF for operations in Iraq. The Bushmasters were fitted with additional armour, counter-IED electronics, and a .50 calibre machine gun mounted in a RWS.

In August 2016, &quot;BBC News&quot; reported that the Toyota Land Cruiser-based Jankel Al-Thalab long range patrol vehicle was being used in Syria.

==Watercraft==

===Raiding Craft===
The Rigid Raider is used by the Royal Engineers and is sometimes used in rivers and during amphibious operations, while the Inflatable Raiding Craft, being small and flexible, is also utilised by the Army at times, as a raiding craft to get soldiers quickly across water in small groups, and in other tasks such as flood relief.

SAS Boat Troops also utilise these raiding craft, Boat Troop&#x27;s role covers many aspects of amphibious warfare, although the emphasis is on amphibious insertion/extraction, and demolitions, including attacking ships in harbours with magnetic limpet mines.

===Army Workboat===
Four boats in service, operated by 17 Port and Maritime Regiment and 165 Port and Maritime Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps as small tugs and general purpose work-boats in support of amphibious operations. They have a displacement of 48 tonnes and a maximum speed of 10 knots. The Army Workboat can be used as tugs for Mexeflotes, positioning other pontoon equipment and for handling flexible pipelines. It is also used for assisting with firefighting and the provision of fuel (i.e. fuel being delivered across water.).
===Mexeflote===
Mexeflotes are amphibious landing craft operated by 17 Port and Maritime Regiment and 165 Port and Maritime Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps for amphibious operations and are designed to deliver both armoured vehicles and material from ship to shore. They are usually deployed on the 16,160 tonne Bay-class landing ships of the Royal Fleet Auxiliary. Mexeflote is a powered raft (two diesel engines), used to move goods and vehicles between ship and shore when a pier is not available.

=== Combat Support Boat ===
Both the Royal Engineers and 17 Port and Maritime Regiment and 165 Port and Maritime Regiment, Royal Logistic Corps also make use of the Combat Support Boat since it is capable of being used to support bridging and amphibious operations as well as inland water patrolling and ship-to-shore resupply (it can carry 2 tonnes of cargo or 12 personnel) and diving operations. It is also relatively quick, with a top speed of 30 knots.

==Future equipment==

=== Small-arms equipment ===

==== Future assault rifle, Project Grayburn ====
Replacement project for the SA80, expected to be delivered in 2026. The current Out of Service Date (OSD) for the SA80 rifle is 2030. The new weapon system will consist of a rifle using a common lower receiver group and a variable upper receiver group based on role, likely of a conventional layout rather than a bullpup, with up to four variants.

==== Thermal sight ====
In March 2023, the 2nd Battalion, Royal Yorkshire Regiment trialled working with the Thermal Clip-On Sight, known as TCOS, which is mounted on their helmet. This allows infantry soldiers to see a combined thermal and night vision picture while undertaking activities rather than having to stop and look through a weapon sight.

=== Vehicles ===

==== Mobile Fires Platform programme ====

The Mobile Fires Platform (MFP) programme will replace the AS90 with a new 155 mm self-propelled howitzer to equip the Royal Artillery. On 24 April 2024, the UK announced its selection of the RCH-155. The vehicles will be built in both Germany and the UK and will comprise over 100 UK-sourced components. The platform will consist of the Remote-Controlled Howitzer 155 mm (RCH 155) weapon module fitted to the rear half of the Boxer mechanised infantry vehicle (MIV) and will be in service with the Royal Artillery by the end of the decade.

* 116 to be delivered before 2030.

==== Land Mobility Programme ====
This programmes intends to replace 15 vehicles types with 5 platforms. A total of 1,400 vehicles is planned to be purchased with this programme.

* &quot;Medium Protected Mobility&quot; whose role will consist of command and control, ISTAR, GBAD, CBRN, ambulance, tactical support. These vehicles will replace the Ridgeback (4×4), the Mastiff (6×6) and the Wolfhound (6×6).
* &quot;Light Protected Mobility&quot; whose role will consist of command and liaison, command and control, patrol tasks, ISTAR, GBAD, CBRN, tactical support and utility. These vehicles will replace the Stormer HVM, the FV430 Bulldog, the Iveco LMV (Panther) and the Foxhound. 
* &quot;Light Mobility Vehicle&quot; whose role will consist of general support and utility. These vehicles will replace the Land Rover Defender and the Pinzgauer. Some of the potential successors presented in September 2024 at DVD include:

* &quot;Light Tactical Mobility Platform Light&quot; (LTMP Light, Contract Number: 703466451) Up to 311 vehicles (ATV type)
** 156 to be procured initially
** 155 in option

==== Motorcycles ====
The Parachute Regiment began trialling the Sur-Ron Firefly electric motorcycle in 2021, &quot;for recce, infiltration, but also for communications between positions where you need to pass messages on the man, like we’ve done for hundreds of years, but in a situation where electronic communication is jammed or intercepted.”

==== Unmanned land vehicles ====

The Ministry of Defence selected the Rheinmetall &quot;Mission Master&quot; SP for its Robotic Platoon Vehicles program in 2022. The British Army ordered the Surveillance Autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (A-UGV) in two variants; four in an ISTAR configuration, and three in a cargo configuration.

In March 2023, the first ever UK trial of heavy uncrewed ground systems (H-UGVs) took place. Held over two weeks at the Armoured Trials and Development Unit in Bovington, Dorset, the H-UGVs underwent stringent trials to test their effectiveness in battlefield situations. The trial saw three companies selected to take part to showcase their platforms: Elbit with its Robust, Milrem and its Type X, and Rheinmetall with its Wiesel.

==== Unmanned aerial vehicles ====
The Hydra 400 jet-propelled drone, which provides a maximum lift of 400 kg and fires Brimstone laser-guided missiles, was showcased at DSEI 2023, and will be tested during the next phase of the Army’s Warfighting Experiment (AWE).

=== Air Defence ===

==== SHORAD ====
* The British Army is considering procuring a new mobile short-range air defence (SHORAD) system on an interim basis to replace the Stormer-based Starstreak High Velocity Missile systems that were provided to Ukraine in 2022.

==== Land Laser Directed Energy Weapon (LDEW) ====
* At DSEI 2023, Raytheon UK announced that its high-energy laser weapon system, a product of the MoD’s Land Demonstrator programme, is operationally ready and will be integrated onto a Wolfhound vehicle for testing. The 15-kilowatt laser will be used to stop aerial threats such as unmanned aerial vehicles. 
* In July 2024, it was announced that the weapon had been trialled for the first time on a British Army vehicle at DSTL’s range in Porton Down. The laser weapon neutralised targets such as enemy drones at distances in excess of 1km with 15kW of power. The system can track multiple targets and engage at the speed of light, costing just £10 per shot. The weapon was tested on the Wolfhound armoured vehicle, however it can be mounted on various platforms to meet different operational needs.
* In November 2024, Raytheon UK and the British Army conducted a successful live-firing of the system against moving aerial targets, while also having soldiers trained on the weapon’s targeting and tracking technologies.

=== Communications ===

==== Trinity ====
* The British Army&#x27;s future &quot;broadband for the battlefield&quot; is the Trinity Wide Area Network (WAN). Trinity, which is to be in service by late 2025, will be able to &quot;handle 100 times more data than the current Falcon internet system&quot;, due to be retired by 2026. The Army also plans to fit Trinity nodes to the Boxer armoured vehicle.

<doc id="924165" wikidata="Q19194" url="?curid=924165" title="California State Route 67">
<text>State Route 67 (SR 67) is a state highway in San Diego County, California, United States. It begins at Interstate 8 (I-8) in El Cajon and continues to Lakeside as the San Vicente Freeway before becoming an undivided highway through the eastern part of Poway. In the town of Ramona, the route turns into Main Street before ending at SR 78. SR 67 provides direct access from the city of San Diego to the East County region of San Diego County, including Ramona and Julian.

The route has existed as a railroad corridor since the turn of the 20th century. A highway known as the Julian road was built by 1913, and was designated as Legislative Route 198 in the state highway system by 1935. Route 198 was renumbered SR 67 in the 1964 state highway renumbering. A freeway south of Lakeside was built in the late 1960s, and opened to traffic in 1970. Since then, the portion of the highway north of Lakeside has become known for a high number of traffic accidents and related fatalities. The California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) has made several attempts to remedy the problem and make the road safer.

==Route description==
SR 67 begins as the San Vicente Freeway at I-8 near the Parkway Plaza shopping mall in El Cajon . There are two subsequent interchanges in El Cajon: one with Broadway and Fletcher Parkway, and another with Bradley Avenue. Following this, the freeway continues north to Santee near Gillespie Field, before coming to an interchange with the eastern end of SR 52. Near the Woodside Avenue exit, SR 67 turns northeast, paralleling the San Diego River and entering the unincorporated area of Eucalyptus Hills as it leaves the San Diego urban area. Riverford Road and Winter Gardens Boulevard have interchanges with SR 67.

The freeway ends, and SR 67 turns north and becomes an undivided highway at Mapleview Street, crossing the San Diego River and entering the locale of Moreno. SR 67 then enters the rural area east of Sycamore Canyon County Open Space Preserve near the locale of Foster, passing to the west of San Vicente Reservoir. The road intersects the eastern end of Scripps Poway Parkway and County Route S4 (CR S4), the latter within the Poway city limits. In eastern Poway, SR 67 veers east, eventually leaving the city and entering unincorporated Rock Haven. The road continues near Rosemont, California before turning northeast and becoming Julian Road and then Main Street in downtown Ramona. SR 67 ends at the intersection with SR 78; SR 78 intersects to the northwest as Pine Street and continues northeast along Main Street towards Julian.

SR 67 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and the freeway portion is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. The route is named the CHP Officer Christopher D. Lydon Memorial Freeway from I-8 to Mapleview Street in Lakeside. In 2013, SR 67 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 94,000 between Broadway and Bradley Avenue (the highest AADT for the highway), and 18,100 between Rio Maria Road and Poway Road (the lowest AADT for the highway).

==History==
===Early days===
The &quot;Julian road&quot; had been constructed by 1872, and was used for stagecoaches. In 1883, &quot;The San Diego Union and Daily Bee&quot; described it as a &quot;disgrace to the county. It could hardly be in a worse condition... and should be repaired immediately.&quot; On October 21, 1885, the county Board of Supervisors agreed to a realignment of the Julian road, in what was known as the Bernardo District, onto private property. The road was described in 1890 by &quot;The San Diego Union and Daily Bee&quot; as passing through farms, and the grade was &quot;cut on the west side of the canyon and buttressed with granite the greater part of the way.&quot; The route continued towards Ramona through vineyards, passing by more boulders.

Between 1885 and 1891, the San Diego, Cuyamaca, and Eastern Railroad was extended from San Diego through El Cajon to the town of Foster, northeast of Lakeside. In 1896, the stagecoach line connected the terminus of the railroad line in Foster to Julian, and transported the San Diego newspapers to Ramona by 2:30 pm each day. The county began to survey a new routing of the Julian road in 1913 cutting through the El Monte Ranch, reducing the distance from San Diego to Julian by and removing some steep grades.

Bidding was conducted on the Julian road, then known as Road No. 3A, on June 30, 1920; however, progress on the grading of the road fell behind the county engineer&#x27;s expectations by October, with only of the road complete. The road was paved from Santee to El Cajon by the end of 1920. Between Foster and Julian, the paved road was opened in July 1922, at a cost of $550,000 (about $ in dollars). The &quot;Ramona Road&quot; remained unpaved between the Mussey Grade and the road to Ballena, a distance of , and the estimated cost of paving it was $400,000 (about $ in dollars). In 1925, there were left of unpaved road between Ramona and Julian, and state and county taxes were to be used to fund this project. The Mussey Grade was completed in April 1925, marking the completion of the paved road between San Diego and Ramona.

San Diego County declared the Julian road a county boulevard in 1926, meaning that vehicles were required to stop before entering the highway. The road that would become SR 67 was added to the state highway system in 1933, from El Cajon to near Santa Ysabel, and was designated as Route 198 in 1935. It consisted of Maine and Woodside avenues in Lakeside and Magnolia Avenue in the city of El Cajon all the way to U.S. Route 80 (US 80) at Main Street. Because of the construction of San Vicente Reservoir north of Lakeside, a section of the road had to be submerged, and it was decided to relocate the road further west by the foot of Mount Woodson. The road was allocated $830,784 in funding (about $ in dollars) to be realigned, widened, and repaved between Lakeside and Mount Woodson in 1942. Grading and paving of the part was scheduled for completion on December 15, 1943.

Funding was allocated for traffic signals on the portion between Main Street and Broadway in El Cajon in 1954. Route 198 also extended onto La Mesa Boulevard and Palm Avenue to SR 94. This portion was signed as Sign Route 67 by 1962, from Campo Road to US 80. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, Route 198 was renumbered as State Route 67; the portion south of I-8 was renumbered as SR 125.

===Freeway construction===
The State Highway Commission decided to reroute SR 67 through Lakeside in 1954, moving it closer to the San Diego River and away from the city center, using the land formerly occupied by the old railroad. In 1961, the construction of the San Vicente Freeway was listed as a high-priority project by the California Chamber of Commerce. During 1964, the county of San Diego received $1 million (about $ in dollars) to construct SR 67 as a freeway from Pepper Drive to Broadway in the city of El Cajon. Another $1 million (about $ in dollars) was allocated in 1965, and the project was extended to I-8. The freeway from I-8 to Pepper Drive was complete by 1967, when Caltrans announced that &quot;yellow, non-reflectorized markers interspersed with raised yellow dots&quot; would be installed on the freeway portion to delineate the shoulder; this was the first section to use them in the county. By December 1968, the freeway was complete from I-8 north to Woodside Avenue; the grade at the northern end was smoothed out during the widening of the road in early 1970. In March, the freeway was under construction from Woodside Avenue to the San Diego River, at a cost of $3.2 million (about $ in dollars). The freeway portion opened on October 12, 1970; it was constructed four lanes wide.

It was planned that SR 67 would be the eastern terminus of SR 56. On December 30, 1980, the City of Poway included SR 56 in the city plan extending east through the city to a northern extension of SR 125. In 1983, both the cities of San Diego and Poway supported the extension of SR 56 to SR 67, although the City of Poway wanted the route moved and had reservations about the freeway ending in the city. There are no plans to construct the portion of SR 56 east of I-15. Several arterial roads connect the eastern end of the SR 56 freeway with SR 67, including Ted Williams Parkway, Twin Peaks Road, Espola Road (CR S5), and Poway Road (CR S4).

===Safety concerns===
The highway portion of SR 67 was commonly known as &quot;Slaughterhouse Alley&quot; because of the high number of fatal accidents. The road was widened in 1979 to add a shoulder and passing lane between the north end of the freeway and Poway Road. During the construction, there were concerns about speeding cars putting the construction workers in danger. The total cost was $927,000 (about $ in dollars), and Asphalt Inc. performed the work.

The reputation of the highway continued into the early years of the 21st century. In 2000, a $1 million project (about $ in dollars) was authorized to widen the shoulders of the road, after there were 413 accidents and 15 fatalities on SR 67 from 1996 to 1999. At this time, County Supervisor Dianne Jacob proposed expanding the highway portion to four lanes along the entire route. Following a safety initiative, including the involvement of law enforcement and trucking companies, accidents and fatalities both decreased by the end of 2001. Accidents continued, however, and by November 2008, electronic signs were installed to inform motorists of their speed, and another publicity campaign had been launched. The reduction from two lanes to one lane heading southbound just after a curve has been blamed for at least some of the accidents, with collisions resulting from cars &quot;jockeying&quot; to be ahead. Head-on collisions are another source of crashes. Despite this, in 2009 Caltrans did not view the road as unsafe according to official metrics.

In May 2009, the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) announced that fixing SR 67 was number 17 on its priority list, resulting in an estimated 2030 completion of a four-lane highway that would not be limited-access. A month later, Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol agreed to take more efforts to educate the public about the safety issues. Signs were installed in 2010 to encourage drivers to practice safe driving habits; from January 2007 to early December 2010, twenty-four people died from accidents on SR 67. Following a March 2009 fatal crash, some of the survivors filed a lawsuit against Caltrans for negligence in maintaining and designing the highway, but the suit was decided in favor of the department. In a 2010 report, Caltrans suggested that two lanes could be added along the highway from I-8 to Dye Road in order to improve traffic flow.

===Further developments===
In 1983, the Kassler Corporation was awarded a contract to renovate the interchange with I-8 for $9.1 million (about $ in dollars). SR 67 from Poway Road to the Poway city limits was proposed to be widened in 1985. There was a movement in 1987 to construct a northbound offramp at Woodside Avenue, due to traffic congestion at the Prospect Avenue offramp; however, it was never built. Call boxes were installed on SR 67 in 1994.

There was also a proposal in 2000 to renovate the interchange at Bradley Avenue. The next year, SANDAG approved the construction of a southern bypass of Ramona and widening from Vigilante Road to Dye Road for a cost of $200 million as part of a 2030 transportation plan. The chairman of the Ramona Planning Group suggested calming traffic by using a roundabout instead of widening the highway.

The road&#x27;s guardrails and signs sustained damage in the 2003 Cedar Fire. That year, there were plans to widen Route 67 from Mapleview Street to Dye Road; however, when threatened with a lawsuit from Save Our Forests and Ranchlands, SANDAG agreed to &quot;reconsider&quot; the project. Traffic jams were prevalent on October 21 and 22 in 2007, during the ongoing local wildfires and the evacuation of Ramona on the narrow road.

&quot;Heavy construction&quot; of SR 52 from SR 125 eastward to SR 67 began in February 2008, after it had been delayed by funding issues that were finally resolved in 2006 with voter-approved statewide transportation bonds. The interchange with SR 52 began construction in mid-June 2008. Completion was scheduled for 2010, but was delayed to early 2011 due to weather-related delays. This new interchange opened to traffic on March 29, 2011. The cost of this project was $525 million, funded with state and federal funds as well as TransNet county sales tax revenue.

<doc id="924166" wikidata="Q17898" url="?curid=924166" title="LGBTQ rights by country or territory">
<text>Rights affecting lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) people vary greatly by country or jurisdiction—encompassing everything from the legal recognition of same-sex marriage to the death penalty for homosexuality.

Notably, , 38 countries recognize same-sex marriage. By contrast, not counting non-state actors and extrajudicial killings, only two countries are believed to impose the death penalty on consensual same-sex sexual acts: Iran and Afghanistan. The death penalty is officially law, but generally not practiced, in Mauritania, Saudi Arabia, Somalia (in the autonomous state of Jubaland) and the United Arab Emirates. LGBT people also face extrajudicial killings in the Russian region of Chechnya. Sudan rescinded its unenforced death penalty for anal sex (hetero- or homosexual) in 2020. Fifteen countries have stoning on the books as a penalty for adultery, which (in light of the illegality of gay marriage in those countries) would by default include gay sex, but this is enforced by the legal authorities in Iran and Nigeria (in the northern third of the country).

In 2011, the United Nations Human Rights Council passed its first resolution recognizing LGBT rights, following which the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights issued a report documenting violations of the rights of LGBT people, including hate crimes, criminalization of homosexual activity, and discrimination. Following the issuance of the report, the United Nations urged all countries which had not yet done so to enact laws protecting basic LGBT rights. A 2022 study found that LGBT rights (as measured by ILGA-Europe&#x27;s Rainbow Index) were correlated with less HIV/AIDS incidence among gay and bisexual men independently of risky sexual behavior.

The 2023 &quot;Equaldex Equality Index&quot; ranks the Nordic countries, Chile, Uruguay, Canada, the Benelux countries, Spain, Andorra, and Malta among the best for LGBT rights. The index ranks Nigeria, Yemen, Brunei, Afghanistan, Somalia, Mauritania, Palestine, and Iran among the worst. Asher &amp; Lyric ranked Canada, Sweden, and the Netherlands as the three safest nations for LGBT people in its 2023 index.

==Scope of laws==
Laws that affect LGBT people include, but are not limited to, the following:

* laws concerning the recognition of same-sex relationships, including same-sex marriage, civil unions, and domestic partnerships
* laws concerning same-sex parenting, including same-sex adoption
* anti-discrimination laws in employment, housing, education, public accommodations
* anti-bullying legislation to protect LGBT children at school
* hate crime laws imposing enhanced criminal penalties for prejudice-motivated violence against LGBT people
* bathroom bills affecting access to sex-segregated facilities by transgender people
* laws related to sexual orientation and military service
* laws concerning access to assisted reproductive technology
* sodomy laws that penalize consensual same-sex sexual activity. These may or may not target homosexuals, males or males and females, or leave some homosexual acts legal.
* adultery laws that same-sex couples are subject to
* age of consent laws that may impose higher ages for same-sex sexual activity
* laws regarding donation of blood, corneas, and other tissues by men who have sex with men
* laws concerning access to gender-affirming surgery and gender-affirming hormone replacement therapy
* legal recognition and accommodation of the affirmed gender.

==History of LGBT-related laws==
===Ancient India===

Ayoni or non-vaginal sex of all types is punishable in the Arthashastra. Homosexual acts are, however, treated as a smaller offence punishable by a fine, while unlawful heterosexual sex carries much harsher punishment. The Dharmsastras, especially the later ones, prescribe against non-vaginal sex like the Vashistha Dharmasutra. The Yājñavalkya Smṛti prescribes fines for such acts including those with other men. Manusmriti prescribes light punishments for such acts. Vanita states that the verses about punishment for a sex between female and a maiden is due to its strong emphasis on a maiden&#x27;s sexual purity.

===Ancient Israel===
The ancient Law of Moses (the Torah) forbids people from lying with people of the same sex (i.e., from having intercourse) in Leviticus 18 and gives a story of attempted homosexual rape in Genesis 19, in the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, after which the cities were soon destroyed with &quot;brimstone and fire, from the Lord&quot; and the death penalty was prescribed to its inhabitants – and to Lot&#x27;s wife, who was turned into a pillar of salt because she turned back to watch the cities&#x27; destruction. In Deuteronomy 22:5, cross-dressing is condemned as &quot;abominable&quot;.

===Assyria===
In Assyrian society, sex crimes were punished identically whether they were homosexual or heterosexual. An individual faced no punishment for penetrating someone of equal social class, a cult prostitute, or with someone whose gender roles were not considered solidly masculine. Such sexual relations were even seen as good fortune, with an Akkadian tablet, the &quot;Šumma ālu&quot;, reading, &quot;If a man copulates with his equal from the rear, he becomes the leader among his peers and brothers&quot;. However, homosexual relationships with fellow soldiers, slaves, royal attendants, or those where a social better was submissive or penetrated, were treated as bad omens.

Middle Assyrian Law Codes dating 1075 BC has a particularly harsh law for homosexuality in the military, which reads: &quot;If a man have intercourse with his brother-in-arms, they shall turn him into a eunuch.&quot; A similar law code reads, &quot;If a seignior lay with his neighbor, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall lie with him (and) turn him into a eunuch&quot;. This law code condemns a situation that involves homosexual rape. Any Assyrian male could visit a prostitute or lie with another male, just as long as false rumors or forced sex were not involved with another male.

===Ancient Rome===

In ancient Rome, the bodies of citizen youths were strictly off-limits, and the &quot;Lex Scantinia&quot; imposed penalties on those who committed a sex crime &quot;(stuprum)&quot; against a freeborn male minor. Acceptable same-sex partners were males excluded from legal protections as citizens: slaves, male prostitutes, and the &quot;infames&quot;, entertainers or others who might be technically free but whose lifestyles set them outside the law.

A male citizen who willingly performed oral sex or received anal sex was disparaged, but there is only limited evidence of legal penalties against these men. In courtroom and political rhetoric, charges of effeminacy and passive sexual behaviors were directed particularly at &quot;democratic&quot; politicians &quot;(populares)&quot; such as Julius Caesar and Mark Antony.

Roman law addressed the rape of a male citizen as early as the 2nd century BC when it was ruled that even a man who was &quot;disreputable and questionable&quot; had the same right as other citizens not to have his body subjected to forced sex. A law probably dating to the dictatorship of Julius Caesar defined rape as forced sex against &quot;boy, woman, or anyone&quot;; the rapist was subject to execution, a rare penalty in Roman law. A male classified as &quot;infamis&quot;, such as a prostitute or actor, could not as a matter of law be raped, nor could a slave, who was legally classified as property; the slave&#x27;s owner, however, could prosecute the rapist for property damage.

In the Roman army of the Republic, sex among fellow soldiers violated the decorum against intercourse with citizens and was subject to harsh penalties, including death, as a violation of military discipline. The Greek historian Polybius (2nd century BC) lists deserters, thieves, perjurers, and &quot;...on young men who have abused their persons&quot; as subject to the &quot;fustuarium&quot;, clubbing to death. Ancient sources are most concerned with the effects of sexual harassment by officers, but the young soldier who brought an accusation against his superior needed to show that he had not willingly taken the passive role or prostituted himself. Soldiers were free to have relations with their male slaves; the use of a fellow citizen-soldier&#x27;s body was prohibited, not homosexual behaviors per se. By the late Republic and throughout the Imperial period, there is increasing evidence that men whose lifestyle marked them as &quot;homosexual&quot; in the modern sense served openly.

Although Roman law did not recognize marriage between men, and in general Romans regarded marriage as a heterosexual union with the primary purpose of producing children, in the early Imperial period some male couples were celebrating traditional marriage rites. Juvenal remarks with disapproval that his friends often attended such ceremonies. The emperor Nero had two marriages to men, once as the bride (with a freedman Pythagoras) and once as the groom. His consort Sporus appeared in public as Nero&#x27;s wife wearing the regalia that was customary for the Roman empress.

Apart from measures to protect the prerogatives of citizens, the prosecution of homosexuality as a general crime began in the 3rd century of the Christian era when male prostitution was banned by Philip the Arab. By the end of the 4th century, after the Roman Empire had come under Christian rule, passive homosexuality was punishable by burning. &quot;Death by sword&quot; was the punishment for a &quot;man coupling like a woman&quot; under the Theodosian Code. Under Justinian, all same-sex acts, passive or active, no matter who the partners are, were declared contrary to nature and punishable by death.

===British Empire===
The United Kingdom introduced anti-homosexuality laws throughout its colonies, particularly in the 19th century when the British Empire was at its peak. As of 2018, more than half of the 71 countries that criminalised homosexuality were former British colonies or protectorates.

===Netherlands===

In 2001, the Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage.

Note that for simplicity the table below does not distinguish between &#x27;legal&#x27; and &#x27;lawful&#x27;. An action can only be legal or illegal where a specific law has been passed.

<text>Panama elects on national level a head of state, i.e. the president, and a legislature. The president and the vice-president are elected on one ballot for a five-year term by the people. The National Assembly (&quot;Asamblea Nacional&quot;) has 71 members, elected for a five-year term in single-seat and multi-seat constituencies.

== Political culture ==
Panama has a multi-party system, with numerous parties in which no one party often has a chance of gaining power alone, and parties must work with each other to form coalition governments.

<text>Elections in the United States are held for government officials at the federal, state, and local levels. At the federal level, the nation&#x27;s head of state, the president, is elected indirectly by the people of each state, through an Electoral College. Today, these electors almost always vote with the popular vote of their state. All members of the federal legislature, the Congress, are directly elected by the people of each state. There are many elected offices at state level, each state having at least an elective governor and legislature. There are also elected offices at the local level, in counties, cities, towns, townships, boroughs, and villages; as well as for special districts and school districts which may transcend county and municipal boundaries.

The country&#x27;s election system is highly decentralized. While the U.S. Constitution does set parameters for the election of federal officials, state law, not federal, regulates most aspects of elections in the U.S., including primary elections, the eligibility of voters (beyond the basic constitutional definition), the method of choosing presidential electors, as well as the running of state and local elections. All elections—federal, state, and local—are administered by the individual states, with many aspects of the system&#x27;s operations delegated to the county or local level.

Under federal law, the general elections of the president and Congress occur on Election Day, the Tuesday after the first Monday of November. These federal general elections are held in even-numbered years, with presidential elections occurring every four years, and congressional elections occurring every two years. The general elections that are held two years after the presidential ones are referred to as the midterm elections. General elections for state and local offices are held at the discretion of the individual state and local governments, with many of these races coinciding with either presidential or midterm elections as a matter of convenience and cost saving, while other state and local races may occur during odd-numbered &quot;off years&quot;. The date when primary elections for federal, state, and local races occur are also at the discretion of the individual state and local governments; presidential primaries in particular have historically been staggered between the states, beginning sometime in January or February, and ending about mid-June before the November general election.

The restriction and extension of voting rights to different groups has been a contested process throughout United States history. The federal government has also been involved in attempts to increase voter turnout, by measures such as the National Voter Registration Act of 1993. The financing of elections has also long been controversial, because private sources make up substantial amounts of campaign contributions, especially in federal elections. Voluntary public funding for candidates willing to accept spending limits was introduced in 1974 for presidential primaries and elections. The Federal Election Commission, created in 1975 by an amendment to the Federal Election Campaign Act, has the responsibility to disclose campaign finance information, to enforce the provisions of the law such as the limits and prohibitions on contributions, and to oversee the public funding of U.S. presidential elections.

Voting in the United States is currently voluntary only at the federal, state and local levels. Efforts to make voting mandatory have been proposed.

==Voting==
===Voting methods===
A number of voting methods are used within the various jurisdictions in the United States, the most common of which is the first-past-the-post system, where the highest-polling candidate wins the election. Under this system, a candidate who achieves a plurality (that is, the most) of vote wins. The State of Georgia uses a two-round system, where if no candidate receives a majority of votes, then there is a runoff between the two highest polling candidates.

Since 2002, several cities have adopted instant-runoff voting. Voters rank the candidates in order of preference rather than voting for a single candidate. Under this system, if no candidate achieves more than half of votes cast, then the lowest polling candidate is eliminated, and their votes are distributed to the next preferred candidates. This process continues until one candidate achieves more than half the votes. In 2016, Maine became the first state to adopt instant-runoff voting (known in the state as ranked-choice voting) statewide for its elections, although due to state constitutional provisions, the system is only used for federal elections and state primaries.

===Eligibility===
The eligibility of an individual for voting is set out in the constitution and also regulated at state level. The constitution states that suffrage cannot be denied on grounds of race or color, sex, or age for citizens eighteen years or older. Beyond these basic qualifications, it is the responsibility of state legislatures to regulate voter eligibility. Some states ban convicted criminals, especially felons, from voting for a fixed period of time or indefinitely. The number of American adults who are currently or permanently ineligible to vote due to felony convictions is estimated to be 5.3 million. Some states also have legacy constitutional statements barring those legally declared incompetent from voting; such references are generally considered obsolete and are being considered for review or removal where they appear.

About 4.3 million American citizens that reside in Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories do not have the same level of federal representation as those that reside in the 50 U.S. states. These areas only have non-voting members in the U.S. House of Representatives and no representation in the U.S. Senate. Citizens in the U.S. territories are also not represented in the Electoral College and therefore cannot vote for the president. Those in Washington, D.C. are permitted to vote for the president because of the Twenty-third Amendment.

===Voter registration===

While the federal government has jurisdiction over federal elections, most election laws are decided at the state level. All U.S. states except North Dakota require that citizens who wish to vote be registered. In many states, voter registration takes place at the county or municipal level. Traditionally, voters had to register directly at state or local offices to vote, but in the mid-1990s, efforts were made by the federal government to make registering easier, in an attempt to increase turnout. The National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (the &quot;Motor Voter&quot; law) required state governments that receive certain types of federal funding to make the voter registration process easier by providing uniform registration services through drivers&#x27; license registration centers, disability centers, schools, libraries, and mail-in registration. Other states allow citizens same-day registration on Election Day.

An estimated 50 million Americans are unregistered. It has been reported that registering to vote poses greater obstacles for low-income citizens, racial minorities and linguistic minorities, Native Americans, and persons with disabilities. International election observers have called on authorities in the U.S. to implement measures to remediate the high number of unregistered citizens.

In many states, citizens registering to vote may declare an affiliation with a political party. This declaration of affiliation does not cost money, and does not make the citizen a dues-paying member of a party. A party cannot prevent a voter from declaring his or her affiliation with them, but it can refuse requests for full membership. In some states, only voters affiliated with a party may vote in that party&#x27;s primary elections (see below). Declaring a party affiliation is never required. Some states, including Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Washington, practice non-partisan registration.

==== Noncitizen voting ====
Federal law prohibits noncitizens from voting in federal elections. 

As of 2024, 7 state constitutions specifically state that &quot;only&quot; a citizen can vote in elections at any level in that state: Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Louisiana, North Dakota, and Ohio.

===Voter ID laws ===

Voter ID laws in the United States are laws that require a person to provide some form of official identification before they are permitted to register to vote, receive a ballot for an election, or to actually vote in elections in the United States.

Proponents of voter ID laws argue that they reduce electoral fraud while placing only little burden on voters. Critics worry the costs to voters without IDs will outweigh unclear benefits it would have on real or perceived fraud.

===Absentee and mail voting===

Voters unable or unwilling to vote at polling stations on Election Day may vote via absentee ballots, depending on state law. Originally these ballots were for people who could not go to the polling place on election day. Now some states let them be used for convenience, but state laws still call them absentee ballots. Absentee ballots can be sent and returned by mail, or requested and submitted in person, or dropped off in locked boxes. About half the states and territories allow &quot;no excuse absentee,&quot; where no reason is required to request an absentee ballot; others require a valid reason, such as infirmity or travel. Some states let voters with permanent disabilities apply for permanent absentee voter status, and some other states let all citizens apply for permanent status, so they will automatically receive an absentee ballot for each election. Otherwise a voter must request an absentee ballot before the election occurs.

In Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington state, all ballots are delivered through the mail; in many other states there are counties or certain small elections where everyone votes by mail.

As of July 2020, 26 states allow designated agents to collect and submit ballots on behalf of another voter, whose identities are specified on a signed application. Usually such agents are family members or persons from the same residence. 13 states neither enable nor prohibit ballot collection as a matter of law. Among those that allow it, 12 have limits on how many ballots an agent may collect.

Americans living outside the United States, including active duty members of the armed forces stationed outside of their state of residency, may register and vote under the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act (UOCAVA). Almost half the states require these ballots to be returned by mail. Other states allow mail along with some combination of fax, or email; four states allow a web portal.

A significant measure to prevent some types of fraud has been to require the voter&#x27;s signature on the outer envelope, which is compared to one or more signatures on file before taking the ballot out of the envelope and counting it.
Not all states have standards for signature review. There have been concerns that signatures are improperly rejected from young and minority voters at higher rates than others, with no or limited ability of voters to appeal the rejection. For other types of errors, experts estimate that while there is more fraud with absentee ballots than in-person voting, it has affected only a few local elections.

Following the 2020 United States presidential election, amidst disputes of its outcome, as a rationale behind litigation demanding a halt to official vote counting in some areas, allegations were made that vote counting is offshored. Former Trump Administration official Chris Krebs, head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) during the election, said in a December 2020 interview that, &quot;All votes in the United States of America are counted in the United States of America.&quot;

One documented trend is that in-person votes and early votes are more likely to lean to the Republican Party, while the provisional ballots, which are counted later, trend to the Democratic Party. This phenomenon is known as blue shift, and has led to situations where Republicans were winning on election night only to be overtaken by Democrats after all votes were counted. Foley did not find that mail-in or absentee votes favored either party.

===Early voting===

Early voting is a formal process where voters can cast their ballots prior to the official Election Day. Early voting in person is allowed in 47 states and in Washington, D.C., with no excuse required. Only Alabama, New Hampshire and Oregon do not allow early voting, while some counties in Idaho do not allow it.

===Voting equipment===
The earliest voting in the US was through paper ballots that were hand-counted. By the late 1800s, paper ballots printed by election officials were nearly universal. By 1980, 10% of American voters used paper ballots that were counted by hand, which dropped below 1% by 2008.

Mechanical voting machines were first used in the US in the 1892 elections in Lockport, New York. The state of Massachusetts was one of the first states to adopt lever voting machines, doing so in 1899, but the state&#x27;s Supreme Judicial Court ruled their usage unconstitutional in 1907. Lever machines grew in popularity despite controversies, with about two-thirds of votes for president in the 1964 United States presidential election cast with lever machines. Lever machine use declined to about 40% of votes in 1980, then 6% in 2008. Punch card voting equipment was developed in the 1960s, with about one-third of votes cast with punch cards in 1980. New York was the last state to phase out lever voting in response to the 2000 Help America Vote Act (HAVA), which allocated funds for the replacement of lever machine and punch card voting equipment. New York replaced its lever voting with optical scanning in 2010.

In the 1960s, technology was developed that enabled paper ballots filled with pencil or ink to be optically scanned rather than hand-counted. In 1980, about 2% of votes used optical scanning; this increased to 30% by 2000 and 60% by 2008. In the 1970s, the final major voting technology for the US was developed, the DRE voting machine. In 1980, less than 1% of ballots were cast with DRE. Prevalence grew to 10% in 2000, then peaked at 38% in 2006. Because DREs are fully digital, with no paper trail of votes, backlash against them caused prevalence to drop to 33% in 2010.

The voting equipment used by a given US county is related to the county&#x27;s historical wealth. A county&#x27;s use of punch cards in the year 2000 was positively correlated with the county&#x27;s wealth in 1969, when punch card machines were at their peak of popularity. Counties with higher wealth in 1989 were less likely to still use punch cards in 2000. This supports the idea that punch cards were used in counties that were well-off in the 1960s, but whose wealth declined in the proceeding decades. Counties that maintained their wealth from the 1960s onwards could afford to replace punch card machines as they fell out of favor.

==Levels of election==
===Federal elections===

The United States has a presidential system of government, which means that the executive and legislature are elected separately. Article II of the United States Constitution requires that the election of the U.S. president by the Electoral College must occur on a single day throughout the country; Article I established that elections for Congressional offices, however, can be held at different times. Congressional and presidential elections take place simultaneously every four years, and the intervening Congressional elections, which take place every two years, are called midterm elections.

The constitution states that members of the United States House of Representatives must be at least 25 years old, a citizen of the United States for at least seven years, and be a (legal) inhabitant of the state they represent. Senators must be at least 30 years old, a citizen of the United States for at least nine years, and be a (legal) inhabitant of the state they represent. The president and vice president must be at least 35 years old, a natural born citizen of the United States, and a resident in the United States for at least fourteen years. It is the responsibility of state legislatures to regulate the qualifications for a candidate appearing on a ballot paper, although in order to get onto the ballot, a candidate must often collect a legally defined number of signatures or meet other state-specific requirements.

====Presidential elections====

The president and the vice president are elected together in a presidential election. It is an indirect election, with the winner being determined by votes cast by electors of the Electoral College. In modern times, voters in each state select a slate of electors from a list of several slates designated by different parties or candidates, and the electors typically promise in advance to vote for the candidates of their party (whose names of the presidential candidates usually appear on the ballot rather than those of the individual electors). The winner of the election is the candidate with at least 270 Electoral College votes. It is possible for a candidate to win the electoral vote, and lose the (nationwide) popular vote (receive fewer votes nationwide than the second ranked candidate). This has occurred five times in US history: in 1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, and 2016. Prior to ratification of the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution (1804), the runner-up in a presidential election became the vice president.

Electoral College votes are cast by individual states by a group of electors; each elector casts one electoral college vote. Until the Twenty-third Amendment to the United States Constitution of 1961, citizens from the District of Columbia did not have representation in the electoral college. In modern times, with electors usually committed to vote for a party candidate in advance, electors that vote against the popular vote in their state are called faithless electors, and occurrences are rare. State law regulates how states cast their electoral college votes. In all states except Maine and Nebraska, the candidate that wins the most votes in the state receives all its electoral college votes (a &quot;winner takes all&quot; system). From 1972 in Maine, and from 1996 in Nebraska, two electoral votes are awarded based on the winner of the statewide election, and the rest (two in Maine and three in Nebraska) go to the highest vote-winner in each of the state&#x27;s congressional districts.

====Congressional elections====
Congress has two chambers: the Senate and the House of Representatives.

=====Senate elections=====
The Senate has 100 members, elected for a six-year term in dual-seat constituencies (2 from each state), with one-third being renewed every two years. The group of the Senate seats that is up for election during a given year is known as a &quot;class&quot;; the three classes are staggered so that only one of the three groups is renewed every two years. Until the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution in 1913, states chose how to elect Senators, and they were often elected by state legislatures, not the electorate of states.
=====House of Representatives elections=====
The House of Representatives has 435 members, elected for a two-year term in single-seat constituencies. House of Representatives elections are held every two years on the first Tuesday after November 1 in even years. Special House elections can occur between if a member dies or resigns during a term. House elections are first-past-the-post elections that elect a Representative from each of 435 House districts that cover the United States. The non-voting delegates of Washington, D.C., and the territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands are also elected.

House elections occur every two years, correlated with presidential elections or halfway through a president&#x27;s term. The House delegate of Puerto Rico, officially known as the resident commissioner of Puerto Rico, is elected to a four-year term, coinciding with those of the President.

As the redistricting commissions of states are often partisan, districts are often drawn which benefit incumbents. An increasing trend has been for incumbents to have an overwhelming advantage in House elections, and since the 1994 election, an unusually low number of seats has changed hands in each election. Due to gerrymandering, fewer than 10% of all House seats are contested in each election cycle. Over 90% of House members are reelected every two years, due to lack of electoral competition. Gerrymandering of the House, combined with the general deficiencies of the first-past-the-post voting system, and divisions inherent in the design of the Senate and of the Electoral College, result in a discrepancy between the percentage of popular support for various political parties and the actual level of the parties&#x27; representation. In particular, gerrymandering has been found to benefit the Republican Party more than it does the Democratic Party.
===State elections===
State law and state constitutions, controlled by state legislatures regulate elections at state level and local level. Various officials at state level are elected. Since the separation of powers applies to states as well as the federal government, state legislatures and the executive (the governor) are elected separately. Governors and lieutenant governors are elected in all states, in some states on a joint ticket and in some states separately, some separately in different electoral cycles. The governors of the territories of American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands are also elected. In some states, executive positions such as Attorney General and Secretary of State are also elected offices. All members of state legislatures and territorial jurisdiction legislatures are elected. In some states, members of the state supreme court and other members of the state judiciary are elected. Proposals to amend the state constitution are also placed on the ballot in some states.

As a matter of convenience and cost saving, elections for many of these state and local offices are held at the same time as either the federal presidential or midterm elections. There are a handful of states, however, that instead hold their elections during odd-numbered &quot;off years.&quot;
===Local elections===
At the local level, county and city government positions are usually filled by election, especially within the legislative branch. The extent to which offices in the executive or judicial branches are elected vary from county-to-county or city-to-city. Some examples of local elected positions include sheriffs at the county level and mayors and school board members at the city level. Like state elections, an election for a specific local office may be held at the same time as either the presidential, midterm, or off-year elections.

===Tribal elections===
Many Native American tribal governmental positions, including executive and legislative positions, are typically filled by election. In some cases, tribal citizens elect council members who elect from among their body a chief executive. The number of positions and titles used vary from one tribal government to another, but common titles for the tribal government&#x27;s chief executive terms include president, governor, principal chief, chair, and chief. These elections may be held in conjunction with federal, state, or local elections, but are often held independently under the authority of the tribe&#x27;s office of elections.

==Comparison of recent and upcoming election years==
==Features of the election system==
===Multiple levels of regulation===
In the US, elections are actually conducted by local authorities, working under local, state, and federal law and regulation, as well as the US Constitution. It is a highly decentralized system.

In around half of US states, the secretary of state is the official in charge of elections; in other states it is someone appointed for the job, or a commission. It is this person or commission who is responsible for certifying, tabulating, and reporting votes for the state.

===Party systems===

Americans vote for a specific candidate instead of directly selecting a particular political party. The United States Constitution has never formally addressed the issue of political parties. The Founding Fathers such as Alexander Hamilton and James Madison did not support domestic political factions at the time the Constitution was written. In addition, the first president of the United States, George Washington, was not a member of any political party at the time of his election or throughout his tenure as president. Furthermore, he hoped that political parties would not be formed, fearing conflict and stagnation. Nevertheless, the beginnings of the American two-party system emerged from his immediate circle of advisers, with Hamilton and Madison ending up being the core leaders in this emerging party system. Due to Duverger&#x27;s law, the two-party system continued following the creation of political parties, as the first-past-the-post electoral system was kept.

Candidates decide to run under a party label, register to run, pay filing fees, etc. In the primary elections, the party organization stays neutral until one candidate has been elected. The platform of the party is written by the winning candidate (in presidential elections; in other elections no platform is involved). Candidates formally manage the campaign and fund raising organization independent of the party. The primary elections in the main parties are organized by the states, who also register the party affiliation of the voters (this also makes it easier to gerrymander the congressional districts). The party is thus little more than a campaign organization for the main elections.

However, elections in the United States often do become &quot;de facto&quot; national races between the political parties. In what is known as &quot;presidential coattails&quot;, candidates in presidential elections usually bring out supporters who then vote for his or her party&#x27;s candidates for other offices, usually resulting in the presidential winner&#x27;s party gaining seats in Congress. On the other hand, midterm elections are sometimes regarded as a referendum on the sitting president or incumbent party&#x27;s performance.

===Ballot access===

Ballot access refers to the laws which regulate under what conditions access is granted for a candidate or political party to appear on voters&#x27; ballots. Each state has its own ballot access laws to determine who may appear on ballots and who may not. According to Article I, Section 4, of the United States Constitution, the authority to regulate the time, place, and manner of federal elections is up to each State, unless Congress legislates otherwise. Depending on the office and the state, it may be possible for a voter to cast a write-in vote for a candidate whose name does not appear on the ballot, but it is extremely rare for such a candidate to win office.

===Campaign finance===

The funding of electoral campaigns has always been a controversial issue in American politics. Infringement of free speech (First Amendment) is an argument against restrictions on campaign contributions, while allegations of corruption arising from unlimited contributions and the need for political equality are arguments for the other side. Private funds are a major source of finance, from individuals and organizations. The first attempt to regulate campaign finance by legislation was in 1867, but major legislation, with the intention to widely enforce, on campaign finance was not introduced until the 1970s.

Money contributed to campaigns can be classified into &quot;hard money&quot; and &quot;soft money&quot;. Hard money is money contributed directly to a campaign, by an individual or organization. Soft money is money from an individual or organization not contributed to a campaign, but spent in candidate specific advertising or other efforts that benefits that candidate by groups supporting the candidate, but legally not coordinated by the official campaign.

The Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 required candidates to disclose sources of campaign contributions and campaign expenditure. It was amended in 1974 to legally limit campaign contributions. It banned direct contributing to campaigns by corporations and trade unions and limited individual donations to $1,000 per campaign. It introduced public funding for presidential primaries and elections. The Act also placed limits of $5,000 per campaign on PACs (political action committees). The limits on individual contributions and prohibition of direct corporate or labor union campaigns led to a huge increase in the number of PACs. Today many labor unions and corporations have their own PACs, and over 4,000 in total exist. The 1974 amendment also specified a Federal Election Commission, created in 1975 to administer and enforce campaign finance law. Various other provisions were also included, such as a ban on contributions or expenditures by foreign nationals (incorporated from the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) (1966)).

The case of &quot;Buckley v. Valeo&quot; (1976) challenged the Act. Most provisions were upheld, but the court found that the mandatory spending limit imposed was unconstitutional, as was the limit placed on campaign spending from the candidate&#x27;s personal fortune and the provision that limited independent expenditures by individuals and organizations supporting but not officially linked to a campaign. The effect of the first decision was to allow candidates such as Ross Perot and Steve Forbes to spend enormous amounts of their own money in their own campaigns. The effect of the second decision was to allow the culture of &quot;soft money&quot; to develop.

A 1979 amendment to the Federal Election Campaign Act allowed political parties to spend without limit on get-out-the-vote and voter registration activities conducted primarily for a presidential candidate. Later, they were permitted by FECA to use &quot;soft money&quot;, unregulated, unlimited contributions to fund this effort. Increasingly, the money began to be spent on issue advertising, candidate specific advertising that was being funded mostly by soft money.

The Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 banned local and national parties from spending &quot;soft money&quot; and banned national party committees from accepting or spending soft money. It increased the limit of contributions by individuals from $1,000 to $2,000. It banned corporations or labor unions from funding issue advertising directly, and banned the use of corporate or labor money for advertisements that mention a federal candidate within 60 days of a general election or 30 days of a primary. The constitutionality of the bill was challenged and in December 2003, the Supreme Court upheld most provisions of the legislation. (See &quot;McConnell v. FEC&quot;.)

A large number of &quot;527 groups&quot; were active for the first time in the 2004 election. These groups receive donations from individuals and groups and then spend the money on issue advocacy, such as the anti-Kerry ads by Swift Boat Veterans for Truth. This is a new form of soft money, and not surprisingly it is controversial. Many 527 groups have close links with the Democratic or Republican parties, even though legally they cannot coordinate their activities with them. John McCain, one of the senators behind the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act, and President Bush have both declared a desire to ban 527s.

Changing campaign finance laws is a highly controversial issue. Some reformers wish to see laws changed in order to improve electoral competition and political equality. Opponents wish to see the system stay as it is, whereas other reformers wish even fewer restrictions on the freedom to spend and contribute money. The Supreme Court has made it increasingly difficult for those who wish to regulate election financing, but options like partial public funding of campaigns are still possible and offer the potential to address reformers&#x27; concerns with minimal restrictions on the freedom to contribute.

===Primaries and caucuses===

In partisan elections, candidates are chosen by primary elections (abbreviated to &quot;primaries&quot;) and caucuses in the states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

A primary election is an election in which registered voters in a jurisdiction (&quot;nominating primary&quot;) select a political party&#x27;s candidate for a later election. There are various types of primary: either the whole electorate is eligible, and voters choose one party&#x27;s primary at the polling booth (an open primary); or only independent voters can choose a party&#x27;s primary at the polling booth (a semi-closed primary); or only registered members of the party are allowed to vote (closed primary). The blanket primary, when voters could vote for all parties&#x27; primaries on the same ballot was struck down by the United States Supreme Court as violating the First Amendment guarantee of freedom of assembly in the case California Democratic Party v. Jones. Primaries are also used to select candidates at the state level, for example in gubernatorial elections.

Caucuses also nominate candidates by election, but they are very different from primaries. Caucuses are meetings that occur at precincts and involve discussion of each party&#x27;s platform and issues such as voter turnout in addition to voting. Eleven states: Iowa, New Mexico, North Dakota, Maine, Nevada, Hawaii, Minnesota, Kansas, Alaska, Wyoming, Colorado and the District of Columbia use caucuses, for one or more political parties.

The primary and caucus season in presidential elections lasts from the Iowa caucus in January to the last primaries in June. Front-loading – when larger numbers of contests take place in the opening weeks of the season—can have an effect on the nomination process, potentially reducing the number of realistic candidates, as fund-raisers and donors quickly abandon those they see as untenable. However, it is not the case that the successful candidate is always the candidate that does the best in the early primaries. There is also a period dubbed the &quot;invisible primary&quot; that takes place before the primary season, when candidates attempt to solicit media coverage and funding well before the real primary season begins.

A state&#x27;s presidential primary election or caucus usually is an indirect election: instead of voters directly selecting a particular person running for president, it determines how many delegates each party&#x27;s national political convention will receive from their respective state. These delegates then in turn select their party&#x27;s presidential nominee. Held in the summer, a political convention&#x27;s purpose is also to adopt a statement of the party&#x27;s principles and goals known as the &quot;platform&quot; and adopt the rules for the party&#x27;s activities.

The day on which primaries are held for congressional seats, and state and local offices may also vary between states. The only federally mandated day for elections is Election Day for the general elections of the president and Congress; all other elections are at the discretion of the individual state and local governments.

==Election information on the web==
In most states of the U.S., the chief election officer is the secretary of state. In some states, local officials like a county registrar of voters or supervisor of elections manages the conduct of elections under the supervision of (or in coordination with) the chief election officer of the state. Many of these state and county offices have web sites that provide information to help voters obtain information on their polling places for each election, the various districts to which they belong (e.g., House and Senate districts in the state and federal legislature, school boards, water districts, municipalities, etc.), as well as dates of elections and deadlines to file to run or register to vote. Some allow voters to download a sample ballot in advance of the election.

More systematic coverage is provided by websites devoted specifically to collecting election information and making it available to the public. Two of the better known such sites are Ballotpedia and Vote Smart. These are run by non-profit, non-partisan organizations. They have paid staffs and are much more tightly controlled than Wikipedia.

USElections.com tries to provide similar information but relies on volunteers in a way that is more like Wikipedia than Ballotpedia and Vote Smart.

The website 270towin provides actual electoral college maps (both current and historic) but also the ability to use an interactive map in order to make election predictions. Ongoing election news is reported as well as data on Senate and House races.

OpenSecrets provides election information focusing on campaign finance.

==Criticisms and concerns==
=== Voter suppression and subversion ===
Voting laws and procedures between the states vary as a consequence of the decentralized system, including those pertaining to provisional ballots, postal voting, voter IDs, voter registration, voting machines and vote counting, felony disenfranchisement, and election recounts. Thus the voting rights or voter suppression in one state may be stricter or more lenient than another state. Following the 2020 US presidential election, decentralized administration and inconsistent state voting laws and processes have shown themselves to be targets for voter subversion schemes enabled by appointing politically motivated actors to election administration roles with degrees of freedom to subvert the will of the people. One such scheme would allow these officials to appoint a slate of &quot;alternate electors&quot; to skew operations of the electoral college in favor of a minority party.

=== Vote counting time ===
As detailed in a state-by-state breakdown, the United States has a long-standing tradition of publicly announcing the incomplete, unofficial vote counts on election night (the late evening of election day), and declaring unofficial &quot;projected winners&quot;, despite that many of the mail-in and absentee votes have not been counted yet. In some states, in fact, none of them have yet been counted by that time. This tradition was based on the assumption that the incomplete, unofficial count on election night is &quot;probably&quot; going to match the official count, which is officially finished and certified several weeks later. An intrinsic weakness of this assumption, and of the tradition of premature announcements based on it, is that the public is likely to misapprehend that these particular &quot;projected winning&quot; candidates have &quot;certainly&quot; won before any official vote count has been completed, whereas in fact all that is truly known is that those candidates have some degree of likelihood of having won; the magnitude of the likelihood (all the way from very reliable to not reliable at all) varies by state because the details of election procedures vary by state. This problem affects all non–in-person votes, even those cast weeks before election day—not just late-arriving ones.

=== Election security ===
Attempts by foreign countries to influence the outcome have occurred in some elections.

Allegations of voter impersonation, of which there are only 31 documented cases in the United States from the 2000–2014 period, have led to calls for Voter ID laws in the United States. Notable instances of allegations of stolen elections and election fraud include the 1948 United States Senate election in Texas, in which 202 &quot;patently fraudulent&quot; ballots gave future President Lyndon Johnson a seat in the US Senate and the 2018 North Carolina 9th congressional district election in which ballot tampering was admitted in witness testimony, including filling in blank votes to favor Republican candidates. A poll from April 2023 found that one in five American adults still believed the 2020 election was stolen from Trump, representing little change from 2021.

=== Structural critiques ===
In 2014, scientists from Princeton University did a study on the influence of the so-called &quot;elite&quot;, and their derived power from special interest lobbying, versus the &quot;ordinary&quot; US citizen within the US political system. They found that the US was looking more like an oligarchy than a real representative democracy; &quot;thus eroding a government of the people, by the people, for the people&quot; as stated by Abraham Lincoln in his Gettysburg Address. In fact, the study found that average citizens had an almost nonexistent influence on public policies and that the ordinary citizen had little or no independent influence on policy at all.

Sanford Levinson argues that next to the fact that campaign financing and gerrymandering are seen as serious problems for democracy, also one of the root causes of the American democratic deficit lies in the United States Constitution itself, for example there is a lack of proportional representation in the Senate for highly populated states such as California as all states regardless of population are given two seats in the Senate.

Partisan election officials in the United States can give an appearance of unfairness, even when there are very few issues, especially when an election official like a secretary of state is running for an election they are overseeing. Richard Hasen argued that the United States is the only advanced democracy that lets partisan officials oversee elections, and that switching to a nonpartisan model would improve trust, participation and effectiveness of elections.

The Electoral College has been criticized by some people for being un-democratic (it can choose a candidate who did not win the popular vote) and for encouraging campaigns to only focus on swing states, as well for giving more power to smaller states with less electoral votes as they have a smaller population per electoral vote compared to more populated states. This can be seen through one electoral college vote representing 622,000 voters in California, compared to one electoral college vote representing 195,000 voters in Wyoming. 

The first-past-the-post system has also been criticized for creating a &quot;de facto&quot; pure two-party system (as postulated in Duverger&#x27;s law) that suppresses voices that do not hold views consistent with the largest faction in a particular party, as well as limiting voters&#x27; choices in elections.

<text>Robin Ian MacDonald Dunbar (born 28 June 1947) is a British biological anthropologist, evolutionary psychologist, and specialist in primate behaviour. Dunbar is professor emeritus of evolutionary psychology of the Social and Evolutionary Neuroscience Research Group in the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford. He is best known for formulating Dunbar&#x27;s number, a measurement of the &quot;cognitive limit to the number of individuals with whom any one person can maintain stable relationships&quot;.

==Education==

Dunbar, the son of an engineer, was educated at Magdalen College School, Brackley. He went on to study at Magdalen College, Oxford, where his teachers included Niko Tinbergen; he completed his Bachelor of Arts in Psychology and Philosophy in 1969. Dunbar then went on to the Department of Psychology of the University of Bristol and completed his PhD in 1974 on the social organisation of the gelada, &quot;Theropithecus gelada&quot;, a monkey that is a close relative to baboons.

He spent two years as a freelance science writer. Dunbar told BBC Radio interviewer Jim Al-Khalili in &quot;The Life Scientific&quot; in 2019 that he &quot;got his first real job&quot; only at the age of 40.

==Academic career==
Dunbar&#x27;s academic and research career includes the University of Bristol, University of Cambridge from 1977 until 1982, and University College London from 1987 until 1994. In 1994, Dunbar became Professor of Evolutionary Psychology at the University of Liverpool, but left Liverpool in 2007, to take up the post of Director of the Institute of Cognitive and Evolutionary Anthropology at the University of Oxford. In 2012, Dunbar migrated over to the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford, after receiving a competitive research grant from the European Research Council.

Dunbar was formerly co-director of the British Academy Centenary Research Project (BACRP) &quot;From Lucy to Language: The Archaeology of the Social Brain&quot; and was involved in the BACRP &quot;Identifying the Universal Religious Repertoire&quot;.

Digital versions of selected published articles authored or co-authored by him are available from the University of Liverpool Evolutionary Psychology and Behavioural Ecology Research Group.

In 2015, Dunbar was awarded the Huxley Memorial Medal—established in 1900 in memory of Thomas Henry Huxley—for services to anthropology by the council of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland, the highest honour at the disposal of the RAI. Dunbar is also a Humanists UK Distinguished Supporter of Humanism.

<text>Elections in Venezuela are held at a national level for the President of Venezuela as head of state and head of government, and for a unicameral legislature. The President of Venezuela is elected for a six-year term by direct election plurality voting, and is eligible for re-election. The National Assembly &quot;(Asamblea Nacional)&quot; has 277 members &quot;(diputados)&quot;, elected for five-year terms using a mixed-member majoritarian representation system. Elections also take place at state level and local level.

Since 1998, elections in Venezuela have been automated (using touch-screen DRE voting machines which provide a Voter Verified Paper Audit Trail), and administered by the National Electoral Council. The voting age is 18, and (as of 2011) 95% of eligible voters are legally registered.

Prior to the early 1990s, Venezuela was considered an unusually long-standing and stable liberal democracy in Latin America, having transitioned to democracy in 1958. After the victory of socialist populist Hugo Chávez in the 1998 presidential election, Venezuela gradually underwent democratic backsliding before transitioning to an authoritarian system of government where political and civil rights are not protected, and elections are not free and fair. Under Chávez&#x27;s rule and later under the rule of his successor Nicolás Maduro, power has been concentrated in the hands of the executive, institutional checks and balances have been undermined, independent media have been repressed, and opposition forces have been marginalized in governing institutions, such as congress, courts, oversight agencies, the state-owned petroleum company (PDVSA), and the military.

Politics are polarized between supporters of President Nicolás Maduro, organized as the United Socialist Party (PSUV) and the Great Patriotic Pole, and several opposition parties. Opposition parties and opposition candidates have regularly been banned from contesting elections. At other times, opposition parties have boycotted national elections, citing their undemocratic nature. Venezuela was ranked the third least electoral democracy in Latin America and the Caribbean according to V-Dem Democracy indices in 2023 with a score of 0.214 out of one.

==History==
===1811–1889: First congress and presidents===
On 18 April 1810, agents of the Spanish Regency arrived in the city of Caracas. After considerable political tumult, the local nobility announced an extraordinary open hearing of the &quot;cabildo&quot; (the municipal council) on 19 April. On that day, an expanded municipal government of Caracas took power in the name of Ferdinand VII, calling itself The Supreme Junta to Preserve the Rights of Ferdinand VII. The Caracas Junta called for the convention of a congress of the Venezuelan provinces which began meeting the following March, at which time the Junta dissolved itself. Francisco de Miranda was elected to the Congress and began agitating for independence.

In March 1811 during the Spanish American wars of independence, the first Venezuelan constitutional congress established the executive power a triumvirate in which three men shared executive power and rotated the presidency every week. Cristóbal Mendoza became a member of the triumvirate that headed the First Republic of Venezuela and was unanimously elected by the other two as the first to go in rotation on 5 March 1811. Mendoza was author of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, formally issued on 5 July 1811, on which date the presidential designation also took effect. The first Constitution of the Republic of Venezuela was designed in December 1811. The Congress established a Confederation called the United States of Venezuela in the Constitution, crafted mostly by lawyer Juan Germán Roscio, that it ratified on 21 December 1811. The Constitution created a strong bicameral legislature and, as also happened in neighboring New Granada, the Congress kept the weak executive consisting of a triumvirate.

A second triumvirate followed on April 3, 1812. The presidency was disestablished in 1813, when Simon Bolivar established the Third Republic of Venezuela (1817–1819). In 1830, José Antonio Páez declared Venezuela independent from Gran Colombia and became president, taking office on January 13, 1830. Presidents of Venezuela who served under the 1864 constitution (starting with Juan Crisóstomo Falcón) bore the title of &quot;President of the Union&quot;, instead of the usual &quot;President of the Republic&quot; still used today. Aside from that, all heads of state of the country since 1811 have held the title of &quot;President of Venezuela.&quot;

===1900–1989: First democratic elections===

El Trienio Adeco was a period in Venezuelan history from 1945 to 1948 under the government of Democratic Action, a party which gained office via the 1945 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état against President Isaías Medina Angarita of the two-year-old Venezuelan Democratic Party. El Trienio Adeco saw the first democratic elections in Venezuelan history, beginning with the Constituent Assembly elections held in Venezuela on 27 October 1946, Democratic Action, which won 137 of the 160 seats in the Assembly. Voter turnout was 86.6%.

General elections held in Venezuela on 14 December 1947 are described as the first honest elections in Venezuela. At the time, there were 110 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 46 seats in the Senate, with Democratic Action winning a majority of both.

The 1948 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état took place on 24 November 1948, when elected president Rómulo Gallegos was overthrown a year after his election. Democracy would not be restored until the 1958 Venezuelan coup d&#x27;état overthrew the dictator Marcos Pérez Jiménez.

A referendum on the presidential term and national and regional governors was held on 15 December 1957, resulting in the referendum&#x27;s approval. Voters were asked whether they approved of President Marcos Pérez Jiménez remaining in power without fresh elections, and appointing government nominees as members of the national parliament, regional assemblies and local councils. The referendum was held under non-democratic conditions. Jiménez was overthrown the following year.

In the 7 December 1958 general elections, voter turnout was recorded at 94.4% in the presidential election and 92.1% in the Congressional elections. Democratic Action again swept the elections, winning the presidency and two majorities.

===1990–1999: Later constitutions===
The 1998 presidential election was the first to be carried out with a new National Electoral Council. Traditionally poll workers had been provided by the parties, but in this election &quot;a lottery was set up to draft 300,000 registered voters as poll workers&quot;. The elections also saw &quot;the world&#x27;s first automated voting system, which featured a single integrated electronic network that was supposed to transmit the results from the polling stations to central headquarters within minutes.&quot; The automated vote system enabled the Electoral Council to announce the results within 2.5 hours of the polls closing. After corroborating the results with the Carter Center, the losing candidate conceded several hours later. In the 1998 presidential elections, one of candidate Hugo Chávez&#x27;s electoral promises was to organize a referendum asking the people if they wanted to convene a National Constituent Assembly. His first decree as president was thus to order such a referendum, which took place on 19 April. The electorate were asked two questionswhether a constituent assembly should be convened, and whether it should follow the mechanisms proposed by the president. The 1998 parliamentary elections were on 8 November 1998. There were 207 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 54 seats in the Senate.

Under the new Bolivarian 1999 Constitution, the legislative branch of Government in Venezuela is represented by a unicameral National Assembly. The Assembly is made up of 165 deputies &quot;(diputados)&quot;, who are elected by &quot;universal, direct, personal, and secret&quot; vote on a national party-list proportional representation system. In addition, three deputies are returned on a state-by-state basis, and three seats were reserved for representatives of Venezuela&#x27;s indigenous peoples. All deputies serve five-year terms. In 1999 a two-term limit of six years each was established for the President of Venezuela.

===2000–present: Recent elections===

In 2007 the leading Fifth Republic Movement (MVR) party dissolved and the United Socialist Party of Venezuela (PSUV) formed as the leading government party. On 15 August 2007, PSUV founder and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez proposed an amendment to 33 articles of Venezuela&#x27;s 350-article Constitution. Chávez stated that the proposed constitutional reforms were needed to complete the transition to a socialist republic and to implement his Bolivarian Revolution. The proposal was narrowly defeated by 51 to 49 percent. In 2009 a constitutional referendum resulted in the abolition of term limits for the office of President of Venezuela.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC 16/2&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 parliamentary elections took place on 26 September 2010 to elect the 165 deputies to the National Assembly. Venezuelan opposition parties (which had boycotted the previous 2005 election, thus allowing the MVR to gain a supermajority) participated in the election through the Coalition for Democratic Unity (MUD).

The National Electoral council scheduled regional elections for 16 December 2012 to elect state governors and state legislators, with PSUV winning the governorships of 20 of the 23 states. Voter turnout was 53%.

New versions of the Basic Law of Electoral Processes (, LOPE) were issued by the CNE on 7 June 2012 and 18 January 2013.

Venezuela&#x27;s municipal elections were delayed from their intended date of 14 April 2013 after the death of President Hugo Chávez on 5 March 2013, as a new presidential election was also scheduled for 14 April. Winning the vote by a narrow margin, Nicolás Maduro was sworn in as the new president on 19 April 2013. After around an eight-month delay, municipal elections on December 8, 2013, elected 337 mayors and 2,455 local councillors for their respective 2013–2017 terms.

The parliamentary elections in 2015 took place on 6 December 2015 to elect the 164 deputies and three indigenous representatives of the National Assembly. The result was a decisive defeat for the ruling PSUV, which lost control of the Assembly for the first time since 1999. The Democratic Unity Roundtable (MUD) won the majority of seats.

A week after the 2015 parliamentary elections, the outgoing National Assembly created the &quot;National Communal Parliament&quot;, with President Maduro stating &quot;All power to the Communal parliament&quot;. The move was described by Janes Information Services as an attempt &quot;to sideline and leapfrog the incoming opposition-controlled National Assembly&quot;. The process to hold a Venezuelan recall referendum to vote on recalling Maduro started on 2 May 2016. In July 2016, the Venezuelan government stated that if enough signatures were collected in the second petition stage, a recall vote would be held no sooner than 2017. However, the government cancelled the recall movement on 21 October 2017, with conventional media describing President Maduro as a dictator following the suspension of movement.

After Venezuela entered into a constitutional crisis when the Supreme Tribunal removed power from the National Assembly, months of protests occurred in 2017, resulting in President Maduro calling for the rewriting of the constitution. The 2017 Venezuelan Constituent Assembly election took place, electing all pro-Maduro candidates to the Constituent Assembly of Venezuela, removing power from the National Assembly once again. In December 2020, the Venezuelan Constitutional Assembly was dismantled without presenting a draft for the new constitution.

On July 28, 2024, presidential elections were held for the 2025 - 2031, where the incumbent President, Nicolas Maduro, ran against Edmungo Gonzalez. The result of the election became contested as the government claimed Nicolas Maduro won with 51.90% of the vote. However, international organism including the Carter center and the United Nations contested this claim as being false and filled with irregularities. On the other hand, the opposition published the detailed electoral results in the form of scanned copies of the tally sheets on the website &quot;resultadospresidencialesvenezuela2024.com&quot; The opposition was able to obtain 83.50% of the reported tallies, showing that the candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia won with 67.08% of the votes.

==Voting system==

===Electoral registration===
Under the 1999 Constitution of Venezuela, all Venezuelans over the age of 18 have the right to vote (Article 64). Additionally, long-term resident non-nationals over 18 (resident over 10 years) have the right to vote in regional and local elections (Article 64). Article 56 specifies that everyone has &quot;the right to be registered free of charge with the Civil Registry Office after birth, and to obtain public documents constituting evidence of their biological identity, in accordance with the law.&quot;

According to the National Electoral Council, the proportion of the voting-age population on the Electoral Register has risen from 80% in 1998 to 95% in 2011, with 19m (including nearly 100,000 voters outside Venezuela) registered in 2012 compared with 12m in 2003. Voters register fingerprints and identity card details onto the Electoral Register, and these are to be verified during the voting process.

===Electoral system===
Venezuela elects at a national level the President of Venezuela as head of state and head of government, and a unicameral federal legislature. The President is elected for a six-year term by direct election plurality voting, and is (since the 2009 Venezuelan constitutional referendum) eligible for re-election. The National Assembly &quot;(Asamblea Nacional)&quot; has 165 members &quot;(diputados)&quot;, elected for five-year terms (see #Parliamentary voting system below).

==Party system==
===Background===

Democracy in Venezuela developed during the twentieth century, with Democratic Action (founded in 1941) and its antecedents playing an important role in the early years. Democratic Action led the government during Venezuela&#x27;s first democratic period (1945–1948). After an intervening decade of dictatorship (1948–1958) saw AD excluded from power, four Venezuelan presidents came from Democratic Action from the 1960s to the 1990s. This period, incorrectly called the &quot;Fourth Republic&quot; by Hugo Chavez and his followers, is marked by the development of the Punto Fijo Pact between the major parties (originally including the Democratic Republican Union, which later dwindled in significance), with the notable exclusion of the Communist Party of Venezuela. By the end of the 1990s, however, the now two-party system&#x27;s credibility was almost nonexistent, mostly because of the corruption and poverty that Venezuelans experienced because of the debt crisis developed during the 1980s. Democratic Action&#x27;s last president (Carlos Andrés Pérez) was impeached for corruption in 1993, and spent several years in prison as a result. The other main traditional party Copei, provided two Venezuelan presidents (Rafael Caldera, 1969–1974, and Luis Herrera Campins, 1979–1983).

===Current===
Confidence in the traditional parties collapsed enough that the 1993 presidential elections were won by Rafael Caldera on around 30% of the vote, representing a new electoral coalition, National Convergence. By 1998, support for Democratic Action and COPEI had fallen still further, and the 1998 election was won by political outsider Hugo Chávez.

Since then, a range of newer parties (such as A New Era and Justice First) have been more prominent in opposition to Chávez than the traditional main parties Democratic Action and COPEI. The United Socialist Party of Venezuela (&quot;Partido Socialista Unido de Venezuela&quot;, PSUV) was created in 2007, uniting a number of smaller parties supporting Chávez&#x27; Bolivarian Revolution with Chávez&#x27; Fifth Republic Movement. It is the lead party of the Great Patriotic Pole coalition. The Democratic Unity Roundtable (&quot;Mesa de la Unidad Democrática&quot;, MUD), created in 2008, unites much of the opposition. Hugo Chávez, the central figure of the Venezuelan political landscape since 1998, died in office in early 2013, and was succeeded by Nicolás Maduro (initially as interim President, before narrowly winning the 2013 Venezuelan presidential election).

==Polling procedure==

Since 1998 elections in Venezuela have become more automated, and administered by the National Electoral Council, with poll workers drafted via a lottery of registered voters. Polling places are equipped with multiple touch-screen DRE voting machines, one per &quot;mesa electoral&quot;, or voting &quot;table&quot;. After the vote is cast, each machine prints out a paper ballot, or VVPAT, which is inspected by the voter and deposited in a ballot box belonging to the machine&#x27;s table. The voting machines perform in a stand-alone fashion, disconnected from any network until the polls close. Voting session closure at each of the voting stations in a given polling center is determined either by the lack of further voters after the lines have emptied, or by the hour, at the discretion of the president of the voting table.

Voters register fingerprints and identity card details onto the Electoral Register, and these are verified during the voting process. Voters sign a register to confirm that they have voted, and have a finger marked with election ink.

In March 2018, Smartmatic, the British electoral products company (now &quot;SGO Corporation&quot;) which had participated in the majority of elections under the Bolivarian government, ceased operations in Venezuela, stating that they could no longer guarantee the validity of election results through its machines.

===Tally scrutinization===
After the polls close at any voting table, the following steps are carried out:
*The DRE voting machine is ordered to close the voting session.
*Tally scrutinization announced.
*Each voting machine prints an original tally sheet, each has a voter total and the number of votes cast for each candidate cast in that particular machine/table.
*Each voting machine is connected to the network and the results are sent to the vote counting center.
*Nine extra tally sheets are printed and distributed to the staff and the six representatives of the candidates that received the most votes.
*With the original tally sheet in hand the total number of votes cast is compared to the signed up sheet or electoral notebook. Finally, for those machines chosen for the audit (see below) the electoral ballots, or paper trails, are counted one by one to determine if they add up to the totals in the tally sheet. Any anomaly is mentioned in the tally sheet report, signed by the staff and auditors, and then sealed and given to the military for delivery to the CNE.

===Random paper ballot audit===
Once the tally scrutinization is complete the staff proceeds to perform a random paper ballot audit of 54.31% of the machines. Each voting center can have anywhere from one to twelve voting machines, occasionally up to fifteen. The staff randomly selects the tables/machines by drawing a number out of a paper hat. The size of the draw is dependent on the number of tables/machines.

The following procedures occur step by step:

* Polls are closed
* Tally scrutinization finishes
* Random paper ballot audit announced
* The machines are randomly selected drawing numbers out of a paper hat
* The machine&#x27;s serial number is recorded
* The corresponding paper ballot box is selected and opened
* The paper ballots results for each candidate are openly counted
* With the original tally printed from the electronic results, both results are audited
* Any anomaly (even if by one vote) is recorded in the audit report
* The original audit report is signed by staff and observers, officially sealed and handed to the military for delivery to the CNE
* Copies are handed over to the representatives of the two highest vote getters.

==Parliamentary elections==
===Parliamentary voting system===
Elections for the National Assembly of Venezuela in the 2000 and the 2005 were conducted under a weak mixed member proportional system, with 60% elected in first-past-the-post voting districts and the remainder by closed party list proportional representation. This was an adaptation of the system previously used for the Venezuelan Chamber of Deputies, which had been introduced in 1993, with a 50–50 balance between voting districts and party lists, and deputies per state proportional to population, but with a minimum of three deputies per state.

For the 2010 election, the &quot;Ley Orgánica de Procesos Electorales (LOPE)&quot; (Basic Law of Electoral Process) among other changes reduced the party list proportion to 30%. In addition, the law completely separated the district vote and the party list votes, creating a parallel voting system. Previously, parties winning nominal district seats had had these subtracted from the total won under the proportional party list. Under the new law, in 2009, electoral districts were redefined in a way that has been accused of favouring the PSUV, particularly in giving more weight to votes in the countryside over those in the city.

==Presidential elections==

There are regular presidential elections in Venezuela. The President of Venezuela is elected for a six-year term by direct election plurality voting, and is eligible for unlimited re-election. One of the first &quot;honest&quot; presidential elections in Venezuela was held in 1947, with Rómulo Gallegos of Democratic Action receiving 74.3% of the vote. The next elections were held in 1958 and won by Rómulo Betancourt of Democratic Action, who received 49.2% of the vote. With voter turnout reported to be 92.3%, in the 1963 presidential elections Raúl Leoni of Democratic Action won with 32.8% of the vote. In the subsequent 1968 elections, Rafael Caldera of Copei (the Social Christian Party of Venezuela) won with 29.1% of the vote, although Democratic Action remained the largest party in the Chamber of Deputies and Senate. The following elections the presidential seat returned to Democratic Action, with Carlos Andrés Pérez receiving 48.7% of the vote in a voter turnout of 96.5%.

The 1978 elections were won by Luis Herrera Campins of Copei with 46.6% of the vote. Jaime Lusinchi of Democratic Action won with 58.4% of the vote in 1983, with voter turnout at 87.3%. Carlos Andrés Pérez won a second time in 1988 with 52.9% of the vote, and a voter turnout of 81.9% in the presidential election. Former president Rafael Caldera, newly associated with National Convergence, won with 30.5% of the vote in 1993. The voter turnout in 1993 was 60.2%, the lowest since World War II. After being imprisoned for an attempted coup and then pardoned by Caldera, Hugo Chávez founded the Fifth Republic Movement and was elected president of Venezuela in 1998. He was re-elected in 2000.

A recall referendum in 2004 was voted on by the populace to determine whether Chávez should be recalled from office, resulting in no recall (58% no). The authenticity of the results became a point of contention.

Chavez was reelected in 2006 with over 60% of the votes, and in 2009 a constitutional referendum resulted in the abolishment of term limits for the offices of President of Venezuela. Since 1999 there had been a two-term limit.
Chavez was reelected for a third term in the October 2012 presidential election.
Nicolas Maduro won the 2013 presidential election and was reelected in 2018.

==Regional and local elections==
Venezuela is a federal state; Venezuelan states have governors, which have been elected since 1989 (previously they were appointed by the President). Regional and local elections were introduced following the work in the 1980s of the Commission for the Reform of the State (&quot;Comisión para la Reforma del Estado&quot;, COPRE).

<text>Playing by Heart is a 1998 American comedy-drama film which tells the story of several seemingly unconnected characters. It was entered into the 49th Berlin International Film Festival. It stars Gillian Anderson, Ellen Burstyn, Sean Connery, Anthony Edwards, Angelina Jolie, Jay Mohr, Ryan Phillippe, Dennis Quaid, Gena Rowlands, Jon Stewart and Madeleine Stowe. &quot;Playing by Heart&quot; is an ensemble work that explores the path of love in its characters’ lives.

==Plot==
In Los Angeles, the lives of intertwining characters are shown. Among the characters are an older couple, who are about to renew their wedding vows; a theatre director and architect navigating a new beginning; a young woman looking for a good time; a gay man dying of AIDS and his mother who had not been close; a couple having an affair and her husband who is exploring ways to break through the staleness of their marriage.

As the stories evolve, the connections between the characters become evident.

Unhappily-married Hugh regularly hits on women with an array of lies: that he has killed his wife and son in a car accident; that his wife and kids leave him on the same day he is fired; and that he has cheated on his wife with her brother. Hugh runs into improv classmate Valery in a bar, telling her he performs better in real life than in class.

Paul, suffering a brain tumour, and Hannah are planning their 40th-anniversary party and renewing their vows. Despite Hannah&#x27;s best efforts, Paul refuses to address that he&#x27;s dying. Hannah considers canceling her televised cooking show, but Paul won&#x27;t let her. When Hannah confronts Paul over a picture of another woman on his desk, he admits he never slept with her because he was in love with her.

Lonely theatre director Meredith dates architect Trent. Both are divorced; Meredith has been burnt many times before, and Trent still wears his wedding ring four years on. Trent convinces Meredith to invite him over and cook him dinner. Meredith panics once he arrives, first telling him they will not be having sex, then asking him to leave, saying it&#x27;s to avoid the inevitable heartache. However Trent gets a do-over, and they connect at his place.

The spark has gone from Gracie&#x27;s marriage, who deals with this by meeting her lover Roger in hotel rooms before returning home to her distant husband Hugh. Roger wants their relationship to develop beyond just sex, but Gracie is firm on things staying the way they are. Gracie brings spontaneity to Roger&#x27;s life for the first time.

Mark is gravely ill with AIDS and being looked after by his mother Mildred who, after years of estrangement, finally learns he is gay through his diagnosis. He asks her to recite &quot;Goodnight Moon&quot; to him as he dies.

Twenty-something clubber Joan flirts with Keenan after having a very final, vocal breakup with her ex via payphone. After complaining about how terrible her relationship was, Joan propositions Keenan to see a film only to be rebuffed as he &#x27;doesn&#x27;t date&#x27;. Even so, Keenan turns up at the movies as Joan proposes. Joan and Keenan admit their feelings. He reveals his former girlfriend contracted AIDS from sharing needles and died, and that, as a result, he is HIV-positive. Promising to be careful, they start a relationship.

Mildred calls Meredith for Mark&#x27;s funeral, as he was her high school sweetheart, then husband, who left her for a man. Returning home with Mildred, Meredith goes next door to her parents - Hannah and Paul - where the anniversary preparations are well on their way. Sister Gracie appears to help, and little sister Joan breezes in at the last moment.

Roger officiates the ceremony, and we see all three sisters on the dance floor with their men and their parents. Even Gracie and Hugh seem to have reconciled.

==Cast==
==Production==
According to director Willard Carroll, the film was made on a budget of $14 million as the cast led by Sean Connery agreed to work for $50,000 each. Carroll praised Connery, saying he &quot;continued his total democratic cooperation in the ensemble piece. He was the most generous actor, although he&#x27;s a larger-than-life star&quot; and that Connery &quot;set the example&quot; the others followed.

The film&#x27;s original working title was &quot;Dancing About Architecture&quot;, a reference to a line in the film (based on a quote regarding &quot;writing about music&quot;) that the idea of &quot;talking about love&quot; is equivalent to &quot;dancing about architecture&quot;. A second working title, &quot;If Only They Knew&quot;, made it as far as the top label for some copies of the soundtrack CD. Executive producers include Bob Weinstein and Harvey Weinstein for Miramax Films.

Jon Stewart&#x27;s character is an architect, his home in the film is the Stahl House.
The soundtrack includes songs by Morcheeba, Bonnie Raitt, Bran Van 3000, Edward Kowalczyk of Live, Neneh Cherry and Moby.

==Reception==

The film was released in the United States on December 18, 1998. In the United Kingdom, it was released on August 6, 1999, and opened at the number 11 spot.
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 61% based on reviews from 51 critics, with an average rating of 6/10. The site&#x27;s consensus was: &quot;It&#x27;s overly talky, but &quot;Playing by Heart&quot; benefits from witty insights into modern relationships and strong performances from an esteemed cast.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 55% based on reviews from 26 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of B+ on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert gave it a thumbs down, and 2.5 out of 4 in his print review, due to its entertaining dialogue, star power, and charming moments, but determines it to be a &#x27;near miss&#x27; because of its soft, gooey center. It was one of the last films reviewed on air, by film critic Gene Siskel, on &quot;Siskel and Ebert at the Movies&quot;, before his death on February 20, 1999. Like Ebert, Siskel gave it a thumbs down, deeming the film more about behaviour than story.
Jolie won an award for &quot;Best Breakthrough Performance by an Actress&quot; from the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures, and writer/director Willard Carroll was nominated for an award at the Berlin International Film Festival.

<text>Kiekko-Espoo Naiset are an ice hockey team in the Auroraliiga. They play in the Tapiola district of Espoo, Finland at the () of the Tapiolan urheilupuisto. The team was founded as Espoon Kiekkoseura (EKS) in 1989 and has also been known as Espoo Blues Naiset and Espoo United Naiset during its tenure in the Auroraliiga. Kiekko-Espoo have won the Aurora Borealis Cup as the Finnish Champions in women&#x27;s ice hockey sixteen times, six more wins than any other team in league history; at least one Finnish Championship medal (gold, silver, or bronze) was won under each of the four names.

The parent club, Kiekko-Espoo Oy, also has a representative men&#x27;s ice hockey team in the Liiga, a representative ringette team in the Ringeten SM-sarja, and active sections in minor and junior ice hockey and youth ringette.

== History ==

=== EKS, 1990–1992 ===
The team entered Naisten SM-sarja (now Naisten Liiga) in the 1990–91 season under the name Espoon Kiekkoseura or EKS. The two seasons played as EKS were an impressive showing for the newcomers and each resulted in a bronze medal, one in the 1990–91 season after defeating Ässät and one in the 1991–92 season after defeating KalPa.

Several EKS players also played for the bronze medal winning Finnish women&#x27;s national team at the 1992 IIHF World Championship including Liisa Karikoski, Katri-Helena Luomajoki, and Hanna Teerijoki.

=== Kiekko-Espoo, 1992–1998 ===
In 1992 EKS was renamed Kiekko-Espoo, the same name as its brother-team in the Liiga. The team continued to be held to bronze or lower finishes, qualifying for five bronze medal series in six years and winning four of them (1993, 1994, 1997, 1998).

=== The Golden Age: Espoo Blues, 1998–2016 ===
The team was renamed Espoo Blues in 1998, continuing the trend of sharing the name of its brother-team in the Liiga, which also renamed Espoo Blues in that year. The name change unwittingly marked the beginning of a &quot;golden age&quot; for the team. Starting with their first SM-sarja gold medal in 1999, after achieving victory over JYP Jyväskylä in the finals, they went on to win a staggering seven consecutive championships (1999–2005) and a total of thirteen championships in eighteen years. The Blues were kept off the SM-sarja medal podium only three times in the 1998–2016 span; in addition to their championship titles, they earned the team&#x27;s first silver medal in 2009 and two more bronze medals in 2006 and 2016.

The Espoo Blues were also strong competitors at international tournaments in this period, earning medals at six IIHF European Women&#x27;s Champions Cups: three silver medals (2005, 2007-08, 2009-10) and three bronze medals (2008-09, 2013–14, 2014–15).

=== Espoo United, 2016–17 ===
In March 2016 &quot;Jääkiekko Espoo Oy&quot;, the parent club of both the Espoo Blues of the Naisten Liiga and Espoo Blues of the Liiga, declared bankruptcy with estimated liabilities of approximately €3 million. In response, Jussi Salonoja, a Finnish millionaire and film director who had previously owned the Espoo Blues franchise from 2002–2012, created a new club and organization called &quot;Espoo United Oy,&quot; stating that he was &quot;committed to supporting hockey in Espoo.&quot; The Espoo Blues men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball and ice hockey teams would play for Espoo United.

For the 2016–17 season the Espoo United women&#x27;s ice hockey team played in the Naisten SM-sarja and won silver in the 2017 Finnish Championship. The Espoo United men&#x27;s team played in the Mestis, the league below the premier-level Liiga, where they won bronze in the playoffs.

On 15 August 2017 Salonoja announced that the Espoo United was abandoning its women&#x27;s ice hockey and basketball teams for financial reasons. “The reason is twofold: the men&#x27;s teams&#x27; budgets are far greater than those of women&#x27;s teams, so their running is more demanding, but on the other hand, [the men&#x27;s teams] are more interesting to sponsors and audiences,” Salonoja said.

The future of women&#x27;s ice hockey team was left uncertain and many possible solutions were proposed, including being acquired by HIFK or merging with Espoo Blues Juniorit (a junior club with strong ties to the franchise).

=== Espoo Blues part 2, 2017–2019 ===
In September 2017 the Finnish Ice Hockey Association announced that it had supported the creation of an independent association, Ysikoppi ry, to oversee the team and had given its approval for the team to compete in the upcoming 2017–18 season under the name Espoo Blues.

== Season-by-season results ==
&quot;This is a partial list of the most recent seasons completed by the franchise. The team was called the “Espoo Blues” during the 2015–16, 2017–18, and 2018–19 seasons; “Espoo United” in the 2016–17 season, and “Kiekko-Espoo” from the 2019–20 season onward.&quot;

<doc id="924185" wikidata="Q1475599" url="?curid=924185" title="Future Rapid Effect System">
<text>The Future Rapid Effect System (FRES) was the name for the British Ministry of Defence (MOD) programme to deliver a fleet of more than 4,000 armoured fighting vehicles for the British Army. The vehicles were to be rapidly deployable, network-enabled, capable of operating across the spectrum of operations, and protected against current threats. The programme has now been split into two separate procurement projects for a reconnaissance Specialist Vehicle (SV) and an aspiration for a future Utility Vehicle (UV). The General Dynamics Ajax was selected to fulfill the SV requirement in 2016.

==History==
The total FRES fleet was to be divided into two main parts, the Utility Variant (FRES UV) and the Specialist Variant (FRES SV). These types were broken down into families of vehicles: The Utility Variant comprises protected mobility, command and control, light armoured support, repair and recovery and medical. The Specialist Variant comprises RECCE Block 1 (Scout, armoured personnel carrier, repair, recovery and Common Base Platform) and RECCE Block 2 (Joint Fires Direction, Command Post and Engineer Recce).

Despite long delays in the procurement process, exacerbated by a budget shortfall at the MoD, the FRES programme is moving ahead with the award of the Specialist Vehicle contract to General Dynamics UK for the ASCOD AFV tracked vehicle in March 2010.

Due to the complexity of the FRES programme, a &quot;System of Systems&quot; Integrator (SOSI) was appointed to assist the MoD in the selection of the vehicles and cross-vehicle electronic architecture. In October 2007, the FRES SOSI contract was awarded to a joint team of Thales and Boeing.

The SOSI team was contracted to act as an independent, honest broker between industry and the MoD to co-ordinate the procurement of more than 3,000 vehicles which were expected to be acquired under FRES.

Six main elements of the SOSI role were: programme management; systems of systems engineering and integration; alliance development and management; development of the MoD&#x27;s SOSI competence; through-life capability management; and through-life technology management.
The SOSI role was scrapped when the programme was restructured following the failure to progress with the UV procurement.

===FRES Utility Vehicle===
The first family of vehicles, known as the Utility Vehicles (UV) were expected to enter service in the 2010s. FRES UV was to have replaced the Army&#x27;s Saxon wheeled APC, the tracked FV432, and some of the CVR(T) vehicle family. The design is planned to follow the philosophy of &quot;medium weight&quot; forces that balance ease of transportability (&quot;light&quot;) with armour (&quot;heavy&quot;).

====FRES UV competition====

In 1999, Germany and United Kingdom began development of the Boxer Multi Role Armoured Vehicle, which was intended to assume different roles via switchable modules. The UK withdrew from the project in 2003, stating that the Boxer did not fulfill requirements. The British Ministry of Defence decided to pursue a replacement, with a specification that it could be airlifted by Airbus A400M and smaller C-130 Hercules transport aircraft. The new &quot;Future Rapid Effect System&quot; project was established in May 2004, with an assessment period of two years.

Since then, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory has been researching electric armour, with the view of ultimately integrating it into the FRES design. Plans for FRES vehicles to be carried by C-130 were dropped for being unworkable.

In June 2007, the then Minister of State for Defence Equipment and Support, Lord Drayson, announced that three vehicles had been selected for trials to determine the utility vehicle design for FRES UV. These were:
* Boxer, built by ARTEC Germany.
* Piranha V, built by General Dynamics UK.
* VBCI, built by Nexter (France).

====Response to criticism====
In a defence briefing on 14 June 2007, Lord Drayson made it clear that FRES UV would not be the standard off-the-shelf version of any of these vehicles:
They are designs which are currently in development to provide new models within existing families of vehicles. I am sure you agree that it would make no sense to invent a new vehicle from scratch. The designs we will look at in the trials this summer take proven vehicles, and evolve them to the next level to have the capacity, mobility, ability to upgrade through life, and, above all, the level of protection the Army need.

In FRES UV it was envisaged that a further role, that of the &quot;vehicle integrator&quot;, would be required to ensure that the vehicles are customised to meet British Army requirements and be supported and upgraded through their life. A number of companies positioned for this role, including BAE Systems and General Dynamics. When the programme was restructured this was no longer envisaged as a separate role.

====FRES UV Preferred Bidder====
The announcement of the winning design was initially planned for November 2007. The selection was announced in May 2008. The winning design provisionally selected for the FRES Utility Vehicle contract was the Mowag Piranha V, manufactured by General Dynamics. This decision had been expected, with speculation from February 2008 onwards that General Dynamics was the preferred contractor for the deal.
However, as no production order was announced, various sources &quot;feared that the FRES programme had fallen victim to the UK defence &quot;budget crunch&quot;. This was borne out in December 2008, when General Dynamics&#x27; status as preferred contractor for the Utility Vehicle contract was rescinded.

===Demise of FRES as a programme===
After General Dynamics had its preferred bidder status for UV withdrawn in December 2008, the Ministry of Defence decided to restructure the programme. The utility vehicle programme was scheduled to restart towards the end of 2010.
The UK MoD&#x27;s Defence Equipment and Support agency focused its attention on the tracked variants of the FRES programme, most notably the Specialist Vehicle.

The FRES Integrated Project Team, based at MoD Abbey Wood, disbanded, and the SV was joined with the Warrior Capability Sustainment Programme (WCSP) in a new procurement team named &quot;Medium Armoured Tracks Team&quot; (MATT). The two programmes share the Common Cannon and Ammunition Programme, whereby a new 40mm Cannon from CTAI will be the main armament to both the upgraded Warriors and the new Specialist Vehicle.

With the demise of the UV procurement, the supporting roles of SOSI and VI were no longer required, and were not pursued as part of the overall procurement scheme. FRES as an overarching programme effectively no longer exists, with future UV and SV projects being separate armored vehicle procurements.

==Future Utility Vehicle==
In February 2014, France agreed to lend a few VBCIs to the British Army for testing. French military sources report that the British Army is interested in purchasing the vehicle. The French Ministry of Defense has indicated that the French Army may purchase the British Watchkeeper WK450 unmanned aerial vehicle if the British Army buys the VBCI. The British Army is testing the VBCI as part of the future utility vehicle programme, intended to start replacing the current fleet of protected mobility vehicles by 2022. FRES UV has now been renamed as the Mechanised Infantry Vehicle programme.

==Specialist Vehicle SCOUT SV==

The Specialist Vehicles (SV) procurement will provide a range of vehicles including reconnaissance, engineering and battlefield medical variants, based on a tracked chassis. The CV90, offered by BAE Systems, and the ASCOD SV, offered by General Dynamics UK, were put forward as potential reconnaissance vehicles. In November 2008, they were awarded assessment-phase contracts .

In July 2009, the MoD invited BAE Systems and General Dynamics UK to help it develop new reconnaissance vehicles for the British Army as part of the FRES Scout Vehicles programme.

In March 2010, the MoD awarded General Dynamics UK a development contract to build the SCOUT SV. BAE Systems fought to reverse the decision by announcing it would move manufacturing from Sweden to its Newcastle factory. The £500M contract for the demonstration phase of 7 prototype vehicles was announced in July 2010. Trials were expected to start in 2013. The PMRS version of Scout was revealed during the 2014 exhibition. 

In September 2014, the British Ministry of Defence will sign a £3.5 billion (US $5.8 billion) deal with General Dynamics UK for 589 Scout SV platforms. These will include Reconnaissance and Strike variants, Joint Fire Control variants, Ground Based Surveillance variants, Armoured Personnel Carrier (APC) variants, Command and Control (C2) variants, Formation Reconnaissance Overwatch variants, Engineer Reconnaissance variants, Recovery and Repair variants. The Scout SV was later renamed as Ajax.

<doc id="924190" wikidata="Q959193" url="?curid=924190" title="Keiji Nakazawa">
<text>was a Japanese manga artist and writer.

==Biography==
Nakazawa was born March 14, 1939,
in Naka-ku, Hiroshima, Japan and was in the city when it was destroyed by an atomic bomb in August 1945. Most of his family members who had not evacuated died as a result of the explosion after they became trapped under the debris of their house, except for his mother and an infant sister (who died several weeks later either from malnutrition or radiation from her mother afterward).

Nakazawa graduated from middle school in 1954, and in 1961, he moved to Tokyo to become a full-time cartoonist and produced short pieces for manga anthologies such as &quot;Shōnen Gaho&quot;, &quot;Shōnen King&quot;, and &quot;Bokura&quot;.

Following the death of his mother in 1966, Nakazawa returned to his memories of the destruction of Hiroshima and began to express them in his stories. &quot;Kuroi Ame ni Utarete&quot; (&quot;Struck by Black Rain&quot;), the first of a series of five books, was a fictional story of Hiroshima survivors involved in the postwar black market. Nakazawa chose to portray his own experience in the 1972 story &quot;Ore wa Mita&quot;, published in &quot;Monthly Shōnen Jump&quot;. The story was translated into English and published as a one-shot comic book by Educomics as &quot;I Saw It&quot;.

Immediately after completing &quot;I Saw It&quot;, Nakazawa began his major work, &quot;Hadashi no Gen&quot; (&quot;Barefoot Gen&quot;). This series, which eventually filled ten volumes, was based on the same events as &quot;I Saw It&quot; but expanded and fictionalized, with the young Gen Nakaoka as a stand-in for the author. &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; depicted the bombing and its aftermath in extremely graphic detail, with Gen&#x27;s experiences being even more harrowing than Nakazawa&#x27;s own. It also turned a critical eye on the militarization of Japanese society during World War II and on the sometimes abusive dynamics of the traditional family. &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; was adapted into a trilogy of live-action movies, two animated films, and a live-action TV drama.

Nakazawa announced his retirement in September 2009, citing deteriorating diabetes and cataract conditions. He canceled plans for a &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot; sequel. In September 2010, Nakazawa was diagnosed with lung cancer; in July 2011, metastasis from lung cancer was found. He died on December 19, 2012.

<doc id="924191" wikidata="Q6378515" url="?curid=924191" title="Katy Lederer">
<text>Katherine &quot;Katy&quot; Lederer (born ) is an American poet and author of the memoir &quot;Poker Face: A Girlhood Among Gamblers&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Lederer is the daughter of bestselling non-fiction author Richard Lederer and Rhoda (née Spangenberg) Lederer. The child of a Jewish father and a non-Jewish mother, she was not raised as Jewish.

Her siblings are world-class poker players Howard Lederer and Annie Duke. She graduated from St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire, where her father was on the English faculty.

Lederer later attended the University of California at Berkeley, from which she received her BA in English and anthropology. After graduating in 1995, Lederer moved to Las Vegas to study poker with her siblings, and was subsequently accepted to the Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop on an Iowa Arts Fellowship. While at Iowa, Lederer founded the zine &quot;Explosive&quot;, which was published in a limited edition of 300 with hand-printed covers by the artist and writer David Larsen. The tenth and final issue of &quot;Explosive&quot; was published in 2006.

==Career==
After completing her studies at Iowa in 1998, Lederer moved to New York City, where she worked for psychoanalyst Arnold Cooper. After this, she worked as a coordinator of the Barnard New Women Poets program. From 1998-1999, she was the editor of the Poetry Project Newsletter out of the Poetry Project at St. Mark’s Church in the Bowery. Lederer continues to publish limited-edition books and chapbooks under the Spectacular Books imprint, and also serves as a Poetry Editor of &quot;Fence&quot; magazine. In 1999, she signed a contract with Crown Books to write a memoir about her family’s life in gambling, Poker Face: A Girlhood Among Gamblers.

Lederer made her poetry debut in 2002 with the collection &quot;Winter Sex&quot;. Poet D. A. Powell described the poems in the collection “as leaps of faith, fibrillating in the dark world with a kinetic energy that rises out of erotic desire.” Her memoir, &quot;Poker Face: A Girlhood Among Gamblers&quot; was published in 2003. It was chosen as a Barnes &amp; Noble Discover Great New Writers selection, and was named a Best Nonfiction Book of the Year by &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; and one of eight Best Books of the Year by &quot;Esquire Magazine&quot;.

From 2002 to 2008, Lederer worked as a recruiter at D.E. Shaw &amp; Co., a quantitative hedge fund in midtown Manhattan, which provided much of the inspiration for the pieces in her most recent poetry collection, &quot;The Heaven-Sent Leaf&quot;. The title of both the book and the opening poem is taken from the second half of Goethe’s Faust and describes paper money. Other poems in the collection reference the works of John Kenneth Galbraith, Nietzsche, and Edith Wharton.

She married Ben Statz, after being introduced to him by her sister Annie Duke. They have two children.

<doc id="924193" wikidata="Q3075214" url="?curid=924193" title="Volterra's function">
<text>In mathematics, Volterra&#x27;s function, named for Vito Volterra, is a real-valued function &quot;V&quot; defined on the real line R with the following curious combination of properties:

* &quot;V&quot; is differentiable everywhere
* The derivative &quot;V&quot; ′ is bounded everywhere
* The derivative is not Riemann-integrable.

==Definition and construction==
The function is defined by making use of the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set and an infinite number or &quot;copies&quot; of sections of the function defined by 

:formula_1

The construction of &quot;V&quot; begins by determining the largest value of &quot;x&quot; in the interval [0, 1/8] for which &quot;f&quot; ′(&quot;x&quot;) = 0. Once this value (say &quot;x&quot;0) is determined, extend the function to the right with a constant value of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0) up to and including the point 1/8. Once this is done, a mirror image of the function can be created starting at the point 1/4 and extending downward towards 0. This function will be defined to be 0 outside of the interval [0, 1/4]. We then translate this function to the interval [3/8, 5/8] so that the resulting function, which we call &quot;f&quot;1, is nonzero only on the middle interval of the complement of the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set. 

To construct &quot;f&quot;2, &quot;f&quot; ′ is then considered on the smaller interval [0,1/32], truncated at the last place the derivative is zero, extended, and mirrored the same way as before, and two translated copies of the resulting function are added to &quot;f&quot;1 to produce the function &quot;f&quot;2. Volterra&#x27;s function then results by repeating this procedure for every interval removed in the construction of the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set; in other words, the function &quot;V&quot; is the limit of the sequence of functions &quot;f&quot;1, &quot;f&quot;2, ...

==Further properties==
Volterra&#x27;s function is differentiable everywhere just as &quot;f&quot; (as defined above) is. One can show that &quot;f&quot; ′(&quot;x&quot;) = 2&quot;x&quot; sin(1/&quot;x&quot;) - cos(1/&quot;x&quot;) for &quot;x&quot; ≠ 0, which means that in any neighborhood of zero, there are points where &quot;f&quot; ′ takes values 1 and −1. Thus there are points where &quot;V&quot; ′ takes values 1 and −1 in every neighborhood of each of the endpoints of intervals removed in the construction of the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set &quot;S&quot;. In fact, &quot;V&quot; ′ is discontinuous at every point of &quot;S&quot;, even though &quot;V&quot; itself is differentiable at every point of &quot;S&quot;, with derivative 0. However, &quot;V&quot; ′ is continuous on each interval removed in the construction of &quot;S&quot;, so the set of discontinuities of &quot;V&quot; ′ is equal to &quot;S&quot;.

Since the Smith–Volterra–Cantor set &quot;S&quot; has positive Lebesgue measure, this means that &quot;V&quot; ′ is discontinuous on a set of positive measure. By Lebesgue&#x27;s criterion for Riemann integrability, &quot;V&quot; ′ is not Riemann integrable. If one were to repeat the construction of Volterra&#x27;s function with the ordinary measure-0 Cantor set &quot;C&quot; in place of the &quot;fat&quot; (positive-measure) Cantor set &quot;S&quot;, one would obtain a function with many similar properties, but the derivative would then be discontinuous on the measure-0 set &quot;C&quot; instead of the positive-measure set &quot;S&quot;, and so the resulting function would have a Riemann integrable derivative.

<text>, or Celtic tuning, is an alternative guitar tuning most associated with Celtic music, though it has also found use in rock, folk, metal and several other genres. Instead of the standard tuning () the six guitar strings are tuned, from low to high, 

Tuning to from standard is accomplished by tuning the first, second, and sixth strings down a whole tone (two frets). The result is an open D, &quot;suspended fourth chord&quot;. Being suspended, the open tuning is neither intrinsically major nor minor.

==History==
D A D G A D was popularized by British folk guitarist Davey Graham.

Inspired by hearing an oud player in Morocco, Graham experimented with detuning some of the guitar&#x27;s strings from standard tuning (), arriving at He employed the tuning to great effect in his treatments of Celtic music, but also the folk music of India and Morocco. The first guitarists in Irish traditional music to use the tuning were Mícheál Ó Domhnaill and Dáithí Sproule; it has become a very common tuning in the genre.

Other proponents of the tuning include Roy Harper, John Martyn, Ben Howard, Andy Mckee, Russian Circles, Mike Dawes, Alejandro Aranda, Rory Gallagher, Luka Bloom, Stan Rogers, Jimmy Page (The Yardbirds&#x27; &quot;White Summer&quot; and Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Black Mountain Side&quot; and &quot;Kashmir&quot; use this tuning), Neil Young, Artie Traum, Pierre Bensusan, Eric Roche, Midnight, Laurence Juber, Tony McManus, Stephen Wake, Bert Jansch, Richard Thompson, Dick Gaughan, Alistair Hulett, Steve von Till (along with its modified form, ), Imaad Wasif, Mark Kozelek, Jeff Tweedy, Masaaki Kishibe, Paul McSherry, Acle Kahney (uses a 7 string variation, ), Sevendust (although downtuned), Kotaro Oshio, Ben Chasny, Al Petteway, Justin Currie, Lankum and Trey Anastasio. English folk musician Martin Carthy now mostly uses a related tuning, , whose evolution from he describes explicitly in his 1987 book.

The suitability of to Celtic music stems from the fact that it facilitates the use of a number of moveable chords, which retain open strings. These act as a drone on either the bass or treble strings, approximating the voicings used in traditional Scottish and Irish pipe music.

<doc id="924199" wikidata="Q1279389" url="?curid=924199" title="Will Geer">
<text>Will Geer (born William Aughe Ghere; March 9, 1902 – April 22, 1978) was an American actor, musician, and social activist who was active in labor organizing and communist movements in New York City and Southern California in the 1930s and 1940s. In California, he befriended rising singer Woody Guthrie. They both lived in New York City for a time in the 1940s. He was blacklisted in the 1950s by Hollywood after refusing, in testimony before Congress, to name persons who had joined the Communist Party USA.

In his later years, Geer was best known for his role as Grandpa Zebulon &quot;Zeb&quot; Walton in the TV series &quot;The Waltons&quot; from 1972 until his death in 1978.

==Early life==
Geer was born in Frankfort, Indiana, the son of Katherine (née Aughe), a teacher, and Roy Aaron Ghere, a postal worker. His father left the family when he was 11 years old. Will was deeply influenced by his grandfather, who taught him the botanical names of the plants in Indiana, his native state. Will began to be a botanist; he received a master&#x27;s degree in botany at the University of Chicago. He was also a member of the Lambda Chi Alpha fraternity.

==Career==

Anglicizing his name, Will Geer began his acting career touring in tent shows and on riverboats. He worked on several social commentaries for documentaries, including narrating Sheldon Dick&#x27;s &quot;Men and Dust&quot; about silicosis among miners.

He created the role of Mr. Mister in Marc Blitzstein&#x27;s 1937 &quot;The Cradle Will Rock&quot;, played Candy in John Steinbeck&#x27;s theatrical adaptation of his novella &quot;Of Mice and Men&quot; and appeared in numerous plays and revues throughout the 1940s. From 1948 to 1951, he appeared in more than a dozen movies, including &quot;Winchester &#x27;73&quot; (as Wyatt Earp), &quot;Broken Arrow&quot;, and &quot;Comanche Territory,&quot; all in 1950; as well as &quot;Bright Victory&quot; (1951). He became a dedicated activist touring government work camps of the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930s with folk singers such as Burl Ives and Woody Guthrie (whom he introduced to the &quot;People&#x27;s World&quot; and the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;). In 1956, Guthrie and Geer released an album together on Folkways Records, titled &quot;Bound for Glory: Songs and Stories of Woody Guthrie.&quot; In his biography, Harry Hay described Geer&#x27;s activism and their activities while organizing for the strike. Geer introduced Guthrie to Pete Seeger at the &#x27;Grapes of Wrath&#x27; benefit, which he organized in 1940 for migrant farm workers.

Geer acted with the Group Theatre (New York) studying under Harold Clurman, Cheryl Crawford, and Lee Strasberg. Geer acted in radio appearing as Mephistopheles (the devil) in the 1938 and 1944 productions of Norman Corwin&#x27;s &quot;The Plot to Overthrow Christmas&quot;. Geer also acted in the radio soap opera &quot;Bright Horizon&quot;.

===Blacklist===
Geer was a Communist Party member since the 1930s and made “repeated appearances at fundraisers for the American Communist Party” over the years. Because of this, Geer was blacklisted in the early 1950s for refusing to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities. As a result, he appeared in very few films over the next decade. Among those was &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot; (1954). He starred in it; it was produced, directed, and written by blacklisted Hollywood personnel. It told the story of a miners&#x27; strike in New Mexico from a pro-union standpoint. The film was denounced as &quot;subversive&quot;, consequently it faced difficulties during production and in distribution.

===Later years===
In 1951, Geer founded the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum in Topanga, California, with his wife, actress Herta Ware. He combined his acting and botanical careers at the Theatricum, cultivating every plant mentioned in Shakespeare&#x27;s plays. During the late 1950s and early 1960s, he played several seasons at the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Connecticut. He created a second Shakespeare Garden on the theater&#x27;s grounds. By that time, he was working sporadically again on Broadway. In 1964, he was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical for &quot;110 in the Shade&quot;. In 1967, he performed a soliloquy as the prosecutor delivering the closing argument against the two murderers in the film &quot;In Cold Blood&quot;. In 1972, he played the part of Bear Claw in &quot;Jeremiah Johnson&quot;.

In 1972, he was cast as Zebulon Walton, the family patriarch on &quot;The Waltons,&quot; a role he took over from Edgar Bergen. Bergen played the character in the TV movie upon which the series was based. He won an Emmy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series for &quot;The Waltons&quot; in 1975.
When Geer died shortly after completing the sixth season of &quot;The Waltons&quot;, the death of his character was written into the show&#x27;s script. His final episode, the last episode of the 1977–1978 season, showed him reuniting with his onscreen wife Esther (played by Ellen Corby; she had been absent for the entire season due to a stroke). His character was mourned onscreen during the first episode of the 1978–1979 season, titled &quot;The Empty Nest&quot;.

==Personal life==
Geer married actress Herta Ware in 1934; they had three children, Kate Geer, Thad Geer, and actress Ellen Geer. Ware also had a daughter, Melora Marshall, who was an actress, from another marriage. Although he and Ware divorced in 1954, they remained close for the rest of their lives.

In 1932, Geer met Harry Hay at the Tony Pastor Theatre where Geer was working as an actor. They soon became lovers. Geer and Hay participated in a milk strike in Los Angeles. Later in the year, they performed in support of the 1934 West Coast waterfront strike, where they witnessed police firing on strikers and killing two. Geer was a committed communist; Hay later described him as his political mentor. Geer introduced Hay to Los Angeles&#x27; communist community and together they were activists, joining demonstrations for laborers&#x27; rights and the unemployed. Once, they handcuffed themselves to lampposts outside UCLA and handed out leaflets for the American League Against War and Fascism. Geer became a member of the Communist Party of the United States in 1934. After Hay was increasingly political, Geer introduced him to the party. Geer became a reader of the &quot;People&#x27;s World,&quot; a West Coast Communist newspaper.

He maintained a garden at his vacation house, called Geer-Gore Gardens, in Nichols, Connecticut. He was often there and attended the local Fourth of July fireworks celebrations, sometimes wearing a black top hat or straw hat and always his trademark denim overalls with only one suspender hooked. He had a small vacation house in Solana Beach, California, where his front and back yards were cultivated as vegetable gardens rather than lawns.

==Death==
Geer died of respiratory failure at the age of 76 on April 22, 1978 in Los Angeles. As he was dying, his family sang folk songs that he and Woody Guthrie had written, and recited poems by Robert Frost at his bedside. His remains were cremated and his ashes are buried at the Theatricum Botanicum in the Shakespeare Garden in Topanga Canyon, California.

<text>John Meares (c. 1756 – 1809) was an English navigator, explorer, and maritime fur trader, best known for his role in the Nootka Crisis, which brought Britain and Spain to the brink of war.

==Career==
Meares&#x27; father was Charles Meares, &quot;formerly an attorney of great eminence, and for several years pursuivant of his Majesty&#x27;s Court of Exchequer in Dublin&quot;. In 1771, Meares joined the Royal Navy as a captain&#x27;s servant and was commissioned a lieutenant in 1778. In 1783 he joined the merchant service and in 1785, based in India, formed the &quot;Northwest America Company&quot; for collecting sea otter furs by trade with the indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast and selling them in China. The East India Company held a monopoly on British trade in the Pacific and required all British traders to be licensed with the company and pay duties. Meares did not license his ships with the East India Company and instead tried to conceal the illegal activity by using the flag of Portugal. Meares registered his ships in Macau, a Portuguese colony in China. Non-British ships were not required to have licences from the East India Company.

He sailed from Calcutta on 12 March 1786, in the &quot;Nootka&quot;, a vessel of 200 tons (bm), with which he explored part of the coast of Alaska. He spent the winter of 1786–1787 in Prince William Sound with poor provisions; his men suffered from the weather and scurvy. Twenty-three of his men died of scurvy and the remaining ten were saved only by the timely arrival of Captain George Dixon, a British trader with proper licences, in the &quot;Queen Charlotte&quot;. Meares gave Dixon his bond never to trade in the Northwest again, and returned to China by way of the Sandwich Islands. Showing no gratitude to Dixon, Meares proceeded to sue him for allegedly overcharging him for the supplies that saved his life.
In 1788, and in total violation of what he had told Dixon, Meares started a new expedition with two vessels and more false papers. The ships sailed under the Portuguese flag and were given Portuguese names: the &quot;Felice Adventurero&quot;, captained by Meares, and the &quot;Iphigenia Nubiana&quot;, under William Douglas. The names are spelled in various ways, such as &quot;Feliz Aventureira&quot; and &quot;Efigenia Nubiana&quot;. They sailed from China on 22 January 1788 and arrived at Nootka Sound, on Vancouver Island in May. Using Nootka Sound as a base of operations he spent the summer trading for furs along the coasts of present-day British Columbia and Washington down to after having sailed as far south as Cape Lookout, having missed the Columbia River at Cape Disappointment.

On board &quot;Felice Adventurero&quot; for the 1788 voyage from China to Nootka Sound was Comekela, younger brother of Maquinna, chief of the Mowachaht Nuu-chah-nulth people of the Nootka Sound area. Comekela had sailed from Nootka Sound to China in 1786-87 with James Hanna.

Meares later claimed that Maquinna, a chief of the Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) people, sold him some land on the shore of Friendly Cove in Nootka Sound, in exchange for some pistols and trade goods, and that on this land some kind of building was erected. These claims would become a key point in Britain&#x27;s position during the Nootka Crisis. Spain strongly disputed both claims, and the true facts of the matter have never been fully established. Maquinna himself later called Meares a liar and denied selling him any land. The land and building aside, there is no doubt that Meares&#x27; men, and a group of Chinese workers they brought, built the sloop &quot;North West America&quot;. It was launched in September 1788, the first non-Indigenous vessel built in the Pacific Northwest. 

In September Meares left, sailing the &quot;Felice Adventurero&quot; to China. The &quot;Iphigenia Nubiana&quot; and &quot;North West America&quot; wintered in the Hawaiian Islands. While on the island of Kauai, Meares picked up a Hawaiian chief or &quot;prince of Attooi&quot; (Kauai) by the name of Tianna (Kaʻiana – also spelled Tyaana &amp; Tyanna), whom he took aboard his ship. He took Tianna to Guangzhou (Canton), China, where Meares found a Hawaiian woman by the name of Wynee, who had been left there by captain Charles William Barkley of the &quot;Imperial Eagle&quot;. Eventually, Meares returned Tianna to his homeland but Wynee died of illness on the voyage home. Wynee and Tianna are considered the first two Hawaiians to have traveled abroad. Later, Meares gained possession of Barkley&#x27;s nautical gear and his journal. Barkley&#x27;s wife, Frances Barkley, later wrote that Meares, &quot;with the greatest effrontery, published and claimed the merit of my husband&#x27;s discoveries therein contained, besides inventing lies of the most revolting nature tending to vilify the person he thus pilfered.&quot;

During the winter of 1788–89 Meares was in Guangzhou (Canton), China, where he and others formed a partnership called the Associated Merchants Trading to the Northwest Coast of America. Plans were made for more ships to sail to the Pacific Northwest in 1789, including the &quot;Princess Royal&quot;, under Thomas Hudson, and the &quot;Argonaut&quot; under James Colnett. The consolidation of the fur trading companies of Meares and the Etches (King George&#x27;s Sound Company) resulted in James Colnett being given the overall command. Meares instructed Colnett to establish a permanent fur trading post at Nootka Sound based on the foothold accomplished by Meares the year before. The &quot;Iphigenia Nubiana&quot; and &quot;North West America&quot; were to join the &quot;Argonaut&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; at Nootka Sound. Meares himself remained in China.

=== Nootka Crisis ===
While the British fur traders were getting organized, the Spanish were continuing their effort to secure the Pacific Northwest. At first the Spanish were responding mainly to Russian activity in Alaska. On a 1788 voyage to Alaska, Esteban José Martínez had learned that the Russians were intending to establish a fortified outpost at Nootka Sound. This, in addition to the increasing use of Nootka Sound by British fur traders, resulted in the Spanish decision to assert sovereignty on the northwest coast once and for all. Plans were laid for Nootka Sound to be colonized. Spain hoped to establish and maintain sovereignty on the entire coast as far north as the Russia posts in Prince William Sound. The Viceroy of New Spain, Manuel Antonio Flórez, instructed Martínez to occupy Nootka Sound, build some kind of structure, and to make it clear that Spain was setting up a formal establishment.

Martínez arrived at Nootka Sound on 5 May 1789. He found three ships already there. One was Meares&#x27; &quot;Iphigenia Nubiana&quot;. Martínez seized the ship and arrested its captain, William Douglas. After a few days Martínez released Douglas and his ship and ordered him to leave and not return. Douglas heeded the warning. The other two ships were American, the &quot;Columbia Rediviva&quot; and the &quot;Lady Washington&quot;, under John Kendrick and Robert Gray, which had wintered at Nootka Sound. Over the summer a number of other ships arrived. The vessels of Meares&#x27; company were all seized on the grounds of violating Spanish rights of trade and navigation on the coast. The &quot;North West America&quot; was renamed &quot;Santa Saturnina&quot; and used by José María Narváez to explore the Strait of Georgia in 1791.

When news of the seizures reached Meares in China he sailed to England. He arrived in April 1790, confirmed various rumors, claimed to have bought land and built a settlement at Nootka before Martínez, and generally fanned the flames of anti-Spanish feelings. He submitted a report to the Home secretary William Wyndham Grenville, in which he exaggerated the permanence of his settlement in Nootka Sound and the financial losses sustained by his company. In May the issue was taken up in the House of Commons as the Royal Navy began to make preparations for hostilities. An ultimatum was delivered to Spain, who without the support of France, capitulated to British terms. The subsequent Nootka Convention led to George Vancouver&#x27;s historic voyage in .

=== Later life ===
In 1790, Meares published &quot;Voyages Made in the Years 1788 and 1789, from China to the North West Coast of America&quot; in 1790. It gained widespread attention, especially in light of the developing Nootka Crisis. Meares not only described his voyages to the northwest coast, but put forward a grand vision of a new economic network based in the Pacific, joining in trade widely separated regions such as the Pacific Northwest, China, Japan, Hawaii, and England. His vision required a loosening of the monopolistic power of the East India Company and the South Sea Company, which between them controlled all British trade in the Pacific. Meares argued strongly for loosening their power. His vision eventually came to pass, in its general form, but not before the long struggle of the Napoleonic Wars was over. Meares&#x27; &quot;Voyages&quot; also caused a controversy; Meares&#x27; criticisms of George Dixon led the latter to publish a pamphlet about Meares&#x27; self-aggrandizement and false claims of discoveries made by others. Meares&#x27; claim that Captain Robert Gray had circumnavigated Vancouver island was disclaimed by Gray himself. The explorations of Captain George Vancouver disproved a number of Meares&#x27; other claims. Nonetheless, Meares&#x27; claims formed a basis for negotiation of British title to Oregon and British Columbia.

Not much is known of Meares&#x27; life after the settlement of the Nootka controversy. So far as is known he received none of the Spanish indemnity money. He was rewarded for his role by promotion to the rank of commander on 26 February 1795. The marriage of &quot;John Meares Esq. of Frome, [Cornwall], to Miss Mary Anne Guilleband, at the Abbey church, Bath&quot; was noted in &quot;The Whitehall Evening Post&quot; of 9 July 1796. Meares apparently considered Bath his home after his retirement from the Navy, and according to his &quot;last will and testament&quot; he owned property in Jamaica. The death of John Meares, &quot;a Commander in his Majesty’s Navy&quot;, at Bath on 29 January 1809, was noted in a newspaper advertisement by his solicitors inviting his creditors to a meeting at the George and Vulture Tavern, Cornhill, London, to take consideration of the state of his affairs. The value of his estate when probated was estimated to be under £7,500. His will listed no spouse or child, but a brother and sister were among the beneficiaries. Perhaps his wife, the former Mary Ann Guilliband, whom he married in 1796, was already deceased.

<text>Arthur Higelin (born 27 March 1966), better known under his stage name Arthur H (), is a French singer-songwriter and pianist. He is best known in France for his live performances—four of his albums were recorded live.

==Life and career==
He is the son of the French singer Jacques Higelin and Nicole Courtois, and half brother of singers Izïa Higelin and stage and film actor, theatre director and music video director Kên Higelin.

After traveling in the West Indies, he studied music in Boston before returning to Paris and developing his eclectic but highly personal musical style, drawing on such influences as Thelonious Monk, Serge Gainsbourg, the Sex Pistols, jazz, blues, Middle Eastern music and the tango. He first performed in 1988 in clubs in Paris, as leader of a trio with bassist Brad Scott and drummer Paul Jothy.

His first album, &quot;Arthur H&quot; (1990), combined rhythmic experimentation and &quot;bal-musette&quot; elements with a vocal style which has been compared to Tom Waits. He toured widely around this time, particularly in France and Japan, adding a fourth band member, Jon Handelsman (saxophone), and produced a second album, &quot;Bachibouzouk&quot; (1992). In early 1993, he did a six-week season at the Magic Mirrors, an antique circus big top, which was later put on as a touring show and recorded on the live album &quot;En chair et en os&quot;.

In 1996, he released the album &quot;Trouble Fête&quot;, following which he performed a season at the Gymnase in Paris. The live album &quot;Fête Trouble&quot; (1997) included some tracks from these shows as well as others recorded on tour in Africa. He toured the United States and Canada in 1998.

In 2000, he wrote the soundtrack for Michel Couvelard&#x27;s film, &quot;Inséparables&quot;, before touring in Asia and Canada. His next album, &quot;Pour Madame X&quot; (2000), featured the touring band of Nicolas Repac (guitar), Brad Scott (double bass) and Laurent Robin (drums).

In 2001, he took part in the show &quot;Le Cabaret Imprudent&quot; with &quot;Le Cirque Cahin-caha&quot;. The following year, he released the album &quot;Piano Solo&quot;, recorded live in a studio and mainly consisting of solo interpretations of earlier songs. This was followed by a band album, &quot;Négresse Blanche&quot; (2003), comprising tracks dedicated to the memory of famous women such as Marilyn Kaddish and Bo Derek.

In 2005, a planned tour of China was cancelled, and he returned to the studio to record the album &quot;Adieu Tristesse&quot;. This was the most commercially successful of his career, and included several duets, one with his father and another, &quot;Est-ce que tu aimes?&quot;, with the musician -M- (Matthieu Chedid). He subsequently toured widely in France, Lebanon and Canada.

In 2006, he published a book, &quot;Onirique attaque&quot;, containing lyrics, reflections and photographs. He also composed the soundtrack for the film &quot;L&#x27;homme qui rêvait d&#x27;un enfant&quot;, directed by Delphine Gleize. The soundtrack was performed by an ensemble of children from a local music school.

The album &quot;Show Time&quot;, issued late in 2006, was recorded live on tour and includes duets with Matthieu Chedid, Pauline Croze, Lhasa de Sela and Jacques Higelin. In June 2008 he released the album &quot;L&#x27;Homme du Monde&quot;, which won the award of Pop/Rock Album of the Year 2009 at La Victoire de la Musique.

His 2010 double CD, &quot;Mystic Rumba&quot;, contained 24 songs from his repertoire performed solo at the piano, the result in part of a snow storm which cut the power in his studio during recording. The next album, &quot;Baba Love&quot;, was released in October 2011. In 2012, he collaborated with Nicolas Repac on the album &quot;L&#x27;Or Noir&quot;, comprising musical settings of poems by Caribbean writers.

<text>Luigi Palmieri (22 April 1807 – 9 September 1896) was an Italian physicist and meteorologist. He was famous for his scientific studies of the eruptions of Mount Vesuvius, for his researches on earthquakes and meteorological phenomena and for improving the seismograph of the time.

== Biography ==
Palmieri was born in Faicchio, Benevento, Italy and died in Naples, Italy at the age of 89.

Palmieri received a degree in physics from the University of Naples. In 1845, he was made Professor of Physics at the Royal Naval School in Naples and in 1847 was appointed as Chair of Physics at the university. In 1848, he began working at the Vesuvius Observatory and in 1854 was appointed as Director of the Observatory. Using an electromagnetic seismometer for the detection and measurement of ground tremors, Palmieri was able to detect very slight movements in trying to predict volcanic eruptions. Furthermore, he was the first to detect the presence of Helium on Earth on the lava of Mount Vesuvius.

Using a modified Peltier electrometer, he also carried out research in the field of atmospheric electricity. Other scientific contributions included the development of a modified Morse telegraph, and improvements to the anemometer and pluviometer.

<text>The Saxon is an armoured personnel carrier formerly used by the British Army and supplied in small numbers to various overseas organisations. It was developed by GKN Sankey from earlier projects, AT 100 IS and AT104, and was due to be replaced by the Future Rapid Effect System.

==History==

The British Army initially ordered a batch of 47 vehicles in early 1983, with first deliveries taking place in early 1984. 

The second order for the British Army was a batch of 247 vehicles with the option for a further 200, the latter exercised in late 1985. The final deliveries of the 447 vehicles was complete by early 1989.

The Royal Artillery ordered 30 Saxons for use as command post vehicles armed with Rapier missiles. These vehicles were all delivered in early 1987.

In 1990, the British Ministry of Defence placed an order of around 100 vehicles as well an order of Saxon ambulances, with first deliveries taking place in 1991. These vehicles had a number of improvements over earlier models, including a Cummins 6BT 5.91-litre turbocharged six-cylinder diesel engine developing 160 bhp coupled with a fully automatic transmission.

The first operational Saxons were deployed in Germany in 1983, to equip mechanised infantry battalions. The Saxon has now been withdrawn from service in HM Armed Forces, but 147 are kept in storage. The Saxon has been deployed to places such as Bahrain, Brunei, Bosnia, Malaysia, Northern Ireland, Oman, Iraq and Afghanistan.

Seven Saxons were ordered by the Royal Hong Kong Police from GKN Sankey in 1987 and delivered in 1988 where they replaced 15 Saracens. They were assigned to the Police Tactical Unit and remained there until withdrawn in 2009. In the Balkans, Saxons were outfitted with turrets taken from FV432s to serve as an improvised anti-sniper turret.

75 Saxons were sold to Ukraine reportedly under a contract made in 2013, i.e. predating the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War. The Ukrainian military announced the deal on 5 December 2014. The former chief commander of British land forces, Richard Dannatt, said that supplying the vehicles to Ukraine was &quot;immoral&quot; as they were &quot;useless&quot; in high intensity warfare. Most of them were outfitted with DShK and dual PK GPMGs.

In Ukrainian service, the type has seen combat against Russian forces during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. As of May 2024, available video and photographic evidence indicates Ukraine has lost at least 14 Saxons during the invasion, with 8 being captured by Russian forces and 6 being destroyed.

The last reported sighting of a Saxon in Ukrainian service was in January 2024. Due their age and poor condition after eight years of combat use, they have been largely replaced with modern MRAPs provided by the United Kingdom and other allied nations.

==Design==

The Saxon was developed by GKN Defence (now BAE Systems) as the successor of the AT104.

Main improvements over the AT104 include changes in the armoured hull to provide an equal level of protection to the radiator, engine, transmission and crew; a redesigned hull floor to improve protection against landmines; a more powerful diesel engine and a shorter wheelbase for improved mobility and turning.

The hull is all-welded steel with the driver seated at the front on the right side (left-hand drive versions were also available for export) and the personnel compartment in the rear.

The driver can reach his seat from inside the vehicle or by an hatch over his position. There are bulletproof windscreens on the front and both sides.

The commander&#x27;s cupola has four sides each with a vision block and a single-piece hatch cover. A 7.62 mm machine gun can be pintle-mounted if necessary. The commander module can be removed and replaced with another module with a different armament installation.

The personnel sits on padded bench seats located on each side of the vehicle which are equipped with seat belts, and leave by two doors on the rear and a single door in each side of the hull. Each door have a firing port and a vision block. There are additional firing ports in each side of the hull and a single firing port in the left forward side of the vehicle. The interior of the hull is lined with a thick thermal insulation and a forced air circulation system was installed by default on all vehicles.

The armoured hull provides protection against small arms including 7.62 mm armour-piercing rounds, and high-explosive shell fragments up to bursting at from the vehicle. The floor is V-shaped to give maximum protection against mine blasts, except for the axles, which are outside of the armoured compartment.

In British service, each vehicle carried a fully equipped rifle squad of 10. The British Army Saxons originally had a fixed observation cupola for the commander with a socket in each corner of the cupola for a 7.62 mm general-purpose machine gun mount, no door on the left side of the vehicle, and fully enclosed external stowage bins. A total of 515 vehicles were fitted with L8 66 mm smoke grenade launchers.

==Variants==
* Saxon LHD armoured personnel carrier - This variant is fitted with a turret armed with a single or twin 7.62 mm GPMG, with an elevation of 50° and a depression of −15°. It can also be used to deploy and operate remote controlled vehicles for bomb disposal duties. The Jordan Design and Development Bureau (KADDB) was involved in the conversion from right-hand drive to left-hand drive with the first working models presented in 2010.

* Saxon command vehicle - Can be fitted with a turret armed with a single or twin 7.62 mm GPMGs or a .50 (12.7 mm) M2HB heavy machine gun. The interior features individual communication control modules, a mapboard with strip lighting, and a storage space.

* Saxon recovery vehicle - Features a Hudson Wharton capstan hydraulic winch that can lift vehicles weighing up with the help of a block and tackle. In British service it was normally operated by a crew of four. A tent can be erected at the rear so repair work can be carried on in all weathers if required. Standard equipment includes tools, a spotlight, Scotch lorry skid pads and a front and rear differential lock.

*Ambulance - The interior is modified to enable two general service stretchers to be carried on each side of the vehicle, or one patient on a stretcher plus five walking wounded. The crew consists of the commander, driver, and a medical orderly.

*Incident control vehicle- A Saxon fitted with a front-mounted obstacle-clearing blade, cage armour, a turret armed with a machine gun and smoke grenade launchers, and a low light TV surveillance system featuring a telescopic mount on the rear of the vehicle.

*Saxon EOD - Specialized vehicle for bomb disposal.

*Saxon Patrol - The final version of the Saxon to enter service with the British Army, it was used in Northern Ireland. Improvements include replacing the Bedford 6-cylinder diesel with a Cummins 6BT 6-cylinder turbocharged diesel engine, a fully automatic transmission that can use a 4×4 or 4×2 drive depending on the tactical situation. Other improvements include barricade removal devices, roof-mounted searchlights, cage armour, a revised cowl for the armoured radiator cover, improved armour, and an upgraded braking system with run-flat tyres fitted as standard.

<text>Debout Sur Le Zinc is a French music band.

After their first 1999 self-titled album, their subsequent album &quot;L’homme à tue-tête&quot; released in May 2001 gained them media acclaim and public popularity. By the time their 2004 album &quot;Des singes et les moutons&quot; enhanced their repertoire, they were selling out venues such as La Cigale and touring internationally. Songs from their latest album &quot;Les Promesses&quot; were featured in their first concert at the oldest music hall in Paris, the Olympia, where they played to a full house on May 16, 2006.

The band acknowledges influences from traditional French music and Irish music, rock, klezmer, and many styles that are considered dance hall music, such as gypsy jazz, tango, waltz.

==Background==
Debout Sur Le Zinc members have described themselves as an Irish folk group synthesized with a rock band. Simon Mimoun and Olivier Sulpice met Christophe Bastien and Cédric “Momo” Ermolieff in high school. Simon met Fred Trisson at university, and Fred introduced the band to his childhood friend Romain Sassigneux. They began performing together in bars and on the street and with groups such as Garçons Bouchers and Les Ogres de Barback under the name Debout Sur Le Zinc as of 1996. William Lotvi joined as their bass player in 1998.

The idea for the name Debout Sur Le Zinc, literally “standing on the zinc,” originally came after a concert in which Christophe, guitarist/singer was standing on the bar counter playing the accordion. The discovery that the bar or zinc—the material bar countertops were once made of—used to serve as a stage for people to recite poems, sing or make political speeches, and the expression also being in a poem by Jacques Prévert further reinforced the name.

<text>Thomas Emmet Hayden (December 11, 1939October 23, 2016) was an American social and political activist, author, and politician. Hayden was best known for his role as an anti-war, civil rights, and intellectual activist in the 1960s, becoming an influential figure in the rise of the New Left. As a leader of the leftist organization Students for a Democratic Society, he wrote the &quot;Port Huron Statement&quot;, helped lead protests at the 1968 Democratic National Convention, and stood trial in the resulting &quot;Chicago Seven&quot; case.

In later years, he ran for political office numerous times, winning seats in both the California State Assembly and California State Senate. At the end of his life, he was the director of the Peace and Justice Resource Center in Los Angeles County. He was married to Jane Fonda for 17 years and is the father of actor Troy Garity.

==Early life and activism==
Tom Hayden was born in Royal Oak, Michigan, to parents of Irish ancestry, Genevieve Isabelle (née Garity) and John Francis Hayden. His father was a former Marine who worked for Chrysler as an accountant and was also a violent alcoholic. When Hayden was 10, his parents divorced, and his mother raised him. Hayden attended a Catholic elementary school, where he read out loud to nuns and &quot;learned to fear hell.&quot;

Hayden grew up attending a church led by Charles Coughlin, a Catholic priest noted for his anti-Semitic teachings, and who was also known nationally during the time of The Great Depression as the &quot;radio priest&quot;. Hayden&#x27;s dismay with Coughlin caused him to break with the Catholic Church as a teenager.

Hayden attended Dondero High School in Royal Oak, Michigan. He served as the editor for the school newspaper, and in his farewell column in the newspaper, he used the first letter of successive paragraphs to spell &quot;Go to hell&quot;. As a result, when he was graduated in 1956, he was banned from attending his graduation ceremony and only received a diploma.

Hayden then attended the University of Michigan, where he was editor of the &quot;Michigan Daily&quot;. At the National Student Association convention in Minneapolis in August 1960, Hayden witnessed a dramatic intervention by Sandra Cason. To a standing ovation she turned back a motion denying support for sit-ins in the struggle against racial segregation: “I cannot say to a person who suffers injustice, ‘Wait,’ And having decided that I cannot urge caution, I must stand with him.” Alan Haber of the fledgling Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) recruited her on the spot. Stirred by her &quot;ability to think morally [and] express herself poetically,&quot; Hayden soon followed her into the left-wing grouping. They married in October the following year.

Despite being attacked by a mob in McComb, Mississippi, while covering the Freedom Rides for the &quot;National Student News&quot;, Hayden himself became a Freedom Rider. On December 10, 1961, the Haydens participated in one of the many “freedom rides” taking place in response to the 1960 &quot;Boynton v. Virginia&quot; decision. After being arrested for his role in the Freedom Rides, Hayden began writing the SDS manifesto from jail in Albany, Georgia.

==The Port Huron vision and SDS==
Refined and adopted at the first Students for Democratic Society (SDS) convention in June 1962, the &quot;Port Huron Statement&quot; called for a &quot;new left&quot; committed, in the spirit of participatory democracy, to &quot;deliberativeness, honesty [and] reflection.&quot; The sponsoring League for Industrial Democracy (LID) took immediate issue. Although The Statement did express regret at the &quot;perversion of the older left by Stalinism,&quot; it omitted the LID&#x27;s standard denunciation of communism. Hayden was called to a meeting where, refusing any further concession, he clashed with Michael Harrington, as he later would with Irving Howe.

Tom Hayden was elected SDS president for the 1962–1963 academic year, but his wife Sandra Cason &quot;Casey&quot; Hayden left Ann Arbor, and left him, heeding the call to return to the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in Atlanta. She later recalled that in contrast to the interminable debates she had witnessed in Ann Arbor, in SNCC discussions the focus was on action and women had a voice. The Haydens divorced in 1965. That year, with other SNCC women, Casey Hayden coauthored &quot;Sex and Caste&quot; since regarded as a founding document of second-wave feminism.

Convinced, in the words of the Statement, that students must &quot;look outwards to the less exotic but more lasting struggles for justice,&quot; and with $5000 from United Automobile Workers, Hayden&#x27;s first SDS initiative was the Economic Research and Action Project (ERAP). SDS community organizers would help draw white neighbourhoods into an &quot;interacial movement of the poor&quot;. By the end of 1964 ERAP had ten inner-city projects engaging 125 student volunteers.

President of the United Packinghouse Workers of America Ralph Helstein arranged for Hayden to meet with Saul Alinsky. With twenty-five years experience in Chicago and across the country, Alinsky was considered the father of community organizing. To Helstein&#x27;s dismay, Alinsky dismissed Hayden&#x27;s venture into the field as naive and doomed to failure.

Hayden committed himself to the effort. For three years in Newark, he worked with a community union to organize poor black residents to take on slumlords, city inspectors and others. He was there to witness the 1967 Newark Riots which, in &quot;Rebellion in Newark&quot; (1967), he tried to place in a larger social and economic context. His profile in Newark attracted the attention of the FBI. “In view of the fact that Hayden is an effective speaker who appeals to intellectual groups and has also worked with and supported the Negro people in their program in Newark,&quot; agents recommended that he &quot;be placed on the Rabble Rouser Index.” Conservative pundit Jack Cashill who grew up in Newark has noted that speed of publication of &quot;Rebellion in Newark&quot; suggests Hayden&#x27;s book was pre-written before the riots and that deeper forces had worked for years to catalyze the riots.

Hayden was later to suggest that if ERAP across the country had failed to build to greater success (the promised &quot;interracial movement of the poor&quot;) it was because of the escalating U.S. commitment in Vietnam: &quot;Once again the government met an internal crisis by starting an external crisis.&quot;

==Anti-war activist==

In 1965, while still committed in Newark, Hayden, along with Communist Party USA member Herbert Aptheker and Quaker peace activist Staughton Lynd, undertook a controversial visit to North Vietnam. The three toured villages and factories and met with an U.S. Air Force Major Ron Byrne, an American POW whose plane had been shot down and was being held prisoner. The result of this tour of North Vietnam, at a high point in the war, was a book titled &quot;The Other Side&quot;. Staughton Lynd later wrote that the New Left disavowed &quot;the Anti-Communism of the previous generation&quot;, and that Lynd and Hayden had written, in &quot;Studies on the Left&quot;: &quot;We refuse to be anti-Communist. We insist the term has lost all the specific content it once had.&quot;

In 1968, Hayden joined the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam (&quot;the Mobe&quot;) and played a major role in the protests outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, Illinois. The demonstrations were broken up by what the U.S. National Commission on the Causes and Prevention of Violence later described as a police riot. Six months after the convention, he and seven other protesters including Rennie Davis,
Dave Dellinger, Abbie Hoffman, and Jerry Rubin were indicted on federal charges of conspiracy and incitement to riot as part of the &quot;Chicago Eight&quot;, a.k.a. the &quot;Chicago Seven&quot; after Bobby Seale&#x27;s case was separated from the others. Hayden and four others were convicted of crossing state lines to incite a riot, but the charges were later reversed and remanded on appeal. The government did not re-try the case, and thereafter elected to dismiss the substantive charges.

Hayden made several subsequent well-publicized visits to North Vietnam as well as Cambodia during America&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War, which had expanded under President Richard M. Nixon to include the adjoining nations of Laos and Cambodia, although he did not accompany his future wife, actress Jane Fonda, on her especially controversial trip to Hanoi in the summer of 1972. The next year he married Fonda and they had one child, Troy Garity, born on July 7, 1973. In 1974, he appeared in a brief scene as an ER doctor in the film &quot;Death Wish&quot;. In the same year, while the Vietnam War was still ongoing, the documentary film &quot;Introduction to the Enemy&quot;, a collaboration by Fonda, Hayden, Haskell Wexler and others, was released. It depicts their travels through North and South Vietnam in spring 1974.

Hayden also founded the Indochina Peace Campaign (IPC), which operated from 1972 to 1975. The IPC, operating in Boston, New York, Detroit and Santa Clara, mobilized dissent against the Vietnam War and demanded unconditional amnesty for U.S. draft evaders, among other aims. Jane Fonda, a supporter of the IPC, later turned this moniker into a name for her film production firm, IPC Films, which produced in whole or in part, movies and documentaries such as &quot;F.T.A.&quot; (1972), &quot;Introduction to the Enemy&quot; (1974), &quot;The China Syndrome&quot; (1979), &quot;Nine to Five&quot; (1980) and &quot;On Golden Pond&quot; (1981). Hayden and Fonda divorced in 1990.

==New Left legacy==
Writing about Hayden&#x27;s role in the 1960s New Left, Nicholas Lemann, national correspondent for &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, said that &quot;Tom Hayden changed America&quot;, calling him &quot;father to the largest mass protests in American history&quot;, and Richard N. Goodwin, who was a speechwriter for presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and John F. Kennedy, said that Hayden, &quot;without even knowing it, inspired the Great Society.&quot; Staughton Lynd, though, was critical of the &quot;Port Huron&quot; and New Left concept of &quot;participatory democracy&quot;, stating: &quot;We must recognize that when an organization grows to a certain size, consensus decision-making is no longer possible, and some form of representative government becomes necessary.&quot; Nevertheless, his FBI files also showed Hayden held meetings with some people who the New Left opposed, such as Rev. Billy Graham. He also was revealed to have developed a friendship with Robert F. Kennedy, and served as one of the pallbearers for Kennedy&#x27;s casket during his funeral.

==Career in electoral politics==

During 1976, Hayden made a primary election challenge to California U.S. Senator John V. Tunney. &quot;The radicalism of the 1960s is fast becoming the common sense of the 1970s&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported him saying at the time. Starting far behind, Hayden mounted a spirited campaign and finished a surprisingly close second in the Democratic primary. He and Fonda later initiated the Campaign for Economic Democracy (CED), which formed a close alliance with then-Governor Jerry Brown and promoted solar energy, environmental protection and renters&#x27; rights policies, as well as candidates for local office throughout California, more than 50 of whom would go on to be elected.

Hayden later served in the California State Assembly (1982–1992) and the State Senate (1992–2000). During this time, he was frequently protested by conservative groups, including Vietnamese refugees, military veterans, and members of Young Americans for Freedom. He mounted a bid in the Democratic primary for California Governor during 1994 on the theme of campaign finance reform and ran for Mayor of Los Angeles in 1997, losing to incumbent Republican Richard Riordan.

As a member of the State Assembly, Hayden introduced the bill that became Chapter 1238 of the California Statutes of 1987. Chapter 1238 enacted Section 76060.5 of the California Education Code. Section 76060.5 allows the establishment of &quot;student representation fees&quot; at colleges in the California Community Colleges System. The fee has been established at several dozen colleges, and it may be used &quot;to provide support for governmental affairs representatives of local or statewide student body organizations who may be stating their positions and viewpoints before city, county, and district governments, and before offices and agencies of state government&quot;. Student representation fees are used to support the operation of the Student Senate for California Community Colleges.

During 1999, Hayden made a speech for the Seattle WTO protests. During 2001, he unsuccessfully sought election to the Los Angeles City Council. Hayden served as a member of the advisory board for the Progressive Democrats of America, an organization created to increase progressive political cooperation and influence within the Democratic Party. He served on the advisory board of the Levantine Cultural Center, a nonprofit organization founded in Los Angeles in 2001 that champions cultural literacy about the Middle East and North Africa. During January 2008, Hayden wrote an opinion essay for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;&#x27;s website endorsing Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential bid in the Democratic primaries. In that same year, he helped initiate Progressives for Obama (now called Progressive America Rising), a group of political progressives that provided assistance for Obama in his initial presidential campaign.

Hayden was known widely in California as a staunch endorser of animal rights and was responsible for writing the bill popularly known as the Hayden Act, which improved protection of pets and extended holding periods for pets confined as strays or surrendered to shelters.

In 2016, Hayden ran to be one of California&#x27;s representatives to the Democratic National Committee. Though he originally leaned towards Bernie Sanders in the 2016 Democratic Presidential Primary, Hayden later announced he would support Hillary Clinton and cast his vote for her when the primary reached California. He also claimed that he never endorsed Sanders and only supported his campaign with the hope that it would push Clinton&#x27;s policies leftward.

Hayden maintained that he remained radical towards the end of his life, commenting, &quot;I&#x27;m Jefferson in terms of democracy,&quot; he said, &quot;I&#x27;m Thoreau in terms of environment, and Crazy Horse in terms of social movements&quot;. In his last years, however, he also described himself as &quot;an archeological dig&quot;, noting the varied layers to his life, the many publications he produced, and the different ways future researchers would likely interpret his life and work.

==Academic career==

Hayden was a teaching assistant at the University of Michigan Journalism Department in the early 1960s. The Law of the Press was one of the courses he taught. Hayden taught numerous courses on social movements, two at Scripps College—one on the Long War and one on gangs in America—and a course called &quot;From the &#x27;60s to the Obama Generation&quot; at Pitzer College. He also taught at Occidental College and at Harvard University&#x27;s Institute of Politics. He taught a class at University of California, Los Angeles on protests from Port Huron to the present. Hayden taught a class in political science at the University of Southern California during the 1977–78 school year. He was the author or editor of 19 books, including &quot;The Long Sixties: From 1960 to Barack Obama&quot;, &quot;Writings for a Democratic Society: The Tom Hayden Reader&quot;, and his memoir, &quot;Reunion&quot;, and served on the editorial board of &quot;The Nation&quot;. His book &quot;Hell No: The Forgotten Power of the Vietnam Peace Movement&quot;, completed in the months before his death in October 2016, was published on January 31, 2017, by Yale University Press.

During 2007, Akashic Books released Hayden&#x27;s &quot;Ending the War in Iraq&quot;. In a discussion about the book with Theodore Hamm published in the &quot;Brooklyn Rail&quot;, Hayden argues, &quot;The apparatus of occupation is never going to turn into a peacekeeping economic development agency. We need to withdraw our stamp of approval and our tax dollars from supporting the occupation. That doesn&#x27;t mean that there can&#x27;t be some attempts at remedies, but these should never be used as an excuse to stay.&quot;

==Personal life==
He was married to actress and social activist Jane Fonda for 17 years, and was the father of actor Troy Garity. Hayden lived in Los Angeles beginning in 1971 and was married to his third wife, Barbara Williams, at the time of his death. He and Williams adopted a son.

Hayden died at a hospital in Santa Monica, California, on October 23, 2016, aged 76. Williams told &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Hayden had a history of heart problems and his health had declined in the preceding months. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in Santa Monica, where he was the first interment in &quot;Eternal Meadow,&quot; an eco-friendly section. Former U.S. President Bill Clinton memorialized him, saying, &quot;Hillary and I knew him for more than thirty years and valued both his words of support and his criticism.&quot;

<text>George Dixon (1748 – 11 November 1795) was an English sea captain, explorer, and maritime fur trader. George Dixon was &quot;born in Leath Ward, a native of Kirkoswald&quot;. The son of Thomas Dixon, he was baptised in Kirkoswald on 8 July 1748.

He served under Captain Cook in his third voyage, on , as armourer. In the course of the voyage he learned about the commercial possibilities along the North West Coast of America.

History has not served Dixon well; for he is the least known of those who served and or were taught by Captain Cook and is only rarely mentioned in history books. When he is mentioned, he is relegated to a minor figure, overshadowed by the more dramatic figures of Cook and William Bligh, another officer on Cook&#x27;s ill-fated third trip.

In 1782, George Dixon was engaged by William Bolts. The [[George Dixon (Royal Navy officer)|&#x27; newspaper of 29 June 1782 carried a report from Fiume that, &quot;in the early days of this month, Mr. von Bolts, Director of the [[Triestine East India Company]], together with the English captain, Mr. Digson, arrived in this city&quot;. George Dixon wrote in the introduction to his account of the voyage he made for the Etches Company to the North West Coast in 1785–1788:
So early as 1781, William Bolts, Esq; fitted out the Cobenzell, an armed ship of 700 tons, for the North-West Coast of America. She was to have sailed from [[Trieste]] (accompanied by a tender of forty-five tons) under [[Holy Roman Empire|Imperial]] colours, and was equally fitted out for trade or discovery: men of eminence in every department of science were engaged on board; all the maritime Courts of Europe were written to, in order to secure a good reception for these vessels, at their respective ports, and favourable answers were returned; yet, after all, this expedition, so exceedingly promising in every point of view, was overcome by a set of interested men, then in power in Vienna.
The Triestine Society sent the &quot;Cobenzell&quot; in September 1783 on a commercial voyage to the [[Malabar Coast]] and [[China]] by way of the [[Cape of Good Hope]]. After leaving [[Trieste]], she proceeded to [[Marseilles]], where she took in the principal part of her cargo and departed that port in December. Apparently, Bolts still wished to carry out his North West Coast venture in connection with this voyage, and asked George Dixon to participate. However, Dixon went back to England, where he attempted to interest Sir Joseph Banks and English merchants in the North West Coast fur trade. This resulted in the formation of the Etches consortium, of which Dixon became a member with appointment as captain of the &quot;[[Queen Charlotte (1785 ship)|Queen Charlotte]]&quot;. The similarity is notable between the plan of the consortium and that elaborated by Bolts, which was apparently communicated to them by Dixon.

In 1785, Dixon became a partner in Richard Cadman Etches and Company, commonly called the [[King George&#x27;s Sound Company]] to develop fur trade in present-day [[British Columbia]] and [[Alaska]]. In September 1785 Dixon and fellow trader [[Nathaniel Portlock]] sailed from England. Portlock was in command of the larger vessel, the 320-ton [[Builder&#x27;s Old Measurement|bm]] &quot;[[King George (1785 ship)|King George]]&quot;, with a crew of 59. Dixon commanded the 200 ton (bm) &quot;[[Queen Charlotte (1785 ship)|Queen Charlotte]]&quot;, with a crew of 33. Dixon and Portlock sailed together for most of their three-year voyage.

In the summers of 1786 and 1787, Dixon explored the shores of present-day [[British Columbia]] and southeastern Alaska. He spent the intervening winter in the [[Hawaiian Islands]], where he became the first European to visit the island of [[Molokai|Molokai]]. He anchored in [[Kealakekua Bay]], where Cook had been killed, but did not come ashore.

His chief areas of exploration were [[Haida Gwaii]] and [[Queen Charlotte Sound (Canada)|Queen Charlotte Sound]], [[Yakutat Bay]] (Port Mulgrave), [[Sitka Sound]] (Norfolk Bay), and the [[Dixon Entrance]]. While not the first European to explore the region of Haida Gwaii, he was the first to realize they were islands and not part of the mainland. On the northwestern part of [[Graham Island]] he acquired a large number of sea otter cloaks in trade with the Haida of [[Kiusta]], under Chief [[Cuneah]]. Because of the many cloaks, he named the bay where he anchored &quot;[[Cloak Bay]]&quot;.

After visiting China and selling his cargo, he returned to England in 1788 and published, in 1789, &quot;A Voyage Round the World, but More Particularly to the North-West Coast of America&quot;.
The book was a collection of descriptive letters by William Beresford, his cargo officer, and valuable charts and appendices by Dixon.

There was a controversy between Dixon and [[John Meares]], another explorer who had published a book claiming credit for discoveries Dixon thought were made by others. This controversy resulted in three pamphlets by Dixon and Meares denouncing each other.

In 1789 Dixon met with Alexander Dalrymple, the Examiner of Sea Journals for the East India Company and an influential advocate of maritime exploration, and the Under-Secretary of the Home and Colonial Office, Evan Nepean. He urged on Nepean the need to take up Dalrymple&#x27;s plan for a settlement on the North West Coast to prevent the Russians, Americans or Spanish from establishing themselves there. Dixon was afraid that if nothing was done the coast and its trade would be lost to Britain. On 20 October 1789, he wrote to Sir Joseph Banks regarding the expedition being fitted out under the command of his former shipmate, [[Henry Roberts (Royal Navy officer)|Henry Roberts]], for discovery in the South Seas. He offered suggestions on the type of vessels that would be suitable and proposed the Queen Charlotte Islands as the best place to form a settlement on the North West Coast.

There was a George Dixon who taught navigation at [[Gosport]], [[England]] and wrote a treatise entitled &quot;The Navigator&#x27;s Assistant&quot; in 1791. This may or may not be the same George Dixon.

Dixon arrived in Bermuda with his wife, Ann, via New York in February 1794. His intention was to revert to his original training and work as a silversmith/jeweller. This is borne out by an advertisement in &quot;[[The Bermuda Gazette]]&quot; in April 1794 announcing his intentions: &quot;George Dixon, jeweller from London&quot;. &quot;The Bermuda Gazette&quot; soon reported that Dixon&#x27;s wife Ann, &quot;lately from England&quot;, died in childbirth in May 1794: she was buried at St George, Bermuda on 20 May 1794. Dixon was left with his only child, Marianna. He himself died shortly afterwards on 11 November 1795, as confirmed by a notice in the &quot;Cumberland Pacquet&quot; in February 1796: &quot;[died] November 11 at Bermuda, Capt Dixon, the circumnavigator, a native of Kirkoswald in this county&quot;. The orphaned Marianna Dixon married a Bermudian merchant, Charles Bryan Hayward, in 1814.

<text>Gervasio Deferr Ángel (born 7 November 1980) is a retired gymnast from Spain who competed at three Olympic Games. He became the Olympic champion in men&#x27;s vault at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney (scored 9.712) and repeated the feat at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens (scoring 9.737 average — vault 1 scored 9.687; vault 2 scored 9.787). Each of his ankles show a tattoo with the logo of one of these two Olympic Games. At the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, he won the silver medal on the floor exercise with a score of 15.775.

Deferr started in gymnastics at the age of five. He considered floor exercise as his favorite event and has had some success in major competitions. He finished in second place with the silver medal on floor at the 1999 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships with a score of 9.750 points, which he repeated eight years later with another silver medal at the 2007 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships, as well as many medals in the same apparatus in the Gymnastics World Cup, between them: World Cup 2000 in Ljubljana, Slovenia — 9.688 points (silver), or World Cup 2001 in Paris, France — 9.625 points (gold). He also finished second at the 2002 World Championships on floor exercise but the medal was taken away after he tested positive for marijuana.

In January 2011, Deferr announced his retirement.

== History ==

Prior to European settlement, Mira Mesa was inhabited by the Kumeyaay peoples who lived along Penasquitos Creek.

After Mexican independence, the land became part of the Rancho Santa Maria de Los Peñasquitos land grant to Francisco María Ruiz in 1823.

Around the time of World War II the area now called Mira Mesa was used by the United States Army as a test area. Just west of U.S. Route 395 (now Interstate 15) was a Navy auxiliary landing field, known locally as Hourglass Field because the layout of the runways was a single piece of asphalt in the shape of an hourglass. The Navy also used the surrounding area as a bombing range.

Starting in 1969 there was a housing boom in the area that now extends from the I-15 freeway in the east to I-805 in the west and is approximately 10,500 acres (42 km2). This was one of the earliest areas of urban sprawl along the I-15 Corridor. Hourglass Field became the site of San Diego Miramar College and Hourglass Field Community Park. The area was built so quickly that it lacked schools, shopping centers, or other services for its thousands of residents. In 1971 Pete Wilson started his political career running for mayor with the slogan &quot;No more Mira Mesas!&quot; as a promise to stop quick, unplanned growth in San Diego.

Since its inception, Mira Mesa was largely influenced by the military located at the adjacent NAS Miramar. Mira Mesa was the northernmost &quot;real community&quot; of San Diego, and was separated from the rest of the city by NAS Miramar for many years.

By the late-1990s, the Mira Mesa area had undergone extensive expansion to accommodate the thousands of new residents attracted by its proximity to major employers like the University of California, San Diego, Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, Qualcomm, and dozens of biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Several commercial and industrial centers have been built within the Mira Mesa area.

== Demographics ==
Mira Mesa has about 80,000 residents, including students, families, and single people. There are over 23,000 homes in the community, averaging 3.09 people per household. The median age is 32.4 years.

<doc id="924242" wikidata="Q1452181" url="?curid=924242" title="Murga">
<text>Murga is a form of popular musical theatre performed in Argentina, Panama, Spain and Uruguay during the Carnival season. Murga groups also operate in the Buenos Aires Carnival, though to a lesser extent than in Montevideo; the Argentinian murga is more centred on dancing and less on vocals than the Uruguayan one. Uruguayan murga has a counterpart in Cadiz, Spain from which it is derived, the chirigota, but over time the two have diverged into distinct forms.

==Types of murga==
===Argentine murga===
Argentine murga is part of the cultural heritage of Buenos Aires, where it is almost exclusively performed. It has considerable influence from candombe and other African dances and music. &quot;Murga porteña&quot; places a considerable emphasis on dance and instrumentals, more so than lyrics (in contrast to Uruguayan murga). Performances take place in the form of parades (known as &quot;corsos&quot;) across the various neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires; some groups feature not only dancers and musicians but also jugglers, stilts, flagbearers, and other types of visually stimulating elements. &quot;Corsos&quot; take place throughout the year, but are recurrent during carnival season in February.

A very famous song involving a Murga is the song &quot;El Matador&quot; by Los Fabulosos Cadillacs. It also incorporates the use of a whistle, a very common element in the Argentine Murga.

===Panamanian murga===
Panamanian murga was pioneered by Manuel Consuegra Gómez in the mid-20th century; Consuegra Gómez mixed traditional carnival rhythms that existed in Las Tablas and Chitré with larger orchestra-style ensembles. The style was referenced in Héctor Lavoe and Willie Colón&#x27;s song &quot;La Murga de Panamá&quot;.
===Uruguayan murga===

Uruguayan murga is typically performed in Montevideo. Uruguayan murga performances feature up to 17 performers, usually men. In the period preceding Carnival, which takes place from late January to early March in Uruguay, each group will prepare a musical play consisting of a suite of songs and recitative (heightened speech) lasting around 45 minutes. This suite will be performed on community stages known as &quot;tablados&quot;, set up in Montevideo&#x27;s various neighbourhoods, throughout the Carnival period. Groups also vie against one another in a prestigious official competition. 

Lyrical content is based on a particular theme, chosen by the group, which serves to provide commentary on events in Uruguay or elsewhere over the preceding year. Consequently, murga lends itself well to being used as a form of popular resistance. For example, during the dictatorship in Uruguay in the 1970s, groups like became known for their left-wing tendencies, subversive commentary and oppositional stance.

A traditional murga group is composed of a chorus and three percussionists and this is the type of murga performed on stages at Carnival. The singers perform in polyphony using up to five vocal parts. Vocal production tends to be nasal and loud with little variation in volume. The percussion instruments, derived from the European military band, are &quot;bombo&quot; (a shallow bass drum worn at the waist and played horizontally), &quot;redoblante&quot; (snare drum) and &quot;platillos&quot; (clash cymbals). The two most important pieces of the performance are the opening song (&quot;saludo&quot;) and the exit song (&quot;retirada&quot; or &quot;despedida&quot;). These get played on the radio during the Carnival period and some of them, such as the Saludo Araca La Cana 1937, are cherished by Uruguayans as cultural icons.

&quot;Murguistas&quot; dress in elaborate, colourful, jester-like costumes. Staging is sparse with minimal use of props. The singers tend to be foregrounded with the percussionists at the back or off to the side of the stage.

The musical style or rhythmic structures of the murga is sometimes incorporated into Uruguayan popular music. Examples of artists who have included murga in their arrangements are Jaime Roos, Rubén Rada, No Te Va Gustar, Máximo Diego Pujol , and Alejandro Balbis. It has also been incorporated by some Argentine artists, such as Bersuit Vergarabat, Los Auténticos Decadentes, and Los Fabulosos Cadillacs.

<doc id="924253" wikidata="Q762891" url="?curid=924253" title="Mid-engine design">
<text>In automotive engineering, a mid-engine layout describes the placement of an automobile engine in front of the rear-wheel axles, but behind the front axle.

==History==
The mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive format can be considered the original layout of automobiles. A 1901 Autocar was the first gasoline-powered automobile to use a drive shaft and placed the engine under the seat. This pioneering vehicle is now in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution.

==Benefits==
Mounting the engine in the middle instead of the front of the vehicle puts more weight over the rear tires, so they have more traction and provide more assistance to the front tires in braking the vehicle, with less chance of rear-wheel lockup and less chance of a skid or spin out. If the mid-engine vehicle is also rear-drive the added weight on the rear tires can also improve acceleration on slippery surfaces, providing much of the benefit of all-wheel-drive without the added weight and expense of all-wheel-drive components. The mid-engine layout makes ABS brakes and traction control systems work better, by providing them more traction to control. The mid-engine layout may make a vehicle safer since an accident can occur if a vehicle cannot stay in its own lane around a curve or is unable to stop quickly enough. Mid-engine design is also a way to provide additional empty crush space in the front of the automobile between the bumper and the windshield, which can then be designed to absorb more of the impact force in a frontal collision in order to minimize penetration into the passenger compartment of the vehicle.

In most automobiles, and in sports cars especially, ideal car handling requires balanced traction between the front and rear wheels when cornering, in order to maximize the possible speed around curves without sliding out. This balance is harder to achieve when the heavy weight of the engine is located far to the front or far to the rear of the vehicle. Some automobile designs strive to balance the fore and aft weight distribution by other means, such as putting the engine in the front and the gearbox and battery in the rear of the vehicle.

Another benefit comes when the heavy mass of the engine is located close to the back of the seats. It makes it easier for the suspension to absorb the force of bumps so the riders feel a smoother ride. But in sports cars, the engine position is once again used to increase performance and the potentially smoother ride is usually more than offset by stiffer shock absorbers.

This layout also allows the motor, gearbox, and differential to be bolted together as a single unit. Together with independent suspension on the driven wheels, this removes the need for the chassis to transfer engine torque reaction.

==Drawbacks==

The largest drawback of mid-engine cars is restricted rear or front (in the case of front-mid layouts) passenger space; consequently, most mid-engine vehicles are two-seat vehicles. The engine in effect pushes the rear passenger seats forward towards the front axle (if the engine is behind the driver). Exceptions typically involve larger vehicles of unusual length or height in which the passengers can share space between the axles with the engine, which can be between them or below them, as in some vans, large trucks, and buses. The mid-engine layout (with a horizontal engine) was common in single-decker buses in the 1950s and 1960s, e.g. the AEC Reliance. The Ferrari Mondial is to date the only successful example of a true mid-engined convertible with seating for 4 and sports car/supercar performance. A version of the Lotus Evora with a removable roof panel is anticipated but no definite date is known.

Like any layout where the engine is not front-mounted and facing the wind, the traditional &quot;engine-behind-the-passengers&quot; layout makes engine cooling more difficult. This has been a problem in some cars, but this issue seems to have been largely solved in newer designs. For example, the Saleen S7 employs large engine-compartment vents on the sides and rear of the bodywork to help dissipate heat from its very high-output engine.

Mid-engined cars are more dangerous than front-engined cars if the driver loses control - although this may be initially harder to provoke due to the superior balance - and the car begins to spin. The moment of inertia about the center of gravity is low due to the concentration of mass between the axles (similar to standing in the middle of a playground roundabout, rather than at the edge) and the spin will occur suddenly, the car will rotate faster and it will be harder to recover from. Conversely, a front-engined car is more likely to break away in a progressive and controllable manner as the tires lose traction.

==Variations==
Super, sport, and race cars frequently have a mid-engined layout, as these vehicles&#x27; handling characteristics are more important than other requirements, such as usable space. In dedicated sports cars, a weight distribution of about 50% front and rear is frequently pursued, to optimise the vehicle&#x27;s driving dynamics – a target that is typically only achievable by placing the engine somewhere between the front and rear axles. Usually, the term &quot;mid-engine&quot; has been primarily applied to cars having the engine located between the driver and the &quot;rear&quot; drive axles. This layout is referred to as rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive, (or RMR) layout. The mechanical layout and packaging of an RMR car are substantially different from that of a front-engine or rear-engine car.

When the engine is in front of the driver, but fully &quot;behind&quot; the front axle line, the layout is sometimes called a front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive, or FMR layout instead of the less-specific term front-engine; and can be considered a subset of the latter. In-vehicle layout, FMR is substantially the same as FR, but handling differs as a result of the difference in weight distribution. 

Some vehicles could be classified as FR or FMR depending on the factory-installed engine (I4 vs I6). Historically most classical FR cars such as the Ford Models T and A would qualify as an FMR engine car. Additionally, the distinction between FR and FMR is a fluid one, depending on the degree of engine protrusion in front of the front axle line, as manufacturers mount engines as far back in the chassis as possible. Not all manufacturers use the Front-Mid designation.

==Examples==

===FM4 layout – &quot;Front Mid-engine / Four-wheel drive&quot;===

This layout, similar to the above FMR layout, with the engine between driver and the front axle, adds front-wheel drive to become a four-wheel drive. An engineering challenge with this layout is getting the power to the front wheels past the engine - this would normally involve raising the engine to allow a propshaft to pass under the engine, or in the case of the Ferrari FF taking power from both ends of the crankshaft with two separate gearboxes.

===FMF layout – &quot;Front Mid-engine / Front-wheel drive&quot;===
These cars are &quot;mid-ship engined&quot; vehicles, but they use front-wheel drive, with the engine in front of the driver. It is still treated as an FF layout, though, due to the engine&#x27;s placement still being in the front of the car, contrary to the popular belief that the engine is placed in front of the rear axle with power transferred to the front wheels (an RMF layout). In most examples, the engine is longitudinally mounted rather than transversely as is common with FF cars.

<text>Kjell Höglund (born 8 December 1945 in Östersund, Sweden) is a Swedish singer-songwriter.

Höglund, who found his musical breakthrough in the 1970s, is in his native country renowned for his mixture of realism, absurdism and surrealism in his lyrics. He made 14 albums between 1971 and 2006, in addition to the two album collections &quot;Glöd&quot; (1988) and &quot;Lokomotiv&quot; (1994).

In 1992 he was nominated for a Grammis award for best male pop.

Kjell Höglund has also published books with esoteric and pseudo-scientific content. 
Many of Höglund&#x27;s beliefs presented in these works are similar to those of the Danish new age mystic Martinus.

<doc id="924255" wikidata="Q1568076" url="?curid=924255" title="Second line (parades)">
<text>The second line is a tradition in parades organized by Social Aid and Pleasure Clubs (SAPCs) with brass band parades in New Orleans, Louisiana, United States. The &quot;main line&quot; or &quot;first line&quot; is the main section of the parade, or the members of the SAPC with the parading permit as well as the brass band. The second line consists of people who follow the band to enjoy the music, dance, and engage in community. The second line&#x27;s style of traditional dance, in which participants dance and walk along with the SAPCs in a free-form style with parasols and handkerchiefs, is called &quot;second-lining&quot;. It is one of the most foundationally Black American–retentive cultures in the United States. It has been called &quot;the quintessential New Orleans art form – a jazz funeral without a body&quot;. Another significant difference from jazz funerals is that second line parades lack the slow hymns and dirges played at funerals (although some organizations may have the band play a solemn selection toward the start of the parade in memory of members who died since their last parade).

==Origins==
The second line has its origins in traditional West African circle or ring dances. The second line tradition was brought to New Orleans by enslaved Africans, where it became a ritual for African Americans, especially in various processions, including funerals. Some scholars believe that the West African ring featured children drumming with adults dancing that in turn, forced the ring to straighten into a line. Others note the similarity of the steps – exaggerated, stylistic strutting – to dances performed in Congo Square by the enslaved given the day off on Sundays. These dances were officially banned for a time because they were deemed threatening to the white inhabitants of the city, and their resurgence in the second line culture suggests a similar celebration of individual freedom.

An article from &quot;New Orleans&quot; states that the history of second line traditions in New Orleans&#x27; Black neighborhoods began during the era of enslavement. Enslaved and free Black people began second lines as neighborhood celebrations. &quot;The neighborhood organizations offered social aid to freed slaves, such as loans and insurance, and used the second-lines as a form of advertising. Second lines were also used to honor members who died in their community, which launched the idea of second lines at funerals. Often, Mardi Gras Indians were and still are included in the procession.&quot;

African and African-American traditions continued throughout the &quot;Code Noir&quot; and Jim Crow eras in New Orleans. African-Americans formed Benevolent Societies and &quot;Social, Aid &amp; Pleasure Clubs&quot; because white insurance companies often refused to cover free people of color and/or the formerly enslaved. SAPCs assisted members through illness and supported families with burial costs for deceased members. This is a carry-over from African traditions that believed in celebrating the member&#x27;s spirit leaving the body to return to the ancestors and God. This led to what became known as a &quot;jazz funeral&quot;, with the SAPC members marching in a dirge with a brass band before the deceased body being &quot;cut loose&quot; and a celebratory parade begins. The same club exercised their social aspect with a colorful, annual, public second line parade through their home community.

==Second line drumming==

A second line snare drummer commonly follows the brass band, playing off the marching beat with improvised polyrhythmic figures that can inspire second line dancers or, if the band is improvising, the band itself. Second line drumming styles became a feature of early jazz drumming and the New Orleans Rhythm and Blues of the 1950s. The Rebirth Brass Band and the Dirty Dozen Brass Band feature traditional second line drumming styles. Drummers such as Billy Higgins and Idris Muhammad adapted second line drum figures to modern jazz.

==Modern second lining==
Second line parades are part of the cultural heritage of New Orleans.

The locally best known second line parades are held by clubs and benevolent organizations. Some have long histories; the oldest such organization still holding regular parades is the Young Men Olympian Junior Benevolent Association, founded in 1884. During the &quot;second line season&quot;, lasting most of the year with breaks for holidays (including Mardi Gras) and the hottest part of summer, there are second line parades most Sundays. Longer parades often make stops, commonly at bars, where refreshments have been arranged for members and those following the parade for fun can purchase something. There are often vendors selling soft drinks, beer, and street food, including barbecue and yaka mein.

Additional second lines, large or small, may be held for any event which people think merits hiring a parading band for such a style of celebration, including weddings and opening of businesses.

The historic predominantly African-American neighborhoods of Tremé and Central City are most strongly associated with the traditions, though second lines can often be seen in the Seventh Ward, Uptown, Marigny, Ninth Ward, Mid-City, and at least on occasion in most of the older neighborhoods of the city. The New Orleans Jazz &amp; Heritage Festival holds second lines at the Fair Grounds each day of the festival to give visitors a taste of this New Orleans tradition.

A second line parade was featured in the 1973 James Bond film &quot;Live and Let Die&quot;. In 2010, the opening scene in the pilot episode, as well as the season one finale of the HBO series &quot;Tremé&quot; featured a second line parade and journalists championed second line culture. The second line culture has maintained a dedicated, organized schedule throughout the history of SAPCs in New Orleans with clubs enjoying annual parades on their selected dates with those events contributing to the local economy. The clubs never lost their African-based traditions and mores and immediately restored their scheduled parades as soon as New Orleans reopened to its citizens after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina. The Black Men of Labor held the first SAPC second line parade in October 2005. New residents of New Orleans embraced the second line tradition and parade routes were publicized online inviting outsiders to participate.

Second line parades have been taking place since the late 1800s, and with innumerable SAPC events and jazz funerals, the sheer number of events with thousands of people since that time have been lively, fun and memorable, with most taking place without incident. Violence has marred some parades in recent years, including the May 12, 2013 Mother&#x27;s Day Parade shooting where 19 were wounded and one was trampled. On November 17, 2024, two people were killed and 11 others were injured in two separate shooting incidents that took place 45 minutes apart at second line parades in the St. Roch neighborhood.

===Other places===
This African-culture-based/New Orleans phenomenon, has been captured and presented in other parts of the country; the HONK! Festival in Somerville, Massachusetts was started by the second line Social Aid and Pleasure Society Brass Band. Asheville, North Carolina has the Asheville second line Band, which marches at parades and other local events. Oakland, California has a growing Mardi Gras celebration including parades organized by the Oakland second line Project and the Brass Boppers. In Duluth, Minnesota The Magic Smelt Puppet Troupe hosts their annual &quot;Run, Smelt, Run!&quot; second line parade every spring to celebrate the smelt run.

&quot;The second line&quot; – the magazine of the New Orleans jazz club, started in 1950 – took its name from the second lining tradition, which by that time included fans of jazz music, both black and white.

<text>Igor Cassina (; born 15 August 1977) is an Italian gymnast. He is a three-time Olympian and won gold in the men&#x27;s horizontal bar at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens.

==Biography==
At the 2004 Summer Olympics, his competition saw a crowd protest over a low score for a routine by Alexei Nemov of Russia, which lasted for fifteen minutes until the score was raised. Despite this atmosphere, Cassina performed his exercise without major error, and he took the gold medal over Paul Hamm of the U.S., even though they tied. This gold was also the 500th Italian medal at the Summer Olympics. At the 2008 Summer Olympics he was 4th in the man&#x27;s horizontal bar.

At the World Gymnastics Championships, he won the silver medal in Anaheim 2003 and the bronze in London 2009. At the European Gymnastics Championships, he won silver in Patras 2002 and Debrecen 2005 and bronze in Amsterdam 2007, always on the horizontal bar. Before winning the Olympic gold, Cassina had already made gymnastics history as the first to perform a giant Kovacs straight with 1/1 turn (also known as a Kõlman in the straight position), which the International Gymnastics Federation named Cassina after him as of 2002.

<doc id="924260" wikidata="Q1648086" url="?curid=924260" title="Nootka Convention">
<text>The Nootka Sound Conventions were a series of three agreements between the Kingdom of Spain and the Kingdom of Great Britain, signed in the 1790s, which averted a war between the two countries over overlapping claims to portions of the Pacific Northwest coast of North America.

==Claims of Spain==
The claims of Spain dated back nearly 300 years to the papal bull of 1493 that, along with the following Treaty of Tordesillas, defined and delineated a zone of Spanish rights exclusive of Portugal. In relation to other states the agreement was legally ineffective (&quot;res inter alios acta&quot;). Spain interpreted it in the widest possible sense, deducing that it gave them full sovereignty. Other European powers did not recognize the &quot;Inter caetera&quot;, and even Spain and Portugal only adhered to it when it was useful and convenient. Britain&#x27;s claims to the region were dated back to the voyage of Sir Francis Drake in 1579, and also by right of prior discovery by Captain James Cook in 1778, although the Spanish had explored and claimed the region in 1774, under Juan Pérez, and in 1775, under Bruno de Heceta and Bodega y Quadra.

==Disputed sovereignty==
The Nootka Sound dispute began in 1789 when Spain sent José Martínez to occupy Nootka Sound and establish exclusive Spanish sovereignty. During the summer of 1789 a number of fur trading vessels, British and American, arrived at Nootka. A conflict over sovereignty arose between the captain of the British &quot;Argonaut&quot;, James Colnett, and Martínez. By the end of the summer Martínez had arrested Colnett, seized several British ships, and arrested their crews. Colnett had come to Nootka Sound intending to build a permanent trading post and colony on land previously acquired by his business associate John Meares. At the end of the summer Martínez abandoned Nootka and took the captured ships and prisoners to San Blas, New Spain. The news about these events triggered a confrontation between Spain and Britain known as the Nootka Crisis, which nearly led to war.

==Nootka Conventions==
The Nootka Conventions of the 1790s, carried out in part by George Vancouver and his Spanish counterpart Juan Francisco de la Bodega y Quadra, prevented the dispute from escalating to war. The first Convention was signed on October 28, 1790. and was purposefully vague. Its preamble contained the statement, &quot;setting aside all retrospective discussions of the rights and pretensions of the two parties&quot;. Its first article said that all &quot;the buildings and tracts of land&quot; at Nootka Sound that had been seized by Martínez would be restored to Britain. For this purpose Vancouver and Bodega y Quadra were sent to Nootka Sound in 1792. However, no buildings had been seized and Bodega y Quadra said no land had been acquired by the British, as attested by the indigenous chief Maquinna as well as the American traders Robert Gray and Joseph Ingraham, who were present in 1789. Vancouver was unwilling to accept Bodega y Quadra&#x27;s various counter-offers and the whole matter was sent back to the British and Spanish governments.

=== First Nootka Convention ===
The plays a role in the disputed sovereignty of the Falkland Islands between the United Kingdom and Argentina. Article VI provided that neither party would form new establishments on any of the islands adjacent to the east and west coasts of South America then occupied by Spain. Both retained the right to land and erect temporary structures on the coasts and islands for fishery-related purposes. However, there was an additional secret article that stipulated that Article VI shall remain in force only so long as no establishment shall have been formed by the subjects of any other power on the coasts in question. This secret article had the same force as if it were inserted in the convention. The Nootka Convention&#x27;s applicability to the Falklands dispute is controversial and complicated. The United Provinces of the Río de la Plata was not a party to the convention. Therefore, it is defined in the convention as &#x27;other power&#x27; and the occupation of the settlement (at Port Louis) by subjects of any other power negated Article VI and allowed Great Britain to re-assert prior sovereignty and form new settlements.

=== Second Nootka Convention ===
The , known as the Nootka Claims Convention, was signed in February 1793 and awarded compensation to John Meares for the Spanish seizure of his ships at Nootka in 1789.

=== Third Nootka Convention ===
The , also known as the Convention for the Mutual Abandonment of Nootka, was signed on January 11, 1794. It called for the mutual abandonment of Nootka Sound. Britain and Spain were both free to use Nootka Sound as a port and erect temporary structures, but, &quot;neither ... shall form any permanent establishment in the said port or claim any right of sovereignty or territorial dominion there to the exclusion of the other. And Their said Majesties will mutually aid each other to maintain for their subjects free access to the port of Nootka against any other nation which may attempt to establish there any sovereignty or dominion&quot;.

==Unresolved borders==
Although the Nootka Crisis originally revolved around the issue of sovereignty and the northern limits of New Spain, the basic issues were left unresolved. Both sides took up positions regarding the border, with Britain desiring it set just north of San Francisco and Spain at the Strait of Juan de Fuca. After Vancouver rejected Bodega&#x27;s proposal of the Strait of Juan de Fuca the border question was not again addressed and instead left unspecified. The third convention addressed the issue of sovereignty only for the port of Nootka Sound itself.

==U.S. claims==
The fledgling United States had no claim in this area at the time of the first Nootka Convention. US claims in the region began with Robert Gray&#x27;s Columbia River expedition. They were strengthened and enlarged by the Lewis and Clark Expedition and the establishment of Fort Astoria by the Pacific Fur Company. The Spanish claims to the Pacific Northwest were acquired by the United States by the Adams-Onís Treaty, signed in 1819. The United States government argued that it had acquired a right of exclusive sovereignty from Spain. This position led to a dispute with Britain known as the Oregon boundary dispute. This dispute was not resolved until the signing of the Oregon Treaty in 1846, which divided the disputed territory and established what later became the international boundary between Canada and the United States.

Although the Nootka Conventions theoretically opened the Pacific Northwest coast from northern California to Alaska to British settlement, the advent of the Napoleonic Wars distracted any efforts towards this (as recommended by Vancouver at the time) and the proposed colony in the region was to be abandoned, The Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, the remaining British presence in the region, was averse to settlement and any economic activity other than its own, such that settlement and resource development did not take place to any degree until the Fraser Canyon Gold Rush of 1858, which formalized British claims on the mainland still residual from the Nootka Conventions into the Colony of British Columbia.

<text>Meseret Defar Tola (Amharic: መሠረት ደፋር; born 19 November 1983) is an Ethiopian long-distance runner who competes chiefly in the 3,000 metres and 5,000 metres events. She has won medals at top-tier international competitions including Olympic and World Championship gold medals over 5,000 metres. She broke the world record in the event in 2006, broke it again in 2007 and held it until 2008, when fellow Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba beat her time.

In 2007 on a track in Brussels Belgium, she became the only woman with a 2-mile run in less than 9 minutes (8:58.58). This was an improvement on the world record by 11 seconds.

Defar has been successful in the 5,000 m at the Olympic Games, taking gold at the 2012 London Olympics and 2004 Athens Olympics and bronze at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. She has experienced similar success in the World Championships, taking silver in the 2005 Helsinki Championships and gold at the 2007 Osaka Championships.

Defar held the indoor records for the 5000 metres, 3,000 metres and two-mile run. She has dominated the 3,000 m indoor event, winning four consecutive gold medals at the IAAF World Indoor Championships from 2004 to 2010. She is also a two-time champion at the All-Africa Games, a four-time medalist at the African Championships and a two-time gold medalist at the World Junior Championships.

Defar took a break from competition in 2014 in order to start a family. She vowed to return by 2015 although she did not compete in the August World Championships in Beijing.

==Career==

===Olympics===
Defar won the 5,000 metres gold medal at the inaugural Afro-Asian Games in 2003. She won gold medals in the women&#x27;s 5,000 metres at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens with a time of 14:45.65 and 5,000 metres at the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. She also won a bronze medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, which was upgraded to a silver medal after the disqualification of Turkish athlete Elvan Abeylegesse.

===World Records===
On 3 June 2006 she ran the 5,000 metres in New York City in a then-world record time of 14:24.53 – she subsequently improved the record to 14:16.63 at the Bislett Games in Oslo on 15 June 2007.
On 3 February 2007 she ran the 3,000 metres indoor in Stuttgart (Germany) in a world record time of 8:23.72.
On 20 May 2007 she ran the 2 mile in Carson, California in a world best time of 9:10.47.
On 1 September 2007 she won gold in 14:57.91 at 5,000 m at the 2007 World Championships in Osaka, to go along with her Olympic victory and world record.
On 14 September 2007, she set a world best (8:58.58) in the women&#x27;s at the Van Damme Memorial meet, shaving 11.89 seconds off the 9:10.47 mark she set in May at Carson, California. Also in 2007, Defar won the female IAAF World Athlete of the Year award.

===World Championships===
She won a silver medal at the 2005 World Championships in Helsinki, losing only to Tirunesh Dibaba.
In 2006, she won the World Indoor Championships over 3000 metres, defending her title from the 2004 IAAF World Indoor Championships.
In the Reebok Boston Indoor meeting of January 2008, Defar ran a time of 9:10.50 in the two-mile (3.2 km) event to establish a new two-mile indoor world best time, breaking the previous indoor best by over twelve seconds.
Defar won her third consecutive World Indoor gold medal in the 3000 m at the 2008 World Indoor Championships in Athletics. At the 2008 African Championships in Athletics, Defar was defeated in the 5000 m by compatriot Meselech Melkamu. At the 2008 Bislett Games, Defar&#x27;s 5000 m world record was broken by Tirunesh Dibaba. She took a 3000/5000 m double at the 2008 World Athletics Final.
Defar began the 2009 athletics season by improving upon her personal bests, setting a new 5000 m world indoor record of 14:24.37 and an indoor world best over two miles (3.2 km) with a 9:06.26 run. She competed in the 10,000 metres event at the British national trials in July, attempting to take a spot on the Ethiopian team at the 2009 World Championships in Athletics. In spite of the wet and windy conditions, she ran a personal best of 29:59.20 minutes – breaking Paula Radcliffe&#x27;s UK all-comers’ record, becoming the fifth woman to run sub-30 minutes, and earning qualification for the Championships in the process.

In Berlin, Meseret was leading the 2009 World Championships in Athletics – Women&#x27;s 10,000 metres until the last 50 metres when her legs appeared to dramatically tie up, handing the gold medal to Kenya&#x27;s Linet Masai and was passed by three other athletes, finishing with a time of 30:52.37. She then ran in the 2009 World Championships in Athletics – Women&#x27;s 5000 metres final and was leading at the top of the home straight, but was passed by two Kenyan with metres to go, Vivian Cheruiyot and Sylvia Kibet. She went on to beat both athletes in the 3000 m at the 2009 IAAF World Athletics Final a month later, setting a world leading time of 8:30.15 in the process.

Rebounding from her bronze medal championship performance, she scored a fourth straight gold medal in the 3000 m at the 2010 IAAF World Indoor Championships. Moving on to the road circuit, she won her third title at the Carlsbad 5000, although her time of 15:04 did not trouble her own course record. At the 2010 African Championships in Athletics, she represented Ethiopia in the 5000 m and won the silver medal behind Vivian Cheruiyot. SHe won the 3000 m gold at the 2010 IAAF Continental Cup a month later. She made her half marathon debut at the Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Philadelphia Half Marathon and succeeded first time, winning in a time of 1:07:44. This mark improved upon Berhane Adere&#x27;s fastest time on American soil for the distance and was the fifth fastest ever debut.

At the beginning of 2011 she made a world record attempt for the indoor 3000 m and came just short with a run of 8:36.91 minutes. She was dominant on the outdoor circuit, taking 5000 m wins at the FBK Games, Bislett Games and Meeting Areva. Her win streak ended at the 2011 World Championships in Athletics, where she first dropped out of the 10,000 m then was beaten by Vivian Cheruiyot and Sylvia Kibet in the 5000 m, ending up with the bronze medal.

At the 2012 IAAF World Indoor Championships she aimed for a fifth straight title and was leading until the last 100 m, at which point she fell behind Hellen Obiri and finished the race as runner-up. A haul of second-place finishes followed in the outdoor season, as she came runner-up to Cheruiyot twice and fellow Ethiopian Tirunesh Dibaba. In spite of this, when it came to the 5000 m final at the 2012 London Olympics she outran both her rivals to claim her second Olympic title over the distance.

She began her indoor track season in 2013 with a 3000 m win in 8:35.28 minutes. Later than month she ran a half marathon best of 67:25 minutes to break the course record at the New Orleans Half Marathon.

She won her second world title in the 5000m 2013 World Championships in Athletics in Moscow in a time of 14:50:19. She won the race by staying close to the front, but without taking the lead before pulling away with 200m left.

<text>Rachid Taha (, , ; 18 September 1958 – 12 September 2018) was an Algerian singer and activist based in France described as &quot;sonically adventurous&quot;. His music was influenced by many different styles including rock, electronic, punk and raï.

==Early life==
Taha was born on 18 September 1958 in Sig, Mascara Province, Algeria, although a second source suggests he was born in the Algerian seacoast city of Oran. This town was the &quot;birthplace of raï&quot; music, and 1958 was a key year in the Algerian struggle for independence against French authority. He began listening to Algerian music in the 1960s, including street-style music called chaabi. Additionally, music from the Maghreb region was part of his upbringing.

He moved with his parents to France when he was ten years old, settling in an immigrant community around the French city of Lyon in 1968. His father was a textile factory worker, with long hours and low pay, such that his life was compared to that of a &quot;modern slave&quot;, according to one account. Aged 17, Taha worked during the day at a central heating plant, described as a &quot;menial job&quot;, and hated this work, but at night worked as a club DJ playing Arabic music, rap, salsa, funk and &quot;anything else that took his fancy.&quot;

In the late 1970s, Taha founded the nightclub called &quot;The Rejects&quot; or, in French, &quot;Les Refoulés&quot;, where he would &quot;spin&quot; mashups of Arabic pop classics over Led Zeppelin, Bo Diddley and Kraftwerk backbeats.

==Career==

===Raï roots===

In the 1980s, Algeria&#x27;s indigenous pop music known as &quot;raï&quot; began to achieve international attention. Originally raï music was based on &quot;city slickers adapting music from the sticks&quot; and was described as ribald, but it became more of a medium for political protest when young people in the 1960s and 1970s used it to &quot;express their anger and desires.&quot; Taha suggested that Algerian musical styles and rock are &quot;closely linked&quot;. Taha was influenced by the Moroccan chaâbi band Nass El Ghiwane which has been described as &quot;Morocco&#x27;s answer to the Beatles or the Stones.&quot;

===Carte de Séjour===
In 1981, while living in Lyon, Taha met Mohammed and Mokhtar Amini and the three of them, along with Djamel Dif and Eric Vaquer, would soon form a band. In 1982, Taha was the lead vocalist for the Arab-language rock group which they named Carte de Sejour, meaning &quot;Green Card&quot; or &quot;Residence Permit&quot; depending on the translation. He sang in both French and Arabic, but usually in Arabic. Taha was inspired by the group &quot;The Clash&quot;:

Taha met members of the group The Clash in Paris:


Taha believed his early recordings helped to inspire The Clash to create the song &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot;. A &quot;New York Times&quot; music reporter wrote of Taha&#x27;s cover version of the Clash&#x27;s hit song probably influenced by his earlier work:

These were difficult years since record stores often refused to stock their records &quot;because they didn&#x27;t want Arabs coming into their shops&quot;. There was little money; the band performed in suburbs of Lyon. Taha took a standard patriotic French song entitled &quot;Sweet France&quot; (in French: &quot;Douce France&quot;) which had originally been recorded by Charles Trenet in the 1940s, kept the lyrics, but sang it with &quot;furious irony&quot; which irritated many French listeners, particularly coming from a &quot;scruffy, bohemian-looking Arabic singer&quot;, to the point where Taha&#x27;s version was banned from French radio. The &quot;acerbic&quot; song created a &quot;splash&quot;, nevertheless, and won Taha some recognition as a serious artist. The group never achieved much commercial success and, as a result, Taha had to work a series of day jobs in a factory, then as a house painter, a dishwasher, and later as an encyclopedia salesman. They recorded their first maxi album &quot;Carte De Séjour&quot; in 1983. In 1984, with the help of British guitarist Steve Hillage, the group achieved a &quot;sharp, driving sound&quot; which played well on the radio, and the LP was entitled &quot;Rhoromanie&quot;. In his songwriting, Taha wrote about living in exile and the cultural strife associated with being an Algerian immigrant in France. In 1986, his &quot;sneering punk-rock cover of &#x27;Douce France&#x27;&quot; was seen as an &quot;unmistakable protest against the nation&#x27;s treatment of its immigrant underclass&quot;, and caused consternation in French political circles. His song &quot;Voilà, Voilà&quot; protested racism. Taha had to cope with anti-Arab sentiment and confusion; for example, &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated in a front-page story that Taha was Egyptian rather than Algerian, but later posted a correction. Later, in 2007, Taha-as-an-immigrant was mentioned in France&#x27;s National Center of the History of Immigration.
When performing live, Taha wore various outfits, including at one point a leather fedora hat, then later a red cowboy hat. The band&#x27;s second and last LP entitled &quot;Ramsa&quot; (Five) was released in 1986. The band dissolved in 1989.

===Solo years===
In 1989, Taha moved to Paris to launch his solo career. At one point he was invited to Los Angeles to record with musician Don Was, who had been a producer associated with the Rolling Stones. Taha mixed a variety of instruments and styles for his sound. With a drum instrument called a doumbek or darbuka, his new group played Arabic-style beats. It appeared at one point that Taha might become an &quot;overnight success&quot;, but after the release of the album &quot;Barbès&quot;, sales were disappointing in the United States, possibly because Americans were not keen on Arabic-sounding music during the time of the first Gulf War.

In 1993, Taha again worked with Hillage who helped produce his second solo album, the self-titled &quot;Rachid Taha&quot; and helped him achieve &quot;the kind of clubland-raï synthesis&quot;. Hillage worked on nine solo Taha albums from 1993 to 2006, helping Taha return to his &quot;north African roots&quot;. In 1995, he released the album entitled &quot;Olé Olé&quot; with Taha looking like an &quot;Aryan androgyne&quot; with dyed blond hair and blue contact lenses, to make a point about anti-Arab bigotry and at the &quot;homophobia of North African culture.&quot; &quot;Valencia&quot; features the singing of Kirsty Hawkshaw. In 1997, his song &quot;Ya Rayah&quot; became a hit. He performed in the Canary Islands.

In 2001, Taha released &quot;Made in Medina&quot;, and a music critic commented that he used a &quot;full and varied instrumental palette&quot; along with &quot;a dizzying vocal facility that transcends whatever style he&#x27;s plugged.&quot; The album was recorded in Paris, New Orleans, and London with input from the American jam band Galactic. Taha saw parallels between African and American music and said &quot;New Orleans is like Algiers ... They were both French colonies at one time, and there&#x27;s even an area there called Algiers,&quot; and he noted that Louisiana Zydeco drum patterns were similar to raï music. &quot;Made in Medina&quot; combined Algerian roots, techno, pop music, and early rock and punk influences with &quot;remarkable consistency&quot; with previous works, according to Hillage. There were elements of political protest in his music leading a BBC critic to describe him as a &quot;shit-disturbing artist who risks challenging his own culture as undemocratic.&quot; A report in &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested that Taha had achieved a cult status in pop music.
Taha&#x27;s breakthrough album as a solo artist was his bestseller &quot;Diwân&quot;, featuring remakes of songs from Algerian and Arab traditions. The album featured traditional instruments like the oud but with a &quot;contemporary veneer of programmed percussion and samples added in.&quot; Taha mixed the oud with strings using a contemporary beat along with guitar work, according to one account. Taha&#x27;s album &quot;Tékitoi&quot;, produced by Steve Hillage and released in 2004, brought acclaim and recognition from other rock musicians. The title track is &quot;street slang&quot; meaning, roughly, &quot;Who the Hell Are You?&quot; (from the French &quot;Tu es qui, toi ?&quot; shortened into &quot;T&#x27;es qui, toi ?&quot;) and the music had &quot;echoes of Joe Strummer&quot;, according to a review in &quot;The Observer&quot;. In 2005 Taha performed with Robert Plant, Patti Smith and Brian Eno. He covered The Clash song &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; which he retitled with the Arabic name of &quot;Rock El Casbah&quot;. This song appeared in the 2007 film about Clash frontman Joe Strummer entitled &quot;The Future Is Unwritten&quot;. The song suggested rock music as &quot;banned but unstoppable&quot;. Taha performed the song along with &quot;The Clash&quot; musician Mick Jones. &quot;The Guardian&quot; selected &quot;Rock El Casbah&quot; as one of the top 50 cover songs.

Taha played in Morocco in 2006. In 2007, Taha performed in Canada and a reporter from the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; described his performance while wearing a &quot;pewter pimp suit&quot; which was &quot;stunning&quot;:

In 2008 he performed with the band Dengue Fever. He was described as a &quot;&quot;wild Algerian punk fan&quot; performing among a lineup which read like a &quot;Who&#x27;s Who of West African music&quot;, and was part of &quot;Africa Express&quot;, a response to the lack of African musicians at Bob Geldof&#x27;s &quot;Live 8&quot; musical extravaganza.

In 2008, Taha was growing increasingly prominent, with greater audiences in places such as Canada, although there were reports that his music had &quot;trouble getting airplay&quot; in France. He performed with Nigerian artists Femi Kuti and Seun Kuti in Lagos at a &quot;Felabration&quot; of the music of their late father Fela Kuti, as well as with Brian Eno in an anti-war concert in London.

In 2009, Taha released &quot;Bonjour&quot; which &quot;The Guardian&quot; music critic Robin Denselow described as &quot;calmed down&quot; under a new producer, Gaëtan Roussel. Denselow wrote: &quot;The result is an unlikely set in which Taha appears to be deliberately courting a new, wider market by playing down that wild rebel image.&quot; Denselow felt the music was more &quot;commercial&quot; and &quot;not his most exciting.&quot; It included a &quot;rousing tribute&quot; on his cover song &quot;Rock El Casbah&quot; to the late Clash guitarist Joe Strummer. In 2010, Taha played in Toronto, Canada to large audiences. Taha performed with Algerian artist Mehdi Haddab who plays the oud. Taha&#x27;s song &quot;Habina&quot; was featured in the 2010 film, &quot;It&#x27;s Kind of a Funny Story&quot;. Guitarist Carlos Santana recorded his song &quot;Migra&quot; which went on to sell over 25 million copies. In recent years, Taha toured nations including the United States and Dubai.

In 2013 Taha released the &quot;Zoom&quot; album, which was produced by guitarist Justin Adams and featured guests Mick Jones and Brian Eno;. Jones toured with Taha as part of the Zoom project. The album included a new recording of &quot;Voilà, Voilà&quot;. Taha also recorded &quot;Now or Never&quot; (words and music by Aaron Schroeder / Wally Gold and previously recorded by Elvis Presley), which features Jeanne Added singing in English.

===Use of Taha&#x27;s songs in movies and computer games===

The song &#x27;&quot;Barra Barra&#x27;&quot; from his album &quot;Made in Medina&quot; was featured in the 2001 film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; as well as in the Games Convention 2008 trailer of the game &quot;Far Cry 2&quot;. It was also featured in the 2007 film &quot;The Hunting Party&quot;.

His song &quot;Garab&quot; from &quot;Made in Medina&quot; was used in the movie &quot;The Truth About Charlie&quot; in 2002, and also in &quot;Blood and Chocolate&quot; in 2007.

His song &quot;Ya Rayah&quot; from his album &quot;Carte Blanche (Rachid Taha album)&quot; was used in the movie &quot;Something New (film)&quot; (2006) 

&quot;Ya Rayah&quot; was also allegedly plagiarized by the composer duo Sanjeev–Darshan for their song &quot;Kali Nagin Ke Jaisi&quot; in the soundtrack of the bollywood film &quot;Mann&quot; (transl. The Psyche). 

===Reviews===
Some critics attribute Taha&#x27;s unique sound to his use of the mandolute, a mixture of the traditional oud with European fretted instruments. One critic described his arrangements as &quot;no less bombastic&quot; since they mixed North African rhythms and &quot;string orchestra flourishes&quot; with &quot;pummeling big-beat techno, distorted electric guitars, snatches of Bo Diddley, Led Zeppelin and other macho sounds.&quot;

* Music critic Philip Brasor in &quot;Japan Times&quot; commented that Taha&#x27;s album &quot;Made in Medina&quot; featured Arabic &quot;chanting&quot; which was meant to evoke &quot;the generalized chaos of society&quot; and which features &quot;heart-stopping break beats, flamenco guitar, African choruses, crunching hard rock and the inevitable sappy love song.&quot;
* Music critic Danny Wiser praised Taha for both his emphasis that he places upon fellow Arabs in North Africa to have pride in both parts of their dual-identity as Arabs as well as Africans, in addition to complimenting him for his infectious personality that shines through on his posthumous album, &quot;Je Suis Africain,&quot; commenting that &quot;one can almost hear his smile beginning to shine through as he plays; simply through the tone of his voice one can detect that he seems to really enjoy performing his music.&quot;
* Music critic Robin Denselow felt Taha&#x27;s &quot;Bonjour&quot; album was calm – &quot;he switches between Arabic and French in this mix of pleasant ballads and novelty pop, with just the occasional reminder of the old passion and anger.&quot; Denselow felt his album &quot;Tékitoi&quot; (2004) was his &quot;most powerful, direct fusion of rock and North African styles to date.&quot; Denselow wrote:

* &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote about Taha&#x27;s song &quot;Ah Mon Amour&quot;:

* BBC News music critic Martin Vennard described Taha&#x27;s music as a &quot;seductive mixture of traditional North African, rock, techno and dance music.&quot;
* Canadian music critic Philly Markowitz named a Taha album one of the best in 2005.
* French music critic Amobe Mevegue described Taha as an &quot;eclectic artist&quot;.

=== Discography and filmography ===
==Personal life and death==
Taha was described as &quot;gregarious&quot; and &quot;quick with a smile.&quot; A person who liked to party throughout the night, he also had a cosmopolitan group of friends. Taha was quoted as saying &quot;I&#x27;ve never wanted to just stay in my own neighborhood, my own community ... It&#x27;s a kind of conformism. You have to be adventurous.&quot;

Taha was not fond of contemporary French cinema and said &quot;I&#x27;d much rather watch some dumb Hollywood movie than another haute bourgeois auteurist piece of crap.&quot; He was a critic of the Bush administration although he made comments favoring a bombing raid on Iran, and said that &quot;Iran shouldn&#x27;t be allowed to have nukes.&quot;

Taha suffered from Chiari malformation diagnosed in 1987. &quot;I&#x27;m tired of people thinking I&#x27;m a drunk on stage. While these are the symptoms of Arnold Chiari disease. I&#x27;m stumbling because I&#x27;m losing my balance. I&#x27;m wavering. It generates a disruption in the body.&quot;&quot;

Taha died from a heart attack in his sleep on 12 September 2018, six days before his 60th birthday. A posthumous album, &quot;Je suis Africain&quot;, previously finished before his death, was released on September 20, 2019.

<text>Miramar (Spanish for &quot;Sea View&quot;) is a neighborhood in the northern part of San Diego, California, United States. It includes residential areas and commercial and light industrial districts.

Most residents live on Marine Corps Air Station Miramar (formerly Naval Air Station Miramar). Miramar was the site of the real TOPGUN flight school made famous by the movie &quot;Top Gun&quot; in 1986. NAS Miramar was realigned by the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) program in 1995 and turned over to the Marine Corps as a fixed wing and helicopter base in 1999. To the north of MCAS Miramar is the suburb of Mira Mesa. The neighborhood is located in City Council District 7.

== History ==
Miramar was originally part of Scripps Ranch, founded by Edward W. Scripps. He named the home he built on the ranch Miramar in the 1890s, after Archduke Maximilian&#x27;s castle Miramare in Trieste, Italy. The name eventually became applied to the surrounding mesa. Loosely translated from Portuguese, Italian or Spanish, it means &quot;a view of the sea&quot;.

Before becoming a military base in 1950, Miramar was a small, isolated community centered on a railroad station. No buildings from the original Miramar survived.

Over time, a Little India commercial community developed on Black Mountain Road.

== Economy ==
The Miramar submarket consists of approximately 14 million square feet of distribution, warehouse, office, and Miramar Road frontage retail related space. Miramar is one of San Diego County&#x27;s most recognized real estate markets due in part to its central location, size, and traditional industrial characteristics. This market historically maintains one of the highest occupancy rates in the county. Recent occupancy rates were approximately 91%.

<text>Nootka Island (; ) is the largest island off the west coast of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada. It is in area. It is separated from Vancouver Island by Nootka Sound and its side-inlets, and is located within Electoral Area A of the Strathcona Regional District.

Europeans named the island after a Nuu-chah-nulth language word meaning &quot;go around, go around&quot;. They likely thought the natives were referring to the island itself. The Spanish and later English applied the word to the island and the sound, thinking they were naming both after the people.

In the 1980s, the First Nations peoples in the region created the collective autonym of &quot;Nuu-chah-nulth&quot;, a term that means &quot;along the outside (of Vancouver Island)&quot;. An older term for this group of peoples was &quot;Aht&quot;, which means &quot;people&quot; in their language and is a component in all the names of their subgroups, and of some locations (e.g. Yuquot, Mowachaht, Kyuquot, Opitsaht etc.).

<text>Tacuarembó ( Guarani: &quot;Takuarembo&quot;, literally: &quot;Bamboo shoot&quot;) is the capital city of the Tacuarembó Department in north-central Uruguay.

==History==
On 24 October 1831, a presidential decree by Fructuoso Rivera ordered the creation of a city in the region. The task was entrusted to the President&#x27;s brother, Colonel Bernabé Rivera.

Colonel Rivera left Montevideo on a three-month journey with a caravan of wagons and families, towards the shore of the Tacuaremboty River, which in the Guaraní language means &quot;river of the reeds&quot;. The area was surveyed and divided into blocks for settlement. On January 21, 1832, Coronel Rivera founded the town under the name &quot;San Fructuoso&quot;, after Saint Fructuosus of Tarragona (whose Saint&#x27;s Day is January 21) and after his (Benjamin&#x27;s) brother.

By 1837, San Fructuoso was a growing town. It had more than 500 residents, a justice of the peace, a military commander, a parish priest, a mayor, and a Public Works Commission. On 16 June 1837, the Tacuarembó Department was created (along with Salto and Paysandú), and San Fructuoso was named the capital.

Over time, the community continued to grow. According to the Act of Ley Nº 2.389, on 17 July 1895 it held the status of &quot;Villa&quot; (town). Its name changed to &quot;Tacuarembó&quot;, and on 24 June 1912, its status was elevated to &quot;Ciudad&quot; (city) by the Act of Ley Nº 4.031.

In popular culture, the city is featured as the setting of the short story &quot;The Shape of the Sword&quot; by Jorge Luis Borges.

==Population==
In 2011, Tacuarembó had a population of 54,755.
Source: &quot;Instituto Nacional de Estadística de Uruguay&quot;
==Geography==
The city is located on Km. 390 of Route 5, south-southwest of Rivera, the capital city of the Rivera Department. Routes 26 and 31 also meet Route 5 within the city limits. The stream Arroyo Tacuarembó Chico, a tributary of Río Tacuarembó, flows through the north part of the city. As of the census of 2011, it is the eighth most populated city of the country.
===Climate===
Tacuarembó has a humid subtropical climate, described by the Köppen climate classification as &quot;Cfa&quot;. Summers are warm to hot and winters are cool, with frequent frosts and fog. The precipitation is evenly distributed throughout the year, with an average of 1,165 mm (45.87 in), and the annual average temperature is 18 °C (64.4 °F).

==Places of worship==
* St. Fructuosus Cathedral (Roman Catholic)
* Holy Cross Parish Church (Roman Catholic)
* St. Joseph Parish Church (Roman Catholic)
* Our Lady of Lourdes Parish Church (Roman Catholic)

==Notable people==
Writers Circe Maia, Mario Benedetti, Tomás de Mattos, and Jorge Majfud are from Tacuarembó, as is José Núñez, 19th century Nicaraguan politician. Some Uruguayans claim that the tango musician Carlos Gardel was born near Tacuarembó, in the village of Valle Edén. Scholarly consensus is that he was born in Toulouse, France, then raised in Buenos Aires, but as an adult he obtained legal papers saying he was born in Tacuarembó, probably to avoid French military authorities. Adrian Luna who plays for Kerala Blasters in the Indian Super League was born here.

<doc id="924276" wikidata="Q1881705" url="?curid=924276" title="Nontuberculous mycobacteria">
<text>Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM), also known as environmental mycobacteria, atypical mycobacteria and mycobacteria other than tuberculosis (MOTT), are mycobacteria which do not cause tuberculosis or leprosy/Hansen&#x27;s disease. NTM can cause pulmonary diseases that resemble tuberculosis. Mycobacteriosis is any of these illnesses, usually meant to exclude tuberculosis. They occur in many animals, including humans, and are commonly found in soil and water.

==Introduction==
Mycobacteria are a family of small, rod-shaped bacilli that can be classified into three main groups for diagnosis and treatment:
* &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; complex, which can cause tuberculosis: &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, &quot;M. bovis&quot;, &quot;M. africanum&quot;, &quot;M. microti&quot; and &quot;M. canettii&quot;
* &quot;M. leprae&quot; and &quot;M. lepromatosis&quot;, which cause Hansen&#x27;s disease, also called leprosy
* Nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) are all the other mycobacteria that can cause pulmonary disease resembling tuberculosis, lymphadenitis, skin disease, or disseminated disease. Although over 150 different species of NTM have been described, pulmonary infections are most commonly due to &quot;Mycobacterium avium&quot; complex (MAC), &quot;Mycobacterium kansasii&quot;, and &quot;Mycobacterium abscessus&quot; (see image).

==Taxonomy==
In 1959, botanist Ernest Runyon put these human disease-associated bacteria into four groups (Runyon classification):

*Photochromogens develop pigments in or after being exposed to light. Examples include &quot;M. kansasii&quot;, &quot;M. simiae&quot;, and &quot;M. marinum&quot;.
*Scotochromogens become pigmented in darkness. Examples include &quot;M. scrofulaceum&quot; and &quot;M. szulgai&quot;.
*Nonchromogens include a group of prevalent opportunistic pathogens called &quot;M. avium&quot; complex (MAC). Other examples are &quot;M. ulcerans&quot;, &quot;M. xenopi&quot;, &quot;M. malmoense&quot;, &quot;M. terrae&quot;, &quot;M. haemophilum&quot;, and &quot;M. genavense&quot;.
*Rapid growers include four well-recognized, pathogenic, rapidly growing, nonchromogenic species: &quot;M. chelonae&quot;, &quot;M. abscessus&quot;, &quot;M. fortuitum&quot;, and &quot;M. peregrinum&quot;. Other examples cause disease rarely, such as &quot;M. smegmatis&quot; and &quot;M. flavescens&quot;.

The number of identified and cataloged NTM species has been increasing rapidly, from about 50 in 1997 to over 125 by January 2007. The surge is mainly due to improved isolation and identification techniques.

Even with these new techniques, though, the Runyon classification is sometimes used to organize the mycobacteria into categories.

==Epidemiology==
NTM are widely distributed in the environment, particularly in wet soil, marshland, streams, rivers, and estuaries. Different species of NTM prefer different types of environments. Human disease is believed to be acquired from environmental exposures. Unlike tuberculosis and leprosy, animal-to-human or human-to-human transmission of NTM rarely occurs.

NTM diseases have been seen in most industrialized countries, where incidence rates vary from 1.0 to 1.8 cases per 100,000 persons. Recent studies, including one done in Ontario, Canada, suggest that incidence is much higher. Pulmonary NTM is estimated by some experts in the field to be at least ten times more common than TB in the U.S., with at least 150,000 cases per year.

Most NTM disease cases involve the species known as &quot;Mycobacterium avium complex&quot; or MAC for short, &quot;M. abscessus&quot;, &quot;M. fortuitum&quot; and &quot;M. kansasii&quot;. &quot;M. abscessus&quot; is being seen with increasing frequency and is particularly difficult to treat.

Mayo Clinic researchers found a three-fold increased incidence of cutaneous NTM infection between 1980 and 2009 in a population-based study of residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota. The most common species were &quot;M. marinum&quot;, accounting for 45% of cases and &quot;M. chelonae&quot; and &quot;M. abscessus&quot;, together accounting for 32% of patients. &quot;M. chelonae&quot; infection outbreaks, as a consequence of tattooing with infected ink, have been reported in the United Kingdom and the United States.

Rapidly growing NTMs are implicated in catheter infections, post-LASIK, skin and soft tissue (especially post-cosmetic surgery), and pulmonary infections.

==Pathogenesis==
The most common clinical manifestation of NTM disease is lung disease, but lymphatic, skin/soft tissue, and disseminated diseases are also important.

Pulmonary disease caused by NTM is most often seen in postmenopausal women and patients with underlying lung diseases such as cystic fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and prior tuberculosis. It is not uncommon for alpha 1-antitrypsin deficiency, Marfan syndrome, and primary ciliary dyskinesia patients to have pulmonary NTM colonization and/or infection. Pulmonary NTM can also be found in individuals with AIDS and malignant disease. It can be caused by many NTM species, which depends on region, but most frequently MAC and &quot;M. kansasii&quot;.

Clinical symptoms vary in scope and intensity but commonly include chronic cough, often with purulent sputum. Hemoptysis may also be present. Systemic symptoms include malaise, fatigue, and weight loss in advanced disease. The diagnosis of &quot;M. abscessus&quot; pulmonary infection requires the presence of symptoms, radiologic abnormalities, and microbiologic cultures.

Lymphadenitis can be caused by various species that differ from one place to another, but again, MAC is the main cause worldwide. Most patients are aged less than 5 years, but the incidence is rare for children having BCG vaccine. The disease has a high curability.

Soft-tissue disease due to NTM infection include post-traumatic abscesses (caused by rapid growers), swimming pool granuloma (caused by &quot;M. marinum&quot;) and Buruli ulcer (caused by &quot;M. ulcerans&quot; or &quot;M. shinshuense&quot;). Post-traumatic abscesses most commonly occur after injection.

Disseminated mycobacterial disease was common in US and European AIDS patients in the 1980s and early 1990s, though the incidence has declined in developed nations since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy. It can also occur in individuals after having renal transplantation.

==Diagnosis==

Diagnosis of opportunistic mycobacteria is made by repeated isolation and identification of the pathogen with compatible clinical and radiological features. Similar to &quot;M. tuberculosis&quot;, most nontuberculous mycobacteria can be detected microscopically and grow on Löwenstein-Jensen medium. Many reference centres now use a nucleic acid-based method such as sequence differences detection in the gene coding for 16S ribosomal RNA to identify the species.

Pulmonary NTM disease diagnosis requires both identification of the mycobacterium in the patient&#x27;s lung(s), as well as a high-resolution CT scan of the lungs.

==Research==
French researchers finalized the genome sequence of &quot;M. abscessus&quot; in March 2008. The genome is available at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=genome&amp;cmd=search&amp;term=abscessus.

<text>Thomsonfly was a British charter and scheduled airline. Thomsonfly was the first stage of TUI AG&#x27;s plans to expand its business within TUI UK prior to September 2007. After TUI UK merged with First Choice Holidays in September 2007, it became part of TUI Travel PLC. The new holiday company continued with both in-house airlines (Thomsonfly and First Choice Airways) through winter 2007 and summer 2008 until the two were merged on 1 November 2008 as Thomson Airways.

Thomsonfly Limited held a Civil Aviation Authority Type A Operating Licence permitting it to carry passengers, cargo and mail on aircraft with 20 or more seats.

== History ==
As part of a wider reorganisation of TUI&#x27;s UK operations in September 2004, it was announced that Britannia would be rebranded as Thomsonfly. Thomsonfly Limited changed its name to Thomson Airways in October 2008.

== Fleet ==

In October 2008, Thomsonfly operated an all-Boeing fleet composed of the following aircraft:

<text>, known outside of Japan as the first season of The Mysterious Cities of Gold (French: &quot;Les Mystérieuses Cités d&#x27;Or&quot;), is a French-Japanese animated series which was produced by MK, NHK, DiC Audiovisuel, CLT and animated by Studio Pierrot.

The series was originally broadcast in Japan and the French version, edited with different characterization and music, was subsequently redubbed and distributed in many countries. It is currently licensed for English-language home video release in the United Kingdom, Australia, and North America by Fabulous Films.

When it was rebroadcast in Japan on NHK BS2 from 1998 to 1999, the animation was imported back from France and the audio was redubbed. NHK had erased the original VTR when their contract expired, and the rights holder had lost the master copy. The voice actress for the main character, Esteban, was the only one to reprise her role. 

A sequel, serving as a continuation of the original, premiered in 2012.

It is the 16th century. From all over Europe, great ships sail west to conquer the New World, the Americas. The men, eager to seek their fortune, to find new adventures in new lands. They long to cross uncharted seas and discover unknown countries, to find secret gold on a mountain trail high in the Andes. They dream of following the path of the setting sun that leads to El Dorado and the Mysterious Cities of Gold.

==Plot==
In 1532, a Spanish orphan named Esteban joins Mendoza, a navigator, and his associates Sancho and Pedro, in their search for one of the Seven Cities of Gold in the New World, hoping to find his father. They are joined on their quest by Zia, an Incan girl (who was kidnapped by Gomez, Gaspard, Perez and Mendoza), and Tao, the last descendant of the sunken empire of Mu (Hiva in the English version).

The series is a mix of ancient South American history, archaeology, and science fiction. During their journey, the travelers encounter the Mayas, Incas, and Olmecs. They discover many lost technological wonders of the Mu Empire, including the &quot;Solaris&quot;, a huge solar-powered &quot;flying ship&quot; and &quot;The Golden Condor&quot;, another flying vessel in the shape of a giant bird, capable of travelling considerable distances under the sun&#x27;s power alone. They are constantly pursued by antagonists Gomez and Gaspard, who are also in search of the Cities of Gold.

The Seven Cities of Gold were built by the Emperor of Hiva out of fear that a global war would destroy all civilizations. Such a war actually broke out, destroying the Empires of Mu and Atlantis when they used the &quot;Weapons of the Sun&quot;. The Seven Cities of Gold hold copies of books in their &quot;Universal Libraries&quot; as well as powerful artefacts, including the &quot;Great Legacy&quot;, a portable fusion reactor. Other elements of this technology turn up in unexpected places, like the &quot;Solaris&quot; on Tao&#x27;s home island, Esteban&#x27;s and Zia&#x27;s medallions as keys to the Cities, and Tao&#x27;s jar as an important piece of the Great Legacy.

Reminiscences of this ancient story are present in Inca legends written on golden quipu, which only Zia can read. This triggers an obsessive quest for the Cities of Gold on the part of the Spaniards Mendoza, Gomez, Gaspard and Francisco Pizarro.

Esteban seeks his long-lost father and he is also tied to Mendoza, who rescued him from a sinking ship when he was a baby. Esteban seems to have a magical ability to make the sun appear, which proves to be an invaluable asset throughout the series. Zia also seeks her father, from whom she was taken and was brought to Spain as a gift for the princess Margarita when she was seven years old. She has a medallion just like the one which Esteban carries.

Tao seeks signs of his ancestors. He possesses an encyclopedia which contains information about their lost technology as well as a mysterious jar which according to the legend, only the High Priest of the City of Gold can open, and it proves to be the Great Legacy&#x27;s cooling or control rod system. Mendoza, Sancho and Pedro are motivated by their search for gold, but Mendoza genuinely appears to be fond of the three children.

The Olmecs are the descendants of survivors of the global war who hid under their mountain. Only their elite were able to survive, suspended in cryogenic hibernation. The Olmecs have evolved from centuries living an underground existence; they are short and thin, with pointed ears and enlarged frontal bones. They are highly intelligent but insular and distrustful of all others.

Led by their king, Menator, the Olmecs seek an artefact called the &quot;Great Legacy&quot; in order to power their cryogenic systems, as well as samples of healthy cells from the children in order to combat their mutations and their sterility. The Olmecs make use of contemporary devices such as spears and swords alongside elements of their advanced technological heritage; such as stasis and medical technology which allows the elite of the Olmecs to remain in suspended animation, awaiting an opportunity to revive them. 

This power system maintaining the Olmecs cryogenic systems is destroyed during an escape by the children and Mendoza, causing the Olmecs to conduct a frantic search for the fusion reactor core (the Great Treasure) which is hidden inside the City of Gold. They also possess a flying machine which appears to have been constructed with the same type of advanced technology which the Golden Condor was constructed with. It is armed with a particle beam or a focused heat weapon which is very powerful.

Eventually, the Olmecs succeed, at great cost, in taking control of the Great Legacy. It begins to melt down without the moderation which is supposed to be provided by Tao&#x27;s jar. The resulting earthquakes and volcanism destroy the City of Gold. A world-threatening meltdown is avoided by the personal sacrifice of Esteban&#x27;s father who, acting as the High Priest of the Cities, is presumed to be dead after he replaces the jar. At the end of the series, Mendoza, Sancho and Pedro, who have salvaged some gold before the city&#x27;s destruction, return to Spain, while Esteban and his friends set out across the Pacific Ocean on the golden condor in search of the remaining Cities of Gold.

==Characters==
The main cast of the series dubbed into American English, includes:
* () – An orphan who was rescued at sea as a baby ten years ago by the Spanish navigator Mendoza. He wears one of the two sun medallions. He dreams of adventure and is extremely impulsive. Esteban has a fear of heights which is exacerbated by the people of Barcelona who believe that he is the &quot;Child of the Sun&quot; and hoist him up high at the port to call out the sun to aid the departing ships. He joins the Spaniards on their search for one of The Seven Cities of Gold in the New World, hoping to find his father.
* () – The daughter of an Inca high priest. She was kidnapped from Peru five years ago, when she was seven, by the Spanish invaders and given as a present to the Queen of Spain for her daughter, Princess Margarita. She met Esteban when she was kidnapped by Mendoza for Governor Pizarro who wanted her to read the golden quipu. Zia wears a sun medallion like Esteban&#x27;s, with an interlocking sun and moon disc.
* () – The last living descendant of the sunken empire of Mu (Hiva in the English version). He lived alone on the Galápagos Islands following the death of his father. Initially he is evasive of the others&#x27; company when they wash up on his island, but when the ship &quot;Solaris&quot; was revealed he joined them on their journey. He carries with him an encyclopedia handed down to him by his Hiva ancestors. Being the most intelligent of the children, he often takes a more studious approach to problem solving with Esteban sometimes becoming irritated due to his own impulsive nature.
* () – A Spaniard and navigator for the Spanish fleet. He rescued a young Esteban from a shipwreck during one of his voyages. An experienced sailor, proficient navigator and master swordsman, Mendoza places himself in the role of a leader. It is not always clear, however, where his loyalties lie and he is often at odds with the other characters. He is accompanied by fellow sailors Sancho and Pedro. Mendoza has spent many years searching for information about the cities of gold, following his theft of a piece of Esteban&#x27;s medallion when he rescued the latter as an infant. His full name is revealed to be Juan Carlos Mendoza in season three.
* () and () are comical, bumbling sailors who, motivated by their greed for gold, join Mendoza and the children on their search for the Mysterious Cities of Gold. They get into a lot of scrapes, and make several attempts to escape from Mendoza&#x27;s watchful eye, once they realize how tiring the quest is.

==Production==
The story was written by Jean Chalopin and Bernard Deyriès, and is very loosely based on the novel &quot;The King&#x27;s Fifth&quot; by Scott O&#x27;Dell. The series&#x27; chief director was Hisayuki Toriumi. The producers were Max Saldinger and Atsumi Yajima (NHK). The musical score was composed by Haim Saban and Shuki Levy in the Western version (Nobuyoshi Koshibe in the Japanese version). Shingo Araki was involved with the series as an animator and some episodes were directed by Toyoo Ashida and Mizuho Nishikubo.

Originally Koshibe&#x27;s score was to be used for the Western version as well. In contrast, Bernard Deyriès recalled his reaction to the proposed music he heard from &quot;Ulysses 31&quot; in that he felt that the score was rather understated as he was expecting a more adventurous feel, something akin to films like &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;. At that point Haim Saban and Shuki Levy had met Deyriès, and became involved with the soundtracks of &quot;Ulysses 31&quot; and &quot;The Mysterious Cities of Gold&quot;.

The theme song to the Western version was performed by Noam Kaniel, an associate of Levy&#x27;s.

<doc id="924295" wikidata="Q459810" url="?curid=924295" title="Nootka Sound">
<text>Nootka Sound () is a sound of the Pacific Ocean on the rugged west coast of Vancouver Island, in the Pacific Northwest, historically known as King George&#x27;s Sound. It separates Vancouver Island and Nootka Island, part of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It played a historically important role in the maritime fur trade.

==History==


The inlet is part of the traditional territory of the indigenous Nuu-chah-nulth people. They call it &quot;Mowichat&quot;. John R. Jewitt is an Englishman who describes the area in some detail in a memoir about his years as a captive of chief Maquinna from 1802 to 1805.

===European exploration and trade===
On August 8, 1774, the Spanish Navy ship &quot;Santiago&quot;, under Juan Pérez, entered and anchored in the inlet. Although the Spanish did not land, natives paddled to the ship to trade furs for abalone shells from California. Pérez named the entrance to Nootka Sound &quot;Surgidero de San Lorenzo&quot;. The word &quot;surgidero&quot; means &quot;source&quot;. When Esteban José Martinez arrived in 1789 he gave Nootka Sound the name &quot;Puerto de San Lorenzo de Nuca&quot;. To the Spanish establishment at Friendly Cove he gave the name &quot;Santa Cruz de Nuca&quot;.

In March 1778, Captain James Cook of the Royal Navy landed on Bligh Island and named the inlet &quot;King George&#x27;s Sound&quot;. He recorded that the native name was &quot;Nutka&quot; or Nootka, apparently misunderstanding his conversations at &quot;Friendly Cove/Yuquot&quot;; his informant may have been explaining that he was on an island (&quot;itchme nutka&quot;, a place you can &quot;go around&quot;). There may also have been confusion with &quot;Nuu-chah-nulth&quot;, the natives&#x27; autonym (name for themselves). It may also have simply been based on Cook’s mis-pronunciation of Yuquot, the native name of the place. The earlier Spanish and British names for the Sound swiftly went out of use.

At the time, the Spanish monopolized the trade between Asia and North America, and had granted limited licenses to the Portuguese. The Russians had established a growing fur trading system in Alaska. The Spanish began to challenge the Russians, with Pérez&#x27;s voyage being the first of many to the Pacific Northwest. The British also became increasingly active in the region.

The next European to visit Nootka Sound after James Cook was the British trader James Hanna in August 1785. Hanna traded iron bars for furs. He sold the furs in China for a handsome profit, beginning an era of the Maritime Fur Trade.

In 1786 another maritime fur trader, James Strange, visited Nootka Sound. One of his crew, John Mackay, volunteered to remain at Nootka and work to establish relationships until Strange returned the next year. But Strange never returned. When the trader Charles Barkley arrived at Nootka in the summer of 1787, he was surprised to find John Mackay who, over the year, had learned the Nuu-chah-nulth&#x27;s language and customs, adapted himself to their ways, and married a young native girl. At first Mackay was welcomed and befriended by Maquinna, but after unknowingly breaking a taboo he was exiled from Maquinna&#x27;s house and forced to survive on his own. Barkley took Mackay on board his ship, &quot;Imperial Eagle&quot;.

===Nootka Crisis===
Starting in 1774 Spain sent several expeditions to Alaska to assert its long-held claim over the Pacific Northwest which dated back to the 16th century. During the decade 1785–1795 British merchants, encouraged by Sir Joseph Banks and supported by their government, made a sustained attempt to develop British fur trade in the area, despite Spain&#x27;s claims and navigation rights. The endeavours of these merchants did not last long in the face of Spain&#x27;s opposition. The challenge was also opposed by Japan holding obdurately to national seclusion. In 1789 Spain sent Sub-Lieutenant Esteban José Martinez, commanding &quot;Princesa&quot; and &quot;San Carlos&quot;, to enforce Spanish sovereignty and defend its claims. He arrived in February 1789 and established a settlement and built Fort San Miguel. The ship , under Captain William Douglas and owned by John Meares, was impounded and the Spanish navy seized two other British ships, including . Two American ships in the area were allowed to sail as the United States was Spain&#x27;s ally (Spain had helped the US in its War of Independence). However, the American ship , under Thomas Humphrey Metcalfe, was seized and taken to San Blas, before being released. The capture of the British ships led to the Nootka Crisis and near war between Britain and Spain. The British challenged Spanish claims to allegedly &quot;un-colonized&quot; land on the Pacific coasts of North and South America. The first Nootka Convention (1790) gave both countries the right to settle along the Pacific coasts, interrupting the Spanish monopoly for the first time in over two centuries. The British quickly sponsored the Vancouver Expedition of exploration. Difficulties in implementing the terms led to a second, and then a third Nootka Convention (1794).

The Nootka Sound controversy also played a part in the French Revolution. The Spanish Bourbon monarchy asked for French support in the dispute in the event that it led to war between Spain and Great Britain. The French Bourbon king Louis XVI wanted to back Spain against Great Britain, but his right to enter France into an alliance on his own prerogative was disputed by the National Assembly. The Assembly maintained that the King&#x27;s right to determine foreign policy and declare war was subject to the sovereignty of the people. Eventually the Assembly ruled that a proposal for a declaration of war could be initiated by the king, but had to be ratified by the Assembly; this was a major blow to the monarchy.

===Thomas Muir===
The Scottish political reformer Thomas Muir had been banished to Port Jackson in Botany Bay in Australia for 14 years for the crime of sedition in 1793. He managed to escape having only spent 13 months there, on board the American merchant ship . After a highly adventurous voyage across the as yet largely uncharted Pacific Ocean to Vancouver Island, &quot;Otter&quot; finally dropped anchor in Nootka Sound on 22 June 1796.

In conversation with José Tovar, the &quot;piloto&quot; (master) of , a Spanish vessel at anchor in the Nootka Sound, Muir learned to his dismay of the presence in neighbouring waters of , the British sloop-of-war under William Robert Broughton. This vessel had visited Port Jackson in Australia shortly before Muir’s escape and, since Broughton had almost certainly become acquainted with the captain or members of the crew, his life was now in real danger.

To be captured while under sentence of transportation meant immediate execution. Once again Muir’s extraordinary luck held out. While a student at Glasgow, he had acquired a fluent command of Spanish and he was now able to persuade Tovar to break his regulations regarding the admission of foreigners into Spanish territory. Changing vessels he sailed with Tovar down the Pacific West Coast to the port of Monterey in Spanish Las Californias.

The chronicles of Pierre François Péron describe Muir&#x27;s escape from Australia and the voyage across the Pacific to Nootka Sound, and then as far as Monterey, California.

Nootka Sound has not been the scene of any major international disagreements in modern history.

==Climate==
The climate of the land around the bay is oceanic (&quot;Cfb&quot;), but with a wet fall, winter, and spring season and a strong dry-summer trend. Winters are chilly and summers are short and mild.

==Luna the orca==
In 2001, a two-year-old male orca, later named Luna, was seen alone in Nootka Sound as far inland as the marina at Gold River, British Columbia. Presumed to be an orphan separated from his pod, Luna became a local and international celebrity as a result of his playful and curious behaviour towards tug boats and recreational watercraft on Nootka Sound, and with people, including young children, on the Gold River dock. The popularity of Luna made Nootka Sound and Gold River an international attraction from early 2002 through March 2006 when Luna was killed in an accidental collision with the propeller of the Vancouver-based tugboat, &quot;General Jackson&quot;, on Mooyah Bay in Nootka Sound.

==In popular culture==
It is mentioned in the former unofficial national anthem of English-speaking Canada, &quot;The Maple Leaf Forever&quot;, to represent the western extent of Canada&#x27;s &quot;fair dominion&quot;.

Nootka Sound is referred to in the 2017 FX/BBC One drama &quot;Taboo&quot; and is a central part of the storyline. The Nootka trading post becomes an issue of contention between the United States, the British Crown, the East India Company and the protagonist James Keziah Delaney, who has inherited the trading post from his father.

<doc id="924298" wikidata="Q612349" url="?curid=924298" title="Measuring network throughput">
<text>Throughput of a network can be measured using various tools available on different platforms. This page explains the theory behind what these tools set out to measure and the issues regarding these measurements.

Reasons for measuring throughput in networks. 
People are often concerned about measuring the maximum data throughput in bits per second of a communications link or network access. A typical method of performing a measurement is to transfer a &#x27;large&#x27; file from one system to another system and measure the time required to complete the transfer or copy of the file. The throughput is then calculated by dividing the file size by the time to get the throughput in megabits, kilobits, or bits per second.

Unfortunately, the results of such an exercise will often result in the goodput which is less than the maximum theoretical data throughput, leading to people believing that their communications link is not operating correctly. 
In fact, there are many overheads accounted for in throughput in addition to transmission overheads, including latency, TCP Receive Window size and system limitations, which means the calculated goodput does not reflect the maximum achievable throughput.

==Theory: Short Summary==
The Maximum bandwidth can be calculated as follows:

formula_1 

where RWIN is the TCP Receive Window and RTT is the round-trip time for the path.
The Max TCP Window size in the absence of TCP window scale option is 65,535 bytes. Example: Max Bandwidth = 65,535 bytes / 0.220 s = 297886.36 B/s * 8 = 2.383 Mbit/s. Over a single TCP connection between those endpoints, the tested bandwidth will be restricted to 2.376 Mbit/s even if the contracted bandwidth is greater.

==Bandwidth test software==
Bandwidth test software is used to determine the maximum bandwidth of a network or internet connection. It is typically undertaken by attempting to download or upload the maximum amount of data in a certain period of time, or a certain amount of data in the minimum amount of time. For this reason, Bandwidth tests can delay internet transmissions through the internet connection as they are undertaken, and can cause inflated data charges.

==Nomenclature==
The throughput of communications links is measured in bits per second (bit/s), kilobits per second (kbit/s), megabits per second (Mbit/s) and gigabits per second (Gbit/s). In this application, kilo, mega and giga are the standard S.I. prefixes indicating multiplication by 1,000 (kilo), 1,000,000 (mega), and 1,000,000,000 (giga).

File sizes are typically measured in bytes — kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes being usual, where a byte is eight bits. In modern textbooks one kilobyte is defined as 1,000 byte, one megabyte as 1,000,000 byte, etc., in accordance with the 1998 International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) standard. However, the convention adopted by Windows systems is to define 1 kilobyte is as 1,024 (or 210) bytes, which is equal to 1 kibibyte. Similarly, a file size of &quot;1 megabyte&quot; is 1,024 × 1,024 byte, equal to 1 mebibyte), and &quot;1 gigabyte&quot; 1,024 × 1,024 × 1,024 byte = 1 gibibyte).

===Confusing and inconsistent use of Suffixes===

It is usual for people to abbreviate commonly used expressions. For file sizes, it is usual for someone to say that they have a &#x27;64 k&#x27; file (meaning 64 kilobytes), or a &#x27;100 meg&#x27; file (meaning 100 megabytes). When talking about circuit bit rates, people will interchangeably use the terms throughput, bandwidth and speed, and refer to a circuit as being a &#x27;64 k&#x27; circuit, or a &#x27;2 meg&#x27; circuit — meaning 64 kbit/s or 2 Mbit/s (see also the List of connection bandwidths). However, a &#x27;64 k&#x27; circuit will not transmit a &#x27;64 k&#x27; file in one second. This may not be obvious to those unfamiliar with telecommunications and computing, so misunderstandings sometimes arise. In actuality, a 64 kilobyte file is 64 × 1,024 × 8 bits in size and the 64 k circuit will transmit bits at a rate of 64 × 1,000 bit/s, so the amount of time taken to transmit a 64 kilobyte file over the 64 k circuit will be at least (64 × 1,024 × 8)/(64 × 1,000) seconds, which works out to be 8.192 seconds.

==Compression==

Some equipment can improve matters by compressing the data as it is sent. This is a feature of most analog modems and of several popular operating systems. If the 64 k file can be shrunk by compression, the time taken to transmit can be reduced. This can be done invisibly to the user, so a highly compressible file may be transmitted considerably faster than expected. As this &#x27;invisible&#x27; compression cannot easily be disabled, it therefore follows that when measuring throughput by using files and timing the time to transmit, one should use files that cannot be compressed. Typically, this is done using a file of random data, which becomes harder to compress the closer to truly random it is.

Assuming your data cannot be compressed, the 8.192 seconds to transmit a 64 kilobyte file over a 64 kilobit/s communications link is a theoretical minimum time which will not be achieved in practice. This is due to the effect of overheads which are used to format the data in an agreed manner so that both ends of a connection have a consistent view of the data.

There are at least two issues that aren&#x27;t immediately obvious for transmitting compressed files:

# The throughput of the network itself isn&#x27;t improved by compression. From the end-to-end (server to client) perspective compression does improve throughput. That&#x27;s because information content for the same amount of transmission is increased through compression of files.
# Compressing files at the server and client takes more processor resources at both the ends. The server has to use its processor to compress the files, if they aren&#x27;t already done. The client has to decompress the files upon receipt. This can be considered an expense (for the server and client) for the benefit of increased end to end throughput(although the throughput hasn&#x27;t changed for the network itself.)

==Overheads and data formats==
A common communications link used by many people is the asynchronous start-stop, or just &quot;asynchronous&quot;, serial link. If you have an external modem attached to your home or office computer, the chances are that the connection is over an asynchronous serial connection. Its advantage is that it is simple — it can be implemented using only three wires: Send, Receive and Signal Ground (or Signal Common). In an RS-232 interface, an idle connection has a continuous negative voltage applied. A &#x27;zero&#x27; bit is represented as a positive voltage difference with respect to the Signal Ground and a &#x27;one&#x27; bit is a negative voltage with respect to signal ground, thus indistinguishable from the idle state. This means you need to know when a &#x27;one&#x27; bit starts to distinguish it from idle. This is done by agreeing in advance how fast data will be transmitted over a link, then using a start bit to signal the start of a byte — this start bit will be a &#x27;zero&#x27; bit. Stop bits are &#x27;one&#x27; bits i.e. negative voltage.

Actually, more things will have been agreed in advance — the speed of bit transmission, the number of bits per character, the parity and the number of stop bits (signifying the end of a character). So a designation of 9600-8-E-2 would be 9,600 bits per second, with eight bits per character, even parity and two stop bits.

A common set-up of an asynchronous serial connection would be 9600-8-N-1 (9,600 bit/s, 8 bits per character, no parity and 1 stop bit) - a total of 10 bits transmitted to send one 8 bit character (one start bit, the 8 bits making up the byte transmitted and one stop bit). This is an overhead of 20%, so a 9,600 bit/s asynchronous serial link will not transmit data at 9600/8 bytes per second (1200 byte/s) but actually, in this case 9600/10 bytes per second (960 byte/s), which is considerably slower than expected.

It can get worse. If parity is specified and we use 2 stop bits, the overhead for carrying one 8 bit character is 4 bits (one start bit, one parity bit and two stop bits) - or 50%! In this case a 9600 bit/s connection will carry 9600/12 byte/s (800 byte/s). Asynchronous serial interfaces commonly will support bit transmission speeds of up to 230.4 kbit/s. If it is set up to have no parity and one stop bit, this means the byte transmission rate is 23.04 kbyte/s.

The advantage of the asynchronous serial connection is its simplicity. One disadvantage is its low efficiency in carrying data. This can be overcome by using a synchronous interface. In this type of interface, a clock signal is added on a separate wire, and the bits are transmitted in synchrony with the clock — the interface no longer has to look for the start and stop bits of each individual character — however, it is necessary to have a mechanism to ensure the sending and receiving clocks are kept in synchrony, so data is divided up into frames of multiple characters separated by known delimiters. There are three common coding schemes for framed communications — HDLC, PPP, and Ethernet

===HDLC===

When using HDLC, rather than each byte having a start, optional parity, and one or two stop bits, the bytes are gathered together into a frame. The start and end of the frame are signalled by the &#x27;flag&#x27;, and error detection is carried out by the frame check sequence. If the frame has a maximum sized address of 32 bits, a maximum sized control part of 16 bits and a maximum sized frame check sequence of 16 bits, the overhead per frame could be as high as 64 bits. If each frame carried but a single byte, the data throughput efficiency would be extremely low. However, the bytes are normally gathered together, so that even with a maximal overhead of 64 bits, frames carrying more than 24 bytes are more efficient than asynchronous serial connections. As frames can vary in size because they can have different numbers of bytes being carried as data, this means the overhead of an HDLC connection is not fixed.

===PPP===

The &quot;point-to-point protocol&quot; (PPP) is defined by the Internet Request For Comment documents RFC 1570, RFC 1661 and RFC 1662. With respect to the framing of packets, PPP is quite similar to HDLC, but supports both bit-oriented as well as byte-oriented (&quot;octet-stuffed&quot;) methods of delimiting frames while maintaining data transparency.

===Ethernet===

Ethernet is a &quot;local area network&quot; (LAN) technology, which is also framed. The way the frame is electrically defined on a connection between two systems is different from the typically wide-area networking technology that uses HDLC or PPP implemented, but these details are not important for throughput calculations. Ethernet is a shared medium, so that it is not guaranteed that only the two systems that are transferring a file between themselves will have exclusive access to the connection. If several systems are attempting to communicate simultaneously, the throughput between any pair can be substantially lower than the nominal bandwidth available.

===Other low-level protocols===

Dedicated point-to-point links are not the only option for many connections between systems. Frame Relay, ATM, and MPLS based services can also be used. When calculating or estimating data throughputs, the details of the frame/cell/packet format and the technology&#x27;s detailed implementation need to be understood.

====Frame Relay====

Frame Relay uses a modified HDLC format to define the frame format that carries data.
====ATM====

Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) uses a radically different method of carrying data. Rather than using variable length frames or packets, data is carried in fixed size cells. Each cell is 53 bytes long, with the first 5 bytes defined as the header, and the following 48 bytes as payload. Data networking commonly requires packets of data that are larger than 48 bytes, so there is a defined adaptation process that specifies how larger packets of data should be divided up in a standard manner to be carried by the smaller cells. This process varies according to the data carried, so in ATM nomenclature, there are different ATM Adaptation Layers. The process defined for most data is named ATM Adaptation Layer No. 5 or AAL5.

Understanding throughput on ATM links requires a knowledge of which ATM adaptation layer has been used for the data being carried.

====MPLS====

Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) adds a standard tag or header known as a &#x27;label&#x27; to existing packets of data. In certain situations it is possible to use MPLS in a &#x27;stacked&#x27; manner, so that labels are added to packets that have already been labelled. Connections between MPLS systems can also be &#x27;native&#x27;, with no underlying transport protocol, or MPLS labelled packets can be carried inside frame relay or HDLC packets as payloads. Correct throughput calculations need to take such configurations into account. For example, a data packet could have two MPLS labels attached via &#x27;label-stacking&#x27;, then be placed as payload inside an HDLC frame. This generates more overhead that has to be taken into account that a single MPLS label attached to a packet which is then sent &#x27;natively&#x27;, with no underlying protocol to a receiving system.

==Higher-level protocols==

Few systems transfer files and data by simply copying the contents of the file into the &#x27;Data&#x27; field of HDLC or PPP frames — another protocol layer is used to format the data inside the &#x27;Data&#x27; field of the HDLC or PPP frame. The most commonly used such protocol is Internet Protocol (IP), defined by RFC 791. This imposes its own overheads.

Again, few systems simply copy the contents of files into IP packets, but use yet another protocol that manages the connection between two systems — TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), defined by RFC 1812. This adds its own overhead.

Finally, a final protocol layer manages the actual data transfer process. A commonly used protocol for this is the &quot;file transfer protocol

<text>The Piper M-Class (PA-46; formerly called the Malibu, Malibu Mirage, Malibu Meridian, and Matrix) is a family of American light aircraft manufactured by Piper Aircraft of Vero Beach, Florida. The aircraft are powered by single engines and have six seats. Twentieth century production of the class was all piston engined (now M350; formerly Malibu, Malibu Mirage), but turboprop versions called the M500 (formerly Malibu Meridian), M600 and M700 (Fury) are now also available. 

The M350 is the only pressurized piston engined airplane in current production, as of 2025, allowing it an extended range (1,343 nmi) versus the majority of its certified light aircraft peers in addition to a more comfortable cabin experience. It is recognized as one of the safest single-engines to fly by the airplane insurance industry.

FAA certification of the PA-46 Malibu came in 1983, and the aircraft family has seen continuous production for more than four decades since. An updated version of the Malibu called the Malibu Mirage (now M350) replaced its Continental engine with a more reliable (and powerful) Lycoming in 1988. Certification of a turboprop version called the Malibu Meridian (now M500) came in 2000. An unpressurized PA-46, the Matrix, was produced from 2008 to 2015. An extended range version of the M500, called the M600, began production in 2016. A high-performance version of the M600, the M700 Fury, was announced in February 2024. 

==Development==

Work on the PA-46 began in the late 1970s, with a prototype (the PA-46-300T) first flying on November 30, 1979. The type was announced in November 1982, apparently to compete with Cessna&#x27;s newest creation of the era, the P210 Centurion. Like the Centurion, the Malibu was to feature cabin pressurization , a feature not included on the prototype.

==Variants==

===PA-46-310P Malibu===

The original Malibu was the third pressurized single-engine piston civil airplane in existence, after the Mooney M22 (1965–1970) and Cessna P210N/R Pressurized Centurion (1978–1986), but has remained in production far longer. The first example of the initial production version flew in August 1982, and FAA certification was obtained in September 1983. Deliveries started two months later. 404 aircraft with Continental TSIO-520 engines were built before this model was replaced in production by the PA-46-350P Malibu Mirage.

The PA-46-310P is powered by a Continental TSIO-520BE engine rated at . The PA-46-310P has lower fuel consumption, greater range, and the ability to cruise at &quot;lean-of-peak.&quot; The PA-46-310P has a maximum cruising range of (with reserves), while the PA-46-350P initially had a maximum cruising range of only , although this is now increased to .

The PA-46-310P Malibu has set several world speed records: Seattle to New York set November 23, 1987 at ; Detroit to Washington, DC set January 4, 1989 at ; and Chicago to Toronto set on January 8, 1989, at . All three records were set by Steve Stout in his 1986 Malibu N9114B.

The Continental TSIO-520-BE powered Malibu was discontinued in 1988 following a series of incidents and accidents attributed to engine failures. One such accident resulted in a settlement in which Teledyne Continental Motors paid $32,125,000 to a pilot injured in the crash of a Malibu.

===PA-46-350P Malibu Mirage===
Production of the Malibu Mirage commenced in October 1988 for the 1989 model year. New features included a more powerful Lycoming TIO-540-AE2A engine and a new wing. Various changes have occurred over the model years. Earlier models had an all-King panel and later this became largely Garmin, the Garmin G1000 glass cockpit is now standard.

In 1995, the pilot&#x27;s windshield became a glass assembly (earlier it had been acrylic glass with a heat strip overlay). In 1996, numerous switches were moved to an overhead console. In 1999, the Mirage gained the strengthened wing designed for the turboprop Meridian.

===PA-46-500TP Malibu Meridian===
In 1997, Piper announced its intention to market a turboprop-powered version of the Malibu, and flew a prototype the following year powered by a Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada PT6A-42A of . Certification was achieved in September 2000 and deliveries began in November that year. Changes made to allow for turboprop power include larger wings and tail surfaces. In 2009, Piper began offering the Meridian with a three-screen version of the Garmin G1000 including the Garmin GFC 700 autopilot as a replacement for the Avidyne Entegra system.

Piper added wing root filets to increase wing area and of fuel capacity, a larger tailplane and reinforced wing spar and landing gear to raise MTOW to then from 2003.
For a trip, block fuel is at block speed, while its maximum cruise speed is .

===Piper M-Class===

Piper Aircraft no longer refers to their top-of-the-line aircraft with the names Malibu, Malibu Mirage or Malibu Meridian. The PA-46 line of aircraft, as of 2024, is now referred to as the Piper M-Class. The M350, M500, M600 and the newest M700 make up the M-Class line.

====M350====

The M350 is an updated version of the Mirage and is recognized as one of the safest single-engines by the airplane insurance industry.

The M350 is fitted with the same turbocharged Lycoming TIO-540-AE2A engine and Hartzell three-bladed propeller as the Mirage. Improvements over the Mirage are an Ametek digital fuel quantity system and an improved Garmin G1000 NXi flight system. The new Garmin system has envelope-protection and anti-hypoxia tools. It will initiate an emergency descent in the case that the pilot becomes incapacitated as a result of hypoxia. The M350 is capable of cruising at with a range of . The plane has a service ceiling of . No wind, standard day gross weight takeoff is achieved in and landing in .

====M500====

The M500 is an updated version of the Meridian. It also has the updated Garmin G1000 NXi flight system, like the M350. The G1000 NXi system includes an automatic wings-level function and control override to prevent exceeding the plane&#x27;s flight envelope. Its purpose is to maintain a safe, stable flight condition in the case of pilot disorientation or incapacitation. The safety feature is called Electronic Stability and Protection (ESP).
The M500 also has ADS-B, but no FADEC. The M500&#x27;s fuel tanks can carry and its Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A-42A engine burns .
It is a light plane with a maximum ramp weight of and MTOW. It cruises at at an altitude of .

====M600====
In 2015, Piper introduced the M600 (company designation PA-46-600TP), as an upgrade to the M500. The M600 is powered by a PT6A-42A engine. The new M600 is equipped with the Garmin G3000, a new wing and more fuel capacity. The aircraft is more capable than the M500, as the M600 has greater range and a slightly higher top speed. It has anti-hypoxia tools like in the M350.

It received its FAA certification on June 18, 2016. Its NBAA Instrument Flight Rules (IFR) range is , up from for the M500, and maximum cruise speed is , up from the M500&#x27;s . The M600&#x27;s MTOW is , up from the M500&#x27;s , with a fuel capacity, greater than the M500&#x27;s . The M600&#x27;s standard equipped weight is higher than the M500&#x27;s. Full-fuel payload for the M600 is compared to for the M500.

Between June 2016 and March 2018, 50 have been delivered, mostly in the U.S. and mostly are owner-flown.
It offers nearly the range of the TBM 900 for much less cost, and can operate from shorter runways than very light jets like the Eclipse 500 or the Citation Mustang.
It burns (56.3 usgal/hr) in the first hour, (50 usgal/hr) the second hour and thereafter, averaging 270 lb/hr () per hour.

Starting in 2020, Piper offered an emergency autoland system by Garmin, which initiates at the push of a button. Built into the G3000 integrated avionics for the new SLS model, the system will be a first in general aviation, along with the Cirrus Vision Jet. Piper calls the technology &quot;HALO&quot;.
Offered for $170,000 including extra equipment, it provides access to more than 9,000 runways over . Transport Canada granted approval for the HALO system on August 3, 2023.

==== M700 Fury ====

In 2024, Piper unveiled the M700 Fury (company designation PA-46-701TP) to replace the M600. The M700 is powered by a PT6A-52 engine and retains the Garmin G3000 avionics and HALO system of its predecessor. The first production M700 was the 1,000th PA-46 produced. The M700 received FAA certification on February 29, 2024, with Piper announcing that deliveries would begin immediately thereafter. In August 2024, Piper Aircraft announced that its M700 FURY received FAA certification for unpaved field operations. This approval marks a significant expansion in the aircraft&#x27;s operational capabilities, allowing it to operate in more diverse and challenging environments, including remote and undeveloped airstrips

===PA-46R-350T Matrix===

In October 2007 Piper announced the Matrix, an unpressurized version of the Mirage. The new model was designated as the PA-46R-350T, indicating retractable landing gear, , and turbocharging.

Piper Aircraft marketed the Matrix as a cabin-class aircraft for Cirrus SR-22 and Cessna 400 owners to step up to. Standard equipment on the Matrix includes a built-in oxygen system, Avidyne Entegra glass cockpit, S-Tec 55X autopilot and air conditioning.

Major options on the Matrix included a de-ice system, an &quot;Enhanced Situational Awareness Package&quot;, speed brakes, an avionics package featuring the Avidyne TAS610 dual antenna traffic advisory system, GWX-68 Weather Radar, and, beginning in 2010, the Garmin G1000 avionics system with twin 10&quot; PFD&#x27;s and a 15&quot; MFD.

As with the Malibu Mirage, Matrix&#x27;s powerplant is a turbocharged Lycoming TI0-540-AE2A producing . The aircraft&#x27;s performance includes a cruise speed of at , at and at . Maximum takeoff weight is and an empty weight of giving a standard useful load of ).

Matrix deliveries began in early 2008. Production ended in 2015.

===JetPROP===

The JetPROP is an aftermarket turbine engine conversion for the PA-46-310P Malibu and PA-46-350P Malibu Mirage offered by Rocket Engineering of Spokane, WA. Originally certified in 1998 as the JetPROP DLX with a Pratt &amp; Whitney PT6A-34 engine, conversions 90 and above used the P&amp;W PT6A-35, after the -34 was discontinued. A lower cost JetPROP DL version became available in October 2003 utilizing the P&amp;W PT6A-21. As of September 2008, 233 JetPROP conversions had been delivered. Twenty percent of the entire PA-46 fleet have been converted.

=== ZeroAvia HyFlyer ===
ZeroAvia, a Cranfield University partner, is a U.S./UK startup developing a Hydrogen fuel cell power train targeting to halve a turbine operating costs.
It flight-tests a pair of electric motors replacing the piston engine of a Piper Malibu Mirage in California.
In September 2019, the UK government granted £2.7 million ($3.3 million) for its HyFlyer demonstrator, culminating in a flight using hydrogen fuel cells.
Other partners, including the Orkney Isles-based EMEC, Cranfield Aerospace Solutions, and fuel-cell developer Intelligent Energy should match this funding. The prototype made its maiden hydrogen-powered flight at Cranfield Airport on September 24, 2020.

==Accidents and incidents==
, 225 accidents had been reported in the Aviation Safety Network wiki database, including 106 hull losses, causing 219 fatalities.

* On 21 January 2019, a 1984 PA-46-310P travelling from Nantes Atlantique Airport, France, to Cardiff Airport, Wales, crashed into the water off Alderney in the English Channel. Britain&#x27;s Air Accidents Investigation Branch found the flight had operated under Visual Flight Rules (VFR) at night, in poor weather conditions, despite the pilot having no training in night flying and a lack of recent practice in instrument flying; as well as possible carbon monoxide poisoning of the pilot with no working sensor on board. The plane was carrying Argentine footballer Emiliano Sala, who had been signed by Cardiff City from FC Nantes two days earlier. The plane&#x27;s wreckage was discovered on the seabed of the English Channel on 3 February, and Sala was confirmed to be dead on 7 February.

*On 30 June 2024, a Piper Malibu, registration N85PG, en route from Oneonta, New York to Charleston, West Virginia crashed in the hamlet of Trout Creek, New York, killing the pilot and his four passengers. The cause of the accident is under investigation.

*On 29 July 2024 a Piper Malibu, registration D-EOSE, en route from Goose Bay, Canada, to Narsarsuaq, Greenland, ditched in the sea near Qaqortoq, about 30 nm short of Narsarsuaq. The German pilots made a Mayday call and deployed their life raft; the Danish Arctic Command despatched an aircraft which quickly located the life raft and guided the Danish Navy ship &quot;Triton&quot; to pick up the pilots.

<text>Mole crickets are members of the insect family Gryllotalpidae, in the order Orthoptera (grasshoppers, locusts, and crickets). Mole crickets are cylindrical-bodied, fossorial insects about long as adults, with small eyes and shovel-like fore limbs highly developed for burrowing. They are present in many parts of the world and where they have arrived in new regions, may become agricultural pests.

Mole crickets have three life stages: eggs, nymphs, and adults. Most of their lives in these stages are spent underground, but adults have wings and disperse in the breeding season. They vary in their diet: some species are herbivores, mainly feeding on roots; others are omnivores, including worms and grubs in their diet; and a few are largely predatory. Male mole crickets have an exceptionally loud song; they sing from a burrow that opens out into the air in the shape of an exponential horn. The song is an almost pure tone, modulated into chirps. It is used to attract females, either for mating, or for indicating favourable habitats for them to lay their eggs.

In Zambia, mole crickets are thought to bring good fortune, while in Latin America, they are said to predict rain. In Florida, where &quot;Neoscapteriscus&quot; mole crickets are not native, they are considered pests, and various biological controls have been used. &quot;Gryllotalpa&quot; species have been used as food in West Java, Vietnam, Thailand, Laos, and the Philippines.

==Description==
Mole crickets vary in size and appearance, but most of them are of moderate size for an insect, typically between long as adults. They are adapted for underground life and are cylindrical in shape and covered with fine, dense hairs. The head, fore limbs, and prothorax are heavily sclerotised, but the abdomen is rather soft. The head bears two threadlike antennae and a pair of beady eyes. The two pairs of wings are folded flat over the abdomen; in most species, the fore wings are short and rounded and the hind wings are membranous and reach or exceed the tip of the abdomen; however, in some species, the hind wings are reduced in size and the insect is unable to fly. The fore legs are flattened for digging, but the hind legs are shaped somewhat like the legs of a true cricket; however, these limbs are more adapted for pushing soil, rather than leaping, which they do rarely and poorly. The nymphs resemble the adults apart from the absence of wings and genitalia; the wing pads become larger after each successive moult.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The Gryllotalpidae are a monophyletic group in the order Orthoptera (grasshoppers, locusts, and crickets). Cladistic analysis of mole cricket morphology in 2015 identified six tribes, of which four were then new: Indioscaptorini (Scapteriscinae), Triamescaptorini, Gryllotalpellini and Neocurtillini (Gryllotalpinae), and two existing tribes, Scapteriscini and Gryllotalpini, are revised. 
The group name is derived straightforwardly from Latin &quot;gryllus&quot;, cricket, and &quot;talpa&quot;, mole.

Within the extant subfamilies, genera include:

===Gryllotalpinae===
* tribe Gryllotalpellini Cadena-Castañeda, 2015 (South America)
** &quot;Gryllotalpella&quot;
* tribe Gryllotalpini Leach, 1815 (World-wide)
** &quot;Gryllotalpa&quot;
* tribe Neocurtillini Cadena-Castañeda, 2015 (Americas)
** &quot;Leptocurtilla&quot;
** &quot;Neocurtilla&quot;
* tribe Triamescaptorini Cadena-Castañeda, 2015 (New Zealand)
** &quot;Triamescaptor&quot;
* tribe &quot;incertae sedis&quot;
** †genus &quot;Pterotriamescaptor&quot;
** †genus &quot;Burmagryllotalpa&quot; Burmese amber, Myanmar, Cenomanian

===Scapteriscinae===
* tribe Indioscaptorini Cadena-Castañeda, 2015 (Indian Subcontinent)
** &quot;Indioscaptor&quot;
* tribe Scapteriscini Zeuner, 1939 (Americas)
** &quot;Scapteriscus&quot;
** &quot;Neoscapteriscus&quot;

=== †subfamily Marchandiinae ===
* †&quot;Archaeogryllotalpoides&quot; Martins-Neto 1991 Crato Formation, Brazil, Aptian
* †&quot;Cratotetraspinus&quot; Martins-Neto 1997 Crato Formation, Brazil, Aptian
* †&quot;Marchandia&quot; Perrichot et al. 2002 Charentese amber, France, Cenomanian
* †&quot;Palaeoscapteriscops&quot; Martins-Neto 1991 Crato Formation, Brazil, Aptian

=== &quot;Incertae sedis&quot; ===
* †&quot;Tresdigitus rectanguli&quot; Burmese amber, Myanmar, Cenomanian

Mole cricket fossils are rare. A stem group fossil, &quot;Cratotetraspinus&quot;, is known from the Lower Cretaceous of Brazil. Two specimens of &quot;Marchandia magnifica&quot; in amber have been found in the Lower Cretaceous of Charente-Maritime in France. They are somewhat more abundant in the Tertiary amber of the Baltic and Dominican regions; impressions are found in Europe and the American Green River Formation.

===Convergent evolution===
Mole crickets are not closely related to the &quot;pygmy mole crickets&quot;, the Tridactyloidea, which are in the grasshopper suborder Caelifera rather than the cricket suborder Ensifera. The two groups, and indeed their resemblance in form to the mammalian mole family Talpidae with their powerful front limbs, form an example of convergent evolution, both developing adaptations for burrowing.

==Behavior==
Adults of most species of mole cricket can fly powerfully, if not with agility, but males do so infrequently. The females typically take wing soon after sunset, and are attracted to areas where males are calling, which they do for about an hour after sunset. This may be to mate, or they may be influenced by the suitability of the habitat for egg-laying, as demonstrated by the number of males present and calling in the vicinity.

===Life cycle===
Mole crickets undergo incomplete metamorphosis; when nymphs hatch from eggs, they increasingly resemble the adult form as they grow and pass through a series of up to 10 moults. After mating, a period of 1–2 weeks may occur before the female starts laying eggs. She burrows into the soil to a depth of , ( has been seen in the laboratory), and lays a clutch of 25 to 60 eggs. &quot;Neoscapteriscus&quot; females then retire, sealing the entrance passage, but in &quot;Gryllotalpa&quot; and &quot;Neocurtilla&quot; species, the female has been observed to remain in an adjoining chamber to tend the clutch. Further clutches may follow over several months, according to species. Eggs must be laid in moist ground, and many nymphs die because of insufficient moisture in the soil. The eggs hatch in a few weeks, and as they grow, the nymphs consume a great deal of plant material either underground or on the surface. 
The adults of some species of mole crickets may move as far as during the breeding season. Mole crickets are active most of the year, but overwinter as nymphs or adults in cooler climates, resuming activity in the spring.

===Burrowing===
Mole crickets live almost entirely below ground, digging tunnels of different kinds for the major functions of life, including feeding, escape from predators, attracting a mate (by singing), mating, and raising of young.

Their main tunnels are used for feeding and for escape; they can dig themselves under ground very rapidly, and can move along existing tunnels at high speed both forwards and backwards. Their digging technique is to force the soil to either side with their powerful, shovel-like fore limbs, which are broad, flattened, toothed, and heavily sclerotised (the cuticle is hardened and darkened).

Males attract mates by constructing specially shaped tunnels in which they sing. Mating takes place in the male&#x27;s burrow; the male may widen a tunnel to make room for the female to mount, though in some species, mating is tail-to-tail. Females lay their eggs either in their normal burrows or in specially dug brood chambers, which are sealed when complete in the case of the genus &quot;Neoscapteriscus&quot; or not sealed in the case of genera &quot;Gryllotalpa&quot; and &quot;Neocurtilla&quot;.

===Song===

Male mole crickets sing by stridulating, always under ground. In &quot;Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa&quot;, the song is based on an almost pure tone at 3.5 kHz, loud enough to make the ground vibrate 20 cm all round the burrow; in fact, the song is unique in each species. In &quot;G. gryllotalpa&quot;, the burrow is somewhat roughly sculpted; in &quot;G. vineae&quot;, the burrow is smooth and carefully shaped, with no irregularities larger than 1 mm. In both species, the burrow has two openings at the soil surface; at the other end is a constriction, then a resonating bulb, and then an escape tunnel. A burrow is used for at least a week. The male positions himself head down with his head in the bulb, and his tail is near the fork in the tunnel.

Mole crickets stridulate like other crickets by scraping the rear edge of the left fore wing, which forms a plectrum, against the lower surface of the right fore wing, which has a ratchet-like series of asymmetric teeth; the more acute edges face backwards, as do those of the plectrum. The plectrum can move forward with little resistance, but moving it backwards makes it catch each tooth, setting up a vibration in both wings. The sound-producing stroke is the raising (levation) of the wings. The resulting song resembles the result of modulating a pure tone with a 66-Hz wave to form regular chirps. In &quot;G. vineae&quot;, the wing levator muscle, which weighs 50 mg, can deliver 3.5 milliwatts of mechanical power; &quot;G. gryllotalpa&quot; can deliver about 1 milliwatt. &quot;G. vineae&quot; produces an exceptionally loud song from half an hour after sunset, continuing for an hour; it can be heard up to 600 m away. At a distance of 1 m from the burrow, the sound has a mean power over the stridulation cycle up to 88 decibels; the loudest recorded peak power was about 92 decibels; at the mouths of the burrow, the sound reaches around 115 decibels. &quot;G. gryllotalpa&quot; can deliver a peak sound pressure of 72 decibels and a mean of about 66 decibels. The throat of the horn appears to be tuned (offering low inductive reactance), making the burrow radiate sound efficiently; the efficiency increases when the burrow is wet and absorbs less sound. Mole crickets are the only insects that construct a sound-producing apparatus. Given the known sensitivity of a cricket&#x27;s hearing (60 decibels), a night-flying &quot;G. vineae&quot; female should be able to detect the male&#x27;s song at a range of 30 m; this compares to about 5 m for a typical &quot;Gryllus&quot; cricket that does not construct a burrow.

The loudness of the song is correlated with the size of the male and the quality of the habitat, both indicators of male attractiveness. The loudest males may attract 20 females in one evening, while a quieter male may attract none. This behaviour enables acoustic trapping; females can be trapped in large numbers by broadcasting a male&#x27;s song very loudly.

===Food===
Mole crickets vary in their diets; some like the tawny mole cricket are herbivores, others are omnivores, feeding on larvae, worms, roots, and grasses, and others like the southern mole cricket are mainly predacious. They leave their burrows at night to forage for leaves and stems, which they drag underground before consumption, as well as consuming roots underground.

====Predators, parasites, and pathogens====
Besides birds, toads, and insectivorous mammals, the predators of mole crickets include subterranean assassin bugs, wolf spiders, and various beetles. The South American nematode &quot;Steinernema scapterisci&quot; kills &quot;Neocapteriscus&quot; mole crickets by introducing bacteria into their bodies, causing an overwhelming infection. &quot;Steinernema neocurtillae&quot; is native to Florida and attacks native &quot;Neocurtilla hexadactyla&quot; mole crickets. Parasitoid wasps of the genus &quot;Larra&quot; (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) attack mole crickets, the female laying an egg on the external surface of the mole cricket, and the larva developing externally on the mole cricket host. &quot;Ormia depleta&quot; (Diptera: Tachinidae) is a specialized parasitoid of mole crickets in the genus &quot;Neoscapteriscus&quot;; the fly&#x27;s larvae hatch from eggs inside her abdomen; she is attracted by the call of the male mole cricket and deposits a larva or more on any mole cricket individual (just as many females as males) with which she comes in contact. Specialist predators of mole cricket eggs in China and Japan include the bombardier beetle &quot;Stenaptinus jessoensis&quot;, whereas in South America, they include the bombardier beetle &quot;Pheropsophus aequinoctialis&quot; (Coleoptera: Carabidae); the adult beetle lays eggs near the burrows of mole crickets, and the beetle larvae find their way to the egg chamber and eat the eggs. Fungal diseases can devastate mole cricket populations during winters with sudden rises of temperature and thaws. The fungus &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot; can overwhelm adult mole crickets and several other fungal, microsporidian, and viral pathogens have been identified. 
Mole crickets evade predators by living below ground, and vigorously burrowing if disturbed at the surface. As a last-ditch defence, they eject a foul-smelling brown liquid from their anal glands when captured; they can also bite.

==Distribution==
Mole crickets are relatively common, but because they are nocturnal and spend nearly all their lives under ground in extensive tunnel systems, they are rarely seen. They inhabit agricultural fields and grassy areas. They are present in every continent except Antarctica; by 2014, 107 species had been described and more species are likely to be discovered, especially in Asia. &quot;Neoscapteriscus didactylus&quot; is a pest species, originating in South America; it has spread to the West Indies and New South Wales in Australia. &quot;Gryllotalpa africana&quot; is a major pest in South Africa; other &quot;Gryllotalpa&quot; species are widely distributed in Europe, Asia, and Australia. They are native to Britain (as to Western Europe), but the former population of &quot;G. gryllotalpa&quot; may now be extinct in mainland Britain, surviving in the Channel Islands.

===Invasive mole crickets and their biological control===
Invasive species are those that cause harm in their newly occupied area, where biological control may be attempted. The first-detected invasive mole cricket species was &quot;Neoscapteriscus didactylus&quot;, a South American species reported as a pest in St. Vincent, West Indies, as early as 1837; by 1900, it was a major agricultural pest in Puerto Rico. It had probably slowly expanded its range northwards, island by island, from South America. The only biological control program against &quot;N. didactylus&quot; was in Puerto Rico, and it succeeded in establishing the parasitoid wasp &quot;Larra bicolor&quot; from Amazonian Brazil. In 2001, &quot;N. didactylus&quot; in Puerto Rico seemed to be a pest only in irrigated crops and turf. Small-scale experimental applications of the nematode &quot;Steinernema scapterisci&quot; were made in irrigated turf, but survival of the nematode was poor. Very much later, this same species was reported as a pest in Queensland, Australia, presumably arriving by ship or plane. The next-detected invasive species was in the late 19th century in Hawaii, probably by ship. It was named as &quot;Gryllotalpa africana&quot;, but much later as perhaps &quot;G. orientalis&quot;. It was not identified as &quot;Gryllotalpa krishnani&quot; until 2020. It attacked sugarcane and was targeted with &quot;Larra polita&quot; from the Philippines in 1925, apparently successfully.

The next detection was in Georgia, USA, and at that time was assumed to be &quot;N. didactylus&quot; from the West Indies. It was, in fact, three South American &quot;Neoscapteriscus&quot; species, &quot;N. abbreviatus&quot;, &quot;N . vicinus&quot;, and &quot;N. borellii&quot;, probably having arrived in ship ballast. They caused major problems for decades as they spread in the Southeastern USA.&quot;Scapteriscus&quot; mole cricket populations had built up since the early decades of the 20th century and damaged pastures, lawns, playing fields, and vegetable crops. From the late 1940s, chlordane had been the insecticide of choice to control them, but when chlordane was banned by the U.S. EPA in the 1970s, ranchers were left with no economic and effective control method. Especially to aid Florida ranchers, a project that became known as the UF/IFAS Mole Cricket Research Program was initiated in 1978. In 1985, a multiple-authored report was published on accomplishments. In 1988, an account was published on prospects for biological control, and in 1996 an account of promising results with biological control. The program ended in 2004 after 25 years of running monitoring stations, and in 2006 a summary publication announced success: a 95% reduction in mole cricket numbers in northern Florida, with biological control agents spreading potentially to all parts of Florida. Efforts to use &quot;Larra bicolor&quot; as a biological control agent in Florida began by importing a stock from Puerto Rico. It became established in a small area of southeastern Florida, but had little effect on &quot;Neoscapteriscus&quot; populations. A stock from Bolivia became established in northern Florida and spread widely (with some help) to most of the rest of the state and neighboring states. Its survival depends upon the availability of suitable nectar sources.

Once gravid female &quot;Ormia depleta&quot; flies were found to be attracted to the song of &quot;Neoscapteriscus&quot; males in South America, a path to trap these flies with synthetic mole cricket songs was opened. Experimentation then led to a rearing method. Laborious rearing of over 10,000 flies on mole cricket hosts allowed releases of living fly pupae at many sites in Florida from the far northwest to the far south, mainly on golf courses, and mainly in 1989-1991. Populations were established, began to spread, and were monitored by use of synthetic mole cricket song. Eventually, the flies were found to have a continuous population from about 29°N then south to Miami, but the flies failed to survive the winter north of about 29°N. Shipment and release of the flies to states north of Florida was thus a wasted effort. As the flies had been imported from 23°S in Brazil and could not overwinter north of 29°N, whether flies from 30°S in Brazil might survive better in northern Florida was investigated in 1999, but they did not.

The third biological control agent to target &quot;Neoscapteriscus&quot; in Florida was the South American nematode &quot;Steinernema scapterisci&quot;. Small-scale releases proved it could persist for years in mole cricket-infested sandy Florida soils. Its use as a biopesticide against &quot;Neoscapteriscus&quot; was patented, making it attractive to industry. Industrial-scale production on artificial diet allowed large-scale trial applications in pastures and on golf courses, which succeeded in establishing populations in several counties, and these populations spread, but sales were disappointing, and the product was withdrawn from the market in 2014. Although experimental application was made in states north of Florida, only in southern Georgia was establishment of the nematode verified, suggesting little interest in the other states.

===As pests===
The main damage done by mole crickets is as a result of their burrowing activities. As they tunnel through the top few centimetres of soil, they push the ground up in little ridges, increasing evaporation of surface moisture, disturbing germinating seeds, and damaging the delicate young roots of seedlings. They are also injurious to turf and pasture grasses as they feed on their roots, leaving the plants prone to drying out and damage by use.

In their native lands, mole crickets have natural enemies that keep them under control. This is not the case when they have been accidentally introduced to other parts of the world. In Florida from the 1940s through the 1980s, they were considered pests and were described as &quot;a serious problem&quot;. Their population densities have since declined greatly. A University of Florida entomology report suggests that South American &quot;Neoscapteriscus&quot; mole crickets may have entered the United States at Brunswick, Georgia, in ship&#x27;s ballast from southern South America around 1899, but were at that time mistakenly believed to be from the West Indies. One possible remedy was biological pest control using the parasitoidal wasps &quot;Larra bicolor&quot;. Another remedy that has been successfully applied is use of the parasitic nematode &quot;Steinernema scapterisci&quot;. When this is applied in strips across grassland, it spreads throughout the pasture (and potentially beyond) within a few months and not only controls the mole crickets, but also remains infective in the soil for future years.

==In human culture==
===Folklore and Literature===
In Zambia, &quot;Gryllotalpa africana&quot; is held to bring good fortune to anyone who sees it.

In Uganda, they are believed to announce the death of a family member or a loved one. In ancient days, if it was found in the house, the elders advised the people to kill the bugs whilst crying so that it dies with the sorrow it had brought to the family.

In Latin America, &quot;Scapteriscus&quot; and &quot;Neocurtilla&quot; mole crickets are said to predict rain when they dig into the ground.

In Japan, in the past, they seem to have been associated with the worms/corpses/bugs that announce a person&#x27;s sins to heaven in the Koshin or Koushin belief.

In ancient a Chinese poetry by Zhuang Zhou the poet’s own death is depicted in chapter 32 and features mole crickets:

===As food===
&quot;Gryllotalpa&quot; mole crickets have sometimes been used as food in West Java and Vietnam. In Thailand, mole crickets () are valued as food in Isan. They are usually eaten fried along with sticky rice.

In the Philippines, they are served as a delicacy called &quot;camaro&quot; in the province of Pampanga and are a tourist attraction. They are also served in parts of Northern Luzon. &quot;Ararawan&quot; or &quot;susuhong&quot; in Ilocano language is a delicacy or exotic food than june beetle or salagubang. It is found in Vintar, Ilocos Norte and is sold at P900 per kilo.

<text>Det Akademiske Kvarter, more commonly known as Kvarteret, is a student cultural center in Bergen, Norway. It is situated on Olav Kyrres gate in the center of Bergen, within walking distance of both the main shopping areas and the University of Bergen.

==History==

Kvarteret hosts a huge number of events each year, ranging from debates and lectures to concerts.
The house is run by about 400 volunteer students. In addition to hosting cultural events, it offers the volunteers experience as sound technicians, bartenders, photographers and system administrators. The students who work here primarily come from the University of Bergen as well as from the Norwegian School of Economics (&quot;Norges Handelshøyskole&quot;) and Bergen University College (&quot;Høgskolen i Bergen&quot;).

Kvarteret has an old exterior, but the interior is roughly 10 years old. The house was formerly the property of the University, but was given over to the students to be the cultural centre of student activities in 1995. At that time, the house&#x27;s interior was completely rehabilitated. Kvarteret was reopened February 5, 2010 after three years of reconstruction. There are now several pubs, a cinema, nightclub, small café, auditorium and concert hall.

==Affiliates==
Though Kvarteret hosts a variety of cultural events, none of them are actually organized by Kvarteret itself. Numerous organizations use the building for their cultural activities. These include the Bergen student community (&quot;Studentersamfunnet i Bergen&quot;), Immaturus student theater club (&quot;Studentteateret Immaturus&quot;), Active student association (&quot;Aktive Studenters Forening&quot;), Bergen Realist Association (&quot;Bergen Realistforening&quot;) and the Bergen film club (&quot;Bergen Filmklubben&quot;).

<text>The Cincinnati Mighty Ducks were a professional ice hockey team based in Cincinnati, Ohio. They were members of the American Hockey League, and played their home games at the Cincinnati Gardens. Throughout their existence they were the primary minor league affiliate of the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim of the National Hockey League, with a three-year shared affiliation with the Detroit Red Wings.

==History==
In 1997, the Baltimore Bandits franchise was losing money and accruing debts in Baltimore. Jerry Robinson, owner of the Cincinnati Gardens arena, purchased the Bandits franchise to play at the Gardens, replacing the previous hockey tenant, the Cincinnati Cyclones of the International Hockey League. The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim signed Cincinnati to a five-year affiliate agreement. From 1999 through 2002 team shared its affiliation with the Detroit Red Wings, until the Red Wings affiliated with the Grand Rapids Griffins. Anaheim maintained their affiliation with Cincinnati through the 2004-05 season. The Cincinnati Mighty Ducks were granted a voluntary suspension for the 2005–06 season two days after Anaheim and Cincinnati ended their affiliation, and Cincinnati could not find a replacement NHL affiliate. In October 2005, the team was renamed the Cincinnati RailRaiders, and was seeking an affiliation agreement for a return in 2006-07 season, but failed to reach a goal of 2,000 season tickets sold to become re-active.

On October 3, 2006, it was reported that a Windsor, Ontario-based company had been granted conditional approval to purchase and relocate the team, however that deal fell through. On March 19, 2007, the AHL announced that the team had been purchased, and moved to Rockford, Illinois, to become the Rockford IceHogs.

The market was previously served by:
* Cincinnati Mohawks (1949–1952 AHL, 1952–1958 IHL)
* Cincinnati Wings (1963–1964 CHL)
* Cincinnati Swords (1971–1974 AHL)
* Cincinnati Stingers (1975–1979 WHA, 1979–1980 CHL)
* Cincinnati Tigers (1981–1982 CHL)
* Cincinnati Cyclones (1990–1992 ECHL, 1992–2001 IHL, 2001–2004 ECHL)
The team was replaced in this market by:
*Cincinnati Cyclones of the ECHL (2006–present)
Affiliates
*Mighty Ducks Of Anaheim (1997-2005)
*Detroit Red Wings (1999-2002)

<text>Richard Tauber (16 May 1891 – 8 January 1948) was an Austrian lyric tenor and film actor. He performed the tenor role in numerous operas, including &quot;Don Giovanni&quot; by Mozart and Lorenzo Da Ponte.

==Early life==
Richard Tauber was born in Linz, Austria, to Elisabeth Seifferth (née Denemy), a widow and actress who performed soubrette roles at the local theater, and Richard Anton Tauber, an actor. His parents were not married, and his father was reportedly unaware of his birth as he was touring North America at the time. The child was named Richard Denemy. He was sometimes known as [Carl] Richard Tauber and also used his mother&#x27;s married name, Seiffert; however, the claim by the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; that he was ever known as Ernst Seiffert is not supported by any of the 12 published books and monographs about him listed in Daniel O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s comprehensive Richard Tauber Chronology. After being adopted by his father in 1913, his legal name became Richard Denemy-Tauber.

Tauber accompanied his mother on theatrical tours, but she found it increasingly difficult to manage and eventually left him with foster parents in Urfahr, now a suburb of Linz. In 1897–98, he attended school in Linz, after which his father assumed responsibility for his upbringing, moving him to Graz, Prague, Berlin, Salzburg, and finally Wiesbaden. His father, who was born Jewish, but had converted to Roman Catholicism, hoped his son would become a priest. However, the boy missed the excitement of the theater and instead joined his father in Prague and later, in 1903, at the theater in Wiesbaden. 

Although Tauber aspired to become a singer, he failed to impress the teachers he auditioned for, likely because he chose to sing Wagner, a repertoire unsuited to his voice. His father enrolled him at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt to study piano, composition, and conducting. Tauber made rapid progress in his studies but remained determined to pursue a career as a singer.

==Early career==
After an intensive period of vocal training under Carl Beines, Tauber made his public debut at a concert in Freiburg on 17 May 1912. That same year, his father was appointed Intendant of the Municipal Theater in Chemnitz, which allowed him to arrange Tauber&#x27;s debut as Tamino in &quot;The Magic Flute&quot; on 2 March 1913. A few weeks later, on 16 April, Tauber performed the role of Max in &quot;Der Freischütz&quot;. This performance was attended by of the Dresden Opera, who had already offered Tauber a five-year contract starting on 1 August. The Count encouraged Tauber to take small roles with other companies to broaden his experience. 

During his tenure in Dresden, Tauber earned a reputation as an exceptionally quick learner. He mastered Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; in 48 hours and learned Bacchus in Richard Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Ariadne auf Naxos&quot; overnight, astonishing Strauss, who conducted the performance in Berlin. This earned him the nickname &quot;the SOS Tenor.&quot; In 1926, he rescued the German premiere of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Turandot&quot; at the Staatsoper Dresden by learning the role of Calaf in three days after tenor Curt Taucher fell ill.

After guest appearances at the Wiener Volksoper in 1920, Tauber made his Vienna State Opera debut on 16 June in &quot;La bohème&quot;, stepping in for an indisposed Alfred Piccaver. In 1922, he signed a five-year contract with the Vienna State Opera and subsequently performed with the Berlin State Opera. For many years, he divided his time between these two companies, spending four months with each, while reserving the remaining months for concerts, guest appearances with other companies, and international tours. 

Tauber sang tenor roles in numerous operas, including &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, &quot;The Bartered Bride&quot;, &quot;Tosca&quot;, &quot;Mignon&quot;, &quot;Faust&quot;, &quot;Carmen&quot;, and &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;. He also appeared in modern works such as Erich Korngold&#x27;s &quot;Die tote Stadt&quot; and Wilhelm Kienzl&#x27;s &quot;Der Evangelimann&quot;. According to Daniel O&#x27;Hara&#x27;s Tauber Chronology, he performed over 100 roles in opera and operetta.

In June 1919, Tauber made the first of more than seven hundred gramophone records. All his vocal recordings were produced for the Odeon Records label, and from 1933 onwards, for the associated Parlophone label. Tauber&#x27;s lyrical, flexible tenor voice was renowned for its warm, elegant legato. His exceptional breath control allowed him to produce a superb head voice, remarkable &quot;messa di voce&quot;, and exquisite pianissimo. His physical appearance also contributed to his elegant stage presence, despite a slight squint in his right eye, which he camouflaged by wearing a monocle. When paired with a top hat, the monocle enhanced his distinctive and sophisticated look.

Tauber first performed in an operetta by Franz Lehár at the Volksbühne in Berlin in 1920. This was &quot;Zigeunerliebe&quot;, a role he also performed in Linz and Salzburg in 1921. In 1922, he was offered the role of Armand in Lehár&#x27;s &quot;&quot; at the Theater an der Wien, and the experience was a resounding success. Although some critics looked down on his venture into operetta, it proved beneficial for Tauber, helping him gain a new audience and revitalizing Lehár&#x27;s career as a composer of operetta. In the years that followed, Lehár composed several operettas with roles written specifically for Richard Tauber, including &quot;Paganini&quot; (1925, although Tauber was unavailable for the Vienna premiere and first performed it in Berlin in 1926), &quot;Der Zarewitsch&quot; (1927), &quot;Friederike&quot; (1928), &quot;The Land of Smiles&quot; (1929), which featured the famous aria &quot;Dein ist mein ganzes Herz&quot;, &quot;Schön ist die Welt&quot; (1930), and &quot;Giuditta&quot; (1934). The hit songs, typically in the second act, became informally known as &quot;Tauberlieder&quot;. 

Tauber also appeared in several films, both in Germany and later in England. Notably, he provided a &#x27;voice-over&#x27;, singing the title song in the otherwise silent film &quot;I Kiss Your Hand, Madame&quot; (1929).

While in Vienna, Tauber also conducted at the Theater an der Wien, where, in 1924, he met the soprano Carlotta Vanconti. She soon divorced her Italian husband and married Tauber on 18 March 1926. They separated in 1928 and divorced later that same year in Berlin. However, the divorce was only legally recognized in Germany. In 1929, Tauber met Mary Losseff at Rudolf Nelson&#x27;s review in Berlin, and they lived together for about five years. Losseff became his muse, and it was for her that he composed &quot;Der singende Traum&quot;. Although Losseff&#x27;s career was cut short by alcoholism, Tauber remained her lifelong friend and supported her until his death.

In 1931, Tauber made his London debut in operetta, and London performances became a regular part of his schedule. He also toured the United States that same year. In 1933, Tauber was attacked in the street by a group of Nazi Brownshirts due to his Jewish ancestry. Following the assault, he decided to leave Germany for his native Austria, where he continued to perform at the Vienna State Opera until the &quot;Anschluss&quot; in March 1938.

During the mid-1930s, Tauber made several musical films in England. In April 1935, at the premiere of the film &quot;Mimi&quot;, he met the English actress Diana Napier (1905–1982). After protracted legal proceedings to secure an Austrian divorce from Vanconti, they married on 20 June 1936. Napier appeared in three of his British films: &quot;Heart&#x27;s Desire&quot; (1935), &quot;Land Without Music&quot;, and &quot;Pagliacci&quot; (both 1936).

==Later career==
In 1938, Tauber made his London operatic debut in &quot;Die Zauberflöte&quot; under Sir Thomas Beecham. Earlier that year, the Nazi government of Germany annexed Austria, and Tauber left for good. In response, the Nazis withdrew the Taubers&#x27; passports and right of abode; this left the couple technically stateless, prompting Tauber to apply for British citizenship. He was touring South Africa when World War II broke out and returned to Switzerland until receiving the papers allowing him to enter the UK in March 1940. Germany had banned recordings of his music in 1937.

Despite receiving lucrative offers from the United States, he remained in the UK throughout the war. With little opera staged in wartime Britain, he earned a living by singing, conducting, and making gramophone records and radio broadcasts. He even composed English operettas with lyricist Fred S. Tysh. From one of these, &quot;Old Chelsea&quot;, the song &quot;My Heart and I&quot; became one of his most popular English recordings. It was only these English records that generated royalties for him; for his earlier recordings, he had been paid per performance and had been forced to leave his savings behind in Austria. By this time, he was so crippled by arthritis that he could no longer move in and out of the microphone for softer and louder notes. To address this, a small trolley was constructed on rubber wheels, allowing engineers to silently roll him back and forth while recording.

In 1946, Tauber appeared in a Broadway adaptation of &quot;The Land of Smiles&quot; (&quot;Yours is my Heart&quot;), which flopped, leaving him with huge personal losses and in debt to the backers. He was thus forced to tour the United States, Canada, Central, and South America for six months to recoup the losses, with Arpad Sandor and George Schick serving as his accompanists, and Neil Chotem as an assisting artist. In April 1947, Tauber returned to London and sought medical attention for a persistent cough. He was eventually diagnosed with lung cancer: one lung was already useless, and the other nearly so.

The Vienna State Opera was in London for a short season at the Royal Opera House – their first visit since the war – and they invited Tauber to sing one performance with his old company. On 27 September 1947, he sang the role of Don Ottavio in &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, a relatively small part but with two difficult arias that demand good breath control. Those in the audience reported that he sang wonderfully, earning loud applause. Live excerpts of these two arias from this performance survive, revealing a tone of undiminished focus and steadiness, a good line, and somewhat shortened phrasing.

==Death==
Three days after his last performance, Tauber entered Guy&#x27;s Hospital on October 1, 1947, to have his left lung removed to treat the cancer. Despite this, he died of complications on January 8, 1948, at the London Clinic, Devonshire Place. His Requiem Mass was held at St. James&#x27;s Church, Spanish Place. He was interred in Brompton Cemetery in London.

==Selected discography==
Tauber made over 720 vocal recordings for the Odeon/Parlophone companies, as well as several as an orchestral conductor, primarily of his own works, but also of music by Grieg and Johann Strauss, Jr.. Among the 120 acoustic recordings, the most notable include arias by Mozart, Tchaikovsky, and Kienzl, along with songs by Schumann, Richard Strauss, and Grieg. Additionally, there are five duets with Elisabeth Rethberg, arias by Verdi, Puccini, and others, as well as excerpts from Korngold&#x27;s &quot;Die tote Stadt&quot;, including a duet with Lotte Lehmann. Among the electrical recordings are albums of German folksongs, 12 songs from Schubert&#x27;s &quot;Winterreise&quot;, accompanied by Mischa Spoliansky, and an album of folksongs by Franz Gabriel and Hermann Löns. Perhaps most prized are the four Mozart arias recorded in 1938 and 1939, and the aria from &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; made in 1946. Among his final recordings are two songs by Richard Strauss, accompanied at the piano by Percy Kahn. During his lifetime, his numerous recordings of music by Franz Lehár, much of which was composed specifically for him, and his own songs from the operetta &quot;Old Chelsea&quot; (1942) were bestsellers, alongside a vast array of lighter and popular music in both German and English. A number of his broadcasts have been preserved, including a series of General Motors Concerts from America in 1937, a Radio Hilversum concert from 1939, and excerpts from his three series of weekly programs for the BBC (1945–47).

<text>Revillagigedo Channel (, , locally Revilla, ) is an ocean channel in the Alexander Archipelago of the U.S. state of Alaska. Extending 56 km (35 mi) northwest from the Dixon Entrance, it lies between the mainland to the east, Revillagigedo Island to the north, and Duke Island and Annette Island to the southwest. It is part of the Inside Passage to Ketchikan.

The channel was named for Juan Vicente de Güemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, viceroy of New Spain, in 1793.

The Tree Point Light is an important aid to navigation in Revillagigedo Channel.

<text>Clarence Strait, originally Duke of Clarence Strait, is a strait in southeastern Alaska, in the United States in the Alexander Archipelago. The strait separates Prince of Wales Island, on the west side, from Revillagigedo Island and Annette Island, on the east side. Clarence Strait is long, extending from Dixon Entrance to Sumner Strait. Moira Sound is on the west side of the strait.

Clarence Strait was named in 1793 by George Vancouver in honor of Prince William, Duke of Clarence. Jacinto Caamaño, who had explored the region a year before Vancouver, named the strait Entrada de Nuestra Senora del Carmen.

The Guard Island Light and Lincoln Rocks Light, both located adjacent to Clarence Strait, were important aids-to-navigation in the Clarence Strait area in the pre-automated era.

==Swimming==
The first person to swim across Clarence Strait was Michelle Macy, who accomplished the feat in 6 hours 46 minutes on 5 July 2010.

<doc id="924369" wikidata="Q312465" url="?curid=924369" title="BTR-152">
<text>The BTR-152 is a six-wheeled Soviet armoured personnel carrier (APC) built on the chassis and drive train of a ZIS-151 utility truck. It entered service with a number of Warsaw Pact member states beginning in 1950, and formed the mainstay of Soviet motor rifle battalions until the advent of the amphibious BTR-60 series during the 1960s. BTR stands for &quot;bronetransportyor&quot; ().

BTR-152s were available in several marks, and were manufactured in large numbers for the Soviet military and export. Late production models utilized automotive components from the more reliable ZIL-157 truck. Three primary variants of the BTR-152 appeared between 1950 and 1959: the base armored personnel carrier with a single pintle-mounted 7.62mm or 12.7mm machine gun, an unarmed command vehicle with a higher roofline, and an anti-aircraft variant armed with a ZPU-2 mount. BTR-152s could carry a single infantry squad each, or specialist weapons teams along with their mortars and anti-tank equipment. In Soviet service, a number were also deployed as artillery tractors.

==History==
===Development===
During World War II, Red Army tacticians favored combined arms offensives, which emphasized the deployment of light infantry in concert with tanks. However, the Soviet infantrymen lacked the armored protection and rapid mobility of the tanks, and remained comparatively vulnerable to enemy fire.

By the end of the war, the initial Soviet tactic of tank desant, in which the infantry rode into battle atop the tanks they were supporting, had been superseded by the introduction of M3 Half-tracks and M3 White armored cars. These were widely used for troop transport, giving rise to a new doctrine in which armored vehicles capable of keeping pace with tanks brought infantry to an engagement. The infantrymen would then disembark and enter combat on foot.

Wartime experiences demonstrated that the Red Army had an urgent postwar requirement for more wheeled armored vehicles, and the general staff specified a new reconnaissance vehicle and armored personnel carrier (APC). The APC had to be capable of transporting at least eight troops. A new design bureau at the Gorkovsky Avtomobilny Zavod (GAZ) was set up to study potential concepts accordingly; their final prototype, the &quot;Izdeliye 141&quot; (BTR-40), was accepted into service but was regarded as too small to be used in an APC role. Meanwhile, specifications for another APC had been issued, capable of seating 15 to 20 additional passengers and armed with a single heavy machine gun. Existing M3 half-tracks and captured German Sd.Kfz. 251s were studied as potential references for the upcoming design.

Concept work on the new APC began at the Zavod imeni Stalina (ZIS) factory in Moscow, overseen by Soviet engineer Boris Mikhailovich Fitterman, at roughly the same time the &quot;Izdeliye 141&quot; was being developed by GAZ. Prototypes were built with automotive components from the ZIS-151 production line; however, the APC chassis incorporated a more powerful engine and a shorter wheelbase than its utility truck counterpart. Design work was carried out by a team of five ZIS employees: Fitterman, K. M. Androsov, A. P. Petrenko, V. F. Rodionov and P. P. Chernyaev. The final prototype was trialed by the Soviet Armed Forces in December 1949 and accepted into service as the &quot;BTR-152&quot;. Serial production of the BTR-152 under the manufacturer&#x27;s code &quot;ZIS-152&quot; commenced around mid 1950, making it the first mass-produced Soviet APC. Despite being designed around the same time, the BTR-40 did not enter serial production until the end of the year.

The BTR-152 was used by the Soviet military as a command and communications vehicle, fire support vehicle, artillery tractor, and general transporter. Being open-topped, the BTR-152&#x27;s crew was vulnerable to indirect fire. In later years, the vehicle was not ideal for the prospect of a major conventional war in Europe either, as it lacked amphibious capability or NBC countermeasures. However, these early BTRs remained effective as a low-cost option that allowed the Soviets to rapidly motorize their existing infantry divisions. A program in the late 1950s looked at ways to replace the BTR-152 with a more sophisticated APC utilizing a purpose-designed, amphibious chassis. As the BTR-152&#x27;s six-wheeled configuration was deemed insufficient to reduce ground pressure on the tires and produce optimal cross-country performance, Soviet engineers embarked on an eight-wheeled APC program, which resulted in the BTR-60.

Approximately 8,600 BTR-152s of all variants were manufactured in the Soviet Union, with some unlicensed copies being produced in the People&#x27;s Republic of China as the &quot;Type 56&quot;. Soviet BTR-152s were produced between 1950 and 1959, being supplemented by the BTR-60 from 1960 onwards. As they became increasingly obsolescent, many were shipped to Soviet client states in Africa and the Middle East; the largest quantity of second-hand BTR-152s were accepted by Arab nations such as Libya, Iraq, Syria, and Egypt. Small quantities were also converted to armored ambulances and combat engineering vehicles for the Soviet Army; these remained in service as late as the 1980s.

===Service===

BTR-152s first saw combat during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, when they were deployed by the 12th Motorized Brigade of the Soviet Internal Troops to crush Hungary&#x27;s fledgling uprising. The BTRs were deployed in Budapest and other settlements, as well as on the Hungarian border with Austria. A number were damaged or destroyed by insurgents armed with molotov cocktails, which were pitched into the open troop compartments without apparent difficulty. Since they were wheeled, some BTR-152s were also immobilized when their rubber tires caught fire, and had to be abandoned by their crews.

Egypt was one of the first major export customers for the BTR-152 outside Eastern Europe; in 1954, it ordered 200 from the Soviet Union, and between 1961 and 1966 it received another 600 in second-hand condition, possibly as military aid. Syria likewise received at least 200 BTR-152s in 1966, and another 300 three years later. These were deployed against the Israel Defense Forces during the Six-Day War. In Syrian service, they were utilized as makeshift infantry fighting vehicles rather than APCs; infantrymen remained on board and used the BTR-152 as a firing platform rather than disembark and fight on foot. Nevertheless, failure to coordinate combined arms maneuvers often left the Syrian motorized infantry separated from their supporting tank formations and vulnerable to Israeli heavy armor. Israel captured over 1,000 BTR-152s from Arab armies during the Six-Day War and the subsequent Yom Kippur War.

BTR-152s were deployed by the National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) during the First Chadian Civil War, and were instrumental in a motorized assault on Salal in April 1978. The BTRs were knocked out by Panhard AML-90 armored cars of the French Foreign Legion. Libyan mechanized battalions also deployed BTR-152s in Chad during the Chadian-Libyan conflict, often in concert with tank companies or EE-9 Cascavels. Several were destroyed after taking direct hits from AML-90 cannon fire or SS.11 anti-tank missiles.

BTR-152s formed the mainstay of mechanized units on both sides during the Ogaden War. The Somali National Army ordered enough BTR-152s from the Soviet Union in the late 1960s to equip nine new mechanized battalions. About half of Somalia&#x27;s BTR-152s appear to have been lost in the Ogaden conflict. Soviet weapons deliveries to Ethiopia accelerated after the outbreak of war, and starting in March 1977 included 40 BTR-152s appropriated from the Soviet Army&#x27;s reserve stocks. These vehicles were mostly BTR-152Vs but also included the BTR-152A anti-aircraft variant.

The Soviet Union donated at least six BTR-152s to Mozambique shortly after that country&#x27;s independence in the mid-1970s. Mozambican BTR-152s were deployed against Rhodesian Security Forces conducting cross-border raids, as well as in search and destroy operations mounted near Mozambican National Resistance (RENAMO) strongholds. It is likely that all Mozambique&#x27;s BTR-152s were eliminated by land mines or Rhodesian air strikes; they were not in service long before being superseded by the BTR-60. A second shipment of BTR-152s was delivered to the People&#x27;s Forces of Liberation of Mozambique (FPLM) in 1983, but it remains unclear whether these were deployed in front-line service.

During the Lebanese Civil War, both Lebanese militias and Syrian Army used BTR-152s.

==Description==

The BTR-152 is a modified truck chassis with an armored hull and an open-topped troop compartment. The sides and rear of the troop compartment are vertical, with corners sloping inwards to deflect shell fragments. There are firing ports on each side of the troop compartment and two rear doors for rapid debarking. Infantrymen can fire their individual weapons from the relative protection of the vehicle, and exit through these doors or by jumping over the sides. The crew consists of a driver and a single passenger, who operates the radios.

Two types of seating arrangements were available: the first consists of wooden benches on either side of the troop compartment facing inwards; the second consisted of three rows of seats facing forward. Both the driver and the radio operator seated to his right are provided with individual windscreens and, when in combat, these are covered by twin armored shutters with integral vision blocks. Crew members exit the vehicle through side doors, the tops of which are hinged and fold down for observation purposes.

The BTR-152&#x27;s armor plate is fabricated of welded steel and ranges from to in thickness. This protects the crew and passengers from small arms fire, shell fragments, grenades, and anti-personnel mines, but is ineffective against larger shell fragments or even heavy machine gun fire. Late production hulls may have been manufactured from steel plate with a thickness of up to . The vehicle is sometimes fitted with a winch that has a maximum capacity of 5 tonnes and a 70m cable. Depending on the variant, BTR-152s can tow field artillery, transport 1.9 tonnes of cargo, or carry a half platoon of infantry.

Most Soviet BTR-152s were powered by a six-cylinder ZIL-123 in-line water-cooled petrol engine developing 110 hp at 2,900 rpm. Those based on the chassis and components of the ZIL-157 utility truck utilized a slightly different ZIL-137K engine. There are several engine louvers on the front of the hull to prevent overheating; these could be safely closed for short intervals during combat, as long as the driver reduced speed and avoided overtaxing the vehicle. A BTR-152&#x27;s gearbox comprised five forward gears and one reverse gear with a two-speed transfer box. Fifth gear had an overdrive. The suspension consisted of conventional leaf springs with hydraulic shock absorbers.

In the late 1950s, a little over 200 BTR-152s were produced with enclosed hulls, as opposed to the traditionally open-topped design; these were designated &quot;BTR-152K&quot; and &quot;BTR-152K1&quot;. They were also known unofficially as &quot;BTR-152 Model D&quot; or &quot;BTR-152 M1961&quot; by some Warsaw Pact armies. The enclosed hull reduced situational awareness but allowed for the installation of central heating and an NBC overpressure system. Two hatches opening to the right were installed on the new roofline.
The BTR-152 was originally armed with a single pintle-mounted 7.62mm SG-43 Goryunov (SGMB) medium machine gun, fed by 1,250 rounds of stored on-board ammunition. This was mounted behind the driving position. Additional 7.62mm general-purpose machine guns could be mounted on either side of the hull top as needed. The SGMB machine gun could traverse 45 degrees and elevate between -6 and +24 degrees. Some of the BTRs were fitted with single 12.7mm DShK or 14.5mm KPV heavy machine guns in place of the SGMB. Vehicles designated &quot;BTR-152A&quot; were ground support vehicles with limited air defense capability. BTR-152As carried twin KPVs in a ZPU-2 anti-aircraft mount. Variations included an Egyptian model with a Czechoslovak M53 Quad mounting for four DShKs, which were normally towed on a two-wheeled trailer, and some modified by the Palestine Liberation Organization to accept 23mm ZU-23-2 anti-aircraft guns.

Because the original BTR-152 utilized the chassis and engine of the ZIS-151, it shared that truck&#x27;s maintenance problems and poor cross-country mobility. Later variants, using ZIL-157 components, had more power and larger, single tires that reduced the vehicle&#x27;s shortcomings but did not eliminate them. Serviceability and reliability remained low.

<text>Revillagigedo Island (, , , locally Revilla, ) is an island in the Alexander Archipelago in Ketchikan Gateway Borough of the southeastern region of the U.S. state of Alaska. Running about 89 km (50 mi) north-south and 48 km (35 mi) east-west, it is 2,754.835 km2 (1,063,648 mi2) in area, making it the 12th largest island in the United States and the 170th largest island in the world. Its center is located near .

The island is separated from the Alaska mainland to the east by Behm Canal, from Prince of Wales Island to the west by the Clarence Strait, and from Annette Island to the south by Revillagigedo Channel and Nichols Passage. The island is traditional Tlingit territory, and by the nineteenth century was divided between the Saanyaa Ḵwáan and Taantʼa Ḵwáan tribes or subdivisions. The first European recorded as having sighted it was Spanish explorer Jacinto Caamaño in 1792; it was named the following year by British naval officer George Vancouver for Juan Vicente de Güemes, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo, then viceroy of New Spain (Mexico).

The island&#x27;s population was 13,950 as of the 2000 census. The only cities on the island are Ketchikan and Saxman, although the unincorporated community of Ward Cove and the historical community of Loring are also on the island. The principal industries are fishing, canning, logging and tourism. In addition to the cities, several logging communities are based on barges, which move about the waterways. These serve the unconnected system of logging roads that dot the island and have access to waterfront.

<doc id="924375" wikidata="Q4735011" url="?curid=924375" title="Alpha Chi Sigma">
<text>Alpha Chi Sigma () is a professional fraternity specializing in the fields of the chemical sciences. It has both collegiate and professional chapters throughout the United States consisting of both men and women and numbering more than 78,000 members. The fraternity aims to bring together students and professionals pursuing a wide variety of chemistry-related careers.

== History ==

=== Founding ===
The Alpha Chi Sigma fraternity was organized at the University of Wisconsin–Madison by a group of undergraduates who were fellow students in chemistry at that time. Later documents set the date of founding as December 11, 1902. The founders were:
* Raymond Tracy Conger
* Harold Everett Eggers
* Joseph Gerard Holty
* Alfred Emil Kundert
* Joseph Howard Mathews
* Edward Gustav Mattke
* Bart Eldred McCormick
* Frank Joseph Petura
* James Chisholm Silverthorn

== Purpose ==
The Three Objects of Alpha Chi Sigma:

# To bind its members with a tie of true and lasting friendship.
# To strive for the advancement of chemistry both as a science and as a profession.
# To aid its members by every honorable means in the attainment of their ambitions as chemists throughout their mortal lives.

The Five Obligations of a Member:

# That a member will remember the Objects of the Fraternity and endeavor always to further them.
# That a member will pay promptly all financial obligations.
# That a member will act so as never to be a reproach to Alpha Chi Sigma.
# That a member will cheerfully fulfill any assigned fraternal tasks.
# That a member will maintain as satisfactory a scholastic record as possible.

== Symbols ==
The fraternity&#x27;s colors are Prussian blue and chrome yellow. The colors were selected because of their history as chemical compounds. Prussian blue consists of iron (III) ferrocyanide and was first created in 1704 by Heinrich Diesbach. Chrome yellow was discovered by Nicolas-Louis Vauquelin in 1797 in the mineral croncoite and consists of lead chromate. The fraternity&#x27;s flower is the red carnation and its symbolic mascot is the Wyvern.

The fraternity&#x27;s badge is hexagon-shaped, symbolizing the basic structural symbol for aromatic compounds. It features the Greek letters &#x27;, with shaking hands below and a skull and cross bones and two stars above. There is also a hexagon-shaped pledge pin with the symbol for lead (see the table below). Its professional charm is a slightly larger version of the badge. There is also a recognition pin for professional members that consists of a monogram of the Greek letters &#x27;.

Its coat of arms includes a shield with a Prussian blue background that is bisected by a diagonal chrome yellow bar that features the symbols of the seven metals of the Ancients. Above the bar are three stars arranged in a triangle. Below the bar is a Wyvern, a mythical creature. There is a motto ribbon below the shield in chrome yellow, with the fraternity&#x27;s name in Prussian blue. There is a lambrequin or mantling drapped on either side of the shield. Above the shield is a torse with six knots in the fraternity colors and the crest which is an alchemical symbol.

The seven metals of the Ancients are gold, silver, iron, mercury, tin, copper, and lead. These symbols correspond to planets, gods, and days of the week.
Member John Baer designed the Alpha Chi Sigma flag in 1946. It has a field of Prussian blue and symbols in chrome yellow, including three stars that are arranged in a triangle in the upper left-hand corner, a central hexagon with letters , and the Greek letters for the individual chapter in the lower right corner. The flag for the Grand Chapter features the ancient symbol for gold in the lower right corner.

The fraternity also has a tartan that was designed by R. Scott Wilson. The tartan includes a dark blue background and red, white, and yellow lines. The yellow lines are groups in threes to represent the Three Objects of the fraternity and in sixes to represent the six sides of the hexagon. The red represents the fraternity&#x27;s flower. The combination of red and white recalls the school colors of the &quot;Alpha chapter&quot; at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. In addition, there is a grouping of two white lines to represent 1902, the founding year of the fraternity.

== Chapters ==
=== Collegiate chapters ===
=== Professional chapters and groups ===
In any geographic area, five or more Alpha Chi Sigma professionals may petition the Grand Recorder to establish themselves as a professional group. After the guidelines set up in the bylaws are fulfilled, the group can petition the Supreme Council to grant it chapter status. Each chapter draws its name from the city or area in which it exists.

<doc id="924406" wikidata="Q360813" url="?curid=924406" title="Alexander Agricola">
<text>Alexander Agricola (; born Alexander Ackerman; – 15 August 1506) was a Netherlandish composer of the Renaissance writing in the Franco-Flemish style. A prominent member of the &quot;Grande chapelle&quot;, the Habsburg musical establishment, he was a renowned composer in the years around 1500, and his music was widely distributed throughout Europe. He composed music in all of the important sacred and secular styles of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wegman/Fitch, Grove online&quot;&gt;Wegman/Fitch, Grove online&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Agricola was the son, born out of wedlock, of Lijsbette Naps, a wealthy female merchant who lived in Ghent. He was probably born sometime in the late 1450s and had a brother named Jan. A commemorative motet first published in 1538 gave his age as 60 at the time of his death in 1506, but that may be due to a medieval convention concerning the number 60. He may have received his musical training from the parish church of St Nicolas in Ghent, as his mother made a substantial donation to its musical establishment in 1467. In 1476 he is known to have been in Cambrai, in the Low Countries, where he was employed as a &quot;petit vicaire&quot; or singer from February to May.

Most of his life he spent in posts in Italy, France and the Low Countries, though there are gaps where his activities are not known, and he seems to have left many of his posts without permission. Agricola was previously identified as the Alessandro d&#x27;Alemagna who served as a singer for Duke Galeazzo Maria Sforza of Milan from 1471 to 1474, during the period when the Milanese chapel choir grew into one of the largest and most famous ensembles in Europe; Loyset Compère, Johannes Martini, Gaspar van Weerbeke, and several other composer-singers were also in Milan during those years. In 1474 Duke Galeazzo Maria wrote a letter of recommendation for a certain &quot;Alexander de Alamania&quot; to Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici. That identification has since been questioned because the Milanese documents do not record the surname of this Alessandro d&#x27;Alemagna, and Agricola is from Flanders, not Germany. The earliest unambiguous references to Agricola remain the documents at Cambrai.

For the long period from 1476 to 1491 nothing definite is known except that he spent part of the time in the French royal chapel, and he must have been building his reputation as a composer during this time, for he was much in demand in the 1490s, with France and Naples competing for his services. Between 1 October 1491 and 1 June 1492 Agricola served as part of the cathedral chapel in Florence. In April 1492 Charles VIII of France wrote a letter to Pietro de Medici asking for the return of Agricola, which implies that he had been serving in the French royal chapel for an unknown duration beforehand. Agricola was briefly in Naples in June 1492, although King Ferrante had to relinquish him at the request of Charles VIII. Ferrante tried to reacquire Agricola from Charles VIII during 1493, at one point offering him a salary of 300 ducats a year. However Ferrante&#x27;s enthusiasm cooled during the rest of 1493 as the situation in Italy deteriorated (war broke out in the next year) and he told Agricola to not come to Naples. Despite this, Agricola seemed to have returned to Naples (now ruled by Ferrante&#x27;s son Alfonso) in 1494, staying for some time between February and March.

After this the paper trail for Agricola runs cold until the spring of 1500, when he took a position with Philip the Handsome, who was Duke of Burgundy and became King of Castile upon the death of his mother-in-law in 1504. Agricola accompanied Philip on his travels through his extensive lands, which included two trips to Spain in 1501 and 1506, passing through France during the first trip and England in the second. He served alongside fellow composer Pierre de la Rue, and was paid the same salary; he also received benefices in Gorinchem and Valenciennes Other composers present in Philip&#x27;s chapel during this time includes Marbrianus de Orto and Antonius Divitis. By this time Agricola was one of the most esteemed composers in Europe. Petrucci brought out a collection of his masses in 1504, an honour accorded to few composers before him. His motet &quot;Si dedero&quot; survives in over thirty sources and both Jacob Obrecht and Divitis wrote masses based on it. Josquin paid homage to Agricola in his &quot;Missa Faisant regretz&quot; by borrowing the ostinato idea first used in his four voice &quot;Tout a par moy&quot;, which is in turn based on Frye&#x27;s chanson. Works by Agricola, La Rue and Josquin make up the bulk of the choir book B–Br MS 9126, which was prepared just before Philip&#x27;s second trip to Spain.

Agricola was still receiving his salary up until 22 July 1506, when the court was in Valladolid. However, his name is not included in the chapel payments in October which was authorised shortly after Philip&#x27;s death. Agricola&#x27;s own death on 15 August 1506 is confirmed by an epitaph found in a 16th-century manuscript in Brussels, it reads: &quot;Epitaph. Here lies one whom death ensnared: a Ghenter, formerly called Master Alexander Agricola, well spoken of in music. Death dispatched him on 15 August 1506: God grant that he be comforted and seated among the righteous. Amen.&quot;

== Musical style ==
=== Related schools and composers ===

Agricola is one of the few transitional figures between the Burgundian School and the style of the Josquin generation of Netherlanders who actually wrote music in both styles.

Agricola&#x27;s style is related to that of Johannes Ockeghem, especially early in his career, and towards the end of his life he was writing using the pervasive imitation characteristic of Josquin des Prez. While few of his works can be dated precisely, he does use many of the non-imitative, complex, rhythmically diverse contrapuntal procedures more often associated with Ockeghem. Unlike Ockeghem, however, he was willing to employ repetition, sequence, and florid imitation in the manner of the other composers who were working around 1500 when the technique became widespread.

=== Genres ===

Agricola wrote masses, motets, motet-chansons, secular songs in the prevailing &quot;formes fixes&quot; such as rondeaux and bergerettes, other chansons, and instrumental music. Much of his instrumental music was based on secular music by Gilles Binchois or Ockeghem. Many of these pieces had become quite popular in the late 15th century.

=== Compositional hallmarks ===

Above all the variants in his general musical style over his working life, Agricola himself wrote in a highly distinctive style, taking the mysteriously sinuous lines of Ockeghem as his point of departure. His music is often very busy and highly detailed, with repeated sequence, repetition of terse rhythmic and motivic units, and a desire to usurp the underlying pulse, sometimes seeming to border on the perverse, either by prolonging cadential figures to cadence on the &quot;wrong&quot; beat, or by shifting the metrical beat of some parts against others. As an example, the closing Agnus Dei of his unusually extended &quot;Missa &#x27;In myne zin&quot;&#x27; features the cantus firmus stated in equal notes of eleven minims duration each in first statement, followed by a statement of five minims duration each, or in the second Salve Regina setting, offsetting part of the statement of the cantus firmus by a quaver for its entire duration, in both cases with the other voices proceeding in a more strict quadruple meter above.

Other &quot;games&quot; played in the music include posing puzzles of mode and &quot;musica ficta&quot; for the performers (e.g. the Kyrie of the &quot;Missa Le serviteur&quot; plays with the expectations of the very well known plainchant cantus firmus by setting up some knotty issues of the implied possibility of modal inflection with consistent extra flats.) The music is characteristically athletic in all voice parts, with the lower parts in particular featuring much that requires very fine singers, and not representing the normal simply harmonic function of the tenor-bass combinations used by most of his contemporaries. Often a highly elaborate set of quick motifs will spring unexpected from a previous slow-moving texture (e.g. the eruption of detailed duos beginning at &quot;Glorificamus te&quot; and climaxing at &quot;Adoramus te&quot; in the &quot;Gloria&quot; of the &quot;Missa in myne zin&quot;).

His music was very highly regarded in its day, the very distinctive style leading to one contemporary commentator referring to it as &quot;crazy&quot;, and another as &quot;sublime&quot;.

== Other Agricolas ==

<text>Alexander Johnston Cassatt (December 8, 1839 – December 28, 1906) was the seventh president of the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), serving from June 9, 1899, to December 28, 1906.

==Family and early life==
Alexander Cassatt was born on December 8, 1839, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He was the eldest of seven children born to Robert Simpson Cassat (later Cassatt), and his wife Katherine Cassatt, the former Katherine Kelso Johnston. The elder Cassatt was a successful stockbroker and land speculator who was descended from the French Huguenot Jacques Cossart, who came to New Amsterdam in 1662. The Cassatts had seven children, two of whom died in infancy; Alexander&#x27;s younger sister was the impressionist painter Mary Cassatt. Their mother, Katherine, came from a banking family. She was educated and very well read. It was said that of the seven Cassatt children, Alexander most resembled his mother in &quot;appearance and temperament&quot;.

In 1856, Alexander Cassatt entered Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to study civil engineering. His senior thesis was entitled &quot;Review of Pressure Turbine&quot;. After graduating in the summer of 1859, his father took him to see James Buchanan, the 15th president of the United States, who was a former neighbor of the family.

By the fall of 1860, Cassatt had secured a position as a surveyor or rodman with the Georgia Railroad. By the time the State of Georgia voted to secede from the Union in January 1861, Cassatt had abandoned his work as surveyor on the Dalton-Knoxville line of the Georgia Railroad and returned to Pennsylvania without seeing any military service during the American Civil War.

==Career==
===Pennsylvania Railroad===
Alexander J. Cassatt (usually styled A. J. Cassatt) joined the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) in 1861 as an engineer and rapidly rose through the ranks. He was a vice president in 1877 when the Pittsburgh Railway riots broke out, and had become PRR&#x27;s first vice-president by 1880. He was disappointed to be passed over for the presidency and resigned from the company in 1882.

During his absence he devoted his time to horse breeding but still was able to organize the New York, Philadelphia and Norfolk Railroad (NYP&amp;N), a new line that connected southern markets with the north. Despite no longer being an executive with PRR, he was elected to the PRR&#x27;s board of directors and was recalled in 1899 to serve as president.
Cassatt more than doubled the PRR&#x27;s total assets during his term, from $276 million to $594 million, while track and equipment investment increased by almost 150 percent. The route from New York through Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Altoona to Pittsburgh was made double-tracked throughout; the route to Washington, D.C. made four-tracked (it was known as &quot;Pennsy&#x27;s Broad Way&quot;). Many other lines were double-tracked; almost every part of the system was improved. New freight cutoffs avoided stations; grade crossings were eliminated; flyovers were built to streamline common paths through junctions; terminals were redesigned, and much more. Cassatt initiated the PRR&#x27;s program of electrification which led to the road being the United States&#x27; most electrified system.

However the PPR&#x27;s great accomplishment under Cassatt&#x27;s stewardship was the planning and construction of the long awaited tunnels under the Hudson River that brought PRR&#x27;s trunk line into New York City. His purchase of a controlling interest in the Long Island Rail Road and the construction of tunnels under the East River facilitated the creation of a PRR commuter network on Long Island. 

Cassatt died in 1906, several years before his grand Pennsylvania Station in New York City was completed. He was succeeded as PRR&#x27;s
president by James McCrea.

===Civil engineer===
In the spring of 1861, Cassatt had been hired as part of the Engineer Corps of the Pennsylvania Railroad, again as a rodman where he worked on the Connecting Railway.

It is unknown how Cassatt managed to avoid the Pennsylvania militia draft during the Union mobilization in this period but in 1864, Cassatt was transferred to Renovo, Pennsylvania, as a resident engineer to work on the middle division of the Philadelphia and Erie railroad. In 1866, Cassatt became superintendent of motive power and machinery for the Oil Creek and Allegheny River Railway, recently reorganized in 1864 as the Warren and Franklin Railroad which was growing rapidly due to the discovery of oil in the region and coal mining.

In 1867, Cassatt was appointed as superintendent of motive power and machinery for the Pennsylvania railroad in Altoona with a salary of $3,000 per year ($=) when a trainman made less than $10 a week ($=).

Sometime during Cassatt&#x27;s tenure as superintendent, he married Lois Buchanan, daughter of the Rev. Edward Y. Buchanan and Ann Eliza Foster. Lois Buchanan was a niece of James Buchanan, 15th President of the United States, and through her mother, a niece of songwriter Stephen Foster. The couple had two sons and two daughters.

In 1872, Cassatt was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society.

===Chesterbrook Farm===

Cassatt was a horse enthusiast and fox hunter who owned Chesterbrook Farm, outside Berwyn, Pennsylvania, where he bred Thoroughbred racehorses. The property is today the site of a subdivision with office buildings and homes using the Chesterbrook Farm name. The original main barn designed by Philadelphia architect Frank Furness has been maintained and restored. (Furness also designed Cassatt&#x27;s Rittenhouse Square townhouse.)

Cassatt initially raced under the pseudonym, Mr. Kelso, and his horses as from the Kelso Stable. He owned the 1886 Preakness Stakes winner, The Bard, and the 1889 Belmont Stakes 1889 winner, Eric. As well, he bred the winner of the 1875, 1876, 1878, and 1880 Preakness Stakes and Foxford, who won the 1891 Belmont.

In addition to flat-racing his Thoroughbreds, in 1895 Cassatt helped found the National Steeplechase Association to organize competitive steeplechase racing. He was also responsible for the introduction of the Hackney pony to the United States. In 1878 he acquired 239 Stella in Britain and brought her to Philadelphia. In 1891, Cassatt and several fellow Hackney enthusiasts founded the American Hackney Horse Society. The organization and registry continues to this day, with its headquarters now in Lexington, Kentucky.

==Death and interment==
Cassatt had been feeling unwell since early August 1906, while he was vacationing with his family in Bar Harbor, Maine. There, he had contracted whooping cough from his two grandchildren, Cassatt and Catherine Stewart. His condition became serious, and specialists were called to examine him. He seemed to have recovered by the middle of September.

Cassatt&#x27;s physician, Dr. J.H. Musser, had diagnosed him with Adams-Stokes syndrome, a form of temporary hypoxia, and from early December onwards, he was attended regularly by a nurse. His family and friends were often worried about his health, but Cassatt protested that he would soon recover. On Christmas Eve, Cassatt went for a drive and returned insisting that he felt much refreshed, though Musser had his doubts.

On the morning of December 28, a Friday, Cassatt did not feel well and decided to return to bed, though he did not complain to his wife and daughter, who were with him, of any particular pain. He was supposedly cheerful and decided to forgo his usual business meetings with other officials of the Pennsylvania Railroad, who had been coming to his residence on Rittenhouse Square regularly to meet him for much of December, so they did not seem alarmed. His grandchildren visited him before scampering away to the playroom in the Cassatt townhouse. A short time later Cassatt fell asleep, and it was only a short time later that Cassatt&#x27;s wife noticed he looked very pallid, and summoned the nurse, whose examination quickly determined he was dead. Dr. Musser was summoned, but he also determined that no medical aid would be useful.

Despite the medical explanations for Cassatt&#x27;s passing, many of his business colleagues in the railroad and financial industries immediately asserted that he had died &quot;of a broken heart due to the sensational revelations of grafting by officials of the Pennsylvania [Railroad] system&quot; that had come to light during recent investigations into the coal industry by the Interstate Commerce Commission.

A servant called both Musser and Cassatt&#x27;s assistant William A. Patton to inform them of his death. The news was then relayed to the employees of the Pennsylvania Station at Broad Street Station in Philadelphia and from there telegraphed throughout the United States. 

He was interred in the Church of the Redeemer Cemetery in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. His widow died in 1920.

== Legacy ==


Gramercy Mansion in Baltimore, Maryland, was built by Alexander Cassatt in 1902.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that Cassatt was, relative to other railroad magnates, not an extraordinarily wealthy man, citing officials at the Pennsylvania Railroad who stated at his death that he was worth no more than $5 million (though this would at least be equivalent to $173.9 million in 2022). Evidently, Cassatt built most of his fortune between 1882 and 1899, when he was no longer employed by the Pennsy, as he had invested in stock of railroad supply manufacturers such as the Union Switch and Signal Company and the United States Metallic Packing Company, the Pennsylvania Steel Company, and the Cambria Steel Company. 

In 1910, the Pennsylvania Railroad erected a statue of Cassatt, by Adolph Alexander Weinman, in a niche at New York City&#x27;s new Pennsylvania Station. An inscription below the niche read:

The statue is currently located at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania in Strasburg, Pennsylvania.

<text>Hump-winged grigs are insects belonging to the genus Cyphoderris, in the family Prophalangopsidae, and superfamily Grylloidea (crickets). In modern times they are known only in northwestern North America and central Asia, but the fossil record indicates a wider distribution in the past.

There are three species in North America:
*&quot;Cyphoderris buckelli&quot; - Buckell&#x27;s grig
*&quot;Cyphoderris monstrosa&quot; - Great grig
*&quot;Cyphoderris strepitans&quot; - Sagebrush grig

Hump-winged grigs are known for their unique mating habits. Males call at night by sitting on a tree trunk with their head down and emitting a short, high-pitched trill. When a female mounts the male, the male uses two hooks on its back to hold onto the underside of the female&#x27;s abdomen while transferring spermatophore. During copulation, the female eats the male&#x27;s hind wings and drinks the male&#x27;s blood for energy, causing permanent but nonfatal damage to the male. Hungry females are more likely to mate, will mount males sooner, and are less selective when choosing mating partners. &quot;Virgin&quot; males, with no hind wing damage, are generally more successful at mating than non-virgin males.

<text>The family Prophalangopsidae are insects belonging to the order Orthoptera. They are the only extant members of the superfamily Hagloidea. There is only one extant genus in North America, where they are known as grigs, four genera in Asia, and many extinct genera (see below).

The earliest fossils of the family date to the Early Jurassic around 200 million years ago, and the family exhibited great diversity between the Middle Jurassic and the Early Cretaceous, with their fossil record after that time being sparse.

The closest living relatives to the Prophalangopsidae are the family Tettigoniidae (katydids or bush-crickets), but the evolutionary split occurred more than 230 million years ago in the Permian.

The female of the species consumes the wings of the male during mating.

Haglidae is often used as a synonym of the family, but is used to refer to a distinct grouping of extinct hagloids by paleontologists.

==Subfamilies and genera==
The Orthoptera Species File lists the following: Archibald, Gu, and Mathewes (2022) removed the genera †&quot;Albertoilus&quot; and †&quot;Palaeorehnia&quot; from the family, moving them to a revised †Palaeorehniidae which they considered unplaced as to superfamily.

<text>Nardwuar the Human Serviette (born John Andrew Vernon Ruskin, July 5, 1968), or simply Nardwuar, is a Canadian celebrity journalist and musician. He formed the Vancouver-based garage rock band the Evaporators in 1986, for which he serves as lead singer and keyboardist.

Nardwuar got his start in media at the University of British Columbia radio station, CITR 101.9 FM. His show has run from each Friday afternoon since October 1987. The program features a mix of eclectic music, along with interviews and commentary. Nardwuar&#x27;s interviews have frequently been shown on MuchMusic&#x27;s &quot;Going Coastal&quot;, and printed in &quot;Chart&quot;. Although Nardwuar most frequently interviews musicians, he has stated that he may interview any celebrity. He often appears as a guest interviewer on CBC Radio 3, and began his own weekly program on WFMU in 2009, which ran until 2013.

Noted for his excitable and eccentric persona, Nardwuar is known for performing extensive research on his interviewees to surprise and confuse them. A typical Nardwuar interview will begin with &quot;Who are you?&quot;, followed by &quot;From?&quot; if the subject does not volunteer their affiliations. Each interview ends with &quot;Keep on rockin&#x27; in the free world&quot;, and the &quot;doot doola doot doo ...&quot; of &quot;Shave and a Haircut&quot;, to which the interviewee is expected to reply with the final &quot;doot doo!&quot; before the interview is concluded. Nardwuar would also freeze in place, holding the same surprised expression. Interviews also often close with Nardwuar asking the interviewee &quot;Why should people care about [interviewee&#x27;s name]?&quot;. When asked to explain his name, Nardwuar has said it is &quot;a dumb, stupid name like Sting or Sinbad&quot;; that &quot;Human&quot; came from the song &quot;Human Fly&quot; by the Cramps; and that &quot;Serviette&quot; came from the fact that &quot;in the U.S.A. they don&#x27;t have serviettes, they have napkins&quot;.

==Early life==
Nardwuar was born John Ruskin in Vancouver in 1968. He is Jewish. His father, Vernon, was an engineer and his mother Olga Ruskin (née Bruchovsky) was a local journalist, high school history teacher and historian. She published a history of Vancouver historical figure John &quot;Gassy Jack&quot; Deighton. His mother exposed him to local history by bringing him to historical society meetups. In elementary school, Nardwuar won a public speaking competition and was a long-distance runner.

Nardwuar attended Hillside Secondary School in West Vancouver, where he was a member of the student council. Through the student council, he began booking bands for school events and conducted his first interview with Art Bergmann of the Young Canadians. He was accepted into the University of British Columbia (UBC) in 1986, the same year he began using the alias Nardwuar. He began volunteering at the campus radio station, CITR. While studying history at UBC, Nardwuar wrote papers on Vancouver&#x27;s Lions Gate Bridge and the assassination of John F. Kennedy. He graduated in 1990 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history.

==Career==
===Interviews with musicians===

Nardwuar does extensive research on the guests he interviews. For example, during an interview with Pharrell Williams, Nardwuar pulled out a vinyl record featuring the first recorded track Pharrell contributed to, &quot;Rump Shaker&quot;, causing him to pause and say, &quot;This is ... this is ... This is one of the most impressive interviews I&#x27;ve ever experienced in my life. Seriously.&quot; Later in the same interview, Pharrell said, &quot;Your research is second-to-none. Second-to-none.&quot;

During a 2010 interview with rapper Drake and his producer 40, Drake described Nardwuar&#x27;s interview as the &quot;best that I&#x27;ve ever done in my entire life.&quot;

Due to his absurd and eccentric style, he has been attacked verbally, physically threatened, and intimidated by people such as Dave Rowntree and Damon Albarn of Blur, who harassed and eventually assaulted Nardwuar. Sonic Youth, Alice Cooper, Henry Rollins, Travis Barker, Lydia Lunch, Harlan Ellison, Beck, Nas, and others have hung up on him or been verbally combative in interviews. Dave Rowntree apologized to Nardwuar in 2011 for his behavior during a 2003 interview, calling it &quot;one of the things I&#x27;m ashamed of&quot; and classified his actions as &quot;bullying&quot;. Nardwuar accepted the apology via Twitter.

=== Interviews with non-musicians ===
Nardwuar has also been known to be a &quot;guerrilla journalist,&quot; often sneaking into press conferences under the guise of an orthodox reporter to confront political leaders or other non-musical celebrities with surreal or confusing questions. His non-Canadian political targets have included former President of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev, former U.S. President Gerald Ford and former U.S. Vice President Dan Quayle. Nardwuar has also targeted actor Crispin Glover and faith healer Ernest Angley, asking the latter if there was a cure for &quot;the Summertime Blues&quot;, to which Angley angrily replied, &quot;Oh I wish you would shut up, man. You know you&#x27;re not even funny. You&#x27;re lucky God don&#x27;t strike you dead.&quot;

=== Interviews with Canadian politicians ===

In November 1997, he cut off all his hair and was able to sneak into an APEC conference to ask Jean Chrétien if he supported the pepper spraying of protesters outside. Chrétien, apparently unaware of the incident and not knowing what the English terms &quot;mace&quot; and &quot;pepper spray&quot; referred to, responded with a line that has become well-known in Canada: &quot;For me, pepper, I put it on my plate.&quot;

In June 2004, Nardwuar convinced an amused Paul Martin, the then-Prime Minister of Canada, to play a quick game of the Hasbro game &quot;Hip Flip&quot; while he was on the campaign trail. After Martin won the election, Nardwuar commented on the great predictive power of the &quot;Hip Flip,&quot; because neither of the other two candidates had performed the act. On a campaign trip to Vancouver in December 2005, Nardwuar concluded an interview with then New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton—who, in their first encounter, had taken the instructions to the game and said he would practice for their next encounter—with a successful, coordinated, swinging of their hips. The 22nd Prime Minister Stephen Harper is the only major candidate from the 2004 election who has never performed a successful &quot;Hip Flip&quot; with Nardwuar. Nardwuar was escorted out by Harper&#x27;s security while trying to initiate the game. In the 2015 Canadian federal election, the first federal leader to complete the Hip Flip game was Justin Trudeau, who did so on September 10, 2015 after a press conference in Vancouver.

Premier Christy Clark (Liberal), Premier John Horgan (NDP) and Andrew Weaver (Green) all did the Hip Flip during the 2017 British Columbia general election.

During the 2019 Canadian federal election, New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh was the only head of a political party to attempt the Hip Flip.

In the 2021 Canadian federal election campaign, both New Democratic Party leader Jagmeet Singh and Green Party of Canada leader Annamie Paul completed the Hip Flip.

==Legacy==

In January 2013, Brother Ali released a song called &quot;Nardwuar&quot;, to commemorate his interview with Nardwuar; the song features a beat which uses a sample from one of the records that Nardwuar gave Ali as a gift.

At the 2013 South by Southwest Festival, film director Brent Hodge and producer Chris Kelly did a retrospective of Nardwuar&#x27;s career for &quot;Time&quot;. Pharrell Williams playfully turned the tables and interviewed Nardwuar immediately after his own interview, imitating Nardwuar&#x27;s signature style.

September 29, 2019 was declared &quot;Nardwuar Day&quot; in Vancouver by Kennedy Stewart, the Mayor of Vancouver.

In 2019, Nardwuar was inducted into the BC Entertainment Hall of Fame and included in their star walk on Granville Street in Downtown Vancouver.

Lil Uzi Vert sampled their 2018 interview with Nardwuar for their song &quot;Futsal Shuffle 2020&quot;.

Macklemore&#x27;s 2022 song &quot;Maniac&quot; features a cameo appearance from Nardwuar. He is also referred to in the lyrics.

Nardwuar&#x27;s ending catchphrase was sampled by Logic on &quot;Nardwuar&quot;, the 18th track of his 2022 album &quot;Vinyl Days&quot;.

==Health issues==
On July 10, 1999, Nardwuar suffered seizures and temporary paralysis resulting from a cerebral hemorrhage (aborting his planned ambush interview of Courtney Love), but he quickly recovered.

On December 6, 2015, Nardwuar suffered a stroke and was released from hospital six days later. On January 25, 2016, Nardwuar underwent surgical repair of a patent foramen ovale, a hole between two chambers of the heart, which was the likely cause of his stroke.

==Nardwuar&#x27;s hat==
Nardwuar&#x27;s signature hat is a Scottish golf cap with pom pom, with yellow stripes vertically and green, red, and, blue horizontally. In his interview with Eric André, he stated that this was a gift from his late mother. Nardwuar&#x27;s Hat can be seen in most of his videos, which made it part of his identity.

<doc id="924435" wikidata="Q1542857" url="?curid=924435" title="Grand Rapids Griffins">
<text>The Grand Rapids Griffins are a professional ice hockey team based in Grand Rapids, Michigan. They compete in the American Hockey League (AHL), playing their home games at Van Andel Arena. They are the AHL affiliate to the Detroit Red Wings of the National Hockey League, and are the 2013 and 2017 Calder Cup champions.

The franchise began in the now-defunct International Hockey League in 1996 and merged into the AHL in 2001. Three players have since had their numbers retired.

==Franchise history==
===The return of professional hockey to Grand Rapids===
The team is the third International Hockey League (IHL) franchise in Grand Rapids, following the Grand Rapids Rockets of the 1950s and the Grand Rapids Owls of the late 1970s, and owes its existence to the construction of a 10,000-plus capacity arena in the downtown area. Following the project&#x27;s authorization, Amway executives Dave Van Andel and Dan DeVos formed West Michigan Hockey, Inc., in January 1995 with the intent of securing a minor league hockey franchise. The group promptly began discussions with the IHL, American Hockey League (AHL) and East Coast Hockey League (ECHL) to gauge interest in the Grand Rapids market. Also that month, Bruce Saurs, owner of the IHL&#x27;s Peoria Rivermen, visited Grand Rapids to discuss with the group potential relocation of his team. In April, however, the IHL&#x27;s board of directors voted to waive one of its expansion criteria – that the city&#x27;s metropolitan area comprise at least one million people – and grant West Michigan Hockey a franchise for US$7 million. The league ultimately was swayed by the community&#x27;s response, which included over 8,000 season ticket requests, and the new, fully financed arena.

At the announcement of a &quot;name the team&quot; contest in June 1995, DeVos hinted that the group was looking for something &quot;with a face ... with a personality, that we can translate into a mascot of some sort&quot;. &quot;Grand Rapids Griffins&quot; was chosen as the winning entry, and the logo and colors of the hockey club were unveiled in November. The logo was designed by Sean Michael Edwards Design, Inc., a New York firm whose portfolio includes logos for the Florida Panthers and Seattle Mariners. In keeping with the traditional theme desired by the club, navy blue and gold were chosen as the primary colors, along with hunter green, red and silver accents. &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to be trendy in any way&quot;, DeVos said.

In January 1996, Bob McNamara, former IHL goaltender and assistant general manager of the Cleveland Lumberjacks, was appointed general manager of the Griffins. His first move was to hire Dave Allison, who had briefly coached the Ottawa Senators that season, as head coach. Among the first players to join the team were defensemen Todd Nelson and Travis Richards and goaltender Pokey Reddick, all of whom brought National Hockey League (NHL) experience. On the business side, the Griffins secured a deal with WOOD-AM to broadcast all regular season and playoff games in their inaugural season. Rich Kincaide then left his sportscaster position at WJR in Detroit to become the Griffins&#x27; play-by-play announcer and director of communications. The team also signed agreements with WZZM and WWMT to televise a handful of games each. Following lengthy negotiations with the City of Grand Rapids, a DeVos-owned company took over operations of Belknap Ice Arena, which was then renovated for use as the Griffins&#x27; practice facility.

===Independent years (1996–99)===
McNamara filled the Griffins&#x27; 1996–97 inaugural season roster with IHL and AHL veterans (notably Michel Picard, Jeff Nelson and Don McSween) and a handful of prospects. He also signed affiliation agreements with the Muskegon Fury of the Colonial Hockey League (CHL) and the Mississippi Sea Wolves of the ECHL. The Griffins won their inaugural game on the road against the Indianapolis Ice, but lost the home opener to the Orlando Solar Bears six days later. An early-season record of 9–10–2 improved after the addition of Pavol Demitra, who was acquired in a trade with the Las Vegas Thunder in late November, and NHL veteran Danton Cole, who signed with the team after a stint in the German Ice Hockey League (DEL). The Griffins were paced by the top forward line of Picard, Jeff Nelson and Demitra; all three averaged over one point per game during the regular season. Demitra left the Griffins in March 1997 after signing a contract with the St. Louis Blues, and scored over 300 goals in sixteen NHL seasons. He was replaced on the first line by rookie Kevyn Adams, who went on to play in ten NHL seasons. Grand Rapids finished in last place in a strong Northeast Division with a record of 40–30–12; the team&#x27;s opening round playoff series with Orlando ended in a 3–2 loss. Picard was voted a first-team all star by the league&#x27;s coaches after finishing fourth in league scoring with 46 goals and 55 assists in 82 games. The franchise&#x27;s first season was considered a success by the IHL, which held its 1997 All-Star Game in front of a capacity crowd at the 10,834-seat Van Andel Arena. Thirty-nine of forty-one home games were also sellouts, and the Griffins set an IHL record with season ticket sales capped at 7,000.

Before the 1997–98 season, the Griffins selected Glen Metropolit and two other players in the IHL expansion draft – postponed a year due to extended labor negotiations between the league and its players – signed NHL journeymen forwards Mark Greig and Ed Patterson, and re-signed Michel Picard. Most of the previous season&#x27;s defensive core also returned, though Don McSween was traded following Kerry Huffman&#x27;s signing early in the season. Goaltender Pokey Reddick requested and was granted a trade after splitting playing time with Ian Gordon early in the season; Patrick Lalime signed with the team shortly thereafter. By December, the Griffins were contending for first place in the Northeast Division, largely on the strength of their goaltending and the top forward line of Picard, Metropolit and Greig. Picard was recalled by the St. Louis Blues in January for fifteen games; Chris Lindberg signed with the team shortly after Picard&#x27;s recall, but was later suspended by the IHL after bolting to play for Swiss team EV Zug. The Griffins&#x27; record fell to 30–25–7 by March, and disagreements over what changes needed to be made prompted McNamara to fire head coach Dave Allison. McNamara assumed the coaching duties for the final twenty games of the regular season, as well as the playoffs, in which the Griffins were swept in the first round by the Cincinnati Cyclones. Picard, with 28 goals and 41 assists in 58 games, again led the team in scoring, though another recall to the Blues left him unavailable for the playoffs.

In July 1998, Guy Charron was introduced as the Griffins&#x27; new head coach; his previous seventeen years of coaching experience included five years as an assistant coach with the Calgary Flames of the NHL. His new team endured a flurry of roster moves following the departure of Mark Greig, Patrick Lalime and Shane Hnidy, all of whom signed NHL contracts. Kip Miller signed with the Griffins in August but left the team before playing in a regular season game, instead earning an NHL roster spot after his rights were traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins. Key additions who stuck with the team included forward Robert Petrovicky and Darren Rumble. Early-season signees Joe Frederick and Andrei Vasilyev provided an offensive boost, but injuries on the defensive side preceded a franchise-record seven-game losing streak in November, leaving the Griffins with the worst record in the IHL at that point. Among the few bright spots for the team was the play of linemates Metropolit, who scored the franchise&#x27;s first ever natural hat trick that season, and Petrovicky, who was named the IHL&#x27;s Player of the Month for November after scoring five goals and 12 assists in 12 games. Petrovicky signed an NHL contract with the Tampa Bay Lightning in February, and the Griffins made numerous roster moves in the following weeks in an effort to qualify for the playoffs. The team finished with the second worst record in the 1998–99 IHL season, and failed to earn a playoff spot. (The IHL, down to 16 teams that year, had adopted a 12-team playoff format.) Metropolit&#x27;s 81 points led the team and placed him ninth in league scoring; he went on to play in eight NHL seasons.

===Ottawa Senators affiliation and joining the AHL (1999–2002)===
Late in the 1998–99 season, general manager Bob McNamara on numerous occasions discussed an affiliation agreement with Rick Dudley, the first-year general manager of the Ottawa Senators. Dudley considered other franchises, and left the Senators before a deal was in place, but his replacement, Marshall Johnston, ultimately chose Grand Rapids. The two-year agreement called for the assignment of twelve Senators prospects to the Griffins each year. &quot;[T]he most significant reason we&#x27;ve pursued this is because we want to win a championship&quot;, said McNamara. Griffins co-owner Dan DeVos echoed that sentiment: &quot;This decision was not based on a financial analysis. Our intent was to improve our record.&quot;

In June 2001, the IHL ceased operations. The Griffins were among six IHL teams admitted to the American Hockey League (AHL) at that time. Because the AHL did not allow owners to control multiple teams (unlike the IHL), the DeVos family&#x27;s other IHL teams (the Orlando Solar Bears and Kansas City Blades) were forced to fold.

===Detroit Red Wings affiliation (2002–present)===
On January 24, 2002, the Griffins and Detroit Red Wings held a joint press conference at The B.O.B. in downtown Grand Rapids to announce a five-year affiliation agreement (2002–03 to 2006–07). Red Wings general manager Ken Holland and assistant GM Jim Nill were present for the announcement, which was made before an overflow crowd of media and sponsors. Terms of the affiliation called for the Red Wings to supply a minimum of thirteen players to the Griffins each season. The majority of the Griffins&#x27; roster is Detroit prospects and draft picks.

Located in-state only two hours from Detroit, the Grand Rapids Griffins have given the Detroit Red Wings what they had sought after for years—a local AHL affiliate. The previous affiliate, the Adirondack Red Wings, despite its relatively successful run in the AHL, was considered too far away for the preferences of Red Wings management, and back-and-forth player assignments. For this reason, the NHL Red Wings suspended the AHL Red Wings franchise with the intent of moving it to Toledo, Ohio, just a short distance from Detroit. These plans never materialized, so that AHL franchise stayed dormant for years until being sold and reactivated as the San Antonio Rampage. Since 1991–92 (with the exception of the 2000 and 2007–08 and 2008–09), Detroit has had an ECHL affiliate, who have been very successful, in Toledo, named the Storm and later the Walleye that have been able to feed players into Grand Rapids, with some of them making it up to the NHL and even Detroit.

On April 5, 2002, with a 3–2 victory at Chicago, the Griffins won the AHL&#x27;s inaugural Bud Poile Trophy as the 2001–02 West Division champions. On March 9, 2003, thanks to losses by Rochester and Cincinnati, the Griffins won the John Chick Trophy as the 2002–03 Central Division champions. The title marked their second straight as AHL members. On April 14, 2007, the Griffins and Detroit Red Wings announced an agreement in principle to extend their affiliation through the 2011–12 season. On June 4, 2008, nine former Griffins won the Stanley Cup as part of the 2007–08 Detroit Red Wings.

After the 2010–11 season, general manager Bob McNamara, the only hockey operations chief in franchise history, retired. Initially, the Griffins opted to forgo having a general manager, instead relying on the Red Wings for hockey operations support. However, in early 2012, Red Wings assistant general manager Ryan Martin was named general manager of the Griffins as well.

On March 7, 2012, the Griffins and Detroit Red Wings announced a five-year affiliation agreement extension through the 2016–17 season. On June 13, 2013, the Griffins won the Calder Cup for the first time in franchise history, defeating the Syracuse Crunch in six games. On June 16, 2015, Todd Nelson was named head coach of the Griffins. On June 13, 2017, the Griffins won the 2017 Calder Cup, defeating the Syracuse Crunch in six games in a repeat of the 2013 finals. This time they won it on home ice in front of a sell out crowd at Van Andel Arena—the first time that a Grand Rapids-based team had won a title on home ice. Tyler Bertuzzi was named MVP and received the Jack A. Butterfield Trophy. On July 6, 2017, the Griffins and Detroit Red Wings announced a five-year affiliation agreement extension through the 2021–22 season. After three seasons and one Calder Cup, head coach Todd Nelson was hired as an assistant with the Dallas Stars in the NHL and was replaced by assistant Ben Simon for the 2018–19 season. On July 25, 2022, the Griffins and Detroit Red Wings announced another five-year extension of their affiliation agreement through the 2026–27 season. On June 14, 2023, Dan Watson was named head coach of the Griffins.
