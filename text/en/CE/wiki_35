<text>The house system is a traditional feature of schools in the United Kingdom. The practice has since spread to Commonwealth countries. The school is divided into units called &quot;houses&quot; and each student is allocated to one house at the moment of enrollment. Houses may compete with one another at sports and maybe in other ways, thus providing a focus for group loyalty.

Historically, the house system has been associated with public schools in England, especially boarding schools, where a &quot;house&quot; referred to a boarding house at the school. In this case, the housemaster or housemistress in charge of the house is in loco parentis to the pupils who live in it, even though the house normally has a separate &quot;private side&quot; in which he or she can live a family life. Such an arrangement still continues in most boarding schools, while in day schools the word &quot;house&quot; is likely to refer to a grouping of pupils, rather than to a particular building.

Schools have different numbers of houses, with different numbers of students in each, depending on the arrangements adopted by the schools. Facilities, such as pastoral care, may be provided on a house basis.

Houses may be named after saints, famous historical alumni or notable regional topics (e.g. in international schools, houses are sometimes named in honour of local celebrities). Former British royal houses (dynasties) are also used in the UK. Other more arbitrary names—animal names or colours, for example—are also often used. Houses are also often referred to by the original name of the building or by the name or initials of the housemistress or housemaster. Each house will usually also be identified by its own symbol, logo, or colours.

At co-educational boarding schools, there may be separate houses for boys and girls, as at the Lawrenceville School, whose house system is itself based on that of Rugby School. Students may also be grouped by year groups or status as boarders or day students. At Winchester College and Eton College, there is a separate house for foundation scholars. Where the school has boarders and day pupils like the King&#x27;s School, Canterbury or Shrewsbury School, they will often be allocated to separate houses. There have also been cases, for example at Cheltenham College, of pupils being allocated to different houses according to their religion. At traditional full boarding schools such as Radley College and Harrow School, students are grouped by boarding house.

== Pastoral care ==

In some boarding schools, a primary purpose of the house system is to provide pastoral care to the students. Separated from parents for long periods, children will rely on the school to fulfil their socio-emotional needs, in addition to meeting their basic physical care. The smaller within-school structure of the house facilitates this, by promoting personalised care, with more frequent interactions, and lower child-to-adult-carer ratios, than within the wider school. Similar benefits of closer relationships between teachers and students may occur in day schools that use house systems for this purpose.

Peer relationships and fostering of community feeling are a similar aim of school house systems, whether in boarding or day schools. One headmaster of an English-style school – Brighton College Bangkok – David Tongue, writing in an editorial, described the team-spirit engendered by school houses this way: &quot;This camaraderie and solidarity is second to none and the benefits of this vertical interaction, where the young look up to the elder and where the elder look out for and support the younger, are profound.&quot; In Britain, the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust [now SSAT (The Schools Network)], has endorsed use of House systems as one strategy for preventing the deterioration of children&#x27;s educational and social progress, a common feature of transition from primary to secondary school.

== Competition between houses ==
A secondary feature of house systems is the competition between houses. For example, the traditional school sports day is usually an inter-house competition. Debating competitions and charity drives are also often organised along inter-house lines. Merit points for behaviour and academic achievement may also be totalled up for comparison between houses.

Some schools have a year-long programme of inter-house events, in a variety of fields but most often sports or the arts, in which each house &quot;hosts&quot; an event at which all houses compete, with points contributing to the award of the House Cup at the end of the year.

Shrewsbury School and Eton College still maintain an annual bumps race between houses, which was carried on by old boys to Oxford and Cambridge colleges, both of which still race in bumps; Shrewsbury and Eton race in fours, whilst Oxford and Cambridge race in eights. 

St Bartholomew&#x27;s School, one of England&#x27;s oldest state schools, hosts a series of sporting and arts House competitions and recently added a House Film competition.

== Membership and roles ==
Pupils are usually assigned to houses randomly, perhaps with the aim of balancing the houses in order to increase competition. Sometimes the assignment is based on the social and emotional needs of the student and to ensure proper peer mentoring is enhanced with the right fit of students within a house. Traditionally, however, once a pupil has been assigned to a house, any younger siblings may automatically become members of that house when they arrive at the school, but this varies from school to school. (This tradition sometimes extends to the children of former pupils.) Once a pupil has been allocated to a house they usually stay with that house as they move up through the year groups. In some schools, pupils may move to a house for senior pupils in Sixth Form.

One notable feature of the house system is the appointment of &quot;house captains&quot;, and maybe other house prefects, who exercise limited authority within the house and assist in the organisation of the house. Large schools may have a house captain for each year group (with vice-captains in the largest schools).

In boarding schools, the term &quot;housemaster&quot; or &quot;housemistress&quot; is the title held by the member of staff responsible for pupils living in a particular house (or dormitory). In state schools, members of staff are appointed as (or volunteer to become) &quot;head of house&quot;. However, both terms can be used at either style of school for the sake of formality. In some cases, houses may have their own staff members other than housemaster or housemistress.

== Other uses ==
The term &quot;house system&quot; is also used to refer to the residential college systems found in some US colleges and universities, such as Rice University, Caltech, Yale College, Harvard College, Notre Dame, and University of Chicago. These systems are based on the college systems of Oxford and Cambridge Universities in the United Kingdom, which in turn share many similarities with the house systems of British secondary schools.

== Prominence in school stories ==
The first boarding-school story was Sarah Fielding&#x27;s &quot;The Governess, or The Little Female Academy&quot;, published in 1749. The genre did not become popular until 1857, with Thomas Hughes&#x27; novel &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot;. The house system has since featured prominently in thousands of school stories books, with many authors writing a whole series of books such as Chalet School and Malory Towers which have been published around the world and translated into several languages. The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books and films (re)popularized this genre, and resulted in unprecedented awareness of British boarding schools (and their house system) in countries where they were previously largely unknown.

These stories depict the popular conception of a British boarding school rather than how modern boarding schools work in reality, and often focus on the most positive aspects. For example, loyalty to one&#x27;s house is very important in real-life houses, and features prominently in many of these books. The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books have updated the boarding school to 21st-century values, for example by depicting mixed-sex education houses. Most Britons never went to a boarding school, but have integrated their values by reading these books.

The translators of some foreign editions of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books had difficulties conveying the &quot;house&quot; concept in languages like Russian or German, because there was no word that could adequately convey the importance of belonging to a certain house, the loyalty owed to one&#x27;s house, and the pride in the prizes won by one&#x27;s own house. This forces translators to insert extra explanations in the dialogue, making foreign readers think that the house and boarding systems were a special feature of the fantasy setting rather than a real-world feature which would not need to be explained to a typical British child. The French translation does not explain the differences between the French and English real-world boarding schools, instead having the house system and the head girls and boys explained as peculiarities of Hogwarts.

<text>The Yngling is a sailboat that was designed by Norwegian Jan Herman Linge as a one design racer and first built in 1967.

The Yngling design is very similar to the larger 1966 Linge-designed Soling.

==Production==
In the past the design was built by Abbott Boats in Canada, the O&#x27;Day Corp. and Jibetech in the United States as well as Petticrows in the United Kingdom. It remains in production at Børresen Bådebyggeri in Denmark and by Mader Bootswerft in Germany.

==Design==

The Yngling is a racing keelboat, built predominantly of fibreglass, with wood trim. It has a fractional sloop rig with aluminum spars. The hull has a spooned raked stem, a raised counter reverse transom, an internally mounted spade-type rudder controlled by a tiller and a swept fixed fin keel. It displaces and carries of lead ballast.

The boat has a draft of with the standard keel.

The design has a small cuddy cabin for stowage.

For sailing the design is equipped with a spinnaker, an end-boom mainsheet, foam buoyancy and sail windows for visibility.

==Operational history==

The design is supported by a class club, the &quot;International Yngling Association&quot;, with national clubs in Austria, Belgium, Germany, Norway, Switzerland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, the United States and Australia.

The Yngling received ISAF International status in 1979 and was chosen as the Olympic Women&#x27;s Keelboat for the 2004 and the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Yngling was replaced by the Elliott 6m for the London 2012 Summer Olympics.

In a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, &quot;Jan Linge also designed the larger Soling, and the lines are very similar ... The Yngling is highly stable, with a beam-to-waterline ratio of .37 and with 50 percent of the weight in ballast. It is unsinkable, with foam-filled tanks. Sail area is not large, so that the boat may be sailed by younger sailors. While one-design rules are strict, every effort has been made to keep the cost of allowable modifications down.&quot;

<doc id="914361" wikidata="Q3354353" url="?curid=914361" title="Opperdoes">
<text>Opperdoes is a village in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is a part of the municipality of Medemblik, and lies about 12 km north of Hoorn. It has a certain fame for its local variety of potatoes, &quot;Opperdoezer Ronde&quot;.

The village was first mentioned in the late 11th century as Those, and means &quot;bog with moss&quot;. Opper (upper) could have been added to distinguish from Nederdoes, a village lost in the Zuiderzee.

==History==

The exact age of the village of Opperdoes is hard to determine. The village used to be located very close to the sea, and the area has been flooded several times. Initial settlements seem to have been abandoned after the year 300 because of large floods. New villages were later built on terps.

Opperdoes used to be located 4 or 5 kilometres from the sea-dike that existed around 781. However, the dike was in a very bad condition and in 1318 Willem van Henegouwen, the ruler, agreed the build a new dike. In 1334 a new dike was built between Medemblik and Barsingerhorn.

The new dike was built 4 kilometres southwards of the old one and Almersdorp, a village, was left outside the new dike.

In 1517 the old church of Opperdoes and many buildings were destroyed by Grote Pier and his Frisian army, the &quot;Gelderse Friezen&quot;.

A new church was built, and it was ready in 1530. The top of the tower of the church was replaced in 1838, after it was destroyed in a storm in November 1836.

Opperdoes was a separate municipality between 1817 and 1979, when the new municipality of Noorder-Koggenland was created.

==Important buildings and locations==

A touristic attraction is the old steam railway station on the railway between Hoorn and Medemblik.

==Religion==

Religion has played an important part in the village in the last two centuries. Opperdoes is considered an orthodox village in a fairly liberal minded area. In earlier times the villagers of Opperdoes were called &quot;the Turks&quot;: they were a particularly free-minded people, in line with the other villages in the area, that enjoyed life to the fullest.

Around 1822 Jan Mazereeuw, the so-called &quot;Profete of Opperdoes&quot;, preached in the village. He was a farmer and had been mayor of the village for a while during the French occupation. He called the Reformed Church a godless temple and preached a very sober lifestyle. Although he never had a large crowd of followers, it is generally assumed that a part of the village&#x27;s orthodoxy can be explained by his preachings.

==Statistics==
In 2001, the village centre of Opperdoes had 1442 inhabitants. The built-up area of the village was 0.31 km2, and contained 555 residences. The wider statistical area of Opperdoes has a population of around 1750.

<text>Miguel Angel Canto Solis (born January 30, 1948) is a Mexican former world boxing champion who held the WBC and Lineal flyweight titles.

==Boxing life==

Unlike many Mexican boxers, Canto was not a &quot;slam-bang&quot; type of boxer (&quot;Slam-Bang&quot; boxers are boxers whose fights are usually action-packed; Mexican boxers are usually stereotyped as &quot;slam-bangers&quot;). He used boxing techniques and knowledge instead of trying to score knockouts in most of his fights. Proof of this is that he only won fifteen fights by knockout, out of more than seventy professional bouts. He was a defensive expert, somewhat in the style of Willie Pep.

Canto began his professional boxing career on February 5, 1969. He became one of those rare cases in boxing, like Alexis Argüello, Henry Armstrong, Bernard Hopkins, Victor Luvi Callejas and Wilfredo Vazquez, where a boxer loses his first fight and goes on to become a world champion. He lost that day to Raul Hernandez, in Canto&#x27;s hometown of Mérida, by a knockout in round three.

==First win==

His first win came against Pedro Martinez, on May 5, 1969, by a four round decision, also at Mérida. Canto lost his next fight, but a streak of seven undefeated fights (he went 5-0-2, with 2 knockouts during that streak), led him to fight Vicente Pool on May 27, 1970, for the Yucatán state Flyweight title. Canto won his first professional belt when he outpointed Pool over twelve rounds. In his first defense, he retained the crown, with a twelve round decision over Jose Luis Cetina. After losing his next bout, a ten round, non title bout against Tarcisio Gomez, on a decision, he went on to win 21 bouts in a row, including his first bout outside Mérida (a two round knockout of Pedro Martinez in Cansahcab, Mexico), and a win over Constantino Garcia on January 22, 1972, by twelve round decision, to claim the Mexican Flyweight title. On January 31, 1973, he fought to a ten round draw (tie) against perennial contender Ignacio Espinal.

After winning his next four fights, including a rematch victory over Tarcisio Gomez, he was given his first world title try, when he fought Betulio González in Maracaibo, Venezuela, for the WBA world Flyweight title. In what was also his first fight abroad, he was outpointed by the equally legendary Gonzalez, considered by many to be Venezuela&#x27;s greatest fighter of all time, on August 4, 1973.

==WBC World Flyweight Champion Reign==

Canto won six more fights, including two Mexican title defenses, and on January 8, 1975, he faced WBC world Flyweight champion Shoji Oguma in Sendai. Canto defeated Oguma by a fifteen round decision to claim the WBC and vacant lineal flyweight titles. His dream of becoming a world champion finally realized, Canto was a busy champion, mixing several non-title bouts with his title defenses. In his next fight, he beat Espinal in a rematch by a ten round decision. In his first title defense, he avenged his loss to Betulio Gonzalez by a fifteen round decision. On August 23 of that year, he defeated OPBF champion Jiro Takada by 11th round TKO. Following that win, Canto faced Espinal for a third time and retained his title once again by a fifteen round decision. On May 15, 1976, he scored a win over former champion Susumu Hanagata. Canto eventually became a traveling world champion.

For his fifth title defense, he returned to Venezuela and defeated Gonzalez for the second time in their trilogy by a fifteen round decision. One month later, he retained the crown against Orlando Javierto, once again by fifteen round decision, in Los Angeles, California.

On April 24, 1977, he returned to Venezuela for a third time, retaining the title against Reyes Arnal by a fifteen round decision in Caracas. Two months later, he beat Kimio Furesawa by a fifteen round decision in Tokyo. Then, he and Martin Vargas fought the first of their two bouts: on September 17, 1977, Canto outpointed Vargas in his hometown of Mérida.

It was Canto&#x27;s turn to travel to Vargas&#x27; hometown of Santiago, Chile, for their rematch, held on November 30 of the same year. Canto once again retained the titles with a fifteen round decision.

In 1978, Canto retained his title three times, including two rematches with Shoji Oguma, both of them held in Japan, and another fifteen round points win over Facomrom Vibonchai, in a fight held at Houston, Texas.

By this time, Canto&#x27;s name had become a household name all over Latin America, thanks in part to &quot;Ring En Español&quot;, which gave Canto&#x27;s fights much coverage.

On February 10, 1979, he retained his titles for a division record fourteenth time against a future world champion, Antonio Avelar, by a fifteen round decision.

On March 18, his reign came to an end, when he lost a fifteen round decision to Chan Hee Park in South Korea. On September 9 of that same year, he tried to recover his titles from Park in a rematch, but, after fifteen rounds, the fight ended in a draw.

Canto&#x27;s career took a downward spiral after that fight. He won his following three fights, including wins against Olympic Bronze medalist Orlando Maldonado of Puerto Rico and former champion Sung-Jun Kim. In his 70th career fight, he lost to future world champion Gabriel Bernal. Canto avenged his loss to Bernal in his next fight, but lost the remaining three fights of his career by knockout.

After his final loss to Rodolfo Ortega on July 24, 1982, Canto retired from boxing for good. He had a record of 61 wins, 9 losses and 4 draws (ties), with 15 knockout wins.

<text>Bettina Caroline Germaine Rheims (; born 18 December 1952) is a French photographer.

==Career==
=== Early stages ===
Bettina Rheims was born in Neuilly-sur-Seine. Her photographic career began in 1978, when she took a series of photos of a group of strip-tease artists and acrobats, which would lead to her first exhibitions. This work would unveil Bettina Rheims&#x27; favourite subject, the female model, to which she would frequently return during her career. The 1980s provided Bettina Rheims with the opportunity to take several portraits of both famous and unknown women, resulting in the publication of &quot;Female Trouble&quot; (1989).

In 1982, the &quot;Animal &quot;series enabled Rheims&#x27; to train her lens on another form of nudity: that of stuffed animals with fixed stares, &quot;which seemed to want to express something beyond death&quot;. &quot;I had to capture their gaze&quot; declared the photographer.

With &quot;Modern Lovers&quot; (1989-1990) [note] the photographer questioned gender, androgyny and transsexuality. Two other publications on the same subject followed: &quot;Les Espionne&quot;s (1992) and &quot;Kim&quot; (1994).

=== The 1990s ===
At the beginning of the 1990s, Bettina Rheims worked on one of her major series, entitled&quot; Chambre Close&quot; (1990-1992). This was her first in colour and marked the start of her collaboration with the novelist Serge Bramly, in a work which saw her photographs coupled with the writer&#x27;s fiction. In its form, &quot;Chambre Close&quot; is a parody of the first pornographic photos — rooms with faded walls, old fashioned wallpaper — yet, in its substance, it endeavours to stage amateur models in poses playing on the eroticism and the confusion between those who are looking and those who are showing themselves.

&quot;By using colour and extreme quality printings, the flesh appears living and gives a disconcerting realism to the work. Bettina Rheims thus transcends the body to reach primitive femininity in her psychoanalytical &quot;id&quot; - her more or less pent-up impulses, sexual impulses in particular. At the same time as these impulses show through the surface, the awareness of the model, through her skin, the artist captures them on film.&quot;

In 1995, Rheims was invited by Jacques Chirac at the end of his presidential campaign to work behind the scenes on a series of photographs following the final stages of the election. After the election, the Presidency of the French Republic commissioned Bettina Rheims to take the official portrait of Jacques Chirac. She told the newspaper Libération that she had wanted to give the President &quot;the relaxed look of the great heroes in westerns&quot;.

She was featured in Maya Gallus&#x27;s 1997 documentary film &quot;&quot;.

The decade drew to a close with the 1999 publication of the book &quot;I.N.R.I&quot;. and its eponymous exhibition. Once again uniting the gaze of Rheims with the prose of Serge Bramly, &quot;I.N.R.I. &quot;builds a philosophical dialogue on the history of the crucifixion through photographs of scenes of the life of Christ, from the Annunciation to the Ascension. Bettina Rheims proposed &quot;illustrations in step with our times, after the appearance of photography, cinema and advertising imagery, as if Jesus were returning today.&quot; [note]. In France, the publication of this work was highly controversial.

=== The 2000s ===
In 2002, Rheims created a series on Shanghai during two long stays in the city. &quot;The first impressions of a traveller arriving in Shanghai are those of people with deep-rooted ancestral rituals and traditions who threw themselves into the frenetic race of the present-day world. Blending into this &#x27;other way of thought&#x27; and without any prejudices, Bettina Rheims offers us a novel view of this paradox, which is the coexistence of China with its millenary traditions, its avant-garde facet, its official aspects and its underground features.&quot;

In 2005, at the Galerie De Noirmont, Rheims exhibited &quot;Héroïnes&quot;, a work that was primarily a homage to sculpture. On this occasion, the photographer collaborated with the designer Jean Colonna [note interne W] to dress the women in original clothing. &quot;Old haute couture dresses were thus re-assembled on each of these contemporary icons. These women, with their unconventional beauty, then played with a stone, which for a moment became their pedestal.&quot;

At the end of the 2000s, Bettina Rheims worked with Serge Bramly again and exhibited&quot; Rose, c&#x27;est Paris &quot;in 2010 at the National Library of France. The photographic tale was again built on a thread of fiction that Bettina Rheims and Serge Bramly created from autobiographical elements. In this work, Paris plays &quot;the role of the muse more than the subject, and [appears], through the characters woven into a story, in an almost allegorical form. A young woman we know by her initial, B., is looking for Rose, her twin sister who she claims has disappeared. Presented as a &#x27;great mysterious series&#x27;, a genre held dear by surrealists, &quot;Rose, c&#x27;est Paris&quot; is divided into thirteen episodes in which we discover among other things an unusual or obscure Paris, which is voluntarily timeless.&quot;

=== The 2010s ===
Exhibited in 2012 in Düsseldorf, the &quot;Gender Studies&quot; series pursues the questioning of gender representation. The device linking image and sound (by Frédéric Sanchez) presents 27 sound portraits of young men and women who responded to a request the photographer posted on Facebook. The photos are accompanied by interview clips and have featured in several exhibitions and a book.
=== Commissioned work===
Rheims has also worked on advertising campaigns for fashion and big brands, such as Chanel and Lancôme, as well as taking portraits of famous women for international magazines. Rheims says that she has been inspired by Diane Arbus and Helmut Newton as well as by the work of early painters.

<text>Middenmeer is a village in the Dutch province of North Holland. It is part of the municipality of Hollands Kroon, and lies about 23 km north of Hoorn.

Middenmeer was established in 1932 under the name of Sluis III. Nearby the village was a military airfield Middenmeer in WO II used by the Ie Verkenningsgroep of the Royal Netherlands Air Force. Now Middenmeer has an airfield for light and ultra light airplanes, Middenmeer Aerodrome.

On 1 July 1941, the Wieringermeer became a municipality and its first mayor was ir. S. Smeding.

On 17 April 1945, the dikes of the Wieringermeer polder were blown up by the German occupying forces and the Wieringermeer was inundated. Middenmeer as well as neighboring villages had to be evacuated.

On 11 December 1945 the polder was dry again.

== Moedermavo ==
In 1975 the first Moedermavo (English: School for mothers) of the Netherlands was started in Middenmeer. The moedermavo was an initiative of Anton Remmers, director of the local school, the Ariënsmavo. The school was a MAVO, a Dutch secondary school, aimed at adult women wanting to finish their education. At the time there were many women who had not received education after primary school or &#x27;huishoudschool&#x27; (English: housekeeping school). In the first year 130 women would attend. Adult students would mingle with teenaged students in between classes, but received classes separately. At the time, the moedermavo was considered a novel and revolutionary idea, but it proved successful. Within a year and a half there were already 41 moedermavos spread across The Netherlands.

==People==
Sicco Mansholt was mayor in 1945 for some weeks.

In 2001, the town of Middenmeer had 2805 inhabitants. The built-up area of the town was 0.82 km2, and contained 1193 residences. The wider statistical area of Middenmeer has a population of around 3210.

==Industry==
Microsoft is building a major new datacenter in the Wieringermeer polder near Middenmeer. Long-term employment may exceed 300 people.

<text>Songs for a New World is a work of musical theatre written and composed by Jason Robert Brown. This was Jason Robert Brown&#x27;s first produced show, originally produced Off-Broadway at the WPA Theatre in 1995. Brown and director Daisy Prince put together songs he had written for other venues and events, resulting in &quot;neither musical play nor revue, it is closer to a theatrical song cycle, a very theatrical song cycle.&quot;

The show lies between musical and song cycle, but it is neither; it is an abstract musical, a series of songs all connected by a theme: &quot;the moment of decision.&quot; The show has four performers who do not play the same characters throughout the show but who do have consistently developing character arcs nonetheless. Composer Brown has said &quot;It&#x27;s about one moment. It&#x27;s about hitting the wall and having to make a choice, or take a stand, or turn around and go back.&quot;

Because of its small cast and orchestra, &quot;Songs for a New World&quot; has become a favorite small show for colleges and local theatres, despite its vocally demanding score.

==Productions==
A workshop of the show was produced in Toronto. The original Off-Broadway production ran for a limited -week run, which included two 1/2 weeks of previews at the WPA Theatre in 1995. The original cast consisted of Brooks Ashmanskas, Andréa Burns, Jessica Molaskey and Billy Porter, with direction by Daisy Prince. The original band consisted of Jason Robert Brown on piano, Randy Landau on bass, Tom Partington on drums, Joe Reina on keyboards, and Warren Smith and Rob McEwan on percussion.

The first regional production was mounted by New Line Theatre in St. Louis in 1998.

&quot;Songs for a New World&quot; premiered in the UK in 2001, at the Bridewell Theatre in a production directed by Clive Paget. The cast was led by Craig Purnell (Best Actor in a Musical, WhatsOnStage Awards 2002), Golda Rosheuvel, Sarah Redmond and Nigel Richards.

The first professional revival in New York was staged in October 2008 at the Chernuchin Theatre, featuring a 14-member youth ensemble in addition to the four principal performers. The production was directed by Debbie Slevin.

In 2013, the show premiered in Paris, France.

In 2015, &quot;Songs for a New World&quot; was revived at the St James Theatre, London. The cast consisted of Cynthia Erivo, Jenna Russell, Damian Humbley and Dean John-Wilson. The production was directed by Adam Lenson.

A special Encores! Off-Center staged concert of &quot;Songs for a New World&quot; was performed at New York City Center June 27 through June 30, 2018. The production was directed by Kate Whoriskey and starred Shoshana Bean, Colin Donnell, Mykal Kilgore, and Solea Pfeiffer.

The show continues to be popular among amateur theatre groups with performances across Australia, the US and the UK.

In July 2020, as theatres around the world remained dark due to the COVID-19 pandemic, The Other Palace (formerly St James Theatre) again revived &quot;Songs for a New World&quot;. Directed by Séimí Campbell, starring Rachel John, Ramin Karimloo, Cedric Neal and Rachel Tucker and featuring new graduate Shem Omari James, the digital production was filmed entirely in isolation with contemporary news footage interwoven with the musical numbers. The production had music supervision by Adam Hoskins. This production was transferred into a physical production for 2 shows at The London Palladium on 11 October 2020. Rachel John, Cedric Neal, Rachel Tucker and Shem Omari James reprised their roles from the digital production. The role of Man 2 was taken over by David Hunter and the show had an ensemble made up of 3rd Year students from Mountview Academy. Audiences were socially distanced and there were other safety measures put into place to protect from the spreading of COVID-19. The London Palladium production is set to have an official West End transfer and run from 5 February 2021 at the Vaudeville Theatre, on the strand. Both Rachels, Cedric and David are all set to reprise their roles.

== Cast recordings ==
The 1996 Off-Broadway production was recorded by RCA and released in March 1997. Due to his contractual obligations to A&amp;M Records, Porter could not record his performance for RCA, and so he was replaced by Ty Taylor.

The 2018 Encores! production was recorded by Ghostlight Records and released in January 2019.

== Music ==
The music of &quot;Songs for a New World&quot; is influenced by a broad range of musical genres, including pop, gospel and jazz. Many of the songs combine elements of two or more of these genres. The piano features heavily throughout the show&#x27;s music.

An extensive background and analysis essay about the show was written by Scott Miller. The &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer noted: &quot;His debut foray into his own spotlight comes with &#x27;Songs for a New World,&#x27; a musical revue that shows Brown to be a capable songwriter of the Alan Menken school: commercial show-tune pop with palatable sentiment and easy-to-take melody... &#x27;Songs for a New World&#x27; seems to contain more cabaret convention and pianobar posing than any one revue should have to withstand.&quot;

<doc id="914401" wikidata="Q2248693" url="?curid=914401" title="Karamürsel">
<text>Karamürsel is a municipality and district of Kocaeli Province, Turkey. Its area is 262 km2, and its population is 59,676 (2022). It is on the south coast of the Gulf of İzmit. Before its conquest by the Ottomans it used to be called by the Greek name of Praenetos (Πραινετός in Greek). The modern name commemorates Kara Mürsel who founded the Ottoman navy and designed distinctive galley ships, called &quot;kadırgas,&quot; for it.

Karamürsel holds special significance for the Turkish Navy, as it was here in 1323 that the Ottoman Empire first established an outlet to the sea, thus laying the foundations for the Ottoman Navy which would go on to dominate the eastern Mediterranean for several centuries.

The Karamürsel area is not as heavily industrialised as other parts of Kocaeli province.

Ferry services link Karamürsel to İzmit and Hereke on the northern side of the Bay of İzmit.

==Population==
According to the Ottoman General Census of 1881/82-1893, the kaza of Karamürsel had a total population of 25,322, consisting of 11,023 Greeks, 10,732 Muslims, 3,549 Armenians and 18 foreign citizens. In 1923 the Greeks were obliged to leave Turkey under the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne that concluded the Turkish War of Independence.

Today the people living in Karamürsel and its villages are mainly Muslim Manav Turks and immigrants known as &quot;muhacir&quot; in Turkish. Some of these immigrants arrived from Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Romania, North Macedonia, Lazistan, Georgia, Circassia and Crimea during and after the fall of Ottoman Empire; a particularly large number of Bosniaks settled in the area after the 1877-78 Russo-Turkish war. Many Muslim refugees from all around the Ottoman Empire settled in the region and this ethnic structure has resulted in a culture influenced by that of the Balkans and Caucasus. More recently Karamürsel has also attracted settlers from other parts of Turkey, especially the Black Sea Region.

== The 1999 İzmit Earthquake ==
Karamürsel was badly damaged on 17 August 1999 during the devastating İzmit earthquake, which rocked the eastern part of the Marmara Region. in Karamürsel alone 164 people lost their lives and many were left homeless. After the earthquake many people left for other parts of Turkey and Karamürsel resembled a ghost-town over the winter of 1999. Since then houses have been repaired and business reopened. During the earthquake, a tsunami struck both sides of the Bay of İzmit in about a single minute. Although the tsunami was not particularly large, substantial portions of the towns of Gölcük, Degirmendere and Karamürsel were inundated by the sea (Altinok et al., 1999). The coast of Karamürsel has now been repaired and reconstructed. There is a monument to those who died on the waterfront in Karamürsel.

== The military ==
Karamürsel has a long history as an important naval base. The first Ottoman shipyard was built in Karamürsel in 1327. The ships built there formed the nucleus of the first Ottoman Naval Forces.

=== American base ===
Due to its strategic and naturally protected location, Karamürsel has been used as a naval base to help control access to the Black Sea. During the Cold War a U.S. military base was also located in Karamürsel for many years to intercept Russian radio transmissions. The station, containing a 500-foot-diameter antenna array AN/FLR-9, called Elephant Cage, was in place from 1957 until 1979; this huge landmark was visible from everywhere in Karamürsel, from villages on the hills surrounding the town and even from the shores across the Bay of Izmit. In 1975, Turkey took control of the U.S. intelligence‐gathering base. After the US military left the base was transferred to the Turkish Navy and is still in operation today. However, the US military removed an important chip from the antenna so that it would not be used after they left. The antenna was demolished in the mid-1990s.

In 1958, a USDESEA Educational System school for the dependents of the U.S. military opened at the Karamürsel Air Station Starting as an elementary school, it was expanded to take middle school students and eventually both junior and senior high school students. In 1961, a new school building was constructed and served the educational needs of the military personnel&#x27;s children until the base itself closed in 1979.

In addition to the students who lived on the base with their parents, the American dependents&#x27; school at the Karamürsel Air Station (KCDI) became a regional boarding school that took students from grades nine through twelve. High-school-aged students whose parents were stationed in other Turkish locations, those stationed in Iraklion Air Station in Crete, and the children of civilian federal employees working for the VOA (Voice of America) radio station in Xanthi, Greece then attended high school in Karamürsel.

<text>Association football is the most popular sport in Russia, surpassing ice hockey by a wide margin. Men&#x27;s football is overseen by the Russian Football Union, having the Russian Premier League as the first tier of the Russian football league system, with the Russian Football National League being the second tier.

On 28 February 2022, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and in accordance with a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), FIFA and UEFA suspended the participation of Russia, including in the Qatar 2022 World Cup. The Russian Football Union unsuccessfully appealed the FIFA and UEFA bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which upheld the bans.

==Following the break up of the USSR==
With the USSR collapsing in 1991, Russia emerged as its successor state, with the Soviet football federation being transformed in the Russian football federation. While the national teams and the clubs used to be linked to state institutions or mass organizations, in 1991 some of them became private enterprises. Just like in many other spheres of business, corrupt and sometimes bloody division of power began. Furthermore, many teams of the erstwhile Soviet Top League, were now divided between the national football associations of the newly independent republics. Many of the top brand names lost their financing from the government and were left to rot, waiting for some forms of sponsorship. Citizens of Russia are interested mostly in the national team that gets to compete in the World Cup and the European Championship, and in the Premier league, where clubs from different cities look to become champions of Russia. There are also competitions considered less important, such as the Russian Cup. Some of the most successful clubs include Spartak Moscow, Lokomotiv Moscow, CSKA Moscow, Zenit St. Petersburg, Dynamo Moscow and FC Torpedo Moscow.

Today, football is the most popular in Russia, beating hockey. A very high proportion of men are interested in it to a certain extent (and many children play it regularly) and women also join men when it comes to the national team. The Russian league is rapidly regaining its former strength because of huge sponsorship deals, an influx of finances and a fairly high degree of competitiveness with roughly 5 teams capable of winning the title. Russian top teams are usually sponsored by state-controlled companies. For example, Gazprom sponsors Zenit Saint Petersburg, Lukoil sponsors FC Spartak Moscow, Russian Railways sponsors FC Lokomotiv Moscow etc. Many notable talented foreign players have been and are playing in the Russian league as well as local talented players worthy of a spot in the starting eleven of the best clubs. Foreign players sometimes face a very hostile environment. A problem of racism in Russian football is particularly important.

The Russian national team gained attention when they defeated traditional European powerhouse Netherlands 3–1 in the Euro 2008 quarterfinals before losing to eventual champions Spain. Nevertheless, four players made the Team of the Tournament. Some players such as Andrei Arshavin and Roman Pavlyuchenko earned big-money moves to the English Premier League after impressing at the tournament. Currently, the majority of Russian footballers play in a home league mainly due to the foreign players limits. This causes a significant disbalance in players&#x27; salaries with Russian footballers getting more than their foreign counterparts only because of their nationality.

Thus as of 2010 the Russian Premier League was among the best in Eastern Europe, as evidenced by recent victories in the UEFA Cup (CSKA Moscow defeated Sporting CP in the 2005 final and Zenit St. Petersburg earned a victory over Rangers F.C. in the 2008 UEFA Cup in Manchester and also claimed the UEFA Super Cup in a 2–1 win over Manchester United.)

On 28 February 2022, due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and in accordance with a recommendation by the International Olympic Committee (IOC), FIFA and UEFA suspended the participation of Russia, including in the Qatar 2022 World Cup. The Russian Football Union unsuccessfully appealed the FIFA and UEFA bans to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, which upheld the bans.

==League system==
The first level of the Russian league system is the 16-club Premier League. Below are two other professional levels, namely First League and Second League, both managed by the National Football League. The First League consists of 18 clubs, and the Second League has 72 clubs split geographically into Groups 1 to 4 (representing Southern, Western, Central and Eastern parts of Russia) with varying numbers of clubs. Four clubs from the Far East are allocated to Groups 2 to 4. After each season, the top two clubs of the First League replace the bottom two clubs of the Premier League, and champions of each Second League group replace the four bottom clubs of the First League.

The Second League Division B is the lowest level of professional football in Russia. The next level of football is the Amateur Football League (aka Third Division), which is split into ten zones: North-West (Severo-Zapad), Golden Ring (Zolotoe Koltso), Moscow City (Gorod Moskva), Moscow Region (Podmoskovye), Center, South (Yug), Volga Region (Privolzhye), Ural and West Siberia (Ural i Zapadnaya Sibir), Siberia (Sibir), and Far East (Dalniy Vostok). Also there is a Cup competition in each zone. At the end of the season, the zonal champions and cup winners participate in the AFL Finals to determine the AFL Champions and Cup Winners. There is no automatical promotion/relegation between Second League and AFL, though the winners of each Amateur Football League zone are eligible for promotion to the Second League Division B, provided that they have taken part in the AFL Finals. The actual promotion and relegation is subject to meeting Professional Football League requirements.

There is no promotion/relegation between the AFL and lower level either, and the composition of AFL zones can change a lot from season to season, as the AFL is basically open to new clubs. At the lower level, there are championships of federal subjects. They are often called the Fourth Division, though these competitions are formally not part of the league system. Nevertheless, some AFL zonal football unions organize tournaments (like Champions League) for the champions of federal subjects which are the members of the respective union. Many federal subject leagues provide a much stronger competition, so clubs often prefer to stay at the 5th level rather than enter the AFL.
The competitions at the 4th and 5th level have a spring-autumn format, unlike the autumn-spring professional league format.

==National team==

The national teams prior were the Soviet Union national football team, which was a football world power, and the transitional CIS national football team, which took part in the Euro 1992. Since the collapse of Soviet Union the Russia national team has had success in Euro 2008 before it took ten years to repeat this feat, this time as host of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Russian team was eliminated in the group stage of the 1994 World Cup, 2002 World Cup, 2014 World Cup, Euro 1992 (as CIS), Euro 1996, Euro 2004, Euro 2012, Euro 2016 and Euro 2020. Russia didn&#x27;t qualify for the major tournaments on four occasions: in 1998, 2000, 2006 and 2010. Russian team is currently ranked 35th in the FIFA World Ranking.

==Hosting the World Cup==
On December 2, 2010, Russia was awarded the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Russia hosted the tournament for the first time, becoming the largest country to host the World Cup, a title held by the United States since 1994.

==Cup competitions==
The main cup competition in Russia is the Russian Cup. Only professional clubs take part in it.

There is also an Amateur Football League Cup, a competition for the Amateur Football League clubs. The winners of this cup are eligible for promotion to the Second Division. Cups of federal subjects are also played.

==European competitions==
The Russian League was in 2013 regarded as the 6th strongest league in Europe, based on the UEFA coefficient.
Russian club sides constantly compete in the UEFA Champions League and Europa League. Over the last years Russian clubs have won three major European trophies. These are 2004–05 UEFA Cup won by CSKA Moscow, 2007–08 UEFA Cup and 2008 UEFA Super Cup won by Zenit St. Petersburg.

==Women&#x27;s football==
Women&#x27;s football is not as popular in Russia as men&#x27;s football, although it has increased in popularity in the 2000s.

== Football stadiums in Russia ==

Stadiums with a capacity of 40,000 or higher are included. The Grand Sports Arena of the Luzhniki Olympic Complex is the largest stadium in Russia, followed by the Gazprom Arena, the home of FC Zenit. On 24 May 2023, Zenit became the first Russian sports club with 10 million followers on social media.

==Lines and stations==

Nose Railway has two lines:
* Myōken Line (Kawanishi-noseguchi - Myōkenguchi)
* Nissei Line (Yamashita - Nissei-chuo) 
The former is the main route and the latter branches off at Yamashita Station.

In addition to the railway, Nose Railway operates a funicular (Myoken Cable) and a chairlift (Myoken Lift).

==Operations==
*S: Trains stop; |, ↑: Trains pass; ↑: Only one direction
* trains are operated all day every day
* trains run from Nissei Chūō to Osaka-umeda in the morning, and vice versa in the evening on weekdays.

<text>Jan Johansson (16 September 1931 – 9 November 1968) was a Swedish jazz pianist. His album &quot;Jazz på svenska&quot; (&quot;Jazz in Swedish&quot;) is the best selling jazz release ever in Sweden; it has sold over a quarter of a million copies and has been streamed more than 50 million times on Spotify. He was the father of former HammerFall drummer Anders Johansson and Stratovarius keyboardist Jens Johansson, who run Heptagon Records which keeps their father&#x27;s recordings available.

== Biography ==

Johansson was a native of Söderhamn, in the Hälsingland province of Sweden. Studying classical piano as a child, he would also go on to master the guitar, organ and accordion, before turning on to swing and bebop as a teenager. He met saxophonist Stan Getz while at university. He abandoned his studies to play jazz full-time, and worked with many American jazz musicians, becoming the first European to be invited to join the Jazz at the Philharmonic package.

The years 1961 to 1968, produced a string of classic albums, which would help define his style of re-imagining traditional European folk tunes via jazz and the avant garde. These included &quot;Jazz på svenska&quot; (&quot;Jazz in Swedish&quot;) and &quot;Jazz på ryska&quot; (&quot;Jazz in Russian&quot;) which are both available in an expanded form on CD. &quot;Jazz på ungerska&quot; (&quot;Jazz in Hungarian&quot;) together with Danish Jazz violinist Svend Asmussen is the third album in that series. &quot;Jazz på svenska&quot; comprises variations on sixteen Swedish folk songs with Georg Riedel playing double bass. During this period, Johansson also made several recordings with Radiojazzgruppen.

The Grammy award winning albums &quot;Musik genom fyra sekler&quot; (&quot;Music from the past four centuries&quot;) builds on traditional Swedish melodies, but this time uses larger groups of musicians. There were also &quot;300.000&quot; and two trio sets, &quot;8 Bitar&quot; and &quot;Innertrio&quot;, which have been reissued as a single CD.

With his career including film &amp; TV music, Johansson is also best known as the composer of &quot;Here Comes Pippi Longstocking&quot; (&quot;Här kommer Pippi Långstrump&quot;), the theme song of the famous Swedish TV series, &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot;. With lyrics by character/series creator Astrid Lindgren and sung by the series&#x27; young star Inger Nilsson, it would also be one of Johansson&#x27;s last works.

In November 1968, Johansson died in a car crash on his way to a concert in a church in Jönköping, Sweden.

== Influence ==

American hip hop group Non Phixion sampled &quot;Bandura&quot; for their song &quot;Skum&quot;. The Swedish band Opeth has claimed him as an influence on the title track for their album &quot;Heritage&quot;.

<doc id="914432" wikidata="Q14275" url="?curid=914432" title="Omega Centauri">
<text>Omega Centauri (ω Cen, NGC 5139, or Caldwell 80) is a globular cluster in the constellation of Centaurus that was first identified as a non-stellar object by Edmond Halley in 1677. Located at a distance of , it is the largest known globular cluster in the Milky Way at a diameter of roughly 150 light-years. It is estimated to contain approximately 10 million stars, with a total mass of 4 million solar masses, making it the most massive known globular cluster in the Milky Way.

Omega Centauri is very different from most other galactic globular clusters to the extent that it is thought to have originated as the core remnant of a disrupted dwarf galaxy.

==Observation history==
Around 150 AD, Greco-Roman writer and astronomer Ptolemy catalogued this object in his &quot;Almagest&quot; as a star on the centaur&#x27;s back, &quot;Quae est in principio scapulae&quot;. German cartographer Johann Bayer used Ptolemy&#x27;s data to designate this object &quot;Omega Centauri&quot; with his 1603 publication of &quot;Uranometria&quot;. Using a telescope from the South Atlantic island of Saint Helena, English astronomer Edmond Halley observed this object in 1677, listing it as a non-stellar object. In 1716, it was published by Halley among his list of six &quot;luminous spots or patches&quot; in the &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society&quot;.

Swiss astronomer Jean-Philippe de Cheseaux included Omega Centauri in his 1746 list of 21 nebulae, as did French astronomer Lacaille in 1755, whence the catalogue number is designated L I.5. It was first recognized as a globular cluster by Scottish astronomer James Dunlop in 1826, who described it as a &quot;beautiful globe of stars very gradually and moderately compressed to the centre&quot;.

==Properties==
At a distance of about from Earth, Omega Centauri is one of the few globular clusters visible to the naked eye—and appears almost as large as the full Moon when seen from a dark, rural area. It is the brightest, largest and, at 4 million solar masses, the most massive-known globular cluster associated with the Milky Way. Of all the globular clusters in the Local Group of galaxies, only Mayall II in the Andromeda Galaxy is brighter and more massive. Orbiting through the Milky Way, Omega Centauri contains several million Population II stars and is about 12 billion years old.

The stars in the core of Omega Centauri are so crowded that they are estimated to average only 0.1 light-year away from each other. The internal dynamics have been analyzed using measurements of the radial velocities of 469 stars. The members of this cluster are orbiting the center of mass with a peak velocity dispersion of 7.9 km s−1. The mass distribution inferred from the kinematics is slightly more extended than, though not strongly inconsistent with, the luminosity distribution.

===Evidence of a central black hole===

A 2008 study presented evidence for an intermediate-mass black hole at the center of Omega Centauri, based on observations made by the Hubble Space Telescope and Gemini Observatory on Cerro Pachón in Chile. Hubble&#x27;s Advanced Camera for Surveys showed that stars are bunching up near the center of Omega Centauri, as evidenced by the gradual increase in starlight near the center. Using instruments at the Gemini Observatory to measure the speed of stars swirling in the cluster&#x27;s core, E. Noyola and colleagues found that stars closer to the core are moving faster than stars farther away. This measurement was interpreted to mean that unseen matter at the core is interacting gravitationally with nearby stars. By comparing these results with standard models, the astronomers concluded that the most likely cause was the gravitational pull of a dense, massive object such as a black hole. They calculated the object&#x27;s mass at 40,000 solar masses.

More recent work has challenged conclusions that there is a black hole in the cluster&#x27;s core, in particular disputing the proposed location of the cluster center. Calculations using a revised location for the center found that the velocity of core stars does not vary with distance, as would be expected if an intermediate-mass black hole were present. The same studies also found that starlight does not increase toward the center but instead remains relatively constant. The authors noted that their results do not entirely rule out the black hole proposed by Noyola and colleagues, but they do not confirm it, and they limit its maximum mass to 12,000 solar masses.

A study from July 10, 2024 has examined seven fast-moving stars from the center of Omega Centauri and found that their speeds were consistent with an intermediate-mass black hole of at least 8,200 solar masses.

=== Disrupted dwarf galaxy===
It has been speculated that Omega Centauri is the core of a dwarf galaxy that was disrupted and absorbed by the Milky Way. Indeed, Kapteyn&#x27;s Star, which is currently only 13 light-years away from Earth, is thought to originate from Omega Centauri. Omega Centauri&#x27;s chemistry and motion in the Milky Way are also consistent with this picture. Like Mayall II, Omega Centauri has a range of metallicities and stellar ages that suggests that it did not all form at once (as globular clusters are thought to form) and may in fact be the remainder of the core of a smaller galaxy long since incorporated into the Milky Way.

==In fiction==
The novel &quot;Singularity&quot; (2012), by Ian Douglas, presents as fact that Omega Centauri and Kapteyn&#x27;s Star originate from a disrupted dwarf galaxy, and this origin is central to the novel&#x27;s plot. A number of scientific aspects of Omega Centauri are discussed as the story progresses, including the likely radiation environment inside the cluster and what the sky might look like from inside the cluster.

The character Atlan has adventures in Omega Centauri in cycle 7 of the &quot;Atlan&quot; series, a spinoff of the German science fiction series &quot;Perry Rhodan.&quot;

<doc id="914433" wikidata="Q16933279" url="?curid=914433" title="1994 São Toméan parliamentary election">
<text>Parliamentary elections were held in São Tomé and Príncipe on 2 October 1994. The result was a victory for the opposition Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe - Social Democratic Party (MLSTP/PSD), which won 27 of the 55 seats in the National Assembly. Voter turnout was only 52.1%. Following the elections Carlos Graça was appointed Prime Minister of a coalition government formed by the MLSTP/PSD and the Democratic Convergence Party (PCD-GR).

==Background==
In early 1994 relations between the government and the presidency again began to deteriorate. In April Trovoada publicly dissociated himself from government policy. In June political tension increased when the Democratic Convergence Party accused Trovoada of systematic obstruction of the government&#x27;s programme. The same month opposition parties petitioned the president to dismiss the government and to appoint foreign auditors to investigate the management of public funds under its term of office. 

On 2 July 1994 Trovoada dismissed the government of Prime Minister Norberto d&#x27;Alva Costa Alegre citing &#x27;institutional conflict&#x27; as the justification for the decision. Moreover, the president accused the ruling party of ignoring presidential vetoes and of attempting to replace the semi-presidential system with a parliamentary regime without executive powers for the head of state. On 4 July Trovoada appointed Evaristo do Espirito Santo de Carvalho (the minister of defence and security in the outgoing administration) as prime minister. The PCD-GR, which refused to participate in the new government, subsequently expelled Carvalho from the party. An interim administration, comprising eight ministers, took office on 9 July. On the following day, in an attempt to resolve the political crisis, Trovoada dissolved the national assembly and announced that parliamentary elections would be held on 2 October.

<doc id="914436" wikidata="Q1473687" url="?curid=914436" title="Shield-maiden">
<text>A shield-maiden ( ) was a female warrior from Scandinavian folklore and mythology.

The term most often shows up in fornaldarsögur such as &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;. However, female warriors are also mentioned in the Latin work &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. Both the fornaldarsögur and Gesta Danorum were written after the Viking Age and are considered fictional. Earlier reports of fighting women occur in some Roman sources from Late Antiquity. They are often associated with the mythical Valkyries, which may have inspired the shieldmaidens. They may have also been inspired by accounts of Amazons.

==Etymology and meaning==
The term Shield-maiden is a calque of the . Since Old Norse has no word that directly translates to warrior, but rather drengr, rekkr and seggr can all refer to male warrior and bragnar can mean warriors, it is problematic to say that the term meant female warrior to Old Norse speakers. Judith Jesch researched the word in an attempt to find its origin. While she found that it was used to describe Amazons as well as women warriors in Sagas, typically from the East, she found no conclusive evidence that it dates to the Viking Age, and suggests that it may have entered Old Norse in the 13th century. Additionally, the term is found in the name of a ship and in the nickname of a poet. 

In modern English, it can refer to a generic female warrior, but is also used to refer specifically to a type of character appearing in the fornaldarsögur. Confusingly, it is sometimes used to refer to hypothetical female warriors in the Viking Age. Jesch argues against this usage in academic works, as to avoid confusion between textual and literal Shield-maidens. The term is also used in modern English as synonymous with valkyrie. Indeed, Brynhildr, a valkyrie, describes herself as a shield-maiden in the Vǫlsunga saga. However, the text was composed in the 13th century, and not in the Viking Age. In the Viking Age, valkyries served drinks in Vahalla and choose the dead in battle, but were not warriors in the same way as shield-maidens in the sagas.

==Shield-maidens in literature==
Examples of shield-maidens mentioned by name in the Norse sagas include Brynhildr in the &quot;Vǫlsunga saga&quot;, Hervor in &quot;Hervarar saga ok Heiðreks&quot;, the Brynhildr of the &quot;Bósa saga ok Herrauðs&quot;, and the Swedish princess Thornbjǫrg in &quot;Hrólfs saga Gautrekssonar&quot;. Princess Hed, Visna, Lagertha and Veborg are female warriors named in &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;.

Two shield-maidens appear in &quot;Hervarar saga&quot;. The first of these Hervors was known to have taken up typically masculine roles early in her childhood and often raided travelers in the woods dressed as a man. Later in her life, she claimed the cursed sword Tyrfing from her father&#x27;s burial site and became a seafaring raider. She eventually settled and married. Her granddaughter was also named Hervor and commanded forces against attacking Huns. Although the saga remarks on her bravery she is mortally wounded by enemy forces and dies on the battlefield.

Saxo Grammaticus reported that women fought on the side of the Danes at the Battle of Brávellir in the year 750:
Scholars Judith Jesch and Jenny Jochens speculate that shield-maidens&#x27; often grim fates or their sudden return to typically female roles is a testament to their role as figures of both male and female fantasy as well as emblematic of the danger of abandoning gender roles.

== Brynhildr Buðladóttir and Guðrún Gjúkadóttir ==
Brynhildr of the &quot;Vǫlsunga saga&quot;, along with her rival in love, Guðrún Gjúkadóttir, provides an example of how a shield-maiden compares to more conventional aristocratic womanhood in the sagas. Brynhildr is chiefly concerned with honour, much like a male warrior. When she ends up married to Guðrún&#x27;s brother Gunnarr instead of Sigurðr, the man she intended to marry, Brynhildr speaks a verse comparing the courage of the two men:
Brynhildr is married to Gunnarr and not Sigurðr because of deceit and trickery, including a potion of forgetfulness given to Sigurðr so he forgets his previous relationship with her. Brynhildr is upset not only for the loss of Sigurðr, but also for the dishonesty involved. Similar to her male counterparts, the shield-maiden prefers to do things straightforwardly, without the deception considered stereotypically feminine in much of medieval literature. She enacts her vengeance directly, resulting in the deaths of herself, Sigurðr, and Sigurð&#x27;s son by Guðrún. By killing the child, she demonstrates an understanding of feud and filial responsibility; if he lived, the boy would grow up to take vengeance on Brynhildr&#x27;s family.

Guðrún has a similar concern with family ties, but at first does not usually act directly. She is more inclined to incite her male relatives to action than take up arms herself. Guðrún is no shield-maiden, and Brynhildr mocks her for this, saying, &quot;Only ask what is best for you to know. That is suitable for noble women. And it is easy to be satisfied while everything happens according to your desires.&quot; In her later marriages, however, she is willing to kill her children, burn down a hall, and send her other sons to avenge the murder of her daughter, Svanhildr. In the world of the sagas, women can be both honorable and remorseless, much like the male heroes.

==Historical existence==
Much of the study of shield-maidens focuses on them as a literary phenomenon. However, literary shield-maidens have long been seen by some as evidence of historical female warriors in the Viking Age. In the early 1900s a female weapon grave was found in Nordre Kjølen and labeled a shield-maiden. Shield-maidens however were not studied in depth till textual scholars began to examine the issue. Præstgaard Andersen, Jesch and Jochens all began to examine the textual sources. Neil Price, argues that they existed. Some scholars, such as professor Judith Jesch, have cited a lack of evidence for trained or regular female warriors.

===Archaeology===
Graves of female settlers containing weapons have been uncovered, but scholars do not agree how these should be interpreted. Norse immigrant graves in England and chemical analysis of the remains suggested a somewhat equal distribution of men and women, suggesting husbands took wives, while some of the women were under the burial. In a tie-in special to the TV series &quot;Vikings&quot;, Neil Price showed that a 10th-century Birka-burial excavated in the 1870s containing many weapons and the bones of two horses turned out to be the grave of a woman upon bone analysis by Anna Kjellström. In 2017, DNA analysis confirmed that the person was female, the so-called Birka female Viking warrior.

===Historical accounts===
Roman sources occasionally mention women fighting among the Germanic peoples they faced; however, such reports are rare, and Hermann Reichert writes that fighting women were probably exceptional, uncommon cases rather than the norm.

There are historical attestations that Viking Age women took part in warfare. The Byzantine historian John Skylitzes records that women fought in battle when Sviatoslav I of Kiev attacked the Byzantines in Bulgaria in 971. When the Varangians (not to be confused with the Byzantine Varangian Guard) had suffered a defeat in the Siege of Dorostolon, the victors were stunned to discover armed women among the fallen warriors.

When Leif Erikson&#x27;s pregnant half-sister Freydís Eiríksdóttir was in Vinland, she is reported to have taken up a sword and, bare-breasted, scared away the attacking Skrælings. The fight is recounted in the &quot;Greenland saga&quot;, which does not explicitly refer to Freydís as a shield-maiden.

==In popular culture==
Female warriors inspired by the Norse sagas are portrayed in numerous works of historical and fantasy fiction, including prominently in such works as the 2013 TV series &quot;Vikings&quot;. The show depicts Lagertha (played by Katheryn Winnick) as the greatest shield maiden in the world. In the TV show Beforeigners Alfhildr Enginnsdottir (played by Krista Kosonen) and Urd (played by Ágústa Eva Erlendsdóttir) are shield maidens, who fought alongside Thorir Hund against Olaf II of Norway. Alfhildr later came to modern day Norway through a time hole and now works as a police inspector.

Explaining the inclusion of a female Viking warrior protagonist in the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed Valhalla&quot;, the game&#x27;s historical advisor Thierry Noël said, &quot;The archaeological sources are highly debated on that specific issue. But (...) it was part of [the Norse] conception of the world. Sagas and myths from Norse society are full of tough female characters and warriors. It was part of their idea of the world, that women and men are equally formidable in battle&quot;. The game&#x27;s main character can be a male or female (choice of gender at game start) named Eivor Varinsson/Varinsdottir who is the leader of the Raven Clan alongside their adoptive brother Sigurd Styrbjornsson. However, canonically the character is female and known as Eivor Varinsdottir, a shield-maiden. A Shield-maiden is depicted in the 2022 film The Northman.

While female warriors are a staple of fantasy fiction, they are not often referred to as shield-maidens. Some who are include Éowyn in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and Thorgil in Nancy Farmer&#x27;s &quot;The Sea of Trolls&quot; trilogy.

<doc id="914437" wikidata="Q2663997" url="?curid=914437" title="Victor Zsasz">
<text>Victor Zsasz ( or or ), also known as Mr. Zsasz or simply Zsasz, is a villain appearing in comic books published by DC Comics. The character first appeared in &quot;&quot; #1 (June 1992). He is a sadomasochistic and psychopathic serial killer who carves a tally mark onto himself for each of his victims. A recurring adversary of the superhero Batman, Zsasz belongs to the collective of enemies that make up Batman&#x27;s rogues gallery.

The character has been featured in various forms of non-comics media. Most notably, Danny Jacobs has voiced Zsasz in the &quot;&quot; video game franchise, and he has been portrayed in live-action by Anthony Carrigan in the television series &quot;Gotham&quot;, Alex Morf in the Arrowverse series &quot;Batwoman&quot;, Tim Booth in the film &quot;Batman Begins&quot; (2005), and Chris Messina in the DC Extended Universe film &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; (2020).

==Publication history==
Zsasz first appeared in &quot;&quot; #1 (June 1992), as part of the &quot;&quot; four-part story arc written by Alan Grant and drawn by Norm Breyfogle. As revealed in the foreword to the trade paperback of &quot;Batman: The Last Arkham&quot;, Zsasz&#x27;s name is derived from that of psychiatrist Thomas Szasz; Grant saw the name while visiting a library.

==Fictional character biography==
===Origin story===
&quot;The First Cut is the Deepest: The Secret Origin of Mr. Zsasz&quot; was part of &quot;The Batman Chronicles&quot; #3 (December 1996). The origin story was told by Zsasz himself. It is learned that Victor Zsasz was the head of his own international company and had amassed a large personal fortune in addition to his family&#x27;s wealth. At the age of 25, his parents died in a boating accident, sending him into a deep depression. He turned to gambling, losing money in competitions around the world. One night, he ended up in a Gotham City casino known as the Iceberg Lounge, where he gambled everything he owned and ended up losing it all to the Penguin; afterwards he saw that his life was empty, driven by desire, and there was no point to his existence. While Zsasz was attempting to commit suicide by jumping from Gotham Bridge, a homeless man tried to assault him with a knife after Zsasz refused to give him money. Instinctively grabbing the knife, Zsasz saw in the man&#x27;s eyes that all life is meaningless and that nothing and no one matters. He then proceeded to stab the man to death as a &quot;gift&quot; for saving his life. From then on, he dedicated himself to &quot;liberating&quot; others from their pointless existence (Zsasz often refers to his victims as &quot;zombies&quot;). He usually preys on young women, but has no qualms over whom he murders. He slits his victims&#x27; throats and leaves them in lifelike poses, adding a tally mark to himself each time. He has been declared insane and is regularly incarcerated in Arkham Asylum courtesy of Batman, breaking out on occasion to carry on his killing.

===Later story arcs===
During his debut appearance in &quot;&quot;&#x27;s opening story arc, &quot;&quot;, Zsasz bribes a contractor to include a secret passage leading out from his cell during the asylum&#x27;s reconstruction under its new head, Jeremiah Arkham, who inherited the asylum from his uncle, Amadeus Arkham. Although Zsasz is restrained during the daytime when he is being treated personally by Jeremiah Arkham, he is brought back to his cell at night where he would leave the asylum through the secret passage, unbeknownst to the night guards. After murders fitting his &quot;modus operandi&quot; begin surfacing, Batman and Commissioner James Gordon fake Batman&#x27;s insanity to get him inside the asylum and investigate Zsasz. Jeremiah Arkham is exceptionally brutal towards Batman, who had supposedly murdered a police officer; over the course of the &quot;treatment&quot;, Zsasz had warped Jeremiah&#x27;s mind and turned him into a mere henchman. Due to these continuous conversations with Jeremiah Arkham, Zsasz realises Batman is a plant and subsequently murders both the contractor and another inmate at Arkham who knows of Zsasz&#x27;s ploy. Both Nightwing and Batman catch up to Zsasz when he tries to escape for the final time and put him back in Arkham.

Zsasz later appears in Parts 3 and 4 of &quot;&quot;. In Part 3 of &quot;Knightfall&quot;, Zsasz takes an all-girls boarding school hostage and holds the students at knifepoint until Batman arrives, briefly leaving to kill two police officers who were sent to arrest him. Though weakened both physically and mentally due to the strain of pushing himself for so long to capture the escaped inmates, Batman fights with Zsasz and tries to ignore the lunatic&#x27;s mockery. He finally snaps, after Zsasz says that they are really one and the same, and administers a savage beating. In Part 4, Zsasz&#x27;s appearance is a mere cameo, depicting him being led out of the boarding school by police and Harvey Bullock personally threatening him.

During the &quot;&quot; storyline, Zsasz is a patient in Leslie Thompkins&#x27; field hospital for a brief while, proving to be eminently deadly even when unconscious and strapped to a stretcher when he manages to open one of the arteries of a field orderly with his fingernails. Once he wakes up, he is confronted by Thompkins, whose charity contrasts with his total emptiness; she briefly gives him pause, but is repelled by his evil. Zsasz later appears in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #796, where he fights Stephanie Brown in her role as Robin. He attempts to slit her throat, but is distracted by her unexpected ferocity and falls back, where he attacks and attempts to kill Batman. However, Stephanie eventually defeats him. Zsasz makes a brief appearance in &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; #7. He is part of the Secret Society of Super Villains and is one of the many of their members sent to attack Metropolis before being defeated.

Zsasz is not seen in any major villainous role again until &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #815, released in March 2006, entitled &quot;Victims&quot;. Before a quarterly psychiatric review, Zsasz kills his guards with metal poles attached to his neck bracket and escapes to kill again. Batman hunts for Zsasz, which proves unsuccessful until Zsasz gains access to a charity event (attended by Bruce Wayne) and stabs Wayne&#x27;s beloved butler, Alfred Pennyworth, in the stomach. Wayne drives Alfred to the hospital, saving his life. To lure Zsasz to him, Wayne holds a press conference in which he announces that Alfred is still alive. Having already made a scar for Alfred, Zsasz realises that his tally is off by one (Zsasz remarks: &quot;My skin...it&#x27;s crawling...every inch of it feels...wrong.&quot;) During the second part of &quot;Victims&quot; (&quot;Detective Comics&quot; #816), after a fight with Batman, Zsasz proceeds to the hospital to finish off Alfred. Batman catches him off-guard and knocks him unconscious, thus saving Alfred&#x27;s life and sending Zsasz back to Arkham. Throughout this appearance, Cliff Chiang&#x27;s artwork portrays Zsasz with visual elements commonly associated with the skinhead subculture, including work boots resembling Doc Martens, tight jeans, a white tank top, suspenders or &quot;braces&quot; and a close-cropped hairstyle. Additionally, Chiang&#x27;s portrayal of Zsasz is more outwardly physically imposing than the gaunt, wiry physique created by Breyfogle and favored by most subsequent artists. No dialogue in the story arc references Zsasz being a skinhead nor does it explain his increased musculature and it is likely these visual elements were the decision of the artist.

Zsasz is later seen again in the &quot;Gotham Underground&quot; story arc where, in issue #3, he appears in a disguised Batman&#x27;s cell at Blackgate Prison and attempts to kill him with a knife. He ends up cutting Batman&#x27;s arm just as he was waking up and the resulting fight ends with Zsasz being knocked unconscious and Batman being rushed to the hospital. A naked, desperate and totally deranged Zsasz appeared in the first issue of &quot;&quot; (2008), written by Kevin Smith, killing a young couple and threatening their children before Batman subdues him. His thoughts move so quickly that there are no spaces between the words. In the issue, Batman says that of all the criminals he fights, he hates Zsasz the most.

In the &quot;&quot; storyline, Zsasz is recruited by a new Black Mask into a group of villains aiming to take over Gotham. This arrangement is explained further in a continuous story arc through the &quot;&quot; series, with Black Mask hiring Zsasz after he saved the former&#x27;s life following a confrontation with former employee the Firefly. Black Mask presents Zsasz with a briefcase filled with cash and advises him to finally live out his dream, knowing full well any &#x27;dream&#x27; of Zsasz&#x27;s would culminate in mass murder. Apprehensive at first on how to go about this, he eventually decides to take Black Mask up on his offer, dressing in Armani suits (appearing near exactly the image of Woody Harrelson&#x27;s character in &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;) and purchasing a warehouse as his base of operations. During an investigation into the discovery of several children murdered by Humpty Dumpty, Damian Wayne is &#x27;captured&#x27; by a man soliciting runaway kids with the promise of a free meal and a place to stay. Damian discovers the man to be a close associate of Victor Zsasz and that Zsasz has been slowly building a financial empire using runaway children and kidnapped orphans in a &#x27;fight to the death&#x27; arena where people bet on the winners. The winning child faces a new contestant, and so on, until the last child left fights Zsasz one-on-one, with the promise of freedom for winning (with it clearly evident none have won thus far). Having seen the horrors that Zsasz has left, as well as a haunting memory of seeing the dead bodies of the children he killed, Damian questions why Bruce or Dick have allowed a man like Zsasz to be left alive, despite their moral code against murder. Damian manages to subdue Victor and attack him viciously with a sword, after which he falls into Gotham Harbor. Not wanting to defy his mentor and late father&#x27;s beliefs, he promises Dick that the blow was not fatal since he &quot;missed Zsasz&#x27;s spine&quot;, but indicated that his chances of survival were slim.

Zsasz is later seen in captivity in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #865, after Black Mask&#x27;s (Jeremiah Arkham) apprehension, in Arkham Asylum. While no reference is made to Zsasz&#x27;s injury (nor does he appear to be injured), his presence in Arkham alongside Jeremiah strongly suggests the events of this issue take place subsequent to the injury, meaning he did survive the attack.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
Zsasz has appeared various times in &quot;The New 52&quot; (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe) as an inmate of Arkham, and he is later seen attacking Batgirl in the Narrows, while on Venom. Zsasz next appears in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (vol. 2) #18 written by John Layman. He is released from Arkham Asylum by the Joker prior to the events of &quot;Death of the Family&quot;. Later, he is hired by Ignatius Ogilvy, the Emperor Penguin, to &quot;leave [his] mark on Gotham City&quot;; he is given a knife with the Emperor Penguin&#x27;s insignia on it. Zsasz is later instructed to put the Man-Bat serum on the knife, as part of the Emperor Penguin&#x27;s plan to turn the population of Gotham City into Man-Bats through an airborne virus. Zsasz is temporarily transformed into one. During the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; storyline, Nightwing had just retrieved Victor Zsasz from Chicago and was bringing him back to Arkham Asylum. Victor Zsasz was then abducted by Superwoman and Owlman.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===
In the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; reboot, Batman and Duke Thomas investigate a series of murders linked to Zsasz.
Flashbacks to the 2017 story arc &quot;The War of Jokes and Riddles&quot; reveals that Zsasz sided with the Riddler in a war against the Joker He briefly joins a gang of villains assembled by Killer Moth. In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, Zsasz appears as an inmate of Arkham Asylum.

===&quot;All In&quot;===
Victor Zsasz considers his victims, male and female, to be his betrothed. He not only makes a cut in his own skin, but makes one in the skin of each victim as well, as if exchanging rings, &quot;marrying&quot; them in heavenly matrimony by the blade. He finds this romantic, and continues to &quot;speak&quot; to his dead &quot;spouses&quot; through the scars.

==Powers and abilities==
In addition to his wiry-yet-tall physique, Zsasz is extremely agile and flexible, able to go toe-to-toe with even Batman for brief bouts. Though he favors slitting his victims&#x27; throats with knives, he has no reservations about tossing blades at opponents if the occasion calls for it, and even carries several spare knives for this purpose. Though he personally dislikes guns, considering them &quot;unreliable&quot;, Zsasz is known to occasionally carry firearms to coerce his selected victims. Even barehanded, Zsasz is a formidable opponent; as he is locked away in an enormous steel containment unit for 16 hours a day, he has made a habit of practicing isometrics in the cramped space to strengthen his body.

Zsasz is incredibly intelligent and is described as having &quot;a brilliant criminal mind&quot;. He is constantly thinking quickly both while incarcerated and active, and some of his escapes have been a result of his cunning schemes. Zsasz is completely unpredictable, having no qualms about who he kills, when and where. Thus, he is almost impossible to track, even if signs of his &quot;modus operandi&quot; appear evident, as there is no motive or clue trail to follow. Such unpredictability also renders him a danger to anyone and everyone who may encounter him.

During the &quot;Streets of Gotham&quot; story arc, it is learned that Zsasz sees the world as bathed in red, and everyone in it as a victim he has murdered. He envisions both friend (Black Mask) and foe (Dick Grayson) as having died at his hand with their throats slashed. During his battle with Damian, Zsasz begins to lose his composure when he begins to see him as a living human being rather than as a dead body.

<doc id="914441" wikidata="Q2468873" url="?curid=914441" title="Feyd-Rautha">
<text>Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen is a fictional character in the 1965 science fiction novel &quot;Dune&quot; by Frank Herbert. He is the younger nephew and heir of the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, and is depicted as being cruel, treacherous and cunning, though not as much so as his uncle.

Feyd is portrayed by Sting in the 1984 film &quot;Dune&quot;, by Matt Keeslar in the 2000 miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot;, and by Austin Butler in the 2024 film &quot;&quot;.

==Description==
Sixteen-year-old Feyd, the younger nephew and heir of Baron Harkonnen, is described as dark haired, and &quot;round of face and with sullen eyes&quot;. He is lean and muscular in contrast to his morbidly obese uncle, and is a deadly fighter. The Baron also notes that the &quot;full and pouting look&quot; of Feyd&#x27;s lips is &quot;the Harkonnen genetic marker&quot;. Feyd and his elder brother Glossu Rabban are the legal sons of Baron Harkonnen&#x27;s youngest half-brother, Abulurd Rabban, who had &quot;renounced the Harkonnen name and all rights to the title when given the subdistrict governorship of Rabban-Lankiveil&quot;.

The character Feyd serves as a narrative foil to Paul Atreides, son of the Baron&#x27;s enemy, Duke Leto Atreides. Ari Szporn of &quot;Comic Book Resources&quot; wrote, &quot;Both [Paul and Feyd] are charismatic, cunning young noblemen who have received the greatest education and combat training. But where Paul displays compassion and loyalty, Feyd cares only for himself and the acquisition of power.&quot;

==Appearances==

===&quot;Dune&quot;===
As &quot;Dune&quot; begins, Feyd-Rautha figures heavily in the Baron&#x27;s plans to gain power for House Harkonnen. The Baron favors the handsome and charismatic Feyd over Feyd&#x27;s older brother Glossu Rabban (&quot;The Beast&quot;) because of Feyd&#x27;s intelligence and his dedication to the Harkonnen culture of carefully planned and subtly executed sadism and cruelty, as opposed to Rabban&#x27;s outright brutality.
Feyd is, for a while, the Baron&#x27;s heir, or na-Baron. To assure Feyd&#x27;s power, the Baron intends to install him as ruler of Arrakis after a period of tyrannical misrule by Rabban, making Feyd appear to be the savior of the people.

Feyd, like Paul Atreides, is also the product of a centuries-long breeding program organized by the Bene Gesserit, who planned their own alliance by joining a Harkonnen son to an Atreides daughter with the expectation that their offspring would have a high probability of being their hoped-for Kwisatz Haderach. For this reason, Lady Jessica&#x27;s decision to defy the Sisterhood and to produce an Atreides son, Paul, threw the Bene Gesserit&#x27;s plans into turmoil and established an irreconcilable tension between Feyd and Paul as the scions of their bitterly opposed noble houses. The risk of one or both of these young men being killed, destroying thousands of years of genetic engineering, is so great that the Bene Gesserit send an envoy, Margot Fenring, to seduce Feyd and conceive a child, salvaging his genetic material.

Margot also intends to &quot;plant deep in his deepest self the necessary &quot;prana-bindu&quot; phrases to bend him,&quot; which she later refers to as the &quot;hypno- of that Feyd-Rautha&#x27;s psyche.&quot; Presumably he is thus &quot;prepared&quot; and made vulnerable to a command which will cause complete muscle paralysis, a technique the Bene Gesserit sometimes use on individuals who are considered highly dangerous. It is also later noted by the Reverend Mother Mohiam that Feyd&#x27;s encounter with Lady Fenring produced a daughter.

Feyd&#x27;s ambition and impatience to inherit the Baron&#x27;s title and power spur him to attempt his uncle&#x27;s assassination. The attempt fails, prompting the Baron to reveal to his nephew the lofty plans he has for him, possibly to even have him ascend the throne as Emperor. The Baron explains that the elevation of House Harkonnen means more to him than power in his own lifetime, so if Feyd promises to forego any further assassination attempts, he will voluntarily step down and let his nephew succeed him—after his plot against the Emperor has succeeded. Feyd agrees, but as punishment for his assassination attempt, the Baron forces Feyd to single-handedly slaughter all the female slaves who serve as his lovers so that Feyd will learn the price of failure.

As Paul makes his final bid to usurp the Padishah Emperor&#x27;s power, he is challenged by Feyd, the current Harkonnen leader after the deaths of the Baron and Rabban. Though famed for his prowess in single combat, Feyd intends to guarantee victory by breaking the formal rules of kanly (which govern this type of challenge) and using a hidden poison spur in his fighting outfit. He nearly succeeds in killing Paul in the ritualized fight, as Paul struggles with whether to try the paralysis word-sound given to him by his mother, and owe the Bene Gesserit his victory, or to risk his life against Feyd in a &quot;fair&quot; fight. Paul manages to defeat Feyd without the command, killing him, and goes on to accede to the throne of the Emperor.

===&quot;Prelude to Dune&quot;===
In the &quot;Prelude to Dune&quot; prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson, it is established that Feyd had been born on the Harkonnen planet Lankiveil as the second son of Vladimir&#x27;s younger half-brother Abulurd Harkonnen and his wife Emmi. The Bene Gesserit, desiring a son by Abulurd for their breeding program but finding Glossu unacceptable, secretly administer fertility drugs to an aging Emmi, who soon conceives Feyd.

Named after his maternal grandfather, Rautha Rabban, who had been murdered by Glossu, Feyd becomes honorable Abulurd&#x27;s hope for a son who would not have to inherit the dishonor of the name Harkonnen, and a worthy heir in comparison to his older, murderous son, Glossu. The Baron decides to take the infant Feyd from his father to raise on the Harkonnen homeworld Giedi Prime as another possible heir for himself, and as punishment for Abulurd&#x27;s attempts to sever all his ties to House Harkonnen. In time, the Baron comes to favor Feyd over Glossu.

===&quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot;===
In &quot;Sandworms of Dune&quot; (2007), the second of Brian Herbert and Kevin J. Anderson&#x27;s two-part finale to the original &quot;Dune&quot; series, a ghola of Paul Atreides is created over 5,000 years after the original&#x27;s death. Once his memories are restored, Paul recalls that after his ascension to the Imperial throne (between the novels &quot;Dune&quot; and 1969&#x27;s &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;) he &quot;had not been able to escape political struggles, assassination attempts, the exiled Emperor Shaddam&#x27;s bid for power and the pretender daughter of Feyd-Rautha and Lady Fenring ...&quot;

==In adaptations==
Director Alejandro Jodorowsky intended Mick Jagger to play Feyd in his planned 1970s film adaptation of &quot;Dune&quot;, which was never made.

Feyd is portrayed by Sting in the 1984 David Lynch film &quot;Dune&quot;, Brigid Brown of BBC America called Sting a &quot;scene-stealer&quot; in the film.

Matt Keeslar played the character in the 2000 miniseries &quot;Frank Herbert&#x27;s Dune&quot;. Emmet Asher-Perrin of &quot;Tor.com&quot; called his portrayal &quot;the strangest casting choice you&#x27;ve ever seen,&quot; adding that &quot;it&#x27;s also hard not to love the strangeness of it.&quot;

Feyd does not appear in the 2021 film &quot;Dune&quot;, which covers the first part of the book, but director Denis Villeneuve subsequently confirmed that the character would appear in the 2024 sequel film &quot;&quot;. Austin Butler entered negotiations to join the cast as Feyd in March 2022, and his casting was confirmed in May 2022. Butler has been praised for the role, and Brooks Vernon of &quot;Screen Rant&quot; wrote, &quot;The performance was memorably psychotic, and there is a high level of physicality and charisma in it that helps Austin Butler play well onscreen against Timothée Chalamet [as Paul Atreides].&quot;

Feyd, based on his appearance in &quot;Dune: Part Two&quot;, appears alongside Paul Atreides as a playable character in &quot;Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III&quot; and &quot;Call of Duty: Warzone 2.0&quot;.

==Merchandising==
A line of &quot;Dune&quot; action figures from toy company LJN was released to lackluster sales in 1984. Styled after David Lynch&#x27;s film, the collection featured a figure of Feyd as well as other characters. In October 2019, Funko announced a &quot;&quot;Dune&quot; Classic&quot; line of POP! vinyl figures, one of which was Feyd in a blue jumpsuit, styled after Lynch&#x27;s film. An alternate version of Feyd in his blue loincloth was released for the 2019 New York Comic Con.

<doc id="914451" wikidata="Q13582510" url="?curid=914451" title="Herman Moore">
<text>Herman Joseph Moore (born October 20, 1969) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in National Football League (NFL) for 12 seasons. He played college football for the Virginia Cavaliers and was selected by the Detroit Lions in the first round of the 1991 NFL draft, and also played for the New York Giants.

==Early life==
Moore graduated from George Washington High School in Danville, Virginia, in 1987. Moore was a three-sport athlete, excelling in basketball, football, and track and field.

==College career==
Moore attended and graduated from the University of Virginia, where he was a two-sport athlete. He ranks third all-time in career receptions, behind Olamide Zaccheaus and Billy McMullen, and held the school record in the high jump for 30 years until it was broken in 2020. Moore&#x27;s college jersey number was 87.

He ranks second in Cavaliers history in career receiving yards with 2,504 and ranks first in receiving yards in a season with 1,190 yards (on 54 catches) set in 1990. The year before he had 848 yards on just 36 catches. He also scored 10 touchdowns in 1989 and followed that up with 13 in 1990.

==Professional career==

Moore was the Detroit Lions&#x27; first-round draft pick in 1991 and went on to shatter virtually all of Detroit&#x27;s receiving records.

Moore started his career in 1991 with limited time, as he caught just eleven passes for 135 yards; he had apparently neglected to tell the Lions that he had worn contact lenses while in college to see, for which he had decided to not wear in the pros. At any rate, an eye check helped reveal the problem, which was soon fixed. He eventually became a key part of the team&#x27;s run to the playoffs, as the Lions won the NFC Central title for the first time since 1983. In the divisional-round game against the Dallas Cowboys, Moore caught six passes for 87 yards with a touchdown (thrown by Erik Kramer) as the Lions prevailed 38–6 to win their first playoff game since 1957. In the NFC Championship Game against Washington, he caught four passes for 69 yards in the 41–10 loss.

He started the first week of the subsequent season and caught eight passes for 82 yards before being put on injured reserve for the next four weeks. In his return against the Minnesota Vikings, he caught his first regular season touchdown pass, doing so in the fourth quarter from Erik Kramer in a 31–14 loss. He caught 51 passes for 966 yards with four touchdowns in twelve games. The next year, he caught 61 passes in 15 games with 935 yards and six touchdowns as the Lions won the NFC Central once again. In the Wild Card game, he caught one pass for 20 yards in the loss.

He fully stepped into well-done play in 1994, as he was named to his first Pro Bowl. Playing in all sixteen games, he caught 72 passes for 1,173 yards for eleven touchdowns. He elevated his play even further the next year, which included being named the team MVP on offense. He set a new league record for receptions in a season with 123 while setting a club record in receiving yards with 1,686, scoring 14 touchdowns. In the October 29 game, he caught three touchdown passes in a game against the Green Bay Packers. It was the last time for a decade that a receiver from the Lions would do so (Roy Williams was the next receiver to do so). That same year, Moore had one of his most memorable games on November 23 (Thanksgiving Day) against the Minnesota Vikings. Moore (127 yards) and fellow receivers Brett Perriman (153) and Johnnie Morton (102) all eclipsed the 100-yard receiving mark, running back Barry Sanders rushed for 138 yards, and quarterback Scott Mitchell passed for 410 yards in a 44-38 Lions&#x27; victory. His finest single-game performance came on December 4, 1995, against the Chicago Bears when he had a club record 14 catches for 183 yards, the fifth best total in Detroit history. He was named to the Pro Bowl for the second straight year while the Lions made it to the playoffs for the fourth time in five seasons. Moore and teammate Brett Perriman (108 catches) became the first teammates in NFL history with more than 100 receptions in the same season. Moore continued his run in 1996 with 106 catches for 1,296 yards with nine touchdowns. He then became the second receiver (after Jerry Rice) to have three 100-reception seasons, as he led the league with 104 receptions for 1,293 yards and eight touchdowns. He was named to the Pro Bowl for the fourth straight time with a third consecutive All-Pro selection while the Lions made the playoffs after a two-year hiatus. However, the Lions would lose a chaotic playoff game to the Philadelphia Eagles, with Moore catching seven passes for 133 yards for a touchdown (his second and last career touchdown in the postseason) in the 58–37 loss.

The next three years were not as positive for Moore. He regressed to 82 catches for 983 yards with five touchdowns in 1998, the last season with Barry Sanders on the roster. 1999 was the sixth playoff season for the Lions in the decade, but it did not result in good fortune. Moore played just eight games while catching sixteen passes for 197 yards with two touchdowns. In the Wild Card game that year, he caught three passes for 69 yards. After playing three games for the Lions in 2001 with just four catches (to total 145 games played with Detroit), he moved to the New York Giants for the following year. He was inactive for two of the three games on the Giants roster before being let go.

In 12 NFL seasons, Moore had 670 receptions for 9,174 yards and 62 touchdowns. Moore holds NFL records for both receptions (61) and receiving yards (965) on Thursday games (helped by playing for the Lions, a perpetual team on Thanksgiving Day; his efforts in the 1998 game resulted in the inaugural All-Iron Award being awarded to him). He held Detroit&#x27;s records for career receptions (670) until it was surpassed by Calvin Johnson in the fifth week of the 2015 NFL season. On November 10, 2013, his touchdown catch record of 62 was surpassed by Johnson at Chicago. On December 8, 2013, Johnson also broke his career receiving yards record of 9,174. In 2010, Moore was inducted into the Virginia Sports Hall of Fame and the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame that same year.

<text>Oswald Q. Ostrich, better known simply as Ossie Ostrich, is an Australian television puppet character in the form of a pink ostrich, created, performed and voiced by Ernie Carroll who appeared firstly on the &quot;Tarax Show&quot;, and then opposite Daryl Somers as the co-host on the long-running Nine Network program &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; which started as a Saturday morning cartoon show for children in 1971. In 1984, he also hosted an after-school children&#x27;s show called &quot;The Ossie Ostrich Video Show&quot;, with co-host Jacki MacDonald.
Ossie is a good-natured pink ostrich sporting a light blue mohawk hairstyle.

==Origins==
Ossie Ostrich was designed and made by Werner Axelrad of Lamont Puppets for &quot;The Tarax Show&quot;.

In late 1971, when VFL footballer Peter McKenna was forced to leave &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot;, which he had been co-hosting with Daryl Somers, Ernie Carroll resurrected the puppet which had been &quot;packed away in a dusty suitcase in the GTV props bay&quot; to be Somers&#x27; sidekick. Carroll, a veteran of Australian television since it began in 1956, had worked both in children&#x27;s television and adult comedy programs such as &quot;In Melbourne Tonight&quot;. He operated Ossie for the next 23 years.

Typically, Ossie would provide the comic foil to Somers&#x27; straight man. Somers sometimes retaliated by calling Ossie names like &#x27;Fiberglass Head&#x27;, but he also had more affectionate names, like his &#x27;pink, feathered &#x27;. The comic skill of Somers and Carroll was instrumental in leading to the wider appeal of the show and its move to a prime time spot on Saturday evening.

According to &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday The Book&quot;:

Ossie Ostrich stepped out of the case and, as if under the control of a superior being, walked to the host set and looked directly into the left eye of Daryl Somers. &quot;Well, I never!&quot; said Daryl. &quot;Oh you must have,&quot; said Ossie. And a link was formed that could only be broken by money. People who actually witnessed that moment say that a spark of electricity seemed to pass between the two. When asked, Daryl said he was not sure but Ossie distinctly remembers passing something.

Ossie was not a part of &quot;Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday&quot; for the entirety of its 28-year run – indeed his retirement in 1994 was arguably a key factor in the demise of the show – but he was one of the most recognisable puppets in Australia for more than two decades. He did however return briefly for the second &quot;Hey Hey&quot; reunions as a special guest. Ossie also appeared alongside Somers in the 2010 revival of the series on a regular basis. 

Over time, Ossie&#x27;s head had to be replaced due to mishaps. Lipstick marks from over-amorous admirers were very difficult to remove. Other members of Ossie&#x27;s family were represented using the same puppet with different accessories.

On the &quot;Tarax Show&quot;, Ossie&#x27;s theme song was &quot;Here comes Ossie Ostrich&quot;. This was also occasionally heard on &quot;Hey Hey&quot;. According to the closing credits of Hey Hey It&#x27;s Saturday, Ossie Ostrich is a copyright of Media Features Services.

==Merchandising ==
Merchandise included a plush toy version of Ossie and a marionette puppet, as well as comic books. &quot;TV Week&quot; carried an Ossie Ostrich comic strip, written and illustrated by Carroll, and these were collected in book form.

<doc id="914456" wikidata="Q1218921" url="?curid=914456" title="The Last Five Years">
<text>The Last Five Years is a musical written by Jason Robert Brown. It premiered at Chicago&#x27;s Northlight Theatre in 2001 and was then produced Off-Broadway in March 2002. Since then it has had numerous productions both in the United States and internationally.

The story explores a five-year relationship between Jamie Wellerstein, a rising novelist, and Cathy Hiatt, a struggling actress. The show uses a form of storytelling in which Jamie&#x27;s story is told in chronological order (starting just after the couple have first met) and Cathy&#x27;s story is told in reverse chronological order (beginning the show at the end of the marriage). The characters do not directly interact except for a wedding song in the middle as their timelines intersect.

In 2014, a film adaptation directed by Richard LaGravenese starring Anna Kendrick and Jeremy Jordan was released.

==Background==
&quot;The Last Five Years&quot; was inspired by Brown&#x27;s failed marriage to Theresa O&#x27;Neill. O&#x27;Neill sued Brown on the grounds that the story of the musical violated non-disparagement and non-disclosure agreements within their divorce decree by representing her relationship with Brown too closely. Brown, in turn, sued O&#x27;Neill for interfering with his creative work and his creative process. As part of the legal settlement for both suits, Brown removed all references to Cathy being Irish Catholic, and changed the song &quot;I Could Be in Love With Someone Like You&quot; to &quot;Shiksa Goddess&quot; in order to reduce the similarity between the character and O&#x27;Neill.

==Synopsis==
Cathy is sitting alone lamenting the end of her marriage (&quot;Still Hurting&quot;). We shift to meet Jamie. It is five years earlier and he has just met Cathy. Jamie is overjoyed to be dating outside his Jewish heritage (&quot;Shiksa Goddess&quot;).

Cathy and Jamie are in Ohio but not together. It is her birthday and he has come to visit her as she works in a show there (&quot;See I&#x27;m Smiling&quot;). She is anxious to fix any problems in their marriage but she becomes angry when Jamie tells her he has to go back early to New York. During breaks in the music, we see a younger Jamie, talking to a literary agent about his book.

Jamie is moving in with Cathy. He comments on how lucky he is that everything is going right for him; his book is being published and his life with Cathy seems too good to be true (&quot;Moving Too Fast&quot;). Elsewhere an older Cathy is making a call to her agent: it seems her career isn&#x27;t going the way she planned it.

Cathy is attending Jamie&#x27;s book party. She sings about how he ignores her for his writing but she will always be in love with him (&quot;I&#x27;m a Part of That&quot;).

Jamie and Cathy celebrate their second Christmas. He tells her a new story he has written about an old tailor named Schmuel and he gives her a Christmas present: a watch, promising to support her as she follows her dreams of acting. (&quot;The Schmuel Song&quot;).

Cathy is in Ohio and writing to Jamie. She describes to Jamie her disappointing life in Ohio among her eccentric colleagues (&quot;A Summer in Ohio&quot;).

Jamie is sitting with Cathy in Central Park. Jamie proposes to her and, for the first time in the musical, they sing together (&quot;The Next Ten Minutes&quot;). They get married, exchanging vows to stay together forever.

Jamie is facing temptation from other women, especially now his career as a writer has escalated (&quot;A Miracle Would Happen&quot;). Cathy, meanwhile, is auditioning for a role (&quot;When You Come Home to Me&quot;). She is getting down about the rejection she faces as an actress and complains to Jamie (&quot;Climbing Uphill&quot;).

Jamie speaks to Cathy on the phone, trying to convince her that there is nothing going on with him and his editor, Elise. He wants to celebrate a book review but Cathy refuses to go out.

Jamie is fighting with Cathy, trying to get her to listen to him. He accuses her of being unsupportive of his career just because hers is failing. Though his words are harsh, he promises her that he believes in her (&quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Believe in You&quot;).

A younger Cathy is in the car with Jamie, who is going to meet her parents. She tells him about her past relationships and hopes not to end up in a small town life like her friend from high school (&quot;I Can Do Better Than That&quot;). She asks Jamie to move in with her.

Near the end of the relationship Jamie wakes up beside another woman (&quot;Nobody Needs to Know&quot;). He tries to defend his actions and blames Cathy for destroying his privacy and their relationship. Jamie promises not to lie to this woman and tells her that &quot;I could be in love with someone like you,&quot; just as he does to Cathy in &quot;Shiksa Goddess&quot;.

Cathy is ecstatic after her first date with Jamie. She sings goodbye (&quot;Goodbye Until Tomorrow&quot;). She proclaims that she has been waiting for Jamie her whole life. Simultaneously but five years forward, Jamie sits in their shared apartment writing laments over the relationship (&quot;I Could Never Rescue You&quot;). As Cathy waves Jamie &quot;goodbye until tomorrow&quot;, Jamie wishes Cathy simply &quot;goodbye&quot;.

==Music==

The musical style draws on a number of musical genres, including pop, jazz, classical, Klezmer, Latin, Blues, Rock, and Folk. The orchestration consists of piano, acoustic guitar, fretless bass, two cellos, one doubling on celesta and tubular bell, and violin, doubling cymbal.

The 2016 production was headlined by Jonathan Bailey as Jamie and Samantha Barks as Cathy at St. James Theatre, with direction by Brown himself. &quot;The Stage&quot;″s Mark Shenton called the production &quot;poignant&quot; turning &quot;each song into a masterclass of storytelling&quot; with Bailey &quot;a real vocal surprise with his haunting renditions of &#x27;If I Didn&#x27;t Believe in You&#x27; and &#x27;Nobody Needs to Know&#x27;.&quot; Edward Seckerson of The Arts Desk called the production a &quot;knockout&quot; and a &quot;two-handed tour-de-force&quot; in his five-star review.

It won the WhatsOnStage Award for Best Off-West End Production in 2017. A video of Bailey&#x27;s audition singing &quot;If I Didn&#x27;t Believe In You&quot; was uploaded on YouTube in 2017, and has since gone viral.

<text>An engine-indicating and crew-alerting system (EICAS) is an integrated system used in modern aircraft to provide aircraft flight crew with instrumentation and crew annunciations for aircraft engines and other systems. On EICAS equipped aircraft the &quot;recommended remedial action&quot; is called a checklist.

==Components==

EICAS typically includes instrumentation of various engine parameters, including for example speed of rotation, temperature values including exhaust gas temperature, fuel flow and quantity, oil pressure etc. Other aircraft systems typically monitored by EICAS are for example hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, deicing, environmental and control surface systems. EICAS has high connectivity &amp; provides data acquisition and routing.

EICAS is a key function of a glass cockpit system, which replaces all analog gauges with software-driven electronic displays. Most of the display area is used for navigation and orientation displays, but one display or a section of a display is set aside specifically for EICAS.

The crew-alerting system (CAS) is used in place of the annunciator panel on older systems. Rather than signaling a system failure by turning on a light behind a translucent button, failures are shown as a list of messages in a small window near the other EICAS indications.

==Alternative systems==
Some alternatives are:

* Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor (ECAM) on Airbus
* &quot;Centralized Fault Detection System&quot; (CFDS) on McDonnell Douglas
* &quot;Flight Warning System&quot; (FWS) on Fokker
* &quot;Engine Warning Display&quot; (EWD) on ATR
* Комплексная система электронной индикации и сигнализации (КСЭИС) on Antonov.

== Presence ==
The system is called EICAS at least on the following aircraft:

=== Jetliners ===
The first Boeing airliner with EICAS was the Boeing 757. The Boeing 747 has EICAS since the 747-400. No version of the Boeing 737 has EICAS. The Boeing 717 has CFDS, as it was originally a McDonnell Douglas product.

The Embraer ERJ family and the Embraer E-Jet family have EICAS.

The Bombardier CRJ and the Bombardier CSeries have EICAS.

The Fairchild-Dornier 328JET has EICAS.

The COMAC ARJ21 and the COMAC C919 have EICAS.

=== Turboprop airliners ===
The Saab 2000 has EICAS.

The Dornier 328 and the Dornier 228NG have EICAS.

The Xi&#x27;an MA60 and the Xi&#x27;an MA600 have EICAS.

== Limitations ==
On some Bombardier aircraft, it is possible to call up the wrong checklist. Messages forbidding take-off can be shown as advisories.

The 757, 767, and 747-400 have no electronic checklists.

The ERJ and the E-Jets have no electronic checklists.

The CRJ have no electronic checklists.

The Do-328 and the Do-328JET have no electronic checklists.

The Saab 2000 has no electronic checklists.

<doc id="914475" wikidata="Q1062302" url="?curid=914475" title="Channeled Scablands">
<text>The Channeled Scablands are a relatively barren and soil-free region of interconnected relict and dry flood channels, coulees and cataracts eroded into Palouse loess and the typically flat-lying basalt flows that remain after cataclysmic floods within the southeastern part of Washington state. The Channeled Scablands were scoured by more than 40 cataclysmic floods during the Last Glacial Maximum and innumerable older cataclysmic floods over the last two million years. These floods were periodically unleashed whenever a large glacial lake broke through its ice dam and swept across eastern Washington and down the Columbia River Plateau during the Pleistocene epoch. The last of the cataclysmic floods occurred between 18,200 and 14,000 years ago.

Geologist J Harlen Bretz defined &quot;scablands&quot; in a series of papers written in the 1920s as lowlands diversified by a multiplicity of irregular channels and rock basins eroded into basalt. Flood waters eroded the loess cover, creating large anastomizing channels that exposed bare basalt and creating butte-and-basin topography. The buttes range in height from , while the rock basins range from in width up to the long and 30 m deep Rock Lake. Bretz further stated, &quot;The channels run uphill and downhill, they unite and they divide, they head on the back-slopes and cut through the summit; they could not be more erratically and impossibly designed.&quot;

The debate on the origin of the Scablands that ensued for four decades became one of the great controversies in the history of earth science. The Scablands are also important to planetary scientists as perhaps the best terrestrial analog of the Martian outflow channels.

==History==

Bretz conducted research and published many papers during the 1920s describing the Channeled Scablands. His theories of how they were formed required short but immense floodsfor which Bretz had no explanation. His theories of apparent catastrophism met with vehement opposition from geologists of the day, who tried to explain the features with uniformitarian theoriesthat they were shaped by processes still acting today.

J. T. Pardee first suggested in 1925 to Bretz that the draining of a glacial lake could account for flows of the magnitude needed. Pardee continued his research over the next 30 years, collecting and analyzing evidence that eventually identified Lake Missoula as the source of the floods (now the Missoula floods) and creator of the Channeled Scablands.

Pardee&#x27;s and Bretz&#x27;s theories were accepted only after decades of painstaking work and fierce scientific debate. Research on open-channel hydraulics in the 1970s put Bretz&#x27;s theories on solid scientific ground. In 1979 Bretz received the highest medal of the Geological Society of America, the Penrose Medal, to recognize that he had developed one of the great ideas in the earth sciences.

==Geology==

Distinct geomorphological features include coulees, dry falls, streamlined hills and islands of remnant loess, gravel fans and bars, and giant current ripples.

The term scabland refers to an area that has experienced fluvial erosion resulting in the loss of loess and other soils, leaving the land barren. River valleys formed by erosional downcutting of rivers create V-shaped valleys, while glaciers carve out U-shaped valleys. The Channeled Scablands have a rectangular cross section, with flat plateaus and steep canyon sides, and are spread over immense areas of eastern Washington. The morphology of the scablands is butte-and-basin. The area that encompasses the Scablands has been estimated between , though those estimates still may be too conservative.

They exhibit a unique drainage pattern that appears to have an entrance in the northeast and an exit in the southwest. The Cordilleran ice sheet dammed up Glacial Lake Missoula at the Purcell Trench Lobe. A series of floods occurring over the period of 18,000 to 13,000 years ago swept over the landscape when the ice dam broke. The eroded channels also show an anastomosing, or braided, appearance.

The presence of Middle and Early Pleistocene Missoula flood deposits have been documented within the Channeled Scabland as other parts of the Columbia Basin, e.g. the Othello Channels, Columbia River Gorge, Quincy Basin, Pasco Basin, and the Walla Walla Valley. Based on the presence of multiple interglacial calcretes interbedded with glaciofluvial flood deposits, magnetostratigraphy, optically stimulated luminescence dating, and unconformity truncated clastic dikes, it has been estimated that the oldest of these megafloods flowed through the Channel Scablands sometime before 1.5 million years ago. Because of the fragmentary nature of older glaciofluvial deposits, which have been largely removed by subsequent Missoula floods, the exact number of older Missoula floods, which are known as &quot;Ancient Cataclysmic Floods&quot;, that occurred during the Pleistocene cannot be estimated with any confidence. As many as 100 separate, cataclysmic Ice Age floods may have occurred during the last glaciation. There have been at least 17 complete interglacial-glacial cycles since about 1.77 million years ago, and perhaps as many as 44 interglacial-glacial cycles since the beginning of the Pleistocene about 2.58 million years ago. Presuming a dozen (or more) floods were associated with each glaciation, the total number of cataclysmic Ice Age Missoula floods that flowed through the Channeled Scablands for the entire Pleistocene Epoch could possibly number in the hundreds, perhaps exceeding a thousand Ancient Cataclysmic Floods.

There are also immense potholes and ripple marks, much larger than those found on ordinary rivers. When these features were first studied, no known theories could explain their origin. The giant current ripples are between high and are regularly spaced, relatively uniform hills. Vast volumes of flowing water would be required to produce ripple marks of this magnitude, as they are larger-scale versions of the ripple marks found on streambeds that are typically only centimeters high. Large potholes were formed by swirling vortexes of water called kolks scouring and plucking out the bedrock.

The Scablands are littered with large boulders called glacial erratics that rafted on glaciers and were deposited by the glacial outburst flooding. The lithology of erratics usually does not match the rock type that surrounds it, as they are often carried very far from their origin.

<text>Antoine and Colette () is a 1962 French short film written and directed by François Truffaut. It is the second installment in Truffaut&#x27;s five-film series about Antoine Doinel, the character he follows from boyhood to adulthood. &quot;Antoine and Colette&quot; was made for the 1962 anthology collection &quot;Love at Twenty&quot;, which also featured shorts from directors Shintarô Ishihara, Marcel Ophüls, Renzo Rossellini and Andrzej Wajda.

Antoine Doinel—and Jean-Pierre Léaud, the actor who played him in all five films—had made his screen debut in 1959 with Truffaut&#x27;s first film, &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;. Truffaut&#x27;s tender, semi-autobiographical film about the young Antoine and his gradual descent into petty crime had introduced the world to the French New Wave, a short-lived but highly influential outpouring of work from young filmmakers such as Jean-Luc Godard, Claude Chabrol and Éric Rohmer.

==Plot==
&quot;Antoine and Colette&quot; catches up with Antoine as a solitary 20-year-old who works at Philips manufacturing LPs to support himself. He lives in a furnished room by himself in Place Clichy, listening to opera and classical music and spending time with René (Patrick Auffay), his school friend from &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;.

One day, while attending a Berlioz Music Programme with René, he spots Colette (Marie-France Pisier), a secondary school student, and falls in love for the first time.

Colette is his own age, but unlike Antoine has a warm, supportive family with whom she still lives. Antoine forms a strong friendship with Colette and, eventually, also her parents who begin to treat him as if he were a part of their family.

Colette&#x27;s feelings for Antoine are at first ambiguous and, harbouring some hope that she might grow to return them, he leaves his apartment at the Place Clichy and moves into an apartment across the road from her family&#x27;s. Although she continues to treat him kindly, it slowly becomes apparent that she is not interested in him romantically. He sulks about this and at first refuses to see her, but he is lured back by a dinner invitation. It is clear that her family still consider him a surrogate son and are possibly hoping for something romantic to happen between the two teenagers.

All of these hopes are dashed, however, when the pretty Colette is met at the front door by an older man. Her parents and Antoine look helplessly on as she disappears off with her date. They are all left to watch television.

Doinel&#x27;s adventures follow with &quot;Stolen Kisses&quot;, &quot;Bed and Board&quot; and &quot;Love on the Run&quot;.

==Cast==
* Jean-Pierre Léaud as Antoine Doinel
* Marie-France Pisier as Colette
* Patrick Auffay as René
* Rosy Varte as Colette&#x27;s mother
* François Darbon as Colette&#x27;s stepfather
* Jean-François Adam as Albert Tazzi
* Pierre Schaeffer as himself

==Development==
Truffaut had finished &quot;Jules and Jim&quot; in 1962 when he was approached by film producer Pierre Roustang for his omnibus film project &quot;Love at Twenty&quot;. Truffaut was influential in helping to select Shintarô Ishihara, Marcel Ophüls, Renzo Rossellini and Andrzej Wajda as the other directors who eventually participated in the project. In his book &quot;Truffaut on Truffaut&quot;, Truffaut later said &quot;For my part, the French episode gave me the occasion to realize a project I hadn&#x27;t dared to launch on my own, a short sequel to my first film, &quot;The 400 Blows&quot;, in which we would meet up with the young Antoine Doinel three years later having his first sentimental adventure, one that would illustrate the moral: you risk losing everything by wanting too much.&quot;

&quot;Antoine and Colette&quot; is a largely autobiographical work, based on 17-year-old Truffaut&#x27;s infatuation with an unconventional beauty named Liliane Litvin. Truffaut met Litvin at the Cinémathèque Française and quit his job as a welder and moved to Paris to be near her. Like Antoine, he took an apartment across the street from hers so that he could monitor her activities. However, she ultimately was not interested in him nor in any of his friends (she had attracted attention from Jean Gruault and Jean-Luc Godard).

<doc id="914480" wikidata="Q1565438" url="?curid=914480" title="Mexican hat dance">
<text>The Mexican hat dance, also known as Jarabe Tapatío, is the national dance of Mexico. It originated as a courtship dance in Guadalajara, Jalisco, during the 19th century, although its elements can be traced back to the Spanish &quot;zambra&quot; and &quot;jarabe gitano&quot;, which were popular during the times of the viceroyalty. Female dancers traditionally wear a &quot;china poblana&quot; outfit, while the male dancers dress as &quot;charros,&quot; and their steps are characterized by flirtatiously stepping around the brim of their partner&#x27;s hat.

The standard music of the &quot;jarabe tapatío&quot; was composed by Jesús González Rubio in the 19th century. However, its more common instrumental arrangement dates from the 1920s. Sometimes it is confused with La Raspa, another Mexican dance. Nowadays, its music is most commonly performed by either mariachi groups or string ensembles.

== History ==


The word &quot;jarabe&quot; (from Arabic &quot;xarab&quot;), meaning &quot;syrup&quot;, denotes the combination of various Mexican musics (&quot;sones&quot;) and dances (&quot;zapateados&quot;). The word &quot;Tapatío&quot; meaning &quot;someone or something from Guadalajara&quot; is the popular demonym of the city of Guadalajara in Jalisco province and reflects the origin of this particular &quot;jarabe&quot;. A number of other dances known as &quot;jarabes&quot; are known to have existed in the 18th and 19th centuries, such as the &quot;jarabe de Jalisco&quot;, the &quot;jarabe de atole&quot; and the &quot;jarabe moreliano&quot;, but the tapatío version is by far the best known. Most of these other jarabes differ from the tapatío in terms of their regional origin throughout Mexico. This is because overall, jarabe is considered much more of a musical and folk dance genre, as opposed to one rigid definition. There is some dispute as to the &quot;jarabe tapatío&quot;&#x27;s authenticity as folk dance. Music researcher Nicolás Puentes Macías from Zacatecas states that true &quot;jarabes&quot; are almost extinct in Mexico, found today only in small fractions of Zacatecas and Jalisco, and that the &quot;jarabe&quot; tapatío is really a form of a dance called &quot;tonadilla&quot;. In addition to this, the dance&#x27;s origins are also somewhat disputed, either being wholly indigenous or Hispanic in nature Some academics tend to stick to one narrative or the other, but across the board the dance is considered a truly Mestizo creation.

The earliest evidence of the dance comes from the late 18th century. It was originally danced by female couples in order to avoid the disapproval of the church. Shortly before the Mexican War of Independence, mixed couples began to perform it, with a public performance at the Coliseo Theater in 1790 in Mexico City. Shortly after that performance, the &quot;jarabe&quot; was banned by colonial and religious authorities &quot;under the severe penalties of excommunication, some ducats of penalty and lots of stripes, to any person that compose or sing or dance&quot; as it was considered to be morally offensive and a challenge to Spain&#x27;s control over the territory. However, this only served to make the dance more popular as a form of protest and rebellion, with people holding illegal dances in public squares and neighborhood festivals. It became symbolic of the Mexican peoples dissent.

Just after Independence, the &quot;jarabe&quot; and other dances grew and spread in popularity even more, with colonial-era restrictions lifted. After the exit of the Spanish colonial power, there was a sort of &quot;musical vacuum&quot; in the country, now without the overbearing presence of the &quot;superior&quot; Iberian musical styles. This left space for new forms of nationalistic music of Mexican creation to shine through and gain new popularity People celebrated the end of the war in 1821 with large fiestas, which prominently featured the &quot;jarabe&quot;. &quot;Jarabe&quot; and other folk dances came to be seen as part of Mexico&#x27;s emerging identity as a country. It became more than a dance, but a shining symbol of Mexican nationalism, coinciding perfectly with the new ruling governments push for a nationally cohesive and united mestizo population. The &quot;jarabe&quot; would maintain various regional forms, but that associated with Guadalajara gained national status, becoming not only popular in that city but also in Mexico City as well, as a dance for the elite around the 1860s. Around the same time, Guadalajara music professor Jesús González Rubio composed a standard melody for it as a symbol of national unity, leading the dance to become the &quot;national dance&quot; of Mexico and the melody to gain wide popular recognition. By the Mexican Revolution, it had become popular with the lower classes as well. It became internationally famous after Russian dancer Anna Pavlova added it to her permanent repertoire after visiting Mexico in 1919.

There are multiple instances of Jarabe tapatío performances in Mexican movies that help further show its impact on Mexican pop culture. Most Notably, Fernando de Fuentes&#x27;s 1936 Allá en el Rancho Grande (Over on the Big Ranch) features a musical number and dance scene where the actors perform the Jarabe tapatío. Camera angles throughout the performance showcase he dancers skill first off, but the delight, pleasure and astonishment in the crowd as they watch the nationalistic dance.

The &quot;jarabe&quot; remained in vogue in Mexico until about 1930, especially in Mexico City. It remains taught in nearly every grade school in Mexico.

== Performance ==
The dance represents the courtship of a man and a woman, with the woman first rejecting the man&#x27;s advances, then eventually accepting them. It has a definite sexual component in metaphor, which was the original reason for disapproval by authorities.

As the dance has lost its controversial status and gained status as a representative of Mexico, the dancers have come to wear garb that is also highly representative of Mexican women and men. For women, the most traditional outfit is called the &quot;China Poblana.&quot; The blouse and skirt combination is named after a woman from India who came to Mexico on the Manila Galleon to work as a servant in the early 19th century. Her Asian dress was copied and then adapted in the State of Puebla, with the skirt now heavily embroidered and otherwise decorated with patriotic images. The traditional outfit for men is that of the charro, generally heavily decorated in silver trim.

The music played to accompany the dance was written to be danced to and is played either by mariachi bands or by bands playing only string instruments such as various types of guitars, harps and violin.

== Contemporary adaptations ==
Within Mexican communities in the US, troops of &quot;Jarabe tapatío&quot; performers are becoming more and more common. Dancers are presented with opportunities to reconnect and engage with their Mexican heritage and/or citizenship abroad through the performance of the dance.

The popularity of the composition by Jesús González Rubio has led it to be used in many forms of media. For example, in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; TV series it is used to reference the Bumblebee Man, a stereotypical Mexican character. In the United Kingdom, the tune was used in adverts for Morrisons, primarily in the 1980s and 1990s, and some adverts in the mid-2000s. The supermarket&#x27;s slogan and jingle at that time, &#x27;More reasons to shop at Morrisons&#x27;, had its tune derived from the &quot;jarabe&quot;&#x27;s melody, which was used in all adverts in these eras. Morrisons revived the jingle and slogan in their advertising in summer 2023. The tune is also known to be popularly used for &quot;Yakko&#x27;s World&quot;, a song from Animaniacs in which the character list countries of the world from the early 1990s and as a polyphonic ringtone on Nokia mobile phones in the 1990s and 2000s

A &quot;jarabe&quot; also appears in Aaron Copland&#x27;s ballet &quot;Billy the Kid&quot;, played in time, the tune on a solo trumpet (with orchestral accompaniment).

<text>The Bahamas competed at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, from 13 to 29 August 2004. This was the nation&#x27;s fourteenth appearance at the Olympics, except the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow because of the United States boycott.

The Bahamas Olympic Association sent a total of 22 athletes, 13 men and 9 women, to compete only in athletics (the nation&#x27;s strongest field), swimming, and tennis. The Bahamian team featured numerous athletes who entered the Games as medal contenders in their respective events, including Tonique Williams-Darling, Chandra Sturrup, Debbie Ferguson, and Chris Brown. Sprinter Debbie Ferguson, who helped the Bahamian team claim their first gold medal in the women&#x27;s 4 × 100 m relay, was appointed by the association to carry the nation&#x27;s flag in the opening ceremony.

Bahamas left Athens with a total of two individual Olympic medals (a gold and a bronze), summing it up to a stark tally of eight with six more from Sydney. The highlight of the Games for the Bahamian athletes came with a prestigious Olympic gold from Tonique Williams-Darling in the women&#x27;s 400 metres on August 24, 2004. Meanwhile, Ferguson added a bronze to her career hardware in the women&#x27;s 200 metres by the following day. Being the oldest athlete to reach the final at age 28, she was quoted after the race as saying &quot;I think per capita, the Bahamas already won the Olympics&quot;, referring to the 2 medals won for the nation of approximately 325,000 people.

<text>The jarabe is one of the most traditional song forms of the mariachi genre. In the Spanish language, &quot;jarabe&quot; literally means &quot;syrup&quot;, which probably refers to the mixture of meters within one &quot;jarabe&quot; (compare &quot;salsa&quot;).

Typically, a jarabe will go from a to others sections with , , return to and end in another meter. The 6/8 rhythmic pattern is a constant pattern with no &quot;contratiempos&quot; as in the &quot;son jaliscience&quot;. Although today the &quot;jarabes&quot; are instrumental songs only, the &quot;jarabes&quot; originated as a medley of favorite regional &quot;sones&quot; and &quot;canciones&quot;. The regional nature of the &quot;jarabes&quot; are often visible in their name, e.g. &quot;Jarabe tapatío&quot; (&quot;Tapatío&quot; is something or someone from the city of Guadalajara, Jalisco). The &quot;jarabe&quot; is traditionally performed with dancers, and in its traditional form constituted a highly improvised choreographic tradition.
While most jarabes from Jalisco are not sung, those from Zacatecas do have verses. Many of these traditional jarabes from Zacatecas are being revived by the traditional group &quot;Los Jaraberos de Nochistlán&quot;.

Jarabe verses were a vehicle of popular resistance during the Mexican Revolution. While church and state decried them as immoral and subversive, and the accompanying dance as lascivious, the people felt the &quot;jarabe&quot; represented them and their political aspirations.

<text>Herbert Dorsey Levens (born May 21, 1970) is an American former professional football player who was a running back in the National Football League (NFL), primarily for the Green Bay Packers. He played college football for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and later the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets. Levens was selected by Green Bay in the fifth round of the 1994 NFL draft. He helped the Packers win the Vince Lombardi Trophy in Super Bowl XXXI against the New England Patriots.

In his career, Levens also played for the Philadelphia Eagles and New York Giants. While playing for the Packers, he rushed for 1,000 or more yards twice and was selected to the Pro Bowl after the 1997 season.

==Early life==
Levens was born in Syracuse, New York and first attended Nottingham High School, then Notre Dame. However, he found himself in competition with Ricky Watters, Jerome Bettis, Rodney Culver, Reggie Brooks, and Anthony Johnson, all of whom would play in the NFL, at running back. Levens eventually earned the starting spot, but injured his knee before the season started.

The next year, he transferred to Georgia Tech, where—after sitting out a year—he set a school record by averaging 7.2 yards-per-carry. In his senior season, he was voted First-team All-ACC. He rushed for 823 yards and scored eight touchdowns that season.

*1989 (Notre Dame): 25 carries for 132 yards and one touchdown. 3 catches for 27 yards.
*1990 (Notre Dame): 13 carries for 53 yards and 2 touchdowns. 1 catch for 20 yards.
*1992 (Georgia Tech): 55 carries for 213 yards and 2 touchdowns. 13 catches for 142 yards and one touchdown.
*1993 (Georgia Tech): 114 carries for 823 yards and 8 touchdowns. 8 catches for 134 yards and one touchdown.

==Professional career==
Due in part to his injury, Levens was considered to be a marginal pick in the 1994 NFL draft, and Mel Kiper Jr. labeled him the most overrated pick on the board. He was selected in the fifth round (149th overall) by the Green Bay Packers.

===Green Bay Packers===
In his first two seasons with the Packers, Levens was primarily used as a fullback, winning the starting job in 1995.

In 1996, he would play as back-up at halfback to starter Edgar Bennett, with William Henderson as the starter at fullback. In the 1996 NFC Championship game against the Carolina Panthers, Levens had a breakout game, carrying the ball 10 times for 88 yards and caught 5 passes for 117 yards and a touchdown in a 30–13 win. In Super Bowl XXXI, Levens was the Packers&#x27; leading rusher, carrying the ball 14 times for 61 yards, as the Packers won their first Super Bowl in 29 years, 35–21.

In 1997, Levens became the starting halfback after Edgar Bennett tore his achilles tendon in the 1997 pre-season. Levens rushed for over 1,400 yards and was voted to the Pro Bowl.

He broke his fibula during the 1998 season and was never the same. He was able to come back into the starting lineup late in the season, and showed some major flashes against the San Francisco 49ers in the Wild Card Round of the playoffs, rushing 27 times for 116 yards and a touchdown. 
He also caught 6 passes for 37 yards in a game that would later be dubbed The Catch II after Terrell Owens&#x27; last-second, game-winning touchdown catch.

He gained 1,034 yards for the Packers in the 1999 season, but suffered a pair of knee injuries during the 2000 season, and was mostly used in a reserve role after Ahman Green supplanted him as the starter.

During the final game of the 1999 NFL season, Levens and the Packers were involved in what has been described as a bizarre tie-breaking scenario, involving four teams that finished with 8–8 records fighting for two playoff spots. The two losers of the tie breaker would be eliminated. Going into their season finale against the Arizona Cardinals, the Packers needed to win their game, as well as have the Dallas Cowboys lose later that afternoon. In addition, the Packers also needed to win the net points scored tie-breaker vs. the Carolina Panthers (who were facing the New Orleans Saints). The Packers and Panthers were playing during the noon time slot and the Packers held a net 18 point advantage going into the day. As the games progressed, Carolina had built a sizable lead to the point that they were momentarily able to take the lead over the Packers in net points. Since both teams were neck and neck for the advantage in the tie breaker, both teams were frantically trying to score as many points as possible despite leading on the scoreboard by a blowout margin. The Cardinals and Saints also tried to score frantically as the game progressed to stop their opponents from gaining the net points advantage. Ultimately, the Packers prevailed in net points by +11. It was all for naught in the end, however, as the Cowboys won their afternoon contest against the New York Giants to claim the final playoff spot and thus eliminate the Packers from playoff contention. Levens ran for 146 yards and scored four times during the contest. The Packers won their game 49–24 and the Panthers won their game 45–13.

Levens was featured on the cover of EA Sports &quot;Madden NFL 2000&quot; in the PAL editions. As a result, he is viewed as one of the first victims of the &quot;Madden Curse&quot;.

Levens was released by the Packers after 2001. In 2009, he was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.

===Later career===
During the 2002 season, Levens played for the Philadelphia Eagles, replacing the injured Correll Buckhalter, and in 2003, with the New York Giants, both times as a backup. He was released by the Giants after 2003. After Buckhalter was again injured during the 2004 preseason, Levens was signed by the Eagles as a free agent. He shared duties with Brian Westbrook through the season, also appearing in Super Bowl XXXIX that year. He retired during the 2006 offseason as a Green Bay Packer.

==Retirement==
After retiring from the NFL, Levens became an NFL analyst for the sports website PlayerPress.com. There, he picks NFL games against the spread, and against other professional athletes and experts. He also became an analyst for Sprint Exclusive Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;NFL Mobile Gamecenter&quot;, where he breaks down all the NFL games for viewers each week. In 2009, Levens was elected to the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame.

In 2006, Levens had a cameo appearance as the head coach for Xavier in the film &quot;We Are Marshall&quot;.

In 2012, it was confirmed that Levens is to play the role of Coach James in Gridiron UK.

In 2015, Levens had a major role in Tyler Perry&#x27;s play Madea on the Run.

<doc id="914496" wikidata="Q1751063" url="?curid=914496" title="Coronation Chair">
<text>The Coronation Chair, also known as St Edward&#x27;s Chair or King Edward&#x27;s Chair, is an ancient wooden chair that is used by British monarchs when they are invested with regalia and crowned at their coronation. The chair was commissioned in 1296 by King Edward I of England to house the Stone of Scone, the symbol of royal authority in Scotland. Since 1308, it has been used at every coronation of English and British Monarchs at Westminster Abbey. The coronation chair is arguably the most valuable and revered piece of furniture in the world. The chair was named after Edward the Confessor, and is currently kept in St George&#x27;s Chapel at Westminster Abbey, London, and was last used by King Charles III at his coronation in 2023.
==History==
King Edward I of England seized the Stone of Scone, the traditional coronation seat of the Scottish kings, from Scone Abbey in Perthshire in 1296. Edward brought the Stone to England and commissioned the Coronation Chair to hold it. The high-backed, Gothic-style armchair was carved from oak at some point between the summer of 1297 and March 1300 by the carpenter Walter of Durham. At first, the king ordered the chair to be made of bronze, but he changed his mind and decided it should be made of timber. It was originally covered in gilding and coloured glass, much of which has now been lost. The chair is the oldest dated piece of English furniture made by a known artist. Although it was not originally intended to be a coronation chair, it began to be associated with coronations of English monarchs at some point in the 14th century, and the first coronation where it was definitely used was that of Henry IV in 1399. Monarchs used to sit on the Stone of Scone itself until a wooden platform was added to the chair in the 17th century.

When William III and Mary II became joint monarchs in 1689, they required two coronation chairs for the ceremony. William III used the original 13th-century chair, while a second chair was made for Mary II, which still resides in the abbey&#x27;s collections.

Gilded lions added in the 16th century form the legs to the chair; they were all replaced in 1727. One of the four lions was given a new head for the coronation of George IV in 1821. The chair itself was originally gilded, painted and inlaid with glass mosaics, traces of which are visible upon inspection of the chair, especially on the back where outlines of foliage, birds and animals survive. A lost image of a king, maybe Edward the Confessor or Edward I, with his feet resting on a lion was also painted on the back. Today, its appearance is of aged and brittle wood.
In the 18th century, tourists could sit on the chair for a small payment to one of the vergers. Tourists, choirboys and boys of Westminster School carved their initials, names and other graffiti into the chair, and the corner posts have been acutely damaged by souvenir hunters. Nails have often been driven into the wood to attach fabric for coronations, and in preparation for Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee, the chair was covered with a coating of brown paint. Sir Gilbert Scott, the Gothic revival architect and antiquary, described the chair as &quot;a magnificent piece of decoration, but sadly mutilated&quot;.

At 5:40pm on 11 June 1914, the chair was the object of a bomb attack thought to have been organised by the Suffragettes. A corner of the chair was broken off in the explosion. Although it was strong enough to shake the abbey walls and loud enough to be heard from inside the Houses of Parliament, none of the 70 people in the abbey at the time was injured, and the Coronation Chair was faithfully restored.

Over the eight centuries of its existence, the chair has only been removed from Westminster Abbey twice. The first time was for the ceremony in Westminster Hall when Oliver Cromwell was inducted as Lord Protector of the Commonwealth of England. The second was during the Second World War when, concerned about the risk of it being damaged or destroyed by German air raids, it was moved out of London. On 24 August 1939, the Stone of Scone was moved out of the way and the chair was loaded on a truck and, with two detectives accompanying the driver, it was driven to Gloucester Cathedral where the Dean and the Cathedral Architect signed for its receipt. The next day, five carpenters arrived to shore up the roof of a vaulted recess in the cathedral&#x27;s crypt with timber supports. Once they had finished their work, the chair was moved into the recess. As it also provided the best protected location, the cathedral&#x27;s 13th-century bog-oak effigy of Robert Curthose was placed on the chair. Sandbags were then used to seal off the recess. The chair remained there for the duration of the war. Meanwhile the chair used for the coronation of Mary II was relocated from Westminster Abbey to Winchester Cathedral for safekeeping.

On Christmas Day 1950, Scottish nationalists broke into Westminster Abbey and stole the Stone of Scone, damaging the stone. It was recovered in time for Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s coronation in 1953. 

In 1996, the stone was returned to Scotland, since when it has been kept at Edinburgh Castle on the proviso that it be returned to England for use at coronations (as happened for the coronation of King Charles III in 2023). (In 2024 the stone was relocated to a Perth Museum). In 1997, the year after the removal of the stone, the chair was removed from its traditional home in the Chapel of St Edward the Confessor and placed by the tomb of King Henry V. In 2010 the chair was moved to a chapel at the back of the Nave for cleaning, where it has since remained (when not in use).

The Coronation Chair is now highly protected, and leaves its secure location—behind glass on a plinth in St George&#x27;s Chapel in the nave—only when it is carried into the theatre of coronation near the High Altar of the abbey. Between 2010 and 2012, the chair was cleaned and restored by a team of experts in full view of the public at the abbey. In early 2023, a further programme of restoration and conservation was undertaken in preparation for the coronation of Charles III and Camilla; on 6 May 2023, the stone having been reunited with the chair for the occasion, the King was seated on it for his anointing, investiture and crowning.

==Other chairs used at the coronation==

Other chairs are used by the monarch (and consort) for different parts of the coronation ceremony. Chairs of Estate for the sovereign and consort are placed on the south side of the sanctuary: these are used during the first part of the service, prior to the sovereign&#x27;s anointing and crowning with St Edward&#x27;s Crown. Later, for the enthronement (and the homage which follows it), the monarch is seated not in the Coronation Chair, but in a separate Throne on a dais positioned in the middle of the crossing. On occasions when the wife of a king—a queen consort—is crowned, a similar throne is provided for her so that she can be seated next to the king but at a lower level.

Unlike the Coronation Chair, these other chairs and thrones have tended to be made new for each coronation. For the coronation of King Charles III and Queen Camilla, however, older chairs were reconditioned: 
* The Chairs of Estate had originally been made in 1953 on the occasion of the Coronation of Elizabeth II (since which time they had stood on the dais in the Throne Room in Buckingham Palace).
* The Thrones had originally been made for the Coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in 1937.
All four were restored and given new heraldic embroidery, as appropriate, prior to the coronation in May 2023.

Afterwards, the Chairs of Estate were returned to the dais in the Throne Room of Buckingham Palace. This room also contains other chairs from past coronations, including:
* Queen Victoria&#x27;s coronation Throne of 1837
* The Thrones used at the coronation of George V and Mary (1911)
* The Chairs of Estate from the coronation of George VI and Elizabeth (1937)

The 1953 Throne from the coronation of Elizabeth II is kept in the Garter Throne Room of Windsor Castle; while the 1902 Thrones from the coronation of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra are on the dais in the Ballroom at Buckingham Palace. A pair of Chairs of Estate (made for the 1902 coronation), which are usually kept in the Music Room at Buckingham Palace, have in recent years been employed when the monarch has addressed both Houses of Parliament in Westminster Hall.

<doc id="914497" wikidata="Q272263" url="?curid=914497" title="Elvira Madigan">
<text>Hedvig Antoinette Isabella Eleonore Jensen (December 4, 1867 July 19, 1889), better known by her stage name Elvira Madigan, was a circus performer who performed as a slack rope dancer, artistic rider, juggler and dancer. She is best known today for her romantic relationship with the Swedish nobleman and cavalry officer Sixten Sparre. Their joint death caused great sensation and the event was described in song by, among others, the author Johan Lindström Saxon in a song beginning &quot;Sad things happen&quot;, which gained great popularity.

==Early life==

Hedvig Antoinette Isabella Eleonore Jensen was born on December 4, 1867, in Flensburg, Schleswig-Holstein in the then Kingdom of Prussia. It is often stated that Elvira Madigan was Danish, but uncertainty prevails over which should be considered her home country as well as her citizenship.

Her mother, Eleonora Cecilie Christine Marie Olsen, was a circus artist born in Finland and was of Norwegian ancestry. She was later known as Laura Madigan (1849–1918) but during Elvira&#x27;s childhood she mostly used the stage name Miss Ulbinska. Elvira&#x27;s father, circus artist Frederik Peter Jensen, was born in 1845 in Copenhagen, Denmark. His later destiny is unknown.

At the time of Elvira Madigan&#x27;s birth in 1867 her parents were not married to each other, and they toured with the French circus director Didier Gautier&#x27;s &quot;Cirque du Nord&quot; in Germany and Denmark. During the years 1869–1872 Elvira&#x27;s mother toured with Circus Renz in Germany and Austria, where she in 1871 gave birth to Elvira&#x27;s half-brother Richard Heinrich Olsen in Berlin. He later toured with the stage name Oscar Madigan. The father of this child is unknown. In 1875, Elvira&#x27;s mother worked at Circus Myers in Austria, where she got to know the American circus artist John Madigan, whom she subsequently lived with. The following year Elvira Madigan, then still Hedvig Jensen, made her debut in the circus, a pas-de-deux with John Madigan during a performance with the circus Loisset in Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen. After the death of Loisset in Norrköping the following year, his circus was dissolved, and the Madigan family moved to Circus Ciniselli in Russia. There Elvira Madigan trained to be a slack line dancer.

===Career===
In the summer of 1879, the Madigan family tried to run their own small circus company in Finland and at the same time Hedvig began using the name Elvira Madigan. The following year, when the family appeared in Circus Cremes in Vienna, Gisela Brož became a foster child in the family, she was two years older than Elvira. Gisela was trained as a tightrope dancer, and together with Elvira on slack line they practiced a unique number, where they appeared simultaneously on separate lines, one above the other. Elvira used to juggle at the same time as she was on the line. The number became a sensation, and in the following years the girls appeared as &quot;daughters of the air&quot; in circuses and in variety rooms across much of Europe, including in Berlin, Paris, London, Brussels and Moscow. After an appearance at Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen in 1886 before the Danish royal family, the girls were each awarded a gold cross by King Christian IX of Denmark. The following year, John Madigan again started his own circus company, this time in Denmark. Gisela left the family in the autumn of the same year, after which Elvira had to appear alone when the tour continued to Sweden.

== Relationship with Sixten Sparre ==
In January, 1888, circus Madigan appeared in Kristianstad, where she was seen by the dragoon lieutenant Sixten Sparre.

=== Letter exchange ===
Sixten Sparre, who was married and had two children, fell madly in love with Madigan, who was considered an extraordinary beauty, with an excellent figure and almost meter-long blond hair. Sparre sought her out, and the two started a correspondence. Madigan gradually tired of his writing, and several times tried to end their correspondence. Sparre, however, tried to persuade her to leave both her family and the circus to marry him. According to a letter that Elvira&#x27;s mother later wrote to the Danish newspaper &quot;Politiken&quot;, Sparre threatened to shoot himself if Madigan did not do as he wanted. He also lied to her about his marital and financial status; he had squandered his entire fortune and was heavily in debt. After suffering a nervous breakdown, Madigan finally gave in; on May 28, 1889, she secretly left her family at the circus&#x27;s stop in Sundsvall. Her family was unaware of her correspondence with Sparre.

=== Relationship development ===
Sparre, who was granted two months leave from May 27, met Madigan in Bollnäs. The two went on to Stockholm, where Madigan&#x27;s mother made a failed attempt to catch the couple by taking a steamboat from Sundsvall. After a few weeks in an unknown place, they arrived at Svendborg on Funen on June 18. They lived almost a month at the city hotel, but when the hotel director presented a bill, the couple fled. The already heavily indebted Sparre was completely broke at this point and had been living on credit for several weeks. The two lived a few days in a guest house in Troense on Tåsinge, Denmark. On July 18, they went to the nearby forest area Nørreskov, where Sparre shot Elvira with his service revolver and then killed himself on the morning of July 19, 1889. Their bodies were found three days later. In Madigan&#x27;s dress pocket was found a paper with a poem that she had written herself just before her death. The poem was written in a mixture of Swedish, Danish, Norwegian and German.

=== Funeral ===

The couple were buried at Landet&#x27;s cemetery in the middle of Tåsinge on July 27 in the presence of a large number of locals and summer guests. The hotel bills, funeral costs and tombstones were paid for by Sparre&#x27;s brother, Edvard. Madigan&#x27;s grandmother came to oversee the funeral, but she did not arrive in time. The original tombstones are of two different materials. Madigan&#x27;s is of white marble and Sparre&#x27;s of dark grey granite. The difference was to mark that the two were not a &quot;genuine&quot; couple.

The original burial ground is located a few meters south of the great oak in the middle of the cemetery, but during a reorganization of the cemetery walkways in 1943, the gravestones were moved a few meters to the southeast and turned to the west. The original gravestones were replaced by new ones on the 75th anniversary in 1964. On Madigan&#x27;s new gravestone her stage name was also mentioned. In 1999, the original tombstones were restored and re-used, but now turned east and moved a few meters eastward. In 2013, the memorial site was redesigned again and the tombstones were placed close to each other in the middle of a circular pavement located near the 1999 memorial site.

== Legacy ==
The interpretation of the murder drama that was told was a love story and became to many a symbol of romantic love. It was about a circus princess who was courted by a nobleman, in a combination of morality and entertainment. The event, in its turn, brought a tremendous look, and promptly gave rise to poetry and poems. Johan Lindström Saxon&#x27;s broadside ballad was heard throughout the Nordic countries from the autumn of 1889 and for many decades to come. Everyone knew the story, and everyone could sing the song. But it was not just Barrel organists that conveyed the story, also the newspapers were full of up-to-date descriptions, even with terrible details.

The couple&#x27;s relationship also gave rise to an intense press debate. The conservative press condemned the couple&#x27;s actions and Sparre&#x27;s adultery, while the liberal press was more understanding. The event was interpreted as saying that the couple had to take this step because of the class society of the time and the prevailing sexual morality. Among other things, the Danish author Holger Drachmann wrote the tribute poem (To the two) under these premises. The event was seen as a repetition of the Mayerling incident, but the extent to which the two were influenced by this event is unclear. Already in the first press releases on the drama, this connection to the event in Austria was made six months earlier, and other newspapers continued to spin on this thread, perhaps mostly because this version was what the readers wanted: the all-consuming love, stronger than death, in addition, between a man of noble birth and a woman of very humble lineage (circus performers stood very low on the social scale). This romanticized view of the drama has survived to the present day through movies, novels, musicals and much more.

However, recent years of research give a different picture. It has emerged that Sparre in the last few years of his life lived very extravagantly. He had wasted his fortune and systematically withdrew debts in a way that gave rise to questions about his mental health. According to Grönqvist, he may have suffered from bipolar disorder, and his systematic waste, his renunciation of the family and the values his social class traditionally represented (Sparre posed far left politically in the last few years), and finally the love affair with Madigan should then be seen as the rash of his illness. Lindhe maintained that Sparre was spoiled, wasteful and narcissistic; he also condemned Sparre&#x27;s wife Luitgard.

Contemporaries remembered Madigan as having been shy and withdrawn. She had been interested in poetry and literature, and was a good amateur pianist.

== Elvira Madigan in culture ==
In 1943, Åke Ohberg directed the first Swedish film version of &quot;Elvira Madigan&quot; with Eva Henning and himself in the lead roles. After pressure from relatives of Sixten Sparre, his name was changed to Christian.

In 1967, Bo Widerberg made his film adaptation, &quot;Elvira Madigan&quot;, with Pia Degermark and Thommy Berggren in the lead roles. The film music used throughout was the second movement from Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 21 in C major (K. 467), which has subsequently sometimes been referred to as the &quot;Elvira Madigan&quot; concerto. The same year, Poul Erik Møller Pedersen also directed a Danish film, with Anne Mette Michaelsen in the title role as Elvira Madigan and Søren Svejstrup as Sixten Sparre.

In 1990, the &quot;Circus Elvira Madigan&quot; by Jan Wirén and Lars-Åke von Vultée premiered in connection with that year&#x27;s edition of the Kristianstad Days. Directed by Hasse Alfredson and among others Johan Ulveson was in the cast.

The road on which the country church is located was named Elvira Madigans Vej in 1970; a was also bestowed with her name.

Sparre has a street named after him in the regiment area of Ystad, &quot;Sixten Sparres Gata&quot;.

<doc id="914498" wikidata="Q1700613" url="?curid=914498" title="John James Waterston">
<text>John James Waterston (1811 – 18 June 1883) was a Scottish physicist and a neglected pioneer of the kinetic theory of gases.

==Early life==
Waterston&#x27;s father, George, was an Edinburgh sealing wax manufacturer and stationer, a relative of the Sandeman family Robert and his brother, George. John was born, the sixth of nine children, into a family alive with interests in literature, science and music. He was educated at Edinburgh High School before becoming apprenticed as a civil engineer to Messrs. Grainger and Miller. His employers encouraged him to attend lectures at the University of Edinburgh. He studied mathematics and physics under Sir John Leslie as well as attending lectures in chemistry, anatomy and surgery and becoming an active participant in the student literary society.

At age nineteen, Waterston published a paper proposing a mechanical explanation of gravitation, accounting for &quot;action at a distance&quot; in terms of colliding particles and discussing interactions between linear and rotational motion that would play a part in his later kinetic theory. He proposed that ether is made of small cylindrical particles, and collisions with large matter particles would transfer rotational motion into linear motion, locally increasing the speed of the ether particles, which he claimed would lower the density of the ether and create an attractive force. 

Waterston moved to London at age twenty-one, where he worked as a railroad surveyor, becoming an associate of the Institution of Civil Engineers and publishing a paper on a graphical method for planning earthworks. The travel and disruption associated with his surveying work left Waterston little time to pursue his studies so he joined the hydrography department of the Admiralty under Francis Beaufort. It was Beaufort who, in 1839, supported Waterston for the post of naval instructor for cadets of the East India Company in Bombay. The posting worked well for Waterston who was able to pursue his reading and research at the library of Grant College.

==Kinetic theory==

Building on his theory of the mechanical explanation of gravity, he was the first to develop the kinetic theory, independently of earlier and equally neglected partial accounts by Daniel Bernoulli and John Herapath. He published it, at his own expense, in his book &quot;Thoughts on the Mental Functions&quot; (1843). He correctly derived all the consequences of the premise that gas pressure is a function of the number of molecules per unit volume, &quot;N&quot;; molecular mass, &quot;M&quot;; and molecular mean-squared velocity, formula_1. He established the relationship:

:formula_2.

He had been motivated to think of a &quot;wave theory of heat&quot; by analogy with the wave theory of light and some experiments by James Forbes and Macedonio Melloni on radiant heat. His statement that &quot;... in mixed media the mean square molecular velocity is inversely proportional to the specific weight of the molecules&quot; has been seen as the first statement of the equipartition theorem for translational motion. Waterston grasped that, while the kinetic energy of an individual molecule with velocity formula_3 is formula_4, heat energy is proportional to temperature formula_5. That insight led him to derive the ideal gas law:

:formula_6.

The publication made little impact, perhaps because of the title. He submitted his theory, under Beaufort&#x27;s sponsorship, to the Royal Society in 1845 but was rejected. Referee Sir John William Lubbock wrote &quot;The paper is nothing but nonsense.&quot;

Unable to retrieve a copy of his paper (he had failed to make a copy for himself before submitting the paper to the Royal Society), he rewrote the work and sought to advertise it elsewhere, attracting little attention other than from William John Macquorn Rankine and Hermann von Helmholtz through whom it may have influenced August Krönig. The theory gained acceptance only when it was proposed by Rudolf Clausius and James Clerk Maxwell in the 1850s by which time Waterston&#x27;s contribution had been forgotten.

==Later life==
He returned to Edinburgh in 1857 to pursue his own novel physical ideas but met with unyielding neglect and discouragement from the scientific establishment. Neglect was exacerbated by his own increasing reclusiveness and hostility to the learned societies. He worked on acoustics, astronomy, fluid mechanics and thermodynamics.

In 1858, 27 years after he published his theory of the mechanical explanation of gravity and 15 years after publishing the kinetic theory, he continued to push for others to explore his ideas on gravity without much avail.

He left his Edinburgh home on 18 June and drowned in a nearby canal, possibly falling into the canal due to heat stress from his astronomical observation activities.

==Recognition after death==
As discussed above, Waterston&#x27;s paper submitted to the Royal Society was rejected. Some years after Waterston&#x27;s death, Lord Rayleigh (Secretary of Royal Society at that time) managed to dig it out from the archives of the Royal Society. Finally, Waterston&#x27;s paper was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1892. (Please see below.)

Rayleigh felt that Waterston&#x27;s case was not an aberration, but the norm:&quot;The history of [Waterston&#x27;s] paper suggests that highly speculative investigations, especially by an unknown author, are best brought before the world through some other channel than a scientific society, which naturally hesitates to admit into its printed records matter of uncertain value. Perhaps one may go further, and say that a young author who believes himself capable of great things would usually do well to secure favourable recognition of the scientific world by work whose scope is limited, and whose value is easily judged, before embarking upon higher flights.&quot;

<text>SightSpeed is a videoconferencing company, supplying VoIP and instant messaging app for Windows and macOS operating systems. The service allows people to make video calls, computer-to-computer voice calls, and calls to regular telephones, with free and paid versions.

In October 2008, the company was acquired by Logitech for $30 million. The Logitech Vid service is based on SightSpeed&#x27;s technology. Due to competing software, the Logitech Vid video calling service will be discontinued as of 1 July 2013 and the downloading of the product has already been terminated. As a result, Logitech is no longer accepting new account registrations.

== Limitations ==

The main criticisms are:
* Lack of true privacy features such as encryption.
* SightSpeed &quot;Phone Out&quot; does not support outbound caller ID in the United States, where people commonly reject calls from unrecognized numbers. The recipient sees &quot;unknown&quot; or a blank field instead of the caller ID number.
* Though it uses the SIP standard it is not interoperable with SIP networks and can only be used with a SightSpeed account.

<doc id="914503" wikidata="Q910689" url="?curid=914503" title="Sport policies of the European Union">
<text>The [[European Union]] plays a minor and mostly indirect policy role in sport, because (a) sport is normally considered to be outside the competences conferred by the member states to the European Union and (b) sport is in general organised internally, on a European continental level (which is not the same as the level of the European Union), or globally.

==Role of the EU==
=== Direct ===

The European Union has a very limited direct role in sport. The European Commission is composed of Directorates-General and several departments. Within the Directorate-General Education and Culture, is the Sport Unit, which is responsible for the following main areas:
* cooperation within the commission and with other institutions on sport-related issues,
* cooperation with national and international sports institutions, organisations and federations,
* bilateral meetings with sports institutions and organisations and international sports federations. 

One of the few specific measures in sport was taken by Decision No. 291/2003/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 February 2003 that established the European Year of Education through Sport 2004.

The activities and initiatives undertaken during 2004 were organised at Community, transnational, national, regional and local level, and was sometimes co-financed by the Community. Activities compromised for instance financial support for transnational, national, regional or local initiatives to promote education through sport. 

Under the Lisbon Treaty, the EU role in sports is limited, because Article 165(4) states that the EU objectives in sports are restricted to measures &quot;excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States&quot;. As such, the EU can not adopt legislation or any other legally binding measures, instead it acts through guidelines, recommendations, and funding, in order to support its sport-related objectives.

===Indirect===
Although not directed specifically at sport, many of the rules, policies and programmes of the European Union affect the sports world or are of interest to it.

In particular, the common market of the European Union creates the right for any EU citizen to move and work freely in another member state. The landmark Bosman ruling confirmed that this right, when applied to professional athletes, forbids nationality quotas in sports leagues that affect EU citizens. This has changed the face of professional sports in the EU, with top teams now collecting talent from all over Europe, and sometimes even fielding teams with no domestic players at all.

<text>The New Hollywood, Hollywood Renaissance, American New Wave, or New American Cinema (not to be confused with the New American Cinema of the 1960s that was part of avant-garde underground cinema), was a movement in American film history from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, when a new generation of filmmakers came to prominence. They influenced the types of film produced, their production and marketing, and the way major studios approached filmmaking. In New Hollywood films, the film director, rather than the studio, took on a key authorial role.

The definition of &quot;New Hollywood&quot; varies, depending on the author, with some defining it as a movement and others as a period. The span of the period is also a subject of debate, as well as its integrity, as some authors, such as Thomas Schatz, argue that the New Hollywood consists of several different movements. The films made in this movement are stylistically characterized in that their narrative often deviated from classical norms. After the demise of the studio system and the rise of television, the commercial success of films was diminished.

Successful films of the early New Hollywood era include &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, &quot;The Graduate&quot;, &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot;, and &quot;Easy Rider&quot; while films that failed at the box office such as &quot;New York, New York&quot;, &quot;Sorcerer&quot;, &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Gate&quot;, &quot;They All Laughed&quot; and &quot;One from the Heart&quot; marked the end of the era.

==History==
=== Background ===
Following the Paramount Case (which ended block booking and ownership of theater chains by film studios) and the advent of television (where Rod Serling, John Frankenheimer, Arthur Penn, Paddy Chayefsky and Sidney Lumet worked in their earlier years), both of which severely weakened both the traditional studio system and the Motion Picture Production Code (or the Hays Code), Hollywood studios initially used spectacle to retain profitability. Technicolor developed a far more widespread use, while widescreen processes and technical improvements, such as CinemaScope, stereo sound, and others, such as 3-D, were invented to retain the dwindling audience and compete with television. However, these were generally unsuccessful in increasing profits. By 1957, &quot;Life&quot; magazine called the 1950s &quot;the horrible decade&quot; for Hollywood. It was dubbed a &quot;New Hollywood&quot; by a press.

In the 1950s and early 1960s, Hollywood was dominated by musicals, historical epics, and other films that benefited from the larger screens, wider framing, and improved sound. However, audience shares continued to dwindle, and had reached alarmingly low levels by the mid-1960s. Several costly flops, including &quot;Tora! Tora! Tora!&quot;, Gene Kelly&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Hello, Dolly!&quot; and the Julie Andrews vehicle &quot;Star!&quot;, each failed attempts to replicate the success of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;, &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; and &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, put great strain on the studios.

By the time the Baby Boomer generation started to come of age in the 1960s, &quot;Old Hollywood&quot; was rapidly losing money; the studios were unsure how to react to the much-changed audience demographics. The change in the market during the period went from a middle-aged high school-educated audience in the mid-1960s to a younger, more affluent, college-educated demographic: by the mid-1970s, 76% of all movie-goers were under 30, 64% of whom had gone to college. European films, both arthouse and commercial (especially the Commedia all&#x27;italiana, the French New Wave, the Spaghetti Western), and Japanese cinema were making a splash in the United States – the huge market of disaffected youth seemed to find relevance and artistic meaning in movies like Michelangelo Antonioni&#x27;s &quot;Blowup&quot;, with its oblique narrative structure and full-frontal female nudity.

The desperation felt by studios during this period of economic downturn, and after the losses from expensive movie flops, led to innovation and risk-taking, allowing greater control by younger directors and producers. Therefore, in an attempt to capture that audience that found a connection to the &quot;art films&quot; of Europe, the studios hired a host of young filmmakers and allowed them to make their films with relatively little studio control. Some of whom, like actor Jack Nicholson and director Peter Bogdanovich, were mentored by &quot;King of the Bs&quot; Roger Corman while others like celebrated cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond worked for lesser-known B movie directors like Ray Dennis Steckler, known for the 1962 Arch Hall Jr. vehicle &quot;Wild Guitar&quot; and the 1963 horror musical flick &quot;The Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies&quot;. This, together with the breakdown of the Hays Code following the Freedman v. Maryland court case in 1965 and the new ratings system in 1968 (reflecting growing market segmentation) set the scene for the New Hollywood.

===&quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;===
A defining film of the New Hollywood generation was &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; (1967). Produced by and starring Warren Beatty and directed by Arthur Penn, its combination of graphic violence and humor, as well as its theme of glamorous disaffected youth, was a hit with audiences. The film eventually won Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actress (Estelle Parsons) and Best Cinematography.

When Jack L. Warner, then-CEO of Warner Bros., first saw a rough cut of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; in the summer of 1967, he hated it. Distribution executives at Warner Brothers agreed, giving the film a low-key premiere and limited release. Their strategy appeared justified when Bosley Crowther, middlebrow film critic at &quot;The New York Times&quot;, gave the movie a scathing review. &quot;It is a cheap piece of bald-faced slapstick comedy,&quot; he wrote, &quot;that treats the hideous depredations of that sleazy, moronic pair as though they were as full of fun and frolic as the jazz-age cut-ups in &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot;...&quot; Other notices, including those from &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Newsweek&quot; magazines, were equally dismissive.

Its portrayal of violence and ambiguity in regard to moral values, and its startling ending, divided critics. Following one of the negative reviews, &quot;Time&quot; magazine received letters from fans of the movie, and according to journalist Peter Biskind, the impact of critic Pauline Kael in her positive review of the film (October 1967, &quot;New Yorker&quot;) led other reviewers to follow her lead and re-evaluate the film (notably &quot;Newsweek&quot; and &quot;Time&quot;). Kael drew attention to the innocence of the characters in the film and the artistic merit of the contrast of that with the violence in the film: &quot;In a sense, it is the absence of sadism — it is the violence without sadism — that throws the audience off balance at &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;. The brutality that comes out of this innocence is far more shocking than the calculated brutalities of mean killers.&quot; Kael also noted the reaction of audiences to the violent climax of the movie, and the potential to empathize with the gang of criminals in terms of their naiveté and innocence reflecting a change in expectations of American cinema.

The cover story in &quot;Time&quot; magazine in December 1967, celebrated the movie and innovation in American New Wave cinema. This influential article by Stefan Kanfer claimed that &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; represented a &quot;New Cinema&quot; through its blurred genre lines, and disregard for honored aspects of plot and motivation, and that &quot;In both conception and execution, &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; is a watershed picture, the kind that signals a new style, a new trend.&quot; Biskind states that this review and turnaround by some critics allowed the film to be re-released, thus proving its commercial success and reflecting the move toward the New Hollywood. The impact of this film is important in understanding the rest of the American New Wave, as well as the conditions that were necessary for it.

These initial successes paved the way for the studio to relinquish almost complete control to these innovative young filmmakers. In the mid-1970s, idiosyncratic, startling original films such as &quot;Paper Moon&quot;, &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;, &quot;Chinatown&quot;, and &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, among others, enjoyed enormous critical and commercial success. These successes by the members of the New Hollywood led each of them in turn to make more and more extravagant demands, both on the studio and eventually on the audience.

== Characteristics ==

The new generation of Hollywood filmmakers was most importantly, from the studios&#x27; view, young, therefore able to reach the youth audience they were losing. This collective of actors, screenwriters and directors, dubbed the &quot;New Hollywood&quot; by the press, briefly changed the business from the producer-driven Hollywood system of the past as Todd Berliner has written about the period&#x27;s unusual narrative practices.

The 1970s, Berliner says, marks Hollywood&#x27;s most significant formal transformation since the conversion to sound film and is the defining period separating the storytelling modes of the studio era and contemporary Hollywood. New Hollywood films deviate from classical narrative norms more than Hollywood films from any other era or movement. Their narrative and stylistic devices threaten to derail an otherwise straightforward narration. Berliner argues that five principles govern the narrative strategies characteristic of Hollywood films of the 1970s:
* Seventies films show a perverse tendency to integrate, in narrative incidental ways, story information and stylistic devices counterproductive to the films&#x27; overt and essential narrative purposes.
* Hollywood filmmakers of the 1970s often situate their film-making practices in between those of classical Hollywood and those of European and Asian art cinema.
* Seventies films prompt spectator responses more uncertain and discomforting than those of more typical Hollywood cinema.
* Seventies narratives place an uncommon emphasis on irresolution, particularly at the moment of climax or in epilogues, when more conventional Hollywood movies busy themselves tying up loose ends.
* Seventies cinema hinders narrative linearity and momentum and scuttles its potential to generate suspense and excitement.

Seventies cinema also dealt with masculine crises featuring flawed male characters, downbeat conclusions and pessimistic subject matters alongside hard-nosed depictions of a America reeling from tense conflicts like The Vietnam War and President Richard Nixon&#x27;s Watergate scandal.

Thomas Schatz points to another difference with the Hollywood Golden Age, which deals with the relationship of characters and plot. He argues that plot in classical Hollywood films (and some of the earlier New Hollywood films like &quot;The Godfather&quot;) &quot;tended to emerge more organically as a function of the drives, desires, motivations, and goals of the central characters&quot;. However, beginning with mid-1970s, he points to a trend that &quot;characters became plot functions&quot;.

During the height of the studio system, films were made almost exclusively on set in isolated studios. The content of films was limited by the Motion Picture Production Code, and though golden-age film-makers found loopholes in its rules, the discussion of more taboo content through film was effectively prevented. The shift towards a &quot;new realism&quot; was made possible when the Motion Picture Association of America film rating system was introduced and location shooting was becoming more viable. New York City was a favorite spot for this new set of filmmakers due to its gritty atmosphere.

Because of breakthroughs in film technology (e.g. the Panavision Panaflex camera, introduced in 1972; the Steadicam, introduced in 1976), the New Hollywood filmmakers could shoot 35mm camera film in exteriors with relative ease. Since location shooting was cheaper (no sets need to be built) New Hollywood filmmakers rapidly developed the taste for location shooting, resulting in a more naturalistic approach to filmmaking, especially when compared to the mostly stylized approach of classical Hollywood musicals and spectacles made to compete with television during the 1950s and early 1960s. The documentary films of D.A. Pennebaker, the Maysles Brothers and Frederick Wiseman, among others, also influenced filmmakers of this era.

However, in editing, New Hollywood filmmakers adhered to realism more liberally than most of their classical Hollywood predecessors, often using editing for artistic purposes rather than for continuity alone, a practice inspired by European art films and classical Hollywood directors such as D. W. Griffith and Alfred Hitchcock. Films with unorthodox editing included &quot;Easy Rider&quot;&#x27;s use of jump cuts (influenced by the works of experimental collage filmmaker Bruce Conner) to foreshadow the climax of the movie, as well as subtler uses, such as those to reflect the feeling of frustration in &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, the subjectivity of the protagonist in &quot;The Graduate&quot; and the passage of time in the famous match cut from &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot;. Dense sound design was also commonplace during this era. 

Also influential were the works of experimental filmmakers Arthur Lipsett, Stan Brakhage, Bruce Baillie, Jordan Belson, John Whitney, Scott Bartlett, Maya Deren and Kenneth Anger with their combinations of music and imagery and each were cited by George Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese as influences. The New Hollywood generation of directors and screenwriters (each educated at either USC, UCLA, NYU and AFI) such as Coppola, Lucas, Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, John Milius and Paul Schrader were sometimes jokingly labeled as &quot;Movie Brats&quot; or &quot;Young Turks&quot;. 

The end of the production code enabled New Hollywood films to feature anti-establishment political themes, the use of rock music, and sexual freedom deemed &quot;counter-cultural&quot; by the studios. The youth movement of the 1960s turned anti-heroes like &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and &quot;Cool Hand Luke&quot; into pop-culture idols, and &quot;Life&quot; magazine called the characters in &quot;Easy Rider&quot; &quot;part of the fundamental myth central to the counterculture of the late 1960s.&quot; &quot;Easy Rider&quot; also affected the way studios looked to reach the youth market. The success of &quot;Midnight Cowboy&quot;, in spite of its &quot;X&quot; rating, was evidence for the interest in controversial themes at the time and also showed the weakness of the rating system and segmentation of the audience.

==Interpretations on defining the movement==
For Peter Biskind, the new wave was foreshadowed by &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; and began in earnest with &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. Biskind&#x27;s book &quot;Easy Riders, Raging Bulls&quot; argues that the New Hollywood movement marked a significant shift towards independently produced and innovative works by a new wave of directors, but that this shift began to reverse itself when the commercial success of &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Star Wars&quot; led to the realization by studios of the importance of blockbusters, advertising and control over production (even though the success of &quot;The Godfather&quot; was said to be the precursor to the blockbuster phenomenon).

Writing in 1968, critic Pauline Kael argued that the importance of &quot;The Graduate&quot; was in its social significance in relation to a new young audience, and the role of mass media, rather than any artistic aspects. Kael argued that college students identifying with &quot;The Graduate&quot; were not too different from audiences identifying with characters in dramas of the previous decade. She also compared this era of cinema to &quot;tangled, bitter flowering of American letters in the 1850s&quot;.

Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino identified in his 2022 book &quot;Cinema Speculation&quot; that:

&quot;regular moviegoers were becoming weary of modern American movies. The darkness, the drug use, the embrace of sensation-the violence, the sex, and the sexual violence. But even more than that, they became wear of the anti-everything cynicism... Was everything a bummer? Was everything a drag? Was every movie about some guy with problems?&quot;

In 1980, film historian/scholar Robert P. Kolker examined New Hollywood film directors in his book &quot;A Cinema of Loneliness: Penn, Kubrick, Coppola, Scorsese, Altman&quot;, and how their films influenced American society of the 1960s and 1970s. Kolker observed that &quot;for all the challenge and adventure, their films speak to a continual impotence in the world, an inability to change and to create change.&quot;

John Belton points to the changing demographic to even younger, more conservative audiences in the mid 1970s (50% aged 12–20) and the move to less politically subversive themes in mainstream cinema, as did Thomas Schatz, who saw the mid- to late 1970s as the decline of the art cinema movement as a significant industry force with its peak in 1974–75 with &quot;Nashville&quot; and &quot;Chinatown&quot;.

Geoff King sees the period as an interim movement in American cinema where a conjunction of forces led to a measure of freedom in filmmaking, while Todd Berliner says that 70s cinema resists the efficiency and harmony that normally characterize classical Hollywood cinema and tests the limits of Hollywood&#x27;s classical model.

According to author and film critic Charles Taylor (&quot;Opening Wednesday at a Theater or Drive-In Near You&quot;), he stated that &quot;the 1970s remain the third — and, to date, last — great period in American movies&quot;. Author and film critic David Thomson also shared similar sentiment to the point of dubbing the era &quot;the decade when movies mattered&quot;.

Author A.D. Jameson (&quot;I Find Your Lack of Faith Disturbing&quot;), on the other hand, claimed that &quot;Star Wars&quot; was New Hollywood&#x27;s finest achievement that actually embodied the characteristics of the respected &quot;serious, sophisticated adult films&quot; while questioning the often-told critical narrative of said &quot;last great decade of American cinema&quot;.

Steven Hyden, writing for &quot;Grantland&quot;, called the Movie Brats the &quot;cinematic version&quot; of classic rock, to the point of roll calling Spielberg as the Beatles, Scorsese as the Velvet Underground, Coppola as Bob Dylan, Lucas as Pink Floyd, Robert Altman as Neil Young, Brian De Palma as Led Zeppelin, Bogdanovich as the Beach Boys and Hal Ashby as the Kinks.

==Criticism==
&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article film critic Manohla Dargis described New Hollywood as the &quot;halcyon age&quot; of 1970s filmmaking, that &quot;was less revolution than business as usual, with rebel hype&quot;. She also pointed out in her &quot;New York Times&quot; article that the era&#x27;s enthusiasts insist this was &quot;when American movies grew up (or at least starred underdressed actresses); when directors did what they wanted (or at least were transformed into brands); when creativity ruled (or at least ran gloriously amok, albeit often on the studio&#x27;s dime).&quot;

This era was also infamous for its excessive decadence and on-set mishaps. Incidents plaguing the behind-the-scenes of some of the horror films from this era (such as &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby&quot;, &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; and &quot;The Omen&quot;) were also the subjects for the docuseries &quot;Cursed Films&quot;. Even Spielberg, who co-directed/co-produced &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; with John Landis, was so disgusted by the latter&#x27;s handling of a deadly helicopter accident that resulted in the death of three actors, that he ended their friendship and publicly called for the end of New Hollywood. When approached by the press about the accident, he stated:

&quot;No movie is worth dying for. I think people are standing up much more now, than ever before, to producers and directors who ask too much. If something isn&#x27;t safe, it&#x27;s the right and responsibility of every actor or crew member to yell, &#x27;Cut!&#x27;

==Legacy==
The films of New Hollywood influenced future mainstream and independent filmmakers such as Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson and Noah Baumbach. Todd Phillips&#x27;s 2019 DC Comics adaptation &quot;Joker&quot;, alongside the film&#x27;s period setting, was inspired by the Martin Scorsese classics &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; and &quot;The King of Comedy&quot; while Alexander Payne&#x27;s 2023 film &quot;The Holdovers&quot; took inspiration from Ashby&#x27;s works.

They also influenced both the Poliziotteschi genre films in Italy and a decade later the Cinéma du look movement in France. The narrative for the 1983 British shot-on-video film &quot;Suffer Little Children&quot; was influenced in part by Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Carrie&quot; and John Carpenter&#x27;s &quot;Halloween&quot;.

American Eccentric Cinema has been noted as influenced by this era. Both traditions have similar themes and narratives of existentialism and the need for human interaction. New Hollywood focuses on the darker elements of humanity and society within the context of the American Dream in the mid-1960s to the early 1980s, with themes that were reflective of sociocultural issues and were centered around the potential meaninglessness of pursuing the American Dream as generation upon generation was motivated to possess it. In comparison, American Eccentric Cinema does not have a distinct context, its films show characters who are very individual and their concerns are very distinctive to their own personalities.

The New American Cinema has also been ripe for parody as in Peter Jackson&#x27;s 1989 Muppet satire &quot;Meet the Feebles&quot; (spoofing the Russian Roulette scene from &quot;The Deer Hunter&quot;), Ernie Fosselius&#x27;s spoofs &quot;Hardware Wars&quot; (1978) and &quot;Porklips Now&quot; (1980),
Jim Reardon&#x27;s cult 1986 animated student film &quot;Bring Me the Head of Charlie Brown&quot; spoofing &quot;Taxi Driver&quot;, &quot;The Wild Bunch&quot; and &quot;Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia&quot; and Canadian video artist Todd Graham&#x27;s 1987 cult fan film &quot;Apocalypse Pooh&quot;, a bizarrely comedic mash-up of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Winnie the Pooh&quot; and Coppola&#x27;s &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;.

<doc id="914515" wikidata="Q1298788" url="?curid=914515" title="Tophet">
<text>In the Hebrew Bible, Tophet or Topheth (; ; ) is a location in Jerusalem in the Valley of Hinnom (Gehenna), where worshipers engaged in a ritual involving &quot;passing a child through the fire&quot;, most likely child sacrifice. Traditionally, the sacrifices have been ascribed to a god named Moloch. The Bible condemns and forbids these sacrifices, and the tophet is eventually destroyed by king Josiah, although mentions by the prophets Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Isaiah suggest that the practices associated with the tophet may have persisted.

Most scholars agree that the ritual performed at the tophet was child sacrifice, and they connect it to similar episodes throughout the Bible and recorded in Phoenicia and Carthage by Hellenistic sources. There is disagreement about whether the sacrifices were offered to a god named &quot;Moloch&quot;. Based on Phoenician and Carthaginian inscriptions, a growing number of scholars believe that the word &quot;moloch&quot; refers to the type of sacrifice rather than a deity. There is currently a dispute as to whether these sacrifices were dedicated to Yahweh rather than a foreign deity.

Archaeologists have applied the term &quot;tophet&quot; to large cemeteries of children found at Carthaginian sites that have traditionally been believed to house sacrificed human children, as described by Hellenistic and biblical sources. This interpretation is controversial: some scholars argue that the tophets may have been children&#x27;s cemeteries and reject Hellenistic sources as anti-Carthaginian propaganda. Others argue that not all burials in the tophet were sacrifices.

The tophet and its location later became associated with divine punishment in Jewish eschatology.

== Etymology ==
There is no consensus on the etymology of tophet, a word which only occurs eight times in the Masoretic Text. The word may be derived from the Aramaic word meaning &quot;hearth&quot;, &quot;fireplace&quot;, or &quot;roaster&quot;, a proposal first made by William Robertson Smith in 1887. Some have suggested that the word has been altered via using the vocalization of &quot;shame&quot;. Others derive the word from the Hebrew root &quot;to set (on fire)&quot;, cognate with Ugaritic &quot;to set&quot;. A new proposal has been made to interpret the term as &quot;place of vow&quot; by Robert M. Kerr.

The Talmud (Eruvin 19a) and Jerome derive the name from a Hebrew verb meaning &quot;to seduce&quot;. The historically most significant etymology, followed by both Jewish and Christian exegetes until the modern period, was made by the 11th-century CE rabbi Rashi, who derived the term from Hebrew &quot;drum&quot;, claiming that the drums were beaten during the sacrifice to Moloch, deriving his ideas from Plutarch&#x27;s description of Carthaginian sacrifice. This derivation is, however, morphologically impossible.

==Biblical and Levantine references==
===In the Bible===

The tophet is attested 8 times in the Hebrew Bible, mostly to designate a place of ritual fire or burning, but sometimes as a place name. The connection to ritual fire is made explicit in , ; and . In 2 Kings, King Josiah The text includes the destruction of the Tophet among Josiah&#x27;s other removal of &quot;deviant&quot; religious practices from Israel as part of a far reaching religious reform. However, the continued condemnation of both the tophet and related practices by prophets such as Jeremiah and Ezekiel suggests that the practice may have continued after Josiah&#x27;s reform, with a mention of the tophet by Isaiah suggesting it may have even continued after the Babylonian exile. Prior to Josiah&#x27;s reform, the ritual of passing a child through the fire is mentioned, without specifying that it took place at the tophet, as having been performed by the Israelite kings Ahaz and Manasseh:
Both kings perform the sacrifices when faced with the prospect of wars. The sacrifices appear to have been to Yahweh, the god of Israel, and to have been performed in the tophet.

The tophet is condemned repeatedly by name in the Book of Jeremiah, and the term is especially associated with that book of the bible. An example is at :

Jeremiah associates the tophet with Baal; however, other sources all associate it with Moloch.

P. Xella argues that no fewer than twenty-five passages in the Hebrew Bible show the Israelites and Canaanites sacrificing their children, including passages in Deuteronomy, (Dt. 12:13, 18:10), Leviticus (Lev. 18:21, 20:2-5), 2 Kings, 2 Chronicles, Isaiah, Ezra, Psalm 106, and the Book of Job. In , king Mesha of Moab burns his first-born son as an offering while besieged by the Israelites:

This act has been compared with Greco-Roman sources discussing the Phoenicians and Carthaginians engaging in the same or a similar practice in times of danger (see below). It appears to have been performed for the Moabite god Kemosh.

===Extrabiblical attestations===
There is no archaeological evidence for the Tophet at Jerusalem, so that we are reliant on the biblical descriptions to understand it. Archaeology has not yet securely identified any Tophets in the Levant, but there is other evidence for child sacrifice there. Ancient Egyptian inscriptions from the second millennium BCE attest the practice in the Levant. A late 8th-century BCE Phoenician inscription from İncirli in Turkey may indicate that first born sons were sacrificed there along with sheep and horses. The sacrifice of first-born sons in times of crisis appears to be dealt with at length in the inscription, although the precise context is unclear.

Greco-Roman sources also reference child sacrifice, such as an attempt at Tyre to revive a custom of sacrificing a boy during Alexander the Great&#x27;s Siege of Tyre in 332 BCE, recorded by first century CE Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus. The church historian Eusebius (3rd century CE) quotes from Philo of Byblos&#x27;s Phoenician history that:
===Theories===

Although a minority of scholars has argued that the tophet ritual described in the Bible was a harmless activity that did not involve sacrificing any children, the majority of scholars agree that the Bible depicts human sacrifice as occurring at the tophet. Modern scholarship has described sacrifice at the Tophet as a &quot;mulk&quot; or &quot;mlk&quot; sacrifice. The term appears to derive from a verb meaning &quot;presentation as an offering&quot; from the root &quot;to offer, present&quot; and found in Phoenician and Carthaginian inscriptions in the phrases &quot;sacrifice a human&quot;, &quot;to sacrifice a citizen&quot;, and &quot;sacrifice in place of flesh&quot;. Lawrence Stager and Samuel Wolff argue that the term &quot;refers to a live sacrifice of a child or animal&quot;.

The god to whom these sacrifices was directed is disputed in modern scholarship, with a dispute arising over whether the sacrifices were part of the cult of Yahweh. Traditionally, the god to whom the sacrifices were offered has been said to be Molech, supposedly an underworld god whose name means king. The Bible connects the Tophet with Moloch in two later texts, 2 Kings 23:10 and Jeremiah 32:35. Lindsay Cooper writes in support of this connection that &quot;The location of the Jerusalem tofet outside the city&#x27;s eastern wall, at the traditional entrance to the netherworld, explicitly connects child sacrifice with the cult of death.&quot; However, while scholars recognize the existence of an underworld deity called &quot;M-l-k&quot; with various vocalizations (e.g. Molech, Milcom) as well as an Akkadian term for the shades of the dead, there is no evidence to connect these deities or shades to human sacrifice. Later Phoenician and Punic sacrifices of children called &quot;mlk&quot; in inscriptions or described by Greco-Roman sources are not associated with these gods. On the basis of the word meaning &quot;to sacrifice&quot; &quot;an increasing number of scholars now take the biblical traditions to attest not to the offering of children in fiery sacrifices to the deity &quot;Molek&quot;, but rather to the sacrifice of children as &quot;mlk&quot; offerings to another deity&quot;. On the basis of the stories of Abraham and Jephthah offering their children to Yahweh, as well as Micah 6:6-7 and other passages, Francesca Stavrakopoulou argues that the offerings were in fact for Yahweh rather than for a foreign deity.

===Association with punishment===
The topheth&#x27;s description as a place of punishment derives in part by the use of the word in , in which Yahweh ignites a large tophet to punish the Assyrians:

The location of the tophet, the valley of Gehenna, subsequently became a place of punishment in the eschatology of Jewish Apocalypticism, something found in the 3rd- or 4th-century BCE Book of Enoch (1 Enoch 26:4; 27:2–3). The Talmud, discussing the passage in Isaiah, states that whoever commits evil will fall there (Eruvin 19a).

==Carthage and the western Mediterranean==
Various Greek and Roman sources describe the Carthaginians as engaging in the practice of sacrificing children by burning as part of their religion. These descriptions were compared to those found in the Hebrew Bible. The ancient descriptions were seemingly confirmed by the discovering of the so-called &quot;Tophet of Salambô&quot; in Carthage in 1921, which contained the urns of cremated children. However, modern historians and archaeologists debate the reality and extent of this practice. Some scholars propose that all remains at the Tophet were sacrificed, whereas others propose that only some were. Whilst scholars generally see the Carthaginians as faithful adherents to the mainland Phoenician religion, others believe that they were dissidents and that their sacrificial customs were unique innovations.

===Archaeological evidence===

In Phoenician sites throughout the Western Mediterranean except in the Iberian Peninsula and Ibiza, archaeology has revealed fields full of buried urns containing the burnt remains of human infants and lambs, covered by carved stone monuments. These fields are conventionally referred to as &quot;tophets&quot; by archaeologists, after the location in the Bible. When Carthaginian inscriptions refer to these locations, they use the terms &quot;bt&quot; (house, temple or sanctuary) or &quot;qdš&quot; (shrine), not &quot;tophet&quot;. Archaeology reveals two &quot;generations&quot; of Punic tophets: those founded by Phoenician colonists between 800 and 400 BCE; and those established under Carthaginian influence (direct or indirect) in North Africa from the 4th century BCE onward.
No Carthaginian literary texts survive that would explain or describe what rituals were performed at the tophet. Archaeological evidence shows that the remains could consist of human infants or lambs, often mixed with small portions of other animals, including cows, pigs, fish, birds, and deer. The proportion of lamb to human remains differs by site. At Carthage, 31% of the urns contained lambs; at Tharros it was 47%. Analysis of the bone fragments provides some information about the remains. In a sample of seventy infants from the tophet at Carthage, 37% were identified as male and 54% as female. The age of the children and whether they had died before they were interred is controversial (see below). The lambs are usually between one and three months old; this might indicate that offerings were made at a specific time following the lambing (February/March and October/November). The bone fragments were subjected to uneven temperatures, indicating they were burnt on an open-air pyre over several hours. The remains were then collected and placed in an urn, sometimes mixing in bones from other infants or lambs - suggesting that multiple infants/lambs were burnt on the same pyre. Sometimes jewellery or amulets were added to the urn. The urn was placed in the ground, in holes cut into the bedrock or within boxes made from stone slabs. In some cases a stone monument was set up above the urn. This could take the form of a stele, cippus, or throne, often with figural decoration and an inscription. In a few occasions, a chapel was built as well. Steles are oriented toward the east.
The figural decoration on the stone monuments takes different forms in different regions. In Carthage, geometric patterns were preferred. In Sardinia, human figures are more common. Inscriptions are most common in the Carthage tophet, where there are thousands of examples. There are some from other tophets as well. Matthew McCarty cites &quot;CIS&quot; I.2.511 as a typical inscription: 
To Lady Tanit, face of Baal, and to Lord Baal Hammon: [that] which Arisham son of Bodashtart, son of Bodeshmun vowed (&quot;ndr&quot;); because he (the god) heard his (Arisham&#x27;s) voice, he blessed him. 
Thus, these texts present the monument as a votive offering to the gods in thanks for a favour received from them. Sometimes the final clause instead reads &quot;may he (the god) hear his voice&quot; (i.e. in expectation of a future favour). The individual making the offering is almost always a single individual, nearly always male. The dead child is never mentioned. Tanit appears only in examples from Carthage. Other inscriptions refer to the ritual as &quot;mlk&quot; or &quot;molk&quot;. The meaning of this term is uncertain, but it appears to be the same word as the Biblical term &quot;Molech&quot; discussed above. The inscriptions distinguish between &quot;mlk b&#x27;l&quot; / &quot;mlk ʿdm&quot; (&quot;molk&quot; of a citizen/person) and &quot;mlk ʿmr&quot; (&quot;molk&quot; of a lamb).

Over a hundred tophets have been identified. The earliest examples were established at Carthage, Malta, Motya in western Sicily, and Tharros in southern Sardinia, when the Phoenicians first settled in these areas in the ninth century BCE. The largest known tophet, the Carthage tophet, seems to have been established at this time and continued in use for at least a few decades after the city&#x27;s destruction in 146 BCE. The stone markers first appeared at Salammbô, Carthage around 650 BCE and spread to Motya and Tharros around 600 BCE. Between the fifth and third centuries BCE, tophets became more common in southern Sardinia and the Carthaginian hinterland as Phoenician settlement expanded. In Sicily and Sardinia, tophets slowly went out of use in the third and second centuries BCE, following the establishment of Roman control in the First Punic War. In the same period in North Africa, many new tophets were established, mainly inland in Tunisia. Many of these tophets remained in use after the fall of Carthage in 146 BCE. In the late first and second centuries CE, migration resulting from military deployment patterns led to establishing new tophets in Tunisia and eastern Algeria. In the Roman period, inscriptions named the god to which the monuments were dedicated as Saturn. In addition to infants, some of these tophets contain offerings only of goats, sheep, birds, or plants; many of the worshipers have Libyan rather than Punic names. Their use appears to have declined in the second and third centuries CE.

===Greco-Roman sources===
Greco-Roman sources frequently criticize the Carthaginians for engaging in child sacrifice. The earliest references to the practice are bare references in Sophocles and the Pseudo-Platonic dialogue, &quot;Minos&quot;, probably of the fourth century BCE. The late fourth century BCE philosopher Theophrastus claimed that the Syracusan tyrant Gelon had demanded that the Carthaginians abandon the practice after he defeated them in the Battle of Himera (480 BC).

The first detailed account comes from Cleitarchus, an early third-century BCE historian of Alexander the Great, who is quoted by a scholiast as saying:
 Phoenicians, and above all Carthaginians, worship Kronos; if they wish to achieve something big, they devote a child of theirs, and in the case of success, sacrifice it to the god. There is a bronze statue of Kronos among them, which stands upright with open arms and palms of its hands facing upwards above a bronze brazier on which the child is burnt. When the flames reach the body, the victim&#x27;s limbs stiffen and the tense mouth almost seems like it is laughing until, with a final spasm, the child falls in the brazier.Cleitarchus &quot;FGrH&quot; no. 137, F 9

The first century BCE Greek historian Diodorus Siculus writes that, when the Carthaginians were besieged by Agathocles of Syracuse in 310 BCE, the Carthaginians responded by sacrificing large numbers of children according to an old custom they had abandoned:
They also alleged that Kronos had turned against them inasmuch as in former times they had been accustomed to sacrifice to this god the noblest of their sons, but more recently, secretly buying and nurturing children, they had sent these to the sacrifice; and when an investigation was made, some of those who had been sacrificed were discovered to have been substituted by stealth. ... In their zeal to make amends for the omission, they selected two hundred of the noblest children and sacrificed them publicly; and others who were under suspicion sacrificed themselves voluntarily, in number not less than three hundred. There was in the city a bronze image of Kronos, extending its hands, palms up and sloping towards the ground, so that each of the children when placed thereon rolled down and fell into a sort of gaping pit filled with fire. Elsewhere in the Bibliotheca Diodorus claims that wealthy Carthaginians would purchase infant slaves to offer in lieu of their own children.

The writer Plutarch (c. 46–120 CE) also mentions the practice:
Several Christian authors allude to the practice in the early centuries CE. The Christian apologist Tertullian, about 200 CE, states that although the priests who sacrificed children had been crucified by a Roman procurator, &quot;that holy crime persists in secret&quot;. Another Christian writer, Minucius Felix, claims that Punic women aborted their children as a form of sacrifice.

===Controversy===
The degree and existence of Carthaginian child sacrifice is controversial. Some archaeologists and historians argue that the literary and archaeological evidence indicates that all remains in the tophets were sacrificed. Sabatino Moscati and other scholars have argued that the tophets were cemeteries for premature or short-lived infants who died naturally and then were ritually offered.

The account given by the Greco-Roman authors is questionable. They were not eye-witnesses, contradict each other on how the children were killed, and describe children older than infants being killed as opposed to the infants found in the tophets. The archaeological evidence is not consistent with the mechanical statue of Cronus mentioned by Cleitarchus and Diodorus. There are no references to child sacrifice in Greco-Roman accounts of the Punic Wars, which are better documented than the earlier periods in which mass child sacrifice is claimed. Many, but not all, Greco-Roman authors were hostile to the Carthaginians because they had been enemies in the Sicilian and Punic Wars and this may have influenced their presentation of the practice. Matthew McCarty argues that, even if the Greco-Roman testimonies are inaccurate &quot;even the most fantastical slanders rely upon a germ of fact&quot;.

The archaeological evidence is ambiguous. An osteological study of the remains at Carthage by Jeffrey Schwartz et al. suggested 38% of a sample of 540 individuals had died before or during childbirth, based on the size of the bones, the development of teeth, and the absence of neonatal lines on teeth. Another osteological study of the same material challenged these findings, arguing that it had not taken account of the shrinkage of the bones caused by the burning process. The form of the deposits in tophets is different from Carthaginian graves for non-infants, which usually took the form of burials, not cremations. Phoenician grave goods are also different from the objects found with the human remains in tophets. However, cross-culturally, funerary practices for infants often differ from those for non-infants.

Many archaeologists argue that the ancient authors and the evidence of the Tophet indicates that all remains in the Tophet must have been sacrificed. Others argue that only some infants were sacrificed. Paolo Xella argues that &quot;the principle of Occam&#x27;s Razor&quot; indicates that the weight of classical and biblical sources indicate that the sacrifices occurred. He further argues that the number of children in the tophet is far smaller than the rate of natural infant mortality. In Xella&#x27;s estimation, prenatal remains at the tophet are probably those of children who were promised to be sacrificed but died before birth, but who were nevertheless offered as a sacrifice in fulfillment of a vow. He concludes that
The legendary death of Carthage&#x27;s first queen Elissa (Dido) by immolation, as well as the deaths of Hamilcar and the wife of Hasdrubal the Boetharch in the same manner, has been connected to the tophet ritual by some scholars. It is possible that the practice was more frequent in the earlier years of the city.

<doc id="914517" wikidata="Q1321950" url="?curid=914517" title="Odyssey of the Mind">
<text>Odyssey of the Mind, abbreviated OM or OotM, is a creative problem-solving program where team members present their solution at a competition to a predefined long-term problem that takes many months to complete and involves writing, design, construction, and theatrical performance. A spontaneous portion of the competition has the team also generate solutions to a problem they have not seen before.

In 1999, Odyssey of the Mind was split into separate creative problem solving contests. This split was due to legal dispute over the non-profit status of the organization. The settlement essentially created two new entities: the nonprofit OM Association and the for-profit Creative Competitions. The OM Association started a new but similar creative tournament called Destination ImagiNation. 

Odyssey of the Mind is a trademark of Creative Competitions. Competitions are administered by a mixture of regional non-profit associations and the for-profit Creative Competitions corporation.

== History ==

The Odyssey of the Mind program was co-founded by C. Samuel Micklus and Theodore Gourley in 1978 at Glassboro State College (now Rowan University) in Glassboro, New Jersey. The first competition, known as &quot;Olympics of the Mind&quot;, involved teams from 28 New Jersey schools. The program is now international, with teams from Argentina, Australia, Belarus, Canada, China, Czech Republic, DODDS, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, Lithuania, Mexico, Moldova, Poland, Romania, Russia, Singapore, Slovakia, South Korea, Switzerland, Togo, the United Kingdom, and Uzbekistan, regularly competing in addition to teams from the United States.

== Organization ==
Odyssey of the Mind teams are divided into four divisions:
*Division I — Grades 3–5 (U.S.): Less than 12 years of age on May 1 of the competition year (Other International).
*Division II — Grades 6–8 (U.S.): Less than 15 years of age on May 1 of the competition year (Other International).
*Division III — Grades 9–12 (U.S.): Oldest team member does not qualify for Divisions I or II and is attending regular school—not a college or university or anything similar (Other International).
*Division IV — Collegiate for all teams. All team members must have a high school diploma or its equivalent and be enrolled in at least one course at a two- or four-year college or university.

The oldest team member determines the team&#x27;s division.

There is also a non-competitive primary division for young children (grades K–2 U.S.), who are given a simplified problem and fewer constraints than the higher divisions. They present and are given feedback at the first level tournament and cannot advance, except for special occasions where officials invite a team to perform again at the state level.

Teams are limited to a maximum of seven team members.

In the United States, each participating state has its own Odyssey association. Most states are further broken down into regions. Teams compete at the regional level first. The highest-scoring teams progress to the state level. In the U.S. there is no national level. State-winning teams go directly to the World Finals, which have always been held in the U.S., usually at the end of May.

== Event structure ==

===Long-term problems===
There are five categories of problems that participants can solve:
*Vehicle: building vehicles of different sizes to perform specified tasks.
*Technical: building “innovative contraptions”.
*Classics: incorporates knowledge of architecture, art, and literature; can be a documentary or behind-the-scenes feature.
*Structure: designing and building a structure using only balsa wood and glue to support the highest weight load 
*Performance: acting, singing, and/or dancing based on a given theme

In addition to its main category, a problem may involve techniques from other categories. For example, acting is prevalent in solutions to all five problems, and a team can usually earn bonus points by throwing in knowledge of history into a non-Classics problem or technology in a non-Tech problem.

Specifications differ between problems, but there are some crucial rules. The Outside Assistance rule heavily stresses that every aspect of a solution must result from the work of the team; parents and coaches must restrict themselves to supervising safety and encouraging focus. Something as simple as a mother adjusting her child&#x27;s hat prior to competition is considered outside assistance, with a score penalty. Thus all brainstorming, building, painting, sewing, and fixing are to be done by the team.

For each long-term problem, the team must present its solution in eight minutes or less, including set-up time, and the total cost of all materials used must either be under the specified Cost Limit of $125 or $145. The rules require participants to push their thinking capacities to make best use of their skills, time, and money.

A new problem for each category is presented every year on the official Odyssey of the Mind website. Most years, one problem is sponsored by Arm &amp; Hammer.

==== Cost limit ====
There is a cost limit on the value of all materials used in the presentation of the long-term solution. This limit is typically US$125–145, where the classical, performance, and primary problems have a limit of $125, while the vehicle, technical, and structural problems have a limit of $145. As of the 2006–2007 rules update, some materials have a set assigned value. Some examples include computers and most audio-visual equipment (projectors, radios, televisions, music players, etc.). The suggested cost to write these items down as is anywhere between $5–$10. Still other materials are simply exempt from cost. This includes batteries and power cords, footwear, tables and chairs. All of these materials, even the exempt ones, must be listed on the cost form. The judges check this list to make sure that the team is within the cost limit and following the appropriate assigned values and exemptions.

==== Style ====
&quot;Style&quot; is a component of long-term problems where teams are scored on specific elements of their presentation. There are five elements scored in style. Often, two of these elements are specified in the problem, the other two are then &quot;free choice of team&quot; elements, and the fifth is a score of how well the other elements contribute to the performance overall. The pre-specified elements are related to the problem in some way; they are typically something to do with the appearance of a vehicle, costume, or prop. The free choice items may be anything the team wishes as long as they are not already scored as part of the long-term solution or pre-specified elements. Each element is scored from 1–10, accounting for 50 points of the overall score.

===Spontaneous===
As the name suggests, teams do not know ahead of time the topic they are to compete in. At the tournament, individual teams enter the competition room and are presented with one of three problem types: verbal, hands-on, or verbal/hands-on.

In verbal problems, teams are usually given a minute to think and then two to three minutes to respond to a theme such as &quot;make a rhyme using a name or species of an animal&quot;. Teams will then be graded based on the creativity of their individual responses. For instance, &quot;there is a dog on a log&quot; is a common answer which would earn the team one point, while &quot;I can step on an ant, but an uncle I can&#x27;t&quot; involves word play, a creative response that is worth 3 or 5 points. Verbal problems encourage individuals to incorporate their knowledge of history, science, literature, and popular culture.

Hands-on problems focus on teamwork and the ability to listen to complicated directions. Teams will usually be instructed to build something based on the limited materials given, such as a freestanding tower using a few sheets of paper, some paper clips, a pair of scissors, and a piece of tape. The team with the tallest tower and the best teamwork earns the most points. In OM, if the rules do not say that something cannot be done, then it can; in other words, participants are encouraged to search for creative, outside-the-box solutions.

A hybrid, or verbal/hands-on, problem has aspects of both types, typically either a verbal problem that involves manipulation of physical objects or a two-part problem: build something in part 1, and provide verbal responses with it in part 2.

=== Scoring ===
Each team is given a score out of 350 points: 200 from Long-term, 100 from Spontaneous, and 50 from Style. Style is scored from 1–10 in each of the five categories, and the Long-term and Spontaneous problems are scored according to each problem&#x27;s individual rules. The scores awarded are then scaled within each problem and division based upon the highest score achieved by any team in each of the three scoring categories. For instance, the team scoring highest in Long-term in a particular problem and division receives 200 points, and the scores for the other teams in that problem and division are scaled proportionately. A team ranking first in its problem and division in all three elements of the competition would thus receive a &quot;perfect&quot; score of 350 points, regardless of the actual raw scores assigned by the judges.

The Ranatra Fusca Creativity Award is granted to teams who have demonstrated exceptional creativity, the essence of the Odyssey of the Mind program. Winning the award at the regional or state level will qualify a team to advance to the next level of competition, even if the team had not placed high enough to advance on their own.

== World Finals ==
All teams who advance from their state finals, or their national finals if they are from outside of the US, are invited to World Finals. World Finals is the culmination of the entire year of Odyssey of the Mind.
*2025 - Michigan State University - May 21-25. 
* 2024 - Iowa State University May 21 - 24.
* 2023 - Michigan State University May 24-27.
* 2022 - Iowa State University May 25-28.
* 2021 - Orange County Convention Center, Orlando, Florida, June 11 – 13.
* 2020 – Held virtually because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

A variety of non-competitive activities are provided at World Finals; the representative one is pin trading, in which participants trade pins from their regions and states with participants from other states and countries. There is a creativity festival where each state/country runs a booth containing a fun activity related to their state. The highlights of World Finals are the opening and closing ceremonies. These ceremonies are held Olympics-style in a stadium on campus. Teams march in and sit with other competitors from their state. After the closing ceremonies, several parties are held for different age groups and a party is held for the coaches. These parties are a reward for all the hard work that teams have put in.

The float and banner parade is another fun event that happens on the Thursday night of the World Finals. It is a parade in which every state and country participating makes a float and/or a banner to represent their state.

The coaches&#x27; competition is another event that is put on during World Finals. The competition is only for coaches and is more along the lines of a spontaneous problem than a long-term problem. The coaches get the problem in advance and have time to prepare. They hand out awards to the first, second, and third place coaches.

<text>The Pacifist Socialist Party (, PSP) was a democratic socialist political party in the Netherlands. It is one of the predecessors of GroenLinks.

==Party history==

===Before 1957===
In 1955, a group of &quot;politically homeless&quot; activists had formed. The group mainly consisted of former members of the Labour Party (PvdA) and the Communist Party of the Netherlands (CPN). They had left the PvdA over the military intervention against the Indonesian independence movement and the Labour party&#x27;s support for NATO. Many of them had a background in the orthodox Marxist wing of the Social Democratic Workers&#x27; Party or the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), which had merged into the PvdA. The former members of the CPN had left their party over the Stalinist course of the CPN. There was also a group of these politically homeless that had never been members of parties, while others had been member of pre-war parties such as the Independent Socialist Party.

These politically homeless individuals were a diverse group: progressive Christians, orthodox Marxists, Trotskyists, liberal pacifists and some anarchists. Many of them were active in the developing peace movement.

The party was sceptic of both the Eastern bloc and Western bloc. They were oriented at a third camp between Stalinist communism and western capitalism.

In 1956, the group asked the PvdA to put two candidates of these politically homeless on their list for the next elections, one on a &#x27;safe&#x27; electable position on their candidate list and one that would need to be elected by preference votes. These candidates would have an independent position in parliament. The PvdA, although originally sympathetic to the idea rejected this. Thus the group felt forced to found its own party and it founded the Action group for the formation of a Party on Anti-militarist and Socialist principles in November 1956. It would chart the possibilities of a new political party.

===1957–1971===

On 26 January 1957, the PSP was founded by the Action group. The first year was devoted to the organisation of the party and the preparation for the elections which were expected to be in 1960. The party sought to expand its membership, its branches and its electoral support. The founders were joined by members of the Socialist Union, a group which had split unsuccessfully from the PvdA in 1950. In 1958, it entered in the provincial elections and it won two seats in the North Holland provincial legislative. In the 1959 elections the party won two seats in the House of Representatives.

In the early years, the party became known for its parliamentary and extra-parliamentary opposition against the rising Cold War, and especially the placement of nuclear weapons. The socialist revolution in Cuba and uprisings against the South African system of Apartheid led to considerable debate within the party between groups who opposed all violence and groups who opposed repressive violence (from the ruling class) and supported liberating violence (against the ruling class). In 1961, the party threw off its principled pacifism and advocated the minimization of violence. Extra-parliamentary action against colonialism also became more important; the party supported New Guinean and Algerian independence.

In the 1963 elections, the party performed particularly well. It doubled its seats to four. This success can be attributed to several developments: the rising opposition to the Cold War, the party&#x27;s appeal to the developing students&#x27; movement and especially the anarchist Provo movement, for whom the PSP was the only acceptable party, and finally the CPN&#x27;s internal conflicts – in 1958 three MPs had left the CPN and formed their own parliamentary party, led by Henk Gortzak, called the &quot;Bridge Group&quot; (Dutch: ) and unsuccessfully competed in the 1959 elections. The group subsequently founded the Socialist Workers&#x27; Party (Dutch: ; SWP). This internal dissent had caused the CPN to fall to only one seat in the 1963 elections.

In the mid-1960s, the Vietnam War became an important issue. The PSP was heavily involved in opposition against the American intervention. It was the first party to pay attention to the war and it was involved in the organisation of demonstrations, rallies and teach ins. The monarchy also became an issue as Crown Princess Beatrix would marry Claus von Amsberg in 1966. The PSP used this opportunity to voice its support for a republican constitution. In the same year the CPN-dissenters of the SWP joined the PSP. The PSP held on to its four seats in the 1967 election. In 1969 Gortzak, previously leader of the SWP returned as MP: now for the PSP.

===1971–1981===

The 1970s were characterized by internal conflicts between moderate and more radical members of the PSP. The most important reason for this was the radicalization within the PvdA. A new, more radical, generation had gained power in the PvdA. They wanted to form a majority cabinet with only leftwing parties. To achieve this they formed the Progressive Accord with the new left-liberal Democrats 66 and the progressive Christian PPR. The PSP also participated in these talks but broke off, because the majority of the PSP congress thought this alliance was neither pacifist nor socialist. The cooperative minority clashed strongly with the isolationist majority. In the 1971 elections, the party lost two of its four seats, while the PvdA won seats.

In 1972, the party&#x27;s political leader, Hans Wiebenga (1917–2005) was replaced by the younger Bram van der Lek, who emphasized the environment as an important issue. He was unable to win seats in the 1972 elections. As party leader he would embrace extra-parliamentary protest of all kinds of groups: the PSP was involved in the nascent environmental, squatting, women&#x27;s and students&#x27; movements.

Both the moderates and the most radicals left the party. Until 1974, a Trotskyist group, the Proletarian Left, led by Erik Meijer, now MEP for the Socialist Party operated within the party because they wanted to use the PSP to electrify the masses. In 1974 nearly all of them (except for their leader Meijer) left the party to found what later became the group Socialist Alternative Politics. In 1975 the moderate so called &quot;progressive cooperatives&quot; left the party. Many members of them joined the PvdA.

Starting in 1975, the party membership exhibited strong growth and doubled in the next five years. Nevertheless, the 1977 elections were disastrous: the party lost all but one seat – this is attributed to the political competition between the social-democratic prime minister Joop den Uyl and his Christian democratic competitor Dries van Agt, which caused many PSP-sympathizers to vote for Den Uyl. The internal dissent within the party also damaged its popular appeal. After one year Van der Lek left parliament, and he was replaced by Fred van der Spek.

===1981–1989===

In the early 1980s, the placement of American nuclear weapons became an important political issue. The PSP was involved in the organisation of national demonstrations against nuclear weapons and more than 80% of the members of the PSP attended one of the two mass protests against the placement nuclear weapons of 1981 and 1983. In the 1981 election the PSP was rewarded for its principled opposition: it won three seats. In the subsequent 1982 election it kept its seats. The party membership nearly reached 10,000 in this period.

Since the 1980s, the party began to cooperate more with the PPR, which had broken with the PvdA, and the CPN, which had destalinized. It cooperated mainly in municipal and provincial elections and legislatures, because a higher percentage of votes is necessary to gain seats in such elections. At the 1984 European Parliament election, the PPR, CPN and PSP formed the &quot;Green Progressive Accord&quot; that entered with one joint list. They won one seat, which rotated between the PSP and PPR. Party members also met each other in grassroots extraparliamentary protest against nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. The cooperation led to internal conflicts. Before the election of 1986 the CPN and the PPR wanted to form an electoral alliance with the PSP. This led to a crisis within the party: chair of the parliamentary party, Fred van der Spek who opposed cooperation was replaced by the party congress by Andrée van Es, who favoured cooperation. Van der Spek founded his own Party for Socialism and Disarmament (Dutch: &quot;Party voor Socialisme en Ontwapening&quot;; PSvO). The 1986 PSP congress however still rejected cooperation. In the elections of 1986 nuclear weapons were no longer an issue: the party was left with only one seat. The membership of the party rapidly declined. The pressure to cooperate increased.

===After 1989===

In 1989, the PSP initiated talks with the PPR and the CPN. Their initiative was supported by an open letter from members of trade unions, environmental movements and the arts which called for one progressive formation left of the PvdA. After long negotiations, which were pressured by the fall of the Second cabinet Lubbers and the subsequent earlier elections, the party entered in the 1989 elections as part of GreenLeft. Andrée van Es was second on the list. In 1991, the PSP dissolved itself into GreenLeft. In 1992, a group of former PSP-members who had refused to join GreenLeft formed the PSP&#x27;92.

The PSP made a considerable mark on GreenLeft, although it has moderated its pacifism and socialism. Especially the progressive, tolerant and non-dogmatic ideals of the PSP still play an important role. MPs Kees Vendrik, Ineke van Gent and Leo Platvoet were active within the party, as was MEP Joost Lagendijk.

==Ideology and issues==

===Ideology===

The party&#x27;s ideology was based on pacifism, socialism, and democracy. These three values were united by human rights. In war, capitalism, and dictatorship human rights are infringed.

In its 1957 manifesto of principles, the PSP advocated two major societal renewals: Firstly, a spiritual renewal, which sought to replace a society based on fear, division and power with a society based on trust, unity and justice – this reflected the party&#x27;s pacifism. Secondly, an economic renewal, which sought to replace a society based on classes by a classless society. This reflected the party&#x27;s socialism. The PSP furthermore advocated a democratic political system and a democratic economy, it rejected the use of violence to solve international conflicts and it proposed a federal world state in which wealth would be shared by both the former colonizing powers and their former colonies.

In the 1970s and 1980s, new issues were incorporated into the PSP&#x27;s ideology: women&#x27;s liberation, gay rights, and environmentalism.

===Issues===
These radical principles are reflected in the party&#x27;s concern for a democratic socialist economy, a pacifist foreign policy, a directly democratic political system, and a feminization of society.

The PSP advocated a democratic socialist society where government planning and workers&#x27; self-management played an important role:
*The party advocated the nationalisation of major parts of the economy, including banks, transport companies, basic industries and construction. These government companies should be controlled by the workers;
*In other economic sectors such as agriculture, should make more use of cooperatives;
*The government has to plan the economic development of the Netherlands and control the development of prices and profits;
*The PSP wanted to attain full employment by decreasing working time, lowering the pensionable age to 60, extending obligatory school attendance to 18 and increasing part time work;
*Through progressive taxation, which would have to be almost 100% after 50,000 euros (then 100,000 guilders), incomes should be made more equal;
*The PSP advocated government ownership of all the land, which could then be rented by companies;
*The party wanted to increase the rights of tenants and squatters and take government action against unoccupied buildings;
*The PSP opposed the use of nuclear energy and advocated investing in alternative energy sources;
*The party wanted to invest in public transport, which would be owned by the government;
*Environmental protection was an important issue for the party. It wanted to put the burden of environmental protection on companies and it opposed direct eco-taxes, which would have a regressive effect.

The PSP advocated an anti-militarist and socialist foreign policy:
*The party opposed the placement of nuclear weapons in the Netherlands;
*The PSP wanted to withdraw from NATO;
*It wanted to dissolve the Dutch army in time: until that time the rights of conscientious objectors should be protected and the Dutch arms industry should be dissolved;
*The party opposed the European Economic Community, which undermined the ability of the government to plan its own economy;
*The PSP advocated increased trade with Second World and Third World countries. Third World countries should also receive more development aid, with fewer restrictions.

On the national level, the party advocated radical democratization of society and protection of civil rights:
*It proposed decentralization of government services and direct democracy at the municipal level;
*The party sought to abolish the Senate and double the number of seats in the House of Representatives;
*The PSP wanted to abolish the position of head of state, and with that the Dutch Monarchy, positions like Queen&#x27;s Commissioner and mayor should also be abolished;
*It wanted to lower the age limit for voting rights and extend voting rights for migrants;
*The PSP opposed undemocratic institutions, especially when they endangered the civil rights of citizens, it sought to abolish the secret service and private security companies;
*The party wanted to protect the rights of convicts.

The PSP wanted to radically feminize society, liberate other oppressed groups and democratize society:
*The party wanted to better the position of women: it advocated free child care, the legalization of abortion and part time work for both partners. It sought to make social security arrangements individual instead of family oriented;
*It advocated the rights of sexual minorities: equal rights for same-sex partnerships and legalization of transvestism;
*It supported the 1979 petition to lower the age of consent to the age of 12
*The PSP paid special attention to the position of minority cultures and languages in the Netherlands such as West Frisian;
*The party advocated the democratization of schools and universities, better protection of the rights of students, smaller class sizes, and more room for experimentation and alternative education. The party opposed religious schools;
*The PSP sought to ban all casinos and smoking in public buildings on the one side, but it also advocated the legalisation of soft drugs and government controlled supply of hard drugs;
*The party was opposed to any form of discrimination and sought to expand the rights of migrants;
*It sought to legalize of prostitution and increase the protection of prostitutes;
*The PSP favoured individual choice for euthanasia;
*It wanted to democratize hospitals, better protect rights for patients and create one healthcare insurance system for all.

==Representation==
This table shows the PSP&#x27;s results in elections to the House of Representatives (HoR), Senate (S), European Parliament (EP), States-Provincial (SP) and municipalities (M), as well as the party&#x27;s political leadership: the fractievoorzitter is the chair of the parliamentary party and the lijsttrekker is the party&#x27;s top candidate in the general election. These posts are normally taken by the party&#x27;s leader. The membership of PSP and the party chair is also represented.

(a): elected on combined PSP/PvdA/PPR lists
(b): elected on combined PSP/CPN, PSP/PPR or PSP/CPN/PPR lists (estimate)
(c): PSvO split from the PSP
(d): cooperating in GreenLeft parliamentary parties.

===Municipal and Provincial Government===
The PSP had a provincial stronghold in North Holland, which gave the party more than half of its vote.

It had some municipal strongholds in the Zaanstreek and Amsterdam, but also in some cities, where it had particularly strong branches, such as Midwoud, Bussum, Hoorn and Goirle. Because of its isolated position it did not supply many aldermen, though between 1974 and 1975 its supplied one Amsterdam alderman.

In the following figure one can see the election results of the provincial election of 1962 per province. It shows the areas where the PSP was strong, namely the urban areas like North Holland and South Holland. The party was weaker in rural Catholic provinces like Limburg and North Brabant, but also strong in the rural traditional socialist strongholds such as rural Groningen and Friesland.

==Electorate==
The party&#x27;s electorate was very heterogeneous, although most voters could be seen as intellectuals, students, scientists, artists, while most socialist parties are oriented at workers. The party was a refuge for people who no longer felt at home in the social-democratic PvdA and the Communist Party of the Netherlands. It was supported by progressive Christians, especially Mennonites. Most of its voters lived in Amsterdam or Rotterdam.

The electorate of the PSP fluctuated; the changing appeal of the PvdA and the CPN played a role, as did the events of the Cold War. The rise of youth movements, like Provo, and the Vietnam war boosted the electorate of the party in the 1960s. Internal conflicts in the PSP and radical course of the social-democratic PvdA cost the PSP votes in the 1970s. The mass demonstrations against the placement of nuclear weapons boosted the party&#x27;s support in the early 1980s.

==Organisation==

===Organisational structure===
The highest organ of the PSP was the congress, formed by delegates from the municipal branches. It convened once every year. It appointed the party board and decided the order of the Senate, House of Representatives and European Parliament candidate lists and had the final say over the party program. For the months that the congress did not convene, a party council took over its role. It consisted out of representatives of all the municipal branches.

The party board consisted of 10 members: a party chair, general secretary, treasurer, political secretary, parliamentary secretary, international secretary, youth secretary, education secretary, the secretary for propaganda and a chair for the committee for radio and television.

===Linked organisations===
The PSP published its own magazine which was called &quot;Liberation&quot; (Dutch: ) between 1957 and 1966 and 1978 and 1991 and &quot;Radical: Weekly for Socialism and Peace&quot; (Dutch: ) between 1967 and 1977. It was printed at the PSPs own printing company also called Liberation.

The PSPs youth was organised in the Pacifist Socialist Young Working Groups (Dutch: , PSJG) between 1977 and 1991. Between 1985 and 1991 the PSJG became more independent as it saw itself as the youth organisation of both the PSP and the PSvO which had split from the party. It published (the title is a pun as it means both strongly against violence as strong counter-violence) and &quot;Disaster&quot; (Dutch: , which spells PSP). In 1991 the PSJG merged into DWARS GreenLeft youth, which continued publishing Disaster until 1995.

In the 1980s the scientific institute of the PSP cooperated strongly with the scientific institutes of the PPR and CPN. They published &quot;De Helling&quot; together since 1985. The &quot;Rode Draad&quot; was published since 1985 it was a magazine for municipal and provincial councillors the PSP, PPR and CPN.

===Relationships to other parties===
For a long time the party refused to cooperate with other parties and preferred a position of testimonial party, which resembles the position of the Dutch orthodox Protestant parties, like the Political Reformed Party. The PSP&#x27;s members of parliament, although isolated because of their radical position, were often respected across all parties for their principled position, commitment, rhetoric abilities and demeanour.

Between 1956 and 1981 it was at &quot;cold war&quot; with the Communist Party of the Netherlands as many former communists had joined the PSP&#x27;s ranks. The PSP was highly critical of the CPN&#x27;s Stalinist course. After 1981 the CPN, which had destalinized and PSP, began to cooperate more closely. The Christian left Political Party of Radicals and the Evangelical People&#x27;s Party were also dismissed by the PSP as too supportive of the PvdA and too moderate on important issues. After 1981 the PPR broke its links with the PvdA and became more oriented toward PSP and CPN. In the 1980s the four parties began to cooperate in municipal and European elections, because fewer seats can be won there. In 1989 this intensive cooperation led to the formation of a new party, the GreenLeft.

The party was originally sympathetic to the Labour Party PvdA. Before the party was founded, the group of politically homeless activists had asked to have an independent candidate on their lists. During the 1960s the relation deteriorated, as the PSP rejected the PvdA&#x27;s moderate course and the PvdA the PSP&#x27;s radical course. In 1971 the PvdA, which had become more leftwing under pressure of a new generation of party members, opened the door to the PSP. It wanted the PSP to cooperate in the Progressive Accords together with left-liberal Democrats 66 and the PPR. The PSP rejected as it felt these accords would be neither socialist nor pacifist. This decision let to considerable upheaval within the party. In the 1980s as the PvdA became more centrist, the PSP rejected the PvdA even more.

<text>Guy Warren Ballard (July 28, 1878 – December 29, 1939) was an American mining engineer who, with his wife Edna Anne Wheeler Ballard, founded the &quot;I AM&quot; Activity.

Ballard was born in Newton, Kansas and married his wife in Chicago in 1916. Ballard served in the U.S. Army in World War I, and then became a mining engineer. Both Edna and Guy studied Theosophy and the occult extensively.

==Revelation==

Living at the base of the California volcano Mount Shasta in 1930, Ballard frequently hiked on the mountain, where he reported the following to have occurred.It came time for lunch, and I sought a mountain spring for clear, cold water. Cup in hand, I bent down to fill it, when an electrical current passed through my body from head to foot.

   I looked around, and directly behind me stood a young man who, at first glance, seemed to be someone on a hike like myself. I looked more closely and realized immediately that he was no ordinary person. As this thought passed through my mind, he smiled and addressed me saying:

   &quot;My Brother, if you will hand me your cup, I will give you a much more refreshing drink than spring water.&quot; I obeyed, and instantly the cup was filled with a creamy liquid. Handing it back to me, he said: &quot;Drink it.&quot;The young man later identified himself as the Count of St. Germain. Ballard provided details of his encounters with St. Germain and other Ascended Masters in the books &quot;Unveiled Mysteries&quot; and &quot;The Magic Presence&quot;, using the pen name Godfré Ray King.

Guy Ballard, his wife Edna, and their son Edona Eros &quot;Donald&quot; Ballard (1918-1973) claimed to be the sole &quot;accredited messengers&quot; of Saint Germain. Their teachings constitute the original nucleus of what are today called the &quot;Ascended Master Teachings&quot; and are still used in &quot;I AM&quot; Sanctuaries all over the world.

==Activity==

The &quot;I AM&quot; Activity started from public lectures about these encounters and grew rapidly in the 1930s. Ballard lectured frequently in Chicago about Saint Germain&#x27;s mystical teachings, in which America was destined to play a key role. By 1938, there were claimed to be about a million followers in the United States. In 1942, they began the I AM Sanctuary at a Presbyterian missionary school.

The &quot;I AM&quot; Activity describes itself as an apolitical, spiritual, and educational organization financed by contributions from its members. Its parent organization is Saint Germain Foundation, with headquarters in Schaumburg, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago.

The &quot;I AM&quot; Activity began after Mr. Ballard&#x27;s alleged meeting with Saint Germain, an Ascended Master, whose experiences are outlined in Volume One of the Saint Germain Series of Books, &quot;Unveiled Mysteries&quot;, published by the Saint Germain Press. The year was 1930 when Mr. Ballard met Saint Germain according to the SaintGermainFoundation.Org website.

==Deaths of Ballard and his wife==

Ballard died on 29 December 1939 and Edna Ballard died on 12 February 1971. A new dispensation was reputedly given so that the &quot;ascension&quot; could be gained (in the finer body) without taking the physical body, as Jesus had done. The &quot;ascended master bodies&quot; were reputedly already prepared for Ballard and Edna Ballard as noted in &quot;Unveiled Mysteries&quot; by Godfre Ray King (the pen name of Guy Ballard). It is reported that both Ballards ascended upon passing out of the physical body. Godfre Ray King has also reputedly given dictations through Edna Ballard (under the pen name of &quot;Lotus Ray King&quot;). Given the &quot;I AM&quot; Activity, old occult laws have been replaced including the teaching of Theosophy that, to become a master, a person would have had to ascend upon death to the fifth level of initiation.

Adherents of the Ascended Master Teachings believe that Guy Ballard became the &quot;Ascended Master Godfre&quot; after his death, and that his previous incarnations include Richard the Lionheart and George Washington. They also believe that Edna Ballard became the &quot;Ascended Lady Master Lotus&quot;, with previous incarnations including Joan of Arc, Elizabeth I of England, and Benjamin Franklin.

<text>The Cadillac Catera is a four-door, five passenger, rear-wheel drive luxury sedan marketed from 1996 until 2001 by Cadillac over a single generation in the United States, Canada and GCC. As a rebadged variant of the Opel Omega B, the Catera was manufactured by Opel in Rüsselsheim, Germany, and was underpinned by GM&#x27;s V-body platform. Approximately 95,000 units were built and sold over five model years.

==History==

The Catera was previewed at the Detroit Auto Show in 1994 as the Cadillac LSE concept, proposed by Cadillac as an entry-level model that would compete with sedans from Acura, BMW, Infiniti, Lexus, Jaguar, Volvo, and Mercedes-Benz. 

In 1996, an early-production model was shown at the Detroit, Montreal, Vancouver, and Toronto auto shows. Cadillac began marketing the Catera in the United States in the fall of 1996 as a 1997 model with a base price of $29,995 ().

Some of the standard features on the Catera included a cloth interior, front bucket seats, dual-zone automatic climate control, AM/FM stereo radio with cassette player and eight-speaker sound system, airbags, anti-lock brakes, traction control, keyless entry, security system, alloy wheels, compact spare tire, and full instrumentation. Optional equipment included leather interior, heated seats, cassette player and CD player combination, Bose premium sound system, power sunroof, Homelink, OnStar, and chrome wheels.

A &quot;Sport&quot; model was offered beginning in 1999 with eight-way power adjustable seats, heated front seats, 17-inch wheels, driver&#x27;s seat memory, audible theft-deterrent system, three-channel garage door opener, high-intensity discharge headlamps, and a rear spoiler. 

The Catera received a facelift in 2000 with revised nose, tail, wheels, interior trim, mirrors, optional HID headlamps, stiffer suspension settings, and side airbags.

The model&#x27;s engine was a &quot;L81&quot; 54° DOHC V6 manufactured in England at GM&#x27;s Ellesmere Port facility, using an FR layout. The GM 4L30-E automatic transmission was manufactured at GM&#x27;s plant in Strasbourg, France.

==Marketing==

Catera launch marketing used the tagline &quot;the Caddy that zigs,&quot; with advertising featuring supermodel Cindy Crawford and a small animated bird named &quot;Ziggy,&quot; a reference to the heraldic &quot;merlettes&quot; (adaptations of the martin, without legs or beaks) featured in the various iterations of Cadillac&#x27;s logo from its inception through 1999. Ziggy was featured in Catera marketing through the 1998 model year, with Cadillac saying: 
In 1997, John Tinker, a producer of television medical drama &quot;Chicago Hope&quot;, was inspired by an inadvertent pun in a Catera commercial, saying &quot;Who is Lisa Catera?&quot;—in response to the Catera tagline &quot;Lease a Catera.&quot; He introduced a character named Dr. Lisa Catera, played by Stacy Edwards. Coincidentally, the main demographic of &quot;Chicago Hope&quot; viewers were exactly the same demographic Cadillac hoped to attract with the Catera, and Cadillac/General Motors management responded extremely positively to the reference, becoming the main advertiser on the show and giving Edwards a complimentary three-year lease on a Catera. In one episode, Edwards&#x27; character said &quot;when you can&#x27;t zig, you zag,&quot; a reference to the Catera&#x27;s original marketing tagline.

==Related vehicles==
In Europe, the platform underpinned the Opel Omega, marketed as an executive car. Rebadged variants of the Omega were marketed worldwide. In addition to the Opel version, the car was sold in Great Britain as the Vauxhall Omega and South America as the Chevrolet Omega. As with the Rekord which preceded it, re-engineered versions of the Omega were manufactured in Australia from 1988 as the Holden Commodore (and its derivatives) since 1999. Commodore-based cars were in turn exported to South America as the Chevrolet Omega and to the Middle East as the Chevrolet Lumina.

A relative of the Catera, utilizing modified version the same Opel platform, continued to be in production until 2006. In the U.S. market, the platform was used for the Pontiac GTO, which was an almost identical derivative of the Holden Monaro coupe. Both were manufactured by GM Holden in Australia. These performance coupes were themselves derived from the sedan platform that originated in the Australian market as the VT-series Holden Commodore in 1997.

<text>Netherbury is a village and civil parish in the English county of Dorset. It lies within the Dorset Council administrative area, by the small River Brit, south of Beaminster and north of Bridport. The A3066 road connecting those towns lies 0.5 miles to the east.

==Population==
In the 2011 census the parish, including the villages of Melplash and Salway Ash, and the small settlements of Atrim, Oxbridge, Waytown, North and South Bowood, Wooth, Silkhay, Mangerton, Whitecross, Filford, Dottery, Hincknowle and Loscombe, had a population of 1,314. Netherbury is within an electoral ward that bears its name and stretches south to the edge of Bridport. The ward population was 2,080.

==Facilities==
Along with domestic buildings, Netherbury village has a church, a village hall, and a play park. The church has a Norman font, a 15th-century altar tomb and a 16th-century pulpit. The hills surrounding the village show examples of strip lynchets.

The River Brit used to serve several mills to process the flax used in Bridport&#x27;s rope-making industry. In Netherbury, the river is crossed by a 17th-century bridge with three dissimilar arches: a larger, round eastern arch accommodated the millrace.

The novelist Mary Anna Needell lived in Netherbury with her family in the 1880s. Kingsland House was the birthplace of Vice-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet (1762–1814).

<doc id="914541" wikidata="Q670967" url="?curid=914541" title="Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset">
<text>Thomas Sackville, 1st Earl of Dorset (153619 April 1608) was an English statesman, poet, and dramatist. He was the son of Richard Sackville, a cousin to Anne Boleyn. He was a Member of Parliament and Lord High Treasurer.

==Biography==
===Early life===

Thomas Sackville was born at Buckhurst, in the parish of Withyham, Sussex. His mother Winifrede was the daughter of Sir John Bridges, Lord Mayor of London. He was educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, where he obtained his M.A., and Hertford College, Oxford. He joined the Inner Temple, and was called to the bar.

===Political career===
He first entered the House of Commons in 1558 as one of the knights of the shire for Westmorland. In 1559 he was elected for East Grinstead, and then in 1563 for Aylesbury.

In 1566 Sackville travelled to Rome, where he was arrested and detained as a prisoner for fourteen days, for reasons not clear, but at the time there was great tension between England and the Papacy. His father died that year and he returned to England. In 1567 he was created Baron Buckhurst, of Buckhurst in the County of Sussex. His first important mission came in 1571, when he was sent to bear Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s congratulations to Charles IX of France on his marriage to Elizabeth of Austria, the daughter of Emperor Maximilian, and more importantly to negotiate the matter of the proposed alliance between Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Anjou, brother of the French king.

In 1572, he was one of the peers who sat on the trial of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk. In 1579 he hosted the Scottish academic Hercules Rollock at Buckhurst Place, and Rollock wrote Latin verses in praise of Sackville and his house.

In 1586 he was selected to convey to Mary, Queen of Scots, the sentence of death confirmed by the English Parliament. In 1587 he went as ambassador to the United Provinces, upon their complaint against the Earl of Leicester; but, although he performed his trust with integrity, the favourite had sufficient influence to get him recalled; and on his return, he was ordered to confinement in his own house, for nine or ten months. He incurred Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s displeasure by what she called his &quot;shallow judgement in diplomacy&quot;. However his disgrace was short, for in 1588 he was presented with the Order of the Garter, and was sent again to the Netherlands in 1589 and 1598.

In 1591, Sackville was elected chancellor of the University of Oxford. In 1599 he succeeded William Cecil, Lord Burghley, as Lord Treasurer, a position he kept until his death, and was a capable, if uninspired, financial manager. In 1601 as high steward he pronounced sentence on the Earl of Essex, who had been his rival for the chancellorship and his opponent in politics.

James I came south from Scotland in 1603 at the Union of the Crowns. Many courtiers travelled to Northamptonshire in June 1603 to greet Anne of Denmark and her children. Sackville wrote on 21 June 1603 that he and the Lord Keeper Thomas Egerton were travelling &quot;to do our duties to the Queen, the Prince, and Princess, all the world flying beforehand to see her&quot;. In August 1603 he was working on the settlement and value of Anne of Denmark&#x27;s jointure lands in England, in part based on that given to Catherine of Aragon. Anne of Denmark sent the finished settlement to her brother Christian IV for his approval.

King James confirmed him in the office of lord treasurer, and in 1604 he was created Earl of Dorset.

In 1604, Sackville bought Groombridge Place in Kent. His other houses included Knole House, in Sevenoaks, Kent, Michelham Priory, in East Sussex, and Dorset House, near Fleet Street, London, later burnt down in the Great Fire of London. Queen Elizabeth acquired the manor of Bexhill in 1570 and granted it to Sackville. He was also the last Sackville to be lord of the manor of Bergholt Sackville (named after the Sackville family) and Mount Bures in Essex, which he sold in 1578 to one Alice Dister. Both properties had been in the Sackville family for 459 years. In August 1605 Dorset recommended &quot;Mr Thorpe&quot; to survey and make &quot;plots&quot; for the rebuilding of Ampthill for Anne of Denmark and Prince Henry.

In April 1607 he wrote to George More of Loseley asking him to influence the Countess of Cumberland to arrange the marriage of her daughter Lady Anne Clifford to his grandson Richard Sackville. In June 1607, when Sackville was ill, James Hay of the king&#x27;s bedchamber, visited him and brought the king&#x27;s gift of a ring with set with diamonds and the message that he hoped Sackville would wear the ring and &quot;live as long as the diamonds of that ring ... did endure&quot;. He recovered from the bout of illness and wrote his will in August, but died on 19 April 1608.

===Literary and commercial===
In addition to his political career, Sackville is remembered for his literary contributions.
With Thomas Norton, he was an author in 1561 of the first English play to be written in blank verse, &quot;Gorboduc&quot;, which deals with the consequences of political rivalry. It was performed as part of the Christmas festivities (1560–1561) by the society of the Inner Temple, and afterwards on 18 January 1561 before Elizabeth at Whitehall.

He also contributed to the 1563 edition of &quot;The Mirror for Magistrates&quot;, with the poem &quot;Complaint of Henry, Duke of Buckingham&quot;. Sackville&#x27;s first important literary work was the poem &quot;Induction&quot;, which describes the poet&#x27;s journey to the infernal regions, where he encounters figures representing forms of suffering and terror. The poem is noted for the power of its allegory and for its sombre stateliness of tone.
Sackville acquired a large fortune through his land dealings in many counties, as well as from his investments in the iron foundry business. He was an advocate of stronger enforcement of the sumptuary laws, which regulated the types of clothing allowed to be worn by the various social classes, within the military. Specifically, he dictated that only soldiers holding the rank of colonel or above should be permitted to wear silk and velvet, and that captains and all ranks below should &quot;make do with fustian and spend the remaining money on their arms.&quot;

In around 1587, Sackville was granted a royal licence to commission a suit of armour from the royal workshops at Greenwich. The finely etched, blued and gilt armour, a garniture for the field, is one of the finest and best-preserved examples of the Greenwich school of armour-making. It is now part of the Wallace Collection in London. Another, similar, suit of armour, featuring the same construction and decorative scheme, which belonged to Sir James Scudamore, can be seen at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.

He died suddenly at the council table, having apparently suffered a stroke, referred to as &quot;a dropsy on the brain&quot;. His funeral took place at Westminster Abbey, and he is buried in the Sackville family vault at Withyham Parish Church, East Sussex.

==Family==
In 1555, Sackville married Cicely Baker, daughter of the leading politician Sir John Baker and his second wife Elizabeth Dineley. They had seven children, including his heir Robert, and Sir William Sackville, knighted by Henry IV of France.

A daughter Anne married Sir Henry Glemham, and Mary married Lord Bergavenny. John Chamberlain recorded their reputation for learning in April 1606, as &quot;complete women for learning, language, and all other rare qualities.&quot;

<text>Lady Susan is an epistolary novella by Jane Austen, possibly written in 1794 but not published until 1871. This early complete work, which the author never submitted for publication, describes the schemes of the title character.

==Synopsis==
Lady Susan Vernon, a beautiful and charming recent widow, visits her brother-in-law and his wife, Charles and Catherine Vernon, with little advance notice at Churchill, their country residence. Catherine is far from pleased, as Lady Susan had tried to prevent her marriage to Charles and her unwanted guest has been described to her as &quot;the most accomplished coquette in England&quot;. Among Lady Susan&#x27;s conquests is the married Mr. Manwaring.

Catherine&#x27;s brother Reginald arrives a week later, and despite Catherine&#x27;s strong warnings about Lady Susan&#x27;s character, soon falls under her spell. Lady Susan toys with the younger man&#x27;s affections for her own amusement and later because she perceives it makes her sister-in-law uneasy. Her confidante, Alicia Johnson, to whom she writes frequently, recommends she marry the very eligible Reginald, but Lady Susan considers him to be greatly inferior to Manwaring.

Frederica, Lady Susan&#x27;s 16-year-old daughter, tries to run away from school when she learns of her mother&#x27;s plan to marry her off to a wealthy but insipid young man she loathes. She also becomes a guest at Churchill. Catherine comes to like her—her character is totally unlike her mother&#x27;s—and as time goes by, detects Frederica&#x27;s growing attachment to the oblivious Reginald.

Later, Sir James Martin, Frederica&#x27;s unwanted suitor, shows up uninvited, much to her distress and her mother&#x27;s vexation. When Frederica begs Reginald for support out of desperation (having been forbidden by Lady Susan to turn to Charles and Catherine), she causes a temporary breach between Reginald and Lady Susan, but the latter soon repairs the rupture.

Lady Susan decides to return to London and marry her daughter off to Sir James. Reginald follows, still bewitched by her charms and intent on marrying her, but he encounters Mrs. Manwaring at the home of Mr. Johnson and finally learns Lady Susan&#x27;s true character. Lady Susan ends up marrying Sir James herself, and allows Frederica to reside with Charles and Catherine at Churchill, where Reginald De Courcy &quot;could be talked, flattered, and finessed into an affection for her.&quot;

==Main characters==

*Lady Susan Vernon
Lady Susan Vernon is aged about 35 or 36 years old (middle-aged for the time). She is the daughter of an earl. She is a widow of just a few months, who is known to flagrantly manipulate and seduce single and married men alike. As she has been left in a financially precarious state due to the death of her first husband, she uses flirtation and seduction to gain her objectives and maintain a semblance of her former opulent lifestyle. As a widow and a mother, her main goals are to quickly marry off her daughter Frederica (of whom she is contemptuous, regarding her as stupid and stubborn) to a wealthy man, and to marry an even better match herself. Catherine Vernon describes her as: ...really excessively pretty... I have seldom seen so lovely a woman as Lady Susan. She is delicately fair, with fine grey eyes and dark eyelashes; and from her appearance one would not suppose her more than five and twenty, though she must in fact be ten years older. I was certainly not disposed to admire her... but I cannot help feeling that she possesses an uncommon union of symmetry, brilliancy and grace. Lady Susan is cold towards her daughter, for whom she feels little or no affection: she calls her &quot;a stupid girl&quot; who &quot;has nothing to recommend her.&quot; It is possible that Jane Austen drew on the character of the mother of her neighbour, a beautiful Mrs. Craven, who had actually treated her daughters quite cruelly, locking them up, beating and starving them, till they ran away from home or married beneath their class to escape.

*Frederica Vernon
Daughter of Lady Susan. Oppressed by her mother, Frederica is very shy and it is only over time that the reader can perceive that rather than being stupid and stubborn, she is a sweet, sensible girl whose kind nature continually is at odds with Lady Susan&#x27;s venal selfishness. Frederica is not as beautiful as her mother, but has a mild, delicate prettiness which, together with her evident ability to feel gratitude, endears her to the Vernons.
*Catherine Vernon
Sister-in-law to Lady Susan. Lady Susan easily perceives how much Catherine Vernon dislikes her, but allows that she is &quot;well bred&quot; and has the air of &quot;a woman of fashion.&quot; She feels far more affection and concern for Frederica than Lady Susan does, and often laments Lady Susan&#x27;s great neglect of her daughter.
*Charles Vernon
Brother-in-law to Lady Susan. An amenable man who allows her to stay at his home.
*Reginald De Courcy
Brother of Catherine Vernon. He is handsome, kind, warm, and open, but rather gullible. Catherine Vernon writes in a letter to their mother, &quot;Oh! Reginald, how is your judgment enslaved!&quot;
*Lady De Courcy
Confidante and mother of Catherine Vernon. Lady De Courcy trusts her daughter&#x27;s judgement and is concerned that Reginald not be taken in by Lady Susan.
*Alicia Johnson
The intimate friend to whom Lady Susan confides all her true scheming. Alicia Johnson has an immoral mindset similar to that of her friend, Lady Susan. Stuck in a marriage with a sensible man whom she does not love, whom Lady Susan derisively describes as &quot;just old enough to be formal, ungovernable and to have the gout – too old to be agreeable, and too young to die&quot;, she delights in hearing of and making suggestions for Lady Susan&#x27;s manipulative plans.

==Film and television adaptations==
Whit Stillman&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Lady Susan&quot;, retitled &quot;Love &amp; Friendship&quot; after Austen&#x27;s juvenile work of that name, was included in the Sundance Film Festival in January 2016. The US release date was 13 May 2016. The film stars Kate Beckinsale, Chloe Sevigny, Xavier Samuel and Stephen Fry. It received strongly positive reviews.

==Stage and book adaptations==
The stage adaptation &quot;Lady Susan: Jane Austen&#x27;s Distinguished Flirt&quot; by Bonnie Milne Gardner was performed at Ohio Wesleyan University in 1998 and is published by Scripts for Stage.

A two-woman version of &quot;Lady Susan&quot;, adapted by Inis Theatre, played at the Dublin fringe festival in 2001–2.

An adaptation by Christine U&#x27;Ren was performed by Bella Union Theatre Company at the Berkeley City Club in Berkeley, California, in July 2009.

&quot;Lady Susan (a novel)&quot;, a 1980 complete re-write by Phyllis Ann Karr.

&quot;Lady Vernon and Her Daughter&quot;, a novel-length reconstruction of &quot;Lady Susan&quot;, was published by Crown Publishing in 2009. Written by mother-and-daughter co-authors Jane Rubino and Caitlen Rubino-Bradway, the adaptation reinterprets the work to conform closely to Austen&#x27;s more mature prose style.

A further adaptation of the text, in the form of a novelization by director Whit Stillman, was announced for publication to coincide with the general release of the film (under the same title) on 13 May 2016, starring Kate Beckinsale. Alexandra Alter of &quot;The New York Times&quot; states in her 2016 interview article with Stillman, describing the novelization: &quot;In the novel, Mr. Stillman takes the characters and plot from Austen&#x27;s fictionalized letters and narrates the tale from the perspective of Lady Susan&#x27;s nephew, who hopes to counter criticism of his maligned aunt. The 41 letters from Austen&#x27;s &quot;Lady Susan&quot; are included in an appendix.&quot; Stillman told Alter that he felt &quot;Lady Susan&quot; was not quite finished and thought the form of the book was &quot;so flawed&quot;. After realising that there was another story to be told, he convinced the publisher Little, Brown and Company to let him write the novel.

In November 2020, &quot;Jane Austen&#x27;s Lady Susan&quot; (a play) by Rob Urbinati was published by Samuel French. and its world premier performance was produced October 2021 by the Good Theater at the St. Lawrence Arts Center in Portland, Maine.

<doc id="914553" wikidata="Q21061449" url="?curid=914553" title="Donald Love">
<text>Donald Alistair Love (born 2 December 1994) is a professional footballer who plays as a defender for club Accrington Stanley. He began his professional career with Manchester United, but made just two senior appearances, and after a loan spell with Wigan Athletic in 2015, he was sold to Sunderland at the end of the 2015–16 season. Three years into a four-year contract, he was released by the club and joined Shrewsbury Town.

Born in England, Love represents Scotland at international level, having played for the under-17, under-19 and under-21 national teams.

==Club career==
===Manchester United and Wigan Athletic (loan)===
Love was born in Rochdale, Greater Manchester. He played junior football for Northwich Town and was personally scouted by Alex Ferguson. After rising through the ranks of the Manchester United academy, he first signed a professional contract with Manchester United in 2013.

On 2 October 2015, he was loaned to Wigan Athletic for two months. Love made his professional debut the following day, appearing as a 70th-minute substitute for Will Grigg in a goalless League One draw with Walsall at the DW Stadium. Love totalled eight appearances for the Latics.

After returning from his loan spell, Love made his Manchester United debut in a 2–1 defeat against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on 13 February 2016, coming on as a first-half substitute for the injured Matteo Darmian. Five days later, he made his first start in an injury-stricken United team, a 2–1 loss away to Midtjylland in the first leg of the Europa League round of 32, and was booked for a challenge on Martin Pušić that caused the Austrian to be substituted.

===Sunderland===
On 11 August 2016, Love joined Premier League club Sunderland on a four-year deal. He joined with his Manchester United teammate Paddy McNair, for a combined fee of £5.5 million. He made his debut two days later, playing the full 90 minutes of a 2–1 loss at Manchester City, and scored his first goal for Sunderland in an EFL Cup tie against Carlisle United on 22 August 2017.

In August 2018, Love sustained an injury to his ankle which, after attempting to continue playing for another three matches, kept him out of first-team action for the remainder of the 2018–19 season. After three years, a year before the end of his contract, Love was released by Sunderland in July 2019.

===Shrewsbury Town===
Following his release from Sunderland, on 12 July 2019, Love signed for fellow League One side Shrewsbury Town on a two-year deal. He made his debut on 3 August, playing the full 90 minutes of a 1–0 home win over Portsmouth. On 13 November, after coming on in the 67th minute for Louis Thompson in a 3–1 win over Macclesfield Town in the EFL Trophy group stage, he was sent off.

On 26 January 2020, in the fourth round of the FA Cup at home to Liverpool, Love drove Neco Williams&#x27; cross into his own net in the first minute of the second half to give Liverpool a 2–0 lead, though Shrewsbury drew the match 2–2 to earn a replay. On 12 May 2021 it was announced that he would leave Shrewsbury at the end of the season, following the expiry of his contract.

===Salford City===
On 31 August 2021, he signed a one-year contract with League Two side Salford City, with manager Gary Bowyer signing him to provide competition in various positions.

===Morecambe===
On 17 June 2022, Love agreed to join League One club Morecambe on a two-year deal upon the expiration of his contract with Salford City.

===Accrington Stanley===
On 23 July 2024, Love agreed to join League Two club Accrington Stanley on a two-year deal.

==International career==
Love was born in Rochdale, England but qualifies for the Scotland national team through his Stranraer-born grandmother. He has represented Scotland at under-17, under-19 and under-21 level.

<text>The Opel Senator is a full-size executive car (E-segment) produced by the German automaker Opel, two generations of which were sold in Europe from 1978 until 1993. A saloon, its first incarnation was also available with a fastback coupé body as the Opel Monza and Vauxhall Royale Coupé. The Senator was, for its entire existence, the flagship saloon model for both Opel and Vauxhall.

Through the international divisions of General Motors, it was also known in various markets as the Chevrolet Senator, Daewoo Imperial (in South Korea), Vauxhall Royale (until 1983) and Vauxhall Senator (which took the place of the Royale on Vauxhall models when the Opel brand was phased out from 1983). It was also sold as the Opel Kikinda in Yugoslavia, where it was produced under licence by IDA-Opel in Kikinda, Serbia, after which it was named.

The original Senator was a &quot;de facto&quot; replacement for Opel&#x27;s KAD cars (the Opel Kapitän, Admiral and Diplomat), which competed in the F-segment (full-size luxury) in which the KAD cars had sold poorly. Sister company Vauxhall had already abandoned the segment with the demise of its Cresta/Viscount models some years earlier, leaving the Ventora model (a luxury derivative of the FE Victor/VX4) as its flagship offering but this was axed in 1976 with no direct replacement.

The Senator shared its platform with the smaller Opel Rekord, the latter being lengthened to make the Senator. The second generation of that car, from 1987, shared its base with the Rekord&#x27;s Opel Omega successor, which was again lengthened to produce the Senator.

==Senator A (1978–1986)==
The Senator A was last part of a joint model programme executed by GM in the 1970s to develop a common series of vehicle platforms for both its European brands (and also for the Holden brand in Australia). The first two product families of this strategy – the T-Car (Kadett C/Chevette) and the U-Car (Ascona B/Manta B/Cavalier) had already been released. The V-Car (or V78) platform would simultaneously provide the next-generation Opel Rekord, a replacement for the Vauxhall FE Victor, and a &#x27;stretch&#x27; version to replace the unsuccessful &#x27;KAD&#x27; cars, and act as a flagship for both Opel and Vauxhall.

The Senator therefore emerged as a long wheelbase version of the Opel Rekord E, complemented by a three-door fastback coupé version on the same platform called the Opel Monza, which was planned as a successor for the Opel Commodore coupé.

=== Names and markets ===

The Senator A and Monza were initially sold in the United Kingdom as the Vauxhall Royale (and Vauxhall Royale Coupé). Unlike other members of the joint Opel/Vauxhall model programme of the period, the Royale was simply a badge engineered version of the Senator with only detail differences from its Opel sister.

Following the merger of the UK Opel and Vauxhall dealer networks in 1982, the Opel marque was repositioned as a performance-luxury brand, and the Vauxhall Royale models were dropped in favour of the Opel Senator/Monza, coinciding with the &quot;A2&quot; mid-cycle facelift. This policy was reversed in late 1984, with the Senator reverting to Vauxhall branding for the 1985 model year, but the Monza remained on sale as an Opel until its discontinuation at the end of 1987.

The vehicle was also available in South Africa as the Chevrolet Senator until 1982, when it was rebadged as an Opel. The Chevrolet Senator was fitted with a locally built version of Chevrolet&#x27;s 250 inline-six (4,093 cc), with . The post-1982 South African Opel Senator received Australian-built, six-cylinder engines. In Serbia, the locally assembled Senator received the 2.5-litre six and was badged the &quot;Opel Kikinda&quot;.

The Senator and Rekord E were used as the base vehicle from which the Holden Commodore was developed for the Australian and New Zealand markets. The later VK Commodore was a hybrid between the two Opel cars, featuring the Senator&#x27;s six light glasshouse grafted onto the Rekord E derived shell. 

=== Engines ===
The engine range for the first phase of the model&#x27;s life included the 2.8S and the newly developed 3.0E, which had and with fuel injection. The three-speed automatic transmission was Opel&#x27;s own design introduced in 1969, and was manufactured in Opel&#x27;s transmission plant in Strasbourg, it was modified to cope with the new and improved power outputs.

Opel&#x27;s own four speed manual transmission was not up to the job and they turned to transmission producer Getrag, who installed their 264 four speed manual gearbox in the early four cylinder Monzas. This was replaced by the five speed 240 for the 2.5 and 2.8 engines, and the 265 gearbox for the 3.0E.

The straight-six engines were all of the Opel cam-in-head engine design, as used in the earlier Commodore models and originating from the 1.7 and 1.9-litre straight four engines first used in the 1966 Kadett and Rekord. Opel would stick with the CIH engine design up until the 2.4 Frontera in 1993.

With the 3.0 litre engine, the Monza was the fastest car Opel had built, capable of , and 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 8.5 seconds. In June 1981, the fuel injected 2.5E engine also used in the smaller Commodore was added to the Senator/Monza lineup. With it was very close to the now irrelevant 2.8 and its , and the 2.8S was discontinued in 1982.

=== Facelift (A2)===
The original Senator and Monza were facelifted in November 1982, although the Senator &quot;A2&quot; (as it is usually called) only went on sale in March 1983. In the United Kingdom, it was initially sold only as an Opel, before being rebadged as a Vauxhall in 1984. The A2 Monza was only sold as an Opel.

The facelifted car looked similar to its predecessor, with relatively minor changes: smoothed-off headlights increased in size, and chrome parts were changed to a matt black or colour coded finish. The car was much more slippery, with drag resistance down (from 0.45 to 0.36 formula_1). The top of the range 3.0E received upgraded Bosch LE-Jetronic fuel injection.

Interiors were improved with an altered dashboard and the new instrument pack with larger dials used in the Rekord E2, and engines changed. Now, the fuel-injected straight-four two-liter cam-in-head unit from the Rekord E2 was available, although with little fanfare; this and the 2.5 essentially replaced the Commodore which was itself quietly retired in 1982. Power of the 2.0 was soon increased to . In March 1983 a 2.3-litre turbodiesel (shared with the Rekord) became available, and a few months later ABS-brakes (hitherto only available for the Senator CD) became an available option across the entire Senator/Monza range. At the Paris Show in September 1984 the 2.5E was given a new LE-Jetronic Bosch fuel injection system; power inched up to . The 2.0E was replaced by the torquier 2.2E, still with the same max power. Only the 3.0E engine remained untouched, although its name was changed to 3.0i. On the transmission side, the Strasbourg-built THM180 three-speed automatic was replaced by a four-speed unit. For the 1985 model year, the digital instrument display introduced in the Kadett E was available on the top models, although buyers could opt for the conventional analogue dials as a delete option. The trim surrounding the windows was more blacked out than before as well, although ample chrome remained. the four-cylinder models were never sold in Vauxhall form in the United Kingdom.
Shortly thereafter, in November 1984 a supercharged version (Comprex) was shown – at the time, the only production car in the world to use this technique. Going on sale in 1985, this very rare experimental version (1,000 units planned) were officially built by Irmscher rather than Opel. The Comprex offered and a top speed, and acceleration figures showed a twelve percent improvement over the turbodiesel. Like the other Rekord and Senator diesels it had a pronounced bulge in the bonnet. The Comprex offered marginally higher power than the turbodiesel, but more importantly, 90 percent of the maximum torque was available from 1300 rpm. From September 1985 until the end of production in the end of summer 1986, a catalyzed version of the 3.0E was available, with power down to .

=== Variants ===
A four-wheel drive conversion was also available, engineered by Ferguson, who had previously provided similar modifications for the Jensen FF. Rather expensive, this could also be retrofitted to an existing car. The system uses a viscous coupling to distribute power with a 60/40 rearward bias, to improve traction while maintaining the Senator&#x27;s handling characteristics. These were used by British Forces Germany under the BRIXMIS (British Commanders&#x27; in Chief Mission to the Soviet Forces in Germany) operations for the collection of technical intelligence. The same kit was also used by Bitter Cars for a four-wheel-drive version of their SC coupé, beginning in the end of 1981.

A limited edition convertible edition was also available in Germany, where the company &quot;Keinath&quot; reinforced the car heavily, and this added to the all round weight to the car.
== Senator B (1987–1993)==
A new model, the Senator B (marketed without the &quot;B&quot; suffix), arrived in the spring of 1987, a longer-bodied version of the Opel Omega. There was no Monza equivalent.

There were various versions of the Senator B: twelve valve 2.5 L and 3.0 L sized engines were released in 1987 along with a luxury &quot;CD&quot; model with the 3.0 L engine. The CD version boasted Electronic adjustable suspension, &quot;ERC&quot;, for the first time in a mass-produced European car, air conditioning, heated seats also in the back, genuine walnut panels, leather covered centre console, trip computer and cruise control.

The cars were available with either five speed manual or four speed automatic gearboxes. A digitally controlled 4-speed automatic from Aisin-Warner equipped with three different switching programs Sport, Economy and Winter.
It was also equipped with torque delay at each shift, called &quot;torque retard&quot;, for not notable gear changes. In winter mode the car starts on the third gear and switches immediately to fourth as soon as possible to prevent spinning wheels and instability. This mode remains to the speed of 80 km/h and then automatically switches off. The gearbox also had built-in diagnostic system and emergency program. Later Lexus and Volvo used similar versions of this transmission. As a luxury car, there were many options, but much was also standard. Options included leather seats, heated seats both front and rear, and electronic air conditioning including refrigerator in the glove box.

LCD instrumentation was also an option. Digital electronic power steering ZF-Servotronic, the same as in the BMW 7 Series, was standard, as was a new front axle design which allowed the axle to slide under the car in a crash and thus increasing the length of the deformation zone and prevent deformation of the footwell. The 3.0 24V was equipped with BBS styled multispoke alloy wheels made by Ronal.

A 24-valve version of the 3.0-litre six was introduced in 1989, generating – compared with for the older twelve valve version. This model was very popular with police forces in the United Kingdom, with several cars being supplied to multiple forces with upgraded police specification for traffic policing service, with the notable exception of the Metropolitan Police. The main feature of the new engine was a &quot;Dual Ram&quot; system, increasing torque at low engine speeds by means of a redirected air flow system which engages at 4,000 rpm. The engine in police service was capable of a speed of up to , although the bonnet was prone to rippling at such high speeds.

Opel tuners Irmscher introduced a 4-litre version of the Senator and it went on sale in Germany only in late 1990. Power increased to , it was equipped with a body kit and alloy wheels, while the car&#x27;s interior benefitted from buffalo hide, added wood panels, and lots of power equipment. For 1990 the 2.5 L was replaced by a 2.6 L Dual Ram. The twelve-valve, 3-litre version was deleted from the range in 1992. CD versions of the 2.6 L (UK market only), and a 24 valve 3.0 L were available up to the model&#x27;s withdrawal in 1993.

With the second generation Omega presented at the end of 1993 and available for sale from March 1994, Opel considered themselves sufficiently represented in the upper end of the market by the top specification Omega B. Production of the Opel Senator B ended in the autumn of 1993 with only 69,943 cars produced since the car&#x27;s launch six and a half years earlier. Annual production had slumped from 14,007 in 1990 to 5,952 in 1992, with only 2,688 cars produced in 1993. Following the announcement of the discontinuation of the Senator, the government of the United Kingdom would order a final batch of around 200 Vauxhall Senators in 1993 for diplomatic and policing use prior to moving over to the Vauxhall Omega.

<doc id="914558" wikidata="Q4756646" url="?curid=914558" title="Andrew Collins (broadcaster)">
<text>Andrew Collins is an English writer and broadcaster. He is the creator and writer of the Radio 4 sitcom &quot;Mr Blue Sky&quot;. His TV writing work includes &quot;EastEnders&quot; and the sitcoms &quot;Grass&quot; (which he co-wrote with Simon Day) and &quot;Not Going Out&quot; (which he initially co-wrote with Lee Mack). Collins has also worked as a music, television and film critic.

==Personal life==

Collins was a member of the Labour Party between the late 1980s and early 1990s, leaving after Labour&#x27;s defeat in the 1992 General Election. In 2007, he was made patron of Thomas&#x27;s Fund, a Northampton-based music therapy charity for children with life-limiting illnesses.

==Career==

Collins started his career as a music journalist, writing for the &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Vox&quot;, &quot;Select&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; (where was editor, 1995–97). He also wrote for and edited film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; in 1995. He formed a double-act with fellow music journalist Stuart Maconie, presenting the Sony Award-winning BBC Radio 1 show &quot;Collins and Maconie&#x27;s Hit Parade&quot;, after forging their style on a daily comedy strand on Mark Goodier&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 drivetime show, and &quot;Collins &amp; Maconie&#x27;s Movie Club&quot; on ITV.

In 1998, Collins published his first book, &quot;Still Suitable for Miners&quot;, an authorised biography of the singer-songwriter Billy Bragg. The book was updated, in 2002, 2007, 2013 and 2018.

Collins appeared on BBC, ITV and Channel 4 list shows, including &quot;I Love the &#x27;80s&quot; programme. He stated on BBC Three&#x27;s &quot;The Most Annoying TV Programmes We Love to Hate&quot; that he had appeared on 37 such list show. He devoted a full chapter to the experience of appearing as a talking head on such shows in his third volume of autobiography, &quot;That&#x27;s Me in the Corner&quot;, and continues to appear on similar shows (most recently, &quot;The Comedy years&quot; on ITV in May 2019).

He has written three volumes of autobiography, humorous accounts of &quot;growing up normal&quot; in 1970s Northampton, struggling with art school in London in the 1980s, and forging a media career in the 1980s and 1990s: &quot;Where Did It All Go Right?&quot; (2003) (a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; and Smith&#x27;s bestseller), &quot;Heaven Knows I&#x27;m Miserable Now&quot; (2004) and &quot;That&#x27;s Me in the Corner&quot; (which draws its title from a line from the R.E.M. song &quot;Losing My Religion&quot;) published in May 2007.

He produced a regular (generally weekly) podcast, the &quot;Collings &amp; Herrin Podcast&quot;, with comedian Richard Herring, which began in February 2008 and ran for four years and was named &quot;Podcast of the Week&quot; in &quot;The Times&quot; in July 2008. Some episodes were recorded in front of a live audience. A hiatus from June 2011 to 4 November 2011 was due to what Herring joked was &quot;Collins&#x27; duplicitous careerism&quot;. Herring announced that the November 2011 podcast would most likely be the last, as Collins had lost enthusiasm for it.

Collins presented solo shows on BBC Radio 6 Music as well as presenting shows with Richard Herring before and during their podcast series. Collins then presented a Saturday morning radio show with Josie Long on BBC Radio 6 Music between July and December 2011.

In 2010 Collins made a brief foray into standup comedy, performing a show at the Edinburgh Fringe called &quot;Secret Dancing... and other urban survival techniques&quot;. This was recorded and released on DVD.

He co-wrote the first series of the sitcom &quot;Not Going Out&quot; for BBC One with Lee Mack, and co-wrote various episodes for the second, third and fourth series. The fifth was the first series he did not work on. The first series won the Rose D&#x27;Or for Best Comedy, and he and Mack won the RTS Breakthrough award.

He worked on the team-written sitcom &quot;Gates&quot; for Sky Living in 2012, and re-teamed with Simon Day (with whom he&#x27;d co-written &quot;Grass&quot; for BBC Three and BBC2 in 2003) to co-write &quot;Colin&quot;, an episode of the anthology series &quot;Common Ground&quot; on Sky Atlantic in 2013.

Collins was script editor on sitcoms &quot;The Persuasionists&quot; on BBC Two, &quot;Little Crackers&quot; (specifically Shappi Khorsandi&#x27;s) on Sky1, the broadcast pilot of &quot;Man Down&quot; on Channel 4 (2013), two series of &quot;Badults&quot; on BBC Three (2013–2014), and the second series of &quot;Drifters&quot; for E4.

In 2014, he acted as a script consultant on &quot;The Inbetweeners 2&quot;.

Collins is the film editor for &quot;Radio Times&quot;. He wrote and filmed a weekly TV review column, &quot;Telly Addict&quot;, for &quot;The Guardian&quot; website, from May 2011 to April 2016. It returned in June 2016 on YouTube, now hosted and produced by UKTV.

He took over the weekly radio show &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot; on classical music station Classic FM in March 2015 (from presenter and composer Howard Goodall). In March 2023, Jonathan Ross replaced Collins as presenter.

==&quot;Mr Blue Sky&quot;==
Collins&#x27; first solo-written comedy, &quot;Mr Blue Sky&quot; for BBC Radio 4, starred Mark Benton and Rebecca Front and aired in May and June 2011. It was recommissioned for a second series in 2012. It focused on Harvey Easter (Benton), an eternally optimistic man in his 40s and his more realistic wife Jax (played in series two by Claire Skinner), and the rest of the family including son Robbie, daughter Charlie and grandmother Lou. Jim Bob of indie duo Carter The Unstoppable Sex Machine recorded a cover of &quot;Mr. Blue Sky&quot; by Electric Light Orchestra for the theme tune.

Radio critic Miranda Sawyer in &quot;The Observer&quot; praised Benton&#x27;s &quot;lovely&quot; performance and said &quot;this series charms&quot;. The List gave it 3/5, calling it &quot;warmly cosy&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; found it &quot;full of warm, nicely observed lines&quot;. After its second series aired in April and May 2012 (Moira Petty in &quot;The Stage&quot; praised Benton&#x27;s performance as &quot;an essay in finely nuanced felicity&quot;), &quot;Mr Blue Sky&quot; was not recommissioned for a third series.

<text>In computing, codice_1 is a command-line network utility that displays open network sockets, routing tables, and a number of network interface (network interface controller or software-defined network interface) and network protocol statistics. It is available on Unix, Plan 9, Inferno, and Unix-like operating systems including macOS, Linux, Solaris and BSD. It is also available on IBM OS/2 and on Microsoft Windows NT-based operating systems including Windows XP, Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 10.

It is used for finding problems in the network and to determine the amount of traffic on the network as a performance measurement. On Linux this program is mostly obsolete, although still included in many distributions.

On Linux, codice_1 (part of &quot;net-tools&quot;) is superseded by codice_3 (part of iproute2). The replacement for codice_4 is codice_5, the replacement for codice_6 is codice_7, and the replacement for codice_8 is codice_9, all of which are recommended instead.

==Statistics provided==

Netstat provides statistics for the following:

* Proto – The name of the protocol (TCP, UDP, etc.). On some systems, the protocol name may be followed by &quot;4&quot; or &quot;6&quot;, depending on whether the protocol is running over IPv4 or IPv6.
* Local Address – The IP address of the local computer and the port number being used. The name of the local computer that corresponds to the IP address and the name of the port is shown unless the parameter is specified. An asterisk (*) is shown for the host if the server is listening on all interfaces. If the port is not yet established, the port number is shown as an asterisk.
* Foreign Address – The IP address and port number of the remote computer to which the socket is connected. The names that corresponds to the IP address and the port are shown unless the parameter is specified. If the port is not yet established, the port number is shown as an asterisk (*).
* State – Indicates the state of a TCP connection. The possible states are as follows: , and . For more information about the states of a TCP connection, see .

==Parameters==
Parameters used with this command must be prefixed with a hyphen () rather than a slash (). Some parameters are not supported on all platforms.
==Examples==
===Cross platform===
On macOS, BSD systems, Linux distributions, and Microsoft Windows:

To display the statistics for only the TCP or UDP protocols, type one of the following commands:

codice_10

codice_11

===Unix-like===
On Unix-like systems:

To display all ports open by a process with id &quot;pid&quot;:

codice_12

To continuously display open TCP and UDP connections numerically and also which program is using them on Linux:
codice_13

===Windows===
On Microsoft Windows:

To display active TCP connections and the process IDs every 5 seconds, type the following command (works on NT based systems only, or Windows 2000 with hotfix):

codice_14

To display active TCP connections and the process IDs using numerical form, type the following command (works on NT based systems only, or Windows 2000 with hotfix):

codice_15

===*nix===

===Wildcards===
Netstat uses an asterisk * as a wildcard which means &quot;any&quot;. An example would be

Example output:

...Local Address Foreign Address State
... *:smtp *:* LISTEN
Under &quot;Local Address&quot; *, in codice_16, means the process is listening on all of the network interfaces the machine has for the port mapped as smtp (see /etc/services for service resolution). This can also be shown as 0.0.0.0.
The first *, in codice_17, means connections can come from any IP address, and the second *, in codice_17, means the connection can originate from any port on the remote machine.

==Caveats==
Some versions of codice_1 lack explicit field delimiters in their printf-generated output, leading to numeric fields running together and thus corrupting the output data.

==Platform specific remarks==
Under Linux, raw data can often be obtained from the /proc/net/dev to work around the printf output corruption arising in netstat&#x27;s network interface statistics summary, codice_6, until such time as the problem is corrected.

On the Windows platform, netstat information can be retrieved by calling the GetTcpTable and GetUdpTable functions in the IP Helper API, or IPHLPAPI.DLL. Information returned includes local and remote IP addresses, local and remote ports, and (for GetTcpTable) TCP status codes. In addition to the command-line netstat.exe tool that ships with Windows, GUI-based netstat programs are available.

On the Windows platform, this command is available only if the Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) protocol is installed as a component in the properties of a network adapter in Network Connections.

On the Windows platform running Remote Desktop Services (formerly Terminal Services) it will only show connections for the current user, not for the whole computer.

On macOS, the /System/Library/CoreServices/Applications folder (or /Applications/Utilities in OS X Mountain Lion and earlier) contains a network GUI utility called Network Utility, the Netstat tab of which runs the netstat command and displays its output in the tab.

<text>Chekhov&#x27;s gun (or Chekhov&#x27;s rifle; ) is a narrative principle that states that every element in a story must be necessary and irrelevant elements should be removed. For example, if a writer features a gun in a story, there must be a reason for it, such as it being fired some time later in the plot. All elements must eventually come into play at some point in the story. Some authors, such as Hemingway, do not agree with this principle.

The principle is recorded in letters by Anton Chekhov several times, with some variation; it was advice for young playwrights.

In recent years, the term has also taken on the meaning of a plot element that is introduced early in a story, whose significance to the plot does not become clear until later. This meaning is separate from Chekhov&#x27;s original intention with the principle, which relates to narrative conservation and necessity, rather than plot significance.

==Examples==
The principle is carried out somewhat literally in many of the &quot;James Bond&quot; films, in which the spy is presented with new gadgets at the beginning of a mission – such as a concealed, wrist-activated dart gun in &quot;Moonraker&quot; – and typically each device serves a vital role in the story. The principle dictates that only the devices utilized later in the story may be presented. A common misconception is that the reveal itself is a Chekhov&#x27;s gun plot element. There are however exceptions in the James Bond films; in &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; for example, Bond gets an instant camera with a built-in laser gun that takes X-ray pictures, but is immediately used for comedic effect and makes no further appearance in the film.

==Variations==
Ernest J. Simmons, (1903–1972) writes that Chekhov repeated the same point, which may account for there being several variations.

* &quot;One must never place a loaded rifle on the stage if it isn&#x27;t going to go off. It&#x27;s wrong to make promises you don&#x27;t mean to keep.&quot;
* &quot;Remove everything that has no relevance to the story. If you say in the first act that there is a rifle hanging on the wall, in the second or third act it absolutely must go off. If it&#x27;s not going to be fired, it shouldn&#x27;t be hanging there.&quot; — Sergius Shchukin (1911) &quot;Memoirs&quot;.
* &quot;If in the first act you have hung a pistol on the wall, then in the following one it should be fired. Otherwise don&#x27;t put it there.&quot;

==Criticism==
Ernest Hemingway mocked the principle in his essay &quot;The art of the short story&quot;, giving the example of two characters that are introduced and then never mentioned again in his short story &quot;Fifty Grand&quot;. Hemingway valued inconsequential details, but conceded that readers will inevitably seek symbolism and significance in them. Writer Andrea Phillips noted that assigning a single role for every detail makes a story predictable and leaves it &quot;colorless&quot;.

Writing in 1999, Donald Rayfield noted that in Chekhov&#x27;s play &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot;, contrary to Chekhov&#x27;s own advice, there are two loaded firearms that are not fired. The unfired rifles tie into the play&#x27;s theme of lacking or incomplete action.

==See also==
* Concision – the principle of brevity in writing
* Foreshadowing – a plot device where what is to come is hinted at, to arouse interest or to guard against disappointment
* MacGuffin – a plot motivator that is necessary to the plot and the motivation of the characters, but insignificant, unimportant, or irrelevant in itself
* Occam&#x27;s razor – the idea that explanatory mechanisms should not be posited without being necessary. 
* Red herring – drawing attention to a certain element to mislead
* Shaggy dog story – a long-winded anecdote designed to lure the audience into a false sense of expectation, only to disappoint them with an anticlimactic ending or punchline.
* Deus ex machina – a plot element introduced unexpectedly to resolve an otherwise unsolvable situation

<doc id="914572" wikidata="Q902638" url="?curid=914572" title="Excipient">
<text>An excipient is a substance formulated alongside the active ingredient of a medication. They may be used to enhance the active ingredient’s therapeutic properties; to facilitate drug absorption; to reduce viscosity; to enhance solubility; to improve long-term stabilization (preventing denaturation and aggregation during the expected shelf life); or to add bulk to solid formulations that have small amounts of potent active ingredients (in that context, they are often referred to as &quot;bulking agents&quot;, &quot;fillers&quot;, or &quot;diluents&quot;). During the manufacturing process, excipients can improve the handling of active substances and facilitate powder flow. The choice of excipients depends on factors such as the intended route of administration, the dosage form, and compatibility with the active ingredient.

Virtually all marketed drugs contain excipients, and final drug formulations commonly contain more excipient than active ingredient. Pharmaceutical regulations and standards mandate the identification and safety assessment of all ingredients in drugs, including their chemical decomposition products. Novel excipients can sometimes be patented, or the specific formulation can be kept as a trade secret to prevent competitors from duplicating it through reverse engineering.

==Relative versus absolute inactivity==
Though excipients were at one time assumed to be &quot;inactive&quot; ingredients, it is now understood that they can sometimes be &quot;a key determinant of dosage form performance&quot;; in other words, their effects on pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, although usually negligible, cannot be &quot;known&quot; to be negligible without empirical confirmation and sometimes are important. For that reason, in basic research and clinical trials they are sometimes included in the control substances in order to minimize confounding, reflecting that otherwise, the absence of the active ingredient would not be the only variable involved, because absence of excipient cannot always be assumed not to be a variable. Such studies are called excipient-controlled or vehicle-controlled studies.

==Types==

===Adjuvants===

Adjuvants are added to vaccines to enhance or modify the immune system response to an immunization. An adjuvant may stimulate the immune system to respond more vigorously to a vaccine, which leads to more robust immunity in the recipient.

===Antiadherents===
Antiadherents reduce the adhesion between the powder (granules) and the punch faces and thus prevent sticking to tablet punches by offering a non-stick surface. They are also used to help protect tablets from sticking. The most commonly used is magnesium stearate.

===Binders===
Binders hold the ingredients in a tablet together. Binders ensure that tablets and granules can be formed with required mechanical strength, and give volume to low active dose tablets. Binders are usually:
* Saccharides and their derivatives:
** Disaccharides: sucrose, lactose;
** Polysaccharides and their derivatives: starches, cellulose or modified cellulose such as microcrystalline cellulose and cellulose ethers such as hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC);
** Sugar alcohols such as xylitol, sorbitol or mannitol;
* Protein: gelatin;
* Synthetic polymers: polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), polyethylene glycol (PEG)...

Binders are classified according to their application:
*Solution binders are dissolved in a solvent (for example water or alcohol can be used in wet granulation processes). Examples include gelatin, cellulose, cellulose derivatives, polyvinylpyrrolidone, starch, sucrose and polyethylene glycol.
*Dry binders are added to the powder blend, either after a wet granulation step, or as part of a direct powder compression (DC) formula. Examples include cellulose, methyl cellulose, polyvinylpyrrolidone and polyethylene glycol.

===Coatings===
Tablet coatings protect tablet ingredients from deterioration by moisture in the air and make large or unpleasant-tasting tablets easier to swallow. For most coated tablets, a cellulose ether hydroxypropyl methylcellulose (HPMC) film coating is used which is free of sugar and potential allergens. Occasionally, other coating materials are used, for example synthetic polymers, shellac, corn protein zein or other polysaccharides. Capsules are coated with gelatin.

Enterics control the rate of drug release and determine where the drug will be released in the digestive tract. Materials used for enteric coatings include fatty acids, waxes, shellac, plastics, and plant fibers.

===Colours===
Colours are added to improve the appearance of a formulation. Colour consistency is important as it allows easy identification of a medication. Furthermore, colours often improve the aesthetic look and feel of medications. Small amounts of colouring agents are easily processed by the body, although rare reactions are known, notably to tartrazine. Commonly, titanium oxide is used as a colouring agent to produce the popular opaque colours along with azo dyes for other colors. By increasing these organoleptic properties a patient is more likely to adhere to their schedule and therapeutic objectives will also have a better outcome for the patient especially children.

===Disintegrants===
Disintegrants expand and dissolve when wet causing the tablet to break apart in the digestive tract, or in specific segments of the digestion process, releasing the active ingredients for absorption. They ensure that when the tablet is in contact with water, it rapidly breaks down into smaller fragments, facilitating dissolution.

Examples of disintegrants include: 
* Crosslinked polymers: crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone (crospovidone), crosslinked sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (croscarmellose sodium).
* sodium starch glycolate, a modified starch

===Flavours===
Flavours can be used to mask unpleasant tasting active ingredients and improve the acceptance that the patient will complete a course of medication. Flavourings may be natural (e.g. fruit extract) or artificial.

For example, to improve:
* a bitter product–mint, cherry or anise may be used
* a salty product–peach, apricot or liquorice may be used
* a sour product–raspberry or liquorice may be used
* an excessively sweet product–vanilla may be used

===Glidants===
Glidants are used to promote powder flow by reducing interparticle friction and cohesion. These are used in combination with lubricants as they have no ability to reduce wall friction. Examples include silica gel, fumed silica, talc, and magnesium carbonate. However, some silica gel glidants such as Syloid(R) 244 FP and Syloid(R) XDP are multi-functional and offer several other performance benefits in addition to reducing interparticle friction including moisture resistance, taste, marketing, etc.

===Lubricants===
Lubricants prevent ingredients from clumping together and from sticking to the tablet punches or capsule filling machine. Lubricants also ensure that tablet formation and ejection can occur with low friction between the solid and die wall.

Common minerals like talc or silica, and fats, e.g. vegetable stearin, magnesium stearate or stearic acid are the most frequently used lubricants in tablets or hard gelatin capsules. Lubricants are agents added in small quantities to tablet and capsule formulations to improve certain processing characteristics. While lubricants are often added to improve manufacturability of the drug products, it may also negatively impact the product quality. For example, extended mixing of lubricants during blending may results in delayed dissolution and softer tablets, which is often referred to as &quot;over-lubrication&quot;. Therefore, optimizing lubrication time is critical during pharmaceutical development.

There are three roles identified with lubricants as follows:

*True lubricant role:
:To decrease friction at the interface between a tablet’s surface and the die wall during ejection and reduce wear on punches and dies.
*Anti-adherent role:
:Prevent sticking to punch faces or in the case of encapsulation, lubricants.
:Prevent sticking to machine dosators, tamping pins, etc.
*Glidant role:
:Enhance product flow by reducing interparticulate friction.

There are two major types of lubricants:

*Hydrophilic
:Generally poor lubricants, no glidant or anti-adherent properties.
*Hydrophobic
:Most widely used lubricants in use today are of the hydrophobic category. Hydrophobic lubricants are generally good lubricants and are usually effective at relatively low concentrations. Many also have both anti-adherent and glidant properties. For these reasons, hydrophobic lubricants are used much more frequently than hydrophilic compounds. Examples include magnesium stearate.

===Preservatives===
Some typical preservatives used in pharmaceutical formulations are
* Antioxidants like vitamin A, vitamin E, vitamin C, retinyl palmitate, and selenium
* The amino acids cysteine and methionine
* Citric acid and sodium citrate
* Synthetic preservatives like the parabens: methyl paraben and propyl paraben.

===Sorbents===
Sorbents are used for tablet/capsule moisture-proofing by limited fluid sorbing (taking up of a liquid or a gas either by adsorption or by absorption) in a dry state. For example, desiccants absorb water, drying out (desiccating) the surrounding materials.

===Sweeteners===
Sweeteners are added to make the ingredients more palatable, especially in chewable tablets such as antacid or liquids like cough syrup. Sugar can be used to mask unpleasant tastes or smells, but artificial sweeteners tend to be preferred, as natural ones tend to cause tooth decay.

===Vehicles===
In liquid and gel formulations, the bulk excipient that serves as a medium for conveying the active ingredient is usually called the . Petrolatum, dimethyl sulfoxide and mineral oil are common vehicles.

<text>Kappa Pi Kappa (), also known as Pi Kap and formerly known as Kappa Kappa Kappa (colloquially as Tri-Kap) and briefly as Kappa Chi Kappa, is a local men&#x27;s fraternity at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. The fraternity was founded in 1842 and is the second-oldest fraternity at Dartmouth College.

==History==
Kappa Kappa Kappa was founded on July 13, 1842 by Harrison Carroll Hobart and two of his closest companions, Stephen Gordon Nash, and John Dudley Philbrick, all Class of 1842. The society was based on the principles of democracy, loyalty to Dartmouth, and equality of opportunity. Originally a literary and debate society, Pi Kap officially became a social society in 1905 and has remained so ever since, making it the oldest extant local fraternity in the country.

Due to the similarity of the society&#x27;s Greek initials with the Latin/English initials of the unaffiliated Ku Klux Klan, Kappa Kappa Kappa changed its name to Kappa Chi Kappa () for a period from April 1992 to October 1995, at which point the name changed back to Kappa Kappa Kappa.

Following a period of consensus-building among the brotherhood&#x27;s alumni, on May 18, 2022, Kappa Kappa Kappa again changed its name, this time to Kappa Pi Kappa ().

== Symbols ==
Kappa Pi Kappa&#x27;s motto is &quot;&quot;. Its color is Dartmouth Green. Its nickname is Pi Kap.

== Chapter house ==
The fraternity was the first student society at Dartmouth with its own meeting place, a building called The Hall, which was originally where the Hopkins Center for the Arts is today. Opened on July 28, 1860, the Hall served as Tri-Kap&#x27;s home until the society moved into the Parker House in 1894. Parker House was where the modern-day Silsby Hall is. In 1923, the society moved into 1 Webster Avenue in Hanover, where it resides to this day.

<doc id="914580" wikidata="Q947693" url="?curid=914580" title="Sir Richard Fanshawe, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Richard Fanshawe, 1st Baronet PC (June 1608 – 16 June 1666) was an English poet and translator. He was a diplomat and politician who sat in the House of Commons from 1661 to 1666. During the English Civil War he supported the Royalist cause and served Charles II of England in battle and in exile.

==Early life==
Fanshawe was the fourth and youngest son of Sir Henry Fanshawe, of Ware Park, Hertfordshire and his wife Elizabeth Smythe, daughter of Thomas Smythe, of Ostenhanger Kent and was baptised at Ware on 12 June 1608. His father, who was Remembrancer of the Exchequer, died in 1616.

Fanshawe was admitted at Jesus College, Cambridge in November 1623 and was admitted to Inner Temple on 22 January 1626. He travelled on the Continent, and in 1635 was Secretary to the Embassy at the Court of Spain. In 1638, he was Chargé d&#x27;Affaires there. He was an accomplished linguist, whose knowledge of &quot;modern languages&quot; like Spanish and Italian is said to have been a great advantage to him in his diplomatic career.

==Civil War==
When the Civil War broke out, Fanshawe sided with the King. He was Secretary of War to the Prince of Wales in 1644 and in 1648 had credentials for Spain, where he was sent to obtain money for the cause. From 1648 to 1650, he was Treasurer of the Navy under Prince Rupert. He was created a baronet on 2 September 1650, and soon afterwards was Secretary of State in Scotland to the young King Charles II. He was captured at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. He was knighted at Breda in April 1660, and made Latin Secretary and Master of Requests for King Charles when in Holland.

==Restored monarchy==
After the Restoration Fanshawe held various appointments. He represented James, Duke of York at the Coronation on 23 April 1661. In 1661 he was elected Member of Parliament for Cambridge University for the Cavalier Parliament and sat until his death. From 1662 to 1666, he was Ambassador to Portugal and from 1664 to 1666 was also ambassador to Spain.
In 1666 Fanshawe was making preparations to return to England when he died suddenly at &quot;Siete Chimeneas&quot;, his house in Madrid at the age of 58.

==Memorials==
His body was returned to England from Spain. He was initially buried at Allhallows, Hertford, and a few years later removed to St Mary&#x27;s Church, Ware, where there is a monument (a marble aedicule).

A portrait of Richard Fanshawe is on display with other portraits of the family at Valence House Museum in east London.

==Works==
Fanshawe translated Giovanni Battista Guarini&#x27;s &quot;Il pastor fido&quot;, &quot;Selected Parts of Horace&quot;, and &quot;The Lusiad&quot; of Camoens, the first English translation of the latter work (circulated from 1655 or earlier).

==Family==
Fanshawe married at Wolvercot, Oxfordshire on 18 May 1644, his second cousin Anne Harrison daughter of Sir John Harrison, of Ball&#x27;s Park, Ware and Margaret Fanshawe, daughter of Robert Fanshawe of Fanshawe Gate in Holmesfield, Derbyshire. His wife, described as &quot;devoted and able&quot;, wrote memoirs of her own life. They had fourteen children, but only five reached adulthood. 
The baronetcy became extinct on the death of their son Richard.

His brother Thomas was created Viscount Fanshawe.

<doc id="914594" wikidata="Q1091219" url="?curid=914594" title="The Beautifull Cassandra">
<text>is a short novel from Jane Austen&#x27;s juvenilia. It is a parody of the melodramatic, sentimental and picaresque novels of the time, and tells the story of a young woman who sets off into the world to make her fortune.

==Style==
Austen creates the characters and pastiche without authorial embellishment, in a brief work compressing twelve chapters into three pages. She sets the tone for this style in a dedication – &quot;to Miss Austen&quot; – that parodies flowery literary praise: &quot;Madam, You are a Phoenix [...] Your person is lovely [...] your conversation is rational and your appearance singular&quot;.

Austen then progresses to a story in which the heroine is &quot;lovely &amp; amiable &amp; chancing to fall in love with an elegant Bonnet [...] walked [out] [...] to make her fortune&quot;. All three of the listed characteristics, and the result, have precedents in the literature of Austen&#x27;s period, and each would evoke a series of associations in the mind of the reader; but Austen restructures the associations by the fashion in which she gives each of these particular items the same effect on the outcome. This readjustment creates a new perspective of accepted motifs and allows Austen to place herself outside of the framework of a single genre, raising fairy tale, or even nursery rhyme expectations, only to disappoint them. Such flexibility on the part of the author results in richer characterizations: Cassandra is constructed in fewer than thirty sentences and Austen relies on the audience&#x27;s appreciation of the references she makes to issues of lineage, adventure, expectations of beauty and typical relationships.

This small character has her own being, both within the text and on her own – one that reflects much of the life that would be brought to Austen&#x27;s later characters: her mischievousness, and even delinquency, are especially typical of Austen&#x27;s adolescent work, with extreme behavior and self-indulgence providing the prevailing tone. Thus, for example at a pastry-shop, Cassandra “devoured six ices, refused to pay for them, knocked down the Pastry-Cook and walked away”, concluding to herself at the end of all her similarly delinquent adventures that“ &#x27;This is a day well spent“.

==Later influence==
*In her dedication to Cassandra of her unfinished novel &quot;Catherine, or The Bower&quot;, Austen begins, “Encouraged by your warm patronage of The Beautiful Cassandra...”.
*Lydia Bennet in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; carries on some of the anarchic and transgressive energy of the beautiful Cassandra.

<doc id="914619" wikidata="Q4348264" url="?curid=914619" title="Goodnight Mister Tom">
<text>Goodnight Mister Tom is a children&#x27;s novel by English author Michelle Magorian, published by Kestrel in 1981. Harper &amp; Row published an American edition the same year. Set during World War II, it features a boy abused at home in London who is evacuated to the country at the outbreak of the war. In the care of Mister Tom, an elderly recluse, he experiences a new life of loving and care.

Magorian and &quot;Mister Tom&quot; won the annual once-or-lifetime Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize, judged by a panel of British children&#x27;s writers. She was also a commended runner-up for the Carnegie Medal from the British librarians, recognising the year&#x27;s best English-language children&#x27;s book published in the UK.

The novel has been adapted as a stage musical and as the film &quot;Goodnight Mister Tom&quot; (1998). In 2003, it was listed at #49 on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read. The most recent theatrical adaptation, &quot;Goodnight Mister Tom&quot;, won the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Entertainment.

==Plot==
In September 1939, as Britain stands on the brink of the war, many young children from the cities are evacuated to the countryside to escape imminent German bombardment. William Beech, a boy from Deptford who is physically and emotionally abused by his mother, arrives at the village of Little Weirwold. Willie is timid, thin, and covered with bruises and sores. He also believes he is full of sin, thanks to his strict, religious, and mentally unstable mother. He wets the bed every day.

Tom Oakley is a reclusive and crabby widower in his sixties. He is avoided by the community and vice versa. William&#x27;s mother wanted William to live with someone who was either religious or lived near a church. However, it is Tom who takes in Willie. Though initially distant, Tom is moved after discovering William&#x27;s home life and treats him with kindness. William grows attached to Tom and his dog, Sammy.

William attends school and makes friends with George, twins Carrie and Ginnie, and especially with fellow evacuee Zach. William learns to read and write with the help of Tom and others, and demonstrates a talent in drawing, painting and dramatics. As William is changed by Tom, so too is Tom transformed by William. It is revealed that Tom lost his wife and baby son to scarlatina (scarlet fever) forty years ago.

William&#x27;s mother writes that she is sick and requests that William return to her. Tom is reluctant to leave him but still allows it. At first, William looks forward to helping his mother and showing her his accomplishments. However, she is annoyed to hear about his time away, as he has not been learning the Bible by rote and has been receiving gifts and attention from others. She shows him her newborn daughter, who is lying neglected in a box. Furious to hear about his association with the Jewish Zach, and to hear William speaking up for himself, she accuses him of lying, theft and blasphemy and knocks him unconscious. William regains consciousness to find himself in the cupboard under the stairs, stripped down to his underwear, with his ankle twisted. He quietly sobs for Tom before falling asleep.

Weeks after William&#x27;s departure, Tom feels something is not right, as William has not written. Although he has never travelled far, he takes the train into London and eventually finds Deptford and William&#x27;s home. The house appears to be empty, but Sammy is agitated by something inside. Tom persuades a local policeman to break down the door. They find William chained to a pipe in the closet with the baby girl, who has died. William is malnourished and badly bruised as he had been locked there in the cupboard for days. William is hospitalised. Whilst there, he suffers horrific nightmares and is drugged to prevent his screams from disturbing other children&#x27;s sleep. Tom hears that William will be taken to a children&#x27;s home. He kidnaps William from the hospital and takes him back to Little Weirwold.

William remains bedridden and traumatised by his ordeal. He blames himself for the death of his sister, as he was not able to give her enough milk. Zach visits him daily. William grows stronger and visits his favourite teacher, Annie Hartridge. From Annie and Zach, William learns that he could not have fed a baby on his own and that a woman cannot conceive a child on her own. He realises his mother had sex with a man, although she had told him that it was a sin for unmarried men and women to consort. He no longer blames himself for his sister&#x27;s death.

The authorities arrive from London to tell William that his mother has committed suicide. They want to take him to a children&#x27;s home, as he has no other relatives. Tom intervenes and (after much persuasion) is allowed to adopt William. Tom, William, and Zach enjoy a holiday at the seaside village of Salmouth, where the landlady of their cottage mistakes William as Tom&#x27;s son. Zach receives news that his father has been injured by German bombing. Zach hurries back to London by train. Not long after, Zach dies in The Blitz. William is grief-stricken.

William heals through his friendship with another recluse, Geoffrey Sanderton, a young man who lost a leg during the war and who gives William private art lessons. After Geoffrey shares a photo of his own best friend, who is also dead, William begins to come to terms with Zach&#x27;s death. Using Zach&#x27;s bike, William teaches himself to ride. He realises that Zach will always be a part of him. William also grows closer to Carrie as they bond over Zach&#x27;s memories. 

One night, on returning home to Tom, whom he now calls &quot;Dad&quot;, William thinks back on how much his life has changed since arriving in Little Weirwold and realises he is growing up.

<text>Populus nigra, the black poplar, is a species of cottonwood poplar, the type species of section &quot;Aigeiros&quot; of the genus &quot;Populus&quot;, native to Europe, southwest and central Asia, and northwest Africa.

==Description==
Black poplars are medium- to large-sized deciduous trees, reaching 20–30 m, and rarely 40 m tall. Their leaves are diamond-shaped to triangular, 5–8 cm long and 6–8 cm broad, and green on both surfaces. Normally, their trunks achieve up to 1.5 m in diameter, but some unusual individual trees in France have grown old enough to have much larger trunks – more than 3 metres DBH (Diameter at Breast Height).

The species is (male and female flowers are on different plants), with flowers in catkins and pollination achieved by the wind. The black poplar grows in low-lying areas of moist ground. Like most other pioneer species, the tree is characterized by rapid growth and is able to colonize open areas quickly. 
===Subspecies===
Three subspecies are &quot;established&quot; and some botanists distinguish a fourth:
*&quot;P. n.&quot; subsp. &quot;nigra&quot;. Central and eastern Europe. Leaves and shoots glabrous (hairless); bark grey-brown, thick and furrowed.

*&quot;P. n.&quot; subsp. &quot;betulifolia&quot; (Pursh) W.Wettst. North-west Europe (France, Great Britain, Ireland). Leaf veins and shoots finely downy; bark grey-brown, thick and furrowed, often with heavy burrs, trunk usually heavily leaning.
*&quot;P. n.&quot; subsp. &quot;caudina&quot; (Ten.) Bugała. Mediterranean region, also southwest Asia if var. &quot;afghanica&quot; not distinguished.
*&quot;P. n.&quot; var. &quot;afghanica&quot; Aitch. &amp; Hemsl. (syn. &quot;P. n.&quot; var. &quot;thevestina&quot; (Dode) Bean). Southwest Asia; treated as a cultivar of &quot;P. nigra&quot; by many botanists, and as a distinct species &quot;P. afghanica&quot; by others; bark smooth, nearly white; leaves and shoots as subsp. &quot;caudina&quot; (see also cultivars, below).

The subspecies &quot;P. n. betulifolia&quot; is one of the rarest trees in Great Britain and Ireland, with only about 7,000 trees known, of which only about 600 have been confirmed as female.

===Cultivars===
Several cultivars have also been selected, these being propagated readily by cuttings:
*&#x27;Italica&#x27; is the true Lombardy poplar, selected in Lombardy, northern Italy, in the 17th century. The growth is fastigiate (having the branches more or less parallel to the main stem), with a very narrow crown. Coming from the Mediterranean region, it is adapted to hot, dry summers and grows poorly in humid conditions, being short-lived due to fungal diseases. It is a male clone. As a widely selected species chosen by golf architects in the 1960s, it soon became apparent that the poplar&#x27;s very invasive roots destroyed land drainage systems. Decades later, the same courses were removing poplar stands wholesale. Around 40 to 50 years, this short-lived variety starts shedding branches and is very likely to be blown over in high winds, each successive tree lost exposing neighbouring trees, creating a domino effect. 

*&quot;Plantierensis&quot; group clones are derived by crossing &#x27;Italica&#x27; with &quot;P. nigra&quot; ssp. &quot;betulifolia&quot; at the Plantières Nursery near Metz in France in 1884; they are similar to &#x27;Italica&#x27; (and often mistaken for it), but with a slightly broader crown, and better adapted to the cool, humid climate of northwest Europe, where the true Lombardy poplar does not grow well. Both male and female clones are grown. This is the tree most commonly grown in Great Britain and Ireland as Lombardy poplar.
*&#x27;Manchester&#x27; is a cultivar of &quot;P. nigra&quot; subsp. &quot;betulifolia&quot; widely planted in northwest England. It is a male clone, and currently seriously threatened by poplar scab disease.
*&#x27;Gigantea&#x27; is another fastigiate clone, of unknown origin, with a rather broader, more vigorous crown than &#x27;Italica&#x27;. It is a female clone.
*&#x27;Afghanica&#x27; (syn. &#x27;Thevestina&#x27;): most, if not all, specimens are of a single clone, and many botanists therefore treat it as a cultivar rather than a botanical variety. It is fastigiate, similar to &#x27;Italica&#x27;, but with a striking whitish bark; it also differs from &#x27;Italica&#x27; in being a female clone. This is the common fastigiate poplar in southwest Asia and southeast Europe (the Balkans), where it was introduced during the Ottoman Empire period.

&quot;Populus nigra&quot; &#x27;Italica&#x27; has won the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Distribution==
Black poplar has a large distribution area throughout Europe and is also found in northern Africa and central and west Asia. The distribution area extends from the Mediterranean in the south to around 64° latitude in the north and from the British Isles in the west to Kazakhstan and China in the east. The distribution area also includes the Caucasus and large parts of the Middle East.

<doc id="914634" wikidata="Q110767568" url="?curid=914634" title="Ulmus minor 'Atinia'">
<text>The [[field elm]] (&quot;Ulmus minor&quot;) cultivar&#x27;Atinia&#x27;, commonly known as the English elm, formerly common elm and horse may, and more lately the Atinian elm, was, before the spread of Dutch elm disease, the most common field elm in central southern England, though not native there, and one of the largest and fastest-growing deciduous trees in Europe. R. H. Richens noted that elm populations exist in north-west Spain, northern Portugal, and on the Mediterranean coast of France that &quot;closely resemble the English elm&quot; and appear to be &quot;trees of long standing&quot; in those regions rather than recent introductions. Augustine Henry had earlier noted that the supposed English elms planted extensively in the Royal Park at Aranjuez from the late 16th century onwards, specimens said to have been introduced from England by Philip II and &quot;differing in no respects from the English elm in England&quot;, behaved as native trees in Spain. He suggested that the tree &quot;may be a true native of Spain, indigenous in the alluvial plains of the great rivers, now almost completely deforested&quot;.

Richens believed that English elm was a particular clone of the variable species &quot;Ulmus minor&quot;, referring to it as &quot;Ulmus minor&quot; var. &quot;vulgaris&quot;. A 2004 survey of genetic diversity in Spain, Italy, and the UK confirmed that English elms are indeed genetically identical, clones of a single tree, said to be Columella&#x27;s &#x27;Atinian elm&#x27;, once widely used for training vines, and assumed to have been brought to the British Isles by Romans for that purpose. Thus, despite its name, the origin of the tree is widely believed to be Atina, Lazio, in Italy, the home town of Columella, whence he imported it to his vineyards in Cadiz, although the clone is no longer found in Atina and has not yet been identified further east.

Max Coleman of the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh writes: &quot;The advent of DNA fingerprinting has shed considerable light on the question. A number of studies have now shown that the distinctive forms that Melville elevated to species and Richens lumped together as field elm are single clones, all genetically identical, that have been propagated by vegetative means such as cuttings or root suckers, as the flowers are completely sterile. This means that enigmatic British elms such as ... English elm have turned out to be single clones of field elm.&quot; Most flora and field guides, however, do not list English elm as a form of &quot;U. minor&quot;, but rather as &quot;U. procera&quot;.

&lt;section end=Synonymy /&gt;

==Description==
The tree often exceeded 40 m (about 130 ft) in height with a trunk less than 2 m (6.5 ft) in diameter at breast height (dbh). The largest specimen ever recorded in England, at Forthampton Court, near Tewkesbury, was 46 m (151 ft) tall. While the upper branches form a fan-shaped crown, heavy, more horizontal boughs low on the bole often give the tree a distinctive &#x27;figure-of-eight&#x27; silhouette. The small, reddish-purple hermaphrodite apetalous flowers appear in early spring before the leaves. The samara is nearly circular. The leaves are dark green, almost orbicular, &lt; 10 cm long, without the pronounced acuminate tip at the apex typical of the genus. They flush a lighter green in April, about a month earlier than most field elms. Since the tree does not produce long shoots in the canopy, it does not develop the markedly pendulous habit of some field elms. The bark of old trees was described by Richens as &quot;scaly rather than longitudinally grooved&quot;. The bark of English elm suckers, like that of Dutch elm suckers and of some field elm, can be corky, but Dutch elm suckers may be distinguished from English by their straighter, stouter twigs, bolder &#x27;herringbone&#x27; pattern, and later flushing.

The tree is both female- and male-sterile, natural regeneration being entirely by root suckers. Seed production in England was often unknown in any case. By the late 19th century, urban specimens in Britain were often grafted on to wych elm rootstock to eliminate suckering; Henry noted that this method of propagation seldom produced good specimens. 
==Pests and diseases==
Owing to its homogeneity, the tree has proven particularly susceptible to Dutch elm disease, but immature trees remain a common feature in the English countryside courtesy of the ability to sucker from roots. After about 20 years, these suckers, too, become infected by the fungus and killed back to ground level. English elm was the first elm to be genetically engineered to resist disease, at the University of Abertay Dundee. It was an ideal subject for such an experiment, as its sterility meant no danger exists for its introgression into the countryside.

In the United States, English elm was found to be one of the most preferred elms for feeding by the Japanese beetle &quot;Popillia japonica&quot;.

The leaves of the English elm in the UK are mined by &quot;Stigmella ulmivora&quot;.

==Uses==

The English elm was once valued for many purposes, notably as water pipes from hollowed trunks, owing to its resistance to rot in saturated conditions. It is also very resilient to crushing damage, and these two properties led to its widespread use in the construction of jetties, timber piers, lock gates, etc. It was used to a degree in furniture manufacture, but not to the same extent as oak, because of its greater tendency to shrink, swell, and split, which also rendered it unsuitable as the major timber component in shipbuilding and building construction. The wood has a density around 560 kg/m3.

However, English elm is chiefly remembered today for its aesthetic contribution to the English countryside. In 1913, Henry Elwes wrote, &quot;Its true value as a landscape tree may be best estimated by looking down from an eminence in almost any part of the valley of the Thames, or of the Severn below Worcester, during the latter half of November, when the bright golden colour of the lines of elms in the hedgerows is one of the most striking scenes that England can produce&quot;.

==Cultivation==
The introduction of the Atinian elm to Spain from Italy is recorded by the Roman agronomist Columella. It has also been identified by Heybroek as the elm grown in the vineyards of the Valais, or Wallis, canton of Switzerland. Although no record has been found of its introduction to Britain from Spain, the tree has been long believed to have arrived with the Romans, a hypothesis supported by the discovery of pollen in an excavated Roman vineyard. Pliny, however, in his &quot;Natural History&quot; pointed out that the Atinian elm was not considered suitable for vineyards on account of its dense foliage. The tree was used as a source of leaf hay. Elms said to be English Elm, and reputedly brought to Spain from England by Philip II, were planted extensively in the Royal Park at Aranjuez and the Retiro Park, Madrid, from the late 16th century onwards.

More than a thousand years after the departure of the Romans from Britain, English elms found far greater popularity, as the preferred tree for planting in the new hawthorn hedgerows appearing as a consequence of the Enclosure movement, which lasted from 1550 to 1850. In parts of the Severn Valley, the tree occurred at densities over 1000 per km2, so prolific as to have been known as the &#x27;Worcester weed&#x27;. In the eastern counties of England, however, hedgerows were usually planted with local field elm, or with suckering hybrids. When elm became the tree of fashion in the 18th and 19th centuries, avenues and groves of English elm were often planted, among them the elm groves in The Backs, Cambridge. Perhaps the most famous English Elm avenue was the double row in the Long Walk, Windsor Great Park, Berkshire, planted in the 1680s on the advice of John Evelyn, and described by Elwes as &quot;one of the finest and most imposing avenues in the world&quot;. The elms were felled in 1943.

English elm was introduced into Ireland, and as a consequence of Empire has been cultivated in eastern North America and widely in south-eastern Australia and New Zealand. It is still commonly found in Australia and New Zealand, where it is regarded at its best as a street or avenue tree. Some old specimens labelled &#x27;English elm&#x27; in Australia, however, have unplated, more vertically furrowed bark and less rounded leaves than common English elm, and appear to be a different clone. English elm was also planted as a street tree on the American West Coast, notably in St Helena, California, and it has been planted in South Africa.
==Notable trees==
Mature English elms are now only very rarely found in the UK beyond Brighton and Edinburgh. One large tree survives in Leicester in Cossington Street Recreation Ground. Several survive in Edinburgh (2015): one in Rosebank Cemetery (girth 3 m), one in Founders Avenue, Fettes College, and one in Inverleith Park (east avenue), while a majestic open-grown specimen (3 m) in Claremont Park, Leith Links, retains the dense, fan-vaulted crown iconic in this cultivar. An isolated mature English elm is in the cemetery at Dervaig, Isle of Mull, Scotland.

Some of the most significant remaining stands are to be found overseas, notably in Australia, where they line the streets of Melbourne, protected by geography and quarantine from disease. An avenue of 87 English Elms, planted around 1880, lines the entrance to the winery of All Saints Estate, Rutherglen, Victoria; a double avenue of 400 English Elms, planted in 1897 and 1910–15, lines Royal Parade, Parkville, Melbourne. Large free-standing English Elms in Tumut, New South Wales, and Traralgon, Victoria, show the &#x27;un-English&#x27; growth-form of the tree in tropical latitudes. However, many of the Australian trees, now over 100 years old, are succumbing to old age, and are being replaced with new trees raised by material from the older trees budded onto Wych Elm &quot;Ulmus glabra&quot; rootstock. In New Zealand a &quot;massive individual&quot; stands at 36 Mt Albert Road, Auckland. In the United States, several fine trees survive at Boston Common, Boston, and in New York City, notably the Hangman&#x27;s Elm in Washington Square Park. A large old specimen, the Goshen Elm (bole-girth 236 in.) stands (2021) in Gaithersburg, Maryland. In Canada four 130-year English Elms, inoculated against disease, survive on the Back Campus field of the University of Toronto. An English Elm planted c.1872 (girth 5.1 m) stands in Kungsparken, Malmö, Sweden.

===Brighton and the &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;===
Although the English elm population in Britain was almost entirely destroyed by Dutch elm disease, mature trees can still be found along the south coast Dutch Elm Disease Management Area in East Sussex. This &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot;, aided by the prevailing southwesterly onshore winds and the topographical niche formed by the South Downs, has saved many mature elms. Amongst these were possibly the world&#x27;s oldest surviving English elms, known as the &#x27;Preston Twins&#x27; in Preston Park, both with trunks exceeding 600 cm in circumference (2.0 m dbh), though the larger tree lost two limbs in August 2017 following high winds, and was felled in December 2019 after succumbing to DED.
==Cultivars==
A small number of putative cultivars have been raised since the 18th and early 19th centuries, three of which are now almost certainly lost to cultivation:
&#x27;Acutifolia&#x27;, &#x27;Atinia Pyramidalis&#x27;, &#x27;Atinia Variegata&#x27;, &#x27;Folia Aurea&#x27;, &#x27;Picturata&#x27;.
Though usually listed as an English Elm cultivar, &quot;Ulmus&quot; &#x27;Louis van Houtte&#x27; &quot;cannot with any certainty be referred to as &quot;Ulmus procera&quot; [ = &#x27;Atinia&#x27;] &quot; (W. J. Bean). In Sweden, &quot;U.&quot; × &quot;hollandica&quot; &#x27;Purpurascens&#x27;, though not a form of English Elm, is known as &quot;Ulmus procera&quot; &#x27;Purpurea&#x27;.

==Hybrids, hybrid cultivars, and mutations==
Crossability experiments conducted at the Arnold Arboretum in the 1970s apparently succeeded in hybridizing English elm with &quot;U. glabra&quot; and &quot;U. rubra&quot;, both also protogynous species. However, the same experiments also showed English elm to be self-compatible, which in the light of its proven female-sterility, must cast doubt on the identity of the specimens used. A similar doubt must hang over Henry&#x27;s observation that the &#x27;English elms&#x27; at Aranjuez (see Cultivation above) &quot;produced every year fertile seed in great abundance&quot;, seed said to have been taken &quot;all over Europe&quot;, presumably in the hope that it would grow into trees like the royal elms of Spain. Given that English elm is female-sterile, the Aranjuez elms either were not after all English elm, or by the time Henry collected seed from them, English elms there had been replaced by intermediates or by other kinds. At higher altitudes in Spain, Henry noted, such as in Madrid and Toledo, the &#x27;English elm&#x27; did not set fertile seed.

The 2004 study, which examined &quot;eight individuals classified as English elm&quot; collected in Lazio, Spain, and Britain, noted &quot;slight differences among the Amplified fragment length polymorphism fingerprinting profiles of these eight samples, attributable to somatic mutations&quot;. Since &#x27;Atinia&#x27;, though female infertile, is an efficient producer of pollen and should be capable of acting as a pollen parent; it is compatible with the 2004 findings that in addition to a core population of genetically virtually identical trees deriving from a single clone, intermediate forms of &quot;U. minor&quot; exist, of which that clone was the pollen parent. These might be popularly or even botanically regarded as &#x27;English elm&#x27;, though they would be genetically distinct from it, and in these, the female infertility could have gone. The &quot;smooth-leaved form&quot; of English elm mentioned by Richens (1983), and the &quot;northern and Irish form&quot; seen by Oliver Rackham in Edinburgh and Dublin and said by him (1986) to have been introduced to New England, are possible examples of &#x27;Atinia&#x27; mutations or intermediates.

&quot;Ulmus&quot; × &quot;hollandica&quot; hybrid elms introduced to Australia from England are &quot;commonly and erroneously referred to [in Australia] as &#x27;English Elm&#x27; &quot;. Melbourne Botanic Gardens were able to raise seedlings from the &quot;few&quot; viable seeds of what was believed to be a &quot;type&quot; old English Elm in the collection, producing &quot;highly variable&quot; offspring. &quot;This seedling variation,&quot; wrote Roger Spencer (&quot;Horticultural Flora of South-Eastern Australia&quot;, 1995), &quot;suggests one possible source of the variation to be found in these trees [so-called &#x27;English elm&#x27; ] in Australia.&quot; The extent to which elms in Australia have been propagated by seed rather than by cloning is unclear, but Melville believed that there were &quot;Ulmus procera&quot; × &quot;Ulmus minor&quot; hybrids present in Victoria. &quot;Chance hybridisation,&quot; wrote Spencer, &quot;has resulted in a mix of elms rather different from that in England&quot;. Similarly, an old tree labelled &quot;U. procera&quot; in Dunedin Botanic Garden, New Zealand (2023), may be an elm from England, but it is not the English elm clone.

==In art and photography==
The elms in the Suffolk landscape paintings and drawings of John Constable were not English elm, but &quot;most probably East Anglian hybrid elms ... such as still grow in the same hedges&quot; in Dedham Vale and East Bergholt, while his Flatford Mill elms were &quot;U. minor&quot;. Constable&#x27;s &quot;Study of an elm tree&quot; (&quot;circa&quot; 1821) is, however, thought to depict the bole of an English elm with its bark &quot;cracked into parched-earth patterns&quot;. Among artists who depicted English Elms were Edward Seago and James Duffield Harding. English elm features in oil paintings by contemporary artist David Shepherd, either as the main subject (&quot;Majestic elms&quot; ) or more often as the background to nostalgic evocations of farming scenes.

Among classic photographs of English elm are those by Edward Step and Henry Irving in &quot;Wayside and Woodland Trees, A pocket guide to the British sylva&quot; (1904).

<text>The Tragedie of Gorboduc, also titled Ferrex and Porrex, is an English play from 1561. It was first performed at the Christmas celebration given by the Inner Temple in 1561, and performed at Whitehall before Queen Elizabeth I on 18 January 1561, by the Gentlemen of the Inner Temple. The authors were Thomas Norton and Thomas Sackville, said to be responsible for the first three acts, and the final two, respectively.

The first quarto, published by the bookseller William Griffith, was published 22 September 1565. A second authorized quarto corrected by the authors followed in 1570, and was printed by John Day with the title &quot;The Tragedie of Ferrex and Porrex&quot;. A third edition was published in 1590 by Edward Allde.

The play is notable for several reasons: as the first verse drama in English to employ blank verse; for its political subject matter (the realm of Gorboduc is disputed by his sons Ferrex and Porrex), which was still a touchy area in the early years of Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, while the succession to the throne was unclear; for its manner, progressing from the models of the morality play and Senecan tragedy in the direction which would be followed by later playwrights. That is, it can be seen as a forerunner of the whole trend that would later produce &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; and &quot;King Lear&quot;. It also provides the first well-documented performance of a play in Ireland: Charles Blount, 8th Baron Mountjoy staged it at Dublin Castle in 1601.

==Synopsis==
The playtext summarizes the plot in the &#x27;Argument&#x27;: &quot;Gorboduc, King of Britain, divided his realm in his lifetime to his sons, Ferrex and Porrex. The sons fell to dissension. The younger killed the elder. The mother that more dearly loved the elder, for revenge killed the younger. The people, moved with the cruelty of the fact, rose in rebellion and slew both father and mother. The nobility assembled and most terribly destroyed the rebels. And afterward, for want of issue of the prince, whereby the succession of the crown became uncertain, they fell to civil war in which both they and many of their issues were slain, and the land for a long time almost desolate and miserably wasted.&quot;

Gorboduc announces his plan to divide his kingdom between his sons Ferrex and Porrex. His councillors advise against it, reminding him of the conflict that arose between the cousins Morgan and Cunedag when Britain was divided between them, which led to Morgan&#x27;s death. Gorboduc appreciates their advice but goes ahead with his plan. Ferrex is advised by the parasite Hermon to take the whole Kingdom. Tyndar tells Porrex that his brother is making plans for war, meaning Porrex decides to invade Ferrex&#x27;s realm. Dordan writes to Gorboduc of this. Gorboduc bewails this and is advised to raise a force against them. However, a nuntius (messenger) then enters, bearing the news of Ferrex&#x27;s death. Porrex meets his father and justifies his actions, saying that he was content to rule his kingdom but that his brother plotted to take his lands. However, his mother Videna then stabs him dead while he is sleeping in revenge for Ferrex. The people rise up in anger and kill both her and Gorboduc, blaming the King for Porrex&#x27;s death. The nobles prepare to act against the rebels. However, the succession is left uncertain. Fergus, Duke of Albany, plans to gain the throne and begins raising an army while his friends try to gather support. The nobles defeat the rebels, but hear that Fergus has raised an army and intends to take the crown. The nobles oppose Fergus, thinking of him as a foreign invader. Arostus says that Parliament must decide upon a new King. Eubulus bemoans the chaos that has happened to the country and says that Parliament should have been called while the King was alive, but that justice will eventually prevail.

<text>Ulmus minor&quot; subsp. &quot;minor, the narrow-leaved elm (also known as smooth-leaved elm or East Anglian elm), was the name used by R. H. Richens (1983) for English field elms that were not English elm, Cornish elm, Lock elm or Guernsey elm. Many publications, however, continue to use plain &quot;Ulmus minor&quot; for Richens&#x27;s subspecies, a name Richens reserved for the undifferentiated continental field elms. (&quot;Ulmus minor&quot; is native to southern Europe and Asia Minor including Iran.) The name &quot;Ulmus minor&quot; subsp. &quot;minor&quot; is justified by the existence of at least one other distinctive &quot;U. minor&quot; subspecies, &quot;U. minor&quot; subsp. &quot;canescens&quot; (accepted as such by Plants of the World Online). Dr Max Coleman of Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh argued in his 2002 paper &#x27;British Elms&#x27; that there was no clear distinction between species and subspecies. 

In England, narrow-leaved elm is the commonest field elm in East Anglia, the East Midlands, and eastern Kent. 

==Description==
The smooth-leaved elm is a deciduous tree that can grow to 35 m. Its Latin synonym &quot;carpinifolia&quot; alludes to the superficial similarity of the leaves to those of hornbeam &quot;Carpinus&quot; sp., while the common names contrast the smooth upper surface and narrowness of the leaves with those of the wych elm, which are rough and broad. The apetalous perfect wind-pollinated flowers, and fruit (samaras) are very similar to those of the species.
==Pests and diseases==
Although the smooth-leaved elm is generally susceptible to Dutch elm disease, it is genetically a highly variable tree and it is possible some specimens survive in the UK owing to an innately high level of resistance (see Cultivation). Research currently (2009) in hand by Cemagref at , Guémené-Penfao, France, should confirm this. However, all smooth-leaved elm varieties are believed to have been introduced into Britain from central and southern Europe during the Bronze Age, and some, being beyond their natural climates and environments, may be growing slowly and thus producing smaller springwood vessels restrictive to the &quot;Ophiostoma&quot; fungus. Good performance in the field may also be owing to resistance to bark beetle feeding or breeding. Moreover, several types of this subspecies also have very pendulous twigs when mature, a factor which could also make them unattractive to foraging Scolytus beetles, which are disinclined to invert themselves.

As the tree suckers readily, its genetic resources are not considered endangered.

The subspecies has a moderate to high susceptibility to the elm leaf beetle, &quot;Xanthogaleruca luteola&quot;, and a moderate susceptibility to elm yellows.

==Cultivation==

Many mature specimens still survive in England, notably in East Anglia. The Woodland Trust currently lists (2013) some 120 surviving &quot;ancient&quot; smooth-leaved elms in England and Wales, some of which are among the elms now being cloned, propagated and planted as part of The Conservation Foundation&#x27;s &#x27;Great British Elm Experiment&#x27; and &#x27;Ulmus londinium&#x27; projects, a scheme to identify disease-resistant strains and return elms to city and countryside. Among &quot;varieties with most resistance&quot;, Professor Oliver Rackham noted (1986) the &#x27;Boxworth elm&#x27;, still thriving (2022) in and around Boxworth, Cambridgeshire, and from c.2010 propagated experimentally by the Conservation Foundation. 

In a more academically-based project, most of the clones of the surviving European field elms that have been tested since the 1990s for innate resistance to Dutch elm disease by national research institutes in the EU, with a view to returning field elm to cultivation in Europe, would be classified by Richens’s system as &quot;Ulmus minor&quot; subsp. &quot;minor&quot;. Results from Spain (2013), for example, confirm that a very small number of surviving field elms (about 0.5% of those tested) appear to have comparatively high levels of tolerance of the disease, and it is hoped that a controlled crossing of the best of these will produce resistant &quot;Ulmus minor&quot; hybrids for cultivation.

Of pendulous &quot;Ulmus nitens&quot; (&quot;U. minor&quot; subsp. &quot;minor&quot;), Elwes noted (1913) that in Hertfordshire and along the western borders of Essex &quot;the most graceful form of this tree may be seen in perfection&quot;. Narrow-leaved elm was occasionally planted as an ornamental urban tree.
==Notable trees==
The largest recorded tree in the UK grew at Great Amwell in Hertfordshire, measuring 40 m in height and 228 cm diameter at breast height (d.b.h.) in 1911. Another famous specimen was the great elm that towered above its two siblings at the bottom of Long Melford Green, Long Melford, Suffolk, till the group succumbed to disease in 1978. The three &quot;were survivors of a former clone of at least nine elms, one dating from 1757&quot;. The Long Melford elms were painted in 1940 by the watercolourist S. R. Badmin in his &#x27;Long Melford Green on a Frosty Morning&#x27;, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.

The largest known surviving trees are at East Coker, Somerset (30 m high, 95 cm d.b.h.), Termitts Farm near Hatfield Peverel, Essex (25 m high, 145 d.b.h.), and Melchbourne, Bedfordshire, (147 cm d.b.h.). A old East Anglian elm that stands (2024) by the Post Office, Abbots Ripton, Cambridgeshire, was incorrectly identified as &#x27;Atinia&#x27; in Seddon and Shreeve&#x27;s &quot;Great British Elms&quot; (Kew Gardens, 2024). 
==Cultivars==
*&quot;Ulmus minor&quot; &#x27;Argenteo-Variegata&#x27; (variegated smooth-leaved elm)

==Hybrids and hybrid cultivars==
The tree&#x27;s natural range in eastern England overlaps with that of wych elm (&quot;Ulmus glabra&quot;), the two species hybridizing to produce elms of the &quot;Ulmus&quot; × &quot;hollandica&quot; group. Nursery cultivars in this group with English &quot;U. minor&quot; subsp. &quot;minor&quot; in their parentage include &#x27;Vegeta&#x27;, &#x27;Cicestria&#x27;, and &#x27;Smithii&#x27;. 

&quot;U. minor&quot; subsp. &quot;minor&quot; is believed to have hybridized also with Plot&#x27;s elm to create elms of the &quot;Ulmus&quot; × &quot;viminalis&quot; group, presumed source of the cultivar &#x27;Viminalis&#x27; or &#x27;Antarctica&#x27;.

<doc id="914661" wikidata="Q17086926" url="?curid=914661" title="Revis">
<text>Revis is an American post-grunge band from Carbondale, Illinois. They released one major-label album, &quot;Places for Breathing&quot;, in 2003, before disbanding in 2005. After a five-year hiatus, the band reformed in 2010 and began work on a follow-up EP, &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;. The sessions were so prolific that the project turned into a full album release with a new name, now titled &quot;Do We Have to Beg?&quot; The album was completed and scheduled for release on May 20, 2011, but legal issues and internal disagreements with their record label kept them from releasing it. The band initially announced plans to re-record the entire album without the help of a label, but after a year with few updates, they announced they had broken up in May 2012, without any plans on issuong the album outside of a few songs that had been released previously for promotional purposes. Their best-known song is &quot;Caught in the Rain&quot;, which peaked at No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart in 2003 after appearing on the of the film &quot;Daredevil&quot;.

==History==
===Early years (1999–2001)===
The group, formerly known as Orco, was formed in the summer of 1999 in the small town of Ewing, Illinois. Their first big break came when they beat out 40 other musical groups for the chance to compete against five bands at radio station WTAO&#x27;s Battle of the Bands at the Du Quoin State Fair in August 2000. They won the competition and were offered the opportunity to play live remotes for the station. According to vocalist Justin Holman, &quot;It wasn&#x27;t long after that, that our songs began creeping onto (WTAO&#x27;s) playlist.&quot; The original Orco line-up consisted of Justin Holman (vocals), Robert Davis (guitar), Nathaniel Cox (guitar), Dan Sronce (bass) and Marcus D&#x27;Marco (drums).
The band moved to Los Angeles in July 2001 but, before doing so, had to acquire a new bassist in Bob Thiemann. Despite, as guitarist Robert Davis put it, having enough hometown popularity to &quot;play in front of 1,500 people every Friday night,&quot; the band set their sights for L.A. Orco began playing L.A. venues but had a tough time early on, being kicked out of a rented one-room bedroom and having a dismissive manager with whom they periodically spoke with.

The band&#x27;s earlier material under this name was quite different sounding than their work as Revis. Songs such as &quot;Feast of the Tabernacles&quot; featured a much rougher, unpolished sound, with some screaming vocals.

===&quot;Places for Breathing&quot; (2002–2003)===
With the help of a new manager, John Zagata, they recorded three demo songs, &quot;A Gift,&quot; &quot;Seven,&quot; and &quot;Straight Jacket Labels&quot; with producers Tommy Henriksen and Jeff Pilson. This eventually caught the attention of record labels, and demos for &quot;Caught in the Rain&quot; and &quot;Spin&quot; were subsequently recorded to maintain hype. In January 2002, the band signed with Epic Records to start work on their first album at NRG Recording in North Hollywood. Some of their demo songs would end up on their debut album; others were written during NRG&#x27;s recording session.

It was during the five weeks of recording that the band was forced to change its name to Revis because a UK band had been using the Orco name for six years compared to the American band&#x27;s three years. They chose the name &quot;Revis&quot; after their close friend and guitar tech Jason Revis who had been with the band since its inception even without pay; only through their joining a major label would he finally start being paid.

The end result of their efforts was a debut album entitled &quot;Places for Breathing&quot;, which was released on May 20, 2003. The album debuted at No. 1 on Billboard&#x27;s Heatseekers chart, selling 10,000 copies in its opening week, and peaked at No. 115 on the Billboard Top 200.
Revis released two singles to rock radio hits, &quot;Caught in the Rain&quot;, and &quot;Seven&quot;. The first single, &quot;Caught in the Rain&quot; peaked at number 8 on the Mainstream Rock Radio charts during a 26-week chart run, and was on the Billboard Alternative Rock charts for 16 weeks, peaking at number 20. It was also featured in the movie &quot;Daredevil&quot; and its respective soundtrack, &quot;&quot;. The second single, &quot;Seven&quot;, charted on Billboard&#x27;s Mainstream Rock chart, but only peaking at number 29 over its ten weeks on the chart.
The band&#x27;s hometown of Carbondale announced May 19, 2003 &quot;Revis Day&quot; in tribute to the group.

The band went on to support the album by touring with popular groups like Oleander, and Evanescence, and playing the 2003 Nintendo Fusion Tour.

===Breakup (2004–2009)===
In 2004, Revis recorded a second demo with Tony Berg and had intentions of rerecording such tracks for a second album. Despite the band&#x27;s rising popularity, however, Revis would be dropped from Epic Records and forced to acquire new management after their first album. Holman speculated this being due to poor management and the merging of BMG and Sony. Around this time, Davis and Piribauer had joined a band named Hensley and caused question over the future of Revis. Holman and Cox, without Davis, Piribauer, or Thiemann, returned to Illinois and together began writing new material akin to Revis. As of August 2005, Holman affirmed that he and Tommy Henriksen were working on 12–15 new songs with titles such as &quot;New Ways,&quot; &quot;Hollow Days,&quot; &quot;Red Letter Day,&quot; and &quot;Taste in the Flash.&quot; However, he clarified that they would not be working with Don Gilmore or Ken Andrews and showed uncertainty in regards to finding a label and touring. Later in the year, it was announced that Revis had ultimately disbanded.

While the band had broken up, a number of members did their own projects. Davis and Cox had formed a new band by the name of Maryandi, later renamed The Yelling. Holman worked with a new project called Aujalyn. The bassist Thiemann went on to form TJ Brown, Dove Lane and Deep Space Radio.

===Reunion, canceled albums, and second breakup (2010–2012)===
Reports of a Revis reunion surfaced in early 2010, saying that they were back together and working on a second album. However, original guitarist Nathaniel Cox and bassist Bob Thiemann decided not to take part in the reunion.

The band originally announced two separate releases, an EP titled &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;, and a full-length album to follow, titled &quot;Gone So Long&quot;. &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;, was announced to be released on July 27, 2010, but the album was delayed, and the two releases were consolidated into one single album, titled &quot;Do We Have to Beg?&quot;.

Despite the delayed release, the band did release some single songs. The first song released after the reunion was &quot;A Better Day (Relief)&quot; in June 2010. A second track, &quot;Are You Taking Me Home,&quot; was released a few months later in October 2010. It was mixed by Jay Baumgardner and was released on October 6, 2010, via the band&#x27;s website. Later in the month, the band played their first live concert since their reunion. The band debuted a new song, titled &quot;Remember When&quot;, at the concert and released a studio acoustic version of a new track, &quot;Searching for Someone&quot; afterwards. The band rounded out the year with a re-recorded version of the track &quot;From That Point On,&quot; a B-side left off their first album.

In February 2011, the band announced that &quot;Do We Have to Beg?&quot; would be released on May 20, 2011, to coincide with the 8 year anniversary of the release of &quot;Places for Breathing&quot;. A track list wasn&#x27;t announced, but some song information was revealed. An electric, full-band version of &quot;Searching For Someone&quot; was initially announced as the first single, but the band changed their mind and decided to release &quot;Save Our Souls&quot; as the first single. Additionally, the album was to consist of 12 songs selected from a group of 25 recorded songs. &quot;Save Our Souls&quot; was released on April 1.

While the band announced the Turnstyle Tour to support the album, the tour was canceled on May 13, just a week before the album&#x27;s projected release date, due to circumstances that were beyond their control. After a week of silence and no promotion, the album release was quietly delayed indefinitely, without a new date, due to undisclosed legal issues.

In June, the band released a final track from the sessions, &quot;Fire and Ice&quot;, as an apology and &quot;thank you&quot; for the patience from their fans. However, it wasn&#x27;t until August, three months after the album delay, that the band announced that legal issues kept them from ever releasing the album in its then-current form, so they are currently in the process of re-recording the entire album. After four more months of silence, drummer David Piribauer reiterated the band&#x27;s intent to re-record the album, blaming the lack of progress on his seriously injured leg.

After four more months of silence, almost a year after the album&#x27;s initial release date, guitarist Robert Davis confirmed that Revis had disbanded. The issues regarding &quot;Do We Have To Beg?&quot; not being released involved what the band perceived as an unfair contract with the record label. The band disagreed about how to continue, re-recording of their second album never took off, and the band members eventually stopped contacting each other. There is still no intention to ever release the second album.

Davis summed up the band&#x27;s label issues and eventual demise: We had no contract with the label the whole time we were working with them, and they were helping us start our career and put money towards a tour...We went back to the same studio and had this conversation with Jay Baumgardner, and he said he’d love to sign us but they weren’t close to getting contracts done. So we said let’s start recording and get the ball rolling, and we did, but then this contract got presented to us that just wasn’t fair. It just didn’t make any sense, and we wouldn’t have been able to survive off the terms. We went out and did a little bit of touring, and that got cut short because of the financing, and then we couldn’t see eye to eye about the choice to keep going. I wanted to keep touring, Justin didn’t. He wanted something more secure, and I said let’s just play the shows because there were fans out there, but we just didn’t see eye to eye. I’m not saying I was right or I was wrong, we just couldn’t decide what we should do and we couldn’t be together any more. Later on we had some more conversations that went in the same direction, and we couldn’t see eye to eye. Eventually we just stopped talking. There were so many good songs that I want to get out there, but we just can’t put them out with that band. I’m doing everything I can to help [the songs] see the light of day through other projects.
Davis did iterate that some of the songs may still see release as part of the future &quot;Save Our Souls&quot; documentary soundtrack, which, despite the name, is not about the Revis song, but about the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the burlesque industry of New Orleans.

===Second reunion and &quot;Bottles of Lightning&quot; (2024)===
On March 15, 2024, Revis announced a second reunion (including Holman, Davis, Cox, Thiemann, and Piribauer) and three live performance dates. The band subsequently released &quot;Bottles of Lightning&quot;, an EP containing six songs. It became available on streaming platforms on May 2, 2024.

&quot;Bottles of Lightning&quot; features Holman on vocals, Robert Davis and Nathaniel Cox on guitar, and David Piribauer on drums. The EP was written, produced, and mixed by Nathaniel Cox and Robert Davis.

<text>The Nissan Almera is a line of automobiles that has been manufactured by the Japanese car manufacturer Nissan since 1995. For its early generations, the Almera is a compact car (C-segment), essentially being the European export-market version of the Pulsar for the first-generation model (N15), and the Bluebird Sylphy for the second-generation model (N16). Since the third-generation model (N17), the Almera nameplate was repositioned to a subcompact or B-segment saloon based on the V platform. The N17 Almera is marketed globally with the usage of five other nameplates for various markets.

The Almera nameplate has also been used for several other unrelated models, including the South Korean-manufactured Samsung SM3 in various export markets worldwide, and for the second-generation Nissan Bluebird Sylphy in Russia.


== First generation (N15; 1995) ==

The first Almera rolled off the production line in late 1995, as a replacement for the Nissan Sunny (N14), a nameplate which had been in use for nearly 30 years. The Almera was almost identical to the Nissan Pulsar (N15) sold in Japan, except with different trim options and petrol engine range.

At the time of introduction in 1995, power came from 1.4-litre GA14DE and 1.6-litre GA16DE petrol units or from a 2.0-litre CD20 diesel engine. About one year into production a 2.0-litre, SR20DE-engined GTi was added to the range. The 1.4, 1.6 and 2.0D engines were available as a three- and five-door hatchback or as a four-door saloon, whereas the GTi was only available in three-door hatch.

In the United Kingdom, the Almera was originally marketed by Nissan as &quot;the car they don&#x27;t want you to drive&quot;. Almost all Almeras sold in the UK were hatchbacks with three or five doors in contrast to regions such as Ireland, where the saloon version is substantially more commonplace. The level of specification was good, with all models getting power steering, driver airbag, electric mirrors and stereo as standard. Throughout the life of the Almera, many &#x27;special editions&#x27; models were available but most of them didn&#x27;t feature anything above other models.

=== Pre-facelift ===
Typical models offered were as follows, with each market differing in detail:
* 1.4 S, LX, GX, Si GA14DE
* 1.6 SLX, SR/SRi GA16DE
* 2.0 GTi SR20DE
* 2.0D GX, SLX CD20

The top versions included &#x27;high spec&#x27; bumpers with foglights (optional on the Si model), alloy wheels from 1996 onwards (Different size and design between Si/SRi 14&quot; and GTi 15&quot;), and rear roof lip spoilers (GTi models sported an integrated brake light, also spoilers were optional on the Si). In later model years there was a profusion of special models and market-specific equipment levels like the Comfort, Ambiente, Esteem, Precision and many others.

The 2.0-litre GTi had an optional, aggressive-looking factory body kit which included BMW M3-style side skirts and front/rear splitters. Non-bodykit models came with a simpler plastic front splitter. The GTi also featured uprated suspension, front and rear strut braces and a quicker steering rack along with the 2-litre engine.

=== Facelift ===
The Almera received a facelift for the 1998 model year. For the phase 2, the front bumpers were redesigned, front splitters were added on the Si/SRi, and the GTi had all-round body kit as standard (although there was also a delete option available), and now all of the lip spoilers had integrated brake lights. The original telescopic radio aerial was moved from the drivers A-pillar to the rear of the roof and was changed to a &quot;bee-sting&quot; type. On the GTi, the phase 2 headlights and front indicators featured a black surround.

Towards the end of production around the start of 1999, the GTi models came standard with all optional extras as standard from the factory such as ABS, A/C, updated interior trim, front seat pockets and so forth.

== Second generation (N16; 2000) ==

Launched in January 2000, the second-generation Almera differed from its predecessor with smoother and more curved lines. For Europe, this generation of Almera was produced at the Sunderland factory, which had opened in 1986 and produced the Micra, Primera and originally the Bluebird.

The N16 Almera is based on Nissan&#x27;s global MS platform, which was Nissan&#x27;s first new platform to be developed after the partnership with Renault. The MS platform is also the base for the P12 Primera and Almera Tino.

The second-generation Almera was available in three different body styles, a three- or five-door hatch and a four-door saloon with 1.5, 1.6, and 1.8 Nissan QG engine series petrol engines as well as a 2.2 direct injection turbo-diesel (110 bhp) (&quot;YD22DDT&quot;) or common-rail turbo-diesel (136 bhp) (&quot;YD22DDTi&quot;). Almeras can be also equipped with 1.5 common-rail turbo-diesel (dCi) from the Renault Mégane II – Nissan had recently ventured with Renault and the Almera&#x27;s diesel engine was one of the first instances of Nissan and Renaults sharing mechanicals. Early versions of the 1.5-litre engine were fitted with a mechanical throttle, which was later replaced by a drive-by-wire electronic throttle.

The Almera five-door hatchback was exported from the UK to Australia and New Zealand and sold as part of the Nissan Pulsar (N16) lineup in these countries. The Almera saloon is based on the Bluebird Sylphy, but has a different front end.

While the previous generation Almera was considered spacious for its class, the N16 Almera was noted to be lacking in rear passenger legroom due to a slightly shorter than category average wheelbase.

=== Facelift ===
In 2003, the Almera was facelifted with updated styling, retuned suspension, new engines and an updated interior.

First, the Almera&#x27;s MacPherson strut front suspension and multi-link rear suspension (Nissan&#x27;s name for its double lateral link twist beam suspension) had been retuned. This resulted in a quieter ride and a reduction in the amount of rear bump-through experienced when heavily laden, improving high-speed stability, driving dynamics and making the car more controllable after an emergency maneuver. The new suspension tuning also proved to produce almost no body roll on tight turns. Overall, Nissan said, the Almera had slightly firmer damper settings and marginally stiffer spring ratings; though there had been no loss of ride comfort or increase in noise levels in normal motoring. The suspension revisions had been executed in such a way as to only come into play at the upper edge of the dynamic envelope.

The facelift also included new chrome, projector-style headlights that were set in a titanium-coloured surround with separate lights for main and low beams set behind an enlarged translucent cover. The front bumper had an integrated engine air intake that ran almost the full width of the car while a honeycomb mesh grille added visual benefits to the frontal image. Some models also got small circular fog lights.

The interior of the facelifted Almera had also been redesigned with better quality materials and a large colour or monochrome centre screen which controlled all of the car&#x27;s functions (climate control, CD player and trip computer) was fitted to most models apart from S and Pulse. Higher trim levels also included Nissan&#x27;s Bird-eye GPS system. ESP (Electronic Stability Program) was fitted to SE, SVE and the range topping SXE (which also got a switch to turn the ESP on or off).

Additionally there was a change to the diesel model lineup. Nissan introduced new version of Common Rail 2.2 Diesel with 6-speed gearbox.

=== Production ===
The facelifted Almera was built in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, UK, and exported to parts of the Asia-Pacific where it was sold as the Nissan Pulsar. In 2006 the second-generation Almera reached its sixth year of production but was still selling strongly worldwide. It was also sold in Mexico in three versions: a five-door manual five-speed, a five-door automatic three-speed &quot;Comfort&quot; model and a three-door &quot;Sport&quot; version equipped with side curtain air bags, fog lamps and a five-speed manual transmission.

The Almera finished production on 28 November 2007, but it was not instantly replaced. The Tiida was introduced in several countries as a replacement model throughout 2007 and 2008; although it wasn&#x27;t officially imported to the United Kingdom (where the Qashqai crossover is the model generally considered to be its successor), it was available there through the Arnold Clark dealership network from March 2009 with models sourced from the Republic of Ireland. There were several Almeras registered in 2008 in Ireland despite production ending in 2007.

== Third generation (N17; 2011) ==

The N17 Almera was first introduced in China at the Guangzhou Auto Show in December 2010, where it was marketed as the Nissan Sunny. It went on sale in January 2011. Based on the company&#x27;s global V platform, the model was touted as a saloon for the global market, as it was gradually marketed across 170 countries with assemblies conducted in numerous American, African, and Asian countries.

In October 2011, Nissan debuted the model in Thailand as the Almera. It was positioned as an entry-level saloon for the Eco Car programme in Thailand, requiring for a 1.2-litre engine to be adopted. The Almera name is also used for the model in Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Australia, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, South Africa, and Nigeria.

In the Americas, it is badged as the Nissan Versa. It went on sale in North America in July 2011, and in Brazil in October 2011.

The Sunny nameplate is also used in India, Vietnam, and various Middle Eastern countries. The N17 Almera was also exported from Thailand to Japan since October 2012 until December 2016, where it was marketed as the . Under the joint venture established with Renault, the model was also marketed as the Renault Scala in India between 2012 and 2017, featuring minor redesigns.

After the release of the succeeding N18 model, the N17 saloon continued to be produced in several countries. In India, since 2020 the vehicle is no longer sold in the country, instead it is solely produced for export to GCC countries as the Sunny Classic. The model is also continued to be produced in Mexico where it is marketed as the Nissan V-Drive since 2019 to distinguish it with the N18 Versa. The V-Drive nameplate was also used in Brazil for the same purpose until its end of production in the country in September 2021. In Malaysia, the model is also sold alongside its successor as the Almera Black Series. Production of the N17 Sunny ended in China since 2019 without any successor.

=== Markets ===

==== Japan ====
The Japanese-market model was released as the Nissan Latio on 5 October 2012. Its release was delayed due to power shortages in Japan caused by the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. Imported from Thailand, the Latio is equipped with a 1.2-litre engine producing and . It was offered with three trim levels. The Latio was discontinued in Japan on 26 December 2016 due to poor sales.

==== Southeast Asia ====
The Thai-specification model was released as the Almera on 7 October 2011 as part of the Eco Car programme. It uses the same 1.2-litre engine as the Nissan March, with a fuel consumption of , and has either a five-speed manual or a continuously variable transmission (CVT).

The Almera was also built in Santa Rosa, Laguna, Philippines. Other Asian countries receive the Almera, including Malaysia and Singapore where it was offered with the 1.5-litre &quot;HR15DE&quot; engine, mated with either a four-speed automatic or a five-speed manual transmission.

In Indonesia, the Almera was used only as a taxi fleet and was not sold for private consumers, citing low demand for supermini saloons in the country.

In Malaysia, the model is sold as the Almera and was launched in October 2012. Three variants were offered: E (manual and auto), V (auto only) and VL (auto only). All variants are powered by the 1.5-litre HR15DE engine. The facelift N17 Almera was launched in Malaysia in January 2015.

==== India ====
In India, the vehicle was marketed as the Sunny and was introduced in September 2011. Renault marketed a modified version as the Renault Scala, which was launched in August 2012. It was discontinued in May 2020, alongside the Micra supermini due to both cars not being compliant with India&#x27;s Bharat Stage VI emissions standards. Production continues for exports, mostly to GCC markets.

==== Australia ====
The Australian model was released as the Almera in August 2012. The model range is powered by a 1.5-litre petrol straight-four engine. Sales were low, with a high proportion of sales to fleet and rental car buyers. Nissan Australia discontinued the Almera in July 2014. Trim levels available were the entry-level ST with a five-speed manual or optional four-speed automatic and the automatic-only TI specification.

==== South Africa ====
The Almera was launched in South Africa in August 2013. The car was sold only in Acenta trim and powered by a 1.5-litre petrol straight-four engine, with either a 5 speed manual or 4 speed automatic gearbox, priced at R165 000 and R175 000 respectively. The Almera was imported from India and replaced domestically built Grand Livina and Tiida models. The car was face lifted in September 2014, with prices increasing to R177 600 for the manual version and R189 100 for the automatic. The Almera continued to be sold in South Africa until 2023 when imports from India ended, leaving only run out units on sale and Nissan without a sedan in its South African line-up. The final units were priced at R291 900 for the manual and R310 000 for the automatic.

==== Americas ====
The US-spec model was unveiled at the 2011 New York International Auto Show as the second generation Nissan Versa. It is powered by a 1.6-litre petrol that delivers around of power and of torque. The fuel economy is estimated to be city and highway with the CVT-equipped model. In the US, the Versa saloon went on sale in August 2011. It was considered to be the least-expensive new car in the US market in 2013.

For the 2015 model year, the Versa received its facelift, with redesigned tail lights and larger headlights. The model was also sold in Latin America as the Versa, also with a 1.6-litre petrol engine.

It was succeeded by the Nissan Micra K13 in 2014 for the Canadian market; the Versa was discontinued there due to slow sales.

In 2016, the Versa was positioned as the replacement of the discontinued Nissan Sunny B13 (known locally as Tsuru). As the result, the Versa became in 2017 the best-selling car in Mexico. In Mexico and Latin America, the N17 Versa was renamed as V-Drive since 2019 to avoid confusion with the new generation Versa launched in October 2019, dropping the Sense and Advance trim lines.

On 25 August 2021, the V-Drive was updated for the Mexican market, incorporating six airbags and stability control as standard.

<doc id="914700" wikidata="Q5439684" url="?curid=914700" title="Feature interaction problem">
<text>Feature interaction is a software engineering concept. It occurs when the integration of two features would modify the behavior of one or both features. 

The term &quot;feature&quot; is used to denote a unit of functionality of a software application. Similar to many concepts in computer science, the term can be used at different levels of abstraction. For example, the plain old telephone service (POTS) is a telephony application feature at one level, but itself is composed of originating features and terminating features. The originating features may in turn include the provide dial tone feature, digit collection feature and so on.

This definition of &quot;feature interaction&quot; allows one to focus on certain behavior of the interacting features such as how their response time may be changed given the integration. Many researchers in the field consider problems that arise due to change in the execution &quot;behavior&quot; of the interacting features. Under that context, the &quot;behavior&quot; of a feature is defined by its execution flow and output for a given input. In other words, the interaction changes the execution flow and output of the interacting features for a given input.

==Example==
In the context of telephony, a telephone line (the system) typically offers a set of features that include call forwarding and call waiting. Call waiting allows one call to be suspended while a second call is answered, while call forwarding enables a customer to specify a secondary phone number to which additional calls will be forwarded in the event that the customer is already using the phone.

To illustrate the example, we consider a telephone line provided to a customer, and we assume that both call forwarding and call waiting are enabled on the line. When a first call arrives on the line, the phone rings and is answered. Since neither feature is activated by the first call, there is no noticeable problem. When a second call arrives before the first has terminated, the telephone system has a decision to make: whether the call should be forwarded to the secondary number (call forwarding) or the person who answered the first call should be notified that another call has arrived (call waiting). Since this decision has no obvious correct answer, the optimal answer depends on the needs of the customer. This &quot;feature interaction&quot; is a specific example of a general and common problem that has become prevalent due to increasing system complexity.

In this situation, it is possible that the system’s decision will be made in a non-deterministic fashion due to race conditions and other design factors. The consequences of feature interactions can range from minor irritations to life-threatening software failures, and therefore there is ongoing research that aims to find ways of &quot;detecting&quot; as well as &quot;resolving&quot; feature interactions.

<doc id="914712" wikidata="Q4713314" url="?curid=914712" title="Alcohol inhalation">
<text>Alcohol inhalation is a method of administering alcohol directly into the respiratory system, with aid of a vaporizing or nebulizing device or bag. It is chiefly applied for recreational use, when it is also referred to as alcohol smoking, but it has medical applications for testing on laboratory rats, and treatment of pulmonary edema and viral pneumonia. Depending on precise definition of &quot;alcohol&quot;, &quot;botanical alcohol inhalation&quot; can be a subgenre of aromatherapy.

==Methods==

===AWOL===
The practice gained popularity in 2004, with the marketing of a device dubbed AWOL (Alcohol without liquid), a play on the military term AWOL (Absent Without Leave). AWOL, created by British businessman Dominic Simler, was first introduced in Asia and Europe and then in United States in August 2004. AWOL was used by nightclubs, at gatherings and parties, and it garnered attraction as a novelty, as people &#x27;enjoyed passing it around in a group&#x27;. 

AWOL was gimmicked as an alcohol &quot;vaporizer&quot;, implying that it would heat the liquid until it entered a gaseous state, but is in fact a nebulizer, a machine that agitates the liquid into an aerosol. AWOL&#x27;s official website states that &quot;AWOL and AWOL 1 are powered by &quot;Electrical Air Compressors&quot; while AWOL 2 and AWOL 3 are powered by &quot;electrical oxygen generators&quot;&quot;, which refer to mechanisms used by the device for facilitating inhalation. Although the AWOL machine is marketed as having no downsides, such as the lack of calories or hangovers, Amanda Shaffer of &quot;Slate&quot; describes these claims as &quot;dubious at best&quot;. Although inhaled alcohol does reduce the caloric content, the savings are minimal. 

After expressed safety and health concerns, sale or use of AWOL machines was banned in a number of American states. The AWOL device was later followed by new products for alcohol inhalation, such as &quot;Vaportini&quot;, created in 2009, which uses simple thermal vaporization.

===Bag-in-box wines===
Some people attempt inhaling alcohol fumes from any container, including emptied bag-in-box wine bags. While these bags may only contain a residual amount of alcohol, inhaling the concentrated fumes can lead to rapid intoxication, even at low volumes. The intoxicating effect may be brief, lasting around a minute. However, the safety has not been scientifically researched so it may be riskful.

==Recreational use==
To inhale alcohol, it must be first converted from liquid into gaseous state (vapor) or aerosol (mist). For recreational use, a variety of methods have been invented. Alcohol can be vaporized by pouring it over dry ice in a narrow container and inhaling with a straw. However, this method must be used with caution due to the large amounts of carbon dioxide released. Another method is to pour alcohol in a corked bottle with a pipe, and then use a bicycle pump to make a spray. Alcohol can be vaporized using a simple container and open-flame heater. Medical devices such as asthma nebulizers and inhalers were also reported as means of application.

==Effects and health concerns==
There are occupational health and safety risks of inhaling alcohol vapor and mists. Inhalation devices make it &quot;substantially easier to overdose on alcohol&quot; than drinking, because the alcohol bypasses the stomach and liver and goes directly into the bloodstream, and because the user does not have a reliable way of determining how much alcohol they have taken in. Inhaled alcohol cannot be purged from the body by vomiting, which is the body&#x27;s main protection against alcohol poisoning. Inhaled alcohol can dry out nasal passages and make them more susceptible to infection. There is also a potential increased risk of addiction.

==Medical applications==
Inhalation of vapor obtained by nebulization of water and ethanol in oxygen has been used in treatment of pulmonary edema in humans. Alcohol vapor acts as an anti-foaming agent in the lungs, so the sputum becomes more liquid, and can be easily expelled. The method has also been used to reduce the alcohol withdrawal syndrome in patients who had intestinal tract surgeries. 

==Regulation==

In the United States, many state legislatures have banned alcohol inhalation machines. Support for such legislation comes from groups fighting underage drinking and drunk driving, including alcohol companies such as Diageo and industry groups such as the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States (DISCUS).

<text>Ludvig Mylius-Erichsen (15 January 1872 – 25 November 1907) was a Danish author, ethnologist, and explorer, from Ringkøbing. He was most notably an explorer of Greenland.

==Literary expedition==
With Count Harald Moltke and Knud Rasmussen Mylius-Erichsen formed the Danish Literary Expedition (1902–04) to West Greenland, and, in the early stages (1902), discovered, near Evighedsfjord, two ice-free mountain ranges. The party later proceeded to Cape York and lived for 10 months in native fashion with the Eskimo. The return journey of the expedition to Upernavik across the ice of Melville Bay was the first sledge crossing on record.

==Denmark expedition==

As commander of the Denmark Expedition (1906–08) Mylius-Erichsen undertook and carried out the task of exploring and charting the entire coastline of unknown northeast Greenland by three months&#x27; field work. The expedition made sledge journeys of more than 4000 miles (6,436 km), exceeding the record of any single Arctic force. The main travel, excluding duplications, of Johan Peter Koch was some 1250 miles (2011 km), and that of Mylius-Erichsen must have exceeded 1000 miles (1609 km). Their explorations showed that Robert Peary&#x27;s chart of a coast trending southeast from Navy Cliff was radically incorrect. Instead the shore ran to the northeast, adding about 100,000 square miles (259,000 km2) to Greenland and extending it about halfway from Navy Cliff—where the maps wrongly placed Greenland Sea—to Spitzbergen. Mylius-Erichsen&#x27;s own exploration proved that Peary Channel did not exist. Two years later Ejnar Mikkelsen (1880–1971), leader of a new Danish Greenland expedition, assumed the channel existed until he found Mylius-Erichsen&#x27;s report in a cairn at the head of Danmark Fjord, where Mylius-Erichsen had written emphatically that: 
Mylius-Erichsen established the continuity of Greenland from Cape Farewell, 60° N, to the most northern land ever reached, 83° 39&#x27; N. He also discovered and explored the great fiords of Danmark, Hagen, and Brønlund.

===Death===
Misled by existing maps, Mylius-Erichsen with Niels Peter Høeg Hagen and the Greenlander Jørgen Brønlund so prolonged his journey that a return to the ship that spring was impossible, and they were forced to spend the summer in the area of the Denmark Fjord without the necessary footgear for hunting in the stony area. The need for food for men and dogs forced them to reduce their three dogteams to one. Finally, in September, they were able to start their return journey on the new frozen sea ice, around the northeastern corner of Greenland. However, when they arrived at the southern shore of Mallemuk Mountain, they found open water and were forced to travel inland. En route, Mylius-Erichsen and Hagen perished of starvation, exhaustion, and cold walking on the ice of Nioghalvfjerdsfjorden. Hagen&#x27;s map sketches and the body of Brønlund together with his diary were found next spring by Koch in Lambert Land. Some cairn reports, left at Danmark Fjord by Mylius-Erichsen, were found and brought to Copenhagen by Ejnar Mikkelsen in 1912.

<doc id="914720" wikidata="Q265638" url="?curid=914720" title="Obiter dictum">
<text>Obiter dictum (usually used in the plural, obiter dicta) is a Latin phrase meaning &quot;said in passing&quot;, that is, any remark in a legal opinion that is &quot;said in passing&quot; by a judge or arbitrator. It is a concept derived from English common law, whereby a judgment comprises only two elements: &quot;ratio decidendi&quot; and &quot;obiter dicta&quot;. For the purposes of judicial precedent, &quot;ratio decidendi&quot; is binding, whereas &quot;obiter dicta&quot; are persuasive only.

==Significance==
A judicial statement can be &quot;ratio decidendi&quot; only if it refers to the crucial facts and law of the case. Statements that are not crucial, or which refer to hypothetical facts or to unrelated law issues, are &quot;obiter dicta&quot;. &quot;Obiter dicta&quot; (often simply &quot;dicta&quot;, or &quot;obiter&quot;) are remarks or observations made by a judge that, although included in the body of the court&#x27;s opinion, do not form a necessary part of the court&#x27;s decision. In a court opinion, &quot;obiter dicta&quot; include, but are not limited to, words &quot;introduced by way of illustration, or analogy or argument&quot;. Unlike &quot;ratio decidendi&quot;, &quot;obiter dicta&quot; are not the subject of the judicial decision, even if they happen to be correct statements of law. The so-called Wambaugh&#x27;s Inversion Test provides that to determine whether a judicial statement is &quot;ratio&quot; or &quot;obiter&quot;, you should invert the argument, that is to say, ask whether the decision would have been different, had the statement been omitted. If so, the statement is crucial and is &quot;ratio&quot;; whereas if it is not crucial, it is &quot;obiter&quot;.

If a court rules that it lacks jurisdiction to hear a case (or dismisses the case on a technicality), but still goes on to offer opinions on the merits of the case, such opinions may constitute &quot;obiter dicta&quot;. Other instances of &quot;obiter dicta&quot; may occur where a judge makes an aside to provide context for the opinion, or makes a thorough exploration of a relevant area of law. If a judge, by way of illumination, provides a hypothetical example, this would be obiter even if relevant because it would not be on the facts of the case, as in the Carlill case (below).

University of Florida scholars Teresa Reid-Rambo and Leanne Pflaum explain the process by which &quot;obiter dicta&quot; may become binding. They write that: 

==In the United Kingdom==
Under the doctrine of &quot;stare decisis&quot;, statements constituting &quot;obiter dicta&quot; are not binding, although in some jurisdictions, such as England and Wales, they can be strongly persuasive. For instance, in the &quot;High Trees&quot; case, Mr Justice Denning was not content merely to grant the landlord&#x27;s claim, but added that had the landlord sought to recover the back rent from the war years, equity would have estopped him from doing so. Given that the landlord did not wish to recover any back rent, Denning&#x27;s addition was clearly &quot;obiter&quot;, yet this statement became the basis for the modern revival of promissory estoppel. Similarly, in &quot;Hedley Byrne &amp; Co Ltd v Heller &amp; Partners Ltd&quot;, the House of Lords held, &quot;obiter&quot;, that negligent misstatement could give rise to a claim for pure economic loss, even though, on the facts, a disclaimer was effective in quashing any claim. Also, in &quot;Scruttons Ltd v Midland Silicones Ltd&quot;, Lord Reid proposed that while doctrine of privity of contract prevented the stevedores in this instance from benefiting from protection of an exemption clause, in future such protection could be effective if four guidelines (which he went on to list) were all met. In &quot;Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company&quot; (a case whether a woman who had used a smoke ball as prescribed could claim the advertised reward after catching influenza), Bowen LJ said:
==In the United States==
United States Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;obiter dicta&quot; can be influential. One example in the Supreme Court&#x27;s history is the 1886 case &quot;Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Co.&quot;. A passing remark from Chief Justice Morrison R. Waite, recorded by the court reporter before oral argument, now forms the basis for the doctrine that juristic persons are entitled to protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Whether or not Chief Justice Waite&#x27;s remark constitutes binding precedent is arguable, but subsequent rulings treat it as such.

In other instances, &quot;obiter dicta&quot; can suggest an interpretation of law that has no bearing on the case at hand but might be useful in future cases. The most notable instance of such an occurrence is the history of the famous Footnote 4 to &quot;United States v. Carolene Products Co.&quot; (1938), which, while rejecting use of the Due Process Clause to block most legislation, suggested that the clause might be applied to strike down legislation dealing with questions of &quot;fundamental right&quot;. This &quot;obiter dictum&quot; is generally considered to have led to the doctrine of strict scrutiny (and subsequently intermediate scrutiny) in racial-, religious-, and sexual-discrimination cases, first articulated in &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot; (1944). The judgment of &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot; was itself condemned by the same court in &quot;obiter dictum&quot; in &quot;Trump v. Hawaii&quot; (2018).

==Dissenting judgments or opinions==
The arguments and reasoning of a dissenting judgment (the term used in the United Kingdom also constitute &quot;obiter dicta&quot;. These, however, might also be cited should a court determine that its previous decision was in error, as when the United States Supreme Court cited Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.&#x27;s dissent in &quot;Hammer v. Dagenhart&quot; when it overturned &quot;Hammer&quot; in &quot;United States v. Darby Lumber Co.&quot;

In &quot;Shaw v DPP&quot; [1962] a publisher of the &quot;Ladies Directory&quot; (a guide to London prostitutes) was convicted of &quot;conspiracy to corrupt public morals&quot;. He appealed on the grounds that no such offence existed. The House of Lords dismissed the appeal, in effect creating a new crime. Viscount Simonds said: &quot;...there remains in the Courts of Law a residual power ... to conserve the moral welfare of the State, and ... guard it against attacks which may be the more insidious because they are novel and unprepared for.&quot; In a dissenting judgment, Lord Reid said: &quot;Parliament is the proper place, ... to [create new criminal laws]. Where Parliament fears to tread it is not for the courts to rush in.&quot; Subsequently, Lord Reid was the leading judge in &quot;Knuller v. DPP&quot;, a case on obscene libel in which a publisher was charged with &quot;conspiracy to corrupt public morals&quot;. In this case, Lord Reid said he still disagreed with the majority decision in &quot;Shaw&quot;, but in the interests of certainty he would not overturn &quot;Shaw&quot;.

== &quot;Semble&quot; ==
Akin to &quot;obiter&quot; is the concept of &quot;semble&quot; (Norman French for &quot;it seems&quot;), indicating that the point is uncertain or represents only the judge&#x27;s opinion. For example, in &quot;Simpkins v Pays&quot; (1955), a grandmother, granddaughter and a lodger entered into weekly competitions in the &quot;Sunday Empire News&quot;. Each week, all three women together made a forecast and each contributed to the cost of entry; but it was the grandmother&#x27;s name that was on the coupon. The grandmother received £750 in prize money and refused to share it with the other two. The lodger successfully sued for one third of the prize money; but Sellers J added &quot;semble&quot; that the granddaughter should also get £250, even though she had not been a party to the action.

<text>Russell Kommer Myers (born October 9, 1938) is an American cartoonist best known for his newspaper comic strip &quot;Broom-Hilda&quot;.

Born in Pittsburg, Kansas, Myers was raised in Oklahoma where his father taught at the University of Tulsa. Myers was interested in cartooning from an early age. After his first strip submission for syndication failed, he began working for Hallmark Cards in Kansas City, MO in 1960 as an illustrator of greeting cards. He continued to submit comic strip concepts for syndication in his free time.

==&quot;Broom-Hilda&quot;==
The idea for &quot;Broom-Hilda&quot; originally came from writer Elliott Caplin, brother of cartoonist Al Capp, who described the character to Myers. Myers designed the characters and wrote the scripts. Caplin acted as Myers&#x27; business agent and submitted &quot;Broom-Hilda&quot; to the Chicago Tribune Syndicate where it was accepted. The first strip was published on 19 April 1970.

==Personal==
Russell and Marina Myers married in 1964 and lived in the Kansas City area until moving to Grants Pass, Oregon. The Myers family includes son Stewart and daughter Rosie. As Russell Myers noted, &quot;We live in Oregon with seven dogs, three horses, and a pond full of koi and grow moss on our north sides. His hobbies include reading, collecting old cars, and hanging out at our local Saturday night dirt track, where I sponsor a car and wish I was brave enough to drive.&quot;

==Awards==
Myers received the 1975 National Cartoonists Society&#x27;s Best Humor Strip Award.
In 2024, Myers received a Gold Key from the National Cartoonists Society, which is awarded by unanimous vote of the NCS Board of Directors. The Gold Key honors the recipient as a National Cartoonists Society Hall of Fame member.

<doc id="914735" wikidata="Q6648959" url="?curid=914735" title="Little Aston">
<text>Little Aston is a village in the Lichfield District of Staffordshire, England. It is south of the city of Lichfield. It is contiguous with Sutton Coldfield and Streetly. At the 2011 United Kingdom census the population of Little Aston ward was 2,920 people living in 1,104 households. Little Aston is also in the parish of Shenstone.

== Location and boundaries ==
Little Aston is located in the southeast of Staffordshire.

Little Aston is contained within four corners, formed by local landmarks: Blake Street Station rail bridge in the east, by Little Aston Golf Club&#x27;s grounds to the west, the Little Aston Severn Trent sewage treatment works to the north and the Rosemary Hill Road/Thornhill Road traffic island in the south.

At the south is the Sutton Park, with over of wild grasslands, forested areas, lakes and wild ponies, all accessible though the bordering Streetly Gate. In the north is the Little Aston Recreation Ground, winner of the 2015 Most Improved Fields in Trust Award. This community funded play field with over 3000 trees serves as a community hub with annual events.

== Residences ==

Little Aston&#x27;s small community is divided between nine main areas: Little Aston Park, Claverdon Park, Rosemary Hill Road, Little Aston Lane, Forge Lane, Walsall Road, Aldridge Road, Little Aston Hall and Lady Aston Park.

===Little Aston Park===

Located in the south of the village is Little Aston Park. Often referred to as &quot;Millionaire&#x27;s Row&quot; - with Roman Road being the most expensive street in Staffordshire - it is a privately maintained estate, consisting of around 100 unique, architect-designed houses and includes Birmingham&#x27;s most expensive house ever sold at £7.5 million. It also contains one of the village&#x27;s championship golf clubs, Little Aston Golf Club, and St.Peter&#x27;s Church. The park is located in a woodland setting around the historic rhododendron-lined Roman Road which closely follows path of the ancient Roman Icknield Street.

===Claverdon Park===
Claverdon Park is a private estate consisting of 82 large detached houses and bungalows. It is accessible only through the Little Aston Park&#x27;s private road and gate network. Whilst often confused as being part of the Little Aston Park, it is in fact a separate entity managed by Claverdon Park Management Company Limited. Claverdon Park is not subject to the same high standards of development and woodland setting as its neighbouring Little Aston Park is, and is not part of Lichfield Council&#x27;s designated Little Aston Park Conservation Area.

Roads within Claverdon Park are: Claverdon Drive, Stonehouse Drive, Roman Lane, Roman Park, Barns Croft and Alderhithe Grove.

===Rosemary Hill Road===
Rosemary Hill Road is a public road with many private gated driveways leading off the highway and gated houses alongside, particularly on the more exclusive Lichfield District side which borders the Little Aston Park. The west side of road is part of Little Aston (Lichfield) and the east side is in Four Oaks (Birmingham).

===Little Aston Lane===
At the heart of the village is Little Aston Lane (A4026). Running opposite expanses of fields and the grounds of Aston Wood golf course, the lane consists of around 50 large, detached houses. A recently constructed, landscaped recreation area also runs parallel to the lane, managed by the Little Aston Recreational Ground Association.

In addition to the lane&#x27;s own housing, it also contains the entrance to &quot;The Grove&quot;. A cul-de-sac within Little Aston Lane, The Grove contains 51 large, detached homes, similar to those on the lane itself.

The Little Aston Village Hall, is also on the lane, providing services and facilities to the small community. A crown green bowling club and a tennis club are on the Hall site.

Many residents have complained to the local MP and county council regarding excessive use of the village roads by HGV tippers and artics, exposing young children walking to school to great risk. There is a bizarre situation where there is a 7.5-tonne weight limit in one direction of the road, but not in the other, and Staffordshire County Council&#x27;s explanation that imposing the limit in both directions would burden the neighbouring Birmingham Council&#x27;s road network with excessive traffic.

===Forge Lane===

Running out of the Little Aston Park and into the surrounding countryside is Forge Lane. It is lined by around 40 detached and semi-detached houses, situated on both sides of the road. The village&#x27;s Little Aston Primary School is located on the lane. Forge lane also contains the entrance to Little Aston&#x27;s recreation site, a large area of landscaped grassland, popular for dog walking and sports activities. In addition to this, the entrance to Little Aston&#x27;s vicarage is also in the lane, which has been the home of many of the village&#x27;s vicars.

Forge Lane is a continuation of Roman Road which is directly opposite across Little Aston Road. Roman Road is the old Roman, Ryknild Street part of which can be seen within the confines of Sutton Park which is at the opposite end of Roman Road from Little Aston Village by Rosemary Hill Road. The lane derives its name from the forge mill and adjacent cottages which stood over bourne / footherley brook which can be found further down the lane from the village. The mill and cottages were built around the mid-1600s by Thomas Foley whose name was used for the Foley Public House in Streetly. The mill was initially a hammer mill for iron smelting and ingot production, as the surrounding area has deposits of iron stone which were used in the mill. The mill use was changed sometime in the early 1800s to become a flour mill up until it was destroyed by fire in 1903. The mill cottages remain to this day and are residential homes, with the oak beams used in its construction still in place in the ground floor rooms and upper floor ceilings.

The mill pond that lay in front of the cottages which feed the mill wheel is no longer there having been filled in sometime after the first world war, but its outline can be seen within the adjacent Footherley Wood and the small piece of open land beside the bridge over the brook. It has been said but not proved that the fields to the side of the cottages were used by Oliver Cromwell as a camp site on his way north to Chester during the Civil War. The Chester Road being not more than a half a mill from the cottages.

The present day Little Aston Primary school which stands on the lane is not more than 100 yards from the former school which are now residential homes but if you inspect the buildings you will see the school boys and girls entrances detailed in the brick work of the buildings. These buildings stand opposite the blacksmiths old forge which is at the top of the lane close to Little Aston Road. The Blacksmiths forge is sometimes thought to have been why the lane was called Forge Lane, this is not correct as it was the forge mill further down the lane that gave rise to the lanes name. The blacksmiths forge was not only a forge but the site of the production and building of horse / farm carts and cart wheels. The blacksmiths forge stopped being used as a forge sometime during the 1950s, but today is back in use as a design studio and bespoke carpentry company.

===Walsall Road===
Running from the junction with Rosemary Hill Road to Forge Lane, Walsall Road (the A454) borders Little Aston Park. There are around 30 large detached houses on the roadside, and private gated communities such as Beechwood Croft and Woodside Drive where there are multimillion-pound homes.

===Aldridge Road===

Continuing on from Walsall Road, Aldridge Road (also the A454) begins on the junction of Forge Lane and Roman Road. Aldridge Road becomes Little Aston Road at the point it crosses Footherley Brook approximately 100 yards before the junction with the A452 Chester Road. It is lined by around 170 houses both detached and semi detached. At the junction with the Chester Road is the former Evans Halshaw Porsche dealership, once a petroleum filling station which later became a Bentley dealership, then a Ferrari and Maserati dealership, and a classic car dealership. Currently the showroom is a Mercedes used car specialist.

The majority of Aldridge Road borders the northerly side of the Little Aston Golf Club, although it is hidden by trees. A stream called Footherley Brook runs alongside holes 12 and 13 of the golf course and underneath a small bridge on Aldridge Road. The bridge was damaged by flash flooding in the mid-1980s, causing the closure of Aldridge Road for many months. The stream then runs through a 2-acre private wood to the rear of a section of properties on Aldridge Road which is owned and maintained by one Aldridge Road resident and into the mill pond.

The area between the Footherley Brook and Chester Road, including Fotherley Brook Road and part of Little Aston Road, was moved from Aldridge (West Midlands) to Little Aston (Staffordshire) in 1994 by The Hereford and Worcester, Staffordshire and West Midlands (County and Metropolitan Borough Boundaries) Order 1993.

===Little Aston Hall Estate===
This small area of residence is situated within what used to be the grounds of Little Aston Hall. Seven blocks of superior apartments were constructed on the site during the mid-1980s, each containing six luxury living spaces. The complex is set back from the road on a private gated drive and situated in many acres of grassland and landscaped gardens.

===Lady Aston Park===
Lady Aston Park is a recent development of around 50 gated luxury apartments, aimed exclusively at the over 55s. The community borders the Little Aston Hall development, and is alongside the Bupa care home and private hospital. The estate is managed by the Lady Aston Park Management Co. Ltd which is in the ownership of the apartment owners. Day-to-day management is in the hands of an elected committee of residents.

== Administration ==

=== Electoral ward ===
Little Aston is an electoral ward of Lichfield District Council, although it is separated from the city by open country. It is in the Tamworth constituency for the UK Parliament. Its MP was Conservative Christopher Pincher from 2010 until he resigned in September 2023. At both the 2023 by-election and the 2024 general election the seat was won by Labour&#x27;s Sarah Edwards.

=== Parish ===

Little Aston is a part of the civil parish of Shenstone. It became a separate ecclesiastical parish in 1874 when St Peter&#x27;s Church was built at the expense of, and on land donated by, Edward Swynfen Parker Jervis (1815-1896), son of Edward Jervis Jervis, 2nd Viscount St Vincent. The new church was designed by architect George Edmund Street.

== Recreation and education ==
Little Aston has two golf clubs: the championship Little Aston Golf Club and the new Aston Wood Golf Club. A private Spire hospital is located on the former Little Aston Hall&#x27;s estate and Little Aston also features a residential estate, Little Aston Park. Little Aston also has its own primary school, Little Aston Primary School, and next door is the Little Aston Recreation Ground. Located at the village hall is the tennis club and bowling green.

== Commerce and transport ==

Within the boundaries of Little Aston, there is only one independent newsagent, one gourmet butcher and one drink store, all located on Little Aston Lane. However, a wider ranges of local mini-supermarkets, hairdressers, fish and chips shops, restaurants and pubs are available in neighbouring Burnett Road Streetly and The Crown Four Oaks all half a mile (800 m) away, plus a wide range of trendy restaurants and major supermarkets in Mere Green a mile (1.6 km) away. A comprehensive high street is in Sutton Coldfield town centre.

Nearby junctions with the A38, M5, M6, M6 Toll and M42 give easy access to the north-east, north-west, south-west and south-east towards London. High speed trains towards Manchester and London are available from Lichfield and Birmingham, with connections available from Blake Street. National Express West Midlands service 6 also runs through Little Aston every 30 minutes between Walsall and Sutton Coldfield via Aldridge and Mere Green.

=== Air incidents ===

On 16 April 1966, a Cessna light aircraft crashed into the rear of number 21 Fotherley Brook Road, Little Aston, killing both the pilot and the passenger. The occupants of the house were unharmed.

During a school fete organised by the Sutton Coldfield Town Middle School Parent-Teacher Association, which was held in fields at Little Hardwick Road, Little Aston on 7 July 1973, a parachutist, 21-year-old RAF Sergeant Kenneth Cornwell, who was part of a five-man display team, became tangled in 275,000-volt overhead power lines. Attempts by the local fire brigade to reach him proved fruitless, as their turntable ladder was too short. A British Army Air Corps&#x27; Westland Sioux AH.1 helicopter, registration XT238, of the 16th/5th Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers was diverted from an appearance at another fete, at nearby St. Augustine&#x27;s Church, Rugeley. It lowered a harness to Cornwell, but the helicopter was caught by wind and the rescue line wrapped around its tail rotor, severing the line. Cornwell dropped 40 feet to the ground, narrowly missing a tarpaulin that was being held for him to land on. The helicopter crash landed in a nearby field and burst into flames, but the two-man crew evacuated without serious injury. Cornwell—who by that time had been suspended for an hour and a half—survived with a broken wrist, broken pelvis, and both elbows broken and dislocated and was taken to Good Hope General Hospital, Sutton Coldfield.

A spokesman for the Central Electricity Generating Board, who operated the power lines, criticised the parachute display for its &quot;danger of interference to the overhead transmission lines and to those taking part&quot; and said they would have opposed it had they been consulted. It transpired that Cornwell was instructed to make jump with a type of parachute that he had not used previously. His instructor, Sergeant B. Anderson, was reprimanded by the Safety and Training Committee of the British Parachute Association and had his advanced and approved instructor ratings suspended. The helicopter was subsequently written off.

<text>Hermann Joseph Otto Hubert August Constantin Hupp (May 21, 1859 – January 31, 1949) was a German graphical artist. His main working area was heraldry, yet he also worked as a typeface designer, creating commercial symbols and metal works.

==Life and career==
Hupp was born in Düsseldorf, Kingdom of Prussia, the fourth of five sons of the engraver Carl Heinrich Hupp. His father made him learn engraving as his profession, and, shortly after finishing his education, he moved to Munich in 1878. From 1891 till his death, Hupp lived in the suburb Oberschleißheim. From the painter Rudolf von Seitz he learned many styles of painting, and when he met the architect Gabriel von Seidl he received several contracts to paint wall and ceiling frescos.

Hupp&#x27;s main field of work was heraldry, painting more than 6,000 coats of arms and writing books on heraldry. His &quot;Wappen und Siegel der deutschen Städte, Flecken und Dörfer&quot; (&quot;Coats of Arms and Seals of German Cities, Places and Villages&quot; book series was started in 1895, but of the originally ten planned volumes only five were finished. 3,300 of his paintings of coats of arms were published as a collecting set from the coffee company &quot;Kaffee HAG&quot; from 1913–18 and 1926–38. This publication helped to make heraldry better known to the general public. Another important heraldic publication by Hupp were the &quot;Münchener Kalender&quot; (Munich calendar), of which 51 issues were published between 1885 and 1936 (the issue of 1933 was omitted). Besides painting existing coats of arms, he also created many designs for municipalities which were applying for new arms. Possibly his most important coat of arms was the 1923 version for the state of Bavaria, which, however, was replaced with a new version after World War II.

The first typographic works of Hupp were made in 1883. His first typeface, &quot;Neudeutsch&quot;, was published in 1899 by Genzsch &amp; Heyse. He created several further typeface later, such as &quot;Hupp-Gotisch&quot;, &quot;Hupp-Fraktur&quot;, and &quot;Hupp-Antiqua&quot;. However, as his typefaces were not designed for standard uses, they did not spread much, and are nowadays mostly forgotten. None of them were ever converted for use in phototypesetting, though some have been made available as digital fonts.

Other significant works of Hupp include metal works for Speyer Cathedral in 1904 (which also gained him the title professor in 1906), the cover of an astronomical clock donated to the city of Munich, beer steins, and the company logo of the Spaten brewery.

Though Hupp was undoubtedly an artist, he himself did not claim to be one, preferring to say that he was simply using the technique of an artist, but failing to have the creativity of one.

==The &quot;Constance Missal&quot;==
As reference material for his work as a type designer, Hupp collected early books and incunabula (books printed prior to 1501). Around 1880 he purchased a copy of an incunable which came to be known as the &quot;Constance Missal&quot; or &quot;Missale Speciale&quot; (five complete or partial copies are known). About 1895 he made a study of the volume and concluded that it had qualities in typography and production which suggested it was earlier than the Gutenberg Bible. Though he sold his copy, after several decades the argument took hold and by 1940 the Missal was recognized as predating Gutenberg&#x27;s famous work. In 1954, a copy was sold to the Morgan Library for US$100,000. However, by the early 1960s further research by Allan H. Stevenson using watermark analysis demonstrated it was actually printed 20 years later than Gutenberg&#x27;s work (in the fall of 1473).

<text>The men&#x27;s 4 × 100 meter medley relay took place on 20–21 August at the Olympic Aquatic Centre of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Athens, Greece.

The U.S. team added two new world records to the books in the final men&#x27;s event of the Olympic swimming program. Aaron Peirsol, Brendan Hansen, Ian Crocker, and Jason Lezak lowered their time set at the 2003 FINA World Championships in Barcelona, Spain, stopping the clock in 3:30.68. At the opening of the race, Peirsol led off a backstroke leg with a new world record of 53.45, beating a 0.15-second mark set by Lenny Krayzelburg (53.60) from the Pan Pacific Championships in 1999.

Meanwhile, the Germans earned a silver medal in a European record of 3:33.62, 11-hundredths of a second under the old Olympic record set by Team USA in 2000. Japan finished third in 3:35.22 to hold off the strong Russian team anchored by double Olympic champion Alexander Popov, who made up more than 1.5 seconds, but fell short of a medal in his last Olympic final.

<doc id="914750" wikidata="Q730565" url="?curid=914750" title="Streetly">
<text>Streetly is an area in the county of West Midlands, England which lies around to the north of Birmingham City Centre. It is uniquely located within the borders of Birmingham, Lichfield and Walsall district authorities, and is part of the West Midlands conurbation. It is adjacent to, New Oscott, Great Barr, Four Oaks, Little Aston and Aldridge.

Streetly is a semi-rural district, lying close to many farms and is separated from Walsall by open fields and the North Birmingham green belt. The local area includes Sutton Park of which Streetly has its own dedicated gate. Streetly is part of the Birmingham Metropolitan Area and the Birmingham Urban Area.

Bus services provide links to Birmingham, Walsall and Sutton Coldfield. Most are operated by National Express West Midlands.

The area was served by trains on the Sutton Park Line. However while the line remains open for freight, Streetly railway station closed in 1965 and the nearest station now is in Four Oaks railway station on the opposite side of Sutton Park.

==History==
Streetly is named after Icknield Street, a Roman road, of which parts can still be found in Sutton Park. Streetly was a rural area of Staffordshire until the 1950s when the character of the area became suburban due to the mass construction of modern housing in response to the urbanisation of Birmingham. Streetly was in Aldridge-Brownhills Urban District until the creation of the metropolitan West Midlands county in 1974.

The history of Streetly in the 20th century is regularly discussed in a local history Facebook page and the Birmingham History Forum. These resources include links to further online information including the personal recollections of previous residents.

==Education==
There is one 11–18 secondary school in Streetly, and four primary schools for children aged up to 11 years:

* The Streetly Academy
* Lindens Primary School
* Manor Primary School
* St. Annes Roman Catholic Primary School
* Blackwood Primary School

From September 1972, Streetly and other areas of the then Aldridge-Brownhills Urban District operated a system of 5-9 first, 9-13 middle and 13-18 secondary schools. However, from September 1986 the area reverted to the conventional system of 5-11 primary schools and 11-18 secondary schools following a decision by Walsall Metropolitan Borough Council to bring the former Aldridge-Brownhills Urban District area schools into line with the rest of the borough.

Since September 1992, pupils transferring from primary schools in Streetly have had the option of transferring to secondary schools in neighbouring Sutton Coldfield (since 1974 part of Birmingham) following that area&#x27;s reduction in the secondary school age from 12 to 11.

==Politics==

<doc id="914754" wikidata="Q640902" url="?curid=914754" title="Mr. Bad Guy">
<text>Mr. Bad Guy is the first solo studio album by British musician Freddie Mercury, lead singer of Queen. Released in 1985, during a period in which Queen were on hiatus from recording, it contains eleven songs, all written by Mercury himself.

The album was reissued on 11 October 2019, in newly remixed form, on CD, vinyl, digital and streaming services, via Mercury Records.

==Background==
In contrast to Queen&#x27;s typically rock-oriented work, Mercury and co-producer Reinhold Mack drew on disco, dance music and pop influences for &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot;, all of which had surfaced on Queen&#x27;s previous studio album, &quot;Hot Space&quot; (1982), also produced by Mack. Mercury stated, &quot;I had a lot of ideas bursting to get out and there were a lot of musical territories I wanted to explore which I really couldn&#x27;t do within Queen.&quot; Co-producer Mack added, &quot;he used to get pretty annoyed working with the others, because there was always Brian saying, &#x27;It needs to be more rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&#x27;&quot; &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot; took nearly two years to record, as Mercury had to gather enough material together while committing to band activities.

Initially, the album was supposed to feature duets with Mercury and Michael Jackson.

However, other sources state that personal conflicts were to blame for unfinished tracks. Mercury reportedly dropped out of any further collaboration after feeling uncomfortable working with Jackson&#x27;s pet llama in the studio. One track from these collaborative sessions, &quot;There Must Be More to Life Than This&quot;, was reworked for the &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot; album, although the original recording featuring Jackson was eventually released on &quot;Queen Forever&quot; in 2014.

===Production===
Recording was taxing on Mercury, as he took part in everything from performing the tracks (including vocals, piano and synthesizer), arranging the orchestration and working with the sound engineers. Mercury&#x27;s use of synthesizers and orchestration in track development added to the diversity of each piece. 
The album&#x27;s original title was &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;, but Mercury changed his mind weeks before the album went to press.
Originally released on Columbia/CBS, copyrights for &quot;Mercury Songs&quot;, a company owned by Freddie Mercury&#x27;s estate, had been revoked following his death in 1991. &quot;Mr. Bad Guy&quot; would remain out of print on CD until 2000, when it was included on The Solo Collection, and in 2019, when it was reissued and remixed due to the commercial success of &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, a biographical film about him.

==Singles==
Lead single &quot;I Was Born to Love You&quot; with the non-album B-side &quot;Stop All the Fighting&quot; debuted at number 50 on 14 April 1985, peaking at number 11 on 5 May 1985. It also reached number four in South Africa and number 20 on 1 June in Austria. &quot;Made in Heaven&quot; peaked at number 57 on the UK Singles Chart on 21 July 1985 and charted for four weeks. &quot;Living on My Own&quot; charted at number 50 in the United Kingdom, while the fourth and final single, &quot;Love Me Like There&#x27;s No Tomorrow,&quot; debuted and peaked at number 76 on the UK chart on 24 November 1985.

===Re-worked singles===
&quot;Living on My Own&quot; was re-released in 1993 (almost two years after Mercury&#x27;s death) in a remixed form by No More Brothers. The single reached number one in the UK, becoming his most successful solo single release, albeit posthumously. &quot;I Was Born to Love You&quot; became Mercury&#x27;s only solo chart success in Australia, reaching number 13. That song, and &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;, were later reworked by the three surviving Queen members and included on the 1995 studio album &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;.

<text>Joseph Hume FRS (22 January 1777 – 20 February 1855) was a Scottish surgeon and Radical MP.

==Early life==
He was born the son of a shipmaster James Hume in Montrose, Angus, who died shortly after he was born. He attended Montrose Academy, where he knew the older James Mill; and from 1790 was apprenticed to a local surgeon-apothecary, John Bale.

==Medical career==
Hume studied medicine at the University of Aberdeen and then the University of Edinburgh. He had as patron David Scott MP. Before he qualified, he saw wartime service as surgeon-mate on the hoy HMS &quot;Hawke&quot;; and then was on the East Indiaman &quot;Hope&quot; for 18 months.

In 1799 Hume sailed to India, nominated to the Bengal service by Jacob Bosanquet of the British East India Company. He worked his passage as medical officer on the &quot;Houghton&quot;. Once there, he was commissioned as a surgeon to the 7th Sepoy Regiment. Gaining fluency in Hindustani and Persian, he worked also as an interpreter and on commissariat.

On the eve of the Second Anglo-Maratha War, Hume came to the attention of Lord Lake with a method to recover damp gunpowder. On the outbreak of war, he was with General Peregrine Powell who marched from Allahabad into Bundelkhand. He took on again a variety of roles during the campaign.

==Return to the United Kingdom==
In 1808, Hume resigned from the army and returned to the United Kingdom with a fortune of about £40,000. Between 1808 and 1811, he travelled around England and Europe.

In 1818 Hume was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society, being, according to his nomination, &quot;well versed in various branches of Useful knowledge and particularly in Chemistry, in various branches of oriental literature and Antiquities&quot;.

==Political career==
===Weymouth===
In 1812, Hume obtained through Spencer Perceval a seat in Parliament for Weymouth, Dorset, England, vacant by the death of Sir John Johnstone, 6th Baronet. He was allowed it by Masterton Ure, was elected unopposed and voted as a Tory supporter of the Perceval administration. The parliament was dissolved for the 1812 United Kingdom general election. Ure refused to support Hume further, in fact being overruled by the Duke of Cumberland and Viscount Newark. Hume stood nonetheless in the four-member constituency, and received just two votes. He had toed the line in some matters, but on the expulsion of Benjamin Walsh and the Luddite legislation he had shown independence unacceptable to the Duke. Hume kicked up a fuss and took legal action, and was paid off with £1,000, supposedly to cover election expenses.

This brief Tory period did bring Hume an association with the Duke of Kent and Strathearn, a patron of Joseph Lancaster. John Cam Hobhouse relayed an anecdote told by John Conroy of the Duke&#x27;s household, in which Hume advised the Duke to limit the Duchess to one horse-chaise. In 1833, Hume provided Alexander Burnes with an introduction to his daughter Princess Victoria.

===Hiatus and route to radicalism===
In connection with the financial troubles of Joseph Lancaster, Hume met Francis Place in 1813, through Joseph Fox. It was Place who brought Hume into the group of political radicals with whom he from then on was associated.

Hume renewed his friendship with James Mill: they both and Place were interested in the school project of a West London Lancasterian Association floated in 1813. The project took a turn for the worse in 1814, when Francis Burdett intervened and imposed on it his associate Thomas Evans and Arthur Thistlewood, pushing out Place who then abandoned politics for four years. By the next decade Hume was identified with the group of followers of Mill and Jeremy Bentham known as the Philosophical Radicals, with organ the &quot;Westminster Review&quot;.

At this period Hume also aimed to become a director of the East India Company, a position he described in an 1813 speech as an &quot;arduous and most respectable office&quot;. He lobbied the company&#x27;s shareholders, and in so doing met Maria Burnley, whom he married in 1815.

===Aberdeen Burghs===
When Hume was returned to Parliament once more in 1818, as member for the Aberdeen Burghs, Borders, Scotland, it was with the support of William Maule. He stood there on a radical platform of his own devising.

In 1823 Hume contested the election of James Duff, 4th Earl Fife as rector of Marischal College in Aberdeen; in 1824 and 1825 he himself was elected. He revived the long-disused rectorial court in 1825, but offended the electorate of students by the use he made of it. He lost out in 1826 and 1827 to James McGrigor, but was re-elected in 1828. There was a Royal Commission on the Scottish universities in 1826, and Hume claimed he had prompted it.

In Aberdeen&#x27;s local politics, Hume was at odds with a largely Tory town council, but had supporters including Alexander Bannerman. His chances there dropped when he failed to support a road bill before parliament. Faced in 1829 with a serious challenge from Sir James Carnegie, 5th Baronet, with a Brechin base, Hume decided to change seat.
===Later seats===
In March 1830, with Henry Hunt and Daniel O&#x27;Connell, Hume set up the London-based Metropolitan Political Union, with a platform that included manhood suffrage and the secret ballot. He was elected that year for Middlesex, England. He produced a County Rates Bill, and aimed to re-organise local government. He came under attack, however, by 1837, as a moderate &quot;Whig-Radical&quot; too close to the Melbourne ministry.

Hume later represented Kilkenny, Ireland (1837); and then, from 1842, for the rest of his life Montrose Burghs.

==Hume as politician==
Hume was a relentless, individualistic campaigner over a wide range of causes. Élie Halévy (English translation) characterised him in terms of &quot;pigheadedness&quot;, with a &quot;heavy mind&quot;; and he was always a &quot;dull yet dogged orator&quot;.

During much of the Liverpool ministry, Hume could be called &quot;the leader of the parliamentary Radicals&quot;, with emphasis on public finance. Initially his group could be called (by Viscount Castlereagh) &quot;Creevey, Hume ... and two or three others&quot; who sifted through details; it was nicknamed &quot;The Mountain&quot;, from the Montagnards in France of the 1790s. Joseph Nightingale credited Hume&#x27;s attritional tactics with the resignations of Lord Ellenborough and Nicholas Vansittart.

A close ally, in parliament from 1826, was Henry Warburton. The retrenchment issue gained Hume praise from William Cobbett, and his criticism of the ultra-Protestant line on Ireland also drew support. Opposing the Canning administration in 1827, however, Henry Brougham wrote to Sir Robert Wilson that the Whigs &quot;shall have no connection with Hume &amp; Co. and the Benthamites&quot;, while expecting their votes 90% of the time.

Hume often annoyed colleagues on the same side of the argument. He only with difficulty gained the trust of Francis Place, who took many years to come round to James Mill&#x27;s view of his character. His attitude affected coalition-building. Alexander Somerville wrote about the formation in 1830 of the Grey ministry:

We one and all thought it wrong that Joseph Hume should not be a member of the new government. We were ignorant of party connections and differences,—ignorant of the atomic nature of some politicians, of the gregarious nature of others.

Around 1831, &quot;Hume, Warburton and others&quot; formed a recognisable group, still known as &quot;The Mountain&quot;. After the Reform Act 1832, there were new radical MPs, but parliamentary voting support for the radicals reached a peak of 40, apart from specific issues on further electoral reform. Hume had become an &quot;old parliamentary radical&quot;, Cobbett a &quot;national radical&quot;. At the period of the 1835 Lichfield House Compact, Hume&#x27;s plan to unite the parliamentary radicals with Daniel O&#x27;Connell&#x27;s followers proved divisive. In 1836–7 he was behind the &quot;Constitutional&quot; newspaper, aiming to appeal to militant radicals.

Hume was an early supporter of the London Working Men&#x27;s Association.

==Hume&#x27;s campaigns==
===Public finances===

Hume made a habit of challenging and bringing to a vote every item of public expenditure. In 1820, he secured the appointment of a committee to report on the expense of collecting tax revenue. He helped to abolish the sinking fund. It was he who caused the word &quot;retrenchment&quot; to be added to the Radical programme &quot;peace and reform.&quot; The groat coin or four pence was re-introduced in 1836 during the reign of William IV at the suggestion of Hume. Popularly known as the &#x27;joey&#x27;, named after Hume&#x27;s Christian name, it was introduced to ease transactions on the London buses, the fare being four pence or one groat. As the last groats were struck in 1888 the nickname became passed over to the silver threepences struck after that date until 1941 (the last year of production for British use).

===Labour organisation===
The Combination Act 1799 and its sequel Combination Act 1800 were repealed by the Combination of Workmen Act 1824, promoted by Hume and other radicals, in line with Benthamite principles on industrial harmony. Hume had packed a parliamentary committee on the issue, to support his artisan associate Francis Place. There was an immediate surge in disputes. The Combinations of Workmen Act 1825 backed by William Huskisson then removed the legal right to strike, which remained the situation until the 1870s.

Hume brought about the repeal of the laws prohibiting the export of machinery, and of the act preventing workmen from going abroad.

===Military===
Hume protested against the use of flogging in the army, giving evidence to a parliamentary committee in 1835 based on his time as army surgeon in India. He thought the inducement of a proportion of army commissions should be reserved for soldiers drawn from the ranks, an idea strongly opposed by the Duke of Wellington on social grounds.

He also campaigned against the impressment of sailors, and imprisonment for debt.

==Burnley Hall and death==

Hume in 1824 bought the Somerton estate in Norfolk, north of Great Yarmouth, from the heirs of Sir Philip Stephens, 1st Baronet, and named the house there Burnley Hall from his wife&#x27;s name before marriage. It became his seat. He died there in 1855 and is buried to the north-east of the main chapel in Kensal Green Cemetery in London next to his good friend William Williams.

Charles having adopted his mother&#x27;s surname during the 1860s, she is often known as Maria Burnley Bathoe. She contributed 5,000 quotations to the &quot;New English Dictionary&quot;.
* Eleanor, third daughter, married John Stratford Rodney, son of John Rodney, as his second wife.
* Charlotte Isabella married in 1848 her first cousin George Balfour, whose mother Susan was sister to Joseph Hume.

==Legacy==

A memorial of Hume was published by his son Joseph Hume (London, 1855). A subscription fund established a Joseph Hume Scholarship, in jurisprudence and political economy, at University College London. it is still awarded. Hume bequeahed his working library of approximately 5000 pamphlets to University College London in 1855.

According to the &quot;History of the Silver Coinage of England&quot; by Edward Hawkins, a groat was known as a &quot;Joey&quot;. It was &quot;so called from Joseph Hume, M.P., who strongly recommended the coinage for the sake of paying short cab-fares, etc.&quot;

In 1837 Hume initiated a plan for a memorial to the Scottish Political Martyrs, victims of the Pitt administration&#x27;s policy of the 1790s. It was supported by Peter Mackenzie, a radical journalist in Glasgow. He had already set up a memorial for John Baird and Andrew Hardie, two weavers executed in the 1820 Radical War. On 21 August 1844, 3000 gathered to see Hume lay the monument&#x27;s foundation stone at the Old Calton Cemetery, Edinburgh.

In February 1852, a second monument to the Scottish Political Martyrs, again initiated by Hume, was unveiled at Nunhead Cemetery, London.

==History==

The history of Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán is divided into five phases (or generations); the first generation from 1897 to 1930, the second from 1931 to 1949, the third from 1950 to 1993, the fourth from 1994 to 2002 and the fifth since 2003 to date.

===1st generation (1897–1930)===
The Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán was born in a small city called Tecalitlán, to the south of Jalisco. Founded in 1897 by Don Gaspar Vargas the formation during those years was provided by the guitarra de golpe (or ) played precisely by Don Gaspar, the wooden harp by Manuel Mendoza, and two violins played by Lino Quintero and Refugio Hernandez. The combination of these instruments established the &quot;Sonido Tecalitlán&quot; which distinguished from the &quot;Sonido Cocula&quot;. (The Mariachi from Cocula utilized the guitarron and the vihuela in place of the harp and the guitarra de golpe aside from the two violins). In 1913, Don Gaspar introduced one trumpet to the group but it was not well accepted and, in later performances, its high-pitched sound was considered annoying. The cornet was replaced by another violin. The group consisted then of five elements. The son of Don Gaspar Vargas, Silvestre Vargas, joined as a violinist in 1921. From 1926 the group consisted of Gaspar Vargas - Guitarra de golpe, Manuel Mendoza - Harp, Silvestre Vargas, Trinidad Olivera and Nicolas Torres - Violins.

===2nd generation (1931–1949)===

In 1931 Gaspar Vargas turned the leadership of Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán over to his son, Silvestre. As the first step in his reorganization Silvestre decided to enlarge the group to eight musicians. He invited his compatriots, the Quintero brothers, Rafael and Jeronimo to join. One played a violin and the other a guitar. Later he would add another violin played by Santiago Torres. He moved Trinidad Olivera from the violin to the guitarron, although still preserving the wooden harp. It was Silvestre who possessed a dream that his group would one day be the greatest mariachi in all Mexico and he was relentless in his pursuit of fulfilling that dream. The Mariachi Vargas was something of an oddity in the early 1930s; the members were all dressed in charro suits, they showed up on time for performances, and they were sober.

====Mexico City====
In 1933 they won first place in a Mariachi contest celebrated in Guadalajara. Then again, in Mexico City, in 1934, they were awarded another first place prize. President Lázaro Cárdenas, who enjoyed the music of &quot;Vargas&quot;, subsequently had the group hired as the official mariachi of the Mexico City Police Department and the group moved to Mexico City where they remained for 20 years. They provided music and entertainment for the capital city at its parks and gardens. Beginning in 1937, the Mariachi Vargas appeared in &quot;Asi es mi Tierra&quot;, the first of its more than 200 motion pictures. They played in many of Pedro Infante&#x27;s movies as well. In that same year they recorded their first record and signed an exclusive contract with RCA.

====Addition of the trumpet and violin====
In 1941, the group definitively integrated the trumpet into their musical interpretations. Miguel Martínez Domínguez was the first trumpet player for Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán; he is considered the creator of the mariachi-style trumpet as well as its best performer, teacher, and exemplar. In 1944, Rubén Fuentes, a classical violinist with no background in mariachi music, was asked by Silvestre to join the group. Fuentes joined as a violinist and took over as music arranger. Silvestre Vargas and Ruben Fuentes reorganized Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán and changed the group&#x27;s sound. To overcome the unsavory connotations that the term &quot;mariachis&quot; had for the public in those days, the two leaders also updated the group&#x27;s image by demanding professional presentation.

===3rd generation (1950–1993)===
====Unifying the sound====
Fuentes took complete responsibility for the group&#x27;s musical direction, and enriched the evolution that for many years had conserved the primitive and unstudied qualities of mariachi. The changing sound of the Mariachi Vargas de Tecalitlán was redirected without the abandonment of its roots or traditions. The Huapangos and Sones (which were two very distinctive styles of the mariachi music) were being interpreted in many diverse and different ways. The Mariachi Vargas recorded the Sones with arrangements and adaptations as patterns for other groups. This stratagem promoted the concept that all mariachi groups could be unified to those versions by taking them as examples. The traditional songs and the original sound of the mariachi began to mature in the 1950s. It was during the recordings of the &quot;Golden Age of the Huapangos&quot; that the compositions, arrangements and musical direction of Rubén Fuentes, and the unequaled voice of Miguel Aceves Mejía, initiated a musical shift that would change the sound and instrumentation of the mariachi.
Due to the fact they change mariachi from the start they choose to keep it in away that it would still be traditional.

====Revolutionary new harmony ====
In 1955 Rubén Fuentes stopped performing in the group. However, to date he maintains his position as producer, musical arranger and musical director, assisted during this first age by Jesús Rodríguez de Hijar and, under both, the administrative and leadership skills of Silvestre Vargas. In 1966 Rubén Fuentes wrote &quot;La Bikina&quot;, a song that was recognized as the epitome of this Revolutionary New Harmony and sound of the mariachi. He continues to write and produce music for Mariachi Vargas that takes is an emotional roller coaster from the height of happiness to the despair of a broken heart or a lost love. As much in Mexico as in foreign countries the Sones and Huapangos acquire new directions.

====Mariachi conferences====
In the 1970s interest in mariachi music was waning. But all that changed when San Antonio, Texas held its first international mariachi conference in September 1979. In 1975, Jose &quot;Pepe&quot; Martinez, Sr. became the musical director of Mariachi Vargas. He wrote many arrangements including &quot;Violin Huapango&quot; which individually showcase the different instruments and members in the group.
In 1983, the Mariachi Vargas appeared for the first time at the Tucson International Mariachi Conference. A new movement began to grow and many other conferences began to develop. The Mariachi Vargas was often chosen as the headline performer.

====Linda Ronstadt====
In 1986, Linda Ronstadt appeared with the Mariachi Vargas at the Tucson International Mariachi Conference where she sang publicly in Spanish for the first time. In 1987 she released her &quot;Canciones de mi Padre&quot; album featuring Mariachi Vargas which won her a Grammy award for the album. She also went on a national tour with the group, giving greater international exposure to mariachi music than ever before and creating a new audience for mariachi music among non-Hispanics.

====Classical mariachi====
In 1989, the Mariachi Vargas released their &quot;En Concierto&quot; CD featuring some of the greatest renderings of classical music ever played by a mariachi group. They also accompanied Lucero in the 1990s as she rose in the ranks of contemporary musical stardom.
