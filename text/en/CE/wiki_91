<text>The Wicked Witch of the West, a fictional character in the classic children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; (1900) by the American author L. Frank Baum, is the evil ruler of the Winkie Country, the western region in the Land of Oz. She is inadvertently killed by the child Dorothy Gale. In Baum&#x27;s subsequent &quot;Oz&quot; novels, the Wicked Witch of the West is referred to occasionally.

Margaret Hamilton played the role of the witch in the classic 1939 film based on Baum&#x27;s novel. Hamilton&#x27;s characterization introduced green skin, a feature repeated in later literary and dramatic representations, including Gregory Maguire&#x27;s revisionist &quot;Oz&quot; novel &quot;Wicked&quot; (1995), the novel&#x27;s 2003 stage musical adaptation and the two-part film adaptation of the stage musical, the 2013 film &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;, and the television series &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;.

==In Baum&#x27;s books==
The Wicked Witch of the West is the malevolent ruler of the Winkie Country. Her castle is described as beautiful instead of being the sinister fortress shown in the 1939 film. In all versions, she is aquaphobic. The Wicked Witch of the West was not related to the Wicked Witch of the East, but leagued together with her, the Wicked Witch of the South, and the Wicked Witch of the North to conquer the Land of Oz and divide it amongst themselves, as recounted in L. Frank Baum&#x27;s &quot;Dorothy and the Wizard in Oz&quot;. She shows no interest in the death of the Eastern Witch and all she cares about is obtaining the Silver Shoes which will increase her power. W. W. Denslow&#x27;s illustrations for &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; depict her as a paunched old hag with three pigtails and an eyepatch. Baum himself specified that she only had one eye, but that it &quot;was as powerful as a telescope&quot;, enabling the witch to see what was happening in her kingdom from her castle windows. Other illustrators, such as Paul Granger, placed her eye in the center of her forehead, as a cyclops. Usually, she is shown wearing an eyepatch; however, some illustrations show her with two eyes.

Most of her power resides in the creatures she controls. She has a pack of 40 great wolves, a flock of 40 crows, a swarm of black bees, and an army of Winkies. She possesses the enchanted Golden Cap, which compels the winged monkeys to obey her on three occasions. First, the witch commanded the creatures to help her enslave the Winkies and to seize control of the western part of the Land of Oz. Second, she made the winged monkeys drive the Wizard of Oz&#x27;s army out of the Winkie Country, when he attempted to overthrow her.

When Dorothy Gale and her companions Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and Cowardly Lion were sent by the Wizard to destroy her, the Witch attacked them with her various creatures. Each of these attempts was thwarted with the Tin Woodman killing the 40 great wolves, Scarecrow killing the 40 crows, the black bees dying upon trying to sting the Tin Woodman, and the armed Winkie slaves being scared off by the Cowardly Lion. The protagonists are eventually subdued by the Witch&#x27;s third and final permitted use of the winged monkeys. Nevertheless, the old witch cannot kill Dorothy because the girl is protected by the Good Witch of the North&#x27;s kiss. She settles for enslaving Dorothy and tries to force the Cowardly Lion into submission by starving him, though Dorothy sneaks him food. Upon seeing the Silver Shoes on the girl&#x27;s feet, the Wicked Witch decides to steal them, and thereby acquire even more power.

When she succeeds in acquiring one silver shoe by making Dorothy trip over an invisible bar, the little girl angrily throws a bucket of water onto the Wicked Witch. This causes the old witch to melt away. The Wicked Witch&#x27;s dryness was enumerated in some clues before this. Furthermore, when Toto had bitten her, she had not bled; her wickedness had dried her up long ago. L. Frank Baum did not explain precisely why water had this effect on her, nor did he ever imply that all evil witches could be likewise destroyed. However, the wicked witch Mombi is similarly disposed of in &quot;The Lost King of Oz&quot; and the wicked witch Singra is clearly afraid of the same fate in the early chapters of &quot;The Wicked Witch of Oz&quot;.

==Personality and characterization==

In the 1939 film, the Witch is iconic for her green skin, pointed hat, broom, boisterous, dramatic (yet nasty) personality, and cackle; in the books, her personality is somewhat more subtle: she is not as overtly sadistic, she is not as antagonistic to Dorothy and only becomes so once she sees Dorothy has intruded on her land, and her appearance is described very differently. In the novel, she also does not carry a broom, but rather an umbrella, which she uses on one occasion to strike Dorothy&#x27;s dog Toto. Her nature is a volatile and yet somewhat cowardly one when compared to the film version. Despite her immense power, she avoids face-to-face contact with her enemies, and is frightened of Dorothy at first when she sees the girl wearing the Silver Shoes. She is also afraid of the dark in Baum&#x27;s original story for reasons unknown. For that reason, the Witch never tried to steal the Silver Shoes while Dorothy was sleeping. Despite her fear of water and the dark, the Wicked Witch of the West was one of the most powerful witches in all of Oz. In ensuing Oz books, her power is described as having been so great that even Glinda the Good Witch of the South feared her. She was described as being so cruel that the blood in her body dried up and that when she was struck, she did not bleed. In the novel, she also owns slaves to do her bidding, a characterization which is kept in &quot;The Wiz&quot;, in which she is much more dramatic than in the original film and forces her slaves to refer to her as beautiful.

==In other books==
*In Alexander Melentyevich Volkov&#x27;s 1939 novel &quot;The Wizard of the Emerald City&quot;, her given name is Bastinda. March Laumer uses this name for the witch in his novel &quot;Aunt Em and Uncle Henry in Oz&quot;. As in the 1939 movie, she is the sister of the Wicked Witch of the East. Sherwood Smith uses this name for a new Wicked Witch of the West in her 2005 book &quot;The Emerald Wand of Oz&quot;.
*Gregory Maguire&#x27;s 1995 revisionist novel &quot;Wicked&quot; takes the familiar Oz story and inverts it, with the Wicked Witch (given the name Elphaba in homage to L. Frank Baum) as the novel&#x27;s protagonist and Dorothy as a hapless child. The name is retained in the musical &quot;Wicked&quot;.
*In the novel &quot;The Unknown Witches of Oz&quot;, the Wicked Witch of the West is named Old Snarl-Spats.
*In &quot;Dorothy of Oz&quot;, the Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s ghost appeared. When Princess Gaylette&#x27;s Jester gets his hand on the Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s wand, he gets possessed by the Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s ghost. When Dorothy starts to do a trick to fool the Jester that Glinda is in china doll form, the Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s ghost continues to warn the Jester of Dorothy&#x27;s trick. When the Jester gives the Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s wand to Dorothy, the Wicked Witch of the West&#x27;s ghost disappears. It was also mentioned in this story that Wicked Witch of the West once cast a curse on the Gillikin Country town of Purplefield where it was turned into a maze that causes anyone who fails to make it through to disappear. Her curse on Purplefield was undone when Dorothy, Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Cowardly Lion made it through the maze by hearing Tugg&#x27;s foghorn.
*In the comic book series &quot;Grimm Fairy Tales Presents Oz&quot;, the Wicked Witch of the West is named Lynessa.
*In the novel &quot;The Living House of Oz&quot; there is a witch named Mordra who comes from an alternate Oz, but looks identical to the Wicked Witch of the West who lived in the regular Oz.
*In &quot;Cheshire Crossing&quot; after reforming years after being melted by Dorothy, the Wicked Witch of the West, also known as Miss West, confronts her alongside Alice Liddell and Wendy Darling, becoming allied and romantically involved with Captain James Hook.
*In the graphic novel adaptation of &quot;How the Wizard Came to Oz&quot;, the Wicked Witch of the West is named Morella.
*In the 2021 novel &quot;Oscar Diggs, The Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Witch of the West is named Theodora Elphaba, a combination of the names from &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

==In dramatic representations==

===1910 film===
The 1910 silent film &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; features a character similar to the Wicked Witch of the West, identified in intertitles as &quot;Momba the Witch&quot; (Compare the character Mombi from &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;). In the film, Momba has an unspecified hold over the Wizard, who promises his crown to anyone who can release him from Momba&#x27;s power. Momba captures Dorothy and her companions, evoking the events in Baum&#x27;s original novel, and is destroyed when Dorothy throws a bucket of water over her.

===1914 film===
Mombi&#x27;s likeness and costume in the 1914 silent film, &quot;His Majesty, the Scarecrow of Oz&quot; is based on Denslow&#x27;s illustrations of the Wicked Witch of the West.

===1939 film===

In the 1939 version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, Margaret Hamilton plays the Wicked Witch of the West as a green-skinned witch dressed in a long black dress with a black pointed hat. This representation of the Wicked Witch has become a standard for what witches resemble and an archetype of human wickedness. While the relationship is not mentioned in Baum&#x27;s books, in the movie the Witch is the sister of the Wicked Witch of the East. The movie makes her even more of a primary antagonist, and consequently, she appears in the film much earlier (and more often), than in Baum&#x27;s original novel. She is described by Glinda, the Good Witch of the North (not the South as in the book), as &quot;worse than the other one&quot;. She actively seeks revenge against Dorothy for killing her sister, even though it was &quot;accidental&quot;. However, as soon as the Witch is reminded of the ruby slippers, all interest in her sister&#x27;s death vanishes and all she cares about is obtaining her slippers, which will enable her to conquer Oz. She is more menacing than her literary counterpart, making Dorothy too afraid to ever lose her temper with the Witch. She makes sure that Dorothy knows her power when Dorothy meets the Scarecrow by throwing a ball of fire at them. Before Dorothy and her friends get to the city, the Witch casts a sleeping spell over a field of poppies through which the group must pass. Glinda remotely counteracts the spell with snowfall. The Wicked Witch then flies on her broom over the Emerald City, demanding that the citizens of the Emerald City Surrender Dorothy to her, and the Wizard demands the destruction of the Witch, with her broom as proof, in exchange for granting the wishes of Dorothy and her companions. Unlike Baum&#x27;s original depiction, the Wicked Witch sends the Winged Monkeys as the first wave of attack. She is killed when Dorothy throws a bucket of water on her, in attempt to put out a fire the witch bestowed on the Scarecrow. In the novel, Dorothy simply throws it on her in a fit of anger. There is no prior mention of the Wicked Witch&#x27;s vulnerability to water in the movie, save for a split-second before the water actually douses her when she screams &quot;Don&#x27;t throw that water!&quot; (this line does not appear in the film&#x27;s shooting script). After the Wicked Witch of the West is dead, her soldiers are glad to be free of her power, and quote &quot;Hail to Dorothy! The Wicked Witch is dead!&quot; The character ranks No. 4 in the American Film Institute&#x27;s list of the 50 Best Movie Villains of All Time alongside Darth Vader, Norman Bates, and Hannibal Lecter, making her the highest ranking female villain, as well as placing 90th on &quot;Empire&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time&quot;.

Hamilton&#x27;s other role in this film is the Witch&#x27;s Kansas sepia tone counterpart, Miss Almira Gulch, created for the film by screenwriter Noel Langley. Gulch is a socialite who owns half the county, seeking to have Dorothy&#x27;s dog Toto taken to the sheriff and destroyed after being bitten. This prompts Dorothy to call her &quot;a wicked old witch.&quot; Miss Gulch takes Toto away in her basket, but he escapes. In the tornado scene, Dorothy sees Miss Gulch on her bicycle transform into a Wicked Witch flying on a broom.

Gale Sondergaard was originally cast as the Wicked Witch of the West, but withdrew from the role when the witch&#x27;s persona shifted from sly and glamorous (thought to emulate the Evil Queen in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs&quot;) to the familiar &quot;ugly hag&quot;.

====Hamilton&#x27;s other appearances====

On a 1976 episode of the American children&#x27;s TV show &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, the Witch, once again played by Hamilton, drops her broom and falls onto the street. Big Bird and a Sesame Street resident, David, have the broom and refuse to give it back because of her nasty and disrespectful attitude (Oscar the Grouch is the only Sesame Street resident who finds her pleasant; he even develops a crush on her). Enraged, the Wicked Witch threatens to turn them into a feather duster and a basketball, respectively, unless they comply with her wishes; she also makes it rain inside of Mr. Hooper&#x27;s store as an intimidation tactic. Realizing that threats and intimidation have failed to yield the desired result, she resorts to trickery, disguising herself as a sweet old lady in an effort to steal the broom back. David turns the tables on her by willingly giving it back after talking her into asking for it politely and with respect. Unfortunately, she does not learn the lesson about being nice and heads home on discourteous terms with the locals (except, perhaps, for Big Bird, who says he will miss her because the events of the episode were an exciting change). The Wicked Witch accidentally drops the broom again while showing off on her flight home, and David, again in possession of it, laments his prediction that the whole ordeal will now repeat itself.

This episode received a very negative reception. After it was aired, the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW) and series creators Joan Ganz Cooney and Lloyd Morrisett received numerous letters from parents, who complained that the Wicked Witch was too scary for their children, using phrases such as &quot;screams and tears&quot; and &quot;the threat of the witch&#x27;s power remains in children&#x27;s eyes.&quot; As a result of these complaints, Anna Herera, of the CTW Research Department, told the creators of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; to not re-air the episode. The episode was considered lost but was leaked anonymously on June 18, 2022.

The Museum of the Moving Image in New York City screened part of the Wicked Witch episode on November 24, 2019, as part of a &quot;Lost and Found&quot; event that celebrated the 50th anniversary of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. It was accompanied by many other clips, including the unaired episode &quot;Snuffy&#x27;s Parents Get a Divorce&quot;, along with a discussion panel with Jim Henson Legacy president Craig Shemin, former Sesame Street head writer Norman Stiles, and Sesame Workshop&#x27;s Rosemarie Truglio.

Hamilton also played the Wicked Witch of the West in &quot;The Paul Lynde Halloween Special&quot; (1976), and reprised her role several times on stage, most notably at the St. Louis Municipal Opera.

Hamilton also appeared as herself on &quot;Mister Rogers&#x27; Neighborhood&quot; three times between 1975 and 1976. In these appearances, she demonstrated how her costume and acting skills made her appear to be the Witch, and assured her young viewers that there was nothing about her to be feared, because her portrayal in the film was only make-believe.

===&quot;Wicked&quot;===

The story line of the stage adaptation &quot;goes far afield&quot; from the 1995 novel. As Winnie Holzman observed in an interview with &quot;Playbill&quot;, &quot;It was [Maguire&#x27;s] brilliant idea to take this hated figure and tell things from her point of view, and to have the two witches be roommates in college, but the way in which their friendship develops – and really the whole plot – is different onstage.&quot; Schwartz justified the deviation, saying &quot;Primarily we were interested in the relationship between Galinda – who becomes Glinda – and Elphaba...the friendship of these two women and how their characters lead them to completely different destinies.&quot; In addition to this change in focus, other major plot modifications include Fiyero&#x27;s appearance as the scarecrow, Elphaba&#x27;s survival at the end, Nessarose using a wheelchair instead of being born without arms, Boq having a continuing love interest for Glinda – and eventually becoming the Tin Woodman instead of Nick Chopper, the complete cutting of Elphaba&#x27;s years in the Vinkus, the deletion of Liir&#x27;s birth, Fiyero not having a wife and children, and Doctor Dillamond not being murdered.

===&quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;===

Mila Kunis portrays the Wicked Witch of the West, who is named Theodora, in the 2013 film &quot;Oz the Great and Powerful&quot;. In this version, she is portrayed as a &#x27;good witch&#x27; and as the younger sister of Evanora (Rachel Weisz), who is at war with Glinda (Michelle Williams) for control of Oz; Theodora wants nothing more than for peace to come back to their land. She falls in love with Oscar Diggs (James Franco), but her feelings for him are one-sided; Theodora wants to be Oscar&#x27;s queen when he rules Oz. After Oscar goes to meet with Glinda, Evanora convinces Theodora that Oscar had betrayed her, offering her a magic apple that will help Theodora forget her disappointment. Theodora immediately takes a bite from it, but she realizes too late that Evanora had deceived her. Before Theodora can do anything, she starts feeling great pain and delirium as the apple, tainted with dark magic, causes her heart to wither and her skin to turn green. Though Evanora offers to cover up Theodora&#x27;s new appearance with an enchantment, Theodora embraces her new appearance and helps her sister attempt to kill Glinda, get revenge on Oscar, and take control of Oz. However, she and Evanora are defeated by Oscar&#x27;s illusions. Theodora is forced to flee the city on her broom, but she threatens to return. Oscar tells her he knows her wickedness is not her doing and, if she ever finds the goodness within her, she is welcome to return. However, she refuses and flies off to the West, vowing revenge.

===&quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;===
The Wicked Witch appears as the main antagonist of the second half of the season 3 of &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot;, played by Rebecca Mader. This version goes by the name of Zelena (which means &quot;green&quot; in some Slavic languages), the daughter of Cora, the Queen of Hearts (Barbara Hershey/Rose McGowan) and older half-sister of Regina, the Evil Queen (Lana Parrilla). Abandoned by Cora and raised in Oz, Zelena learned how to control her own powerful magic with the help of Rumplestiltskin (Robert Carlyle). Wishing for familial love, and growing increasingly jealous of Regina&#x27;s past success at infiltrating the royal family, Zelena works to collect ingredients to create a time-travel spell to create a more favorable trajectory for her life. She is eventually stopped by Emma Swan as well as Regina&#x27;s new mastery of light magic in time to oppose her, before seemingly killed by Rumplestiltskin.

It was later discovered that Zelena&#x27;s soul successfully went back in time, where she revived herself and assumed the identity of Maid Marian (Christie Laing), who is rescued and brought back to the present by the heroes. She becomes pregnant by Robin Hood (Sean Maguire), primarily to make Regina suffer (Regina and Robin had started a relationship before the perceived survival of Maid Marian). After Emma becomes the Dark One, she speeds up Zelena&#x27;s pregnancy so she can have an unhampered ally. However, Zelena begins to bond with her new daughter, though after Emma is cured, Zelena is sent back to Oz, while Regina and the others assume custody of the child.

On Zelena&#x27;s return to Oz, she confronts Dorothy, stealing her silver slippers to travel back to her daughter in Storybrooke. By this point, the heroes had been transported to the Underworld to deal with Hades, one of Zelena&#x27;s former lovers. Zelena, trying to change for her daughter, begins to repair her relationship with Regina, though she still shares True Love&#x27;s Kiss with Hades. However, Hades kills Robin Hood with the Olympian Crystal, and Zelena makes her choice to fight for good, killing Hades with the same weapon, and naming her daughter Robin after the child&#x27;s father.

===&quot;Guardians of Oz&quot;===
In the Mexican animated feature &quot;Guardians of Oz&quot;, Glinda revives the Wicked Witch while removing her powers, storing them in a magic broom. Nonetheless, the Witch, here named Evilene, conducts an evil pursuit to get her powers back.

===&quot;Emerald City&quot;===
The Witch of the West, known as Mistress West, appears as one of the main characters in the television series &quot;Emerald City&quot;, portrayed by Ana Ularu. Here she&#x27;s one of the last Cardinal Witches of Oz and the &quot;Mistress of the Western Fields, Vessel of Truth and Solace&quot;, along with her sisters Glinda of the North and the Witch of the East. West seemingly obeys the Wizard of Oz&#x27;s law against magic, owns a brothel in the Emerald City and is a poppy opium addict, deteriorating her magical skill. She is very emotional, especially when compared to the reserved behavior of Glinda. Despite claiming to hate magic because it could not save her mother and sister witches during the Beast Forever&#x27;s last attack, she resorts to it quickly when in pursuit of Dorothy after she accidentally killed East.

===Minor roles in other adaptations===
*In &quot;The Wiz&quot; (1974), its film version (1978), and television special (2015), the Wicked Witch of the West is given the name Evillene (portrayed by Mabel King in both the original Broadway cast and the film, and Mary J. Blige in the television special). She is the malevolent ruler of the Winkies. She is the sister of Addaperle (Miss One in the film version), Glinda, and Evermean, the other three witches of Oz. In the film version, she runs a sweatshop under Yankee Stadium with the slogan &quot;Manufacturers and Exporters of Sweat&quot; and extracts it not only from the Winkies, but the Crows, the Poppy Girls, and the Subway Peddler. Her magic creates urban variations on the Kalidahs (depicted as evil growing dolls sent by the Subway Peddler), Fighting Trees (depicted as mobile pillars) and the wolves (depicted as living and carnivorous trash cans), all in the Subway system. She then sends the Flying Monkeys (depicted as a biker gang) to capture Dorothy and her friends. In the film, Evillene is vanquished when Dorothy sets off the sweatshop&#x27;s sprinkler system, thus ending her reign over the Winkies.
*In &quot;Scooby-Doo and Scrappy-Doo&quot;″s 1981 episode &quot;Scooby&#x27;s Trip to Ahz&quot;, the Witch appears as the Wicked Witch of the North by Southeast.
*In the anime film &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1982), the Witch (voiced by Elizabeth Hanna) is purple-skinned, white-haired, and wears an eyepatch similar to W. W. Denslow&#x27;s original illustration. However, her telescopic eye is replaced by a magic mirror. Her soldiers are completely magical, disappear at her demise, and are quite distinct from the Winkies, whom she uses only for labor. She wears an old-fashioned peasant dress and possesses a staff, through which she generates her magic.
*In the 1988 Polish cutout cartoon series &quot;W krainie czarnoksiężnika Oza&quot; (&quot;In the Land of the Wizard of Oz&quot;), which adapts &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot; and &quot;The Marvelous Land of Oz&quot;, Wicked Witch of the West and Wicked Witch of the East is combined into one character (voiced by Alina Bukowska) called &quot;Wicked Witch of the East&quot; and she ruled both Munchkin and Winkie Country. She is depicted as a short white-haired hag in the red stereotypical witch dress. In this version name &quot;Wicked Witch of the West&quot; is given to Mombi.
*In the 1986 anime series &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, the Witch is purple-skinned once again, and has long white hair with a blood-like red streak. She possesses both eyes and is dressed in a long, black hooded gown. Her eyes have the power to turn people into stone, and turn blood-red when such transformations are effected. One of the Winkies actually tries to crush her to death with a huge boulder, but the Witch causes the boulder to disappear, and turns the man into stone. Like in the 1982 anime film, a magic mirror shows her everything she wishes to uncover. The Wicked Witch makes it clear to Dorothy that the Good Witch of the North&#x27;s kiss cannot serve as protection from her apparently superior power, and it&#x27;s the Silver Shoes that safeguard the girl. The Witch also reveals that the Wicked Witch of the East was her sister, and that the Silver Shoes could triple her own powers. This version gives the witch the most prolonged and dramatic death scene of all versions; it also differs from previous adaptations by suggesting that Mombi was her protégé.
*In the animated series &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot; (1990–1991) by DiC Enterprises, the Flying Monkeys that were loyal to the Wicked Witch of the West (voiced by Tress MacNeille) perform a ritual that resurrects the Wicked Witch of the West where they place her hat, dress and cloak on an effigy. Afterwards, she terrorizes Oz again by tarnishing the Emerald City, stealing what Dorothy&#x27;s friends treasure the most (the Scarecrow&#x27;s brain diploma, the Tin Woodman&#x27;s clock heart, and the Cowardly Lion&#x27;s medal of courage), and making the Wizard fly off-course in his hot-air balloon by creating an evil wind. Of course she still has a weakness to any type of water causing her to evade at all times. This incarnation of the character was clearly based on the 1939 MGM movie, to which the series itself served as an unofficial sequel. Although the witch&#x27;s garments are purple here rather than black.
*The Witch appears in a little-known 1995 version of the original story made for British cable television starring Denise Van Outen as Dorothy and featured a cameo appearance by Zoe Salmon of Blue Peter fame. It combined elements of Baum&#x27;s original story, the 1939 movie, and the 1985 semi-sequel &quot;Return to Oz&quot;. She first appears after Dorothy lands in Oz, demands to know where the Ruby Slippers are, threatens Dorothy, then leaves. The Munchkins then reveal they hid the Slippers to keep the Witch from getting them, force them onto Dorothy, who then leaves to find the Wizard. At the end of the film, after taking the Slippers while Dorothy is sleeping, the Witch turns her loose in a room full of large rocks, says she&#x27;s turned Dorothy&#x27;s companions into rocks themselves, and will give her three chances to pick which ones are her friends, but if she guesses wrong, she will become one herself. To be fair, she turns the Slippers into a rock and hides them in the room. Dorothy, however manages to find the Tin Woodman, Scarecrow and Cowardly Lion. The Witch, enraged, grows to giant sized and holds a boulder over Dorothy, who then finds the Slippers and wishes for the Witch to lose her power. The Witch loses her strength and falls backwards, and the boulder kills her instantly.
*In the 1995 television special &quot;The Wizard of Oz in Concert: Dreams Come True&quot; (a stage musical based on the 1939 film), Debra Winger portrays the Witch. Her costume is green rather than black. In addition, Winger narrates the tornado scene including Miss Gulch&#x27;s transformation. This production omits the scene where the Witch threatens Dorothy, the Scarecrow, and Tin Man as mattresses and a beehive after appearing on top of The Tin Man&#x27;s cottage. The Wicked Witch&#x27;s Castle scenes are shortened due to time limit. Unlike Margaret Hamilton, Winger says the line &quot;What a little whiner! I&#x27;ll give you something to cry about&quot; when Dorothy suffers her imprisonment after Aunt Em&#x27;s image fades away in the crystal ball rather than &quot;I&#x27;ll give you Auntie Em, my pretty!&quot;.
*In the February 1996 episode &quot;Water You Thinking?&quot; of &quot;Mighty Morphin&#x27; Alien Rangers&quot;, a witch monster appears by the name of Witchblade and she seems to be modeled after the Wicked Witch. Her voice and cackle are reminiscent of the 1939 film&#x27;s portrayal of the Witch. Additionally, most of her lines are paraphrasings of the Witch&#x27;s lines, such as &quot;How &#x27;bout a little fire, Rangers?&quot;. She also refers to the Rangers&#x27; Zords as &quot;Tin Men&quot; and to the Rangers as &quot;My pretties&quot;. When she&#x27;s defeated, she cries &quot;Oh, no! I&#x27;m falling, falling! What a world!&quot;
*In &quot;Anthology of Interest II&quot;, a 2002 episode of the animated television series &quot;Futurama&quot;, Leela is knocked unconscious and dreams about being Dorothy in a version of &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, with &quot;Futurama&quot; characters playing the roles of &quot;Wizard&quot; characters. While Fry is the Scarecrow, Bender the Robot is the Tinman, and Doctor Zoidberg is the Lion, the Wicked Witch is played by Mom, a recurring antagonist from the show, voice by Tress MacNeille who also provided the voice for The Wicked Witch of the West in the 1990 DIC animated series. The Witch sends her flying monkeys, played by Mom&#x27;s sons Larry, Walt, and Igner, to capture Dorothy/Leela. At the Witch&#x27;s castle, she reveals that she wants to adopt Dorothy as her daughter, and Dorothy/Leela agrees, as long as she gets to be a witch, too. The Witch/Mom meets her fate when Tinman/Bender opens a celebratory bottle of champagne and accidentally sprays her with it, melting her. Later, after Dorothy/Leela uses the power of her ruby boots to become the new Wicked Witch of the West, water splashes down on her from the ceiling, causing her to melt as well, to which the Cowardly Lobster/Zoidberg descends the stairs, mentioning &quot;I think there&#x27;s a problem with your upstairs toilet.&quot;
*In &quot;The Muppets&#x27; Wizard of Oz&quot; (2005), Miss Piggy plays all of the witches of Oz, including the Wicked Witch of the West. Her basic attire evoked W. W. Denslow&#x27;s original illustration, with a biker theme. The eyepatch also covered a magical glass-eye that gave her visual powers. This version of the Wicked Witch is only vulnerable to &quot;tap&quot; water where she is able to bathe in bottled water. The Wicked Witch of the West is vanquished when Dorothy kicks her into the bathtub filled with bottled tap water since Angel Marie filled the bottles with tap water. Afterwards, Dorothy salvages her glass-eye which is later given to the Wizard of Oz. Miss Piggy&#x27;s other role is herself. Prior to Dorothy&#x27;s journey, she appears with Kermit and tries to get rid of Dorothy. After Dorothy&#x27;s return, she returns for the Muppets&#x27; show.
*In the October 2007 &quot;VeggieTales&quot; episode &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Ha&#x27;s&quot;, the witch and her Kansas counterpart from the 1939 film are replaced by Bobby the Bully (Kansas) and Chester the Bully (Wonderful Land of Ha&#x27;s), both portrayed by Gourdon from &quot;Bully Trouble&quot;.
*In the December 2007 Syfy miniseries &quot;Tin Man&quot;, the character of Azkadellia (played by Kathleen Robertson) is analogous with the Wicked Witch of the West, though she is vastly different from most other versions of the character. In the miniseries, she is portrayed as a member of the Royal Family of the O.Z. (Outer Zone) who is possessed as a young girl by the spirit of the evil Witch of the Dark (Karin Konoval) who uses her body to take over the O.Z. and plunge it into a world of permanent darkness. This adaptation&#x27;s version of Dorothy Gale is Azkadellia&#x27;s younger sister DG (Zooey Deschanel). Both of the sisters are powerful witches themselves, though DG has to relearn all of her magical abilities, and once DG frees Azkadellia from the witch&#x27;s grip, both of them defeat her together. Although it is clear that Azkadellia is analogous with the Wicked Witch of the West, it is implied vaguely that the Witch of the Dark is the Wicked Witch that Dorothy, who makes an appearance as a spirit in a mausoleum, defeated in the original story.
*In &quot;Dorothy of Oz&quot;, a Korean &quot;manhwa&quot; (produced 2008 or earlier) by Son Hee-Joon, the Witch of the West is re-imagined as a scientist who rules over the Western Dominion and the true orchestrator of the death of the East Witch Selluriah. She is the creator of an army of clones, one of whom is the story&#x27;s equivalent of the Scarecrow. 
*The Wicked Witch of the West appears as the primary antagonist of the 2011 television miniseries &quot;Dorothy and the Witches of Oz&quot;, played by Eliza Swenson. In flashbacks, it was seen that she had obtained the mystical Book of Bini Aru (which contained the Changing Word) from the Wizard as part of a deal not to continue her attack on Oz in exchange that the Wizard doesn&#x27;t plan to reclaim the book. Unfortunately for the Wicked Witch of the West, the Wizard entrusted the key to the Book of Bini Aru to Dorothy for safekeeping. On Earth, she assumes the form of a female book publishing agent named Billie Westbrook and plans to obtain key from Dorothy so that she can lead Princess Langwidere, the Nome King and an army of winged monkeys, Nomes, and dragons into taking over Earth upon learning the Changing Word. The Wicked Witch of the West also had plans to invade Wonderland, Neverland, Camelot, Narnia, and Shangri-La.
*The Wicked Witch of the West has a cameo appearance in &quot;Legends of Oz: Dorothy&#x27;s Return&quot; during one of the Jester&#x27;s songs. The Jester is presented as her brother who was cursed to be trapped in a jester&#x27;s costume by the Witch with Glinda noting that she didn&#x27;t know the Witch had a sense of humor.
*The Wicked Witch of the West appears as a boss character and playable figure in the video game &quot;Lego Dimensions&quot;, voiced by Courtenay Taylor. She is the only playable character from the &quot;Wizard of Oz&quot; franchise. During the video game&#x27;s story, she is the boss in the first level “Follow the LEGO Brick Road”, where Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle face off against her, who appears right after Dorothy and her friends go missing alongside the Ruby Slippers, and were able to defeat her with water and steal the Shift Keystone from her. Her hat is later salvaged by Lord Vortech.
*The Wicked Witch of the West appears in &quot;Tom and Jerry and the Wizard of Oz&quot;, voiced by Laraine Newman.
*In season 9 of the American television show &quot;Supernatural&quot;, the Wicked Witch (portrayed by Maya Massar) appears as the villain of the episode &quot;Slumber Party&quot;.
*The Wicked Witch of the West appears in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot;, voiced by Riki Lindhome who was uncredited for the role. She is one of many iconic movie villains imprisoned in the Phantom Zone. When Harley Quinn steals the Phantom Zone Projector from Arkham Asylum&#x27;s evidence locker and frees Joker and the Phantom Zone inmates, the Wicked Witch unleashes the Winged Monkeys to cause mayhem in Gotham City. Eventually, the villains and sent back to the Phantom Zone.
*In the Amazon Prime animated series &quot;Lost in Oz&quot;, West (voiced by Nika Futterman) is the great, great-granddaughter of the Wicked Witch of the West who journeys with Dorothy Gale (the descendant of the original), her pet dog Toto, and a medium-sized munchkin name Ojo to help her return to Kansas after she lands in the futuristic magical land of Oz. When she becomes greedy, her skin turns green as if she&#x27;s almost turning into her ancestor. However the true Wicked Witch of the West is revealed to be West aunt, Langwidere, a Wicked Witch and Cyra&#x27;s sister. Contrary to her sister, who is good-hearted and loving, Langwidere is a cold-hearted and vengeful woman because of her hatred towards the Gales. Her plan is to become empress of Oz but ultimately fails and becomes trap in a magic paint by Smith and defeated by the great granddaughter of Dorothy Gale with the same name, Ojo, and her niece.
*The Wicked Witch of the West appears as one of the final antagonists in Chris Colfer&#x27;s The Land of Stories series, after the Masked Man uses a potion to bring her, the Queen of Hearts (from Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland), and Captain Hook (from Peter Pan) from their respective books. After betraying the Masked Man the three villains are eventually defeated by fictionalized versions of L. Frank Baum, Lewis Carroll, and J. M. Barrie brought to life by the same potion.
*In the third volume of &quot;Shazam!&quot;, the Wicked Witch of the West came from the Wozenderlands and is a member of the Monster Society of Evil. She was among its members imprisoned in the Dungeon of Eternity within the Monsterlands until Mister Mind instructed Doctor Sivana on how to free them. As Shazam fights the Mister Mind-controlled C.C. Batson, Freddy fights the Wicked Witch of the West and Jeepers. She does managed to use her spells to trap Eugene in some vines. When Shazam defeats Mister Mind, the resulting magical energy knocked out the Wicked Witch of the West and the rest of the Monster Society of Evil. The Monster Society of Evil was mentioned to have been remanded to Rock Falls Penitentiary where the Shazam Family built a special section to contain magical threats.
*The Wicked Witch of the West cameos in the Warner Bros. Serververse crowd in the 2021 film &quot;Space Jam: A New Legacy&quot;.
*In Andrew Kolb&#x27;s &quot;OZ: A Fantasy Role-Playing Setting&quot;, The Wicked Witch of the West appears, under the name Verdella (an apparent reference to her green skin). In this version, she has been reworked into The Wicked Lich of the West; like the other witches of note in Oz, she cannot be killed unless her phylactery is destroyed.
*In the Marvel Cinematic Universe television series &quot;Agatha All Along&quot;, the witch Agatha Harkness (played by Kathryn Hahn) was dressed as the Wicked Witch of the West for the fourth witch trial in episode seven &quot;Death&#x27;s Hand in Mine&quot; claiming &#x27;she was based on me, you know?&#x27;

<text>The 27th Infantry Division was a unit of the Army National Guard in World War I and World War II. The division traces its history from the New York Division, formed originally in 1908. The 6th Division designation was changed to the 27th Division in July 1917.

== History ==
When the New York Division was organized in 1908, New York became the second state, after Pennsylvania, to structure its National Guard at such a high tactical level in peacetime. The New York Division was called to active duty during the Mexican border crisis of 1916. While on federal duty, it was redesignated as the 6th Division in June 1916. It was released from active duty in December 1916, only to be recalled for World War I service in July 1917. The 6th Division was reorganized and redesignated as the 27th Division on 1 October 1917.

=== World War I ===

==== Formation ====
Following the declaration of war on the Central Powers by the United States, the division was called into federal service on 15 July 1917, and hastily recruited New Yorkers to increase its numbers.

The division was one of only four divisions formed during the war from National Guard units entirely from a single state; the other divisions so formed were from Illinois (the 33rd Division), Ohio (the 37th Division), and Pennsylvania (the 28th Division). However, not all New Yorkers served in the 27th. Its initial strength was 991 officers and 27,114 enlisted men. The division&#x27;s initial organization of three brigades with three infantry regiments each was carried over from the 6th Division

Prior to its departing to training, the division participated in a large send-off parade in New York City along 5th Avenue on 30 August 1917. The 7th Infantry Regiment was the first to leave for training on 11 September 1917, by train. The training was conducted at a purpose-built temporary facility at Camp Wadsworth, Spartanburg, South Carolina. Nearby hotels such as the Cleveland Hotel became centers for social life. The camp also housed seven YMCA Huts and a Knights of Columbus Hall. While the 27th had African-American service-men they were not permitted to enter the service organization clubs on base, which were segregated, until a black soldier&#x27;s club was built in early 1918.

In the spring of 1918, the division began its movement toward embarkation camps, and shipped out on 20 April 1918. The division&#x27;s advance detachment left Hoboken on 2 May and arrived at Brest, France, 10 May 1918. Late in June the last units of the 27th Division had arrived safely overseas.

==== Western Front ====
From the arrival of the first troops to the Western Front until 24 July, the division spent its time undertaking its final stages of training under British mentors in Picardy and Flanders. On 25 July, the 27th Division, excluding its artillery brigade and ammunition train, occupied the Dickebusch Lake and Scherpenberg sectors in Flanders.

In just over a month, this operation merged into the Ypres-Lys action, and then, from 19 August to 3 September, the 27th was on its own.

It was decided by Field marshal Douglas Haig that the Fourth Army&#x27;s Australian Corps would lead the Battle of St. Quentin Canal . However, due to the Corps depleted nature, which was a result of fighting almost continuously, it would be reinforced by the 27th and 30th divisions, which resulted in II Corps being temporarily reassigned under Australian command. This great Somme &quot;push&quot;, which lasted from 24 September to 1 October, saw the 27th engaged in severe fighting along the Saint Quentin Canal Tunnel—one of the out-lying strong points of the Hindenburg Line. At the conclusion of the first phase of the battle, and following heavy losses, the 27th was placed into reserve for rest and recuperation. Six days later, the division was sent back into the line, moving steadily toward Busigny whilst chasing the retreating Germans. These operations were supported by Australian Artillery until 9 October, when British artillery units began supporting the division&#x27;s operations. As a result of these offensives by the Australian, British and US forces, the Hindenburg&#x27;s Main Line was penetrated.

The 52d Field Artillery Brigade and the 102nd Ammunition Train of the New York Division had not gone with the rest of the Twenty-seventh Division to the British front in Flanders. They had moved up on 28 October, to support the Seventy-Ninth Division in the Argonne.

Meanwhile, the Twenty-Seventh Division units which had seen heavy action in Flanders, had moved back to an area near the French seaport of Brest.

*Major Operations: Meuse-Argonne (only the artillery), Ypres-Lys, Somme Offensive.
*Initially stationed in the East Poperinghe Line.
**Battle of Dickebusche Lake, Summer 1918
**Battle of Vierstraat Ridge, Summer 1918
**Struggled to break the German defensive Hindenburg Line, September 1918.
**Second battle of the Somme, 25 September 1918
**Selle River, November 1918

The 27th did break the Hindenburg line during the Battle of the Somme and forced a German retreat from their defensive line and forced the Germans to a final confrontation. After a final confrontation with the retreating Germans at the Selle River the Armistice ended the fighting and the division was sent home in February 1919, to be mustered out several months later. The division had sustained a total of 8,334 (KIA: 1,442; WIA: 6,892) casualties when it was inactivated in April 1919.

=== Interwar period ===

In 1921, the division was reconstituted in the National Guard, allotted to the state of New York in the Second Corps Area, and assigned to the II Corps. The division headquarters was reorganized and federally recognized at New York City on 23 December 1921.

The 53rd Infantry Brigade initially consisted of the 105th and 106th Infantry Regiments. On 1 September 1940, the first iteration of the 106th Infantry Regiment was converted into the 186th Field Artillery Regiment and 101st Military Police Battalion. The 10th Infantry (New York), formerly part of the separate 93rd Infantry Brigade (the headquarters of which was converted into the 71st Field Artillery Brigade on 1 September 1940), was assigned to the 53rd Brigade in its place. It was later redesignated the 106th Infantry, although it was lineally unrelated to the first unit bearing that designation. The 54th Infantry Brigade initially consisted of the 107th and 108th Infantry Regiments. On 1 August 1940, the 107th Infantry was converted into the 207th Coast Artillery Regiment, and the 165th Infantry, formerly part of the 93rd Infantry Brigade, was assigned in its place as of 20 June 1940.

The designated mobilization training center for the “Empire” Division was Camp Smith, near Peekskill, New York, also where much of the division’s training activities occurred between the wars. The mobilization training center was changed in 1939 to Camp Foster, Florida. The division, less the 52nd Field Artillery Brigade, conducted summer camp most years at Camp Smith, from 1922 to 1939. The 52nd Field Artillery Brigade trained most years at Pine Camp, New York, so that its batteries could conduct live-fire training at the ranges located there. Generally, the division staff conducted command post exercises (CPX) and staff training concurrent with the camps. However, in 1929, the division staff participated in the Second Corps Area CPX from 7–29 July at Camp Dix, New Jersey, and in the First Army CPXs in July 1931 and July 1934 also held at Camp Dix. For the 1935 camp, the division participated in the Second Corps Area phase of the First Army maneuvers at Pine Camp. During that maneuver, the 27th Division operated as part of the provisional II Corps against the provisional I Corps. The “Empire” division also participated in the First Army Maneuvers in 1939 and 1940 held at Plattsburg and Canton, New York, respectively. In both maneuvers, the 27th Division again operated as part of the provisional II Corps against the provisional I Corps. The division was inducted into active federal service at home stations on 15 October 1940, relieved from the II Corps, and assigned to the VII Corps. Instead of Camp Foster, however, the Empire Division was ordered to move to Fort McClellan, Alabama, where it arrived on 25 October 1940. After the division’s initial train-up period, it participated in the Carolina Maneuvers in October–November 1941.

=== World War II ===

Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, the division was one of the first stateside divisions to be assigned defensive duties. The 27th Division departed Fort McClellan on 14 December 1941 for California to establish blocking positions against a seaborne invasion of the United States southwestern coast. They were further transferred to the Pacific Theater of Operations and arrived in Hawaii, 21 May 1942, to defend the outer islands from amphibious attack. In September 1942, the division was reorganized from a &quot;square&quot; to a &quot;triangular&quot; division. The 27th was the last of the National Guard divisions to make this change, as it had been earmarked for overseas shipment and had departed for Hawaii in the midst of the other divisions being converted in the spring of 1942, and Army officials in Hawaii had prepared facilities to receive the units of a larger &quot;square&quot; division. The 165th Infantry (the once and future 69th Infantry) and 3rd Battalion, 105th Infantry first saw action against the enemy during the attack and capture of Makin Atoll in the Gilbert Islands, 21–24 November 1943. The 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 106th Regiment participated in the attack on Eniwetok Atoll, 19–26 February 1944, returning to Oahu in March. During this mission, the 2nd Battalion, 106th Infantry landed unopposed on Majuro Island, 1 February, and completed its seizure, 3 February. The division began preparations for the Marianas operations, 15 March. On D-day plus 1, 16 June 1944, elements landed at night on Saipan to support the Second and Fourth Marine Divisions. A beachhead was established and Aslito Airfield captured, 18 June. Fighting continued throughout June. Marine General Holland Smith, unsatisfied with the performance of the 27th Division, relieved its commander, Army General Ralph C. Smith., which led to angry recrimination from senior Army commanders, including Army Chief of Staff George C. Marshall. During a pitched battle, 7 July, Japanese overran elements of the division in a banzai attack, but organized resistance was crushed the next day. During the months of July and August, the 27th cleaned out isolated pockets in the mountains and cliffs of Saipan.

Beginning in the middle of August, the division moved to the New Hebrides for rest and rehabilitation. On
25 March 1945, the 27th sailed from Espiritu Santo, arriving at Okinawa, 9 April 1945. The Division participated in the XXIV Corps general attack, 19 April 1945, securing a dominating ridge line south of Machinato and Kakazu. Machinato Airfield was captured, 28 April, after a severe struggle. On 1 May, the division was relieved by the 1st Marine Division and attached to the Island Command for garrison duty. Tori Shima was seized, 12 May, without opposition. The 27th attacked from the south end of Ishikawa Isthmus to sweep the northern sector of Okinawa. The enemy fought bitterly on Onnatake Hill from 23 May until 2 June, before losing the strong point. After a mopping-up period, the division left Okinawa, 7 September 1945, moved to Japan and occupied Niigata and Fukushima Prefectures.
* Overseas: 10 March 1942.
* Campaigns: Divisional elements participated in various campaigns in the Pacific Theater:
* Distinguished Unit Citations: 2.
* Awards: MH: 4; DSC: 21; DSM: 2 ; Silver Star: 412; LM: 15; SM: 13; BSM: 986; AM: 9.
* Returned to U.S.: 15 December 1945
* Inactivated: 31 December 1945
==== Casualties ====
*Total battle casualties: 6,533
*Killed in action: 1,512
*Wounded in action: 4,980
*Missing in action: 40
*Prisoner of war: 1
=== Postwar ===
The division was reformed as a National Guard formation on 21 April 1947. The division was reconstituted along the lines of its wartime structure with limited reorganizations.

On 1 February 1955 the 27th Division became the 27th Armored Division, retaining many of its former units.

On 1 February 1968, the division was reorganized as the 27th Armored Brigade, a unit of the 50th Armored Division.

The 27th Armored Brigade was reorganized as an infantry brigade in 1975 and aligned with the 42nd Infantry Division.

In 1985 the 27th Infantry Brigade was activated as part of the New York Army National Guard, and assigned as the &quot;roundout&quot; brigade of the Army&#x27;s 10th Mountain Division.

The 27th Brigade was later reorganized as the 27th Infantry Brigade Combat Team, and reestablished use of the 27th Infantry Division&#x27;s NYD shoulder sleeve insignia. The 27th Infantry Brigade carries on the lineage and history of the 27th Infantry Division.

<text>Kelly&#x27;s Heroes is a 1970 war comedy drama film directed by Brian G. Hutton. Set during World War II, the film tells the story of a motley crew of American GIs who go AWOL to rob a French bank, located behind German lines, of its stored Nazi gold bars.

The film stars Clint Eastwood and Telly Savalas, and co-stars Don Rickles, Carroll O&#x27;Connor, and Donald Sutherland providing the comic absurdity, with secondary, comedic roles by Harry Dean Stanton, Gavin MacLeod, Karl-Otto Alberty, and Stuart Margolin. The screenplay was written by British film and television writer Troy Kennedy Martin. The film was a US-Yugoslav co-production, filmed mainly in the Croatian village of Vižinada on the Istria peninsula.

==Plot==
In 1944 France, during World War II, United States Army Private Kelly—a former lieutenant scapegoated for a failed infantry assault—captures Colonel Dankhopf of Wehrmacht Intelligence. Kelly realizes that Dankhopf is carrying several gold bars and after getting him drunk, learns that they are from a cache of 14,000 gold bars worth $16 million, stored in a bank behind German lines in the French town of Clermont. Dankhopf is then killed when Germans overrun the American line.

Kelly decides to steal the gold and attempts to recruit his cynical master sergeant, &quot;Big Joe&quot;. Concerned for his men, Big Joe refuses to risk their lives for money, and warns Kelly against telling them of his plan. Kelly then recruits money-motivated Supply Sergeant &quot;Crapgame&quot; to provide the needed weapons and supplies. Eccentric hippy tank commander, &quot;Oddball&quot;, overhears the heist plan and suggests that his three unattached M4 Sherman tanks join the caper. Finally, Kelly broaches his plan to Big Joe&#x27;s platoon, who—disillusioned with the pointless battles, being bombed by their own side, and risking daily death for a low salary—eagerly join him. After much argument, Big Joe, equally frustrated by their circumstances, agrees to go along.

To avoid drawing attention, Kelly&#x27;s infantrymen travel separately from Oddball&#x27;s unit, who fight their way through the German lines and destroy an enemy-held railway depot. However, the bridge needed for their tanks to cross a river is destroyed by Allied fighter-bombers. Oddball contacts an engineering unit to build a replacement bridge, and the engineers, in turn, bring in even more men to supply support.

After an American fighter aircraft destroys their jeeps and half-tracks, assuming they are German soldiers, Kelly and his men proceed on foot. They inadvertently walk into a minefield, and one of the men is blown up. A German patrol arrives to investigate, forcing Kelly&#x27;s team to engage them. To Joe&#x27;s dismay, the last two men still trapped in the minefield are killed before Kelly&#x27;s team can eliminate the German soldiers.

Oddball&#x27;s group reunites with Kelly&#x27;s two nights later, bringing with him the extra troops he recruited. Kelly and Oddballs&#x27;s men battle their way to Clermont, but the extra troops remain trapped on the opposite side of the river after the bridge is destroyed, and they begin building a new one. Meanwhile, their radio messages are intercepted by allied command and Major General Colt, who misinterprets them as efforts by an aggressive Army unit independently pushing through the previously unmoving battle lines. Colt immediately rushes to this new front to exploit this &quot;breakthrough&quot;.

Kelly&#x27;s men infiltrate Clermont and, under the cover of the ringing church bells, eliminate the German infantry, while Oddball&#x27;s unit tactically destroys two of the three superior enemy Tiger I tanks. After Oddball&#x27;s final tank breaks down, the men find themselves stalemated, unable to damage the remaining Tiger or breach the heavily fortified bank.

At Crapgame&#x27;s suggestion, Kelly, Big Joe, and Oddball approach the Tiger to offer its commander a deal, surmising that he is, like them, a soldier following orders, unaware of the gold in the bank. They offer him an equal share of the gold in exchange for using the Tiger to destroy the bank&#x27;s armored doors. Afterward, the Germans and Oddball&#x27;s crew depart with their shares, while Kelly&#x27;s remaining men each receive $875,000 of gold.

Learning that the still oblivious Colt has arrived to celebrate their &quot;victory&quot;, Big Joe deceives the joyously liberated Clermont townspeople that Colt is French General Charles de Gaulle, and they block his path in eager anticipation, while Kelly and his men escape with the gold.

==Cast==


==Production==
===Origins===

The screenplay was written by British film and television writer Troy Kennedy Martin. He relied on a true story, featured as &quot;The Greatest Robbery on Record&quot; in &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; from 1956 to 2000. On 4 December 1968, Elliott Morgan, head of research for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, wrote to the &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; requesting information on this entry: &quot;The greatest robbery on record was of the German National Gold Reserves in Bavaria by a combine of U.S. military personnel and German civilians in 1945&quot;. On 10 December, the editor, Norris D. McWhirter, wrote back to Morgan, stating that he had very little information and that he essentially suspected that a cover-up had occurred, which required that the story should be subject to a &quot;restricted classification&quot;. He closed by suggesting that until that security classification was changed, &quot;due to death or eflux &quot;[sic]&quot; of time, &quot;any film made will have to be an historical romance rather than history&quot;.

In 1975, British researcher Ian Sayer began a nine-year investigation into the Guinness entry. The results of his investigation, which confirmed a cover-up by the U.S. government together with the involvement of U.S. military and former &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and SS officers in the theft, were published in the 1984 book &quot;Nazi Gold — The Sensational Story of the World&#x27;s Greatest Robbery — and the Greatest Criminal Cover-Up&quot;. The investigation finally led to two of the missing gold bars (valued in 2019 at over $1 million) being handed over by German officials to the U.S. government in a secret ceremony at Bonn on 27 September 1996. The bullion was transported to the Bank of England, where it was held to the account of the Tripartite Commission for the Restitution of Monetary Gold (TCRMG). The first disclosure that the bank was holding the two bars (complete with Nazi markings) came from a press release issued by the bank on 8 May 1997, which confirmed that the two bars were those that had been identified as missing in the book &quot;Nazi Gold&quot;. Sayer had given information to the United States Department of State concerning the two bars (among other things) in July 1978. In 1983, they finally agreed to investigate using Sayer&#x27;s evidence. The State Department investigation did not conclude until 1997. On 11 December 1997, Sayer was invited, by the secretary general of the TCRMG, to view the two bars in the gold bullion vaults of the Bank of England. In addition to being accorded this rare honour, he was also photographed holding the bars, which he had been instrumental in tracking down.

===Filming===
The project was announced by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) in November 1968 under the title of &quot;The Warriors&quot;. Filming commenced in July 1969 and was completed in December. The film was made and released during a time of great financial difficulties for MGM, in the early days of the turbulent ownership by Kirk Kerkorian. Location shooting was done in Yugoslavia, in the Istrian village of Vižinada, in the city of Novi Sad, and the ruins of the Beočin palace (in present-day Croatia and Serbia, respectively), and finally in London. One of the reasons for the selection of Yugoslavia as the main location was that in 1969, it was one of the few nations whose army were still equipped with operating World War II mechanized equipment, both German and American, including in particular the M4 Sherman tank. This simplified the film&#x27;s logistics tremendously. Actors like Clint Eastwood would spend time at Petrovaradin Fortress in Novi Sad during production. During filming, Sutherland had contracted spinal meningitis, exacerbated by a lack of antibiotics, which caused him to go into a life-threatening coma, but he managed to recover.

During pre-production, George Kennedy turned down the role of Big Joe, despite an offered fee of $300,000 (about $ million in ), because he did not like the role. The original script included a female role, which was removed just before filming began. Ingrid Pitt had been cast in the role (she had worked on &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; with Eastwood and Hutton for MGM the previous year). She later said she was &quot;virtually climbing on board the plane bound for Yugoslavia when word came through that my part had been cut&quot;. In the film&#x27;s climax, a nod is given to the ending of &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot;, another Eastwood film, including a similar musical score, and the addition of jangling spurs to the soundtrack.

===Vehicles and weapons===
The Tiger I tanks were actually Soviet T-34 tanks that had been modified to look like the German tank. The U.S. Sherman tanks were the M4A3E4 variant. Kelly&#x27;s platoon also drove an T19 howitzer motor carriage before it was destroyed on the hill, as well as several half-tracks. The Germans also drove a &quot;Kübelwagen&quot;.

Kelly&#x27;s men were armed with a mix of .30 caliber machine guns, Browning automatic rifles, and Thompson submachine guns, with few carbines and no M-1 rifles. Gutkowski, the unit&#x27;s sniper, was armed with a Soviet Mosin–Nagant M91/30 rifle. The German soldiers were armed almost exclusively with MP 40 submachine guns.

The U.S. plane that attacked Kelly&#x27;s group was a Yugoslavian Soko 522 painted with U.S. Army air force roundels.

===Deleted scenes===
MGM cut about 20 minutes from the film before its theatrical release. Eastwood later stated in interviews that he was very disappointed about the cuts by MGM because he felt that many of the deleted scenes not only gave depth to the characters, but also made the movie much better. Some of the deleted scenes were shown on promotional stills and described in interviews with cast and crew for Cinema Retro&#x27;s special-edition article about &quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot;:
* Oddball and his crew pack up to go across the lines to meet with Kelly and others while local village girls are running around half naked.
* The platoon encounters a group of German soldiers and naked girls swimming in a pool.
* While they wait for Oddball in the barn at night, Kelly and Big Joe talk about their disillusionment with the war and why Kelly was made a scapegoat for the attack that resulted in his demotion. Another part was deleted from this scene, in which the platoon decides they do not want to continue with the mission, and Gutkowski threatens Kelly at gunpoint, but Big Joe and Crapgame side with Kelly.
* General Colt is shown in bed with some women when he gets a call that Kelly and others have broken through the enemy lines.
* During the attack on the town, production designer John Barry had a cameo as a British airman hiding from the Germans.
* One promotional still shows Kelly finding a wounded German soldier among the ruined houses during the final attack on the town.
* Kelly, Oddball, and Big Joe discuss tactics while standing on an abandoned Tiger tank before the scene in which they negotiate with the German tank commander.
* When Kelly and the platoon drive off at the end, several soldiers yell at them that they are headed in the wrong direction.

==Musical score and soundtrack==
The film score was composed, arranged, and conducted by Lalo Schifrin, while the soundtrack album was released by MGM Records in 1970. The President of MGM Records, Mike Curb, wrote two songs for the film, with his group, the Mike Curb Congregation, performing on a number of the songs.

The soundtrack was released on LP, as well a subsequent CD featuring the LP tracks, by Chapter III Records; both were mostly re-recordings. An expanded edition of the soundtrack was released by Film Score Monthly in 2005.
The main musical theme of the film (at both beginning and end) is &quot;Burning Bridges&quot;, sung by the Mike Curb Congregation with music by Schifrin. Also, a casual rendition of the music is heard in the background near the middle of the film. The Mike Curb Congregation&#x27;s recording of &quot;Burning Bridges&quot; reached number 34 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 singles chart on March 6, 1971, but it did much better in South Africa, where it was the number-one song on the charts for five weeks ending in November 1970, and in New Zealand, where it spent two weeks at number one in March 1971. It also had a two-week stay at number one in Australia, and in Canada the song reached #23 in March 1971.

Mike Curb wrote the song &quot;All for the Love of Sunshine&quot; for the film, with the Mike Curb Congregation providing background on the recording by Hank Williams, Jr. Its inclusion in the film is sometimes considered to be an anachronism. The song became the first number-one country hit for Williams.

==Reception==
The film received mostly positive reviews. It was voted at number 34 in Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest War Films of All Time&quot;. The film earned $5.2 million in US theatrical rentals.

Film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 79% based on 24 reviews, with an average rating of 6.8/10. The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Kelly&#x27;s Heroes&quot; subverts its World War II setting with pointed satirical commentary on modern military efforts, offering an entertaining hybrid of heist caper and battlefield action&quot;.

Roger Greenspun of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the action scenes as &quot;good clean scary fun,&quot; until it goes &quot;terribly wrong&quot; when many soldiers are killed and &quot;the balance alters to the horrors of war. To acknowledge its deaths, the film has no resources above the conventional antagonistic ironies and comradely pieties of most war movies. And since its subject is not war, but burglary masquerading as war, the easy acceptance of the masquerade—which is apparently quite beyond the film&#x27;s control—becomes a denial of moral perception that depresses the mind and bewilders the imagination&quot;. Arthur D. Murphy of &quot;Variety&quot; called the film &quot;a very preposterous, very commercial World War II comedy meller, the type which combines roadshow production values and length with B-plot artistry&quot;. Gene Siskel of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and wrote that &quot;the bombing becomes tedious. One quickly realizes anytime a large object is brought into focus it will soon be incinerated. With only one dramatic problem—getting the gold—it is hard to imagine how the producers and directors could let the film run nearly two-and-one-half hours&quot;. Charles Champlin of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called the film &quot;a picture which confuses shrillness with wit and slaughter with slapstick&quot;, adding, &quot;Even the estimable Donald Sutherland can&#x27;t redeem the picture. Despite his artful efforts, his role as a long-haired hippie tank commander is so ludicrously out of time and place that it becomes hard to stomach in a film in which, elsewhere, two GIs trapped in a mine field are gunned down like cans on a stump. You can&#x27;t poison your cake and eat it too&quot;. Alan M. Kriegsman of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the film as &quot;a case of machismo gone mad,&quot; and wondered &quot;how a photographer like Gabriel Figueroa, who shot a number of Luis Bunuel&#x27;s finest films, among other things, ever got roped into such a jejune, tasteless project&quot;. &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; stated: &quot;In terms of rip-roaring, bulldozing action, this attempt to cross &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot; with &quot;Where Eagles Dare&quot; can be said to have achieved its object&quot;. However, the review went on: &quot;With all energy apparently expended on sustaining over two hours of consistently devastating explosions, pyrotechnics and demolition, little attention has been paid either to period detail (resulting in mini-skirted townswomen and the description of conditions in terms of &#x27;hung-up&#x27; and &#x27;freaked out&#x27;) or to the script, which is jolly, vituperative, and little else&quot;.

<doc id="933322" wikidata="Q2577772" url="?curid=933322" title="Wars of the Three Kingdoms">
<text>The Wars of the Three Kingdoms were a series of conflicts fought between 1639 and 1653 in the kingdoms of England, Scotland and Ireland, then separate entities in a personal union under Charles I. They include the 1639 to 1640 Bishops&#x27; Wars, the First and Second English Civil Wars, the Irish Confederate Wars, the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland and the Anglo-Scottish War of 1650–1652. They resulted in the execution of Charles I, the abolition of monarchy, and founding of the Commonwealth of England, a unitary state which controlled the British Isles until the Stuart Restoration in 1660.

Political and religious conflict between Charles I and his opponents dated to the early years of his reign. While the vast majority supported the institution of monarchy, they disagreed on who held ultimate authority. Royalists generally argued political and religious bodies were subordinate to the king, while most of their Parliamentarian opponents backed a limited form of constitutional monarchy. This was worsened by differences over religion and religious freedom. Reformed Protestants such as the English Puritans and Scottish Covenanters opposed the changes Charles tried to impose on the Protestant state churches of England and Scotland. In Ireland, the only one with a Catholic majority, the Irish Confederates wanted an end to anti-Catholic discrimination, greater self-governance, and a reversal of land grants to Protestant settlers.

The conflicts began with the Bishops&#x27; Wars of 1639–1640, when Scottish Covenanters who opposed Charles&#x27; religious reforms gained control of Scotland and briefly occupied northern England. Irish Catholics launched a rebellion in 1641, which developed into ethnic conflict with Protestant settlers. The Irish Catholic Confederation, formed to control the rebellion, held most of Ireland in the ensuing war against the Royalists, Parliamentarians, and Covenanters. Although all three agreed on the need to quell the rebellion, none trusted the other two with control of an army raised to do so. In August 1642, failure to break the resulting political deadlock sparked the First English Civil War, which pitted Royalists against both the Parliamentarians and their Covenanter allies in England and Wales.

The war in England ended when Charles surrendered to the Scots in 1646, but divisions among his opponents and his refusal to make significant political concessions caused a renewed outbreak of fighting in 1648. In the Second English Civil War, Parliamentarians again defeated the Royalists and a Covenanter faction called the Engagers. The Parliamentarian New Model Army then purged England&#x27;s parliament of those who wanted to continue negotiations with the king. The resulting Rump Parliament approved his execution in January 1649 and founded the republican Commonwealth of England. In the Treaty of Breda, the Scots agreed to restore Charles II to the English throne, but were defeated in the 1650–1652 Anglo-Scottish war. Under Oliver Cromwell, the Commonwealth conquered Ireland and most Irish Catholic lands were seized. The British Isles became a united republic ruled by Cromwell and dominated by the army. There were sporadic uprisings until the monarchy was restored in 1660.

== Nomenclature ==
The term &quot;Wars of the Three Kingdoms&quot; first appears in &quot;A Brief Chronicle of all the Chief Actions so fatally Falling out in the three Kingdoms&quot; by James Heath, published in 1662, but historian Ian Gentles argues &quot;there is no stable, agreed title for the events...which have been variously labelled the Great Rebellion, the Puritan Revolution, the English Civil War, the English Revolution and… the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.&quot; It is generally used by modern historians who see the conflicts in each state as driven by overlapping but often distinct issues, rather than as mere background to the &quot;English Civil War&quot;, while others have labelled them the &quot;British Civil Wars&quot;.

== Background ==
=== General ===
After 1541, monarchs of England styled their Irish territory as a Kingdom—replacing the Lordship of Ireland—and ruled there with the assistance of a separate Irish Parliament. Also, with the Laws in Wales Acts 1535 and 1542, Henry VIII integrated Wales more closely into the Kingdom of England. Scotland, the third separate kingdom, was governed by the House of Stuart.

By means of the English Reformation, King Henry VIII made himself head of the Protestant Church of England and outlawed Catholicism in England and Wales. In the course of the 16th century, Protestantism became intimately associated with national identity in England; Catholicism had come to be seen as the national enemy, particularly as it was embodied in the rivals France and Spain. Catholicism, however, remained the religion of most people in Ireland and for many Irish it was a symbol of native resistance to the Tudor conquest of Ireland.

In the Kingdom of Scotland, the Protestant Reformation was a popular movement led by John Knox. The Scottish Parliament legislated for a national Presbyterian church—namely the Church of Scotland or —and Mary, Queen of Scots, a Catholic, was forced to abdicate in favour of her son James VI of Scotland. James grew up under a regency disputed between Catholic and Protestant factions; when he took power, he aspired to be a &quot;universal King&quot;, favouring the English Episcopalian system of bishops appointed by the king. In 1584, he introduced bishops into the Church of Scotland, but met with vigorous opposition, and he had to concede that the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland would continue to run the church.

The personal union of the three kingdoms under one monarch came about when King James VI of Scotland succeeded Elizabeth I to the English throne in 1603, when he also became King James I of England and of Ireland. In 1625, Charles I succeeded his father and marked three main concerns regarding England and Wales: how to fund his government, how to reform the church, and how to limit the English Parliament&#x27;s interference in his rule. At that time, he showed little interest in his other two kingdoms, Scotland and Ireland.

=== Scotland ===

James VI remained Protestant, taking care to maintain his hopes of succession to the English throne. He duly became James I of England in 1603 and moved to London. James concentrated on dealing with the English court and Parliament, running Scotland through written instructions to the Privy Council of Scotland and controlling the Parliament of Scotland through the Lords of the Articles. He constrained the authority of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and stopped it from meeting, then increased the number of bishops in the Church of Scotland. In 1618, he held a General Assembly and pushed through &quot;Five Articles&quot; of Episcopalian practices, which were widely boycotted.

After his death in 1625, James was succeeded by his son Charles I, who was crowned in Holyrood Palace, Edinburgh, in 1633, with full Anglican rites. Charles was less skillful and restrained than his father; his attempts to enforce Anglican practices in the Church of Scotland created opposition which reached a flashpoint when he introduced the Anglican Book of Common Prayer. His confrontation with the Scots came to a head in 1639, when he tried and failed to coerce Scotland by military means during the Bishops&#x27; Wars.

=== England ===
Charles shared his father&#x27;s belief in the Divine Right of Kings, and his persistent assertion of this standard seriously disrupted relations between the Crown and the English Parliament. The Church of England remained dominant, but a powerful Puritan minority, represented by about one third of Parliament, began to assert themselves; their religious precepts had much in common with the Presbyterian Scots.

The English Parliament and the king had repeated disputes over taxation, military expenditure, and the role of the Parliament in government. While James I had held much the same opinions as his son regarding Royal Prerogatives, he usually had enough discretion and charisma to persuade Parliamentarians to accept his thinking. Charles had no such skill and, faced with multiple crises during 1639–1642, he failed to prevent his kingdoms from sliding into civil war. When Charles approached Parliament to pay for a campaign against the Scots, they refused. They then declared themselves to be permanently in session—the Long Parliament—and soon presented Charles with a long list of civil and religious grievances requiring his remedy before they would approve any new legislation.

=== English overseas possessions ===

During the English Civil War, the English overseas possessions became highly involved. In the Channel Islands, the island of Jersey and Castle Cornet in Guernsey supported the King until a surrender with honour in December 1651.

Although the newer, Puritan settlements in North America, notably Massachusetts, were dominated by Parliamentarians, the older colonies to the south sided with the Crown. Friction between Royalists, most of whom were Anglican, and Puritans in Maryland came to a head in the Battle of the Severn. The Virginia Company&#x27;s settlements, Bermuda and Virginia, as well as Antigua and Barbados, were conspicuous in their loyalty to the Crown. Bermuda&#x27;s Independent Puritans were expelled, settling the Bahamas under William Sayle as the Eleutheran Adventurers. Parliament passed An Act for prohibiting Trade with the Barbadoes, Virginia, Bermuda and Antego in October, 1650 that prohibited all trade with the rebellious colonies of Barbados, Antigua, Bermuda, and Virginia, and granting permission to English privateers to seize any ships belonging to merchants, including foreigners, who traded with those colonies. 

Far to the North, Bermuda&#x27;s regiment of Militia and its coastal batteries prepared to resist an invasion that never came. Built-up inside the natural defence of a nearly impassable barrier reef, to fend off the might of Spain, these defences would have been a formidable obstacle for the Parliamentary fleet sent in 1651 under the command of Admiral Sir George Ayscue to subdue the trans-Atlantic colonies, but after the fall of Barbados, the Bermudians made a separate peace that respected the internal status quo. The Parliament of Bermuda avoided the Parliament of England&#x27;s fate during The Protectorate, becoming one of the oldest continuous legislatures in the world.

Virginia&#x27;s population swelled with Cavaliers during and after the English Civil War. Even so, Virginia Puritan Richard Bennett was made Governor answering to Cromwell in 1652, followed by two more nominal &quot;Commonwealth Governors&quot;. The loyalty of Virginia&#x27;s Cavaliers to the Crown was rewarded after the 1660 Restoration of the Monarchy when Charles II dubbed it the &quot;Old Dominion&quot;.

=== Ireland ===
Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Ireland (proclaimed such in 1541 but only fully conquered for the Crown in 1603), tensions had also begun to mount. Thomas Wentworth, Charles I&#x27;s Lord Deputy of Ireland, angered Catholics by enforcing new taxes while denying them full rights as subjects; he further antagonised wealthy Irish Catholics by repeated initiatives to confiscate and transfer their lands to English colonists. Conditions became explosive in 1639 when Wentworth offered Irish Catholics some reforms in return for their raising and funding an Irish army (led by Protestant officers) to put down the Scottish rebellion. The idea of an Irish Catholic army enforcing what many saw as already tyrannical government horrified both the Scottish and the English Parliaments, which in response threatened to invade Ireland.

== Wars ==

Charles&#x27; initial failure to end the Bishops&#x27; Wars of 1639 and 1640 quickly persuaded the antagonists that force could serve them better than negotiation. The imposition of Bishops and other Anglican practices to the Scottish Kirk were opposed by most Scots, who supported a Presbyterian system of governance led by a General Assembly, and in individual churches by ministers and committees of elders. The 1638 National Covenant pledged to oppose such imposed &quot;innovations&quot;. Signatories were known as Covenanters.

In Ireland, alienated by Church of England domination and frightened by the rhetoric of the English and Scottish Parliaments, a small group of Irish conspirators launched the Irish Rebellion of 1641, ostensibly in support of the &quot;King&#x27;s Rights&quot;. The uprising featured widespread violent assaults on Protestant communities in Ireland, both Anglican and dissenter Protestants in Ulster whose practice was similar to the Scottish Kirk. In England and Scotland, rumours spread that the killings had the king&#x27;s sanction, which, for many, foreshadowed their own fate if the king&#x27;s Irish troops landed in Britain. Thus the English Parliament refused to pay for a royal army to put down the rebellion in Ireland; instead Parliament decided to raise its own armed forces. The king did likewise, rallying those Royalists (some of them members of Parliament) who believed their fortunes were best served by loyalty to the king.

The English Civil War ignited in 1642. Scottish Covenanters (as Presbyterians there called themselves) joined forces with the English Parliament in late 1643 and played a major role in the ultimate Parliamentary victory. Over the course of more than two years, the king&#x27;s forces were ground down by the efficiency of those of Parliament, including the New Model Army, backed as they were by the financial muscle of the City of London. On 5 May 1646, at Southwell, Charles I surrendered to the Scottish army besieging Newark-on-Trent. What remained of the English and Welsh Royalist armies and garrisons, surrendered piecemeal over the next few months.

Meanwhile, the rebellious Irish Catholics formed their own government—Confederate Ireland—intending to help the Royalists in return for religious toleration and political autonomy. Troops from England and Scotland fought in Ireland, and Irish Confederate troops mounted an expedition to Scotland in 1644, sparking the Scottish Civil War. There, the Royalists gained a series of victories in 1644–1645, but were crushed after the main Covenanter armies returned to Scotland upon the end of the first English Civil War.

The Scots handed Charles over to the English and returned to Scotland, the English Parliament having paid them a large sum for their expenses in the English campaign. After his surrender, Charles was approached by the Scots, the Presbyterians in the English Parliament, and the &quot;Grandees&quot; of the New Model Army, all attempting to reach an accommodation with him and among themselves which would achieve peace while preserving the crown. But now, a breach between the New Model Army and Parliament widened day by day, until the Puritans in Parliament, with allies among the Scots and the remaining Royalists, saw themselves strong enough to challenge the Army, which began the Second English Civil War.

The New Model Army vanquished the English Royalists and Parliamentarians, as well as their Scottish Engager allies. On account of his secret machinations with the Scottish Engagers, Charles was charged with treason against England. Subsequently, the Grandees and their civilian supporters failed to reconcile with the king or the Puritan majority in Parliament. The Grandees acted, and soldiers were used to purge the English Parliament of those who opposed the Army. The resultant Rump Parliament of the Long Parliament then passed enabling legislation for putting Charles I on trial for treason. He was found guilty of treason against the English commons and was executed on 30 January 1649.

After the execution of King Charles I the Rump Parliament passed a series of acts declaring that England was a republic; that the House of Commons—without the House of Lords—would sit as the legislature; and that a Council of State would act as the executive power. In the other two kingdoms the execution of Charles caused the warring parties to unite, and they recognised Charles II as king of Great Britain, France and Ireland.

To deal with the threat to the English Commonwealth posed by the two kingdoms (Ireland and Scotland), the Rump Parliament first appointed Cromwell to invade and subdue Ireland. In August 1649, he landed an English army at Rathmines shortly after the Siege of Dublin was abandoned by the Royalists following the Battle of Rathmines. Then, in late May 1650, Cromwell left one army to continue the Irish conquest and returned to England and to take command of a second English army which preemptively invaded Scotland. On 3 September 1650, he defeated the Scottish Covenanters at the Battle of Dunbar, and his forces then occupied Edinburgh and Scotland south of the River Forth. Cromwell was advancing the bulk of his army over the Forth towards Stirling; when Charles II, commanding a Scottish Royalist army, stole a march on the English commander and invaded England from his base in Scotland. Cromwell divided his forces, leaving part in Scotland to complete the conquest there, then led the rest south in pursuit of Charles II.

The Royalist army failed to gather much support from English Royalists as it moved south into England; so, instead of heading directly towards London and certain defeat, Charles aimed for Worcester hoping that Wales and the West and Midlands of England would rise against the Commonwealth. This did not happen and, one year to the day after the Battle of Dunbar, the New Model Army and the English militia regiments vanquished the last Royalist army of the English Civil War at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. It was the last and most decisive battle in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms.

== Aftermath ==
Having defeated all organised opposition, the Grandees of the Parliamentary New Model Army and their civilian supporters dominated the politics of all three nations for the next nine years (see Interregnum (1649–1660)). As for England, the Rump Parliament had already decreed it was a republic and a Commonwealth. Ireland and Scotland were now subjugated and ruled by military governors, and constituent representatives from both nations were seated in the Rump Parliament of the Protectorate, where they were dominated by Oliver Cromwell, the Lord Protector. When Cromwell died in 1658, control of the Commonwealth became unstable. In early 1660, General George Monck, commanding English occupation forces in Scotland, ordered his troops from the Coldstream barracks, marched them south into England, and seized control of London by February 1660. There he accumulated allies and agreements among the English and London establishments, including the newly constituted Convention Parliament, to which he was elected a member. Monck, first a Royalist campaigner, then a Parliamentary soldier, now contrived the Restoration of the monarchy. Monck arranged that the Convention Parliament would invite Charles II to return as king of the three realms—which was done by act of Parliament on 1 May 1660.

The Wars of the Three Kingdoms prefigured many of the changes that ultimately would shape modern Britain but, in the short term, these conflicts in fact resolved little for the kingdoms and peoples. The English Commonwealth did achieve a notable compromise between the monarchy and republic which survived destabilising problems for nearly the next two hundred years. In practice, Oliver Cromwell exercised political power through his control over Parliament&#x27;s military forces, but his legal position—and provisions for his succession—remained unclear, even after he became Lord Protector. None of the several constitutions proposed during this period was achieved. Thus the Commonwealth and Protectorate of the Parliamentarians—the wars&#x27; victors—left no significant new form of government in place after their time.

Still, in the long term, two abiding legacies of British democracy were established during this period:

* after the execution of King Charles I for high treason, no future British monarch could expect that their subjects would tolerate perceived despotism—the &quot;divine right of kings&quot; no longer existed;
* the excesses of the New Model Army, particularly those during the Rule of the Major-Generals, left an abiding mistrust of military dictators and military rule, which persists until today among peoples of British descent or national association.
English Protestants experienced religious freedom during the Interregnum, but there was none for English Catholics. During the term of their control, the Puritan partisans abolished the Church of England and the House of Lords. Cromwell denounced the Rump Parliament and dissolved it by force, but he failed to establish an acceptable alternative. Nor did he and his supporters move in the direction of popular democracy, as the more radical Parliamentarians (the Levellers) wanted.

During the Interregnum, the New Model Army occupied Ireland and Scotland. In Ireland, the new government confiscated almost all lands belonging to Irish Catholics as punishment for the rebellion of 1641; harsh Penal Laws also restricted this community. Thousands of Parliamentarian soldiers settled in Ireland on confiscated lands. The Commonwealth abolished the Parliaments of Ireland and Scotland. In theory, these countries had representation in the English Parliament, but as this body never held real powers, representation was ineffective. When Cromwell died in 1658 the Commonwealth fell apart—but without major violence. Historians record that adroit politicians of the time, especially George Monck, prevailed over the looming crisis; Monck in particular was deemed the victor &quot;sine sanguine,&quot; i.e., &quot;without blood&quot;, of the Restoration crisis. And in 1660, Charles II was restored as king of England, Scotland, and Ireland.

Under the English Restoration the political system returned to the prewar constitutional position. Although Charles II&#x27;s Declaration of Breda in April 1660 had offered reconciliation and promised a general pardon for crimes committed during the English Civil War, the new régime executed or imprisoned for life those directly involved in the regicide of Charles I. Royalists dug up Cromwell&#x27;s corpse and performed a posthumous execution. The religiously and politically motivated individuals held responsible for the wars suffered harsh repression. Scotland and Ireland regained their Parliaments, some Irish retrieved confiscated lands, and the New Model Army was disbanded. However, the issues which had caused the wars—religion, the powers of Parliament vis-á-vis the king, and the relationships between the three kingdoms—remained unresolved or, more accurately, postponed, only to re-emerge as matters disputed again and leading to the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Only later did the broader features of modern Britain, foreshadowed in the civil wars, emerge permanently; namely: a Protestant constitutional monarchy with a strong standing army under civilian control.

<text>A Fine Balance is the second novel by Rohinton Mistry, published by McClelland and Stewart in 1995. Set in &quot;an unidentified city&quot; in India, initially in 1975 and later in 1984 during the turmoil of The Emergency, the book focuses on four characters from varied backgrounds – Dina Dalal, Ishvar Darji, his nephew Omprakash Darji, and the young student Maneck Kohlah – who come together and develop a bond.

The novel won the 1995 Giller Prize. It was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1996. It was one of the only two Canadian books selected for Oprah&#x27;s Book Club, and was one of the selected books in the 2002 edition of &quot;Canada Reads&quot;, championed by actress Megan Follows. In 2014, &quot;A Fine Balance&quot; was ranked in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; as one of the 10 all-time greatest Asian novels. Emma-Lee Potter of &quot;The Independent&quot; listed it as the book with the strongest prose and character development out of 12 Indian novels &quot;that everyone needs to read.&quot;

An acclaimed stage adaptation of the novel by the Tamasha Theatre Company was produced at the Hampstead Theatre in London in 2006 and later revived in 2007.

==Reception==
Brooke Allen, writing for the Atlantic in 2002, noted that this was the first book by Mistry which went out of his familiar circle of Parsi characters and aimed at describing the whole Indian society. Whereas the main characters suffer a lot in the book, and all of them in the end lose, throughout the book they continue laughing, and the book is not perceived as tragic. She also mentions that Mistry&#x27;s use of big metaphors makes the novel reminiscent of great 19th-century authors.

On the other hand, Shankar Vedantam, writing in 1996 for the Chicago Tribune, while praising Mistry&#x27;s storytelling and love for detail, criticized his broad vision of the Indian society as too negative and complained that Mistry shows too much despair in the novel.

== Plot summary ==
The book exposes the changes in Indian society from independence in 1947 to the Emergency declared by Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Mistry was generally critical of Indira Gandhi in the book. She, however, is never referred to by name by any of the characters, and is instead called simply &quot;the Prime Minister&quot;. The characters, from diverse backgrounds, are brought together by economic forces changing India.

===Prologue: Ishvar and Om&#x27;s story===

Ishvar and Omprakash&#x27;s family is part of the Chamaar caste, who traditionally cured leather and were considered untouchable. In an attempt to break away from the restrictive caste system, Ishvar&#x27;s father apprentices his sons Ishvar and Narayan to a Muslim tailor, Ashraf Chacha, in a nearby town, and so they became tailors.

A powerful upper-caste village thug, Thakur Dharamsi, has his henchmen murder Narayan and his family for having the temerity to ask for a ballot. Ishvar and Narayan&#x27;s son Omprakash (Om) are the only two who escape the killing as they lodged with Ashraf in the nearby town. As a result of their skills, Ishvar and Om later move to the big city to get work, by then unavailable in the town near their village because a pre-made clothing shop has opened.

At the beginning of the book, the two tailors, Ishvar and Omprakash, are on their way to the flat of widow Dina Dalal via a train. While on the train, they meet a college student named Maneck Kohlah, who coincidentally is also on his way to the flat of Dina Dalal to be a boarder. Maneck, from a small mountain village in northern India, moves to the city to acquire a college certificate &quot;as a back-up&quot; in case his father&#x27;s soft drink business is no longer able to compete after the building of a highway near their village. Maneck and the two tailors become friends and go to Dina&#x27;s flat together. Dina hires Ishvar and Om for piecework, and is happy to let Maneck stay with her.

Dina, from a traditionally wealthy Parsi family, maintains tenuous independence from her brother by living in the flat of her deceased husband, who was a student.

=== Dina&#x27;s Story ===

Dina grew up in a wealthy family. Her father was a medical doctor who died when she was twelve. Her mother was withdrawn and unable to take care of Dina after her father&#x27;s death, so the job fell to Nusswan, Dina&#x27;s elder brother. Nusswan was rather abusive to Dina, forcing her to do all the cooking, cleaning, and drop out of school, and hitting her when she went against his wishes. Dina rebelled against Nusswan and his prospective suitors for her when she came of age, and found her own husband, Rustom Dalal, a chemist, at a concert hall. Nusswan and his wife Ruby were happy to let her marry Rustom and move to his flat.

Dina and Rustom lived happily for three years until Rustom died on their third wedding anniversary, after being hit by a truck while on his bicycle. Dina became a tailor under the guidance of Rustom&#x27;s surrogate parents to avoid having to move in with Nusswan. After twenty years her eyesight gave out from complicated embroidery and she was once again jobless. She eventually met a lady from a company called Au Revoir Exports - Mrs Gupta - who would buy ready-made dresses in patterns. She agrees to let Dina sew the patterns. But since Dina has very poor eyesight, she decides to hire tailors. She also decides to have a paying guest to generate more income for her rent.

The tailors rent their own sewing machines, and come to Dina&#x27;s flat each day for nearly two weeks before the first round of dresses is completed. The three get along fairly well, but Dina and Omprakash do not see eye to eye all the time. Omprakash is angry that Dina is a middle-person; he wants to sew for Au Revoir directly.

=== Maneck&#x27;s story ===

Maneck was born in a mountain town in the Kashmir Valley to loving parents, Mr and Mrs Kohlah. Maneck is drawn to the natural scenery of his homeland, straddled between the Himalayas. His father owned a grocery store that had been in the family for generations. The store sold household necessities and manufactured the locally popular soda, Kohlah Cola. Maneck spent his days going to school, helping at the store, and going on walks with his father. When he was in the fourth standard, Maneck was sent to boarding school to help his education, much to his dismay. After this, his relationship with his parents deteriorates because he does not wish to be separated from them and feels betrayed. His parents send him to a college and choose his major, refrigeration and air-conditioning.

Maneck goes to college and stays at the student hostel. Maneck becomes friends with his neighbor, Avinash, who is also the student president and who teaches him how to get rid of vermin in his room. Avinash also teaches Maneck chess and they play together often. Avinash later becomes involved in political events, for which Maneck has little interest, and their friendship is no longer a priority for Avinash. They start seeing each other quite infrequently. But when the Emergency is declared in India, political activists had to go into hiding in order to be safe, Avinash included. Maneck, after a humiliating ragging session by fellow hostel students, has his mother arrange a different living situation for him, and he moves in with Dina Dalal.

=== Effects of the Emergency ===

Dina and the tailors&#x27; business runs fairly smoothly for almost a year, but effects of the Emergency bother them often. The shantytown where the tailors live is knocked down in a government &quot;beautification&quot; program, and the residents are uncompensated and forced to move into the streets. Later Ishvar and Om are rounded up by a police beggar raid and are sold to a labor camp. After two months in the camp, they bribe their way out with the help of the Beggarmaster, a kind of pimp for beggars. Ishvar and Om are lucky and Dina decides to let them stay with her. The tailors and Dina find trouble from the landlord, because she is not supposed to be running a business from her flat. She pretends that Ishvar is her husband and Om their son; after this does not help she gets protection from the Beggarmaster.

Ishvar and Om return to their village to find a wife for Omprakash, who is now eighteen. Maneck returns home, finished with his first year in college (he has received a certificate but not a degree), but has stiff relations with his family and finds that his father&#x27;s business is failing due to the invasion of cheap commercial sodas. He takes a lucrative job in Middle Eastern Dubai to escape the conditions.

Dina being alone now, and her protector the Beggarmaster having been murdered, has no protection from the landlord who wants to break her apartment&#x27;s rent control and charge more rent, so she is evicted. Dina is forced to move back to her brother Nusswan&#x27;s house.

Omprakash and Ishvar return to their old town to find that Ashraf Chacha is an elderly man whose wife died and daughters were all married off. He gives them a place to stay while they search for marriage prospects for Om. While they walk around the village, they run into the upper-caste Thakur Dharamsi. Omprakash recognizes him and spits in his direction. Thakur in turn recognizes Om, and decides to somehow pay Om back for his disrespect of an upper caste member. When Ashraf Chacha, Ishvar, and Om are in the village, they run into herders from the Family Planning Centre. As the Centre in this city did not fill its quota, they take random people from the street and force them into a truck that drives them to the Family Planning Centre. All three are beaten into the truck and since Ashraf Chacha is so old, he is gravely injured and later dies on the street. Ishvar and Omprakash beg to escape the forced sterilization, but the vasectomy takes place. As they lie in an outside tent recovering, Thakur Dharamsi comes by and orders the doctor to give Om a castration. Ishvar&#x27;s legs become infected due to the use of unsterilized surgical equipment used for the vasectomy and must be amputated. However, Ishvar and Om have nowhere to go now that Ashraf Chacha has died. His son-in-law sells his house and they are forced to leave town.

=== Epilogue: 1984 ===
Eight years later, Maneck returns home for the second time from Dubai for his father&#x27;s funeral. Maneck is repulsed by the violence that follows after the Prime Minister&#x27;s assassination, for which Sikhs are killed. He returns home and attends the funeral, but cannot bring himself to truly miss his father, only the father of his young childhood.

While at home he reads old newspapers and learns that Avinash&#x27;s three sisters have hanged themselves, unable to bear their parents&#x27; humiliation at not being able to provide dowries for their marriages. Shocked and shaken, he decides to visit Dina in Bombay for better news. He learns from Dina the horrific lives that Ishvar and Om – one disabled and the other castrated – have led as beggars after their village visit. As Maneck leaves, he encounters Om and Ishvar on the street. The two former tailors are nearly unrecognizable because of their filth, and don&#x27;t appear to recall him. They try to attract his attention, but he doesn&#x27;t know what to say and walks on.

Maneck goes to the train station, his world shattered. He walks out on the tracks as an express train approaches the station and commits suicide by letting the train run over him.

It turns out that Om and Ishvar were on their way to visit Dina. They are still friends, and she gives them meals and money when the house is empty. Dina and the beggars discuss their lives and how Maneck has changed from a pleasant and friendly college student to a distant refrigeration specialist. Om and Ishvar leave, promising to visit after the weekend. Dina washes up their plates, and returns the plates to the cupboard, where they are to be used later by Nusswan and Ruby.

<text>Esmond Marcus David Romilly (10 June 1918 – 30 November 1941) was a British socialist, anti-fascist, and journalist, who was in turn a schoolboy rebel, a veteran with the International Brigades during the Spanish Civil War and, following the outbreak of the Second World War, an observer with the Royal Canadian Air Force. He is perhaps best remembered for his teenage elopement with his distant cousin Jessica Mitford, the second youngest of the Mitford sisters.

Born into an aristocratic family – he was a nephew of Clementine Churchill – he emerged in the 1930s as a precocious rebel against his background, openly espousing communist views at the age of fifteen. He ran away from Wellington College, and campaigned vociferously against the British public school system, by publishing a critical left wing magazine, &quot;Out of Bounds: Public Schools&#x27; Journal Against Fascism, Militarism, and Reaction&quot;, and (jointly with his brother) a memoir analysing his school experiences. At the age of eighteen, he joined the International Brigades and fought on the Madrid front during the Spanish Civil War, of which he wrote and published a vivid account.

Before departing for Spain, Romilly had largely abandoned communism (he never formally joined the party) in favour of democratic socialism. Unable to settle in London, he and his wife relocated to America in 1939. When the Second World War broke out Romilly enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force and began training as a pilot, but was discharged on medical grounds. He re-enlisted and retrained as an observer. Posted back to England, he lost his life when his plane failed to return from a bombing raid in November 1941.

==Family==
Esmond Romilly&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Sir Henry Montague Hozier (1838–1907), a professional soldier and city financier who was knighted in 1903. In 1878 he had married Lady Blanche Ogilvy (1852–1925), eldest daughter of the 10th Earl of Airlie. Four children were produced during the marriage: Katherine, born 1883, Clementine born in 1885, and twins Nellie and William born in 1888. However, the marriage was unhappy and marked by infidelities on both sides, to the extent that the precise parentage of the four children has long been doubted. Hozier appeared to have accepted that the elder daughters were probably his, but largely ignored the twins who, when the marriage ended in 1891, remained with their mother while Hozier initially took responsibility for the older girls before disappearing from the family scene altogether. The question of the twins&#x27; paternity remained unresolved. One suggested candidate was the writer Wilfrid Scawen Blunt; another was Blanche&#x27;s brother-in-law, Lord Redesdale, grandfather of the future Mitford sisters.

Nellie Hozier grew up in the family&#x27;s various homes in Seaford on the English south coast, in Dieppe in France, and finally in Berkhamsted where she attended the Girls&#x27; High School with her elder sister Clementine. In September 1908, she acted as a bridesmaid at Clementine&#x27;s wedding to Winston Churchill. At the beginning of the First World War in August 1914, Nellie volunteered as a nursing auxiliary in Belgium and was briefly a prisoner of war before repatriation at the end of the year. Back in England, she met an officer in the Scots Guards, Lieutenant-Colonel Bertram Henry Samuel Romilly, who had been seriously wounded while fighting in France. Romilly, the great-grandson of the legal reformer Sir Samuel Romilly, was from a distinguished legal family of Huguenot origin with a long tradition of public service. The couple married in December 1915; their elder son Giles Samuel Bertram Romilly was born on 19 September 1916. The second son, Esmond, followed on 10 June 1918.

==Early life==

Esmond was born at No. 15 Pimlico Road, in a busy part of London close to Victoria Station. It was a comfortable upper-middle class lifestyle in which Nellie, rather than Colonel Romilly was the principal influence. Esmond followed his elder brother to school, first at Gibbs&#x27;s Day School in nearby Sloane Street and then, from 1927, as a boarder at Newlands Preparatory School at Seaford. Holidays were divided between the family&#x27;s property in Dieppe and the Churchill cousins&#x27; home at Chartwell, and the Romilly estates at Huntington Park in Herefordshire.

Just before his ninth birthday, Esmond began at Newlands in the May 1927. It was a small school, with some forty-odd boys; Giles&#x27;s later account, in which he disguises the school as &quot;Seacliffe&quot; and alters the names of the main personnel, depicts an easygoing and undemanding establishment run by an elderly and by now largely ineffective headmaster. Matters changed when in 1930 the headmaster and others of the old guard finally retired and were replaced by more vigorous and purposeful successors. By his own account, Esmond&#x27;s academic prowess placed him at the top of the school, although in terms of behaviour he was one of the very worst. Nevertheless, by the time he left Newlands in 1932 he had managed to register a number of personal successes: Head Boy, Patrol Leader of the Otters, captain of cricket and Rugby football, winner of cups for boxing and tennis, and a prize for History.

==Wellington==

The choice of Wellington as a public school was evidently the boys&#x27; own. Giles has revealed that he and Esmond had been entered for Eton College at an early age, and were expected to go there. However, when the time came Giles pleaded to be allowed to go to Wellington instead: &quot;[It] was associated with soldiers and we were both very military&quot;. Their wishes were granted; Giles began at Wellington in January 1930, and Esmond followed in September 1931.

===Reluctant conformist===
Wellington College had been founded by national subscription as a memorial to the first Duke, who had died in 1852. It had opened in 1859, primarily as a military orphanage for the sons of deceased officers, but by the 1920s had evolved into a public school of a highly reactionary character. T. C. Worsley, who taught there in the early 1930s, described it as &quot;philistine to a degree almost unimaginable in a great school&quot;, and &quot;[I]n every possible way ... thirty, forty, fifty years behind the times&quot;. Its style was of absolute conformity, based on what Kevin Ingram, Esmond&#x27;s biographer, calls a &quot;doctrine of suppression&quot;; a tight curriculum that accounted for every moment of the boys&#x27; time, and a &quot;dormitory&quot; system that placed boys in small exclusive units that kept them apart from the rest of the school in every activity outside the classroom. Esmond would later write of his &quot;hatred&quot; at seeing &quot;the same faces opposite one every day ... always there was the same monotonous conversation&quot;.

In her biographical study, Meredith Whitford describes the adolescent Esmond as &quot;conceited, bumptious, argumentative, spoilt, ambitious for authority, a grubby, unhandy child, extroverted and lazy and too intelligent for his surroundings&quot;. However, there is little evidence of rebellion on Esmond&#x27;s part during his first two years at Wellington. In general, he wrote, his politics were of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; variety. He describes himself since his Newlands days as a romantic Tory, a Jacobite (supporter of the Stuart claim to the British throne), and after meeting Sir Oswald Mosley in October 1931 was briefly attracted to the latter&#x27;s New Party – he recalls distributing some New Party literature among his fellow-Wellingtonians. Esmond also records a violent quarrel that arose over his decorating his bed with a tartan rug as an ostentatious display of his Jacobitism, but such incidents were rare. In the main he had, according to Whitworth, succumbed to conformity, &quot;abandon[ing] the romantic calls of the past for the strident demands of the present&quot;. At the end of his first year, he was awarded a prize – &quot;Middle School Recitation, Third Block&quot; – which he received on Speech Day from the hands of the Duke of Connaught.

===Rebel===
When, in the summer of 1932, Giles announced his conversion to Bolshevism, Esmond records his family&#x27;s shocked reaction (and &quot;Uncle Winston&quot;&#x27;s considerable amusement), but at the time, he took no specific steps to embrace communism as a personal creed. That followed some nine months later, during the 1933 Easter holidays spent as usual in Dieppe. Before leaving for France, Esmond had acquired a copy of the &quot;Daily Worker&quot;, and had arranged for further copies to be delivered to Dieppe. Through this clandestine reading, Esmond made contact with groups of communists in London, and arranged to meet them on his return to England. The meetings duly took place, and Esmond was impressed by them, although his ideas were far from clearly formed: &quot;When I went back to Wellington for the summer term, I took with me an odd collection of ideas&quot;. Among other things, like others at the time he tended to confuse communism with pacifism. However, he was determined to convert &quot;at least 20 Wellingtonians&quot; to the new creed.

During the following months Esmond engaged in various acts of somewhat incoherent rebellion. He joined a &quot;peace correspondence&quot; group, until it was clear that his young, female correspondent was more interested in a sexual than a political relationship. His first concrete act against the Wellington establishment came on his 15th birthday, 10 June 1933, when he refused to sign up for the Officers Training Corps, an action which to his disappointment incurred only mild disapproval and which, after consultation with his parents was allowed to stand. He had written a fiery letter to a left-wing student magazine, the &quot;Student Vanguard&quot;, in which he asserted that &quot;Every boy is compelled to join the Corps at the age of fifteen and must stay there until he leaves&quot;, a patently untrue statement for which he was required to provide a written apology.

Towards the end of the 1933 summer term, Esmond took advantage of a school holiday to visit the Parton Street bookshop in West London, where he had arranged to meet one of his communist correspondents. The Parton Street premises, part bookshop, part circulating library, partly a centre for radical intellectuals and poets, was run on a philanthropic basis by David Archer, a Cambridge graduate and former Wellingtonian with whom Esmond struck an immediate rapport. Among the habitués were the poets John Cornford, Stephen Spender and David Gascoyne, the budding actor Alec Guinness, and the soldier-diplomat and writer T. E. Lawrence. The Parton Street Press was Dylan Thomas&#x27;s first publisher. Whatever the outcome of the arranged meeting, Esmond had, as Ingram remarks, found a new spiritual home in which to revive his flagging spirits. His mood was further improved at the start of the summer vacation when he attended a communist demonstration at Deptford.

Returning to Wellington for the 1933 autumn term, Esmond became the leader of a small group of followers, none of whom he found particularly inspiring. On 15 October, at the Wellington Debating Society, he proposed the motion that &quot;In the opinion of this house the political freedom of women is a sign of a civilized society&quot;. Giles led for the opposition, and the motion was defeated by 29 votes to 9. A month later he was involved in perhaps his most direct act of rebellion against the College ethos, when in advance of the Armistice Day commemorations he distributed a consignment of badges from the Anti-War Movement, to be worn in addition to the venerated poppy. From the same organisation he acquired anti-war leaflets which he and a confederate inserted into the hymn-books from which the hymn O Valiant Hearts would be sung at the Armistice service. Esmond was again forced to apologise, this time under direct threat of expulsion, and to provide an undertaking that nothing similar would occur in the future.

Although often at odds with each other, the Romilly brothers were capable of working together. In January 1934, after Esmond had addressed a meeting of the Federation of Student Societies (a university-based Marxist organisation that co-ordinated left-wing student activities), the brothers decided to launch a new magazine, &quot;Out of Bounds (&quot;Against Reaction in Public Schools&quot;)&quot;. A manifesto was prepared and circulated among interested parties: the first issue would be in March 1934, it would appear twice termly (cost one shilling); among the problems the first issue would discuss was &quot;the positive and blatant use of the public schools as a weapon in the cause of reaction&quot;. Although these initial steps were carried out without undue publicity, by the end of January the story had broken in the right-wing press, giving rise to headlines such as &quot;Red Menace in Public Schools&quot; and &quot;Officer&#x27;s Son Sponsors Extremist Journal&quot;. The headmaster of Wellington, F. B. Malim, who had first given a provisional consent to the project, now demanded that the brothers abandon their activities. Esmond&#x27;s solution was simple; rather than give up the project he would run away from the school.

===&quot;Out of Bounds&quot;===
The fugitive Romilly found his way to Parton Street and set up his headquarters there, amid considerable press interest and speculation: &quot;Mr Churchill&#x27;s Nephew Vanishes&quot; was a typical headline. The &quot;Sunday Express&quot; paid Romilly seven guineas for his story (£7.35, equivalent to nearly £500 in 2017 terms). Archer agreed to pay him a wage of £1 a week to help in the shop; on these sparse resources Romilly set about preparing the first issue of &quot;Out of Bounds&quot;.

The first issue was published on 25 March 1934. Romilly had been assiduous in developing a distribution network &quot;in every cloister and dormitory he could reach&quot;, and had acquired a wide selection of contributions, so that the magazine ran to 35 pages. His own contributions included a fiery editorial, an article on the arms race and a rebuttal of a defence of fascism supplied from Oundle School. There were poems, some literary criticism, a letters page, an article on conditions in girls&#x27; schools, and some humorous send-ups of public school life. Despite the relatively moderate overall tone, the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; denounced the magazine as a &quot;Reds&#x27; New Attack&quot; and quoted from the editorial: &quot;We shall infuriate every schoolmaster over 30 (and some under) throughout England&quot;.

On 14 April the organisation of &quot;Out of Bounds&quot; was formalised when a meeting of some 16 delegates from a range of schools appointed a permanent editorial board under Romilly&#x27;s chairmanship. Next day this board marched to Hyde Park, as part of a demonstration against the National Government&#x27;s budget policy, under a banner denouncing the &quot;National Government of Hunger, Fascism and War&quot;. This was duly reported in the press, ever eager to record the doings of Mr Churchill&#x27;s nephew. On 7 June, in the company of his new acolyte Philip Toynbee from Rugby School, Romilly attended a large Blackshirts rally at London&#x27;s Olympia, from which they were roughly ejected, Toynbee sustaining mild injuries. By this time, Romilly was becoming disenchanted with the Parton Street ambience, and was seeking a rapprochement with his family from whom he had been estranged since his flight from Wellington. In this mood he agreed to return to school, not to Wellington but to the progressive, coeducational school Bedales. He continued his work with &quot;Out of Bounds&quot;, the second edition of which appeared on 2 July. Romilly began at Bedales on 9 June and spent the remainder of the summer term there. In his letters home he professed to like the school, but the feeling was not reciprocated towards him. &quot;This is a boy who can contribute nothing to this school and to whom this school can contribute nothing&quot;, was the headmaster&#x27;s bleak assessment when Romilly departed from the school at the end of July.

Romilly spent the summer and autumn months quietly, in London, subsisting on a small allowance from his father. He had largely lost interest in the magazine, although he continued to contribute; the third issue appeared in November without creating a stir, much of it consisting of what Ingram calls tame repetition. He began a new project, with his brother Giles, in the form of a book in which the pair recounted and analysed their experiences of school. Much of the 1934–35 winter was spent by Romilly in writing his part of the combined work, which Hamish Hamilton agreed to publish. This period of responsible endeavour was interrupted in late December 1934 by a drunken incident which resulted in Romilly&#x27;s arrest and detention in a remand home for several weeks, from which he was eventually released on a year&#x27;s probation.

The book &quot;Out of Bounds: The Education of Giles Romilly and Esmond Romilly&quot; was published in June 1935, to a generally favourable reception, and sold well enough to run to a second edition. Raymond Mortimer in the &quot;New Statesman&quot; found the book &quot;candid and surprisingly fair&quot;; even the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; conceded that the young authors had literary ability. &quot;The Observer&quot;″s books critic remarked that the book might tell the true story, rather than the exaggerated accounts evident from the magazine – which the brothers opportunistically brought out in a fourth and final edition to coincide with the book&#x27;s publication. The centrepiece of this last issue was a frank article on masturbation, supposedly contributed by a doctor.

==Interlude==
Romilly used his share of the publisher&#x27;s advance to open a public schools news agency, &quot;Educational News and Features&quot;, but the venture soon collapsed. He then took a job selling silk stockings. His political convictions had meanwhile softened, and he joined the Labour Party. By December 1935 he was selling advertising space on commission, and in March 1936 he took a full-time job as advertising manager of World Film News.

==Spain==
The Spanish Civil War began in July 1936. By October, Romilly was ready to join the fight. He gave his employers a week&#x27;s notice and, on 19 October 1936, took the boat train to Dieppe. Here he acquired a bicycle and set out for Marseilles. The journey through France took him ten days during which he managed to lose both his passport and his money. He arrived in Marseilles penniless but found a charity willing to support him while he looked for a ship to take him to Spain. After five days, he obtained a passage to Valencia on SS &quot;Mar Caspio&quot;.

From Valencia, Romilly and other volunteers were entrained to Albacete, the gathering point where the International Brigades were being organised. For his first few days at the base, Romilly was aligned with a group of Russian emigrés, but within a few days, further shipments from the &quot;Maro Caspio&quot; had brought a number of English volunteers to the camp. Romilly became part of the group under the leadership of Lorrimer Birch, a Cambridge-educated scientist who, in Romilly&#x27;s later assessment showed true qualities of leadership and organisation: &quot;a communist first of all, but determined that his communism shouldn&#x27;t interfere with his fairness of judgement&quot;.

On 6 November, news reached Albacete that the rebel Nationalist forces had begun their assault on Madrid. Some accounts implied that the capital was on the verge of falling to the rebels. The English group were attached to the Thaelmann Battalion of the XII Brigade, which on 10 November moved to Chinchón, about 50 kilometres south-east of the capital. Two days later Romilly&#x27;s unit was sent to defend the Madrid-Valencia highway near Vaciamadrid, close to the outskirts of the city. During the next few days Romilly had his first experience under fire in an abortive attack on a supposed rebel-held fortress at Cerro de los Angeles. The action was inconclusive, and on 15 November, the unit returned to Chinchón.

After a brief rest, the XII Brigade was ordered to the University City of Madrid, the city&#x27;s university campus, which had fallen into rebel hands. For most of the next few weeks, Romilly and the English group were involved in heavy fighting on the edges of the campus, much of it concentrated around a farm complex known as the White House. The buildings passed several times between Republican and Nationalist forces. During a brief rest period in Chinchón, the group was visited by English journalists, who reported Romilly&#x27;s presence, his family&#x27;s first news of his whereabouts since his departure in October.

In mid-December, Romilly&#x27;s unit was sent to Boadilla del Monte, where a strong rebel offensive was under way. In the ensuing battle, nearly all of Romilly&#x27;s British companions, including Birch, were killed. Romilly survived the fighting, but contracted dysentery and was invalided back to England early in January 1937.

==Elopement==
At the end of January 1937, while he was recuperating from his Spanish experiences at the home of his distant cousin Dorothy Althusen (widow of the Conservative MP Augustus Henry Eden Allhusen), Romilly met his second cousin Jessica Mitford. According to Mary Lovell&#x27;s account, Esmond had learned from his brother Giles that Jessica was interested in going to Spain and suggested to Dorothy that the &quot;pink&quot; Mitford sister would be a suitable house guest. She was the second-youngest of the renowned Mitford sisters, daughters of the 2nd Baron Redesdale. Despite the family relationship, the two had not previously met, but according to Mitford&#x27;s own account, &quot;I had been in love with Esmond for years, ever since I first heard of him&quot;. She was herself a rebel against the restrictions of her upbringing and family life and hoped that Romilly would help her get to Spain. The two found an instant rapport and began immediately to make plans. Romilly had acquired a press card and a contract from the &quot;News Chronicle&quot; to report on the war and had thus obtained a visa. The plan was that Mitford would travel as his secretary. Mitford had for years accumulated her small savings in what she called her &quot;Running-away account&quot;, which now stood at around £50 (). That, Romilly announced, would make things much easier. 

As a cover story to explain her departure, Mitford invented an invitation to visit friends in Austria. The pair departed from England on 8 February. They reached Bayonne, on the French-Spanish border, and after a tense wait for Mitford&#x27;s visa, they took a cargo boat to Bilbao.

By then, their families had discovered the subterfuge and were aware of the fugitive couple&#x27;s whereabouts and of their intention to marry. The families, bitterly opposed to the union, hoped to avoid press attention, but Romilly opportunistically exploited press interest by selling his story through an intermediary. Headlines appeared in the &quot;Daily Express&quot; on 1 March 1937 announcing, &quot;Peer&#x27;s Daughter Elopes to Spain&quot;. At the same time, the Redesdale family used all their connections to try to bring Jessica home, including the connivance of the British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden and the use of a naval warship to dispatch the eldest Mitford sister, Nancy, to Bayonne. The couple were initially intransigent, but threatened with the loss of their Spanish visas, they agreed to return to Bayonne, where they were met by Nancy. The elder sister&#x27;s remonstrances were unavailing, as was a later visit by Lady Redesdale. The couple were married in a civil ceremony in Bayonne on 18 May 1937. The press reported it as &quot;the wedding that even a destroyer could not stop&quot;. Meanwhile, there had been a degree of rapprochement with both families and so both Lady Redesdale and Nellie Romilly attended the ceremony.

==London==
The couple remained in Bayonne since Romilly hoped to return to Spain to report on the war. Thwarted by his failure to obtain a visa, he worked on &quot;Boadilla&quot;, an account of his experiences fighting with the English brigades. He secured a publisher&#x27;s advance of £50, which he rapidly lost through an unwise gambling scheme. Mitford was now several months pregnant, and they decided to return to London to a flat in Rotherhithe in the East End that a friend had made available. The ground floor of the building operated as a casino, and Romilly worked there as a croupier before landing a more regular job as a copywriter with the advertising firm Graham &amp; Gillies.

&quot;Boadilla&quot; was published in the autumn of 1937, but initial sales were poor. In December, a baby daughter named Julia Decca was born but failed to survive a measles epidemic that broke out in the spring of 1938. The baby died on 28 May. The stricken couple abandoned their London life and fled to Corsica, where they spent the summer in a cheap hotel and eked out their savings. In September, they returned to London, to a room in the Marble Arch area, but could not settle into a regular life. The opportunity to escape came in the form of an windfall from a Mitford trust fund, which on Mitford&#x27;s twenty-first birthday provided a sum of £100: enough, they decided, to purchase cheap tickets for America with some to spare. On 18 February 1939, after throwing a farewell party for their friends, the pair left England for good, aboard the SS &quot;Aurania&quot;, their destination being New York.

===America, war and disappearance===
In New York, the Romillys settled in a small Greenwich Village apartment. Mitford found a job in a New York fashion house, and Romilly attempted without success to work as a freelance journalist. Eventually, he found a position in an advertising firm, Topping &amp; Lloyd; the post, a well-paid sinecure, lasted until August 1939 and enabled the couple to acquire a second-hand car and sufficient capital to embark on a tour of America. In Washington, DC, Romilly signed a contract with &quot;The Washington Post&quot; to provide a series of articles recounting their adventures under the title &quot;Baby Bluebloods in Hobohemia&quot;. The winter of 1939–1940 was spent in Miami, where Romilly borrowed $1,000 to acquire the licence to run the Roma bar. The plan was to continue the tour in the spring, westward, Romilly hoped to find work on a ranch before he moved to Hollywood and finally Chicago. However, by May 1940, the war news from Europe (the Second World War had broken out in September 1939) was serious enough for the Romillys to abandon their tour and return to Washington, where Romilly volunteered for service with the Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF).

Romilly departed for Canada to begin training, first at Toronto and later at Regina, Saskatchewan, while Mitford remained in Washington, pregnant with her second child (a daughter, Constancia, was born on 9 February 1941). Meanwhile, Romilly&#x27;s training did not run smoothly. In November 1940 he was disqualified from aircrew duties because of a previously-undetected radical mastoidectomy and discharged from the RCAF. However, he obtained an immediate reinstatement to train as an air observer at Malton, Ontario. In the summer of 1941, on the completion of his training, he was posted to England, where he was attached to No. 58 Squadron RAF as a navigator with the rank of pilot officer. On 30 November 1941, while participating in a raid on Hamburg, Romilly&#x27;s aircraft failed to return and was lost over the North Sea with all on board. Air-sea rescue operations begun out the following morning could find no trace of the craft or any survivors, and on 3 December, the search was abandoned. Mitford was notified by telegram on 1 December. Romilly is commemorated on the Runnymede Memorial.

<doc id="933349" wikidata="Q2412584" url="?curid=933349" title="The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra">
<text>The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra is a 2001 American independent science-fiction parody film directed by Larry Blamire. The film is a spoof of B movies released during the 1950s. The film was videotaped on a budget of less than US$100,000, and was converted to black-and-white film in post-production. Larry Blamire acted in and directed the film, wrote its screenplay, and provided the voice of the film&#x27;s titular Skeleton. Jennifer Blaire, who performs Animala, is Blamire&#x27;s wife.

The film, which was shot at Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles, California, premiered at the Mill Valley Film Festival on October 8, 2001 and received a limited release in theatres on March 12, 2004.

==Plot==
In 1961, scientist Dr. Paul Armstrong (Larry Blamire) and his wife Betty (Fay Masterson) drive into the mountains. Dr. Armstrong is searching for a meteorite that has fallen in the nearby woods, suspected to contain the rare element atmosphereum. Another scientist in the area, Dr. Roger Fleming (Brian Howe) questions Ranger Brad (Dan Conroy) about Cadavra Cave, a site rumored to contain a &quot;Lost Skeleton&quot;.

That evening, both the Armstrongs and Dr. Fleming observe another falling meteor. A short time later a farmer (Robert Deveau), encountered by the Armstrongs on their way to the cabin, is mutilated by a mysterious beast. The second meteorite is actually a spaceship carrying two aliens. Kro-Bar (Andrew Parks) and Lattis (Susan McConnell) are from the planet Marva and are now stranded on Earth, in need of the element atmosphereum to repair their powerless ship. The ship&#x27;s pet mutant (Darren Reed) escapes from its cage while they are distracted.

The next day, Dr. Roger Fleming finds Cadavra Cave and locates the Lost Skeleton. The Skeleton commands Fleming to bring atmosphereum to resurrect him. Meanwhile, Dr. Armstrong and Betty venture into the woods, discovering the meteorite just outside Cadavra Cave. Dr. Fleming overhears them and plots to steal the meteorite from the pair. Kro-Bar and Lattis also journey into the woods, locating the cabin with the meteorite. Using a device called the &quot;transmutatron,&quot; they disguise themselves as &quot;Earth people&quot; and clumsily manage to talk their way into the cabin, having been mistaken for the property owners. Not long after they arrive, Dr. Fleming discovers the aliens&#x27; transmutatron, left outside the cabin since it would ruin their disguise. He uses it to create an ally for himself, the alluring Animala (Jennifer Blaire), created from four different animals. After briefly teaching Animala the basics of human interaction, he leads her to the cabin and convinces the Armstrongs to invite him inside.

Soon it becomes clear to Lattis and Kro-Bar (calling themselves &quot;Turgaso&quot; and &quot;Bammin&quot; on Earth in an effort to pass as earth humans) that Fleming knows their secret. They soon cooperate in stealing the meteorite, after Betty is psychically attacked by the Skeleton and Dr. Armstrong is entranced by Animala&#x27;s dancing. The evil scientist tricks the pair, however, and the Skeleton uses his mind powers to freeze the aliens in their tracks once Dr. Fleming has the meteorite. Dr. Fleming and Animala soon use the atmosphereum to resurrect the Skeleton. Meanwhile, Betty, waiting for Dr. Armstrong to come back, encounters the Mutant, who appears to fall in love with her, but she is terrified and faints.

While Fleming and Animala are resurrecting the skeleton, Armstrong arrives and encounters the unfrozen aliens. They also find Betty, who has realized that the mutant has some sort of feelings for her. After bonding over a meal, the four head off to try to obtain the meteorite before it can be used to resurrect the skeleton, but they are attacked by the Mutant. Dr. Armstrong is injured in the fight, but realizes that the monster does not want to harm Betty. Armstrong and his wife return to the cabin to recover, while the aliens try to stop Fleming on their own. However, they are captured by the skeleton&#x27;s mind powers, and forced to dance by his psychic powers.

The Skeleton uses his mental powers to force Lattis into becoming his bride, much to Kro-Bar&#x27;s chagrin. The Skeleton mocks everyone, including Fleming, but keeps them in line with his telepathy. When Armstrong sees what is going on, he comes up with a plan to get Betty to lure the Mutant to the wedding to disrupt it. After getting the Mutant to follow them, Armstrong and Betty attack Fleming and Animala. During the fight, the Skeleton kills Fleming after the latter is beaten by Armstrong. The Mutant then arrives at the wedding and attacks the Skeleton, whose powers do not affect beings with as simple minds as the Mutant. They instead fight until the Skeleton is thrown over a cliff, smashing apart on impact. The mutant then succumbs to its injuries and dies. Animala is turned back into the animals she originally was via the transmutatron. The alien and human couples spout traditional homilies about different species working together in harmony, then go to retrieve the atmosphereum.

==Cast==
* Larry Blamire as Dr. Paul Armstrong
* Fay Masterson as Betty Armstrong
* Andrew Parks as Kro-Bar/Bammin
* Susan McConnell as Lattis/Turgaso
* Brian Howe as Dr. Roger Fleming
* Jennifer Blaire as Animala
* Dan Conroy as Ranger Brad
* Robert Deveau as the Farmer
* Darrin Reed as the Mutant

==Production==
It was partly filmed in Bronson Canyon, a legendary B-movie location. Actors were instructed to give wooden performances to help with the intentional cheesiness of the film. In total, it took five days to write, and just over ten days to film.

==Release==
The film premiered at the Mill Valley Film Festival in Mill Valley, California on October 8, 2001. Acquired by Sony Pictures&#x27; Michael Schlesinger after a screening at the American Cinematheque in Hollywood, the film was released in theaters in February 2004, and on DVD in June 2004.

==Reception==
&quot;The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra&quot; has received mixed reviews. The film has a rating of 54% on review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, based on 69 critic reviews. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Lost Skeleton is clever at spoofing B-movies, but the joke isn&#x27;t sustainable for its running time.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 45% based on 23 critic reviews, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Dave Kehr of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it &quot;a gray, unfunny parody of 1950&#x27;s science fiction films&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film 1-and-a-half out of 4 stars, writing that &quot;&#x27;The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra&#x27; has been made by people who are trying to be bad, which by definition reveals that they are playing beneath their ability&quot;. Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that &quot;Once the initial joke wears off, &quot;Skeleton&quot; is a dull slog that even the miracle process of &#x27;Skeletorama&#x27; can&#x27;t set right&quot;.

Dennis Harvey of &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film &quot;takes true trash cinema devotion to satirize the clunky visuals, banal dialogue, logic gaps and pseudoscientific silliness of a bygone era’s schlockiest obscurities quite so accurately, complete with one-beat-tardy editorial rhythms&quot;. Ed Gonzales and Jeremiah Kipp, writing for &quot;Slant Magazine&quot;, said that the &quot;perilously low budget plays to &quot;Lost Skeleton&quot;&#x27;s advantage, and the scant 90-minute running time assures that it doesn’t wear out its welcome&quot;.

==Sequels==

A sequel, &quot;The Lost Skeleton Returns Again&quot;, was filmed in March 2008, again written and directed by Blamire, produced by Mark Allen Stuart, and featuring virtually all of the original cast (though three actors whose characters were killed in the original are back in different roles), as well as several actors who appeared in Blamire&#x27;s subsequent &quot;Trail of the Screaming Forehead&quot;. However, unlike the first film, it does not repeat the &quot;ultra-cheap independent&quot; feel, but is intended to look more like a studio B-picture from the same era, such as those produced by Sam Katzman or Edward Small. It had its world premiere at the Mill Valley Film Festival October 4, 2008 and its Los Angeles premiere November 9 at the Egyptian Theatre. The film began its theatrical run at the Coolidge Corner in Boston on May 21, 2010, and was released on DVD by Shout! Factory on August 17, 2010, as was another Blamire film, &quot;Dark and Stormy Night&quot;.

In January 2012, Blamire announced on his Facebook page that a third picture, &quot;The Lost Skeleton Walks Among Us&quot;, was in development. In November 2012, a Dread Central article by Sean Decker announced that Blamire was teaming with famed monster-maker Cleve Hall to make the picture in 2013, but it was delayed by a book project. Early in 2014, Blamire posted on his Facebook page that production was now targeted for that year, and a Kickstarter campaign was begun in June. The funding goal was not met (as per the project&#x27;s Kickstarter page), and the project remains unrealized as of 2024.

<text>Charles Henry &quot;Chinski&quot; Root (March 17, 1899 – November 5, 1970) was an American Major League Baseball pitcher with the St. Louis Browns and the Chicago Cubs between 1923 and 1941. Root batted and threw right-handed. He holds the club record for games, innings pitched, and career wins with 201.

==Early life==
Born on Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day, Root was the eighth of nine children born to Jacob and Mary Root in Middletown, Ohio. He left school at 13 due to being reprimanded by his teacher for his behavior. His father envisioned his son working in the local steel mill; although he did not get in his son&#x27;s interest in baseball, he demanded that his son find a job to help the family. Root had numerous jobs, such as driver of a grocery wagon, working in a box factory, and being a pattern-maker at the Armco mill. By the time he was twenty, he was playing semipro ball with the Middletown Eagles, making $5 for each game ($ in current dollar terms) on Sundays before leaving for the Hamilton Engine Works, who offered $35 a game ($ in current dollar terms) and a job for $50 a week ($ in current dollar terms). Carl Weilman of the St. Louis Browns noticed his play (in which he led them to the Southern Ohio industrial league championship) and signed him to a contract. Root reported to spring training camp for the Browns in Bogalusa, Louisiana in 1921.

==Career==
Root began his professional career on April 18, 1923 with the St. Louis Browns. Root pitched in relief for the final inning against the Detroit Tigers, striking out one while allowing no hits. Root made his first career start on July 4 for the second game of a double-header against the Chicago White Sox. He lasted two innings while allowing two runs on five hits with one strikeout, receiving the loss as the White Sox prevailed 3–1. He would start just one more game that year while appearing in 27 total games, finishing 15 of them while having 60 innings of work, going 0–4 with a 5.70 ERA. He had 27 strikeouts and 18 walks. 

Root was traded after the 1923 season by manager George Sisler along Cedric Durst, Rasty Wright, and Josh Billings to the Los Angeles Angels in the Pacific Coast League for George Lyons and Tony Rego. In his season with the Angels, he won 21 games in 322 innings. His contract was purchased by the Cubs after the season for $30,000 and two players. He was sent back to the Angels for more seasoning after spring training with the team, winning 25 games with the Angels. In 1926, he began play with the Cubs. In 42 games for the team (starting in 32 of them), he went 18–17 while throwing 21 complete games with two saves and two shutouts in 271 innings of work. He had 62 walks and 127 strikeouts, beginning six consecutive seasons with over a hundred strikeouts. He finished 16th in the MVP voting that year. 

For 1927, Root was selected to pitch the Opening Day game for the Cubs, pitching against the St. Louis Cardinals at Wrigley Field, facing future Hall of Fame inductee Grover Cleveland Alexander. Root pitched a complete game while allowing one run on seven hits while having seven strikeouts and five walks as the Cubs rolled over the Cardinals 10–1. That year, he went 26–15 with a 3.76 ERA in 48 games and 309 innings, both career highs. Although he allowed 117 walks, he had 145 strikeouts in the 1,316 batters he faced, all career highs. Fielding-wise, he had six putouts, 49 assists, two errors and two double plays for a .965 fielding percentage. He led the league in wins, games, and innings while finishing in the top ten in hits per 9 innings (8.621, 6th), strikeouts per 9 innings (4.223, 5th), strikeouts (2nd) and shutouts (4, 2nd). Root finished fourth in the MVP voting that year, receiving 46 vote points as Paul Waner received the award with 72. He regressed the following year, going 14–18 with a 3.57 ERA and two saves in 40 games and 237 innings pitched. He had 73 walks with 122 strikeouts. 

In 1929, Root pitched in 43 games and 272 innings while having a 19–6 record and a 3.47 ERA. He had 83 walks along with 124 strikeouts. That year the Cubs won the National League pennant, and Root started Game 1 and Game 4 of the World Series against the Philadelphia Athletics. In the first game, he faced off against Howard Ehmke. Root was scoreless until the seventh inning, where Jimmie Foxx hit a home run off him to give the Athletics their first run. Root was replaced by Guy Bush for the eighth inning, but Root (seven innings, three hits) was charged with the 3–1 loss. Root started the pivotal fourth game of the Series, facing off against Jack Quinn. He was clean of runs until the seventh inning, where he was taken out for Art Nehf after getting only one out on six runs as the Cubs tried to preserve a 8–6 lead. However, the two following Cubs pitchers allowed four runs to score as the A&#x27;s completed their comeback and ultimately won the game 10–8 along with the Series a game later. 

Root played mostly to form for 1932. It was the first year the Cubs wore numbers on their jerseys; Root wore 12 (he would wear three different jersey numbers over the following years). In 39 games appeared, he went 15–10 with a 3.58 ERA and three saves in 216 innings pitched. He had 96 strikeouts with 55 walks (both being lows for Root in his career thus far). The team rallied from a sluggish 53–46 record under Rogers Hornsby to winning 37 of the next 55 games under Charlie Grimm to win the NL pennant. Root appeared in Game 3 of the World Series on October 1 against the New York Yankees. In 4 innings, he allowed six hits and runs as the Cubs lost 7–5. He threw the pitch that Babe Ruth allegedly predicted he would hit into the seats in the 1932 World Series at Wrigley Field in Chicago (see: Babe Ruth&#x27;s called shot). Root, however, insisted that Ruth had not pointed to the bleachers and the account of the supposed shot is disputed.
Root&#x27;s baseball nickname, &quot;Chinski,&quot; was bestowed by his longtime teammate and manager, Charlie Grimm. 
Root, wearing No. 17 (for which he would wear for the remaining years of his career) returned to form in 1935, going 15–8 with a 3.08 ERA in 38 games and 201 innings pitched. He had 94 strikeouts and 47 walks. The Cubs memorably won the league pennant that season, winning 21 consecutive games from September 4 to the 28th to finish 100–54 and win their third pennant in six years. Root appeared in Game 2 and 4 of the World Series, starting in the former while closing the last two innings of the latter. In Game 2, he was knocked out of the game before finishing an inning, allowing four hits and four runs on four batters faced as the Cubs lost 8–3, with Root being charged with the loss. In Game 4, he threw the eighth and ninth inning, allowing one hit with no runs, two strikeouts, and one walk although the Cubs lost 2–1; the team lost the Series two days later.

Root did not have as much as success in 1938. He appeared in 44 games while starting 11 of them and finishing 20 of them, having 9 saves while going 8-7 with a 2.86 ERA and pitching 160 innings. He had 70 strikeouts and 30 walks. For the fourth time in nine years, the Cubs rallied to win the league pennant, rallying behind player-manager Gabby Hartnett. On September 28, the Cubs played the Pittsburgh Pirates for possession of first place in the standings, trailing by half a game. Root stepped in for Bill Lee in the ninth inning, allowing one hit with no runs to keep the score at 5 even in the last scheduled inning to play before darkness was set to hit Wrigley Field, which would mean a re-playing of the game the following day. In the bottom of the inning, with two outs, Hartnett hit a dramatic home run to win the game for the team and elevate them to first place in the league (with Root receiving credit for the win). Four days later, the Cubs clinched the pennant. In the World Series that year, he appeared in the fourth and final game against the Yankees, pitching the fourth, fifth, and sixth inning. He allowed three hits with one run (a home run to Tommy Henrich) as the Cubs lost 8-3. In six postseason starts spread out over nine years, Root pitched a total of 22 innings while allowing 26 hits, 18 runs with 15 strikeouts and six walks while losing three of the decisions and winning none.
For his final year in 1941, Root went 8–7 with a 5.40 ERA (a career high) while pitching in 19 games, having six complete games in 106 innings of work. He allowed more hits and runs than the year before despite a reduced workload while having 46 strikeouts and 37 walks. In his final game on September 2, 1941, he pitched a complete game against the Cincinnati Reds, allowing one run on five hits while striking out and walking five batters in a 3–1 win. 

Relative to his pitching counterparts, Root put up stellar stats at the plate during his 17-year major league career, compiling a .180 batting average (196-for-1086) with 86 runs, 11 home runs and 93 RBI. He also provided a sound presence on the defensive side, recording a .976 fielding percentage, which was 15 points higher than the league average at that position.

As quoted by &quot;Baseball Legends: The Charlie Root Story, by Joseph E. Bennett, Jan. 1995 Knight Templar magazine&quot; &quot;Root was one of the fiercest competitors the game ever knew... his cigar-chomping, no-nonsense visage was one of the most intimidating tools in his baseball arsenal.&quot;

==Post-career==
Root also had a long post-playing career as a manager in minor league baseball and pitching coach, serving in the latter role for the Cubs (1951–53; 1960) and Milwaukee Braves (1956–57). He was a coach on Milwaukee&#x27;s 1957 World Series champions.

Root, who had a Diamond-R Ranch of 1,000 acres in Paicines, California, became a cattle rancher who liked hunting and fishing.

==Death==
Root died at age 71 in Hollister, California, after an extended illness. His ashes were scattered at Garden of Memories Memorial Park in Salinas, California.

<text>Rosalie Silberman Abella (born July 1, 1946) is a Canadian jurist. In 2004, Abella was appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada, becoming the first Jewish woman and refugee to sit on the Canadian Supreme Court bench. She retired from the federal bench in 2021.

== Early life and education ==
Rosalie Silberman Abella was born on July 1, 1946, the daughter of Jacob and Fanny (Krongold) Silberman. She was born in a displaced persons camp in Stuttgart, Germany. Her father was born in Sienno, Poland, in 1910, while her mother was born in Ostrowiec in 1917. Abella&#x27;s older brother was murdered in the Holocaust. Her parents both survived, Jacob Silberman was liberated from Theresienstadt Concentration Camp, Fanny Silberman survived Buchenwald Concentration Camp. Jacob had studied law at the Jagiellonian University in Kraków and was appointed head of legal services for displaced persons in the US Zone of Southwest Germany. In 1950, her family was admitted into Canada, though Jacob Silberman was not allowed to practise law because he was not a citizen.

From a young age, Abella was determined to become a lawyer. She attended Oakwood Collegiate Institute and Bathurst Heights Secondary School in Toronto, Ontario. She then attended the University of Toronto, where she earned a B.A. in 1967 and an LL.B. in 1970. In 1964, Abella graduated from the Royal Conservatory of Music in classical piano.

== Career ==
Abella was called to the Ontario bar in 1972. She practised civil and criminal litigation until 1976, when, at the age of 29, she was appointed to the Ontario Family Court (which is now part of the Ontario Court of Justice) by then–attorney general Roy McMurtry, becoming both the youngest and first pregnant judge in Canadian history. She was appointed to the Ontario Court of Appeal in 1992.

In 1983–1984, Abella served as the sole commissioner of the federal Royal Commission on Equality in Employment (known as the Abella commission), appointed by Lloyd Axworthy. As commissioner, she coined the term and concept of &quot;employment equity&quot;, a strategy for reducing barriers in employment faced by women, visible minorities, people with disabilities, and Aboriginal peoples. The theories of equality and discrimination developed in the report were adopted in &quot;Andrews v Law Society of British Columbia&quot; (1989), the Supreme Court of Canada&#x27;s first decision regarding equality rights under the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. Its recommendations report was also adopted by jurisdictions including New Zealand, South Africa, and Northern Ireland.

In 1988, Abella moderated the televised English-language leaders&#x27; debate between Brian Mulroney (PC), John Turner (Liberal) and Ed Broadbent (NDP).

Abella has acted as chair of the Ontario Labour Relations Board, the Ontario Study into Access to Legal Services by the Disabled and the Ontario Law Reform Commission, and as a member of the Ontario Human Rights Commission and of the judicial inquiry into the Donald Marshall, Jr. case. From 1988 to 1992, she taught at McGill University Faculty of Law as the Boulton Visiting Professor.

In 2004, Prime Minister Paul Martin appointed Abella to the Supreme Court of Canada. Abella became the first Jewish woman to sit on the court. She was eligible to serve on the Supreme Court until July 1, 2021, when she turned 75. In February 2021, she announced that she would retire on that date, and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau started the selection process of a new justice who would succeed her. Mahmud Jamal was selected as her replacement, and assumed office on July 1, 2021. Following her retirement from the Supreme Court, Abella has served as a visiting professor at Fordham University School of Law and Harvard Law School.

Abella is an authority on constitutional law and human rights law. Her opinions often cite foreign and international law. According to Sian Elias, they are regarded as authoritative by judges in many common law countries.

== Honours and personal life ==
Abella has received at least 38 honorary degrees. On June 7, 2023, she was awarded an Honorary Doctor of Laws from the University of Saskatchewan. She became a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada in 1997. She was awarded the Canadian version of the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal in 2002. She was elected a foreign honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2007. In 2012 she was awarded the Canadian version of the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal. In May 2016, she was awarded an honorary degree from Yale University, becoming the first Canadian woman to earn such an honour. In addition, she has been a judge of the Giller Prize. In January 2017, Northwestern Pritzker School of Law&#x27;s Center for International Human Rights named her the Global Jurist of the Year for 2016 in recognition of her commitment to human rights and international criminal justice. In April 2018, Abella was elected a member of the American Philosophical Society.

Abella is the widow of historian Irving Abella, and has two sons.

&quot;Without Precedent: The Supreme Life of Rosalie Abella&quot;, a documentary film about Abella by director Barry Avrich, premiered on May 1, 2023 at the Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival.

<doc id="933376" wikidata="Q2639063" url="?curid=933376" title="Albert Watson (South Carolina politician)">
<text>Albert William Watson (August 30, 1922 – September 25, 1994) was an American politician, a Democrat-turned-Republican state and U.S. representative from South Carolina. He is best known for his losing 1970 campaign for governor of South Carolina, which has been described as the last high-profile, openly segregationist campaign in American politics.

==Background==
Albert William Watson was born in 1922 to Claude Watson Sr. and his wife in Sumter in central South Carolina. His family moved and he was reared near the state capital of Columbia in Lexington County, where he attended public schools. He subsequently enrolled at the former North Greenville Junior College in Greenville, South Carolina. During World War II, Watson served as a weather specialist in the United States Army Air Forces.

In 1950, he graduated from the University of South Carolina School of Law and thereafter opened his legal practice in Columbia. In 1954, he was elected from Richland County to the South Carolina House of Representatives, which he served from 1955 to 1959 and again from 1961 to 1963.

In 1958, Watson lost the Democratic primary for lieutenant governor to Burnet Maybank, Jr., son of former U.S. Senator Burnet Maybank. In 1961, Watson returned to the state House for a final two-year term.

In 1948, Watson married the former Lillian Audrey Williams (born 1926), and the couple had three children, Laura L. Watson, Albert Watson, Jr., and Clark P. Watson. A Southern Baptist deacon, Watson had a twin brother, Allan R. Watson (1922–2001), who was a Baptist minister and served as the pastor of churches in Florida and Alabama. He preached at the White House in September 1969. A second brother, Claude Watson Jr., of Columbia, died in 2003.

==Congressional career==
In 1962, Watson first ran for South Carolina&#x27;s 2nd congressional district seat in the U.S. House to fill the opening created when fellow Democrat John J. Riley died on New Year&#x27;s Day. His wife, Corinne Boyd Riley, had won a special election to serve out the remainder of the term, but did not run for a full term in November. After securing the Democratic nomination, Watson faced Floyd Spence, a fellow state representative from neighboring Lexington County, who had turned Republican a few months earlier. The ensuing general election was far closer than expected, with Watson winning by only five percentage points. He received crucial support from his mentor, U.S. Senator Strom Thurmond.

Like Thurmond, Watson was an open and unashamed segregationist. Both supported Barry Goldwater&#x27;s campaign for President. While Watson headed the South Carolina &quot;Democrats for Goldwater&quot; organization, Thurmond went as far as switching parties and becoming a Republican on September 17, 1964. Partly because of his support for Goldwater, Watson was reelected without opposition as Goldwater carried South Carolina, the first Republican to have done so since Rutherford B. Hayes in 1876. The House Democratic Caucus stripped Watson of his seniority for supporting Goldwater. Another Deep South congressman, John Bell Williams of Mississippi, lost his seniority for supporting Goldwater as well. Declaring he would &quot;not sit around and be bullied by northern liberals,&quot; Watson resigned from Congress on February 1, 1965. He then announced that he would run in the special election for his old seat on June 15, 1965—as a Republican.

Watson won the special election with 59.1 percent of the vote to become the first Republican to represent South Carolina in the House since 1896, and the first Republican to win a disputed House election in the state since Reconstruction. It was a different Republican Party in the South, however, as in 1965 most blacks in South Carolina were still effectively disenfranchised.

Watson was comfortably reelected in 1966 and 1968. Watson&#x27;s opposition to civil rights legislation exceeded that of most other Southern Republicans. For instance, he was the only House Republican to vote against the Jury Selection Act of 1968, a civil rights measure intended to eliminate racial discrimination in jury selection.

==1970 gubernatorial election==
In 1970, Watson opted not to run for reelection, instead announcing his candidacy for governor. As a measure of how weak the Republicans were in South Carolina for most of the post-Reconstruction era, in most elections since losing the governorship in 1892 they hadn&#x27;t even fielded a candidate. He won the nomination with a major assist from Thurmond. He faced strong competition from the Democratic nominee, Lieutenant Governor John C. West, originally from Camden. State and national Republicans were somewhat cool toward Watson because of his obstinate support for segregation. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 was intended to end segregation, and enforcement of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 meant that African Americans were re-entering the political system. Not a single daily newspaper endorsed Watson for governor.

Hastings Wyman took leave from his position as an aide to Senator Thurmond to serve as Watson&#x27;s campaign manager.

===Gubernatorial campaign===
Watson&#x27;s running mate was James Marvin Henderson Sr.

===1970 election results===
Official results gave West 251,151 votes (52.1 percent) to Watson&#x27;s 221,236 (45.9 percent). Red Bethea of the American Independent Party polled 9,758 votes (2 percent).

African-American voters in 1970 numbered 206,394, or 46 percent of the African-American voting-age population and 35 percent of the total registration.

Historians consider Watson&#x27;s gubernatorial campaign to be the last openly segregationist campaign in South Carolina and one of the last in the South as a whole. Watson was succeeded in the House by Spence, who had nearly won the seat in 1962. Spence went on to hold the seat for thirty years.

==Later years==
In 1971, Thurmond asked Nixon to appoint Albert Watson to the United States Court of Military Appeals, but Democratic U.S. Senator George McGovern of South Dakota opposed him. The next year McGovern became Nixon&#x27;s general election opponent.

Watson died in Columbia at the age of 72 in 1994. He is interred there at Crescent Hill Memorial Gardens and Mausoleum.

<text>After the 2003 invasion of Iraq was completed and the regime of Saddam Hussein was toppled in May 2003, an Iraqi insurgency began that would last until the United States left in 2011. The 2003–2006 phase of the Iraqi insurgency lasted until early 2006, when it escalated from an insurgency to a Sunni-Shia civil war, which became the most violent phase of the Iraq War.

==Background==

===Build up to insurgency===
A number of factors played into the beginning of the insurgency in Iraq. Invading U.S.-led forces were unable to immediately fill the power vacuum caused by the sudden collapse of a highly centralized state authority, resulting in weeks of virtual anarchy. Due to the fact that Saddam Hussein terrorized his military and time constraints in the planning of the invasion on the United States&#x27; side a power vacuum was created once the invasion started. This was due to the fact that Iraqi soldiers abandoned areas before U.S. forces could reach them and the fact that the United States failed to draw up plans on what to do once Saddam Hussein had been removed from power. The inability of American-led forces to control the situation, led to Iraqi resentment. Additionally, the unexpectedly quick implosion of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime meant that the invading forces never engaged and decisively defeated his military in any major battle; the Iraqi armed forces simply dispersed, often with their weapons, back to their homes. At least part of the reason for this, was the fact that the Iraqi military and the security services were disbanded, after the invasion by U.S.-led forces, a decision taken by the U.S. ambassador Paul Bremer. Another cause of resentment was the lack of immediate humanitarian aid and reconstruction efforts for Iraqis suffering from the invasion, the long-term effects of the repression and mismanagement of the Saddam Hussein regime, and international sanctions. A number of factions felt suspicious of long-term American intentions; the conduct of some American soldiers also served to heighten tensions. The de-Ba’athification Commission set up by the Coalition Provisional Authority, the nature of selection of the Governing Council, and other policy decisions were interpreted by Sunni Arabs as actions intended to single out their community for discrimination; this encouraged the beginnings of sectarian tensions. However, before the invasion sectarian tensions already existed in Iraq, due to the inherent inequalities between those communities during Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime.

Members of insurgent groups came from a variety of sources. Former members of the security services of the Ba’ath regime, former military officers, and some other Ba’ath Party members are cited as members of insurgent groups; indeed, these elements formed the primary backbone of the nascent insurgency. Initially, most former members of the Ba&#x27;ath Party and former Iraqi soldiers expressed a willingness to compromise with the Coalition forces. However, many lost their jobs and pensions with the disbanding of the Iraqi army by Bremer; this, and the unwillingness of the Coalition Provisional Authority to negotiate with former Ba&#x27;ath elements, provided impetus for the initial insurgency. While 80% the officers were Sunni, the rank and file of the regular army was 80% Shia. Prisoners released from prison by Saddam Hussein before his disappearance provided another source both of insurgent recruits and of organized crime factions. Finally, as O’Hanlan says, the porous borders of Iraq and the subsequent foreign insurgents also bolstered the insurgency.

==History==
===Insurgency begins (May–June 2003)===
In May 2003, after the Iraqi conventional forces had been defeated and disbanded, the U.S. military noticed a gradually increasing flurry of attacks on U.S. troops in various regions of the so-called &quot;Sunni Triangle&quot;, especially in Baghdad and in the regions around Fallujah and Tikrit. These consisted of small groups of suspected guerrillas firing assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades, in addition to using basic forms of IEDs (Improvised Explosive Device) on U.S. patrols and convoys in attacks that were often poorly planned and demonstrated poor marksmanship and training. In many cases the insurgents were killed in the return fire. The U.S. military blamed the attacks on remnants of the Ba&#x27;ath Party and the Fedayeen Saddam militia. It seems that many of these attacks were &quot;potshots&quot; from disaffected former members of the Iraqi military. Tensions between U.S. forces and the residents of Fallujah were especially severe, with crowd riots and small skirmishes commonplace.

===Coalition response and counterinsurgency (June–September 2003)===
In response to the attacks taking place, on June 9, the U.S. military launched Operation Peninsula Strike, in which 2,000 soldiers from Task Force Iron Horse swept through the Tigris River peninsula of Thuluiya in the Sunni Triangle, detaining 397 Iraqis. Almost all of the detainees were later released, and the operation failed to stem the tide of the assaults. A series of similar operations were launched throughout the summer in the Sunni Triangle, such as Operation Sidewinder, Operation Soda Mountain, and Operation Ivy Serpent. One, known as Operation Desert Scorpion, succeeded in destroying an encampment of over 70 local fighters, possibly linked to the Fedayeen Saddam, near the Syrian border town of Rawa.

However, these initial counterinsurgency efforts failed to suppress the insurgency. The sweeps failed to stem the tide of the attacks, which during the summer of 2003 numbered about a dozen a day and resulted in, on average, 1 U.S. soldier killed and 7 more wounded every day. The guerrillas began adopting new and more complex tactics, such as the planting of IEDs (concealed bombs usually placed on the roadside), the use of mortars, and better-planned ambushes. Although some humanitarian operations were included in what was intended to be a &quot;carrot and stick&quot; strategy, the cordon and search operations are widely criticized for being far too blunt and not carefully targeted. The large numbers of innocent Iraqis detained during the raids, the removal of palm trees and other foliage to deprive guerrillas of cover for ambushes (and which represented the livelihoods of many farmers) and the failure to restore basic services such as water and electricity to pre-war levels began increasing the nationalist resistance among the Sunnis and began resulting in the disillusionment of an Iraqi populace. In addition, as the summer neared its end, a series of suicide bombings began that suggested an increasing Islamist terrorist threats. The Canal Hotel bombing targeting the UN on August 19, and the massive blast at the Imam Ali Shrine that assassinated Ayatollah Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim along with dozens of others. Only ten days later marked the beginning of another phase to the conflict.

An effort began in August by the coalition to increase human intelligence gathering in order to more carefully target operations. The effort did eventually begin to reap limited and temporary results in the north-central region of the country (which includes Tikrit and up to the southern borders of Mosul and Kirkuk), as informants guided troops over the next six months to hideouts and weapons caches primarily belonging to the Fedayeen Saddam and the remaining Ba&#x27;athist resistance. However, most of the Sunni regions saw the military situation gradually worsen for the U.S. as a disaffected nationalist resistance began to take hold.

===Ramadan Offensive (October–November 2003)===

In October 2003, the intensity and pace of insurgent attacks began to increase. Finally, at the end of October, a series of four simultaneous suicide car bomb attacks on the Iraqi police and the International Red Cross, quickly followed by a sharp surge in guerrilla attacks, ushered in an insurgent effort that was termed the &quot;Ramadan Offensive,&quot; as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Attacks that were increased to nearly 50 a day, along with a series of helicopter downings, resulted in a U.S. death toll of 82 for the month of November with 337 wounded in action.

===Operation Iron Hammer (November–December 2003)===
In response, the coalition launched its counteroffensive known as Operation Iron Hammer in the second week of November. Operation Iron Hammer brought back the use of U.S. air power for the first time since the end of the initial war to topple Saddam Hussein&#x27;s regime, with suspected ambush sites and mortar launching positions struck from the air and with artillery fire. Surveillance of major routes, patrols, and raids on suspected insurgents were stepped up. In addition, two villages, including Saddam&#x27;s birthplace of al-Auja and the small town of Abu Hishma were wrapped in barbed wire and carefully monitored. Following Operation Iron Hammer, the number of insurgent attacks dropped to an average of 18 a day. In the wave of intelligence information fueling the raids on Ba’ath Party members connected to insurgency, Saddam Hussein himself was captured on a farm near Tikrit on December 12, 2003. This apparent renewed success led many to a renewed sense of optimism that the U.S. was prevailing in the fight against the insurgency.

===January–March 2004===
The period from December 2003 to March 2004 marked a relative lull in guerrilla attacks. It is believed that although some damage was done to the insurgency, this was primarily due to a reorganization period during which new U.S. tactics were studied and a renewed offensive planned. Although the guerrilla attacks were less intense, the &quot;terrorist&quot; offensive, possibly connected to the followers of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, only increased. Hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police (mainly Shi&#x27;a) were killed over this period in a series of massive bombings. These events marked the emergence of the organization then known as Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, led by al-Zarqawi, to prominence as a major force within the insurgency. This organization, composed both of foreign fighters and Iraqis, had a militant Sunni Islamist agenda.

=== Spring 2004 uprising ===

Resistance to U.S.-led forces would not for long be confined to the Sunni regions of Iraq. Over this period, Shiite dissatisfaction with the occupation, especially among the urban poor, had been gradually increasing for some of the same reasons it had been among the Sunnis: the perception that the coalition had failed to deliver on its promises and a nationalist dissatisfaction with foreign occupation. Many young men without jobs or prospects and who had lost faith with the promises of the U.S. began to become drawn to Shiite religious radicalism, especially of the brand advocated by the cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Sadr&#x27;s distinguished family background, and his fiery anti-occupation rhetoric and calls for the implementation of Islamic law, caused him to emerge as the leader of this portion of Iraqi Shiite society. In June 2003, after being rejected from a spot on the Iraqi Governing Council, he had created a militia known as the Mahdi Army, whose mission he said was to help keep order and cleanse Iraq of &quot;evil.&quot; Since that point, the U.S. had regarded him as a threat, but was divided on whether or not to proceed with a crackdown. Eventually, as Sadr&#x27;s rhetoric heated and his militia paraded through Sadr City in what seemed like a challenge to the United States, they decided to begin to squeeze his movement. On March 29, they moved to close Sadr&#x27;s newspaper known as &quot;al-Hawza&quot; and arrested one of his aides on murder charges. That, combined with his steadily decreasing political prospects for success within the U.S.-backed interim government, pushed Sadr to decide for armed revolt.

On April 4, the Mahdi Army was directed to begin launching attacks on coalition targets and to seize control from the nascent U.S.-trained Iraqi security forces. The Mahdi Army, which by then numbered from 3,000 to 10,000 men, organized quickly escalating violent riots and then a coordinated assault, surprising coalition and Iraqi forces and seizing control of Najaf, Kufa, al-Kut, and parts of Baghdad and southern cities like Nasiriyah, Amarah, and Basra. A widespread collapse of the Iraqi security forces ensued, with most deserting or defecting to the rebels rather than fighting. Soon, combat was erupting in many urban centers of southern and central portions of Iraq as U.S. forces attempted to maintain control and prepared for a counteroffensive.

At the same time, the Sunni insurgency was rapidly intensifying. On March 31, 2004, four private military contractors working for the U.S. military were killed and subsequently mutilated by insurgents and a crowd of residents in the city of Fallujah, long a particularly troublesome center of Sunni resistance to the U.S. presence. On the same day, 5 U.S. soldiers were killed by a large IED on a road a few miles outside of the city. The attacks took place as the Marines were taking over responsibility for Al Anbar Governorate, in which Fallujah is located, from the U.S. Army. The intended Marine strategy of patrols, less aggressive raids, humanitarian aid, and close cooperation with local leaders was quickly suspended and the U.S. decided that it was time for a major assault to clear the city of insurgents. On April 4, U.S. and Iraqi forces launched Operation Vigilant Resolve to retake the city, which had clearly fallen completely into rebel hands. They met very stiff and well-organized resistance from the guerrillas. The insurgent force defending Fallujah was believed to number over 2,000 men, divided into platoon-sized units. The guerrillas used sophisticated tactics not seen before in the Iraq war, using standard infantry tactics such as indirect fire support, cover fire, and phased withdrawal. It was noted to resemble a Soviet-style &quot;defense-in-depth&quot; strategy, suggesting guidance from former members of the Iraqi Army rather than foreign jihadis who would more likely used tactics reminiscent of the mujahideen in Afghanistan. After three days of fighting with the U.S. Marines, the insurgents still held three-quarters of the city.

Cases of widespread reach and planning, suggesting national insurgent coordination, were noted. Hundreds of insurgents cut the road between Fallujah and Baghdad to the east, while west of Fallujah in Ramadi, over 150 insurgents launched an offensive against U.S. Marine positions. A similar attack followed, conducted by about 150 insurgents, against U.S. Marines near the Syrian border in Al-Qa&#x27;im. The assaults were beaten back, but the U.S. toll from the combined attacks numbered in the dozens.

Political pressure began to build on the United States and the Governing Council of Iraq as the hospital of Fallujah continued to report high numbers of civilian casualties, inflaming further the Iraqi people and Muslim world in general. After two weeks of fighting, the U.S. Marines were on the verge of capturing, but had not yet taken central control of, the city of Fallujah. Pentagon leaders, fearing that continuing the effort to capture the city might further inflame a larger revolt against coalition authority, pulled back the forces. The Marines were ordered to stand-down and cordon off the city on April 30, where they would remain in a perimeter around the city for the following six months.

A compromise on April 30 was reached in order to ensure security within Fallujah itself by creating the &quot;Fallujah Brigade&quot;, a unit that drew from former members of Iraq&#x27;s Army, local volunteers, and even the insurgents themselves. The unit&#x27;s formation was part of a truce negotiation. This unit was to act under the control of the Coalition Provisional Authority, patrol alongside the Iraqi Police and National Guardsmen but maintain its autonomy. The Fallujah Brigade had many former Saddam loyalists. From various reports, Brigade members re-integrated themselves into the insurgent outfits that dominated. The city remained under the control of insurgent and rebel forces. Reportedly, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&#x27;s organization was among the several that exercised some authority in the area.

By the end of the spring uprising, the cities of Fallujah, Samarra, Baqubah, and Ramadi had been left under Sunni guerrilla control with American patrols in the cities ceased. The insurgency had undergone another major shift, as insurgent organizations now had safe havens in cities such as Fallujah to develop and coordinate with each other. Zarqawi&#x27;s group and its allies were in a period of uneasy cooperation with other insurgent groups dominated by nationalist and Ba&#x27;athist agendas, although the groups increasingly came into competition for territory within Sunni insurgent-controlled areas.

U.S. forces launched only occasional armored forays into Samarra and Baquba, while about half a dozen small forts were maintained by the U.S. Marines in Ramadi, with the surrounding territory in the city controlled by rebels. American ground forces remained outside of Fallujah, though regular air strikes were conducted on alleged safehouses of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&#x27;s followers in the city. With the battle for Fallujah over, the Sunni insurgency continued against the U.S. forces remaining outside these cities as the guerrillas resumed their tactics of using IED&#x27;s and mortars to attack U.S. forces indirectly, for the most part avoiding direct combat.

Meanwhile, the fighting continued in the Shiite south. Over the next three months, over 1,500 Mahdi Army militiamen, several hundred civilians, and dozens of coalition soldiers were killed as the U.S. gradually took back the southern cities. On June 6, a truce was reached, temporarily ending the fighting. Sadr entered into negotiations with the provisional government to lay down arms and enter the political process, while the U.S. declared that the Mahdi Army had been militarily defeated when Brigadier General Mark Hertling, a top U.S. commander in charge of Najaf, Iraq, stated, &quot;The Moqtada militia is militarily defeated. We have killed scores of them over the last few weeks, and that is in Najaf alone. [...] The militia have been defeated, or have left...&quot; However, Sadr remained in control of parts of Najaf and Sadr City, while the U.S. continued to patrol in the south outside those areas.

===Transfer of sovereignty (June–July 2004)===
On June 28, 2004, the occupation was formally ended by the coalition, which transferred power to a new Iraqi government led by Prime Minister Iyad Allawi. With the situation in the south seemingly settled and the transfer of power, many hoped that the steam would be taken out of the ongoing Sunni insurgency. Although many Iraqis were optimistic about the government, militants saw it as little more than an American puppet and continued the fight unabated. On July 18, guerrillas offered a $285,000 reward for Allawi&#x27;s assassination.

=== The Battle for Najaf, the Truce Agreement, and aftermath (August–September 2004) ===
Soon, however, the peace in the south would once again be broken. The U.S. Marines, having taken control from the U.S. Army of the area around Najaf, began to adopt a more aggressive posture with the Mahdi Army and began patrolling zones previously considered off-limits. Soon, the Mahdi Army declared that the truce had been broken and militiamen launched an assault on a police station. U.S. forces responded, and in the first week of August, a prolonged conflict broke out in Najaf (one of the holiest cities in Shi&#x27;ite Islam) over control of the Imam Ali shrine, often thought of as the holiest Shi&#x27;ite Muslim shrine in Iraq. Heavy combat ensued in the Old City of Najaf around the shrine and in the Wadi al-Salam (Valley of Peace) cemetery, one of the largest cemeteries in the world. The terrain of the cemetery, densely packed with above-ground mausoleums and caves, favored the urban guerrilla warfare conducted by Sadr&#x27;s militia. It was described by U.S. soldiers as &quot;jungle warfare without the jungle.&quot; Nevertheless, U.S. forces continued a steady advance and inflicted heavy casualties on Sadr&#x27;s forces, lightly wounding Sadr himself.

Eventually, after three weeks of fighting, Sadr&#x27;s forces, which originally had at least 2,000 militiamen spread out throughout the city and the cemetery, was reduced to only a few hundred holding out within the shrine itself. Although much of the fighting was conducted by US forces, it was anticipated that only Iraqi forces would enter the shrine. Negotiations with cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, a leading Shi&#x27;ite cleric in Iraq and leader of the Mahdi Army defending the shrine, were attempted but did not end the standoff. On August 25, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, aged 73, arrived in Iraq and began traveling towards Najaf to stop the bloodshed. By the next day, an agreement brokered by Sistani seemed to come into force. Although the exact terms of the agreement were not clear, it required the Mahdi militia to disarm and vacate Najaf and for U.S. troops to withdraw from the city; these forces were to be replaced by interim government security forces. An interim government spokesman said al-Sadr&#x27;s supporters could join the political process and al-Sadr may remain free. These requirements are essentially the same as those under the truce agreed on in June. According to the agreement, Ayatollah Sistani would also take over responsibility for the Imam Ali Shrine; fighters would leave the shrine, and visitors will be allowed in; additionally, the Iraqi interim government would agree to repair damage to buildings caused by the fighting. This resolution occurred two days before the one-year anniversary of the assassination of Sayed Mohammed Baqir al-Hakim, a prominent Shi&#x27;ite cleric from Najaf.

While for the most part both the Mahdi Army and U.S. forces observed the truce by withdrawing from Najaf and returning control to the Iraqi government, many of the remnants of Sadr&#x27;s militia in Najaf kept their weapons and moved north into Sadr City in order to regroup. Negotiations involving the U.S. and local leaders in Sadr City for the disarmament of the local guerrillas and the veterans of the fighting in Najaf had broken down by early September. The Mahdi Army, which may not have been acting under Mr. Sadr&#x27;s orders, refused any agreement that allowed U.S. patrolling Sadr City or which involved the handing in of their weapons. As a result, renewed heavy fighting began on September 6 between U.S. forces and Shiite militiamen in Sadr City. The first few days of fighting killed at least 2 U.S. soldiers and dozens of Iraqis, both civilians and fighters. In combination with a car bombing that killed 7 U.S. Marines and 3 Iraqi soldiers nine miles north of Fallujah, as well as an increase in IED attacks by Sunni insurgents in Baghdad, the total U.S. death toll for the Iraq war passed 1,000 on September 7, 2004.

===Coalition counteroffensive against Sunni insurgency begins (September–November 2004)===
With the violent threat from Sadr&#x27;s forces eliminated throughout most of Iraq, coalition forces and the Iraqi government began turning their attention towards bringing under control the numerous Sunni guerrilla safe-havens that remained from the spring uprising. Officials from the U.S.-led coalition and Allawi&#x27;s government began drawing up plans to retake guerrilla strongholds in advance of the parliamentary elections planned for January 2005 in Iraq. Many observers and coalition officials feared that by leaving swaths of territory under guerrilla control (and the populations living in those areas therefore unable to vote), the legitimacy of the elections would be compromised. The cities under the least firm guerrilla control would be taken first, with Fallujah, the heart of the insurgency, waiting until after the U.S. presidential election.

Changes within the Sunni insurgency were also taking place over this period. Jama&#x27;at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad, which changed its name to Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn (Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI)) on October 17 following a communique from Zarqawi declaring allegiance to Osama bin Laden, was aggressively seeking leadership of the insurgency and asserting control over swathes of Sunni territory (including on Haifa Street in Baghdad itself).

The first of the offensives began on September 1, 2004, when U.S. and Iraqi forces besieged the northern Turkmen city of Tal Afar, located west of Mosul. U.S. forces said that the town was being used as a transit point for the entry of foreign guerrillas of al-Qaeda in Iraq and weapons from nearby Syria. After a 12-day siege, the city was stormed and retaken by U.S. and Iraqi troops on September 12. At least 58 people were reported killed in the fighting.

The next stage of the offensive began on September 30, when 3,000 soldiers from the U.S. Army 1st Infantry Division and 2,000 Iraqi troops launched a surprise attack on guerrilla-controlled Samarra. The insurgent hold on the city proved to be tenuous, and the rebel forces were quickly beaten back by U.S. armor and air power. Rather than fighting, most of the guerrillas either fled the city or melted into the population. The U.S. estimated that 130 insurgents and 1 U.S. soldier were killed, although residents reported that many civilians were among the dead. The operation was declared a success by the U.S. military on October 4. U.S. troops also reported achieving freedom of movement in Baquba, also north of Baghdad, though neither city was fully &quot;pacified&quot;.

The next phase began soon afterwards, on October 5, when 3,000 coalition and Iraqi troops began a sweep against Sunni insurgents through northern Babil province just south of Baghdad, an area also known as the &quot;Triangle of Death&quot; for the amount of hostage-taking and guerrilla violence in the area. Coalition forces moved west from their forward operating bases across the Euphrates River, securing a key bridge and conducting house-to-house searches. Once again, the insurgents, and surprisingly much of the civilian population, melted away before the offensive rather than fighting, taking shelter in nearby areas. Small-scale rebel harassment was reported, but not major fighting. As a result, the operation saw little success in netting rebel fighters.

At the same time, negotiations involving the Iraqi interim government, tribal leaders, and Mahdi Army officials successfully brought a resolution to the fighting in Sadr City. A weapons handover was announced, and some weapons trickled into the Iraqi police from Shiite rebels. Although the Mahdi Army retained some of its weapons stockpiles, it was no longer an official active participant in the violent Iraqi revolt. Sadr repeatedly signalled a desire to participate in the elections, though he did not compromise his strong anti-occupation stance.

This left the heart of the Sunni insurgency, Fallujah, bracing for an attack. Large numbers of U.S. Army troops and Marines began massing in bases ringing the city, and most of the civilian population fled. To support the buildup, British forces deployed the Black Watch regiment, composed of 850 men, from Basra to the &quot;triangle of death&quot; south of Baghdad in order to replace U.S. troops heading for Fallujah. The decision proved controversial in Britain, especially after the regiment suffered casualties from dogged attacks involving suicide bombers and roadside bombs.

===Battle for Fallujah and aftermath (November 2004 – January 2005)===
The U.S. and Iraqi buildup around Fallujah continued, and by the beginning of November and the time of the U.S. presidential elections, over 5,000 U.S. and 1,000 Iraqi troops surrounded the city. The Iraqi troops were drawn from what were considered the most capable segments of the U.S.-trained Iraqi security forces and were mainly drawn from the Shiite regions of Iraq. On November 8, the assault on Fallujah began in Operation Phantom Fury. Many guerrillas had apparently slipped out amongst the fleeing civilians, leaving a force of 5,000 still remaining in the city out of a force of what had grown to 10,000 insurgents (according to estimates). The vast majority of the civilian population by this time had fled, although thousands remained (either because they lacked means of transportation or because they were guarding their property).

A concentrated barrage of air strikes and artillery (including use of white phosphorus and napalm) began pounding the city. Simultaneously, U.S. and Iraqi forces began advancing, primarily from the north, and quickly secured the city&#x27;s main hospital, where rebels had reported high numbers of civilian deaths in April. Guerrilla resistance was initially reported to be less than expected, partially due to diversionary tactics and also because much of the insurgent force in Fallujah had fled.

Ruined homes across the city attest to a strategy of overwhelming force. A video showing the killing of at least one unarmed and wounded man by an American serviceman surfaced, throwing renewed doubt and outrage at the efficiency of the US occupation. The Marine was later cleared of any wrongdoing, as the Marines had been warned that the enemy would sometimes feign death and booby-trap bodies as a tactic to lure Marines to their deaths. November was the deadliest month of the occupation for coalition troops, surpassing April.

By November 9, U.S. units had penetrated into the heart of the city. By now, they were receiving stiff opposition from small groups of guerrillas, employing hit-and-run tactics, and snipers. Booby traps, rigged to destroy homes U.S. troops had entered, also were encountered, including some even attached to corpses. Within a week, 38+ U.S. troops had been killed and 275+ wounded in the offensive. Insurgent losses during that same time period were believed to be much heavier, running into several hundred.

Gradually, U.S. and Iraqi forces pushed the main insurgent force into the southwest of the city, carefully conducting house-to-house searches and securing areas of the city block by block. The U.S. military adopted a &quot;hammer and anvil&quot; strategy, in which they hoped to methodically push the insurgents into the southwestern corner of the city and up against the open desert (where they would be without cover or concealment and open to a final rout by U.S. firepower). Although they encountered great difficulties against the evasive guerrilla bands, the majority of the insurgents in the city had been killed or captured by late November. Significant guerrilla resistance, however, continued until January (much of it by insurgents operating out of pre-prepared hidden tunnels).

By the end of most of the fighting, over 50 U.S. Marines had been killed and several hundred wounded. As many as 3,000–4,000 insurgents may have been killed, according to U.S. military estimates. Reports suggested a heavy toll among remaining civilians in the city as well. Most of the city suffered severe damage from the fighting by the battle&#x27;s end. In the months to come, only a small fraction of refugees from the city would permanently return.

The attack on Fallujah had unintended consequences for much of the rest of Iraq. Insurgents fleeing Fallujah filtered into northern Babil province, Mosul in the north, and Baghdad itself. As a result, a sharp spike of violence was seen upon the attack&#x27;s commencement, with mortar and IED attacks increasing in frequency and intensity. The campaign of suicide bombings and car bombings, mainly affecting Iraqi civilians, intensified to the worst point ever seen. The worst violence was seen in Mosul. Insurgents launched a massive offensive, seizing the western (Arab) half of the city and effectively destroying the police force at the same time the U.S. launched its assault on Fallujah. On November 16, over 3,000 U.S. troops and a similar number of Iraqi troops launched a counteroffensive, dismantling insurgents from strategic points but failing to break their hold on most of the city.

Mosul, which a year earlier was relatively peaceful compared to much of Iraq, would be a scene of some of the heaviest sustained fighting for some time to come. In December, 14 American soldiers were killed and over a hundred injured when an explosion struck an open-tent mess hall in Mosul, where President Bush had displayed a Thanksgiving turkey the year before. It was one of the most costly attacks on U.S. troops during the war – the explosion is believed to have come from a suicide bomber.

With the year&#x27;s end, the U.S. military reported that they had killed or captured at least 15,000 guerrillas over the course of 2004, giving a new perspective on the intensity of the fighting during that period. 848 U.S. soldiers were killed in 2004, and 9,034 were wounded in action. There are no exact figures, but thousands of Iraq security forces, as well as Iraqi civilians, were killed as well, both in terrorist attacks and from U.S. aerial bombardment and accidental shootings.

===Iraqi elections and aftermath (January–March 2005)===
On 31 January 2005, an election for a government to draft a permanent constitution took place. Although some violence and lack of widespread Sunni participation marred the event, most of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated.

Although no major cities were now under the control of rebels, the spike of increased guerrilla violence against U.S. and Iraqi forces continued into January. The focus of attention was now on the impending elections set for January 31. Many rebels became intent on disrupting the elections, and conducted an intense campaign of assassinations and suicide bombings on Iraqis involved with them. 107 U.S. soldiers were also killed in the month running up to the elections. By now, Iraqi police and security forces trained by the U.S. seemed to be beginning to take a more prominent role in many towns and cities of Iraq, and were beginning to bear the brunt of the violence. At least 109 Iraqi troops and police were killed in the month before the elections.

Despite the renewed insurgent effort, on January 31 the elections proceeded as scheduled. The Shiite and Kurdish populations, encouraged by their leaders, turned out in large numbers to the polls. With the heavy security presence on that day, the guerrillas failed to successfully conduct any large attacks and the elections were largely seen as a success. The Sunni population, however, responding to a boycott call by their clerics and intimidated by insurgents, largely stayed at home. As a result, the Sistani-endorsed largely Shiite ticket and the Kurdish parties received the largest share of the votes, leaving the Sunni minority disenfranchised.

Following the elections, insurgent attacks again declined and U.S. casualty rates were reduced as negotiations went on to decide on the makeup of the new government. March saw one of the least deadly months of the war for the U.S, with only 38 American troops killed. At least 200 Iraqi security forces were killed that month, however, as their more visible presence attracted the most attacks.

On 4 February, Paul Wolfowitz announced that 15,000 U.S. troops whose tours of duty had been extended in order to provide election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the next month. It was hoped to be the start of a gradual US withdrawal by many, but this was later proved to be untrue. February, March, and April proved to be relatively peaceful months compared to the carnage of November and January, with insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the average 70. This was also hoped by many to be the beginning of the end of the insurgency due to the renewed confidence in the elections, but this again proved untrue.

Hopes for a quick end to an insurgency and a withdrawal of U.S. troops where dashed at the advent of May, the Iraq&#x27;s bloodiest month since the invasion of U.S. forces in March and April 2003. Suicide bombers, believed to be radical Islamist Sunni insurgents, tore through Iraq. Its targets where often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations mainly of Shiites. As a result, over 700 Iraqi civilians died in the month, as well as 80 U.S. soldiers.

===Announcement of the Government and Renewed Fighting (April–December 2005)===
The talks for the new government seemed to continually drag on over the months and a power vacuum began to develop in Baghdad as Allawi waited to hand over power. As the political progress slowed, guerrilla attacks also began to gradually rise once more in April. Insurgents began a renewed effort to dispel any beliefs that they were weakening and to discredit the formation of the new government. The attacks gradually increased until, on April 28, the new government led by Prime Minister Ibrahim Jafarri of the Sistani-backed political party was announced.

Once the new government was announced, the Iraqi insurgency began a major offensive against civilian targets across Iraq for the next several months, killing thousands of civilians. This was considered by analysts to be a direct challenge to the authority of the Iraqi government, and although the U.S. and Iraqi armies attempted to quell the violence using large-scale, house-to-house operations in Baghdad, Tal Afar, and elsewhere, the bombings were only temporarily halted while the insurgency regrouped and planned a new offensive.

The Sunni insurgency continued to launch bomb attacks, suicide bombings, and mortar strikes against both civilian targets and coalition forces, mostly U.S. troops. Iraqi forces began sustaining heavier casualties fighting the insurgency, with more and more Iraqi troops and police engaged in pitched battles and coming under direct attack. An increasing sectarian overtone to the conflict became more visible, as most of the insurgents were Sunni Arab and the vast majority of the recruits to the Iraqi security forces came from the Shia regions of the southern Iraq.

Al-Anbar province, the westernmost and largest province of Iraq (containing the cities of Fallujah and Ramadi) was where the largest amount of combat continued to take place, with U.S. soldiers routinely suffering casualties in military operations against insurgents. At the same time, the insurgency within al-Anbar was increasingly being dominated by the Islamist insurgent group al-Qaeda in Iraq. Militants from the group had increasingly been asserting control over the major cities and towns of the province. Tribal leaders and former Ba&#x27;athists, who had previously led the fight against American troops, unsuccessfully resisted this takeover for a short time during the fall of 2005. Elsewhere in Iraq, especially in the Kurdish north and Shi&#x27;a south, violence was not as intense.

On September 10, thousands of Iraqi soldiers, backed by Coalition forces, assaulted Tal Afar in search of suspected Sunni Arab insurgents. The U.S. military and the Iraqi government asserted that the town had turned into an important way station for the Sunni insurgency, particularly al-Qaeda in Iraq. Tal Afar had been reported as a conduit for equipment and local fighters smuggled in from Syria. Prime Minister Ibrahim Jaafari ordered Iraqi forces to commence the operation to remove all insurgent elements. The operation was later declared successful at removing the city from the control of Sunni insurgents.

During the fall of 2005, insurgents, suspected to be mostly Abu Musab al-Zarqawi&#x27;s al-Qaeda in Iraq launched a new round of massive suicide bombings against Shi&#x27;a populations, declaring an all-out war on the Shi&#x27;a majority. Hundreds of Shi&#x27;a workers, soldiers, and civilians were killed in several of these individual strikes. Shi&#x27;a anger was quelled by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who forbade revenge attacks and kept the Shi&#x27;a populace in line and in support of the government.

===New Iraqi elections and the threat of civil war===
When the elections for parliament occurred on December 15, 2005, insurgents pledged not to disrupt them, and the day passed peacefully. Until the New Year of 2006, few major attacks occurred on either U.S. soldiers or on Iraqi civilians and troops. The insurgency remained quiet, launching small-scale bomb attacks that were, in comparison to the hundreds of dead in suicide attacks during the fall, relatively minor affairs.

==Aftermath==

On February 22, 2006, suspected Sunni rebels, dressed as Iraqi police commandos, stormed the Al Askari Mosque in Samarra—a mosque particularly holy to the Shi&#x27;a majority and the location where several imams are buried. Although there were no casualties in the attack, the bombing leveled the mosque and caused unprecedented anger amongst the Shi&#x27;a majority, prompting death squads, largely from the Mahdi Army, to roam the streets of Baghdad and other major cities, attacking Sunni mosques, killing Sunni civilians and murdering Sunni clerics. The Sunni insurgents and populace soon organized into their own defensive units and death squads and began further revenge killings, causing a spiral of violence that took the country into a full blown civil war.

Violence throughout the spring was largely dominated by inter-Iraqi fighting, leaving the U.S.-led coalition forces unsure of their next move as death squads engaged in tit-for-tat revenge killings. U.S. commanders were forced to admit that this level of violence was unprecedented in the three years of American occupation and reconstruction, although both political and military leaders in the United States and Iraq continued to insist that the country was not on the verge of civil war. The Interior Ministry, the ministry responsible for internal policing and headed by a Shi&#x27;a party (the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq), was suspected of utilizing entire police squads for sectarian killings and torture. Sunni communities grew fearful of approaching Iraqi police commandos, and some that had stayed out of the insurgency and the revenge killings formed militias to defend themselves against what they viewed as Shi&#x27;a aggression and encroachment. Often, these militias would open fire on police or army units that were not accompanied by American or otherwise coalition soldiers.

Suicide attacks dropped during the period in exchange for largely underreported single killings, and also included a few spectacular, brazen daylight raids on Sunni or Shi&#x27;a communities by masked gunmen who executed large numbers of opposing sect members. Bomb attacks on Sadr City, the stronghold of the Mahdi Army, resulted in the Mahdi Army moving onto the streets to exact revenge on largely uninvolved Sunni civilians. Neither the U.S. Army, nor the Iraqi Defense Ministry, were making headway in stopping the attacks. By June 2006, the UN reported that 100 civilians a day were dying in Baghdad alone due to sectarian violence.

On June 7, 2006, U.S. warplanes bombed a house north of Baghdad where terror leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi and several top associates were holding a meeting. The attack leveled the structure and killed al-Zarqawi. His death was announced a day later by U.S. military officials after they had confirmed that they had actually hit their target. Al-Qaeda in Iraq confirmed his death and quickly appointed a successor, Abu Ayyub al-Masri. U.S. military forces hailed it as a major blow against the insurgency. However, by June, the threat had shifted from Sunni insurgents, now reportedly in open talks with coalition and government officials on the circumstances regarding a truce or cease-fire, and foreign terrorists to the Shi&#x27;a and Sunni militias that roamed the streets of Baghdad and attacked one another&#x27;s communities, dividing the city in two sectarian regions. Large swaths of Baghdad became no-go zones for large segments of the population because they were either Shi&#x27;a or Sunni militia territory.

In July 2006, the U.S. military started to bolster its troop numbers in the city—a concession to the seriousness of the situation and the inability of local forces under Iraqi command to combat it. The new security crackdown, which also involved a number of Iraqi troops, was called Operation Together Forward. The operation ultimately failed to stem the tide of the attacks. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki began drawing up plans to end the violence and reconcile Sunni and Shi&#x27;a. Many observers, however, have doubted al-Maliki&#x27;s commitment towards seeking a truly equitable resolution to the conflict (on account of his Shia biases).

A Pentagon report from September 1, 2006 said attacks had risen by 24% in the month from June to August 2006 as violence spread north beyond Baghdad. Iraqi casualties soared by 51% during the same period. Analysts have said disarming militias will be difficult because of their ties with political parties. The Badr Organization, the armed wing of the powerful Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq party, a partner in Maliki&#x27;s coalition, was a product of Iran&#x27;s Revolutionary Guards. In fresh violence on September 9, 2006, 16 bodies, all bound, blindfolded, and shot, were found in different areas of Mahmudiya, south of Baghdad. Police said they were unable to identify them because they were not carrying identity cards.

Its long-term average flow rate is 76.9 cubic metres per second (m3/s), about twice the flow of either the River Barrow (37.4 m3/s) or the River Nore (42.9 m3/s) before these join, but a little less than the Barrow&#x27;s flow when it meets the Suir 20 km downstream (over 80 m3/s).

Popular with anglers, it abounds in brown trout and salmon. Although the Suir holds the record for a salmon taken from an Irish river (weighing 57 lb/26 kg, taken on a fly in 1874), as has been the case in many other Atlantic rivers, salmon stocks have been in decline in recent years.

Rising on the slopes of Devil&#x27;s Bit Mountain, just north of Templemore in County Tipperary, the Suir flows south through Loughmore, Thurles, Holycross, Golden and Knockgraffon. Merging with the River Aherlow at Kilmoyler and further on with the Tar, it turns east at the Comeragh Mountains, forming the border between County Waterford and County Tipperary. It then passes through Cahir, Clonmel and Carrick-on-Suir before reaching Waterford. Near the Port of Waterford it meets the River Barrow at Cheekpoint to form a wide navigable estuary, capable of accommodating seagoing vessels up to 32,000 tons dwt. It exits to the sea between Dunmore East and Hook Head.

Together with the Nore and the Barrow, the river is one of the trio known as The Three Sisters.

The Suir is known in Irish as the &quot;Siúr&quot; and it is thought the present spelling in English with the u and i reversed is due to a mistake. Some people therefore feel that the spelling in English should be Siur and this spelling is occasionally seen as Siur. Edmund Spenser (1552–1599) author of &quot;The Fairie Queene&quot;, in his writings during the Elizabethan age while domiciled in County Cork, referred to the &quot;gentle Shure&quot;, probable a most accurate spelling and the most phonetically correct of the period.

In the early years of the 21st century, the remains of a very large Viking settlement were found at a bend in the river at Woodstown just upstream from Waterford.

In Clonmel, the Suir floods the local area after very heavy rainfalls falling in the up river catchment of 2,173 km2. The Office of Public Works (OPW) completed and installed a Flood Forecasting System which was used to forecast flooding in January 2008 and January 2009, the flooding of January 2009 being a 1 in 5-year event. Phase 1 of the Clonmel Flood defence (1–100-year) which stated in 2007 is scheduled for completion in late 2009 and phase two and three as one contract by 2011/2012. The flood defence consists of demountable barriers, walls and earth banks. The Gashouse Bridge, Coleville Road, Davis Road, the quays and the Old Bridge are generally the worst affected areas.

Carrick-on-Suir is tidal and has a 1–50-year flood defence. The Office of Public Works (OPW) now plan to install a 1–200-year flood defence where the river Suir flows through Waterford city.

<text>José María Ruiz-Mateos y Jiménez de Tejada (11 April 1931 – 7 September 2015) was a Spanish businessman and politician.

== Biography ==

He began by exporting wine to England. As the son of a small sherry producer, he managed to sign a monster contract in 1964, becoming the exclusive supplier to John Harvey &amp; Sons. As this required more sherry wine than his family bodega could supply, he started buying other wineries. At the heart of his wine group was the company Bodegas Internacionales.

He founded the conglomerate Rumasa (Ruiz Mateos Sociedad Anónima) and had considerable influence in Spanish society. The group included several banks, hotels, wineries, supermarkets and luxury stores, insurance companies, construction firms... In 1983, the government of Spain (the Socialist Party was in office at the time and led by Felipe González) expropriated the company. The government alleged that Rumasa had failed to pay millions of pesetas in mandatory taxes to the national treasury. The government also claimed that Rumasa was in virtual bankruptcy and that it was still afloat thanks solely to imaginative accounting by the auditing department of the company. Ruiz Mateos disagreed with this assessment. He sued the government for compensation, but lost in court.

He was imprisoned on charges of currency smuggling, fraud and tax evasion.

After several years in jail, he went back into public life, became the owner of the Rayo Vallecano football (soccer) team in 1991, and formed his own political party, as part of which he was elected to the European Parliament in 1989 and consequently achieved the judicial immunity that he was looking for. He also founded a new holding company, New Rumasa, with 16,000 employees. There have been multiple and various court rulings on the Rumasa case both in Spain and outside Spain; the Supreme Court and the Constitutional Court have both spoken on numerous judgments. Ruíz Mateos was acquitted in 1999 by the Spanish Supreme Court.

He was a well-known member of Opus Dei, though he was expelled from the group in 1986.

Ruíz Mateos was the father of 13 sons and daughters.

On 17 February 2011 the ten largest companies within the Nueva Rumasa group were declared in default and unable to make payments to their creditors after the Spanish Social Security, Royal Bank of Scotland and others requested that liens be placed on the companies&#x27; assets, nearly twenty-eight years to the day on which his original holding company, Rumasa, was expropriated by the Spanish government.

==Foundation Ruiz Mateos==
The Ruiz-Mateos Foundation was created in 1978 under the sponsorship of the Ruiz-Mateos family, for the stated purpose of developing cultural pursuits, especially the visual arts, music and literature. The foundation runs competitions annually, and awards a prize called the &quot;Villa de Rota&quot; in each of these three areas. The Foundation&#x27;s collection of contemporary art is funded by the competition entrance fees and by the donations of exhibitors who use its exhibition rooms. Among other artists, the museum exhibits works by Manuel Benitez Reyes, Wenceslao Robles and Francisco Luque. The Foundation museum, created in 2005, is located in an old family house built in 1865.

<doc id="933386" wikidata="Q564845" url="?curid=933386" title="François-Vincent Toussaint">
<text>François-Vincent Toussaint (21 December 1715 - 22 June 1772) was a French writer most famous for &quot;Les Mœurs&quot; (The Manners). The book was published in 1748 and banned the same year; it was prosecuted and burned by the French court of justice.

Toussaint was born in Paris and studied to become a lawyer, but he always worked in the book trade. He worked with Denis Diderot and Marc-Antoine Eidous on a French translation of Dr. Robert James&#x27;s &quot;A Medicinal Dictionary&quot; (the London publication of 1743-1745, fol. 3 vols, became &quot;Dictionnaire universel de medicine&quot;, published in Paris 1746-1748, fol. 6 vols). He contributed to the first volumes of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot; of Diderot and Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert. He translated Tobias Smollett&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Peregrine Pickle&quot;, and composed the table of contents for a 1749 edition of Montesquieu&#x27;s &quot;De l&#x27;esprit des lois&quot; (&quot;The Spirit of Law&quot;).

He was fortunate when his novel &quot;Les Mœurs&quot; was issued, because he was acquainted with the minister of the Navy, Maurepas. The book was a scandal (and a huge success, reprinted 13 times in the first year) for several reasons, including the fact that one of the treatise&#x27;s characters was assumed to be based on the oversanctimonious queen Marie Leszczynska. Parisian reader Edmond Jean François Barbier wrote in his diary that &quot;Les Mœurs&quot; had been banned and he would now have to pay double the normal price for the book.

Toussaint finally got into trouble because of his book in 1757, during the period when Robert Damiens attempted to assassinate Louis XV of France. This was the moment when &quot;Les Mœurs&quot; came to be regarded as a book that could lead to regicide. Also Toussaint illegally sold 400 copies of an illegal reprint of Claude Adrien Helvétius&#x27;s &quot;De l&#x27;esprit&quot;. He left France then, traveling first to Brussels. He published an &quot;Éclaircissement&quot; (Explanation) of &quot;Les Mœurs&quot; in 1763, in which he showed that everyone was mistaken and the book was not at all offensive. 

In 1764 he moved to Berlin. He had become an external member of the Prussian Academy of Science in 1751, but once he was settled in Berlin he was appointed a regular member of the Academy. During this time he also worked as a teacher in a military school recently founded by Frederick II of Prussia.

When he died in 1772, he was quite poor, leaving behind a wife and several children.

As for &quot;Les Mœurs&quot;, even if it were his biggest success, he felt sorry for having written it almost all his life. Parts of the book were re-used in several articles of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;.

==Literature==
A short summary is to be found in 
*&quot;The Encyclopedists as individuals: a biographical dictionary of the authors of the Encyclopédie&quot; by Frank A. Kafker and Serena L. Kafker. Published 1988 in the &quot;Studies of Voltaire and the Eighteenth century&quot;. 

It is basically an excerpt of a more extended discussion, the unpublished thesis of 
*&quot;Margaret Elinor Adams: François Vincent Toussaint: Life and Works.&quot; Dissertation, Boston University Graduate School 1966

Adams corrects several flaws and errors in previous research on Toussaint by

<doc id="933389" wikidata="Q199991" url="?curid=933389" title="Joachim of Fiore">
<text>Joachim of Fiore, also known as Joachim of Flora (; ; 1135 – 30 March 1202), was an Italian Christian theologian, Catholic abbot, and the founder of the monastic order of San Giovanni in Fiore. According to theologian Bernard McGinn, &quot;Joachim of Fiore is the most important apocalyptic thinker of the whole medieval period.&quot; The &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; of Dante Alighieri is one of the most famous works possibly inspired by his ideas.
Later followers, inspired by his works in Christian eschatology and historicist theories, are called Joachimites.
On June 27, 2024, Pope Francis, in his message for the World Day of Creation, described Joachim of Fiore, saying that &quot;Joachim was able to propose the ideal of a new spirit of coexistence among people&quot; and thus marks a turning point in history, as this had not happened in more than eight centuries since the death of the Florensis monk. 

==Biography==
Born in the small village of Celico near Cosenza, in Calabria (at the time part of the Kingdom of Sicily), Joachim was the son of Mauro de Celico, a well-placed notary, and Gemma, his wife. He was educated at Cosenza, where he became first a clerk in the courts, and then a notary himself. In 1166–1167 he worked for Stephen du Perche, archbishop of Palermo (c. 1167–1168) and counsellor of Margaret of Navarre, regent for the young William II of Sicily.

About 1159 he went on pilgrimage to the Holy Land, where he experienced a spiritual crisis and conversion in Jerusalem that turned him away from worldly life. When he returned, he lived as a hermit for several years, wandering and preaching before joining the Cistercian abbey of Sambucina near Luzzi in Calabria, as a lay brother without taking the religious habit. There he devoted his time to lay preaching. With the ecclesiastical authorities raising objections to his mode of life, Joachim joined the monks of the Abbey of Corazzo, and was ordained a priest, apparently in 1168. He applied himself entirely to Biblical study, with a special view to uncovering the arcane meanings he thought were concealed in the Scriptures, especially in the apostle John&#x27;s Revelation. To his dismay, the monks of Corazzo proclaimed him their abbot (c. 1177). He then attempted to join the monastery to the Cistercian Order, but was refused because of the community&#x27;s poverty. In the winter of 1178, he appealed in person to William II, who granted the monks some lands.

In 1182 Joachim appealed to Pope Lucius III, who relieved him of the temporal care of his abbey, and warmly approved of his work, bidding him to continue it in whatever monastery he thought best. Joachim spent the following year and a half at the Cistercian Abbey of Casamari, where he engaged in writing his three great books. There the young monk, Lucas (afterwards Archbishop of Cosenza), who acted as his secretary, was amazed to see so famous and eloquent a man wearing such rags, and the wonderful devotion with which he preached and said Mass.

In 1184 he was in Rome, interpreting an obscure prophecy found among the papers of Cardinal Matthew of Angers, and was encouraged by Pope Lucius III. Succeeding popes confirmed the papal approbation, though his manuscripts had not begun to circulate. Joachim retired first to the hermitage of Pietralata, writing all the while, and then founded the Abbey of Fiore (&quot;Flora&quot;) in the mountains of Calabria. He refused the request of King Tancred of Sicily (r. 1189–1194) to move his new religious foundation to the existing Cistercian monastery of Santa Maria della Matina.

On Good Friday in 1196, Empress Constance, also Queen of Sicily, summoned Joachim of Fiore to Palermo to hear her confession in the Palatine Chapel. Initially, the empress sat on a raised chair, but when Joachim told her that as they were at the places of Christ and Mary Magdalene, she needed to lower herself, she sat on the ground.

Fiore became the centre of a new and stricter branch of the Cistercian order, approved by Celestine III in 1198.

In 1200 Joachim publicly submitted all his writings to the examination of Innocent III, but died in 1202 before any judgment was passed. The holiness of his life was widely known: Dante affirmed that miracles were said to have been wrought at his tomb, and, though never officially beatified, he is still venerated as a &quot;beatus&quot; on May 29.

He theorized the dawn of a new age, based on his interpretation of verses in the Book of Revelation, in which the Church would be unnecessary and in which infidels would unite with Christians. Members of the spiritual wing of the Franciscan order acclaimed him as a prophet. However, Joachim denied being a prophet himself. His popularity was enormous in the period. Richard the Lionheart met with him in Messina before leaving for the Third Crusade of 1189–1192 to ask for his prophetic advice.

His famous Trinitarian &quot;IEUE&quot; interlaced-circles diagram was influenced by the different 3-circles Tetragrammaton-Trinity diagram of Petrus Alphonsi, and in turn led to the use of the Borromean rings as a symbol of the Christian Trinity (and possibly also influenced the development of the Shield of the Trinity diagram).

==Theory of the three ages==

The mystical basis of his teaching is his doctrine of the &quot;eternal gospel&quot;, founded on an interpretation of Revelation 14:6 (Rev 14:6, &quot;Then I saw another angel flying in midheaven, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on the earth—to every nation and tribe and language and people.&quot; NRSV translation.).

His theories can be considered millenarian; he believed that history, by analogy with the Trinity, was divided into three fundamental epochs:

* The Age of the Father, corresponding to the Old Testament, characterized by the obedience of mankind to the Rules of God;
* The Age of the Son, between the advent of Christ and 1260, represented by the New Testament, when Man became the son of God;
* The Age of the Holy Spirit, impending, a contemplative utopia. The Kingdom of the Holy Spirit, a new dispensation of universal love, would proceed from the Gospel of Christ, but transcend the letter of it. In this new Age the ecclesiastical organization would be replaced and the &quot;Order of the Just&quot; would rule the Church. This &quot;Order of the Just&quot; was later identified with the Franciscan order by his follower Gerardo of Borgo San Donnino.

Joachim&#x27;s idea of the Age of the Holy Spirit would also later greatly influence the Cult of the Holy Spirit which would in later centuries have a considerable impact in Portugal and its colonies, and would suffer severe persecution by the Portuguese Inquisition.

According to Joachim, only in this third age will it be possible to truly understand the words of God in their deepest meanings, and not merely literally. In this period, instead of the &quot;parousia&quot; (second Advent of Christ), a new epoch of peace and concord would begin; also, a new religious &quot;order&quot; of spiritual men would arise, thus making the present hierarchy of the Church almost unnecessary.

Joachim distinguished between the &quot;reign of justice&quot; or &quot;of law&quot; in an imperfect society, and the &quot;reign of freedom&quot; in a perfect society.

Joachim saw that a pope will be the Antichrist and that Rome represents Babylon.

==Condemnation==

Joachim&#x27;s theories were disputed by Thomas Aquinas in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; (written 1265–1274). In contrast, Dante Alighieri situated Joachim in the Paradiso of his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (composed c. 1320). Among the Spirituals, the stricter branch of the Franciscans, a Joachite group arose, many of whom saw Antichrist already in the world in the person of Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor (who died in 1250).

As the appointed year approached, spurious works began to circulate under Joachim&#x27;s name: &quot;De Oneribus Prophetarum,&quot; an &quot;Expositio Sybillae et Merlini&quot; (&quot;Exposition of the Sibyl and Merlin&quot;) and commentaries on the prophecies of Jeremiah and Isaiah. The Fourth Council of the Lateran, in 1215, condemned some of his ideas about the nature of the Trinity. In 1263, the archbishop Fiorenzo enhanced the condemnation of his writings and those of his follower Gerardo of Borgo San Donnino, joining a commission in the Synod of Arles, in which Joachim&#x27;s theories were declared heretical. The accusation was of having an unorthodox view of the Holy Trinity.

His views also inspired several subsequent movements: the Amalricians, the Dulcinians and the Brethren of the Free Spirit. All of these were eventually declared heretical by the Catholic Church. Joachimite interpretations became popular in the Protestant Reformation, and even influenced some Protestant interpretations. Joachim also possibly influenced Dante.

Of importance is the fact that Joachim himself was never condemned as a heretic by the Church; rather, the ideas and movement surrounding him were condemned. Joachim the man was held in high regard during his lifetime.

==Literary references==
It has been argued that the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; of Dante Alighieri is largely inspired by the ideas of the Abbot using the interpretation given by his follower Pietro di Giovanni Olivi, active in Florence at the end of the XIII century.

Joachim may be referred to by the 16th century English cartographer and court magician John Dee, who refers in his influential 1570 work &quot;Preface to Euclid&quot; to &quot;Ioachim the Prophesier&quot; who &quot;by &quot;Numbers Formall, Naturall, and Rationall,&quot; forseyng, concludyng, and forshewyng great particular euents, long before their comming.&quot; (Rendered in contemporary English: &quot;Joachim the Prophet, who by numbers formal, natural, and rational, foreseeing, concluding, and foretelling, great particular events, long before their coming.&quot;)

Joris-Karls Huysmans&#x27; novella &quot;Là-bas&quot; makes reference to Joachim de Fiore&#x27;s millenarian eschatology in its concluding scenes, with several characters espousing similar views; presaging the protagonist&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism.

W. B. Yeats&#x27;s short story &quot;The Tables of the Law&quot; tells about a single surviving copy of a certain book by Joachim of Flora and its powerful effects on its owner.

Joachim, referred to as Joachim Abbas, is referenced in James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot; and &quot;Giacomo Joyce&quot; and &quot;Stephen Hero&quot;.

Joachim is mentioned in Umberto Eco&#x27;s medieval mystery &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;. His influence on the Franciscan Spirituals and the rediscovery of his books foreseeing the advent of a new age are part of the book&#x27;s background story in which an inquisitorial debate is held in a remote monastery where a number of murders take place.

The sprawling conspiracy satire entitled the &quot;Illuminatus!&quot; trilogy of novels by Robert Anton Wilson and Robert Shea also reference Joachim of Fiore repeatedly. His writings fit well with the eschatological tone of the story. The authors attempt to confuse matters and give an air of authenticity to the madness of the various plotlines by including references to real people and events.

In 2023, a film inspired by the life of Joachim &quot;Joachim and the Apocalypse&quot; was produced.

==Works==


*&quot;Liber Concordiae Novi ac Veteris Testamenti&quot; (&quot;Harmony of the Old and New Testaments&quot;/&quot;Book of Concordance&quot;), completed in 1200.
*&quot;Expositio in Apocalipsim&quot; (&quot;Exposition of the Book of Revelation&quot;), finished around 1196–1199. The &quot;Liber introductoris in Apocalypsim&quot;, sometimes cited as a separate work, forms an introduction to this.
*&quot;Psalterium Decem Cordarum&quot; (&quot;Psaltery of Ten Strings&quot;).
*&quot;Tractatus super quatuor Evangelia&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the four Gospels&quot;).
*De Gloria Paradisi (Visio admirandae historiae)

Lesser works include:
*&quot;Genealogia&quot; (&quot;Genealogy&quot;), written about 1176.
*&quot;De prophetia ignota&quot;, dateable to 1184.
*&quot;Adversus Judeos&quot; (also known as &quot;Exhortatorium Iudeorum&quot;), probably written in the early 1180s.
*&quot;De articulis fidei&quot;, probably written in the early 1180s.
*&quot;Professio fidei&quot;, probably written in the early 1180s.
*&quot;Tractatus in expositionem vite et regule beati Benedicti&quot;, sermons belonging to the late 1180s.
*&quot;Praephatio super Apocalipsim&quot;. Written around 1188–1192.
*&quot;Intelligentia super calathis&quot;. Written in 1190–1.
*&quot;De ultimis tribulationibus&quot;, which is a short sermon by Joachim.
*&quot;Enchiridion super Apocalypsim&quot;. Written in 1194–6, this is an earlier and shorter version of the &quot;Liber introductorius&quot; that prefaces Joachim&#x27;s &quot;Expositio in Apocalipsim&quot;.
*&quot;De septem sigillis&quot;. It is uncertain when this was written.
*The Liber Figurarum was drawn together soon after Joachim&#x27;s death in 1202, and is a collection of 24 &#x27;figurae&#x27; drawn by Joachim. The name was used in thirteenth-century manuscripts to describe a work attributed to Joachim of Fiore, but it was only in the mid-twentieth century that it was identified in relation to three extant manuscripts.
* The late thirteenth-century set of pseudo-prophecies, united with a later series under the title &quot;Vaticinia de Summis Pontificibus&quot; was falsely attributed to Joachim of Fiore without any basis in truth.

<text>The Filmfare Critics Award for Best Film is awarded during annual Filmfare Awards, given by the Filmfare magazine. The awards are the oldest and most prominent film awards given for Hindi films in India. The yearly awards started in 1954. Movie awards were first given by popular vote. Many complained that films of artistic merit rather than commercial appeal were being overlooked, hence a new award category was added, the Best Film (Critics). The record of maximum number of wins in this category is with Mani Kaul having won four times, followed by Kumar Shahani, who won three times.

&quot;Rajnigandha&quot;, &quot;Black&quot; and &quot;Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara&quot; are the only films to win both Best Film (Critics) and Best Film.

<text>A stye, also known as a hordeolum, is a bacterial infection of an oil gland in the eyelid. This results in a red tender bump at the edge of the eyelid. The outside or the inside of the eyelid can be affected.
The cause of a stye is usually a bacterial infection by &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. Internal styes are due to infection of the meibomian gland while external styes are due to an infection of the gland of Zeis. A chalazion on the other hand is a blocked meibomian gland without infection. A chalazion is typically in the middle of the eyelid and not painful.
Often a stye will go away without any specific treatment in a few days or weeks. Recommendations to speed improvement include warm compresses. Occasionally antibiotic eye ointment may be recommended. While these measures are often recommended, there is little evidence for use in internal styes. The frequency at which styes occur is unclear, though they may occur at any age.

==Signs and symptoms==
The first sign of a stye is a small, yellowish spot at the center of the bump that develops as pus and expands in the area.

Other stye symptoms may include:
* A lump on the top or bottom eyelid
* Localized swelling of the eyelid
* Localized pain
* Redness
* Tenderness
* Crusting of the eyelid margins
* Burning in the eye
* Droopiness of the eyelid
* Scratchy sensation on the eyeball (itching)
* Blurred vision
* Mucous discharge in the eye
* Irritation of the eye
* Light sensitivity
* Tearing
* Discomfort during blinking
* Sensation of a foreign body in the eye

===Complications===

Stye complications occur in very rare cases. However, the most frequent complication of styes is progression to a chalazion that causes cosmetic deformity, corneal irritation, and often requires surgical removal. Complications may also arise from the improper surgical lancing, and mainly consist of disruption of lash growth, lid deformity or lid fistula. Large styes may interfere with one&#x27;s vision.

Eyelid cellulitis is another potential complication of eye styes, which is a generalized infection of the eyelid. Progression of a stye to a systemic infection (spreading throughout the body) is extremely rare, and only a few instances of such spread have been recorded.

==Cause==
A stye is caused by a bacterial infection. The bacteria are &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; in about 95% of cases. The infection leads to the blocking of an oil gland at the base of the eyelash. Styes are experienced by people of all ages. Styes can be triggered by poor nutrition, sleep deprivation, lack of hygiene, lack of water, and rubbing of the eyes. Styes can be secondary to blepharitis or a deficiency in immunoglobulin.

==Prevention==
Stye prevention is closely related to proper hygiene. Proper hand washing can reduce the risks of developing not only styes, but also many other types of infections.

Upon awakening, application of a warm washcloth to the eyelids for one to two minutes may be beneficial in decreasing the occurrence of styes by liquefying the contents of the oil glands of the eyelid and thereby preventing blockage.

To prevent styes, cosmetics and cosmetic eye tools should not be shared among people. Like with all infections, regular hand washing is essential, and the eyes should not be rubbed or touched with unclean hands. Contaminated eye makeup should be discarded and sharing of washcloths or face towels should be curtailed, to avoid spreading the infection between individuals. Breaking the stye may spread bacteria contained in the pus and should be avoided.

==Treatment==
Most cases of styes resolve on their own within one to two weeks, without professional care. The primary treatment is application of warm compresses. As a part of self-care at home, people may cleanse the affected eyelid with tap water or with a mild, nonirritating soap or shampoo (such as baby shampoo) to help clean crusted discharge. Cleansing must be done gently and while the eyes are closed to prevent eye injuries.

People with styes should avoid eye makeup (e.g., eyeliner), lotions, and wearing contact lenses, since these can aggravate and spread the infection (sometimes to the cornea). People are advised not to lance the stye themselves, as serious infection can occur. Pain relievers such as acetaminophen may be used.

===Antibiotics===
Evidence to support the use of antibiotic eye ointment is poor. Occasionally erythromycin ophthalmic ointment is recommended. Other antibiotics, such as chloramphenicol or amoxicillin may also be used. Chloramphenicol is used successfully in many parts of the world, but contains a black box warning in the United States due to concerns about aplastic anemia, which on rare occasions can be fatal.

Antibiotics are normally given to people with multiple styes or with styes that do not seem to heal, and to people who have blepharitis or rosacea.

===Procedures===
Incision and drainage is performed if resolution does not begin in the next 48 hours after warm compresses are started. Medical professionals will sometimes lance a particularly persistent or irritating stye with a needle to accelerate its draining.

Surgery is the last resort in stye treatment. Styes that do not respond to any type of therapies are usually surgically removed. Stye surgery is performed by an ophthalmologist, and generally under local anesthesia. The procedure consists of making a small incision on the inner or outer surface of the eyelid, depending if the stye is pointing externally or not. After the incision is made, the pus is drained out of the gland, and very small sutures are used to close the lesion. Sometimes the removed stye is sent for a histopathological examination to investigate possibility of skin cancer.

===Alternative medicine===
A 2017 Cochrane review found low-certainty and low-quality evidence that acupuncture helps in hordeolum compared with antibiotics or warm compresses. as well as that acupuncture plus conventional treatment may yield improvement, though they could not rule out placebo or observer effect, since the studies reviewed either had no positive control, were not blinded, or both.

==Prognosis==
Although styes are harmless in most cases and complications are very rare, styes often recur. They do not cause intraocular damage, meaning they do not affect the eye. Styes normally heal on their own by rupturing within a few days to a week causing the relief of symptoms, but if one does not improve or it worsens within two weeks, a doctor&#x27;s opinion should be sought. Few people require surgery as part of stye treatment. With adequate treatment, styes tend to heal quickly and without complications.

The prognosis is better if one does not attempt to squeeze or puncture the stye, as infection may spread to adjacent tissues. Also, patients are recommended to call a doctor if they encounter problems with vision, the eyelid bump becomes very painful, the stye bleeds or reoccurs, or the eyelid or eyes becomes red.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;stye&quot; (first recorded in the 17th century) is probably a back-formation from &quot;styany&quot; (first recorded in the 15th century), which in turn comes from &quot;styan&quot; plus &quot;eye&quot;, the former of which in turn comes from the old English &quot;stīġend&quot;, meaning &quot;riser&quot;, from the verb &quot;stīgan&quot;, &quot;to rise&quot;. The older form &quot;styan&quot; is still used in Ulster Scots today.

The homonym &quot;sty&quot; found in the combination &quot;pigsty&quot; has a slightly different origin, namely it comes from the Old English &quot;stiġ-fearh&quot;—&quot;fearh&quot; (farrow) is the Old English word for &quot;piglet&quot;—where &quot;stiġ&quot; meant &quot;hall&quot; (cf. &quot;steward&quot;), possibly an early Old Norse loanword, which could be cognate with the word &quot;stīgan&quot; above.

The synonymous late Latin expression is &quot;hordeolum&quot;, a modulation of the word &quot;hordeolus&quot;, which is related to &quot;hordeum&quot; (&quot;barley&quot;), after its resemblance to a barleycorn. In Czech, a sty is called &quot;ječné zrno&quot; (from &quot;ječmen&quot; &quot;barley&quot; and &quot;zrno&quot; &quot;seed or grain&quot;); in German, it is called &quot;Gerstenkorn&quot; (barleycorn). In Hebrew it is called שעורה Seh-oh-Ráh (&quot;barley&quot;). In Polish it is called &quot;jęczmień&quot; (&quot;barley&quot;). In Hungarian it is called &quot;árpa&quot; (&quot;barley&quot;). In Turkish it is called &quot;arpacık&quot; (small barley, barleylet)

<text>The Riace bronzes (Italian: &quot;Bronzi di Riace&quot;, ), also called the Riace Warriors, are two full-size Greek bronze statues of naked bearded warriors, cast about 460–450 BC that were found in the sea in 1972 near Riace, Calabria, in southern Italy. The bronzes are now in the Museo Nazionale della Magna Grecia in the nearby city of Reggio Calabria. They are two of the few surviving full-size ancient Greek bronzes (which were usually melted down in later times), and as such demonstrate the technical craftsmanship and artistic features that were achieved at this time.

The bronzes are now on display inside a microclimate room on top of an anti-seismic platform faced in Carrara marble. Along with the bronzes, the room also contains two head sculptures: Testa del Filosofo and Testa di Basilea, which are also from the 5th century BC.

Although the bronzes were discovered in 1972, they did not emerge from conservation until 1981. Their public display in Florence and Rome was the cultural event of that year in Italy, providing the cover story for numerous magazines. Now considered one of the symbols of Calabria, the bronzes were commemorated by a pair of Italian postage stamps and have also been widely reproduced.

The two bronze sculptures are simply known as “Statue A”, referring to the one portraying a younger warrior, and “Statue B”, indicating the more mature-looking of the two. Both sculptures were made using the lost-wax casting technique.

==Discovery==
There is still debate on who found the statues. One theory states that Stefano Mariottini, then a chemist from Rome, chanced upon the bronzes while snorkeling near the end of a vacation at Monasterace. While diving some 200 metres from the coast of Riace, at a depth of six to eight metres, Mariottini noticed the left arm of statue A emerging from the sand. At first he thought he had found a dead human body, but on touching the arm he realized it was a bronze arm. Mariottini began to push the sand away from the rest of statue A. Later, he noticed the presence of another bronze nearby and decided to inform the cultural departement in Reggio Calabria. 

The other theory, which is usually less widely accepted, is that it was found by four young teenagers from Riace itself. Having found the statues underwater, they went to the government finances office, in nearby Monasterace, where they declared their find. 

One week later, on August 21, statue B was taken out of the water, and statue A was taken out two days after. No associated wreck site has been identified, but in the immediate locality, which is a subsiding coast, architectural remains have also been found.

The bronzes and the story of their discovery were featured in the first episode of the 2005 BBC television documentary series &quot;How Art Made the World&quot;, which included an interview with Stefano Mariottini.

In his book &quot;Facce di Bronzo&quot;, published in 2008, the bronze expert Giuseppe Braghò has revealed that the official finding records of 1972, based on Mariottini declarations, reported the presence not only of a helmet and a shield, but also of a third bronze statue with open arms, none of which was taken out of the water during the official recovery. These archaeological finds are believed to have been stolen days before the official recovery and sold to a collector abroad. Evidence that statue A and statue B were found in a different position at the time of official recovery, compared to what was reported and registered at the time of discovery is also given, suggesting that attempts to remove the statues from the place of discovery had occurred.

In summer 2019, the Italian TV show &quot;Le Iene&quot; started an enquiry in relation to the mystery of the missing archaeological finds at the Riace site, and interviewed Mariottini asking clarifications about his declarations at the time of discovery. Mariottini refused to comment.

== History and origin ==
At the time the sculptures were made, much of Calabria (especially the coastal cities) was inhabited by Greek-speaking peoples as part of Magna Graecia (&quot;Greater Greece&quot;), as the &quot;overseas&quot; Greek territories came to be called. The most popular theory is that two separate Greek artists created the bronzes about 30 years apart around the 5th century BC. “Statue A” was probably created between the years 460 and 450 BC, and “Statue B” between 430 and 420 BC. Some believe that “Statue A” was the work of Myron, and that a pupil of Phidias, called Alkamenes, created “Statue B”. Statue A portrays a young warrior hero or god with a proud look, conscious of his own beauty and power. Statue B, on the other hand, portrays an older more mature warrior hero with a relaxed pose and a kind and gentle gaze.

The Riace bronzes are major additions to the surviving examples of ancient Greek sculpture. They belong to a transitional period from archaic Greek sculpture to the early Classical style, disguising their idealized geometry and impossible anatomy under a distracting and alluring &quot;realistic&quot; surface. They are fine examples of &quot;contrapposto&quot; - their weight is on the back legs, making them much more realistic than with many other Archaic stances. Their musculature is clear, yet not incised, and looks soft enough to be visible and realistic. The bronzes&#x27; turned heads not only confer movement, but also add life to the figures. The asymmetrical layout of their arms and legs adds realism to them. The eyes of Statue A are formed of calcite (originally supposed to be ivory), while their teeth are made with silver. Their lips and nipples are made of copper. At one time, they held spears and shields, but those have not been found. Additionally, Warrior B once wore a helmet pushed up over his head, and it is thought that Warrior A may have worn a wreath over his. The average thickness of the bronze is 8.5 mm (0.33 inch) for Statue A and 7.5 mm (0.3 inches) for Statue B.

===Origin===

It is generally assumed that the statues were being carried on a ship that sank, perhaps in a storm, although no evidence of a wreck has been found. It is not impossible that the statues were on their way to a local destination, either near the time of their creation or later. Further explorations undertaken in 2004 by a joint Italian-American team of archaeologists identified the foundations of an Ionic temple on this slowly subsiding coast. Undersea explorations by robotic vehicles along the submerged coastline from Locri to Soverato are providing a more detailed picture of this coast in Antiquity, although no further bronzes comparable to those of Riace have been found.

Attributions of such spectacular works of art to famous sculptors have followed traditional lines: &quot;all the &#x27;big&#x27; names of Classical times have been proposed in this connection&quot;, Brunilde Sismondo Ridgway writes, noting that she finds it encouraging that at least a few scholars are willing to consider a non-Attic, even a &#x27;colonial&#x27; workshop of origin, as contrasted with &quot;the dominant Athenocentrism of previous years.&quot;

While it is certain that the bronzes are original works of the highest quality, it has also been argued that their torsos have been produced from a single model, which was then altered with direct modifications to the wax before casting, so that they may be seen as &quot;types&quot;.

==Identification==

There is no clear testimony in ancient literature to identify the athletes or heroes depicted by the bronzes. It seems that the two nudes originally formed part of a votive group in a large sanctuary. It is conjectured that the bronze sculptures may represent Tydeus and Amphiaraus respectively, two of the warriors from the Seven against Thebes monumental group in the polis of Argos, as Pausanias noted. 
However, they may also be Athenian warriors from Delphi, part of the monument to the Battle of Marathon, or they may come from Olympia. Argos, Delphi and Olympia were three prominent Greek sites for dedicated sculpture of the highest quality, and all three were vulnerable to official plundering following the Roman occupation. Perhaps the bronzes were being transported, long after they were created, to Italy as part of one of the waves of large-scale plundering of Greek art that occurred at various dates after the Roman conquest of Greece. 

Salvatore Settis and Vinzenz Brinkmann (Liebieghaus Polychromy Research Project) identify the warriors as Erechtheus, son of Athena, and Eumolpos, son of Poseidon. A group of two bronze statues depicting Erechtheus and Eumolpos near to the temple of Athena on the Athenian acropolis is mentioned by Pausanias 1.27.4:

“... large bronze figures of men facing each other for a fight, one of whom they call Erechtheus, the other Eumolpos ...”

==2009–2011 restoration==
In December 2009, the Riace Bronzes were transported to the Palazzo Campanella in Reggio before restoration work began on the Museo Nazionale della Magna Grecia. In early 2010, expert art restorers Cosimo Schepis (also known as Nuccio Schepis) and Paola Donati began restoration work on the Riace bronzes. Restoration work on the two bronze sculptures was completed in 2011.

<doc id="933398" wikidata="Q296936" url="?curid=933398" title="Tonne of oil equivalent">
<text>The tonne of oil equivalent (toe) is a unit of energy defined as the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of crude oil. It is approximately 42 gigajoules or 11.630 megawatt-hours, although as different crude oils have different calorific values, the exact value is defined by convention; several slightly different definitions exist. The &quot;toe&quot; is sometimes used for large amounts of energy.

Multiples of the &quot;toe&quot; are used, in particular the megatoe (Mtoe, one million toe) and the gigatoe (Gtoe, one billion toe). A smaller unit of kilogram of oil equivalent (kgoe or koe) is also sometimes used denoting 1/1000 toe.

==Definitions==
The International Energy Agency defines one &quot; tonne of oil equivalent&quot; (toe) to be equal to:
*1 toe = 11.63 megawatt-hours (MWh)
*1 toe = 41.868 gigajoules (GJ)
*1 toe = 10 gigacalories (Gcal) – 
*1 toe = 39,683,207.2 British thermal units (BTU)
*1 toe = 1.42857143 tonnes of coal equivalent (tce)

Conversion into other units:
*1 toe = 7.33 barrels of oil equivalent (boe)

Some other sources and publications use divergent definitions of toe, for example:
*1 toe = 10.7 gigacalories (Gcal) – 
*1 toe = 41.85 gigajoules (GJ)
*1 toe = 44.769 gigajoules (GJ) – 
*1 toe = 39,683,205.411 British thermal units (BTU)

==Conversion factors==
*1 barrel of oil equivalent (boe) contains approximately 0.136 toe (i.e. there are approximately 7.33 boe in a toe).
*1 t diesel = 1.01 toe
*1 m3 diesel = 0.98 toe
*1 t petrol = 1.05 toe
*1 m3 petrol = 0.86 toe
*1 t biodiesel = 0.86 toe
*1 m3 biodiesel = 0.78 toe
*1 t bioethanol = 0.64 toe
*1 m3 bioethanol = 0.51 toe
*1 MWh = 0.086 toe (therefore 1 toe = 11630.0 kWh) 
*At thermal power plants, 1 MWh is generated with 0.22 toe fuel or 0.39 MWh with 0.086 toe (39% thermal to electrical conversion efficiency)

Tonne of oil equivalent should be used carefully when converting electrical units. For instance, BP&#x27;s 2022 report used a factor of 40% efficiency (the average efficiency of a standard thermal power plant in 2017), or roughly 16.8 GJ per toe, when converting kilowatt-hours to toe. BP&#x27;s model is also based on the assumption that efficiency will increase linearly to 45% by 2050. 

==Derived units==
For multiples of the tonne of oil equivalent, it is more usual to speak of millions of tonnes of oil equivalent and kilotonnes of oil equivalent (ktoe).

<text>Right-bank Ukraine is a historical and territorial name for a part of modern Ukraine on the right (west) bank of the Dnieper River, corresponding to the modern-day oblasts of Vinnytsia, Zhytomyr, Kirovohrad, as well as the western parts of Kyiv and Cherkasy. It was separated from the left bank during the Ruin.

Right-bank Ukraine is bordered by the historical regions of Volhynia and Podolia to the west, Moldavia to the southwest, Yedisan and Zaporizhzhia to the south, left-bank Ukraine to the east, and Polesia to the north.

Main cities of the region include Cherkasy, Kropyvnytskyi, Bila Tserkva, Zhytomyr and Oleksandriia.

==History==
Since the Middle Ages, the region formed part of the Khazar Khanate, Kievan Rus&#x27;, Mongol Empire, Golden Horde, Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland.

The history of right- and left-bank Ukraine is closely associated with the Khmelnytsky Uprising of 1648–57. The territory was part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth under the House of Vasa until the Russo-Polish War triggered by Khmelnytsky&#x27;s Treaty of Pereyaslav, 1654, with the Muscovy alliance. After the 13-year conflict, the victorious Tsardom of Russia incorporated the left-bank Ukraine along with the city of Kiev in 1667 following the Truce of Andrusovo.
Meanwhile, right-bank Ukraine remained in the Commonwealth until the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century. As part of the Lesser Poland Province it was divided into two voivodeships: Kiev and Bracław. In 1669 Hetman Petro Doroshenko allowed right-bank Ukraine to be part of the Ottoman Empire. The southernmost Podolia in the right-bank Ukraine was invaded by Ottomans in 1672. 

Following the 1683 victory of the Christian powers in the Battle of Vienna, in 1699 the Treaty of Karlowitz returned those lands to the Commonwealth. During the 18th century, two Cossack uprisings took place. In 1793 right-bank Ukraine was annexed by the Russian Empire in the Second Partition of Poland, becoming part of the &quot;guberniya&quot; (&#x27;governorate&#x27;) of Little Russia.

In the 19th century, the population of right-bank Ukraine was mostly Ukrainian, but most of the land was owned by the Polish or Polonized Ukrainian nobility. Many of the towns and cities belonged to the Pale of Settlement and had a substantial Jewish population, while the Polish-speaking nobility was mostly Roman Catholic. Most of the peasantry became Greek Catholic only in the 18th century, and after the Partitions of Poland, largely converted to Orthodoxy long before the disestablishment of the Unia in 1839. The right-bank Ukraine was subsequently divided into four provinces (guberniyas), each with its own administration: Kiev, Volhynia, Kherson and Podolia.

<text>Left-bank Ukraine (; ; ) is a historic name of the part of Ukraine on the left (east) bank of the Dnieper River, comprising the modern-day oblasts of Chernihiv, Poltava and Sumy as well as the eastern parts of Kyiv and Cherkasy.

Left-bank Ukraine is bordered by the historical regions of Right-bank Ukraine to the southwest, Zaporizhzhia to the southeast, Sloboda Ukraine to the east, and Polesia and White Ruthenia to the north.

== History ==
Since the Middle Ages, the region formed part of the Khazar Khanate, Kievan Rus&#x27;, Mongol Empire, Golden Horde, Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland.

The term appeared in 1663 with the election of Ivan Bryukhovetsky as the hetman of Ukraine in opposition to Pavlo Teteria. Bryukhovetsky was the first known &quot;left-bank Ukraine&quot; hetman over the area, that was under the Russian influence.

Up until the mid-17th century, the area had belonged to the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. The Treaty of Pereyaslav of 1654 saw the region tentatively come under Russian control, when local Cossack leaders swore allegiance to the Russian monarchy in exchange for military protection. Russian sovereignty over the area was later reaffirmed in the Treaty of Andrusovo (1667), and the Eternal Peace Treaty (1686) between the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and Tsardom of Russia.

Under Russian rule, the left-bank Ukraine initially enjoyed a degree of autonomy within the Tsardom (from 1721, Imperial Russia) as the Cossack Hetmanate, which was slowly withdrawn throughout the eighteenth century when the Zaporizhian Sich was destroyed.

<text>Aintree Racecourse is a racecourse in Aintree, Metropolitan Borough of Sefton, Merseyside, England, bordering the city of Liverpool. The racecourse is the venue for the Grand National steeplechase, which takes place annually in April over three days. Aintree also holds meetings in May, October (Sunday), November and December (both Saturdays).

The Aintree Racecourse had suffered three major disruptions in post-war history, starting with the 1993 Grand National due to a series of false starts and no winner was announced, followed by the 1997 Grand National, postponed to Monday because of an IRA bomb threat and the 2023 Grand National was delayed due to Animal Rights protesters. 

==History of the course==
Horse racing was popular in Liverpool from at least Tudor times, In the 18th century Nicholas Blundell organised races on the sands at Crosby.

In 1829, William Lynn, the owner of the Waterloo Hotel in Ranelagh Street, Liverpool, approached the Second Earl of Sefton, William Philip Molyneux, whose nickname was &#x27;Lord Dashalong&#x27;, about leasing land to organise flat racing.

Lord Sefton liked racing, so he agreed. He laid the foundation stone on 7 February 1829, and placed a container of sovereigns inside the footings. Lynn built a grandstand in time for the first meeting at Aintree racecourse on 7 July 1829, designed by John Foster Jr. The opening race was the Croxteth Stakes over 1 mile 2 furlongs, and was won by Mufti. In 1835 Lynn organised hurdle racing, which was a great success, especially when a well-known, rider, Captain Martin Becher, agreed to take part and rode a horse named Vivian to two victories. The story goes that Becher told Lynn about the Great St. Albans Steeplechase, a four-mile point-to-point race across country, which was first run in 1830. This caught Lynn&#x27;s imagination and he decided that he wanted a similar race at Aintree.

With Becher&#x27;s help Lynn organised the Liverpool Grand Steeplechase, first run on 29 February 1836. There were ten runners, to be ridden by gentlemen riders only, all carrying twelve stone, with the winner, sold if demanded. for two hundred sovereigns. Captain Becher (after whom Becher&#x27;s Brook is named) rode The Duke to victory. The winner was owned by Mr Sirdfield, landlord of the George Inn at Great Crosby. Some racing historians regard this 1836 race as the first Grand National, but most favour the 1839 event as the inaugural one. The Duke won again in 1837, Sir William in 1838. There is even some disagreement as to the venue for the 1836 to 1838 races, with the nearby Maghull (which was opened in 1827 by a landowner, John Formby) having its supporters.

By 1839 the aristocracy was taking an interest: Lords Derby, Eglinton, Wilton, Sefton and Lord George Bentinck backed a national racing event at Aintree. The race was named the &#x27;Grand Liverpool Steeplechase&#x27; and advertised as being &quot;four miles across country&quot; – though starting and finishing on the established racecourse. There were 29 obstacles, including a stone wall five feet high, and about a mile from the stands a &quot;strong paling, next a rough, high jagged hedge, and lastly a brook about six feet wide.&quot; As the runners approached that obstacle, Captain Becher led the field on Conrad, who hit the obstacle hard causing Becher to fall into the brook. As he came out of the brook, Becher is reputed to have said that &quot;water is no damned use without brandy!&quot; Lottery, ridden by Jem Mason, won at 9/1, followed by Seventy-Four and Paulina, both 12/1. The 6/1 favourite, The Nun, failed to finish. There were seventeen runners. That first &#x27;National&#x27; attracted a crowd of about 50,000.

In the following years the race became very popular, though William Lynn&#x27;s health suffered and his interest in racing lessened. Another member of the syndicate, Edward William Topham, who was also a racing handicapper, took over as the leading influence at Aintree. In 1843 he turned the &#x27;National&#x27; from a weight-for-age race into a handicap. The race officially became the &#x27;Grand National&#x27; in 1847; the following year Topham took on the lease of the course from Lord Sefton.

The Grand National, and with it Aintree racecourse grew in popularity throughout the second half of the 19th century. The &#x27;National&#x27; was, by a long way, the most valuable and most important race in the national hunt calendar.

The 1914 Grand National was held a few months before the start of the First World War; the 1915 race was also run at Aintree but a year later Aintree was requisitioned by the War Office, so a substitute race, named the &#x27;Racecourse Association Steeplechase&#x27; was held in 1916, 1917 and 1918 at Gatwick (on the site where the airport was later built) in Sussex. The Grand National returned to Aintree in 1919.

During the Second World War there was one race won by BOGSCAR in 1940 at Aintree as the course had been requisitioned for use as a storage depot with hundreds of servicemen from the USA being stationed there. The course opened again on 4 April 1946 for the Spring Meeting, with the Grand National being run on the Friday, the second day of the three-day meeting. It was first run on Saturday in 1947.

In 1949 Messrs. Tophams bought the racecourse outright from Lord Sefton after leasing the course for 100 years. To celebrate this purchase, the Topham Trophy, a handicap steeplechase over 2 miles 6 furlongs of the Grand National course was introduced as the main race on the first day of the National meeting.

In December 1953 the Mildmay steeplechase course was opened with smaller versions of the Grand National fences. This two-day fixture was the first all National Hunt meeting ever staged at Aintree.

In July 1964 Mrs Topham announced that she intended selling the racecourse to a property developer, Capital &amp; Counties, to build housing. This started the era of the &quot;last Grand National&quot; which lasted for about twenty years. There was talk of the Grand National being transferred to Doncaster.

1973 saw the last Grand National meeting run by the Topham family as Aintree was bought by a local property developer, Bill Davies. A low ebb was reached in 1975 when the attendance at the Grand National was the lowest anyone could remember, largely because Bill Davies tripled admission prices. The National meeting was revived in 1976 under Ladbrokes&#x27; management and a new clerk of the course, John Hughes (although Bill Davies still owned the course). The first day of the Spring Meeting saw the final flat race run at Aintree, the Knowsley Stakes over 1 mile 5 furlongs; the final two days, including Grand National day were all National Hunt events. In 1977 all three days of the &#x27;National&#x27; meeting were National Hunt for the first time, and have continued to be so.

The uncertainty about the future of the course was finally removed in December 1983 when the Jockey Club bought the course from Bill Davies.

Most of Aintree&#x27;s old stands were demolished in 1985, leaving just the County Stand. A temporary stand, the Aintree Stand, was erected. The County Stand was renovated and extended in 1988. Three years later the temporary stands were replaced by a permanent one, opened by and named after the Queen Mother.

In 1993, the race was not held due to a series of false starts. 

In 1995 Red Rum, the only horse to win the Grand National three times, died in October and was buried near the winning post. A statue to the horse had been unveiled at the course on Grand National day in 1988.

In 1997 part of the County Stand was demolished to prepare for a new grandstand. Also in 1997, the race was postponed to Monday because of an IRA bomb threat. In 1998 a new stand, named after the Princess Royal, was opened.

2006 saw the start of extensive re-development of the racecourse. A new parade ring, weighing room and winners&#x27; enclosure were opened. The old weighing room was turned into a wine bar and museum. A year later two further grandstands were opened, named after the Earl of Derby and Lord Sefton.

In 2015 the old weighing room and winners&#x27; enclosure were named &#x27;McCoys&#x27; to honour the jockey A. P. McCoy, who had ridden in his final Grand National.

In 2023, the race was delayed because of the Animal Rising protesters.

== Courses ==
There are three courses at Aintree: the Grand National course, the Mildmay steeplechase course, and the Hurdles&#x27; course

=== Grand National course ===

The Grand National course is a left-handed triangular shaped course of about 2 miles 2 furlongs, with 16 fences, including three open ditches and a water jump. The fences range in height from 4 ft 6 ins to 5 ft 2 ins (&#x27;The Chair&#x27;, one of the open ditches, and the largest fence on the course). Some of the fences have a drop – a lower landing side than take off side. These include Becher&#x27;s Brook, the 6th and 22nd fence in the Grand National, although its drop has been reduced in recent years.

It is regarded as the most difficult of all courses to complete successfully, with the fences including obstacles such the Chair, Foinavon, Valentine&#x27;s, Canal Turn and Becher&#x27;s Brook. All fences bar the water jump are covered with spruce, unlike at any other course in British National Hunt racing.

Four other races take place over the National fences. These are the Topham Trophy Chase (reverting to its original name in 2002 after being known as the John Hughes Trophy Chase since 1989) and the Fox Hunters&#x27; Chase at the Grand National meeting, and the Grand Sefton Handicap Chase and Becher Chase in the December meeting.

The fences have been modified down the years to make them less severe. In 1961 all the plain fences were sloped on the take-off side. In 1990 the brooks at Becher&#x27;s and Valentine&#x27;s were filled in, while the landing side of Becher&#x27;s was raised to reduce the drop.

In 2011 the drop on the landing side of the first fence was reduced, and the height of the fourth fence was reduced by two inches for 4 ft 10 in. In the same year the drop at Becher&#x27;s was reduced again, by four to five inches.

=== Mildmay Course ===

The Mildmay Course was named in honour of Lord Anthony Mildmay (1909-1950), who was champion amateur jockey four times and rode in several Grand Nationals. He felt there should be a &#x27;nursery&#x27; course at Aintree, with smaller versions of the &#x27;National&#x27; fences to provide an introduction to potential future runners in the Grand National to Aintree&#x27;s unique fences.

The course opened in December 1953 with a two-day Yuletide meeting. The benefit of the Mildmay course was that it enabled Aintree for the first time to stage all National Hunt cards. Previously it could hold only flat programmes or mixed meetings of flat and jumps races. The course, a left-handed oval, was a little over 1 mile 2 furlongs round, with eight fences, two of which were used in the Grand National: fence number 13 and 29 in the Grand National, which was the second of the four plain fences in the home straight on the Mildmay Course, and the water jump. There were three fences along the back straight: an open ditch, a plain fence and another open ditch. Races were run over two distances: 2 miles 80 yards, and 3 miles 1 furlong 130 yards. The course was regarded as sharp.

The course was not popular with most trainers, and the races on the Mildmay course attracted small fields. The Mildmay course was used only once at the Grand National meeting, for the Mildmay &#x27;Chase, a race over 2 miles 80 yards for novices, on the second day of the meeting.

In 1975 Bill Davies replaced the spruce fences of the Mildmay course with standard birch fences. In 1990 the Mildmay course was changed: the water jump was no longer used, while a &#x27;cross fence&#x27; on the bend into the home straight replaced one of the plain fences in the home straight, creating a long run between the final two fences. There were now four fences down the back straight, including an open ditch.

=== Hurdles&#x27; Course ===

The Hurdles&#x27; Course was the flat course, and is the oldest of Aintree&#x27;s three courses. It is a left-handed oval of about 1 mile 3 furlongs, with sharp bends. There are six flights of hurdles: three down the back straight, three in the home straight.

The final flat race at Aintree took place on the first day of the Grand National meeting in 1976. Flat races of five furlongs were run on a straight course which ran diagonally across the centre of the Mildmay course.

On this course on 7 April 1967, on the day before the Foinavon Grand National, on his first visit to Aintree, the two-year-old Red Rum, ridden by Paul Cook, dead-heated with Curlicue in a five-furlong selling plate. The running rails for this course remained in place until 1987.

== The Grand National ==
The Grand National race was run for many years over 4 miles 856 yards (4 miles 3 furlongs 196 yards), then 4 miles 4 furlongs. In 2013 the start was moved 110 yards to keep the horses away from the noise of the crowd before the start. The distance of the race is now after being re-measured by the British Horseracing Authority in 2015. The race is considered among the most demanding steeplechases in the world. The lead has often changed hands during the run-in after the final fence. There are usually 40 horses taking part in the race (this has been the maximum since 1984) but fewer than ten may actually complete the course: for example, 42 horses started in 1928, and only two reached the finishing post. The record for the most victories in the Grand National is held by Red Rum, who won three times in the 1970s, in addition to coming second twice.

===Disruptions at the Aintree Racecourse===

There were several disruptions at Aintree Racecourse starting with the 1993 Grand National and it was not held because of a series of false starts. The 1997 Grand National was postponed to Monday because of an IRA bomb threat which led the evacuation of 60,000 people and the 2023 Grand National was disrupted by the Animal Rising protesters.

==Notable races==
== Other events ==
=== Motor racing ===
Aintree has also been used as a venue for motor racing. The British Grand Prix was staged there on five occasions, in 1955, 1957, 1959, 1961 and 1962. In addition to the Grand Prix, the circuit also held 11 non-championship Formula 1 races, known as the Aintree 200, first won by Stirling Moss in 1954 with the last winner being Jack Brabham, in April 1964.

The only driver to have competed in both horse and motor races at Aintree is Alfonso de Portago, who rode in the Grand National in 1950 and 1952 as well as driving a Ferrari 750 Monza in the Daily Telegraph International Meeting in October 1955. He was set to compete at the 1957 British Grand Prix at Aintree, but he was killed in the Mille Miglia in May of that year.

=== Music ===
* Michael Jackson concluded the European leg of his 1987–1989 Bad World Tour at the venue on 11 September 1988, to more than 125,000 people. Also Jackson planned to perform here in 1992 during his Dangerous World Tour, but these plans were cancelled.
* P!nk performed at the venue during her I&#x27;m Not Dead Tour on 16 July 2007.
* Kaiser Chiefs and the Chemical Brothers performed in concert at Aintree Pavilion as part of &quot;Liverpool Music Week 2007&quot;.

===Golf===

The racecourse contains a 9-hole golf course and driving range within its boundaries. Features such as Becher&#x27;s Brook are incorporated into the course. It is accessed from Melling Road, which bisects the racecourse. Because of this, the golf facilities are closed when the course is used for horse or motor racing.

===Transport links===
Aintree racecourse was served by two railway stations: Aintree Racecourse railway station, which opened in about 1890, and Aintree Sefton Arms, which opened in 1849. The racecourse station was last used on Grand National day, 25 March 1961, and closed a year later. Aintree Sefton Arms became Aintree in 1968 and remains open.

<text>Cautley Spout is England&#x27;s highest (cascade) waterfall above ground. (Gaping Gill on Ingleborough falls a greater unbroken distance into a pothole, and Hardraw Force has a greater unbroken fall above ground). The broken cascade of falls tumbles a total of 650 feet (198 m) down a cliff face at the head of a wild and bleak glacial valley that comes down from a high plateau called The Calf. It is located in the Howgill Fells, traditionally in the West Riding of Yorkshire but now in the administrative county of Cumbria on the western edge of the Yorkshire Dales National Park. The waterfall is just north of Sedbergh. This fall is one of the few cascade falls in England; most are either tiered or plunge falls.

<doc id="933433" wikidata="Q12062049" url="?curid=933433" title="Morrison Bridge">
<text>The Morrison Bridge is a bascule bridge that spans the Willamette River in Portland, Oregon. Completed in 1958, it is the third bridge at approximately the same site to carry that name. It is one of the most heavily used bridges in Portland. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in November 2012.

==Predecessors==
The original Morrison Bridge (or Morrison Street Bridge) was a wooden truss swing-span bridge that opened to the public on April 9, 1887 (with a formal opening three days later), as the first Willamette River bridge in Portland and the longest bridge west of the Mississippi River. It was named for the street it carried, which had been named for John L. Morrison, a Scottish immigrant who built the first home on Morrison Street. It was first a toll bridge (rates: horse-drawn rig - US$0.15, team of horses - $0.20, pedestrian - $0.05) but went toll-free in 1895. The second Morrison was another swing bridge that was built in 1905. It was not designed for automobiles and the 1958 replacement was long overdue.

The first Morrison Bridge carried horsecars starting in March 1888, about a year after the bridge opened. Electric streetcars, introduced in Portland in November 1889, replaced horsecar service on the bridge in stages starting in 1890. Streetcars also crossed the second (1905) Morrison bridge, but not the third (1958), as the last lines of Portland&#x27;s past streetcar system had been abandoned by the time it opened.

==History of present bridge==
The present bridge was built by Multnomah County. It was completed on May 24, 1958, at a cost of $12.9 million. In 1961, Interstate 5 and Interstate 84 ramps were added.
In 1987, the Morrison Bridge became the first bridge illuminated by the Willamette Light Brigade. In 2007, the original 16 colored floodlamps illuminating the concrete piers were replaced by energy-efficient and computer-controlled LEDs. Different colors may be selected for each of eight zones of the piers. Static and animated patterns may be requested for a fee which ranges from $100 per night to $1200 per month (as of 2009).

Access for bicycles and pedestrians was improved in a $1.9 million project which began construction in March 2009 and added a barrier-separated path on the south side. Previously, there were only narrow sidewalks. In 2011–12, the steel grating on the bascule deck was replaced with fiber-reinforced polymer panels to provide better traction for vehicles. The work was completed in March 2012, but problems with the new deck panels began to be reported in fall 2013. Multnomah County anticipates a major seismic upgrade around 2020. The bridge was added to the National Register of Historic Places in November 2012.

==Description and statistics==

The bridge is the largest mechanical device in Oregon. gears drive 940-ton counterweights located inside each of the piers. The clearance is sufficient for most river traffic, requiring bridge openings only about 30 times a month. The bridge currently carries 50,000 vehicles daily in six lanes. The canted windows of the control tower give the distinctive look of air traffic control towers. The current bridge does not connect to Morrison Street at its west end because the second bridge was left in operation while the latest version was built, necessitating that the replacement bridge be on a different alignment.

In 2005, the bridge opened for river traffic an average of 33 times a month.

<doc id="933434" wikidata="Q2632815" url="?curid=933434" title="Weezing">
<text>Weezing, known in Japan as , is a Pokémon species in Nintendo and Game Freak&#x27;s &quot;Pokémon&quot; franchise. First introduced in the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;, it evolves from the Pokémon Koffing, both having the Poison type. Since Weezing&#x27;s debut, it has appeared in multiple games including &quot;Pokémon Go&quot; and the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;, as well as media related to the franchise, including as a regular character in the TV series. In &quot;Pokémon Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;, a new variant of Weezing are introduced as part of a form called &quot;Galarian,&quot; referring to the region Galar featured in the game. It retains its Poison type while gaining the Fairy type, and features some design differences.

Since its appearance, it has been generally well received, with the Galarian variation being especially popular due to its commentary on the United Kingdom and the environment. It has also been noted for its competitive viability, particularly thanks to the original form&#x27;s Levitate ability and the Galarian form&#x27;s Neutralizing Gas ability.

==Conception and development==
Weezing is a species of fictional creatures called Pokémon created for the &quot;Pokémon&quot; media franchise. Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Japanese franchise began in 1996 with the video games &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Green&quot; for the Game Boy, which were later released in North America as &quot;Pokémon Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in 1998. In these games and their sequels, the player assumes the role of a Trainer whose goal is to capture and use the creatures&#x27; special abilities to combat other Pokémon. Some Pokémon can transform into stronger species through a process called evolution via various means, such as exposure to specific items. Each Pokémon have one or two elemental types, which define its advantages and disadvantages when battling other Pokémon. A major goal in each game is to complete the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading with other Trainers to obtain individuals from all Pokémon species.

When making the games, the design first started as pixel art sprites by the development team, created with a single color identity chosen to work within the Super Game Boy hardware limitations. Once development was complete, Ken Sugimori re-drew the species along with the others in his own artstyle in order to give the game a unified look and finalize any design elements, while also trying to maintain the original artist&#x27;s unique style. In English, Weezing was originally going to be named &quot;La,&quot; referring to Los Angeles, along with Koffing&#x27;s name originally named Ny, referring to New York. These names came from the high levels of air pollution in these areas.

Weezing is a Poison-type Pokémon that evolves from the Pokémon Koffing, also a Poison type, via level up. Like Koffing, it is a hovering purple ball containing poison, featuring a skull and bones pattern on its body. With evolution, it gains a second, smaller head. In &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, it gained the ability Levitate, protecting it from Ground-type attacks. It received a Galarian form in &quot;Pokémon Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;, which retained its Poison type while also gaining a secondary Fairy type. It also gained a new ability called Neutralizing Gas, causing other Pokémon&#x27;s abilities to not work. Galarian Weezing has two heads with protrusions from the top of their heads, resembling both smokestacks and top hats. Its color was changed to grey, while it gained green smog, which also created faux facial hair. It retains the skull and bones sign found on Koffing and the original Weezing design. These elements were designed to make it fit into a United Kingdom-based environment. Video game designer Shigeru Ohmori stated that this design was inspired by seeing a steam engine, and feeling that this reflected the theme of the &quot;strongest Pokémon&quot; featured in &quot;Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;. According to the Pokedex, Galarian Weezing came about in response to air pollution from factories, consuming the contaminants and expelling clean air.

==Appearances==
Weezing appears in both &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; in the wild or through evolution, but can only be obtained in &quot;Pokémon Yellow&quot; via trading. It appears in the sequels &quot;Gold&quot; and &quot;Silver&quot;, as well as &quot;Crystal&quot;, where Weezing can be found in the wild. It later appears in &quot;Pokémon Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;. In &quot;Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;, a new form called Galarian Weezing was introduced, which is able to be obtained by evolving Koffing in the games. Both forms appear in other media for the series, including the mobile game &quot;Pokémon Go,&quot; and the &quot;Pokémon Trading Card Game&quot;.

In the &quot;Pokémon&quot; TV series, Weezing is owned by James, a member of Team Rocket and ally to Jessie. Originally a Koffing, it was James&#x27; only Pokémon, with Ekans being owned by Jessie and its counterpart. Both aided Jessie and James in their plots throughout the series, with Koffing and Ekans eventually evolving to become Weezing and Arbok. Weezing and Arbok are later released by the pair in the episode &quot;A Poached Ego&quot; so that they can protect a group of Koffing and Ekans that are threatened by Pokémon poachers. James and Weezing later appeared in the game &quot;Pokémon Masters EX&quot;, where the pair are playable characters. They are obtainable via a special in-game event.

==Critical reception==

Weezing has received generally positive reception. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; staff discussed Weezing, with writer Alex Olney commenting that he found it a significant improvement over Koffing&#x27;s design, a sentiment shared by writer Zion Grassl. Writer Jon Cartwright felt that Weezing followed a trend of Pokémon designs in the first generation of &quot;Pokémon&quot; games of putting multiple entities of a species on a design to convey evolution, which Olney agreed with while believing that it was a more creative execution on the idea. Olney believed that the second body represented a Koffing growing big enough to split off part of its body into a new body through mitosis. As part of their &quot;Pokémon of the Day&quot; series, &quot;IGN&quot; staff felt that Weezing was an especially popular Pokémon among viewers of the &quot;Pokémon&quot; anime series, noting that it, alongside Arbok, were around in the series for a longer period than any Pokémon protagonist Ash Ketchum owned, with the sole exception of his Pikachu. Despite stating she had a soft spot for Weezing because of this, she felt that its role in the video games was &quot;just another forgettable&quot; Poison-type Pokémon in &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot;. She believed that it saw improvements in &quot;Ruby&quot; and &quot;Sapphire&quot;, thanks to its newfound immunity to the Ground-type attack Earthquake.

Galarian Weezing has been generally well-received, argued by &quot;Fanbyte&quot; writer Imran Khan as being an example of a good regional Pokémon. &quot;Dualshockers&quot; writer Logan Moore was not a fan of regional variants, but made an exception for Weezing, finding Galarian Weezing to be an entertaining design. He praised the depth of the design, particularly in the form of the incorporation of smokestacks. &quot;Anime News Network&quot; writers Lynzee Loveridge and James Beckett regarded Galarian Weezing as one of the best Poison-type Pokémon, praising its design as a particularly good regional variant. They highlighted in particular the &quot;industrial era-London smokestacks&quot; and &quot;oil baron&quot; concepts that were present within its design. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; writer Heather Wald wrote that many fans of the series enjoyed the design, highlighting many interpretations and comparisons being made out of its design for humorous effect by fans. &quot;Nintendo Life&quot; writer Rebecca Stow praised Galarian Weezing&#x27;s design, appreciating its London influences - particularly the resemblance to the &quot;iconic&quot; smokestacks of the Battersea Power Station. She felt it was one of the most hilarious designs she had ever seen from the series, expressing excitement to be able to use it upon &quot;Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot;″s release. &quot;Destructoid&quot; writer CJ Andriessen discussed how Galarian Weezing provided commentary on climate change, particularly via the smokestacks in the United Kingdom during the industrial revolution. Yessenia Funes spoke similarly, believing Galarian Weezing to be associated with climate change, predominantly in the form of long-lasting consequences for past events, which they believed tied into wider theming within &quot;Sword&quot; and &quot;Shield&quot; that had already been established via elements such as Galarian Corsola. 

Galarian Weezing&#x27;s competitive viability has been the subject of commentary. &quot;Dot Esports&quot; writer Cale Michael suggested that Galarian Weezing&#x27;s new ability could help improve the competitive standing of Pokémon such as Archeops, Slaking, and Regigigas in battle, as the latter three had abilities that hindered their combat capabilities. He also felt that its new Fairy type helped it on its own merit as well, thanks in part to its immunity to Dragon-type attacks. &quot;TheGamer&quot; writer Callum Archer felt that, despite believing that Weezing was originally a decent Pokémon, Galarian Weezing represented an improvement in competitive play across the board, finding it greatly improved in its type, moveset, and abilities. He stated he greatly preferred the Galarian design, believing that while the original Weezing is &quot;classic,&quot; it hadn&#x27;t aged as well, finding the Galarian Weezing to be a &quot;fun twist&quot; on the concept.

<text>Cannon Hall is a country house museum located between the villages of Cawthorne and High Hoyland some 5 miles (8 km) west of Barnsley, South Yorkshire, England. Originally the home of the Spencer and later the Spencer-Stanhope family, it now houses collections of fine furniture, paintings, ceramics and glassware. It at one time housed the Regimental Museum of the 13th/18th Royal Hussars (Queen Mary&#x27;s Own) and the Light Dragoons, which has now closed. Now occupying four rooms in the east wing is the &quot;Family of Artists&quot; exhibition on loan from the De Morgan Foundation, which draws on the links between the Spencer Stanhopes and the De Morgans.

The building is constructed of coursed sandstone with ashlar dressings with a symmetrical layout of a central 3-storey block of 5 bays and slightly set back 2-storey side wings of 3 bays.

==History==
Although there was a house on the site when the Domesday Survey of 1086 was conducted, Cannon Hall picked up its current name from the 13th-century inhabitant Gilbert Canun. By the late 14th century Cannon Hall was in the ownership of the Bosville family of Ardsley, now a suburb in south-east of Barnsley. It was during this period that the most violent event in Cannon Hall&#x27;s history took place. The Bosvilles had let the Hall out to a family (whose name has been lost), the daughter of whom was romantically involved with a man named Lockwood. Lockwood had been involved in the murder of Sir John Elland, the High Sheriff of Yorkshire. The tenant, afraid of the position in which he could find himself accommodating a fugitive, sent word to Bosville. Bosville&#x27;s men arrived at Cannon Hall, where the fugitive was slain in a cruel and violent manner.

Cannon Hall&#x27;s history settled down after this notably unpleasant episode. In 1660 the estate was purchased by John Spencer, a Welsh hay-rake maker. The Spencer family had arrived in Yorkshire from Montgomeryshire in the Welsh borders, a safer place than Wales for those with Royalist sympathies such as those of the Spencers (John Spencer even managed to get a pardon from Charles II himself when John was held in York prison on manslaughter charges). The Spencer family became active in the local iron and coal industry - notably under John Spencer (died 1729) who took advantage of the death of his partners to establish control. The family built a huge empire and funded the rebuilding of Cannon Hall.

The core of the present Cannon Hall was built at the opening of the 18th century for John Spencer Stanhope, possibly by John Etty of York, more surely with interior joinery by William Thornton, another well-known local craftsman. It was enlarged with the addition of wings in 1764–67 by the premier mid-Georgian architect working in Yorkshire, John Carr. Subsequently, the wings were heightened, giving the rather high-blocked mass seen today. The last member of the family, Elizabeth, sold the house to Barnsley Council in 1951.

Cannon Hall Museum opened to the public in 1957.

==Current activities==
Cannon Hall Museum, park and gardens is owned and operated by Barnsley Metropolitan Borough Council. The Hall has a programme of events, including the annual Regency Ball, a Christmas Fair each December and guided tours, workshops and children&#x27;s activities throughout the year. A florist, plant and gift shop has also been recently established in the old potting shed outbuilding next to the walled garden.

===Gardens and historic plant collection===

The parkland surrounding the hall was landscaped in the 18th century by Richard Woods of Chertsey, and features acres of parkland, lakes, waterfalls, follies and vistas. The Victorian pleasure grounds are located close to the Georgian walled garden, which houses a collection of over forty varieties of pear trees, among other plants.

The central glasshouses rebuilt in the Victorian era also house the original Cannon Hall Muscat grapevine. Reputedly grown from a seed brought back from Greece by John Spencer Stanhope, the large white table grape has been cultivated extensively in California and Western Australia (local spelling, Canon Hall Muscat) and has acted as rootstock for a number of premium hybrid cultivars including the Japanese Pione grape.

===De Morgan Foundation===
In March 2016, Cannon Hall Museum and the De Morgan Foundation, a registered charity preserving the work of William De Morgan and Evelyn De Morgan, entered into a collaboration which saw the opening of the &quot;Family of Artists&quot; long-term exhibition in the east wing of the Museum.

<doc id="933444" wikidata="Q165846" url="?curid=933444" title="Operation Ivy (band)">
<text>Operation Ivy was an American punk rock band from Berkeley, California, formed in May 1987. They were critical to the emergence of Lookout Records and the so-called &quot;East Bay Sound.&quot;

The band&#x27;s name was derived from the Operation Ivy series of nuclear tests in 1952. Although the band released just one full-length album (&quot;Energy&quot;) before breaking up in May 1989, Operation Ivy is well remembered as the direct antecedent of popular band Rancid and for wielding a lasting stylistic influence over numerous other bands in what became the third wave ska movement.

==History==
===Formation===
Operation Ivy was formed in May 1987 and was named after the code name of a 1952 American nuclear weapons testing program. 

The band consisted of Jesse Michaels (lead vocals), Tim &quot;Lint&quot; Armstrong (guitar, vocals), Matt &quot;McCall&quot; Freeman (bass, vocals), and Dave Mello (drums). Prior to the formation of Operation Ivy, Armstrong and Freeman had played together in the Berkeley ska punk band Basic Radio.

Operation Ivy&#x27;s first live performance was on May 27, 1987, in Dave Mello&#x27;s garage. The next day began a tradition of performances at the Berkeley punk collective center 924 Gilman Street. Operation Ivy began playing a number of performances which led to its almost immediate cult-following.

After witnessing a live show in Southern California, Joy Aoki of &quot;Flipside&quot; Magazine described the energetic new band as a &quot;swell bunch of guys&quot; who &quot;mix hard-edged ska with the intensity of young thrash.&quot;

===Recordings===

In October 1987, the band made its recording debut with a track on the &quot;Maximumrocknroll&quot; compilation album &quot;Turn It Around!&quot;.

In January 1988, the band signed to Lookout Records and released its debut 7-inch record, &quot;Hectic&quot;, which became one of Lookout&#x27;s best-selling records. By this time, Operation Ivy, along with Crimpshrine and The Mr. T Experience, was one of the most successful bands from the punk scene at 924 Gilman Street. The band began playing a number of performances and embarked on a tour across the United States. By mid-1988, the group began selling out larger venues and the pressure to sign to major labels began to rise. With a budding reputation as an excellent live band, EMI offered Operation Ivy a major-label deal. Unsure of how to react to the prospect of success, both because of their independent politics and local-mindedness, the band chose to break up rather than compromise their intentions.

Operation Ivy released its only studio album &quot;Energy&quot; through Lookout in March 1989. The group broke up two months later in May, and its last official live performance was on May 28, 1989. This was also Green Day&#x27;s first performance with the name Green Day at 924 Gilman Street, at what was supposed to have been Operation Ivy&#x27;s record release party. Operation Ivy played one more unofficial performance the following day, mostly for friends and family, in Robert Eggplant&#x27;s backyard in Pinole, California.

In two years, the band performed 185 shows and recorded a total of 32 songs (28 released officially, 4 on the bootlegged EP &quot;Plea for Peace&quot;), as well as songs which were recorded only as demos, such as &quot;Hedgecore&quot; (about a favorite pastime of the band which involved artfully jumping into manicured bushes), &quot;Hangin&#x27; Out&quot;, &quot;Sarcastic&quot; and &quot;Left Behind&quot;. Recordings from their aborted attempt to record &quot;Energy&quot; at 924 Gilman Street also exist, and include early versions of songs which appeared later on the final studio version of &quot;Energy&quot;, such as &quot;6 to 10&quot; which evolved into &quot;Vulnerability&quot;, and an early version of &quot;Unity&quot; with horn accompaniment and a different chorus. All of its known demos and unreleased recordings are available on bootlegs.

===Lyrical themes===

The lyrics and tone of Operation Ivy&#x27;s music portray a vociferous desire for social justice and a strong distrust of mainstream conformist culture.

===Break-up and legacy===

Operation Ivy broke up in May 1989.

In 1991, two years after the group&#x27;s demise, Lookout Records released a compilation album of 27 tracks including &quot;Energy&quot; and &quot;Hectic&quot; in their entirety and the songs &quot;Officer&quot; and &quot;I Got No&quot; all the way to &quot;Turn It Around!&quot;. It was released as a complete discography (sometimes referred to as a re-release of &quot;Energy&quot;).

Although Operation Ivy released only one studio album, &quot;Energy&quot; and had little mainstream success during its career, the band maintained a large underground cult following and influenced numerous bands. The album was certified gold by the RIAA on August 8, 2003.

An array of artists have covered Operation Ivy songs, most of which are featured on a 1997 tribute album, &quot;Take Warning: The Songs of Operation Ivy.&quot; Included are recordings by such bands as Long Beach Dub All Stars covering &quot;Take Warning&quot;, Reel Big Fish covering &quot;Unity&quot;, Blue Meanies covering &quot;Yellin&#x27; in My Ear&quot;, Cherry Poppin&#x27; Daddies covering &quot;Sound System&quot;, The Hippos covering &quot;Freeze Up&quot; and The Aquabats with a &quot;campfire-style&quot; cover of &quot;Knowledge&quot;.

Other bands to cover Operation Ivy songs include a rendition of &quot;Healthy Body&quot; by Area-7, &quot;Smiling&quot; by Goldfinger, &quot;Sound System&quot; by Buck O Nine, &quot;Caution&quot; by No Trigger and more covers of &quot;Knowledge&quot; by both Millencolin and Evergreen Terrace. Link 80 was known to cover &quot;I Got No,&quot; &quot;The Crowd&quot; and &quot;Room Without a Window&quot; (which appeared on their first demo, recorded at Gilman). Hollywood Undead released a cover of the song &quot;Bad Town&quot; in 2010, Green Day recorded a cover of the Operation Ivy song &quot;Knowledge&quot; for its extended play &quot;Slappy&quot; which was later released on the compilation album &quot;1,039/Smoothed Out Slappy Hours&quot;. Green Day have continued to play the song live (where the band picks members out of the audience to play its instruments). Additionally, Rancid have played Operation Ivy songs at its live performances. In October 2015, Leftöver Crack, a band heavily influenced by Operation Ivy, were joined by Jesse Michaels for performances of &quot;Sound System&quot; and &quot;Unity&quot;. Armstrong also joined Boston ska band Big D and the Kids Table for a performance of &quot;Sound System&quot; in Montreal.

===Subsequent careers===
Two of the band&#x27;s members, Armstrong and Freeman, have performed with the bands Rancid, The Ljs, Dance Hall Crashers, Generator, Basic Radio, Downfall, Devil&#x27;s Brigade, Shaken 69 and Transplants. Additionally, Freeman has performed with Auntie Christ, MDC and Social Distortion. Armstrong also has begun releasing music under the moniker Tim Timebomb.

Drummer Dave Mello went on to perform in the punk band Schlong with his brother Pat Mello (bass) and singer Gavin MacArthur (guitar). He is currently drumming in the punk band Kicker from Oakland California, replacing previous drummer Toby Bitter (known best for being in the bands Filth, Impulse Items, and Submachine).

Michaels eventually resurfaced with a project band, Big Rig, which released a four-song EP titled &quot;Expansive Heart&quot;. In 1999 he formed Common Rider, which included bassist Mass Giorgini (producer and bassist for Squirtgun) and drummer Dan Lumley (of Squirtgun and Screeching Weasel, among others). Common Rider released a seven-inch EP and two studio albums and toured nationwide before disbanding in 2003. B-sides from its second album &quot;This Is Unity Music&quot; were used in a split EP with the Florida skacore band Against All Authority.

In 2008, Michaels collaborated with the indie/punk group Hard Girls to form a punk band called Classics of Love (who were named after a Common Rider song). The band plays traditional punk rock with Michaels serving as the band&#x27;s lead vocalist. They released a 6-song EP released on Asian Man Records in 2009, and a full-length record (also with Asian Man Records) in 2012.

===Leaving Lookout===
On May 4, 2006, it was announced that &quot;Energy&quot; had officially been removed from Lookout Records&#x27; catalog. The album had been one of the label&#x27;s best-selling albums, after Green Day&#x27;s first two albums. Operation Ivy followed bands such as Green Day, Screeching Weasel, The Queers, and Ted Leo and the Pharmacists in leaving Lookout and taking back the rights to their back catalog due to unpaid royalties.

The 1991 compilation &quot;Operation Ivy&quot; was later reissued on November 6, 2007, by Epitaph Records subsidiary Hellcat Records as a self-titled compilation album. Hellcat Records is former band member Tim Armstrong&#x27;s label. While the Epitaph reissue&#x27;s track list is identical to the 1991 Lookout release, the 2007 re-release features remastered audio and new Digipak packaging. Hellcat re-issued the original versions of both &quot;Energy&quot; and &quot;Hectic&quot; on red and clear vinyl in April 2012.

Operation Ivy is featured in the 2017 documentary &quot;Turn It Around: The Story of East Bay Punk&quot;.

===Reunions===
The group has stated a number of times that an Operation Ivy reunion is unlikely to happen. Michaels addressed reunion issues in a Myspace blog citing the legal and logistic difficulties in getting the four members together for a reunion, as well as the fact that the band &quot;never belonged in a big rock club in a one to two thousand seat joint.&quot; He concluded the post with the following: &quot;[Will] it happen? The most honest answer is probably not.&quot; Michaels&#x27; sentiment was later echoed by Tim Armstrong:

During Rancid&#x27;s US tour in 2006, Armstrong and Freeman played select tracks from their previous band&#x27;s catalog. At a performance at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco on December 17, 2006, Michaels reunited with Armstrong and Freeman to perform the tracks &quot;Unity&quot; as well as &quot;Sound System&quot;. It was his first time on stage with the two in over 15 years.

In 2013 and for the first time in 24 years, Michaels and Armstrong (under the name Tim Timebomb) recorded a song together when Michaels appeared on &quot;Living in a Dangerous Land&quot;, a song Armstrong released as part of his &quot;Tim Timebomb and Friends&quot; series.

In March 2023, Armstrong and Michaels along with Circle Jerks drummer Joey Castillo formed the band Bad Optix and released their first single &quot;Raid&quot;. Less than a week after announcing the formation of the band, the band changed their name to DOOM Regulator.

<doc id="933450" wikidata="Q626809" url="?curid=933450" title="Mount Arayat">
<text>Mount Arayat is an isolated potentially active stratovolcano in the Central Luzon plains. Located within vast agricultural lands of Pampanga, it rises prominently to a height of above sea level. Its southern half lies within the municipality of Arayat, while its north half and summit lies within Magalang. to the west of Mount Arayat is Angeles City and the former Clark Air Base. The active volcano Mount Pinatubo is located west, while Manila is located to the south. Mount Arayat was officially declared a national park in 1933 and a tourist spot in 1997. The mountain is currently under an immense deforestation threat.

Mount Arayat has a breached crater on its northwest side with a smaller andesitic dome in the collapse amphitheater. There are historical records of eruption in Arayat and the only dated rocks are 530- and 650-thousand-year-old basalts predating the collapse and formation of the lava dome. However, weak steaming is currently present in some of the heavily eroded vents on the North Western side of the summit. Additionally an analysis report indicates that the volcano erupted over the last 2,000 years, but it is believed to refer to the volcanic activity of the volcano.

Mount Arayat is considered mystical in ancient Kapampangan folklore as the legendary home of Aung/Aring Sinukuan/Sinkuan/Suku or the Fairy known as diwata Maria Sinukuan. According to research gathered by Kapampangan students of Henry Otley Beyer, the mountain was the abode of Apung/Aring Sinukuan, rival of Apu Namalyari of Mount Pinatubo.

==Etymology==
The origins of the name &quot;Arayat&quot; are multifaceted and have evolved over time. The earliest mention of the mountain&#x27;s name appears in a 1696 travel diary by Gemelli Careri, where it is noted that the natives referred to the mountain as &quot;&quot;Bondo Kalaya&quot;,&quot; later becoming &quot;Bondoc Alaya&quot; (literally &quot;Mount Alaya&quot;). This eventually transformed into &quot;Arayat.&quot;

Several theories exist regarding the name&#x27;s origin:

# One theory suggests that the name &quot;Arayat&quot; originated from Fernando de Arayat, a Spanish encomiendero, whose birthplace in Spain was called &quot;Arayat.&quot; Over time, locals transformed the word to &quot;Daya.&quot;
# Another theory posits that the original vernacular name &quot;Dayat&quot; is derived from &quot;dayatan,&quot; which literally means dry season rice crop or irrigation of rice lands during the dry season.
# A third theory states that &quot;Arayat&quot; was formerly known as &quot;Alaya,&quot; meaning &quot;east.&quot; Thus, &quot;bunduk alaya&quot; or &quot;eastern mountain&quot; referred to Mt. Arayat. This source also suggests that &quot;Arayat&quot; is of Spanish origin.
# A contemporary researcher believes that Mt. Arayat is the same as the biblical Mt. Ararat, where Noah&#x27;s Ark landed. However, this theory does not account for the etymological background of the present name and does not explain why another Mt. Ararat exists in the Middle East.

Additionally, some sources distinguish between &quot;Aláya&quot; as the name of the mountain and &quot;Aráyat&quot; as the name of the town.

== History ==

=== Philippine Revolution ===
During the Philippine Revolution, the Filipino revolutionaries retreated on Mount Arayat after the failure of the Cry of Nueva Ecija during September 1896 when the Spanish counter-attacked at San Isidro.

In September 1897, Gen. Francisco Macabulos retreated to Mount Arayat along with his men to avoid capture by the Spanish authorities in Tarlac, which used to be under the control of his forces. Several engagements would occur here afterwards until his surrender on January 15, 1898.

=== World War II ===
On Mount Arayat, Colonel Thorpe, an American guerrilla officer, was captured by Japanese forces on December 10, 1942.

Mount Arayat would then be used as a hiding place for communist Filipino guerrillas called the Hukbalahap afterwards. Nicanor Songco &quot;Bapa&quot; developed a plan on how they could spread the information of their escape to Mount Arayat to be safe in the height of the war. This plan would be the reason for the survival of their family from Bulacan, Pampanga and Nueva Ecija who joined them at that time. When they found out that the Japanese soldiers had arrived at their place, they quickly left and went to Mount Arayat but when they were about to go up, the officers of the Japanese soldiers came to arrest him. Nicanor surrendered to ensure everyone&#x27;s safety. He was tortured by having his skin removed from his arm. Following this, he was released by the Japanese soldiers and he was able to return to Mount Arayat and his family.

==Geography==
Mount Arayat stands in the middle of the largely-agricultural AMSL Central Luzon Plain, serving as a distinct landmark in Pampanga province. The mountain is topped by a circular volcanic crater about in diameter, much of which has collapsed on the western and part of the northern rim due to erosion. This has resulted in a breached crater which opens in a west-northwest direction. This area is the apparent source of a major debris-avalanche deposit that forms hummocky terrain beyond the west and northwest sides of the volcano. The summit stands on the northeast side of the breached crater, known as North Peak, while the Pinnacle Peak is located on the southeast crater rim. Post-collapse activity formed an andesitic lava dome known as White Rock in the collapse amphitheater.

==Eruptions==
There are no cultural records of historical eruptions. However, weak steaming is currently present in some of the heavily eroded vents on the North Western side of the summit. The ancient eruptions were said to have caused the formation of a Lava Dome on the Western Slopes of the mountain known as White Rock which makes a nice tourist destination and is usually a field trip destination for students of Pampanga State Agricultural University. The Arayat amphitheatre is said to have been caused by the summit&#x27;s collapse on the western side but a much deeper crater is present on the eastern side, it was said that the mountain was once a volcanic island, until eruptions covered the surrounding area with soil, eruptions were said to be the possible cause of a theorized re-route of Pampanga River which is said to have once passed on the western side rather than eastern side where it currently moves.

==Geology==
Rock types are basalt and andesite. The only rocks reported to have been dated are 0.53 and 0.65 million-year-old basalts. These predate the crater collapse and formation of the lava dome known as White Rock, which could have occurred in the last 2000 years.
The mountain which is believed to be several peaks merged at the top by some local people is actually a Single-Cone Stratovolcano.

==Hiking activity==
Two trails lead to the peaks of Mount Arayat. Mount Arayat National Park Located at San Juan Baño in Arayat, Pampanga has a trail to the southern Peak, taking around 3–4 hours to reach the peak. The Southern Peak offers views of Central Luzon, including a view of Pampanga River. The collapsed western Slope that forms the other half of its caldera-like crater can also be seen. It offers a view of the mountains of Zambales and Bataan (to the west), and the mountains of the Sierra Madre range (to the east). The northern or higher Peak can be accessed on a route from Pampanga State Agricultural University in Magalang, Pampanga, taking a similar time to reach the peak, however, this route takes you through the Arayat Amphitheatre and the so-called White Rock which legend claims to be the Home of Apung/Aring Sinukuan. There are two other trails on Mount Arayat&#x27;s slopes as of 2017: the Pinnacle, which is a knife edge monkey trail, and the TKO, which is the hardest trail. The trails in San Juan Banyo, Arayat Pampanga. However, these two features, the Pinnacle and TKO, cannot be considered peaks because they are not prominent unlike the North and South peak, and thus are only considered as view decks as per International Mountaineering definitions.

===Arayat in folklore===
The Mountain is said to be the home of the god/sorcerer named Sinukuan/Sinukwan or Sucu, which could mean &quot;The end&quot; or &quot;he to whom others have surrendered.&quot; The mountain was said to have been located in the swamp to its south but relocated because of the evil ways of those who lived there, in addition to which, the people of the swamp were made to suffer numerous misfortunes. Sinukuan is believed to be able to transform and do as he pleases at will, his only real rival being Namalyari of Mount Pinatubo. The waterfalls at Ayala in Magalang, Pampanga is said to be his bathing quarters, and it is often visited by tourists and natives alike. Sinukuan is said to live at the White rock, a Lava dome possibly formed by the last eruption, where its glimmering properties were most likely to have inspired the legend. Contrary to reality, the mountain is believed to be several mountains merging at the center including the tallest two peaks. Sinukuan is believed to have daughters who come down only during time of grace and are disguised as humans, Sinukuan himself can be disguised as human. The day he comes back is believed to either be when he responds to the attack of Namalyari on Mount Pinatubo&#x27;s 1991 eruption or when the time to call his servants upon the end of the world has come.

Prior to Spanish colonization, Sinukuan was known as a powerful male Kapampangan god, named Aring Sinukûan, who was in par with the Kapampangan god of Pinatubo, Apûng Malyari. The two were the second most powerful deities in Kapampangan mythology, next only to Mangechay (sometimes called Mangacha), the great elder and creator goddess. Aring Sinukûan was the sun god of war and death, taught the early inhabitants the industry of metallurgy, wood cutting, rice culture and waging war. He had three children, namely, Munag Sumalâ, the golden serpent god who represent dawn, Lakandanup, the god of gluttony who represented the sun at noon time, and Gatpanapun, the noble god who only knew pleasure and represented the afternoon. He also had a winged assistant named Galurâ, a giant eagle deity believed to be the bringer of storms, and a wife named Mingan. However, when the Spanish arrived, they &#x27;rebranded&#x27; Sinukuan as a woman, thinking that the people would not revere the deity if he was a female, not knowing that the great elder deity of the Kapampangan was a woman named Mangechay. Despite this, the natives continued to revere Sinukuan. Furious, the Spanish added &#x27;Maria&#x27; to Sinukuan&#x27;s name to somewhat turn her into Catholic in a bid to further subjugate the natives and convert them into Roman Catholicism. In recent years, locals have cited that there is a man in the mountain, angry due to the deforestation that was happening. Others say that it was Aring Sinukuan.

==Listings==
Fumarole activity is reported on the NW side of the summit.

The Global Volcanism Program lists Mount Arayat as Holocene

<text>L&#x27;isle joyeuse, L. 106 (The Joyful Island) is a piece for solo piano by Claude Debussy composed in 1904. It is assumed that the painting The Embarkation for Cythera by Jean-Antoine Watteau served as inspiration for the piece, with Debussy reimagining a group&#x27;s journey to the island considered Aphrodite&#x27;s birthplace, and their subsequent ecstatic unions of love upon arrival. According to Jim Samson (1977), the &quot;central relationship in the work is that between material based on the whole-tone scale, the lydian mode and the diatonic scale, the lydian mode functioning as an effective mediator between the other two.&quot;

==Structure==
===Exposition, bars 1–98===
The introduction creates a whole tone context. This changes to an A Lydian context which, in bars 15–21, transitions, through the addition of G natural, to the whole tone context of a new motive at bar 21. This A Lydian context serves to transition from the whole tone mode on A to the A major context, inflected by occasional Lydian Ds, of the second theme at bar 67.

===Middle, bars 99–159===
The other transposition of the whole tone scale, avoided in the outer sections, is used and provides further harmonic contrast.

===Recapitulation, bars 160–255===
The second subject appears in pure A major, the &quot;ultimate tonal goal of the piece&quot;. The opening codas &quot;louder and more animatedly until the very end&quot;. It ends with a loud tremolo, a group of grace notes ascending to two octaves of A notes in the highest registers of the piano, and a quick, final arpeggio, the same arpeggio used to accompany the first use of the second subject, played downwards, hitting the lowest note on the keyboard (A0) markedly.

<text>Norwegian Students&#x27; Society () is Norway&#x27;s oldest student society.

The Norwegian Students&#x27; Society was established during 1813 in Oslo, Norway. Two years after the Royal Frederick University (today named the University of Oslo) was founded, 18 of the 19 students formed the Norwegian Students&#x27; Society. It has been the centre of debate, culture and politics for over 200 years.
The idea was to make a social, intellectual and cultural arena for the students in Norway&#x27;s capital. Originally a closed literary club, in 1820 it was opened for all students. In future years, the Society played a role in national debate, including contributing substantially to the establishment of May 17 as Norwegian Constitution Day.


Today the Society is located at Chateau Neuf, a large concrete block building to the south of the Blindern Campus. Opened in 1971, the building also contains several cafes and a cinema. Most of the activity at Chateau Neuf is generated by volunteers with people signing up for the many different jobs at hand. 
The Society frequently arrange debates, lectures and concerts. The Society also hosts its own theater and music groups.

<text>McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents, 339 U.S. 637 (1950), was a United States Supreme Court case that prohibited racial segregation in state supported graduate or professional education. The unanimous decision was delivered on the same day as another case involving similar issues, &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot;.

==Facts==
The plaintiff, George W. McLaurin, who already had a master&#x27;s degree in education, was first denied admission to the University of Oklahoma to pursue a Doctorate in Education degree. McLaurin successfully sued in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma to gain admission to the institution (87 F. Supp. 526; 1948 U.S. Dist.) basing his argument on the Fourteenth Amendment. At the time, Oklahoma law prohibited schools from instructing blacks and whites together. The court found that the university&#x27;s inaction in providing separate facilities, in order to meet Oklahoma state law, allowing McLaurin to attend the institution was a violation of his Constitutional rights. However, the court did not issue any injunctive relief as requested by the plaintiff but rather relied &quot;on the assumption that the law having been declared, the State will comply.&quot;

The University admitted McLaurin but provided him separate facilities, including a special table in the cafeteria, a designated desk in the library, a desk just outside the classroom doorway or in the classroom closet, and sometimes even made him eat at different times than the other students.

McLaurin returned to the U.S. District court and petitioned to require the University of Oklahoma to remove the separate facilities allowing him to interact with the other students fully (87 F. Supp. 528; 1949 U.S. Dist.) The court denied McLaurin&#x27;s petition.

==Finding of the court==
McLaurin then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. On June 5, 1950, the United States Supreme Court ruled that a public institution of higher learning could not provide different treatment to a student solely because of his/her race as doing so deprived the student of his/her Fourteenth Amendment rights of Equal Protection.

Accordingly, the high court reversed the decision of the U.S. District Court, requiring the University of Oklahoma to remove the restrictions under which McLaurin was attending the institution. This case together with &quot;Sweatt v. Painter&quot;, which was decided the same day, marked the end of the separate but equal doctrine of &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; in graduate and professional education.

==Commemoration==
In 2001, the Bizzell Memorial Library, the main library at the University of Oklahoma, was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in commemoration of this case. The case was heard in Oklahoma City at the Post Office, Courthouse, and Federal Office Building.

<doc id="933465" wikidata="Q6772478" url="?curid=933465" title="Marquam Bridge">
<text>The Marquam Bridge is a double-deck, steel-truss cantilever bridge that carries Interstate 5 traffic across the Willamette River from south of downtown Portland, Oregon, on the west side to the industrial area of inner Southeast on the east. It is the busiest bridge in Oregon, carrying 140,500 vehicles a day as of 2016. The upper deck carries northbound traffic; the lower deck carries southbound traffic. The Marquam also has on and off ramps for Interstate 405 on the south end of the bridge, while the terminus on the east bank of the river is near the interchange with Interstate 84.

==History==
Planning for the span started in 1956 as the last link in Oregon for the new Interstate Highway System for the main north-south route through the state. Even prior to construction, it was decided to name the span after Philip Marquam. Marquam was a state legislator and Multnomah County judge, who owned much of Marquam Hill where Oregon Health &amp; Science University and the Veterans Affairs Medical Center now stand. Construction on the bridge&#x27;s support piers began in January 1962. Construction on the bridge finished on February 28, 1966. The lower southbound deck was opened on October 4, 1966, and the upper northbound deck on October 18, 1966.
The bridge was designed and built by the Oregon Department of Transportation at a cost of $14 million, equivalent to $ today. Funds for the project came from the Federal Highway Transportation Act. The bridge was redecked in 1983. In 1990, the approach lanes from both the east and west were widened to allow four lanes of traffic and an off-ramp to Water Avenue was built. Due to its importance, the Marquam was the first Portland bridge to undergo a seismic retrofit in 1995, which included installation of Italian made bearings add to the piers.

==Design==
The main span of the bridge is long and the two side spans are each for a total length of . Vertical clearance of the lower deck is and the upper deck is above the lower. The Marquam was designed by Ivan D. Merchant and Pieter Kiewit Sons Company served as the general contractor. At the eastern end of the bridge, on the lower deck, is a ramp stub which was intended to connect to the later abandoned Mount Hood Freeway project. The bridge was designed with four lanes in each direction. It was the first double-deck freeway bridge in the state. Part of the design process also utilized computers for various calculations.

The Marquam Bridge was built with economy in mind and the public at large reacted unfavorably to the structure&#x27;s bland aesthetics, which included a formal protest from the Portland Arts Commission. (In particular, it blocked the view of downtown from the Union Avenue Viaduct.) This led to public input in the design of the Fremont Bridge. During Mayor Vera Katz&#x27;s State of the City address in 2001, she said, &quot;It’s like having the Berlin Wall dividing east and west, with all the subtle charm of the Daytona 500 smack dab in the middle of our city.&quot; The bridge crosses over and runs parallel to parts of the now named Vera Katz Eastbank Esplanade.

==Future==

Options to replace the bridge historically considered have been to reroute I-5 over the existing I-405 alignment, connecting I-84 to I-5 at the Fremont Bridge interchange, following the US 30 alignment, and removing the Marquam permanently. Another option would build a tunnel under the Willamette River approximately following the existing I-5 alignment, and remove the Marquam Bridge permanently.

Proposals have been made to replace the Eastbank Freeway portion of I-5 with a tunnel, connecting with the existing alignment at the Marquam Bridge and the Rose Quarter. This would free up space along the Willamette River for development.

<doc id="933467" wikidata="Q7692365" url="?curid=933467" title="Technicare">
<text>Technicare, formerly known as Ohio Nuclear, made CT, DR and MRI scanners and other medical imaging equipment. Its headquarters was in Solon, Ohio. Originally an independent company which became publicly traded, it was later purchased by Johnson &amp; Johnson. At the time, Invacare was also owned by Technicare. A Harvard Business Case was written about the challenges that precipitated the transition. The company did not do well under Johnson &amp; Johnson and in 1986, under economic pressure following unrelated losses from two Tylenol product tampering cases, J&amp;J folded the company, selling the intellectual property and profitable service business to General Electric, a competitor.

Ohio Nuclear&#x27;s (ON) first products were nuclear medicine (NM) scanners. They made a rectilinear gamma scanner and a gamma camera in the 70s. This was followed by a variety of NM products. The company had bought also an ultrasound product line (formerly UNIRAD).

The following information is copied from a Technicare advertising brochure, which primarily focuses on Nuclear Medicine products. This is a personal possession and it is not known if any more of these documents survive.

1963 - Developed first whole body rectilinear scanner.
1964 - Introduced first dual head rectilinear scanner
1967 - developed scan minification principle
1968 - first to offer 750 cm/min scanning speed.
1972 - Introduced 37 tube scintillation camera
1974 - introduced large field scintillation camera to US market.
1975 - Introduced 37 tube large field mobile camera. Introduced DeltaScan, a high resolution (256 x 256) matrix whole body computed tomography scanner.

Of some additional interest is the &lt;October, 1975, Scientific American&gt;&lt;/October, 1975, Scientific American&gt;. On page 4 of this issue, the following statement is made (quoted verbatim from the issue).

&quot;The Cover. The picture on the cover is a section through the chest of a living human subject made by the technique of reconstruction from projections (see &quot;Image Reconstruction from Projections,&quot; page 56). In that technique a series of X-ray exposures made from different angles around the body are combined by computer to present a cross-sectional picture on the screen of a cathode-ray tube. In the picture on the cover the chest is seen as though it were viewed from above the patient&#x27;s head. The dark spaces to the left and right are the lungs. The large red area in the middle is the heart. The white areas are bone; below the center is the spinal column, and around the lungs are sections through the ribs. In general the tomato red areas are muscular tissue and the lavender areas are fatty tissue. The branched areas in the lungs are blood vessels and bronchi. The picture was made (by the Delta Scanner built by Ohio-Nuclear, Inc.) in the course of a study that was conducted by Ralph J. Alfidi, M.D. of the Cleveland Clinic Foundation.&quot;

In CT, Technicare developed and sold the DeltaScan line of products. A prototype whole body scanner was installed at the Cleveland Clinic. The body scanner was installed there and was introduced first. This was followed with the head only dual slice Delta 25 which competed with the EMI Mark-I, the world&#x27;s first CT scanner. This followed the body scanner, Delta 50 one of the first devices to scan the whole body. Both the Delta 25 and 50 scanned the patient in 1–2 minutes which was about twice as fast as EMI products. These first units were of the first (single detector) and second (multiple detector) generation translate and rotate systems.

One of the features of this family of scanners was the elimination of the &quot;water bag&quot; that EMI used through the use of a beam hardening correction to produce a uniform field. Later on this led to the creation of the so-called &quot;shaped filters&quot; which helped to reduce dose and reduce the dynamic range of the radiation on the detectors.

One of the units at the Cleveland Clinic was used to construct an image of the body that today would be called a &quot;Scout View&quot;, essentially a digital x-ray that was produced by moving the body through the gantry with the x-ray tube stationary. This feature was introduced by Philips in 1977 under the name &quot;Scanogram&quot;. At the Cleveland Clinic, Dr. John Haaga, who was at the Clinic at that time, contributed to this concept.

This was followed by the DeltaScan 50FS, the Delta 100, the Delta 2000 series of products and the HPS 1440. The DeltaScan FS reduced scan time to 18 seconds. A later modification to both units allowed the speed of the units to be reduced to 1/4 of normal speed which was used for detailed head scanning. This also increased the scan time but gave the added benefit of increased resolution for cases that warranted it. The Delta 100 scanner, introduced in 1978, was an inexpensive dedicated head scanner priced to get around the certificate of need restrictions in place at the time. The Delta 2000 series, introduced in 1977, included Delta 2005, Delta 2010, Delta 2020, Delta 2060 and Delta 2060 Quantum. These scanners could scan the body in 2–5 seconds, thereby eliminating motion artifacts due to breathing. The HPS 1440 scanner was introduced in 1985 as an ultra high resolution CT scanner. These scanners were of the fourth generation design, in which there was a stationary ring of detectors and the x-ray tube rotating inside the detector ring. One of the 2020 systems was operate at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital attempting cardiac gated imaging.

Also in the product line were DeltaMat, a multiformat camera and DeltaPlan, a radiation therapy planning system using CT cross sectional images to plan radiation therapy treatments. These products were marketed in the 1977 to 1985 timeframe.

The DR 960 was introduced in 1982 as a digital subtraction angiography device. Rather than injecting contrast material into an artery, contrast was injected into the corresponding vein. A digital image was acquired without contrast and one with, and the images subtracted from each other leaving the arterial branch highlighted with contrast.

The company also marketed an MRI (called Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, or NMR at the time) unit, the Teslacon, beginning in 1984. Teslacon products ranged in magnetic field strength from 0.15 to 1.5 tesla. David Flugan and Robert Gauss were the chief thinkers and the &#x27;brain trust&#x27; behind the implementation of Technicare&#x27;s MRI product line. Their names ring prominent among the inventors of early MRI sub parts.

J&amp;J continued supporting the continued development of the HPS 1440 and Teslacon II MRI systems until the end of 1987.

<doc id="933469" wikidata="Q2268000" url="?curid=933469" title="The Colonel's Bequest">
<text>The Colonel&#x27;s Bequest is a character-driven graphic adventure game by Sierra On-Line featuring the character of Laura Bow. It was released for MS-DOS in 1989. Ports for Amiga and Atari ST were released in 1990. It was the first of the short-lived &quot;Laura Bow Mysteries&quot; series created by Roberta Williams, which used many elements from the game &quot;Mystery House&quot;. &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Bequest&quot; was created with SCI0, and employed 4-bit color (16 colors) and a typing interface. Its sequel &quot;The Dagger of Amon Ra&quot; was released in 1992.

== Gameplay ==
&quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Bequest&quot; is one of the few Sierra On-Line adventure games to focus more on the characters than puzzles. Although solving puzzles is required to obtain a high score, it is more important to discover information about the characters&#x27; backgrounds and relationships with each other. Regardless of the importance of these elements, it is possible to finish the game without solving any puzzles, discovering many important details about the characters, or even identifying the murderer.

Although some actions are recorded and scored at the end of the game, there is no discernible point system. In order to aid the player in achieving a higher score during their next attempt, upon completion of the game, it reveals hints and information about things that were missed. This implies that the game is intended to be replayed.

The game&#x27;s characters make plans to be in certain places at certain times, which allows the player to follow them. Characters may get annoyed with the protagonist Laura Bow if they catch her snooping on them or asking too many questions, although this is obvious only in dialogue and the plot is not affected.

Death lurks around every corner, but Laura is almost never threatened by the mysterious villain because she is not related to the Dijon family. Staying consistent with other Sierra adventure games, most deaths experienced by the player occur by accident or misadventures such as falling off a balcony, or being crushed by a falling chandelier. However, the player may be killed by the murderer in the later phases of the game. For example, the murderer&#x27;s arm reaches out at specific locations and snatches Laura away. In another case, the murderer appears in the darkness and strangles Laura to death. One of the more notable non-accidental deaths occurs when the player simply attempts to shower: the murderer stabs Laura in a reference to the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot;Psycho&quot;.

The game&#x27;s unusual title can be attributed to Sierra&#x27;s long-standing tradition of including &quot;Quest&quot; in the title of nearly every graphical adventure they published. A bequest is a legacy or gift handed down to someone in a will.

== Plot ==
&quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Bequest&quot; is set in 1925. The game&#x27;s main character is Laura Bow, a Tulane University student, daughter of a detective, and an aspiring journalist. Laura is invited by her flapper friend, Lillian, to spend a weekend at the decaying sugar plantation of Colonel Dijon. When the reclusive and childless Colonel gathers his quarrelsome relatives for a reading of his will, tensions explode and the bickering leads to murder.

Throughout the game, Laura remains stranded on the island, surrounded by suspects and potential victims in a classical Agatha Christie manner. Laura&#x27;s task is to learn the family secrets and ultimately, the identity of the murderer. There is also an optional subplot concerning a hidden treasure. The storyline advances by a quarter-hour when new plot elements are witnessed, with a new act beginning every hour. Sometimes a quarter-hour can advance in a few real-time seconds, if Laura happens to be at the proper place.

In the final act, Laura finds a skeleton key on Lillian&#x27;s body. She can use this to open the attic door and discover Colonel Dijon and Rudy struggling over a hypodermic syringe. The ending depends on Laura&#x27;s final actions. If she shoots the Colonel or lets Rudy win the fight, the Colonel will die and Rudy will claim that his uncle was the sole murderer. Laura returns home but questions whether that was the full story. If Laura instead shoots and wounds Rudy, the Colonel will reveal that Lillian was the primary murderer, but was killed by Rudy. Colonel Dijon then changes his will to leave everything to Celie, and will let Laura keep the hidden treasure if it was discovered.

== Characters ==
As with classic murder stories, the plot revolves around the characters, most of whom are either potential victims, or potential murderers. Most of the game characters are named after prominent figures of the time, such as Rudolph Valentino, W. C. Fields, Gloria Swanson, Clara Bow, Lillian Gish, and Clarence Darrow. Most are heavily based on well-used archetypes.
* Laura Bow – Player character, Tulane University journalism student, and daughter of detective John Bow.
* Lillian Prune – Laura&#x27;s friend from Tulane. Her father committed suicide when she was young. She is also Ethel&#x27;s daughter.
* Colonel Henri Dijon – A reclusive, rich, eccentric old man, who fought in the Spanish–American War and lives alone on an Antebellum sugar plantation island (as Dijon is a type of mustard, his name is a reference to the character of Colonel Mustard in the game Cluedo).
* Ethel Prune – The Colonel&#x27;s younger sister and Lillian&#x27;s alcoholic mother.
* Gertrude &quot;Gertie&quot; Dijon – The snobbish widow of the Colonel&#x27;s brother, and the mother of Gloria and Rudy.
* Gloria Swansong – Gertie&#x27;s daughter and Rudy&#x27;s sister. She was a Hollywood actress who had gotten into some trouble and was suffering from some sort of disease.
* Rudolph &quot;Rudy&quot; Dijon – Gertie&#x27;s son and Gloria&#x27;s brother. He&#x27;s a slick womanizer and gambler.
* Clarence Sparrow – Henri&#x27;s sneaky lawyer and one of Gloria&#x27;s previous lovers.
* Dr. Wilbur C. Feels – The Colonel&#x27;s long-time and questionable personal physician.
* Fifi – The sexy French maid who lives with him and &quot;serves&quot; the Colonel (and secretly, also Jeeves).
* Jeeves – Butler in the Colonel&#x27;s house, who usually remains silent.
* Celie – Henri&#x27;s cook from New Orleans, whose parents were slaves on the plantation. She is the only character who will befriend Laura.

== Release ==

Originally released in 1989, the game was reissued in 1993 to supplement the release of the sequel, &quot;The Dagger of Amon Ra&quot;. This version corrects some errors with special effects (for example, the fireflies in the opening boat ride and around the dock are more visible and move less erratically). GOG.com released an emulated version for Microsoft Windows in 2017.

== Reception ==
Upon release, &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Bequest&quot; received positive reviews. Johnny L. Wilson from &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; opined the game&#x27;s lack of difficulty would likely disappoint &quot;hard-core adventure gamers (i.e. inveterate puzzle-solvers)&quot; but it succeeded as an &quot;interactive play&quot; that was much more story- than puzzle-driven compared to previous Sierra adventures. He praised the game&#x27;s use of humor and audio, and called it a &quot;forerunner of one style of future entertainment software&quot;.

In the May 1990 edition of &quot;Games International&quot;, Theo Clarke called the game &quot;solid genre stuff&quot;, noting that &quot;the theme reverts to the &#x27;mansion murder&#x27; concept of [Roberta Williams&#x27; first program] &quot;Mystery House&quot;&quot;. He commented on the radical new approach this game takes wherein the player has the option of not taking any action except to observe, saying: &quot;Such an approach is not very rewarding but it serves to demonstrate the essential difference between this and other games&quot;. Clarke concluded by giving the game an above-average rating of 8 out of 10 for both gameplay and graphics: &quot;I have found all of the Sierra games quite obsessive but &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Bequest&quot; has a charm all of its own&quot;.

Retrospectively, Adventure Gamers&#x27; Johann Walter gave it four stars out of five and called it a &quot;rather unique game [and] excellent game&quot; wherein &quot;[the game&#x27;s director and writer] Roberta Williams showed (again) that she was a master game designer, writing one of the very few good detective games in this mold&quot;. Adventure Classic Gaming&#x27;s Michelle Destefano wrote: &quot;In the end, the &quot;Laura Bow Mystery&quot; series is among Roberta&#x27;s best works, and &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Bequest&quot; is among the best murder mystery adventure games to date&quot;.

In 2011, Adventure Gamers named &quot;The Colonel&#x27;s Bequest&quot; the 84th-best adventure game ever released.

== Sequel ==
A sequel called &quot;The Dagger of Amon Ra&quot; followed in 1992, featuring the same character Laura Bow, now a reporter in New York City investigating a series of murders one night in an Egyptian-themed museum.

<text>Agora is a reflective, prototype-based, object-oriented programming language that is based exclusively on message passing and not delegation. Agora was intended to show that even subject to that limit, it is possible to build a full object-oriented language that features inheritance, cloning, and reflective operators.

==Overview==
The idea is that an object is fully encapsulated and can only be subject to message passing. But seen from the inside of the object, the object knows all about its own structures. It is therefore fully able to clone and extend itself. This is accomplished by special methods named &quot;cloning&quot; methods and &quot;mixin&quot; methods.

Agora has been implemented in C++, Java, Scheme, and Smalltalk. Agora98, the latest implementation of Agora, done in Java, allows full access to all Java application programming interfaces (APIs), including the ability to create Java applets from within Agora98. From the language viewpoint, Agora98 is a considerable simplification of prior Agora versions.

<doc id="933481" wikidata="Q923550" url="?curid=933481" title="Songs of Leonard Cohen">
<text>Songs of Leonard Cohen is the debut studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, released on December 27, 1967, on Columbia Records. More successful in Europe than in North America, &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; foreshadowed the kind of chart success Cohen would go on to achieve. It peaked at number 13 on the UK Albums Chart, spending nearly a year and a half on it. In the US, it reached number 83 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Background==
Cohen had received positive attention from critics as a poet and novelist but had maintained a keen interest in music, having played guitar in a country and western band called the Buckskin Boys as a teenager. In 1966, Cohen set out for Nashville, where he hoped to become a country songwriter, but instead got caught up in New York City&#x27;s folk scene. In November 1966, Judy Collins recorded and included Cohen&#x27;s song &quot;Suzanne&quot; for her album &quot;In My Life&quot; and Cohen soon came to the attention of record producer John Hammond. Although Hammond (who initially signed Cohen to his contract with Columbia Records) was supposed to produce the record, he became sick and was replaced by the producer John Simon.

==Recording==
Initially, Hammond had Cohen work up guitar parts for &quot;Master Song&quot; and &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot; with jazz bassist Willie Ruff, and then brought in some of New York&#x27;s top session musicians to join them, a move that made Cohen nervous; as biographer Anthony Reynolds observes in his book &quot;Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life&quot;, the dynamic between Cohen and Ruff had been intimate and natural but &quot;the arrival of more anonymous personnel unnerved Cohen, the studio novice put off by their proficiency.&quot; Cohen did ask that a full-length mirror be brought into the studio because, as he explained to &quot;Mojo&quot; in November 2001, &quot;through some version of narcissism, I always used to play in front of a mirror. I guess it was the best way to look while playing the guitar, or maybe it was just where the chair was. But I was very comfortable looking at myself playing.&quot; After Hammond dropped out of the sessions, John Simon took over as producer and, by all accounts, Simon and Cohen clashed over instrumentation and mixing; Cohen wanted the album to have a sparse sound, while Simon felt the songs could benefit from arrangements that included strings and horns. Writing for &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2012, Sylvie Simmons recalls, &quot;When Leonard heard the result, he was not happy; the orchestration on &#x27;Suzanne&#x27; was overblown, while everything about &#x27;Hey, That&#x27;s No Way to Say Goodbye&#x27; felt too soft. Several tracks had too much bottom, and there were even drums; Leonard had clearly stipulated no drums.&quot; The singer and producer also quarreled over a slight stop in the middle of &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot; – a device Cohen felt interrupted the song. According to biographer Ira Nadel, although Cohen was able to make changes to the mix, some of Simon&#x27;s additions &quot;couldn&#x27;t be removed from the four-track master tape&quot;.

The instrumentalists – not credited on the album sleeve – included Chester Crill, Chris Darrow, Solomon Feldthouse and David Lindley of Kaleidoscope, who had been recruited personally by Cohen after he saw the band play at a New York club.

==Composition==

The album features some of Cohen&#x27;s most celebrated songs. &quot;Mojo&quot; has described the album as &quot;not only the cornerstone of Cohen&#x27;s remarkable career, but also a genuine songwriting landmark in terms of language, thematic developments and even arrangements.&quot; &quot;Suzanne&quot; was ranked 41st on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s &#x27;Top 200 Songs of the 1960s&#x27;, while &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot; was also featured on the list at 190th. In a 1986 interview with the BBC Cohen explained, &quot;The writing of &#x27;Suzanne,&#x27; like all my songs, took a long time. I wrote most of it in Montreal - all of it in Montreal - over the space of, perhaps, four or five months. I had many, many verses to it. Sometimes the song would go off on a tangent, and you&#x27;ll have perfectly respectable verses, but that have led you away from the original feel of the song. So, it&#x27;s a matter of coming back. It&#x27;s a very painful process because you have to throw away a lot of good stuff.&quot; In the same interview, Cohen also revealed that &quot;Master Song&quot; was written &quot;on a stone bench at what was the corner of Burnside and Guy Street...I remember sitting on that bench, working out the lyric to that song.&quot;

As recounted to &quot;Uncut&quot;&#x27;s Nigel Williamson in 1997, &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot; had been written &quot;in Edmonton during a snow storm, and I took refuge in an office lobby. There were two young back-packers there, Barbara and Lorraine, and they had nowhere to go. I asked them back to my hotel room – they immediately got into the bed and crashed while I sat in the armchair watching them sleep. I knew they had given me something, and, by the time they woke up, I had finished the song and I played it to them.” In the 1996 memoir &quot;Various Positions&quot;, biographer Ira Nadel contends &quot;Stranger Song&quot; addresses loss, departure, and essential yet destructive nature of love. In the book &quot;Songwriters on Songwriting&quot;, Cohen told author Paul Zollo that he wrote &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot; &quot;in two hotels. One was the Chelsea and the other was the Penn Terminal Hotel. I remember Marianne (Ihlen, Cohen&#x27;s girlfriend at the time) looking at my notebook, seeing this song and asking, &#x27;Who’d you write this for?&#x27;&quot; When Cohen played in the Isle of Wight in 1970, he told the crowd that he&#x27;d written &quot;One of Us Cannot Be Wrong&quot; in a peeling room in the Chelsea Hotel when he was &quot;coming off amphetamine and pursuing a blond lady that I met in a Nazi poster.&quot;

By the time the album was released in December 1967, Cohen had already signed away the rights to &quot;Suzanne&quot; and &quot;Stranger Song&quot; (along with &quot;Dress Rehearsal Rag&quot;, which would later surface on his 1971 album &quot;Songs of Love and Hate&quot;), to arranger Jeff Chase, with the singer lamenting to Adrian Deevoy of &quot;The Q Magazine&quot; in 1991, &quot;Someone smarter than me got me to sign the publishing over to them. I lost &#x27;Suzanne,&#x27; &#x27;Stranger Song&#x27; and &#x27;Dress Rehearsal Rag.&#x27; I finally got them back three years ago, but I lost a lot of money.&quot;

==Artwork==
On the back cover of the album is a Mexican religious picture of the Anima Sola depicted as a woman breaking free of her chains surrounded by flames and gazing towards heaven. In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, Cohen described the image as &quot;the triumph of the spirit over matter. The spirit being that beautiful woman breaking out of the chains and the fire and prison.&quot; Cohen found the picture in a botánica near the Hotel Chelsea in 1965. The album&#x27;s front cover depicts a sepia tint photo of Cohen credited to Machine.

==Reception and legacy==
The album spent over a year on the UK album charts. The album received mixed reviews at the time of its release, with Arthur Schmidt of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writing, &quot;There are three brilliant songs, one good one, three qualified bummers, and three flaming shits.&quot; While praising &quot;Suzanne&quot; for its &quot;moments of fairly digestible surrealism&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot; opined in a January 1968 review that on the alienation scale, Cohen rated &quot;somewhere between Schopenhauer and Bob Dylan, two other prominent poets of pessimism&quot;.

Critics have been far kinder to the album since its release, with many considering it a highlight in the Cohen canon. Mark Deming of AllMusic states, &quot;The ten songs on &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; were certainly beautifully constructed, artful in a way few (if any) other lyricists would approach for some time, but what&#x27;s most striking about these songs isn&#x27;t Cohen&#x27;s technique, superb as it is, so much as his portraits of a world dominated by love and lust, rage and need, compassion and betrayal...few musicians have ever created a more remarkable or enduring debut.&quot; Writing in &quot;Mojo&quot; in 2012, Sylvie Simmons called the LP &quot;brilliant&quot;, adding that it &quot;sounded like nothing of its time—of any time really—fresh and ancient, cryptic and intimate&quot;. Brian Howe of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; declares, &quot;1968&#x27;s &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; contains many of his most essential songs—&#x27;Suzanne,&#x27; &#x27;Master Song,&#x27; &quot;Stranger Song,&#x27; &#x27;Sisters of Mercy,&#x27; &#x27;So Long, Marianne&#x27;—and establishes the themes and stylistic tics he would pursue relentlessly over the ensuing decades.&quot; In 2007, Tim Nelson of BBC Music called the collection &quot;the absolute must-have classic&quot;.

It was voted number 149 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000). Though not included in the 2003 original nor the 2012 revision, it was ranked number 195 in the 2020 revision of Rolling Stone&#x27;s 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list. In a 2014 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers poll ranking the top ten Leonard Cohen songs, &quot;Suzanne&quot; came in at #2 while &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot; came in at #6.

&quot;Stranger Song&quot;, &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot;, and &quot;Winter Lady&quot; were included on the soundtrack of Robert Altman&#x27;s 1971 film &quot;McCabe &amp; Mrs. Miller&quot;. &quot;Suzanne&quot;, &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot;, &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot;, &quot;Winter Lady&quot;, and &quot;Teachers&quot; were included on the soundtrack of the 1971 film &quot;Beware of a Holy Whore&quot; by Rainer Werner Fassbinder.

==Releases==
&quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; was released on CD in 1989, while a digipak edition was released in some European countries in 2003. A remastered version, with the bonus tracks &quot;Store Room&quot; and &quot;Blessed is the Memory,&quot; was released in the United States on April 24, 2007, and in Japan on June 20, 2007. The Japanese version was a limited edition replica of the original record album cover with lyric card insert. In 2009, the album (including the 2007 bonus tracks) was included in &quot;Hallelujah - The Essential Leonard Cohen Album Collection&quot;, an 8-CD box set issued by Sony Music in the Netherlands.

<doc id="933485" wikidata="Q1113428" url="?curid=933485" title="Filmfare Award for Best Director">
<text>The Filmfare Best Director Award is one of the main awards presented given by the annual Filmfare Awards to recognise directors working in Hindi cinema. It was first presented in 1954 in the inaugural year.

==Superlatives==

Bimal Roy has the record of winning most awards (7) and the distinction of winning the award thrice in a row, on 2 separate occasions (1954–1956 and 1959–1961). He also won the award whenever he was nominated (7/7). Sanjay Leela Bhansali has received the award 5 times, Yash Chopra and Raj Kapoor has received the award 4 times each. 

Yash Chopra received 12 nominations, Sanjay Leela Bhansali has received 8 nominations, while Raj Kapoor has received 6 nominations. Mahesh Bhatt was nominated thrice in a row (1984–1986). However, he hasn&#x27;t received any award even after having been nominated 6 times. Also, no director has ever won if one has been nominated twice in the same year – Gulzar in 1974 (for &quot;Achanak&quot; and &quot;Koshish&quot;), Basu Chatterjee in 1977 (for &quot;Chhoti Si Baat&quot; and &quot;Chitchor&quot;) and Hrishikesh Mukherjee in 1980 (for &quot;Gol Maal&quot; and &quot;Jurmana&quot;).

Sai Paranjpye was the first of 4 women to have won this award, the second being Zoya Akhtar, the third being Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari, and the fourth being Meghna Gulzar. Sai Paranjpye won it for &quot;Sparsh&quot; in 1985. Paranjpye had earlier been nominated for &quot;Chashme Buddoor&quot; in 1982. Zoya Akhtar won it for &quot;Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara&quot; in 2012. Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari won it for &quot;Bareilly Ki Barfi&quot; in 2018 and Meghna Gulzar won it in for &quot;Raazi&quot; in 2019, after previously being nominated in 2016 for &quot;Talvar&quot;. Akhtar won the award again for &quot;Gully Boy&quot; in 2020, thus becoming the only woman to win the award twice. Other women directors to have been nominated are Mira Nair for &quot;Salaam Bombay!&quot; in 1990, Farah Khan for &quot;Main Hoon Na&quot; in 2005 and for &quot;Om Shanti Om&quot; in 2008, Gauri Shinde for &quot;English Vinglish&quot; in 2013 and Seema Pahwa for &quot;Ramprasad Ki Tehrvi&quot; in 2022.

Rajkumar Santoshi remains the only director to have won the award for his first two films – for &quot;Ghayal&quot; in 1991 and for &quot;Damini&quot; in 1994.

Nitesh Tiwari and Ashwiny Iyer Tiwari are the only married couple to win the award. Additionally, they won the award in consecutive years – the former won the award for &quot;Dangal&quot; in 2017 and the latter won the award for &quot;Bareilly Ki Barfi&quot; in 2018.

Only once have two siblings been nominated in the same year; Zoya Akhtar for &quot;Zindagi Na Milegi Dobara&quot; and Farhan Akhtar for &quot;Don 2&quot; in 2012, with Zoya winning the category.

<text>Devendra Obi Banhart (born May 30, 1981) is a Venezuelan singer-songwriter and visual artist. Banhart was born in Texas and raised in Venezuela and California. In 2000, he dropped out of the San Francisco Art Institute to pursue a musical career. In 2002, Banhart released his debut album and is best known for his albums in the late 2000s such as &quot;Cripple Crow&quot; and &quot;Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon&quot;. He has since expanded his career to incorporate his interest and training in the visual arts.

==Early life==
Banhart was born in Houston, Texas, to a Venezuelan mother, María Eugenia Rísquez, and an American father, Robert Gary Banhart. His given name is a synonym for Indra, suggested by Indian religious leader Prem Rawat (whom Banhart&#x27;s parents followed), and his middle name Obi takes after Obi-Wan Kenobi, a &quot;Star Wars&quot; character.

His parents divorced in 1983, after which Rísquez and he moved to Caracas, Venezuela. Rísquez later remarried and when Banhart was age 14, his stepfather moved the family to Los Angeles, California.

In 1998, Banhart began studying at the San Francisco Art Institute on a scholarship while living in The Castro, San Francisco&#x27;s &quot;gay&quot; district, though he would often busk instead of attending class. He played his first musical show in a church at a gay wedding, performing Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Love Me Tender&quot; and the hymn &quot;How Great Thou Art&quot;.

== Musical career ==

Banhart dropped out of college in 2000 and left San Francisco after the dot-com bubble bust worsened the city&#x27;s economy. That summer, he moved to Paris and began opening shows for indie rock bands such as Sonic Youth. Banhart returned to the United States that fall and played music in San Francisco and Los Angeles, until he was discovered by Michael Gira, owner of Young God Records, after Siobhan Duffy, Gira&#x27;s wife, bought a copy of Banhart&#x27;s demo CD &quot;The Charles C. Leary&quot; and gave it to Gira.

Banhart and Gira compiled an album from Banhart&#x27;s recordings, and in 2002, &quot;Oh Me Oh My&quot;, which was made up of short fragments, was published by Young God Records and received favorable reviews. He recorded two other albums and an EP for the label: &quot;Rejoicing in the Hands&quot;, &quot;Niño Rojo&quot;, and &quot;The Black Babies&quot;; the releases had a simple acoustic sound. Banhart changed to XL Recordings in 2005 and released &quot;Cripple Crow&quot;, which was recorded in Bearsville Studios, New York, and had a more elaborate sound.

Banhart&#x27;s albums offer a variety of musical sounds, and he is often called the leader of the musical movement termed &quot;Freak Folk.&quot; His lyrics are fantastical, idealistic, and poetic with the occasional trace of innuendos.

In 2005, Banhart collaborated with Antony and the Johnsons on the album &quot;I Am a Bird Now&quot;. He sings the introduction to the song &quot;Spiraling&quot; and plays guitar on &quot;You Are My Sister&quot; in which Boy George also appears. In 2005, Banhart was in a relationship with Bianca Casady of the band CocoRosie, with Banhart living with Casady and her mother Christina Chalmers at Chalmer&#x27;s farm in Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, a Romani village in southern France. Banhart&#x27;s relationship with Casady ended in 2006. Banhart&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon&quot; detailed his break up with Casady.

Banhart was the first artist to design a T-shirt for the Yellow Bird Project, in 2006. He chose to donate the profits from the sale of his T-shirt to the Teenage Cancer Trust.

From 2007 to 2008, Banhart was romantically linked to actress Natalie Portman, who is featured in the video for Banhart&#x27;s song &quot;Carmensita&quot;.

He recorded his second album for XL Records, &quot;Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon&quot;, at his home studio in Topanga, California. The album charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 at number 115. The album&#x27;s song &quot;Lover&quot; was featured in the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Nick and Norah&#x27;s Infinite Playlist&quot;, which included a cameo appearance by Banhart.

Banhart has performed at Carnegie Hall and the Hollywood Bowl opening for Gilberto Gil, as well as at Bonnaroo and Coachella music festivals.

On October 27, 2009, Banhart released &quot;What Will We Be&quot;, his first record on Warner/Reprise. Banhart and Jon Beasley, who were credited as art directors for the album&#x27;s artwork and packaging, were nominated for a Grammy in 2011 for Best Recording Package.

The film &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;, directed by Todd Solondz, features a musical collaboration between Banhart and Beck. The song plays over the film&#x27;s end credits. Banhart sings lead vocals while Beck adds backing vocals and also recorded the track. The lyrics were written by Solondz and the music by composer Marc Shaiman.

Banhart is an avid skateboarder. In March 2010, he broke a bone in his right leg while skating, only hours before a concert in Phoenix. This resulted in the cancellation of future shows in Utah and Colorado.

In 2011, he collaborated with Marisa Monte and Rodrigo Amarante on a version of the song &quot;Nú Com a Minha Música&quot; for the Red Hot Organization&#x27;s most recent charitable album &quot;Red Hot + Rio 2&quot;.

Banhart&#x27;s music is often referred to as psychedelic folk, freak folk and New Weird America; it is associated with acts such as singer-songwriter Joanna Newsom, musical group CocoRosie, and contemporary folk band Vetiver. &quot;The New York Times&quot; has called his work &quot;free associative work&quot; and &quot;SPIN&quot; magazine has described it as &quot;ashram-appropriate guitar strums&quot; and &quot;trippy-hippie tone poetry.&quot; Critics have compared Banhart&#x27;s style to that of 1970s band Tyrannosaurus Rex, an early version of British rock musician Marc Bolan&#x27;s T. Rex, though in a 2004 interview Banhart stated that he was unaware of Tyrannosaurus Rex until after he began writing and recording music.

<doc id="933495" wikidata="Q1000158" url="?curid=933495" title="Panic of 1857">
<text>The Panic of 1857 was a financial crisis in the United States caused by the declining international economy and over-expansion of the domestic economy. Because of the invention of the telegraph by Samuel F. Morse in 1844, the Panic of 1857 was the first financial crisis to spread rapidly throughout the United States. The world economy was more interconnected by the 1850s, which made the Panic of 1857 the first worldwide economic crisis. In Britain, the Palmerston government circumvented the requirements of the Bank Charter Act 1844, which required gold and silver reserves to back up the amount of money in circulation. Surfacing news of this circumvention set off the Panic in Britain.

Beginning in September 1857, the financial downturn did not last long, but a proper recovery was not seen until the onset of the American Civil War in 1861. The sinking of in September 1857 contributed to the panic, since New York City banks were waiting on a much-needed shipment of gold that was being transported by the ship. After the failure of Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company, the financial panic quickly spread with businesses beginning to fail, the railroad industry experiencing financial declines, and hundreds of thousands of workers being laid off.

Because the years immediately preceding the Panic of 1857 were prosperous, many banks, merchants, and farmers had seized the opportunity to take risks with their investments, and, as soon as market prices began to fall, they quickly began to experience the effects of financial panic. American banks did not recover until after the Civil War.

==Background==
The early 1850s saw great economic prosperity in the United States, stimulated by the large amount of gold mined in the California Gold Rush that greatly expanded the money supply. By the mid-1850s, the amount of gold mined began to decline, causing western bankers and investors to become wary. Eastern banks became cautious with their loans in the eastern US, and some even refused to accept paper currencies issued by western banks.

The US Supreme Court decided &quot;Dred Scott v. Sandford&quot; in March 1857. After the enslaved man Dred Scott sued for his freedom, Chief Justice Roger Taney ruled that Scott was not a citizen because he was Black, and so did not have the right to sue in court. Taney also called the Missouri Compromise unconstitutional and said that the federal government could not prohibit slavery in US territories. The decision had a significant impact on the development of the western territories. Soon after the decision, &quot;the political struggle between &#x27;free soil&#x27; and slavery in the territories&quot; began.

The western territories north of the Missouri Compromise line were now opened to the expansion of slavery, which would obviously have drastic financial and political effects: &quot;Kansas land warrants and western railroad securities&#x27; prices declined slightly just after the Dred Scott decision in early March.&quot; This fluctuation in railroad securities proved &quot;that political news about future territories called the tune in the land and railroad securities markets&quot;.

Before 1857, the railroad industry had been booming due to large migrations of people to the west, especially to Kansas. The large influx of people made the railroads a profitable industry, and the banks began to provide railroad companies with large loans. Many of the companies never made it past the stage of a paper railroad and never owned the physical assets necessary to run a real one. Prices of railroad stocks as a whole began to experience a stock bubble, and railroad stocks saw increasingly-speculative entries into the fray, worsening the bubble. In the meantime, the Dred Scott decision lent uncertainty to railroads in general.

==Stock market decline==
In July 1857, railroad stock values peaked. On August 11, 1857, N. H. Wolfe and Company, the oldest flour and grain company in New York City, failed, shaking investor confidence and beginning a slow selling-off in the market that continued into late August.

==Failure of Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company==
On the morning of August 24, 1857, the president of Ohio Life Insurance and Trust Company announced that its New York branch had suspended payments. The company, an Ohio-based bank with a second main office in New York City, had large mortgage holdings and was the liaison to other Ohio investment banks. Ohio Life went bankrupt because of fraudulent activities by the company&#x27;s management, which threatened to precipitate the failure of other Ohio banks or, even worse, to create a run on the banks.

In an article printed in the &quot;New York Daily Times&quot;, Ohio Life&#x27;s &quot;New York City and Cincinnati [branches were] suspended; with liabilities, it is said, of $7,000,000&quot;. The banks connected to Ohio Life were reimbursed and &quot;avoided suspending convertibility by credibly coinsuring one another against runs&quot;. The failure of Ohio Life brought attention to the financial state of the railroad industry and land markets and caused the financial panic to become more public.

==Lasting effects==
By the spring of 1858, &quot;commercial credit had dried up, forcing already debt-ridden merchants of the West to curtail new purchases of inventory&quot;. The limited purchasing in the West led to merchants around the country seeing decreases in sales and profits. The railroads &quot;had created an interdependent national economy, and now an economic downturn in the West threatened... [an] economic crisis. Since many banks had financed railroads and land purchases, they began to feel the pressures of the falling value of railroad securities. The Illinois Central; Erie; Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne and Chicago; and Reading Railroad lines were all forced to shut down by the financial downturn. The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad and the Fond du Lac Railroad were forced to declare bankruptcy.

The Boston and Worcester Railroad Company experienced heavy financial difficulties. The employees were informed in a memo written in late October 1857 that &quot;the receipts from Passengers and Freight have fallen off during [the] last month, as compared with the corresponding month of last year, over twenty thousand dollars, with very little prospect of any improvement during the coming winter.&quot; The company announced that their workers would receive a &quot;reduction in pay of ten percent&quot;. In addition to the decreasing value of railroad securities, farmers began to default on payments on their mortgaged lands in the West, which put even more financial pressure on banks.

The prices of grain decreased significantly. Farmers experienced a loss in revenue, causing banks to foreclose on recently purchased lands. In 1855, grain prices had skyrocketed to $2.19 a bushel, and farmers began to purchase land to increase their crop supply, which increased their profits. By 1858, grain prices dropped severely to $0.80 a bushel. Many Midwestern towns felt the pressures of the Panic. For example, the town of Keokuk, Iowa, experienced financial strife from the economic downturns of the Panic:

A huge municipal debt magnified Keokuk&#x27;s problems. By 1858 the town owed $900,000, mostly on railroad bonds, while the value of its taxable property dropped by $5.5 million. Lots that brought $1,000 before the crash now could not be sold for $10. Hard-hit property owners were unable to pay their taxes, and thousands of properties slipped into tax delinquency.

As a result of such a decrease of prices, land sales declined dramatically and westward expansion essentially halted until the Panic ended. Both merchants and farmers began to suffer for the investment risks that they had taken when the prices were high.

==Remedies==
By 1859, the Panic began to level off, and the economy had begun to stabilize. President James Buchanan announced that the paper-money system seemed to be the root cause of the Panic and then decided to withdraw the usage of all bank notes under twenty dollars. He &quot;advised the State banks to break away from the banks [and urged] them to follow the example of the Federal Government&quot;.

He felt that would decrease the paper money supply to allow the specie supply time to increase and to reduce inflation rates. Buchanan wanted the state banks to follow the federal government, specifically the Independent Treasury system, which allowed the federal government to keep up with specie payments. That helped to alleviate some of the financial stress that had been brought on by the bank suspensions.

In his State of the Union message December 7, 1857, Buchanan said:
He revealed the new strategy of &quot;reform not relief&quot; and expressed his feeling that &quot;the government sympathized but could do nothing to alleviate the suffering individuals.&quot; To avoid further financial panics, Buchanan encouraged the US Congress to pass a law to provide the immediate forfeiture of a bank&#x27;s charter if a bank suspended specie payments. He asked state banks to keep one dollar in specie for every three issued as paper, and he discouraged the use of federal or state bonds as security on bank notes to avoid future inflation.

==Results==
The result of the Panic of 1857 was that the largely-agrarian southern economy, which had few railroads, suffered little, but the northern economy took a significant hit and made a slow recovery. The area affected the most by the Panic was the Great Lakes region, and the troubles of that region were &quot;quickly passed to those enterprises in the East that depended upon western sales&quot;. After approximately a year, much of the economy in the North and the entire South had recovered from the Panic.

By the end of the Panic, in 1859, tensions between the North and South regarding the issue of slavery in the United States were increasing. The Panic of 1857 encouraged those in the South who believed the North needed the South to keep a stabilized economy, and southern threats of secession were temporarily quelled. Southerners believed that the Panic of 1857 made the North &quot;more amenable to southern demands&quot; and would help to keep slavery alive in the United States.

According to Kathryn Teresa Long, the religious revival of 1857–1858 led by Jeremiah Lanphier began among New York City businessmen in the early months of the Panic.

== Crisis in the United Kingdom ==
News of the crisis in America caused runs on the banks in Glasgow, Liverpool, and London. The Borough Bank of Liverpool closed its doors on October 27, 1857, and the Western Bank of Scotland failed on November 9 as did the City of Glasgow Bank two days later. The government was forced to suspend the Bank Charter Act 1844 again on November 12.

The bullion in the Bank of England started increasing soon after, but unlike the Panic of 1847, the suspension was required this time for the British currency to remain legal and convertible under the Bank Charter Act 1844. The fiduciary issue was temporarily increased to the extent of £2 million and was used between November 18 and December 23, 1857.

<doc id="933503" wikidata="Q130279" url="?curid=933503" title="Nanobe">
<text>A nanobe () is a tiny filamental structure first found in some rocks and sediments. Some scientists hypothesize that nanobes are the smallest form of life, the size of the smallest known bacteria.

No conclusive evidence exists that these structures are, or are not, living organisms, so their classification is controversial.

The 1996 discovery of nanobes was published in 1998 by Uwins &quot;et al.&quot;, from the University of Queensland, Australia. They were found growing from rock samples (both full-diameter and sidewall cores) of Jurassic and Triassic sandstones, originally retrieved from an unspecified number of oil exploration wells off Australia&#x27;s west coast. Depths of retrieval were between and below the sea bed. While Uwins &quot;et al.&quot; present assertions against it, they do not exclude the possibility that the nanobes are from a surface contaminant, not from the rock units cited.

The smallest are just 20 nanometers in diameter. Some researchers believe that these structures are crystal growths, but the staining of these structures with dyes that bind to DNA might indicate that they are living organisms.

They are similar to the structures found in ALH84001, a Mars meteorite found in the Antarctic. A 2022 study concluded that ALH84001 did not contain Martian life; the discovered organic molecules were found to be associated with abiotic processes (ie, &quot;serpentinization and carbonation reactions that occurred during the aqueous alteration of basalt rock by hydrothermal fluids&quot;) produced on the very early Mars four billion years ago instead.

Nanobes are similar in size to nanobacteria, which are also structures that had been proposed to be extremely small living organisms. However, these two should not be confused: Nanobacteria were thought to be cellular organisms, while nanobes are hypothesized (by some) to be a previously unknown form of life or protocells.

== Claims ==
* It is a living organism (contains DNA or some analogue, and reproduces).
* Has a morphology similar to Actinomycetes and fungi.
* Nanobes are about 20 nm in diameter, which may be too small to contain the basic elements for an organism to exist (DNA, ribosomes, etc.), suggesting that if they grow and reproduce they would need to do so in an unconventional way.
* The Martian meteorite ALH84001, discovered in 1984 in the Antarctic, contained similar tubular structures which some astrobiologists suggested could be evidence of life at an earlier time on Mars.

==Responses==
A review in &quot;Microbes and Environments&quot; of the various ultra-small forms of proposed life states that the main criticism of nanobes is that they appear too small to contain the biochemical machinery needed to sustain life. The review also states that there is no evidence that nanobes are organisms in themselves and not fragments of larger organisms.

Tony Taylor was one of the authors of the original nanobe paper. He argues that the conspicuous lack of phosphorus in the X-ray spectroscopy data and the failure to find DNA using various DNA amplification techniques demonstrates that nanobes do not have any DNA or RNA. He also argues that they may have a completely different mechanism for heredity, which would account for many of their unusual chemical and physical properties.

<doc id="933512" wikidata="Q270388" url="?curid=933512" title="Jenny Holzer">
<text>Jenny Holzer (born July 29, 1950) is an American neo-conceptual artist, based in Hoosick, New York. Her work focuses on the delivery of words and ideas in public spaces and includes large-scale installations, advertising billboards, projections on buildings and other structures, and illuminated electronic displays.

Holzer belongs to the feminist branch of a generation of artists that emerged around 1980, and was an active member of Colab during this time, participating in the famous &quot;Times Square Show&quot;.

Among the most notable honors she has received for her contributions to the arts are the Leone d&#x27;Oro (1990), the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Crystal Award (1996), the rank of Officier des Arts et des Lettres (2016), the U.S. State Department&#x27;s International Medal of Arts (2017), and the &quot;Time&quot; 100 Award (2024), as well as honorary doctorates from Williams College, the Rhode Island School of Design, the New School, and Smith College.

== Early life and education ==
Holzer was born on July 29, 1950 in Gallipolis, Ohio. Originally aspiring to become an abstract painter, she took general art courses at Duke University (1968–70) and then studied painting, printmaking, and drawing at the University of Chicago before completing her BFA at Ohio University in 1972. After taking summer courses at the Rhode Island School of Design in 1974, she entered its MFA program in 1975. She moved to Manhattan in 1976, joined the Whitney Museum&#x27;s Independent Study Program, and began her first work with language, installation and public art. She received her MFA from RISD in 1977 and was an active member of Colab from 1977 to around 1981, participating in the famous &quot;Times Square Show&quot; and other Colab projects.

==Style, form and media==
Holzer is known as a neo-conceptual artist. Most of her work is presented in public spaces and includes words and ideas, in the form of word art (also known as text art.). The public dimension is integral to Holzer&#x27;s work. Her large-scale installations have included advertising billboards, projections on buildings and other architectural structures, and illuminated electronic displays. LED signs have become her most visible medium, although her diverse practice incorporates a wide array of media including street posters, painted signs, stone benches, paintings, photographs, sound, video, projections, the Internet, T-shirts for Willi Smith, and a race car for BMW. Text-based light projections have been central to Holzer&#x27;s practice since 1996. From 2010, her LED signs started becoming more sculptural. Holzer is no longer the author of her texts, and in the ensuing years, she returned to her roots by painting.

Holzer only uses capital letters in her work and frequently words or phrases are italicized. She has stated before that this is because she wants to &quot;show some sense of urgency and to speak a bit loudly&quot;.

Holzer belongs to the feminist branch of a generation of artists that emerged around 1980, looking for new ways to make narrative or commentary an implicit part of visual objects. Other female contemporaries include Barbara Kruger, Cindy Sherman, Sarah Charlesworth, and Louise Lawler.

The subject of Holzer&#x27;s work often relates to feminism and sexism. Her work discusses heavy subjects such as sexual assault against women. She has said that she gravitates towards subjects such as this due to family dysfunction she has experienced and because she claims &quot;we don&#x27;t need work on joy.&quot;

== Works ==


Holzer&#x27;s initial public works, &quot;Truisms&quot; (1977–79), are among her best-known. They first appeared as anonymous broadsheets that she printed in black italic script in capital letters on white paper and wheat-pasted to buildings, walls and fences in and around Manhattan. These one-liners are a distillation of an erudite reading list from the Whitney Independent Study Program, where she was a student. She printed other &quot;Truisms&quot; on posters, T-shirts and stickers, and carved them into stone benches. In late 1980, Holzer&#x27;s mail art and street leaflets were included in the exhibition &quot;Social Strategies by Women Artists&quot; at London&#x27;s Institute of Contemporary Arts, curated by Lucy Lippard.

In 1981, Holzer initiated the &quot;Living&quot; series, printed on aluminum and bronze plaques, the presentation format used by medical and government buildings. The &quot;Living&quot; series addressed the necessities of daily life: eating, breathing, sleeping, and human relationships. Her bland, short instructions were accompanied by paintings by American artist Peter Nadin, whose portraits of men and women attached to metal posts further articulated the emptiness of both life and message in the information age.

&quot;Inflammatory Essays&quot; was a work consisting of posters Holzer created from 1979 to 1982 and put up throughout New York. The statements on the posters were influenced by political figures including Emma Goldman, Vladimir Lenin, and Mao Tse-tung. In 2018 an excerpt from that work was printed on a card stitched onto the back of the dress Lorde wore to the Grammys; the excerpt read, &quot;Rejoice! Our times are intolerable. Take courage, for the worst is a harbinger of the best. Only dire circumstance can precipitate the overthrow of oppressors. The old &amp; corrupt must be laid to waste before the just can triumph. Contradiction will be heightened. The reckoning will be hastened by the staging of seed disturbances. The apocalypse will blossom.&quot; Others at the Grammys wore white roses or all-white clothes to express solidarity with the Time&#x27;s Up movement; Lorde wrote, &quot;My version of a white rose — THE APOCALYPSE WILL BLOSSOM — an excerpt from the greatest of all time, jenny holzer.&quot;

The medium of modern computer systems became an important component in Holzer&#x27;s work in 1982, when the artist installed her first large electronic sign on the Spectacolor board in New York&#x27;s Times Square. Sponsored by the Public Art Fund program, the use of light-emitting diodes (LEDs) allowed Holzer to reach a larger audience. The texts in her subsequent &quot;Survival&quot; series, compiled in 1983–85, speak to the great pain, delight, and ridiculousness of living in contemporary society. She began working with stone in 1986; for her exhibition that year at the Barbara Gladstone Gallery in New York, Holzer introduced a total environment where viewers were confronted with the relentless visual buzz of a horizontal LED sign and stone benches leading up to an electronic altar. Continuing this practice, her installation at the Guggenheim Museum in 1989 featured a 163-meter-long sign forming a continuous circle spiraling up a parapet wall. This installation was re-imagined by the Guggenheim in 2024 for her show, &quot;Light Line.&quot; 

In 1989, Jenny Holzer released the &quot;Laments&quot; series to the Dia Art Foundation in New York; this installation consisted of columns of colored lights and carved marble and granite tops that made up the laments. Holzer uses the passages she had read while being a part of the Whitney Independent Study Program by simplifying them for public consumption and applying them to her phrases. This series not only provokes thought in her audience through the constant reminder of death and sorrow but also exposes them to sources they normally wouldn&#x27;t come across. In an interview Holzer mentions that she uses the first person &quot;I&quot; simply to give the impression that a dead person is speaking and therefore make the installation more interesting to her audience. In &quot;Laments&quot; Jenny gave a voice to 13 different dead individuals, to say everything they might not have gotten the opportunity to while alive. She touches on topics like motherhood, violation, pain, torture, and even death on a personal level to these 13 individuals . Although &quot;Laments&quot; focuses mostly on the darkness of humanity and the tragedies we face daily there is also hidden optimism in the 13 laments.

In 1989, Holzer became the second female artist chosen to represent the United States at the Venice Biennale in Italy (Diane Arbus was the first, shown posthumously in 1972). At the 44th Biennale in 1990, her LED signboards and marble benches occupied a solemn and austere exhibition space in the American Pavilion; she also designed posters, hats, and T-shirts to be sold in the streets of Venice. The installation, &quot;Mother and Child&quot;, won Holzer the Leone D&#x27;Oro for best pavilion. The original installation is retained in its entirety in the collection of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, the organizing institution for the American Pavilion at the 1990 Biennale.

After taking a break from the art world, Holzer returned with controversy in 1993. Holzer came out with her &quot;Lustmord&quot; series, taking the title from the German word meaning &quot;sex murder&quot;. Holzer created the series as a response of the Bosnian War, specifically the widespread rape and murder of women. The work feature three poems that retell sex crimes from the perspective of the victim, the observer, and the perpetrator. &quot;Lustmord&quot; has taken many different forms from texts written in blue, black, and red ink on the skin, to the &quot;Lustmord&quot; Table, a series of different bones of the body laid on a wooden table, with silver bands wrapped around them, engraved with the text of the three poems.

While Holzer wrote the texts for the bulk of her work between 1977 and 2001, since 1993, she has mainly been using texts written by others, including literary texts from such authors as Polish Nobel laureate Wislawa Szymborska, Henri Cole (USA), Elfriede Jelinek (Austria), Fadhil Al Azzawi (Iraq), Yehuda Amichai (Israel), Mahmoud Darwish (Palestine), Khawla Dunia (Syria), and Mohja Kahf (Syrian American). As of 2010, Holzer&#x27;s work has been focused on government documents, concerning Iraq and the Middle East. Using texts from a very different context, more recent projects have involved the use of redacted government documents and passages from declassified U.S. Army documents from the war in Iraq. For example, a large LED work presents excerpts from the minutes of interrogations of American soldiers accused of committing human rights violations and war crimes in Abu Ghraib prison — making what was once secret public and exposing the &quot;military-commercial-entertainment complex&quot;.

Holzer&#x27;s work often concerns violence, oppression, sexuality, feminism, power, war and death; the artist often utilizes the rhetoric of modern information systems to address the politics of discourse. Her main aim is to enlighten, illuminating something thought in silence and meant to remain hidden.

Critic Samito Jalbuena has written that the artist&#x27;s public use of language and ideas often creates shocking juxtapositions — commenting on sexual identity and gender relations (&quot;Sex Differences Are Here To Stay&quot;) on an unassuming New York movie theater marquee, for example — and sometimes extends to flights of formal outrage (such as &quot;Abuse Of Power Comes As No Surprise&quot; in lights over Times Square).

=== Mixed media screen prints ===
At the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in 2007, Holzer presented a series of mixed media silk-screen prints; each of the 15 same-size, medium-large canvases, stained purple or brown, bears an all-black, silk-screened reproduction of a PowerPoint diagram used in 2002 to brief President Bush, Donald Rumsfeld and others on the United States Central Command&#x27;s plan for invading Iraq. Holzer found these documents at the Web site of the independent, nongovernmental National Security Archive (nsarchive.org), which obtained them through the Freedom of Information Act, and has used them as source material for her work since 2004. Other paintings depict confessions or letters from prisoners of all kinds and their families (parents pleading that the Army discharge rather than court-martial their sons); autopsy and interrogation reports; or exchanges concerning torture, as well as prisoners&#x27; handprints and maps of Baghdad. The censor&#x27;s marks are unmodified and the large sections of obscured text leave only sentence fragments or single words, echoes of the original content. Holzer concentrates on documents that have been partially or almost completely redacted with censor&#x27;s marks.

Based on a declassified report on US special forces&#x27; activity at a base in Gardez, Afghanistan, a 2014 series of paintings explores the story of Jamal Nasser, an 18-year-old Afghan soldier who died in US military custody.

=== Dance ===
Holzer&#x27;s first dance project was in 1985, &quot;Holzer Duet ... Truisms&quot; with Bill T. Jones. In 2010, she collaborated with choreographer Miguel Gutierrez for the Co-Lab series at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston. There were 10 dancers who performed in a room in which Holzer&#x27;s words were projected along the walls.

=== Publications by Holzer ===

She has also participated in Documenta 8, Kassel (1987), as well as in group exhibitions in major institutions such as the Stedelijk Museum, Den Bosch, The Netherlands, the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, and the Museum of Modern Art, New York. Holzer will participate in the 9th Gwangju Biennale (2012). According to the website for the 2015 &#x27;Dismaland&#x27; art installation led by Banksy, Holzer contributed works to the project.

Holzer had several solo exhibitions in the past several years. In 2014 her work was in &quot;Jenny Holzer: Projecto Parede&quot; at the Museu de Arte Moderna (MAM) of São Paulo in Brazil in 2014 as well as &quot;Jenny Holzer: Dust Paintings&quot; at Cheim &amp; Read in Chelsea, New York which exemplified her use of government documents as a source for her work. In 2015 she was in &quot;Jenny Holzer: Softer Targets&quot; at the Hauser &amp; Wirth, Somerset in Bruton, UK which featured new work and other pieces from the past three decades. Also in 2015 she had a solo exhibition at the Barbara Krakow Gallery in Boston, Massachusetts as well as &quot;War Paintings&quot; at Museo Correr in Venice, Italy. Then in the winter of 2016–17 at Alden Projects in New York, Holzer had the solo exhibition &quot;REJOICE! OUR TIMES ARE INTOLERABLE: Jenny Holzer&#x27;s Street Posters, 1977–1982&quot;, which showed her language-based posters that were pasted on the streets of New York.

&quot;Jenny Holzer and Christian Lemmerz: Lust&quot; was an exhibition on view from February 2017 to May 2017 at the Randers Kunstmuseum in Randers, Denmark. Holzer was also featured in the exhibition &quot;Woman Now&quot; at the Workhouse Arts Center in Lorton, Virginia, on view from January 2017 to April 2017; her work was shown alongside Andy Warhol and Joseph Beuys, among others, in the exhibition &quot;Creature at The Broad&quot; in Los Angeles California from November 2016 to March 2017. In February 2017 she was also in the &quot;Palm Springs Popup&quot; exhibition at Ikon, Ltd., in Santa Monica alongside artists such as Richard Prince, Ellsworth Kelly, and Bruce Nauman. From January 2017 through February 2017 she was in the &quot;Fischl, Holzer, Prince, Salle, Sherman&quot; exhibition at the Skarstedt Gallery in Chelsea, New York. Also, in the summer of 2016, Holzer was included in &quot;THE EIGHTIES: A Decade of Extremes&quot; exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art Antwerp in Belgium which explored the New York art scene in the eighties. In 2018, Holzer had the exhibition &quot;Artist Rooms: Jenny Holzer&quot; at Tate Modern in London. She has the entire second floor of Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (nine galleries) from March 22 to September 9, 2019 for &quot;Zera deskribaezina&quot; (It is irreversible).

Holzer is one of six artist-curators who made selections for &quot;Artistic License: Six Takes on the Guggenheim Collection&quot;, on view at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum from May 24, 2019 through January 12, 2020.

&quot;Jenny Holzer: Light Line&quot; was on view at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum from May 17 to September 29, 2024.

== Recognition ==
In addition to winning a Golden Lion for her work at the 44th Venice Biennale in 1990, Holzer has received several other prestigious awards, including the Art Institute of Chicago&#x27;s Blair Award (1982), the Skowhegan Medal for Installation (1994), the World Economic Forum&#x27;s Crystal Award (1996), the Berlin Prize fellowship (2000), the ranks of &quot;chevalier&quot; (2002) and &quot;officier&quot; (2016) in France&#x27;s Ordre des Arts et des Lettres, the Barnard Medal of Distinction (2011), the U.S. State Department&#x27;s International Medal of Arts (2017), and a place on &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s Time 100 list (2024).

In 2010, Holzer received the Distinguished Women in the Arts Award from the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles (MOCA). The annual award – recognizing women for their leadership and innovation in the visual arts, dance, music, and literature – is a bronze plaque originally designed by the artist in 1994, featuring one of her &quot;Truisms&quot;: &quot;It is in your self-interest to find a way to be very tender.&quot;

Holzer also holds honorary degrees from Williams College, the Rhode Island School of Design, The New School, and Smith College. In 2018 she was selected as a new member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

==Personal life==
In the early 1980s Holzer bought a farm in Hoosick, New York, and began dividing her time between there and a loft on Eldridge Street in Manhattan. She sold the loft in the late 1990s but still maintains a studio in Brooklyn. Her private art collection includes works by Alice Neel, Kiki Smith, Nancy Spero, and Louise Bourgeois.

In a 2021 interview with Literary Hub, Holzer said that she &quot;[has] a repressed spirituality&quot;, and stated, &quot;I am not religious in any conventional sense, but I am all for applying appropriate feeling that might make for sanity and better behavior.&quot; When asked if she considers herself to be a political artist, Holzer stated:
I&#x27;m an artist, and a person who is political; I make some separation here. I do not represent that art is as straightforward and immediately effective as voting or doing community work, and I don&#x27;t think art always can or should be pragmatic and utilitarian. At times, however, art can fuse a dreadful or wonderful reality with dreadful or wonderful representation so that people realize and feel what is, and then act.

Ahead of the 2024 United States presidential election, Holzer was one of 165 leading contemporary artists who contributed pieces to Artists for Kamala, an online sale with all proceeds raised going directly to Kamala Harris&#x27; campaign.

<text>Lieutenant General Walter David Alexander Lentaigne, (15 July 1899 – 24 June 1955), also known as Joe Lentaigne, was a senior officer in the British Indian Army.

==Early life==
Lentaigne was born the elder son of Justice Benjamin Plunkett Lentaigne of the Burma High Court. He was educated at The Oratory School, Edgbaston, Birmingham. His family had origins in Navan, County Meath in Ireland, but was domiciled in then Burma (a part of British India). He was one of two domiciled European officers serving in the Independent Indian Army, the other being T. B. Henderson Brooks.

Lentaigne had a brother, Commander Charles Nugent Lentaigne, who commanded , launched in July 1940, by Mary, daughter of Winston Churchill. The ship was originally to be named &quot;Larne&quot;; however, after the Tribal-class &quot;Gurkha&quot; was sunk in April 1940, the officers and men of the Gurkha Regiments each subscribed one day&#x27;s pay to replace her, and &quot;Larne&quot; was renamed before launching. Whilst escorting a Malta convoy, the ship was torpedoed 17 January 1942 off Sidi Barani and later scuttled.

==Military career==
Lentaigne joined British Indian Army as second lieutenant in October 1918 in 4th Gurkha Rifles. He fought in the Third Anglo-Afghan War in 1919. During the Second World War, he commanded a battalion during the 1942 Burma Campaign and was later given command of 63rd Indian Infantry Brigade.

In 1943, Lentaigne was personally selected by General Archibald Wavell (the Commander-in-Chief, India) to form and command the 111th Indian Infantry Brigade as a long-range penetration brigade. In 1944, in the midst of the second Chindit operation (Operation &quot;Thursday&quot;) he was appointed commander of the Chindit Force and led the force until it was disbanded in 1945.

Lentaigne then led the Indian Army&#x27;s jungle training programs as commander of the 39th Indian Infantry Division. He served in the postwar Indian Army and rose finally to the rank of lieutenant general. As the second Commandant of the newly created Defence Services Staff College, he was instrumental in seeking the creation of a unique inter-Services Staff College, based on experiences of the Second World War. He would serve as the Commandant from 1949 to 1955.

===Lentaigne and the Chindits===
Lentaigne was an outsider in the Chindit organization. He was appointed by General Wavell in the spring of 1943 to raise 111th Indian Brigade as a second Chindit Brigade. Because Wingate was in Burma conducting the Chindit operation (Operation &quot;Longcloth&quot;), he was unable to influence the choice. Wingate&#x27;s dislike of Indian Army officers and in particular officers of Gurkha battalions also worked against Lentaigne. He objected to the appointment after he learned of it but was unable to do anything about it.

On Wingate&#x27;s death, Lentaigne took over command of the Chindit organization. He was the senior most officer in the Chindits and also had the most command experience. General Slim described the problems involved in replacing Wingate within the Chindits: &#x27;To step into Wingate&#x27;s place would be no easy task. His successor had to be someone known to the men of Special Force, one who had shared their hardships and in whose skill and courage they could trust&#x27;.
Again, &quot;British Commanders&quot; states &quot;the inevitable choice for the new chief of the Chindits was Major General Lentaigne. He was one of Wingate&#x27;s closest disciples and a veteran of the Burma fighting.&quot;

Amongst his rivals for the position including Mike Calvert and Derek Tulloch there was criticism of this decision. They alleged that Lentaigne was the Chindit leader least in tune with Wingate&#x27;s methods and tactics. They also pointed out that he had commanded 111 Indian Brigade in the field for only a few weeks. After the war, certain of his rivals used the comments of his Brigade Major John Masters with regard to Lentaigne&#x27;s age out of context to attack him.

Lentaigne had been a distinguished battalion commander who had fought during the 1942 Burma campaign. The other Chindit brigade commanders were unknown quantities lacking Staff College qualifications or significant time in command of even a battalion-sized formation. Additionally, there was no clear successor to Wingate even among his closest followers. Each of them thought that they would have been (or were) Wingate&#x27;s obvious successor. Field Marshal Lord Slim wrote in his memoirs of the Burma War, Defeat into Victory, that after Wingate&#x27;s death, at least three officers went to him, and told him, separately and confidentially, that Wingate had designated each of them as the divisional commander, in the event of his death.

==Post-war career==
In his book &quot;Red Coats to Olive Green&quot;, Colonel V. Longer has listed Lentaigne as one of the handful of British general officers to be offered attachment to, and service in, the post-independence Indian Army. Among the others were General Sir Rob Lockhart, Lieutenant General Sir Dudley Russell, and Major General H. Williams, who, as engineer-in-chief, was the last to retire, late in 1955. He was acting Director Military Operations but was eased out as he proposed a 25-mile border corridor in Punjab under British troops to save innocent people.(Ref. Transfer of Power, 8 Aug 1947 meeting) Nehru opposed him tooth and nail and was overruled by Mountbatten. In February 1948, he was asked to lead Defence Services Staff College (DSSC), Wellington in the Nilgiris in what&#x27;s now the south Indian state of Tamil Nadu. In 1950, he predicted problems for India after conquest of Tibet by China and sparred with visiting foreign secretary of India at Wellington. (Ref. Himalayan Blunder by John Dalvi). He would serve as the Commandant DSSC Wellington from 1948 to 1955. He retired in 1955 and died soon after returning to London.

<doc id="933515" wikidata="Q1124327" url="?curid=933515" title="Horse meat">
<text>Horse meat forms a significant part of the culinary traditions of many countries, particularly in Europe and Asia. The eight countries that consume the most horse meat consume about 4.3million horses a year. For the majority of humanity&#x27;s early existence, wild horses were hunted as a source of protein.

==History==
Archaic humans hunted wild horses for hundreds of thousands of years following their first arrival in Eurasia. Examples of sites demonstrating horse butchery by archaic humans include: the Boxgrove site in southern England dating to around 500,000 years ago, where horse bones with cut marks (with a horse scapula possibly exhibiting a spear wound) are associated with Acheulean stone tools made by &quot;Homo heidelbergensis,&quot; the Schöningen site in Germany (also thought to have been created by &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot;) dating to around 300,000 years ago, where butchered horses are associated with wooden spears (the Schöningen spears, amongst the oldest known wooden spears), as well as the Lingjing site in Henan, China dating to 125-90,000 years ago. During the Upper Palaeolithic, there is evidence for the hunting of horses by modern humans in Europe, as well as Asia. Early Paleoindians in North America hunted the continent&#x27;s native horses shortly prior to their extinction.

In many parts of Europe, the consumption of horse meat continued throughout the Middle Ages until modern times, despite a ban on horse meat by Pope Gregory III in 732. Horse meat was also eaten as part of Germanic pagan religious ceremonies in Northern Europe. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Spaniards, followed by other European settlers, reintroduced horses to the Americas. Some horses became feral, and began to be hunted by the indigenous Pehuenche people of what is now Chile and Argentina. Initially, early humans hunted horses as they did other game; later, they began to raise them for meat, milk and transport. The meat was, and still is, preserved by being sun-dried in the high Andes into a product known as &quot;charqui&quot;.

France dates its taste for horse meat to the Revolution. With the fall of the aristocracy, its auxiliaries had to find new means of subsistence. The horses formerly maintained by the aristocracy as a sign of prestige ended up being used to alleviate the hunger of the masses. During the Napoleonic campaigns, the surgeon-in-chief of Napoleon&#x27;s Grand Army, Baron Dominique-Jean Larrey, advised the starving troops to eat the meat of horses. At the siege of Alexandria, the meat of young Arab horses relieved an epidemic of scurvy. At the battle of Eylau in 1807, Larrey served horse as soup and as &quot;bœuf à la mode&quot;. At Aspern-Essling (1809), cut off from the supply lines, the cavalry used the breastplates of fallen &quot;cuirassiers&quot; as cooking pans and gunpowder as seasoning, thus founding a practice that carried on until at least the Waterloo campaign.

Horse meat gained widespread acceptance in French cuisine during the later years of the Second French Empire. The high cost of living in Paris prevented many working-class citizens from buying meat such as pork or beef; in 1866, the French government legalized the eating of horse meat, and the first butcher&#x27;s shop specializing in horse meat opened in eastern Paris, providing quality meat at lower prices.

During the Siege of Paris (1870–1871), horse meat, along with the meat of donkeys and mules, was eaten by anyone who could afford it, partly because of a shortage of fresh meat in the blockaded city, and also because horses were eating grain that was needed by the human populace. Though large numbers of horses were in Paris (estimates suggested between 65,000 and 70,000 were butchered and eaten during the siege), the supply was ultimately limited. Not even champion racehorses were spared (two horses presented to Napoleon III of France by Alexander II of Russia were slaughtered), but the meat became scarce. Many Parisians gained a taste for horse meat during the siege, and after the war ended, horse meat remained popular. Likewise, in other places and times of siege or starvation, horses are viewed as a food source of last resort.

Despite the general Anglophone taboo, horse and donkey meat was eaten in Britain, especially in Yorkshire, until the 1930s, and, in times of postwar food shortages, surged in popularity in the United States and was considered for use as hospital food. A 2007 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article about horse meat brought to the United States from Canada described the meat as &quot;a sweet, rich, superlean, oddly soft meat, and closer to beef than to venison&quot;.

==Nutrition==

Horse meat has a slightly sweet taste reminiscent of beef. Many consumers allege not being able to tell the difference between beef and horse meat.

Meat from younger horses tends to be lighter in color, while older horses produce richer color and flavor, as with most mammals. Horse meat can be used to replace beef, pork, mutton, venison, and any other meat in virtually any recipe. Horse meat is usually very lean. Jurisdictions that allow for the slaughter of horses for food rarely have age restrictions, so many are quite young, some even as young as 16 to 24 months old.

==Production==
In most countries where horses are slaughtered for food, they are processed in a similar fashion to cattle, i.e., in large-scale factory slaughter houses (abattoirs) where they are stunned with a captive bolt gun and bled to death. In countries with a less industrialized food-production system, horses and other animals are slaughtered individually outdoors as needed, in or near the village where they will be consumed.

In 2005, the eight principal horse meat-producing countries produced over 700,000 tonnes of it. In 2005, the five biggest horse meat-consuming countries were China (421,000 tonnes), Mexico, Russia, Italy, and Kazakhstan (54,000 tonnes). In 2010, Mexico produced 140,000 tonnes, China 126,000 tonnes, and Kazakhstan 114,000 tonnes.

==Use==
As horses are relatively poor converters of grass and grain to meat compared to cattle, in the western countries they are not usually bred or raised specifically for their meat. Instead, horses are slaughtered when their monetary value as riding or work animals is low, but their owners can still make money selling them for horse meat, for example in the routine export of the southern English ponies from the New Forest, Exmoor, and Dartmoor. British law requires the use of &quot;equine passports&quot; even for semiferal horses to enable traceability (also known as &quot;provenance&quot;), so most slaughtering is done in the UK before the meat is exported, meaning that the animals travel as carcasses rather than live. Ex-racehorses, riding horses, and other horses sold at auction may also enter the food chain; sometimes, these animals have been stolen or purchased under false pretenses. Even prestigious horses may end up in the slaughterhouse; the 1986 Kentucky Derby winner and 1987 Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year winner, Ferdinand, is believed to have been slaughtered in Japan, probably for pet food.

A misconception exists that horses are commonly slaughtered for pet food. In many countries, such as the United States, horse meat was outlawed for use in pet food in the 1970s. American horse meat is considered a delicacy in Europe and Japan, and its cost is in line with veal, so it would be prohibitively expensive in many countries for pet food.

Meat from horses that veterinarians have put down with a lethal injection is not suitable for human consumption, as the toxin remains in the meat; the carcasses of such animals are sometimes cremated (most other means of disposal are problematic, due to the toxin). Remains of euthanized animals can be rendered, which maintains the value of the skin, bones, fats, etc., for such purposes as fish food. This is commonly done for lab specimens (e.g., pigs) euthanized by injection. The amount of drug (e.g. a barbiturate) is insignificant after rendering.

Carcasses of horses treated with some drugs are considered edible in some jurisdictions. For example, according to Canadian regulation, hyaluron, used in treatment of particular disorders in horses, in HY-50 preparation, should not be administered to animals to be slaughtered for horse meat. In Europe, however, the same preparation is not considered to have any such effect, and edibility of the horse meat is not affected.

==Attitudes towards horse meat==

Horse meat is commonly eaten in many countries in Europe and Asia. It is not a generally available food in some English-speaking countries such as the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, the United States, and English Canada. It is also taboo in Brazil, Ireland, Poland and Israel and among the Romani. Horse meat is not generally eaten in Spain, except in the north, but the country exports horses both as live animals and as slaughtered meat for the French and Italian markets. Horse meat is consumed in some North American and Latin American countries, but is illegal in some others. The Food Standards Code of Australia and New Zealand definition of &#x27;meat&#x27; does not include horse. In Tonga, horse meat is eaten nationally, and Tongan emigrants living in the United States, New Zealand, and Australia have retained a taste for it, claiming Christian missionaries originally introduced it to them.

The consumption of horse meat has been common in Central Asian societies, past or present, due to the abundance of steppes suitable for raising horses. In North Africa, horse meat has been occasionally consumed, it has never been eaten in the Maghreb.

Horse meat is forbidden by Jewish dietary laws because horses are not ruminants and do not have cloven hooves and are therefore not kosher.

In the eighth century, Popes Gregory III and Zachary instructed Saint Boniface, missionary to the Germans, to forbid the eating of horse meat to those he converted, due to its association with Germanic pagan ceremonies. The people of Iceland allegedly expressed reluctance to embrace Christianity for some time, largely over the issue of giving up horse meat. Pope Gregory III&#x27;s penal law banning horse meat consumption was abrogated by the 1983 Code of Canon Law. Horse meat is now currently consumed in Iceland, and many horses are raised for this purpose. The culturally close people of Sweden still have an ambivalent attitude to horse meat, said to stem from this edict.

Henry Mayhew describes the difference in the acceptability and use of the horse carcass between London and Paris in &quot;London Labour and the London Poor&quot; (1851). Horse meat was rejected by the British, but continued to be eaten in other European countries such as France and Germany, where knackers often sold horse carcasses despite the papal ban. Even the hunting of wild horses for meat continued in the area of Westphalia. Londoners also suspected that horse meat was finding its way into sausages and that offal sold as that of oxen was, in fact, equine.

While no taboo on eating horse meat exists &quot;per se&quot;, it is generally considered by ethnic Russians to be a low-quality meat with poor taste, and it is rarely found in stores. It is popular among such historically nomadic peoples as the Tatars, Kyrgyz, and Kazakhs.

===Taboos===

In 732 AD, Pope Gregory III began a concerted effort to stop the ritual consumption of horse meat in pagan practice. While the pope&#x27;s penal law has been abrogated, in some countries, the effects of this prohibition by the Catholic Church have lingered, and horse meat prejudices have progressed from taboos to avoidance to abhorrence. In a study conducted by Fred Simoons, the avoidance of horse meat in American culture is less likely due to lingering feelings from Gregory&#x27;s prohibition, but instead due to an unfamiliarity with the meat compared to more mainstream offerings. In other parts of the world, horse meat has the stigma of being something poor people eat and is seen as a cheap substitute for other meats, such as pork and beef. In any case, Pope Gregory&#x27;s law is no longer in force, so there is no prohibition now for Catholics to eat horse meat (other than on abstinence days). 

According to the anthropologist Marvin Harris, some cultures class horse meat as taboo because the horse converts grass into meat less efficiently than ruminants.

Totemistic taboo is also a possible reason for refusal to eat horse meat as an everyday food, but did not necessarily preclude ritual slaughter and consumption. Roman sources state that the goddess Epona was widely worshipped in Gaul and southern Britain. Epona, a triple-aspect goddess, was the protectress of the horse and horse keepers, and horses were sacrificed to her; she was paralleled by the Irish Macha and Welsh Rhiannon. In &quot;The White Goddess&quot;, Robert Graves argued that the taboo among Britons and their descendants was due to worship of Epona, and even earlier rites. The Uffington White Horse is probable evidence of ancient horse worship. The ancient Indian Kshatriyas engaged in horse sacrifices and horse meat consumption, one of which is Ashwamedha Yajna as recorded in the Vedas and Ramayana and Mahabharata, but in the context of the ritual sacrifice, it is not &quot;killed&quot;, but instead smothered to death. Also Ancient Indians consumed horse meat. In 1913, the Finnic Mari people of the Volga region were observed to practice a horse sacrifice.

In ancient Scandinavia, the horse was very important, as a living, working creature, as a sign of the owner&#x27;s status, and symbolically within Old Norse religion. Horses were slaughtered as a sacrifice to the gods, and the meat was eaten by the people taking part in the religious feasts. When the Nordic countries were Christianized, eating horse meat was regarded as a sign of paganism and prohibited. A reluctance to eat horse meat is common in these countries even today.

===Opposition to production===
The killing of horses for human consumption is widely opposed in countries such as the U.S., the UK and Greece where horses are generally considered to be companion and sporting animals only. In ancient Greece horses were revered and horse slaughter is forbidden by law; this is also the case in modern Greece, as horses are considered companions and a symbol of beauty, strength and pride. French former actress and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot has spent years crusading against the eating of horse meat. However, the opposition is far from unanimous; a 2007 readers&#x27; poll in the London magazine &quot;Time Out&quot; showed that 82% of respondents supported chef Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s decision to serve horse meat in his restaurants.

==Around the world==

===South America===

====Argentina====
Argentina is a producer and exporter of horse meat, but it is not used in local consumption and is considered taboo.

====Chile====
In Chile, it is used in &quot;charqui&quot;. Also in Chile, horse meat became the main source of nutrition for the nomadic indigenous tribes, which promptly switched from a guanaco-based economy to a horse-based one after the horses brought by the Spaniards bred naturally and became feral.

Although not nearly as common as beef meat, horse meat can be readily available in some butcheries throughout the country. It is generally less expensive than beef and somewhat associated with lower social strata.

====Uruguay====
In Uruguay horses are appreciated for their companionship and horse meat shouldn&#x27;t be consumed, as it constitutes a taboo that dates back from Spaniard ancestry at colony times. There&#x27;s a saying that preaches: &quot;a lomo de caballo criollo se hizo la patria&quot; (on criollo horse back the nation was made). However the country produces horse meat to be exported to France and China. Also a common belief is that horse meat is locally used to make salami. Slaughtering horses are fierce untamed colts.

===North America===

====Canada====
A small horse meat business exists in Quebec. Horse meat is also for sale in Granville Island Market in Vancouver, where according to a &quot;Time&quot; reviewer who smuggled it into the United States, it turned out to be a &quot;sweet, rich, superlean, oddly soft meat, closer to beef than venison&quot;. Horse meat is also available in high-end Toronto butchers and supermarkets. CBC News reported on March 10, 2013, that horse meat was also popular among some segments of Toronto&#x27;s population.

Despite this, most of Canada shares the horse meat taboo with the rest of the English-speaking world.

This mentality is especially evident in Alberta, where strong horse racing and breeding industries and cultures have existed since the province&#x27;s founding, although large numbers of horses are slaughtered for meat in Fort MacLeod, and certain butchers in Calgary do sell it.

In 2013, the consumer protection show &quot;Kassensturz&quot; of Swiss television SRF reported the poor animal conditions at Bouvry Exports, a Canadian horse meat farm in Fort MacLeod, Alberta. Migros, the primary importer of horse meat into Switzerland, started working with Bouvry to improve their animal welfare, but in 2015 Migros cut ties with Bouvry because though improvements had been made, they had not improved sufficiently. Migros had &quot;set itself the ambitious goal of bringing all suppliers abroad up to the strict Swiss standards by 2020&quot;.

====Mexico====
, Mexico was the second-largest producer of horse meat in the world. By 2009, it became the largest producer of horse meat in the world. While horse meat is produced in Mexico, the practice of eating horse meat is not widely accepted. It is only exported as it is not used or consumed in Mexico. Any domestic consumption is attributed to non-human consumption such as carnivorous zoo animals.

====United States====
Horse meat is generally not eaten in the United States, and is banned in many states in the country. It holds a strong cultural taboo in American culture with 83% of Americans supporting a national ban on horse slaughter. 

 However, a thriving horse exportation business is going on in several states, including Texas, primarily exporting horses to slaughterhouses in either Canada or Mexico.

Restriction of human consumption of horse meat in the U.S. has involved legislation at local, state, and federal levels. Several states have enacted legislation either prohibiting the sale of horse meat or banning altogether the slaughter of horses.

California outlawed in 1998 via ballot proposition the possession, transfer, reception, or holding any horse, pony, burro, or mule by a person who is aware that it will be used for human consumption, and making the slaughter of horses or the sale of horse meat for human consumption a misdemeanor offense.

In 2007, the Illinois General Assembly enacted Public Act 95–02, amending Chapter 225, Section 635 of the state&#x27;s compiled statutes to prohibit both the act of slaughtering equines for human consumption and the trade of any horse meat similarly to Texas Agriculture Code&#x27;s Chapter 149.

Other states banning horse slaughter or the sale of horse meat include New Jersey, Oklahoma, and Mississippi. In addition, several other states introduced legislation to outlaw the practice over the years, such as Florida, Massachusetts, New Mexico, and New York.

At the federal level, since 2001, several bills have been regularly introduced in both the House and Senate to ban horse slaughter throughout the country without success. However, a budgetary provision banning the use of federal funds to carry out mandatory inspections at horse slaughter plants (necessary to allow interstate sale and exports of horse meat) has also been in place since 2007. This restriction was temporarily removed in 2011 as part of the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2012 but was again included in the FY2014 Agriculture Appropriations Act and subsequent federal budgets, hence preventing the operation of any domestic horse slaughter operation.

Until 2007, only three horse meat slaughterhouses still existed in the United States for export to foreign markets, but they were closed by court orders resulting from the upholding of aforementioned Illinois and Texas statutes banning horse slaughter and the sale of horse meat.

The taboo surrounding horse meat in the United States received national attention again in May 2017 when a restaurant in the Lawrenceville section of Pittsburgh served a dish containing horse tartare as part of a special event the restaurant was hosting with French Canadian chefs as guests. The restaurant, which otherwise does not serve horse meat (which is legal to serve and consume in Pennsylvania), received an inspection and a warning from the USDA not to serve horse meat again. A Change.org petition subsequently went up to advocate making serving horse meat illegal in Pennsylvania.

From the 1920s and through the 1950s or 1960s, with a brief lapse during World War II, horse meat was canned and sold as dog food by many companies under many brands, most notably Ken-L Ration. Horse meat as dog food became so popular that by the 1930s, over 50,000 horses were bred and slaughtered each year to keep up with this specific demand.

===Europe===

====Austria====

Horse &quot;Leberkäse&quot; is available in special horse butcheries and occasionally at various stands, sold in a bread roll. Dumplings can also be prepared with horse meat, spinach, or Tyrolean (a sour milk cheese). Such dumplings are occasionally eaten on their own, in a soup, or as a side dish.

====Belgium====
In Belgium, horse meat ( in Dutch and in French) is popular in a number of preparations. Lean, smoked, and sliced horse meat fillet ( or ; in French) is served as a cold cut with sandwiches or as part of a cold salad. Horse steaks can be found in most butchers and are used in a variety of preparations. The city of Vilvoorde has a few restaurants specialising in dishes prepared with horse meat. Horse sausage is a well-known local specialty in Lokeren (Lokerse paardenworst) and Dendermonde with European recognition. Smoked or dried horse/pork meat sausage, similar to salami, is sold in a square shape to be distinguished from pork and/or beef sausages. A Flemish region around the Rupel River is also famous for a horse stew named , made out of shoulder chuck (or similar cuts), brown ale, onions, and mustard. is typically served with fries, mayonnaise, and a salad of raw Belgian endive.

====Bulgaria====
Horse meat is served in some restaurants in Bulgaria, as the preferred way of consuming it is in the form of steaks and burgers. Still being far from a meat for mass consumption, horse meat is regaining its popularity, which it had in the &#x27;60s and &#x27;70s of the past century, when it was also consumed in sausages and &quot;tartare&quot;.

====Finland====

Horse meat is available in butcher shops and shops specializing in meats but it can sometimes be found in supermarkets, especially in ground form. The most common way to eat horse meat is in sausage form, especially (&quot;Mettwurst&quot;), a cured and smoked sausage which often contains pork, beef and horse meat. Finns consume around 400g of horse meat per person per year and the country produces around 300–400 thousand kilograms of meat per year, while importing around 1.5 million kilograms per year from countries like Canada, Mexico or Argentina. No horses are bred for meat production and there are stringent laws against using meat from a horse that has been medicated or injected with antibiotics. Using meat from a horse that has been treated with non-equine medicine or has not been inspected by a veterinarian is banned outright.

====France====
In France, specialized butcher shops () sell horse meat, as ordinary butcher shops were for a long time forbidden to deal in it. However, since the 1990s, it can be found in supermarket butcher shops and others. Horse meat was eaten in large amounts during the 1870 Siege of Paris, when it was included in &quot;haute cuisine&quot; menus.

Horse fat is highly rated for making french fries, though rarely used nowadays. In 2023, the last remaining horse butcher in Paris described the meat as &quot;going out of fashion&quot; as he announced his retirement.

====Germany====
Although no taboo comparable to that in the English-speaking world exists, German law used to proscribe that horse meat be sold only by specialized butchers (). This proscription was abolished in 1993, but only a small minority of ordinary butchers have since begun to sell horse meat. , most horse meat was still sold by the specialists, some of whom also delivered by mail order.

Many regions of Germany have traditional recipes that include horse meat. In the Rhineland around Cologne and Düsseldorf, restaurants often offer the traditional &quot;Sauerbraten&quot; in horse meat, typically with a beef variant to choose from. Other traditional horse meat dishes include the Swabian (a joint of roast meat prepared similarly to roast beef), Bavarian sausage varieties such as and as well as , a meatloaf dish.

The 2013 meat adulteration scandal started when German authorities detected horse meat in prepared food products including frozen lasagna, where it was declared fraudulently as beef. The mislabeling prompted EU authorities to speed up publication of European Commission recommendations for labeling the origin of all processed meat.

====Hungary====
In Hungary, horse meat is primarily used in salami and sausages, usually mixed with pork, but also in goulashes and other stews. These products are sold in most supermarkets and many butcher shops.

====Iceland====

In Iceland, horse meat is both eaten minced and as steak, also used in stews and fondue, prized for its strong flavor. It has a particular role in the culture and history of the island. The people of Iceland supposedly were reluctant to embrace Christianity for some time largely over the issue of giving up horse meat after Pope Gregory III banned horse meat consumption in 732 AD, as it was a major part of many pagan rites and sacrifice in Northern Europe.

Horse meat consumption was banned when the pagan Norse Icelanders eventually adopted Christianity in 1000 AD/Common Era. The ban became so ingrained that most people would not handle horse meat, let alone consume it. Even during harsh famines in the 18th century, most people would not eat horse meat, and those who did were castigated. In 1757, the ban was decriminalised, but general distaste for horse meat lasted well into the 19th century, possibly longer, and its consumption often regarded as an indication of poverty. Even today horse meat is not popular (3.2% of Iceland&#x27;s meat production in 2015), although this has more to do with culinary tradition and the popularity of equestrianism than any religious vestiges.

====Ireland====
Horse meat is not widely consumed in Ireland. It was DNA sampling efforts of Irish-company IdentiGEN that led to the discovery of horse meat in the European food chain, leading to the 2013 horse meat scandal. However, a 2024 investigation by RTÉ News disclosed that even after improvements made since 2013, meat traceability issues still remain. They uncovered deliberate alteration of horse identities to obscure that certain horses had already been deemed &quot;unfit for human consumption&quot;. This was done through changing microchips and horse passports, and in some cases by transporting live horses to other countries where new identities were obtained.

====Italy====

Horse meat is especially popular in Sicily. In Sicily is part of the traditional historical cuisine of the entire island (especially in the Catania area). Sicily is also the Italian region with the greatest production. In the rest of Italy it remains isolated to some typical dishes.

Horse meat is used in a variety of recipes: as a stew called (typical of Verona), served as steaks, as &quot;carpaccio&quot;, or made into &quot;bresaola&quot;. Thin strips of horse meat called are popular. Horse fat is used in recipes such as &quot;&quot;. Horse meat sausages and salamis are traditional in various places. In Sardinia, or and for horse meat) is one of the most renowned meats and sometimes is sold from kiosks with bread – also in the town of Sassari is a long tradition of eating horse steaks ( in the local dialect). Chefs and consumers tend to prize its uniqueness by serving it as rare as possible. Donkey is also cooked, for example as a stew called and as meat for sausages e.g. . The cuisine of Parma features a horse meat &quot;tartare&quot; called , as well as various cooked dishes.

In Veneto, the consumption of horse meat dates back to at least 1000 BC/BCE to the Adriatic Veneti, renowned for their horse-breeding skills. They were used to sacrifice horses to their goddess Reitia or to the mythical hero Diomedes. Throughout the classical period, Veneto established itself as a centre for horse breeding in Italy; Venetian horses were provided for the cavalry and carriage of the Roman legions, with the white Venetic horses becoming famous among Greeks and Romans as one of the best breeds for circus racing. As well as breeding horses for military and farming applications, the Venetics also used them for consumption throughout the Roman period, a practice that established the consumption of horse meat as a tradition in Venetian cuisine. In the modern age, horse meat is considered a luxury item and is widely available through supermarkets and butcheries, with some specialised butcheries offering only selected cuts of equine meat. Prices are usually higher than beef, pork, or any other kind of meat, except game.

In the province of Padua, horse meat is a key element of the local cuisine, particularly in the area that extends southeast from the city, historically called Saccisica. Specialties based on horse meat constitute the main courses and best attractions of several typical restaurants in the zone. They are also served among other regional delicacies at the food stands of many local festivals, related to civil and religious anniversaries. Most notable is the , held annually in the small town of Legnaro and totally dedicated to horses, included their consumption for food.

Some traditional dishes are:

*: tiny frayings of horse meat, dried and seasoned; to be consumed raw, can be a light and quick snack, more popular as a topping on other dishes: ex. pasta, risotto, pizza, salads, etc. 
*: a thin soft horse steak, cut from the diaphragm, variously cooked and dressed on the grill, pan or hot-plate
*: colt steak, whose preparation is similar to 
*: also said , small chunks of horse meat, stewed with onion, parsley and/or other herbs and flavours, potatoes, broth, wine, etc., usually consumed with polenta, much appreciated also is a similar stew made of donkey meat, served in traditional trattorie, with many variations for different villages: , , , 
*: horse ham, served in very thin slices
* or : various kinds of salami, variously produced or seasoned, sometimes made of pure equine meat, sometimes mixed with others (beef or pork)
*&quot;Bigoli&quot; : a typical form of fresh pasta, similar to thick rough spaghetti, dressed with sauce like Bolognese sauce, but made with minced horse meat
*: horse stew, seasoned with sauce, vegetables and various peperoncino, widely used in the Salento 
In southern Italy, horse meat is commonly eaten everywhere – especially in the region of Apulia, where it is considered a delicacy. It is a vital part of the () in Bari and of the , a stew with tomato sauce, vegetables and chili, popular in Salento.

According to British food writer Matthew Fort, &quot;The taste for donkey and horse goes back to the days when these animals were part of everyday agricultural life. In the frugal, unsentimental manner of agricultural communities, all the animals were looked on as a source of protein. Waste was not an option.&quot;

====Malta====
In Malta, horse meat () is seared and slowly cooked for hours in either tomato or red wine sauce. A few horse meat shops still exist and it is still served in some restaurants.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, smoked horse meat () is sold as sliced meat and eaten on bread. , a southern Dutch stew, is made with horse meat as main ingredient. There are also beef-based variants. Horse meat is also used in sausages ( and &quot;frikandel&quot;), fried fast food snacks and ready-to-eat soups.

====Norway====
In Norway, horse meat is commonly used in cured meats, such as and , and less commonly as steak, .

In pre-Christian Norway, horse was seen as an expensive animal. To eat a horse was to show one had great wealth, and to sacrifice a horse to the gods was seen as the greatest gift one could give. When Norwegians adopted Christianity, horse-eating became taboo as it was a religious act for pagans, thus it was considered a sign of heresy. These days, consumption of horse meat is considered controversial, but not uncommon.

====Poland====
Older horses are often exported while still alive to Italy to be slaughtered. This practice is considered controversial. Horses in Poland are treated mostly as companions, and the majority of Poles are against live export for slaughter. Poland has a tradition of eating horse meat (e.g., sausage or steak &quot;tartare&quot;.) The consumption of horse meat was highest at times when other meat was scarce, such as during the Second World War and the communist period that followed it.

====Serbia====
Horse meat is generally available in Serbia, though mostly shunned in traditional cuisine. It is, however, often recommended by general practitioners to persons who suffer from anemia. It is available to buy at three green markets in Belgrade, a market in Niš, and in several cities in ethnically mixed Vojvodina, where Hungarian and previously German traditions brought the usage.

====Slovenia====

Horse meat is generally available in Slovenia, and is highly popular in the traditional cuisine, especially in the central region of Carniola and in the Karst region. The horse breed known as Slovenian Cold-blood is raised for meat as well as for pulling. Colt steak () is also highly popular, especially in Slovenia&#x27;s capital Ljubljana, where it is part of the city&#x27;s traditional regional cuisine. In Ljubljana, many restaurants sell burgers and meat that contain large amounts of horse meat, including a fast-food chain called Hot&#x27; Horse.

====Spain====
&quot;Cecina&quot; is a cured meat made from beef or horse, and is considered a delicacy. Foal meat () is preferred over horse meat for this purpose. Horse meat is easily found in supermarkets, and usually prepared as a stew or as steak. A common practice is to serve horse meat to anemic children. Although no generalized taboo exists in Spain, consumption of horse meat is minor, compared to that of pork, beef, or lamb.

On 1 December 2022, an operation by Europol and the Spanish Civil Guard announced the arrest of 41 individuals involved in a criminal enterprise illegally selling untraceable horse meat to the Spanish, Belgian and German markets. The criminal enterprise acquired horses from across Spain, generating illegal profits of EUR 1.5 million.

====Sweden====
Smoked, cured horse meat is widely available as a cold cut under the name (literally hamburger meat). It tends to be very thinly sliced and fairly salty, slightly reminiscent of deli-style ham, and as a packaged meat, may list horse meat (as ) as its primary ingredient. Several varieties of smoked sausage made from horse meat, including , are also quite popular, especially in the province of Dalarna, where they are produced. , similar to salami or &quot;metworst&quot;, may substitute for those meats in sandwiches.

====Switzerland====
Horse meat is widely available and consumed in Switzerland, where no taboo exists regarding it. The laws on foodstuffs of animal origin in Switzerland explicitly list equines as an animal type allowed for the production of food.
 Horse steak is widely offered in restaurants. A marinated, smoked deli meat specialty known as &quot;Mostbröckli&quot; is made here with beef or horse meat. Horse meat is also used for a range of sausages in the German-speaking north of Switzerland. As in northern Italy, in Switzerland&#x27;s Italian-speaking south, local (sausages) may be made with horse meat. Horse may also be used in &quot;fondue Bourguignonne&quot;.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, the slaughter, preparation, and consumption of horses for food is not against the law, although it has been rare since the 1930s, and horse meat is not generally available. A cultural taboo against consuming horse meat exists in the UK, although it was eaten when other meats were scarce, such as during times of war, as was whale meat, which similarly failed to achieve popularity. The sale of meat labelled as horse meat in UK supermarkets and butchers is minimal, and most actual horse meat consumed in the UK is imported from continental Europe, predominantly from the south of France, where it is more widely eaten.

Horse meat was featured in a segment of a 2007 episode of the Gordon Ramsay series &quot;The F Word&quot;. In the segment, Janet Street-Porter convinced locals to try horse meat, though not before facing controversy and being forced to move her stand to a privately owned location. The meat was presented as having a similar taste to beef, but with less fat, a high concentration of omega-3 fatty acids, and as a safer alternative in times of worry regarding bird flu and mad cow disease. The segment was met with skepticism from many viewers after broadcast for various reasons, either because some felt the practice was cruel and against social norms, or simply a belief that if the taste was really on par with other meats, then people would already be eating it. A company called Cowley&#x27;s Fine Foods has also launched a horse jerky range called My Brittle Pony.

As for the accidental consumption:
* Horse meat may be eaten without the knowledge of the consumer, due to accidental or fraudulent introduction of horse meat into human food. A 2003 Food Standards Agency investigation revealed that certain sausages, salami, and similar products such as chorizo and pastrami sometimes contained horse meat without it being listed, although listing is legally required. 
* The 2013 horse meat scandal involved multiple products being recalled from shelves due to unlabelled horse meat in amounts up to 100% of the meat content.

===Asia-Pacific===

====Australia====
Australians do not generally eat horse meat, although they have a horse slaughter industry that exports to EU countries. In the Australian meat substitution scandal of 1981, it was revealed that both horse and kangaroo meat has been intentionally mislabeled as beef for export. Horse meat exports peaked at 9,327 tons in 1986, declining to 3,000 tons in 2003. They are at Peterborough in South Australia (SAMEX Peterborough Pty Ltd) and Caboolture Abattoir in Queensland (Meramist Pty Ltd). A British agriculture industry website reported that Australian horse meat production levels had risen to 24,000 tons by 2009.

=====Western Australia=====
On 30 June 2010, Western Australian Agriculture Minister Terry Redman granted final approval to Western Australian butcher Vince Garreffa to sell horse meat for human consumption. Vince Garreffa is the owner of &quot;Mondo Di Carne&quot;, a major wholesale meat supplier, which supplies many cafes, restaurants, and hotels in Western Australia. He commented that no domestic market exists for horse meat (all while a successful export market exists).

====China====
Outside of specific areas in China, such as Guilin in Guangxi or in Yunnan Province, horse meat is not popular due to its low availability and the belief that horse meat has a bad taste or that it is bad for health. The &quot;Compendium of Materia Medica&quot; written during the Ming dynasty by Li Shizhen says that horse meat is poisonous and may cause folliculitis or death. The compendium also asserts, &quot;to relieve toxins caused by eating horse meat, one can drink Phragmites root juice and eat apricot kernel.&quot; In southern China, local dishes include horse meat rice noodles (; Pinyin: ) in Guilin and horse meat hot pot (; Pinyin: ) in Huishui County in Guizhou Province.

====Indonesia====
In Indonesia, one type of satay (chunks of skewered grilled meat served with spicy sauce) known as horse satay (Javanese: , Indonesian: ) is made from horse meat. This dish from Yogyakarta is served with sliced fresh shallot, pepper, and sweet soy sauce. Horse is believed to be a source of strength and eating it is thought to increase a man&#x27;s vitality.

====Japan====

In Japanese cuisine, raw horse meat is called or because of its pink color. It can be served raw as &quot;sashimi&quot; in thin slices dipped in soy sauce, often with ginger, onions, garlic, and/or shiso leaves added. In this case, it is called . is popular in some regions of Japan and is often served at &quot;izakaya&quot; bars. Fat, typically from the neck, is also found as , though it is white, not pink. Horse meat is also sometimes found on menus for &quot;yakiniku&quot; (a type of barbecue), where it is called or ; thin slices of raw horse meat are sometimes served wrapped in a shiso leaf. Kumamoto, Nagano, and Ōita are famous for , and it is common in the Tōhoku region, as well. Some types of canned corned meat in Japan include horse as one of the ingredients.

Aside from raising local draft horses for meat, Japan imports living horses (from Canada and France) and meat from several countries — the five largest horse meat exporters to Japan are Canada, Mexico, Italy, Argentina, and Brazil.

====Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan====

In Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, horse meat is a large part of the diet, due mainly to the nomadic roots of the population.

Some of the dishes include:
* sausages called &quot;qazı&quot; (kazy) and &quot;chuchuk&quot; or made from the meat using the guts as the sausage skin,
* made from hip meat, which is smoked and boiled, 
* &quot;jal&quot; (or &quot;zhal&quot;) made from neck fat which is smoked and boiled, 
* made from a section of the rectum that is smoked and boiled, 
* and which is kept as dried meat.

 () is salted horsemeat that smoked over elm, juniper or meadowsweet.

====Mongolia====
Mongolian cuisine includes salted horse meat sausages called that are produced as a regional delicacy by the Kazakhs. Generally, Mongols prefer beef and mutton (though during the extremely cold Mongolian winter, some people prefer horse meat due to its low cholesterol). It is kept unfrozen, and traditionally people believe horse meat helps warm them up.

Other Asian nations import processed horse meat from Mongolia.

====Philippines====

In the Philippines, horse meat (, , or ) is a delicacy commonly sold in wet markets. It is prepared by marinating the meat in lemon juice, soy sauce or fish sauce, then fried and served with vinegar for dipping.

====South Korea====

In South Korea, horse meat is generally not eaten, but raw horse meat, mostly taken from the neck, is consumed as a delicacy on Jeju Island.

====Tonga====
In Tonga, horse meat is eaten nationwide. The dish is also popular among Tongan diaspora.

<text>Johanna Bormann (misspelled: Juana Bormann); 10 September 1893 – 13 December 1945) was a German prison guard at several Nazi concentration camps from 1938. She was executed as a war criminal at Hamelin after a court trial in 1945.

== Early life ==
Bormann was born on 10 September 1893 in Birkenfelde, East Prussia (now Germany). Not much in known about her early life, but she was raised in the Catholic faith.

==Career, trial and execution==
At her trial, Bormann said she had joined the Auxiliary SS, on 1 March 1938, as a civilian employee &quot;to earn more money&quot;. She first served at the Lichtenburg concentration camp in Saxony under SS &quot;Oberaufseherin&quot; Jane Bernigau with 49 other SS women. She worked in the camp kitchens.

In 1939, she was assigned to oversee a work crew at the new Ravensbrück women&#x27;s camp near Berlin. In March 1942, Bormann was one of a handful of women selected for guard duty at Auschwitz in occupied Poland. Short in stature, she was known for her cruelty. Victims called her &quot;Wiesel&quot; (weasel) and &quot;the woman with the dogs&quot;.

In October 1942, Bormann went to Auschwitz-Birkenau as an &quot;Aufseherin&quot;. Her supervisors included Maria Mandel, Margot Dreschel, and Irma Grese. Bormann was eventually moved to Budy, a nearby subcamp where she continued her abuse of prisoners.

In 1944, as German losses mounted, Bormann was transferred to the auxiliary camp at Hindenburg (present-day Zabrze, Poland) in Silesia. In January 1945, she returned to Ravensbrück. In March, she arrived at her last post, Bergen-Belsen, near Celle, where she served under Josef Kramer, Irma Grese and Elisabeth Volkenrath (all of whom had served with her in Birkenau). On 15 April 1945, the British Army took Bergen-Belsen, finding over 10,000 corpses and 60,000 survivors. The liberators forced all SS personnel to carry the dead.

Bormann was later incarcerated and interrogated by the British, then prosecuted at the Belsen Trial, which lasted from 17 September 1945 to 17 November 1945. The court heard testimony relating to murders she had committed at Auschwitz and Belsen, sometimes unleashing her &quot;big bad wolfhound&quot; German shepherd on helpless prisoners. She denied all of the charges, only admitting to slapping prisoners with her hands to discipline them.

She was found guilty, and hanged (along with Grese and Volkenrath) on 13 December 1945. Her executioner, Albert Pierrepoint, later wrote:&quot;She limped down the corridor looking old and haggard. She was 42 years old standing only a little over five feet. She was trembling as she was put on the scale. In German she said: &#x27;I have my feelings&#x27;.&quot;

<text>&quot;Sally&quot; is a science fiction short story by Isaac Asimov. It was first published in the May–June 1953 issue of &quot;Fantastic&quot; and later appeared in the Asimov collections &quot;Nightfall and Other Stories&quot; (1969) and &quot;The Complete Robot&quot; (1982).

==Plot summary==
In 2057, the only cars allowed on the road are those that contain positronic brains; these are autonomous cars and do not require a human driver. Fifty-one old cars have been retired to a farm run by Jake, where they can be properly cared for. All have names, but only three are identified by Jake. Sally is a vain convertible, possibly a Corvette (the only convertible US-made sports car at the time the story was written), and one sedan, Giuseppe, is identified as coming from the Milan factories, where Alfa Romeo was headquartered. The oldest car on the farm is from 2015, a Mat-o-Mot that goes by the name of Matthew, which Jake had once chauffeured. The cars in the farm communicate by slamming doors and honking their horns, and by misfiring, causing audible engine knocking.

Raymond Gellhorn, an unscrupulous businessman, tries to steal some of the cars in order to &#x27;recycle&#x27; the brains. He forces Jake at gunpoint to board a bus he has poorly connected to control the vehicle, trying to leave the farm with Jake as a hostage. (Jake describes the bus as suffering the positronic brain equivalent of perpetual migraines.) The cars chase and eventually surround the bus, communicating with it until it opens a door. Jake falls out, and the bus drives off with Gellhorn. Sally takes Jake back to the farm; Gellhorn is found dead in a ditch the next morning, exhausted and run over. The bus is found by the police and is identified by its tire tracks.

The story ends with Jake losing trust in his cars, thinking what the world will become if cars realize that they are effectively enslaved by humans, and revolt.

==Notes==
Asimov said, &quot;Anyone reading &#x27;Sally&#x27; can sense that I feel strongly attracted to the heroine of the story and that this probably reflects something of my own life ... The sexual symbolism is blatant&quot;.

In contrast to most of Asimov&#x27;s Robot stories, &#x27;Sally&#x27; does not refer to or describe the Three Laws of Robotics, and may not be set in the same continuity.

<doc id="933537" wikidata="Q220744" url="?curid=933537" title="Pearl (Janis Joplin album)">
<text>Pearl is the second and final solo studio album (and fourth album overall) by American singer Janis Joplin, released on January 11, 1971, by Columbia Records. The album was released three months after Joplin&#x27;s death on October 4, 1970. It was the final album with Joplin&#x27;s direct participation, and her only album recorded with the Full Tilt Boogie Band, her final touring unit. It peaked at No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, holding that spot for nine weeks.

&quot;Pearl&quot; has been certified quadruple platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It was ranked number 259 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s 2020 list of the &quot;500 Greatest Albums of All Time&quot;.

==Content==
The album has a more polished sound than those Joplin recorded with Big Brother and the Holding Company and the Kozmic Blues Band, due to the expertise of producer Paul A. Rothchild and new backing musicians. Rothchild was best-known as the recording studio producer of The Doors and worked well with Joplin, calling her a &quot;producer&#x27;s dream&quot;. Together they were able to craft an album showcasing her extraordinary vocal talents; they used Sunset Sound Recorders in Los Angeles.

The Full Tilt Boogie Band were the musicians who accompanied her on the Festival Express, a concert tour of Canada by train, in the summer of 1970. Many of the songs on this album were recorded on the concert stage in Canada two months before Joplin and the band started their LA recording sessions. The band also appeared twice on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot; and played many American cities before and after Festival Express, though no recordings of those concerts were officially released.

All nine tracks Joplin sings on were personally approved and arranged by Joplin. &quot;Pearl&quot; features the #1 hit &quot;Me and Bobby McGee&quot;, written by Kris Kristofferson and Fred Foster (Joplin played acoustic guitar on this track); &quot;Trust Me&quot;, by Bobby Womack, written for Joplin; Howard Tate&#x27;s &quot;Get It While You Can&quot;, showcasing her vocal range; and the original songs &quot;Move Over&quot; and &quot;Mercedes Benz&quot;, the latter co-written by Joplin, Bobby Neuwirth, and Michael McClure.

Joplin sang on all tracks except &quot;Buried Alive in the Blues&quot;, which was a backing track on which she had not yet recorded vocals. The song&#x27;s writer Nick Gravenites was offered the chance to sing it as a tribute to Joplin but turned it down, so the song ended up as an instrumental. He later sang it with Joplin’s former band Big Brother and the Holding Company for their 1971 album &quot;How Hard It Is&quot;. The recording sessions, starting in early September, ended with Joplin&#x27;s untimely death in 1970. Her final session, which took place Thursday, October 1 after a break of several days, yielded her a cappella &quot;Mercedes Benz.&quot; It was the last song she recorded before her death.
The album cover, photographed by Barry Feinstein in Los Angeles, shows Joplin reclining on her Victorian era loveseat with a drink in her hand.

==Release and reception==

In 2003, the album was ranked number 122 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, moving to 125 in a 2012 revised listing. It was moved to a 259 ranking in the 2020 list. In 2010, the album was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame.

===Reissues===
In 1993 Columbia reissued the album on 24kt gold CD as part of their MasterSound series, this edition was remastered by Vic Anesini using the Super Bit Mapping process. In 1999 it was remastered again for the &quot;Box Of Pearls&quot; box set, this version was also mastered by Vic Anesini, it included four previously unreleased live recordings from the Festival Express Tour, recorded on July 4, 1970, as bonus tracks; it was also released as a standalone release. A two-disc Legacy Edition was released on June 14, 2005, with six bonus tracks including a birthday message to John Lennon of &quot;&quot;Happy Trails&quot;,&quot; and a reunion of the Full Tilt Boogie Band in an instrumental tribute to Joplin. The second disc included an expanded set from the Festival Express Tour, recorded between June 28 and July 4, 1970. The album was again reissued again in 2012 as &quot;The Pearl Sessions&quot;. It contains the original album, six mono mixes, two live tracks and alternate takes of the songs that constituted the Pearl vinyl album when Columbia Records released it in 1971. Recordings of Joplin and Paul Rothchild talking between takes give the listener insight into their creative musical process. In 2016 Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released the album on SACD and double 45 RPM vinyl, the SACD was mastered by Rob LoVerde while the vinyl was cut by Kreig Wunderlich assisted by LoVerde.

<text>Antoine Idji Kolawolé (born 1946) is a Beninese politician. He was the minister of foreign affairs of Benin from 1998 to 2003 and the President of the National Assembly from 2003 to 2007.

==Political career==
Kolawolé was born in 1946 in Illikimou, near Kétou, Benin. Under President Mathieu Kérékou, Kolawolé served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from May 1998 to May 2003, when he resigned. In the March 2003 parliamentary election, his party, the African Movement for Development and Progress (MADEP), participated in the Presidential Movement, which supported Kérékou, and Kolawolé was elected as President of the National Assembly on April 25, 2003.

Kolawolé served as First Vice-President of MADEP, and in September 2005 he was designated as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate for the March 2006 presidential election. In the election, he took fifth place with 3.25% of the vote in the first round.

He was re-elected to the National Assembly in the March 2007 parliamentary election as part of the Alliance for a Dynamic Democracy. Mathurin Nago was elected by the National Assembly to succeed Kolawolé as its President on May 3, 2007.

In the April 2015 parliamentary election, he was re-elected to the National Assembly as a candidate of the Union Makes the Nation coalition in the 21st constituency.

<doc id="933541" wikidata="Q3055409" url="?curid=933541" title="Karoubi envelope">
<text>In mathematics the Karoubi envelope (or Cauchy completion or idempotent completion) of a category C is a classification of the idempotents of C, by means of an auxiliary category. Taking the Karoubi envelope of a preadditive category gives a pseudo-abelian category, hence the construction is sometimes called the pseudo-abelian completion. It is named for the French mathematician Max Karoubi.

Given a category C, an idempotent of C is an endomorphism 

:formula_1

with 

:formula_2.

An idempotent &quot;e&quot;: &quot;A&quot; → &quot;A&quot; is said to split if there is an object &quot;B&quot; and morphisms &quot;f&quot;: &quot;A&quot; → &quot;B&quot;,
&quot;g&quot; : &quot;B&quot; → &quot;A&quot; such that &quot;e&quot; = &quot;g&quot; &quot;f&quot; and 1&quot;B&quot; = &quot;f&quot; &quot;g&quot;.

The Karoubi envelope of C, sometimes written Split(C), is the category whose objects are pairs of the form (&quot;A&quot;, &quot;e&quot;) where &quot;A&quot; is an object of C and formula_3 is an idempotent of C, and whose morphisms are the triples

: formula_4

where formula_5 is a morphism of C satisfying formula_6 (or equivalently formula_7).

Composition in Split(C) is as in C, but the identity morphism 
on formula_8 in Split(C) is formula_9, rather than
the identity on formula_10.

The category C embeds fully and faithfully in Split(C). In Split(C) every idempotent splits, and Split(C) is the universal category with this property.
The Karoubi envelope of a category C can therefore be considered as the &quot;completion&quot; of C which splits idempotents.

The Karoubi envelope of a category C can equivalently be defined as the full subcategory of formula_11 (the presheaves over C) of retracts of representable functors. The category of presheaves on C is equivalent to the category of presheaves on Split(C).

== Automorphisms in the Karoubi envelope ==

An automorphism in Split(C) is of the form formula_12, with inverse formula_13 satisfying:

: formula_14
: formula_15
: formula_16

If the first equation is relaxed to just have formula_17, then &quot;f&quot; is a partial automorphism (with inverse &quot;g&quot;). A (partial) involution in Split(C) is a self-inverse (partial) automorphism.

==Examples==

* If C has products, then given an isomorphism formula_18 the mapping formula_19, composed with the canonical map formula_20 of symmetry, is a partial involution.
* If C is a triangulated category, the Karoubi envelope Split(C) can be endowed with the structure of a triangulated category such that the canonical functor C → Split(C) becomes a triangulated functor.
*The Karoubi envelope is used in the construction of several categories of motives.
*The Karoubi envelope construction takes semi-adjunctions to adjunctions. For this reason the Karoubi envelope is used in the study of models of the untyped lambda calculus. The Karoubi envelope of an extensional lambda model (a monoid, considered as a category) is cartesian closed.
* The category of projective modules over any ring is the Karoubi envelope of its full subcategory of free modules.
* The category of vector bundles over any paracompact space is the Karoubi envelope of its full subcategory of trivial bundles. This is in fact a special case of the previous example by the Serre–Swan theorem and conversely this theorem can be proved by first proving both these facts, the observation that the global sections functor is an equivalence between trivial vector bundles over formula_21 and free modules over formula_22 and then using the universal property of the Karoubi envelope.

<text>Cyril &quot;Speed&quot; Saunders is a DC Comics character, first appearing in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; as the first featured character in the anthology series around the Golden Age of Comic Books created by E.C. Stoner. He is depicted as an adventurer and detective during the 1930s and 1940s. He would then later be revived in a supporting character role as the retconned grandfather of the current Kendra Saunders, and first cousin to the original Hawkgirl, Shiera Sanders Hall.

==Publication history==
Speed Saunders is the first featured character in the longest running series anthology American comic book series of DC Comics named &quot;Detective Comics&quot; in the first issue of the series starting in March 1937. He was regularly featured in the anthology series for about 50 issues. In 1999 James Robinson and David S. Goyer used the character in &quot;JSA Secret Files&quot; #1.

==Fictional character biography==
Cyril started as a G-Man, working in the FBI&#x27;s River Patrol Division. In addition to being a G-Man, he also seemed to be both an adventurer and detective depending on the needs of the story. He investigated murder cases, and also once fought with a mad scientist who&#x27;d transplanted a human brain into an ape.

Eventually, it was revealed that he was a private investigator and later a member of the OSS. During that time he meets Wesley Dodds and the two become lifelong friends (&quot;JSA Secret Files&quot; #1 1999).

In 1938 Saunders became involved in the Office of Strategic Services (OSS), participating in counterespionage operations throughout World War II(&quot;JSA Secret Files&quot; #1 1999).

In the modern era, Cyril finds his orphaned granddaughter, Kendra Saunders; he takes her in and begins training her in hand-to-hand combat and other skills. He knows that she has a great destiny as the next Hawkgirl.

Cyril joined his friend Wesley Dodds on a trip to China, Tibet, and the Himalayas. It is on Mt. Kailash that the two meet with the Gray Man. The two men receive the location of three babies, one of which is to receive the essence of Dr. Fate and so become the newest incarnation of that hero. Saunders leaves Wesley on that Mount to take the information to Alan Scott and the JSA, as well as to Sanderson Hawkins (&quot;JSA Secret Files&quot; #1 1999).

Once in China proper, Cyril also contacts his granddaughter Kendra and gives her information on one of the babies. He tells her to go to Vancouver, British Columbia and to protect that baby (&quot;JSA&quot; #2 1999).

<text>Cheryl Lynn Holdridge (&quot;née&quot; Phelps; June 20, 1944 – January 6, 2009) was an American actress, best known as an original cast member of &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;.

==Early life==
Holdridge&#x27;s mother, Julie, married Herbert Charles Holdridge, a retired Brigadier General. He adopted Cheryl in 1953 and gave her his surname. Her stepbrother was diplomat John H. Holdridge, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Singapore and Indonesia.

==Career==
Holdridge first performed professionally at the age of nine in the New York City Ballet&#x27;s version of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot; in Los Angeles. Her first screen appearance was as an uncredited extra in the 1956 film production of &quot;Carousel&quot;. 

She auditioned for Walt Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot; in the spring of 1956, and was hired for the show&#x27;s second season. 

After the show&#x27;s run ended, Holdridge returned to Van Nuys High School and graduated from Grant High School with the winter 1961 class. She was cast in two episodes of &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; in 1959 as Gloria Cusick; she later played an occasional, recurring role as Wally Cleaver&#x27;s girlfriend, Julie Foster. She reprised her role as Julie Foster in two guest appearances in &quot;The New Leave It to Beaver&quot; in 1985 and 1987.

From 1960, Holdridge made guest appearances on over twenty different shows, including &quot;The Rifleman&quot;, &quot;Wagon Train&quot;, &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;, &quot;Bachelor Father&quot;, &quot;My Three Sons&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot;, &quot;Bewitched&quot;, and &quot;The Dick Van Dyke Show&quot;.

Holdridge was offered the role of Elly May on &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; but her studio would not release her from her contract to accept the role, and lost the lead role in &quot;Gidget Goes to Rome&quot; to Cindy Carol for looking too mature. Holdridge was also screen tested for a role in &quot;Spencer&#x27;s Mountain&quot; that would eventually go to Mimsy Farmer.

Holdridge retired from acting in 1964 to marry race car driver Lance Reventlow, to whom she was wed until his death in 1972. Holdridge was offered a movie contract from Universal Studios but declined after Reventlow proposed. She stated “I had to choose between my career and my personal life. Lance doesn&#x27;t want me to quit acting, but it wouldn&#x27;t be right for me to be tied to a studio.&quot; In 1967 Holdridge was reported to be planning on writing a book about Barbara Hutton and Reventlow. She watched an installment of &quot;Poor Little Rich Girl&quot;, based on Hutton, with its producer Lester Persky at his Bel Air home. The book never materialized.

After the death of her third husband, Holdridge made a cameo appearance in the 2000 feature film, &quot;The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas&quot;. In 2005, she appeared at Disneyland for 50th anniversary celebrations of both the opening of the park and &quot;The Mickey Mouse Club&quot;. She was cast in televised documentary specials about Cary Grant (2005) and Barbara Hutton (2006), and also appeared in a special feature interview for a Disney DVD.

==Personal life==
In May 1960, Holdridge went on a live tour to Australia with other former Mouseketeers. While there, she became involved with Lucky Starr, an Australian singer. They met when Starr was 19 and Holdridge was still 15 years old. Starr was quoted as saying he fell in love with her and when the relationship ended, the two remained friends and would write to each other regularly.

Prior to her first marriage, Holdridge had dated Elvis Presley, Tony Dow, Ricky Nelson, Tim Considine, Fabian Forte, Bobby Rydell, Don Grady, Tommy Kirk, and Michael Anderson Jr.

Holdridge&#x27;s first marriage, on November 8, 1964, was to sportsman and playboy Lance Reventlow, only child of Barbara Hutton, heir to the Woolworth fortune. Holdridge decided to retire from acting after becoming engaged to Reventlow and would later explain “because that’s what you did then. You married and stayed home.” It was reported that towards the end of their marriage the couple were estranged and met only occasionally, with Holdridge contemplating divorce. At an event in 1971, Holdridge refused to be addressed as Mrs. Lance Reventlow and stated &quot;Lance and I are the best of friends. We just don&#x27;t live together.&quot; Reventlow died in 1972, in the crash of a small plane in which he was a passenger in Aspen, Colorado. The bulk of Reventlow&#x27;s estate went to Holdridge, which was estimated around $50 million.

Between her first two marriages it was reported Holdridge dated film producers Robert Cohn (son of Jack Cohn) and Andrew Wald (son of Jerry Wald), and author Michael Crichton.
Her second husband was Albert James &quot;Jim&quot; Skarda, whom she married in 1974. He ran a car rental service in Aspen. Skarda was indicted for being the ringleader in an international drug smuggling operation. According to a sealed indictment, Skarda put up $100,000 in 1983 to begin importing thousands of pounds of marijuana from Colombia to the United States. Holdridge pledged their Aspen home to pay for his $500,000 bond. They divorced in 1988. She maintained a second home in Aspen and lived there for six months out of the year from the late 1960s to the mid-1990s.

Her third husband, Manning J. Post (1918–2000), a prominent California Democratic Party fundraiser and controller, was 26 years her senior. Post had a used car business before becoming a TV and film producer. Post was then treasurer for the California presidential campaigns of John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson and headed the inaugural campaign committee for Jimmy Carter. Post would then go on to be a fundraiser for the political campaigns of Jesse Unruh and Joel Wachs. He died at the age of 82.

==Death==
Holdridge died at her Santa Monica home on January 6, 2009, from lung cancer, aged 64.

<text>The Organización Nacional del Yunque (English: National Organization of the Anvil) or simply El Yunque (in English: The Anvil) is the name of an alleged conservative Mexican secret society whose existence was first claimed by journalist Alvaro Delgado in 2003. 

==Organization==
Delgado described The Anvil as &quot;ultracatholic, anticommunist, antisemitic, antiliberal and with fascistic traits&quot;. He also claims that top members of PAN and former President Vicente Fox&#x27;s cabinet are also members of El Yunque. The organization was allegedly formed in Puebla in the early 1950s.

Since it is allegedly a secret organization, most reports about it come from its critics and alleged ex-members. One notable purported ex-member is the former mayor of Puebla, Luis Paredes Moctezuma, who has led demonstrations against the organization, demanding the expulsion of all heads of PAN who are also affiliated to El Yunque. Paredes Moctezuma has also explicitly pointed current party leader Manuel Espino Barrientos as a yunquista. He has said that El Yunque played a role backing Vicente Fox&#x27;s campaign in 2000.

In 2007, Paredes claimed the group controlled four state governments in Mexico and that it established cells in the United States in the early 1990s, saying, &quot;They&#x27;re in Dallas, in Boston, in Washington, D.C., in Los Angeles, in Miami.&quot; A poor quality video of what appeared to be a Yunque initiation ceremony featuring unidentified men and Yunque symbolism appeared on YouTube in which one man explains that the goal of the organization is to conquer Mexico and Latin America, but the video may have been staged.

Paredes claimed The Anvil was formed in the early 1950s as a reaction to anti-Catholic sentiment under the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). He says it attracted religious students who sought to counter the leftist influence reflected in the Cuban revolution, communist China and the Soviet Union. He says the group opposed the presidential candidacy of centrist Felipe Calderón, and was thus in a poor position to influence him.

According to its critics, the secret organization of El Yunque was supposedly paramilitary in nature, performing its actions (including political assassination mostly through a set of front organizations) and, according to the magazine &quot;Contralínea&quot;, this included the student organization MURO at the National Autonomous University of Mexico in the 1960s.

Named members in the 2000s included: state governor Juan Manuel Oliva; Gerardo Mosqueda, his chief of staff; and local politician Alberto Diosdado. Representatives of all three men denied involvement.

==Skepticism==
Members of PAN have condemned Delgado&#x27;s claims as &quot;pure fiction&quot;, comparing it to the mythical monster, the chupacabra, and saying that El Yunque has nothing to do with the party. Delgado has been accused of inventing the organization in order to sway the 2006 Mexican elections. A former PAN presidential candidate and party head, Luis H. Alvarez, said that he believed the organization was real but negligible. One political commentator dismissed claims about the group as an easy way to smear political opponents, &quot;I have never found anyone who admits to being a member of El Yunque. All I see are attacks from the left. It&#x27;s an easy way to dismiss someone.&quot;

== El Yunque in Spain ==

In 2012, Delgado reported that El Yunque had spread to Spain, influencing the conservative People&#x27;s Party. He would later report a connection between El Yunque and the far-right political party Vox. In early 2012, the newspaper &quot;El Confidencial&quot; suggested that the Organización del Bien Común (English: &quot;Organisation for the Common Good&quot;) was a front for a Spanish offshoot of the organisation. Those implicated in the allegations started legal actions against publications reporting on the alleged group. The first was by Profesionales por la Ética against digital newspaper &quot;Forum Libertas&quot; and its editor Josep Miró i Ardèvol, which was dismissed later that year. The second, by conservative organisation Hazte Oir against &quot;El Confidencial&quot;, was also dismissed in 2012.

The third was brought by Hazte Oir, on behalf of the Spanish Episcopal Conference, against Fernando López Luengos, a clergyman who edited the clerical newspaper &quot;El Transparente de la Catedral de Toledo&quot;. In May 2014, a Madrilenian judge declared there was possibly evidence to show a relationship between members of the association HazteOir (HO) and El Yunque&quot;.&quot; However, she could not say with certainty that such an organization exists. It has also been linked to CitizenGO, a foundation created by HazteOir. (HO was later subsumed under CitizenGO.) In 2021, the foundation of conservative TV news channel 7NN was linked to El Yunque via the Francisco Franco National Foundation and Vox.

Some bishops have commented on the potential offshoot of El Yunque in Spain. Cardinal Antonio Cañizares Llovera said in 2011 that he had assumed El Yunque were working behind the scenes, saying &quot;They&#x27;re no longer called El Yunque, but they&#x27;re now the Asociación por el Bien Común.&quot; Meanwhile, Joaquín María López de Andújar y Cánovas del Castillo, the bishop of Getafe, in March 2015 said, after learning of the connection, that he would not support members, and implored them not to attend his diocese. His deputy, José Rico Pavés, said that &quot;El Yunque exists, and that is not good for the Church.&quot;

A 24 September 2016 article in &quot;El País&quot; linked El Yunque to the anti-vaxxer movement CitizenGo and HazteOir which are headquartered in Spain.

== El Yunque in Chile ==
It has also been alleged that El Yunque has had an influence in Chile since 2006, when Salvador Salazar, a politician from the PAN, founded the &quot;Muévete Chile&quot; movement. At the end of 2016, an investigation unveiled the society&#x27;s influence there, singling out José Antonio Rosas, the leader of the &quot;Academia de Líderes Católicos&quot;, as one of its figureheads. Rosas admitted to having been a member of the group until 2014, however denied that El Yunque had ever infiltrated the &quot;Academia&quot;.

<text>The Om (, ) is a river in the south of the Western Siberian plains in Russia. It is a right tributary of the Irtysh. It is long, and has a drainage basin of . 

The name is probably from the word &quot;om&quot; &quot;quiet&quot; in the language of the Baraba Tatars.

==Course==
The Om rises in the Vasyugan Swamp at the border of Novosibirsk and Tomsk oblasts. It flows mainly across the Baraba Lowland of the West Siberian Plain. The city of Omsk is situated at the confluence of Om and Irtysh, and Ust-Tarka at the confluence of the Om and the Tarka rivers. The main tributaries are the Icha, Kama and Tartas.

<text>Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi (; 5 January 1933 – 19 February 2019) was a Congolese politician who served in the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1999 to 2000 and as Vice-President from 2003 to December 2006.

== Political career ==
As a supporter of President Laurent-Désiré Kabila, he was appointed Director of the Cabinet of the President on 22 December 1997, taking office on 2 January 1998. Subsequently, he was Minister of Foreign Affairs from March 15, 1999, until late 2000. In 2003 he became one of the four vice-presidents of Congo under the transitional government as mandated by a peace settlement with rebel groups and opposition parties. He was nominated to the post in April 2003 by President Joseph Kabila, as the vice-president representing the Kabila government. He served until 2006. In subsequent years he served as a Senator.

Yerodia died in Kinshasa on February 19, 2019, aged 86.

==The Arrest Warrant Case (Congo vs. Belgium)==

Yerodia was involved in a precedent-setting case by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). In 1998, Yerodia publicly encouraged the Congolese population to kill members of a rebellion against the government, primarily ethnic Tutsis. In response, Belgium issued an international arrest warrant based on a new Belgian law (known as the Belgian Universal Jurisdiction Law, since repealed) allowing Belgian courts to prosecute international crimes, charging Yerodia with inciting genocide. The Congolese government responded by filing an application against Belgium to the ICJ, claiming that Belgium did not have jurisdiction and that Yerodia enjoyed diplomatic immunity as foreign minister. This case, known as the Warrant Case, was decided in Congo&#x27;s favor. During the proceedings of the case, the Congo dropped its jurisdiction arguments and the case was decided solely on Yerodia&#x27;s diplomatic immunity as foreign minister. However, some human rights groups saw this decision as a blow to universal jurisdiction.

<doc id="933584" wikidata="Q98637505" url="?curid=933584" title="Wójt">
<text>A wójt is the highest administrative officer of a Polish &quot;rural gmina&quot;, i.e., of a commune (&quot;gmina&quot;) comprising only villages. (The head of a town or city is called, respectively, the &quot;burmistrz&quot; or &quot;president&quot;.)

==History and etymology==

The word &quot;wójt&quot; derives from the Latin &quot;advocatus&quot;, via the German &#x27;Vogt&#x27;.

In medieval Poland, a wójt (&quot;advocatus&quot; in documents written in Latin) was a hereditary (later elected) head of a town (under the overlordship of the town&#x27;s owner – the king, church, or noble) or other area of settlement, which was established on or transferred to the Magdeburg rights, as well as the head of the local court (in Latin &quot;capitaneus&quot;). It this respect, a wójt was the head of the territory called &quot;&quot; (Polish: &quot;wójtostwo&quot;; Lithuanian: &quot;vajtija&quot;, &quot;vaitystė&quot;; Latin: &quot;advocatia&quot;). In private towns, wójts were appointed by the owner or were elected by the community.

From this title derive surnames such as Wójtowicz/Voytovych, Starovoyt, Starovoytov, Voytenko, Voitiuk, and Voytov. (These are not to be confused with surnames derived from &quot;Wojtek&quot;, which is a diminutive of &quot;Wojciech&quot;).

==Wójt in modern times==
In modern Poland the elected position of wójt of a (in an the equivalent positions are &quot;burmistrz&quot; and ) is an element of the local government of the lowest level, and it is defined by the Polish law about gmina self-government.

The position of wójt is not the same as the position of the chairman of the gmina council (&quot;przewodniczący rady gminy&quot;). Wójt is the executive function of gmina (the title for the executive position is &quot;burmistrz&quot; if the administration is located in a gmina town and &quot;town president&quot; in towns with population over 100,000) (Article 26). These positions (and of their deputies) can be held only by Polish citizens and cannot be shared with the same position in another gmina or with a number of other administrative positions.

===Relations of wójt and gmina council===

The gmina council (&quot;rada gminy&quot;) controls the activities of wójt, determines the remuneration of wójt, directions of his activities, accepts his report on his activities, handles complaints about wójt, and may consider termination of wójt&#x27;s tenure. A wójt suggests the candidate for the position of gmina treasurer, for rada to accept.

Wójt performs major actions (major purchases, credits, handling rada bonds, etc.) related to the community property according to the principles set by rada.

Wójt has rights to call for a session of rada.

Wójt or his representative has an obligation to reasonably promptly address questions and requests formally submitted by rada members.

Wójt cannot assign any contractual work to a rada member of his gmina.

===Anti-corruption regulation===
Neither wójt nor wójt&#x27;s deputies nor persons cohabiting with wójt or wójt&#x27;s deputies (the same as for other rada administration) can be part of management or own over 10% of shares of commercial businesses based in the gmina and have to submit declarations of their property. These declarations are public, with the exception of some specifics (addresses, etc.) They cannot accept any property gifts (including acquiring undervalued property) for 3 years after the termination of their functions.

===Activities===

Major categories of wójt&#x27;s activities include:
* preparing draft resolutions of the gmina council and of development programs
* suggesting the ways of implementation of council resolutions
* management of gmina property and budget
* hiring and dismissing heads of gmina organizational units

Wójt manages running affairs of the gmina and represents the gmina on the outside and performs these duties with the help of the gmina office (urząd gminy), which wójt heads. In these affairs wójt reports exclusively to the gmina council.

Wójt has to inform the residents of gmina on draft budget and its uses and social and economic policies of gmina (Article 61).

<text>Kyle Bay is a suburb in southern Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Kyle Bay is 19 kilometres south of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the Georges River Council and is part of the St George area. 

Kyle Bay takes its name from the bay that sits on the northern shore of the Georges River. It is a tiny, affluent, picturesque suburb around this bay and Harness Cask Point. Kyle Bay is surrounded by the suburbs of Blakehurst, South Hurstville and Connells Point. Kangaroo Point sits on the opposite bank of the Georges River. It is 7 km west of Botany Bay and 12 km north-west of the Cronulla surfing beaches. This leafy suburb is graced with scenic riverside parks and reserves including Merriman Reserve and Donnelly Reserve. Kyle Bay and Harness Cask Point are natural formations.

== History ==
Kyle Bay was named after local shipbuilder Robert Kyle (or Coile). The land around Kyle Bay was originally granted by the Crown to Robert Kyle and James Merriman on 9 November 1853. Kyle Parade and Merriman Street are named in their honour. Legacy House is a historic estate on the eastern shore of Kyle Bay. It was bequest to children and first operated from 1948 to 1983 as a convalescent home for children. It was then taken over by Legacy as a home for the children of servicemen/women who have either lost their parents or whose parents were unable to care for them.

== Commercial area ==
A small group of shops is located on Kyle Parade, on the corner of Merriman Street.

==Population==
According to the , there were 1,039 people usually resident in Kyle Bay. 29.9% stated they were born overseas with the top countries of birth being China (excludes SARs and Taiwan) 8.3%, Greece 2.1%, and North Macedonia 1.4%. English was stated as the only language spoken at home by 58.5% of residents and the most common other languages spoken were Greek 9.3%, Cantonese 7.8%, and Mandarin 7.4%. The most common responses for religious affiliation were Catholic 24.8%, No Religion 23.2%, Orthodox 22.2% and Anglican 8.2%.

<text>Peter Mackenzie Millman (August 10, 1906 – December 11, 1990) was a Canadian astronomer. He worked at the Dunlap Observatory from 1933 until 1940. In early 1941 he enlisted with the Royal Canadian Air Force. In 1946 he joined the Dominion Observatory in Ottawa. He then transferred to the National Research Council in 1955.

During his graduate studies at Harvard University he started a systematic study of meteor spectra at the suggestion of Harlow Shapley in 1929. He continued the work on meteors throughout his active scientific life. He organized one of his most successful observational campaigns in 1946, when on the night of October 9/10 a spectacular shower of the Giacobinids (October Draconids) provided many important photographic spectra.

He was awarded the J. Lawrence Smith Medal in 1954.

A crater on Mars and the minor planet 2904 Millman were named in his honor.

<text>Honda Type R models are special performance editions of their respective model families.

The design of Type R models was originally focused on race conditions, with an emphasis on minimizing weight, and maximizing performance potential (e.g. engine tuning, suspension set-up). Thus, Type R models were first conceived for racetracks. However, due to Honda&#x27;s increased focus on their VTEC engines, Type R vehicles were eventually designed for a much wider market.

Type R vehicles traditionally have a red Honda badge and Championship White paint as an option, as a tribute to their first winning F1 car. Honda&#x27;s racing and F1 cars often feature a red Honda badge.

The Type R was utilised by Acura on their high performance vehicles, which evolved into Type-S for selected models.

==NSX Type R==


Honda produced a very limited number of NSX Type R models from 1992 to 1995 for Japan. Major changes include a more aggressive suspension and an extensive weight reduction to from the normal NSX weight of . The NSX Type R was track oriented and, to reduce weight, lacked sound deadening, audio, electric windows and air conditioning. The NSX Type R&#x27;s role was fulfilled by the NSX Type S Zero in 1997.

A second iteration of the Type R, dubbed NSX-R, was released in 2002, again exclusively in Japan. The NSX-R had a more aggressive rear spoiler and hood vent, featured a roof scoop, along with various refinements to reduce weight to . Under the body, panels and air fences in the front, along with a small rear diffuser, produced balanced downforce. These subtle changes along with its renowned handling kept the NSX-R competitive on the track against considerably higher-powered cars.

==Integra Type R==

===DC2 Integra Type R (1995-2001)===


In 1995, Honda introduced their first Integra Type R to the Japanese Domestic Market (JDM).

The Integra Type R is equipped with a 1.8-liter DOHC VTEC in-line 4-cylinder (B18C) engine. In the JDM Type R this engine produces at 8,000 rpm, whereas in the US models it produces at 8,000 rpm and of torque at 5,700 rpm. JDM cars and cars sold in other international markets came with an 11:1 compression ratio whereas the USDM Integra Type R has a compression ratio of 10.6:1. There were numerous differences between the Type R engine and the DOHC VTEC engine available in other Integra models (GS-R) but the increased power was primarily due to the higher compression, larger throttle body, high-lift camshafts and high-volume exhaust manifold.
The Type R came only with a close-ratio 5-speed manual transmission. First gear and the final drive were identical to the GS-R transmission but gears two to four were spaced much closer. In addition, the Type R came equipped with a helical limited-slip differential. In 1998, the JDM Type R and other international markets would receive a revised final drive ratio of 4.785 while the USDM Type R was equipped with a 4.40 final drive ratio.

The focus of the Type R was to minimize weight while enhancing rigidity. The Type R has larger strut tower bars, rear performance rods on the rear frame and numerous body reinforcements. The Type R had revised springs and dampers as well as larger sway bars.

The 1995–1997 Type R has 4-lug 15 x 6-inch aluminum wheels wrapped in Bridgestone Potenza RE010 195/55R15 tires. Larger rotors and calipers were included and the ABS system was revised as well. The 1998 JDM Type R would receive 5-lug 16-inch alloy wheels wrapped in 215/45/ZR16 tires.

Other features such as a moonroof, vanity mirrors, cruise control and a rear wiper were eliminated to save weight. Air conditioning was an option. The interior was revised as well to include a 10,000 rpm tachometer with an 8,400 rpm redline along with revised sport cloth seats and a titanium shift knob.

===US Integra Type R===
The Type R was introduced as a 1997 model to the US market under the Acura brand with the only option being air conditioning. In the US, the car would only be available in Championship White in 1997 and 1998. The Type R was not available for 1999 but returned in 2000 and remained until the end of DC2 production in 2001. Two colors were available for 2000 and 2001: Phoenix Yellow (&#x27;00-&#x27;01) and Flamenco Black Pearl (&#x27;00) or Nighthawk Black Pearl (&#x27;01).

The 1997 Integra Type R made more than the Integra GS-R and was lighter. At the time, the Integra Type R set the record for the most power per liter ( per liter) of a naturally aspirated piston engine ever produced for the US. This record would later be broken by the Honda S2000 which made per liter.

Production would be limited to 320 units in 1997 and 1,000 units in 1998, while 1,350 units were built for the US in 2000 and 1,158 in 2001. A total of 3,823 Integra Type R were produced.

===DC2 Type R weight comparison===
The below table lists the curb weights of the Integra Type R by model year (lbs). 


The below table shows the weight gains/losses due to the differences in parts between the Integra Type R and the Integra VTi-R as listed by &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine in 1994. 
 

Using the actual &quot;Wheels&quot; test weight of 1176 kg for VTi-R -40 kg listed, AuDM Type R weight reduction yields approximately a 1136 kg (2504 lb) curb weight.

It has been acclaimed by motoring journalists world-wide, including &quot;Evo&quot; magazine, who named the Type R &quot;the greatest front-wheel-drive performance car ever&quot; and TheAutoChannel.com, who also named it &#x27;the best handling front-wheel drive car ever.&#x27;

===DC5 Integra Type R (2002-2006)===

The DC5 Type R (Japanese market only) comes standard with a K20A 2.0-litre DOHC i-VTEC four-cylinder engine. The &quot;i&quot; in i-VTEC stands for intelligent VTEC, which employs VTC (Variable Timing Control) to advance the timing up to 50 degrees. The DC5 comes equipped with Recaro seats, four-piston Brembo front brakes, a close-ratio six-speed manual transmission, a limited-slip differential, and a stiffer suspension.
==Accord Type R and Euro-R==
The Honda Accord Type R (ATR) was produced from 1998 to 2002 using the CH1 Accord chassis and sold in European markets. The JDM Accord Euro-R uses the CL1 chassis. Both models are powered by a naturally aspirated 2.2-litre four-cylinder DOHC H22A7 &quot;Red Top&quot; VTEC motor which produces in the JDM model and at 7,200 rpm and of torque at 6,700 rpm in the EDM model. The Type R Accord model is differentiated by features such as a stiffer suspension and chassis, helical limited-slip differential, twin-piston brakes, dual exhaust system, 17-inch alloy wheels, Xenon headlights, Recaro seats and a leather-trimmed Momo steering wheel. A Torneo Euro R was produced in 2002, being mechanically identical to the CL1, with different front and rear styling.

The successor to the CL1 Accord Euro-R is the CL7 Accord Euro-R, produced from December 2002 to 2008 and built in Sayama, Japan for the JDM market. It is powered by a K20AI-VTEC motor with at 8,000 rpm and of torque at 7,000 rpm. The engine run on 11.5:1 compression and has a redline of 8,300 rpm. It also has the standard Type R features, including Recaro seats, a limited-slip differential and independent double-wishbone suspension.

==Civic Type R==
The 1997 EK9 Civic was third to be given the Type R badge. Based on the EK4 SiR chassis, it features a Type R prepared B16B engine producing along with a stiffer chassis, upgraded sway bars and strut bars, Recaro seats trimmed in Alcantara, 15-inch alloy wheels and a large boot spoiler. Since then, most generations have offered a Type R variant. The first-generation Civic Type R was the only version not offered outside Japan.

July 2015 saw the launch of a new Honda Civic Type R, manufactured at their Swindon plant. The vehicle offers higher performance in the form of a direct-injected turbocharged 2.0 liter VTEC K20C1 petrol engine producing , and built in the United States at Honda&#x27;s Anna Engine Plant in Anna, Ohio. Redesigned in 2017 but using the same engine, the fifth-generation Civic Type R accelerates from 0- in 4.9 seconds and has a top speed of .

In May 2018, engineers at Honda&#x27;s Swindon, UK factory developed a one off Civic Type R, the car called project P is a pickup truck, the performance and drivetrain are the same as the production Type R.

<doc id="933602" wikidata="Q3107780" url="?curid=933602" title="Tangguh gas field">
<text>The Tangguh gas field is a gas field lies in Berau Gulf and Bintuni Bay, in the province of West Papua, Indonesia. The natural gas field contains over of proven natural gas reserves, with estimates of potential reserves reaching over .

The Tangguh field is operated by BP Berau Ltd. on behalf of other production sharing contract partners as contractor to SKK Migas. BP Berau Ltd and affiliates in Indonesia holds a 40.22% interest in the project. Other partners are MI Berau B.V. (16.30%), CNOOC Muturi Limited(13.90%), Nippon Oil Exploration (Berau), Limited (12.23%), KG Berau Petroleum Ltd and KG WiriagarPetroleum Ltd (10.00%), and Indonesia Natural Gas Resources Muturi Inc. (7.35%).

Production began in June 2009.

Natural gas extracted from the field will be liquefied and the resulting LNG transported to customers in Asia and Indonesia.

== Background ==
Indonesia is a prolific oil and gas country with discovered reserves of more than and . Most of the reserves originate from Tertiary source rocks and are trapped in Tertiary reservoirs on or immediately offshore of Java, Sumatra and Kalimantan.

Though these western areas have been the main focus of the country&#x27;s petroleum activities, explorers have searched for giant accumulations in eastern Indonesia for more than a century.

In Papua (formerly Irian Jaya), Trend Exploration discovered about of Miocene-sourced oil in Tertiary reefs in the Salawati Basin during the 1970s. Phillips, Conoco, Total and Occidental subsequently tried to emulate Trend&#x27;s success by exploring the adjacent Bintuni Basin, but found only about , shallow onshore oil field called Wiriagar in 1981 and some uneconomic offshore gas in the early 1990s.

Arco entered Irian Jaya in 1989 by farming into a Conoco-led partnership holding an onshore block called KBSA on the northern side of Berau Bay. Gene Richards, Arco Indonesia&#x27;s exploration vice president, executed the original farm-in as an opportunity to explore for large reserves in a frontier area where Pertamina had recently instituted improved fiscal terms.

Two dry holes were drilled in 1990, and Arco faced a decision -- to drop out of the Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and exit Irian Jaya, or to continue exploration in the Bintuni Basin.

== Looking deeper ==
The Tangguh LNG project in Eastern Indonesia began with the Wiriagar Deep-1 gas discovery, drilled by Arco’s New Venture team led by Suherman Tisnawidjaja as Arco Indonesia New Venture exploration manager. Suherman replaced Dick Garrard as a New Venture Manager in late 1991. Suherman’s main job in New Venture at that time was to evaluate and acquire new exploration blocks in Eastern Indonesia. 

The Wiriagar area was one of the first targets of the New Venture team for an in depth exploration evaluation. This area is located in the southeastern part of the KBSA (Kepala Burung Selatan Block “A”) block. Arco was one of the partner in the KBSA PSC operated by Conoco. Larry Casarta and Sonny Sampurno were the geologists in the New Venture team that evaluated the block.

The Wiriagar Pre-Tertiary play was initially proposed by Larry Casarta based on the structural interpretation of the Pre-Tertiary level below the existing Wiriagar oil field. At that time the Wiriagar oil field had been producing oil from the Middle Miocene Kais limestone. The evaluation of the Wiriagar area was integrated with the regional study of the KBSA and Berau-Bintuni Bay areas of Pre-Tertiary sediment, especially the Middle Jurassic Roabiba sandstone which previously done by Larry Casarta and Sonny Sampurno. One of the key results of the petroleum system analyses indicated that Wiriagar oil was generated from Pre-Tertiary source rock. The kitchen is in the deep basin area, southeastern part of the Bintuni basin.

In 1992 John Duncan replaced Gene Richards as the Vice President of Arco Indonesia Exploration in Jakarta. John suggested the New Venture team to present the Wiriagar PSC proposal to Marlan Downey, President of Arco International, and his staff of Arco International’s Exploration management headquartered in Plano, Texas, seeking for their approval to enter the block. After a long and thorough discussion, Marlan finally agreed that the team should proceed with a direct negotiation with Pertamina, the Indonesian Oil and Gas State Company for a new Wiriagar PSC, after Conoco relinquished their KBSA block.

Suherman and his New Venture team approached Pertamina and presented a technical review to Pertamina&#x27;s high level management; Zuhdi Pane Pertamina&#x27;s exploration executive staff, Alex Frederik Pertamina&#x27;s Head Negotiator, and other Pertamina&#x27;s senior staffs. The main purpose of the presentation was to provide an explanation to Pertamina on Arco’s interest in acquiring a new Wiriagar PSC within the ex-Conoco&#x27;s KBSA block. The team showed the proposed location of the Wiriagar PSC as well as the main target of the deeper Jurassic sandstone reservoir. Arco Indonesia executive management, Roger Machmud, president of Arco Indonesia, played a significant role during the intense negotiations with Pertamina.

Finally, in February 1993 the onshore Wiriagar PSC was officially awarded to Arco by the Government of Indonesia. In August 1994 the first well, Wiriagar Deep-1 (WD-1) was drilled and tested a cumulative gas flow of per day at standard conditions from the very thick Paleocene turbidite sandstones and thin Middle Jurassic sandstone.

Stephen Scott, a staff geophysicist who joined the New Venture team in late 1994 provided seismic interpretations both for the onshore Wiriagar and the offshore Bintuni Bay, which were used to finalize the appraisal well location and to refine the regional understanding of the area.
The pressure analyses of the WD-1 well, conducted by Larry Casarta and John Marcou, Petroleum Engineer in the team, indicated that the gas accumulation in Wiriagar Deep extends southward to the offshore Occidental&#x27;s Berau Block. Arco International management approached Occidental and negotiated to farm-in into the Berau PSC. In 1995 Arco, joined later by Kanematsu (KG), farmed-in into the Berau PSC for a combined 60% working interest, and assumed operatorship of the block. 

In late 1995 Arco drilled the first well in the offshore Berau PSC, Wiriagar Deep-2 (WD-2) as a confirmation well. The well was very successful, encountered much thicker Middle Jurassic sandstone than in WD-1 and it tested gas in the sandstone interval. The success of WD-1 and WD-2 wells were followed by several delineation wells.

The exploration activities in the area confirmed the presence of another NW-SE anticlinal structure in the Berau PSC to the east of Wiriagar Deep structure. In late 1996, the first well, Vorwata-1, was drilled in this structure and tested 31 MMSCF/D from Middle Jurassic Roabiba sandstone reservoir. 

The New Venture team under the leadership of Suherman as the New Venture manager and John Duncan as Arco Indonesia Exploration Vice President prepared and executed the Wiriagar Deep and initial Vorwata appraisal program. The Wiriagar Deep and Vorwata fields were the main fields that constituted the Tanggguh gas project, with Vorwata field initially providing the gas that fed the Tangguh LNG plant in 2009.

In early 1998 the New Ventures team handed over the Tangguh project to the certification team who continued the Vorwata field appraisal program. The New Venture team continued to work studying the regional geology and evaluating block opportunities in the focus areas of Eastern Indonesia and NW Australian Shelf.

== Overcoming obstacles ==
Arco approached the rest of the KBSA partnership in late 1991 with a recommendation to jointly drill a deep test (Wiriagar Deep No. 1) on the Wiriagar structure.

The partners, who had already spent $145 million on the block, declined the proposal. Arco was unwilling to carry the other partners in a deep test despite the attraction of retaining KBSA&#x27;s sunk cost pool, and no deal was reached among the group.

Arco&#x27;s commercial manager in Jakarta, Thorkild Juul-Dam, then developed an economic case for a new PSC, aided by drilling manager Brett Crawford&#x27;s analysis that the deep well could be drilled for much less than operator Conoco&#x27;s cost estimate. The KBSA PSC expired, and Arco began discussions with Pertamina for a new PSC.

Crucial to these discussions were Roger Machmud, president of Arco Indonesia, and Larry Asbury, operations corporate vice president. Machmud and Asbury entered into serious negotiations with Pertamina in June 1992.

A new onshore Wiriagar PSC covering the deep structure and incorporating newly revised frontier incentives was signed in February 1993. Kanematsu joined Arco as a partner in the block. With help from Richard Leturno of drilling operations, petrophysicist Tony Lawrence and reservoir engineer John Marcou, Wiriagar Deep No. 1 was successfully drilled, logged and tested at in August 1994.

The well was initially disappointing, as it was not an oil discovery.

However, a thoughtful analysis of pressure data by Larry Casarta and John Marcou indicated that the gas zones were significantly overpressured, and that a gas column height in excess of 2,000 feet was a reasonable interpretation of the data.

In other words, the discovery could be large enough to anchor an LNG project even if there was no downdip oil leg below the gas.

Tom Velleca, Arco corporate vice president of exploration, encouraged by chief geologist David Nicklin and chief geophysicist Barry Davis, decided to move ahead with appraisal of the Wiriagar Deep discovery -- but there was a commercial obstacle. If Casarta and Marcou were right about the size of the accumulation, much of the field lay to the south on the offshore Berau PSC held by an Occidental-led partnership.

Brad Sinex at Arco International&#x27;s headquarters in Plano, Texas, took charge of the negotiations with Occidental and worked a farm-in to the Berau Block aided by Thorkild Juul-Dam in Jakarta. Oxy had already spent $64 million on the Berau PSC and had an additional $8 million work obligation.

Sinex was able to secure a 60 percent working interest for the Arco/Kanematsu group and operatorship for Arco in February 1995 in return for funding the drilling of a well. Offshore appraisal subsequently demonstrated that the Wiriagar anticline was indeed a large gas-bearing structure.

Geophysicist Stephen Scott joined the exploration team in December 1994. In addition to producing the maps on which the Wiriagar Deep appraisal locations were selected, Scott worked with Casarta and Sampurno to refine the regional geological picture. Previous Total, Occidental and Arco maps had contoured some small closures to the east of Wiriagar.

Scott put all the regional data together, and conceived that the closures could be part of one large anticline parallel to and immediately east of the Wiriagar fold. The new closure was named Vorwata.

Vorwata had a potential technical problem: At Jurassic level, it was several thousand feet deeper than the Wiriagar anticline, and generally accepted wisdom was that porosity would be low and reservoir quality poor.

John Duncan became exploration VP of Arco Indonesia in 1992, and in addition to managing the Indonesian exploration program was also a technical expert on burial history analysis. Recognizing that there might be a more optimistic scenario for Vorwata Jurassic reservoir quality, Duncan consulted with Alton Brown of Arco&#x27;s geoscience technology group in Plano.

Brown analyzed burial history, facies controls and diagenesis, and concluded that conventional wisdom was wrong and reservoir quality would be fine.

That analysis gave Arco the confidence to push Vorwata as a viable drilling target to expedite certification of gas reserves. Vorwata No. 1 was drilled in late 1996, Brown&#x27;s porosity prediction was exactly correct, and the well tested at in January 1997.

Subsequent appraisal confirmed that Vorwata was a significant gas accumulation. The Wiriagar Deep/Vorwata complex, together with satellite gas accumulations, has now been named Tangguh by the Republic of Indonesia.

After 25 wells, 500 pressure measurements, more than a mile of cores and a 3-D seismic survey, DeGolyer &amp; MacNaughton in mid-1998 estimated Tangguh to contain at least 24 TCF of reserves.

If it wasn&#x27;t for a small group of determined individuals the Tangguh LNG Project may never been.

<text>The Highland Park Ford Plant is a historic former Ford Motor Company factory located at 91 Manchester Street (at Woodward Avenue) in Highland Park, Michigan. It was Ford&#x27;s third factory, it was the second American Model T production facility and it was the first factory in history to assemble automobiles on a moving assembly line. Highland Park became a National Historic Landmark in 1978.

== History ==
Highland Park was designed by Albert Kahn Associates in 1908 and was opened in 1910. Ford automotive production had previously taken place at the Ford Piquette Avenue Plant, where the first Model Ts were built. The Highland Park Ford Plant was approximately northwest of the original Dodge Brothers factory who were subcontractors for Ford, producing precision engine and chassis components for the Model T. It was also approximately northwest of the former Brush-Maxwell plant, which later became Highland Park Chrysler Plant the headquarters for the Chrysler Corporation.

The complex included offices, factories, a power plant and a foundry as part of Ford&#x27;s strategy of integrating the supply chain. About 102 acres in size the Highland Park Plant was the largest manufacturing facility in the world at the time of its opening. Because of its spacious design, it set the precedent for many factories and production plants built thereafter.
Using division of labor, rigorous cost-cutting and process optimization, the factory went through an experience curve to reduce price and increase volume. On October 7, 1913, the Highland Park Ford Plant became the first automobile production facility in the world to implement the moving assembly line. The new assembly line improved production time of the Model T from 728 to 93 minutes. The Highland Park assembly line lowered the price of the Model T from $700 () in 1910 to $350 () in 1917, making it an affordable automobile for most Americans. On January 5, 1914, Ford announced that factory wages would be raised from a daily rate of $2.34 () to $5.00 (), and that daily shifts would be reduced from nine hours to eight. After the increase in pay, Ford claimed that the turnover rate of 31.9 percent in 1913 decreased to 1.4 percent in 1915. Ford offered nearly three times the wages paid at other unskilled manufacturing plants.

In the late 1920s, the open Model T went out of fashion and Ford moved automobile assembly to the River Rouge Plant complex in nearby Dearborn to focus on improving quality with the Model A. Automotive trim manufacturing and Fordson tractor assembly continued at the Highland Park plant. The 1,690 M4A3 Sherman tanks built by Ford from June, 1942 to September, 1943 were assembled in this factory, as well.

During the 1940s through 1960s, the Highland Park plant was a principal location for Ford U.S. tractor manufacture. In the 1970s, the Ford Romeo Engine Plant increasingly displaced it for that role.

Ford sold their building and began leasing the space in 1981. Throughout the 1980s parts of the factory were dismantled and torn down, including a large factory building, the boiler building and the administrative building. 

By the mid-1990s neither plant was producing tractors or tractor parts, as Ford had sold off its tractor and implement interests in stages during the 1990-1993 period.

During the 2010s large portions of steel-framed warehouse buildings were scrapped in favor of a stock yard for tenants. Other companies occupying this property included a scrap yard and a cement plant.

By 2011, Ford used the facility to store documents and artefacts for the Henry Ford Museum. A portion is also occupied by a Forman Mills clothing warehouse that opened in 2006.

==Current status==
The Woodward Avenue Action Association has a purchase agreement with the complex&#x27;s owner, National Equity Corp., to pay $550,000 for two of eight buildings at the historic Ford manufacturing complex: a four-floor, 40,000-square-foot sales office and the 8,000-square-foot executive garage near it. The center would include a theater with continuous videos, informational kiosks, interpretive displays on automotive history and a gift/coffee/snack shop. It could also be a place where visitors could pick up historical automotive tours, such as the current tour offered by the Woodward group, &quot;In the Steps of Henry&quot;.

The former factory is now a mall, named Model-T-Plaza; the mall features architectural features recalling the location&#x27;s origin.

The remaining buildings W, X, Y, and Z at Highland Industrial Center occupy about 1.3 million square feet, and 10 parcels of land go to this site, which was formerly owned by the Woodland-Manchester Corp, and is now currently leased by a security company. No further businesses occupy the lot behind the factory building, as of 2021.

==In the media==
The plant was used as a location for director Shawn Levy&#x27;s 2011 Disney/Touchstone Pictures film &quot;Real Steel&quot;.

<doc id="933605" wikidata="Q240703" url="?curid=933605" title="Atreyu">
<text>Atreyu is an American metalcore band from Yorba Linda, California, formed in 1998. The band&#x27;s current line-up consists of clean vocalist Brandon Saller, guitarists Dan Jacobs and Travis Miguel, and bassist and unclean vocalist Marc &quot;Porter&quot; McKnight.

The band has released nine studio albums: &quot;Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses&quot; (2002), &quot;The Curse&quot; (2004), &quot;A Death-Grip on Yesterday&quot; (2006), &quot;Lead Sails Paper Anchor&quot; (2007), &quot;Congregation of the Damned&quot; (2009), &quot;Long Live&quot; (2015), &quot;In Our Wake&quot; (2018), &quot;Baptize&quot; (2021), and &quot;The Beautiful Dark of Life&quot; (2023).

==History==

===Independent years (1998–2000)===
Originally named Retribution, the band changed their name to &quot;Atreyu&quot; after the character of the same name from Michael Ende&#x27;s fantasy book &quot;The Neverending Story&quot;. The name change came because of a change of members and a progression in their musical styling. In 1998, Atreyu released an independent seven-track EP titled &quot;Visions&quot;. The album was sold at their live performances. Their second release, was a short five-track EP titled &quot;Fractures in the Facade of Your Porcelain Beauty&quot; released by underground label Tribunal Records and featured tracks that would be re-worked for later releases. Atreyu signed with Victory Records in 2001, and their most critically acclaimed works would be to come from these releases. The lineup originally consisted of Alex Varkatzas (lead vocals), Dan Jacobs (guitar), Travis Miguel (guitar), Kyle Stanley (bass guitar). At the time of this lineup, they did not have a drummer until 1999 when Ryan Saller, a friend of the band, invited his younger brother Brandon Saller to join as the drummer.

===Signed to Victory Records (2001–2006)===
In 2001, Atreyu signed with Victory Records, later releasing in 2002 their first studio album &quot;Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses&quot;. Brandon Saller sang for the band as a second singer, who would become more prolific in their later releases. However, for &quot;Suicide Notes and Butterfly Kisses&quot;, his parts were largely confined to choruses. Music videos were filmed for the singles &quot;Ain&#x27;t Love Grand&quot; and &quot;Lip Gloss and Black&quot;. The latter video found significant airplay on &quot;Headbangers Ball&quot; and &quot;Uranium&quot; in fall of 2003, gaining Atreyu some of its initial mainstream attention. Kyle Stanley quit the band was replaced first by Chris Thomson, and then by Marc &quot;Porter&quot; McKnight in 2004.
The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Curse&quot;, was released in 2004, selling 450,000 copies. The band was then featured on the soundtrack to the film &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Smith&quot; with a cover of Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;You Give Love a Bad Name&quot;. Atreyu was also featured on the to &quot;&quot; with &quot;Her Portrait in Black&quot;. &quot;Right Side of the Bed&quot; also appeared on &quot;Burnout 3: Takedown&quot;, a racing video game.

Atreyu released its third studio album, &quot;A Death-Grip on Yesterday&quot;, on March 28, 2006. The album peaked at number 9 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot;, with sales of 69,000. The band gained further fame when the first single, Ex&#x27;s and Oh&#x27;s appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;Madden NFL 07&quot;. The album was said to have a balance of Brandon Saller&#x27;s melodic singing vocals and Varkatzas&#x27;s aggressive screaming, and it was met with positive reviews.&quot;

===Signed to Hollywood Records (2007–2009)===
In early 2007, Atreyu signed a record deal with Hollywood Records for America and an international deal with Roadrunner Records. With a new label, the band began to prepare its fourth studio album, &quot;Lead Sails Paper Anchor&quot;. A jigsaw puzzle was released on the band&#x27;s website, as the goal was to put all the audio clips of the single &quot;Becoming the Bull&quot; into correct order, forming the whole song.
&quot;Lead Sails Paper Anchor&quot; was released on August 28, 2007, and debuted at number 8 on the &quot;Billboard 200&quot; with first-week sales of 43,000 copies. The American release of the album had a bonus track, a cover of the song &quot;Epic&quot; by Faith No More while the European and Australian bonus track was a cover of &quot;Clean Sheets&quot; by The Descendents. The album was received with mixed reviews, and was a notable change in sound for the band.

Atreyu toured in the United States on the Taste of Chaos 2008 tour, alongside bands such as Avenged Sevenfold, Bullet for My Valentine, D&#x27;espairsRay, Mucc, and Blessthefall. The band also toured with co-headliners Avenged Sevenfold and Bullet for My Valentine in Australia and New Zealand. They also played the United Kingdom Taste of Chaos tour, headlining with Story of the Year and As I Lay Dying.

On April 22, 2008, &quot;Lead Sails Paper Anchor&quot; was re-released with new cover art, two bonus tracks, a DVD, and a digital booklet. From July to August 2008, Atreyu headlined the Revolution Stage of Linkin Park&#x27;s Projekt Revolution. Their setlist consisted of 45 minutes of various songs. With them on the stage were 10 Years, Hawthorne Heights, Armor for Sleep, and Street Drum Corps. Atreyu was also a part of the KROQ-FM Epicenter &#x27;09 Show where they did a meet and greet to benefit the non-profit organization Music Saves Lives.

===&quot;Congregation of the Damned&quot; and &quot;Covers of the Damned&quot; (2009–2010)===
Atreyu&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Congregation of the Damned&quot;, was released on October 27, 2009. The album, which was produced by Bob Marlette (who has worked with Ozzy Osbourne and Airbourne) and mixed by Rich Costey (who has worked with System of a Down and Rage Against the Machine), was said to be &quot;darker&quot; and &quot;heavier&quot; than the band&#x27;s previous albums. According to lead singer Alex Varkatzas, the record is a &quot;mix of everything we&#x27;ve ever done. For every song that&#x27;s more melodic or rock-driven there&#x27;s a total shit-kicker, and I think that&#x27;s what makes us a well-rounded band.&quot; Atreyu has also described the album to &quot;Make more sense than the other ones because they finally realize what they are&quot;.
The band started a co-headlining tour with Hollywood Undead, Escape the Fate and The Sleeping in October, and as promotion of album debut songs like &quot;Bleeding Is a Luxury&quot; at K-Rockathon 14 in New York State Fairgrounds, Syracuse, New York., and &quot;Gallows&quot;. Atreyu also promoted the album with five webisodes, released biweekly from September 1 to October 20. Congregation of The Damned debuted at No. 18 on the Billboard 200, selling 27,412 copies on its first week. Atreyu announced that they would be recording an EP &quot;Covers of the Damned&quot; with tourmates Chiodos, blessthefall, Endless Hallway, and Architects (UK). It was to be released on October 12, but was leaked on the internet on October 9. Atreyu toured Australia in November 2010 with the No Sleep Til Festival playing most locations with Dropkick Murphys, Alkaline Trio, Megadeth and many more. In December, along with Bring Me the Horizon they supported Bullet for My Valentine across the United Kingdom.

===New projects and hiatus activities (2011–2013)===
In January 2011, vocalist Alex Varkatzas confirmed, in a short series of Twitter postings, that the band was taking a break from touring and recording to &quot;recharge and focus on other parts of our lives.&quot; In these same Twitter postings, Varkatzas also stated that he has been working on a new project with Bleeding Through vocalist Brandan Schieppati called I Am War.

Drummer and vocalist Brandon Saller&#x27;s side project Hell or Highwater (formerly named &quot;The Black Cloud Collective&quot;) has recorded an album titled &quot;Begin Again&quot; released on August 9, 2011. Saller is solely the lead vocalist in this band, and this album does not feature the same metalcore elements as those of Atreyu, voicing a sound similar to bands such as Breaking Benjamin and Three Days Grace, the band uses only clean vocals.

In December 2011, Travis Miguel added his own endeavors to the list of Atreyu side projects with Fake Figures and their release of the EP &quot;Hail the Sycophants&quot;. This project features an all-star lineup which includes Miguel on guitar, Rus Martin (Hotwire), Robert Bradley (Scars of Tomorrow), and Justin Pointer and Heather Baker who were both former members of Nightfall, a project that bassist Marc McKnight played for in 2003 before joining Atreyu. As of July 2012, Steve Ludwig joined Fake Figures as their new drummer and for around 18 months between 2013 and 2014 Travis played as a touring guitarist with Trapt.

On May 11, 2013, the band posted a statement asking their Facebook fans to repost their message &quot;if you want Atreyu to write a new song for your ears to bleed to.&quot;, with a second statement explaining that they hope to return to a sound more reminiscent of their second studio album, &quot;The Curse&quot;.

===Official reunion and &quot;Long Live&quot; (2014–2017)===

On July 1, 2014, the band officially announced that they&#x27;re back making new music. It was also announced that the band plans to play live again, starting with a headlining show at Chain Reaction on September 11, 2014, and an appearance at the Aftershock Festival on September 14, 2014.

On September 5, 2014, the band released a new song on their YouTube account titled &quot;So Others May Live&quot; and is available on their official website, free of charge. The band was announced as one of the acts to perform in the South by So What?! festival in March at QuikTrip Park in Grand Prairie.

Atreyu played in Slipknot&#x27;s &quot;Knotfest&quot; on the weekend of October 25–26, 2014.

On April 18, 2015, a 7&quot; vinyl was released exclusively for Record Store Day. &quot;So Others May Live&quot; was presented on the vinyl followed by a new song &quot;When the Day Is Done&quot;. Only 1,000 copies were made.

In April 2015, the new album, titled &quot;Long Live&quot; was announced to be released in September. On July 17, 2015, the band released the video for their latest single, &quot;Long Live&quot;, via YouTube.

On September 18, 2015, the album &quot;Long Live&quot; was released. It peaked at number 26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

===&quot;In Our Wake&quot; and departure of Alex Varkatzas (2018–2020)===

On May 22, 2018, Metal Injection reported that Atreyu frontman Alex Varkatzas had sat down with HardDrive Radio&#x27;s Lou Brutus at Rock on the Range, and implied a possible new album will drop in the fall of 2018.

On August 23, 2018, Atreyu released a single titled &quot;Anger Left Behind&quot; and announced that their upcoming album &quot;In Our Wake&quot; will be released on October 12, 2018. As of September 11, Atreyu has released 3 singles including Anger Left Behind, In Our Wake, and The Time Is Now including a music video for the song In Our Wake. Atreyu did a tour to support In Our Wake throughout the Fall of 2018. Memphis May Fire, Ice Nine Kills and Sleep Signals all joined up as support.

On August 19, 2019, Atreyu announced an anniversary tour to celebrate 20 years since the band&#x27;s formation. The setlist for the tour was a 20-song setlist and was chosen by fans in an online poll. The tour spanned 27 cities and featured support from Whitechapel, He Is Legend, Tempting Fate, and Santa Cruz.

In late August 2020, it was rumored that vocalist Alex Varkatzas had left the band. After some uncertainty following these reports, the band officially announced that they were parting ways with Varkatzas a month later on September 30.

===&quot;Baptize&quot; (2020–2023)===
In October 2020, the band released a single titled &quot;Save Us&quot;. They also announced several lineup changes, including the addition of new drummer Kyle Rosa, as Brandon Saller would focus on clean singing only. Meanwhile, bassist Marc McKnight would take over screaming vocals.

On March 4, 2021, the band announced that their eighth studio album &quot;Baptize&quot; would be released on June 4, 2021, through Spinefarm Records. Ahead of the release, they also released two singles: &quot;Warrior&quot; featuring Blink-182 drummer Travis Barker and &quot;Underrated&quot;.

==Musical style and influences==
Atreyu has been described as metalcore, alternative metal, post-hardcore, and hard rock. According to Adrien Begrand of &quot;PopMatters&quot;, &quot;Atreyu is too goth to be emo, too metal to be punk, and too brazenly emotional to be metal&quot;. According to Begrand, Atreyu&#x27;s music often features elements of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, gothic rock, hardcore punk, thrash metal, blues rock, emo, hard rock, screamo and melodic death metal.

In an interview, guitarist Dan Jacobs stated he is a really big &#x27;80s rock fan. He then went on to quote &quot;I love all that stuff and I think that is one generation where music was done right and I try to apply that as much as possible to our music&quot;. He also went on to discuss Atreyu&#x27;s influence from the Gothenburg metal scene. A few bands he mentioned that the band loves are: Arch Enemy, In Flames, Soilwork, and all those type of bands.

In an interview with &quot;Metal Underground&quot;, bassist Porter McKnight spoke of his influences:

<text>Arkhip Ivanovich Kuindzhi ( ; ; – ) was a Russian landscape painter of Greek descent.

==Date of birth==
Kuindzhi&#x27;s exact date of birth is not known. Although it was believed that he was born in 1842, the latest discoveries in archives suggest that he was born in 1841. Kuindzhi himself, when asked by St. Petersburg Academy of Arts to clarify his date of birth, &quot;clearly wrote 1841, then, with doubt, January, and then several times crossed out the month&quot;.

The researchers believe he was born somewhere between January and March 1841. The commonly recognized date is January 27, although Kuindzhi celebrated his name day on February 19 O.S. (March 4 N.S.), on the feast of Archippus.

==Biography==
Arkhip Kuindzhi was born in Mariupol uezd (one of the subdivisions of the Yekaterinoslav Governorate of the Russian Empire) but spent his youth in the city of Taganrog. His Christian name is a Russian rendering of the Greek, Ἄρχιππος, (Archippos, from ἄρχος (archos) &quot;master&quot; and ἱππος (hippos) &quot;horse&quot;: &quot;master of horses&quot;; cf. Colossians 4:17, Philemon 1:2) and his surname came from his grandfather&#x27;s vocational nickname meaning &#x27;goldsmith&#x27; in Crimean Tatar (Urum) (). He grew up in a poor family; his father was a Pontic Greek shoemaker, Ivan Khristoforovich Kuindzhi (elsewhere Emendzhi). Arkhip was six years old when he lost his parents, so he was forced to make a living working at a church building site, grazing domestic animals, and working at a corn merchant&#x27;s shop. He received the rudiments of an education from a Greek friend of the family who was a teacher and then went to the local school.

In 1855, at age 13–14, Kuindzhi visited Feodosia to study art under Ivan Aivazovsky; however, he was engaged merely with mixing paints, and instead studied with Adolf Fessler, Aivazovsky&#x27;s student. A 1903 encyclopedic article stated: &quot;Although Kuindzhi cannot be called a student of Aivazovsky, the latter had without doubt some influence on him in the first period of his activity; he borrowed much from him in his manner of painting&quot;. English art historian John E. Bowlt wrote that &quot;the elemental sense of light and form associated with Aivazovsky&#x27;s sunsets, storms, and surging oceans permanently influenced the young Kuindzhi.&quot;

During the five years from 1860 to 1865, Arkhip Kuindzhi worked as a retoucher in the photography studio of Simeon Isakovich in Taganrog. He tried to open his own photography studio, but without success. After that, Kuindzhi left Taganrog for Saint Petersburg.

He studied painting mainly independently and at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts (from 1868; a full member since 1893). He was co-partner of travelling art exhibitions (Peredvizhniki), a group of realist artists in Russia who, in protest to academic restrictions, formed an artists&#x27; cooperative which evolved into the Society for Traveling Art Exhibitions (Peredvizhniki) in 1870.

In 1872, the artist left the academy and worked as a freelancer. The painting &quot;On the Valaam Island&quot; was the first artwork which Pavel Tretyakov acquired for his art gallery. In 1873, Kuindzhi exhibited his painting &quot;The Snow&quot; which received the bronze medal at the International Art Exhibition in London in 1874. In the middle of the 1870s, he created a number of paintings in which the landscape motif was designed for concrete social associations in the spirit of Peredvizhniki (&quot;Forgotten Village&quot;, 1874; &quot;Chumatski Path&quot;, 1875; both – in the Tretyakov Gallery).

In his mature period Kuindzhy aspired to capture the most expressive illuminative aspect of the natural condition. He applied composite receptions (high horizon, etc.), creating panoramic views. Using light effects and intense colors shown in main tones, he depicted the illusion of illumination (&quot;Evening in Ukraine&quot;, 1876; &quot;A Birch Grove&quot;, 1879; &quot;After a Thunderstorm&quot;, 1879; all three are in the Tretyakov Gallery; &quot;Moonlit Night on the Dnieper&quot;, 1880 in the Russian Museum, St. Petersburg). His later works are remarkable for their decorative effects of color building.

Kuindzhi also developed a close friendship with the chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, who taught at Saint Petersburg University. Kuindzhi attended his classes as an auditor or student. Kuindzhi frequently visited Mendeleev and his wife&#x27;s weekly gatherings, and he developed a life-long interest in the study of light, color, and perception.

Kuindzhi lectured at the St. Petersburg Academy of Arts (Professor since 1892; professor-head of landscape workshop since 1894; but was fired in 1897 for support of students&#x27; protests). Among his students were artists such as Arkady Rylov, Nicholas Roerich, Konstantin Bogaevsky, and others. Kuindzhi initiated the creation of the Society of Artists in 1909, later the Society was named after him.

==Theft of works==
In January 2019, his work &quot;Ai-Petri. Crimea&quot; was stolen from Moscow&#x27;s Tretyakov Gallery, but was found and safely recovered the next day. The man who stole the painting was sentenced to three years in prison.

On 21 March 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Kuindzhi Art Museum was damaged in a Russian airstrike during the siege of Mariupol. Although three original paintings by Kuindzhi that had been held in the collection—a sketch for &quot;Red Sunset&quot;, and two preparatory works, &quot;Elbrus&quot; and &quot;Autumn&quot;—had been placen in the museum&#x27;s basement prior to the bombing and were not damaged, they were then taken by Russia as part of its looting campaign.

<doc id="933611" wikidata="Q5039739" url="?curid=933611" title="Carkeek Park">
<text>Carkeek Park is a in the Broadview neighborhood of Seattle, Washington, United States. The park offers various attractions, including Piper Orchard, Pipers Creek with its tributaries, Venema Creek and Mohlendorph Creek, as well as picnic areas, shelters, and hiking trails.

Carkeek Park features diverse habitats—saltwater, riparian, wetland, upland forest, and meadow—that support a wide range of wildlife. Visitors can explore a six-mile trail network leading to a beach, playground, and a salmon imprinting pond, with scenic views of the Olympic Mountains and Puget Sound. The trails also pass by Demonstration Gardens and remnants of the park&#x27;s original fir, hemlock, and cedar forests.

A pedestrian bridge over the BNSF Railway connects to the park&#x27;s sand beach on Puget Sound. The Carkeek Park Environmental Learning Center hosts many of the park&#x27;s educational programs.

==History==

Seattle&#x27;s first park to be called &quot;Carkeek Park&quot; was on Pontiac Bay, Lake Washington, near Sand Point. It was created with a financial gift to the city from Morgan J. Carkeek, a prominent builder and contractor. The park was condemned by the federal government in 1926 for the construction of Naval Station Puget Sound, which was later returned to the city and is now Magnuson Park. Carkeek offered $25,000 towards the creation of a new park, which the city accepted and themselves funded $100,000 to acquire land.

The new site, also called Carkeek Park, is situated on Puget Sound at the mouth of a creek known in Lushootseed as &quot;kʷaatəb&quot;, meaning &quot;place where people are sent.&quot; Located in a steep canyon, its rugged terrain has protected the park from the urban expansion that has transformed much of Seattle. The property was owned by the family of city councilmember and baker A. W. Piper, who had established a homestead along Pipers Creek after losing his shop in the Great Seattle Fire in 1889.

Carkeek Park was formally dedicated on August 24, 1929, with 2,500 people in attendance for the ceremonies led by Vivian Carkeek, son of Morgan J. Carkeek. The park served a variety of purposes in the 20th century: it hosted outdoor performances, provided feed for zoo animals, and even briefly became an Army camp during World War II. In the 1930s, workers from the Civilian Conservation Corps built park structures, only to see them removed by 1938. Plans for an equestrian academy in the late 1940s were halted by budget shortfalls. Meanwhile, a sewage treatment plant that operated for years was eventually replaced by a Combined sewer overflow and pump station near the beach constructed by the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle.

An additional was acquired for the park in 1953 by the city government. Carkeek Park was re-dedicated on July 9, 1955, a year after the city annexed the park and the adjacent Broadview neighborhood. The park had been renovated with paved roads, new beach and picnic areas, and an archery range, and paved roads. A walkway over the railroad tracks to the beach was constructed in 1956. The archery range was relocated to Magnuson Park in 1985 after residents near Carkeek Park complained of stray arrows.

Carkeek Park&#x27;s natural landscape has seen significant changes. Originally covered in old growth forest, it was clearcut by the early 20th century. Today, the park features a mature maple-alder forest in a successional stage, with evergreens like Western red cedar and Douglas fir slowly reclaiming their dominance. Wetlands host cattails and sedges, and huge lady ferns fill the ravine between 105th and 110th streets.

==Amenities==

===Piper&#x27;s Orchard===
Piper&#x27;s Orchard, Seattle&#x27;s oldest, was planted by settler A. W. Piper after the Great Seattle Fire of 1889. Neglected for decades, the orchard was rediscovered in 1981. Volunteers restored the trees and planted new ones, forming the Friends of Piper&#x27;s Orchard to preserve and restore the property.

===Playground===
The Carkeek Park playground, designed to emulate the Pipers Creek watershed, features a 19-foot purple salmon slide, tiny caves, and a stream. These elements are intended to educate children about local nature and history. The project required $275,000 in funding and several years of planning and physical labor, culminating in its completion by local parents and neighbors. It officially opened in 1997.

===Demonstration garden===
Carkeek Park hosts the largest master gardener demonstration garden in King County. The garden covers an acre and features various themed beds connected by gravel paths, aiming to educate home gardeners on creating wildlife-friendly spaces using sustainable plants. It promotes local ecosystem health by avoiding harmful chemicals and offers educational workshops for gardening enthusiasts. The park includes accessible paths and picnic facilities, serving as a community resource for education and recreation.

===Environmental Learning Center===
The Carkeek Park Environmental Learning Center (ELC) was designed to demonstrate sustainable building practices aligned with U.S. Green Building Council standards. It was the first City of Seattle building to achieve LEED Gold Certification.

The center includes rooftop rainwater harvesting, energy-efficient insulation, and solar panels via Seattle City Light’s Green Power program. It also features salmon-friendly landscaping for stormwater management. Its construction utilized recycled and regional materials to reduce transportation-related energy use.

The ELC closed in 2013 due to city budget cuts and is no longer open to the public.

==Salmon habitat==
In 1987, chum salmon returned to Pipers Creek after a 50-year absence, following restoration efforts launched in 1979 by the Carkeek Watershed Community Action Project. The initiative, supported by the Suquamish Tribe, state agencies, Seattle Public Utilities, and Seattle Parks, focused on improved storm water management practices to revive the salmon run. Peak season to see returning salmon is November. In autumn 2023, beavers took up residence on the creek near its outlet into Puget Sound, building a dam, altering the environment, and complicating the maintenance of the salmon run.

On November 12, 2024, a total of 1,779 salmon were counted in Carkeek Park as part of the annual volunteer counting program for the autumn spawning run. It was a record amount for Pipers Creek, which had reached lows of 54 fish in 2019 and 190 in 2020.
