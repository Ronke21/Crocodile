<text>Lucius Dubignon Clay (23 April 1898 – 16 April 1978) was a senior officer of the United States Army who was known for his administration of occupied Germany after World War II. He served as the deputy to General of the Army Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1945; deputy military governor, Germany, in 1946; Commander in Chief, United States Forces in Europe and military governor of the United States Zone, Germany, from 1947 to 1949. Clay orchestrated the Berlin Airlift (1948–1949) when the USSR blockaded West Berlin.

==Early life==
Clay was born on April 23, 1898, in Marietta, Georgia, the sixth and last child of Alexander S. Clay, who served in the United States Senate from 1897 to 1910. In 1918 Clay graduated from West Point, where he later taught.

==Early career==
Clay held various civil and military engineering posts in the 1920s and 1930s, such as directing the construction of dams and civilian airports. Because Clay&#x27;s work involved large government projects, he became closely acquainted with the people and workings of the federal agencies and Congress. He achieved close working relationships with an associate of President Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Hopkins, and with House Majority Leader and Speaker Sam Rayburn. In Rayburn&#x27;s state of Texas, Clay supervised the building of the Denison Dam. At the time of its completion, in 1943, it was the largest earthen dam in the world. From 1940 to the December 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor, Clay selected and supervised the construction of 450 airports, which were the foundation of America&#x27;s civil aviation network. This initiative was, however, criticised for pork barrel spending, as Clay&#x27;s home state of Georgia was granted 33 airports, a number that overstated the state&#x27;s importance economically, militarily, and demographically.

==World War II==
By March 1942, Clay had risen to the position of being the youngest brigadier general in the army, a month short of his 44th birthday. All the while, he had acquired a reputation for bringing order and operational efficiency out of chaos, and for being an exceptionally hard and disciplined worker, who went long hours and &quot;considered lunch a waste of time&quot;.

Clay did not see actual combat but was awarded the Legion of Merit in 1942 and the Army Distinguished Service Medal in 1944 and received the Bronze Star Medal for his action in stabilizing the French harbor of Cherbourg, which was critical to the flow of war matériel. In 1945, he served as deputy to General Dwight Eisenhower. The following year, he was made Deputy Governor of Germany during the Allied Military Government.

Clay would later remark regarding the occupation directive guiding his and Eisenhower&#x27;s actions that &quot;there was no doubt that JCS 1067 contemplated the Carthaginian peace which dominated our operations in Germany during the early months of occupation.&quot;

==OMGUS and Cold War==

Clay was promoted to lieutenant general on 17 April 1945 and to general on 17 March 1947.

Clay heavily influenced US Secretary of State James F. Byrnes&#x27; September 1946 speech in Stuttgart, Germany. The speech, &quot;Restatement of Policy on Germany,&quot; marked the formal transition in American occupation policy away from the Morgenthau Plan of economic dismantlement to one of economic reconstruction.

On 15 March 1947, Clay succeeded Joseph T. McNarney as military governor (or &quot;high commissioner&quot;) of the US zone of occupied Germany—the head of the OMGUS, the &quot;Office of Military Government, United States.&quot; Clay&#x27;s responsibilities covered a wide spectrum of social issues related to Germany&#x27;s recovery from the war in addition to strictly military issues. He commissioned Lewis H. Brown to research and write &quot;A Report on Germany&quot;, which served as a detailed recommendation for the reconstruction of postwar Germany and served as a basis for the Marshall Plan. Clay promoted democratic federalism in Germany and resisted US politicians who sought to undo a constitution that a Constituent Assembly in Bavaria had adopted on 26 October 1946. He also closed the borders of the American Zone in 1947 to stem the tide of Jewish refugees that was generating tension with the local populations.

===Treatment of Nazis during governorship===
Clay was responsible for the controversial commuting of some death sentences, such as convicted Nazi war criminals Erwin Metz and his superior, Hauptmann Ludwig Merz. Metz and Merz were two notorious figures of the Berga concentration camp in which 350 U.S. POWs had been beaten, tortured, starved, and forced to work for the German government during World War II. The soldiers were singled out for looking or sounding Jewish. At least 70 U.S. POWs soldiers died in the camp and on a death march near the end of the war. The commutation was partly due to the military botching the case. Prosecutors did not summon a single witness, despite dozens of witnesses saying they were willing to testify.

Clay also reduced the sentence of Ilse Koch, the &quot;Beast of Buchenwald&quot;, who had been convicted of murder at the Nuremberg trials, and who had been accused of having gloves and lampshades made from prisoners&#x27; skin. Clay later said he commuted Koch&#x27;s sentence since none of the documents about Koch actually mentioned the fact or included any evidence of her committing murder. The reductions in sentences were based on the hasty convictions of some Buchenwald personnel following the end of the war. Evidence was sometimes questionable, and many witnesses claimed to have been beaten by Allied interrogators. Clay confirmed several death sentences as valid, commuted several, and had some like Koch released after they had served a reduced sentence because of questionable evidence. Under the pressure of public opinion, Koch was rearrested in 1949, tried before a West German court, and, on 15 January 1951, sentenced to life imprisonment.

According to BBC journalist Tom Bower, despite Clay&#x27;s mixed record, he was one of only two prominent American and British officials, the other being British diplomat Patrick Dean, who were both competent and showed some level of genuine commitment to denazification. According to Donald Bloxham, Clay&#x27;s influence was crucial to American occupation authorities prosecuting major Nazi war criminals on their own in the Subsequent Nuremberg trials.

In 1946, Clay announced to West German officials that he was disappointed with their results from denazification tribunals:&quot;I do not see how you can demonstrate your ability for self-government nor your will for democracy if you are going to evade or shirk the first unpleasant and difficult task that falls upon you. Unless there is real and rapid improvement, I can only assume that German administration is unwilling to accept this responsibility.&quot;The results temporarily improved after Clay ordered them to make improvements within 60 days. In late 1948, Clay admitted he did not enjoy, in his position as Military Governor, having to regularly &quot;sign many death warrants and to approve many life imprisonments.&quot; Nevertheless, he was willing to and did approve most death sentences imposed by American military tribunals. He also approved all but one of the sentences imposed in the Subsequent Nuremberg trials.

Near the end of the occupation, Clay openly admitted his hopes for denazification were failing. In June 1948, a blanket stay of execution had been granted to all of the Nazi war criminals on death row in the U.S. occupation zone. This came after false allegations of torture were propagated by several politicians in the United States, especially Senator Joseph McCarthy. In October 1948, however, the stay was removed for nearly everyone, excluding those convicted in the Malmedy massacre trial. Upon the lifting of the stay, Clay embarked on a spate of last-minute mass executions, believing that as time passed, pressure would increase for the death sentences to be commuted. In response, the German Catholic priests started objecting to not only the executions, but the prosecutions of war criminals outright. However, their pleas failed to convince Clay to halt the executions. Between October 1948 and March 1949, over 100 Nazi war criminals convicted by U.S. military tribunals were hanged at Landsberg Prison.

===Berlin Airlift===

On 25 June 1948, one day after the Soviets imposed the Berlin Blockade, Clay gave the order for the Berlin Airlift, which was only later authorized by President Harry Truman. That was an act of defiance against the Soviets, an incredible feat of logistics (at one point, cargo planes landed at Tempelhof every four minutes, 24 hours a day), a defining moment of the Cold War, and a demonstration of American support for the citizens of Berlin.

Clay is remembered for ordering and maintaining the airlift, which would ultimately last 324 days and ended on 30 September 1949. He resigned his post days after the blockade had been lifted on 12 May 1949.

==Later career==
On 15 May 1949, Clay left Germany and was replaced by John McCloy as civilian high commissioner for Germany. Clay retired from the Army at the end of the month. In the same year, he was elected as an honorary member of the North Carolina Society of the Cincinnati. In 1950, he became the chairman of the Continental Can Company for 12 consecutive years. He retired from Continental Can in 1962 to become a senior partner in Lehman Brothers investment banking house until his retirement in 1973.

===Cultural cold war===
Meanwhile, Clay hired the American intellectual and former Army combat historian Melvin J. Lasky. Both developed the concept of a &quot;cultural cold war&quot; through which the Soviets would be fought at a psychological and intellectual level. Clay was instrumental in creating, funding, and promoting &quot;Der Monat&quot;, a journal intended to support US foreign policy and win over German intellectuals. Copies of &quot;Der Monat&quot; were delivered along with supplies during the airlift.

Clay also studied television propaganda and suggested that in Europe &quot;you get this constant repeated propaganda without advertising and without break,&quot; but in the United States, &quot;the advertising gives you a direct feeling of assurance that you haven&#x27;t got propaganda in the program being thrown at you.&quot;

===Eisenhower administration and Crusade for Freedom===
After OMGUS ended, Clay served the United States in other capacities. He had previous experience in 1933 with managing and organizing projects under the New Deal and later became one of Dwight Eisenhower&#x27;s closest advisers and assisted him in securing the 1952 Republican nomination and helping him select members of his cabinet upon ascension to the presidency. When Eisenhower was in office, Clay served as his unofficial emissary in Europe. One of his first duties as Eisenhower&#x27;s emissary and, as the national chairman of the Crusade for Freedom, was to dedicate the city of Berlin&#x27;s Liberty Bell. In 1954, he was called upon by Eisenhower to help forge a plan for financing the proposed Interstate highway system.

During the Berlin Crisis of 1961, President John F. Kennedy asked him to be an adviser and to go to Berlin and report on the situation. Two years later Clay accompanied Kennedy on his trip to Berlin. During his famous Ich bin ein Berliner speech, Kennedy said, &quot;I am proud .. to come here in the company of my fellow American, General Clay, who has been in this city during its great moments of crisis and will come again if ever needed.&quot; That mention triggered enthusiastic cheers from the hundreds of thousands gathered to hear the president.

===Foundations, corporations, and committees: 1950–1978===
The George C. Marshall Foundation, which oversees Clay&#x27;s correspondences with corporations, foundations, and committees, assembled an alphabetical list that gives a very good overview of Clay&#x27;s broad range of activities in those fields.

==Death and burial==

Clay died on April 16, 1978, in Chatham, Massachusetts. Clay lies buried in West Point Cemetery, between the graves of Apollo 1 astronaut Ed White and Panama Canal chief engineer George W. Goethals. At Clay&#x27;s grave site is a stone plate from the citizens of Berlin that says: &quot;Wir danken dem Bewahrer unserer Freiheit&quot; (We thank the Preserver of our Freedom).

==Family==

Lucius Clay was the father of two sons, both of whom became generals. Clay&#x27;s son, General Lucius D. Clay Jr., held the positions of commander-in-chief of the North American Air Defense Command, the Continental Air Defense Command, and the United States element of NORAD, and was also a commander of the United States Air Force Aerospace Defense Command. Clay&#x27;s other son, Major General Frank B. Clay, served in conflicts from World War II through the Vietnam War, and was an adviser to the US delegation at the Paris peace talks which ended US involvement in the Vietnam War.

==Honors==
Clay was given a ticker-tape parade, among many other honors, upon his return to the United States on 19 May 1949. He appeared on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine three times. Clay also received an honorary doctorate of the Freie Universität Berlin and became an honorary citizen of Berlin (West) in 1953. One of the longest streets in West Berlin was named &quot;Clayallee&quot; in his honor, as was the Clay Headquarters Compound, which was located on the street. It held the headquarters of the Berlin Brigade, U.S. Army Berlin (USAB), and the U.S. Mission in Berlin. Marietta, Georgia, named one of its major streets &quot;Clay Road&quot;, and South Cobb High School&#x27;s football stadium is named &quot;Clay Stadium&quot; in honor of his work in creating what is now Dobbins Air Force Base there. While now called South Cobb Drive (State Route 280), it still carries memorial signs at each end dedicating the highway to him. 

In 1978, a new U.S. Army base in Northern Germany north of the city of Bremen was named for Clay and until the end of the Cold War housed a forward-stationed brigade of the 2nd Armored Division, the 3rd Brigade, 2nd Armored Division, which had been based at Fort Hood, Texas, with the rest of the 2AD. This unit was redesignated as the 2nd Armored Division (Forward). 2AD (FWD) saw action in the Gulf War of 1991 before being inactivated as part of the post-Cold War drawdown of the U.S. Army. Since 1 October 1993, these barracks are used by the Bundeswehr and are still named after Clay. The &quot;General-Clay-March&quot; by Heinz Mertins was written in his honor. Wiesbaden Army Airfield, near Frankfurt, Germany, was renamed &quot;Lucius D. Clay Kaserne&quot; in his honor on 14 June 2012. Wiesbaden Army Airfield was used extensively in &quot;Operation Vittles,&quot; aka the Berlin Airlift. The name &quot;Lucius Clay&quot; features in the song &quot;The Legend of Wooley Swamp&quot; by the Charlie Daniels Band. Clay had just died (of emphysema and heart failure) around the time the song was written.

==Awards and decorations==
Clay&#x27;s decorations include: the Army Distinguished Service Medal with two Oak Leaf Clusters, Legion of Merit, Bronze Star Medal, World War I Victory Medal, Army of Occupation of Germany Medal, American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, European-African-Middle Eastern Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal, Army of Occupation Medal, Order of Kutuzov First Class, Order of the British Empire, Military Order of the White Lion, Officer of the Military William Order, Commander of the Legion of Honour and Bundesverdienstkreuz (Grand Cross).
In addition to military awards, he was also awarded the international human rights award Dr.-Rainer-Hildebrandt-Medaille.

<text>The Manx Electric Railway (Manx: &quot;Raad Yiarn Lectragh Vannin&quot;) is an electric interurban tramway connecting Douglas, Laxey and Ramsey in the Isle of Man. It connects with the Douglas Bay Horse Tramway at its southern terminus at Derby Castle at the northern end of the promenade in Douglas, and with the Snaefell Mountain Railway at Laxey. Many visitors take an excursion on the trams. It is the oldest electric tram line in the world whose original rolling stock is still in service.

==History==
The Manx Electric Railway was built by Alexander Bruce, a banker, Frederick Saunderson, a civil engineer and Alfred Jones Lusty, a land owner, who formed the Douglas Bay Estate company to develop land north of Douglas.

Construction started in 1893 with the short line from a depot at Derby Castle Depôt in Douglas to Groudle Glen, and regular public services started on 7 September 1893.

Anticipating the second stage of the railway (an extension from Groudle to Laxey), the company was known as the Douglas and Laxey Coast Electric Tramway Company. Construction of this next stage started in February 1894. It was formally opened on 28 July of the same year. The name was temporary, as further expansion was planned, and it became known as the Isle of Man Tramways and Electric Power Company.

An extension to Ramsey was approved in May 1897. The line from Laxey to Ramsey opened on 2 August 1898 by the Lieutenant Governor, John Henniker-Major, 5th Baron Henniker. At that date the line ran as far as Ballure, on the outskirts of Ramsey. The final extension to the centre of Ramsey was opened on 24 July 1899.
===20th century===
The construction of such a lengthy line in a short period of time had stretched the company&#x27;s finances, and it was £150,000 in debt. The owning bank foreclosed on the loan and as a consequence Dumbell&#x27;s Bank failed. The company was liquidated. In 1902 the assets were purchased by Herbert Kidson on behalf of a syndicate of businessmen from Manchester, and the Manx Electric Railway company was born. The sale, which included the Snaefell Mountain Railway, was for £252,000 ().

On 2 August 1902, King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra travelled from Douglas to Ramsey in enclosed trailer No. 59.

In 1917, the refreshment room at Laxey was destroyed by fire. Fire caused more damage at Laxey in 1930, when the car shed was destroyed, along with four cars, seven trailers, three tower wagons and an open wagon. The car shed was later rebuilt.

The railway struggled financially after the end of World War II, and in 1957 it was nationalised at a cost of £50,000 (). A nationalisation livery of green and white was applied to some trams and trailers for a limited time, though this was unpopular and later dropped. A government board was formed to manage the line and the Snaefell Mountain Railway (and still does so after various changes of title from the original &quot;Manx Electric Railway Board&quot; to &quot;Isle of Man Passenger Transport Board&quot;, and now Isle of Man Heritage Railways (the word &quot;heritage&quot; was added in 2009). This is a division of the Department of Infrastructure of the Isle of Man Government, which also operates the Island&#x27;s buses as Bus Vannin).

The government invested heavily in the railway starting in 1957, initiating a rail replacement programme between Derby Castle and Laxey at a cost of £25,000 per year for 10 years. The Laxey to Ramsey section was continually under threat; in 1975, the railway lost the mail contract, and services from Laxey to Ramsey were suspended. After public protest, services to Ramsey restarted in 1977.
===21st century===

The section between Laxey and Ramsey was closed again in summer 2008, after a consultancy report commissioned by the Isle of Man Government exposed critical failings in the permanent way, deeming it unsuitable for passenger service in the near future. The Island&#x27;s parliament, Tynwald, agreed to spend nearly £5 million for track replacement in July–September, allowing trams to run on a single track, according to a news report. Manx authorities were considering vintage buses as a replacement during the closure, reports previously stated. The resignation of the Tourism and Leisure Minister Adrian Earnshaw was called for by enthusiasts, and Chief Minister Tony Brown ordered an urgent review of the closure decision. He also ordered an independent inquiry into how the track had been allowed to get into such a state. In 2009, the full line operated continuously, and it has continued to do so during the summer season since the beginning of the 2010 season at Easter, except for COVID-related suspension, with no rail-related incidents affecting services. Until 1998, the line operated a year-round service, but since then it has run seasonally, usually between March and the beginning of November, though the dates can vary from season to season.

==Service and routing==
The line runs on roadside reservation for the first few miles from Douglas and then on segregated track through the countryside for most of the route to Ramsey. However, there are a large number of level crossings, with the main A2 and with various minor roads.
The line is narrow gauge and is long. It is largely segregated from road traffic, running on double track on roadside reservation or private right-of-way, and is electrified using overhead lines at 550 volts direct current. Initially the trams used pairs of Hopkinson bow collectors (still used on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, owing to their dependability in strong winds on the mountain) but by the turn of the 20th century they were fitted with trolley poles, the method still employed. Originally the electricity was generated by the railway&#x27;s own power stations, but now it comes via the Island&#x27;s national grid, run by the Manx Electricity Authority. Closure of the line during the winter has allowed substantial investment in infrastructure, including relaying longer stretches of track.
Originally the service was provided by about 24 closed motor tramcars and the same number of open trailers: the earliest of these date from 1893 and almost all are pre-1910. Two of the three cars that opened the line in 1893 are still in use, and they are the oldest electric trams at work on their original line in the world. The design pre-dates any consensus on design, and they have distinctive boxy bodies. Most services are operated by a motor car towing a single trailer. The trailer is often removed in &quot;inclement&quot; weather. The later cars can haul two trailers. This has never been common practice (in recent years this has included in a few &quot;special&quot; services as part of the long-running series of events) although it was not uncommon for cars to haul a box-van for freight and, until 1975, a mail van. In September 1975 the line was closed between Laxey and Ramsey, but in 1977 the Ramsey section was reopened. From 1977 a limited winter service operated on weekdays, suspended in 1998 as an economy measure. The line operates a seasonal timetable with services from Douglas terminating at Laxey or Ramsey, with some short workings in connection with the Groudle Glen Railway in peak season, and limited evening operation as far as Laxey in peak season to tie in with evening services on the Snaefell Mountain Railway, which since 2009 has provided a weekly &quot;Sunset Dinner&quot; service including a meal at the summit. The possibility of a limited evening service to Ramsey has been considered in recent times, and trams are sometimes chartered during summer for enthusiasts&#x27; excursions.

==Stations==

There are several intermediate stations, with Groudle Glen, Laxey, Dhoon Glen, Cornaa and Ballaglass Glen shown in timetables. The official stopping points usually have a basic waiting shelter (more recent additions have been modern bus shelters), and there are &quot;unofficial&quot; stopping points that sometimes have &quot;request stop&quot; notices but not nameboards or other passenger facilities. Several in the more rural areas have the name of the nearby farm or farmer; these are most prevalent in the northern section with names such as Rome&#x27;s Crossing, Watson&#x27;s Crossing and Dhoon Farm, but none of these has carried its name. Some stopping points are known by their nearest pole number, numbered 1 to 1,904 from Derby Castle to Ramsey. Trams stop within reason at any point where it is safe to do so, except where the line runs parallel to a main road. The majority of the line as far as Baldrine railway station runs in this way, as does the approach to Ramsey. These sections were originally toll roads, built at the same time as the line.

==Tramcars and trailers==
The line is in many ways unique, not least because it still operates entirely with its original rolling stock, except for winter saloon 22, which was completely rebuilt after a fire in 1990 which made the bodywork unusable. A considerable amount of stock was lost in a disastrous fire at Laxey in 1930, but other than this all the original stock remains. In recent times the storage of excess stock has become something of a political &quot;hot potato&quot;: several vehicles were stored off-site; they all returned to on-site storage in November 2009, requiring considerable attention before returning to traffic in many cases. The line belongs to the Isle of Man Government, formerly as part of the Department of Community, Culture &amp; Leisure, which does not see the requirement to retain unused stock that has no potential use or long-term storage place on the railway. The line has Lisbon tram purchased in 1999, but this has never seen use due to clearance difficulties (it was used as a passenger waiting shelter for a spell). It is no longer on the railway, but remains on the Island.
The following trams were in passenger service in the 2010 season, with the mainstay of the services being winter saloons or tunnel cars. Original tramcars 1 and 2 are both operational but are not usually in day-to-day use, tunnel cars 5 and 6 see use in peak summer season and illuminated car 9 (also a member of this class) is used in conjunction with the evening services on the Groudle Glen Railway in July and August. Winter saloons 19–22 operate the core timetable. There are serviceable open toastracks, numbers 26, 32 and 33 (the last two being the most powerful on the line). Many other cars remain in the railway&#x27;s possession but out of service and in some cases off-site. Trailers used include lightweight trailers 37 and 49, bulkheads 40–48 which usually accompany the winter saloons, lightweight trailer 51, converted disabled saloon 56, closed saloons 57 and 58 and 61–62. The Royal Saloon, No. 59, makes rare public appearances. As part of the annual transport festival car 32 occasionally operates a special evening service hauling two trailers, an unusual occurrence despite the later cars being built with the capability to operate in this way. Car 7 was relegated to permanent way duties for a number of years but was restored for return to traffic in 2011. Locomotive 23 is privately owned; car 34 (previously No. 7 &quot;Maria&quot; on the Snaefell Mountain Railway and regauged) is undergoing maintenance, and other cars receive remedial attention as and when time and funding allows.

Throughout its history, the MER has had a total of 34 motor cars, of which 27 survive today in some shape or form. The history of the unpowered half of the MER&#x27;s passenger vehicle fleet is complicated, as there have been withdrawals, scrappings, replacements, conversions and several renumberings.

The motors are numbered mainly in order of construction; however, this does not apply to the trailers: these have always followed on from the highest numbered motor. This changed several times between 1893 and 1906, and some trailers have carried several numbers as they were renumbered almost yearly to allow for new arrivals. Some were even converted into motors.

==Wagons==
The history of the freight carrying wagons and vans of the Manx Electric Railway is complicated and varied, from an initial start with only four wagons, to the heyday in the 1920s–1930s, to the current modern-day situation where only a handful are in serviceable condition.

==Permanent way==
Since its opening, there has been a varying level of commitment to keeping the line in serviceable condition. A great variety of stock has been either bought in or converted from previous examples, some gaining a more unlikely use than others.

==Visitors==
There have been many visiting examples of traction and stock to the Manx Electric Railway throughout its history, some used in the original construction of the line, others for special events and centenaries.

==Incidents==

Owing to the number of open and ungated level crossings there are minor collisions, and these are reported in the local press. These have become more commonplace but are usually minor; warning signage to alert motorists that trams are operating has been erected at the start of each season in recent times, but incidents still occur. There are many occupation crossings, some with restricted visibility for motorists. One such incident took place on Monday, 27 July 2009, when a vehicle carrying a mechanical excavator came into contact with the overhead wires supplying power to both the line and the Snaefell Mountain Railway at a busy road crossing in Laxey; there were no injuries. Police and the line&#x27;s electrical engineering crews attended the scene, the report also said. It did not indicate what damage had occurred. Service resumed the next day after temporary repairs to the overhead lines, which were permanently repaired over the subsequent couple of weeks. An investigation into the incident was scheduled to take place later.

About 70 metres of copper overhead wire were stolen between late January and 14 February 2012 between Laxey and Ramsey. Police recovered the stolen material.

On 7 July 2015, trailer 58 suffered a serious derailment on a relatively new crossover just north of Laxey Station, toppling onto its side. Services were suspended between Laxey and Ramsey. A complex operation was undertaken to lift the trailer back upright. It required a road closure, removal of overhead line equipment and a large crane. The re-railed trailer was then moved by tractor to Laxey Station and has since returned to service after overhaul.

They first appeared in &quot;Shadow Cabinet&quot; #0 (January 1994), and were created by Dwayne McDuffie, Robert L. Washington III and John Paul Leon. Almost all of the original run, issues #4-11 and #13-17, were written by Matt Wayne.

==Publication history==
In the Milestone Comics universe the Shadow Cabinet is a secret organization of superhuman beings acting to protect the world by neutralizing potential threats while they are still relatively harmless - &quot;to save humanity from itself, no matter what that requires&quot;.

Various Cabinet members may be sent on &quot;deep-cover&quot; missions lasting months, or even years (during which time some choose to defect), their total membership at any time is known only to their leader.

The base of operations for the Shadow Cabinet is the Shadowspire, a subterranean complex within the Himalayas and typically accessible only via the Shadowslide, their teleporter (so named because, if the subject&#x27;s origin is not in complete darkness at the time of teleport, the machine overloads and cannot be used for up to an hour).

An all new Shadow Cabinet emerged in the post-&quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; DC Universe in pages of Justice League of America. After attempting to abduct Doctor Light they find themselves in conflict with the Justice League. It turns out that Icon and Superman were secretly working together and the two teams end up joining forces to save the universe as Dharma brings together the DC and Milestone universes into one unified continuity.

==Team biography==
===Red Dog===
Red Dog, a powerful Irish sorcerer, is the leader of the Shadow Cabinet from the late nineteenth century until the mid twentieth. Several of his people include &#x27;Bent Nature&#x27;, &#x27;Ether&#x27;, &#x27;The Magnate&#x27; and &#x27;Munition&#x27;.

Red Dog recruits Dharma as his replacement, but his activities do not end there. Dharma is slain by one of his own people and Red Dog steps in to bring him back to life. Red Dog disagrees with Dharma&#x27;s efforts to take over the world and re-forms his own Cabinet to stop him.

===Dharma===
Dharma, otherwise known as Harry Chawney, has the power to perceive the past and future of any object he touches. He has perceived countless apocalypses, and is ruthless in acting to prevent them, whatever the cost. In theory, he knows the ultimate consequences of whatever action he sends his operatives to perform; however, the impossibility of considering every factor has led to his fear that he may be causing the very disasters he is trying to prevent - in the words of one agent: &quot;What about the man who died? His future could have been important &quot;too&quot;. Did you check?&quot;, to which he was forced to respond: &quot;I can&#x27;t think about that right now&quot;.

The Cabinet makes an appearance in &quot;Blood Syndicate&quot; #20 when Dharma fires Oro, who has been a Syndicate associate, police officer, and a Shadow Cabinet operative. He is allowed to keep his costume and receives one month severance pay deposited directly into his bank account. Dharma even gives Oro advice to &quot;take the left&quot; as Oro teleports out.

The teleportation technology is maintained by powerful telekinetic and engineer Thomas Hague, better known as &quot;Mechanic&quot;. Another notable employee is Payback, a spy for the independent superhero Icon. Icon also has evidence that Dharma had been involved in the &#x27;Big Bang&#x27;, a riot which, due to altered tear gas, ended with dozens of fatalities and superpowers granted to the survivors.

He would not treat further departures from the Cabinet as gracefully as Oro&#x27;s. When Cabinet operatives Iota, Donner, and Blitzen leave to form the unofficial team &quot;Heroes&quot;, Dharma sends a Cabinet attack squad. This group is led by Iron Butterfly.

===DC Universe===
An all new Shadow Cabinet has appeared in the pages of &quot;Justice League of America&quot;. Following the death of Darkseid (as chronicled in &quot;Final Crisis&quot;), the space-time continuum was torn asunder, threatening the existence of both the Dakotaverse and the mainstream DC universe. The being known as Dharma was able to use energies that he harnessed from Rift (upon that being&#x27;s defeat in &quot;Worlds Collide&quot;) to merge the two universes, creating an entirely new continuity. Only Dharma, Icon and Superman are aware that Dakota and its inhabitants have actually existed in a parallel universe. In the revised continuity, the Milestone characters have apparently always existed in the DC Universe.

===Milestone Forever===
In the 2010 limited series &quot;Milestone Forever&quot;, which details the end of the original Milestone universe before its merger into the DCU, the truth behind Dharma&#x27;s actions is shown. It is revealed that he was responsible for the Big Bang, hoping to create powerful beings capable of preventing a fast-approaching apocalypse whose cause he could not determine. When his last two prospects, Hardware and Static, fail to meet his expectations, he turns to the only course he believes is left open to him; awakening and harnessing the powers of the god-like being Rift. However, the very act of absorbing the being&#x27;s powers causes widespread destruction to the universe, destroying the Milestone Earth. Thus the cause of the apocalypse he foresaw was his own attempts to stop it, although not all is lost, as his new powers allow him the opportunity to bring about his universe&#x27;s rebirth. The effects of Darkseid&#x27;s death during the &quot;Final Crisis&quot; of a neighboring universe gives him the chance to merge the remnants of the Milestone Universe into the DC Universe, retroactively combining their histories, and giving the Milestone characters the chance to live anew.

==Membership==
===Modern team===
*Bad Betty - a cyborg who was sent on a deep-cover mission to infiltrate organized crime.
*Blitzen (Valerie Kameya) - is superhumanly fast as the result of a substance she developed herself. A Japanese biochemist who is in a lesbian marriage with Donner, later joins Heroes.

*Donner (Gerri Brauer) - is superhumanly strong and resistant to injury. The German granddaughter of a Nazi geneticist, in a lesbian marriage with Blitzen, later joins Heroes.

*Sideshow (Ramon Rand) - is a photojournalist who is able to transform any part of his body into the equivalent body part of any other animal species; this enables him to recover instantly from intoxication.
*Starlight (Stella Maxwell) - is a college math major turned human pulsar with various electromagnetic abilities, later joins Heroes.
*Twilight - both a living portal into another dimension, and the man forever trapped within that dimension, Twilight resembles a silhouette of a chubby man wearing a top hat. His whole body is covered in a texture that resembles the cloudy sky. He therefore strongly resembles a walking René Magritte painting. His personal dimension is also home to a collection of peculiar supernatural creatures which he has painstakingly acquired over the years; he can, at will, release them in the hopes that they will carry out his wishes (although he has no direct control over them). At one point, other operatives entered Twilight in the hopes that Dharma would not be able to perceive them, but whether this worked is not known.
*Windshear - is capable of mentally creating whirlwinds of varying size and strength. She first appeared upon being recalled from a deep-cover mission. Windshear was later part of the Shadow Cabinet operatives ordered to destroy the Heroes.

Rainsaw can revert to a roughly humanoid form, in which he is capable of limited shapeshifting such as turning his hands into buzzsaws.
* Slag - superhumanly strong with fire manipulation abilities.
* Transit - able to teleport people and objects she touches over great distances. Transit is unusual for a teleporter since she cannot teleport herself and must rely on other means for travel.
* Wytch - she has undefined powers (her name implies they are supernatural). She was seen flying and manipulating unknown energies during their battle with the Shadow Cabinet

===DC Universe===

<doc id="923082" wikidata="Q1949495" url="?curid=923082" title="Most Precious Blood (band)">
<text>Most Precious Blood is an American hardcore punk band from New York City formed from the remnants of the band Indecision. They blend the song structures of hardcore with heavy metal, and the band cites Sick of It All, Aphex Twin, The Sisters of Mercy, and The Obsessed as influences, among others. They were signed to Trustkill Records until it dissolved in 2010. They are now with Trustkill president Josh Grabelle&#x27;s new label Bullet Tooth.

The band and its members advocated the straight edge movement, animal rights, vegetarianism and veganism. As of 2015, vocalist Rob Fusco is no longer. However, they deny being preachy in any way, saying &quot;I&#x27;m not going around trying to change people because people are going to change when they want to... if I said something that you found truth in, or that you found made sense, cool – I&#x27;m glad I was a catalyst to help you come to your own conclusions.&quot;

== History ==
Originally, the band featured former Indecision guitarists Justin Brannan and Rachel Rosen, as well as on-again off-again Indecision vocalist, Tom Sheehan. On their debut full-length for Trustkill Records, &quot;Nothing in Vain&quot; (2001), Brannan played guitar, Rosen played bass, and Sheehan did vocals.

&quot;Nothing in Vain&quot; was recorded in a 9&#x27; x 15&#x27; one room studio in an abandoned building near Sailors Snug Harbor, Staten Island. The building was once an old age home for sick and dying wayward sailors. There were odd noises that ended up on the master tapes that the band never recalled hearing during the recording. The album was engineered/produced by long-time Indecision producer Ron Thal who would later go on to play guitar for Guns N&#x27; Roses.

Original Indecision drummer Pat Flynn played drums on &quot;Nothing in Vain&quot; but left the group immediately following the completion of the record. Flynn walked out of the studio once he finished his drums tracks; the cymbals still sizzling.

The band then recruited Sean McCann. He would stay with the group for several years and would play on 2003&#x27;s &quot;Our Lady of Annihilation&quot;. McCann then left the band in the middle of the night before the band was set to fly to Arizona for a gig. When the band woke up and McCann was nowhere to be found; only a Dear John letter was left behind underneath the wiper blade of the band&#x27;s van parked outside. The band still boarded the plane and flew down to Arizona without a drummer. The band hooked up with the drummer from Where Eagles Dare, a hardcore punk outfit from Arizona, and used their drummer for the show, teaching him the songs the night before the gig.

In 2003, after Sheehan departed the band to return to school, the band teamed up with former One King Down vocalist Rob Fusco, added Matt Miller on bass, and moved Rosen to second guitar for their second album &quot;Our Lady of Annihilation&quot;. Surprise hits &quot;The Great Red Shift&quot; and &quot;Your Picture Hung Itself&quot; launched the band&#x27;s profile. The album also features a guest appearance from Sick of It All&#x27;s Lou Koller.

MPB contributed a cover of &quot;Sweet Child Of Mine&quot; to &quot;Bring You to Your Knees: A Tribute to Guns N&#x27; Roses&quot;, a cover of &quot;Rise Above&quot; to &quot;Black on Black: A Tribute to Black Flag&quot;, and a cover of &quot;Alone&quot; to &quot;Our Impact Will Be Felt: A Tribute to Sick of It All&quot; with Paul Klein (A Lifeless Alliance, Gotham Road, The Banner) filling in on drums.

MPB was the first American Hardcore band to tour South Africa. They have also been to 50+ countries, including most of Europe, as well as Brazil, Australia, New Zealand, and all over the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico.

Rachel Rosen and Justin Brannan appeared in minor roles in &quot;Threat&quot;, an independent film produced in the NYHC scene.

MPB has had 13 drummers over the history of the band. Sean McCann (2001–2003) and Colin Kercz (2004–present) are the longest serving.

=== Recent activity ===
The band has denied rumors of a breakup, claiming they have just been taking time off to relax and write a new album, after an over two-year non-stop global touring schedule.

The band has been quoted as saying they were interested in &quot;bowing out of the mass appeal madness&quot; that has struck the hardcore scene and wants nothing to do with the &quot;glossy culture&quot; anymore. The band has been finished with their fourth album, &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot;, for some time. &quot;Do Not Resuscitate&quot; was released February 1, 2011 via Bullet Tooth, formerly Trustkill Records.

<doc id="923085" wikidata="Q850593" url="?curid=923085" title="La Rambla, Barcelona">
<text>La Rambla () is considered the most well known street in central Barcelona. A tree-lined pedestrian street, it stretches for connecting the in its center with the Christopher Columbus Monument at Port Vell. La Rambla forms the boundary between the neighbourhoods of the to the east and the to the west.

La Rambla can be crowded, especially during the height of the tourist season. It hosts a combination of eateries, shops, markets, and cultural institutions. 

The Spanish poet Federico García Lorca once said that La Rambla was &quot;the only street in the world which I wish would never end.&quot;

== Orientation ==

La Rambla can be considered a series of shorter streets, each differently named, hence the plural form (the original Catalan form; in Spanish it is ). The street is successively called:
* – the site of the fountain
* – the site of the former Jesuit University, whose only remainder is the Church of Bethlehem
* (or ) – the site of an open-air flower market
* – the site of a former Capuchin monastery, now dominated by the Liceu opera-house
* – an arts center named after the convent of St. Monica.

To the north of La Rambla lies , a large square in central Barcelona that is generally considered to be both Barcelona&#x27;s city center and the place where the old city and the 19th century-built converge.

To the east of La Rambla is the or Gothic Quarter, the heart of the old city of Barcelona. The retains a labyrinthine street plan, with small squares and streets, many of which connect onto the Rambla. One of the larger of these squares is the , a lively 19th-century square with tall palm trees and street lamps designed by Antoni Gaudí, which opens down a short entrance passage off the . Further into the can be found the Cathedral of Santa Eulàlia and the that houses the buildings of the Generalitat of Catalonia and Barcelona&#x27;s City Council.

To the west of La Rambla is the rather different quarter. Outside the city&#x27;s earliest walls, this area was originally the site of various religious and medical institutions. Later factories grew up along with housing for the workers, whilst the proximity to the port led to the area becoming known for its nightlife and clubs, as well as prostitution and crime. Today the area still retains a degree of &#x27;edge&#x27;, but it also home to several important buildings, including Gaudí&#x27;s , which is only a few steps down the from the .

At the southern end of the Rambla is the Christopher Columbus Monument and the Port Vell, the old port of Barcelona, now largely given over to pleasure craft. Near to the port end of the Rambla are the Royal Dockyards (), which house a maritime museum specifically devoted to naval history in the Mediterranean.

Extensions at either end of the Rambla also carry the name Rambla, but are not normally considered part of La Rambla itself. To the north, the extends into the district. To the south, construction of the in the early 1990s resulted in a continuation of La Rambla on a wooden walkway into the harbor.

==History==

The course of La Rambla was originally a sewage-filled stream, usually dry but an important drain for the heavy rainwater flowing from the Collserola hills during spring and autumn. (, from the Arabic &#x27;sand&#x27;, is Catalan for &quot;wadi&quot;. The name of the city of Ramla in Israel is derived from the same origin). It separated the walled city on its north-east bank from the settlements of El Raval (&quot;the suburb&quot;) on its south-west.

In the year 1377, construction started on an extension of the city walls to include La Rambla and El Raval. In 1440, the stream was diverted to run outside the new walls, and La Rambla gradually started turning into a street.

Over the next few centuries, La Rambla became an established center of Barcelona&#x27;s urban life, serving as a long wide thoroughfare used for festivals, markets, and sports. Several large religious establishments were also built along the street during this period. These include the Jesuit Bethlehem monastery and college (1553), of which just the later church remains; the Carmelite St. Joseph&#x27;s monastery, on the site of the current Boqueria market; and a Capuchin monastery at the lower end of the street.
In 1703, the first of the trees lining La Rambla were planted. They were 280 birch trees and later on those were replaced by elm trees. In 1832, some acacias were planted and the currently standing plane trees started to be the common tree from 1859.

Various conflicts over recent centuries took their toll on La Rambla&#x27;s religious buildings, most notably the St. James&#x27;s Night riots in 1835, when revolutionaries burned the monasteries and churches and killed a number of friars; and the Spanish Civil War in 1936–39, when Barcelona came under the control of anarchists who again targeted religious buildings and personnel, as well as being damaged by artillery and air attacks on the area from pro-Franco forces.

Until 2010, the was the site of an open-air market for caged birds and other small pets. However animal protection laws made it difficult for the market to continue. After years of fighting the legislation, the market was forced to close.

On 17 August 2017, many people were struck by a van deliberately driven down the sidewalk on La Rambla in a terrorist attack, causing 15 deaths and at least 100 injuries.

==Sights==

The tree-lined central promenade of La Rambla is crowded during the day and until late in the night. Its origins as a watercourse are reflected in the paving design, which appears to ripple like water. Along the promenade&#x27;s length are kiosks that sell newspapers and souvenirs, other kiosks selling flowers, street traders, performers, and pavement cafes and bars. Several notable sights are also located within the promenade, including a mosaic by Joan Miró and the , a fountain and popular meeting point.

Along the Rambla are historic buildings such as the Palace of the Virreina and the Theater (), in which operas and ballets are staged. The market opens off the Rambla and is one of the city&#x27;s foremost tourist landmarks, housing a very diverse selection of goods.

One of the side streets, which is only a few meters long, leads to the Royal Square (), a plaza with palm trees and porticoed buildings containing many pubs and restaurants, and where stamp and coin collectors gather on the weekends.

== Culture ==

The Rambla is the location for several of Barcelona&#x27;s cultural establishments, including:
* the , or simply , is Barcelona&#x27;s opera house, opened in 1847.
* the , is the oldest theater in Barcelona, founded in 1568, and subsequently rebuilt several times since.
* the is a public museum of contemporary art located on the Raval side of , with regular exhibitions of international artists.
* the , a Baroque palace, hosts museum exhibitions and cultural events.

In the is a 1971 pavement mosaic by Joan Miró.

== Transport ==

The most obvious transport mode on La Rambla is its heavy flow of pedestrians, who largely use the wide central pedestrianized area. This is flanked by two narrow service roads, which in turn are flanked by narrow pedestrian walkways in front of the buildings. Despite its length, no vehicular traffic is permitted to cross the central pedestrian walkway.

Line L3 of the Barcelona Metro runs beneath the length of La Rambla, with stations at:

* , immediately adjacent to , is a major interchange station served by several metro and suburban railway lines.
* , in front of the opera house , serves the central section of La Rambla. 
* is by the port next to .

Three Barcelona Bus lines operate along the service roads flanking La Rambla during the day (numbers 14, 59 and 91), whilst three different night time services also operate along La Rambla (numbers N9, N12 and N15).

== Redevelopment ==
In 2017 the city of Barcelona approved a plan to redevelop the famous street giving it a new image and function. Construction for the redevelopment is slated to begin in late 2022. The redevelopment budget is approximately €45 million and will be carried out in stages. More space will be made for pedestrians by reducing the number of car lanes. Traffic will also be restricted to use only by service vehicle and people who live in the area. The general idea is to create a &quot;green space&quot; that will be more welcoming to locals and tourists alike.

<text>The Snaefell Mountain Railway is an electric mountain railway on the Isle of Man in Europe. It joins the village of Laxey with the summit of Snaefell, at above sea level the highest point on the island. It connects with the Manx Electric Railway (MER) in Laxey. The line is long, is built to gauge and uses a Fell Incline Railway System centre rail for braking on the steep gradients. It is electrified using overhead wires at 550 volts direct current, with bow collectors.

==Operation==

The railway operates from March to early November, taking 30 minutes for a one-way journey. In winter the overhead wires on the exposed upper part of the route are dismantled to avoid damage from icing. All passenger traffic is carried in five wooden-bodied electric railcars, built in 1895 and numbered 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6. Car 3 was destroyed in 2016. Car 5 was burned out in an accident in 1970 and its body is a replacement built in 1971 to a similar design. The cars were re-equipped in the late 1970s with new bogies to a design based on the original, using motors and traction equipment from withdrawn Aachen built by Waggonfabrik Talbot in 1956. Because of the different gauge and the centre rail, vehicles cannot inter-run between the railway and the gauge MER. Railway vehicles are occasionally worked to the MER workshops at Douglas by swapping their bogies, and to aid this there is a dual gauge siding in Laxey. The railway is owned and operated by Isle of Man Heritage Railways, a department of the Isle of Man Government.

==History==

The line was originally surveyed by George Noble Fell, the son of John Barraclough Fell who invented the Fell system. This survey was for a steam-operated railway using the Fell centre rail for both propulsion and braking, and the scheme was approved by Tynwald in 1888 but not built. In 1895 the Snaefell Mountain Railway Association (SMRA) revived the plans, and adopted the route of the earlier survey. As the line was built entirely on land leased by the association there was no need for statutory powers, and the line was constructed very quickly and opened on 20 August 1895 (during construction the line was laid as a mixed gauge route of both 3&#x27; and 3&#x27;6&quot;; the line was built using the six coupled Manx Northern Railway 4/IMR15 Caledonia; the 3&#x27; third rail was temporarily reinstated for the centenary to allow Caledonia, now fitted with a hydraulic Fell brake, to return to the mountain propelling an MER saloon coach. The line was built from scratch as an electric railway without Fell traction equipment, relying on normal rail adhesion for propulsion up the steep gradients; however the cars are fitted with Fell braking equipment for use when descending.

In December 1895, the SMRA sold the line to the Isle of Man Tramways &amp; Electric Power Co. Ltd (IoMT&amp;EP), which owned the MER. Doubt was thrown on this transaction retrospectively after the later collapse of the IoMT&amp;EP, when it was revealed that the SMRA was unregistered, and that most of the directors of the IoMT&amp;EP were also members of the SMRA and had voted on the acquisition in contravention of that company&#x27;s articles of association. The IoMT&amp;EP went into liquidation in 1900 as a consequence of a banking collapse. The railway and the MER were sold by the liquidator to the newly-formed Manx Electric Railway Co. Ltd, which took over in 1902. By the late 1950s the company was in financial difficulties as well, and it was acquired by the Isle of Man Government in 1957.

==Stations==
The main railway station on the line is the interchange with the Manx Electric Railway at Laxey; the only intermediate stopping place on the line is at the Bungalow, at the mid-way position where the line crosses the Mountain Road (A18), part of the Snaefell Mountain Course used in the TT races. During race periods, trams terminate on either side of the road and passengers cross over a footbridge.

Above Laxey station there is a spur leading to the depot where all the rolling stock is housed and maintained; this complex was completely rebuilt in the winter of 1994-95 and officially opened in readiness for the railway&#x27;s centenary. Also in the depot is a smaller shed which houses the Air Ministry railcars used to access masts at the summit during the winter months, when the overhead lines are removed from the top section of the line to prevent frost damage.

==Rolling stock==

===Passenger===

The railway operates with five of the original six identical tramcars, all built in 1895 by George F. Milnes &amp; Co., and delivered in time for the line&#x27;s opening that year. Of note is Car No. 5 which was severely damaged by a fire on 16 August 1970 and subsequently rebuilt locally, re-entering service in 1971. It was distinguished by having modern aluminium-framed &quot;bus&quot; type windows, but these were removed and wooden sliding ones refitted during a subsequent rebuild in 2003, when the tram became the first to carry the railway&#x27;s name in Manx along its side.

The current livery has been standard for over a century, save for a period upon nationalisation in 1957 when certain cars carried an unpopular green and white scheme. The original livery used until 1899 was a cream and Prussian blue scheme featuring &quot;tramway&quot; wording (rather than &quot;railway&quot; which has since been favoured). With the extensive rebuild of Car No. 1 commencing in 2011, this car was chosen to revert to the original colour scheme, complete with original wording. This was the first time a markedly different livery has been carried by any of the cars since the abolition of the short-lived nationalisation (green and white) colour scheme in 1962.

Until the addition of dynamic braking equipment on car roofs in 1970, knifeboard adverts were carried on the roof tops. Car No. 3 was totally destroyed in an incident on 30 March 2016, when it ran away from Summit station and subsequently derailed. The salvageable remains of the vehicle have been stored at the engineering works of the Manx Electric Railway, where it is expected that the car will eventually be rebuilt.


===Non-passenger car===

The seventh car built by the railway was a non-passenger car supplied at opening in 1895. It was based largely upon the passenger cars, but without seated closed accommodation. Numbered 7 in sequence with the other stock and nicknamed &quot;Maria&quot;, it was used to convey coal from Laxey to the power station near the Bungalow, and traditionally borrowed traction bogies from other passenger vehicles as required. It latterly saw many years at the works depôt mounted on barrels until it became completely rotten and beyond saving. A replica was built in 1994 to take part in the International Railway Festival celebrating the line&#x27;s centenary. This saw limited use on the line; later it was converted for use on the Manx Electric Railway and re-gauged to . It is now re-numbered as Car No. 34 on the &quot;low road&quot; (a colloquial name for the MER to differentiate it from the mountain line). It features a mounted diesel generator for self-propulsion when the overhead wires are down.


===National Air Traffic Services===

There have been four different railcars on the line, all Wickham trolleys, starting with Air Ministry No. 1 which arrived in Air Force Blue livery, but was repainted into yellow and black (Civil Aviation Authority colours) in the 1960s; it has since been sold to a private owner and shipped to the UK in June 2007 for restoration. The second car also arrived in Air Force Blue livery, and was likewise repainted into yellow and black in the 1960s. The third trolley (built 1977) remains in service. The newest, No. 4, is currently in use by National Air Traffic Services (the successor of the Air Ministry and Civil Aviation Authority). The vehicles are used by crews travelling to maintain the aerial masts at the top of Snaefell mountain.

===Other===
The railway also has a four-wheeled wagon used to carry supplies to the summit railway station, which has no road access; the wagon is ordinarily propelled in front of the first morning car which delivers the staff to the summit, and remains at the summit during the operational day, returning behind the last tram. It is occasionally used on service cars as part of special events, primarily for photographic purposes.

==Incidents==

During the construction of the line in 1895, the steam locomotive &quot;Caledonia&quot; was being used to transport sleepers and rails up the line. Heading up the hill from Dumbell&#x27;s Row, the locomotive began to slip about 20 metres up the hill, crashing through a bakery and into a greengrocers shop, causing significant damage to both properties. Both property owners and drivers were unhurt.

On Monday, 27 July 2009, a vehicle carrying a mechanical excavator came into contact with wires supplying traction power to the Snaefell Mountain Railway and the Manx Electric Railway at a crossing in Laxey, according to portal site Manx.net. There were no injuries. Police and MER electrical engineering crews were at the scene of the incident, the report also said. It did not indicate what damage had occurred as a result of the incident. Service resumed the next day after temporary repairs to the overhead lines, which were permanently repaired over the next couple of weeks.

On 30 March 2016, the unoccupied Snaefell Mountain Railway Car No.3 suffered a runaway from the Summit and derailed just north of Bungalow Station. No injuries were reported, but the 121-year old tramcar was totally destroyed in the incident. 30 passengers were left stranded at the Summit for a short time.

On 4 August 2017, the Snaefell Mountain Railway Car No. 2 suffered brake failure on the descent from the Snaefell Summit terminus to the Bungalow. The Isle of Man Director of Public Transport, Ian Longworth, stated that the tram had sustained a loss of rheostatic braking due to an interruption in the overhead electricity supply which occurred when the bow current collector momentarily lost contact with the overhead wire. In this incident the crew attempted to apply the emergency Fell-rail brake but were initially hampered in their attempts by a gap in the Fell-rail at a road crossing near the Bungalow railway station. The crew were eventually able to stop the vehicle after the recommencement of the Fell-rail section. Following the incident, the speed limit on the line was reduced from to . However, on 10 August, the Health and Safety at Work Inspectorate banned trams from operating following reports that trams were not adhering to the new speed limit. Services resumed on 30 March 2018 after modifications to the braking systems.

<doc id="923091" wikidata="Q13687" url="?curid=923091" title="Enna">
<text>Enna ( ; ; , less frequently ), known from the Middle Ages until 1926 as Castrogiovanni ( ), is a city and located roughly at the center of Sicily, southern Italy, in the province of Enna, towering above the surrounding countryside. It has earned the nicknames (panoramic viewpoint) and (&quot;navel&quot;) of Sicily.

At above sea level, Enna is the highest Italian provincial capital.

==History==
Enna is situated near the center of the island; whence the Roman writer Cicero called it &quot;Mediterranea maxime&quot;, reporting that it was within a day&#x27;s journey of the nearest point on all the three coasts. The peculiar situation of Enna is described by several ancient authors, and is one of the most remarkable in Sicily. The ancient city was placed on the level summit of a gigantic hill, surrounded on all sides with precipitous cliffs almost wholly inaccessible. The few paths were easily defended, and the city was abundantly supplied with water which gushes from the face of the rocks on all sides. With a plain or tableland of about in circumference on the summit, it formed one of the strongest natural fortresses in the world.

===Prehistoric===
Archaeological excavations have revealed artifacts dating from the 14th century BC, proving human presence in the area since Neolithic times. A settlement from before the 11th century BC, assigned by some to the Sicanians, has been identified at the top of the hill; later it was a center of the Sicels.

In historical times, Enna became renowned in Sicily and Italy for the cult of the goddess Demeter (the Roman Ceres). Her grove was known as the &quot;umbilicus Siciliae&quot; (&quot;The navel of Sicily&quot;). Ceres&#x27; temple in Henna was a famed site of worship.

The origin of the toponym &quot;Henna&quot; remains obscure.

===Classical period===

Dionysius I of Syracuse repeatedly attempted to take over Enna. At first he encouraged Aeimnestus, a citizen of Enna, to seize the sovereign power. Afterward Dionysius I turned against him and assisted the Ennaeans to get rid of their despot. But it was not till a later period that, after repeated expeditions against the neighbouring Sicilian cities, Dionysius took control of the city by betrayal in 397 BC.

Agathocles later controlled Enna. When the Agrigentines under Xenodicus began to proclaim the restoration of the other cities of Sicily to freedom, the Ennaeans were the first to join their standard, and opened their gates to Xenodicus, 309 BC. Accounts of the First Punic War repeatedly refer to Enna; it was taken first by the Carthaginians under Hamilcar, and subsequently recaptured by the Romans, but in both instances by treachery and not by force.

In the Second Punic War, while Marcellus was engaged in the siege of Syracuse (214 BC), Enna became the scene of a fearful massacre. The defection of several Sicilian towns from Rome had alarmed Pinarius the governor of Enna. In order to forestall any treachery, he used the Roman garrison to kill the citizens, whom he had gathered in the theater, and killed them all. The soldiers were allowed to plunder the city.

Eighty years later Enna was the center of the First Servile War in Sicily (134 BC - 132 BC), which erupted under the lead of Eunus, a former slave. His forces took over Enna. It was the last place that held out against the proconsul Rupilius, and was at length betrayed into his hands. According to Strabo, the city suffered much damage after the Romans regained control. He believed this was the start of its decline.

Cicero referred to it repeatedly in a way to suggest that it was still a flourishing municipal town: it had a fertile territory, well-adapted for the growth of cereal grains, and was diligently cultivated till it was rendered almost desolate by the exactions of Verres. From this time little is known about Enna: Strabo speaks of it as still inhabited in his time, though by a small population. The name of Enna appears in Pliny among the municipal towns of Sicily, as well as in Ptolemy and the &quot;Itineraries&quot;.

When the Roman Empire was divided in 395 AD, Sicily became part of the Western Roman Empire. The noted senatorial family of the Nicomachi had estates in Sicily. Around 408 AD the politician and grammarian Nicomachus Flavianus worked on an edition of the first 10 books of Livy during a stay on his estate in Enna. This was recorded in the subscriptions of the manuscripts of Livy.

===Middle Ages===
After the fall of the Western Roman Empire, Enna flourished throughout the Middle Ages as an important Byzantine stronghold. In 859, in the course of the Islamic conquest of Sicily, after several attempts and a long siege, the town was taken by Muslim troops, who entered one by one through a sewer to breach the town&#x27;s defenses. Afterwards, 8,000 residents of the city were massacred by Muslim forces. The Arabic name for the city, &quot;Qaṣr Yānih&quot; (, &quot;Fort of John&quot;), was a combination of &quot;qaṣr&quot; (a corruption of the Latin &quot;castrum&quot;, &quot;fortress&quot;), and a corruption of &quot;Henna&quot;. The city retained its name in the local dialect of Sicilian as &quot;Castru Janni&quot; (Italianized as &quot;Castrogiovanni&quot;), until Benito Mussolini ordered renaming in 1927.

The Normans captured Enna in 1087. Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Sicily, established a summer residence here, which is now called the &quot;Torre di Federico&quot; (&quot;Frederick Tower&quot;). Troops of North Italian soldiers, from regions such as Lombardy, Piedmont, Liguria and Emilia-Romagna, came to settle in the city and neighbouring towns such as Nicosia and Piazza Armerina. Gallo-Italic dialects are still spoken in these areas, dating from this early occupation.

Enna had a prominent role in the Sicilian Vespers and the ensuing War of the Sicilian Vespers. Forced to retreat to the Sicilian interior in during the Angevin invasion of 1299, King Frederick III of Sicily chose the highly defensible Enna as his headquarters. The city blocked the Angevins from advancing into central Sicily, and an Angevin army attempting to advance on the city was defeated at the Battle of Gagliano in 1300.

Frederick III favored the city, embellishing it with honors, and following the vespers era Enna enjoyed a short communal autonomy. However, it suffered a period of decay under the later Spanish domination.

=== Modern ===
Enna was restored as provincial capital in the 1920s. In 2002 it became a university city.

The citizens of the city have a high incidence of multiple sclerosis (MS). MS is also prevalent in Sardinia, which has the second highest incidence in the Mediterranean basin.

==Classical mythology==
The neighborhood of Enna is celebrated in myth as the place whence Persephone (Latin: Proserpine) was carried off by Pluto, god of the underworld. The spot assigned by local tradition as the scene of this event was a small lake surrounded by lofty and precipitous hills, about 8 km from Enna. The meadows abound in flowers, and a nearby cavern or grotto was believed to be where the king suddenly emerged. This lake is called &quot;Pergus&quot; by Ovid and Claudian. Neither Cicero nor Diodorus refers to any lake in relation to this myth. The former says that around Enna were &quot;lacus lucique plurimi, et laetissimi flores omni tempore anni&quot; (&quot;very many lakes and groves, and very delightful flowers at every time of year&quot;). Diodorus describes the spot whence Persephone was carried off as a meadow so full of fragrant flowers that hounds could not follow their prey. He described the meadow as enclosed on all sides by steep cliffs, and having groves and marshes in the neighborhood, but does not refer to a lake. Both he and Cicero allude to a cavern, as if describing a definite site. In the 21st century, a small lake was found in a basin-shaped hollow surrounded by great hills, and a cavern near is noted as that described by Cicero and Diodorus. But much of the flowers and trees had disappeared by the 19th century, when travelers described the area as bare and desolate.

Both Ceres and Persephone were worshipped in Enna. Cicero said that the temple of Ceres was of such great antiquity and sanctity that Sicilians went there filled with religious awe. Verres looted from it a bronze image of the deity, the most ancient as well as the most venerated in Sicily. No remains of this temple are now visible. Standing on the brink of the precipice, it fell with a great rockfall from the edge of the cliff. Other remnants of classical antiquity were likely destroyed by the Saracens, who erected the castle and several other of the most prominent buildings of the modern city.

==Ancient name Henna==
Coins minted for Enna under the Roman dominion still exist, carrying the legend &quot;MUN. (Municipium) HENNA&quot;. The aspirated form of the name confirms the authority of Cicero, whose manuscripts give that form. The most ancient Greek coin of the city also gives the name &quot;ΗΕΝΝΑΙΟΝ&quot;. Scholars have concluded that this form, Henna, of the ancient name is the more correct for its time, though Enna is the more usual.

==University, culture and education==
Enna is now an important center for archaeological and educational studies. The Kore University of Enna was officially founded in 2002.

==Main sights==

The most important monuments of Enna are:

*Lombardy Castle (&quot;Castello di Lombardìa&quot;): an important instance of military architecture in Sicily. The Castle was built by Sicanians, rebuilt by Frederick II of Sicily, and restructured under Frederick II of Aragon. The castle is named for the garrison of Lombard troops that defended it in the Norman era. It has an irregular layout which once comprised 20 towers. Of the six remaining, the &quot;Torre Pisana&quot; is the best preserved and has Guelph merlons. The castle was divided into three spaces separated by walls. The first courtyard is the site of an outdoor lyric theater. The second houses a large green park. The third includes vestiges of royal apartments, a bishop&#x27;s chapel, medieval prisons, and the &quot;Pisan Tower&quot;.
*: was built in the 14th century by queen Eleanor of Anjou, the wife of Frederick II of Aragon. It was renovated and remodeled after a fire that occurred in 1446. The great Baroque facade, in yellow tufa-stone, is surmounted by a massive campanile with finely shaped decorative elements. The portal on the right side is from the 16th century, while the other is from the original 14th-century edifice. The interior has a nave with two aisles, separated by massive Corinthian columns, and three apses. The stucco decoration is from the 16th and 17th centuries. Art works include a 15th-century crucifix panel painting, a canvas by Guglielmo Borremans, presbytery paintings by Filippo Paladini (1613), and a Baroque side portal. The cathedral&#x27;s treasure is housed in the Alessi Museum, and includes precious ornaments, the gold crown with diamonds known as the &quot;Crown of the Virgin,&quot; Byzantine icons, thousands of ancient coins, and other collections.
*&quot;Palazzo Varisano&quot; was adapted to house the Regional Archaeological Museum of Enna. It has material dating from the Copper Age to the 6th century AD, recovered from many archaeological areas in the Province of Enna.
*&quot;Torre di Federico&quot;, is an octagonal ancient tower that was allegedly a summer residence of Frederick II of Hohenstaufen. The two floors possess beautiful vaults. The aspect of the building is austere. It was part of a bigger complex, named &quot;Old castle&quot; and destroyed by Arabs. Remnants include some pieces of the old, imposing walls on the top of the green hill where the Tower rises.

*&quot;Campanile&quot; of the destroyed church of San Giovanni, features pointed arches with finely shaped archivolts, and a three-light mullioned window with Catalan-style decorations.
*The Municipal Library is located in the &quot;San Francesco&quot; building, a former church. It has a notable 15th-century campanile and, in the interior, a fine painted Cross from the same century.
*&quot;San Tommaso&quot;: church has a 15th-century belfry, with three orders. It has windows framed by an agile full-centered archivolt. The church contains a marble icon (1515) attributed to Giuliano Mancino and precious frescoes by Borremans.
*&quot;Janniscuru Gate&quot; is the only one preserved of the seven gates that once gave entrance through the town wall. It is a fine 17th-century Roman arch, positioned in an area of rock grottoes under the ancient, traditional quarter of Fundrisi. These grottoes were used as a necropolis by ancient peoples thousands of years ago.
*&quot;Santissimi Salvatore&quot;: church
*&quot;Anime Sante&quot; church
*&quot;Spirito Santo&quot;
*&quot;Maria SS. Del Carmelo&quot;
*&quot;San Biagio&quot;

*&quot;San Bartolomeo&quot;
*&quot;San Francesco&quot;
*&quot;San Giuseppe church and convent&quot;
*&quot;San Leonardo&quot;
*&quot;Santa Chiara&quot; church
*&quot;Santa Maria del Popolo&quot;

*&quot;Sant’Anna&quot;
*&quot;Santa Maria del Gesù&quot; church and convent
*&quot;Maria SS. di Valverde&quot; church

===Pergusa lake and archaeologic site===

Lake Pergusa (Latin: &quot;Pergus lacus&quot; or &quot;Hennaeus lacus&quot;) lies between a group of mountains in the chain of Erei, about 5 km from Enna. It is part of an important migratory flyway for many species of birds. The Pergusa nature reserve also has numerous species of mammals, reptiles, amphibians and invertebrates.

Around the lake is the most important racing track of Southern Italy, the Autodromo di Pergusa. It has hosted international competitions and events, such as Formula One, Formula 3000, and a Ferrari Festival featuring Michael Schumacher.

Near Pergusa lake is the archaeological site known as &quot;Cozzo Matrice.&quot; These are the remains of an ancient prehistoric fortified village, with walls dating about 8000 BC. Other remains, dating to more than 2000 years ago, are a sacred citadel, a rich necropolis, and the remains of an ancient temple dedicated to Demeter.

Pergusa is strongly linked to the myth of the Greek Persephone, Demeter&#x27;s daughter, who was kidnapped from here by Pluto and taken to Hades, the underworld, for part of the year. From that captivity, seasons arose. The important forest and green area named &quot;Selva Pergusina&quot; (meaning Pergusa&#x27;s Wood) surrounds a part of the Lake Pergusa Valley.

<text>Dongzhimen () was a gate in the old Beijing city fortifications. It is now a commercial center and transportation node in Beijing. 

==History==
The Marquis of Extended Grace lived near Dongzhimen.

==Transport==
The 2nd Ring Road currently links with two roads which eventually become the Airport Expressway and China National Highway 101. A new flyover, and a new express road connects directly with the Airport Expressway.

The Beijing subway network has a interchange station at Dongzhimen, where Lines 2, 13 and Capital Airport Express connect. Line 13 has its eastern terminus at Dongzhimen.

Dongzhimen also has an extensive public bus hub just outside the Dongzhimen station. Buses numbered greater than 800 start from a long-distance bus station area, which serves a wide range of locations inside and outside of Beijing. This includes special buses to the Great Wall and long-distance buses to the mountains and caves north of Beijing and smaller suburban districts such as Pinggu.

==Ghost Street==
West of Dongzhimen is Guijie (簋街), or &quot;Food Vessel street&quot; (Dongzhimen Inner Street). The character for Gui (簋) refers to a round-mouthed bamboo basket for food. The name is frequently mistaken for a similar-sounding word, meaning &quot;ghost&quot;, so some refer to the street as &quot;Ghost street&quot;. The street stretches for over one kilometer, and 90% of the commercial shops in the street house more than 150 eateries.

==Nearby areas==
Connecting to the east of Dongzhimen is Dongzhimen Outer Street, which connects with the Northern Diplomatic Area and ultimately to the 3rd Ring Road as well as the National Agricultural Exhibition Hall.

1.5 km from Dongzhimen lies the nearby Sanlitun (三里屯) bar street, commonly frequented by the expat community located in the heart of Beijing&#x27;s North Diplomatic Area.

<text>Chaoyangmen (; Manchu:; Möllendorff:šun be aliha duka) was a gate in the former city wall of Beijing. It is now a transportation node and a district border in Beijing. It is located in the Dongcheng District of northeastern central Beijing. Running from north to south is the eastern 2nd Ring Road. The Beijing Subway (Line 6 and Line 2) has a stop at Chaoyangmen.

==History==
The Chaoyang Gate (the Gate Facing the Sun) was the main gate of the East City. The gate was demolished, along with the walls and moat of the East City in the 1950s and replaced with the 2nd Ring Road (Beijing) where the moat and walls had been, and an elevated roundabout-bridge where the gate had been.

==Chaoyangmen today==
West of Chaoyangmen Bridge is Chaoyangmen Inner Street (Chaoyangmen Nei Dajie), which heads toward the Wangfujing, Dongdan and Dongsi areas. The first building north west of Chaoyangmen Bridge is the headquarters of CNOOC Group. The second building westwards is Beijing&#x27;s most famous &quot;haunted houses&quot;, two French-style villas at 81 Chaoyangmen Nei. The main villa was formerly the residence of the French manager of the Pinghan Railway Company until 1947, thereafter it became the offices of various government works until closed pending demolition in the 1990s. However, due to the architectural value of the two villas they were preserved and passed to the Beijing Diocese of the Catholic Church for restoration and use as a church.

East of Chaoyangmen Bridge is where Chaoyang District begins. Chaoyangmen Outer Street also begins east of the overpass, leading to the Chaowai area. The first building north east of the Chaoyangmen Bridge and exit of Chaoyangmen Station is the headquarters of Sinopec Group. Further along Chaoyangmen-wai is the Zhihua Si Temple, a Buddhist temple constructed during the Ming Dynasty. China&#x27;s Foreign Ministry building is situated to the southeastern part of the overpass bridge and roundabout.

<doc id="923102" wikidata="Q965130" url="?curid=923102" title="Falconbridge Nickel Mines">
<text>Falconbridge Nickel Mines Limited was a Canadian mining company with operations in 18 countries, involved in the exploration, mining, processing, and marketing of metal and mineral products, including nickel, copper, cobalt, and platinum. In 1982 the company was renamed Falconbridge Limited. It was listed on the TSX (under the symbol FAL.LV) and NYSE (FAL), and had revenue of US$6.9 billion in 2005. In August 2006, it was absorbed by Swiss-based mining company Xstrata, which had formerly been a major shareholder. On 28 October 2007, Falconbridge Limited changed its name to the Xstrata Canada Corporation.

Falconbridge, named after the town Falconbridge, which in turn was named for a prominent &quot;son&quot;, one Sir William Glenholme Falconbridge, High Court Judge whose father John Kennedy Falconbridge, had migrated to Ontario from Lisburn Ireland.

Falconbridge is important to the economic and commercial development of the northern region of Ontario Canada, particularly the communities in and around Sudbury.

==History==
In 1928, an experienced prospector and businessman Thayer Lindsley purchased mining claims containing rich deposits of nickel-copper ore in the area northeast of Sudbury. These claims had been established as early as 1901, when Thomas Edison made the original discovery of the Falconbridge ore body, but remained undeveloped until Lindsley&#x27;s purchase. Soon thereafter, planning and construction of a company town began, to house and service workers for the future mines. The community, complete with utilities and a medical centre, was named Falconbridge after the geographic township in which it was located. Likewise, the company became known as Falconbridge Nickel Mines Limited.

Just one year later in 1929, the new company acquired the Kristiansand Nikkelraffineringsverk A/S refinery in Kristiansand, Norway. This expanded its operations, but more importantly the company also gained the rights to the Hybinette nickel refining process.

The operations at the Falconbridge site expanded in the early 1930s. By 1930 ore from an underground mine was being extracted at 250 tonnes per day, and a nearby smelter was in operation to process the material. In 1932, a mill and sintering facility began operation.

Through the 1950s and 1960s, significant expansion of the Sudbury Basin operations took place, including some twelve new mines. All recovered nickel, copper, and smaller amounts of other materials including platinides. Meanwhile, the Nikkelverk operation began recovering cobalt alongside previous extractions in 1952, using a new refining process. In 1962, Falconbridge acquired Ventures Limited, including its numerous international operations and geological exploration infrastructure, allowing further expansion and growth outside of Canada.

In 1971 the Falconbridge Dominicana (Falcondo) mine and process plant commenced operation in Bonao, Dominican Republic. The site employed a novel reduction and smelting technique superior to the kiln process. To aid in community development, the Falcondo Foundation was established in 1989 and has been a pioneer in Natural Resource Corporate Social Responsibility.

In 1977, Falconbridge patented the chlorine leach nickel refining process that had been developed in-house.

The late 1970s saw the company play a role, alongside Inco, in the environmental reclamation efforts undertaken in the Sudbury region. As part of this, a new, more efficient smelter was opened, as well as a facility for the production of sulfuric acid. This commercially saleable chemical had been a source of significant ecological damage when it was produced in the atmosphere by the reaction of sulfur dioxide emissions. The new acid plant allowed this effect to be greatly reduced by catalyzing the reaction before emission, while producing additional revenue from the sale of the acid.

By 1984, the commercial reserves at the original Falconbridge Mine had been exhausted. Production continued at several other sites in the Sudbury area. The company expanded within northern Ontario by acquiring the Kidd Mine and Kidd Metallurgical Site (Met Site) in Timmins, Ontario. Expansion continued in the 1990s, with a new mine in Sudbury, and one at Raglan in northern Quebec, though Falconbridge lost the bidding war with Inco for the deposit at Voisey&#x27;s Bay. The new century saw more acquisitions, including the Montcalm mine in Timmins, the Kabanga project in Tanzania, and the Lomas Bayas mine in Chile.

Noranda proposed a merger to Falconbridge in March 2005.

In June 2005 Falconbridge merged with Noranda, previously the 58.4% owner, continuing under the name Falconbridge Limited. Noranda brought significant variety to the business, including operations in aluminum mining and recycling of electronic hardware.

In August 2005 Brascan Limited sold its 20% share in Falconbridge to Xstrata.

==Operations as of 2006==
At the time of the Xstrata takeover, Falconbridge had major operations in and around the Sudbury Basin, including the Craig, Fraser, and Thayer Lindsley underground copper/nickel mines, as well as a mill (Strathcona), nickel smelter, sulfuric acid plant, and a technology centre. In 2005, Falconbridge had started the Deposit Definition phase of the Nickel Rim South mine near the Sudbury Airport.

Metal refining was no longer carried out in Sudbury by Falconbridge, but rather at its Falconbridge Nikkelverk operation in Kristiansand.

Another Canadian operation was the Kidd Mine and Kidd Metallurgical Site in Timmins, Ontario which includes an underground copper/zinc mine, concentrator, copper smelter and copper refinery, zinc plant, indium plant, cadmium plant, and sulfuric acid plants. Falconbridge also operated the Montcalm underground nickel mine west of Timmins. Other sites were located in Quebec, Ontario (Rouyn-Noranda: Horne copper smelter, Montreal: CCR copper refinery, Salaberry-de-Valleyfield: CEZ zinc refinery, Nunavik: Raglan underground nickel/copper mine and mill) and Bathurst, New Brunswick (Brunswick underground zinc/lead mine, lead smelter and lead refinery, and silver refinery).

Copper and precious metal recycling facilities were at Brampton, Ontario; East Providence, Rhode Island; La Vergne, Tennessee; Roseville, California; San Jose, California; and Penang, Malaysia.

Falconbridge Ltd. also operated an aluminium smelter in New Madrid, Missouri and an alumina refinery in Gramercy, Louisiana. The aluminum produced from these mills was prepared in one of four rolling mills located in Huntingdon, Tennessee (2 mills); Salisbury, North Carolina (1 mill); and Newport, Arkansas (1 mill).

Central American and Caribbean projects included the St. Ann bauxite mine in Discovery Bay, Jamaica and the Falcondo nickel surface mine and processing plant in Bonao, Dominican Republic.

South American properties were mainly copper deposits such as the Antamina copper/zinc open-pit mine in northern Peru, the Collahuasi copper/molybdenum open-pit mine (including mill, liquid–liquid extraction plant, and electrowinning plant) in northern Chile, the Lomas Bayas open-pit copper mine (including liquid–liquid extraction plant and electrowinning plant), and the Altonorte copper smelter also in northern Chile.

Falconbridge also owned a Boeing 737-200 (registration C-FFAL). The aircraft is based in Toronto at Pearson International Airport. The aircraft was repainted with Xstrata livery following the takeover, and still operates.

==Merger efforts and acquisition==

In 1996, as part of a strategic initiative - growth study, internally commissioned during the struggle between INCO and Falconbridge over acquiring Voisey&#x27;s Bay, a plan and proposal came forth for Falconbridge to abandon its attempt to acquire the property in Labrador and redirect its efforts and financial capacity at acquiring INCO itself. The strategic plan was presented to and declined by Falconbridge majority owners at the time, Noranda (and their majority owner - Brascan).

On 11 October 2005, Inco announced a proposal to acquire Falconbridge for $12 billion. This came at a time of especially high prices for base metals, including nickel. Part of the motivation for the merger was to avoid a takeover of either company by cash-flushed foreign competitors. Additionally, significant synergies would have been realized in the Sudbury operations in Project Pentlandite, with both companies performing the same kind of extraction and smelting work on the same kind of ore.

The two companies were set upon by hostile takeover bids from rival firms. Swiss Xstrata, already 19.9% owner of Falconbridge through its purchase of Brascan&#x27;s share, bid for a complete acquisition, while Teck Cominco of Vancouver set its sights on Inco.

On 13 May 2006, Inco announced that it increased its offer to acquire Falconbridge by $5.00 CAD per share, bringing the bid to $61.04 CAD per share (based on 23 June 2006 Inco/Phelps Dodge share price).

On 26 June 2006, Phelps Dodge made a bid for the proposed combined Inco/Falconbridge company, valued at around US$40 billion. This would have formed the Phelps Dodge Inco Corp., valued at US$56 billion, creating the fifth largest mining company, largest nickel producer, and the second largest copper producer in the world with corporate and copper division headquarters located in Phoenix, Arizona and nickel division headquarters in Toronto, Ontario. The deadline for the Inco offer was 13 July 2006.

On 18 May 2006, Xstrata had announced a proposal to acquire Falconbridge for $52.50 CAD per share. This was a cash offer, unlike the Inco offer of a combination of cash and shares. On 12 July 2006, Xstrata announced that it increased its offer to acquire Falconbridge to $59.00 CAD per share (an approximate total value of $22.5 billion CAD). This counter-offer was 9.6% higher than Inco&#x27;s bid. The deadline for Xstrata&#x27;s bid to be complete was 21 July 2006. Xstrata acquired and absorbed Falconbridge in late August 2006, leaving Inco open to bids by Phelps Dodge and the Brazilian company CVRD. Falconbridge became Xstrata Nickel, which continued to be based in Toronto.

In August 2007 the Koniambo mine project was headed by Falconbridge Limited. CEO Aaron Regent was in talks with China Minmetals and China Development Bank about them investing in the form of debt rather than equity.

On 2 May 2013 Glencore completed the merger with Xstrata.

==Social impact in Sudbury==
Falconbridge lent its name to a company town northeast of Sudbury which grew to be a community in its own right. The town of Falconbridge was incorporated by the provincial government in 1957. It was organized along with several other communities into the Town of Nickel Centre and Regional Municipality of Sudbury in 1973; the regional municipality was in turn amalgamated into today&#x27;s city of Greater Sudbury in 2001.

Some Falconbridge workers also lived in the nearby community of Happy Valley, which was abandoned in the 1960s due to pollution from the Falconbridge smelter.

&quot;Falco&quot;, as it was often called by Sudbury residents, remained for decades the second-largest employer in the Sudbury area, exceeded only by rival mining giant Inco. The economic fortune of the city was tied to those of the mining companies, as a strike at either company had a major effect on the livelihood of thousands of workers. The effect diminished as economic diversification progressed in the 1980s and 1990s.

Citizens, particularly workers and their families, came to develop an attachment to what were seen as local companies with significant size and influence in the mining industry. In particular, a certain degree of rivalry between workers at the two mining giants, who were members of rival labour unions, developed. In the 1950s and early 1960s, factional wars between the competing unions sometimes led to riots in the streets of Sudbury.

A proposal to merge Inco and Falconbridge in 2006 was headed with the slogan &quot;Two proud histories, one great future&quot;, in reference to the strong identities which workers and the community had attached to the companies.

A major street in Sudbury is named Falconbridge Road, after the company and community. In 2007, Xstrata donated Falconbridge&#x27;s historic Edison Building, its onetime head office, to the city of Greater Sudbury to serve as the new home of the city archives.

<doc id="923105" wikidata="Q316252" url="?curid=923105" title="Šarūnas Jasikevičius">
<text>Šarūnas Jasikevičius (; born 5 March 1976) is a Lithuanian professional basketball coach and former player who is the head coach for Fenerbahçe Beko of the Turkish Basketbol Süper Ligi and the EuroLeague. During his playing career, standing at a height of tall, he played at the point guard position.

Often considered one of the best Lithuanian and European point guards ever, Jasikevičius was a two-time All-EuroLeague First Team selection, the EuroLeague Final Four MVP in 2005 and a four-time triple crown winner. He was named the 2005 Israeli Basketball Premier League MVP. Moreover, he was the first player in EuroLeague history to win the competition with three clubs. A former representative of the senior Lithuanian men&#x27;s national team, he won the gold medal at 2003 EuroBasket, earning an All-EuroBasket Team selection and MVP honors in the process. He also won the bronze medal at the 2000 Summer Olympic Games, and the bronze medal at 2007 EuroBasket.

In 2015, Jasikevičius was named a EuroLeague Basketball Legend as a reward for his playing career and was honored with a ceremony.

He has won both Liga ACB and Spanish Cup with Barcelona as both a coach and player, as well as both Turkish Basketball League and Turkish Cup with Fenerbahçe in same capacities. Additionally, he achieved victory in the Lithuanian League with Zalgiris, also as both coach and player.

==Early years==
Jasikevičius was born into a family of athletes. His mother Rita, a famous Lithuanian handball player, won a silver medal with the Soviet Union women&#x27;s national handball team during the 1975 World Women&#x27;s Handball Championship. Following the success in the world championship, Rita was preparing for the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal. According to Rita: &quot;Everything was calculated, planned: Olympic Games, then - the increase of family, one year break and then back to sports again. But everything happened differently&quot; and she had to choose between her son and the Olympic Games. She decided to give birth to a child and give up the Olympic dream. Later on, the Soviet squad went on to win the Olympic gold medals in the Montreal Olympics and the national team&#x27;s head coach shut the door for Rita Jasikevičienė to return into the national team in the future. However, Šarūnas&#x27;s mother never regretted her decision. Šarūnas remembers that his mother constantly said: &quot;My son will give me back the Olympics&quot;.

In his childhood Šarūnas was a very agile child. His mother remembers that soon after learning to walk, Šarūnas immediately began to run leaning at 45 degrees. Rita: &quot;He was running and running everywhere and I had to constantly chase him&quot;. The biggest penalty for Šarūnas was to sit. His younger brother Vytenis was slightly different though. He was slower, but both brothers were unable to live without a ball as kids.

Jasikevičius&#x27;s father Linas always was a sports lover and his son followed his lead to cheer for practically anything. Together they cheered for the USSR national teams or any athlete who had USSR written across his or her chest. Not surprisingly, his dad took him to his first basketball workout when he was 6 years old. His first coach was Feliksas Mitkevičius in Kaunas basketball school, who was strict and never chased Šarūnas when he tried to run away from workouts. According to Mitkevičius, when Šarūnas was 12 years old, he was so sick of basketball that he wished to drop it. He visited his parents, outlined the situation and stated that it would be a huge loss to Lithuania. Following it, his dad had some strong words for Šarūnas and forbade him to drop basketball, which he wished to replace with tennis. In Kaunas basketball school he met with future NBA star Žydrūnas Ilgauskas with whom he was meeting practically every day, at school, in the gym or elsewhere for the next eleven years. Tomas Masiulis was another notable player on his team. Jasikevičius remembers that at first he was seen as the guy who was &quot;talented but lazy&quot; as he was not a committed athlete; all he did was joke around and try to work as little as possible. Consequently, on one occasions, his dad stopped him from going on a trip to Minsk with the team, a trip of the sort that only happens once a year, as his marks were disastrous and it was a punishment: &quot;No school? So no basketball&quot;. However, his parents were happy to see him pouring his hyperactivity into basketball, and this made them urge him on towards the sport, as it also helped him avoid bad company. They played in the gym, and also in the street using scrap metal instead of real baskets, and their favorite pastime was called &quot;minus&quot;, a kind of forerunner of the game that can be seen today during the NBA All-Star Game called &quot;horse&quot;. It was far from ideal, but his parents preferred to see him play with the scrap metal hoops in front of their home than down at the pitch, where it would have taken him less than five minutes to pick a fight with the wrong person. His childhood dream was to become a Žalgiris player, a team of which he was such a fan that he knew everything about every player, even the players&#x27; shoe sizes. Following the Žalgiris&#x27; victory in 1986 Intercontinental Cup, he begged his father to take him to the airport to welcome home the players, where hundreds of people were waiting in the freezing cold. His father knew some of the players, and managed to get signed posters and photos that he used to decorate all the walls of his room.

Šarūnas started going to school at Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and attended it until 1987. He had to take the bus to go to school even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew that the most important thing for his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the bad kids on Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he studied at Kaunas 4th Middle School. On his first class trip, he went to Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius&#x27;s greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald&#x27;s in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaped open when he was telling them about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, whom he admired more than any other Lithuanian superstars, like Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, because of Sabonis&#x27; elite passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished to be as good as him, watching his matches again and again, dozens of times, for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and David Robinson, and was later to watch it for a couple of years, more than a hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of the no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination, the way he dribbled, and how he passed between his opponent&#x27;s legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, which he tried to do like Petrović or Johnson.

Later he continued his studies in the United States. In 1993–94 he attended Solanco High School in Quarryville, Pennsylvania. That year his team won 25 of 27 games and was one of the contenders for the State Championship final, however they lost their first playoff game and finished the season early. However, he was noticed by Billy Hahn, who was working as University of Maryland assistant coach and who invited Jasikevičius to join them.

==College career==
Jasikevičius played NCAA Division I college basketball at the University of Maryland, with the Maryland Terrapins. He played as a wing, although he remade himself into a point guard in his pro career. He did not see much playing time in his first two years in college, with seniors Duane Simpkins, Johnny Rhodes, and Exree Hipp ahead of him at the wing positions. As a junior, he became a better passer and improved his defense. He averaged a shade under 13 points and 4 assists in his junior and senior years.

He also won three Greek League titles and three Greek Cups with Panathinaikos. In 2009, he signed a contract extension worth € 3.5 million euros net income with Panathinaikos.

During the fifth Spanish Liga ACB finals game against Real Madrid, Jasikevičius scored 23 points, and dished out 2 assists, in 19 minutes of game action.

==National team career==

===Lithuanian junior national team===
Jasikevičius was a member of the junior national teams of Lithuania. With Lithuania&#x27;s junior national teams, he won the gold medal at the 1994 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship, and the gold medal at the 1996 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship.

===Lithuanian senior national team===

He averaged 14.0 points and 5.1 assists, and scored a tournament-high 27 points, in a semifinals loss to the United States.

Jasikevičius also led Lithuania to the EuroBasket 2003 gold medal. He was named the tournament&#x27;s MVP, after averaging 14.0 points and 8.2 assists per game.

Jasikevičius also helped Lithuania win the bronze medal at the EuroBasket 2007. He averaged 10.4 points and 5.6 assists per game, and scored a tournament-high 18 points against Turkey, on 3 September 2007.

As of 2012, he was the only Lithuanian basketball player to participate in the Summer Olympics four times in a row. He retired from the Lithuanian national team following the 2012 Summer Olympics. Over his entire career as a senior Lithuania national basketball team member, he averaged 10 points, 2.3 rebounds, and 4.9 assists per game. He was named to the FIBA EuroBasket 2000–2020 Dream Team in 2020.

==Coaching career==
On 29 July 2014, Jasikevičius announced his retirement from playing basketball, and was appointed to an assistant coach position with Žalgiris. After the firing of head coach Gintaras Krapikas during the 2015–16 season, Jasikevičius became the team&#x27;s interim head coach. On 13 January 2016, it was announced that he was appointed their new head coach.

On 22 January 2016, he got his first EuroLeague victory as a head coach, when Žalgiris shockingly crushed the previous season&#x27;s runners-up, Olympiacos, by a score of 75–55, at Žalgiris Arena. On 26 October 2016, just before the first game versus his former long-time head coach Željko Obradović, Željko said: &quot;I knew that he will be a good coach and in the future - one of the best in Europe&quot;. On 13 June 2017, he was named best coach of the 2016–17 LKL season. After the season, San Antonio Spurs and U.S. national team head coach Gregg Popovich invited him to join his coaching staff during the 2017 NBA Summer League. However, Jasikevičius declined, due to previous summer commitments. Jasikevičius also took third place in voting for the 2017 Alexander Gomelsky EuroLeague Coach of the Year award.

During the 2017–18 EuroLeague season, Jasikevičius and his Žalgiris beat expectations by ending in sixth place in the regular season. On 26 April 2018, Žalgiris qualified for the 2018 EuroLeague Final Four by beating Olympiacos in game 4 to clinch a 3–1 series win. It was achieved by having a second lowest budget in the whole league. During the semi-final, Žalgiris played Fenerbahçe, unfortunately losing 76–67. Two days later they faced CSKA Moscow in the bronze medal game, winning that game 77–79 and finishing third for the season. On 20 June 2018, he was named best coach of the 2017–18 LKL season after coaching Žalgiris to yet another Lithuanian League title. On 27 June, Jasikevičius signed one-season contract with Žalgiris. He was named as a LKL Coach of the Year for the third straight time in 2019.

According to Euroleague statistics, Jasikevičius team&#x27;s defensive rating was 97,0 during the 2019/20 season. Jasikevičius team&#x27;s offensive rating was 100,7. The tight offensive system by Jasikevičius led to only 15,6 turnovers per game in his last season. Under Šarūnas Jasikevičius, Žalgiris was the third slowest team with 80 possessions per game. This can be explained by mentioning the depth of Jasikevičius playbook, which had more than 40 different plays prepared.

On 2 July 2020, he signed a two-year contract with FC Barcelona. During his first season as a head coach of FC Barcelona, the club won the 2020–21 EuroLeague Regular Season. On 26 June 2023, in a surprising move, Jasikevičius parted ways with the Catalan powerhouse after three seasons, despite having won the 2023 Liga ACB championship a few days before.

On 14 December 2023, Jasikevičius was announced as Fenerbahçe head coach on a three-year deal.

==Personal life==
In 2006, Jasikevičius became the first European player to have his own nominal basketball shoes manufactured by Adidas.

In 2006, Jasikevičius married Israeli model Linor Abargil, the winner of the Miss World 1998 beauty pageant (as Miss Israel). They divorced in 2008.

In 2009, he met Anna Douka, in an Athens bar. Currently, the pair have two children: a girl named Aila, who was born in 2010, and a boy named Lukas, who was born in 2012.

Šarunas&#x27; younger brother, Vytenis Jasikevičius, is also a professional basketball player.

In 2015, his biographical book &quot;Laimėti neužtenka&quot; (English: To win is not enough) was published in Italian, Greek and Lithuanian languages. An English version was also soon released. Later on, Spanish and Israeli publishing houses also showed interest.

On 21 July 2017, Jasikevičius married the mother of his two children, Anna Douka, after 8 years of relationship. The ceremony was held in Greece. Many famous basketball personalities attended the event, including Željko Obradović, Dimitris Itoudis, Mike Batiste, Paulius Jankūnas, Darius Songaila, and others.

<text>Yolande Martine Gabrielle de Polastron, Duchess of [[Polignac family|Polignac]] (8 September 17499 December 1793) was the favourite of Marie Antoinette, whom she met when she was presented at the Palace of Versailles in 1775, the year after Marie Antoinette became the Queen of France. She was considered one of the great beauties of pre-Revolutionary society, but her extravagance and exclusivity earned her many enemies.

==Biography==
Yolande Martine Gabrielle de Polastron was born in Paris in the reign of King Louis XV. Her parents were Jean François Gabriel, Count of Polastron, seigneur de Noueilles, Venerque and Grépiac (1722-1794), who served as French ambassador to Switzerland, and his wife, Jeanne Charlotte Hérault de Vaucresson (1726-1753). As was customary with aristocrats, most of whom bore more than one Christian name, she was generally known by the last of her names (Gabrielle). She was born into a family of ancient aristocratic lineage, but by the time of Gabrielle&#x27;s birth the family, despite its exalted ancestry, was encumbered by many debts, and its lifestyle was far from luxurious.

While Gabrielle was still an infant, her parents moved the family to Château of Noueilles, in the province of Languedoc in southern France. When Gabrielle was 3, her mother died and her welfare was entrusted to an aunt, who arranged for her to receive a convent education.

At the age of 16, Gabrielle was betrothed to Jules François Armand, comte de Polignac, marquis de Mancini (1746–1817), whom she married on 7 July 1767, a few months before her 18th birthday. Polignac&#x27;s family had a &quot;well-bred&quot; ancestry similar to Gabrielle&#x27;s family, and was in equally uncomfortable financial straits. At the time of his marriage, Polignac was serving in the &quot;Régiment de Royal Dragons&quot; (&quot;1er régiment de dragons&quot;), on an annual salary of 4,000 livres. Within a few years of the marriage, Jules and Gabrielle had two children: a daughter Aglaé and a son. Two more sons followed several years later, including Jules, prince de Polignac, who became the prime minister of France in 1829, under Charles X.

===Appearance===

Most surviving portraits show her to be pretty. One historian said that Gabrielle, in her portraits by Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun (see Self-portrait in a Straw Hat), generally looks &quot;like some harvested and luscious fruit.&quot; She had dark brunette hair, very pale white skin, and, perhaps most unusually, lilac or violet-coloured eyes.

Compiling the contemporary accounts of her, one modern historian has summarised her physical appearance thus: 

===Versailles===

When her sister-in-law Diane de Polignac invited her to the court at Versailles, Gabrielle came with her husband and was presented at a formal reception in the Hall of Mirrors in 1775, at which time she was formally presented to the Queen of France, Marie Antoinette, who was instantly &quot;dazzled&quot; by her, and invited her to move permanently to Versailles. The cost of maintaining oneself at the court of Versailles was ruinous, and Gabrielle replied that her husband did not have the money to finance a permanent move to the palace. Determined to keep her new favourite by her side, the Queen agreed to settle the family&#x27;s many outstanding debts and to find an appointment for Gabrielle&#x27;s husband.

Once she was installed in the palace, near the Queen&#x27;s apartments, Gabrielle also won the friendship of the King&#x27;s youngest brother, the comte d&#x27;Artois, and the approval of King Louis XVI, who was grateful for her calming influence on his wife and who encouraged their friendship. Gabrielle was, however, resented by other members of the royal entourage, particularly the Queen&#x27;s confessor and her chief political adviser, the Austrian ambassador. In a letter to the Queen&#x27;s mother, Empress Maria Theresa, the ambassador wrote, &quot;It is almost unexampled that in so short a time, the royal favour should have brought such overwhelming advantages to a family.&quot;

Charismatic and beautiful, Gabrielle became the undisputed leader of the Queen&#x27;s exclusive circle and ensured that few entered without her approval. Gabrielle was considered by many of her friends to be elegant, sophisticated, charming, and entertaining.
The entire Polignac family benefited enormously from the Queen&#x27;s considerable generosity, but their increasing wealth and lavish lifestyle outraged many aristocratic families, who resented their dominance at court. Ultimately, the Queen&#x27;s favouritism towards the Polignac family was one of the many causes which fueled Marie Antoinette&#x27;s unpopularity with some of her husband&#x27;s subjects (especially Parisians) and members of the politically liberal nobility. In 1780, Gabrielle&#x27;s husband was given the title &quot;Duke of Polignac&quot;, thus making Gabrielle a &quot;Duchess&quot;, a further source of irritation to the courtiers.

By the late 1780s, thousands of pornographic pamphlets alleged that Gabrielle was the Queen&#x27;s lesbian lover, including accusations that the pair had engaged in tribadism. Although there was no evidence to back up these accusations, they did immeasurable damage to the prestige of the monarchy, especially given the deep-rooted suspicion of homosexuality held by the bourgeoisie and urban working-classes at the time.

Several historians have suggested that reports of Gabrielle&#x27;s extravagance have been greatly exaggerated, and they point out that, during her 14-year residency at Versailles she spent as much as Louis XV&#x27;s mistress, Madame de Pompadour, had spent in one. Others have contended that to some extent she deserved her negative reputation because, despite the inaccuracies of the claims that she was sexually disreputable, other criticisms of her were valid: she was cold, self-centred, self-indulgent, and masked a love of gossip and intrigue behind a sweet-toned voice and flawless manners. This argument was particularly championed by the author and biographer Stefan Zweig, who wrote: &quot;Not even Madame de Maintenon, not even the Pompadour, cost as much as this favourite, this angel, with downcast eyes, this modest and gentle Polignac. Those who were not themselves swept into the whirlpool, stood at the marge contemplating it with astonishment ... [as] the Queen&#x27;s hand was invisibly guided by the violet-eyed, the lovely, the gentle Polignac.&quot;

Another critic is Elisabeth de Feydeau.

===Governess of the Children of France===

In 1782, the Governess of the Children of France, Victoire de Rohan, &quot;princesse de Guéméné&quot; and wife of Henri Louis de Rohan, had to resign her post due to a scandal caused by her husband&#x27;s bankruptcy. The Queen replaced the princess with Gabrielle. This appointment generated outrage at court, where it was felt Gabrielle&#x27;s social status was insufficient for a post of that magnitude.
As a result of her new position, Gabrielle was given a 13-room apartment for herself in the palace. Technically, this was within the acceptable limits of etiquette, but the size of the apartment was unprecedented, particularly in a place as overpopulated as Versailles. Royal governesses had previously been quartered in four- or five-room apartments. Gabrielle was even given her own cottage in Marie Antoinette&#x27;s favorite pastoral refuge, the Hameau de la Reine, built in the 1780s on the grounds of the Petit Trianon in the park of Versailles.

Gabrielle&#x27;s marriage was cordial, if not successful; it was typical of aristocratic arranged marriages. For many years, she was apparently in love with the captain of the Royal Guard, Joseph Hyacinthe François de Paule de Rigaud, Comte de Vaudreuil, although many of her friends considered Vaudreuil too domineering and too uncouth for the kind of society in which Gabrielle moved. It was rumored at Versailles that Gabrielle&#x27;s youngest child was actually fathered by Vaudreuil. However, the exact nature of Gabrielle&#x27;s relationship with Vaudreuil has been debated by some historians, who doubted the liaison was sexual. This theory has recently been resurrected by Catholic novelist and commentator Elena Maria Vidal. Despite the claims that they were lovers, Gabrielle showed no hesitation in distancing herself from Vaudreuil whenever she felt her own social position was threatened by the Queen&#x27;s dislike of the manipulative courtier. There are hardly any letters surviving from the couple, who either in reality may not have been sufficiently close to write to each other when separated, or may just have been very careful in masking their communications for political reasons. Their letters may have been subsequently destroyed either by themselves or others for precaution&#x27;s sake.

===Children===

* Aglaé Louise Françoise Gabrielle de Polignac (7 May 1768, Paris; died 30 March 1803 in Edinburgh). Nicknamed Guichette by her family, married Antoine duc de Gramont et Guiche at Versailles on 11 July 1780
* Armand Jules Marie Héracle de Polignac, duc de Polignac (11 January 1771, Paris; died 1 March 1847 in Paris), second duc de Polignac
* Jules, prince de Polignac (10 November 1780, Paris; died 30 March 1847 in Saint-Germain-en-Laye), third duc de Polignac. Married firstly Barbara Campbell (1788–1819); secondly Mary Charlotte Parkyns (1792–1864); was French Prime Minister from 1829 to 1830, in the government of Gabrielle&#x27;s friend Charles X, the former comte d&#x27;Artois.
* Camille Henri Melchior de Polignac, comte de Polignac (27 December 1781 in Versailles; died 2 February 1855 in Fontainebleau), married Marie Charlotte Calixte Alphonsine Le Vassor de la Touche (1791–1861)
===In England===

Perhaps due to the Queen&#x27;s intense dislike of the Comte de Vaudreuil, whom she found rude and irritating, Gabrielle&#x27;s influence over Marie Antoinette temporarily waned after 1785, when the Queen&#x27;s second son was born. The Queen was becoming increasingly dissatisfied with the ambition of her favourites, especially when they championed a politician whom the Queen despised. Marie Antoinette confided to another lady-in-waiting, Henriette Campan, that she was &quot;suffering acute dissatisfaction&quot; over the Polignacs. Wrote Campan: &quot;Her Majesty observed to me that when a sovereign raises up favourites in her court she raises up despots against herself&quot;. Eventually, Gabrielle felt Marie Antoinette&#x27;s displeasure and decided to visit friends in England, particularly Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire, who was the leader of London high society and one of Gabrielle&#x27;s closest friends. During her time in England, she earned the nickname &quot;Little Po,&quot; due to her delicate constitution.

===Revolution===
On September 14, 1788, anti-monarchy protests renewed, and in October 1788, protestors demanded money for fireworks, they demanded that anyone in a carriage dismount and salute to Henri IV, and they also burned effigies representing Yolande de Polastron, and then the troops were deployed and they dispersed the crowds with great bloodshed in the Place de la Grève.

The months leading up to the July 1789 outbreak of the French Revolution saw the Queen and the duchesse de Polignac become close again. Politically, Gabrielle and her friends supported the ultra-monarchist movement in Versailles, and Gabrielle became increasingly important in royalist intrigues as the summer progressed, usually in partnership with her friend, the comte d&#x27;Artois, the King&#x27;s youngest brother.

The marquis de Bombelles, a diplomat and politician, remembered Gabrielle&#x27;s ceaseless work to promote hardline responses against the emergent revolution. Together with the baron de Breteuil, Bombelles&#x27; godfather and former diplomat, and the comte d&#x27;Artois, Gabrielle persuaded Marie Antoinette to work against the King&#x27;s popular minister of finances, Jacques Necker. However, without the necessary military support to crush the insurrection, Necker&#x27;s dismissal fuelled the serious violence in Paris, culminating in the attack on the Bastille fortress.

After the storming of the Bastille on 14 July 1789, all the members of the Polignac family went into exile. On Louis XVI&#x27;s express orders, the comte d&#x27;Artois left, as did Breteuil; Gabrielle went with her family to Switzerland, where she kept in contact with the Queen through letters. After Gabrielle had left, the care of the royal children was entrusted to the Marquise de Tourzel.

===Exile===

After her departure from France, she and her family lived an ambulating life, travelling from one place to another. She kept in contact with Marie Antoinette through correspondence, by which her place of residence can be traced. The Polignac family travelled through Switzerland, Turin, Rome and Venice (where she attended the wedding of her son in March 1790), and from Italy to Vienna in Austria in 1791. She was reportedly present in the Austrian Netherlands during the Flight to Varennes, and in July 1791, she is noted as one of the extravagantly dressed women who attended the émigrée court of the count of Provence in Koblenz. The emigree court in Koblenz was however dissolved after the Battle of Valmy in 1792, and she returned to Austria, where she died.

Gabrielle developed a terminal illness while living in Switzerland, although she had arguably been in poor health for several years. She died in Austria in December 1793, shortly after hearing of Marie Antoinette&#x27;s execution. Gabrielle&#x27;s family simply announced that she had died as a result of heartbreak and suffering. Most historians have concluded that she died of cancer, and contradictory royalist reports of her death suggested consumption as an alternative cause.

No specific mention of her disease was made in the various allegorical pamphlets which showed the Angel of Death descending to take the soul of the still-beautiful duchesse de Polignac. Her beauty and early death became metaphors for the demise of the old regime, at least in early pamphlets. In subsequent family correspondence, the duchess&#x27;s beauty was a much-emphasised point.

==Progeny==

Gabrielle was the mother of Jules, prince de Polignac, who became Prime Minister for Charles X (the former comte d&#x27;Artois) in 1829. She was also the mother of Aglaé de Polignac, duchesse de Guiche, who died in 1803, in an accidental fire. Two of her grandsons were Camille Armand Jules Marie, Prince de Polignac and Prince Edmond de Polignac. Her great-great-grandson, Count Pierre de Polignac, was the father of Rainier III, Prince of Monaco. Her descendants can also be found in France and in Russia, where her granddaughter, daughter of &quot;Guichette&quot;, married a nobleman, Aleksandr Lvovich Davydov.

==Legacy==

Gabrielle de Polastron&#x27;s mark in history can be seen in history books, novels, movies, and other media. 
;In popular culture
For example:
*She is one of the major characters in &quot;The Rose of Versailles&quot; (1979), a shōujo manga/anime created by Riyoko Ikeda
*She is played by Claudia Cardinale in the two-part film La Révolution française (1989)
*She is portrayed by Rose Byrne in the film &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006) 
*She is portrayed by Virginie Ledoyen in the film &quot;Farewell, My Queen&quot; (2012)
*She is portrayed by Liah O&#x27;Prey in the television series &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2022)

;In history
Her critics among historians have argued that the Duchesse de Polignac typified the aristocratic hangers-on at the court of Versailles before the French Revolution and that she embodied the exclusivity, the obliviousness, and the selfish extravagance of the ruling class. However, more sympathetic historians, such as Pierre de Nolhac and the Marquis de Ségur, agree that most of the problems originated with her entourage and that she was certainly no worse than many of the aristocrats or favourites who had preceded her at Versailles.

Assessments of her character aside, it is generally agreed that she was one of the key figures in the ultra-monarchist movement throughout the early summer of 1789, acting under the influence of her friend, the Comte d&#x27;Artois.

<text>Hubert Durrett Stephens (July 2, 1875March 14, 1946) was an American lawyer and politician who served two terms as a Democratic United States Senator from Mississippi from 1923 until 1935.

== Early life and education ==
Stephens was born in New Albany, Mississippi. He attended the University of Mississippi and played football for one of the school’s first teams. He graduated from the university’s law school and soon began to practice law in New Albany.

=== Early political career ===
He served as a town alderman in New Albany for one term, then in 1907, he received an appointment to fill a vacancy as district attorney in the Third Judicial Circuit. In 1908, he was elected to a full term.

=== U.S. House of Representatives ===
In 1910, Stephens ran for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. He won election and four subsequent re-elections, serving five consecutive terms from 1911 to 1921.

He was a supporter of President Woodrow Wilson. Stephens advocated for a free trade approach and thus opposed the protective tariff that was a hotly debated issue of the day. He rose to the rank of vice chairman of the Banking and Currency Subcommittee, where he called the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 “the greatest piece of constructive legislation that has been enacted in the history of the nation.”

The district Stephens represented was agrarian and rural, leading the congressman to advocate for federal support for rural road and transportation development. Opposed to what he saw as an immoral trafficking of liquor throughout the South, he also supported the prohibition amendment in 1917.

He supported state’s rights and opposed progressive social reforms, including voting against giving women the right to vote and reforms in child labor laws, which he believed would negatively impact family farms.

Stephens sometimes hesitated to take a position on issues, such as when he voted “present” on a 1914 bill limiting state public service commissioners in their approval of new railroad stock, and again on a 1916 worker’s compensation bill passed by the House. He opposed a bill limiting railroad employees to an eight-hour work day, but supported federalization of the nation’s railways during World War I.

Citing health concerns stemming from his struggles with adult-onset diabetes, Stephens did not run for Re-election in 1920.

=== U.S. Senate ===
In 1922 Stephens ran for a U.S. Senate seat that became open upon the retirement of John Sharp Williams. In the campaign, he defeated former Senator James K. Vardaman by a vote of 95,351 to 86,853. In 1923, he began the first of two consecutive terms in the Senate.

He served during the national dialogue over the future of the Mississippi River Delta. After the devastating flood in 1927, the Commerce Committee on which he served devoted a great deal of attention to the issue. Stephens aligned himself with others from the lower Mississippi Valley in the contentious debate over establishment of flood control plain in the region. Nevertheless, Stephens gained notoriety mostly for his inaction on the committee and reluctance to take a stand. A prominent national magazine of the day cited Stephens as being “the only senator in recent times who has evinced a willingness to forego his right to talk.”

Stephens generally opposed liberal immigration policies, although he supported legislation paving the way for admission and naturalization of foreign women married to U.S. servicemen. He also supported the legal admission of Mexican beet sugar workers.

He was a leader in the successful enactment a bill to reorganize federal prisons and create the Bureau of Prisons. Stephens proved to be less willing than Mississippi’s other senator, Pat Harrison, to accept social and economic advancements.

He supported the candidacy of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, as well as most of the tenets of Roosevelt’s New Deal. Even during this period, Stephens opposed labor reforms such as the five-day work week. He was a leader in the successful effort to construct the Natchez Trace Parkway.

=== Lynching episode ===
In 1925 Stephens unsuccessfully attempted to intervene in the lynching of L. Q. Ivy, a Black man accused of rape in New Albany. In 1934, he was defeated by Theodore Bilbo in the primary.

==== Defeat ====
In 1934, Stephens campaigned on the platform: “Stand by the president and his program.” His opponent in the race, the infamous Theodore Bilbo, campaigned with the jingoistic rhetorical zeal that would become his trademark, criticizing Stephens for his record against labor reforms and his silence on key issues of the day. Stephens also encountered criticism for his support of an economic act that reduced funding for veterans. Bilbo defeated Stephens and became a national symbol of the anti-Civil Rights block in Congress.

== Later career and retirement ==
Stephens was the director of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation from 1935 to 1936. After that, he practiced law in Washington, D.C. before retiring to his Mississippi farm in 1941. Prior to his death, he instructed that his official papers from his time in office be burned, leaving little available record of his public service.

== Death ==
On March 14, 1946, Stephens died in New Albany at the age of 70, following a lengthy period of declining health. His remains were interred in Pythian Cemetery.

<text>CHC Helicopter is a Texas-based helicopter services company.

CHC Helicopter maintains it global headquarters in Irving, Texas and operates more than 250 aircraft in 30 countries around the world. CHC&#x27;s major international operating units are based in Australia, Brazil, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, and the United Kingdom. The company is one of several global providers of helicopter transportation services to the offshore oil and gas industry (others including Bristow Helicopters and NHV). CHC has capabilities in precision flying techniques and technical support.

CHC has long-term working relationships with most of the major oil and gas companies. CHC operates the marine search and rescue service for the Irish Coast Guard at Shannon, Waterford, Sligo and Dublin airports. CHC provides helicopter services in Australia for the Fire and Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia, Victoria Police and the Ambulance Service of New South Wales.

==History==
===Origins===
The origins of CHC Helicopter can be traced back to the start of commercial helicopter operations in British Columbia. Following the end of the Second World War, two former Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) instructors, Carl Agar and Barney Bent, aspired to continue flying aircraft and chose to form their own flight training club, the &quot;South Okanagan Flying Club&quot;, in Penticton using a handful of de Havilland Tiger Moths. Shortly thereafter, Carl and Barney partnered with ex-RCAF engineer Alf Stringer to join the group. However, as there was not much demand for private pilot training at the time, the three men chose to relocate the business to Kelowna and rebranded it as &quot;Okanagan Air Services Ltd.&quot;

Early on, Okanagan Air Services operated only fixed-wing aircraft, such as a pair of Cessna 140s, to perform charter and training flights. Agar became interested in the potential of the newly emerging helicopter and of its potential application to the commercial market; the three men travelled to Yakima to attend a demonstration of the Bell 47, the first commercially certified helicopter. Upon their return, they immediately set about securing backers from which to finance their expansion into rotorcraft. In July 1947, the company was able to raise sufficient finance to purchase its own Bell 47-B3 helicopter, &quot;CF-FZX&quot;, as well as to funding training on both its maintenance and piloting. Upon its delivery on 9 August 1947, it was the first commercially licensed helicopter in British Columbia.

The company&#x27;s initial use of its helicopter largely revolved around crop dusting; on 1 September 1947, &quot;CF-FZX&quot; was damaged after striking powerlines, but was repaired after several months. While it became clear that small-scale crop dusting was not economic with the type, insect spraying was more lucrative however. Agar&#x27;s flying skills proved valuable during mountain flying in support of government topographic survey efforts; this pioneering use of a helicopter led to Agar being awarded the Trans-Canada Trophy in 1950 and gain valuable publicity for the company. Further mountain survey flights led to Okanagan receiving contracts from companies like Aluminum Company of Canada Ltd to support remote construction projects and to transport personnel or equipment to and from the wilderness. Even so, the company remained unprofitable for its first few years.

===Expansion===

During the early 1950s, the company officially renamed itself &quot;Okanagan Helicopters Ltd.&quot; By the end of 1952, it had become the largest commercial helicopter operator in North America and one of the largest in the world. Throughout much of the 1950s, Okanagan participated in the construction and maintenance of the Mid-Canada Line of radar stations, using a mixed fleet of Sikorsky S-55 and Bell 47s. By the end of 1958, the firm was operating a fleet of 51 rotorcraft at various locations all across Canada. In the 1960s, Okanagan continued to grow into new locations and new markets, retaining a heavy focus on remote construction projects. During 1963, it received its first overseas contract from East Pakistan, which it met via a single Bell 47J.

The 1970s was a period of transformation for Okanagan. Only Bent remained on staff by this point as both Agar and Stringer had resigned during the 1960s over disputes on how the company ought to be run. Okanagan embarked on a spree of acquisitions, purchasing companies such as Universal Helicopters, Haida Helicopters, Lac Saint-Jean Aviation, Dominion-Pegasus Helicopters, Sept-Iles Helicopter Services, Associated Helicopters and Bow Helicopter. By 1975, 20 percent of the company&#x27;s revenue came from international sources; a dedicated international division was established to manage this business sector. Furthermore, as a result of the turboshaft engine having displaced the piston engine on newer and more capable helicopters, Okanagan began to introduce turbine-powered rotorcraft into its fleet, including the Bell 204, Bell 212, Sikorsky S-58T, Sikorsky S-62, and Sikorsky S-76.

By 1981, Okanagan was the largest helicopter company in Canada, operating a fleet of 125 helicopters, along with 900 employees and annual revenues of $83 million Cdn. The company attracted the attention of various investors, leading to a takeover by Canadian oil company Resource Service Group; soon thereafter, Alan Bristow, the founder of Britain&#x27;s Bristow Helicopters, acquired a 49 percent ownership stake in the company.

===CHC era===
In 1987, Newfoundland businessman Craig Dobbin headed a group of investors organized under the name &quot;Canadian Holding Company&quot;, commonly using the initialism &quot;CHC&quot;. CHC purchased Okanagan Helicopters, along with Viking Helicopters, and Toronto Helicopters; all three merged their assets with Dobbin&#x27;s own company, Sealand Helicopters, to form a new company, initially branded &quot;Canadian Helicopters&quot;, while the parent company was renamed &quot;CHC Helicopter Corporation&quot;. The new entity placed a great priority upon merger and acquisition opportunities, in addition to forming strategic partnerships, that would allow it to enter new or lightly served regions, such as South America.

During the 1990s and 2000s, CHC continued to acquire various other operators, including British International Helicopters in 1994; Helicopter Services Group of Norway in 1999 (including Bond Helicopters), Helikopter Service AS, Lloyd Helicopters of Australia and Court Helicopters of South Africa. In 2004, CHC purchased Schreiner Aviation Group, which specialized in provided offshore helicopter services in the Dutch sector of the North Sea and to the Nigerian offshore industry. In 2000, CHC agreed with &quot;Fonds de Solidarité&quot; FTQ (FSTQ) and the management of its two Canadian divisions, &quot;Canadian Helicopters Eastern&quot; and &quot;Canadian Helicopters Western&quot;, to sell an interest in CHC&#x27;s Canadian assets via a management buyout to form Canadian Helicopters; consequently, senior management and FSTQ acquired 10% and 45% equity interests in Canadian Helicopters, respectively, while CHC retained a 45% equity interest.

During 2004, CHC decided to reorganize its operations into two principal divisions; &quot;Helicopter Services&quot; became responsible for the firm&#x27;s global operations, while &quot;Heli-One&quot; functions as the world&#x27;s largest independent provider of helicopter maintenance, repair, and overhaul services. As part of the restructuring, the company relocated its corporate headquarters from St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador to Richmond, British Columbia.

In late February 2008, all of CHC&#x27;s shares were purchased by First Reserve, a US private equity company, for CAD$3.7 billion ($3.5 billion), following the latter&#x27;s uninvited offer. Around this same time period, the word &quot;Corporation&quot; was dropped from the company&#x27;s name, having been formally rebranded as &quot;CHC Helicopter&quot;. In January 2014, the company announced its intention to raise up to $529 million through an initial public offering, the proceeds of which it mainly intended to use to paydown its outstanding debts. On January 16, 2014, CHC announced an initial public offering of 31,000,000 shares at a price of $10 per share.

On January 15, 2016, CHC offered 31,000,000 shares at US$5.17. On February 1, 2016 the New York Stock Exchange delisted the CHC&#x27;s ordinary shares, pursuant to Section 802.01B of the NYSE&#x27;s Listed Company Manual requiring NYSE-listed companies to maintain an average market capitalization of $15 million or more over the preceding thirty trading days. The NYSE also suspended trading of the Company&#x27;s ordinary shares effective immediately. On May 5, 2016, the company filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy. CHC&#x27;s bankruptcy was attributed to recent drops in the price of oil having negatively impacted revenue, making it unable to service the company&#x27;s high burden of debt; other helicopter operators were also reported to be struggling under the prevailing economic conditions of the period as well. Reflecting the company&#x27;s drop in performance, CHC&#x27;s share value dropped from US$176.10 on November 17, 2014 to US$0.45 by June 17, 2016. During July 2016, a Texas court allowed CHC to shed 65 helicopters from its financial obligations, the majority of its Eurocopter AS332 Super Puma fleet. On March 1, 2017, a reorganized CHC emerged, relaunching its brand and web presence. Key creditors took over majority ownership of the newly restructured company, but the deal froze out existing shareholders. In December 2019, a 18-month-long dispute between CHC and British union staff over pay was settled.

==Divisions==

CHC manages its global operations through the following divisions:

This fleet has now been replaced by 5 Sikorsky S-92 Helibus. The S-61N exited service in December 2013 with a flight from Dublin Airport to Weston Aerodrome, West Dublin. The flight was operated by EI-SAR, the oldest S-61N in commercial operation at the time.

===United Kingdom===
CHC, as part of the Soteria SAR consortium was selected as the &quot;Preferred Bidder&quot; for a 25-year contract to provide a civilian Search and Rescue service throughout the United Kingdom. However, days before the contract was due to be signed in February 2011, the British Government halted the process after CHC disclosed that it had unauthorised access to commercially sensitive information. The Soteria SAR was cancelled and the contract was awarded to back to Bristow Helicopters, who had operated the coastguard helicopters from Stornoway Airport, Sumburgh Airport, RNAS Lee-on-Solent (HMS Daedalus) and RNAS Portland (HMS Osprey) during the time of the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force operating their Westland Sea Kings, prior to the Soteria SAR being set up.

<text>Michael James Tindall, (born 18 October 1978) is an English former rugby union player and a member of the British royal family. Tindall played outside centre for Bath and Gloucester, and won 75 caps for England between 2000 and 2011. He was a member of the England squad which won the 2003 World Cup.

Tindall made his debut for England on 5 February 2000, against Ireland in the 2000 Six Nations Championship. As well as winning the 2003 World Cup, he was a member of the England team which won the 2003 Six Nations Championship. He was injured at the 2007 Rugby World Cup. Tindall played in eleven Six Nations Championship competitions from 2000 to 2011. Tindall is married to Zara Phillips, the daughter of Anne, Princess Royal and the eldest niece of King Charles III. They have three children.

==Early life==
Michael James Tindall was born 18 October 1978 at Wharfedale Hospital in Otley, West Yorkshire, the son of Philip Tindall, a banker for Barclays, and Linda (née Shepherd), a social worker. Tindall&#x27;s maternal ancestors include bootmakers, stonemasons and weavers; his paternal great-grandfather, Arthur Sutcliffe Tindall, was a blacksmith, the grandson of William Tindall, a landowner farming 105 acres at Fairburn, North Yorkshire.

Tindall was educated at the independent public school Queen Elizabeth Grammar School, Wakefield, while his father captained Otley Rugby Union Football Club.

==Career==

===Bath===
Tindall joined Bath straight from school, as an 18-year-old in 1997. At the time, the centre pairing at Bath and England were Jeremy Guscott and Phil de Glanville, but after the 1999 Rugby World Cup, Tindall played regularly at both club and country level, making his England debut against Ireland at Twickenham in 2000 alongside Mike Catt, scoring a try in the process.

Despite criticism over the years, in particular from Will Carling and ex-Bath fly-half Stuart Barnes, he cemented the outside centre position as his own with a partnership with inside centre Will Greenwood, playing in the 2003 Rugby World Cup. Tindall wore the number 12 jersey and played at outside centre; he usually lined up outside Greenwood, as the latter preferred to wear the number 13 jersey for superstitious reasons. He was dropped for the semi-final in favour of Mike Catt, whose kicking was required in the rainy weather. Tindall was reinstated in the final, which England won.

Tindall missed the 2005 Six Nations with a foot injury. He was unable to regain his fitness for the British &amp; Irish Lions tour to New Zealand. Described by England&#x27;s former head coach, Andy Robinson, as the &#x27;heartbeat&#x27; of the side, Tindall found his way back to form, following a lengthy absence, in 2005.

Tindall&#x27;s contract became up for renewal in 2005, but encountered difficulties with Bath&#x27;s strict salary cap policy. After falling out with Bath owner Andrew Brownsword over the offer of an early testimonial game and further concerns over his long term fitness, Tindall ended his eight-year association with Bath. He joined their West Country rivals Gloucester Rugby on a three-year deal worth £150,000.

===Gloucester ===

After returning from injury in the autumn of 2005, Tindall regained his England place, this time at inside centre. At club level, he continued to play at 13, with the 12 shirt going to Henry Paul. The partnership was heavily criticised and Tindall reportedly spent much of the season showing a poor run of form despite selection. Henry Paul broke club rules and fell out of favour with Gloucester Rugby coach, Dean Ryan during an incident at Tindall&#x27;s girlfriend&#x27;s birthday party. Young centre, Anthony Allen, was subsequently introduced, which helped forge the start of a &quot;powerful&quot; centre partnership between the two towards the end of the season. His partnership with Jamie Noon was criticised, with claims that the bulky partnership lacked imagination and play-making ability.

During his recuperation from another injury in 2005, Tindall entered the British Poker Open tournament, finishing in 3rd place in his heat before being eliminated by John Gale. On 18 November 2006, Tindall made his first Guinness Premiership start of the season against third-placed Wasps. Troubled by a calf injury into the 2006/07 season, he made only two appearances as a replacement, against Worcester and Irish. Tindall came back from his injury however with a much more highly rated run of form.

Tindall was again included in the England starting line up for the 2007 Six Nations opener against Scotland at Twickenham, under new head coach Brian Ashton, selected to play outside former rugby league footballer Andy Farrell. In April 2007, playing away against Newcastle Falcons in the Guinness Premiership, Tindall broke his leg in a tackle on Toby Flood, forcing him to miss the rest of the season, including the Guinness Premiership final. This also precluded his selection for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. In October 2007, after recovering from injury, Tindall returned to the Gloucester starting line up, against Worcester Warriors at home, in the Guinness Premiership. Tindall had a &quot;fairytale&quot; comeback, scoring a try to the Shed&#x27;s delight. On 7 December 2007 against Bourgoin in the Heineken Cup, Tindall limped off the field with a shin injury sustained in a similar tackle from that against Newcastle the previous season when he broke his leg. Despite this injury, Tindall recovered quickly and played the following week, continuing his form for Gloucester.

In February 2008 Tindall was named in Brian Ashton&#x27;s squad for the upcoming Six Nations Championship, and thus started for England at outside centre against Wales at Twickenham on 2 February 2008. During the match, he accidentally landed on winger Mark Jones&#x27;s foot and had to be stretchered off. He had attempted to win possession just as Jones was kicking the ball away, and was ruled out of the tournament with internal bleeding, a perforated liver and a punctured lung.

Tindall stated in a press conference that he was &quot;happy just to be alive&quot; after his injury, but was looking forward to returning to the field for Gloucester in what he hoped would be towards the &quot;business end of the season&quot; in April. In January 2008, Tindall announced a new three-year deal signed to remain at Gloucester until the end of the 2011 season. In April 2012, Gloucester announced that Tindall would be one of a group of 11 players not playing for the club next season. However, in June 2012, he agreed a one-year contract as a player and backs coach at Gloucester. In May 2013, he signed a new contract to remain player-backs coach for another year. On 15 July 2014, Tindall announced his retirement from professional rugby.

===Minchinhampton RFC===
Since retiring, Tindall has gone back to grassroots rugby and is playing and coaching with amateur club Minchinhampton RFC, who compete in Gloucester 2. Tindall made his debut against Gloucester All Blues in October 2014. Minchinhampton RFC is conveniently located for Tindall next to Gatcombe Park where he lives.

===2011 Rugby World Cup misconduct===
On 11 November 2011, Tindall was fined £25,000 by the Rugby Football Union and was removed from its elite player squad as a result of his throwing a dwarf in Queenstown, New Zealand, during the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Martin Johnson, the England manager, had initially supported Tindall, but it was stated later that some, including Johnson, had been misled. After a formal inquiry, the RFU said that Tindall&#x27;s actions were unacceptable and would not be tolerated. Tindall said he intended to appeal against the decision. On 28 November 2011 the appeal partly succeeded. Tindall&#x27;s suspension from the England squad was set aside and the fine was reduced to £15,000. Tindall stated during the appeal process that he had not intentionally misled Johnson, as he did not remember the relevant events.

Tindall was filmed flirting with an unknown woman at a bar in Queenstown, New Zealand, during the 2011 Rugby World Cup A bouncer uploaded security camera footage of the incident to YouTube, and was later charged with accessing a computer system for a dishonest purpose.

===Barbarians===
Tindall was selected for the Barbarians squad on their short tour in May 2012 against England at Twickenham, Ireland at Kingsholm Stadium, Gloucester and Wales at the Millennium Stadium.

In May 2013, Tindall captained the Barbarians against England at Twickenham. Tindall was named a replacement for the Barbarians against the British &amp; Irish Lions as part of their 2013 tour to Australia.

== Personal life ==

On 21 December 2010, Buckingham Palace announced the engagement of Tindall to Zara Phillips, the daughter of Anne, Princess Royal, and her first husband Captain Mark Phillips. Phillips is the eldest granddaughter of Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, and niece to King Charles III. The couple first met during the 2003 Rugby World Cup in Australia. As was required at the time by the Royal Marriages Act 1772, the Queen gave her consent to their marriage in a meeting of the Privy Council on 10 May 2011. The wedding took place on 30 July 2011 at Canongate Kirk in Edinburgh with 400 guests in attendance, including the royal family.

The Tindalls resided in a £1.2 million home in Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, before moving onto the Gatcombe Park estate near Minchinhampton. The couple&#x27;s home, Aston Farm, is a seven-bedroom farmhouse next to the Gatcombe Park estate. On 17 January 2014, it was announced that Zara had given birth to a baby girl at Gloucestershire Royal Hospital. The couple named their daughter Mia Grace Tindall ( ). Mia was christened on 30 November 2014 at St Nicholas&#x27;s church in the village of Cherington in Gloucestershire. His wife&#x27;s next two pregnancies ended in miscarriage, before their second daughter, Lena Elizabeth Tindall ( ), was born on 18 June 2018, at Stroud Maternity Hospital. Their third child, son Lucas Philip Tindall, was born on 21 March 2021 at Gatcombe Park.

Tindall has two convictions for drunk-driving. His nose was broken at least eight times during his rugby career; in 2018, he underwent a surgery that fixed the fractures.

In 2015, Tindall appeared on reality television shows &quot;The Jump&quot; and &quot;Bear Grylls: Mission Survive&quot;. He hosted the podcast &quot;House of Rugby&quot; together with James Haskell and Alex Payne, before launching another podcast with them in August 2020, titled &quot;The Good, The Bad &amp; The Rugby&quot;.

Tindall appeared in the 2022 edition of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, finishing 4th on 26 November 2022. In January 2023, Magic Millions announced that Tindall would present an interview series titled &quot;Mike Drop&quot; on their YouTube channel.

==Celebrity ambassador==
Tindall has appeared as the host for a number of charity sporting events, including a golf classic sponsored by the Legion Foundation every year to raise money for the on Course Foundation and Rugby for Heroes. In 2012, Tindall became the charity ambassador for The Midlands Air Ambulance.

In late 2013, Tindall became a brand ambassador for online trading company UFXMarkets. Since 2013, Tindall has been hosting a charity golf day annually called ISPS HANDA Mike Tindall Celebrity Golf Classic with people from fields including rugby, golf and entertainment. It aims to raise funds for charities helping people with disabilities and curing Parkinson&#x27;s disease, such as the Matt Hampson Foundation and the Cure Parkinson&#x27;s Trust, and also those involving military personnel making the transition to civilian life such as Rugby for Heroes. Tindall is also the principal patron of both the Matt Hampson Foundation and Rugby for Heroes. In 2021 Tindall co-founded The Rugby Wine Club to help to raise funds for grassroots rugby clubs.

In April 2015 Tindall became a brand ambassador for online bookmaker Betway.

Tindall has been increasing his involvement with Right To Play since his introduction to their work in 2015. In October 2015, he visited one of their programmes in Accra, Ghana, which he said had a profound effect on him. In December 2016, Tindall was announced as an Athlete Ambassador for the charity Right To Play UK, which uses play to educate and empower children to overcome the effects of poverty, conflict and disease in disadvantaged communities.

In January 2018, he participated in &quot;And They&#x27;re Off!&quot; in aid of Sport Relief.

<text>The Bradford Canal was a English canal which ran from the Leeds and Liverpool Canal at Shipley into the centre of Bradford. It opened in 1774, and was closed in 1866, when it was declared to be a public health hazard. Four years later it reopened with a better water supply, and closed for the second time in 1922. It was subsequently filled in, although consideration has been given to restoring it. There are some remains, including a short section of canal at the junction and a pumping station building, which is now a dwelling.

==History==
The first plans to provide a navigable route to Bradford were made in 1744, when a number of Gentlemen and Farmers sought parliamentary approval for improvements to of the River Aire, starting at Inghay Bridge, near Skipton, and ending at Cottingley Bridge, near Bingley, which was the nearest point on the river from which an existing road ran to Bradford. Although the bill reached the committee stage, nothing more became of it.
When the Leeds and Liverpool Canal was promoted in the 1760s, its course between Skipton and Bingley broadly followed that proposed by the 1744 plan. It was authorised in 1770, and in the same year fourteen merchants, including six who were already on the committee for the Leeds and Liverpool, planned a branch which would serve the town of Bradford. An act of Parliament, the (11 Geo. 3. c. 89) was obtained on 29 April 1771, which appointed 28 proprietors. They could raise £6,000 in capital by issuing shares, with a further £3,000 if needed, to be used to construct a canal from Shipley to a place in Bradford called Hoppy Bridge, which is now below Forster Square. They could also build reservoirs, and take water from various brooks.

The canal ran for , dropping by through 10 locks on its way from Bradford to Shipley. Abraham Balme, one of the original promoters, oversaw the construction, with John Longbotham giving engineering advice. The locks on the canal were , and could accommodate boats drawing . The sizes were the same as those of the neighbouring Leeds and Liverpool. The work was completed by March 1774, when Mr Balme paid for the bell ringers of Bradford to ring out his arrival by boat. The Leeds and Liverpool opened from Bingley to Thackley in the same month. The opening was a year later than planned, and the canal had cost £9,424 14s 2d to build, about £3,500 over budget.

Initially the main cargo was stone, as a number of kilns were built beside the canal by the Bradford Lime Kiln Company and limestone was brought from Skipton. Coal pit owners on the south side of Bradford in Broomfields and Bowling built tramways into the town, but there was no direct connection with the canal as possible routes were blocked by buildings. In about 1790 the newly established Bowling Iron Works constructed a wagon-way from its works in Bowling to Staithes at Golden Lyon Yard about 200 yards south of the canal basin. Finished iron products and coal were exported from the town by the canal via the wagon-way. The carriage of wool from Australia was an important source of revenue from the 1820s, and from 1828, packet boats carried passengers to Selby and Leeds.

===Difficulties===
Water supply was a significant issue for the canal company. As Bradford grew, the basin was surrounded by housing, and pollution from sewage occurred. Further down, mills drew water from the canal, used it for industrial processes, and returned it to the canal. The company had bought up tracts of land at the end of the 18th century, to obtain water rights, and had dammed Bradford Beck, despite the fact that their authorising act of Parliament had specifically excluded it as a source of water. The Bradford Board of Surveyors commented on the filth and stench in a report made in 1844, and an outbreak of cholera five years later, in which 406 people died, prompted the city council to take action. A wide-ranging sanitation bill was prepared, which included a clause to buy the canal and close it. The action would be funded by a £100,000 public loan. The bill went before Parliament, but concerted opposition by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, the Aire and Calder Navigation, the Bradford Canal and other industrialists succeeded in reducing the amount of the loan to £50,000, which was insufficient to enable the canal to be purchased.

Hot weather in 1864 led to a fund being opened, so that a court order could be used to close the canal, on the basis that it was a public nuisance. A local newspaper, &quot;The Bradford Observer&quot;, described it as &quot;that seething cauldron of all impurity, the Bradford Canal.&quot; Although the company argued that the water was polluted before it entered the canal, an injunction prevented them from taking water from the Bradford Beck after 6 November 1866. An offer by the Leeds and Liverpool Canal to take it over and clean it up was rejected by those who had brought the court order. Closure was postponed until 1 May 1867, while both the Bradford Company and the Leeds and Liverpool attempted to obtain an act of Parliament, but both failed, and so the canal closed and was drained.

With no means to transport their stone, several merchants started to negotiate with the Leeds and Liverpool, the Aire and Calder and Bradford Council. A new company, called the Bradford Canal Company Limited, was formed, and bought most of the canal from the old company for £2,500. The section above Northbrook Bridge was sold to developers, and on 21 March 1870, the old company was wound up. The new company expected to get a water supply from two reservoirs and three streams, and hoped to supplement this with a pipeline running from the top of the Leeds and Liverpool&#x27;s Bingley locks. This suggestion was refused, and they resorted to building steam pumping engines at each lock, to pump water up the canal. The section from Shipley to Oliver Lock was reopened in 1872, five years to the day since it had closed, and the top section was reopened the following April. Although the stone traffic, which had been around 125,000 tons per year prior to closure, returned, most of the other traffic had moved to the railway, and did not.

Receipts were inadequate to make the canal pay, and so the owners sold it to a coalition of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal and the Aire and Calder Navigation. They received £27,000, and the buyers also redeemed a £5,000 mortgage. The sale was authorised by the &#x27; (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. clvi), and the new Bradford Canal Company was dissolved. Traffic rose from 80,674 tons in 1888 to 102,390 tons in 1910, but profits were minimal due to the cost of maintenance. Traffic decreased during the First World War, and was down to 38,821 tons in 1920. With no obvious way to return the canal to profit, a bill to abandon the canal was submitted to Parliament in 1921, but was opposed by West Riding County Council, Bradford Corporation, and the Bradford Chamber of Commerce. A second attempt the following year was successful, with the &#x27; (12 &amp; 13 Geo. 5. c. xxix) being passed in June 1922. Closure occurred on 25 June, with just the section from the Leeds and Liverpool canal to the bottom of the first lock being retained, to be used as moorings. Subsequently, much of the canal&#x27;s route has been built upon and filled in. Apart from the junction, several of the bridges which once spanned it are still visible in whole or in part. Near the site of the first lock is a lock keepers cottage and the pumping station building, which has been restored and is used as a dwelling.

==Regeneration plan==
In the early years of the 21st century, there is a plan to rebuild the Bradford Canal.
Among of the many projects conceived in connection with Bradford&#x27;s bid to be European Capital of Culture for 2008 (which competition was actually won by Liverpool), one was a scheme to recreate the Bradford Canal. In 2004 Bradford Council, British Waterways, and Bradford Centre Regeneration jointly established a committee to investigate the possibilities of a new canal. According to &quot;Canal Road News&quot;, a full feasibility study has &quot;concluded that reinstating Bradford Canal is feasible, represents value for money, and opens considerable development opportunities along the five-kilometre canal corridor&quot;.

Issue 1 of &quot;Canal Road News&quot; shows a map of the proposed canal: it more or less follows the original path from the Leeds and Liverpool Canal as far as Queens Road bridge. But south of that bridge the map shows it crossing Canal Road, and continuing on the west (city) side of that road, past the Conditioning House and finishing at the proposed Channel Urban Village. The plan shows 11 locks. Another noteworthy item on the map, not directly related to the canal, is a potential Manningham station on the Airedale Line.

According to a newspaper article of April 2006, &quot;Ambitious plans for a new canal between Shipley and Bradford have been given a cautious welcome by members of the construction industry. … After the presentation, many of the audience said the plans were exciting and could stimulate regeneration. But others were more cautious and questioned where funding would come from.&quot; By April 2010, Bradford Council owned 63 per cent of the route of the renewed canal, and was considering how best to acquire the rest, which was in private ownership at the time. A feasibility study by the civil engineers Arup and the architects Lathams identified the potential for regeneration that such a scheme would have.

<doc id="923121" wikidata="Q17154" url="?curid=923121" title="Gothic Quarter, Barcelona">
<text>The Gothic Quarter ( or ; ) is the historic centre of the old city of Barcelona. It stretches from La Rambla to Via Laietana, and from the Mediterranean seafront to the Ronda de Sant Pere. It is a part of Ciutat Vella district.

The quarter encompasses the oldest parts of the city of Barcelona, and includes the remains of the city&#x27;s Roman wall and several notable medieval landmarks. Much of the present-day fabric of the quarter, however, dates to the 19th and early 20th centuries. &quot;El Call&quot;, the medieval Jewish quarter, is located within this area, along with the former &quot;Sinagoga Major&quot;.

The &quot;Barri Gòtic&quot; retains a labyrinthine street plan, with many small streets opening out into squares. Most of the quarter is closed to regular traffic although open to service vehicles and taxis.

==Authenticity ==

Despite its name, a number of landmark Gothic buildings in the neighborhood do not date to the Middle Ages. Rather, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the quarter was completely transformed from a sombre neighborhood to a tourist attraction through a massive restoration project, timed to be completed for the 1929 International Exhibition. This allowed the city and the surrounding region of Catalonia to portray itself in a positive light to the world&#x27;s media. Further restoration of existing buildings and the creation of brand new neo-Gothic structures continued as late as the 1960s.

Among the principal buildings with rebuilt or modified with neo-Gothic additions are:
*The façade of the Barcelona Cathedral: constructed between 1882 and 1913 by Josep Oriol Mestres and August Font i Carreras with a profusion of Gothic-style elements. 
*Building of the &quot;Centre Excursionista de Catalunya&quot; () on Carrer Paradís: work by Lluís Domènech i Montaner carried out in 1922 on a building of uncertain origins, to which he added Gothic windows, battlements, and merlons. 
*The Flamboyant-style bridge that crosses Carrer Bisbe between the Palau de la Generalitat and the Cases dels Canonges: newly constructed 1928 by Joan Rubió.
*Casa Padellàs: currently the Barcelona City History Museum headquarters, the building was built circa 1500 on Carrer Mercaders, but it was moved to the Plaça del Rei in 1931 with its interior rebuilt.
*Aguilar Palace: present-day Museu Picasso (Carrer Montcada), restored by Adolf Florensa in 1959, who added galleries with arches and Gothic windows. 
*Pignatelli Palace: present-day Royal Artistic Circle of Barcelona, restored in 1970 including the addition of various Gothic windows retrieved from municipal warehouses.

<doc id="923123" wikidata="Q13680" url="?curid=923123" title="Caltanissetta">
<text>Caltanissetta (; or ) is a &quot;comune&quot; (municipality) in the central interior of Sicily, Italy, and the capital of the province of Caltanissetta. Its inhabitants are called &quot;nisseni&quot;.

In 2024, the city had a population of 58,034. It is the 14th largest municipality in Italy measured by area, the sixth highest municipality in Italy by elevation (568 m), the second highest in elevation in Sicily after the city of Enna (912 m).

Its patron saint is Archangel Michael.

==Geography==
The town lies in an area of rolling hills with small villages and towns, crossed by the River Salso. It borders on the municipalities of Canicattì, Delia, Enna, Marianopoli, Mazzarino, Mussomeli, Naro, Petralia Sottana, Pietraperzia, San Cataldo, Santa Caterina Villarmosa, Serradifalco and Sommatino. Its &quot;frazioni&quot; (hamlets) are the villages of Bifaria, Borgo Petilia, Borgo Canicassè Casale, Cozzo di Naro, Favarella, Prestianni, Villaggio Santa Barbara, Santa Rita and Xirbi.

===Territory===
Caltanissetta dominates the whole valley of the River Salso, which extends to include the nearby Enna. Morphologically it matches the surrounding area, very harsh and composed of limestone and clay. The city lies between three hills (Sant&#x27;Anna, Monte San Giuliano, and Poggio Sant&#x27;Elia), which form a basin which comprise part of the historical centre and South.

===The &quot;Maccalube&quot; of Terrapelata===
The &quot;Maccalube&quot; (singular: &quot;Maccaluba&quot;, from Arabic &quot;maqlūbah&quot;, &#x27;(a land) that turns over&#x27;, from the verb &quot;qalaba&quot; &#x27;to turn over, to turn upside down, to invert&#x27;) are a particularly rare phenomenon of sedimentary volcanism occurring in the Terrapelata area of Caltanissetta, the so-called Hill of the Volcanoes, near the village of Santa Barbara. This is an area of barren hills, with a colour ranging from white to dark grey, where mud volcanoes of around one meter in height rest on volcanic sediment. The phenomenon is related to the presence of extensive underground clay deposits, interspersed with layers of salt water. Maccaluba is created by ejection of methane gas bubbles under pressure. When gas breaks through the clay deposits, it creates channels as it rises to the surface. These channels permit the clay sediment and water to travel, especially when they are pressured from beneath. The consistency of the soft clay and water &#x27;sludge&#x27; erupting as a mixture then forms a clay cone on the surface, the top of which is similar in appearance to a volcanic crater. These formations remains soft for some time, unlike the igneous rock eruptions and cones often associated with volcanoes such as Mount Etna.

====The Maccalube Emergency of August 2008====
On 20 August 2008 a State of Emergency was declared because of events involving the Santa Barbara district in Caltanissetta in the preceding days. During the morning of August 11, 2008, geological instability caused the opening of rifts in the ground surface, varying from ten centimetres to a metre in diameter. Damage to buildings occurred in two areas up to distant, the Maccalube and in the western part of the City Centre. These damages were made worse by an eruption of clay-mud, water and gas which occurred some hours later that same day. For seven minutes, a sizable eruption created a mud deposit thick and wide, across a large area. On August 19, the first manifestations of further Maccalube eruptions appeared on top of the mud layer, where water and mud had been ejected by the previous eruption.

The Terrapelata phenomenon has been known for at least two centuries. The local Abbot, Salvatore Li Volsi (1797–1834), an expert in natural and agricultural sciences, wrote &quot;Sul vulcano aereo di Terrapilata in Caltanissetta&quot; (&#x27;Regarding the aerial volcano of Terrapelata in Caltanissetta&#x27;). He describes similar events which had occurred between 1783 and 1823, which he attributed to large-scale instability in the area. In recent decades these events have gradually become less violent, creating relatively inactive Maccalube, rather than violent eruptions and rifts in the terrain. As of September 2008: 68 craters out of 98 were said to be active; 17 were dormant; those remaining were thought to have solidified.

The events of August 11 are similar to those of February 14 and 15, 2002. Those of August were characteristic of a more severe eruption and of instability of the terrain beneath the populated area of the town. These events had, in the past, extended even further into the city area; but they had never before happened at the same time as eruptions.

==History==

Caltanissetta&#x27;s origins can be traced back to 406 BC, when admiral Nicia of Hamilcar&#x27;s siege force from Carthage established a fort at the site, later called &quot;Castra Nicia&quot; (Fort Nicia).

After the Second Punic War, &quot;Castra Nicia&quot; came under Roman rule, but as in the rest of Sicily, the influence of the invaders remained superficial.

In 829 AD, the city was occupied by the Saracens. The Carthaginian name, similar to the Arabic word &quot;nisā’&quot; (meaning &#x27;women&#x27;) resulted in the Saracen name &quot;Qal‘at al-Nisā’&quot; (&#x27;Fort of the Women&#x27;), since Italianized to &quot;Caltanissetta&quot;. The settlement was captured by the Normans in 1086. A charter was granted to the town in accordance with Count Roger Borsa&#x27;s vast plan for the urbanisation of Sicily, and the urban plan that is still in evidence today was laid out. It is during this time that cannoli is believed to have been invented here.

After the Norman occupation the city was under the rule of the Hohenstaufen, the Anjou and the Aragonese kings, who gave it the title of &#x27;County&#x27;. It was here that Frederick II of Sicily was proclaimed king. The city was the seat of another Parliament which aimed to settle the disputes which had arisen during the reign of Frederick III (1355–1377).

In 1407, King Martin I ceded the territory of Caltanissetta to Matteo Moncada II, of the noble Spanish House of Montcada, which already owned the estate of Paternò, and subsequently the area fell into great decay. Construction of the Cathedral began in 1539, and, notably, in 1566 a bridge was built over the River Salso. In this period the city began to expand outside the walls, with creation of the new areas of &quot;Santa Flavia&quot;, &quot;San Rocco degli Zingari&quot; and &quot;San Francesco&quot;. These included the medieval village of Arab origin. The areas were separated by two roads which crossed roughly perpendicularly to a central square (now Piazza Garibaldi): the current Corso Vittorio Emanuele (west-east) and the Corso Umberto I (north-south).

On July 8, 1718, the city was assaulted by Piedmontese troops, causing large loss of life to the population. In 1787 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe visited Caltanissetta.

In 1812, the Moncada seignory ended after a rule of 406 years, when the feudal constitution was abolished and Caltanissetta was turned into the 22nd Comarca of Sicily. In 1819 the city was declared to be the Capital of the province. However one year later it was sacked as a punishment for its loyalty to the House of Bourbon. In 1844 it was elevated to a Bishopric seat.

After many Nisseni had taken part in his Thousands deeds, Giuseppe Garibaldi entered the city, together with Cesare Abba and Alexandre Dumas. On October 22 of the same year a Plebiscite declared Caltanissetta to be part of the new Kingdom of Italy.

After the unification of Italy the area experienced an economic boom, largely due to extensive mining of sulfur. The mining was accompanied by various misfortunes: on the 27th of April 1867 47 people died due to a fire-damp explosion in the &quot;Trabonella&quot; mine; 65 miners died on November 12, 1881, in &quot;Gessolungo&quot; mine because of an explosion; and another 51 died in 1911 in &quot;Deliella&quot; and &quot;Trabonella&quot; mines.

In 1875, however, the population rose up against the Prefect, who was subsequently fired. On April 8, 1878, the city was connected to a railway, ending the historical difficulties in reaching it. Three years later the King Umberto I visited Caltanissetta along with his wife Margherita of Savoy and his son Victor Emmanuel III.
During the Second World War, as part of the Allied landing in Sicily (in July 1943), Caltanissetta suffered several bombings during which 351 civilians were killed. On July 10, 1943, U.S. 3rd Infantry troops landed in Licata and 8 days later, on 18 July they entered and occupied the city. The U.S. 1st infantry landed in Gela some hours later and advanced toward Catania to meet the U.S 45th Infantry, which had landed near Scoglitti.

==Government==
==Economy==
Caltanissetta&#x27;s economy remained heavily reliant on agriculture until the 19th century, when sulfur mining industry began extensively. 275 sulfur mines were created in the province, employing 32,000 workers. Fratelli Averna S.p.A, a firm in the city, produces the Amaro Averna, a liqueur sold throughout Italy and beyond.

==Main sights==

The city&#x27;s monuments include:
*&quot;Palazzo Moncada&quot;: erected in 1635 by the Count Guglielmo Moncada. This was not completed as Guglielmo left Sicily upon his appointment as Viceroy of Valencia. The façade is finely decorated with noteworthy friezes, in zoomorphic and anthropomorphic baroque styles.

*Cathedral of Santa Maria la Nova: built between the years 1560–1620, was opened to the public in 1622. The façade was only completed in the year 1840. The church has a late-Renaissance appearance that breaks the characteristic Baroque mold usual to Sicily. The interior features frescoes by Guglielmo Borremans, who worked there from 1722. Other works include a wooden &quot;Blessed Virgin&quot; draped with silver lamina (1760) and a poly-chromatic wooden statue of St. Michael the Archangel by the sculptor Stefano Li Volsi, which is located in a large aisle chapel, along with two marble statues portraying &quot;Archangels Gabriel&quot; and &quot;Raphael&quot;, sculpted by Vincenzo Vitaliano. The Treasury houses a fine silver monstrance from the 15th century.
*&quot;Sant&#x27;Agata al Collegio&quot;: church built alongside Jesuit college (collegio). The main altar built with poly-chrome marbles was built between 1600 and 1610, in late-Renaissance style, on the site of a previous church, which had also been dedicated to St. Agatha. The façade was created by Natale Masuccio, and is decorated with frameworks on a light coloured background. It has a Greek cross plant, with splendid Baroque decorations including frescoes by Luigi Borremans (18th century). The work on the adjacent Jesuit College began in 1589 and were completed in the second half of the 19th century.

*&quot;San Sebastiano&quot;: church dates from the 16th century and is located in Piazza Garibaldi, in front of the Cathedral. It was built as a tribute to said Saint by the people in gratitude for deliverance from the plague. In 1711 it was altered along its whole length to make space for the Piazza Garibaldi. As a result, a new façade was designed by Pasquale Saetta in the late 19th century. It is embellished with columns employing all three classical architectural orders: Doric bases, Ionicin central sections and Corinthian crowns. There are also niches containing statues of the sculptor Francesco Biangardi, who worked in Caltanissetta during the late 19th century. The centre sculptures represent the saints Peter and Paul; the upper band shows &quot;San Sebastiano&quot; pierced with arrows, being created in memory of his martyrdom.
*&quot;San Domenico&quot;: church (16th century, with a convex façade from the 18th century), houses noteworthy paintings by Borremans and Filippo Paladino&#x27;s (&quot;Madonna del Rosario&quot;). Paladini&#x27;s painting depicting the &quot;Madonna del Carmelo&quot; is now situated in the Cathedral.
*&quot;Palazzo Vescovile&quot; (&#x27;Bishop&#x27;s Palace&#x27;) is the seat of the Museum of Sacred Art. It has a painting by Gian Battista Corradini of the &quot;Madonna del Rosario&quot; (1614).
*&quot;Santa Croce&quot; (&#x27;Holy Cross&#x27;): church dates originally from the 17th century, though substantially altered since.

Caltanissetta has three museums: the Diocesan Museum; the Mineralogical Museum; the Regional Archeological Museum. The latter holds displays mostly from prehistoric times and includes finds from archeological digs conducted in the 1950s. These include vases and tools from the Bronze Age, and early Sicilian ceramics.

Sites in the neighbourhood of Caltanissetta include:
*Castle of Pietrarossa: built using, as its name suggests, largely red stones, dominates the city and the whole Salso Valley from the edge of the ravine upon which it stands. Originally assumed to have been built at the time of Arab rule, it is currently generally accepted that the castle was built by the Byzantines between 750 and 800 AD. During the Middle Ages the castle was a strategic stronghold. Around the end of the 11th century the tomb of Queen Adelasia, niece of the Norman King Roger I, was placed here. In 1378 a Parliament of The Barons was held there, to name the four vicars that were to govern Sicily (Government of the (Four Vicars) Benevento – Quattri Vicari, 1377–1410). In 1407, the castle become the property of the Moncada family from Spain, and thus began the Castle&#x27;s subsequent period of decline. Having been deemed unsuitable as a noble residence, it was used only for military functions. At the end of the 15th century, the castle dungeons were used as prisons. In 1567 a strong earthquake caused the collapse of the castle. Only the ruins of two towers, still visible today, remained standing.
*Abbazia di Santo Spirito (&#x27;Abbey of the Holy Spirit&#x27;): Romanesque-style monastery built by the Norman Count Ruggero and his wife Queen Adelasia in 1092–1098, was consecrated in 1153. It has been greatly altered in subsequent centuries. The original Romanesque outlines are still identifiable its characteristic semicircular jutting apses can be seen. These are separated by flat pilasters and connected by a series of small arches. The left-hand entrance has a Gothic ogival portal from the 13th century. The lunette once contained a figure of &quot;Christ Blessing&quot;, which was eventually moved inside the Abbey. Notable are the rectangular nave and wooden-beamed ceiling. The walls and the apses have frescoes attributed to the 14th century. The vault of the apse shows a 17th century figure of &quot;Christ Pantocrator&quot;.
*The Archeological Park of Gibil Gabib, on a hill near the city, contains, amongst other things, the defense tower and parts of the perimeter walls dating back to the 6th century.

<doc id="923126" wikidata="Q1861419" url="?curid=923126" title="Thiepval Memorial">
<text>The Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme is a war memorial to 72,337 missing British and South African servicemen who died in the Battles of the Somme of the First World War between 1915 and 1918, with no known grave. It is near the village of Thiepval, Picardy in France. A visitors&#x27; centre opened in 2004. Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, Thiepval has been described as &quot;the greatest executed British work of monumental architecture of the twentieth century&quot;.

==Location==
The Memorial was built approximately to the south-east of the former Thiepval Château, which was located on lower ground, by the side of Thiepval Wood. The grounds of the original château were not chosen as this would have required the moving of graves, dug during the war around the numerous medical aid stations.

==Design and inauguration==
Designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens, the memorial was built between 1928 and 1932 and is the largest Commonwealth Memorial to the Missing in the world. It was inaugurated by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII) in the presence of Albert Lebrun, the President of France, on 1 August 1932. The unveiling ceremony was attended by Lutyens. It was the last of the special memorials in Flanders and Picardy to be unveiled.

The memorial dominates the rural scene and has 16 brick piers, faced with Portland stone. It was originally built using French bricks from Lille but was refaced in 1973 with Accrington brick. The main arch is aligned east to west. The memorial is high above the level of its podium, which to the west is above the level of the adjoining cemetery. It has foundations thick, which were required because of extensive wartime tunnelling beneath the structure.

It is a complex form of memorial arch, comprising interlocking arches of four sizes. Each side of the main arch is pierced by a smaller arch, orientated at a right angle to the main arch. Each side of each of these smaller arches is then pierced by a still smaller arch and so on. The keystone of each smaller arch is at the level of the spring of the larger arch that it pierces; each of these levels is marked by a stone cornice. This design results in 16 piers, having 64 stone-panelled sides. Only 48 of these are inscribed, as the panels around the outside of the memorial are blank.

According to the architectural historian Stephen Games, the memorial is composed of two intersecting triumphal arches, each with a larger central arch and two smaller subsidiary arches, the arches on the east–west facades being taller than those on the north–south, all raised up from what is loosely a square four-by-four tartan grid plan. The main arch is surmounted by a tower. In the central space of the memorial a Stone of Remembrance rests on a three-stepped platform.

The memorial is graven with the names 72,246 officers and men (see below) and Lutyens&#x27;s ingenious geometry arises out of the attempt to display these names in compact form, rather than in the longer, lower and linear form taken by other memorials to the missing of the war, such as those at Loos, Pozières and Arras.

==Inscriptions==
The inscription of names on the memorial is reserved for those missing or unidentified soldiers who have no known grave. A large inscription on an internal surface of the memorial reads:

On the Portland stone piers are engraved the names of over 72,000 men who were lost in the Somme battles between July 1915 and March 1918. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission states that over 90 per cent of these soldiers died in the first Battle of the Somme between 1 July and 18 November 1916. The names are carved using the standard upper-case lettering designed for the commission by MacDonald Gill.

Over the years since its inauguration, bodies have been discovered on the former battlefield and are sometimes identified by various means. The decision was taken that to protect the integrity of the memorial as one solely for those who are missing or unidentified, that if a body were found and identified the inscription of their name would be removed from the memorial by filling in the inscription with cement. For those who are found and identified, they are given a funeral with full military honours at a cemetery close to the location at which they were discovered. This practice has resulted in numerous gaps in the lists of names.

On the top of the archway, a French inscription reads &quot;&quot; (&quot;To the French and British Armies, from the grateful British Empire&quot;). Just below this, are carved the years 1914 and 1918. On the upper edges of the side archways, split across left and right, is carved the phrase &quot;The Missing / of the Somme&quot;.
Included on this memorial are sixteen stone laurel wreaths, inscribed with the names of sub-battles that made up the Battle of the Somme and subsequent actions, in which the men commemorated at Thiepval fell. One is simply titled &#x27;Somme 1916&#x27;. Thirteen battles so-named on the other roundels are Ancre Heights, Ancre, Albert, High Wood, Delville Wood, Morval, Flers–Courcelette, Pozières Wood, Bazentin Ridge, Thiepval Ridge, Transloy Ridges, Ginchy, and Guillemont. The final two roundels are for &#x27;Bapaume&#x27; and &#x27;Miraumont&#x27;, most likely referring to battles or actions on the Somme front in 1917 as the Thiepval Memorial includes the missing dead that fell before 20 March 1918. The Actions of Miraumont took place from 17 to 18 February 1917 and Bapaume was occupied by the British on 17 March 1917 (see Operations on the Ancre, January–March 1917).

==Notable people commemorated on the memorial==

==Anglo-French memorial==

The Thiepval Memorial also serves as an Anglo-French battle memorial to commemorate the joint nature of the 1916 offensive. In further recognition of this, a cemetery, Thiepval Anglo-French Cemetery, containing 300 British Commonwealth and 300 French graves lies at the foot of the memorial. Most of the soldiers buried here – 239 of the British Commonwealth and 253 of the French – are unknown, the bodies having been reburied here after discovery between December 1931 and March 1932, mostly from the Somme battlefields but some from as far north as Loos and as far south as Le Quesnel. The British Commonwealth graves have rectangular headstones made of white stone, while the French graves have grey stone crosses. For those unidentified, the British headstones bear the inscription &quot;A Soldier of the Great War / Known unto God&quot;, the French crosses bear the single word &quot;&quot; (&#x27;unknown&#x27;). The cemetery&#x27;s Cross of Sacrifice bears an inscription that acknowledges the joint British and French contributions

==Ceremonies and services==
Each year on 1 July (the anniversary of the first day on the Somme) a major ceremony is held at the memorial. There is also a ceremony on 11 November, beginning at 1045 CET.

<text>The Château de Chavaniac aka Chateau Lafayette is a fortified manor house of eighteen rooms furnished in the Louis XIII style located in Chavaniac-Lafayette, Haute-Loire, in Auvergne province, France.

Flanked by two towers of black stone, it was built in the 14th century and was the birthplace of General Lafayette in 1757.

In 1916, a group of wealthy philanthropists led by Scottish-born American industrialist John C. Moffat purchased the castle to serve as a center of philanthropy for people affected by World War I. Following the war he renovated it completely to preserve documents and objects relating to General Lafayette.

The Château de Chavaniac is now a museum open to the public.

== History ==

The Château de Chavaniac was constructed in the 14th century. 

It was partially destroyed by a fire in 1701. General Lafayette was born here in 1757. He was married in 1774 to Adrienne de Noailles. They had four children together: Henriette, who died at a young age, Anastasie, Georges and Virginie who lived in the castle. A hero of the American and French revolutions, he was rejected by the French revolutionaries when he voted against the death of King Louis XVI. With the fall of the monarchy, he tried to flee to the United States through the Dutch Republic. He was captured by Austrians and was made prisoner by Austria at the fortress of Olmütz. He was considered a traitor for not saving the life of Marie-Antoinette, an Austrian by birth, and the king. Lafayette returned to France in 1797. The château was restored to Lafayette in 1791 but sold by the French Republic when Lafayette fled the country. His aunt later bought the château.

In December 1916, a group of philanthropists led by John C. Moffat, and including William A. Chanler, Joseph Choate, Clarence Mackay, George von Lengerke Meyer, John Grier Hibben, and Nicholas Murray Butler, purchased the château for the French Heroes Lafayette Memorial Fund which was managed by Chanler&#x27;s estranged wife Beatrice Ashley Chanler. 

Parts of the château were used as a school, an orphanage and a hospital, known as the Lafayette Preventorium, until 1920, supported by funds from 150,000 donors. During the post-war period, the château was extensively renovated and furnished with memorabilia from Lafayette and other period pieces. The roof was redone, foundations were stabilized, a tower was rebuilt and the south wing was built in the rear with a square tower. During World War II the château was used as a secret hiding place for Jewish children.

John Moffat died in 1966 and was buried with his wife on the grounds of château. The Lafayette Memorial Association Inc. took over management of the château. The museum was renovated in the 1990s with the sponsorship of Merck Sharp Chemical Co. In 2007 the Lafayette Preventorium became a separate institute, the Institut thérapeutique, éducatif et pédagogique. In 2009, the Conseil Général de la Haute-Loire took over management of the château and repaired the roof.

The French and American flags fly permanently over the château in honor of the key role Lafayette played in the French and American revolutions.

== Architecture ==
The Château de Chavaniac framed by two towers of black rock from Auvergne was constructed in the 14th century. The château and the interior decoration were listed as historic monuments by France on August 21, 1989.

In the entrance one finds a great staircase, a gallery with painted murals, a Louis XIII dining room, and a guardroom. The first floor has a grand salon, a library, and the family&#x27;s bedrooms. The second floor has a great hall and the master bedroom with a bathroom and a sauna. The Franco-American friendship room is found on the fourth floor.

<doc id="923132" wikidata="Q226050" url="?curid=923132" title="Celtic League">
<text>The Celtic League is a pan-Celtic organization, founded in 1961, that aims to promote modern Celtic identity and culture in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Brittany, Cornwall and the Isle of Man – referred to as the Celtic nations; it places particular emphasis on promoting the Celtic languages of those nations. It also advocates further self-governance in the Celtic nations and ultimately for each nation to be an independent state in its own right. The Celtic League is an accredited NGO with roster consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council (EcoSoc).

==Aims==
The Celtic League presents its aims as including: 
* &quot;Fostering co-operation between Celtic peoples.&quot;
* &quot;Developing the consciousness of the special relationship and solidarity between them.&quot;
* &quot;Making our national struggles and achievements better known abroad.&quot;
* &quot;Campaigning for a formal association of Celtic nations to take place once two or more of them have achieved self-government.&quot;
* &quot;Advocating the use of the national resources of each of the Celtic countries for the benefit of all its people.&quot;

&quot;Each Celtic nation is conditioned by a different history and so we must not expect uniformity of thought, but instead allow diversity to express itself within the Celtic League. In this way, we may better recognise those areas of possible co-operation and eventually formulate a detailed common policy. With this we can work out which kind of relations between our communities will enable them to enjoy freedoms and liberties at both individual and community level.&quot;

Politically, the Celtic league seeks to create six sovereign states from the six Celtic nations it acknowledges as existing, associated in some way. There is some variation in the understanding of these aims, which ranges from annual general meetings (AGMs), to an actual federation along the lines of the Nordic Council.

The 1987 Celtic League Annual General Meeting stated that it: &quot;firmly reiterates that the Celtic League has a specific function within Celtia, i.e. to work for the reinstatement of our languages to a viable position, and the attainment of sufficient economic, cultural and political autonomy to guarantee the survival of our civilisation into the 21st century. This emphasis on the languages of our six nations marks us now as distinct cultural communities, and therefore as distinct nations.&quot;

==History==
Founded in 1961, the present Celtic League grew out of various other pan-Celtic organisations, particularly the Celtic Congress, but with a more political emphasis. Previously, Hugh MacDiarmid and others had suggested something along the same lines.

The Celtic League was started at the 1961 National Eisteddfod of Wales, which was held at Rhosllannerchrugog near Wrexham in northeast Wales. Two of the founding members were Gwynfor Evans and J. E. Jones, who were respectively president and secretary-general of the Welsh nationalist political party Plaid Cymru at the time. Interest was expressed by Scottish parties, and also by Breton nationalists.

==Branches==
There are six main, national branches of the Celtic League in the six Celtic countries, generally known by the Celtic language names of their countries: Ireland is known as &quot;Éire&quot;, Scotland as &quot;Alba&quot;, Wales as &quot;Cymru&quot;, Brittany as &quot;Breizh&quot;, Cornwall as &quot;Kernow&quot; and the Isle of Man as &quot;Mannin&quot; or &quot;Mann&quot;.

When concluding against the inclusion of the allegedly historically Celtic regions Galicia and Asturias (Asturies) in Spain, the 1987 Celtic League Annual General Meeting stated that, because the Celtic League&#x27;s specific function, &quot;to work for the reinstatement of our languages ... and the attainment of ... political autonomy&quot;, must remain undiluted, &quot;this AGM considers that it would be condescending and inappropriate to offer a limited status to the applicant nations [i.e., Galicia and Asturias] within the Celtic League.&quot; The AGM expressed that it &quot;encourage[s] them in their efforts to develop the Celtic elements in their heritage&quot; such that &quot;from such areas, might come the support and understanding we need to pursue our aims more effectively&quot; (in Spain, there are no surviving Celtic languages, although in Galicia there is a minority nationalist movement which seeks independence from the Spanish Kingdom and promotes a Celtic identity as a fundamental aspect of Galician culture).

There are various diaspora branches, that play little part in the annual general meetings:

A Patagonian branch was founded in the Chubut River Valley, Argentina (the location of y Wladfa, a Welsh colony), at the end of 2009; it remained active , with Mónica Jones as secretary and her husband Michael Jones filling an unspecified post.

Celtic League, American Branch (CLAB) was founded in New York City in 1974, and has its own newsletter, but reported decreased activity , the same year its domain name, CelticLeague.org, was lost to a cybersquatter. CLAB organized various annual events, including the Pan-Celtic Conference.

There is a generalized International Branch for &quot;[t]hose living far away from the national branches&quot;, including prospective Spanish members in Galicia and Asturias; it was active with a website, Celtic-League.org (operated from the Isle of Man), from 2004 through 2010. There has been a separate England Branch, based in London, active at least from 2004 to 2007. There used to be a branch in Cape Breton Island, Canada, where a small Scottish Gaelic-speaking community still exists; this branch was moribund , though various consultations had taken place in efforts to restart it. The branch was then recorded as being active by 22 January 2015.

==Publications==
The Celtic League publishes a quarterly magazine, &quot;Carn&quot;, which highlights political struggles and cultural preservation issues. The articles are produced in the six Celtic languages in addition to English. The cover of the magazine is a map of the six Celtic countries with their respective Celtic-language names beside them. In the past, articles have appeared in French as well. For many years, Carn claimed to be the only regular publication carrying all six Celtic languages.

The Celtic League, American Branch (CLAB) prints its own quarterly newsletter, &quot;Six Nations, One Soul&quot;, which provides news of branch activities and events within the Celtic communities in the United States, publishes letters from members, and reviews books and recordings of Celtic interest. CLAB published at least six issues of a larger semi-annual magazine, &quot;Keltoi: A Pan-Celtic Review&quot;,from 2006 to 2008. CLAB also produced a wall calendar each year, with art from members, appropriate quotations, and anniversaries; publication ceased with the 2008 issue.

Other branches have published their own periodicals from time to time, but few have been very long-lived.

===Notable members and former members===
Some of the more notable past and present members of the Celtic League have been Plaid Cymru leaders Gwynfor Evans and J. E. Jones, Scottish National Party leaders Winnie Ewing, Robert McIntyre and Rob Gibson, leader of Sinn Féin Ruairí Ó Brádaigh, prominent Breton exiles Yann Fouéré and Alan Heusaff, the historian and writer Peter Berresford Ellis, writer Bernard Le Nail, and Manx language revivalist Brian Stowell.

American author and linguist Alexei Kondratiev was president of the Celtic League American branch.

===Campaigns===
The Celtic League also campaigns for a united Ireland, and the return of the Loire-Atlantique department to Brittany. Over the years, the Celtic League has campaigned consistently in support of the languages in Celtic nations, and for the return of ancient artefacts, removed from Celtic countries to museums outside of these areas – amongst these are the Lewis chessmen and the Chronicles of Mann.

The Manx branch of the Celtic League successfully campaigned for the Calf of Man island to be transferred from the National Trust of England, Wales and Northern Ireland to the local Manx National Heritage.

In the mid-1990s, the Celtic League started a campaign to have the word &quot;Alba&quot; on the Scottish football and rugby tops. Since 2005, the Scottish Football Association have supported the use of Scottish Gaelic on their teams&#x27;s strip in recognition of the language&#x27;s revival in Scotland. However, the SRU is still being lobbied to have &quot;Alba&quot; on the national rugby strip.

The Celtic League has also passed a motion to support the general aims of Independence First, which aims for a referendum on Scottish independence.

<doc id="923136" wikidata="Q692550" url="?curid=923136" title="Michael Kahn (film editor)">
<text>Michael Kahn (born December 8, ) is an American film editor known for his frequent collaboration with Steven Spielberg. His first collaboration with Spielberg was for his 1977 film, &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. He has edited all of Spielberg&#x27;s subsequent films except for &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), which was edited by Carol Littleton. Kahn has received eight Academy Award nominations for Best Film Editing, and has won three times—for &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993), and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998), which were all Spielberg-directed films.

== Early life ==
Kahn was born to a Jewish family in New York City. While his birth year has been reported as 1935, Kahn said in 2015, when asked if he was 80, that his age at that point was &quot;closer to 85.&quot;

== Career == 
Kahn has edited digitally since at least &quot;Twister&quot; (1996), though he continued to edit on film with Spielberg long after most editors had stopped doing so. In 2008, Kahn acknowledged that &quot;people find it hard to believe that Steven and I still edit film on a Moviola and a KEM. [But] Steven feels film got us where we are today and he loves the smell of it and feel of it. We started that way and both really enjoy it.&quot; George Lucas remarked &quot;Michael Kahn can cut faster on a Moviola than anybody can cut on an Avid.&quot; However, since &quot;The Adventures of Tintin: The Secret of the Unicorn&quot; (2011), Kahn has edited Spielberg&#x27;s films on an Avid machine.

==Filmography==
== Awards and nominations ==
Kahn equaled the record for the most Oscar wins (three) in the Best Film Editing category, shared with Ralph Dawson, Daniel Mandell, and Thelma Schoonmaker. Furthermore, he had eight nominations in that category—a number surpassed only by Schoonmaker. All of Kahn&#x27;s Oscars came from his work on Spielberg&#x27;s films, which included &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot; (1981), &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot; (1993), and &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; (1998).

He has received six nominations for the BAFTA Award for Best Editing, winning for &quot;Fatal Attraction&quot; (1987) and &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;. 

Kahn has been selected for membership in the American Cinema Editors (ACE). In 2011, he received the Career Achievement Award of the American Cinema Editors. At the ceremony, Steven Spielberg said of editing: &quot;this is where filmmaking goes from a craft to an art.&quot; In November 2013, Spielberg created the Michael Kahn Endowed Chair in Editing at the University of Southern California&#x27;s School of Cinematic Arts in honor of Kahn. The first to be appointed to the position was Norman Hollyn.

<doc id="923145" wikidata="Q1419532" url="?curid=923145" title="First Quantum Minerals">
<text>First Quantum Minerals is a Canadian-based mining and metals company whose principal activities include mineral exploration, development and mining. Its main product is copper, which accounts for 80% of revenues as of 2016.

First Quantum&#x27;s common shares are listed for trading on the Toronto Stock Exchange in Canada (symbol &quot;FM&quot;). Until 2016, First Quantum also maintained a secondary listing on the London Stock Exchange (symbol &quot;FQM&quot;), in the United Kingdom.

== History==
First Quantum was founded in 1983 under the name Xenium Resources. It changed its name to Zeal Capital in 1989, First Quantum Ventures in 1993, and First Quantum Minerals in 1996. Its first significant operation was the Bwana Mkubwa mine in Zambia, acquired in 1996.

In 2000, First Quantum acquired a partial interest in Mopani Copper Mines, a Zambian copper company. In 2001, it opened the Lonshi Copper Mine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Also in 2001, the company acquired the Kansanshi mine in Zambia.

In 2006 First Quantum acquired London-based Adastra Minerals for in cash and stock. In 2008, First Quantum acquired Toronto-based &quot;Scandinavian Minerals Ltd&quot; developing the Kevitsa mine in Lapland, northern Finland. In December 2009, First Quantum acquired the Ravensthorpe Nickel Mine in Western Australia for US$340 million from BHP Billiton. In October 2010, First Quantum announced plans to acquire Antares Minerals for $450 million. In November 2010, First Quantum sold its stake in Equinox Minerals. In April 2013, First Quantum successfully completed a hostile takeover of Inmet Mining for CAD$5.1 billion. In June 2013, it was announced that FQM would have to lay off 500 workers at the Sentinel mine in Zambia as it could not sustain their upkeep while waiting for the lifting of a protection order on its operations from the Zambia Environmental Management Agency.

In 2016, it sold the Kevista mine to Boliden AB for US$712 million. In March 2017 First Quantum announced it had launched a $1.6 billion offering of Senior Notes due 2023 and 2025. In December 2017, First Quantum was announced as &quot;the major mining company that will complete the Pebble Limited Partnership&quot; by Ron Thiessen, president and CEO of Northern Dynasty Minerals Ltd., which is currently the sole owner of the Pebble Partnership.

In 2016, First Quantum was ranked as being among the 13th best of 92 oil, gas, and mining companies on indigenous rights in the Arctic.

In December 2019, Chinese state company Jiangxi Copper agreed to buy a subsidiary of First Quantum&#x27;s largest shareholder, Pangaea Investment Management Ltd, which holds 17.6 percent of First Quantum, causing shares to spike up to five percent.

=== Panama ===

In January 2022, negotiations between the Government of Panama and FQM started to define a new contract concerning the Cobre mine, Panama. First Quantum&#x27;s subsidiary Minera Panamá S. A. made proposals to the Government of Panamá including yearly payments of US$375 million in tax and royalty revenue. These payments were offered under the condition that metal prices and profitability of this mine would not drop significantly. However, the Government of Panamá halted discussions in December 2022 and announced plans to order the suspension of operations at this mine.
In February 2023, the Cobre Panama mine suspended ore processing operations after copper concentrate loading operations at Port Rincón were haltet due to a resolution issued by the Panamá Maritime Authority. Ship loading and ore processing resumed on March 8, 2023. The congress of Panamá approved the revised contract concerning the Cobre Panama mine as &quot;Bill 1100&quot; in October 2023, which was signed by the President of Panamá as &quot;Law 406&quot;. Protests led to a moratorium on metallic mining throughout the country, &quot;for an indefinite term&quot;, excluding already approved concessions, through Bill 1110, which was approved with 59 votes by the National Assembly (AN), on November 3, 2023. However, the constitutionality of the already approved new concession between the Government of Panana and Minera Panamá S. A. was questioned, leading to more uncertainty. These concessions have led to massive protests in many places of the country that are still ongoing, with the protesters accusing the government of corruption and accepting bribes in order to give overly favorable conditions to the company.

FQM reported, that its subsidiary MPSA made a tax and royalty payment on November 16, 2023 of $567 million for the period from December 2021 to October 2023. This payment is one of the largest ever tax and royalty payments in the history of the global copper mining sector and is the largest fiscal payment ever made in Panama. However, an illegal blockade of small boats at the Punta Rincón port continues to prevent the delivery of supplies that are necessary to operate the power plant of the Cobre Panama mine. This blockade forced the mine to temporarily halt production as of November 23, 2023.

On November 28, the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court of Justice declared that Law 406 of October 20, 2023, which approves the mining concession contract entered into between the State and Sociedad Minera Panamá, S.A. is unconstitutional, a ruling issued unanimously. Panama president said the Minera Panamá copper mine would be closed, hours after the country&#x27;s Supreme Court declared its contract unconstitutional.
===Democratic Republic of the Congo===
The Kolwezi tailings project was a major project to extract copper and cobalt from the tailings of older mining operations around Kolwezi. It was expected to produce around 70,000 tonnes per year of copper metal and up to 14,000 tonnes per year of cobalt hydroxide.
In August 2009, the DRC government revoked First Quantum&#x27;s license due to a dispute over renegotiating the contract. First Quantum ceased operations in September 2009, putting 700 people out of work. First Quantum had spent $750 million on acquiring and developing the property. First Quantum took out an action against the DRC government in the International Chamber of Commerce International Court of Arbitration.

The Frontier Mine is an open pit copper mine located near Sakania. 
First Quantum obtained exploration licenses in January 2001 and July 2002. Production began in 2007, and in 2010 the mine yielded 322,700 tonnes of copper. The Lonshi Mine is an open pit copper mine that produces high-grade oxide ore that was transported to Zambia for processing at the Bwana Mkubwa SX/EW plant away. The mine was closed after the governor of Katanga Province, Moses Katumbi, banned the export of ore to Zambia, insisting that it should be refined in Katanga. In May 2010, a Congolese court ruled that FQM&#x27;s Lonshi and Frontier copper mines had been awarded illegally and that they should revert to state-owned Sodimico. According to FQM, the ruling was due to FQM&#x27;s decision to contest the expropriation of its Kolwezi tailings project, which was later sold to the Kazakh mining company Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation.

<text>Caccamo (Sicilian: Càccamu) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; located on the Tyrrhenian coast of Sicily in the Metropolitan City of Palermo.

==History==

The official founding of Caccamo was not until 1093, when the Normans started to build the castle on a rocky spur overlooking a cliff, Castello di Caccamo. The castle itself is actually now being slowly converted into a museum. On the ground level of the castle is a restaurant &quot;A Castellana&quot;. Submerged within the Rosamarina lake is a stone bridge built in 1307 on the road that once linked the town with Palermo. The city contains an attractive 11th-century cathedral, which was remodeled in 1477 and 1614. On the side of the cathedral are two churches. The Chiesa dell&#x27;Anime del Purgatorio &quot;(Church of the Souls of Purgatory)&quot; features some stucco work in the eastern end and an 18th-century organ. In the downstairs are catacombs where the skeletons of a number of townspeople lie in niches along the wall, a burial practice that lasted from the 17th century up to 1863.

Since the 1950s the town itself has lost almost half of its inhabitants to emigration. Caccamo holds some great views of the surrounding countryside, including the Rosmarina artificial lake, which was created by a controversial dam built in 1993.

==Notable people from Caccamo==
* Giovanni &quot;John&quot; Stanfa, Italian-American mobster (former boss of Philadelphia crime family) and uncle of Antonino Giuffrè.
* Antonino &quot;Nino&quot; Giuffrè, Italian mobster (high-ranking member of Corleonesi) and nephew of John Stanfa.

<doc id="923156" wikidata="Q3320632" url="?curid=923156" title="Ankh-Morpork City Watch">
<text>The Ankh-Morpork City Watch is a fictional police force appearing in Terry Prattchett&#x27;s Discworld series. The Watch primarily functions out of the fictional city of Ankh-Morpork, but some stories do include members of the watch elsewhere in the world. 

The watch and its members are the primary topic of 8 novels and one short story, listed below in order of publication.
*&quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; (1989);
*&quot;Theatre of Cruelty&quot; (1993) (short story);
*&quot;Men at Arms&quot; (1993); 
*&quot;Feet of Clay&quot; (1996); 
*&quot;Jingo&quot; (1997); 
*&quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot; (1999);
*&quot;Night Watch&quot; (2002); 
*&quot;Thud!&quot; (2005);
*&quot;Snuff&quot; (2011)

The novels generally feature Watch Commander Sam Vimes as protagonist and often draw on the conventions of crime novels. The Watch and its individual members also appear as secondary characters in many other stories in the Discworld series, especially those set in Ankh-Morpork.

The Watch was also a loose inspiration for the 2021 fantasy police procedural television series &quot;The Watch.&quot;

==Style==
Pratchett&#x27;s Watch has been described as part of a longstanding fantasy tradition wherein the characters of the city watch would &quot;rush in and die, or run away&quot;, with Pratchett&#x27;s approach to that tradition ranging from parody in the earlier novels to &quot;deeper satire&quot; in the later ones.

==Fictional history (before the time in which the novels are set)==
Note: &quot;Some of the information repeated below was taken from &quot;The Discworld Companion&quot; and the &quot;1999 Discworld Diary&quot;, which had a City Watch theme, and has not been confirmed in any of the &quot;Discworld&quot; novels.&quot;

The &quot;Ankh-Morpork Watch &amp; Ward&quot; was founded in AM 1561 by King Veltrick I. They had full copper armour and a copper shield inscribed &quot;Fabricati Diem, Pvncti Agvnt Celeriter&quot; (&quot;Make the Day, the Moments Pass Quickly&quot;, Veltrick&#x27;s motto). Four days later Veltrick&#x27;s son assassinated him, and became Veltrick II. Since he had little interest in maintaining a police force, the equipment of the Watch quickly deteriorated.

At this time there were four separate forces:
* The &quot;Palace Guard&quot;, who guarded the palace.
* The &quot;Cable Street Particulars&quot;, a political police force concentrating on discovering &quot;plots&quot; against the current rulers of the city. The name may have been inspired by the Baker Street Irregulars from the stories of Sherlock Holmes, and perhaps by the Battle of Cable Street, a riot started between Oswald Mosley&#x27;s British Union of Fascists and anti-fascist protesters in 1936. They are also known as The Unmentionables (a colloquial British term for underwear), possibly a parody of The Invincibles, an Irish extremist nationalist group, or of The Untouchables, a prohibition-era law-enforcement group, who served as government intelligence.
* The &quot;Ward&quot;, who acted as gate-guards, thief-takers etc. during the day.
* The &quot;Watch&quot;, who served the same purpose in the hours of darkness. The force comprised one commander, five captains, ten sergeants, forty corporals, lance-corporals, constables and lance-constables, and, in times of emergency, a &quot;citizens militia&quot; of varied size.

Public opinion of the Watches (the Ward became known as the Day Watch) was never high, and reached an all-time low when a Commander, who had told the public not to take the law into their own hands, was thrown onto the Ankh with a cry of &quot;If it&#x27;s not in our hands, whose hands is it in?&quot; The Guilds were policing themselves by this point, so the Watch was becoming increasingly irrelevant.

The Watch had a brief respite in AM 1688, following the Ankh-Morpork Civil War, when Commander Suffer-Not-Injustice Vimes and his Ironheads became the city&#x27;s rulers. However, after he was deposed in favour of the Patricianship, the Watch sank even further into obscurity; he was (until recently) the last Watch Commander. Under the rule of the Patricians, not only did Guild Law apply in the Guilds, but the only laws that applied anywhere else were the whims of the man in charge.

By the time of Homicidal Lord Winder&#x27;s rule as Patrician, only a handful of Watch Houses remained. The Cable Street Particulars were thriving, however, having morphed from an intelligence agency into a secret police force employing torture with gusto. During the Glorious Revolution of the Twenty-Fifth of May, their building was burnt down by members of the Night Watch from Treacle Mine Road. The change in Patricians did not lead to an improvement in the public perception of the Watch, and when Lord Vetinari replaced Mad Lord Snapcase, and even theft was legalised, there seemed to be no point to them at all.

The dysfunctional Night Watch now comprised three men, based in the old Treacle Mine Road Watch House. While the Day Watch had become another of the city&#x27;s gangs, the Night Watch was just inactive.

== History according to plot of novels ==
The Watch became active when Carrot Ironfoundersson became a constable and the Night Watch saved the city from a dragon. After the destruction of the Watch House, they moved to larger premises in Pseudopolis Yard (a name reminiscent of Scotland Yard) and more members joined, especially from ethnic minorities such as dwarfs, trolls and undead. The Watch even admitted a vampire, a werewolf, an Igor and a Nac Mac Feegle. After the Watch saved the Patrician&#x27;s life he agreed to increase its stature, with new Section Houses around the city. The remains of the Day Watch were incorporated into a new City Watch commanded by Sam Vimes.

The Watch became a proper police force, dealing in crime prevention and investigation, rather than just &quot;thief-taking&quot;. They had a forensics section and a Traffic Division, and the Cable Street Particulars had been replaced by a plain-clothes division. 
The recently added &quot;the Specials&quot;, were based on the Watch&#x27;s ancient right to establish a Citizen&#x27;s Militia as needed.

More and more watchmen trained by the City Watch prefer to work in other cities abroad where they can earn good money. They are referred to as &quot;Sammies&quot; (similar to &quot;Bobbies&quot;, a term for British police officers derived from the common abbreviation of the first name of Sir Robert Peel, the man credited with the creation of the first regular, uniformed, police service in the UK) and communicate with each other by telegraph (&quot;clacks&quot;), a reference to real-world Interpol (mentioned in &quot;The Night Watch&quot;).

==Members==

The primary members of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch are (see the linked articles for full details of the characters):

===His Grace, The Duke of Ankh, Commander Sir Samuel Vimes===

Samuel Vimes, Commander of the City Watch, learned dirty tricks as a street copper, and passes them on to new recruits.
Under him, the Watch strengthens its position, and while he makes many enemies, the Assassin&#x27;s Guild has stopped accepting contracts for his assassination.

He marries the richest woman in Ankh-Morpork, Lady Sybil, and has a son with her, young Sam.

===Captain Carrot Ironfoundersson===
Adopted by dwarfs as an infant Carrot grew up in the mines of the Copperhead mountains. He is &quot;six feet tall and nearly as broad across the shoulders&quot;. His dwarfish name is &quot;Kzad-bhat&quot;, which, roughly translated, means &quot;Head Banger&quot;, a logical nickname for a man living in a mine built by dwarfs. He was quite surprised when he was told that he was human. His adoptive father thought it best that he go live among humans, and found him a job in Ankh-Morpork with the Night Watch, believing them respected and respectable. Carrot was &quot;barely 16 years old&quot;. (&quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;)

Carrot joins the Night Watch when it is still a small group of misfits who run from criminals rather than arrest them (&quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;). His old-fashioned view of justice leads him on his first day as a constable to arrest the leader of the entirely legal Thieves&#x27; Guild, but he later understands the city better.

Captain Carrot rapidly and easily comes to know the city&#x27;s one-million population by name and tax status, and is big on paperwork and organization. He always takes the time to see all sides of a story before acting. When Sam Vimes plans to retire after marrying Lady Sybil Ramkin, Carrot becomes his successor, and is described as &quot;the Disc&#x27;s most linear thinker&quot;. He interviews Death in a murder investigation. Carrot becomes famous enough for action figures of him to appear. (&quot;Hogfather&quot;)

Carrot&#x27;s main talents are his charisma and &quot;supernatural likability&quot;. He genuinely likes people, in contrast to Vimes, who &quot;doesn&#x27;t like anybody&quot;. He is often shown getting people to do things no one else could force them to do, simply by assuming that they will: for example, his outreach programs for at-risk Ankh-Morporkian youth treat them like boy scouts. When he directly commands someone, they find it very difficult to disobey. Even Vimes is susceptible to this power. Carrot prefers not to use this except in dire emergencies.

Carrot often seems unthreatening, a dangerous conclusion if one is unlucky enough to disappoint him. People think Carrot is simple, and the narrator occasionally points out that while that is true, people often mistake &quot;simple&quot; for &quot;stupid&quot;. Carrot&#x27;s simplicity is cunning (which he may have learned from Vimes). In &quot;Soul Music&quot;, Carrot adds questions to the quiz machine in the Mended Drum, asking players who was responsible for recent crimes and frequently makes arrests as a result. Carrot sees the bright side of life. When Angua, a werewolf, tells him that her brother Andrei is stuck in wolf form and lives as a champion sheepdog, Carrot notes that he &quot;is&quot; a champion. Carrot has also promised Angua, at her request, that if she ever follows in her brother Wolfgang&#x27;s murderous footsteps, he will be the one to stop her.

It is commonly suspected that Carrot is the true heir to the throne of Ankh-Morpork, but he does not acknowledge it, and has even hidden evidence of his royal heritage. Havelock Vetinari considers him useful, as he makes any attempt to claiming to be the true heir impossible, and any complaints that only a king has the authority to do something can simply be deferred to Carrot.

Carrot himself never uses his royal powers or acknowledges his royal heritage. After he learns about it in &quot;Men at Arms&quot;, he confides to Vetinari that he wants people to obey the law because it is the law, not because &quot;Captain Carrot is good at being obeyed&quot;. He says he is content to ring a bell and yell all&#x27;s well, &quot;provided of course that &#x27;all is well&#x27;&quot;.

Carrot on rare occasions does use his royal powers to make things happen. In &quot;Jingo&quot;, Vetinari made Vimes a Duke, something only a King can do, while Carrot was present—noting that he &quot;had been reminded&quot; that Vimes could have the title. In &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;, faced with the defection of most members of the Watch under Sergeant Fred Colon (then an acting captain), Carrot puts his plain and battered royal sword on a desk in plain sight and reminds Watch members that they took an oath to the King, and the King had not relieved them of it.

Carrot is a stereotypical &quot;perfect&quot; policeman; totally honest, law-abiding, and determined to be friends with everyone. People of all species cannot help wanting to behave well in his presence. His love for everyone distresses Angua, who worries that he loves her as he loves everyone else and no more. He puts the welfare of the public above hers (and his), but when she was in danger, he travelled to the rim of the Disc to save her.

In &quot;Jingo&quot;, Angua is kidnapped on a Klatchian ship and The Watch pursues it. Carrot does not worry, but sensibly, gets some sleep to be ready to rescue her. Sam Vimes and the ship&#x27;s captain see the sense of this, but cannot believe that someone in love can be so sensible.

In &quot;The Art of Discworld&quot; Pratchett says that Carrot has a bright future, &quot;should Lord Vetinari not survive the next assassination attempt&quot;, and notes that although most people envision Carrot as Arnold Schwarzenegger, he is actually more like Liam Neeson. In both the &quot;Discworld&quot; computer game and the BBC Radio production of &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot;, he speaks with a Welsh accent.

===Captain Angua von Überwald===
Captain Delphine Angua von Überwald is a member of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, originally hired under an affirmative action plan by Lord Vetinari. She first appeared in &quot;Men at Arms&quot;. Her beauty led colleagues to predict that criminals would line up to be arrested by her, but Angua&#x27;s surprising strength and tough attitude soon make her one of the most feared officers of the Watch. Angua is a werewolf, but maintains a strict vegetarian diet in her human phase and as a wolf only eats chickens, for which she afterwards leaves discreet payment.

In the 1999 computer game &quot;Discworld Noir&quot;, and the 2001 books-on-tape version of &quot;Men at Arms&quot;, her name is pronounced &quot;An-gyoo-uh&quot; with a hard &quot;g&quot;. Terry Pratchett writes at the terrypratchettbooks.com forum: &quot;it&#x27;s Ang as in Anger, u as in you, a as in a thing&quot;.

Daughter of the Baron and Baroness of Überwald, Angua comes from a family of werewolves and has two brothers, Wolfgang and Andrei. Her sister Elsa is deceased, killed by Wolfgang. Only Angua and Wolfgang can shape-shift at will. Wolfgang is extremely violent and enjoys killing, even eating, &quot;inferior&quot; humans. Angua rebelled and left Überwald. Andrei managed to slip away as well.

Angua moved to Ankh-Morpork and became the first woman in the City Watch. She and Corporal Carrot Ironfoundersson fall in love. After he recovers from his initial surprise, Carrot does not seem bothered that Angua is a werewolf, but Angua worries that their differences will eventually doom the relationship.

Her friend Cheery Littlebottom, a dwarf, comes out in &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; as female with Angua&#x27;s encouragement: dwarf society expects both male and female dwarfs to behave in an indistinguishable way. Angua loans Cheery dresses and make-up, but conceals her werewolf nature from Cheery, who hates and fears werewolves. Throughout the book Angua debates returning to Überwald to live among other werewolves. In the end, she stays in Ankh-Morpork.

Angua also befriends Gaspode, a small dog with matted fur who gains and loses human speech in &quot;Moving Pictures&quot;, then by the time &quot;Men at Arms&quot; begins regains it by sleeping near Unseen University&#x27;s High-Energy Magic building. Gaspode flirts with Angua and helps her on her missions.

In &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;, Commander Vimes travels to Überwald on a diplomatic mission. Lord Vetinari chooses Angua to go with him, but she has already left for Überwald for reasons of her own. Carrot and Gaspode set out after her. This is the first Discworld book to reveal much about Angua&#x27;s background, and her parents and brother Wolfgang all figure in the story. Angua&#x27;s relationship with actual wolves also provides some tension. Vimes ultimately kills Wolfgang, who leads a violent werewolf movement in Überwald, in a violent confrontation in the city square. 

That there is a werewolf on the Watch becomes common knowledge in Ankh-Morpork, but Angua remains undisturbed, as the werewolf is generally assumed to be Nobby Nobbs; Carrot, Vimes, Vetinari, and Angua herself all play along. However &quot;The Truth&quot; reveals in passing that several members of the Ankh-Morpork aristocracy and the lawyer Mr Slant do know her nature. In &quot;Making Money&quot;, Moist von Lipwig also figures this out when he sees Angua in werewolf form with Nobby. Though the widespread recognition of the werewolf presence in the Watch has not inconvenienced Angua on a human level, the city&#x27;s criminal underworld learns to evade capture, for example with a scent bomb like The New Firm (Mr. Pin and Mr. Tulip) use in &quot;The Truth&quot;. Several references to scent bombs follow, most notably used by Carcer at the beginning of &quot;Night Watch&quot;, when he kills Sergeant Stronginthearm.

Angua helps Vimes on another diplomatic mission in &quot;Monstrous Regiment&quot;, and in &quot;Going Postal&quot; is mentioned as difficult to elude. Angua also appears in &quot;Thud!&quot;, which features the Watch&#x27;s first vampire officer, Sally. 

Though Angua is deeply committed to Carrot, calling herself his dog, others take a romantic interest in her. A wolf named Gavin in &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;, provides tension, and the small wealthy mutt Mr. Fusspot in &quot;Making Money&quot; proposes marriage.

&quot;I Shall Wear Midnight&quot; notes that Angua is newly promoted to captain. Captain Carrot arrests Tiffany Aching after a disturbance in the King&#x27;s Head involving the Nac Mac Feegles, defeated by Wee Mad Arthur, another Feegle (the rat catcher from &quot;Feet of Clay&quot; who rescues Colon from the King Golem, although he is referred to as a gnome in the original novel). Wee Mad Arthur has now joined the watch, and tells Tiffany that she will be escorted by his colleague, Captain Angua.

In the 2010 Sky television adaptation of &quot;Going Postal&quot;, Angua was played by Ingrid Bolsø Berdal.

The Cretaceous gymnosperm species &quot;Czekanowskia anguae&quot; is named after Angua.

===Sergeant Fred Colon===
Frederick &quot;Fred&quot; Colon was a sergeant, and had been for a long time. He may have been first mentioned in &quot;The Colour of Magic&quot; as the &quot;Sergeant of The Watch&quot; who enters the then Broken Drum. He is described on several occasions as &quot;one of nature&#x27;s sergeants&quot;, overweight, preferring to avoid trouble and exertion, and rather unimaginative. He generally &quot;guards&quot; bridges or large buildings against theft. He was a corporal in the Watch at the time Sam Vimes first joined, and subsequent to this spent some time in the army (the Duke of Quirm&#x27;s Middleweight Infantry and then the Duke of Eorle&#x27;s First Heavy Infantry), before returning to the Watch.

In &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;, Colon becomes the head of the Traffic Squad, which also includes his friend Nobby Nobbs. This role fits him perfectly, especially since the Traffic Squad is &quot;self-financing&quot; (they keep the fines). A brief promotion to acting-captain proved a disaster as everyone, including Colon himself, expected. He currently holds the dual positions of Custody Officer and Watch Liaison Officer: jobs so vague that no one knows what they entail, least of all Colon himself. Their purpose is to avoid overburdening his brain with responsibility, and to also avoid the catastrophic possibility that he might have task of any real importance. His office, in a separate building from the main watch house, is frequented by old acquaintances who want somewhere quiet to get away from the wife, hear what is happening on the street and—in Vimes&#x27; words—&quot;gossip like washerwomen.&quot; Vimes considers this free-flowing source of information well worth the price of the doughnuts.

Vimes thought most other watch officers saw a fat, stupid, lazy, and cowardly man, and that this was mostly what was there. But Colon and Nobby have a street-level knowledge of Ankh-Morpork on a par with his own, and are good at sensing tension in a crowd. Both also survived the Glorious 25 May when, in the aftermath of a coup in &quot;Night Watch&quot;, an assortment of police and hangers-on (including a then-apprentice assassin named Vetinari) took out the remnants of the outgoing regime&#x27;s secret police, though at a cost. Colon performs his duties in &quot;Thud!&quot; fairly well, is an amiable jailer, bright enough to keep his keys in a closed tin box in the bottom drawer of his desk, well out of reach of anything an inmate could use to snag them. He is often portrayed as prejudiced, but his prejudice is so non-specific and naive, frequently short-lived when he actually meets one of the group in question, that nobody takes him seriously.

He might be related to Sergeant Doppelpunkt (German for the punctiaton mark &quot;colon&quot;), half of the town watch in Bad Blintz, Überwald, (&quot;The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents&quot;). Other Discworld characters notably similar to Colon include one of the guard in the Überwald town of Bonk, nicknamed &quot;Colonesque&quot; by Samuel Vimes, and one of the market guards in Al Khali, Klatch. As with the various Dibblers, this may be due to morphic resonance.

Colon is married, but his wife works during the day and, since he works at night, the two seldom see one another and communicate by leaving notes. Vimes privately attributes the longevity of Fred&#x27;s marriage to this. &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; notes that they have children, which Vimes puts down to &#x27;persuasive handwriting&#x27;.

Colon briefly appears in the Cosgrove Hall adaptation of &quot;Soul Music&quot;. In the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; he was voiced by Stephen Thorne, and in the 1988 stage play Roger Bingham portrays him. In the Radio 4 adaptation of &quot;Night Watch,&quot; he was voiced by Sam Dale.

===Corporal Nobby Nobbs===
Cecil Wormsborough St. John &quot;Nobby&quot; Nobbs is untidy, smelly, and about the size of a dwarf. He carries a certificate to prove he is, on the balance of probabilities, a human being. A running joke is the inability of others to believe this, despite—or even because of—the evidence. 
Samuel Vimes is Nobby&#x27;s commanding officer, and Sergeant Fred Colon his partner and longtime friend. Nobby and Colon have strangely philosophical conversations, including one on whether Death has a first name, or even any friends to use it. Oddly, these conversations hint at Nobby having more intelligence than Colon. Nobby is continually pointing out fatal flaws in Colon&#x27;s statements and arguments, and Colon mentally scrambles to come up with an answer (not unlike some byplay in Laurel and Hardy films). Nobby likes folk dancing.

As a street urchin he was a major source of information for city notables. His abusive father broke his leg at least once and Vimes noted in &quot;Night Watch&quot; that Nobby&#x27;s father used to break his arms. Young Nobby sometimes referred to his father as &quot;Number One Suspect&quot;, and was afraid of prison because his father was there.

He was inspired to join the Watch after meeting Sergeant-At-Arms John Keel (Sam Vimes, due to time travel), who gave him a spoon. His father subsequently stole it when he was released from prison.

Nobby was once thought by some to be the Earl of Ankh, but this was a ploy to make him king, as he was thought easier to manipulate than Carrot. But, being less tractable than expected, Nobby turned down a life as the figurehead ruler of Ankh-Morpork. He said later that he was afraid of what Vimes would say when he found out. His family had long believed that there is always a catch, so they never volunteer for anything. 

Nonetheless, the ending of &quot;Feet of Clay&quot;, suggests that he may truly have been a nobleman, with family heirlooms he never mentions. His small stature and odd features may be a jab at royal inbreeding. But the Nobbses have stolen so much over the years, Vimes notes, &quot;you could probably prove Nobby was the Dowager Duchess of Quirm&quot;.

Nobby helped resolve the &quot;war&quot; between Ankh-Morpork and Klatch in &quot;Jingo&quot;. In recognition, the Patrician gave him a new job in traffic control, and then &quot;promoted&quot; Fred Colon to Watch Liaison Officer, a job vague enough to ensure he never had to do anything actually important.

Ironically, Nobby also ends the war between the dwarfs and the trolls. In &quot;Thud&quot; an ancient artifact called a Cube reveals that the Battle of Koom Valley, the main reason for the continuing hatred between the two races, was supposed to be a chance for the two Kings to discuss peace. Nobby steals the Cube, but the reader does not learn this until Vimes tells him to hand it over. Vimes works out how to make the Cube play its message in the presence of the current King of the Dwarves, and the truth of Koom Valley is heard for the first time in hundreds of years.

Nobby thinks he has a romantic relationship with Verity &quot;Hammerhead&quot; Pushpram, a girl who runs a fish stall. Her nickname comes from the fact that her eyes appear to look in opposite directions. However, the relationship seems to consist solely of her hitting him with a fish and telling him to bugger off. He remains &quot;faithful&quot; to her, however, in all books except &quot;Thud!&quot;, in which he temporarily has a relationship with exotic dancer Tawneee. In &quot;Snuff&quot; he appears have a romantic relationship with goblin girl Shine of the Rainbow. In &quot;Raising Steam&quot;, Colon says Nobby is &quot;practically married&quot;.

Nobby may be related to Corporal Knopf half of the town watch of Bad Blintz, Überwald in &quot;The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents&quot;. Other characters with a notable similarity to Nobby include a member of the guard in the Überwald town of Bonk, nicknamed &quot;Nobbski&quot; by Vimes, and one of the market guards in Al Khali, Klatch. Morphic resonance may have caused this, as with the various incarnations of Dibbler. But being related to Nobby is not seen as a good thing. An Unseen University bedlow who by sheer coincidence shared Nobby&#x27;s last name swiftly denied any family ties.

The &quot;Pratchett Portfolio&quot; says Nobby is known for saying &quot;&#x27;tis a lie sir, I never done it,&quot; but he has not actually been recorded saying it.

When Nobby was in Klatch he &quot;got in touch with his feminine side&quot;, and liked to wear women&#x27;s clothing. He also dressed up as an old lady for a Traffic scam, to which Vimes put an end.

Nobby briefly appeared in the Cosgrove Hall adaptation of &quot;Soul Music&quot;. In the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of &quot;Guards! Guards!&quot; he was voiced by Melvyn Hayes. David Brett, formerly of the Flying Pickets played Nobby in the 1988 stage play. Nobby also appears in two computer adventure games, &quot;Discworld (The Trouble With Dragons)&quot;, where he was voiced by Tony Robinson, and &quot;Discworld Noir&quot;, where he was voiced by Rob Brydon). Nobby had a distinct Irish accent in both. In the 2006 TV adaptation of &quot;Hogfather&quot; Nicolas Tennant played Nobby.

===Sergeant Detritus===
===Sergeant Cheery Littlebottom===
Cheery Littlebottom is a female dwarf and forensic expert working for the City Watch, introduced in &quot;Feet of Clay&quot;.

===Constable Reginald Shoe===
&quot;See: Undead (Discworld)&quot;

===Lance-Constable Salacia &quot;Sally&quot; von Humpeding===
&quot;See: Undead (Discworld)&quot;

===Constable Dorfl===
&quot;See: Golems (Discworld)&quot;

===Constable Visit-the-Infidel/Ungodly-with-Explanatory-Pamphlets===
Visit-the-Infidel-with-Explanatory-Pamphlets (sometimes referred to as Visit-the-Ungodly-with-Explanatory-Pamphlets) is a constable of the City Watch. generally just called &quot;Constable Visit&quot;, or occasionally &quot;Washpot&quot; from one of his favourite quotations, &quot;Moab is my washpot. Over Edom will I cast out my shoe&quot;, from Psalm 60 of &quot;The Book of Om&quot;. 

He first appeared in &quot;Feet of Clay&quot;. Samuel Vimes says he is a good copper, his highest form of personal praise. He is a gentle but determined Omnian proselytiser who can clear a large crowd in seconds by talking religion and offering pamphlets.

When off-duty, he goes door to door with fellow Omnian Smite-the-Unbeliever-with-Cunning-Arguments. Not afraid of Visit&#x27;s proselytising, his friend and fellow constable Dorfl, a golem with endless patience, wants to argue faith rationally.

He appears in the SkyOne television adaptation of &quot;Hogfather&quot;, portrayed by Richard Katz.

===Inspector A E Pessimal===
A E Pessimal was first the government Inspector of the Watch assigned (in &quot;Thud!&quot;) by Lord Vetinari to inspect the Watch and judge whether they gave fair value (&quot;who watches the watchmen?&quot;) and to inspect the Unseen University in &quot;A Collegiate Casting-Out of Devilish Devices&quot;.

Described as a neat little man with very shiny shoes, no friends, and no sense of humour, he does not have a first name, and was &quot;initialled&quot; at birth rather than named. He could have seriously inconvenienced Vimes with difficult questions such as; &quot;Why is C.W.St.J. &#x27;Nobby&#x27; Nobbs in the Watch?&quot;

Vimes eventually swore him in as a special constable for the duration of an impending street fight of roughly a thousand trolls and dwarves, to scare the man and show him what it was like to be a copper. Instead, A E took his position seriously, to the point of bare-handedly attacking and trying to bite a troll who took a swing at Vimes. This totally shocked Vetinari (&quot;&quot;Mr Pessimal?&quot; Mr. A E &quot;Pessimal&quot;? We are talking about the same person? Small man, very clean shoes?&quot;).

Vimes offered him the position of Lance-Constable and adjutant, needing someone to look through paperwork and sift out important or suspicious facts. A E is the start of an internal affairs department in the Watch.

In &quot;Snuff&quot;, A E is a newly minted Inspector Of the Watch, and his forensic accounting has become legendary and feared throughout Ankh-Morpork.

===Constable Igor===
Igor was an Igor his family considered &quot;too modern&quot; for Überwald, He specialised in genetics and created a rabbit named Eerie, on whom he grew human ears. He bred noses as lifeforms independent until applied. He experimented with swimming potatoes hoping for instant fish and chips. Like all Igors, he is a highly talented transplant surgeon.

He sometimes forgets to lisp. Vimes hired him for his surgery methods, considerably more advanced than in Ankh-Morpork. Igor first appears in &quot;The Fifth Elephant&quot;. He and Sergeant Cheery Littlebottom form the Watch forensics department.

===Constable Downspout===
Constable Downspout first appears in &quot;Feet of Clay&quot;, and is a surveillance expert for the Watch. As a gargoyle, he is able to remain motionless in one spot and watch for days at a time, a &quot;world champion at not moving&quot; as Vimes once remarked. He has no use for money and instead receives his salary in pigeons, which he eats.

===Corporal Buggy Swires===
A gnome. Introduced in &quot;Jingo&quot; or possibly in &quot;The Light Fantastic&quot;, which mentions a gnome identified only as Swires, Buggy has the hard-nosed, bellicose personality typical of his species, and can shout down uncooperative witnesses despite being only six inches tall. He has established himself as the sole member of the Watch&#x27;s Airborne Section except perhaps Wee Mad Arthur, by taming various birds (acquired from the Pictsies for a crate of whiskey) as transport for reconnaissance and messaging.

<text>The Eggja stone (also known as the Eggum or Eggjum stone), listed as N KJ101 in the Rundata catalog, is a grave stone with a runic inscription that was ploughed up in 1917 on the farm Eggja in Sogndal, Nordre Bergenhus amt (now in Vestland county), Norway. 

==Description==
The Eggja stone was found with the written side downwards over a man&#x27;s grave (cf. the Kylver stone) which is dated to the period 650–700 C.E. The flat slab of stone is nowadays in Bergen Museum. Having as many as 200 runes, it is the longest known inscription in the Elder Futhark, but certain runes are transitional towards the Younger Futhark. 

Many scholarly works have been written about the inscription, but only minor parts of the partially preserved inscription have received an accepted translation. It is generally agreed it is written in stylized poetry and in a partly metrical form containing a protection for the grave and the description of a funerary rite. However, there are widely diverging interpretations about certain details. 

There is also the image of a horse carved into the stone, but it does not appear to have any connection with the inscription.

==Inscriptions==
===Transliteration===
The following transcription mostly copies the graphic analysis provided by Ottar Grønvik (1985). Some of the individual characters are unclear, and other analyses may disagree with certain parts. (For example, Grønvik analyzed fokl as foki.)

===Translations===
;Krause and Jankuhn (1966)

Wolfgang Krause and Herbert Jankuhn, &quot;Die Runeninschriften im älteren Futhark&quot; (1966) offered the following interpretation:

* Panel 1:
:&quot;Ni&#x27;s sólu sótt ok ni saxe stæin skorinn. &quot;
:&quot;Ni (læggi) mannʀ nækðan, is niþ rinnʀ, &quot;
:&quot;Ni viltiʀ mænnʀ læggi ax.&quot;

* Panel 2:
:&quot;Hin(n) varp *náséo mannʀ, máðe þæim kæipa í bormóþa húni. &quot;
:&quot;Huæaʀ of kam hæráss á hi á land gotna. &quot;
:&quot;Fiskʀ óʀ f(ir)na uim suim(m)ande, fogl á f??????? galande.&quot;

* Panel 3:
:&quot;Alu misyrki&quot;

Based on this reconstruction, the following translation is offered:
* Panel 1:
:&quot;It is not touched by the sun and the stone is not scored by an [iron] knife. No man may lay [it] bare, when the waning moon runs [across the heavens]. Misguided men may not lay [the stone] aside. &quot;

The stone has been prepared in accordance with tradition; the stone is untouched by sunlight, and not cut with iron. It should not be uncovered during the waning moon, and should not be removed from its place.

* Panel 2:
:&quot;The man sprinkled this [stone] with corpse-sea (blood), with it he rubbed the tholes of the well drilled boat. As who came the army-god hither onto the land of warriors? A fish swimming out of the terrible stream, a bird screaming into the enemy band&quot;

Someone has stained this stone with blood (kenned as &quot;corpse-sea&quot;); perhaps as part of a sacrifice to facilitate the passage of the deceased or call on whatever power the inscription is addressed to.
The &quot;heráss&quot; is the &quot;god of armies&quot; - a psychopomp god (i.e. an early form of Odin) who comes to the land of the living to take the deceased to an afterlife. 

* Panel 3:
:&quot;Protection against the wrong-doer&quot;

;Grønvik (1985)

Ottar Grønvik (1985) offers a more prosaic interpretation.
Panel 3 above is relegated to the middle, as part B:

:A1 &quot;(hiu þwer) hin warp naseu wilʀ made þaim kaiba i bormoþa huni&quot;
:A2 &quot;huwaʀ ob kam harie a hit lat&quot;
:A3 &quot;gotna fiskʀ oʀ firnauim suwimade foki af (f)a(nwan)ga lande&quot;
:B &quot;a(i a)u is urki&quot;
:C1 &quot;ni s solu sot uk ni sakse stain skorin&quot;
:C2 &quot;ni (witi) maʀ nakdan is na wrinʀ ni wiltiʀ manʀ lagi(s)&quot;

(Parenthesis denotes reconstructed or anticipated forms)

The Old Norse equivalent is here said to be:
:A1 &quot;Hjú þverr, hín varp násjó *Vill: máðe þeim keipa i bormóða húni.&quot;
:A2 &quot;Hverr of kom her á hitt land?&quot;
:A3 &quot;Gotna fiskr ór firney-ím, svimande foki af fán-vanga lande.&quot;
:B &quot;Æ ey es yrki!&quot;
:C1 &quot;Ne&#x27;s sólu sótt, ok ne sakse, stein skorinn;&quot;
:C2 &quot;ne víti maðr, nǫkðan es ná rinn, ne viltir menn, lægis!&quot;

Translation:

:A1 &quot;The household wanes, *Vil threw a death wave over those&quot;
::&quot;The oarlocks wore out for, with the tired mast-top&quot;
:A2 &quot;Who brought the horde to the land afar?&quot;
:A3 &quot;The godly-fish from Firnøy’s streams&quot;
::&quot;Swimming in the drift of the land of shining meadows.&quot;
:B &quot;Be it of help, I work this.&quot;
:C1 &quot;Not has the sun seen, nor the sword shorn, this stone,&quot;
:C2 &quot;Do not seek who call forth the naked dead,&quot;
::&quot;Nor wildly men, this bed of rest!&quot;

According to this interpretation, A1 is a description of a shipwreck in bad weather. The mast seems to have broken, and the oars could not save them, as a mythical creature, *Vil (possibly the sea-god Aegir, or simply divine will,) casts a wave upon the boat. 
Parts A2, A3 and B explains the fate of the deceased. As A2 asks how they will get to the land beyond, A3 replies that a divine creature in the shape of a fish will lead them to the land of shining meadows. Part B prays that the work of the one writing this will help. &quot;Firney&quot; is probably not a place name, but possibly &quot;Fear-island&quot; or &quot;Far-island&quot;, and a kenning for the realm of the dead.
Part C1 says that the inscription was done at night, and not by using steel. This probably pertains to ancient grave-rituals, but the exact meaning is unclear. C2 issues warning directed at necromancers and mad (or mentally ill) people to prevent them from desecrating the grave.

==Meter==
Panel 2 has been suggested to contain a stanza in the Galdralag meter, i.e.:

:&quot;Hvaʀ of kom hęráss á&quot;
:&quot;hí á land gotna?&quot;
:&quot;Fiskʀ óʀ f(ir)na-vim svim(m)ande,&quot;
:&quot;fogl á f(...) galande.&quot;

:&quot;Which harrier-god came&quot;
:&quot;here onto the land of men?&quot;
:&quot;A fish out of shocking wavering, swimming,&quot;
:&quot;a fowl, on f(...), crowing&quot;

The inscription loosely follows the pattern of the Merseburg Incantations, divided into two complementary parts, but where the Merseburger invokes a mythic event and calls for an exorcistic repetition, the Eggja composer seems to twice invoke a ritual, the first time listing two desired outcomes, in the second instance asking a question and answering it. Both inscriptions may represent some of the few remaining examples of pre-Christian &quot;ljoð&quot; or &quot;galdr&quot;, ritual verse chanted by the cult leaders, shamans or oracles of Norse Scandinavia.

==In popular culture==

Neo-folk band Heilung&#x27;s songs Krigsgaldr and Hakkerskaldyr have lyrics from Grønvik&#x27;s translation of the Eggja inscription.

:&quot;Min warb naseu&quot;
:&quot;Wilr made thaim&quot;
:&quot;I bormotha hauni &quot;

:&quot;Hu war (hu war)&quot;
:&quot;Hu war opkam har a hit lot&quot;
:&quot;Got nafiskr orf&quot;

:&quot;Hu war (hu war)&quot;

<text>Gander Lake is located in the central part of the island of Newfoundland in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. It is the third-largest lake in Newfoundland. Gander Lake, Gander River and Gander Bay are thought to have gained their names from the wild geese that frequent the area.

Measuring in length and several kilometres in width, the lake is oriented roughly northwest–southeast. The town of Gander is located on the northern shore at roughly its midpoint, and the towns of Appleton and Glenwood are situated on the Western extremity of the lake, on the banks of the Gander River. Gander Lake has been measured to a depth of in some areas.

It is the main source of water for the towns of Gander, Appleton and Glenwood.

==Access==

Near the southeastern end of the lake, just over outside of the town of Gander, there is a small, quarry-cut, artificial harbour, commonly known as &quot;Little Harbour&quot;. This area contains is a concrete public boat launch and a fire pit area for day trips. Camping is frowned upon, if not outright forbidden in the immediate area of the boat launch. However there are two pebble beaches which are used by tenters, accessible from the dirt roads surrounding the cove. Boaters have much better access to both pebble and sand beaches that run along both sides of the lake, such as one commonly known as the &quot;fifteen mile brook&quot;, which are excellent for camping. Other well known areas throughout the lake include &quot;Hunt&#x27;s Cove&quot;, &quot;Southwest&quot;, &quot;Gander River&quot; and &quot;Denty&#x27;s Pit&quot;.

<doc id="923164" wikidata="Q1784028" url="?curid=923164" title="Spinal board">
<text>A spinal board, is a patient handling device used primarily in pre-hospital trauma care. It is designed to provide rigid support during movement of a person with suspected spinal or limb injuries. They are most commonly used by ambulance staff, as well as lifeguards and ski patrollers. Historically, backboards were also used in an attempt to &quot;improve the posture&quot; of young people, especially girls.

Due to lack of evidence to support long-term use, the practice of keeping people on long boards for prolonged periods of time is decreasing.

==Extrication uses==
The spinal backboard was originally designed as a device to remove people from a vehicle. After a time people were simply kept on the spine board for transport without evidence supporting this need.

==Medical uses==
A spinal board is primarily indicated for judicious use to transport people who may have had a spinal injury, usually due to the mechanism of injury, and the attending team are not able to rule out a spinal injury. The person should be transferred from the board to a hospital bed as soon as possible. For comfort and safety reasons, it is recommended to transfer the person to a vacuum mattress instead, in which case a scoop stretcher or long spine board is just used for the transfer.

Despite its history of use, there is no evidence that backboards immobilize the spine, nor do they improve the person&#x27;s outcomes. Additionally, cervical spine motion restriction has been shown to increase mortality in people with penetrating trauma and can cause pain, agitation, respiratory compromise, and can lead to the development of bedsores.

==Adverse effects==
Common clinical issues found with spinal boards include pressure sore development, inadequacy of spinal motion restriction, pain and discomfort, respiratory compromise and effects on the quality of radiological imaging. For this reason, some professionals view them as unsuitable for the task, preferring alternatives.

It is advised that no patient should spend more than 30 minutes on a spine board, due to the development of discomfort and pressure sores.

Backboards were invented to be a &quot;highly polished surface&quot; to move a person to an EMS bed, not to be used as spinal securing device.

==Construction==

Backboards are almost always used in conjunction with the following devices:
* a cervical collar with occipital padding as needed;
* side head supports, such as a rolled blanket or head blocks (head immobilizer) made specifically for this purpose, used to avoid the lateral rotation of the head;
* straps to secure the patient to the long spine board, and tape to secure the head

Spine boards are typically made of wood or plastic, although there has been a strong shift away from wood boards due to their higher level of maintenance required to keep them in operable condition and to protect them from cracks and other imperfections that could harbor bacteria.

Backboards are designed to be slightly wider and longer than the average human body to accommodate the immobilization straps, and have handles for carrying the patient. Most backboards are designed to be completely X-ray translucent so that they do not interfere with the exam while patients are strapped to them. They are light enough to be easily carried by one person, and are usually buoyant.

==Alternatives==
The vacuum mattress may reduce sacral pressures compared to backboards. The conforming nature of the vacuum mattress means that people can be kept immobilized on it for longer periods of time and the immobilisation offers superior stability and comfort. The Kendrick extrication device is another alternative.

<text>The House of Bonde is along with the houses of Bielke and Natt och Dag, one of the oldest surviving Swedish noble families. The earliest attested nobleman who is known to have carried the name &quot;Bonde&quot; was Torer Bonde, who served as witness during the confirmation of a donation to the abbey at Vreta in either 1282 or 1286.

However, the most conclusively proven ancestors of the house were the brothers Tord Bonde (Petersson) and Erengisle Petersson (Bonde), who lived in the early 1300s. Tord is attested to have been made a squire in 1310, then a knight in 1316 after which he joined the rebellion to oust King Birger Magnusson from the throne. Tord was among the delegates sent to sue for peace with Birger once he fled to the court of his brother-in-law King Eric VI of Denmark. He was also present at the council of lords who sentenced the former king&#x27;s son Magnus Birgersson (not to be confused with the Swedish king Magnus Birgersson) to death.

His brother Erengisle had a far less eventful life, the only thing that is known is that he was made squire in the year 1319 and remained as such until his death in 1350, and that the inheritance from him and his wife were split equally between his four children; the brothers Ragvald, Peter and Filip and their sister Ingeborg.

Today, two branches of the family survive, both stem from the descendants of Erengisle. The barons of the House of Bonde which is number 20 in the Swedish House of Nobility and the counts of the House of Bonde af Björnö, number 41.

Prominent members, bearing the name, include:
* Tord Bonde (c. 1350s–1417), medieval Swedish magnate
* Charles VIII of Sweden (Karl Knutsson Bonde) ; 1408/1409–1470), King, Charles I of Norway
* Magdalena of Sweden (1445–1495), Princess
* Gustaf Bonde (1620–1667), Swedish statesman
* Wilhelmina Bonde (1817–1899), Swedish courtier
* Carl Bonde (1872–1957), Swedish Army officer, equerry
**Carl C:son Bonde (1897–1990), Swedish Army officer
**Thord Bonde (1900–1969), Swedish Army officer

<doc id="923176" wikidata="Q1968052" url="?curid=923176" title="Ormen Lange (gas field)">
<text>Ormen Lange is a natural gas field on the Norwegian continental shelf. It is situated northwest of Kristiansund, where seabed depths vary between . The field is named after the famous longship &quot;Ormen Lange&quot; of Olaf Tryggvason, a 10th-century Viking king of Norway.

==History==
Production of gas began with three wells in September 2007. The King and Queen of Norway attended the official opening of this project, delivered on time and within budget, on 6 October 2007, at the football stadium in Molde. During the opening, King Harald officially opened the terminal which would supply Great Britain with enough natural gas to cover 20% of its total annual needs. 

The proposal to build the Langeled subsea pipeline, the world’s second longest subsea export pipeline after Nord Stream 1, was approved in February 2003. The 1,166 km (725 mi) pipeline runs across the North Sea from Nyhamna to the Easington Gas Terminal near the mouth of the Humber estuary on the UK’s east coast.

==Reserves==
The reservoir is approximately long and wide, and lies about below sea level. Recoverable gas reserves are estimated to be ~300 billion cubic meters.

==Technical description==
The Ormen Lange field has been developed without using conventional offshore platforms. Instead, 24 subsea wellheads in four seabed templates on the ocean floor are connected directly by two pipelines to an onshore process terminal at Nyhamna. After processing, the gas is exported by the world&#x27;s second longest subsea gas pipeline - Langeled pipeline - approximately from Nyhamna to Easington in England. The northern section of the export pipeline has a diameter of , and the section from Sleipner to Easington has a diameter of . The field produces 70 million cubic meters of natural gas per day.

Total cost is estimated to reach 66 billion Norwegian kroner (around US$12 billion) by the time of completion.

The onshore facility at Nyhamna was designed by Aker Solutions Engineering in 2003-2007.

==Natural conditions==
Extreme natural conditions at the site (subzero temperatures part of the year, stormy seas, strong underwater currents, uneven seabed) put great demands on the technology used in the project. The Storegga Slides that occurred in the area about 8,000 years ago have been investigated, with the conclusion that the risk of recurrence is negligible.

==Ownership and operators==
Several companies share ownership of Ormen Lange.
*Petoro AS: 36.4850%
*Statoil: 25.3452%
*Norske Shell: 17.8134%
*DONG Energy: 14.0208%
*ExxonMobil: 6.3356%

Ormen Lange was operated by Statoil during the development stage. On 30 November 2007, Norske Shell took over as the operator.

<doc id="923177" wikidata="Q1111219" url="?curid=923177" title="Himera">
<text>Himera (Greek: ), was a large and important ancient Greek city situated on the north coast of Sicily at the mouth of the river of the same name (the modern Imera Settentrionale), between Panormus (modern Palermo) and Cephaloedium (modern Cefalù) in the &quot;comune&quot; of Termini Imerese.

Many of its remains can be visited and there are two museums on the site.

==History==

===Foundation and earliest history===

Himera was the first Greek settlement on this part of the island and was a strategic outpost just outside the eastern boundary of the Carthaginian-controlled west. Thucydides says it was the only Greek city on this coast of Sicily, which must however be understood with reference only to independent cities. Mylae, which was also on the north coast and certainly of Greek origin, was a dependency of Zancle (modern Messina). All authorities agree that Himera was a colony of Zancle, but Thucydides tells us that the emigrants from Zancle mingled with a number of Syracusan exiles, resulting in a city with Chalcidic institutions and a Doric dialect.

The foundation of Himera is placed subsequent to that of Mylae (as, from their relative positions, might naturally have been expected) both by Strabo and Scymnus Chius: its date is not mentioned by Thucydides, but Diodorus tells us that it had existed 240 years at the time of its destruction by the Carthaginians, which would fix its first settlement in 648 BC.

Archaeology shows that around 580-560 BC the city was completely rebuilt after an unknown event destroyed it. There is otherwise very little information as to its early history: an obscure notice in Aristotle, from which it appears to have at one time fallen under the dominion of the tyrant Phalaris, being the only mention found of it, until about 490 BC, when it afforded a temporary refuge to Scythes, tyrant of Zancle, after his expulsion from the latter city. Not long after this event, Himera fell itself under the yoke of a despot named Terillus, who sought to fortify his power by contracting a close alliance with Anaxilas, at that time ruler both of Rhegium (modern Reggio di Calabria) and Zancle. But Terillus was unable to resist the power of Theron, despot of Agrigentum (modern Agrigento), and, being expelled by him from Himera, had recourse to the assistance of the Carthaginians, a circumstance which became the immediate occasion of the first great expedition of that people to Sicily, 480 BC.

===First interaction with Carthage===

The magnitude of the armament sent under Hamilcar, who is said to have landed in Sicily with an army of 300,000 men, sufficiently proves that the conquest of Himera was the pretext, rather than the object, of the war. However, it is likely that the growing power of Himeria in the immediate vicinity of the Carthaginian settlements of Panormus and Solus had already caused concern among the Carthaginians. Hence it was against Himera that the first efforts of Hamilcar were directed. Theron, who had thrown himself into the city with all the forces at his command, was able to maintain its defence until the arrival of Gelon of Syracuse. Despite the numerical inferiority of his forces, he defeated the army of the Carthaginians with such slaughter that the Battle of Himera in 480 BC was regarded by the Greeks of Sicily as worthy of comparison with the contemporary victory of Salamis. The same feeling probably gave rise to the tradition or belief, that both triumphs were achieved on the very same day.

===After the Battle of Himera===
This victory left Theron in the undisputed possession of the sovereignty of Himera, as well as of that of Agrigentum. He appears to have focused on Agrigentum, and left the government of Himera to his son Thrasydaeus. But the young man, by his violent and oppressive rule, soon alienated the minds of the citizens. They applied for relief to Hieron of Syracuse, at that time on terms of hostility with Theron. The Syracusan despot, however, betrayed their overtures to Theron. He took vengeance on the Himeraeans, putting to death a large number of the disaffected citizens and driving others into exile. Shortly after, seeing that the city had suffered greatly from these severities and that its population was much diminished, he sought to restore its prosperity by establishing there a new body of citizens whom he collected from various quarters. The greater part of these new colonists were of Dorian extraction, and though the two bodies of citizens were blended into one and continued to live harmoniously together, at this period Himera became a Doric city. Himera adopted the institutions and followed the policy of the other Doric states of Sicily. This settlement seems to have taken place in 476 BC, and Himera continued subject to Theron until his death, in 472 BC, but Thrasydaeus retained possession of the sovereignty for a very short time after the death of his father, and his defeat by Hieron of Syracuse was speedily followed by his expulsion both from Agrigentum and Himera. In 466 BC we find the Himeraeans, in their turn, sending a force to assist the Syracusans in throwing off the yoke of Thrasybulus; and, in the general settlement of affairs which followed soon after, the exiles were allowed to return to Himera, where they appear to have settled quietly together with the new citizens. From this period Diodorus expressly tells us that Himera was fortunate enough to escape from civil dissensions, and this good government must have secured to it no small share of the prosperity which was enjoyed by the Sicilian cities in general during the succeeding half-century.

But though we are told in general terms that the period which elapsed from this re-settlement of Himera until its destruction by the Carthaginians (461–408 BC), was one of peace and prosperity, the only notices we find of the city during this interval refer to the part it took at the time of the Athenian expedition to Sicily, 415 BC. On that occasion, the Himeraeans were among the first to promise their support to Syracuse: hence, when Nicias presented himself before their port with the Athenian fleet, they altogether refused to receive him; and, shortly after, it was at Himera that Gylippus landed, and from whence he marched across the island to Syracuse, at the head of a force composed in great part of Himeraean citizens.

===Destruction by Carthage===
In 409 BC the prosperity of the city was brought to an abrupt end by the great Carthaginian expedition to Sicily. The ostensible object of the expedition was the support of the Segestans against their neighbours, the Selinuntines. The Carthaginians, though, had greater ambitions. Immediately after the destruction of Selinus, Hannibal Mago, who commanded the expedition, hastened to turn his arms against Himera. That city was ill-prepared for defence; its fortifications were of little strength, but the citizens made a desperate resistance, and by a vigorous sally inflicted severe loss on the Carthaginians. They were at first supported by a force of about 4000 auxiliaries from Syracuse under the command of Diocles, but that general feared for the safety of Syracuse itself and abandoned Himera, leaving the unfortunate citizens to contend singlehanded against the Carthaginian power. Their defenses failed and the city was soon taken by storm. A large part of the citizens were killed and at least 3000 of them, who had been taken prisoners, were put to death by Hannibal as a sacrifice to the memory of his grandfather Hamilcar. The city itself was utterly destroyed, its buildings razed to the ground, and even the temples themselves were not spared.

Diodorus, who relates the total destruction of Himera, tells us expressly that it was never rebuilt, and that the site remained uninhabited down to his own times. It seems at first in contradiction with this statement, that he elsewhere includes the Himeraeans, as well as the Selinuntines and Agrigentines, among the exiled citizens that were allowed by the treaty, concluded with Carthage, in 405 BC, to return to their homes, and inhabit their own cities, on condition of paying tribute to Carthage and not restoring their fortifications. And it seems clear that many of them at least availed themselves of this permission, as we find the Himeraeans subsequently mentioned among the states that declared in favour of Dionysius I of Syracuse, at the commencement of his great war with Carthage in 397 BC; though they quickly returned to the Carthaginian alliance in the following year. The explanation of this difficulty is furnished by Cicero, who tells us that, after the destruction of Himera, those citizens who had survived the calamity of the war established themselves at Thermae, within the confines of the same territory, and not far from their old town. Diodorus gives a somewhat different account of the foundation of Thermae, which he represents as established by the Carthaginians themselves before the close of the war, in 407 BC. But it is probable that both statements are substantially correct, and that the Carthaginians founded the new town in the immediate neighbourhood of Himera, in order to prevent the old site being again occupied; while the Himeraean exiles, when they returned thither, though they settled in the new town, naturally regarded themselves as still the same people, and would continue to bear the name of Himeraeans. How completely, even at a much later period, the one city was regarded as the representative of the other, appears from the statement of Cicero, that when Scipio Aemilianus, after the capture of Carthage, restored to the Agrigentines and Gelenses the statues that had been carried off from their respective cities, he at the same time restored to the citizens of Thermae those that had been taken from Himera. Hence we cannot be surprised to find that, not only are the Himeraeans still spoken of as an existing people, but even that the name of Himera itself is sometimes inadvertently used as that of their city. Thus, in 314 BC, Diodorus tells us that, by the treaty between Agathocles and the Carthaginians, it was stipulated that Heracleia, Selinus and Himera should continue subject to Carthage as they had been before. It is much more strange that we find the name of Himera reappear both in Mela and Pliny, though we know from the distinct statements of Cicero and Strabo, as well as Diodorus, that it had ceased to exist centuries before.

===Foundation of Thermae===

The new town of Thermae or Therma called for the sake of distinction Thermae Himerenses, which thus took the place of Himera, obviously derived its name from the hot springs for which it was celebrated, and the first discovery of which was connected by legends with the wanderings of Hercules. It appears to have early become a considerable town, though it continued, with few and brief exceptions, to be subject to the Carthaginian rule. In the First Punic War its name is repeatedly mentioned. Thus, in 260 BC, a body of Roman troops were encamped in the neighborhood, when they were attacked by Hamilcar, and defeated with heavy loss. Before the close of the war, Thermae itself was besieged and taken by the Romans. Cicero relates that the Roman government restored to the Thermitani their city and territory, with the free use of their own laws, as a reward for their steady fidelity. They were on hostile terms with Rome during the First Punic War, so it can only be to the subsequent period that these expressions apply; but the occasion to which they refer is unknown. In the time of Cicero, Thermae appears to have been a flourishing place, carrying on a considerable amount of trade, though the orator speaks, of it as &quot;oppidum non maximum&quot;. It seems to have received a colony in the time of Augustus, whence we find mention in inscriptions of the &quot;Ordo et Populus splendidissimae Coloniae Augustae Himeraeorum Thermitanorum&quot;: and there can be little doubt that the Thermae colonia of Pliny in reality refers to this town, though he evidently understood it to be Thermae Selinuntiae (modern Sciacca), as he places it on the south coast between Agrigentum and Selinus. There is little subsequent account of Thermae; but, as its name is found in Ptolemy and the Itineraries, it appears to have continued in existence throughout the period of the Roman Empire, and probably never ceased to be inhabited, as the modern town of Termini Imerese retains the ancient site as well as name. The magnificence of the ancient city, and the taste of its citizens for the encouragement of art, are attested by Cicero, who calls it &quot;in primis Siciliae clarum et ornatum&quot;; and some evidence of it remained, even in the days of that orator, in the statues preserved by the Thermitani, to whom they had been restored by Scipio, after the conquest of Carthage; and which were valuable, not only as relics of the past, but from their high merit as works of art. The numerous examples of coins from Himera testify to the city&#x27;s wealth in antiquity.

==Site==

The exact position of Himera was a subject of controversy until recent times. Cluverius was followed by almost all writers in the 19th century and placed it on the west bank of the river San Leonardo which flows past the west side of Termini. On this supposition the inhabitants moved from one bank of the river to the other which would explain the texts in which Himera and Thermae appear to be regarded as identical, and where the river Himera is also said to be flowing past Thermae.

Fazello correctly identified the Himera river with the Imera Settentrionale, the mouth of which is 8 miles from Termini. This distance was not too great to be reconciled with Cicero&#x27;s expression that the new settlement (Thermae) was established &quot;non longe ab oppido antique&quot;; while the addition that it was in the same territory would seem to imply that it was not very near the old site.

==Archaeology==

Many parts of the ancient city have been excavated in recent years and can be visited. Of the lower city the main visible remains consist of the monumental Tempio della Vittoria (Temple of Victory), a Doric structure built to commemorate the defeat of the Carthaginians.

The upper city on top of the hill has remains of other temples and of many other buildings.

At various locations around the city were the town&#x27;s necropoles and many artifacts recovered are displayed in both museums on site.

There are also impressive displays in Palermo&#x27;s Museo Archeologico Regionale.
==Famous people==
Himera is said to be the birthplace of the poet Stesichorus but in fact he was born in the Magna Graecian town of Metauros (modern Gioia Tauro) in 630BC. He moved to Himera in later life and wrote his poetry whilst a resident of the town.
Ergoteles, whose victory at the Olympic games is celebrated by Pindar, was a citizen, but not a native, of Himera. On the other hand, Thermae had the honour of being the birthplace of the tyrant Agathocles.

<text>Metroid Prime Hunters is a 2006 action-adventure game developed by Nintendo Software Technology and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS. It was released in North America in March 2006, with other territories later. The story takes place in between the events of &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; and &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot;. Players assume the role of series protagonist Samus Aran, who investigates a mysterious message that originated from the Alimbic Cluster and comes into contact with a legion of bounty hunters.

The game contains more first-person shooter aspects than previous titles in the &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; series, emphasizing various multiplayer modes with Wi-Fi and voice chat capabilities. It introduced new bounty hunters with unique weapons and alternative forms as well as the ability to travel to different planets with Samus&#x27; gunship, concepts later expanded upon in &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot;. &quot;Hunters&quot; was announced by Nintendo at the 2004 Electronic Entertainment Expo. A pack-in demo version of the game, titled &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt&quot;, was included with the Nintendo DS when it launched in November.

Reviews were generally favorable towards the game; praise focused on its gameplay and graphics, while criticism targeted its control scheme. It also received several honors; including an &quot;Editors&#x27; Choice&quot; award from &quot;IGN&quot;, which also named the game the &quot;Best DS Action Game&quot; of 2006, while &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; gave it awards for &quot;Best Graphics&quot;, &quot;Best Shooter/Action Game&quot;, and &quot;Best Wi-Fi Functionality&quot;. Over 410,000 copies of the game were sold in North America in its first month of release, and it was the fourth best-selling game during its debut month in Japan. &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; was re-released on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console service in Japan in 2015, and in North America and Europe the following year.

==Gameplay==
 with navigation and discovery being prominent gameplay elements. The game differs from its predecessors with the removal of assisted aiming, more action-oriented gameplay, and the inclusion of an online multiplayer mode. The player controls Samus Aran, who is equipped with a Power Suit that allows her to access her gunship from anywhere. She can scan almost any object in the game; the gunship will return relevant information retrieved from its database. An Arm Cannon is attached to the Power Suit, which she uses to attack enemies. To enter small tunnels, Samus can roll into a Morph Ball, an alternative form of the Power Suit that decreases her size substantially. In this form, she is given an unlimited supply of bombs but is only allowed to use three at a time. She can use the bombs to defend herself and destroy small objects.

In &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot;, the Nintendo DS&#x27;s top screen shows Samus&#x27;s HUD as seen from her visor, which displays the amount of remaining ammunition for the currently selected weapon along with her health; in multiplayer games, the number of kills and time remaining in the round are also shown. The bottom touchscreen displays the radar. When using the default control scheme, movement is controlled using the D-pad, and aiming is controlled by dragging the stylus along the touchscreen.

&quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; features a multiplayer mode that supports up to four players and includes voice chat capability. In it, the player is able to control Samus or one of six other bounty hunters featured in the single-player mode. Each bounty hunter has a unique alternative form, such as Samus&#x27;s Morph Ball, and a special weapon. The game host can set options for point and time limits, and restrict the use of radar. Computer-controlled players of varying skill levels can be added to games if the minimum of four players is not met.

==Synopsis==

===Setting and characters===

&quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; takes place between &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; and &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot;, and is set within the Alimbic Cluster in the Tetra Galaxy, where it was once ruled by the Alimbic race, who disappeared without notice, leaving artifacts scattered throughout the solar system. In the present, a telepathic message is sent from the Cluster to bounty hunters and other intelligent species, stating the key to the &quot;ultimate power&quot; resides there. The solar system consists of two planets (Alinos and Arcterra) and two space stations (the Celestial Archives and the Vesper Defense Outpost).

The protagonist of the single-player &quot;adventure mode&quot; is bounty hunter Samus Aran, who investigates the Alimbic Cluster after the Galactic Federation receives a telepathic message. During the investigation, Samus is confronted by six other bounty hunters: Sylux, a deadly sharpshooter who harbors a strong hatred for the Federation and Samus by association; Weavel, a cybernetic Space Pirate warrior who was injured in a battle with Samus; Trace, a feared member of the Kriken Empire; Kanden, a lab experiment and a supersoldier that was invincible; Noxus, a bounty hunter of the proud and reclusive Vhozon race; and Spire, the last of the silicon-based Diamonts.

===Plot===

The governing body of the galaxy, the Galactic Federation, receives a strange telepathic message. The Federation broadcasts a message to bounty hunter Samus Aran, asking her to investigate and retrieve the &quot;ultimate power&quot;, and should it prove irretrievable, to keep it secret or destroy it outright. Six other bounty hunters intercept the transmission and proceed to the Alimbic solar system to claim the power for themselves.

Through investigation of the planets and space stations that orbit the Alimbic sun, Samus gradually pieces together the history of the Alimbic race. She discovers that they were a peaceful, spiritual, highly evolved society. The Alimbic utopia was shattered when a comet struck the planet (Alinos), and out of it emerged a monstrous creature named Gorea. The creature copied the cellular structure of the Alimbics, physically mimicking them and their weapons, and destroyed their civilization. Unable to stop Gorea&#x27;s rampage, the last of their race transformed themselves into focused telepathic energy, then confined Gorea into a &quot;Seal Sphere&quot;, which they placed in a starship called the &quot;Oubliette&quot;. The ship was launched into a dimensional rift called the Infinity Void, to be released only when eight keys called &quot;Octoliths&quot; were assembled.

After warding off the other bounty hunters, Samus retrieves the eight Octoliths and opens the Infinity Void. Here, she and the other six hunters confront Gorea, who originated the telepathic message in an attempt to free itself. After the beast absorbs the powers of Samus&#x27; rivals, Samus engaged in a proacted battle with it. If she did not heed the words of the Alimbic prophecy by shooting seven colored panels in the arena with their representative sub-weapon in a particular sequence, Gorea&#x27;s demise would quickly destroy the &quot;Oubliette&quot; before any of the hunters could evacuate to safety. Otherwise, the panels would transport her and Gorea to another realm for a more definitive final battle where Gorea becomes invincible to all weapons, save for the new Alimbic weapon, the &quot;Omega Cannon&quot;, which Samus finds and uses to destroy Gorea once and for all. As Samus and the other hunters evacuate the exploding &quot;Oubliette&quot; on their respective ships, three Alimbic spirits appear before an armorless Samus, and honor her with a salute.

==Development==
The development team for &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; at Nintendo Software Technology (NST) was led by the game&#x27;s director, Masamichi Abe and the lead technical engineer, Colin Reed, who had both previously worked together on several games, including the Nintendo games &quot;Pikmin&quot; and &quot;1080° Snowboarding&quot;. The team for &quot;Hunters&quot; was composed of thirty people, which Abe noted was larger than the development team of most other Nintendo DS games. Kensuke Tanabe of Nintendo came up with the original idea for the game. Retro Studios, which developed previous &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; games, was unable to develop &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; because it was already working on a game. Therefore, Tanabe contacted NST with the idea, and let them develop it instead. NST developed the game instead of Nintendo themselves because Nintendo wanted the division to influence &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; with western ideals, styles, and presentation.

While developing the game, most of NST&#x27;s efforts were focused on its multiplayer aspect because of its first-person shooter gameplay, and to take advantage of the Wi-Fi and voice chat capabilities of the Nintendo DS. One of the game&#x27;s designers, Richard Vorodi, noted that &quot;the hardware kinda dictated their focus onto the game&#x27;s multiplayer mode&quot;. Wanting to introduce a new element to the &quot;Metroid&quot; series, Abe created several new bounty hunters after he realized that the game&#x27;s multiplayer mode and the new bounty hunters could both be implemented seamlessly into the game: &quot;We had this idea early on and thought that would be a good way to introduce &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; and the new bounty hunters to the gameplay and take advantage of that in the multiplayer&quot;. &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; includes several references to previous games in the &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; series. Samus&#x27; ship is from the original &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, and her suit is the same one that appears in &quot;Echoes&quot;. The developers decided to add them because they wanted to show that the technology has evolved, and they also wanted to include something that was instantly recognizable to those who had played previous games in the series. On level design, Abe said that as the game&#x27;s controls shifted from an analog stick method to touchscreen aiming, the developers wanted to avoid making the gameplay and the control scheme more difficult.

&quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; was first revealed at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2004, with &quot;IGN&quot; giving the game their Best Nintendo DS Game of E3 award. When Nintendo received negative feedback at E3 2005 about the game&#x27;s lack of an online feature, the company announced in August that the game&#x27;s release was delayed to give the developers time to implement Nintendo WFC support. After the game&#x27;s release was delayed to give NST time to implement the multiplayer feature, the developers took the time to make more changes. They worked on the game&#x27;s framerate to make the graphics move more smoothly. The game&#x27;s visuals were improved; a developer added reflections to the Morph Ball. The other developers admired the effect, and added it to other parts of the game. NST collaborated with Retro Studios, the company behind several &quot;Metroid&quot; games, to design the game&#x27;s art and characters to make sure that they fit into the overall &quot;Metroid&quot; series. When asked why &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; was placed between &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; and &quot;Metroid Prime 2: Echoes&quot; chronologically, Reed noted that the game was not influenced by the story of either game, so there were no continuity issues. He described &quot;Hunters&quot; as a side story to the &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; series.

==Marketing and release==

A preview of &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; was featured at E3 2004, which players control different colored variations of Samus in a deathmatch. A demo version, titled &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters: First Hunt&quot;, was included as a pack-in game with the Nintendo DS when it launched in North America on November 21. As a single-player game, it consists of training scenarios with no specific plot, while the multiplayer portion allows up to four players to compete via the Nintendo DS&#x27; local wireless communications. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; wrote a positive review for the demo, citing it as &quot;a fine showcase for demonstrating what the Nintendo DS hardware is capable of&quot;. In early 2006, a preview video for &quot;Hunters&quot; was made available for download through the DS Download Station. A playable demo was also available from the Download Station in North America.

In 2006, Nintendo promoted the release of &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; in the United States with a television commercial, featuring a gravedigger burying dead bounty hunters in a futuristic setting. The commercial was directed by Len Wiseman, known for his work on the &quot;Underworld&quot; series, and was produced by the Leo Burnett Worldwide, while the special effects were handled by Ntropic. According to Wiseman, the commercial intends to &quot;give the players a sense of how high the body count is going to be in this game, the amount of mayhem, and just how vicious Samus can be&quot;. In May, Nintendo of Europe and HMV held the &quot;Hunt Is On Tournament&quot; competition in several locations throughout the United Kingdom, with BT Openzone providing a video link.

&quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; was released on March 20, 2006 in North America, followed by the release in Europe on May 5, in Australia on May 23, in Japan on June 1, and in South Korea on December 6, 2007. The game was later re-released on the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console service, in Japan on September 30, 2015, in North America on June 2, 2016, and in Europe on September 15.

==Reception==
&quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; was given &quot;generally favorable&quot; reviews, according to Metacritic. Several reviews praised the amount of value that &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; offered on the Nintendo DS handheld video game console. &quot;GameZone&quot; considered the game phenomenal, and believed that it used the DS to its maximum potential regarding graphical ability and innovation. &quot;The Toronto Sun&quot; remarked that the graphics were big enough selling points on their own for the game, and &quot;The Press&quot; called &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; the best-looking game for the Nintendo DS. &quot;The Australian&quot; agreed that the graphics are &quot;outstanding&quot; and push the Nintendo DS to its limits, and &quot;The Independent&quot; asserted that &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; was perhaps the best first-person shooter ever for a handheld console. &quot;GamePro&quot; was surprised how Nintendo squeezed &quot;Hunters&quot; into a small DS cartridge. Despite a few &quot;small quirks&quot;, the magazine noted that &quot;Hunters&quot; &quot;is a very polished game&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot; concurred with these claims, noting that the touchscreen capability worked very vell on the system.

&quot;GameRevolution&quot; admired the &quot;high-quality work&quot; found in the game&#x27;s production design and smooth online play. &quot;1UP.com&quot; asserted that fans of the &quot;Metroid&quot; series should recognize the technical achievements that the game showcases. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; lauded &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot;″ gameplay, and believed that the game was strictly for hardcore gamers &quot;who live for fragfests&quot;. Convinced that making a &quot;Metroid&quot; game different from its slow-paced adventure predecessors into a &quot;nail-biting wrecking ball&quot; was a &quot;risky trick&quot;, they appreciated the results. Both &quot;GameSpot&quot; and &quot;Game Informer&quot; enjoyed the game&#x27;s &quot;worthwhile&quot; and &quot;electrifying&quot; multiplayer mode. &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; praised the game as a &quot;new-school, action-packed&quot; game that makes a &quot;great addition to the growing collection of Wi-Fi titles&quot;, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; claimed the game&#x27;s multiplayer aspect as their favorite feature. &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; wrote that &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; does a &quot;staggering job&quot; of replicating the style of previous &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; games.

Complaints about the game stemmed primarily from its control scheme. &quot;IGN&quot; found that the high learning curve and &quot;cramp-inducing&quot; control scheme made it difficult to play. This sentiment was shared by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;, which claimed that placing the interface used to switch visors and weapons on the touchscreen made the process unnecessarily complex. The magazine was also disappointed with the game&#x27;s single-player mode, claiming that it does not live up to the experience offered in previous games in the &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; series. They criticized the levels as &quot;contrived and predictable&quot;, and noted that the designs felt too formulaic &quot;after a few worlds of hunting for keys, fighting repeat bosses, and escaping before the bomb blows&quot;. &quot;The Washington Times&quot; agreed that the game&#x27;s repetitiveness eventually grew tiring, and that &quot;manipulating the DS controls will be a painfully cramped endeavor&quot;.

Concurring with this sentiment, &quot;GameSpy&quot; noted that using the stylus to play the game felt a bit strange. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; also expressed their disapproval of the control scheme, predicting it would lead to &quot;the coming years of physiotherapy on [their] arms&quot;. They were also unhappy with the game&#x27;s &quot;flimsy&quot; multiplayer experience, noting that it is best used when played locally with friends who also have the game. &quot;X-Play&quot; had particularly negative sentiments about the game, feeling that it was poorly implemented into the hardware.

&quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; was the fourth best-selling game in its debut month in Japan, selling 32,467 units, and has since sold over 90,000 units there. Over 410,000 units of the game were sold in North America in 2006. &quot;Hunters&quot; received several awards and honors. &quot;IGN&quot; gave it an &quot;Editors&#x27; Choice&quot; award, and named it the &quot;Best DS Action Game&quot; of 2006. The game also received the awards for &quot;Best Graphics&quot;, &quot;Best Shooter/Action Game&quot;, and &quot;Best Wi-Fi Functionality&quot; from &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; for 2006.

==Appearances in other games==
The bounty hunters in &quot;Metroid Prime Hunters&quot; are featured in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot; as unlockable character trophies. Sylux also makes a minor appearance in &quot;Metroid Prime 3: Corruption&quot;, where he follows Samus in the game&#x27;s ending. Tanabe said in E3 2015 that he wanted to create a story that centers around Samus and Sylux, noting that &quot;there&#x27;s something going on between them. I want to make a game that touches upon it&quot;. With a Nintendo 3DS game, &quot;Metroid Prime: Federation Force&quot;, Tanabe hoped that &quot;Federation Force&quot; plot would lead to future &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; games based on the relationship between Samus and Sylux, with additional involvement from the Galactic Federation marines. &quot;Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&quot; is marketed to have Sylux as a major antagonist, following up on the tease shown in &quot;Metroid Prime 3&quot;.

<text>The 1954 Asian Games (), officially known as the Second Asian Games – Manila 1954 was a multi-sport event held in Manila, Philippines, from May 1 to 9, 1954. A total of 970 athletes from 19 Asian National Olympic Committees (NOCs) competed in 76 events from eight sports. The number of participating NOCs and athletes were larger than the previous Asian Games held in New Delhi in 1951. This edition of the games has a different twist where it did not implement a medal tally system to determine the overall champion but a pointing system. The pointing system is a complex system where each athlete were given points according to their achievement like position in athletics or in swimming. In the end the pointing system showed to be worthless as it simply ranked the nations the same way in the medal tally system. The pointing system was not implemented in future games ever since. Jorge B. Vargas was the head of the Philippine Amateur Athletic Federation (now known as Philippine Olympic Committee since 1976) and the Manila Asian Games Organizing Committee. With the second-place finish of the Philippines, only around 9,000 spectators attended the closing ceremony at the Rizal Memorial Stadium. The events were broadcast on radio live at DZRH and DZAQ-TV ABS-3 on delayed telecast.

==Opening ceremony==
The Games were formally opened by President Ramon Magsaysay on May 1, 1954, at 16:02 local time. Around 20,000 spectators filled the Rizal Memorial Stadium in Malate, Manila, for the opening ceremony. As requested by the IOC, the torch relay and lighting of the cauldron were excluded from the Opening Ceremony to preserve the tradition of the Olympic Games. The torch ceremony were returned at the 1958 Asian Games. The host however gave a solution by giving a special citation to the last athlete to enter the parade. The Philippines, as host, was the last country to enter the stadium. The flag bearer for the Philippines squad was Andres Franco, who won a gold medal in the 1951 Asian Games in high jump event, the sole gold medal of any Filipino in the athletics events of the previous Asian Games.

==Sports==

The 1954 Asian Games featured eight sports divided into 10 events, aquatics included three events namely diving, swimming and water polo. This version of the Asian Games comprised more sports and events than the last one, as six sports and seven events were in the calendar of 1951 Asian Games. Three sports—boxing, shooting and wrestling—made their debut, while cycling was dropped out.

<text>Let&#x27;s Roll with Roland Butter is a children&#x27;s TV series that aired on CITV in 2004. The show was made for only one series. The first episode was broadcast in July 2004, and as of 2021, hasn&#x27;t had any reruns.

== Premise ==
The show starred Peter Cocks as Roland Butter, a tubby teenager who is obsessed with sport. Each week, Roland tried out various different activities, such as football, rugby, and skateboarding. Naturally, none of these go according to plan. The episodes were supposedly filmed by Roland&#x27;s best friend, Keef (played by Karl Sedgwick).

== Peter Cocks ==
The show was created and written by Peter Cocks. Cocks had previously worked on several CITV shows, including &quot;Holly &amp; Stephen&#x27;s Saturday Showdown&quot; and &quot;The Basil Brush Show&quot;.

<text>Francesco Antonio Rosetti (c. 1750 – 30 June 1792) was a classical era composer and double bass player, and was a contemporary of Haydn and Mozart. There is considerable confusion regarding his name. The occasional mention of a supposed, but non-existent, &quot;Antonio Rosetti born 1744 in Milan&quot;, is due to an error by Ernst Ludwig Gerber in a later edition of his &quot;Tonkünstler-Lexikon&quot; having mistaken Rosetti for an Italian in the first edition of his own Lexikon, and therefore including Rosetti twice - once as an Italian, once as a German-Czech. Many sources claim that he was born Franz Anton Rösler, and changed his name to an Italianate form by 1773, but according to a 1792 article by Heinrich Phillip Bossler, who knew Rosetti personally, he was named Rosetti from his birth. 

==Life and career==
Rosetti was born about 1750 in Litoměřice, a town in Northern Bohemia. He is believed to have received early musical training from the Jesuits in Prague. In 1773 Rosetti left his native country and found employment in the Hofkapelle of Prince Kraft Ernst of Oettingen-Wallerstein whom he served for sixteen years, becoming Kapellmeister in 1785. While there, he orchestrated two piano concerti by Anna von Schaden. In July 1789 Rosetti left Wallerstein to accept the post of Kapellmeister to the Duke Friedrich Franz I of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in Ludwigslust where he died in service of the duke on 30 June 1792 at the age of 42 years. In 1777, he married Rosina Neher, with whom he had three daughters. In late 1781 he was granted leave to spend 5 months in Paris. Many of the finest ensembles in the city performed his works. Rosetti arranged for his music to be published, including a set of six symphonies published in 1782. He returned to his post, assured of recognition as an accomplished composer.

Rosetti wrote over 400 compositions, primarily instrumental music including many symphonies and concertos which were widely published. Rosetti also composed a significant number of vocal and choral works, particularly in the last few years of his life. Among these are German oratorios including &quot;Der sterbende Jesu&quot; and &quot;Jesus in Gethsemane&quot; (1790) and a German &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. The English music historian Charles Burney included Rosetti among the most popular composers of the period in his work &quot;A General History of Music&quot;. Rosetti is perhaps best known today for his horn concertos, which Mozart scholar H. C. Robbins Landon suggests (in &quot;The Mozart Companion&quot;) may have been a model for Mozart&#x27;s four horn concertos. Rosetti is also known for writing a Requiem (1776) which was performed at a memorial for Mozart in December 1791.

Attributing some music to Rosetti is difficult because several other composers with similar names worked at the same time, including Franciscus Xaverius Antonius Rössler.

<text>The Isle of Wight Steam Railway is a heritage railway on the Isle of Wight. The railway passes through of countryside from to station, passing through the small village of Havenstreet, where the line has a station, headquarters and a depot. At Smallbrook Junction, the steam railway connects with the Island Line.

==Operation==
The railway is owned and operated by the Isle of Wight Railway Co. Ltd. and run largely by volunteers. Services are operated on most days from June to September, together with selected days in April, May, and October and public holidays. The railway is popular with tourists, attracting people to its original steam locomotive and railway cafe. Over each August Bank Holiday weekend, the railway organises the Island Steam Show, which combines an intensive service on the railway with displays of various sorts of steam power including traction engines and steam fair equipment, together with other attractions that vary year by year. For events like steam galas and Day Out with Thomas events, engines from the mainland have to be brought in by boat and then transferred to Havenstreet.

==Rolling stock==

The railway has several steam locomotives and a small series of diesel shunters, four of which have had notable careers on the island. To complement the collection, numerous examples of pre-grouping carriages have been recovered and restored. The oldest of these were built in 1864 and the last in 1924. There are also more than 45 units of freight rolling stock, the oldest of which dates from circa 1860.

In 2020, the railway announced the acquisition of its first electrical multiple unit, British Rail Class 483 483007. The train, nicknamed &quot;Jess Harper&quot;, has been transferred from the adjacent Island Line for static exhibition in the Train Story museum.

==Carriage shed==
To allow the railway&#x27;s collection of Victorian and Edwardian carriages to be kept undercover, away from the effects of weather and vandals, a rolling stock storage and display building has been built at Havenstreet. A four-road shed, with each road capable of storing four bogie coaches or their equivalent, amounting to a total size of 75 by 25 metres has been built, and track work is currently being completed. By December 2008, £71,000 had been raised by the railway, and as of May 2012, the railway was awaiting information to see if a grant application from the Heritage Lottery towards the £815,000 cost was successful. This was successful and the shed is now operational with public access to see the stock inside.

==History==
The first railway on the Isle of Wight opened in 1862, linking Newport and Cowes. It became the nucleus of the Isle of Wight Central Railway. The line from Ryde to Newport was opened in 1875 and by 1890 the island was served by an extensive network of lines. However most of these lines were relatively poorly maintained and had a low level of traffic, reflecting the general isolation and poverty of the island.

These factors meant that the island&#x27;s railways could rarely afford to acquire new locomotives or rolling stock and instead relied on using already elderly equipment transferred from the mainland. Much of the equipment currently used on the Isle of Wight Steam Railway, and particularly the passenger coaching stock, falls into this category, representing usage on the island in the early and mid twentieth century but also the mid to late nineteenth century on the mainland. This is of particular historic interest as representing an earlier era than almost all other preserved railways in Britain. The steam locomotives in use include examples well over 100 years old, but also some more modern types.

The first railway closures on the Island were in 1952. Then in 1966 the Ryde–Newport–Cowes and Shanklin–Ventnor lines were closed. The last steam services on the island ran on the remaining Ryde to Shanklin line on 31 December 1966. However a small group of rail enthusiasts formed the Wight Locomotive Society and raised funds to preserve one of the last steam locomotives, W24 &quot;Calbourne&quot;, and a number of the remaining carriages. Then, in 1971, the Isle of Wight Railway Co. Ltd. was formed to buy the length of track between Wootton and Havenstreet. From that early beginning, the railway has been gradually extended from Havenstreet towards Ryde. In 1991 this extension reached Smallbrook Junction on the Ryde – Shanklin line, where a new interchange station was built there allowing passengers to interchange with Island Line trains.

An extension of the line westwards from Wootton to Newport has been suggested in the past. It is unlikely that the full extent will ever be restored as there is now a road on the site of Newport station and houses have been built on another part of the former line. However a stretch of trackbed from Wootton to the outskirts of Newport at Halberry Lane is still free from development and could in theory be used in the future. Another possible extension is one from Smallbrook Junction to Ryde St John&#x27;s Road station, using one of the two Island Line tracks on this stretch.

The Haven Falconry Bird of Prey Centre was situated in the grounds of Haventreet until 2024, when their contract expired. They have since moved to Butterfly World.

<doc id="923203" wikidata="Q322456" url="?curid=923203" title="Norris Bradbury">
<text>Norris Edwin Bradbury (May 30, 1909 – August 20, 1997), was an American physicist who served as director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory for 25 years from 1945 to 1970. He succeeded Robert Oppenheimer, who personally chose Bradbury for the position of director after working closely with him on the Manhattan Project during World War II. Bradbury was in charge of the final assembly of &quot;the Gadget&quot;, detonated in July 1945 for the Trinity test.

Bradbury took charge at Los Alamos at a difficult time. Staff were leaving in droves, living conditions were poor and there was a possibility that the laboratory would close. He managed to persuade enough staff to stay and got the University of California to renew the contract to manage the laboratory. He pushed continued development of nuclear weapons, transforming them from laboratory devices to production models. Numerous improvements made them safer, more reliable and easier to store and handle, and made more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel.

In the 1950s Bradbury oversaw the development of thermonuclear weapons, although a falling-out with Edward Teller over the priority given to their development led to the creation of a rival nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. In later years, he branched out, constructing the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility to develop the laboratory&#x27;s role in nuclear science, and during the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory developed the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The Bradbury Science Museum is named in his honor.

== Early life ==
Norris Bradbury was born in Santa Barbara, California, on May 30, 1909, one of four children of Edwin Perley Bradbury and his wife Elvira née Clausen. One sister died as an infant, and the family adopted twins Bobby and Betty, both of whom served in the United States Marine Corps during World War II. Bradbury was educated at Hollywood High School and Chaffey High School in Ontario, California, graduating at the age of 16. He then attended Pomona College in Claremont, California, from which he graduated summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) in chemistry in 1929. This earned him membership of Phi Beta Kappa society. At Pomona, he met Lois Platt, an English Literature major who was the sister of his college roommate. They were married in 1933, and had three sons, James, John, and David. Norris was an active member of an Episcopal church.

Bradbury became interested in physics and did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley, where he was a teaching fellow from 1929 to 1931. He submitted a PhD thesis on &quot;Studies on the Mobility of Gaseous Ions&quot; under the supervision of Leonard B. Loeb, and was awarded a National Research Council fellowship.

As well as supervising Bradbury&#x27;s thesis, Loeb, who had served as a naval reservist during World War I, encouraged Bradbury to apply for a commission as a naval reservist. Bradbury&#x27;s commission as an ensign was signed by Lieutenant Commander Chester W. Nimitz, who was the head of the Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps at Berkeley at the time.

After two years at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bradbury became an assistant professor of physics at Stanford University in 1935, rising to become an associate professor in 1938, and a full professor in 1943. He became an expert on the electrical conductivity of gases, the properties of ions, and the behavior of atmospheric electricity, publishing in journals including the &quot;Physical Review&quot;, &quot;Journal of Applied Physics&quot;, &quot;Journal of Chemical Physics&quot;, and the &quot;Journal of Atmospheric Electricity and Terrestrial Magnetism&quot;. He invented the Bradbury-Nielsen shutter, a type of electrical ion gate, widely used in mass spectrometry in both time-of-flight mass spectrometers and ion mobility spectrometers.

== World War II ==
Bradbury was called up for service in World War II in early 1941, although the Navy allowed him to stay at Stanford until the end of the academic year. He was then sent to the Naval Proving Ground at Dahlgren, Virginia, to work on external ballistics. Already working at Dahlgren were Loeb and Commander Deak Parsons.

In June 1944, Bradbury received orders from Parsons, who was now the deputy director of the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Los Alamos Laboratory, to report to Albuquerque, New Mexico. Parsons explained that he needed Bradbury to work on the explosive lenses required by an implosion-type nuclear weapon. Bradbury was less than enthusiastic about the prospect, but he was a naval officer, and ultimately agreed to go.

At Los Alamos, Bradbury became head of E-5, the Implosion Experimentation Group, which put him in charge of the implosion field test program. In August, the laboratory&#x27;s director, Robert Oppenheimer, implemented a sweeping reorganization. E-5 became part of George Kistiakowsky&#x27;s new Explosives Division (X Division), and was renumbered X-1. At this point, Bradbury was leading some of the most critical work at the laboratory, as it struggled with the jets that spoiled the perfect spherical shape desired for the implosion process. These were examined with a combination of magnetic, X-ray and RaLa techniques.

In March 1945, Oppenheimer created Project Alberta under Parsons to carry out the Manhattan Project&#x27;s ultimate mission: the preparation and delivery of nuclear weapons in combat. Bradbury was transferred to Project Alberta to head the Fat Man assembly group. In July 1945, Bradbury supervised the preparation of &quot;the Gadget&quot;, as the bomb was known, at the Trinity nuclear test. &quot;For me to say&quot;, Bradbury later recalled, &quot;I had any deep emotional thoughts about Trinity... I didn&#x27;t. I was just damned pleased that it went off.&quot;

== Director of Los Alamos ==
Oppenheimer submitted his resignation as director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, but remained until a successor could be found. The director of the Manhattan Project, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., wanted someone with both a solid academic background and a high standing within the project. Oppenheimer recommended Bradbury. This was agreeable to Groves, who liked the fact that as a naval officer Bradbury was both a military man and a scientist. Bradbury accepted the offer on a six-month trial basis.

Parsons arranged for Bradbury to be quickly discharged from the Navy, which awarded him the Legion of Merit for his wartime services. He remained in the Naval Reserve, though, ultimately retiring in 1961 with the rank of captain. On October 16, 1945, there was a ceremony at Los Alamos at which Groves presented the laboratory with the Army-Navy &quot;E&quot; Award, and presented Oppenheimer with a certificate of appreciation. Bradbury became the laboratory&#x27;s second director the following day.

The first months of Bradbury&#x27;s directorship were particularly difficult. He had hoped that Atomic Energy Act of 1946 would be quickly passed by Congress and the wartime Manhattan Project would be superseded by a new, permanent organization. It soon became clear that this would take more than six months. President Harry S. Truman did not sign the act creating the Atomic Energy Commission into law until August 1, 1946, and it did not become active until January 1, 1947. In the meantime, Groves&#x27; legal authority to act was limited.

Most of the scientists at Los Alamos were eager to return to their laboratories and universities, and by February 1946 all of the wartime division heads had left, but a talented core remained. Darol Froman became head of Robert Bacher&#x27;s G division, now renamed M Division. Eric Jette became responsible for Chemistry and Metallurgy, John H. Manley for Physics, George Placzek for Theory, Max Roy for Explosives, and Roger Wagner for Ordnance. The number of personnel at Los Alamos plummeted from its wartime peak of over 3,000 to around 1,000, but many were still living in temporary wartime accommodation. To make matters worse, the water pipe to Los Alamos froze and the water had to be supplied by tanker trucks. Despite the reduced staff, Bradbury still had to provide support for Operation Crossroads, the nuclear tests in the Pacific.

Bradbury pushed continued development of nuclear weapons to take them from laboratory devices to production models. There were numerous improvements that could make them more safe, reliable and easy to store and handle, and make more efficient use of scarce fissionable materiel. While Bradbury gave priority to improved fission weapons, research still continued on &quot;Alarm Clock&quot;, a boosted nuclear weapon, and the &quot;Super&quot;, a thermonuclear weapons design. The new fission designs were tested during Operation Sandstone in 1948. The Mark 4 nuclear bomb became the first nuclear weapon to be mass-produced on an assembly line.

As the future became more certain, Bradbury began looking for a new site for the laboratory away from the crowded town center. In 1948, Bradbury submitted a proposal to the Atomic Energy Commission for a new $107 million facility on the South Mesa, linked to the town by a new bridge over the canyon.

All this time, Bradbury remained nominally a professor in absentia at Stanford. The Los Alamos Laboratory was nominally run under a wartime contract with the University of California, but a clause in the contract allowed the University to terminate the contract three months after the end of the war. The university duly served notice, but Bradbury managed to get it rescinded, and in 1948 the contract was renewed. In 1951, he became a professor at the University of California.

By 1951, the laboratory had come up with the Teller-Ulam design, and thermonuclear tests were conducted during Operation Greenhouse. Tensions between Bradbury and Edward Teller over the degree of priority given to thermonuclear weapons development led to the creation of a second nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.

In later years, Bradbury branched out, constructing the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility to develop the laboratory&#x27;s role in nuclear science. During the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory worked on Project Rover, developing the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The laboratory demonstrated the feasibility and value of nuclear rocket propulsion.

For many years, Bradbury was responsible for much of the administration of the town of Los Alamos. The town established impressive health and education facilities. Eventually the new technical area was built outside the town, and on February 18, 1957, the security gates were taken down. Finally, the town became an incorporated community and the director&#x27;s civic responsibilities ended.

In 1966, Bradbury was awarded the Department of Defense Medal for Distinguished Public Service for &quot;exceptionally meritorious civilian service to the Armed Forces and the United States of America in a position of great responsibility as director, Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory&quot;. His citation went on to say that &quot;The outstanding international reputation of the Los Alamos Laboratory is directly attributable to his exceptional leadership. The United States is indebted to Dr. Bradbury and his laboratory, to a very large degree, for our present nuclear capability.&quot; He also received the Enrico Fermi Award in 1970. In 1971, he received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

== Later life ==
Bradbury retired as director of Los Alamos Laboratory in 1970. His successor, Harold Agnew, invited him to become a senior consultant, but Bradbury declined the offer, although he did serve as a consultant for other government agencies, including the National Academy of Sciences, and as a member of the boards of the Los Alamos Medical Center, the First National Bank of Santa Fe, the Los Alamos YMCA and the Santa Fe Neurological Society.

In 1969 the governor of New Mexico, David Cargo, appointed Bradbury as a regent of the University of New Mexico, but this was a turbulent time for the university. In response to the Kent State Shootings in May 1970, students and antiwar activist Jane Fonda marched on the home of Ferrel Heady, the president of the University of New Mexico. When he refused to meet with them, the students called a strike. Classes were cancelled, rallies were held and students occupied the Student Union Building. Cargo called in the New Mexico National Guard to remove them, and eleven people were bayoneted. Cargo&#x27;s successor, Bruce King, replaced Bradbury and another regent.

In the mid-1990s, Bradbury accidentally hit his leg while chopping firewood. Gangrene set in, and his right leg was amputated below the knee. It spread to his left leg, and part of his left foot was amputated, leaving him in a wheelchair. The disease eventually proved fatal, and he died on August 20, 1997. He was survived by his wife Lois, who died in January 1998, and his three sons. A funeral service was held in Los Alamos, and he was buried at Guaje Pines Cemetery in Los Alamos.

<doc id="923208" wikidata="Q1748135" url="?curid=923208" title="Vacuum mattress">
<text>A vacuum mattress, or vacmat, is a medical device used for the immobilisation of patients, especially in case of a vertebra, pelvis or limb trauma (especially for femur trauma). It is also used for manual transportation of patients for short distances (it replaces the stretcher). It was invented by Loed and Haederlé, who called it &quot;shell&quot; mattress (&quot;matelas coquille&quot; in French).

== Medical uses ==
The full spine immobilisation (splint) is performed with: a rigid cervical collar, a vacuum mattress and a stretcher under it (the longitudinal stiffness of the mattress alone is not sufficient).

=== Preparation of the vacuum mattress ===
The vacuum mattress is put on a stretcher or possibly on a long spine board. The straps are put under the mattress, along its side, so they do not reach the ground. Then, the polystyrene balls are distributed evenly through the mattress by shaking its surface. (A section with fewer balls would be less rigid, conversely if balls are concentrated at any given point this becomes more rigid.) A sheet is put on the mattress, folded so it will be possible to pull it to wrap the casualty into using an S-fold and finally a team member should double-check the pump (manual or electrical) is set to either pump air out of the bag.

=== Moulding the mattress ===
There are three ways to put the casualty on the vacuum mattress:
* lifting the casualty and pushing the stretcher under it. This method requires a minimum of five team members (four lifting and one pushing the stretcher) and should be used when a spine or a pelvis trauma are suspected;
* the casualty is lifted with a scoop stretcher. The scoop stretcher is put on the mattress and opened to release the casualty;
* the casualty is lifted on a long spine board. The board is put on the mattress and the casualty is lifted (best with four team members) and one team member removes the board.
In all cases, the vacuum valve is up and at the feet of the casualty.

Once the casualty is on the mattress, the sheet is wrapped around him/her and the sides of the mattress are folded against their body. The top of the head must be kept clear (the mattress could retract when pumping out the air and thus compress the spine). The air is pumped until the mattress is rigid, then the valve is closed and the straps are fastened.

When only three team members are available and there is no scoop stretcher, the following procedure can be used:
# the vacuum mattress is put besides the casualty, on a protecting ground sheet, and partially depressed (three manual pumping) to make it more rigid and thinner. A sheet is put on the mattress, closer to the casualty;
# the casualty is put on their side, with a procedure that is similar to the recovery position;
# the team member at the legs pushes the mattress against the back of the casualty. The ground sheet helps to slide the mattress on the floor;
# the casualty is put on their back, overlapping the side of the mattress;
# the casualty is centred on the mattress; the sheet helps sliding the casualty on the mattress;
# the straps are tied to mould the mattress. The team leader moulds the sides of the head manually;
# the air is pumped;
# a long spine board is placed along the axis of the mattress. Two team members face each other and hold the mattress&#x27;s handles at the head and at the thighs. They lift a few centimetres, the ground sheet is removed and the board is slid under the mattress to ensure longitudinal rigidity;
# the board can then be lifted (with the mattress on it), and put on the stretcher.
While the lifting methods can induce a flexing of the spine, this rolling method can be hazardous for several reasons: the risk of a torsion of the spine when rolling, the risk when sliding the casualty on the mattress, the risk of anteversion of the hips (and thus of flexing of the spine) due to the weight of the legs when lifting the mattress to slide the board.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
The vacuum mattress is an alternative to the use of a long spine board. Its advantages are:
* Comfort.
* Being adaptable to all traumas (included spinal and femoral traumas).
* The patient is held more securely.
* The patient is more easily transported short distances provided sufficient team members (typically six) are available, and in confined spaces compared to a conventional stretcher.
* Distributes pressure more equally on body surfaces, leading to lower risk for pressure ulcer formation compared to a long board
Its drawbacks include:
* Relatively fragile (useless unless a perfect vacuum is maintained).
* Increased cost relative to a traditional long spine board
* The time taken to evacuate the bag compared to readily available standard spinal board.

==Operation==
A vacuum mattress consists of a sealed air-tight (typically polymer) bag enclosing small beads (typically polystyrene balls) and fitted with one or more valves. While at ambient air pressure, the beads free to move, but when the mattress has been moulded and the air evacuated, external atmospheric pressure locks the beads in place (jamming) and the mattress becomes rigid.

When used medically this principle allows a patient who is put onto the mattress (e.g. with a scoop stretcher), the sides of the mattress arranged around the patient and when the air inside is evacuated the mattress forms a conformal cradle allowing an injury to be stabilised, straps fastened, and the patient protected sufficiently well that they can be transported.

For this reason the bag is typically bigger than an adult human body (though the same principle may be employed to create an &#x27;instant&#x27; cast to stabilise an injured limb). In use, a sheet is usually put on the vacuum mattress to:
* Protect the mattress from penetration, preserving the integrity of the air-tight bag. (The casualty may have broken glass on their clothes or be wearing jewellery that might puncture the mattress.)
* Avoid direct contact of the skin with plastic (The patient may be releasing body fluids.)
* To assist in transferring the patient at the emergency room.

<text>A CSU/DSU (channel service unit/data service unit) is a digital-interface device used to connect data terminal equipment (DTE), such as a router, to a digital circuit, such as a Digital Signal 1 (DS1) T1 line. The CSU/DSU implements two different functions. The channel service unit (CSU) is responsible for the connection to the telecommunication network, while the data service unit (DSU) is responsible for managing the interface with the DTE. A CSU/DSU can have an external connection point or it can be integrated into a modular card installed in a router.

A CSU/DSU is the equivalent of the modem for an entire LAN. The DCE, commonly a modem or CSU/DSU, is the device used to convert the user data from the DTE into a form acceptable to the WAN service provider transmission link.
==WAN interface==
The WAN Interface Card (WIC) may contain an integrated CSU/DSU that can be inserted into a router slot. An example of a WIC is the 1-port 56/64-kbit/s DSU/CSU WIC (WIC-1DSU-56K4) by Cisco Systems. DTE is generally a router, but can also be a terminal, computer, printer, or fax machine if they connect directly to the service provider network.

<doc id="923210" wikidata="Q901893" url="?curid=923210" title="Dante (Devil May Cry)">
<text>, also known under the alias of , is a character and the protagonist of &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, an action-adventure game series by Japanese developer and publisher Capcom. Introduced as the protagonist of the 2001 game with the same name, Dante is a devil hunter dedicated to exterminating them and other supernatural foes in revenge for losing his mother Eva and having his older twin brother, Vergil, lost. He is the son of Sparda, inheriting demonic powers which he uses with a variety of weapons in the games. The character also appears in several &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; novels and manga volumes and is featured in the 2007 anime television series. Dante has also made multiple guest appearances in crossover games. Since 2005, he has been portrayed in voice acting and motion capture by Reuben Langdon.

Named after the Italian poet Dante Alighieri, the character was designed to fit &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; game designer Hideki Kamiya&#x27;s vision of a &quot;cool and stylish&quot; man; his personality was based on the title character of the &quot;Cobra&quot; manga series. Dante has been modified in response to criticism in his role in &quot;Devil May Cry 2&quot; (2003) as his personality changed making him more serious and less talkative, drifting away from his original persona. &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot; (2005) features a young, cocky Dante, and in the following games an older yet still cocky Dante. Capcom handles the character in the main &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; series, while Ninja Theory oversaw his persona in &quot;DmC: Devil May Cry&quot; (2013).

Dante&#x27;s characterization as a cocky demon hunter with supernatural abilities has turned him into one of the most iconic protagonists in gaming ever since his introduction. Reuben Langdon&#x27;s portrayal of Dante has also been the subject of praise. Comparatively, his redesign and characterization in &quot;DmC: Devil May Cry&quot; was highly controversial for the drastic change of his appearance, most notably his iconic white hair.

== Concept and influences ==
Dante debuted in &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, a game originally intended as part of Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Resident Evil&quot; franchise. Series creator Hideki Kamiya rewrote the story, taking it from &quot;Divine Comedy,&quot; written by Dante Alighieri. He was originally going to be a Western policeman. His early name, Tony Redgrave, served as a reference to one of the characters from &quot;Resident Evil&quot;, Chris Redfield. According to Kamiya, the title character of Buichi Terasawa&#x27;s &quot;Cobra&quot; manga series was the basis of Dante&#x27;s personality. To give the character&#x27;s &quot;stylishness&quot; he dressed him in a long coat to make him &quot;showy&quot; and made him a non-smoker; Kamiya saw that as &quot;more cool&quot;. Dante wears red clothing—the traditional Japanese color for a heroic figure—in contrast to Leon S. Kennedy, a character Kamiya created for &quot;Resident Evil 2&quot;, who wears blue clothes.

Kamiya said that he saw Dante as &quot;a character that you would want to go out drinking with&quot;, someone who was not a show-off but would &quot;pull some ridiculous, mischievous joke&quot; instead to endear people to him (and make the character familiar to audiences). When asked about the relationship between Dante and Trish, Kamiya said their bond was superior to love. Kamiya&#x27;s keywords when describing the character were &quot;composure&quot; and &quot;ambiance&quot;. Although Kamiya was not the main writer of the first two &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; novels, he saw Shinya Goikeda&#x27;s depiction of Dante as similar to his own. In development, Dante was originally called Tony Redgrade, and did not carry a sword.

&quot;Devil May Cry&quot; was designed from the ground up around Dante&#x27;s acrobatics and combat abilities. Kamiya gave Tsuchibayashi freedom when designing Dante though there were concept arts Kamiya did not accept. Tsuchibayashi produced the 3D model based on other staff member&#x27;s clothing and an unclear relationship between Dante and Trish. The Devil Trigger form gave him difficulties to the idea of giving him wings and altering his face, resulting in the artist performing to many sketches. An alternate outfit was developed featuring an older Dante though the designer never asked for specifics about. Nevertheless, he believes this design made Dante look more like Vergil. Tsuchibayashi says other sketches did not provide more difficulties as there was no need to match his personality.

Hideaki Itsuno said that for &quot;Devil May Cry 5&quot;, Dante was influenced by mecha anime he watched when he was young. Itsuno cited the character&#x27;s conflict with his family but while showing powers that would reveal mechas. Itsuno views Dante&#x27;s early defeat by Vergil&#x27;s alterego Urizen and his awakening of new devil powers alongside his new sword Dante as one of the most important changes in his characterization in &quot;Devil May Cry 5&quot;.
===Redesigns===

After the success of the first &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; game, Capcom inserted Dante into a game already in development. This necessitated the maturing of his characterisation. Dante&#x27;s change to a more-taciturn character was a decision made by a producer who disliked his previous incarnation. The staff aimed to make him look older—in his 30s—than his original self, implying that something dramatic had happened to change his personality. Dante and Lucia dressed in Diesel fashions appealed to the developers.

Dante&#x27;s final design was left up to Kamiya, who discussed with Bingo Morihashi how the character should be portrayed. Kamiya felt that early depictions of Dante were too quiet and wanted a character who was more &quot;wild&quot; and wore different clothing (such as his sleeveless jacket). Dante appears bare-chested underneath his coat, something that surprised the audience. This design was meant to fit his young personality as well as contrast Vergil&#x27;s fully clothed looked. Additionally, similar to Dante&#x27;s longsword and red clothing, Vergil was also made to wield a Japanese katana and wear blue clothing. Ikeno said he liked the character but had issues with it. Dante&#x27;s Devil Trigger forms were designed by Kazuma Kaneko of Atlus. The Capcom staff was impressed with Kaneko&#x27;s work, and Ikeno felt that it was not difficult to model. A wallpaper with Dante and Vergil&#x27;s Devil Trigger forms was designed as a tribute to the Japanese show &quot;Super Sentai&quot; once defeating the game. Dante was designed to be easy to control, in contrast to Vergil who was more difficult but stronger.

Dante was designed in that game by Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who called the character in his original appearance &quot;the ultimate Hollywood action superstar&quot;. Yoshikawa wanted to make Dante older in his 30s or 40s. His design included a stubble which reflected his &quot;cool&quot; personality since he did not care about shaving. For &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot;, Dante&#x27;s body was more suitable for fighting and his personality was more intense; Yoshikawa emphasised the character&#x27;s sternness and naughtiness. Dante was given a variety of costumes, with one intended to indicate mystery. Several weapons in the series are character-specific. One is Pandora, a firearm designed by Kobayashi who noted that he wanted to include a &quot;transforming, multi-purpose AWD in Dante&#x27;s arsenal. Something that could be used as an over-the-shoulder rocket launcher, or a crossbow, etc. In its final form, I wanted it to transform into something that would be even bigger than Dante himself.&quot; The weapon was inspired by anime series such as &quot;Macross&quot; and &quot;Gundam&quot;. The staff felt that Dante received more missions and weapons than they had originally intended.

Dante and Nero&#x27;s appearances were changed in the E3 2018 trailer for &quot;Devil May Cry 5&quot;, confusing fans who wondered if Nero was Dante. After seeing the older Dante at the trailer&#x27;s end, Capcom noted that fans realised who was who and were pleased with the designs. While designing this incarnation of the character, a total of six outfits were produced until the final one was chosen. As a &quot;weathered devil hunter&quot;, his leather rider&#x27;s jacket had custom stitching tailored to fit his body, so it is easier to get around in. Like his &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot; design, Dante reflects the idea of a man who does not care about others&#x27; opinions of his look. Both his and Nero&#x27;s designs were developed to fit their personalities. According to the company, Dante &quot;hasn&#x27;t gone wild for no reason&quot;.

===Personality===
In &quot;Devil May Cry 2&quot;, his goofy attitude was replaced with a more serious brooding type of personality. The staff felt that Dante&#x27;s stylishness remained true to the original character (despite his change in personality) because of his movements. Daigo Ikeno was responsible for Dante&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Devil May Cry 2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;. In developing the former, he attempted to make Dante more handsome. In retrospect, Ikeno was disappointed with the character&#x27;s inaction in the game. In the prequel game, &quot;Devil May Cry 3: Dante&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, Dante was a younger, more arrogant character than in the previous instalments. The designers of &quot;Devil May Cry 2&quot; returned to design his new look, which was based on the Japanese band Johnnys. This Dante showed more skin under his jacket which the staff believed would fit his younger persona. Trying to remain true to Kamiya&#x27;s original idea, the staff worked carefully to make his actions and personality appealing. Bingo Morihashi said that Dante&#x27;s characterisation was meant as a departure from Kamiya&#x27;s style, and more of a team effort. According to Morihashi, despite seeing the character in three games, he had trouble understanding him. Although Dante is a strong character, he opens up to others. Fan response to this Dante led Morihashi to say that the team was inspired by the &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; Dante but needed to change him. Nevertheless, the character&#x27;s role in facing the world affected the writer. Dante and his identical twin brother Vergil represents one of the themes of &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot;—familial love. While initially Dante only wishes to have fun while fighting demons, he is moved by Lady&#x27;s determination to stop her father. He decides to stop Lady&#x27;s corrupted father as well as Vergil who wishes to open the gate to the demon world.

&quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot; producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi noted before the game&#x27;s release that they aimed to make Dante seem significantly more powerful than its other protagonist, Nero, to create a difference between the strength of a &quot;veteran&quot; compared with a &quot;rookie&quot;; the series&#x27; continuity also dictated that Dante display the power he possessed after the events of the first game and its prequel (&quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot;). The introduction of a new protagonist had been discussed multiple times but was only approved under the condition that Dante also had to be featured in the game. The staff were afraid of negative feedback similar to what had happened to Konami&#x27;s 2001 game &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;, which proved highly controversial because of switching protagonists. As a result, the team tried balancing Dante and Nero&#x27;s strength. Due to the physical similarities between Dante and Nero, the staff aimed to make their designs unique and make their personalities stand out in their interactions with other characters. An example was the &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot; antagonist, Agnus. Nero remained at odds with Agnus in cutscenes, but Dante mocked Agnus in a musical taunt before the boss fight with him which signified how different the two playable characters were in terms of personality.

Itsuno initially found Dante&#x27;s motivations in early games simple: &quot;Beat this bad guy.&quot; With &quot;Devil May Cry 5&quot;, the goal was to imbue curiosity and drive. Matt Walker pointed to Dante&#x27;s desire to see if Urizen was connected to his brother Vergil, giving further depth to his characterisation. The character&#x27;s early defeat at the hands of Urizen coupled with the destruction of his sword Rebellion was meant to emphasise Dante&#x27;s weak powers set by the narrative and how, across it, he would gain new skills to face the antagonist in a rematch. Furthermore, Dante and Nero would respect one and other as they became friends at the end of the previous game. The game&#x27;s climactic event where Nero awakens his demonic powers and stops the struggle between Dante and Vergil was meant to give the story a deeper form. With regard to how Dante would play, Itsuno said he would be more like his &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot; persona. Nevertheless, he said that Dante is more mature from a personality standpoint since he still wishes to protect humanity and honour the legacy of his father, Sparda.

===Fighting style===
Artist Yuichiro Hiraki felt Dante looked like a &quot;nihilistic anti-hero with a bit of a dark side&quot;, based on his early concept art by character designer Makoto Tsuchibayashi. As a result, he wrote him as a character who would rely on his demonic powers, during the game. Shortly after the game&#x27;s development, Kamiya said that his personality would be more animated (which gave Hiraki the idea that Dante would be an &quot;incorrigible joke-cracker&quot;) and the Devil Trigger was downplayed. Hiraki began drawing the character stylishly, working on Dante&#x27;s gameplay, his swordsmanship and his handling of the guns (Ebony and Ivory). Other gameplay elements were based on the fighting-game series &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot; and &quot;Tekken&quot;. Dante&#x27;s use of a shotgun was retained for Capcom&#x27;s horror game, &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;. Hiraki did not find the use fireweapon as stylish but then changed his mind upon watching the film &quot;Mad Max&quot;. The combination between Dante&#x27;s swordsmanship and usage of guns with unlimited ammo made the character feel more unique according to Hiraki before the concept of &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; was conceived. More acrobatic skills were decided by Kamiya in the making of the game including double jumps despite the initial concept of the game as well as flying when Dante used Devil Trigger. This generated difficulties in the designers from the game. To balance the two protagonists, Dante and Nero were given unique gameplay; Dante retained his change of styles from &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot; but could now change between each of them within a battle rather than a stage.

For &quot;Devil May Cry 5&quot;, Dante and Nero&#x27;s characters were developed to play completely different in a similar fashion to &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot; as they employ different mechanics. Itsuno still felt that mastering Dante&#x27;s skills would be more difficult as a result of the multiple modes and weaponry he executes. The weapon Balrog, which acts as a reference to &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character Balrog, was the first weapon conceived by the team. It was made to be one of the most appealing weapons but at the same time the hardest to master. The motorcycle that works as a weapon, Cavaliere, was based on a &quot;Devil May Cry 2&quot; picture somebody drew based on a motorcycle.

===Ninja Theory redesign===

For &quot;DmC: Devil May Cry&quot;, a reboot of the series, Dante was completely redesigned by Italian concept artist Alessandro Taini (known as Talexi), in response to comments by the Capcom staff. Although his original design was meant to resemble those in previous games, Capcom told the Ninja Theory staff that he needed a redesign to appeal to a younger demographic. Motohide Eshiro said that this Dante was completely different from the previous ones, which was expected to generate criticism. Although the original Dante was designed from a Japanese perspective, the new version was made from a Western perspective. After several drafts of Dante&#x27;s new appearance, the designers settled on a look inspired by Christopher Nolan&#x27;s film &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. Dante&#x27;s coat is shorter, only reaching his lower back; his hair is black and shorter, and he has a Devil Trigger form which resembles the original Dante. Art designer Alessandro Taini drew the character as a child and explained in the reboot&#x27;s origin story why he has white hair. Design director Tameem Antoniades denied rumours that Dante was modeled on him.

Dante was made young in this game, inexperienced and consumed by hatred; his fighting style was more like a street brawler than a skilled swordsman. &quot;DmC: Devil May Cry&quot;″s theme is rebellion, and most of Dante&#x27;s actions are based on it. Antoniades said that Dante is about &quot;being cool and making you feel cool when you&#x27;re playing it&quot;, and they felt that his attire from previous games would be found comical. Antoniades added that the original Dante was no longer appealing, and when he compared the new Dante with the title character in &quot;Bayonetta&quot;, her style was not what he wanted for &quot;DmC: Devil May Cry&quot;. Antoniades responded to criticism by saying that Dante would not be changed (since the character suits the game&#x27;s setting), and that he liked the new version.

===Casting===
In the first &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; game, Dante was voiced by Drew Coombs. Coombs was happy to be chosen to voice him, since it was his first job involving a video-game character, and he found the game&#x27;s recording process fun. According to Coombs, he was offered a script for the job and was told that &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; was a &quot;spin-off&quot; of &quot;Resident Evil&quot;. He said that he did not wear anything special while playing the character and had basic storyboards in front of him when his movements were videotaped. Asked if he recognized himself in the character&#x27;s actions, Coombs said that he could not think of anything in particular; his main job was to &quot;bring [Dante] alive&quot; with his voice.

Dante was voiced by Reuben Langdon, who also did motion capture for some scenes in &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot;, &quot;4&quot; and &quot;5&quot;. Langdon auditioned for the character four times before he was chosen. Although he played the first &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; game, he was not aware of the title&#x27;s popularity. Before the release of &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot;, Langdon said that fans were angry with the new teenage Dante&#x27;s look. After its release, however, he said that the fans had come to enjoy the character&#x27;s new incarnation. Langdon enjoyed his work on the game, saying that &quot;it was one of the most difficult, frustrating and yet rewarding character of anyone I&#x27;ve ever played&quot;. As Langdon faced difficulties with the work, he was thankful towards cast director Mary Elizabeth McGlynn as well as Yutaka Maseba from ADR Production who helped him in the making of the game. He felt that he could enjoy the character even more in &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; called Reuben Langdon the character&#x27;s best voice actor, noting that the other two actors did not fit the character well. &quot;Anime News Network&quot; agreed, saying that he made the character far more likable in the anime series, despite flaws in the writing. &quot;IGN&quot; concurred, finding Langdon a better actor than Toshiyuki Morikawa because of his experience with the series.

During the development of &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot;, Langdon found Dante&#x27;s motion capture difficult. He consulted the staff, since they wanted &quot;a different spin&quot; on the character. Eventually, Langdon decided to do his own rendition of Dante because the staff&#x27;s suggestions confused him. He was told to make &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot;″s Dante similar to his &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot; persona, but more mature. Despite the staff&#x27;s concern about the difficulty of such a portrayal, Langdon had no issues after choosing Roy Focker of the anime series &quot;The Super Dimension Fortress Macross&quot; (who was near Dante&#x27;s age) as his character model. Langdon said that his favorite motion capture scene from the series was Dante&#x27;s banter with the antagonist Agnus during &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot; as they did a take on Japanese stage play originally designed by Yuji Shimura.

In the making of &quot;Devil May Cry 5&quot;, Langdon did not like reading the script for the first time. Although he enjoyed the story and characters, Langdon stated that the initial draft dialogue was &quot;horrible&quot; and had to rewrite some parts. Translator Mike NcNamara reworked the original dialogue much to Langdon&#x27;s liking alongside Itsuno&#x27;s. Langdon worked along with Dan Southworth and Johnny Yong Bosch to improve the English translation of the dialogue which they enjoyed. He found Dante as a more over-the-top character than Nero due to Bosch&#x27;s acting and his handling of calm scenes. During one scene, Dante performs a parody to one of Michael Jackson&#x27;s dances which the staff knew Langdon could not perform in motion capture. As a result, this scene was performed by a stunt double known as Shibata.

For the Japanese &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; installments, Dante was given a Japanese voice actor: Toshiyuki Morikawa. Morikawa believes that the character&#x27;s appeal stems from his courage and lack of concern about money. Overseeing his characterisation, Morikawa joked that female viewers would only enjoy seeing him fight; he is less adept at daily life, and constantly interested in eating. However, he said that Dante might have sex appeal which would attract female viewers.

Tim Phillipps did Dante&#x27;s motion capture and voice acting in &quot;DmC: Devil May Cry&quot;. During auditions for the game, he was quickly selected by Antoniades. The actor had no knowledge of the franchise or the reboot until the reveal teaser. He was disappointed that &quot;DmC&quot; was not an online game since those games allow him to interact more and demonstrate his work. Phillipps enjoyed Dante&#x27;s characterisation, he could relate to him, and the motion capture enhanced his interest. Thinking that &quot;DmC&quot; was a prequel rather than a reboot, Phillips did not play the previous games before he worked on Dante&#x27;s character.

== Characteristics ==
Dante is a mercenary and private investigator specialising in paranormal cases, preferring those which require demon-slaying. He is muscular, with silverish white hair and piercing icy blue eyes, and usually wears a red duster or trench coat. Dante&#x27;s arsenal usually consists of firearms and melee weapons, including —twin semi-automatic handguns which never need reloading—and a variety of swords, such as the Rebellion, Force Edge and various &quot;Devil Arms&quot; created from the souls of powerful demons he defeats over the course of each game. The guns are handmade by the gunsmith Nell Goldstein, with &quot;For Tony Redgrave, By .45 Art Warks&quot; written on the slides (Tony Redgrave is Dante&#x27;s alias). He has superhuman strength, agility, stamina, reflexes, coordination, and a resistance to injury approaching invulnerability as a result of his half-demon heritage. This gives him the ability to enter a heightened state known as Devil Trigger. In this state Dante possesses greater strength and speed, his health regenerates at a steady pace, and he has greater abilities (including flight) with his melee weapon.

He is one of the twin sons of Sparda, a demon knight who sided with humanity and drove back an invasion of the human world by demons about 2,000 years before the series&#x27; events. After Sparda&#x27;s death, Dante and Vergil were raised by their human mother Eva. When Dante and Vergil were children, the family was attacked by demons, and Eva was murdered. His mother&#x27;s death led to Dante&#x27;s commitment to hunt the demons who killed her. Dante is confident against opponents, frequently taunting enemies before fighting them. In the games and anime series, Dante is often seen eating pizza. As a result, the limited editions of &quot;Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition&quot; were packaged in a pizza box.

== Appearances ==
=== &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; video games ===
In the original &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; from 2001, Dante is hired by Trish, a mysterious woman who resembles his late mother, to prevent the return of the devil king Mundus. However, Trish is actually arranging for Mundus&#x27; agents to kill Dante as he makes his way to him. One of the agents is the armored soldier Nelo Angelo later revealed to be the mind-controlled Vergil, Dante&#x27;s brother. After multiple encounters, Dante defeats Vergil whose body is destroyed, leaving an amulet necessary to unlock their father&#x27;s legacy, the sword . Trish tries to kill Dante afterwards but Dante spares her when becoming victorious. When Mundus tries to kill Dante, Trish passes Dante her strength to destroy the devil king. Now allied, they become partners in Dante&#x27;s demon-slaying business, now renamed Devil Never Cry.

In the first sequel, &quot;Devil May Cry 2&quot;, from 2003, Dante habitually flips a coin to make decisions; at the end of the game, it is revealed that both sides of the coin are heads. Set some time after the first game, &quot;Devil May Cry 2&quot; focuses on helping Lucia defeat Arius, an international businessman who uses demonic power and wants to conquer the world. At the end of the game, Dante must go into the demon world to stop a demon lord from escaping; the gate closes behind him, and he is trapped. With no way back to the human world, Dante heads deeper into the demon world on his motorcycle.

The third game, &quot;Devil May Cry 3: Dante&#x27;s Awakening&quot;, from 2005 is a prequel of the first game and features a cockier, younger Dante. He is drawn out by Vergil, who is trying to reopen the portal to the demon world to obtain Sparda&#x27;s full power, which remains on the other side in the Force Edge sword. Dante meets Lady, who is in pursuit of her father Arkham who is working with Vergil but has plans of his own. Inspired by Lady&#x27;s courage and commitment to her family, Dante continues his business with a greater sense of purpose. At the end of the game, Dante claims ownership of the Force Edge, and Vergil chooses to remain in the demon world. Dante and Lady befriend, with the former deciding to call his shop Devil May Cry after something Lady had said to comfort him.

In the 2008 video game &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot;, which takes place after &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; and &quot;Devil May Cry 2&quot;, Dante and Trish are informed by Lady that Sanctus, the religious leader of the Order of the Sword founded under Sparda, is using the religious order to engineer his scheme of world conquest. Trish infiltrates the Order as Gloria to confirm it is Sanctus by handing him Vergil&#x27;s Yamato sword. Dante ends up as a boss character against the game&#x27;s protagonist, Nero, when he seemingly assassinated Sanctus. Dante falls back while convincing Nero that the Order is more than it appears. Dante later befriends Nero in another match, having intended to take back Vergil&#x27;s restored sword before deciding to let Nero keep it as they now have a common enemy in Sanctus. After Sanctus kidnaps Nero to use him to power the Savior, Dante becomes playable for the second half of the game as he fights to disable Sanctus completely while saving Nero and his girlfriend Kyrie after they were used to give life to the Savior colossus that Sanctus made into his vessel. Once Sanctus and the Savior are destroyed after Nero and Kyrie escape, Dante entrusts Nero with Vergil&#x27;s sword.

Dante makes a return appearance as one of the main characters in &quot;Devil May Cry 5&quot; in 2019. He is hired by a mysterious man who calls himself V to battle the demon Urizen but is defeated by him in the game&#x27;s opening scene, presume to be dead as he ends up missing after his defeat. It is revealed that he spent the next month in a coma protected by the sword Sparda. V eventually manages to locate him, and he spends the next several hours fighting Urizen&#x27;s forces. Dante uses Rebellion&#x27;s power to absorb the Sparda into himself, acquiring his new demonic powers alongside a new blade simply named . He still discourages Nero from taking part in the battle against Urizen, having learned that Urizen is Vergil, who is also revealed to be Nero&#x27;s father. After Dante defeats Urizen, V merges with him to reconstitute Vergil. Dante reveals that Vergil is Nero&#x27;s father before facing his brother in a climactic duel, but Nero intervenes and forces the two to reconcile. Dante and Vergil embark on a one-way trip to the underworld to cut the Qliphoth&#x27;s root and to seal the portal with the Yamato, leaving the human world in Nero&#x27;s hands. In the final scene, Dante is shown sparring with Vergil in the underworld, no longer as enemies but as friendly rivals while at the same time fending off waves of demons.

Dante is a playable character in the mobile phone game &quot;Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat&quot;. During the game&#x27;s development players criticised Yunchang Games for their rendition of Dante&#x27;s appearances which resulted into the developers&#x27; promising to fix it once the game left the beta period and was released in 2020.

=== &quot;DmC: Devil May Cry&quot; ===
In &quot;&quot; (2013), a &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; reboot, Dante has a very different appearance. In his early twenties, he is attacked in a seemingly sentient town known as Limbo City which is inhabited by demons. Dante meets Vergil, who is the leader of the Order—a rogue vigilante group trying to free the world from demons. The city is controlled by the demon king, Mundus, who killed Dante&#x27;s mother Eva (an angel), and imprisoned his father, Sparda, (a demon and Mundus&#x27; former lieutenant), as well as attempting to kill their children, who are revealed to be Nephilim, half-angel, half-demon offspring, with the power to destroy Mundus. Dante joins Vergil&#x27;s group to oppose Mundus, eventually defeating him and freeing humanity from the demons; however, Vergil&#x27;s intention to take Mundus&#x27; place triggers a fight between the brothers, with Dante being victorious in the end but sparing Vergil&#x27;s life. In the DLC sequel, &quot;Vergil&#x27;s Downfall&quot;, a replica of Dante appears to oppose Vergil in his quest for power and is killed in combat. He also appears in mobile game &quot;Devil May Cry: Peak of Combat&quot;.

=== Other games ===
Dante is also a playable character in several games outside the &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; series. In the &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; series (also created by Hideki Kamiya), he is playable in the PlayStation 2 version of &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; and the PlayStation Portable version of &quot;Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble&quot;. In both games he talks frequently with Alastor, the embodiment of the identically named sword in &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;. Dante appears as an enemy and an optional ally in the director&#x27;s cut version of &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne&quot;, titled &quot;Maniax&quot;. His inclusion was suggested by the Atlus staff, who thought that he would fit the game&#x27;s plot and convinced Capcom to include him. Dante is replaced by Raidou Kuzunoha the XIV in the &quot;Maniax Chronicle&quot; edition and by default in the &quot;HD Remaster&quot;, but is available as paid DLC in the latter version. Morikawa and Langdon reprise their role as Dante in &quot;HD Remaster.&quot;

There is a Dante character card in &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: Card Fighters DS&quot;. Although he was also intended for inclusion in &quot;SNK vs. Capcom: SVC Chaos&quot;, he was removed from the game. Dante made his second fighting-game appearance as a playable character in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom 3: Fate of Two Worlds&quot; / &quot;Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3&quot;, and is playable in &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot; which details his fight against a being named Ultron Sigma. As downloadable content in &quot;Infinite&quot;, Dante&#x27;s look can be altered to show his &quot;DmC&quot; appearance.

Dante was scheduled to appear in &quot;Soulcalibur III&quot;, but did not make it into the final game. Dante is a playable character in the tactical role-playing game &quot;Project X Zone&quot;, with Demitri Maximoff of &quot;Darkstalkers&quot; as his partner. He returns in the sequel, &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot;, with Vergil as his partner. Dante is a playable character in &quot;PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale&quot; as his &quot;DmC: Devil May Cry&quot; incarnation. The use of his &quot;DmC&quot; look (instead of his original persona) was criticised by fans, who were advised by SuperBot Entertainment to enjoy the character&#x27;s gameplay mechanics. Dante also appeared in Capcom&#x27;s mobile fighting game, &quot;Puzzle Fighter&quot;, and the card game Teppen. He is also a guest character in Atlus&#x27; &quot;Shin Megami Tensei: Liberation Dx2&quot; mobile phone game. The character&#x27;s visual appearance has also been featured in &quot;Astro&#x27;s Playroom&quot; and as downloadable content in Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Monster Hunter&quot;, &quot;Sengoku Basara 4&quot; and &quot;Street Fighter V&quot;. A Mii Fighter costume based on Dante was added to &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; via downloadable content on June 29, 2021.

===In other media===
He appears in other media based on the video games, including two light novels by Shinya Goikeda. A young Dante, is chased by assassins, and he searches for a demonic statue, known as the &quot;Beastheads&quot;, in a &quot;Devil May Cry 2&quot; prequel. A &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot; novel by Bingo Morihashi reprises Dante&#x27;s role in the game, revealing his interest in Nero after discovering his resemblance to his brother Vergil. A &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot; manga follows Dante before the game&#x27;s events; a comic of the first game was published by Dreamwave Productions, and an anime, &quot;Devil May Cry: The Animated Series&quot;, follows him as he solves cases involving demons while guarding a young girl named Patty Lowell. &quot;DmC: Devil May Cry&quot;″s version of Dante appears in the game&#x27;s prequel comic, &quot;The Chronicles of Vergil&quot;, when he receives the Rebellion sword to fight demons. The anime inspired two CD dramas whose narrative involves Dante&#x27;s life. In 2019, Tomio Ogata authored a manga that features Dante&#x27;s actions in &quot;Devil May Cry 5&quot; as he meets V.

In the play &quot;Sengoku Basara vs. Devil May Cry&quot; he was played by Hiroki Suzuki. In the musical &quot;Devil May Cry: The Live Hacker&quot;, he was portrayed by Ryōma Baba. The popularity of the &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; series led to a line of action figures, produced by Toycom; Kaiyodo produced a similar line for &quot;Devil May Cry 2&quot; and a &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot; Dante action figure.

In the upcoming 2025 animated series, Dante will be voiced by Johnny Yong Bosch, who also voiced Nero in the fourth and fifth entries of the video game franchise.

== Reception ==
Video game publications, including the 2011 version of the &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot;, described him as one of the best and greatest video game character. &quot;Game Informer&quot; called him &quot;one of the most bad-ass characters around&quot; when he was introduced, citing the contrast between his character and those previously seen in the &quot;Resident Evil&quot; series. In promoting &quot;Devil May Cry 5&quot;, Capcom produced replicas of the character&#x27;s jacket as limited editions for Japanese gamers. In another promotion, Sony used Dante&#x27;s image alongside Morikawa&#x27;s voice to promote pizza. In Japan, there were limited releases of the game that included a jacket based on Dante&#x27;s. &quot;PSU&quot; noted even though Dante&#x27;s appearance had had multiple designs in different games his appealing personality has remained. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; said that despite Dante&#x27;s multiple characterizations, &quot;he&#x27;s a guy who you&#x27;ll always have a hell of a time playing with.&quot;

Alejandro Rodríguez from National Autonomous University of Mexico noted that Dante&#x27;s journey in &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot; makes a large homage to Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. Just like Alighieri, Dante goes to confront his brother Vergil who is releasing demon to the human world in the form of a tower that represents Hell. Across his journey, Dante meets demons like Cerberus or Leviatan who are famous in myths. Several of these creatures that Dante faces are direct references to the Seven Deadly Sins though the lore present in Dante&#x27;s story is its own when compared to the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; in order to face his Vergil. In another analysis, since the brothers are half demon and half human, Marcel Poorthius and Frank G. Bosman from University of Heidelberg noted to bring in religious overtones, although it was initially subtle. Ninja Theory made a more direct reference to the way religion is portrayed in gaming while showing the parallels between the identical twins.
&quot;Meristation&quot; regarded Dante&#x27;s design and characterisation provided by Kamiya as one of the biggest reasons for the iconic character&#x27;s popularity in hack and slash games. &quot;IGN&quot; described the character as &quot;a dark antihero kind of guy even a down-in-the-dumps, disgruntled teenager would love.&quot; SNK artist Falcoon called him an anti-hero, comparing him with K&#x27; (a character in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series), whereas &quot;GameSpy&quot; described Dante as &quot;awe-inspiring to look at&quot;, with attire reminiscent of Vincent Price.
Dante has also been noted to have sex appeal that attracts gamers of the series. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; found him as one of the sexiest new characters of the decade; compared with &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; female characters, he was the &quot;hottest&quot; of all because of his muscular build, his hair, his fighting abilities and his attitude. &quot;La Nueva España&quot; included the &quot; that exudes testosterone from every pore&quot; in their top ten sexiest video-game characters of both genders. &quot;Logo TV&quot; ranked Dante as the seventeenth on their list of the sexiest male video game characters. The articles involving his sex appeal led to a comparison with &quot;Bayonetta&quot; title character, especially in his &quot;Devil May Cry 4&quot; persona, based on their personalities and actions. Hideki Kamiya of &quot;PlatinumGames&quot; has said that he was approached about having the Sega character Bayonetta included in &quot;Project X Zone 2&quot;; he refused, wanting Bayonetta and Dante to meet &quot;on his own terms&quot;. Kamiya came to regret his decision, realising that fans would have enjoyed the interaction between the characters; if there is a &quot;Project X Zone 3&quot;, he would strongly support Bayonetta&#x27;s inclusion.

&quot;GamesRadar+&quot; also enjoyed his rivalry with Vergil. Dante&#x27;s dynamic with Nero in the following game garnered positive responses as critics found none of them overshadowed the other even if Dante&#x27;s fans had to wait for the game&#x27;s second half to control him while enjoying the older characterisation. &quot;Destructoid&quot; enjoyed the impact Vergil has on both Dante and Nero in the latest game. In the story both his brother and son become far more serious as they take it upon themselves to stop their relative&#x27;s threat. Despite liking Dante&#x27;s relationship with Nero to the point of comparing to them as father and son, &quot;USGamer&quot; found Dante&#x27;s treatment of the younger demon hunter mean-spirited even though the character later reveals he does not want Nero to face Vergil because of their connection. Comparing Dante and Vergil&#x27;s characterizations in the reboot, &quot;Destructoid&quot; found Vergil a more entertaining character in spite of gameplay issues.

Because of the character&#x27;s popularity and Capcom publishing ports for the series on the Nintendo Switch in 2019 and 2020, multiple gamers speculated about the possible inclusion of him as downloadable content in Nintendo&#x27;s fighting game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;. &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; director Hideaki Itsuno talked about the possibility of Dante becoming a guest character. But he noted that it might not be possible since at the time he was interviewed about it, &quot;Devil May Cry&quot; had not been released for Nintendo consoles. However, he also noted that Cloud Strife from &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; made it to the game even though the game had not been released for Nintendo&#x27;s consoles; he hoped Dante would be added to the cast. Dante was added as a Mii Fighter costume to the game on June 29, 2021, later resulting to &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;&#x27;s fans outcry on twitter, following over the disappointing character reveal.

Early impressions of Dante&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Devil May Cry 5&quot; trailer were also positive. &quot;GameSpot&quot; noted how fans enjoyed his role as well as design, while &quot;VG247&quot; found him more of a &quot;charmer&quot; than in his previous incarnations due to his interactions with other characters. He was also included on &quot;HobbyConsolas&quot;″ &quot;The 30 best heroes of the last 30 years.&quot; &quot;The Guardian&quot; highly enjoyed Dante&#x27;s cocky personality despite him being far older than in previous games. &quot;Metro&quot; agreed, finding his dynamic with the younger protagonist, Nero, made enjoyable cutscenes whenever they are featured. &quot;PC Gamer&quot; enjoyed Dante&#x27;s hat as it provides entertainment in both cutscenes and gameplay.

Among other relationships, Dante was positive for his team ups with Trish and Lady, to the point his role in &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot; was felt be superior to Kamiya&#x27;s original take. In particular, Dante&#x27;s team up with Trish was praised by Inquirer for coming across as apparent romantic once they make peace to defeat Mundus. &quot;DVD Talk&quot; liked the interactions between Dante, Lady and Trish; the reviewer expected more of them in the anime, rather than stories focused on Dante facing enemies. He found Dante appealing in the anime series, based on his personality and actions. According to a &quot;FandomPost&quot; reviewer, Dante&#x27;s role in the anime differed from the games in his childish behaviour over food and money; however, he was still &quot;a great character&quot;. &quot;Otaku USA&quot; said that in the anime Dante remained faithful to his game version in his actions, most notably the gory (but limited) fighting.

The character&#x27;s use of combos in the crossover &quot;Marvel vs Capcom 3&quot; was praised by &quot;Eurogamer&quot;, although the website wondered if he was overpowered. Both &quot;Kotaku&quot; and &quot;Eurogamer&quot; criticised the &quot;weird&quot; appearance of Dante&#x27;s face in the fighting game &quot;Marvel vs. Capcom: Infinite&quot;. Dante&#x27;s inclusion in &quot;Nocturne&quot; and &quot;Project X Zone&quot; was met with a good response. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; listed him as one of the best unlockable characters in gaming while commenting about his inclusion in &quot;Viewtiful Joe&quot; as being nothing more than a new skin for the title character.

Dante&#x27;s characterisation has also been criticised. His cocky attitude was largely absent from &quot;Devil May Cry 2&quot;, a major criticism of the game. According to &quot;UK Anime Network&quot;, his personality in the &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot; prequel manga lacked development; he appeared unlikable, and the script gave him strange lines. Fan reaction to the character&#x27;s design in the &quot;DmC: Devil May Cry&quot; reboot was mainly negative. Hideki Kamiya said that it was based on modern, rebellious youth; although he missed the original Dante, he hoped that people would get used to the new version. Dave Riley of Anime News Network compared the reboot&#x27;s character with the young Dante from &quot;Devil May Cry 3&quot;, criticising him as a &quot;pretty generic adolescent power fantasy&quot; (including swearing when he confronts enemies). Reuben Langdon was disappointed with Dante&#x27;s characterisation in the reboot after having looked forward to it. Writers on several websites criticised the fan base&#x27;s negative reaction, saying that they were influenced solely by the character&#x27;s look; his personality was very close to the original Dante. Hideaki Itsuno himself was bothered by Dante&#x27;s change in the reboot along with the major changes in the game to the point he thought about quitting Capcom. According to Langdon, Itsuno decided to stay at Capcom when he expressed desire to have control over the franchise.

&quot;1UP.com&quot; praised Ninja Theory for removing some of Dante&#x27;s old, unappealing characteristics and making him an approachable protagonist for players. According to &quot;IGN&quot;, the redesigned hero is more relatable for players. However, a &quot;VideoGamer.com&quot; reviewer said that the new Dante lacked some of the original&#x27;s iconic features. &quot;Metro&quot; was harsher to Dante&#x27;s characterisation in &quot;DmC&quot;, finding him sexist because his treatment of women, mostly in the introduction scenes to the point of calling him a pervert.

<doc id="923212" wikidata="Q2896889" url="?curid=923212" title="Kosher wine">
<text>Kosher wine () is wine that is produced in accordance with &quot;halakha&quot;, and more specifically &quot;kashrut&quot;, such that Jews will be permitted to pronounce blessings over and drink it. This is an important issue, since wine is used in several Jewish ceremonies, especially those of Kiddush.

To be considered kosher, Sabbath-observant Jews must supervise the entire winemaking process and handle much of it in person, from the time the grapes are loaded into the crusher until the finished wine product is bottled and sealed. Additionally, any ingredients used, including finings, must be kosher. Wine that is described as &quot;kosher for Passover&quot; must have been kept free from contact with leavened or fermented grain products, a category that includes many industrial additives and agents.

When kosher wine is produced, marketed, and sold commercially, it would normally have a &quot;hechsher&quot; (kosher certification mark) issued by a kosher certification agency, or by an authoritative rabbi who is respected and known to be learned in Jewish law, or by the Kashruth Committee working under a &quot;beth din&quot; (rabbinical court of Judaism).

In recent times, there has been an increased demand for kosher wines, and a number of wine-producing countries now produce a wide variety of sophisticated kosher wines under strict rabbinical supervision, particularly in Israel, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, South Africa, Chile, and Australia. Two of the world&#x27;s largest producers and importers of kosher wines—Kedem and Manischewitz—are both based in the American Northeast.

==History==
The use of wine has a long history in Judaism, dating back to biblical times. Archeological evidence shows that wine was produced throughout ancient Israel. The traditional and religious use of wine continued within the Jewish diaspora community. In the United States, kosher wines came to be associated with sweet Concord wines produced by wineries founded by Jewish immigrants to New York.

Beginning in the 1980s, a trend towards producing dry, premium-quality kosher wines began with the revival of the Israeli wine industry. Today kosher wine is produced not only in Israel but throughout the world, including premium wine areas like Napa Valley and the Saint-Émilion region of Bordeaux.

==Role of wine in Jewish holidays and rituals==
Almost all Jewish holidays, especially the Passover Seder where all present drink four cups of wine, on Purim for the festive meal, and on the Shabbat require obligatory blessings (Kiddush) over filled cups of kosher wine that are then drunk. Grape juice is also suitable on these occasions. If no wine or grape juice is present on Shabbat, the blessing over challah suffices for kiddush on Friday night; for Kiddush on Shabbat morning as well as Havdalah, if there is no wine one would use &quot;Chamar ha-medinah&quot;, literally the &quot;drink of the country&quot;.

At Jewish marriages, circumcisions, and at redemptions of first-born ceremonies, the obligatory blessing of &quot;Borei Pri HaGafen&quot; (&quot;Blessed are you O Lord, Who created the fruit of the vine&quot;) is almost always recited over kosher wine (or grape juice).

According to the teachings of the Midrash, the forbidden fruit that Eve ate and which she gave to Adam was the grape from which wine is derived, though others contest this and say that it was in fact a fig. The capacity of wine to cause drunkenness with its consequent loosening of inhibitions is described by the ancient rabbis in Hebrew as &quot;nichnas yayin, yatza sod&quot; (&quot;wine enters, [and one&#x27;s personal] secret[s] exit&quot;), similar to the Latin &quot;in vino veritas&quot;. Another similarly evocative expression relating to wine is: &quot;Ein Simcha Ela BeBasar Veyayin&quot;—&quot;There is no joy except through meat and wine&quot;.)

==Requirements for being kosher==
Because of wine&#x27;s special role in many non-Jewish religions, the &quot;kashrut&quot; laws specify that wine cannot be considered kosher if it might have been used for idolatry. These laws include prohibitions on &quot;Yayin Nesekh&quot; ( – &quot;poured wine&quot;), wine that has been poured to an idol, and &quot;Stam Yeynam&quot; (), wine that has been touched by someone who believes in idolatry or produced by non-Jews. When kosher wine is &quot;yayin mevushal&quot; ( – &quot;cooked&quot; or &quot;boiled&quot;), it becomes unfit for idolatrous use and will keep the status of &quot;kosher&quot; wine even if subsequently touched by an idolater.

While none of the ingredients that make up wine (alcohol, sugars, acidity and phenols) is considered non-kosher, the &quot;kashrut&quot; laws involving wine are concerned more with who handles the wine and what they use to make it. For wine to be considered kosher, only Sabbath-observant Jews may handle it, from the first time in the process when a liquid portion is separated from solid waste, until the wine is pasteurized or bottles are sealed. Wine that is described as &quot;kosher for Passover&quot; must have been kept free from contact with chametz and kitnios. This would include grain, bread, and dough as well as legumes and corn derivatives.

===Mevushal wines===
When kosher wine is mevushal (Hebrew: &quot;cooked&quot; or &quot;boiled&quot;), it thereby becomes unfit for idolatrous use and will keep the status of kosher wine even if subsequently touched by an idolater. It is not known whence the ancient Jewish authorities derived this claim; there are no records concerning &quot;boiled wine&quot; and its fitness for use in the cults of any of the religions of the peoples surrounding ancient Israel. Indeed, in Orthodox Christianity, it is common to add boiling water to the sacramental wine. Another opinion holds that mevushal wine was not included in the rabbinic edict against drinking wine touched by an idolater simply because such wine was uncommon in those times.

Mevushal wine is frequently used in kosher restaurants and by kosher caterers so as to allow the wine to be handled by non-Jewish or non-observant waiters.

The process of fully boiling a wine kills off most of the fine mold on the grapes, and greatly alters the tannins and flavors of the wine. Therefore, great care is taken to satisfy the legal requirements while exposing the wine to as little heat as necessary. There is significant disagreement between halachic deciders as to the precise temperature a wine must reach to be considered mevushal, ranging from . (At this temperature, the wine is not at a rolling boil, but it is cooking, in the sense that it will evaporate much more quickly than usual.) Cooking at the minimum required temperature reduces some of the damage done to the wine, but still has a substantial effect on quality and aging potential.

A process called flash pasteurization rapidly heats the wine to the desired temperature and immediately chills it back to room temperature. This process is said to have a minimal effect on flavor, at least to the casual wine drinker.

Irrespective of the method, the pasteurization process must be overseen by &quot;mashgichim&quot; to ensure the kosher status of the wine. Generally, they will attend the winery to physically tip the fruit into the crush, and operate the pasteurization equipment. Once the wine emerges from the process, it can be handled and aged in the normal fashion.

===According to Conservative Judaism===
In the 1960s, the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards approved a &quot;responsum&quot; (&quot;legal ruling&quot;) by Rabbi Israel Silverman on this subject. Silverman noted that some classical Jewish authorities believed that Christians are not considered idolaters, and that their products cannot be considered forbidden in this regard. He also noted that most winemaking in the United States is fully automated. Based on 15th–19th century precedents in the &quot;responsa&quot; literature, he concluded that wines manufactured by this automated process may not be classified as wine &quot;manufactured by gentiles&quot;, and thus are not prohibited by Jewish law. This &quot;responsum&quot; makes no attempt to change &quot;halakhah&quot; in any way, but rather argues that most American wine, made in an automated fashion, is already kosher by traditional halakhic standards. Some criticism was later made against this &quot;teshuvah&quot;, because (a) some wines are not made by automated processes but rather, at least in some steps, by hand, and (b) on rare occasions non-kosher fining ingredients are used in wine preparation. Silverman later retracted his position.

A later &quot;responsum&quot; on this subject was written by Rabbi Elliot N. Dorff and also accepted by the CJLS. Dorff noted that not all wines are made by automated processes, and thus the reasoning behind Silverman&#x27;s responsum was not conclusively reliable in all cases. On the other hand, Dorff points out that even if we can avoid the issue of &quot;wine handled by a gentile&quot;, there is a separate prohibition against wine produced from wineries owned by a gentile, in which case automation is irrelevant, and all non-certified wines are prohibited. Therefore, he explored the possibility to change the halacha, arguing that the prohibition no longer applies. He cites rabbinic thought on Jewish views of Christians, also finding that most &quot;poskim&quot; refused to consign Christians to the status of idolater. Dorff then critiqued the traditional halakhic argument that avoiding such wine would prevent intermarriage. Dorff asserted, however, that those who were strict about the laws of &quot;kashrut&quot; were not likely to intermarry, and those that did not follow the laws would not care if a wine has a &quot;heksher&quot; or not. He also noted that a number of non-kosher ingredients may be used in the manufacturing process, including animal blood.

Dorff concluded a number of points including that there is no reason to believe that the production of such wines is conducted as part of pagan (or indeed, &quot;any&quot;) religious practice. Most wines have no non-kosher ingredients whatsoever. Some wines use a non-kosher ingredient as part of a fining process, but not as an ingredient in the wine as such. Dorff noted that material from this matter is not intended to infiltrate the wine product. The inclusion of any non-kosher ingredient within the wine occurs by accident, and in such minute quantities that the ingredient is nullified. All wines made in the US and Canada may be considered kosher, regardless of whether or not their production is subject to rabbinical supervision. Many foods once considered forbidden if produced by non-Jews (such as wheat and oil products) were eventually declared kosher. Based on the above points, Dorff&#x27;s responsum extends this same ruling to wine and other grape-products.

However, this teshuvah also notes that this is a lenient view. Some Conservative rabbis disagree with it, e.g. Isaac Klein. As such Dorff&#x27;s teshuvah states that synagogues should hold themselves to a stricter standard so that all in the Jewish community will view the synagogue&#x27;s kitchen as fully kosher. As such, Conservative synagogues are encouraged to use only wines with a hekhsher, and preferably wines from Israel.

==Regional kosher wine consumption==
===United States===
Historically, kosher wine has been associated in the US with the Manischewitz brand, which produce a sweetened wine with a distinctive taste, made of &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; rather than &quot;V. vinifera&quot; grapes. Due to the addition of high-fructose corn syrup, the normal bottlings of Manischewitz are, for Ashkenazi Jews, not kosher during Passover by the rule of &quot;kitniyot&quot;, and a special bottling is made available. This cultural preference for a distinct, unique variety of wine dates back to Jewish settlements in early US history.

<text>George John Scipio Africanus (c. 1763 – 19 May 1834) was a West African former slave who became a successful entrepreneur in Nottingham, England.

==Early years==

The early life of George Africanus is obscure. Calculating his birth year from his burial certificate, he was probably born in 1763. His obituary in the &quot;Nottingham Journal&quot; of 30 May 1834 states that he was born in a village in Sierra Leone, which became a British colony in 1787.

It is believed that George arrived in England in early 1766. On 31 March 1766, he was baptised George John Scipio Africanus, and described as a boy belonging to Benjamin Molineux of Molineux House, in the Collegiate church of St Peter in Wolverhampton.

When George was three years old Molineux began educating him. After Benjamin Molineux&#x27;s death in 1772, his eldest son, George Molineux, inherited the estate and took responsibility for raising and educating the child. Growing up, Africanus probably worked as a servant in the Molineux family household, before becoming apprenticed to be a brass founder.

As an adult, Africanus moved to Nottingham, a place familiar to his adopted family. Benjamin Molineux&#x27;s grandfather, Darcy Molineux (1652–1716), served as High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire in 1687, and Deputy Lieutenant of Nottinghamshire between 1698 and 1702. Darcy Molineux raised George Molineux&#x27;s father John (1685–1754) in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, before settling in Wolverhampton around 1700. The family Molineux came from Teversal near Mansfield in the county of Nottinghamshire.
Africanus may have become interested in Nottingham after visiting on the way home from the funeral. A relative in his adopted family, Sir William Molineux, 6th Baronet of Teversall, died near Mansfield in 1781. Members of the Wolverhampton Molineux family, including Africanus, may have passed through Nottingham town centre, a town of 18,000 people then, full of beautiful open-air gardens and pleasing surroundings.

==Starting a business==

Africanus moved to St Peter&#x27;s Parish, Nottingham, at the age of 21 around 1784. He met a local girl, Esther (sometimes spelled Ester) Shaw, and they were married on 3 August 1788 at St. Peter&#x27;s Church, Nottingham. Around 1793, they started up an employment agency, Africanus&#x27; Register of Servants, operating from their home at 28 Chandlers Lane. If the business was not bringing in sufficient income, Africanus may have performed other jobs for support; while their 1788 marriage bond document states that he was a Brass Founder by trade, trade directories of the time list him as a waiter and labourer as well. Following his death in 1834, his wife Esther remained in the house and continued to run the family business.

After she died on 12 May 1853, a notice appeared in the &quot;Nottingham Review&quot;, stating: &quot;Yesterday (Thursday), aged 85 years, Mrs. Africanus, for upwards of sixty years proprietor of the Servants&#x27; Register Office in Chandlers Lane.&quot; If this account is correct, then Ester ran the Servants&#x27; Register Office on Chandler&#x27;s lane from at least 1793. Africanus bought 28 Chandlers Lane and adjoining properties in Bluchers Yard for £380 on 24 October 1829.

==Family life==

Africanus and his wife had seven children, but only one lived to adulthood. While no descendants carry the Africanus family surname, his bloodline continued for some time. Daughter Hannah married Samuel Cropper (1802–1886/7), a watch and clock maker, at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Nottingham, in 1825. They had three children: Sarah Ann Cropper (1825–1842), George Africanus Cropper (1838–1839) and Esther Africanus Cropper (1840–1911).

Granddaughter Esther married Charles Edward Turnbull at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Nottingham, on 28 September 1865. They lived at 9 St. Paul&#x27;s Crescent, St. Pancras, London. Esther died at the age of 69 in Kingston, Surrey. The 1881 census indicates that she had three children: Arthur (aged 14), Fredrick (13), and Margaret Hannah (9).

According to the Last Will and Testament of George Africanus, he was unhappy with Hannah&#x27;s marriage to Samuel Cropper. Hannah and Samuel Cropper lived apart for years until after the death of George Africanus. The 1841 census shows Hannah and Samuel Cropper living on Chandlers Lane with her 70-year-old mother, Esther, who was still working as proprietress of the register of servants office at the time.

Africanus&#x27;s will also indicates that his granddaughter, Sarah Ann Cropper, was &quot;afflicted&quot; in some unstated way; she died at the age of 17, so may have had a serious illness.

==Burial place and legacy==
Len Garrison, director of Afro-Caribbean Family and Friends (AcFF), ensured that Africanus was included in Nottingham Castle&#x27;s 1993 Black Presence exhibition. It was only in 2003 that, after painstaking research, Africanus&#x27;s grave was uncovered, despite its worn inscription, in the churchyard of St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Nottingham. His wife was buried alongside him. Their children are buried in a separate grave nearby.

A gravestone bearing an epitaph now reads:

&quot;In Memory of George Africanus&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Who died 19 May 1834&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Aged 70 years&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Also Ester Africanus, wife of the above&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Who died 12 May 1853?&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Aged 81 years&quot;

&quot;Oh cruel death that separated here&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;A loving father from his daughter dear&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Also a tender parent in decline of life&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;A loving mother and a careful wife&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;While in this world they did remain&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Their latter Days were full of pain&quot;
A memorial green plaque in memory of Africanus, &quot;Nottingham&#x27;s first black entrepreneur&quot;, was unveiled on St. Mary&#x27;s churchyard railings in April 2003, and in October 2014 his place of business and residence, formerly 28 Chandlers Lane, was recognised with a blue heritage plaque erected by the Nubian Jak Community Trust.

On 25 March 2007, as part of the events taking place to commemorate the 200th Anniversary of Abolition of Slave Trade Act, an hour-long service was held at St. Mary&#x27;s Church, High Pavement, Nottingham, at the end of which a new memorial stone was dedicated by religious leaders. The Bishop of Kingston (Jamaica), the Rt Revd Robert Thompson, preached at the service. In the same month, an exhibition was held at Nottingham Council House celebrating the life of Africanus, displaying documents and illustrations connected with his life in Wolverhampton and Nottingham.

Nottingham Express Transit tram number 234 bears his name.

<doc id="923215" wikidata="Q5089400" url="?curid=923215" title="Cheese fries">
<text>Cheese fries or cheesy chips (latter British English) is a dish consisting of French fries covered in cheese, with the possible addition of various other toppings. Cheese fries are generally served as a lunch or dinner dish. They can be found in fast-food locations, diners, and grills mainly in English speaking countries.

== Origins ==
The origin of the dish is not known. Cheese fries have been said to have grown in popularity in the United States after canned cheese products such as Cheez Whiz were introduced in 1952. Don A. Jenkins is said to have invented the chili cheese fry variation at the age of 16, in Tomball, Texas. Another report claims that a young fry cook named Austin Ruse was the first to serve this dish while working at Dairy Queen in St. Charles, Missouri. 

==Variations==
===United States===
Throughout the Southwest US, loaded fries are often covered in melted cheddar cheese, bacon bits, jalapeño slices, and chives, and served with ranch dressing. Alternately, they are also served as carne asada fries.

In Philadelphia, pizza fries are topped with melted mozzarella and served with pizza sauce on the side, while &quot;mega fries&quot; are topped with cheddar (or sometimes Cheez Whiz) and mozzarella cheese and bacon, usually served with a side of ranch dressing.

In New York City, Long Island, and New Jersey, they are covered with melted American, mozzarella, or Swiss cheese. Disco fries have the addition of brown gravy.

In other parts of the US, nacho cheese is often used, especially at snack stands.

Chili cheese fries are topped with chili con carne. The cheese is usually either American or cheddar. In Cincinnati, Ohio, they use their own Cincinnati chili for their chili cheese fries at the local chili restaurants. In New Mexico, they use New Mexico chile for their chili cheese fries, often adding chopped lettuce, tomato, and olives as garnish.

Gourmet Fries are Charleys Philly Steaks rendition of cheese fries. The cheese is similar to cheddar nacho cheese and can include bacon bits or ranch.

In Puerto Rico, they have gained some popularity on fast food trucks known as crazy fries (papas locas). Potatoes, yams, batata (a white sweet potato with purple skin), cassava fries or Mofongo are coated with bacon, cheese with roasted pork, chicken, beef or all three, drizzled with ketchup and mayonnaise. Corn, chopped lettuce, cilantro, avocado, tomatoes, and bell peppers, are often added as a garnish.

===Internationally===
In Ireland, a variation called &quot;taco fries&quot; consists of fresh-cut fries covered in ground beef, tomato, peppers, onions, and various seasonings. This is covered in taco sauce and shredded cheddar. Another staple of Irish fast food restaurants, both stand-alone chippers or chains such as Supermac&#x27;s, is &quot;Garlic Cheese Chips&quot;, which consists of chips covered in garlic sauce and cheese, usually cheddar.

In Bulgaria, a common side dish offered in most restaurants consists of French fries, topped with grated or crumbled &quot;sirene&quot;.

In the Netherlands, a dish named &#x27;kapsalon&#x27; is served as fast food. This consists of fries covered with cheese, salad, and shawarma or doner kebab. It is often consumed with large amounts of garlic sauce or chili sauce.

In the United Kingdom, cheesy chips are often served in pubs. Preparation includes the pouring of cheddar sauce over chips or sprinkling cheddar over chips and then putting the dish under a grill. A popular version in pubs is loaded fries which are made with french fries served with nacho sauce, crispy onions , sour cream and bacon bits. A variation adds beef gravy or curry sauce. In some cases mozzarella cheese is used rather than cheddar, particularly in takeaway restaurants which sell pizza.

<doc id="923216" wikidata="Q432681" url="?curid=923216" title="Sciacca">
<text>Sciacca (Italian and Sicilian: [ˈʃakka]; Greek: ; Latin: Thermae Selinuntinae, Thermae Selinuntiae, Thermae, Aquae Labrodes and Aquae Labodes) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Agrigento on the southwestern coast of Sicily, southern Italy. It has views of the Mediterranean Sea.

==History==

Thermae was founded in the 5th century BC by the Greeks, as its name suggests, as a thermal spa for Selinunte, 30 km distant, whose citizens came there to bathe in the sulphurous springs, still much valued for their medical properties, of Mount San Calogero which rises up behind the town. There is no account of the existence of a town on the site during the period of the independence of Selinunte, though the thermal waters would always have attracted some population to the spot. It seems to have been much frequented in the time of the Romans. At a later period they were called the Aquae Labodes or Larodes, under which name they appear in the Itineraries. Pliny was most likely mistaken in assigning the rank of a &quot;colonia&quot; to the southern, rather than northern, town of the same name. Strabo mentions the waters (.)

The origin of the town&#x27;s name has been much debated, with Latin &quot;ex acqua&quot;, as a reference to the springs of thermal water of the area, or Arabic &quot;Syac&quot;, meaning bath, and al Saqquah, dating back to the cult of the Syrian god &quot;Shai al Quaaum&quot;, as possibilities.

The city walls, the bastions and the Old Castle owe their existence to Roger the Great Count.

A royal city that had remained faithful to Manfred of Sicily during the Angevine invasion, by 1268 A.D. Sciacca was besieged by Charles I of Anjou and surrendered the following year. After the Sicilian Vespers, it established itself as a free commune. During the War of the Sicilian Vespers, the city was besieged numerous times; the final engagement of the 20-year war took place in 1302, when a French army failed to capture the city.

Following the Vespers era, the Peralta family took possession of it and obtained from the king of Sicily the right to mint coins. In the following centuries, the town was at the center of bloody feuds between rival baronial families (the Luna, of Aragonese origin, and the Perollo, of Norman stock), which nearly halved its population. In 1647, the impoverished town was the seat of an anti-Spanish rebellion.

During World War II, the Italian &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; (Royal Italian Air Force) had a base near Sciacca.

==Geography==
===Overview===
The municipality borders Caltabellotta, Menfi, Ribera and Sambuca di Sicilia.

===Climate===
Sciacca has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;Csa&quot;), with short, mild and moderately rainy winters and long, hot and dry summers. The city receives around 450 millimeters (17.7 inches) of rain per year, experiencing a peak of 72.3 millimeters (2.8 inches) in November and a minimum of 2.5 millimeters (0.1 inch) in July. 

==Main sites==

Sciacca still retains much of its medieval layout, which divided the town into quarters, each laid out on a strip of rock descending toward the sea. Sciacca has several points of interest, including:
*Cathedral of &quot;Maria SS. del Soccorso&quot; (12th century, rebuilt in 1685)
*Castle of the Counts Luna; scarce remains can be still seen
*Church of &quot;Santa Margherita&quot;
*&quot;Chiesa del Carmine&quot;
*Church of &quot;San Michele&quot; (1371, rebuilt in the 17th century)
*Church of &quot;Santa Maria delle Giummare&quot;
*&quot;Palazzo Steripinto&quot;
*&quot;Palazzo Tagliavia&quot; (11th century), in neogothic style
*&quot;Palazzo Perollo&quot; (15th century)

==Culture==
Sciacca&#x27;s festivals include the Carnival, celebrated during the week before the beginning of Lent (February). The highlight of the festival is the parade of bizarre figures mounted on floats, famous throughout Sicily for their gaudy expressions. The local television stations are TRS Tele Radio Sciacca and RMK Tele Radio Monte Kronio.

==Diaspora==
Starting around the turn of the 20th century, a number of residents of the Sciacca area emigrated to Norristown, Pennsylvania and the North End of Boston.

The Boston-based descendants of Sciacca, especially those from fishing families, have celebrated the Festival of the Madonna del Soccorso since 1910.

The Norristown-based descendants of Sciacca, through the local M.S.S. Club, maintain both traditions and devotions to the Madonna del Soccorso. The M.S.S. holds a communion breakfast in February and a large festival (often called simply &quot;The Feast&quot;) in August in celebration of the miracles performed by the Madonna herself in Sciacca.

==Economy==
The economy of Sciacca is mainly based on agriculture, fishing and related food industries, as well as tourism.

<doc id="923219" wikidata="Q6732177" url="?curid=923219" title="Magnus Pyke">
<text>Magnus Alfred Pyke (29 December 1908 – 19 October 1992) was an English nutritional scientist, governmental scientific adviser, writer and presenter. He worked for the UK Ministry of Food, the post-war Allied Commission for Austria, and different food manufacturers. He wrote prolifically and became famous as a TV and radio personality, and was featured on Thomas Dolby&#x27;s 1982 synth-pop hit, &quot;She Blinded Me with Science&quot;.

== Early life and scientific career ==
Pyke was born at Gloucester Terrace, Paddington, London, the son of Clara Hannah Lewis and Robert Bond Pyke, manager of a wholesale confectionery business. He went to St. Paul&#x27;s School, Barnes, London, where he found he had a &quot;certain bounciness combined with a lack of self-consciousness.&quot;

He worked briefly for an insurance company before moving to Canada to attend Macdonald College, McGill University, Montreal, studying agriculture, gaining a BSc in 1933. During summers there, he worked as a farm labourer. He remained in Canada for seven years.

He returned to the UK and in 1934 became chief chemist at Vitamins Ltd., Hammersmith, London. He worked with Professor J.C.Drummond of University College, London on vitamin research. He gained a Ph.D. in biochemistry in 1936.

On 23 August 1937 he married Dorothea Mina Vaughan (1907–86), an accountant. They had a daughter and a son.

== Wartime scientific career ==
In 1941 Pyke joined Professor Drummond at the Ministry of Food where Drummond was scientific adviser. They studied the nutritional effects of food restrictions due to wartime shortages. He lectured on practical nutrition for those working in institutions that provided food: these lectures were published by H.M. Stationery Office under the title &quot;The Manual of Nutrition&quot; (1945) [the revised 12th edition is still in print, published by the Food Standards Agency]. He supported the idea of using rose hip syrup to replace imported orange juice. He was a scientific adviser to the Allied Commission for Austria in 1945–6, after which he worked as Principal Scientific officer at the Ministry of Food (1946–48), continuing to work on institutional diets and nutritional education.

== Later scientific career ==
He joined The Distillers Company in 1949 as the deputy manager of the yeast research division at Glenochil Research Station, Clackmannanshire. In 1955 he became manager, retiring in 1973.

== Promotion of science ==
Pyke became chairman of the Nutrition Society (Scotland) (1954–55), a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (1956), council member of the Institute of Biology (1959–62), council member of the Society of Chemical Industry (1967–69) and president of the Institute of Food Science &amp; Technology (1969–77).

He became a council member of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1968, then secretary, and finally chairman in 1973, a position he held until 1977.
He claimed that food manufacturers provided a social service and defended them against accusations of providing unhealthy products.

== Publications ==
Pyke wrote dozens of scientific papers and publications on food and nutrition, and their links to technology and social change. A list of his published books is below.

* &quot;Manual of Nutrition&quot; (1947)

== Broadcasting career ==
Pyke&#x27;s early broadcasts were from April 1953 in talks about science and technology on the BBC&#x27;s Home Service, Third Programme (later Radio 3), Light Programme and the educational programming of Network Three; later he also broadcast on Radio 2 and Radio 4.
In 1974, he appeared on Yorkshire Television&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Ask Me&quot; and then &quot;Don&#x27;t Just Sit There&quot; (until 1980), in which he and other experts such as David Bellamy, Rob Buckman and Miriam Stoppard fielded popular science questions. His exuberant delivery, with very animated and passionate speech and gesticulation, made him famous. He was a panellist on radio programmes such as &quot;Any Questions?&quot; and &quot;Just a Minute&quot; and a guest on &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;. He called this period his &quot;sixth life&quot;.

In September 1975, the popular science magazine &quot;New Scientist&quot; asked its readers to name the best-known and most characteristic scientist. Pyke came third after Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein. On 10 December 1975, Pyke was celebrated on &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, a Thames Television production for ITV. He won the Pye Colour Television Award for most promising male newcomer to television (1975) and the &quot;Multi-Coloured Swap Shop&quot; Star Award for expert of the year (1977–78).

<text>Lee Maurice Russell (November 16, 1875 – May 16, 1943) was an American politician from Mississippi.

He was born in Lafayette County, Mississippi, to William Eaton Russell and Louisa Jane (Mackey) Russell, and he later attended the University of Mississippi. During his time as a student, he was the leader in a movement to abolish Greek fraternities. Russell graduated from the university in 1901 and enrolled in the University of Mississippi School of Law. After completing the course, he was admitted to the bar and practiced law in Oxford, Mississippi.

Russell was elected to the Mississippi House of Representatives in 1907, representing Lafayette County from 1908 to 1912, and he was elected to the Mississippi State Senate in 1911, representing the 32nd district from 1912 to 1916. In 1912, he successfully passed a bill prohibiting secret and exclusive societies at the public institutions of higher learning. The law stayed on the books for twelve years.

Russell was elected to the office of lieutenant governor in 1915 and elected governor in 1919. Crop failures due to the boll weevil marked his term. Russell also filed an antitrust suit against several fire insurance companies for their business practices.

In terms of social reform Russell&#x27;s time as governor was a progressive one. As noted by one historian, “Although Governor Russell was not as successful as previous governors in getting many of his major proposals enacted, the legislature&#x27;s appropriations for educational and welfare purposes during his tenure set new records.” Higher state funding was provided for a TB sanitarium, an institution to house and treat mentally ill persons, charity hospitals (which included the approval of 3 new ones), and public schools and colleges. Constitutional amendments also provided for pensions for Confederate veterans or their widows, authorized a $2 poll tax on both men and women for education purposes, and a school year of at least 4 months. A number of labor laws were also introduced.

In 1923, he was sued for seduction and breach of promise by his former secretary Frances Birkhead. Russell was acquitted, and he blamed the lawsuit on the fire insurance industry.

Russell could not run for re-election due to the term limits in the Mississippi constitution. He retired to the Gulf Coast of Mississippi. There he sold real estate for a period before returning to Jackson to practice law until his death on May 16, 1943. He is buried at Lakewood Memorial Park in Jackson.

<doc id="923222" wikidata="Q5453443" url="?curid=923222" title="First Navy Jack">
<text>The First Navy Jack was the naval jack of the United States from 1975 to 1976 and again from 2002 to 2019. It was authorized by the U.S. Navy and was flown from the jackstaff of commissioned vessels of the U.S. Navy while moored pierside or at anchor. Since then, it is used only as a naval jack by the oldest active warship in the U.S. Navy. The design is traditionally regarded as that of the first U.S. naval jack, flown soon after independence, but this is not supported by the historical record.

The First Navy Jack was replaced as the U.S. naval jack by the U.S. Union Jack (consisting of white stars on a blue field, not to be confused with the flag of the United Kingdom, also commonly called &quot;the Union Jack&quot;) on June 4, 2019, by order of the Chief of Naval Operations.

==History==
In late 1775, as the first ships of the Continental Navy readied in the Delaware River, Commodore Esek Hopkins issued an instruction directing his vessels to fly a &quot;striped&quot; jack and ensign. The exact design of these flags is unknown. But, since about 1880, this jack has traditionally been depicted as consisting of thirteen red and white stripes charged with an uncoiled rattlesnake and the motto &quot;Dont Tread on Me&quot; ; this design appeared in a color plate in Admiral George Henry Preble&#x27;s influential &quot;History of the Flag of the United States&quot;. Recent scholarship, however, has demonstrated that this design never existed but &quot;was a 19th-century mistake based on an erroneous 1776 engraving&quot;.

In 1778, John Adams and Benjamin Franklin wrote a letter to the Ambassador of the Kingdom of Sicily, thanking him for allowing entry of revolutionary ships into Sicilian ports. The letter describes the new flag of the colonies according to the 1777 Flag Resolution, but also describes a flag of &quot;South Carolina, a rattlesnake, in the middle of the thirteen stripes.&quot;

The rattlesnake had long been a symbol in the colonies of resistance and defiance to the Crown. The phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t Tread on Me&quot; may have been coined during the American Revolutionary War, a variant perhaps of an earlier image. A snake severed in segments and labelled with the names of the colonies and the legend &quot;Join, or Die&quot;, had first been published in Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s &quot;Pennsylvania Gazette&quot; in 1754, as a political cartoon reflecting on the Albany Congress.

The rattlesnake (specifically, the Timber Rattlesnake) is especially significant and symbolic to the American Revolution. The rattle has thirteen layers, signifying the original Thirteen Colonies. Additionally, the snake does not strike until provoked, a characteristic expressed by the phrase &quot;Don&#x27;t tread on me&quot; (see Gadsden flag).

Typically the flag&#x27;s rattlesnake is depicted with red scales on its back, but some have depicted the snake as all-gold.

==Modern use==
===Shipboard===
Modern use of the flag is usually traced to 1976, when the United States celebrated its Bicentennial. All commissioned naval vessels were directed to fly the First Navy Jack for that calendar year while moored or anchored, and their commanding officers were authorized to retain and fly it thereafter.

The flag that had been used before, and afterward was the standard, was the fifty-star Union Jack. In 1980, Secretary of the Navy Edward Hidalgo directed that the warship or fleet auxiliary (e.g. a vessel designated as a &quot;United States Ship&quot; or &quot;USS&quot;) with the longest active status shall display the First Navy Jack until decommissioned or transferred to inactive service.

The status of the flag was changed on May 31, 2002. Navy Secretary Gordon England issued , directing all warships and auxiliaries of the U.S. Navy to fly the First Naval Jack as a &quot;temporary substitution&quot; for the Jack of the United States &quot;during the Global War on Terrorism&quot;. The idea was based on a post-9/11 suggestion from retired Captain Brayton Harris, who in 1975 and 1976 had been Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy for the bicentennial. Most vessels made the symbolic switch on September 11, 2002 during the first anniversary of the terrorist attacks. Not all US vessels flew the flag while moored or at anchor. Those that did not included commissioned vessels of the U.S. Coast Guard designated as &quot;United States Coast Guard Cutter&quot; (&quot;USCGC&quot;), USCG patrol boats, vessels of the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration, and predominantly civilian-crewed vessels of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Military Sealift Command.

On February 21, 2019, the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral John Richardson, announced the blue Union Jack would be returned to nearly all commissioned warships of the U.S. Navy. He restored the 1980 practice of reserving the First Navy Jack to the longest active status warship. This order disregards the , which technically is the oldest in the Navy but is used only for ceremonial purposes, and the , which was captured by North Korea in 1968 and is currently a museum ship though is still commissioned in the U.S. Navy. The honor of &quot;oldest ship&quot; in the Fleet was conferred on the following U.S. Navy vessels:

===Other U.S. Navy uses===
Since September 11, 2002, U.S. Navy installations and facilities ashore have been allowed but not required to fly the First Navy Jack from multi-halyard gaff-rigged flagpoles when the United States ensign is also flown.

The First Navy Jack has also been authorized for wear as a patch by sailors and naval officers on flight suits and certain versions of the Navy Working Uniform (NWU), including sailors and naval officers wearing the Army Combat Uniform (ACU) while assigned to and serving with Army units, at the discretion of the local Army commander. For the NWU and ACU, the patch is typically worn on the opposite sleeve as the U.S. flag.

This First Navy Jack, along with the Serapis flag, is also featured on the crest of the guided missile destroyer .

During the War in Afghanistan, U.S. Navy sailors and officers assigned to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) were authorized to wear the First Navy Jack on their MultiCam-patterned Army Combat Uniform (ACU) on the right sleeve, below the U.S. flag.
==Non-military uses==
Like other snake flags, the First Navy Jack has been used by non-Navy people in protest or commemoration. For example, opponents to a smoking ban in Franklin, Indiana, flew Navy Jacks outside their homes and businesses. A First Navy Jack flag was also placed at a makeshift memorial on Boylston Street after the Boston Marathon bombing.

He played in New Zealand bands such as the Crocodiles, and formed Australian &quot;a cappella&quot; groups, the Elevators, the Cafe of the Gate of Salvation, the Honeybees and the Heavenly Lights. In NZ, he formed the Napier Gospel Choir. Currently he lives in Sydney and works as a singer, composer, author and workshop leader, in the areas of vocal arranging and gospel music. He composes and arranges mainly for &quot;a cappella&quot; choirs, always with an ear to vernacular traditions – contemporary funk, African choirs, gospel – and to anything polyphonic. Works that typify his style are &quot;Jubilation&quot; and &quot;(I&#x27;ve Been Given) Two Wing&quot; as sung by the Café of the Gate of Salvation.

==Education and bands 1965—1985==
Backhouse completed a B.A. (English), and B.Mus. (Composition) at Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, in 1970, under the tutorship of composers David Farquhar and Jenny McLeod. He later completed a graduate course in ethnomusicology (focusing on blues and gospel) at University of Memphis, USA, with Professor David Evans.

In the early seventies, Backhouse composed and performed music for NZ radio, theatre and film, but most of his energies were spent in NZ funk/soul/pop bands, including Mammal, Spats, Rough Justice and the Crocodiles (which won three Recording Industry Awards in 1980).

Relocating to Australia in 1981, and following the demise of the Crocodiles, Backhouse formed his own band, Vulgar Beatmen (with ex-Crocodile Jonathan Zwartz and ex-Rough Justice Peter Boyd and Mike Gubb) and sang and/or played guitar with Renée Geyer, Joe Walsh, Jenny Morris, Jackie Orszaszcky, the Dan Johnson Band and many others. He has arranged and recorded backing vocals for Dave Dobbyn, Tim Finn, Vince Jones, Justine Clarke, Kate Ceberano, Harry Manx and the Umbrellas.

Backhouse&#x27;s songs have been recorded by Jenny Morris, Renée Geyer and others, and he has contributed to film soundtracks including &quot;Sweetie&quot; (Jane Campion), &quot;Rodney &amp; Juliet&quot; (Fane Flaws) and &quot;Braindead&quot; (Peter Jackson).

==A cappella &amp; gospel==
In the mid-eighties Backhouse became fascinated by the Black gospel tradition, and, as a result, increasingly involved in community music, choral directing and running vocal workshops. He founded the &quot;a cappella&quot; quartet the Elevators, &quot;a cappella&quot; gospel choirs the Café of the Gate of Salvation and the Honeybees and &quot;a cappella&quot; quartet the Heavenly Light Quartet.

Backhouse has received awards from the Contemporary A Cappella Society of America and composer commissions from The Song Company and the Australia Council. In 1990 he received an Australia Council International Study Grant to research Black gospel traditions at Memphis State University. In 2006, his song &quot;Lost in the Heavenly Light&quot; was nominated for the Australian Classical Music Awards for Vocal Work of the Year.

Since 1987, Backhouse has been running vocal workshops throughout Australia and New Zealand, Canada, the Pacific Islands, France, Italy and the UK, and has been a solo performer at festivals throughout Australia. He has published two African American gospel songbooks &#x27;A cappella – Rehearsing For Heaven&#x27; (1995; accompanying double CD, 2003) and &#x27;Move on Up&#x27; (2005), a book on directing vocal groups, &#x27;Freeing the song&#x27; (2010), and a songbook of his original choral compositions &#x27;In The Spirit&#x27; (2020).

==2008 to present==
Tony moved back to New Zealand in 2008, and continued to travel extensively, running workshops worldwide. He formed the Napier Gospel Choir in 2013, and sporadically contributed guitar and bass to gigs and recordings with Blessed Relief (Sydney), No Engine (Napier, NZ) and the Bend (NZ).

He returned to live in Australia in 2018. His current activities include running workshops in &quot;a cappella&quot; traditions, composing and arranging for vocal ensembles and choirs, singing with the Heavenly Light Quartet and recording original music with long-time colleagues Peter Dasent and Fane Flaws under the name the Bend. Tony &amp; Peter Dasent (as Blessed Relief) released an album of original songs in 2017, &quot;Design For Living&quot;. His album of experimental music (largely instrumental, electronic and percussive) &quot;The Disturbing Hedge&quot; was released in 2020. The Bend&#x27;s album &quot;We Disappear&quot;, poems by Sam Hunt set to music by Backhouse, Flaws and Dasent, was released in 2021.

<text>Pozsony county was an administrative county (comitatus) of the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory is now mostly part of Slovakia, while a small area belongs to Hungary. In 1969, the three villages that remained in Hungary were combined to form Dunasziget.

Its name changed along with that of the city of Pressburg (, today&#x27;s Bratislava). Its names around 1900 were &quot;Pozsony vármegye&quot; in Hungarian, &quot;Prešpurská župa&quot; in Slovak and &quot;Preßburger Gespanschaft&quot; in German.

==Geography==
The county shared borders with the Austrian land of Lower Austria and the Hungarian counties Nyitra, Komárom, Győr and Moson. It was situated between the river Morava in the west, the river Danube in the south, and the river Váh () in the east. The southern part of the Little Carpathians divided the county into two. It also covered most of the island known today as Žitný ostrov (Hungarian: &quot;Csallóköz&quot;) between the Danube and the Little Danube. Its area was 4,370 km2 around 1910.

==Seats==
The seats of Pozsony county were the Pozsony Castle (present-day Bratislava Castle) and Somorja (present-day Šamorín), and from the 18th century onwards the town of Pressburg.

==History==
A sort of predecessor to Pozsony county may be existed as early as the 9th century during the time of Great Moravia. After Pozsony county&#x27;s territory had become part of the Kingdom of Hungary, the Hungarian comitatus was created around 1000 or even earlier. It was one of the first counties created in the Kingdom of Hungary. Its territory comprised roughly what is today Bratislava Region and Trnava Region. Throughout its history it was among the most prosperous territories of Hungary, and until the late 18th century it was particularly advanced and prosperous. In the 18th and 19th century, the population consisted of Germans (mainly in Pressburg and larger towns), Hungarians (mainly in the south, some suburbs of Pressburg, Slovaks (mainly in the north and in the suburbs of Pressburg and Croats (mainly in the suburbs of Pressburg).

In the aftermath of World War I, most of Pozsony county became part of newly formed Czechoslovakia, as recognized by the concerned states in 1920 by the Treaty of Trianon. As Bratislava county, it continued to exist until 1927 in Czechoslovakia, but it had completely different powers and somewhat modified borders. A small part south of the river Danube remained part of Hungary and joined Győr-Moson-Pozsony county.

Following the provisions of the First Vienna Award, the southeastern part of the area (Žitný ostrov, Senec, Galanta) became part of Hungary again in November 1938. The approximate Trianon borders were restored after World War II.

<doc id="923234" wikidata="Q24969" url="?curid=923234" title="Blitz (gridiron football)">
<text>In gridiron football, blitzing is a tactic used by the defense to disrupt pass attempts by the offense. During a blitz, a higher than usual number of defensive players will rush the opposing quarterback, in an attempt either to tackle them or force them to hurry their pass attempt.

In practice, a blitz involves five or more players rushing during a single down, rather than the four or three rushers used during normal play. For example, in a defense that normally uses four defensive linemen to rush, a blitz can be created by adding one or more linebackers or defensive backs.

Blitzing is a higher-risk strategy, as fewer defensive players are left to cover receivers or to defend against running plays. However, a successful blitz will result in a sack or will force the quarterback into making an error.

The term &quot;blitz&quot; is German for &quot;lightning&quot; and a reference to the blitzkrieg tactic of World War II.

==History==
The term &quot;red-dog&quot; referred to a rushing linebacker that created a six-on-five matchup against the offensive line; and blitz meant rushing seven, thereby leaving one potential receiver uncovered. 

Chuck Drulis is widely credited with inventing the safety blitz in 1960 while serving as defensive coordinator of the St. Louis Cardinals. He had devised a play called &quot;Wildcat&quot; which called for a safety to be the extra pass rusher. He believed the pressure on the quarterback would be severe, since defensive backs had almost never taken part in pass rushes before.

Bill Arnsparger is the likely creator of the zone blitz. A zone blitz is a defensive tactic that sends additional players to rush the opposing team&#x27;s quarterback, while also unexpectedly redirecting a supposed pass rushing player into pass coverage instead.

==How blitzing works==
On passing plays, the offense always has at least five people blocking. From the quarterback&#x27;s left to right, they are the left tackle, left guard, center, right guard, right tackle (known collectively as the offensive line). The quarterback will throw the pass, and is not an available blocker. Any other player is available to block, or to be a target for a pass, depending on the play design and modification by the quarterback and center based on what they see the defense doing.
By nature, blitzes are risky endeavors for the defense. Since the defense is taking away coverage defenders to rush the quarterback, this usually means that the secondary can not afford to miss any coverage assignments. The defense does not and cannot cover all offensive players, but rather through the blitz, is proactively involved in pressuring the quarterback—specifically, trying to sack them, throw off their timing, or force them to make an error such as an interception or fumble.

The most common blitzes are linebacker blitzes. Less common is sending a defensive back on a blitz, whether safety blitzes in which a safety (usually the free safety) is sent, or corner blitzes where a cornerback is sent. Sending a defensive back on a blitz is even riskier than a linebacker blitz as it removes a primary pass defender from the coverage scheme. Despite this, the pressure is very severe because a blitz by a defensive back is usually not anticipated by the offensive team&#x27;s blockers.

==Defensive shells and techniques==

Blitzes are usually run from &quot;Cover 1&quot; coverage shells, which assign one man to guard the entire deep field, though blitzes can be employed in nearly any type of coverage scheme. Cover 1 is most effective in terms of blitzing because it allows a larger number of defensive players to tighten down on the line of scrimmage, thus increasing the variety of blitzes possible.

Since the main goal is to disrupt the offensive play before it even develops, many blitz packages encourage cornerbacks to play tight man bump and run coverage to disrupt the wide receivers&#x27; release and prevent them from running their pre-assigned routes. The non-blitzing safety, usually the free safety, has an enormous amount of field to protect and is at a serious disadvantage if the blitz is unsuccessful and receivers threaten his coverage area or if the offense can quickly move the ball forward through immediate checkdown passes or draw plays. As such, he usually works for depth upon the snap of the ball, backpedaling into his assigned zone.

Linebackers are either blitzing or in pass coverage. Blitzing linebackers can employ various stunts to confuse the offense&#x27;s blockers and break down their protection scheme. Coverage linebackers in a Cover 1 scheme will usually have man responsibility on a halfback, fullback, or tight end.

Some defensive schemes employ &quot;key&quot; blitzes where a player will blitz only if his assigned man stays in to block, thus keying his action off the action of his man. If his man releases into a pass pattern, then the defensive player will cover him. For example, if weak side linebacker has the fullback as his man, if upon the snap of the ball the fullback blocks, the linebacker will blitz.

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Advantages gained by blitzing are obvious: proactively disrupt the offense&#x27;s play before it develops and cause enough pressure on the quarterback to force him into a turnover, sack, or incomplete pass.

Disadvantages abound in any blitz scheme as well. First, the offensive linemen are usually trained to recognize a blitzing player before the snap of the ball. They communicate with each other at the line of scrimmage using code words that shift the protection to the blitzing player&#x27;s side, thus strengthening their blocking front. The quarterback can also call other players into the protection scheme with audibles if he feels that his current protection is weak. With good protection calls and fundamental blocking principles, some blitzes can be &quot;picked up&quot;—stopped at the point of attack.

Second, the tight man bump and run technique typical of blitz scheme cornerbacks can be defeated with aggressive wide receiver release moves. Once this happens, the cornerback is at a disadvantage and must regain ground and position quickly to prevent a catch. If the blitz is picked up, the wide receiver can create enough separation to become open relatively quickly.

Third, if the blitz is picked up, the one deep defender (usually the free safety) has an enormous amount of territory to guard. If two players simultaneously threaten his zone, he must decide which one to cover. The quarterback can read his reaction and throw to the other receiver, usually for a big gain.

Fourth, if the pass is caught, there are fewer defenders and larger gaps between defenders, meaning that the receiver can get more yards after catch and possibly turn a minimal gain into a dangerous play.

== Playing against the blitz ==
Offenses employ the above procedures to beat the blitz as well as two other techniques and passing route combinations designed to exploit weaknesses in a blitzing scheme.

One of those techniques is called &quot;throwing hot,&quot; which entails intentionally leaving one blitzing defensive player unblocked. The offensive line usually makes pre-snap adjustments so that the &quot;free&quot; rusher is clearly within the QB&#x27;s field of vision. This limits devastating blind-side hits on the QB by rushers. When the preparedness of a quarterback allows him to not have to worry about getting hit from behind, it is one less psychological element of the blitz to be taken away, and thus blitz is incrementally made less effective by that particular element.

The other technique, sometimes used in conjunction with throwing hot, is called sight adjustment. Receivers are taught to run into the empty spot vacated by a blitzing player instead of running their pre-assigned pattern. The QB sees the free rusher or blitzing LB/CB and knows that the receiver will sight adjust accordingly and run a route that takes him into the hole left by the defender.

The West Coast Offense is an offense that focuses on ball control and short passes. This is a well timed offense where the quarterback throws the ball quickly to avoid the rush, but still allow the wide receiver to get behind the blitzing players.

<doc id="923235" wikidata="Q155577" url="?curid=923235" title="My Heart Will Go On">
<text>&quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; is a song performed by Canadian singer Celine Dion, used as the theme for the 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot;. It was composed by James Horner, with lyrics by Will Jennings, and produced by Horner, Walter Afanasieff and Simon Franglen. It was released as a single internationally by Columbia and Epic on November 24, 1997, and included on Dion&#x27;s album &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; (1997) and the .

Horner composed the basis of &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; as a motif for the &quot;Titanic&quot; soundtrack, and suggested developing it into a song. The director, James Cameron, felt a pop song would be inappropriate for the film, but agreed after hearing the demo. The final version was arranged by Afanasieff. The music video was directed by Bille Woodruff.

&quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; is considered Dion&#x27;s signature song. It topped the charts in more than 25 countries and was the best-selling single of 1998. With worldwide sales estimated at more than 18 million, it is the second-best-selling single by a woman in music history and one of the best-selling singles of all time. It was included in the list of &quot;Songs of the Century&quot; by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and the National Endowment for the Arts. &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; won the Grammy Award for Record of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or for Television.

==Writing and recording==
Before the release of the film &quot;Titanic&quot;, studio executives worried that it would be a commercial failure. Sony had paid $800,000 for the rights to and were hoping it would include a theme song. However, the director, James Cameron, felt that ending &quot;Titanic&quot; with a pop song would be inappropriate.

James Horner, the composer of the &quot;Titanic&quot; score, initially composed &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; as an instrumental motif for the film. Wanting to prepare a vocal version for the end credits, he enlisted the lyricist Will Jennings, who wrote the lyrics &quot;from the point of view of a person of a great age looking back so many years&quot;. 

The song was originally intended for the Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø. Simon Franglen, who was working with Horner on electronic textures and synthesizers for the score, suggested Céline Dion, with whom he had worked on many hits. Dion initially did not want to record it, as she had already recorded the film songs &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot; and &quot;Because You Loved Me&quot;. However, her husband and producer, René Angélil, convinced her to record a demo.

Horner waited until Cameron was in an appropriate mood before presenting him with the demo. After listening several times, Cameron approved it, but worried that he might be criticized for &quot;going commercial at the end of the movie&quot;. Cameron also wanted to appease the anxious studio executives and &quot;saw that a hit song from his movie could only be a positive factor in guaranteeing its completion&quot;.

The music producer Walter Afanasieff was not impressed with the demo, finding it meandering and dreary, but agreed to arrange and produce the studio version. He replaced all parts of Horner&#x27;s demo, and was upset that Horner was given a co-producer credit.

According to the music executive Tommy Mottola, Dion recorded her vocal in one take, and that demo is what was released in the film. Dion re-recorded the song for her album &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; after the film&#x27;s release, with a few note changes at the end.

==Composition==
&quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; is in the key of E major. The verses follow the chord progression of E–Bsus4–Aadd9–E–B, while the choruses follow Cm–B–A–B. The song modulates to A-flat major at the end. It contains emphasis on the instrumental arranging. Usage of Tin Whistle is prominent, backed by melodic use of strings and rhythm guitars. The song features both acoustic and electronic instrumentation. Dion&#x27;s vocal performance is described as &quot;emotional&quot; and &quot;demanding&quot; by Pandora Radio.

The Horner-Franglen &quot;demo&quot; version of the ballad runs a little over five minutes and has an extended ending with longer, segmented vocalizations by Dion. Franglen mixed the final film and soundtrack version, expanding on the demo and adding orchestra to the final chorus. It is this version which appears on the &quot;Titanic&quot; soundtrack album and is also played over the ending credits of the film.

When the single was to be released to radio, it was produced further by Walter Afanasieff who added string and electric guitar, as well as rearranged portions of the song. This version, which runs a little over four and a half minutes, appears on both the 4-track maxi single and Dion&#x27;s album &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot;. At the height of the song&#x27;s popularity, some radio stations in the US and the UK played an edited version of the song, that had dramatic moments of dialogue from Jack and Rose, the lead characters in the film, inserted in between Dion&#x27;s vocal lines.

===Sissel Kyrkjebø===
The Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø was scheduled to record the song for the film in 1997, but Dion&#x27;s vocals were preferred due to Horner&#x27;s decision to support Dion&#x27;s career. In a December 2014 interview, Horner said: &quot;When I had completed the &quot;Titanic&quot; [film], I had to decide for Celine Dion or Sissel[&#x27;s] [vocals]. Sissel I am very close, while Celine I had known since she was 18, and I had already written three film songs for [her]. But that was before Celine was known and filmmakers and marketing people had not done what they should have done for Celine and [her] songs. So I felt I owed her a &quot;Titanic&quot; chance, but I could [still] have used Sissel there&quot;. Instead, Kyrkjebø completed much of the score for the soundtrack album, &quot;Titanic: Music from the Motion Picture&quot;. Dion accepted to sing a demo for the film, despite being initially hesitant to record as she had already done three film songs earlier. Years later, Horner chose Kyrkjebø to perform &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; on both world premieres of &quot;Titanic 3D&quot; (2012) and &quot;Titanic Live&quot; (2015).

==Critical reception==
The song was generally well received by music critics. AllMusic senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the song &quot;shines the most brilliantly&quot; and marked it as a standout track from the &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; album. Another AllMusic reviewer, single editor Heather Phares, who rated the single 4 out of 5 stars, wrote, &quot;Indeed, her performances of it on VH1 Divas, the 1998 Academy Awards (wearing the film&#x27;s &#x27;Heart of the Ocean&#x27; pendant, no less), and on her 1997 album &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; have cemented &#x27;My Heart Will Go On&#x27; as the quintessence of Dion&#x27;s sweeping, romantic style&quot;. Larry Flick from &quot;Billboard&quot; called it a &quot;stately ballad&quot;, noting that the song &quot;woos with romantic lyrics and a melancholy melody that is fleshed out with a weeping flute solo.&quot; He added, &quot;There&#x27;s no denying that Dion can hit notes that shatter glass—and she does so here—but it&#x27;s a pleasure to hear her build slowly and remind listeners of her ability to pack volumes of emotion in a whisper. A fine single that will add a much-needed touch of class to every station it graces.&quot;

&quot;Music Week&quot; named it &quot;Single of the Week&quot; and gave it five out of five, writing that &quot;Dion delivers another stunning vocal on an Irish-style production&quot;. The magazine&#x27;s Alan Jones felt the Celtic stylings &quot;help the record build from quiet beginnings into a most powerful, stirring ballad, with Dion&#x27;s voice adapting to whatever is required, from gentle breathiness to full throttle.&quot; &quot;People Magazine&quot; stated that &quot;the dramatics are fitting when she sings &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; as a survivor mourning the lover she lost when the big ship went down.&quot; Yahoo.com described it as an &quot;emotional power ballad that perfectly captured [&quot;Titanic&quot;″s] romantic yearning&quot;. &quot;Vulture&quot; said that it is a powerful song and has &quot;one of the most glorious key changes in recorded music history&quot;, and that &quot;its legacy is eclipsed only by Whitney Houston&#x27;s (admittedly far superior) song &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;&quot;. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; appreciated how the song was not just tagged on the end of the three-hour film, but has a lyrical motif that was already placed throughout the key moments of the film&#x27;s love story in order to create a musical narrative.

The song has also received some criticism. In 2011, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers ranked it the seventh worst song of the 1990s, with the magazine writing, &quot;Celine Dion&#x27;s song and the movie have aged very poorly...Now [the song] probably just makes you cringe.&quot; &quot;The Atlantic&quot; attributed the song&#x27;s decline in popularity to its overexposure and added that over the years there have been many jokes that parody the song&#x27;s lyrics by claiming &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; goes &quot;on and on and on&quot;. &quot;Vulture&quot; reasoned that it has become fashionable to dislike the song because it &quot;encapsulates most everything that once-enthusiastic moviegoers now dislike about &quot;Titanic&quot;: it&#x27;s outdated, cheesy, and overly dramatic&quot;. &quot;Maxim&quot; deemed it &quot;the second most tragic event ever to result from that fabled ocean liner&quot;.

==Accolades==
&quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; accumulated multiple awards from prestigious award giving bodies across the world. It won the 1998 Academy Award for Best Original Song. It dominated the 1999 Grammy Awards, winning Record of the Year — marking the first time to be won by a Canadian — Song of the Year, Best Female Pop Vocal Performance and Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television. The song also won the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song in 1998. it was also nominated for Best Song for A Movie at the 1998 MTV Movie Awards, but lost the award to Men in Black by Will Smith.

The song won a Japanese Gold Disc Award, for Song of the Year, as well as a &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Award for Soundtrack Single of the Year. Moreover, it also won at MTV Asia Awards for International Song of the Year in 1999.

It has been named one of the Songs of the Century. It is one of the best-selling singles ever in the United Kingdom, the second single released by Dion to sell over a million copies there. This made Dion one of only two female artists to date to have released two million-selling singles in Britain. In December 2007, the song was placed on number 21 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of the 90&#x27;s&quot;. In April 2010, the UK radio station Magic 105.4 voted the single the &quot;top movie song of all time&quot; after listeners&#x27;s votes. It was ranked at number 14 on AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Songs, celebrating the 100 greatest songs in American film history.

==Cultural impact==
The song became &quot;imprinted on the movie&#x27;s legacy&quot;, and every listen prompts a reminder of the blockbuster and the hype surrounding it. &quot;USA Today&quot; agreed that the song will be forever tied to &quot;Titanic&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; has argued that it is the marriage of music and image that make both the song and film greater than the sum of their parts.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that &quot;&quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; helped make 1998 an amazing year for big pop ballads.&quot; &quot;The Atlantic&quot; stated that its popularity did not stem from being played at events such as high school proms, weddings, and funerals, but by being indelibly placed into pop culture through numerous plays on the radio station, speakers, and passing cars. Anne T. Donahue from &quot;TrackRecord&quot; called it &quot;The Greatest Movie Ballad Of All Time&quot; stating: &quot;It changed the game for movie ballads altogether, and the impact was felt immediately.&quot; MTV listed &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; as the sixth biggest song of the &#x27;90s.

In New Zealand, &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot;, along with Dion&#x27;s rendition of &quot;The Power of Love&quot;, are favorites of siren kings, a Pasifika youth subculture originating in South Auckland who stage modified vehicle public address system loudspeaker competitions. The song is a staple of the competitions, due to the purity and clarity of Dion&#x27;s voice suiting the audio range for public address systems. The song is played at full volume through speakers attached to cars in the small hours of the morning, in a contest by siren kings to produce the loudest sound.

In the late 2010s, a pop culture trend emerged on platforms such as YouTube in which the song&#x27;s iconic key change would be edited in as the soundtrack to a dramatic moment from a sporting match, such as a winning shot. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Barcelona pianist Alberto Gestoso performed &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; for his quarantined neighbors. In 2021, the DJ at the January 6 Trump rally in Washington, D.C. played &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; to the crowd.

The film &quot;Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar&quot; (2021) featured a remix of the song. Bruno Mars opened his first show since early 2020 at MGM, in continuation of his Las Vegas residency and did a rendition of the song. Ariana Grande sang the song with James Corden on a segment at &quot;The Late Late Show with James Corden&quot;.

In 2024, then-presidential candidate Donald Trump used &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; at rallies. Dion released a statement saying she did not endorse its use and expressed surprise at the choice. &quot;Variety&quot; said that the song &quot;evokes the tragedy of the &quot;Titanic&quot; and, in the film, Leonardo DiCaprio’s dying character sinking to the bottom of the sea&quot;.

==Music video==
The accompanying music video for &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; was directed by Bille Woodruff and shows Dion singing at the bow of the ship while scenes from the film are inter-cut in between. It was filmed in front of a green screen in Los Angeles. Titanic computer artists filled in the background. On set, Celine provided one special effect, it required her to sing a high speed version of the signature song. In January 2018 the director&#x27;s cut of the music video appeared on YouTube. It contains unseen footage of Celine including her walking to the bow and a segment which puts her right into the movie.

On March 23, 2023, a new music video was released to commemorate the 25th anniversary of Dion&#x27;s performance of the song at the 70th Academy Awards. The video features alternate never-before-seen footage from the video shoot and was restored from its original 35mm elements to 4K resolution.

==Live performances==
MTV called Dion&#x27;s performance at the 70th Academy Awards in 1997 &quot;true perfection ... she sounds flawless&quot;. &quot;My Heart Will Go On&quot; was performed by Dion in concert during her &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; World Tour (1998–1999), her Las Vegas residency show A New Day... (2003–2007), her Taking Chances World Tour (2008–2009) and her second Las Vegas residency show Celine (2011–2019). It was also performed during her show &quot;Une seule fois&quot; at Sur les plaines d&#x27;Abraham in Quebec City July 27, 2013, during her Tournée Européenne 2013, her Summer Tour 2016, Live 2017 and Live 2018 tours and most recently her Courage World Tour. Dion also performed the song during her BST Hyde Park concert in London on July 5, 2019. One of her backup singers played the tin whistle part of the song. Dion performed the song for the 20th anniversary of &quot;Titanic&quot; at the 2017 &quot;Billboard&quot; Music Awards.

<text>Bernard Castro (August 11, 1904 – August 24, 1991) was the inventor of the modern convertible couch.

Born in Sicily, Castro emigrated to the United States in 1919. He never finished high school, but went to work as an upholsterer&#x27;s apprentice. In 1931 with $400 in capital he opened his first store, which eventually became a chain. At his death in 1991, he had sold over 5 million of his convertible sofas through 48 retail showrooms in 12 states, becoming a multimillionaire in the process.

Castro married Theresa Barabas on Valentine&#x27;s Day 1942. Their two children were Bernard, Jr. and Bernadette. Bernadette became locally famous in the New York area as the company&#x27;s official four-year-old spokesperson. Theresa died in March 2002, aged 85. Castro Convertibles was acquired in 1993 by Krause Furniture.

Bernard was involved with every aspect of the product’s development, production and sale. Bernard brought the sofa bed into the living room; formerly that category of product was not thought of as a living room piece of furniture. With Bernard’s interior design background, he was able to introduce a more fashion-forward concept for convertible furniture. Bernard was a genius at advertising, using all three mediums at once: television, radio, and print in all markets where Castro Convertibles had showrooms. A favorite innovation was the &quot;Scotch n Sofa&quot;, a sofa that converted into a bar with a built-in turntable, unlike anything else in the marketplace. Products like this made Castro Convertibles the leader and innovator in convertible furniture. Bernard believed in making his showrooms a destination for customers, with a real “show business” experience. Bernard built a 35-foot boat in his celebrated Fort Lauderdale showroom, which attracted customers from all over the region.

Bernard donated his time and resources generously to a number of causes throughout the course of his life, including the Columbus Citizens Foundation (Bernard was a founding member of the organization), Boys Town of Italy, the Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith, the American Heart Association, and the Royal Dames for Cancer Research. Bernard was a recipient of the coveted Horatio Alger Award in 1963. The award is given to entrepreneurial and nonprofit leaders who have achieved the American Dream via extraordinary accomplishments. Bernard was also a member of the Knight of Malta and the Knight of Holy Sepulcher. In 2014, Bernard was one of four inductees into The American Furniture Hall of Fame at the Foundation&#x27;s annual banquet in High Point, North Carolina. Bernard also received a bronze plaque on the Foundation’s Walk of Fame and is featured in Foundation&#x27;s Wall of Fame exhibit, which are both located in Furniture Plaza in High Point. Castro received an Honorary Doctor of Commercial Science Ph.D. from Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry, New York in 1974. 

Bernard was a founding member of the Florida Council of 100 and a member of the 23rd Street Association in New York City. Bernard spent many years in Florida and was very active in the Ocala/Marion County Chamber of Commerce and was also a huge supporter of the Florida National Guard. He dedicated several hundred acres of his Ocala land for a Special National Guard Drop Zone and was made an honorary Green Beret and upon his death there was a tribute in the United States Armed Forces publication, Stars and Stripes.

Bernadette Castro managed the sale to Krause but retained the large portfolio of commercial real estate her father had acquired, both retail and industrial. Those properties in New York, Florida, Connecticut, and Virginia put the family in the real estate business. The iconic Castro Convertible brand was retired until 2010, when Bernadette Castro and her children bought back the intellectual property and relaunched the business with one of the most popular original products, the Castro Convertible Ottoman. Rather than retail locations, the new Castro is available online for purchase by both consumers and the lodging and resort industry.

<doc id="923251" wikidata="Q2071582" url="?curid=923251" title="Crystal healing">
<text>Crystal healing is a pseudoscientific alternative-medicine practice that uses semiprecious stones and crystals such as quartz, agate, amethyst or opal. Despite the common use of the term &quot;crystal&quot;, many popular stones used in crystal healing, such as obsidian, are not technically crystals. Adherents of the practice claim that these have healing powers, but there is no scientific basis for this claim. Practitioners of crystal healing believe they can boost low energy, prevent bad energy, release blocked energy, and transform a body&#x27;s aura. There is no evidence that crystal healing has any greater effect upon the body than any other placebo.

While the practice is popular, it fosters commercial demand for crystals, which can result in environmental damage and exploitative child labor to mine the crystals. Several popular crystals used by believers such as shungite frequently contain heavy metals and present toxicity risks to those handling them for extended periods or ingesting substances which were in contact with the crystals.

==History==
===Origins===
In Plato&#x27;s account of Atlantis, crystal healing is also mentioned. According to Plato, the Atlanteans used crystals to read minds and transmit thoughts. The Sumerians purportedly used crystals in their magical formulas 6000 years ago.

Ancient Egyptians mined for crystals and used them to make jewelry. Crystals or gemstones were also used in practice, for their metaphysical properties. Specifically, they used crystals as aids for health and protection. They often would bury a lapis lazuli scarab with their deceased, with the belief that it would protect them in the afterlife. Additionally, in Ancient Egypt amulets were used to ensure the well-being of the individual. The amulet&#x27;s shape, decoration, inscription, color, material, or ritual performed with the amulet dictated its power. Amulets were worn or placed on the body, in the form of stones, piercings, rings, necklaces, or other jewelry. The Egyptians used amulets to benefit their afterlife, often representing an Egyptian deity and their specific powers. Amulets were also placed on mummies or in between the mummy&#x27;s bandages, with funerary pieces usually being larger than those worn by the living. In funeral practices they also used headrest amulets, these were full-size headrests placed in tombs to protect the dead, they also symbolized the deceased rising and being revived, and the sun rising between two hills, which symbolized resurrection and rebirth.

The Ancient Greeks assigned a multitude of properties to crystals. The word &#x27;crystal&#x27; is derived from the Greek word &quot;krýstallos&quot; which translates to &quot;ice&quot;. The Ancient Greeks believed that clear quartz crystals were a water that had frozen to the point where it would remain in its solid form. The word &quot;amethyst&quot; in Ancient Greek language means &quot;not intoxicate.&quot; Amethyst was worn as an amulet that they believed would aid hangovers or prevent intoxication.
Precious stones have been thought of as objects that can aid in healing—in a practice known as lapidary medicine—by a variety of cultures. The Hopi Native Americans of Arizona use quartz crystals to assist in diagnosing illnesses. Both Pliny the Elder and Galen claimed that certain crystals had medicinal properties. In Europe, the belief in the healing powers of crystals (and in particular crystal amulets) persisted into the Middle Ages. The alleged medicinal properties of precious stones, as well as other powers they were believed to hold, were collected in texts known as lapidaries, which remained popular in Medieval and Early Modern Europe until the 17th century.

Across cultures, different stones can symbolize or provide aide for different things. An example of this is rose quartz. In Egypt, it was believed rose quartz could prevent aging, but the Romans used rose quartz as a seal to signify ownership, while in the Middle Ages it was used in healing potions, today rose quartz is known as the &quot;love stone&quot; and is used to balance emotions, and heal anger and disappointment.

==Contemporary use==
===New Age===
In the English speaking world, crystal healing is heavily associated with the New Age spiritual movement: &quot;the middle-class New Age healing activity &quot;par excellence&quot;&quot;. In contrast with other forms of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM), participants in crystal healing view the practice as &quot;individuated&quot;, that is &quot;dependent on extreme personalization and creative expression.&quot; Practitioners of crystal healing purport that certain physical properties such as shape, color, and markings, determine the ailments that a stone can heal; lists of such links are published in commonly distributed texts. Paradoxically, practitioners also &quot;hold the view that crystals have no intrinsic qualities but that, instead, their quality changes according to both&quot; participants. After selecting the stones by color or their believed metaphysical qualities, they place them on parts of the body. Color selection and placement of stones are done according to concepts of grounding, &quot;chakras&quot;, or energy grids.

=== Sales and industry ===
Worldwide, retail sales of crystals were estimated to amount to more than US$1 billion per year in 2019.

India, China, Brazil, and Madagascar are the main producers of crystals. In Madagascar, one of the sources of crystals, most crystals are mined in unsafe, non-industrial or &quot;homemade&quot; mines, with parents and children working together to dig crystals from pits and tunnels they dig with shovels. The miners are usually paid between 17 and 23 cents per kilogram for rose quartz (≈ 8 - 11 cents per pound). The miner&#x27;s income may be just 0.1% of the final retail price. Some people in the industry say that the low pay for miners is because customers in developed countries want low retail prices; others say that it is due to shops in developed countries wanting to be more profitable.

==Scientific evaluation==
There is no peer-reviewed scientific evidence that crystal healing has any effect; it is considered a pseudoscience. Alleged successes of crystal healing can be attributed to the placebo effect. Furthermore, there is no scientific basis for the concepts of &quot;chakras&quot;, being &quot;blocked&quot;, energy grids requiring grounding, or other such terms; they are widely understood to be religious or spiritual in nature. Energy, as a scientific term, is a very well-defined concept that is readily measurable and bears little resemblance to the esoteric concept of energy used by proponents of crystal healing.

In 1999, researchers French and Williams conducted a study to investigate the power of crystals compared with a placebo. Eighty volunteers were asked to meditate with either a quartz crystal, or a placebo stone which was indistinguishable from quartz. Many of the participants reported feeling typical &quot;crystal effects&quot;; however, this was irrespective of whether the crystals were real or placebo. In 2001 Christopher French, head of the anomalistic psychology research unit at the University of London and colleagues from Goldsmiths College outlined their study of crystal healing at the British Psychological Society Centenary Annual Conference, concluding: &quot;There is no evidence that crystal healing works over and above a placebo effect.&quot;

Crystal healing effects could also be attributed to confirmation bias (which occurs when the believers want the practice to be true and see only things that back up that desire).

Crystal healing techniques are also practiced on animals, although some veterinary organizations, such as the British Veterinary Association, have warned that these methods are not scientifically proven and state that people should seek the advice of a vet before using alternative techniques.

Crystal healing proponents and 5G conspiracy theorists have falsely alleged the pseudoscientific and misinformational belief that shungite may absorb 5G radiation.

<doc id="923252" wikidata="Q947766" url="?curid=923252" title="Wallace Reid">
<text>William Wallace Halleck Reid (April 15, 1891 – January 18, 1923) was an American actor in silent film, referred to as &quot;the screen&#x27;s most perfect lover&quot;.
He also had a brief career as a racing driver.

== Early life ==
Reid was born in St. Louis, Missouri, into a showbusiness family. His mother, Bertha Westbrook, was an actress, and his father, James Halleck &quot;Hal&quot; Reid, worked successfully in a variety of theatrical jobs, mainly as playwright and actor, traveling the country. As a boy, Wallace Reid was performing on stage at an early age, but acting was put on hold while he obtained an education at Freehold Military School in Freehold Township, New Jersey. He later graduated from Perkiomen Seminary in Pennsburg, Pennsylvania in 1909. A gifted all-around athlete, Reid participated in a number of sports while also following an interest in music, learning to play the piano, banjo, drums, and violin. As a teenager, he spent time in Wyoming, where he learned to be an outdoorsman.

== Career ==
Reid was drawn to the burgeoning movie industry by his father, who shifted from the theater to writing films, directing them, and acting in them. In 1910, Reid appeared in his first film, &quot;The Phoenix&quot;, an adaptation of a Milton Nobles play, filmed at Selig Polyscope Studios in Chicago. Reid used the script from a play his father had written and approached the very successful Vitagraph Studios, hoping to be given the opportunity to direct. Instead, Vitagraph executives capitalized on his sex appeal, and in addition to having him direct, cast him in a major role. Although Reid&#x27;s good looks and powerful physique made him the perfect ‘matinée idol’, he was equally happy with roles behind the scenes and often worked as a writer, cameraman, and director.

Reid was arrested in Portland, Oregon in 1921 for violating Prohibition law.
Wallace Reid appeared in several films with his father, and as his career in film flourished, he was soon acting and directing with and for early film mogul Allan Dwan. In 1913, while at Universal Pictures, Reid met and married actress Dorothy Davenport. He was featured as Jeff, the blacksmith, in &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), and he had an uncredited role in &quot;Intolerance&quot; (1916),
both directed by D. W. Griffith; he worked with leading ladies such as Florence Turner, Gloria Swanson, Lillian Gish, Elsie Ferguson, and Geraldine Farrar, becoming one of Hollywood&#x27;s major heartthrobs. 

Already involved with the creation of more than 100 motion picture shorts, Reid was signed by producer Jesse L. Lasky and starred in over 60 films for Lasky&#x27;s Famous Players film company, which later became Paramount Pictures. Frequently paired with actress Ann Little, his action-hero role as the dashing race-car driver drew fans to theaters to see his daredevil auto thrillers such as &quot;The Roaring Road&quot; (1919), &quot;Double Speed&quot; (1920), &quot;Excuse My Dust&quot; (1920), and &quot;Too Much Speed&quot; (1921). &quot;Across the Continent&quot; (1922), one of his auto-racing films, was chosen as the opening night film for San Francisco&#x27;s Castro Theatre, which opened on 22 June 1922. 

Reid loved racing so much that he even entered a vehicle into the 1922 Indianapolis 500; he eventually withdrew before qualifying.

== Death ==
While en route to a location in California during filming of &quot;The Valley of the Giants&quot; (1919), Reid was injured in a train wreck near Arcata, California, and he needed six stitches to close a scalp wound. To continue filming, he was prescribed morphine for relief of his pain, and Reid soon became addicted. He continued working at a frantic pace in films that were growing more physically demanding, and changing from 15–20 minutes in duration to as much as an hour. Reid&#x27;s morphine addiction worsened at a time when rehabilitation programs were non-existent.

On January 18, 1923, he died from influenza in a sanatorium, aged 31, while attempting to recover from his addiction.

Wallace Reid was interred in the Azalea Terrace of the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California.

== Aftermath ==
His widow, Dorothy Davenport (billed as Mrs. Wallace Reid), co-produced and appeared in &quot;Human Wreckage&quot; (1923), making a national tour with the film to publicize the dangers of drug addiction. She and Reid had two children: a son, Wallace Reid Jr., born in 1917; and a daughter, Betty Mummert, whom they adopted in 1922 as a three-year-old.

Wallace Reid&#x27;s contribution to the movie industry has been recognized with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

== Popular culture ==
In the biopic &quot;Valentino&quot; (1977), Reid is portrayed as a bicycle-riding, childish movie star. In the 1980 documentary &quot;Hollywood&quot; episode &quot;Single Beds and Double Standards&quot;, Reid&#x27;s story is recalled by people who worked with him: Karl Brown, Henry Hathaway, Gloria Swanson,and stuntman Bob Rose.

A biography appeared in 2007, the first work on Reid&#x27;s life since his mother&#x27;s personal recollections were published shortly after the actor&#x27;s death.

A episode of &quot;Hollywood Babylon&quot; that gave a biographic sketch of Reid was criticized in a 2018 podcast by Karina Longworth.

<text>Henry Lewis Whitfield (June 20, 1868 – March 18, 1927) was an American politician who was Governor of Mississippi from 1924 until he died in 1927.

==Biography==
Whitfield was born in Rankin County, Mississippi. He began his teaching career at the age of sixteen. Whitfield obtained his teaching degree in 1895 from the Mississippi College. Governor Anselm J. McLaurin appointed Whitfield to state superintendent of education in 1898. He was re-elected to the post in 1899 and 1903. Whitfield was appointed president of Industrial Institute and College in 1907. The college experienced growth under his leadership.

Whitfield was elected governor in 1923, narrowly defeating Theodore G. Bilbo. This was also the first election in which women could vote for the governor.

As governor, Whitfield recommended various progressive programs such as improving the mental health care system and public schools.

In 1926, Whitfield fell ill. He went to Memphis, Tennessee for treatment and returned to Jackson, Mississippi. While he could conduct business, his condition worsened, and he died in the Governor&#x27;s Mansion. He is buried at the Friendship Cemetery in Columbus, Mississippi.

<doc id="923258" wikidata="Q4926178" url="?curid=923258" title="Blerta">
<text>Blerta (&quot;Bruno Lawrence&#x27;s Electric Revelation and Travelling Apparition&quot;) was a New Zealand musical and theatrical co-operative active from 1971 until 1975.

It was the idea of Bruno Lawrence to arrange a group of musicians, actors and friends, who would travel around New Zealand on a tour to get away from the pressure of the music and movie scene. He organised the travelling group, and in October 1971, they departed on their tour. The group travelled around New Zealand in a very distinctive red bus, concluding in January 1973 at the first large outdoor music festival in New Zealand, The Great Ngaruawahia Music Festival, before heading up the eastern seaboard of Australia, and performing at the 1973 Aquarius Festival at the Northern Rivers NSW hippie town of Nimbin.

The group lived in a commune for many years. Three families lived together, including those of Bruno Lawrence and Geoff Murphy. The group came to the attention of the New Zealand film industry and were employed at times to create work for TVNZ. The group were labelled as hippies during that time and were looked down upon by some in the industry, despite the quality and nature of their work. Nevertheless, the band had a significant hit with their song &quot;Dance All Around The World&quot;, which reached #13 in the N.Z. music charts in June 1972.
The line-up changed throughout the years that Blerta travelled. Members included Lawrence, Fane Flaws, Beaver, Geoff Murphy, Tony Barry, Patrick Bleakley, Ian Watkin and Mick Lieber, as well as many others, of which some had previously worked with Bruno in bands and others joined along the way. The original line up was Bruno Lawrence, Corben Simpson, Kemp Turirangi, Geoff Murphy, Alan Moon, Tony Littlejohn, Beaver, Eric Foley, and Chris Seresin. The great adventure and experience of Blerta finished in 1975, with the troupe embarking on one last tour.

Although Bruno Lawrence and Geoff Murphy were friends for many years, the two had a falling out five years prior to Lawrence&#x27;s death. They never reconciled, and Murphy was absent from Lawrence&#x27;s funeral.
