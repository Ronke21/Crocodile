<text>Châteauneuf-du-Pape (; ) is a commune in the Vaucluse department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region in Southeastern France. The village lies about to the east of the Rhône and north of the town of Avignon.

A ruined medieval castle sits above the village and dominates the landscape to the south. It was built in the 14th century for Pope John XXII, the second of the popes to reside in Avignon. None of the subsequent Avignon popes stayed in Châteauneuf but after the schism of 1378 the antipope Clement VII sought the security of the castle. With the departure of the popes the castle passed to the archbishop of Avignon, but it was too large and too expensive to maintain and was used as a source of stone for building work in the village. At the time of the Revolution the buildings were sold off and only the donjon was preserved. During the Second World War an attempt was made to demolish the donjon with dynamite by German soldiers but only the northern half was destroyed; the southern half remained intact.

Almost all the cultivable land is planted with grapevines. The commune is famous for the production of red wine classified as Châteauneuf-du-Pape Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée which is produced from grapes grown in the commune of Châteauneuf-du-Pape and in portions of four adjoining communes.

==Toponym==
The first mention of the village is in a Latin document from 1094 that uses the name &quot;Castro Novo&quot;. The term &quot;castrum&quot; or &quot;castro&quot; in the 11th century was used to denote a fortified village, rather than a castle (&quot;castellum&quot;). The current French name of &quot;Châteauneuf&quot; (English: &quot;New Castle&quot;) is derived from this early Latin name and not from the ruined 14th-century castle that towers above the village. Just over a century later in 1213 the village was referred to as &quot;Castronovum Calcernarium&quot;. Other early documents use &quot;Castronovo Caussornerio&quot; or &quot;Castrum Novum Casanerii&quot;. The official French name became Châteauneuf Calcernier. The word &#x27;Calcernier&#x27; comes from the presence of important lime kilns in the village. &quot;Calcernarium&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;calx&quot; for lime and &quot;cernere&quot; means sift or sieve. From the 16th century the village was often referred to as &quot;Châteauneuf du Pape&quot; or &quot;Châteauneuf Calcernier dit de Pape&quot;, because of the connection with Pope John XXII, but it was not until 1893 that the official name was changed from &quot;Châteauneuf Calcernier&quot; to &quot;Châteauneuf-du-Pape&quot;. The name in the Provençal dialect of the Occitan language that was spoken in the village is &quot;Castèu-Nòu-De-Papo&quot;.

==History==

===Early settlement===

The earliest settlement is believed to have been near the Chapel Saint-Théodoric, to the east of the current village center. This Romanesque chapel was erected by the monks of the abbey of Saint-Théodoric in Avignon at the end of the 10th or the beginning of the 11th century and is the oldest building in the &quot;commune&quot;. Although the village lay within the Comtat Venaissin, it was one of the fiefs of the bishop of Avignon and thus had a special status. The bishop of Avignon also held the fiefs of Gigognan and Bédarrides.

In the second half of the 11th century a fortified village was built higher up the hill by the Viscount Rostaing Béranger in the fiefdom of his brother, the bishop of Avignon. The wall of the present church building formed part of the fortification and the arrowslits in the clock tower are still visible. Two towers and other vestiges of these early fortifications have survived. The new village would have contained a suitable fortified residence for the bishop which is believed to have been located between the church and the site of the later castle.

In 1238 the bishop of Avignon obtained an important privilege from the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II (r. 1195–1250). Salt that was shipped on the Rhône and landed at Châteauneuf would not be subject to tax. As a result, the trade in salt became a considerable source of revenue for the village.

===Avignon popes===
Bertrand de Got, archbishop of Bordeaux, was elected pope in 1305, and took the name of Clement V. He transferred the papacy to Avignon from Rome in 1309. The register of pontifical letters reveals that Clement V visited Châteauneuf on several occasions, sometimes for long periods. While in the village he would have been a guest at the bishop&#x27;s residence. In 1312 he stayed in the village from 6–22 November. In 1313 he returned from 9 May to 1 July and again from 19 October to 4 December. The following year, 1314, he was in Châteauneuf from 24–30 March. He died in the castle of Roquemaure on the opposite bank of the Rhône on 7 April 1314.

The next pope, Jacques Duèze, was elected in 1316 and took the name John XXII. After his coronation in Lyon on 5 September 1316, he travelled down the Rhône and spent 10 days in Châteauneuf before he arrived in Avignon. He had served as the bishop of Avignon between 1310 and 1313 and while bishop had also been the seigneur of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. He had arranged for his nephew Jacques de Via to succeed him as bishop. But on the death of his nephew in 1317 he chose not to appoint a successor, so during his papacy the village belonged directly to the pope. John XXII initiated a large number of building projects, including additions to the Palais des Papes in Avignon as well as defensive castles at Barbentane, Bédarrides, Noves and Sorgues. In 1317, work began on the construction of the castle in Châteauneuf-du-Pape. John XXII derived little benefit from the new castle, which was not completed until 1333, a year before his death. The ruins of the castle are now a prominent feature of the village.

There is no record of the next Avignon pope, Benedict XII (1334–1342) having ever stayed in this castle, but in 1335 he granted the village the right to have a ship mill on the Rhône, a market every Tuesday and two fairs during the year. He did not keep the post of bishop of Avignon and appointed a new bishop to replace himself in 1336. None of the following four popes stayed in Châteauneuf-du-Pape either, but after the schism of the Catholic Church in 1378, the Avignon antipope Clement VII frequently sought the security of the castle and from 1385 to 1387 had improvements carried out on the building.

In the 14th century the presence of the pope in Avignon and construction of the castle brought considerable prosperity to the village. The economy was based on agriculture, but the villagers also possessed lime kilns and the local merchants supplied roof tiles for the Palais des Papes in Avignon and floor tiles for the castle being built in Barbentane. The village outgrew the mid-11th century defensive walls and houses began to be built outside. In 1381 the village obtained permission to impose a local tax to fund the construction of a new system of fortifications around the village. These defensive towers have all disappeared except for the Portalet tower in the Rue des Papes, but parts of the walls remain.

==Pope John XXII&#x27;s castle==
===Construction===
In 1317, one year after his election, Pope John XXII ordered the construction of a castle at the top of the hill above the village. Some of the stone may have been from a local quarry but most was probably imported from Courthézon. The mortar and the roof tiles would have been manufactured in the village. To provide water, between August 1318 and July 1319, a large deep well was dug in the courtyard to the northeast of the donjon. According to the papal accounts, much of the work was completed by 1322, but in 1332 there is an entry for the purchase of timber from Liguria for four towers. The castle not only had a defensive role, but was also designed to serve as a summer residence. There was a garden on the west side and a 10 hectare park to the north enclosed by high walls in which vines, olive trees and fruit trees were cultivated.

===Neglect===
With the departure of the popes the castle became part of the fief of the bishop and, after 1475, the archbishop of Avignon, but it was much too big and expensive for them to maintain. The captain in charge of the village&#x27;s defences lived in the castle but there was no permanent garrison, and most of the buildings were allowed to deteriorate. In the 16th century Huguenots occupied Châteauneuf for several months during the Wars of Religion. In March 1563, they pillaged the village and set fire to the church and parts of the castle including the apartments of the pope. The extent of the damage is not known.

During the 17th century, and perhaps earlier, the ruined buildings of the castle were used as a source of stone for the construction of houses in the village. The community also used the stone to repair the walls around the village (18 to 20 cartloads in 1717) and to repair the church in 1781. At the time of the Revolution the castle had not been inhabited for a number of years. The buildings and the adjoining parkland were put up for sale and bought in July 1797 by Jean-Baptiste Establet, a farmer in the village. The following year, these were resold in 33 equal parts. By 1848 most of the castle had been destroyed by the purchasers. The mayor forbade the destruction of the donjon and in May 1892 the castle was listed as one of the French Historical Monuments. During the Second World War, the donjon was used as an observation post by German soldiers. In August 1944, just before their departure, they attempted to demolish the building with dynamite but by chance, only the northern half of the tower was destroyed, leaving the southern half as it appears today. In the 1960s the municipality constructed a meeting hall within the ancient ruined cellar of the castle.

===Buildings===

There are no surviving plans of the castle from the 14th century. The earliest depiction is an anonymous drawing from the Album Laincel in the collection of the Musée Calvet in Avignon that dates from the second half of the 17th century. By this time the castle had not been properly maintained for three centuries and the drawing is probably an interpretation by the artist of the surviving structure. Another source of information is a plan of the village from the 1813 cadastre which indicates the position of some of the buildings but not their original function. The appearance of the donjon before its destruction in 1944 is known from old photographs.

The main entrance to the castle was just above the village and consisted of two successive gatehouses. The first was on the path up from the church and the second was just to the east of the donjon. The vulnerable north side of the castle would have been protected by a deep ditch. The northern entrance was defended by a tower and was probably accessed by a drawbridge. Very little is known about the buildings of the castle other than the ruined donjon and papal apartments. The castle contained a chapel dedicated to Saint Catherine but the location is uncertain. The donjon had a ground floor with a low barrel vaulted ceiling and two upper levels with rib vaulted ceilings. The large roof terrace was surrounded by a machicolated battlement. The floors were connected by a stone staircase built into the thickness of the western wall. The entrance to the tower on the east side was protected by an unusually tall bretèche. A similar bretèche survives above the entrance to the Tour Philippe-le-Bel in Villeneuve-lès-Avignon.

The two large ruined walls to the west of the donjon formed part of a rectangular building reserved for the pope and his close associates. The large ground-floor room was 26 m in length, 9 m in width and 5.5 m in height. The ceiling was supported by wooden beams with three central columns. The floor was paved with large stone slabs. This room, together with a smaller room to the north, were probably used for storage. On the first floor was the great hall of the castle in which banquets would have been held. It had the same dimensions as the ground floor storeroom but with a higher ceiling (6.5 m). It was lit by four large rectangular windows providing views over the Rhône valley. There were also three smaller windows to increase the ventilation, two facing west and one facing south. The walls were decorated with frescoes and a band of large red, bistre and black roses. A door at the north end of the hall opened into a well-lit smaller room with a chimney. The main entrance to the hall was on the east side near the donjon and close to the modern steps. The top floor of the building was lit by three large windows provided with benches and three smaller rectangular windows. The irregular pattern of the windows suggests that there were several rooms, perhaps apartments for the pope. The tiled roof with two equal slopes was entirely protected by the large outer walls.

===Tiles===
An archaeological excavation carried out in 1960 in the basement of the ruined rectangular building recovered a number of small glazed terracotta floor tiles. They date from the first half of the 14th century and would have originally decorated the main hall on the first floor. The tiles are square, 125–130 mm on a side and 20 mm in thickness. They are decorated in a Hispano-Moresque style which is more usually associated with dishes and jugs. Many have a plain coloured glaze, either green, yellow or occasionally black but some have designs in brown or green on a white tin glazed background. The tiles are similar to those discovered in 1963 on the floor of Pope Benedict XII&#x27;s &quot;studium&quot; in the Palais des Papes. The room was built between 1334 and 1342 and is therefore a little later. The Châteuneuf tiles are slightly larger and often have animal designs. They were almost certainly manufactured in Saint-Quentin-la-Poterie. The papal accounts record large purchases of tiles in 1317.

In 1994, a small archaeological excavation was carried out on the terrace at the foot of the southern façade of the papal quarters. Altogether fifty tiles were recovered that had been scattered in the modern landfill. At the same time, a survey was conducted in the village to locate tiles held in private collections. A hundred more tiles were identified that had been collected by local people in the 19th and 20th centuries. These new finds enlarged the established iconography and provided more precise information on how the tiles were made.

==Parish church==

The parish church is now called &quot;Notre-Dame-de-l&#x27;Assomption&quot; but over the centuries it has been &quot;Notre-Dame&quot; (1321), &quot;Saint-Théodoric&quot; (1504), &quot;Bienheureuse-Vierge-Marie et Saint-Théodoric&quot; (1601), &quot;Bienheureuse-Vierge-Marie-del&#x27;Assomption&quot; (1626) and &quot;Saint-Théodoric&quot; (1707).
The church probably dates from the end of the 11th century when the village was first fortified. It certainly existed in 1155 when a papal bull issued by Adrian IV confirmed that bishop of Avignon possessed &quot;Châteauneuf Calcernier with its churches&quot;. Almost nothing survives of the original Romanesque church. It was rectangular in plan with the entrance at the western end. The square tower at the southeast corner which now serves as the bell tower was not part of the early church but formed part of the fortifications of the village. It later housed the municipal archives and in the 16th century supported a clock. The round tower at the northeast corner of the church was also part of the village fortifications but later served as a bell tower. In 1321 Pope John XXII paid for the construction of a side chapel, dedicated to Saint Martin, on the south side of the nave abutting the square tower. A second chapel, dedicated to Saint Anne, was constructed in the 16th century near the Saint Martin chapel.

At the end of the 18th century, the church was in a bad state of repair and had become too small for the village. Beginning in 1783 the church was extended towards the west and the entrance moved to the south wall. New windows were also created in the south wall of the nave.

In 1835 the square tower was converted into the existing bell tower. In the 19th century, before the arrival of phylloxera, the village was very prosperous. Between 1853 and 1859 it paid for a major enlargement of the church in which side aisles were created either side of the nave. The chapels of Saint-Anne and Saint-Martin were demolished to create the southern aisle. To build the northern aisle, the commune bought land and a house on the other side of the Rue Ancienne Ville and displaced the street to the north.

In 1981 the church was restored and the plaster on the interior walls was removed.

==Château de Lhers==

The ruined castle of Lhers sits on a limestone outcrop, west of the village of Châteauneuf-du-Pape on the left bank of the Rhône. Up to the 18th century there was a village of Lhers associated with this castle. It is mentioned (as &quot;Leris&quot;) for the first time in a document dated 913 in which
Louis the Blind, Count of Provence, gave the castle, one (or two) churches, a port on the Rhône and the land of the parish, to Fouquier, the bishop of Avignon. In 916, Bishop Fouquier gave the churches, the port and the parish to the churches of Notre-Dame and Saint-Étienne in Avignon. Neither the castle nor the income from the tolls collected from boats using the Rhône are mentioned in this document.

The plan of the castle is approximately square (25 m x 23 m), with a round tower at the southeast corner and a square tower at the northwest corner. The north side of the outcrop drops away vertically so there was no need for a defensive wall. A deep well is in the northeast corner. A drawing by the Jesuit architect Étienne Martellange shows the appearance of the castle in 1616. The architecture of the square tower suggests that it was built after the end of the 12th century. Only the ground floor survives. The round tower is later and was probably built in the 14th century. The surviving ruins therefore do not date from the 10th century when the castle is first mentioned in written records. The limestone blocks of the earlier castle were no doubt reused to construct the actual castle.
The Rhône was liable to violent floods and the river would change position or bifurcate, creating and destroying islands. The number and the position of the islands varied over the centuries which led to a series of boundary disputes between the communities of Lhers and Châteauneuf. In the Cassini map of France, dating from the last third of the 18th century, the castle is shown sitting on an island. At the time of the Revolution, the fief of Lhers included land joined to the right bank near Roquemaure, an island near the left bank separated by a small branch of the river, another island in the middle of the Rhône on which sat the castle, several gravel banks and a farm on land that was contiguous with Châteauneuf. The land of the fief was initially considered to be part of the commune of Roquemaure, but in 1820 the castle and the land were transferred to the commune of Châteauneuf-du-Pape. In 1992 the castle was listed as one of the French historical monuments. It is privately owned.

Almost nothing survives of the two churches mentioned in the early documents. The church of Sainte-Marie was destroyed during the Revolution. The ruins were visible until the canalization of the Rhône in the 1970s. The other church, dedicated to the Saints Cosmas and Damian, was probably the earlier of the two. It is mentioned in a papal bull issued in 1138 by Pope Adrian IV that confirmed that the bishop of Avignon possessed the fief of Lhers. The church is mentioned again in another document from 1560.

==Wine==
Although viticulture must have existed in the village well before the arrival of the popes, nothing is known about it. The &quot;Introitus et Exitus&quot;, the financial record of the Papal Treasury, shows regular purchases of small quantities of wine from the village. At the time, wine was difficult to transport and difficult to conserve so most was drunk locally when less than a year old. Wine production expanded in the 18th century with the rapid development of the wine trade. From the correspondence of the Tulle family who owned the vineyards of the La Nerthe estate, we learn that the 40 hectolitres of wine produced was exported to England, Italy, Germany and all over France. In 1923, the local wine producers led by the lawyer Pierre Le Roy de Boiseaumarié began a campaign to establish legal protection for the wine from the commune. The delimited area and the method of wine production were awarded legal recognition in 1933. Small changes to the initial regulations were made in 1936 and 1966.

The wine classified as Châteauneuf-du-Pape &quot;Appellation d&#x27;origine contrôlée&quot; (AOC) is produced from grapes grown in the commune of Châteauneuf-du-Pape and portions of the four adjoining communes in the Vaucluse. The vineyards cover an area of approximately 3,200 hectares. Of this total 1,659 hectares (52%) lie within the commune of Châteauneuf, 674 hectares (21.1%) within Courthézon, 391 hectares (12.3%) within Orange, 335 hectares (10.5%) within Bédarrides and remaining 129 hectares (4%) in Sorgues. Unlike its northern Rhône neighbours, Châteauneuf-du-Pape AOC permits thirteen different varieties of grape in red wine but the blend must be predominantly grenache. In 2010 there were 320 producers. The total annual production is around 100,000 hectolitres (equivalent to 13 million bottles of 0.75 litre) of which 95% is red. The remainder is white: the production of rosé is not permitted under this AOC.

==Population==
The earliest figure for the population of the village is from the census of 1344, which recorded 508 dwellings or &quot;hearths&quot;. As there were typically 4.5 inhabitants per dwelling, this represented around 2,000 inhabitants, a very large village for the time. The figure was not surpassed until the 20th century. After 1344 there are no further records until 1500, when the population was 1,600. In the 17th century there were several epidemics of bubonic plague and by 1694 the population had dropped to 558. During the 18th century the population of the village doubled, reaching 1,471 in 1866, but when the phylloxera devastated the vineyards the population dropped by a quarter to 1,095 in 1891. The population was 2,179 in 2012.

==Climate==
Châteauneuf-du-Pape has a humid subtropical climate &quot;Cfa&quot; in the Köppen climate classification, with moderate rainfall year-round. July and August are the hottest months with average daily maximum temperatures of around . The driest month is July when the average monthly rainfall is 37 millimeters, just a little too wet for the climate to be classified as Mediterranean (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;). The village is often subject to a strong wind, the mistral, that blows from the north.
==Schools==
There are two state schools in the commune. The nursery school, École maternelle Jean Macé, is attended by around 68 children between the ages of three and six. The primary school, École primaire Albert Camusis attended by around 137 children between the ages of six and eleven. After the age of eleven most children attend the Collège Saint Exupéry in Bédarrides.

<text>JBK or Jansen Barbieri Karn, is the name by which former Japan and Rain Tree Crow band members Steve Jansen, Richard Barbieri and Mick Karn recorded several albums of music, all released by their own Medium Productions label, between 1993 and 2001.

After the band project Rain Tree Crow was disbanded in 1991, the remaining three members decided to create a recording label so they could continue to creatively collaborate as well with other artists, without any pressure from record companies. Also without a principal songwriter, like David Sylvian, they had the freedom to express their ideas and experiment. The band&#x27;s music style was an experimental, ambient, progressive art rock with influence of electronic music. In their studio and live recordings JBK also collaborated with Porcupine Tree frontman Steven Wilson, fellow ex-Japan member Rob Dean, guitarists Aziz Ibrahim, David Torn, Sugizo, Masami Tsuchiya, saxophonist Theo Travis, and vocalists Zoe Niblett, Robby Aceto among others.

<text>Tu-Plang (ตู้เพลง Thai for &quot;Jukebox&quot;) is the debut studio album released by Australian rock band Regurgitator. After making two EPs, the band chose to record the album in Bangkok, Thailand, to the quandary of its label, Warner Music, which was uncertain as to what terms A&amp;R executive Michael Parisi had contracted. Ely later said, &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to do it in just any old place, so we had a tour in Europe and Japan booked and our drummer Martin said, &#x27;let&#x27;s stop in Thailand on the way and check out some studios,&#x27; so we did and we found this place.&quot;

Producer Magoo later said the studio, &quot;was [owned by] this guy [who was in the band] Carabao. He was described to us as the local, Thai, Bruce Springsteen. He had this compound in outer Bangkok. We&#x27;d drive there and it&#x27;s in the middle of all these slums. There were wild chickens running around everywhere. There were open sewers and stuff like that.&quot;

At the ARIA Music Awards of 1996, the album won two awards; Best Alternative Album and Breakthrough Artist - Album.

In 2012, Regurgitator performed the entire album along with &quot;Unit&quot; on the Australian RetroTech tour.

==Reception==

&quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; described the album as, &quot;an album that leapt from rock to rap, from fun to funk, from thrash to surf rock (a la Dick Dale), and it did nothing less than announce the arrival of the most significant band in Australia today. More successfully than any of their peers, Regurgitator showed they were committed to pushing the boundaries of contemporary music through their marriage of technology and pop.&quot; &quot;The Age&quot; said the album &quot;at times resembles a net surfer&#x27;s wet dream, skipping from one style to another, sometimes mid-song,&quot; and noted Yeomans&#x27; sardonic lyrics. They later voted &quot;Tu-Plang&quot; as one of the greatest albums from the first 50 years of Australian music.

Less flatteringly, AllMusic said the album was, &quot;an utterly misbegotten funk-rap-metal fusion which, much as the band&#x27;s name implies, offers merely another rehash of the usual genre fare.&quot; The song &quot;Pop Porn&quot; was singled out for being, &quot;so overboard in attacking rap misogyny that it reaches levels of offensiveness beyond anything actually in the true hip-hop canon.&quot;

==Track information==
* &quot;G7 Dick Electro Boogie&quot; contains samples of street sounds in Bangkok. Yeomans later said, &quot;I think this song[&#x27;]s small claim to fame is attributed to the &#x27;gang-rape a cripple&#x27; line nicely taken out of context by a few bored conservative factions floating around at the time.&quot;
* Track 4 is a Muzak version of &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Do It&quot; off the band&#x27;s first self-titled EP.
* &quot;Blubber Boy&quot; is an up-tempo version of &quot;Blubber Boy&quot; off the band&#x27;s second EP, &quot;New&quot;.

<doc id="906675" wikidata="Q727687" url="?curid=906675" title="Swimming at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's 100 metre freestyle">
<text>The men&#x27;s 100 metre freestyle event at the 2004 Summer Olympics was contested at the Olympic Aquatic Centre of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex in Athens, Greece on August 17 and 18. There were 69 competitors from 62 nations. Nations had been limited to two swimmers each since the 1984 Games.

==Summary==

Dutch swimmer Pieter van den Hoogenband defended his Olympic title in the event (the fourth man to do so), outside the record time of 48.17. Roland Mark Schoeman, who solidified South Africa&#x27;s triumph to break a world record in the 400 m freestyle relay, took home the silver in 48.23. It was South Africa&#x27;s first medal in the event. Australia&#x27;s Ian Thorpe edged out Schoeman&#x27;s teammate Ryk Neethling to clinch a bronze medal by 0.07 of a second, in his personal best of 48.56. Australia had not earned a medal in the men&#x27;s 100 metre freestyle since 1984. Thorpe was the first man to win medals in the 100, 200, and 400 metre freestyle races in a single Olympics.

Two-time Olympic champion Alexander Popov finished only in ninth place by just two hundredths of a second (0.02) outside the top 8 field from the semifinals (49.23). By the following year, Popov announced his retirement from swimming, and became a full-time member of the International Olympic Committee. Other notable swimmers who missed the final cut featured France&#x27;s Frédérick Bousquet, Lithuania&#x27;s Rolandas Gimbutis, Trinidad and Tobago&#x27;s George Bovell, and U.S. duo Jason Lezak and Ian Crocker. This became the first 100m freestyle where not a single American qualified for the semifinals.

==Background==

This was the twenty-fourth appearance of the men&#x27;s 100 metre freestyle. The event has been held at every Summer Olympics except 1900 (when the shortest freestyle was the 200 metres), though the 1904 version was measured in yards rather than metres.

Two of the eight finalists from the 2000 Games returned: gold medalist Pieter van den Hoogenband of the Netherlands and silver medalist (and 1992 and 1996 gold medalist) Alexander Popov of Russia. Van den Hoogenband had placed second at the last two world championships, behind American Anthony Ervin (who had retired in 2003 at age 22) in 2001 and Popov in 2003. Ian Thorpe of Australia, primarily a middle-distance swimmer who had not competed in the 100 in 2000 when he won five gold medals, had shown ability in sprinting by placing third in the 2003 world championship.

Azerbaijan, Burundi, Guyana, Iraq, Latvia, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, and Serbia and Montenegro each made their debut in the event. The United States made its 23rd appearance, most of any nation, having missed only the boycotted 1980 Games.

==Competition format==

This freestyle swimming competition consisted of three rounds: heats, semifinals, and a final. The swimmers with the best 16 times in the heats advanced to the semifinals. The swimmers with the best 8 times in the semifinals advanced to the final. Swim-offs were used as necessary to break ties for advancement to the next round.

==Records==

Prior to this competition, the existing world and Olympic records were as follows.

== History ==
=== Middle Ages ===
The region of the Lüneburg Heath had already been settled by the start of the New Stone Age about 4,000 years ago. The Soltau area was initially occupied by a few individual farms. The parish of Soltau was probably founded around 830 and the first wooden church &quot;Sante Johannis Baptista&quot; (St. John the Baptist) was built.

The first written record of Soltau was in the year 936 as &quot;Curtis Salta&quot; (&quot;farm on the salt meadow&quot;). King Otto the Great granted the estate to Quedlinburg Abbey. Within a span of almost 600 years the village of &quot;Soltouwe&quot; emerged from &quot;Curtis Salta&quot;. It was located in the area between St. John&#x27;s Church and the Waldmühle mill.

In 1304 the &quot;Vogtei&quot; of Soltau was sold to the cathedral chapter of Verden. Between 1383 and 1388 the village was established by order of the duke as protection against robber barons at the confluence of the rivers Böhme and Soltau near Hagen and Burg, which today is in the town centre. Subsequently, it was decided to demolish the castle there as part of the peace treaty at the end of the Lüneburg War of Succession; at the same time Soltau was given town rights on 15 July 1388 by way of compensation. In 1400 the letters patent for the guild was issued, which entitled the town to trade. In 1440 another letters patent was specifically conferred on blacksmiths, tailors, cobblers, linen and cloth-makers.

The consequences of the war of succession in Soltau can clearly be traced and prevented the rapid growth of the new town; conditions were miserable and many farms were ruined. Moreover, Soltau was a long way from the centres of power, so did not receive much direct support and there were no local lords who felt an association with it.

In 1479 Soltau became part of the Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg and an &quot;Amtsvogtei&quot; was established. In 1511 the town was totally destroyed by fire.

The last known cavalry battle took place in June 1519 on the &#x27;Wiehe Holt&#x27; near Soltau and is known as the Battle of Soltau, which represented the high point of the Hildesheim Abbey Feud. According to long tradition it was only thanks to a ruse by the Soltau townsman, Harm Tyding, who pretended to the advancing Brunswick troops that he knew the whereabouts of a large Lüneburg army and led them on a detour, that the town was not destroyed again.

The Reformation saw little conflict in Soltau as a result of the firm stand taken by the Lüneburg duke, Ernest I and his commitment to introducing the Protestant-Lutheran faith in 1527.

=== Modern era ===
In 1533 the town hall was established in an old chapel in &quot;Marktstraße&quot; but it was destroyed in a fire. In 1567 another great fire destroyed large parts of the town. In 1588 the first school building was erected, although the first records of school teaching go back to as early as 1563. The plague raged in 1626 and the population dwindled dramatically. Before 1620 there were several years of legal disputes about the acquisition of building land outside the town wall.

In the Thirty Years&#x27; War Soltau was once again entirely destroyed. All that remained was a great ruin in the landscape and only one building from that time remains. It was a long time before the town recovered from the war&#x27;s consequences. The traces of the war and the area&#x27;s occupation by Swedish troops, which began in 1632, is still documented today by the &quot;Ellinger Grenzstein&quot; (&quot;Ellingen Boundary Stone&quot;).

Market rights and therefore the right to host two fairs a year and a horse market were conferred in 1668. The Old Town Pharmacy (&quot;Alte Stadtapotheke&quot;) was opened in 1796, the first chemist in Soltau.

Soltau first became a garrison town in 1712, a year when the first cloth factory was built.
Napoleonic troops occupied the town in 1803 and turned it into a French border town for the Kingdom of Westphalia in 1810. Soltau belonged to the Canton of Harburg in the Department of Bouches-de-l&#x27;Elbe. In 1813 the Lützow infantry and cossacks ended ten years of occupation. In 1826 the Old Town Hall (&quot;Altes Rathaus&quot;) was built on &quot;Poststraße&quot;.

In 1873 the first railway through Soltau was opened, the line which linked Bremen and Berlin. It was followed in 1901 by the Heath Railway between Hamburg and Hanover and, in 1912, the lines of the East Hanoverian Railways to Celle and Lüneburg. In 1885 Soltau became a district town (&quot;Kreisstadt&quot;). In 1896 the gas works was built and, two years later, the gymnasium and shooting hall.

On Christmas Eve 1906 a fire destroyed St. John&#x27;s Church which had been mentioned in the records since 1464. It was then rebuilt and is still standing today. In 1911 the Lutheran Church was consecrated, the second Protestant church to be founded, and in 1915 the Catholic Church of St. Mary&#x27;s followed. A royal officers&#x27; riding school was founded in 1913.

Soltau Camp (&quot;Lager Soltau&quot;), the largest German prisoner-of-war camp of the First World War was built in 1914. In the same year the mining of potassium salts (&quot;Kalisalz&quot;) began at the Heinrichssegen Shaft; it had to be halted only four years later as a result of the war, after having reached a depth of just six metres. From 1934 several Wehrmacht units were quartered at Wolterdingen Camp (&quot;Lager Wolterdingen&quot;) and after the end of the Second World War it was used to house refugees and forced labourers until about 1960. In April 1945, the town was partly destroyed by air raids, in which there were many more civilian victims than military ones.
That same month, prisoners from concentration camps were able to escape from a railway train that had been stopped in Soltau as the result of an Allied air attack. The prisoners were hunted down by members of the Wehrmacht, SS and Hitler Youth, with the help of several townsfolk, and 92 of them were shot dead. A few townspeople, by contrast, risked their own lives by providing the escapees with food and clothing. The post-war trials of those who took part ended in acquittals due to the lack of evidence. Consequently, all that could be recorded were several confirmed killings, but not murders.

=== Post WW-II ===
In 1949 Soltau became a British garrison during the Cold War and home of Headquarters 7th Armoured Brigade. They were based at the former SS Riding School on the outskirts of town (&quot;Reitschule&quot;). The base was the home of 207 Signal Squadron and 11 Ordnance Company. It was the most northerly posting for any British serviceman in BAOR (British Army of the Rhine), excluding minor outposts like Dannenberg, Hamburg and Kiel, in what was known as West Germany. Armoured vehicles were regularly seen on the streets on their way to the military training area at Lüneburg and the HQ was responsible for the nearby Soltau-Lüneburg Training Area and its associated hutted camp at Reinsehlen. The signal squadron had three troops, two of which were armoured, using variants of the FV432 for telecommunication purposes. The soldiers were given the freedom of the town on 18 September 1982, and again after returning from the first Gulf War in 1991. They marched through the town to mark the occasion.

The site of the British barracks was the first in Germany to be turned over to private hands in 1993, one year after the withdrawal of British troops. Today the old barracks is a business centre, used for doctors&#x27; practices and social institutions. It is also home to the &quot;Alte Reithalle&quot; (&quot;Old Riding Hall&quot;) Event Centre which has become an important indoor event location after its finished restoration in 2003.

In 1972 Soltau became a state-recognised spa and in 1987 was designated as a &quot;state-recognised town with brine cure facilities&quot;. In the administrative reforms of 1974 16 surrounding villages were incorporated into the new municipality. In 1977 the districts of Soltau and Fallingbostel merged into the district of Soltau-Fallingbostel; Soltau lost its status as the district administrative seat.

The Heide Park was opened in 1978; today it is the largest amusement park in North Germany. Other tourist attractions include the Soltau Thermal Baths, which opened in 1990 and the North German Toy Museum which followed in 1994. In 1988 the &quot;Showpalast&quot; (&quot;Show Palace&quot;) was founded at the Soltau secondary modern school (&quot;Hauptschule&quot;); it remains Germany&#x27;s only schoolchildren&#x27;s cabaret.

In 1998 a retail park opened in the Alm industrial estate. From 1996 there were discussions in Soltau about the construction of a outlet store. The town failed several times in the courts, the last time in 2006 at the Federal Administrative Court of Germany. Protests were led by the surrounding towns of Verden, Rotenburg and Lüneburg]. In 2006 proceedings were begun to obtain permission to deviate from a planning objective which would enable the construction of an outlet centre in spite of the latest rejection. With a change to the state regional development programme in 2008 the establishment of a factory outlet centre in the tourist region of the Lüneburg Heath was finally granted. For the purposes of the town of Soltau, the town of Bad Fallingbostel and the municipality of Bispingen regional proceedings were begun. In February 2009 this process was concluded by the supreme state planning department (State Ministry of Economics) producing a positive outcome for Soltau and a negative one for its two competitors. Construction was due to start in 2010 despite Bispingen launching an appeal. It 

On 20 October 2004 an earthquake shook the region. It had a strength 4.5 on the Richter Scale and its epicentre was in Neuenkirchen. There had been a previous earthquake of strength 4 with an epicentre in Soltau on 2 June 1977.

Since the beginning of 2005 there have been discussions about a memorial of eight representative steles from the Berlin Holocaust Memorial for &quot;all victims of the Nazi dictatorship&quot;. However an internet survey by the newspaper, the &quot;Böhme-Zeitung&quot; showed that a majority of those who responded were against the memorial. This caused a furore nationally and gave those in favour of a memorial reason to accuse the opponents of having Nazi sentiments. Nevertheless, plans to erect the monument in central locations such as immediately in front of the station could not be carried out. This monument appeared from autumn 2006 to March 2007 in the vicinity of the remote site of the killings in the forest of &quot;Sibirien&quot; (today a hospital stands on the exact spot). The massive opposition from long-time residents of Soltau is frequently put down by them to the lack of commemoration of the many civilian and military victims from their own ranks, because they are not obviously included in the memorial.

In March 2007 a concept for the transformation of the town centre was proposed. The Schaper Market, which had been built in the 1970s and lain empty since 2004, a footbridge (locally called the &quot;Fenner-Kringel&quot;) and a multi-storey car park were demolished in 2008 and the theatre moved to Hagen, so that a new building could be built with a total sales floor of about . The new shopping centre was opened in March 2009.

== Demographics ==

The oldest list of townsfolk in the town book of 1452 enumerates 42 households in Soltau, this represents a good 200 inhabitants based on the conditions of the time. Around 1600 there were about 100 households in Soltau, this corresponds to some 500 inhabitants who lived in about 70 houses. The black death raged in 1626 and caused the population to plummet dramatically. After that, the number of inhabitants rose slowly at first; accelerating from 1940. In 1821 Soltau had 1.024 inhabitants. The large increase in 1974 is due to the regional reform and the incorporation of 16 surrounding villages. Following a short drop in the numbers the population grew again in the 1990s and reached its maximum in 2005 at 22,044. According to internal censuses the town has even greater numbers, e.g. in 2001 23,508, but this is mainly due to the inclusion of those with second homes. Since then the numbers have dropped slowly. This trend should stop in the next few years according to a study by the Bertelsmann Foundation. For 2025

<doc id="906684" wikidata="Q221088" url="?curid=906684" title="Guadalupe fur seal">
<text>The Guadalupe fur seal (Arctocephalus townsendi) is one of eight members of the fur seal genus &quot;Arctocephalus&quot;. They are the northernmost member of this genus. Sealers reduced the population to just a few dozen by the late 19th century, but the species had recovered to 10,000 in number by the late 1990s. Many individuals can be found on Mexico&#x27;s Guadalupe Island.

==Description==
Adult Guadalupe fur seals are dark brown or dusty gray with yellowish silver manes, called guard hairs, on the back of the neck. Guadalupe fur seals are sexually dimorphic in size, as males are much larger and heavier than females; males can grow to about seven feet in length and weigh upwards of 400 pounds, while females are typically only five feet long and weigh about 110 pounds. Additionally, males usually have a larger head and are lighter brown in color. Both males and females have a twenty-year lifespan. Guadalupe fur seals have distinctive ear flaps and large flippers for walking on land, confirming that they are not phocids (true seals) but are more closely related to sea lions. Guadalupe fur seal pups are born with black coats similar to those of adult Guadalupe fur seals, but it is difficult to distinguish juvenile Guadalupe fur seals from juveniles of California sea lions and Northern fur seals due to physiological similarities.

==Distribution and habitat==
Guadalupe fur seals breed along the eastern coast of Guadalupe Island, approximately 200 km west of Baja California. In addition, individuals have been sighted in the southern California Channel Islands, including two males who established territories on San Nicolas Island. Stray seals have been found as far north as Oregon.

Guadalupe fur seals were known to reside in Baja California, Mexico and Southern California but were heavily hunted in the 19th century and were believed to be extinct. However, the animals were found on Isla Guadalupe, Baja California in a cave in 1954; this is now the only place of Guadalupe fur seal reproduction. In 2013, the population of Guadalupe fur seals was estimated to be between 34,000 and 44,000, around one-fifth of the estimated historical population size.

== Feeding ==
Guadalupe fur seals are a pelagic species that spend most of their time on the open ocean. Thus, they dive to catch food and forage for about two weeks before returning to land to feed. Guadalupe fur seals commonly hunt in shallow water (maximum depth of ) and catch squid, mackerels, and lanternfish. They feed exclusively at night.

== Behavior ==
Guadalupe fur seals create caves on land which can causes social pressures amongst the individuals. The seals that do not breed often play with each other by barking, lunging at each other, and pushing each other into the water. Other behaviors of the animal consist of waving their hind flippers in the water whist face down in the water. Additionally, when interacting with humans, these seals are not typically aggressive. They are often seen with their heads under the water and pay little attention to the observer.

==Breeding==
Observations suggest that males of reproducing age claim particular sites for a number of years, though territorial fights are uncommon amongst males once regions have been taken. Tenure of territorial males lasts from 35 to 122 days. Males mate with up to twelve females during mating season, and births occur from mid-June through mid-July, though most births take place in June. After birth, females nurse their pups for 8–10 days. In the nine months following the birth, females alternate between spending 9–13 days foraging food for and spending 5–6 days nursing pups. After this period, the pups are considered adults and are on their own. Mothers and pups recognize each other by unique noises and smells.

==Impacts on Guadalupe fur seals==
The major cause of the Guadalupe fur seal&#x27;s decline was commercial hunting in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The species was exterminated in southern California waters by 1825. Commercial sealing continued in Mexican waters through 1894.

==Conservation and recovery efforts==
The species is listed as Threatened by the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service under the Endangered Species Act. The principal cause of the decline in Guadalupe fur seals was commercial sealing. The species is now protected from such activity throughout its range, and the magnitude of the threat to the species is considered to be low. The portion of the Guadalupe fur seal&#x27;s range which is under U.S. jurisdiction is at the limit of the species range. No activities in areas under U.S. jurisdiction are known to be adversely affecting recovery of this species now. Therefore, management activities in the U.S. portion of its range are not likely to contribute substantially to recovery. However, Guadalupe fur seals are protected from federal actions that are likely to jeopardize the species through interagency coordination under Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act. No other specific actions necessary for the recovery of the species have been identified, and no direct recovery actions are being implemented.

In Mexico, the Guadalupe fur seal, where the seal was discovered after being believed to be extinct, is protected in the Guadalupe Island Biosphere Reserve.

<doc id="906687" wikidata="Q1773525" url="?curid=906687" title="Krag–Petersson">
<text>The Krag–Petersson was the first repeating rifle adopted by the armed forces of Norway and was one of the first repeating rifles to be adopted as standard issue by a military force, being preceded by the Swiss Vetterli adopted in 1867. Developed by Ole Herman Johannes Krag, the action of the Krag–Petersson was uniquely actuated by an oversized hammer. Another distinguishing feature was that the cartridge rising from the magazine was not seated automatically, but had to be pushed into the breech of the rifle.

Testing by the Norwegian military revealed the Krag–Petersson was a robust, accurate and quick-firing weapon, and the Royal Norwegian Navy adopted the rifle in 1876. The rifle was extensively tested by other nations, but none adopted it. After being phased out around 1900, the remaining rifles were sold to civilians and often were extensively rebuilt. Today, it is so difficult to find one in original condition that the Krag–Petersson has been described as &quot;the rifle everybody has heard about, but hardly anybody has ever seen&quot;. It was the first rifle designed by Ole H. J. Krag to be adopted by an armed force.

==Design and development==

The mechanism was developed by Ole Herman Johannes Krag, with vital help from his friend Axel Petersson on the actuation of the mechanism. Ole H. J. Krag had been experimenting with repeating rifles for several years before he designed the Krag–Petersson rifle. His earlier models were actuated by a side-mounted lever working an interior crankshaft. Moving the lever in a half circle, counter-clockwise, made the breechblock – the part of the mechanism that seals the rear of the barrel – move back and down. The rearward movement of the breechblock automatically ejected the spent round and the downward movement allowed the magazine follower to push a new round into the breech. In 1871, Axel Petersson suggested changing the design to allow the hammer to operate the breechblock instead, thus making the mechanism both simpler and easier to operate. The Krag–Petersson, like Krag&#x27;s previous design, featured a tubular magazine under the barrel.
The action of the Krag–Petersson is, as seen in the photograph to the left, simple compared to modern rifles. It consists of eight components: the receiver (A), the hammer (B), the tilting breechblock (C), the firing pin (D), two pins to secure the hammer and breechblock (E and F), a lockplate with a screw to secure the pins (G) and the tubular magazine (not shown in the photograph).

The Krag–Petersson repeating rifle has a falling block action, &quot;i.e.&quot; the breechblock moves downwards as the mechanism is opened, actuated (operated) by the operation of the exterior hammer. The tubular magazine, containing a total of 10 rounds of ammunition, was placed under the barrel. Once the mechanism was open, an extractor ejected the spent cartridge. A fresh round of ammunition was pushed into a shaped recess on top of the falling block by the spring in the magazine, whereupon the falling block rose slightly. The round could then be pushed into the chamber by the shooter, and the breechblock would rise completely. This rising of the breechblock (by means of a powerful spring) could catch the shooter off guard, resulting in pinched skin on the thumb.

==Military trials==
In 1872, Krag presented his design to a Norwegian/Swedish Artillery Committee. Towards the end of 1872, this committee reported its findings. It was recommended that a refined model of the Krag–Petersson be tested further. These tests were undertaken in 1873 and 1874, with generally positive findings. The reports in particular praised the accuracy of the rifle, the rate of fire and the fact that the ejector worked without fail. The reason for the last praise was that the ejector on the Remington M1867 – the standard rifle in the Norwegian Army – often did not eject the empty cartridge when the rifle had been fired for a while.

During development, it was found that the rifle was not only solidly designed and well engineered, but it was also capable of firing 18 to 19 aimed shots a minute when used as a single loader – faster than the standard Remington M1867&#x27;s 13 aimed shots per minute. When used as a magazine loader, it was found that 11 shots – ten in the magazine and one in the chamber – could be fired in 25 seconds. Tests carried out during the evaluation also indicated that the rifle was more accurate than the Remington M1867, although both weapons were firing the same ammunition from identical barrels. The rifle was also found to be extremely rugged – one of the tests carried out consisted of throwing the rifle repeatedly from a height of towards a rocky surface in order to see if any of the rounds in the magazine would go off. Even modern firearms would be damaged by this treatment, but the Krag–Petersson survived it with only superficial damage to the woodwork.

After the tests were concluded, the committee recommended several Krag–Petersson rifles be manufactured and distributed to a selected army unit for troop trials. After careful consideration, 30 rifles were manufactured and issued to the King&#x27;s Guard for use on their annual exercises in 1875. These 30 rifles differ from the later rifles by being shorter. During the troop trials, roughly 500 rounds were fired from each rifle, or about 15,000 in total. The feedback on the rifles was excellent, comparing it most favourably to the standard Remington M1867 rifles. The function of the extractor was particularly praised in the official reports.

Despite this, the committee did not recommend the Krag–Petersson as a standard-issue weapon for the Norwegian and Swedish armies, primarily because the round it was designed around was considered to be obsolete. At the same time, the committee had already started testing the Jarmann M1884 bolt action rifle. However, the Royal Norwegian Navy decided to adopt it as their standard arm in 1876, pointing out that they still were using the old M1860 &quot;Kammerlader&quot; (&quot;chamber-loader&quot;) modified to fire the 4 &quot;linjer&quot; rimfire round. It was also clear that the Jarmann, if adopted, would first be issued to the Army, leaving the Navy without a modern arm for at least another decade.

==Deployment==
The initial order placed by the Royal Norwegian Navy for the Krag–Petersson was for 450 rifles, but the order was later amended to raise the total to 975. The weapon was ordered and delivered complete with the requisite equipment, such as a tampion, oil bottle and straps.

The weapon as approved for use was chambered for the 4 &quot;linjer&quot; rimfire ammunition already in use in the Remington M1867 rifles by Norwegian and Swedish armed forces, and apparently equipped with identical barrels to the Remington. While the ammunition was nominally 4 linjer, the calibre of the barrel was 3.88 linjer (12.17 mm or 0.479 in), while the uncoated lead bullet had a diameter of 4.021 linjer (12.62 mm or 0.497 in).

Since Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk – the main armoury in Norway – was manufacturing Remington M1867s for the Norwegian army, the Krag–Peterssons were manufactured partly by Carl Gustafs Stads Gevärsfaktori (serial numbers 1 through 200 and 301 through 700) in Sweden, and partly by Carl Johans Vern (serial numbers 201 through 300 and 701 through 975) in Norway. A handful (about 17) were manufactured at Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk, although these likely were development models and prototypes, since Krag was working there at the time.

==Bayonet for the Krag–Petersson==
A bayonet was issued for each rifle, and each was individually numbered to the rifle to which it belonged. The bayonet was a so-called sabre bayonet, with a yatagan (S-shaped) blade and a prominent fuller, a wooden grip and brass guard and pommel. By modern standards the bayonet was rather large, with a total length of , of which was the blade. Today, a bayonet in original condition is as hard to find as the Krag–Petersson itself, and it is often mistaken for a Remington M1867 bayonet. A well-preserved bayonet can fetch around $1,000 U.S. if it is in good condition.

The bayonet was almost identical to the bayonet issued with the Remington M1867, but was numbered on the guard as opposed to the blade itself. The available sources seems to indicate this was done because the bayonets were fitted to the rifles after the blade had been hardened, while the bayonets for the M1867 was fitted to the M1867 before the blade was hardened. The reason for this is that Kongsberg Våpenfabrikk manufactured the bayonets, and shipped them to Carl Johans Vern where they were fitted to the individual rifles.

==Evaluation in other countries==
The Krag–Petersson was one of the earliest repeating rifles in the world, and as such generated considerable interest in Europe and the rest of the world. It was tested by several countries, but despite good reports and much praise was not adopted by any other nation than Norway. Most probably, the main reason for this is that the rifle was designed around an outdated cartridge, and there was doubt that the action could be modified for more powerful ammunition.

In 1876, the Danish military tested two preproduction rifles delivered from Norway, and were impressed enough to manufacture slightly modified 115 Krag–Peterssons in 1877 for troop trials. Despite the good results, the Danes decided not to adopt the Krag–Petersson. Krag did not receive any royalties on the production in Denmark, but was later made a knight of the Order of the Dannebrog, as thanks for his efforts both with the Danish Krag–Peterssons and for his efforts with the Krag–Jørgensen the Danes adopted in 1889.

France also tested the Krag–Petersson, and adopted – without asking – the &quot;magazine regulator&quot; of the Krag–Petersson for their Kropatschek rifle. As a form of compensation, Krag was later made a knight of Légion d&#x27;honneur. Russia and Brazil tested the Krag–Petersson without adopting it, and Krag travelled Europe extensively to market the Krag–Petersson.

==Fate of the Krag–Petersson rifles==

The Krag–Petersson remained in use in the Royal Norwegian Navy for almost 25 years, alongside the Jarmann, and, from 1896, the Krag–Jørgensen. By 1900, they were considered obsolete and sold to civilians, many of whom rebuilt the rifles to centerfire and in a few cases to shotguns. The details of the sales are lacking, although it is known that in 1928 only 70 Krag–Peterssons remained in military warehouses. It is likely that these were considered unsellable and scrapped. Today the Krag–Petersson is very rare, and unaltered specimens can fetch high prices, from US$2,000.

As a curiosity, Roald Amundsen owned a Krag–Petersson with the serial number 168, probably bought from the Royal Norwegian Navy just after 1900. It is unclear if this rifle accompanied him on expeditions, but it is on display at the Fram museum in Oslo.

==Comparison with contemporary rifles==
The Krag–Petersson is often said to be a good rifle. By comparing it to the Remington M1867, which was the standard-issue rifle in the Norwegian Army, as well as against the standard service rifles of Germany, France and the United Kingdom at the time, it is quite clear that the Krag–Petersson suffered from having been designed for an outdated cartridge.

<text>The Light Aircraft Association (LAA) is the representative body in the United Kingdom for amateur aircraft construction, and recreational and sport flying. It oversees the construction and maintenance of homebuilt aircraft, under an approval from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA).

The LAA was formerly known as the Popular Flying Association and was originally founded in 1946 as the Ultralight Aircraft Association.

==LAA Permit regime==
The regime for approving amateur-built aircraft in the United Kingdom differs from that in many other countries, of which the United States is the prime example. Instead of the FAA&#x27;s Experimental airworthiness category, under which an amateur may design, build and operate (and is ultimately responsible for) an aircraft &#x27;for experimental purposes&#x27;, the UK CAA is required to investigate any such aircraft&#x27;s &#x27;fitness to fly&#x27; and to issue a &#x27;Permit to Fly&#x27; when satisfied. The LAA is approved by the CAA to make recommendations for and to revalidate such Permits. Aircraft on a LAA Permit may not be operated commercially and are limited to Day / VFR operation, unless approved for Night / IFR. There are also nominal limits on the number of seats (four) and on maximum take-off weight (2500 lbs), power (260HP) and stalling speed (70 mph). The Permit is valid only in UK airspace unless by agreement with another State, which is normally obtainable for countries in the European Union and many outside it. The Permit has to be renewed annually after the aircraft has been inspected by an inspector appointed by the LAA.
The LAA&#x27;s remit extends to homebuilt autogyros but not to helicopters. Factory-built classic and vintage aircraft that are no longer supported by their manufacturer have difficulty obtaining a Certificate of Airworthiness, and in such cases the CAA may transfer the type to LAA Permit.

The LAA&#x27;s remit includes amateur-built microlights but does not extend to factory-built microlights, which are covered by the BMAA. The BMAA&#x27;s remit substantially overlaps with that of the LAA; but occasional proposals for the merger of the two associations have met with considerable resistance, mainly from the BMAA&#x27;s majority membership of 2-axis microlight pilots.

==History==
Following a letter in the Flight by Risteard Mac Roibin an aircraft engineer who suggested that it should be possible to regulate ultra-light aircraft without the expense of a Certificate of Airworthiness, it would have to be a tested and approved design and be checked by a licensed aircraft engineer. The article led to the formation of the Ultra-Light Aircraft Association, with the first meeting being held on 26 October 1946. The first priority of the association was to convince the government that light aircraft did not need a Certificate of Airworthiness. The government agreed that the association could issue a Permit to Fly for aircraft not exceeding 1,000 lb in weight, maximum engine power of 40 hp and a landing speed of no more than 40 mph. The supervision during construction and final inspection would need to be done by ULAA inspectors.

The association took on the name Popular Flying Association in 1949. Initially, and still primarily, an engineering organisation for approving designs for homebuilding and regulating their construction and maintenance, it is now also active in encouraging sport and recreational flying and campaigning for a regulatory regime that will provide as little restriction as possible, consistent with safety, for the construction and operation of homebuilt aircraft and Classic and Vintage factory built aircraft that can no longer hold a full Certificate of Airworthiness. Membership in 2011 was around 8,000.

It publishes a monthly full-colour member magazine, &quot;Light Aviation&quot; (formerly &quot;Popular Flying&quot;) and holds its annual Rally at Sywell Aerodrome on the first weekend in September, probably the largest gathering of light aircraft outside the USA.

It has a network of Member Clubs (known as &quot;Struts&quot;) throughout the UK, each providing a geographically centred social focus for LAA members, to which members of the public are warmly welcomed. There are also a number of Type Clubs, catering to members who are constructing or operating certain aircraft types.

The Association changed its name to the Light Aircraft Association (LAA) on 1 January 2008, along with the magazine&#x27;s name being changed to &quot;Light Aviation&quot;

<text>Paul Matschie (11 August 1861, Brandenburg an der Havel – 7 March 1926, Friedenau) was a German zoologist.

He studied mathematics and natural sciences at the Universities of Halle and Berlin, afterwards working as an unpaid volunteer at the Berlin Zoological Museum under Jean Cabanis (1816–1906). In 1892, he was in charge of the department of mammals at the museum, later becoming a curator (1895), and in 1902, attaining the title of professor. In 1924, he was appointed second director at the museum.

During the years 1891–1893, he described 11 new species of reptiles. A species of gecko, &quot;Hemidactylus matschiei&quot; , is named in his honor. Matschie organized the fifth International Congress of Zoologists in Berlin and was for some years co-editor of the journal &quot;Natur und Haus&quot;.

Matschie&#x27;s tree-kangaroo (&quot;Dendrolagus matschiei&quot;) and Matschie&#x27;s galago (&quot;Galago matschiei&quot;) are two species of mammals which bear his name.

<doc id="906698" wikidata="Q1378679" url="?curid=906698" title="Player of the match">
<text>In team sport, a player of the match award (also known as man of the match or woman of the match) is often given to the most outstanding player in a particular match. This can be a player from either team, although the player is generally chosen from the winning team.

Some sports have unique traditions regarding these awards, and they are especially sought in championship or all-star games. In Australia, the term &quot;best on ground&quot; is normally used, both for individual games and season-long awards. In some competitions, particularly in North America, the terms &quot;most valuable player&quot; (MVP) or &quot;most outstanding player&quot; are used. In ice hockey in North America, three players of the game, called the &quot;three stars&quot;, are recognised.

In sports where playoffs are decided by series rather than individual games, such as professional basketball and baseball, MVP awards are commonly given for the series, and in ice hockey&#x27;s NHL, for performance in the entire playoffs.

==Association football==
In football, the &quot;man of the match&quot; (MOTM) award goes typically (but not necessarily) to a player on the winning side. Players who score a hat-trick, or goalkeepers who keep a clean sheet under pressure often get the award. Hat-trick scorers usually receive the match ball whether or not they are officially named player of the match.

The man of the match is often chosen by a television commentator or a sponsor. However, not all competitions have an official player of the match award, so sometimes accolades are given by websites or newspapers instead. In the Premier League, for example, a player receives a small black and gold trophy for their player of the match performance.

When given informally (for example, by a columnist), the MOTM may be &quot;awarded&quot; sardonically, for example to the referee if the writer believes he influenced the result due to perceived incompetence.

==Australian rules football==
In Australian rules football, the player of the game is often referred to as having been the &quot;best on ground&quot; (or &quot;BOG&quot;). Media outlets provide immediate, unofficial recognition that is largely honorary, often on a 5–4–3–2–1 or 3–2–1 voting basis. Officially, the AFL recognises the player of the game as being the player awarded the maximum three votes by umpires in the Brownlow Medal count at season&#x27;s end. Exceptions are made during the season for certain reserved games such as the Western Derby, The ANZAC Day clash, QClash, and Showdown, where medallions are officially rewarded in presentations following the conclusion of the match. On the day of the AFL Grand Final, a player will be awarded the Norm Smith Medal as being the best on ground voted by an independent panel of Australian rules football experts.

==Cricket==

In cricket, the man of the match award became a regular feature in Test matches in the mid-1980s. The man of the match title is usually awarded to the player whose contribution is seen as the most critical in winning the game.

In one match held on 3 April 1996, the whole team from New Zealand was awarded the Men of the Match award. It was the first instance when a whole team was awarded it. In a test match played 15 through 18 January 1999 between South Africa vs West Indies, the whole South African team was awarded man of the match.

In Test matches, Jacques Kallis holds the record for the highest number of awards won, with 23 in 166 matches played. In ODIs, Sachin Tendulkar holds the record for the highest number of man of the match titles, with 62 awards in 463 matches played. Tendulkar is followed by Sanath Jayasuriya, who, along with Ricky Ponting, also holds the record for the most Man of the Match titles as captain. In the shortest form of the game, T20 Internationals, this record is held by Virat Kohli, who has won 15 awards in 115 matches.

==Gaelic games==
In the Gaelic games of hurling and Gaelic football, the &quot;man of the match&quot; (, &quot;hero of the game&quot;) is commonly awarded after important games. An unusual example was the 2008 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship final, where the award was given to Brian Cody, the Kilkenny manager, rather than to a player.

In the women&#x27;s sports of camogie and ladies&#x27; Gaelic football, the term &quot;player of the match&quot; (, &quot;hero of the game&quot;) is used instead.

==Ice hockey==

In North American ice hockey, the three players who perform best in the game, often either those who accumulate the most points or outstanding goaltenders, are usually designated the three stars of the game: the top-performing player is the &quot;first star&quot;, and so on. This tradition originated in the 1930s as a promotion for a &quot;Three Star&quot; brand of gasoline.

However, in international play (and outside North America), the &quot;three stars&quot; concept is rarely used. Instead, other leagues may issue awards to one player who performed best in the game.

==Rugby football==
Both codes of rugby, rugby league and rugby union, commonly have man of the match or player of the match awards. In televised or sponsored matches, a commentator or sponsor often decides who gets the award, and it is presented to the winner after the match.

Examples of man of the match awards in professional men&#x27;s rugby league are the Clive Churchill Medal in the National Rugby League Grand Final, the Karyn Murphy Medal in the NRL Women&#x27;s Grand Final, the Lance Todd Trophy in the Challenge Cup final and the Harry Sunderland Trophy in the Super League Grand Final.

==College basketball and college football==
In college basketball and college football, the two collegiate sports with the most television coverage in the United States, a top player from each team is usually honoured as &quot;players of the game.&quot; These athletes usually cannot collect material prizes due to NCAA regulations. Instead, television companies broadcasting the game or corporate sponsors will often make donations to the scholarship funds of each school in the names of the winning players.

In college basketball&#x27;s Final Four events, a Most Outstanding Player award is given, for performance across both the semi-final and championship game. A Most Outstanding Player award is also given for each of the four regionals, based upon performances in the regional semifinals (Sweet Sixteen) and final (Elite Eight).

==Gridiron football==
The National Football League names an MVP for two prominent games on its schedule:
* A Super Bowl Most Valuable Player Award has been awarded at each Super Bowl (the NFL&#x27;s championship).
* The Pro Bowl has had an MVP award throughout its existence. The current Pro Bowl MVP format selects one offensive and one defensive player. From 1956 to 1971, two MVP awards were given, one to a skill position and the other to a lineman or linebacker. In 1972, an offensive and defensive MVP were named. From 1973 to 2012, a single Pro Bowl MVP was chosen.

Individual games typically have an informal player (or players) of the game chosen by the broadcast network covering the game; one prominent example of this phenomenon is the Turkey Leg Award, All-Iron Award and Galloping Gobbler trophies awarded for games held on Thanksgiving.

The Canadian Football League awards two MVP awards for its championship game, the Grey Cup. The Grey Cup Most Valuable Player award is open to all players; the Dick Suderman Trophy is limited to players with Canadian citizenship or who were raised in Canada since childhood.

<text>In numerical analysis, the Clenshaw algorithm, also called Clenshaw summation, is a recursive method to evaluate a linear combination of Chebyshev polynomials. The method was published by Charles William Clenshaw in 1955. It is a generalization of Horner&#x27;s method for evaluating a linear combination of monomials.

It generalizes to more than just Chebyshev polynomials; it applies to any class of functions that can be defined by a three-term recurrence relation.

==Clenshaw algorithm==

In full generality, the Clenshaw algorithm computes the weighted sum of a finite series of functions formula_1:
formula_2
where formula_3 is a sequence of functions that satisfy the linear recurrence relation
formula_4
where the coefficients formula_5 and formula_6 are known in advance.

The algorithm is most useful when formula_1 are functions that are complicated to compute directly, but formula_5 and formula_6 are particularly simple. In the most common applications, formula_10 does not depend on formula_11, and formula_12 is a constant that depends on neither formula_13 nor formula_11.

To perform the summation for given series of coefficients formula_15, compute the values formula_16 by the &quot;reverse&quot; recurrence formula:
formula_17

Note that this computation makes no direct reference to the functions formula_1. After computing formula_19 and formula_20,
the desired sum can be expressed in terms of them and the simplest functions formula_21 and formula_22:
formula_23

See Fox and Parker for more information and stability analyses.

==Examples==
===Horner as a special case of Clenshaw===
A particularly simple case occurs when evaluating a polynomial of the form
formula_24
The functions are simply
formula_25
and are produced by the recurrence coefficients formula_26 and formula_27.

In this case, the recurrence formula to compute the sum is
formula_28
and, in this case, the sum is simply
formula_29
which is exactly the usual Horner&#x27;s method.

===Special case for Chebyshev series===
Consider a truncated Chebyshev series
formula_30

The coefficients in the recursion relation for the Chebyshev polynomials are
formula_31
with the initial conditions
formula_32

Thus, the recurrence is
formula_33
and the final sum is
formula_34

One way to evaluate this is to continue the recurrence one more step, and compute
formula_35
(note the doubled &quot;a&quot;0 coefficient) followed by
formula_36

===Meridian arc length on the ellipsoid===
Clenshaw summation is extensively used in geodetic applications. A simple application is summing the trigonometric series to compute the meridian arc distance on the surface of an ellipsoid. These have the form
formula_37

Leaving off the initial formula_38 term, the remainder is a summation of the appropriate form. There is no leading term because formula_39.

The recurrence relation for formula_40 is
formula_41
making the coefficients in the recursion relation
formula_42
and the evaluation of the series is given by
formula_43
The final step is made particularly simple because formula_44, so the end of the recurrence is simply formula_45; the formula_38 term is added separately:
formula_47

Note that the algorithm requires only the evaluation of two trigonometric quantities formula_48 and formula_49.

===Difference in meridian arc lengths===
Sometimes it necessary to compute the difference of two meridian arcs in a way that maintains high relative accuracy. This is accomplished by using trigonometric identities to write
formula_50
Clenshaw summation can be applied in this case
provided we simultaneously compute formula_51
and perform a matrix summation,
formula_52
where
formula_53
The first element of formula_54 is the average
value of formula_55 and the second element is the average slope.
formula_56 satisfies the recurrence
relation
formula_57
where
formula_58
takes the place of formula_59 in the recurrence relation, and formula_60.
The standard Clenshaw algorithm can now be applied to yield
formula_61
where formula_62 are 2×2 matrices. Finally we have
formula_63
This technique can be used in the limit formula_64 and formula_65 to simultaneously compute formula_66 and the derivative formula_67, provided that, in evaluating formula_68 and formula_69, we take formula_70.

<text>Maurice Pujo (; 26 January 1872 – 6 September 1955) was a French journalist and co-founder of the nationalist and monarchist Action Française movement. He became the leader of the Camelots du Roi, the youth organization of the Action Française which took part in many right-wing demonstrations in the years before World War II (1939–45). After World War II he was imprisoned for collaborationist activity.

==Life==

===Early years===
Maurice Pujo was born on 26 January 1872. His family was Catholic and royalist. Pujo studied at the &quot;lycée&quot; in Orléans at the same time as Charles Péguy. When he was eighteen he won a prize for an essay on Spinoza&#x27;s moral philosophy. He expected to make a career as a literary critic. He launched the journal &quot;La Revue jeune&quot;, later renamed &quot;L’Art et la Vie&quot;, which lasted for a few years. He was fluent in German, very interested in German culture and an ardent follower of Richard Wagner. In 1894 he published his first book, &quot;Le règne de la grâce&quot;, an essay inspired by the philosophy of the German philosopher Novalis that was praised by the Socialist leader Jean Jaurès. He visited Germany as a student in the 1890s. The experience turned him against German influence and made him a French nationalist.

===Anti-Dreyfusard===

In April 1898, at the height of the Dreyfus affair, the circle of leftist intellectuals to which Pujo belonged became supporters of Alfred Dreyfus. Maurice Pujo and Henri Vaugeois left this group. Late in 1898 Vaugeois, Pujo and a few other nationalists who met at the Café de Flore founded the &quot;Comité d&#x27;action française&quot; (Committee of French Action). Three of this group, Louis Dausset, Gabriel Syveton and Vaugeois, opposed to the League for the Rights of Man and Dreyfus, launched a petition that attacked Émile Zola and what many saw as an internationalist, pacifist left-wing conspiracy. In November 1898 their petition gained signatures in the Parisian schools, and was soon circulated throughout political, intellectual and artistic circles in Paris.

On 19 December 1898 Pujo published an article that first used the term &quot;L’Action française&quot; (French Action) in the daily paper &quot;L’Éclair&quot; in which he declared that the dispute over Dreyfus was damaging France&#x27;s vital interests, and called for maintenance of the traditions of the homeland. He said the purpose of the &quot;Action française&quot; should be &quot;to remake France, republican and free, into a State as organized at home, as powerful abroad, as it was under the Ancien Régime.&quot; The decision to create the nationalist anti-Dreyfusard Ligue de la patrie française (League of the French Homeland) was made on 31 December 1898. The &quot;Comité d&#x27;action française&quot; was soon merged into the League, which was led by Jules Lemaître.

===Action Française===

The circle around Vaugeois soon became disillusioned with the League, which lacked any clear doctrine. Vaugeois disagreed with Lemaître&#x27;s plan to participate in the next legislative elections. The &quot;Comité d&#x27;action française&quot; was recreated in April 1899, and the foundational conference of the Action Française movement was held on 20 June 1899 in Paris. In his keynote speech at this meeting Vaugeois declared that the movement stood for &quot;anti-Semitic, anti-Masonic, anti-parliamentary and anti-democratic&quot; nationalism. Charles Maurras soon joined the Action Française. Maurras thought the Bourbon monarchy should be restored, using violence if needed. Pujo came to agree with Maurras. He wrote later, &quot;Under the mortal blows of Charles Maurras, the republicanism of each of us succumbed one by one in this year, 1900, which was the year of the &quot;hegira&quot; for the Action Francaise.&quot;

On 16 November 1908 Lucien Moreau and Maurice Pujo created the Camelots du Roi youth movement. Maxime Real del Sarte was a co-founder. In the autumn of 1908 Pujo led the &quot;Camelots&quot; in a series of nationalist demonstrations ostensibly against a Sorbonne student named Thalamas who had insulted Joan of Arc. He remained director of the &quot;Camelots&quot; from 1908 to 1939. During World War I (1914–18) Pujo was called up and served on the front. In 1920 Pujo said the Sorbonne was still dangerously infatuated with German culture, and was infiltrated by &quot;foreigners, spies, Jews and Bolsheviks.&quot; He called for dismissal of faculty members who he thought were pro-German such as Victor Basch, Charles Seignobos and Aulard. He continued to lead demonstrations by the Camelots du Roi into the 1930s, notably the demonstrations about the Stavisky Affair of January and February 1934.

During World War II (1939–45) when the Germans occupied France Pujo stayed with Maurras in Lyon. After Léon Daudet died in 1942 Pujo was made co-director of the daily &quot;Action Française&quot;. He was imprisoned by the Gestapo for three weeks in June 1944. In January 1945 Pujo and Maurras were tried for collaboration and Pujo was sentenced to five years in prison. He was released in October 1947. He then became political director of &quot;Aspects de la France&quot; until his death on 6 September 1955. Pujo has been called &quot;a kind of exalted flunky and right-hand man for Maurras.&quot;

Pujo&#x27;s son, Pierre Pujo led Action Française until his death on 10 November 2007.

<text>The Stellafane Observatory is an astronomical observatory in Springfield, Vermont, founded in 1920 by Russell W. Porter. The Pink Clubhouse was built in 1923 at the site by the Springfield Telescope Makers. The name &quot;Stellafane&quot;, suggested by Porter at the club&#x27;s December 1923 meeting, is derived from the Latin words &quot;stella&quot; and &quot;fanum&quot; meaning &quot;Shrine to the Stars&quot;, and originally referred specifically to the clubhouse, but has since come to refer to all of the club&#x27;s land and buildings on the summit of Breezy Hill, west of downtown Springfield.

The Stellafane Convention, a gathering of amateur telescope makers and amateur astronomers is the longest running astronomical convention in the United States, having been held nearly every year at the location since 1926. The clubhouse and observatory became listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977, and became a National Historic Landmark in 1989, in recognition of the club&#x27;s pioneering role in the popularization of astronomy and the amateur construction of telescopes.

==History==
Russell Porter was born in Springfield in 1871, and in 1919, upon returning to the town, began constructing telescopes with the assistance of employees and equipment from the factories in Springfield. The Springfield Telescope Makers Club grew out of an instructional class on how to make telescopes that was started by Porter the following year, on 12 August 1920.

===Stellafane Clubhouse===

On , the members of this small group held their first meeting, deciding to build a clubhouse on a plot belonging to Porter on the summit of Breezy Hill outside of town.

The original clubhouse, with an ell added in 1926, included a meeting room, a kitchen, a workshop, and bunk rooms on the second floor. The building incorporated a polar Cassegrain telescope, a transit telescope (no longer functional), a solar telescope, and a sundial on the south wall.

==Stellafane (Original Site)==
Besides the historic Stellafane &quot;pink clubhouse&quot;, the original site includes Porter&#x27;s uniquely designed Porter Turret Telescope, a f/17 Newtonian reflector built in 1930, consisting of an equatorially rotated concrete dome with the telescope mounted on the outside, with the observer on the inside working in heated comfort.

In 2017, the Simoni Spectrohelioscope Solar Observatory was constructed near the Turret Telescope, named after long-time convention attendee Andrew E. Simoni (1918–2013).

Stellafane West is still the location where the Springfield Telescope Makers hold most of their meetings and telescope competitions.

==Stellafane East==
Although the amateur telescope competition and display is still held on the original site around the clubhouse, most of the convention activities since the 1980s have taken place at Stellafane East, an annex to the original land about away.

Stellafane East includes the more recent McGregor Observatory, built between 1986 and 1991, which boasts a Schupmann telescope, the Breuning Domed Observatory built in the early 2000s, the Flanders Pavilion, built in 2005 and named after founding club member Ernest Flanders, the &quot;Amphitheater&quot; hillside presentation area, the &quot;Bunkhouse&quot;, which contains radio communications equipment, and several other buildings on the eastern site.

Over of land at Stellafane East are reserved as a camping area, with plots for tents, campers, and RVs to reside during the multi-day convention and other gatherings.

==Stellafane Convention==
The Stellafane Convention is held every year on the club&#x27;s land and buildings on the summit of Breezy Hill. It was started by Porter and the Springfield Telescope Makers in 1926, as an occasion for some 20 amateur telescope makers to compare telescopes and exchange ideas. It has since become Thousands of amateur telescope makers from all over the world gather to share their innovations, join in competitions, and enjoy the night sky. The convention is generally held over the weekend of the new moon closest to the height of the Perseid meteor shower, usually in early August.

The convention has been held nearly every summer since 1926, with the exceptions of:
* 1949–1953, following the death of founder Russell W. Porter
* 2020, due to the COVID-19 pandemic

The convention has been attended by several notable figures in the fields of astronomy and space exploration, including Alan Bean, David H. Levy, Alan Stern, Clyde Tombaugh, and Samuel D. Hale, grandson of George Ellery Hale.

<text>Russell Williams Porter (December 13, 1871 – February 22, 1949) was an American artist, engineer, architect, cartographer, amateur astronomer, and Arctic explorer. He was a pioneer in the field of cutaway drawing and is sometimes referred to as the &quot;founder of amateur telescope making.&quot;

==Biography==
Russell W. Porter, the youngest of five children, was born in 1871 in Springfield, Vermont. His parents were Frederick and Caroline Porter. Russell showed an early aptitude for art. He graduated from Vermont Academy in 1891 and went on to study engineering at Norwich University and at the University of Vermont and later studied architecture and art at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. As a young architect he designed at least one building, the Springfield Town Library in his hometown. He designed this with assistance from Willard P. Adden, an experienced architect in the office of Charles Brigham. The building was built in the Renaissance Revival style on a Beaux-Arts plan, typical of MIT teachings.

===Arctic exploration===

Porter became interested in the arctic when he attended Robert Peary&#x27;s lectures on Greenland in 1892. He signed up to sail on the ship &quot;Miranda&quot; as surveyor and artist for Frederick Cook&#x27;s voyage to Greenland that next year. The voyage ended with the ship colliding with an iceberg and the crew being rescued by Inuit. Porter continued travel to the arctic with Peary and Greenland again in 1896, to Baffin Island in 1897, with the Yukon gold rush in 1898, to Labrador in 1899, and northern Greenland in 1900.

Porter was in charge of astronomical observations on the Ziegler Polar Expeditions financed by New York businessman William Ziegler in 1901 and 1903. The second expedition was stranded in the arctic for 3 years when their ship, the Steam Yacht &quot;America&quot;, was crushed by the ice and sank in Teplitz Bay of Rudolf Island in the Russian arctic. In 1906 Porter again joined Frederick Cook in an expedition to Alaska&#x27;s Denali. Porter&#x27;s party surveyed a region around the mountain (including painting a watercolor of the mountain) while Cook&#x27;s party broke off to climb the mountain. When the parties rendezvoused, Porter was skeptical of Cook&#x27;s claims that he climbed the mountain.

===Port Clyde, Maine years===
After his arctic adventures, Porter settled down in Port Clyde, Maine where he tried to start an art colony at Land&#x27;s End but failed. He built rental cottages, and tried farming. There he married Alice Marshall, the postmistress. Caroline, a daughter, was born in 1912. He also took up astronomy and the hobby of telescope making. He was encouraged by his friend back in Springfield, fellow amateur astronomer and telescope builder James Hartness. In 1913, Hartness sent Porter some telescope building ideas and literature along with two 16-inch-diameter glass blanks. Porter used these to build &quot;polar reflector&quot; that he incorporated into the roof of a den he added on to his house in a design that allowed him to observe the sky from indoor heated comfort during long Maine winters. Porter wrote an article about his design for the May 1916 issue of &quot;Popular Astronomy&quot;. Also in 1913, using field stones from walls that crisscrossed Land&#x27;s End, Porter and one other man built his stone guesthouse in the style of a castle complete with a circular room and square tower, calling it Fieldstone Castle. 
In 1915, Porter returned to MIT as a professor of architecture. He worked for the National Bureau of Standards producing prisms and experimenting with the silvering of mirrors during World War I.

== Springfield and Stellafane==

Porter moved back to Springfield, Vermont in 1919 to work at the Jones &amp; Lamson Machine Company, of which James Hartness was president. There he helped Hartness to produce an optical comparator, an instrument for accurately checking the pitch, form, and lead of screw threads. He also designed for this company The Porter Garden Telescope, an innovative ornamental telescope for the garden.

===Springfield Telescope Makers===
In August 1920, with the help of Hartness, Porter started a class on how to make telescopes. Fifteen people signed up for that class; 14 men, most of whom were workers from Jones &amp; Lamson, and one woman, a school teacher. Porter showed them how to make Newtonian reflectors, teaching all the aspects of mirror making including grinding, polishing, and testing their own mirrors, and designing and constructing telescope mounts. The members of this small group decided to form an astronomical club and December 7, 1923, was the first meeting of the Springfield Telescope Makers. Soon after, they built a clubhouse on a plot belonging to Porter on Breezy Hill outside of town. They called the clubhouse &quot;Stellafane&quot;, Latin for &quot;shrine to the stars&quot;. The Springfield Telescope Makers invited other groups of stargazers to their clubhouse in 1926, to compare telescopes and exchange ideas. From this small meeting was born the annual event called “Stellafane”, an event that goes on to this day.

In 1925 Albert G. Ingalls featured Porter and the Springfield Telescope Makers in two articles he wrote for Scientific American magazine. The articles contained a great deal of material and illustrations contributed by Porter. There was so much public interest, a regular column, &quot;The Back Yard Astronomer&quot; (later to become &quot;The Amateur Scientist&quot; column) was started by Ingalls with Porter being a contributing editor. Much of the information from the articles published by Ingalls and Scientific American in the books &quot;Amateur Telescope Making&quot; (Vols. 1–3), a work that has been referred to as &quot;the bible of telescope making&quot;, helped to create lasting public interest in observational astronomy.

==Working on the Hale Telescope==

In 1927, at Ingalls suggestion, George Ellery Hale recruited Porter to work on the design of what was then to be the largest telescope on earth, the Hale Telescope at Palomar Observatory. Porter moved to Pasadena in December 1928 to work as an associate in optics and instrument design. During the conceptual development of the telescope Porter produced extremely detailed cutaway drawings that were noted for their precision and beauty. Porter&#x27;s designs were vital to success of the large telescope, which was completed in 1948.

Russell W. Porter died in 1949 of a heart attack at the age of 77. The crater Porter on the Moon and the crater Porter on Mars are named in his honor.

<text>The Juan Fernández fur seal (Arctocephalus philippii) is the second smallest of the fur seals, second only to the Galápagos fur seal. They are found only on the Pacific Coast of South America, more specifically on the Juan Fernández Islands and the Desventuradas Islands. There is still much that is unknown about this species. Scientists still do not know the average life span of this species, or the diet and behavior of males apart from the breeding season.

==Description==
The Juan Fernandez fur seal is part of the group of eared seals. Fur seals in general have thick insulating fur that protects the skin from cold water, they have small ear flaps on the side of their head, and they hold their weight on their front flippers which are also used for land locomotion. Fur seals are different from true seals because they have external ear flaps, but also true seals use their chest for support and movement, and fur seals walk on their front flippers.

The Juan Fernandez fur seal is the second smallest fur seal, second only to the Galápagos fur seal. Their bodies are short and robust with brown pelage. Both the fore flippers and the hind flippers are relatively short, and the hind flippers have fleshy tips on the digits. Females are lighter brown and average 100 pounds and 4&#x27;6&quot; long. Males are significantly larger and average 300 pounds and 6&#x27;6&quot; in length. Males have thicker necks than females and have generally darker brown pelage. Male seals have golden-tipped thick guard hairs on the back of the head, neck, and shoulders. This seal species has a trait called sexual dimorphism, meaning the males look much different from the females after reaching sexual maturity.

==History==
The Juan Fernández fur seal was discovered, and named, by Juan Fernández in the mid-1500s. Once the seal was discovered the population was decimated by over hunting for the fur trade. It was believed that the Juan Fernández fur seal was extinct until a small group of 200 was found on the Juan Fernández islands in the 1960s. Now it is estimated that over 12,000 individuals exist today.

In 1864 the naturalist Rodolfo Philippi, working at the Chilean National Museum of Natural History sent the fur and skeleton of a specimen to Wilhelm Peters in Berlin&#x27;s Museum für Naturkunde for taxonomic classification. Classification in Chile was not possible at the time as specimens for comparison and relevant literature on the topic were not available in the country. Also, early naturalists in Chile had also to deal with a wide range of topics while those in Europe were more specialized.

The resulting classification by Peters became the subject of a long-running scientific controversy. Hermann Burmeister compared drawings and the written description of the species with specimens at the La Plata Museum and concluded in 1866 that it was not a new species but a &quot;Phoca porcina&quot; that was described by the Jesuit Juan Ignacio Molina many years ago. In the early 1870s John Edward Gray, who had recently arrived specimens of similar species from Australia and New Zealand to his disposal, questioned whether Juan Fernández fur seal was a species by its own. In 1879 he wrote again on the subject claiming that &quot;O. philippi&quot; was indeed the same as &quot;Otaria ursina&quot; described by Claudio Gay. In 1888 and 1889 Phillipi published articles where he harshly criticized both Burmeisters alternative classification and his alleged errors, suggesting a poor knowledge of geography and of the sources he cited.

==Behavior==
This particular seal lives a solitary life. Seals forage out at sea and haul out on rocky shores to rest. Females seem to be fairly particular about where she rests during the day and prefer tide pools and rocky caves. The resting areas that females prefer often become areas of male competition for breeding rights. Although females will typically rest in close regions, they are sure to be a few feet away from each other and never touch one another.

==Reproduction==
Breeding is a territorial process with the Juan Fernández fur seal, males will aggressively fight for access to female resting sites. This seal is polygynous, meaning that one male breeds with multiple females. Pups are born between November and December and are weaned off the mother&#x27;s milk at 10 months of age. Mothers stay with the pups for about a week and then they leave to mate again and forage. Pups are born with soft black fur that fades to light brown within the first few years.

==Diet==
Not much is known about the diet of Juan Fernández fur seals. Scientists have only observed the diet of lactating females that are caring for pups. What they have observed is that females forage out at sea sometimes as far as 300 miles offshore and will dive to depths of to find lanternfish and squid. Typically lactating females will dive and forage at night when prey swims to shallow waters and become more accessible. Sometimes they will stay out at sea for up to 25 days, then return to shore and stay with the pups for 5 days.

During the period that the mothers are foraging, the pup goes without milk for several days, sometimes weeks. To combat this, the mother&#x27;s milk is high in fat and nutrients that the pup uses for energy while the mother is away. However, during this time, the pups&#x27; immune systems are not as highly-functioning as adults and can be prone to infection from intestinal parasites that lead to fatal infections. In the early 1990s, there were 60 pups discovered dead from hookworm infections, and also the presence of heavy metal ions were found in their systems. Such loss decimated the population and they are still recovering now.

<text>Bare-metal restore is a technique in the field of data recovery and restoration where the backed up data is available in a form that allows one to restore a computer system from &quot;bare metal&quot;, i.e. without any requirements as to previously installed software or operating system.

Typically, the backed up data includes the necessary operating system, applications and data components to rebuild or restore the backed up system to an entirely separate piece of hardware. In some configurations, the hardware receiving the restore needs to have an identical configuration to the hardware that was the source of the backup, although virtualization techniques and careful planning can enable a bare-metal restore to a hardware configuration different from the original.

Disk imaging applications enable bare-metal restores by storing copies (images) of the entire contents of hard disks to networked or other external storage, and then writing those images to other physical disks. The disk image application itself can include an entire operating system, bootable from a live CD or network file server, which contains all the required application code to create and restore the disk images.

==Examples of software used for bare-metal recovery==
The dd utility on a Linux boot CD can be used to copy file systems between disk images and disk partitions to effect a bare-metal backup and recovery. These disk images can then be used as input to a new partition of the same type but equal or larger size, or alternatively a variety of virtualization technologies as they often represent a more accessible but less efficient representation of the data on the original partition.

The IBM VM/370 operating system provides a command by the name of &quot;ddr,&quot; for disk dump and restore. It is a bit by bit backup of a hard drive to a specified media, typically tape, but many choices exist. 

Microsoft introduced a new backup utility (Wbadmin) into Windows Server 2008 family of operating system in 2008 which has built-in support for bare-metal recovery. Users of this software can also recover their system to a Hyper-V virtual machine.

Microsoft updated the Windows Recovery Environment features in the Windows 8 family of operating system to be set up to provide built-in support for bare-metal recovery.

Microsoft Windows Server 2012 (R2) offers built-in Bare-Metal-Recovery.

== Comparison with other data backup and restoration techniques ==
* Bare-metal restore differs from local disk image restore where a copy of the disk image, and the restoration software, are stored on the computer that is backed up.
* Bare-metal restore differs from simple data backups where application data, but neither the applications nor the operating system are backed up or restored as a unit.

<doc id="906724" wikidata="Q34009" url="?curid=906724" title="Liège–Bastogne–Liège">
<text>Liège–Bastogne–Liège , also known as &quot;La Doyenne&quot; (&quot;The Old Lady&quot;), is a one-day classic cycling race in Belgium. First run in 1892, it is the oldest of the five &quot;Monuments&quot; of the European professional road cycling calendar; usually coming as the last of the spring classics. It is held annually in late April, in the Ardennes region of Belgium, from Liège to Bastogne and back.

It is considered one of the most arduous one-day cycling events in the world because of its length and demanding course. The most successful rider with five victories is Belgian rider Eddy Merckx, trailed by Italian Moreno Argentin in the 1980s and Spaniard Alejandro Valverde in the 2000s, who both won the race four times.

Liège–Bastogne–Liège is part of the UCI World Tour competition. It is the concluding race of the Ardennes Classics series, which includes the Amstel Gold Race (not technically in the Ardennes, but treated as part of the series) and La Flèche Wallonne (&#x27;The Walloon Arrow&#x27;). Both Liège and La Fleche are organised by French owner Amaury Sport Organisation, which also organises the Tour de France and Paris–Roubaix. 

It generally marks the end of the entire spring classics season, as the one-day races give way to the stage races and grand tours; Liège is generally followed almost immediately by the week-long Giro d&#x27;Italia warm-up, the Tour de Romandie. The parcours, with its multiple short, hard climbs, is seen as friendlier terrain for general classification riders and climbers than the gravelled and cobbled classics of early spring. 

In 2017, the Liège–Bastogne–Liège Femmes was inaugurated and added to the UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour, becoming the second of the cycling monuments to introduce a women&#x27;s edition after the Tour of Flanders in 2014. In 2020 a third women&#x27;s &#x27;monument&#x27;, Paris-Roubaix Femmes was added, creating a triple crown of women&#x27;s monuments.

==History==

===Spa-Bastogne-Spa===
Like many of cycling&#x27;s classics, Liège–Bastogne–Liège was first organized by a French-Belgian newspaper (&quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;). The route has always stayed in the southern, French-speaking (and hillier), part of Belgium where Liège and Bastogne are located.
The race had its first running for amateurs in 1892, from Spa to Bastogne and back, over a 250 km distance. As bicycles were expensive in the late 19th century, cycling was considered an exclusive sport for the wealthy, and the event was considered a &quot;gentlemen&#x27;s affair&quot;. 33 riders from the &quot;Liège cycling union&quot; and the &quot;Pesant Club Liégois&quot;, all Belgians and most of them from Liège, took the start. Only 17 finished. The course halfway turn point was the train station in Bastogne, chosen because of its convenience for race officials. Some tired riders abandoned the race in Bastogne and took the train back to Spa. Léon Houa, a Liège native, won the race after 10 hours and 48 minutes on the bike. The second-place finisher, Léon Lhoest, came in at 22 minutes, the third, Louis Rasquinet, at 44 minutes. Riders kept arriving for another five hours.

Houa won again the next year, over the same course, this time by a margin of a half hour. In 1894 the first race for professionals was held, and the average speed rose from to . Houa concluded his third win, by seven minutes over Rasquinet. Frenchman Maurice Garin, who would later become the first winner of the Tour de France, finished fourth. After the inaugural three editions, the race was not organized for another 14 years, after which it was sometimes open only to amateurs and semi-professionals.

The race was resumed in 1908, with a start and finish in Liège for the first time. It was won by Frenchman André Trousselier. In 1909 the winner, Eugène Charlier, was disqualified because he had changed bikes. Victor Fastre was declared winner. The event was cancelled during World War I but resumed in 1919. The race was mainly won by Belgians, but started to attract more riders from Flanders, the bike-crazed northern part of Belgium, who began to dominate the event. Fleming Alfons Schepers gained three victories in the Interwar period.

===Ardennes Classic===
Liège–Bastogne–Liège had some interruptions during World War II, but was again a calendar-fixture as from 1945 and began to attract some of the stars of European cycling. In 1951 the race was added to the Challenge Desgrange-Colombo, the competition that combined cycling&#x27;s greatest races at the time. Swiss Ferdinand Kübler won the race in 1951 and 1952. Belgian favourite Raymond Impanis became the race&#x27;s eternal runner-up, with four second places but never a victory.

In the late 1950s Fred De Bruyne won the race three times in his first three participations, equalling the former record of Houa and Schepers. In 1957 two riders were declared winner. Germain Derijcke was first over the finish line, but he had crossed a closed level crossing. Derijcke had won by a three-minute lead and judges felt he had not gained that much time from illegally crossing the railway, thereby not disqualifying him. Officials compromised to promote second-place rider Frans Schoubben to first as well. In 1959 Liège–Bastogne–Liège became part of the Super Prestige, successor of the Desgrange-Colombo competition and early precursor of the UCI World Tour, making the &quot;Ardennes Classic&quot; one of the main cycling events of the year.
In 1969 began the era of cycling icon Eddy Merckx, who gained five victories, three of which consecutive, and a total of seven podium finishes. The 1971 race was run in appalling conditions, with snow and cold ravaging the peloton. Merckx gained one of his most memorable victories. The Belgian attacked in solo at 92 kilometers from the finish and soon had a five-minute advantage over his pursuiters. In a rare display, he suffered a sudden fatigue near the end and was joined by Georges Pintens. Pintens failed to distance a tired Merckx, and Merckx managed to outsprint his fellow Belgian to his second victory in the classic. 
 In 1972 the finish moved to Verviers, 15 km from Liège, but because of fans&#x27; protest, this was a one-year occasion. The edition was again won by Merckx. In 1975 &quot;The Cannibal&quot; sealed his fifth and final victory, making him the sole record-holder of &quot;La Doyenne&quot;.

French cycling great, Bernard Hinault won the race twice, both times in harrowing weather conditions. In 1977 Hinault made a late escape from a six-strong group including a faltering Eddy Merckx; three years later he won the epic contest of 1980 in torrential snowfall and glacial temperatures (see below).

In the 1980s, Italian &quot;classics&quot; specialist Moreno Argentin won the race four times, narrowly missing Merckx&#x27; record. Argentin also gained three victories in the sister classic La Flèche Wallonne, earning him the title of &quot;King of the Ardennes&quot; in his day.

===Finish in Ans===
In 1990, the &quot;Pesant Club Liégeois&quot; partnered with the Société du Tour de France, the organizer of cycling&#x27;s flagships the Tour de France and Paris–Roubaix. The partnership led to a more professional organization, resulting in a complete overhauling of the race course: the start and finish moved to different locations in Liège and five new climbs were included.

In the late 1990s, Italians Michele Bartoli and Paolo Bettini continued a tradition of Italian victories in La Doyenne, with two wins each. In 1997, Bartoli and Laurent Jalabert made a decisive breakaway on the climb of La Redoute, 40 km from the finish. Both riders worked together and Bartoli broke away from the Frenchman on the steep slopes in the final kilometer of the race. Jalabert, a specialist of the Ardennes races, finished second two years in a row but failed to win the &quot;Doyenne&quot;. In 1999, Bartoli sought a third consecutive win, but his effort was thwarted by young Belgian Frank Vandenbroucke who controlled the race and stunned followers with his victory.
In 2005, Kazakh Alexander Vinokourov and German Jens Voigt broke away from the peloton 80 km from the end. Although the escape seemed unlikely to stay away in modern cycling, the two riders made it to the finish ahead of the peloton, with Vinokourov beating Voigt in the sprint.

Other memorable editions were the races of 2009 and 2010. In 2009, young Luxembourger Andy Schleck produced a solo breakaway to beat a strong field and win the race. In 2010, Alexander Vinokourov concluded his second victory by outsprinting his breakaway companion Alexander Kolobnev. The victory was controversial, not only because Vinokourov had recently returned to cycling after a doping ban, but also because it was suggested he had &#x27;bought&#x27; the victory. Swiss magazine L&#x27;Illustré published e-mail correspondence between the winner and runner-up that suggests Vinokourov paid Kolobnev €100,000 not to contest the final sprint. Both riders were later charged with bribery by Belgian authorities.

In recent years, Spanish allrounder Alejandro Valverde won four times, all sprint victories of a select group at the finish.

==Route==

===Present course===

The route of Liège–Bastogne–Liège crosses the two eastern Walloon provinces, Liège and Luxembourg, from north to south and back. Its distance is more or less fixed at 250–260 km. The race starts in the center of Liège, after which the course follows a straightforward route southwards to Bastogne, and a winding route back to Liège.

The second half of the course contains numerous climbs, such as the Stockeu, Haute-Levée, La Redoute, and the Côte de la Roche-aux-Faucons, before finishing in Liège. In the final 15 km of the race, the course makes a remarkable transition from the meadowy and agrarian landscapes in the Ardennes to the post-industrial urban scenery of Liège.

===Course changes===
Until 1991, the race finished in Liège&#x27;s city center. In 1992, the finish moved to the industrial suburb of Ans, on the northwestern side of the city. The steep Côte de Saint-Nicolas was included in the final kilometres, along with a final climb to the finish in Ans. The move implied profound changes to the character of the race, as climbers with a strong uphill-sprint in recent years often wait until the final stretches to launch their ultimate attack.

The route usually has some minor changes every year, with some climbs skipped and others added, but the traditional finale containing the Côte de La Redoute, Côte de la Roche-aux-Faucons and Côte de Saint-Nicolas was a fixture for 27 years.

In 2019, the finish line moved back into the centre of Liège, with a flat run-in towards the finish. Both the Côte de Saint-Nicolas and the final climb to Ans were thereby removed from the route. The Côte de la Roche-aux-Faucons is the final named climb, topping out at 13 km from the finish but the climbing continues after a short descent off of La Roche, with the final uphill topping out approximately 10.5 km from the finish line.

==Race characteristics==

===Demands===

Liège–Bastogne–Liège is considered one of the most arduous one-day races in the world because of its length and succession of steep climbs. Every edition, about a dozen climbs – ranging in length, gradient and difficulty – are addressed, offering opportunities to attack.
The British magazine &quot;Cycling Weekly&quot; stated: 
:&quot;In purely physical terms, this is probably the toughest classic: the climbs are long, most of them are pretty steep as well, and they come up with depressing frequency in the final kilometres.&quot;
Four-times winner Moreno Argentin said:
:&quot;Riders who win in Liège are what we call &quot;fondisti&quot; – men with a superior level of stamina. [The climb of] La Redoute is like the Mur de Huy in that it has to be tackled at pace, from the front of the peloton. The gradient is about 14 or 15 per cent, and it comes after 220 or 230 kilometers, so you don&#x27;t have to be a genius to work out how tough it is. I remember that we used to go up with a maximum of 39 x 21 – it&#x27;s not quite as steep as the Mur de Huy. A lot of riders mistakenly think you should attack on the hardest part, but in reality you hurt people on the slightly flatter section that comes after this.&quot;
:&quot;Liège is a race of trial by elimination, where it&#x27;s very unlikely that a breakaway can go clear and decide the race before the final . You need to be strong and at the same time clever and calculating — in this sense it&#x27;s a complete test of a cyclist&#x27;s ability.&quot;

===Climbs===
The most iconic hill is the Côte de La Redoute, the 2.0 km climb in Aywaille at an average gradient of 8.9% with slopes of over 20%. For a long time in the 1980s and 1990s La Redoute, at ca. 40 km from the finish, was the breaking point of the race and often the place where decisive breakaways were launched. In recent years the climb seems to have lost that particular role, as many riders are able to keep up with the pace on the climb and race favourites often wait until the last stages of the race to make a break.

In modern cycling, as in many bike races, the decisive stretches have evolved towards the final climbs of the day. The Côte de Saint-Nicolas is the last categorized climb of the race, with the top at 6 km from the finish in Ans. It is a precipitous and atypical climb because it is not part of the forested hills in the Ardennes, but located in the middle of the industrial suburbs of Liège along the Meuse river. In 2016, the organisers inserted the 600 m cobbled Côte de la Rue Naniot following the Côte de Saint-Nicolas, but preceding the finish in Ans. This turned out to be a one-off, however, as the race has not used the climb since.

Since the finish returned to Liège in 2019, the Côte de Saint-Nicolas has been removed from the route, and the decisive climbs are once again the Côte de la Redoute, Côte des Forges and Côte de la Roche-aux-Faucons.

Course changes are frequent from year to year. Climbs are sometimes cut or others included. These are the climbs in recent editions:

===Weather===
The weather in April is often unpredictable and the race has repeatedly been affected by harsh weather conditions. In 1919, 1957, 1980, and 2016 there was severe snowfall. The edition of 1980 was exceptionally hard: snow fell from the start and temperatures were near freezing point, leading commentators to call it &quot; &#x27;Neige-Bastogne-Neige&#x27; &quot; (Snow-Bastogne-Snow). Bernard Hinault attacked with to go and finished nearly 10 minutes ahead.

A feature published by the British magazine, &quot;Procycling&quot; in 2000, described the infamous race:

:A cold wind that blew across Belgium brought snow flakes and then a heavy fall within moments of the race starting. (...) Riders struggled on, with hands to faces to keep a view of the road. The race was an anonymous mass of plastic jackets and windcheaters. Spectators stood in goggles like upmarket snowmen, red-faced in the bitterness. Within the hour some teams had barely a man left on the road. They pulled out two dozen at a time, men like Gibi Baronchelli and Giuseppe Saronni, Lucien Van Impe and Jean-René Bernaudeau.

Bernard Hinault, the winner, was one of just 21 riders to finish the race of 174 starters. It took three weeks for proper movement to return to two fingers of his right hand.

==Ardennes Classics==
Liège–Bastogne–Liège is the concluding race of the Ardennes Classics series, which includes La Flèche Wallonne. Both are organised by ASO.

The Flèche Wallonne (&quot;Walloon Arrow&quot;), although younger than Liège–Bastogne–Liège, was longtime considered the more prestigious event of the two Ardennes Classics, showing how prestige and importance of a race can sometimes change over time. At one time, Flèche Wallonne and Liège–Bastogne–Liège were run on successive days known as &quot;Le Weekend Ardennais&quot;, with Liège–Bastogne–Liège organized on Saturday and the Flèche Wallonne on Sunday.

Only seven riders have won both races in the same year: Spaniard Alejandro Valverde three times (2006, 2015 and 2017), Swiss Ferdinand Kübler twice (in 1951 and 1952), Belgians Stan Ockers (1955), Eddy Merckx (1972), and Philippe Gilbert (2011) and Italians Moreno Argentin (1991) and Davide Rebellin (2004).

In 2011 Belgian Philippe Gilbert won Liège–Bastogne–Liège, completing a unique streak of classics victories in a span of ten days. Gilbert had previously won the Brabantse Pijl, Amstel Gold Race and La Flèche Wallonne, thus achieving a historic &quot;quadruple&quot; of victories in the hilly classics of April. Gilbert beat Luxembourg brothers Fränck and Andy Schleck in a sprint of three.

== Liège–Bastogne–Liège Femmes ==
In 2017, Liège–Bastogne–Liège Femmes in the UCI Women&#x27;s World Tour was inaugurated, following the example of La Flèche Wallonne Féminine and Women&#x27;s Amstel Gold Race. The first Liège–Bastogne–Liège Femmes, run on 23 April 2017, was won by Olympic champion Anna van der Breggen of the Netherlands.

At 135.5 km, the race is approximately half the distance of the men&#x27;s event. Hence, it does not start in Liège but in Bastogne, from where it heads north past Liège to finish in Ans on the same location as the men&#x27;s race. The route features four categorized climbs: the Côte de la Vecquée, Côte de La Redoute, Côte de la Roche aux faucons and Côte de Saint-Nicolas. The top of the last climb of Saint-Nicolas comes at 5.5 km from the finish.

<text>Circus is a 2000 British/American neo noir crime film directed by Rob Walker and written by David Logan. The movie stars John Hannah, Famke Janssen, Peter Stormare, Brian Conley, Fred Ward and Eddie Izzard. It was released in the United Kingdom on 5 May 2000 and in the United States on 15 September 2000.

==Plot==
Con artists Leo (John Hannah) and Lily (Famke Janssen) are partners both in work and in life. Lily wants to get out of the racket and settle down in a nice place somewhere far away. Leo agrees, saying that within a week they should have enough to leave for good.

Leo&#x27;s cousin Bruno (Brian Conley) is having a problem with his casino losing money. He wants Leo to run it. But he hates Leo and wants to get rid of him.

Further complicating Leo&#x27;s life is Julius (Peter Stormare) who has asked Leo to kill his wife, Gloria. Only when it comes time to be paid, Julius, who has Leo committing the murder on tape, confesses he does not have a wife; he paid a woman to pretend to be his wife. Julius wants 500,000 in pounds, otherwise, he will release the tape to the authorities.

Then Moose shows up and he is looking for a woman who is the love of his life. Her name is Gloria. He asks if Leo could help him find her and Leo reluctantly agrees.

Finally, there&#x27;s Troy, a loan shark. Leo owes him a lot of money, but he has lost it all at the track. Troy is getting increasingly impatient and violent as he does not like to be kept waiting on his money.

Evidence is piling up that Lily is working a con on Leo. With all these problems, it does not look as if Leo will survive the week.

Bruno&#x27;s in trouble with the Inland Revenue, so his accountant, Julius, comes up with an idea to con Lily by turning all of Bruno&#x27;s shipping company over to her, while Bruno pockets a $20 million. Only the problem is that Leo has got to Julius first and worked out a con of his own. Together Julius and Leo staged Gloria&#x27;s murder.

Leo goes to meet Julius with the blackmail money. Bruno has men with guns waiting, but Moose shows up to even out the fight. A bloodbath ensues and Julius, the only survivor, tells the tale to Bruno.

Only Leo is not dead, and he leaves a recording that Lily finds and then shows to Bruno. Leo figured out that Lily was conning him, and he confesses that he stole Bruno&#x27;s money. An enraged Lily and Bruno go to find Julius and catch him as he is splitting town. But then Leo shows up wanting to kill Bruno.

Bruno says that Leo cannot possibly kill him because he would have to kill his wife also. Reluctantly Leo agrees, and shoots Lily. Then he convinces Julius that the only way they can be partners is if he kills Bruno, so that they have a murder each on their hands. Julius does not mean to, but the gun goes off and Bruno is dead.

During their getaway, Julius begins to feel odd. Leo confesses that he slipped a sedative into Julius&#x27; drink. He leaves a drugged Julius by the side of the road and with the con finished he makes his way to the train station where he meets up with Lily.

<doc id="906742" wikidata="Q393800" url="?curid=906742" title="Theta role">
<text>Theta roles are the names of the participant roles associated with a predicate: the predicate may be a verb, an adjective, a preposition, or a noun. If an object is in motion or in a steady state as the speakers perceives the state, or it is the topic of discussion, it is called a theme. The participant is usually said to be an argument of the predicate. In generative grammar, a theta role or θ-role is the formal device for representing syntactic argument structure—the number and type of noun phrases—required syntactically by a particular verb. For example, the verb &quot;put&quot; requires three arguments (i.e., it is trivalent).

The formal mechanism for implementing a verb&#x27;s argument structure is codified as theta roles. The verb &quot;put&quot; is said to &quot;assign&quot; three theta roles. This is coded in a theta grid associated with the lexical entry for the verb. The correspondence between the theta grid and the actual sentence is accomplished by means of a bijective filter on the grammar known as the theta criterion. Early conceptions of theta roles include (Fillmore called theta roles &quot;cases&quot;) and .

Theta roles are prominent in government and binding theory and the standard theory of transformational grammar.

== Thematic relations ==

The term &quot;theta role&quot; is often used interchangeably with the term thematic relations (particularly in mainstream generative grammar—for an exception see ). The reason for this is simple: theta roles typically reference thematic relations. In particular, theta roles are often referred to by the most prominent thematic relation in them. For example, a common theta role is the primary or external argument. Typically, although not always, this theta role maps to a noun phrase which bears an agent thematic relation. As such, the theta role is called the &quot;agent&quot; theta role. This often leads to confusion between the two notions. The two concepts, however, can be distinguished in a number of ways.

*Thematic relations express the semantic relations that the entities denoted by the noun phrases bear towards the action or state denoted by the verb. By contrast, theta roles are syntactic notions about the number, type and placement of obligatory arguments. For instance, in the sentence &quot;Fergus ate the kibble&quot;, the fact that 
** there are two arguments (&quot;Fergus&quot; and &quot;the kibble&quot;), and 
** Fergus must be capable of volition and of doing the action, and 
** the kibble must be something that can be eaten 
:is a fact about theta roles (the number and types of the arguments). The actual semantic type of the argument is described by the thematic relation. 
*Not all theoretical approaches use theta roles. Theta roles are largely limited to the Chomskyan versions of generative grammar and lexical functional grammar. Many other approaches, such as functional grammar and dependency grammar, refer to thematic relations directly without an intermediate step in theta roles. 
*Only arguments of the verb bear theta roles; optional adjunct modifiers—even if they are prepositional phrases (PPs) such as &quot;on Friday&quot; or noun phrases (NPs) like &quot;yesterday&quot;—don&#x27;t take theta roles. But almost all NPs (except expletives) express thematic relations. 
*An argument can bear only one theta role, but can take multiple thematic relations. For example, in &quot;Susan gave Bill the paper&quot;, &quot;Susan&quot; bears both Agent and Source thematic relations, but it only bears one theta role (the external &quot;agent&quot; role).
*Thematic relations are properties of nouns and noun phrases. Theta roles can be assigned to any argument including noun phrases, prepositional phrases and embedded clauses. Thematic relations are not assigned to embedded clauses, and prepositions typically mark the thematic relation on an NP.

One common way of thinking about theta roles is that they are bundles of thematic relations associated with a particular argument position .

== Theta grids and the theta criterion ==

Theta roles are stored in a verb&#x27;s &quot;theta grid&quot;. Grids typically come in two forms. The simplest and easiest to type is written as an ordered list between angle brackets. The argument associated with the external argument position (which typically ends up being the subject in active sentences) is written first and underlined. The theta roles are named by the most prominent thematic relation that they contain. In this notation, the theta grid for a verb such as &quot;give&quot; is &lt;agent, theme, goal&gt;.

The other notation (see for example the textbook examples in and ) separates the theta roles into boxes, in which each column represents a theta role. The top row represents the names of the thematic relations contained in the theta role. In some work (e.g., ), this box also contains information about the category associated with the theta role. This mingles theta-theory with the notion of subcategorization. The bottom row gives a series of indexes which are associated with subscripted markers in the sentence itself which indicate that the NPs they are attached to have been assigned the theta role in question.

When applied to the sentence [S[NP Susan]i gave [NP the food]j [PPto Biff]k] the indices mark that &quot;Susan&quot; is assigned the external theta role of agent/source, &quot;the food&quot; is assigned the theme role, and &quot;to Biff&quot; is assigned the goal role.

The theta criterion (or &quot;θ-criterion&quot;) is the formal device in Government and Binding Theory for enforcing the one to one match between arguments and theta roles. This acts as a filter on the D-structure of the sentence. If an argument fails to have the correct match between the number of arguments (typically NPs, PPs, or embedded clauses) and the number of theta roles, the sentence will be ungrammatical or unparseable. Chomsky&#x27;s formulation is:

The theta criterion Each argument bears one and only one θ-role, and each θ-role is assigned to one and only one argument.

Although it is often not explicitly stated, adjuncts are excluded from the theta criterion.

== Thematic hierarchies ==

Drawing on observations based in typological cross-linguistic comparisons of languages , linguists in the relational grammar (RG) tradition (e.g. ) observed that particular thematic relations and theta roles map on to particular positions in the sentence. For example, in unmarked situations agents map to subject positions, themes onto object position, and goals onto indirect objects. In RG, this is encoded in the Universal Alignment Hypothesis (or UAH), where the thematic relations are mapped directly into argument position based on the following hierarchy: Agent &lt; Theme &lt; Experiencer &lt; Others. Mark Baker adopted this idea into GB theory in the form of the Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis (or UTAH) . UTAH explains how identical thematic relationships between items are shown by identical structural relationships. A different approach to the correspondence is given in and , where there are no such things as underlying theta roles or even thematic relations. Instead, the interpretive component of the grammar identifies the semantic role of an argument based on its position in the tree.

== Argument structure in other formal approaches ==

===Lexical-functional grammar (LFG)===
Lexical-functional grammar (LFG) and is perhaps the most similar to Chomskyan approaches in implementing theta-roles. However, LFG uses three distinct layers of structure for representing the relations or functions of arguments: θ-structure, a-structure (argument structure) and f-structure (functional structure) which expresses grammatical relations. These three layers are linked together using a set of intricate linking principles. Thematic relations in the θ-structure are mapped onto a set of positions in the a-structure which are tied to features [+o] (roughly &quot;object&quot;) and [±r] (roughly &quot;restricted&quot; meaning it is marked explicitly by a preposition or a case marking). Themes map to [-r], second themes map to [+o] and non-themes map to [-o]. These features then determine how the arguments are mapped to specific grammatical functions in the sentence. The first [-o] argument is mapped to the SUBJ (subject) relation. If there is no [-o] argument then the first [-r] argument is mapped to the SUBJ relation. If neither of these apply, then you add the plus value ([+r] or [+o]) to the feature structure and apply the following mappings: [-o,-r]: SUBJ, [+o, -r]: Object (OBJ), [-o,+r]: prepositional marked oblique (OBLθ), [+o, +r]: prepositionally marked object (OBJθ). These mappings are further constrained by the following constraints:

 Function argument biuniqueness: Each a-structure role corresponds to a unique f-structure function, and each f-structure function corresponds to a unique a-structure role 

 The Subject Condition: Every verb must have a SUBJ

F-structures are further constrained by the following two constraints which do much of the same labor as the θ-criterion:

 Coherence requires that every participant in the f-structure of a sentence must be mentioned in a-structure (or in a constituting equation) of a predicate in its clause. 

 Completeness: An f-structure for a sentence must contain values for all the grammatical functions mentioned in a-structure. 

===Head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG)===
Head-driven phrase structure grammar (HPSG) (for a textbook introduction, see ) does not use theta roles per se, but divides their property into two distinct feature structures. The number and category are indicated by a feature called ARG-STR. This feature is an ordered list of categories that must cooccur with a particular verb or predicate. For example, the ARG-STR list of the verb &quot;give&quot; is &lt;NP, NP, PP&gt;. The semantic part of theta roles (i.e. the thematic relations) are treated in a special set of semantic restriction (RESTR) features. These typically express the semantic properties more directly than thematic relations. For example, the semantic relations associated with the arguments of the verb &quot;give&quot; are not agent, theme and goal, but giver, given, givee.

===Approaches that eschew theta roles ===
Many approaches to grammar including construction grammar and the Simpler Syntax model (see also Jackendoff&#x27;s earlier work on argument structure and semantics, including and ) claim that theta roles (and thematic relations) are neither a good way to represent the syntactic argument structure of predicates nor of the semantic properties that they reveal. They argue for more complex and articulated semantic structures (often called Lexical-conceptual structures) which map onto the syntactic structure.

Similarly, most typological approaches to grammar, functionalist theories (such as functional grammar and Role and Reference Grammar , and dependency grammar do not use theta roles, but they may make reference to thematic relations and grammatical relations or their notational equivalents. These are usually related to one another directly using principles of mapping.

<text>Ratu Ovini Bokini Ratu (3 November 1944 – 15 January 2009) was a Fijian chief and political leader. Bokini, who held the chiefly title of &quot;Tui Tavua&quot;, succeeded Ratu Epeli Ganilau as Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs on 21 July 2004, and was re-elected to this post for a full three-year term on 27 July 2005.

A formal gathering of mostly traditional chiefs chosen by the country&#x27;s 14 provincial councils, along with some appointees of the national government and the Council of Rotuma, the Great Council of Chiefs functioned as an electoral college to select Fiji&#x27;s President, along with 14 of the 32 members of the Senate. Informally, the Council advised the Fijian government on every aspect of political life. Although not mandated by the Constitution, the chairman&#x27;s role was therefore a very influential one.

During late April 2007, all members of G.C.C were suspended by the Interim Prime Minister, Frank Bainimarama. The suspension included the chairman, Ovini Bokini and all other members of G.C.C after the President&#x27;s nomination for the Vice-President position was rejected by some G.C.C members.

== Unusual appointment ==
Bokini was chosen to fill this position after his predecessor, Ratu Epeli Ganilau, had become embroiled in political controversy, calling for the resignation of the then-Vice-President, Jope Seniloli (who has since been convicted of treason for his role in the coup d&#x27;état that deposed the elected government in 2000), and proposing the revival of the country&#x27;s former ruling political party, the Alliance Party, as a multi-racial party, hinting that he would play a role in it. Many politicians feared that Ganilau was compromising the neutrality of the Council, and it is thought that government pressure played a role in the decision of the Cakaudrove Provincial Council to replace him as their representative with someone less controversial. Without membership of the Council, Ganilau was ineligible to serve as its chairman.

The sentencing of Vice-President Seniloli to four years&#x27; imprisonment for treason on 6 August 2004 created fears of a possible power vacuum should anything happen to the ailing 83-year-old President, Josefa Iloilo. Constitutional experts, however, said that as Chairman of the Great Council of Chiefs, Bokini could choose to assume the role of Vice-President in an interim capacity. Seniloli resigned on 29 November, paving the way for President Iloilo to nominate, and the Great Council to approve, Joni Madraiwiwi as the new Vice-President on 15 December.

== Position on the Unity Bill ==
On 18 May 2005, Bokini complained that the Great Council of Chiefs had not been consulted, or even officially informed, about the government&#x27;s controversial legislation to establish a Reconciliation and Unity Commission with the power, subject to presidential approval, to compensate victims and pardon perpetrators of the 2000 coup. Attempts by the Great Council to obtain a copy of the bill for study and discussion had come to nothing, he said. On 30 May, in a speech to mark Ratu Sukuna Day in honour of Fiji&#x27;s first modern statesman, Lala Sukuna, he cautioned that reconciliation was not something that could be forced or one-sided. &quot;It must be allowed to grow through a shared understanding of what we all want and where we are all heading,&quot; he said. Only with good leadership and the support and goodwill of other ethnic groups could indigenous Fijians seriously negotiate about what to give and what to take – a process that would take time and patience. He proposed the Fijian language as a common bond to unite Fiji&#x27;s diverse ethnic communities, saying that especially in rural areas, Fijian was widely used as a common language.

Later, however, he came out strongly in favour of the Unity Bill.

== 2006 coup d&#x27;état ==
Bokini condemned the 2006 Fijian coup d&#x27;état, which overthrew the government of Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase. Bokini said that the Great Council of Chiefs would refuse to recognise the interim government appointed by the Republic of Fiji Military Forces. He angrily denounced his predecessor, Epeli Ganilau, who claimed to sympathise with the motives though not the method of the coup, for claiming to be mediating between the Great Council of Chiefs and the Military. &quot;I never made a request to meet the commander. Whoever said that is lying. I don&#x27;t intend to see the commander. He has to make a request to me if he wants to meet me,&quot; Bokini declared. On 7 December 300 villagers blocked the entrance to Tavualevu Village, in response to a rumour that the military was coming to arrest Bokini, a rumour the army quickly denied.

== Background and career ==

Bokini hailed from the village of Tavualevu and held the chiefly title of &quot;Tui Tavua&quot;, as Paramount Chief of the Tavua District of Ba Province. He was the son of Ratu Etuate Bokini and Sereima Lalavanua. He held various positions of employment in the Fiji Sugar Corporation before joining Fiji&#x27;s House of Representatives. He was a member of the House of Representatives in the 1990s, and also served in the Cabinet, holding a variety of portfolios. In addition to chairing the Great Council of Chiefs, he has also served as Chairman of the Ba Provincial Council.

Bokini was married to Tavo Bokini, with whom he had four children. He died on 15 January 2009 at his home in Tavua.

<text>Nahdlatul Ulama (, , NU) is an Islamic organization in Indonesia. Its membership numbered over 40 million in 2023, making it the largest Islamic organization in the world. NU is also a charitable body funding schools and hospitals as well as organizing communities to help alleviate poverty.

The NU was founded in 1926 by the &quot;ulema&quot; and merchants to defend both traditionalist Islamic practices (in accordance with Shafi&#x27;i school) and its members&#x27; economic interests. NU&#x27;s religious views are considered &quot;traditionalist&quot; in that it accepts local cultural traditions that do not conflict with Islamic law (in contrast to Islamic fundamentalist groups). By contrast, the second largest Islamic organization in Indonesia, the Muhammadiyah, is considered &quot;reformist&quot; as it takes a more literal interpretation of the Qur&#x27;an and Sunnah.

Many leaders of Nahdlatul Ulama are ardent advocates of Islam Nusantara, a distinctive variety of Islam that has undergone interaction, contextualization, indigenization, interpretation, and vernacularization according to socio-cultural conditions in Indonesia. Islam Nusantara promotes moderation, anti-fundamentalism, pluralism, and a degree of syncretism. Some NU elders, leaders, and religious scholars, however, have rejected Islam Nusantara in favor of a more conservative approach.

==Ideology==

Nahdlatul Ulama follows the Ashʿari and Maturidi schools, taking the middle path between aqli (rationalist) and naqli (scripturalist) tendencies. The organization identifies the Quran, the Sunnah, and the abilities of the mind coupled with empirical reality as the sources of its thought. It attributes this approach to earlier thinkers such as Abu al-Hasan al-Ash&#x27;ari and Abu Mansur al-Maturidi in the field of theology.

In the field of jurisprudence, it recognizes the Hanafi, Maliki, Shafi&#x27;i, and Hanbali schools of law, but relies in practice on Shafi&#x27;i teachings. Regarding Sufism, NU follows the path of al-Ghazali and al-Junayd al-Baghdadi. It has been described by Western media as a progressive, liberal, and pluralistic Islamic movement, but is a diverse organization with large conservative factions, as well.

The Nahdlatul Ulama has stated that it is not tied to any political organization.

==History==

===Origin===
NU was established in 1926 as an organization for orthodox Ash&#x27;ari Muslims scholars, as opposed to the modernist policies of the Muhammadiyah and PERSIS (organization), and the rise of Salafi movement of the Al-Irshad Al-Islamiya organization in Indonesia, which rejected local customs influenced by pre-Islamic Javanese Hindus and Buddhist traditions at all. The organization was established after The Committee of Hijaz had fulfilled its duty and about to be dissolved. The organization was established by Hasyim Asy&#x27;ari, the head of an Islamic religious school in East Java. The organization expanded, but the base of its support remained in East Java. By 1928, the NU was using the Javanese language in its sermons, alongside Arabic.

In 1937, despite poor relations between the NU and other Sunni Islam organizations in Indonesia, the organizations established the Supreme Islamic Council of Indonesia () as a discussion forum. They were joined by most of the other Islamic organizations in existence at the time. In 1942, the Japanese occupied Indonesia and in September a conference of Islamic leaders was held in Jakarta.

The Japanese wanted to replace the MIAI, but the conference not only decided to maintain the organization, but also elected political figures belonging to the PSII to the leadership, rather than members of the non-political NU or Muhammadiyah as the occupiers had wanted. Just over a year later, the MIAI was dissolved and replaced by the Japanese-sponsored Masyumi (Consultative Council of Indonesian Muslims). Hasjim Asjari was the notional chairman, but in practice the new organization was led by his son, Wahid Hasyim. Other NU and Muhammadiyah figures held leadership positions.

In 1945, Sukarno and Hatta declared Indonesian independence, which NU supported.

During the early months of the Indonesian National Revolution the NU declared on October 22, 1945, that the fight against the Dutch colonial forces was a holy war, obligatory for all Muslims of the nation (this day is since 2015 honored as National Santri Day). Among the guerrilla groups fighting for independence were Hizbullah and Sabillilah, which were led by the NU.

===Transformation into Islamic political party===
Following the recognition of Indonesian independence, a new party called Masyumi was established with the NU as a component of it. The NU leadership at the time had no political skills, and was awarded few influential cabinet positions, with the exception of chairman Wahid Hasyim, who was appointed religious affairs minister. The NU was unhappy with its lack of influence within Masyumi, especially after a decision at the 1949 party conference changed the party&#x27;s religious council, on which the NU held several positions, into a powerless advisory body.

Two years later, a dispute over the organization of the Haj pilgrimage led to Prime Minister Natsir&#x27;s opposition to the reappointment of Hasyim as religious affairs minister in the next cabinet. In the ensuing cabinet crisis, the NU made a series of demands, including the retention of Hasyim, and threatened to leave Masyumi. On 5 April 1952, a few days after the announcement of a new cabinet without Hasyim, the NU decided in principle to leave Masyumi. Three months later it withdrew all its members from Masyumi councils, and on 30 August it established the Indonesian League of Muslims, comprising the NU, PSSI and a number of smaller organizations. It was chaired by Hasyim.

During the liberal democracy era (1950–1957), NU members served in a number of cabinet posts. In the first Ali Sastroamidjojo Cabinet, the NU held three seats, with Zainul Arifin appointed second deputy prime minister. However, following the fall of this cabinet, some NU members were opposed to the NU joining the new cabinet, to be formed by Burhanuddin Harahap Cabinet, believing that if he was unable to form a cabinet, the NU would be invited to try. It was finally pressured into participating, and was awarded the interior and religious affairs portfolios in the cabinet, which was sworn in on 12 August 1955.

On 29 September 1955, Indonesia held its first parliamentary elections. The NU came in third, with almost 7 million votes, 18.4% of the total, behind the Indonesian National Party and Masyumi. It was awarded 45 seats in the People&#x27;s Representative Council, up from only eight before the election. The NU was the largest party in its East Java base, and 85.6% of its vote came from Java. There was a clear division between Masyumi, representing outer-island, urban voters and the NU, representing the rural Javanese constituency. Three months later, elections were held for the Constitutional Assembly, which was tasked with drawing up a permanent constitution. The results were very similar, with the NU winning 91 of the 514 seats.

In the 1950s, the NU still wanted to see Indonesia become an Islamic state, and expressed its disapproval of a 1953 presidential speech in which Sukarno rejected this. Three years later, it also argued against Sukarno&#x27;s &quot;conception&quot; that would eventually lead to the establishment of guided democracy, as this would mean PKI members sitting in the cabinet. On 2 March 1957, the Permesta rebellion broke out. Among its demands was the restoration of Mohammad Hatta to the vice-presidency. The NU supported these calls.

Meanwhile, in the Constitutional Assembly, the NU joined Masyumi, the Indonesian Islamic Union Party (PSII), the Islamic Education Movement (Perti) and other parties to form the Islamic Block, which wanted Indonesian to become an Islamic state. The block made up 44.8% of total seats. However, with none of the blocks able to command a majority and push through the constitution it wanted, the assembly failed to agree and was dissolved by Sukarno in a decree on 5 July 1959 that also restored the original 1945 Constitution, which declared the state to be based on the Pancasila philosophy, not Islam.

In 1960, President Sukarno banned Masyumi for alleged involvement in the Permesta rebellion. However, the leadership of NU saw the pro-poor Communist Party of Indonesia, which was close to Sukarno, as an obstacle to its ambitions, and competed with it to win support from the poor. Five years later, the coup attempt by the 30 September Movement took place. In 1965, the group took sides with the General Suharto-led army and was heavily involved in the mass killings of Indonesian communists. However, the NU later began to oppose Suharto&#x27;s regime.

In 1984, Abdurrahman Wahid, the grandson of NU founder Hasyim Asy&#x27;ari, inherited the leadership from his father, and was later elected President of Indonesia in 1999. He formally apologized for NU&#x27;s involvement in the events of 1965. He also stated that &quot;Nadhatul Ulama (NU) is like Shiite minus Imamah; similarly Shiite is NU plus Imamah.&quot; There have been many similarities between the two, such as the position and role of kyai. The main contrast between them is that in NU, the concept is visible in the form of accepted culture, while in Shia, it takes the form of theology.

Following the deposing of Sukarno, the New Order regime under President Suharto held elections in 1971. Despite manipulation of the NU by the government, which caused it to lose much credibility, the NU managed to maintain its 18% share of the vote from the 1955 poll. However, in 1973, it was obliged to &quot;fuse&quot; into the new United Development Party (). The PPP came second, after the government sponsored Golkar organization in the elections of 1977 and 1982, but in 1984, the new NU chairman Abdurrahman Wahid (also known as &quot;Gus Dur&quot;), the son of Wahid Hasyim, withdrew the NU from the PPP because of dissatisfaction with the NU&#x27;s lack of influence. As a result, in the 1987 election, the PPP vote collapsed from 28% in 1982 to only 16%. From then on, it was expected that the NU would concentrate on religious and social activities.

===Outside politics===
In 1984, the New Order government announced that all organizations would have to accept state ideology Pancasila as their basis. Once again the NU was accommodating, with Gus Dur calling Pancasila a &quot;noble compromise&quot; for Muslims. Five years later. Gus Dur was reelected for a second five-year term as chairman, a position he held until being elected president in 1999.

In 1990, the NU worked with Bank Summa to establish a system of rural banks. Suharto did not approve of the NU straying beyond purely religious activities, and the fact the bank was owned by a Christian ethnic-Chinese family led to controversy. The bank was eventually shut down two years later because of financial mismanagement. Gus Dur also incurred the disapproval of the regime by holding a mass rally at a Jakarta stadium three months before the 1992 legislative elections, ostensibly to express support for Pancasila.

This resulted in Gus Dur being invited to meet Lt. Col. Prabowo Subianto, Suharto&#x27;s son-in-law at Jakarta Military Headquarters. At the meeting, Gus Dur was warned to avoid unacceptable political conduct, and told that if he insisted in involving himself in politics, rather than confining himself to religious matters, he should express support for a further presidential term for Suharto. In response, Gus Dur threatened to leave the NU. This resulted in the regime backing down, as it could not risk bringing Gus Dur down.

===Post-New Order era===
During the fall of Suharto, Nahdlatul Ulama members and Islamic clerics were killed by rioters in Banyuwangi in East Java when a witchhunt against alleged sorcerers spiralled out of control. Following the fall of Suharto and his replacement by Vice-president B. J. Habibie, in July 1998 Gus Dur announced the establishment of the National Awakening Party (). On 10 November, Gus Dur met with other pro-reform figures Amien Rais, Megawati Sukarnoputri and Sultan Hamengkubuwono. The so-called Ciganjur Four, named after the location of Gus Dur&#x27;s house, issued a declaration calling the Habibie administration &quot;transitional&quot; and calling for elections to be brought forward and for the Indonesian Military to end its political role.

In Indonesia&#x27;s first free elections since 1955, held on 7 June 1999, the PKB won 13 percent of the vote. In the ensuing session of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly, Gus Dur was elected President of Indonesia, defeating Megawati by 373 votes to 313. However, he was deposed just two years later. The PKB subsequently split into two warring factions, one led by Gus Dur&#x27;s daughter, Yenny Wahid. An attempt in 2008 by Gus Dur to involve President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono in resolving the dispute failed, and the PKB vote in the 2009 elections was half that of the previous vote in 2004. At its 2010 conference, held in Makassar, the NU decided not to discuss the split, and passed a resolution banning officials from holding political posts, seen as a commitment to avoiding future political involvement.

After the conference, concerns about the longer term role of the NU continued to attract comment in the national media. During 2011, for example, there was continuing discussion about the national role that the NU should play and about the close political links between the NU and the National Awakening Party (PKB). Comments by Yenny Wahid, for example, reflected these concerns when she said that the NU was fragmenting and &quot;sliding into irrelevance&quot;.

==Aims==

The NU exists to spread Islamic teaching. As well as preaching, it undertakes educational activities through its network of 6,830 Islamic boarding schools (or &quot;pesantren&quot;). It also owns 44 universities; is involved in economic and agricultural studies; and provides social services such as family planning. Its goal is &quot;to spread messages about a tolerant Islam in their respective countries to curb radicalism, extremism and terrorism,&quot; which, it claims, &quot;often spring from a misinterpretation of Islamic teachings.&quot;

In December 2014, NU launched a global campaign against extremism and jihadism. Alongside NU theologians, the group built a prevention center in Indonesia to train Arabic-speaking students to combat jihadist rhetoric. Additionally, NU created a joint program with the University of Vienna entitled &quot;VORTEX&quot; (Vienna Observatory for Applied Research on Radicalism and Extremism). The project is funded by the Indonesian Ministry of Internal Security. It also launched an American nonprofit organization called Bayt ar-Rahmah in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. On the other hand, Nahdlatul Ulama leaders gave a fatwa in favor of female genital mutilation (FGM). In 2019, NU called for the abolishment of the term &quot;kafir&quot; to describe non-Muslims.

==Leaders==
The highest body in the NU is its Syuriah (Supreme Council). Under this is the Tanfidziyah (Executive Council); the Mustasyar (Advisory Council) provides input to both. At the 2010 NU Conference, Sahal Mahfudh was elected chairman of the Executive Council, and thus serves as executive chief. At the same conference, Sahal Mahfudz was elected chair of the Supreme Council for the 2010-2015 period. Under the Executive Council, there are province-level Regional Boards, autonomous bodies, institutes, and committees, with the structure extending down to Sub-Branch Representative Council Boards in villages.

<text>Tikkun was a quarterly progressive Jewish and interfaith magazine and website published in the United States that analyzed American and Israeli culture, politics, religion, and history in the English language. The magazine consistently published the work of Israeli and Palestinian left-wing intellectuals, but also included book and music reviews, personal essays, and poetry.

In 2006 and 2011, the magazine was awarded the &quot;Independent Press Award for Best Spiritual Coverage&quot; by &quot;Utne Reader&quot; for its analysis of the inability of many progressives to understand people&#x27;s yearning for faith and the American fundamentalists&#x27; political influence on the international conflict among religious zealots.

The magazine was founded in 1986 by Michael Lerner and his then-wife, Nan Fink Gefen. From 2012 onward, its publisher was Duke University Press. Beyt Tikkun Synagogue, with Michael Lerner as its rabbi, was loosely affiliated with &quot;Tikkun&quot; magazine. It described itself as a &quot;hallachic community bound by Jewish law&quot;.

In April 2024, the magazine announced it was ceasing publication due to a lack of funding and the poor health of Lerner (who could not find a successor).

==Origin and meaning of the name==
The magazine&#x27;s title came from mystical Hebrew concept &quot;tikkun olam&quot; (; &quot;healing or restoring the world&quot;), emphasizing both humanity&#x27;s and God&#x27;s co-responsibility &quot;to heal, repair and transform the world&quot;.

==Publisher==
Initially, Nan Fink Gefen, at the time married to Lerner, devoted financial resources and served as a hands-on publisher until she left as their marriage ended in 1991. In 1997 a fellow 1960s-activist Danny Goldberg, a major music industry figure heavily involved in the ACLU, became co-publisher with his father, Victor. During these years, prominent journalists such as Jack Newfield interviewed national and international leaders such as Mario Cuomo and Haiti&#x27;s embattled President Aristide to bring more credibility to the growing influence of the magazine. From 2001 through 2010, Lerner&#x27;s sister, Trish Vradenburg, and her husband George Vradenburg served as co-publishers.

==Editorial policy==
Founded in 1986, the magazine&#x27;s editorial policy was shaped by Nan Fink Gefen, Michael Lerner, and Peter Gabel. According to the founding editorial statement, political concerns of the 1960s civil rights, anti-war, and feminist movements and psychological studies of workers in the 1970s and 1980s were their most direct influences. Among authors who contributed to the magazine&#x27;s interfaith character were the historian Christopher Lasch, philosopher Cornel West, and Harvey Cox of Harvard Divinity School.

Obliquely confronting more conservative American Jewish community&#x27;s Commentary Magazine, which caused some members of the Editorial Board, including Elie Wiesel, to resign, the magazine introduced itself with prominent ads placed in leading intellectual papers and journals declaring a new voice for the Jewish Left. Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel&#x27;s legacy of &quot;prophetic&quot; Jewish activism has been honored and analyzed from the first issue onward. In every issue, it was stated that its articles &quot;do not necessarily reflect &quot;Tikkun&#x27;s&quot; position on any issue&quot;, and its editor, Rabbi Michael Lerner, has written that he &quot;often consciously seeks to print articles with which he disagrees&quot;.

==&quot;Network of Spiritual Progressives&quot;==
In 2001 the magazine&#x27;s interfaith activist community&#x27;s website, the &quot;Network of Spiritual Progressives&quot;, initially named the &quot;Tikkun Community&quot;, was established by founders that include Sister Joan Chittister, a Benedictine nun, and Cornel West, a Princeton University professor of religion, in order to engage readers in broader activism and broaden the magazine&#x27;s appeal to non-Jewish readers. Challenging the anti-religious and anti-spiritual biases within liberal culture and &quot;replacing world domination with generosity&quot; are among the ideas that are supported by the community.

==Reception==
In her book, &quot;If I Am Not For Myself: The Liberal Betrayal of the Jews&quot;, American conservative author Ruth Wisse argues that &quot;Tikkun&quot; is one of a group of left-of-center Jewish organizations and publications founded in the 1980s without explaining why a new, Jewish publication was needed to cover issues already covered by such existing publications as Dissent. Wisse argues that the actual motivation was a need felt by highly educated Jews to counter rising antisemitism on the left by means of &quot;public avowals of kindliness and liberalism.&quot;

===Accusations of antisemitism===
In 2005 Manfred Gerstenfeld cited an article published by &quot;Tikkun&quot; — Joel Kovel’s &quot;On Left Anti-Semitism and the Special Status of Israel&quot; (May/June 2003) — as one of two examples of &quot;essays of Jewish authors using anti-Semitic arguments&quot;. In his article, Kovel described Israel as a racist state that &quot;automatically generates crimes against humanity and lacks the internal means of correcting them&quot;, adding that such a state &quot;cannot have that legitimacy which gives it the right to exist&quot;.

In a 2006 column, Alan Dershowitz wrote that &quot;&quot;Tikkun&quot; is quickly becoming the most virulently anti-Israel screed ever published under Jewish auspices&quot; and that &quot;support for &quot;Tikkun&quot; is support for the enemies of Israel&quot;. Dershowitz and his books have been the targets of criticism in the pages of &quot;Tikkun&quot; (for example: May/June 1997, September/October 1997, November/December 1997, January/February 1999).

===Improprieties regarding letters to the editor===
In 1997 former &quot;Tikkun&quot; editors accused Lerner of publishing pseudonymous letters to the editor that he himself had written. While many of the letters were laudatory (&quot;Your editorial stand on Iraq said publicly what many of us in the Israeli peace camp are feeling privately but dare not say.&quot;), a few were critical (&quot;Have you gone off your rocker?&quot;). Lerner admitted that he had written the letters but said his only mistake was not informing readers that the authors&#x27; names were pseudonyms.

== Contributors ==
Notable contributors have included Sidra DeKoven Ezrahi, Everett Gendler, Arthur Waskow, and Jeremy Ben-Ami.

=== Notable interviews ===

* Noam Chomsky
* Ehud Barak
* Nicholas Kristof
* Jim Moran

== Awards ==
Tikkun won the Magazine of the Year: Overall Excellence award from the Religion Newswriters Association in 2014 and 2015. The magazine also received the Simon Rockower Award for Excellence in Special Sections or Supplements in 2009.

<doc id="906754" wikidata="Q1294648" url="?curid=906754" title="Etchmiadzin Cathedral">
<text>Etchmiadzin Cathedral () is the mother church of the Armenian Apostolic Church, located in the city dually known as Etchmiadzin (Ejmiatsin) and Vagharshapat, Armenia. It is usually considered the first cathedral built in ancient Armenia, and often regarded as the oldest cathedral in the world.

The original church was built in the early fourth century—between 301 and 303 according to tradition—by Armenia&#x27;s patron saint Gregory the Illuminator, following the adoption of Christianity as a state religion by King Tiridates III. It was built over a pagan temple, symbolizing the conversion from paganism to Christianity. The core of the current building was built in 483/4 by Vahan Mamikonian after the cathedral was severely damaged in a Persian invasion. From its foundation until the second half of the fifth century, Etchmiadzin was the seat of the Catholicos, the supreme head of the Armenian Church.

Although never losing its significance, the cathedral subsequently suffered centuries of virtual neglect. In 1441 it was restored as catholicosate and remains as such to this day. Since then the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin has been the administrative headquarters of the Armenian Church. Etchmiadzin was plundered by Shah Abbas I of Persia in 1604, when relics and stones were taken out of the cathedral to New Julfa in an effort to undermine Armenians&#x27; attachment to their land. Since then the cathedral has undergone a number of renovations. Belfries were added in the latter half of the seventeenth century and in 1868 a sacristy (museum and room of relics) was constructed at the cathedral&#x27;s east end. Today, it incorporates styles of different periods of Armenian architecture. Diminished during the early Soviet period, Etchmiadzin revived again in the second half of the twentieth century, and under independent Armenia.

As the center of Armenian Christianity, Etchmiadzin has been an important location in Armenia not only religiously, but also politically and culturally. A major pilgrimage site, it is one of the most visited places in the country. Along with several important early medieval churches located nearby, the cathedral was listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2000.

==Setting==
The cathedral is located at the center of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin, the administrative headquarters of the Armenian Apostolic Church, in the town dually known as Vagharshapat or Etchmiadzin (Ejmiatsin). For much of its history, the complex around the cathedral, which includes the residence of the Catholicos (patriarch), was known as the Monastery of Etchmiadzin. It was formerly surrounded by high walls, made of brick or cob, and had eight circular towers (turrets). Its external appearance led 19th century visitors to widely compare it to a fortress. The walled monastery, a vast quadrangular enclosure, could have been accessed through four gates.

The cathedral stood—and continues to stand—at the center of a courtyard (a quadrangle), which by Lynch&#x27;s measurements in the 1890s, was by , making it larger than the Trinity Great Court in Cambridge, England. He suggested that it may have been at the time the largest quadrangle in the world.

== History ==
=== Foundation and etymology ===
In the early fourth century the Kingdom of Armenia, under Tiridates III, become the first country in the world to adopt Christianity as a state religion. Armenian church tradition places the cathedral&#x27;s foundation between 301 and 303. It was built near the royal palace in what was then the Armenian capital of Vagharshapat, on the site of a pagan temple, which was dated by Alexander Sahinian to the Urartian period. Although no historical sources point to a pre-Christian place of worship in its place, a granite Urartian stele dated to the 8th-6th centuries BC was excavated under the main altar in the 1950s. Also excavated under the altar was an amphora, which has been interpreted to have been a part of a fire temple.

In his &quot;History of the Armenians&quot;, Agathangelos narrates the legend of the cathedral&#x27;s foundation. Armenia&#x27;s patron saint Gregory the Illuminator had a divine vision descending from heaven and striking the earth with a golden hammer to show where the cathedral should be built. Later tradition associated the figure with Jesus Christ, hence the name of Etchmiadzin (էջ &quot;ēĵ&quot; &quot;descent&quot; + մի &quot;mi&quot; &quot;only&quot; + -ա- &quot;-a-&quot; (linking element) + ծին &quot;tsin&quot; &quot;begotten&quot;), which translates to &quot;the Descent of the Only-Begotten &quot; or &quot;Descended the Only Begotten&quot;. However, the name Etchmiadzin did not come into use until the 15th century, while earlier sources call it &quot;Cathedral of Vagharshapat.&quot; The Feast of the Cathedral of Holy Etchmiadzin (Տոն Կաթողիկե Սբ. Էջմիածնի) is celebrated by the Armenian Church 64 days after Easter, during which a hymn, written by the 8th century Catholicos Sahak III, retelling St. Gregory&#x27;s vision, is sung.

Malachia Ormanian suggested that the cathedral was built in 303 within seven months because the building was not huge and probably, partially made of wood. He also argued that the foundation of the preexisting temple could have been preserved. Vahagn Grigoryan dismisses these dates as implausible and states that at least several years were needed for its construction. He cites Agathangelos, who does not mention the cathedral in an episode that took place in 306 and suggests the usage of the span of 302 to 325—the reign of Gregory the Illuminator as Catholicos as the dates of the cathedral&#x27;s construction.

Archaeological excavations in 1955–56 and 1959, led by Alexander Sahinian, uncovered the remains of the original fourth-century building, including two levels of pillar bases below the current ones and a narrower altar apse under the present one. Based on these findings, Sahinian asserted that the original church had been a three-naved vaulted basilica, similar to the basilicas of Tekor, Ashtarak and Aparan (Kasagh). However, other scholars, have rejected Sahinian&#x27;s view. Among them, Suren Yeremian and Armen Khatchatrian held that the original church had been in the form of a rectangle with a dome supported by four pillars. Stepan Mnatsakanian suggested that the original building had been a &quot;canopy erected on a cross [plan],&quot; while Vahagn Grigoryan proposes what Mnatsakanian describes as an &quot;extreme view,&quot; that the cathedral has been essentially in the same form as it is today.

=== Reconstruction and decline ===

According to Faustus of Byzantium, the cathedral and the city of Vagharshapat were almost completely destroyed during the invasion of Sasanian King Shapur II in the 360s (circa 363). Due to Armenia&#x27;s unfavorable economic conditions, the cathedral was renovated only partially by Catholicoi Nerses the Great (r. 353–373) and Sahak Parthev (r. 387–439).

In 387, Armenia was partitioned between the Roman and Sasanian Empires. Etchmiadzin became part of the Persian-controlled east, under the rule of Armenian vassal kings until 428, when the Armenian Kingdom was dissolved. In 450, in an attempt to impose Zoroastrianism on Armenians, Sasanian King Yazdegerd II built a fire temple inside the cathedral. The pyre of the fire temple was unearthed under the altar of the east apse during the excavations in the 1950s.

By the last quarter of the fifth century the cathedral was dilapidated. According to Ghazar Parpetsi, it was rebuilt from the foundations by &quot;marzban&quot; (governor) of Persian Armenia Vahan Mamikonian in 483/4, when the country was relatively stable, following the struggle for religious freedom against Persia. Most researchers have concluded that, thus, the church was converted into cruciform church and mostly took its current form. The new church was very different from the original one and &quot;consisted of quadric-apsidal hall built of dull, grey stone containing four free-standing cross-shaped pillars disdained to support a stone cupola.&quot; The new cathedral was &quot;in the form of a square enclosing a Greek cross and contains two chapels, one on either side of the east apse.&quot;

Although the seat of the Catholicos was transferred to Dvin sometime in the 460s–470s or 484, the cathedral never lost its significance and remained &quot;one of the greatest shrines of the Armenian Church.&quot; The last known renovations until the 15th century were made by Catholicos Komitas in 618 (according to Sebeos) and Catholicos Nerses III (r. 640–661). In 982 the cross of the cathedral was reportedly removed by an Arab emir.

Over the course of these centuries of neglect, the cathedral deteriorated to such an extent that it inspired the renowned archbishop Stepanos Orbelian to compose one of his better known poems, &quot;Lament on Behalf of the Cathedral&quot;, in 1300. In the poem, which tells about the consequences of the Mongol and Mamluk invasions of Armenia and Cilicia, Orbelian portrays Etchmiadzin Cathedral &quot;as a woman in mourning, contemplating her former splendor and exhorting her children to return to their homeland [...] and restore its glory.&quot;

=== From revival to plunder ===
Following the fall of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia in 1375, the See of Sis experienced decline and disarray. The Catholicosate of Aghtamar and the locally influential Syunik bishops enhanced the importance of the region around Etchmiadzin. In 1441 a general council of several hundred religious figures met in Etchmiadzin and voted to reestablish a catholicosate there. The cathedral was restored by Catholicos Kirakos (Cyriacus) between 1441 and 1443. At that time Etchmiadzin was under the control of the Turkic Kara Koyunlu, but in 1502, Safavid Iran gained control of parts of Armenia, including Etchmiadzin, and granted the Armenian Church some privileges.

During the 16th and 17th centuries, Armenia suffered from its location between Persia and Ottoman Turkey, and the conflicts between those two empires. Concurrently with the deportation of up to 350,000 Armenians into Persia by Shah Abbas I as part of the scorched earth policy during the war with the Ottoman Empire, Etchmiadzin was plundered in 1604.

The Shah wanted to &quot;dispel Armenian hopes of returning to their homeland&quot; by moving the religious center of the Armenians to Iran in order to provide Persia with a strong Armenian presence. He wanted to destroy the cathedral and have it physically transferred to the newly founded Armenian community of New Julfa near the royal capital of Isfahan. Shah Abbas offered the prospective new cathedral in New Julfa to the Pope. Etchmiadzin was not moved, possibly because of the high costs. In the event, only some important stones—the altar, the stone where Jesus Christ descended according to tradition, and Armenian Church&#x27;s holiest relic, the Right Arm of Gregory the Illuminator—were moved to New Julfa. They were incorporated in the local Armenian St. Georg Church when it was built in 1611. Fifteen stones from Etchmiadzin still remain at St. Georg.

=== 17th–18th centuries ===
Since 1627, the cathedral underwent a major renovation under Catholicos Movses (Moses), when the dome, ceiling, roof, foundations and paving were repaired. At this time, cells for monks, a guesthouse and other structures were built around the cathedral. Additionally, a wall was built around the cathedral, making it a fort-like complex.

The renovation works were interrupted by the Ottoman-Safavid War of 1635–36, during which the cathedral remained intact. The renovations resumed under Catholicos Pilippos (1632–55), who built new cells for monks and renovated the roof. During this century, belfries were added to many Armenian churches. In 1653–54, he started the construction of the belfry in the western wing of Etchmiadzin Cathedral. It was completed in 1658 by Catholicos Hakob IV Jugayetsi. Decades later, in 1682, Catholicos Yeghiazar constructed smaller bell towers with red tuff turrets on the southern, eastern, and northern wings.

The renovations of Etchmiadzin continued during the 18th century. In 1720, Catholicos Astvatsatur and then, in 1777–83 Simeon I of Yerevan took actions in preserving the cathedral. In 1770, Simeon I established a publishing house near Etchmiadzin, the first in Armenia. During Simeon&#x27;s reign, the monastery was completely walled and separated from the city of Vagharshapat. Catholicos Ghukas (Lucas) continued the renovations in 1784–86.


=== Russian takeover ===
The Russian Empire gradually penetrated Transcaucasia by the early 19th century. Persia&#x27;s Erivan Khanate, in which Etchmiadzin was located, became an important target for the Russians. In June 1804, during the Russo-Persian War (1804–13), the Russian troops led by General Pavel Tsitsianov tried to take Etchmiadzin, but failed. A few days after the attempt, the Russians returned to Etchmiadzin, where they caught a different Persian force by surprise and routed them. Tsitsianov&#x27;s forces entered Etchmiadzin, which, according to Auguste Bontems-Lefort, a contemporary French military envoy to Persia, they looted, seriously damaging the Armenian religious buildings. Shortly after, the Russians were forced to withdraw from the area as a result of the successful Persian defense of Erivan. According to Bontems-Lefort, the Russian behaviour at Etchmiadzin contrasted with that of the Persian king, who treated the local Christian population with respect.

On 13 April 1827, during the Russo-Persian War (1826–28), Etchmiadzin was captured by the Russian General Ivan Paskevich&#x27;s troops without fight and was formally annexed by Russia, with the Persian-controlled parts of Armenia, roughly corresponding to the territory of the modern Republic of Armenia (also known as Eastern Armenia), according to the 1828 Treaty of Turkmenchay.

The cathedral prospered under Russian rule, despite the suspicions that the Imperial Russian government had about Etchmiadzin becoming a &quot;possible center of the Armenian nationalist sentiment.&quot; Formally, Etchmiadzin became the religious center of the Armenians living within the Russian Empire by the 1836 statute or constitution (&quot;polozhenie&quot;).

In 1868, Catholicos Gevorg (George) IV made the last major alteration to the cathedral by adding a sacristy (museum and room of relics) to its east end. In 1874, he established the Gevorgian Seminary, a theological school-college located on the cathedral&#x27;s premises. Catholicos Markar I undertook the restoration of the interior of the cathedral in 1888.

=== 20th century and on ===

In 1903, the Russian government issued an edict to confiscate the properties of the Armenian Church, including the treasures of Etchmiadzin. Russian policemen and soldiers entered and occupied the cathedral. Due to popular resistance and the personal defiance of Catholicos Mkrtich Khrimian, the edict was canceled in 1905.

During the Armenian genocide, the cathedral of Etchmiadzin and its surrounding became a major center for Turkish Armenian refugees. At the end of 1918, there were about 70,000 refugees in the Etchmiadzin district. A hospital and an orphanage within the cathedral&#x27;s grounds were established and maintained by the U.S.-based Armenian Near East Relief by 1919.

In the spring of 1918 the cathedral was in danger of an attack by the Turks. Prior to the May 1918 Battle of Sardarabad, which took place just miles away from the cathedral, the civilian and military leadership of Armenia suggested Catholicos Gevorg (George) V to leave for Byurakan for security purposes, but he refused. The Armenian forces eventually repelled the Turkish offensive and set the foundations of the First Republic of Armenia.

=== Soviet period ===
==== Suppression ====
After two years of independence, Armenia was Sovietized in December 1920. During the 1921 February Uprising Etchmiadzin was briefly (until April) taken over by the nationalist Armenian Revolutionary Federation, which had dominated the pre-Soviet Armenian government between 1918 and 1920.

In December 1923, the southern apse of the cathedral collapsed. It was restored under Toros Toramanian&#x27;s supervision in what was the first case of restoration of an architectural monument in Soviet Armenia.

During the Great Purge and the radical state atheist policies in the late 1930s, the cathedral was a &quot;besieged institution as the campaign was underway to eradicate religion.&quot; The repressions climaxed when Catholicos Khoren I was murdered in April 1938 by the NKVD. In August of that year, the Armenian Communist Party decided to close down the monastery, but the central Soviet government seemingly did not approve of such a measure. Isolated from the outside world, the cathedral barely continued to function and its administrators were reduced to some twenty people. It was reportedly the only church in Soviet Armenia not to have been seized by the Communist government. The dissident anti-Soviet Armenian diocese in the US wrote that &quot;the great cathedral became a hollow monument.&quot;

==== Revival ====
Etchmiadzin slowly recovered its religious importance during World War II. The Holy See&#x27;s official magazine resumed publication in 1944, while the seminary was reopened in September 1945. In 1945 Catholicos Gevorg VI was elected after the seven-year vacancy of the position. The number of baptisms conducted at Etchmiadzin rose greatly: from 200 in 1949 to around 1,700 in 1951. Nevertheless, the cathedral&#x27;s role was downplayed by the Communist official circles. &quot;For them the ecclesiastical Echmiadzin belongs irrevocably to the past, and even if the monastery and the cathedral are occasionally the scene of impressive ceremonies including the election of a new catholicos, this has little importance from the communist point of view,&quot; wrote Walter Kolarz in 1961.

Etchmiadzin revived under Catholicos Vazgen I since the Khrushchev Thaw in the mid-1950s, following Stalin&#x27;s death. Archaeological excavations were held in 1955–56 and in 1959; the cathedral underwent a major renovation during this period. Wealthy diaspora benefactors, such as Calouste Gulbenkian and Alex Manoogian, financially assisted the renovation of the cathedral. Gulbenkian alone provided $400,000.

=== Independent Armenia ===
In 2000 Etchmiadzin underwent a renovation prior to the celebrations of the 1700th anniversary of the Christianization of Armenia in 2001. Its metal roof was replaced by stone slabs. In 2003 the 1700th anniversary of the consecration of the cathedral was celebrated by the Armenian Church. Catholicos Karekin II declared 2003 the Year of Holy Etchmiadzin. In September of that year an academic conference on the cathedral was held at the Pontifical Residence.

The latest renovation of the cathedral began in 2012, with a focus on strengthening and restoring the dome and the roof. Its ceremonial reopening took place on September 29, 2024 in attendance of senior officials, including Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan. The main benefactors, including diaspora billionaires Noubar Afeyan and Samvel Karapetyan, who had funded to the renovation were awarded by Catholicos Karekin II.

The initial goal was to address the external structure, primarily repairing roof tiles, but significant issues with the cathedral&#x27;s physical condition were subsequently uncovered. Critical structural elements, including columns, arches, the dome, and vaults, were found to be severely deteriorated. Restoration efforts employed high-quality materials, such as injection compounds, waterproofing agents, and mortar, most of which were imported from Italy. Additionally, the frescoes and painted surfaces, covering 2,600 square meters, were meticulously restored. Its 17th century cross, made of thin brass sheets and in a severely deteriorated condition, was replaced with a bronze one that closely replicates its style and size.

== Architecture ==
===Style===
Etchmiadzin has a cruciform plan, four free-standing piers, and four projecting apses, which are semicircular on the interior and polygonal on the exterior. Its roof is mostly flat, except the conspicuous central cupola with the typically Armenian conical roof on a polygonal drum and the four small belfries on top of the apses.

Although the cathedral was renovated many times through the centuries and significant additions were made in the 17th and 19th centuries, it largely retains the form of the building constructed in 483/4, especially the floor plan. The fifth-century building is the core of the cathedral, while the stone cupola, turrets, belfry, and rear extension are later additions. According to Varazdat Harutyunyan, its dome was originally wooden and was replaced with a stone one in a subsequent renovation. Portions of the northern and eastern walls of the original building have survived. Alexander Sahinian argued that Etchmiadzin holds a unique position in Armenian (and non-Armenian) architecture history because it reproduces features of different periods of Armenian architecture. It makes the building of &quot;immense architectural interest.&quot;

In the West, its style has traditionally been described as Byzantine or linked to Byzantine architecture. Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli disagreed, asserting that fourth century Armenian churches, including Etchmiadzin, considerably differ from Justinian-era Byzantine architecture of Constantinople. He argued that they are local creations that borrow technical elements from the East (Hatra, Sarvestan), but are &quot;fundamentally Hellenistic&quot; in their &quot;formal structure and proportional relationships.&quot; Similarly, Hewsen suggested that the design of the core of the church is a mixture of a Zoroastrian fire temple and a mausoleum of classical antiquity.

===Dimensions and appearance===
The cathedral measures , with its dome rising approximately . Small by European standards, it is one of the largest churches of its time and one of the largest churches in Armenia. The cathedral&#x27;s core is built in grey stone, while the 17th century additions in bright red.

James Bryce found little distinctive about its exterior and H. F. B. Lynch did not admire its architecture. Robert Ker Porter said its architecture is &quot;of a rude character, when compared with even the roughest styles of Gothic churches that may be seen in England.&quot; A &quot;National Geographic&quot; writer described it as an &quot;austere and commanding work&quot;, while two Soviet authors described it as a &quot;massive cube surmounted by a faceted cone on a simple cylinder.&quot; Robert H. Hewsen noted that it is &quot;neither the largest nor the most beautiful of Armenian churches&quot;, nevertheless, &quot;the overall impression presented by the ensemble is inspiring, and Armenians hold the building in great reverence.&quot;

The rear extension, added by Catholicos Gevorg IV in 1868, was criticized by 19th century visitors for being out of harmony with the rest of the church.
=== Reliefs ===
The exterior contains extensive decorative geometric and floral patterns as well as blind arcades and medallions depicting saints.

;Greek inscriptions 
The most significant reliefs are on the northern wall, which Vahagn Grigoryan has described as the most discussed sculptures of early medieval Armenia. One depicts a standing Saint Thecla and Paul the Apostle seated on cross-legged stool. The other contains an equal-armed cross (Greek cross) with a series of Greek inscriptions that contain several names, including Arxia, Elpid, Daniel, Tirer, and Garikinis, none of whom have been identified. The last two are interpreted to be the Armenian names Tirayr and Garegin. The stones measure and .

These reliefs have been tentatively dated between the first and sixth centuries. Some like Shahkhatunian and Ghevont Alishan suggested that these reliefs were created before the invention of the Armenian alphabet , while Sirarpie Der Nersessian believed that they are from the fifth or sixth century. Grigoryan insisted that the reliefs were created in the early fourth century and were part of the original building of Gregory the Illuminator. According to Hasratyan, they are the earliest reliefs on the cathedral&#x27;s walls and among the earliest examples of Christian Armenian sculpture art.

===Tibetan bell===
The 17th century bell tower previously housed a bell with a Tibetan Buddhist inscription, which was reported by foreign travelers and scholars throughout the 19th century. According to Simon Maghakyan, the bell was removed in the late 1930s by the Soviets and has disappeared without a trace. The inscription survives as a copy in an 1890 book by Ghevont Alishan: 

Dan Martin, a scholar of Tibet, wrote that the three-syllable mantra &quot;oṃ aḥ hūṃ&quot;, repeated thrice on the bell, is ubiquitous in Secret Mantra Buddhism and is used for blessing offerings. He argued that the inscription suggests that the bell was a consecrated Buddhist object. An evidence of Armenian contacts with Buddhism, the bell, Hewsen suggested, was &quot;probably the long-forgotten gift of some Mongol or Ilkhanid khan.&quot; Martin proposed an alternative theory; suggesting that the bell may have originally been housed at a Buddhist temple in the area and was later salvaged and transferred to Etchmiadzin or may have been brought from Lhasa to Armenia by New Julfa merchants in the 17th century, around the time the bell tower was built.

=== Interior ===
Etchmiadzin&#x27;s interior is extensively decorated with Persian-influenced frescoes. They depict flowers, birds, scrollwork, arabesque ornamentations. Bryce and Villari found the interior impressive, while Lynch called it &quot;sufficiently remarkable&quot;. Porter found the interior &quot;dark and gloomy&quot; with the &quot;ill-drawn, and worse-coloured&quot; paintings and &quot;dingy fresco&quot; adding to the &quot;gloom, without increasing the solemnity.&quot; Telfer described it as &quot;gloomy, ineffective, and entirely deficient in any fascinating touches of architectural force and decoration&quot;. Bryce said it had a &quot;certain sombre dignity, and an air of hoar antiquity about everything.&quot;

Stepanos Lehatsi (Stephen of Poland) painted the belfry in 1664. The early frescoes inside the cathedral were restored in the 18th century. In the 18th and 19th centuries, Armenian painters created frescoes of scenes from the old testament and Armenian saints. Naghash Hovnatan painted parts of the interior between 1712 and 1721. His paintings on the dome and the painting of the Mother of God under the altar have survived to this day. Other members of the prominent Hovnatanian family (Hakob, Harutyun and Hovnatan) created paintings throughout the 18th century. Their work was continued by the succeeding generations of the same family (Mkrtum and Hakob) in the 19th century.

The wooden doors of the cathedral were carved in Tiflis in 1889. The paintings were moved out of the cathedral by the order of Catholicos Mkrtich Khrimian in 1891 and are now kept in various museums in Armenia, including the National Gallery of Armenia. The frescoes inside the cathedral were restored by Lydia Durnovo in 1956, and in 1981–82 by Vardges Baghdasaryan. In the 1950s, the stone floor was replaced with one of marble.

=== Influence ===
==== On Armenian architecture ====
The design of the cathedral—classified as a &quot;four-apsed square with ciborium,&quot; and called &quot;Etchmiadzin-type&quot; in Armenian architectural historiography—was not common in Armenia in the early medieval period. The now-destroyed St. Theodore Church of Bagaran, dating from 624 to 631, was the only known church with a significantly similar plan and structure from that period. suggested that the type is also seen in the Mastara Church ().

In the 19th century, during an architectural revival that looked back to Armenia&#x27;s past, Etchmiadzin&#x27;s plan was directly copied in new Armenian churches. Some notable examples from this period include the narthex of the St. Thaddeus Monastery in northern Iran, dating from 1811 or 1819 through 1830, and the Ghazanchetsots Cathedral in Shushi, dating from 1868.

Its plan was also replicated in the Armenian diaspora, such as in the plans and designs of the Armenian Church of Singapore (1835) and the Armenian Church of Bucharest in Romania (1911–12).

==== On European architecture ====
Josef Strzygowski, who was the first European to thoroughly study Armenian architecture and place Armenia in the center of European architecture, suggested that several churches and chapels in Western Europe have been influenced by the cathedrals of Etchmiadzin and Bagaran due to similarities found within their plans. According to Strzygowski, some examples of churches influenced by Etchmiadzin and Bagaran are the 9th-century church of Germigny-des-Prés in France (built by Odo of Metz, an Armenian architect) and San Satiro of Milan, Italy. This view was later supported by Alexander Sahinian and Varazdat Harutyunyan. Sahinian suggested that Armenian church architecture was spread in Western Europe in the 8th–9th centuries by the Paulicians, who migrated from Armenia en mase after being suppressed by the Byzantines during the Iconoclasm period. Sahinian added many other medieval churches in Europe, such as the Palatine Chapel of Aachen in Germany, to the list of churches to have been influenced by the cathedrals of Etchmiadzin and Bagaran and by Byzantine decorative arts. According to Murad Hasratyan, Etchmiadzin&#x27;s design was spread to Europe via the Eastern Roman Empire and served as a model—besides Germigny-des-Prés and San Satiro—for the Nea Ekklesia church in Constantinople and the churches of Mount Athos in Greece.

== Protection and heritage designation ==
The cathedral and the surrounding complex covers an area of and is property of the Armenian Apostolic Church (Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin). Recognized as a national monument in 1983 by the Soviet Armenian government, this designation was reaffirmed by the government of Armenia in 2002. Joint councils consisting of the Ministry of Culture and the Armenian Apostolic Church are responsible for regulating its conservation, rehabilitation, and usage. In 2000 the UNESCO added Etchmiadzin Cathedral, the churches of St. Hripsime, St. Gayane, Shoghakat and the ruined Zvartnots Cathedral to the list of World Heritage Sites. The UNESCO highlights that the cathedral and churches &quot;graphically illustrate the evolution and development of the Armenian central-domed cross-hall type of church, which exerted a profound influence on architectural and artistic development in the region.&quot;

== Relics ==
The museum of the cathedral has numerous items on display, including manuscripts and religious objects. Among its notable exhibits are the Holy Lance (Spear), relics belonging to Apostles of Jesus and John the Baptist, and a fragment of Noah&#x27;s Ark. Its reliquary also originally held items belonging to Athenogenes of Pedachtoë, though it is unclear if these are still within the church.

== Significance ==
The locus of Etchmiadzin is &quot;a sanctified soil&quot; similar to Temple Mount and the Golden Temple, for Jews and Sikhs, respectively. In his first encyclical (1893) as Catholicos, Mkrtich Khrimian called the cathedral the &quot;Zion of Ararat.&quot; In 1991 Catholicos Vazgen I described the cathedral as &quot;our Solomon&#x27;s Temple.&quot; The cathedral complex has been called &quot;Armenian Vatican&quot; as it is a major pilgrimage site for Armenians worldwide. Since the cathedral has been so important to the development of Armenians&#x27; sense of identity, a pilgrimage to Etchmiadzin is &quot;as much as ethnic as a religious experience.&quot; Theodore Edward Dowling wrote in 1910 that Etchmiadzin and Mount Ararat are the &quot;two great objects of Armenian veneration.&quot;

For many centuries, Etchmiadzin was the national and political center of the stateless Armenian people, with one journalist describing it as &quot;the focal point of Armenians everywhere.&quot; Before the foundation of the First Republic of Armenia and the official designation of Yerevan as its capital in 1918, Western sources emphasized Etchmiadzin&#x27;s political significance. A 1920 book prepared by the Historical Section of the British Foreign Office acknowledged that Etchmiadzin &quot;was regarded as the national capital of the Armenians.&quot;

==Oldest cathedral==
Etchmiadzin is usually considered Armenia&#x27;s first cathedral. A number of sources also hold that Etchmiadzin is the oldest cathedral in the world.

It has sometimes been described as Armenia&#x27;s first church building, but this claim has found little support among scholars, who usually posit that the country&#x27;s first church was in Ashtishat, in the Taron region. A 2020 book on the cathedral, authorized by the Armenian Church, insisted that Etchmiadzin is the first church of Christian Armenia, although earlier Christian places of worship such as chapels or shrines existed prior. Robert W. Thomson argues that although Etchmiadzin was not the original center of the Armenian Church (which was and remained in Ashtishat until after the division of the country in 387), it had &quot;clearly been a holy shrine&quot; from the &quot;earliest Christian time in Armenia.&quot;

Despite its state atheism, the Soviets often promoted its antiquity. A 1982 Soviet guidebook called it the &quot;first Christian church to be built on the territory of the Soviet Union&quot;, while travel writer Georgi Kublitsky wrote in 1984 that the cathedral is &quot;believed by some to be the oldest extant building on Soviet territory.&quot;

== Notable visitors ==

Early European visitors to Etchmiadzin who gave descriptions of the cathedral included Jean-Baptiste Tavernier (before 1668), Jean Chardin (1673), Joseph Pitton de Tournefort (c. 1700), James Morier (1810–16), Robert Ker Porter (1817–20), Friedrich Parrot (1829), Eli Smith and H. G. O. Dwight (1829), August von Haxthausen (1843), Moritz Wagner (1843), Douglas Freshfield (1869), John Buchan Telfer (1870s), James Bryce (1876), H. F. B. Lynch (1893).

Many prominent individuals have visited Etchmiadzin, including Russian diplomat and playwright Alexander Griboedov (1828), Russian mystic Helena Blavatsky (1849), Russian poets Valery Bryusov and Andrei Bely (1929), Fridtjof Nansen (1925), Glenn T. Seaborg (1971), Armenian American writer William Saroyan (1976), English composer Benjamin Britten, Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Russian singer-songwriter Vladimir Vysotsky, Russian-American poet and essayist Joseph Brodsky, Andrei Sakharov, Cher, Alain Delon, Kim Kardashian and many others.

Religious leaders like Patriarch Cyril of Bulgaria (1967), Archbishops of Canterbury Donald Coggan (1977) and George Carey (1993), Patriarch Ilia II of Georgia (1997, 2003), Pope John Paul II (2001), Bartholomew I of Constantinople (2001), Ignatius Zakka I Iwas (2002), Patriarch Kirill of Moscow (2010), Pope Francis (2016) have visited Etchmiadzin. Francis gave a prayer at the cathedral on 24 June 2016, where he called the cathedral &quot;a witness to the history of your people and the centre from which its spirituality radiates.&quot;

Leaders of several countries, such as Russia (Vladimir Putin in 2005), France (Jacques Chirac in 2006 and Nicolas Sarkozy in 2011), Georgia (Mikheil Saakashvili in 2004, Giorgi Margvelashvili in 2014), Romania (Emil Constantinescu in 1998), Lebanon (Michel Aoun, 2018), Germany (Angela Merkel, 2018), and royalty, such as Nicholas I of Russia (1837), King Mahendra of Nepal (1958), Prince Charles (2013) have visited the cathedral as part of their state or private visits to Armenia.

== Cultural depictions ==

The coat of arms of Russian-administered Erivan (Yerevan), approved in 1843, featured the cathedral.

The &quot;Etchmiadzin&quot; monthly, the official periodical of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin founded in 1944, features the cathedral on its cover page as the logo.

The Soviet Union and Armenia issued postage stamps depicting the cathedral in 1978 and 2009, respectively. The cathedral is depicted on the obverse side of the 50,000 dram banknote (2001) of Armenia.

The cathedral has been depicted in painting by Grigory Gagarin (1847), Panos Terlemezian (1903), and in books by John Mason Neale (1850), August von Haxthausen (1854), John Ussher (1865), and others.

The floor mosaic, created by the 20th-century Israeli artist Hava Yofe, inside the Chapel of Saint Helena at Jerusalem&#x27;s Church of the Holy Sepulchre depicts the cathedral along with other major Armenian sites. A relief of the cathedral was erected on the headquarters of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church of America next to the St. Vartan Cathedral in New York and silver plate depicting the cathedral is displayed at the American Museum of Natural History in New York.

In the 1991 film &quot;Mayrig&quot;, directed by French-Armenian director Henri Verneuil, footage of the cathedral is shown when Azad Zakarian, the main character and a son of Armenian genocide survivors, is being questioned about his faith in a Catholic school.

<text>Stahleck Castle () is a 12th-century fortified castle in the Upper Middle Rhine Valley at Bacharach in Rhineland-Palatinate, Germany. It stands on a crag approximately above sea level on the left bank of the river at the mouth of the Steeg valley, approximately south of Koblenz, and offers a commanding view of the Lorelei valley. Its name means &quot;impregnable castle on a crag&quot;, from the Middle High German words &quot;stahel&quot; (steel) and &quot;ecke&quot; (here: crag). It has a water-filled partial moat, a rarity in Germany. Built on the orders of the Archbishop of Cologne, it was destroyed in the late 17th century but rebuilt in the 20th and is now a hostel.

==History==
===Beginnings===
From about 1000 AD, Bacharach is presumed to have been a possession of the Archbishops of Cologne. They had the castle built, perhaps as a southern outpost to guard the far-flung archbishopric; their Vogt resided there. It is uncertain when the present castle was built to replace an earlier fortification; perhaps around 1135. It was the first large castle north of Bingen and Rüdesheim. 

A &quot;Gozwin von Stalecke&quot; is first mentioned in charters in 1120–21. This was Goswin von Falkenburg, who is also referred to in 1135 by the Latin translation &quot;Cozwinus de Staelechae&quot; and was the first attested holder of the castle in fief. He was a member of a Main-Frankish family and had come into possession of the castle through marriage to Luitgard von Hengebach, the widow of Heinrich I of Katzenelnbogen, who died in 1102. From then on he called himself Goswin von Stahleck.

===Seat of the Counts Palatine by Rhine===
In 1125, Goswin&#x27;s son Hermann married Gertrud of Swabia, sister of King Conrad III of Germany. After receiving Stahleck Castle in fief from his brother in law in 1140, he was additionally granted the County of Palatinate by Rhine. This made him one of the greatest lords of the Holy Roman Empire and the Four Valley Region, which consisted of the settlements of Bacharach, Steeg (now part of Bacharach), Diebach and Manubach plus the castles of Stahleck, Fürstenberg and Stahlberg, and made Stahleck the centre of power of the heart of what later became the Rhineland territory of the Counts Palatine. They developed Bacharach into a trading town, among other things for the wine trade, and the castle was thus used to enforce payment of duties. When he went on the Second Crusade, Conrad made Hermann his regent.

After Hermann&#x27;s death in 1156, Emperor Frederick Barbarossa bestowed the title of Count Palatine on his half-brother Conrad of Hohenstaufen. After the death of his remaining son in 1189, Conrad&#x27;s only heir was his daughter Agnes. So that the castle and the title could remain in the family, that year King Henry VI commuted the fief from a personal to a hereditary one. In the future this led to repeated conflicts between the Counts Palatine and the See of Cologne, since Stahleck was a possession of the Electoral Archbishop and not the king&#x27;s to modify.

It was her father&#x27;s wish for Agnes to marry King Philip II of France, but instead when Conrad was away from the castle in January or February 1194, she secretly married Henry the Elder of Brunswick, son of his enemy the Welf Duke Henry the Lion, to whom she had previously been engaged; the marriage, performed by Johann I, Archbishop of Triers, is known as the Stahleck Marriage or the Bacharach Marriage. After Conrad&#x27;s death, Henry succeeded him as Count Palatine and so came into possession of the castle. However, in 1212 he renounced the title and the rights associated with it in favour of his son Henry the Younger. When the latter died young and childless in 1214, his younger sister Agnes inherited Stahleck. The non-allodial remainder of the County reverted to the Crown and was subsequently bestowed on the Bavarian Duke Ludwig I of the House of Wittelsbach.

===Wittelsbach ownership===

In order to secure possession also of the castle and the overseership of Bacharach, Ludwig I arranged a marriage in 1222 between his son Otto and Agnes. Under Otto (Otto II) in 1243, the long-running conflict with the Archbishopric of Cologne was settled, and he received Fürstenberg and Stahlberg Castles as additional fiefs.

Ludwig I transferred his primary residence to Heidelberg, so that from then on, Stahleck was used only occasionally and was overseen by counts, who called themselves &quot;Ritter (Knight) von Stahleck&quot;. From the 15th century on, it was administered by bailiffs. However, although the castle was no longer the administrative centre of the Palatinate, important gatherings of the nobility continued to take place there into the 15th century, including the election of Ludwig IV as King of Germany in May 1314 and the wedding of Emperor Charles IV and Anna, only daughter of Rudolf II, Count Palatine, on 4 March 1349. In addition, the castle was used several times during the 14th century as a pledge. In December 1314, to cover the costs of his election, Ludwig IV pledged it for 58,300 pounds of Hellers to John of Luxembourg, King of Bohemia, and his uncle Baldwin, Electoral Archbishop of Triers. In July 1328, they were required to surrender Stahleck and also Stahlberg and Braunshorn Castles as security for a fine payable to Countess Loretta of Sponheim. The castle was thus administered by Count Wilhelm I of Katzenelnbogen as regent until the entire sum of 11,000 pounds had been paid. The castle was also opened for military use to Gerlach of Nassau, Archbishop of Mainz, in 1346.

In 1353, the Palatinate was divided and Stahleck Castle passed to Rupert the Younger, after which it was incorporated into the fortifications around the town of Bacharach. In late 1400, Rupert&#x27;s son, also named Rupert, celebrated there his election as King of Germany and Rome after the deposition of King Wenceslaus of Luxembourg. In 1408, Rupert hosted a banquet for the Electors of the Holy Roman Empire, but after that Stahleck gradually lost its importance for the empire. In 1442 Ludwig IV, Count Palatine, held a reception and electoral banquet there for King Frederick of Habsburg as he was en route to Aachen to be crowned Emperor, but during the 15th and 16th centuries the castle sank into insignificance.

===Destruction in the 17th century===

After the introduction of cannon, an artillery platform was added to the medieval castle on the northeast side to cover the access route, but its exact date of construction is unknown. Despite this, the castle was besieged, conquered, and sacked a total of eight times during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. On 4 October 1620, it and the town of Bacharach were taken by Spanish troops commanded by Ambrogio Spinola, but the Spaniards were evicted by Protestant Swedes on 9 January 1632. The castle was heavily damaged during the siege leading up to its recapture. A copper engraving in Matthäus Merian&#x27;s 1646 &quot;Topographia Germaniae&quot; depicts the battle.

In July 1635, Imperial troops under Matthias Gallas, Count of Campo, successfully besieged Stahleck. They were evicted four years later, in July 1639, by Weimaran soldiers, but the castle was then occupied by Bavarian troops in March 1640. They stayed only a short time, and after their withdrawal the Weimaran troops reoccupied the castle and the town. In autumn 1640, after a 14-day siege, Spanish troops once more took their place.

In September 1644, the castle and the town were taken by French soldiers after a 10-day siege; the following month, Cologne troops attacked them and forced them to retreat to the castle with heavy losses. The Cologne commander, Constantin von Nievenheimb, therefore ordered the bombardment and &quot;more or less ruination&quot; of the castle, but did not attempt to capture it. The French soldiers remained until 24 July 1650 but had to vacate the castle under the terms of the Peace of Westphalia, which returned it to the Palatinate and Count Palatine Karl Ludwig. In 1666, he had the castle repaired and made some alterations: he greatly changed the interior of the &quot;palas&quot; and between it and the northern rampart built a massive new building with a &quot;Fachwerk&quot; half-timbered upper storey. An inscribed stone tablet on the &quot;palas&quot; commemorates his rebuilding of the castle.

During the War of the Palatine Succession, the castle was decisively destroyed, like most of the fortifications in the Upper Middle Rhine Valley. Its commander, von Dachenhausen, surrendered it to French troops on 11 October 1688, but on 15 March 1689 they blew it up. The explosion completely destroyed both the ring wall and the keep, the residential buildings burned out in the resulting fire, and debris from the explosion destroyed the Gothic Werner Chapel at the foot of the castle hill. The castle was so heavily damaged that it was not rebuilt. Under the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick, the ruin reverted to the Palatinate, where it remained until the dissolution of the County at the end of the 18th century.

===French and Prussian ownership===

After the occupation of the parts of the Palatinate on the left bank of the Rhine by French Revolutionary troops in 1794, in 1801 the Treaty of Lunéville awarded the ruined castle to the French; in 1804 they offered it for sale. In 1815 the Congress of Vienna resulted in its passing into the possession of the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1828 the then Crown Prince Frederick William acquired it in order to give it to his wife Elisabeth Ludovika of Bavaria; she was a Wittelsbach princess. In association with a visit by her in the 1850s, large parts of the toppling walls were cleared, and the rubble spread over the courtyard and used to fill the moat. All that remained was the wall of the &quot;palas&quot; on the courtyard side, the ring wall on the Steeg valley side to the height of the chemin de ronde and a small piece of the inner or shield wall.

The ruined castle became well known among romantics and nationalists and was often depicted in the 19th century. Beginning in 1907, Axel Delmar had plans for a home for artists in the ruins of the castle, but the Prussian royal family refused to sell the site.

===20th-century rebuilding===

The first work to stabilise and rebuild the ring wall and shield wall, costing 3,500 marks, began only in 1909, after the ruin had been transferred from the Prussian Crown to the Rhenish Association for Landmark Preservation and Landscape Protection. The Association was able to raise the 5,000 mark purchase price through donations. Work was interrupted by World War I, and the castle suffered further vandalism and decay. In 1924 Richard Blankenhorn, the owner of the villa above the castle, wished to start a business in the ruins, but there was no response for 5 years to his enquiry concerning a lease.

Early in 1925 the decision was taken to construct a youth hostel at the castle. Firm plans were made in March of that year. The Association contracted with the architect Ernst Stahl to &quot;build in the ruin, in the spirit of the old buildings and making use of the old walls, a building which [would] fit well into the landscape&quot;. Financing of the initial work was ensured by an endowment of .

Stahleck became the Association&#x27;s prestige project. The intention was to completely rebuild the castle. Stahl based his designs on historical models and appended them to remaining structures, but changed his plans again after ancient, previously unknown building foundations came to light in excavations beginning in August 1925. The excavations and the attendant repeated surveying of the site delayed the start of building to late summer 1925. The first building, the longhouse, was intended as a hostel for boys. On the first floor, executed in Fachwerk, were a flat for the hostel manager and an adjacent dormitory with washroom. On the ground floor, built in crushed stone, were the kitchen and a day-room, while the top floor, which has dormers on the courtyard side, housed further sleeping and washing space. The design adhered as far as possible to the use of space in the old castle. An old cellar at the east corner of the site was rebuilt and roofed over in reinforced concrete to make a viewing terrace. Further excavations took place parallel to the construction work, and recovered stones were used as building material in rebuilding the ring wall and the foundation of the keep.

The official dedication of the youth hostel took place on 12–13 June 1926 and was followed by a second building phase, from autumn 1926 to July 1927, in which the tower building, with two wings at right angles and a turret at the angle, was built as a girls&#x27; hostel on the foundations of two Fachwerk buildings against the shield wall. The ground floor consisted of a large day-room; on the first floor were a large dormitory, washrooms and living and sleeping space for matrons. Further sleeping space was under the single-pitched roof, and in addition there was a 4-bed room inside the turret. Rebuilding of the entire ring wall and the shield wall lasted until 1927.

Once open, the youth hostel was almost always oversubscribed, leading to problems with the water supply. Insufficient water frequently led to a complete ban on washing. The problem was alleviated by tapping a new source of water on the western hillside.

In 1929, the keep, with two holes in it from the explosion, was finally stabilised to a height of 3 m. The hole on the east side was used as an entrance to the tower. Also in 1929, the day-rooms were redecorated with dados and murals. In 1930–31, the ground floor of the ruined &quot;palas&quot; was rebuilt, to make a dining hall, a dishwashing room, and a flat for the hostel manager. In 1932, work was done on clearing the rubble from the moat.

===Under National Socialism===

Since there was still insufficient space in the hostel, which had over 30,000 overnight stays in 1934, the &quot;palas&quot; was completely rebuilt, providing 260 beds. The ceremonial laying of its foundation stone took place on 18 November 1934. The work, which took only 11 months, cost and included addition of a kitchen, another Fachwerk building, on the south side. On 25 October 1935, the rebuilt building was officially dedicated. In the presence of members of the Hitler Jugend, the Deutsches Jungvolk, the Bund Deutscher Mädel, and both the SA and the SS, Gauleiter Gustav Simon gave the dedicatory address. Stahleck became one of 27 &quot;Jugendburgen&quot; (youth castles), to be used for indoctrination of teenagers and young adults. Between 1937 and early 1938, the turrets on the shield wall were built and its chemin de ronde roofed over. A visit by Rudolf Hess in June 1938 prompted the start of work to complete the rebuilding of the keep, which was still a ruined stump. The plan was to reconstruct it to a height of 36 m, 7 storeys, and name it the Rudolf Hess Tower. However, the existing foundations would not have been able to bear the weight, so the ruin was pulled down, and in November 1938, work began on a completely new tower on a smaller footprint. Work on this was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II.

From 1940 to 1942, the castle served as a military hospital. In addition, in November 1940, students from now occupied Luxembourg who had been studying at German and Austrian universities when the war began were forced to attend re-education classes there, and eventually a youth re-education camp was set up. Male schoolchildren and students from Esch-sur-Alzette and Echternach were interned at the castle for 4 months as punishment for protesting against the announcement in 1942 of the introduction of required military service in Luxembourg and the forced conscription associated with it, as well as for participating in the general strike which followed. (Girls were sent to a youth hostel at Adenau.) Those of military age were then sent to the front. There is a memorial plaque at the castle, and the State of Rhineland-Palatinate and the City of Bacharach have organised memorial events at which contemporary witnesses spoke.

Beginning in January 1943, the castle was used as an internment camp for German youth who had shown insufficient loyalty to the Party, such as the founders of the Catholic youth resistance group the Michael Troop; some were taken from Stahleck to concentration camps. From June 1943 to summer 1944, it was a work and military training camp for Germans between 14 and 18 years of age.

===After the war and today===

Following the end of the war, Stahleck Castle was first used to billet French soldiers, before returning to use as a youth hostel in November 1947. The Health and Welfare Ministry of Rhineland-Palatinate opened a youth leadership school at the castle in January 1948 to train prospective hostel managers and staff, but was forced to close it at the end of the same year because of the state&#x27;s poor financial situation. The hostel itself, however, was unaffected. In 1957 the castle offered 270 beds and 60 emergency spaces and was thus the third largest youth hostel in Rhineland-Palatinate, after those in Koblenz and Mainz. In terms of overnight stays, it was in second place with 32,276.

Beginning in October 1965, a further building programme was carried out at the castle under government superintendent of works Heinrich Grimm, based on the plans of Stahl, who had died in 1957. This included interior modernisation and renovation and a new administration building. In addition, a large terrace was created on the south side, and beginning in 1966 the still incomplete keep was built up a further 4 m and topped with a tall cone-shaped roof. The ceremonial reopening took place on 20 May 1967.

The castle is still used as a hostel, now leased by the Rhineland-Palatinate Youth Hostel Association. It currently offers 168 beds and has approximately 42,000 overnights per year. It is almost always booked up. In the 1990s the non-visitor facilities were once more modernised at a cost of DM 8.3 million.

==Architecture==
===Until 1689===
A series of archaeological excavations between 1925 and 1927 revealed many previously hidden foundations of medieval buildings at the castle site, making it possible to reconstruct what was there before the castle was destroyed in 1689. According to the evidence, since the Middle Ages, Stahleck Castle had 3 entrances. One was a double gate reached by steps from the Rhine Valley, leading into a small, elongated &quot;zwinger&quot;, from which entry to the castle was through a double-barred door in the northern shield wall, 8 m from the northwest corner. The former main gate was in the west corner, on the site of today&#x27;s main entrance, and could be reached either from the northern &quot;zwinger&quot; or by way of a drawbridge from a group of outbuildings to the southwest. The main gate led to a gate &quot;zwinger&quot; and an inside gate from which a narrow passage led to the courtyard. The third entrance consisted of a small door in the outside wall of the southern &quot;zwinger&quot;, which was parallel to the ring wall and had a round tower at the south corner.

Immediately inside the northern ring wall was a longish building with a stone residential building attached to its northern end. Its ground floor was divided into several small rooms, and at the south end there was a timber-framed building whose outside wall was the southern defensive wall. Two more timber-framed buildings stood on the west side in the shelter of a shield wall which protected the castle on the side where the hillside is higher. The buildings thus enclosed a long, narrow inner courtyard, in the centre of which was a round Romanesque keep (&quot;bergfried&quot;), with an outside wall 4 m thick.

Water was supplied to the castle by a well sunk into the hillside within the shield wall. It was connected by a tunnel at a depth of approximately four metres to the moat outside the walls.

Finds of fragments of early Gothic vaulting and of a Gothic window showed that the castle had a chapel. Until then, the only evidence had been a mention in the 1471 testament of Ruprecht of the Palatinate, Archbishop of Cologne. It is impossible to know exactly where the chapel was, but it is presumed to have been on the first floor of the &quot;palas&quot;, where Merian&#x27;s engraving shows a small bay window on the Rhine side of the building.

In addition to the still existing artillery platform on the southwest side, there was a bastion in the northeast.

===Today===
The castle today is a 20th-century reconstruction, primarily based on the results of excavation and the 1646 engraving by Matthäus Merian. The rebuilding plans were mostly the work of Ernst Stahl, who closely followed Merian&#x27;s depiction and used other historical models where the engraving gave no information. For example, the almost rectangular shape of the castle, measuring approximately 55 by 24 m, shows the typical regular layout and clear divisions of a castle of the Hohenstaufen period. The size of the modern buildings approximates that of those in the original castle; the oldest portions are the foundations of the keep, parts of the cellar under the &quot;palas&quot; and sections of the curtain wall.

Since the castle is used as a hostel, it is not available for tours. However, the courtyard is accessible to the public and offers a fine view of the Rhine, since on that side there is only a low parapet.

====&quot;Palas&quot;====
The &quot;palas&quot; (residential building) is 2 storeys high, built of crushed stone lined with Rhenish &quot;Schwemmstein&quot; (a traditional artificial material made of dried pumice and lime, similar to concrete), and stands at the eastern, Rhine valley end of the courtyard, over a vaulted cellar that Ernst Stahl dated to the time of Conrad of Hohenstaufen. It has a shingled hip roof 10 m high. Adjoining it on the southwest side is the so-called kitchen building, with Fachwerk first floor, which today is the residence of the hostel managers.

On the courtyard side, a red sandstone tablet commemorates Duke Karl Ludwig&#x27;s rebuilding of the castle. The inscription reads: 
:CARL LVDWIG PFALTZGRAF CHVRFÜRST ERNEVERT MICH ANNO 1666 (Carl Ludwig, Count Palatine [and] Elector, remade me in the year 1666)

Of the numerous details that Stahl once envisaged incorporating in the rebuilding of the castle, only the windows and chandeliers of the great hall exist today. The 11 windows of the hall, made of stained glass by the Düsseldorf glass painter Richard Gassen, depict the most important events in the history of the castle and the arms of the people or institutions of the Rhine Province in the 1920s. They are framed by versions in basalt which can only be seen from outside. The room has an oak plank floor and holds approximately 100 people.

====Bergfried====
Although documentary evidence leads to the conclusion that the castle was built in the 12th century at the latest, the archaeological investigations have been unable to provide proof. Stahl believed, however, that the preserved foundations of the bergfried (keep) should be dated to the 12th century. The keep is a round tower 7.5 m in diameter which stands on bedrock in the centre of the inner courtyard. It has walls 2 metres thick and is topped by a 16 m cone-shaped roof. The top floor, 4 m high, was added later, which can be seen from the different colour of the stone.

====Shield wall and main entrance====

The castle is defended from the high hillside on the west by a chemise wall which has been fortified to form a shield wall 2.6 m thick. There is an interior stairway, which does not, however, reach as far as the roofed chemin de ronde at the top of the wall; it is used to reach the upper floors of the 1930s tower building. Some of the tall, narrow embrasures were subsequently walled closed at the base and fitted with wooden frames to absorb the recoil of early firearms. Their fishtail shape indicates that the wall dates to the first half of the 14th century. At the top they are flanked on both sides by polygonal turrets which replaced two earlier round towers.

Below the shield wall is a moat cut out of the rock. A section of this measuring 18 by 13 metres is separated off and filled with water, doubling as a cistern. A stone bridge leads over the moat to the main entrance; the gateway is guarded by an embrasured turret above and leads to an elongated &quot;zwinger&quot;.

====Other structures====
The former boys&#x27; hostel is now called the longhouse. It has a ground floor of crushed stone and a Fachwerk first floor. The slate roof has a dormer on the courtyard side with a curved gable.

What is now known as the tower building, formerly the girls&#x27; hostel, stands against the shield wall. It resembles the longhouse in its details.

A walled platform cut out of the rock a little above the castle to the southwest is a post-medieval position for artillery aimed at the hillside which was an important part of the castle&#x27;s defences after the introduction of gunpowder. Its precise date is unknown, but Matthäus Merian&#x27;s 17th-century engraving shows that it existed by 1646.

<text>Pennies from Heaven is a 1978 BBC musical drama serial written by Dennis Potter. The title is taken from the song &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; written by Johnny Burke and Arthur Johnston. It was one of several Potter serials (another being &quot;The Singing Detective&quot;) to mix the reality of the drama with a dark fantasy content, and the earliest of his works where the characters burst into extended performances of popular songs.

==Overview==
The serial was directed by Piers Haggard and produced by frequent Potter collaborator Kenith Trodd. Bob Hoskins became an established actor in the United Kingdom following his role in this serial. It also featured Nigel Havers as Conrad Baker (the suave salesman), Jenny Logan as Irene (Joan&#x27;s friend), Freddie Jones as Mr. Warner (Eileen&#x27;s headmaster), Michael Bilton as Eileen&#x27;s dad, Tudor Davies as the cafe customer (Davies was also choreographer for the series), and Peter Bowles as the Prosecuting Counsel.

&quot;Pennies&quot; was the last of Potter&#x27;s television dramas to be filmed in the &#x27;hybrid&#x27; format of studio videotape and location 16 mm film. The production involved six weeks of filming on location, most of it in Oxfordshire, with selected shooting in the Forest of Dean (in Potter&#x27;s home county of Gloucestershire, between the River Severn and the River Wye). The school where Eileen teaches is the Forest school Potter attended in Berry Hill and the children who populate the school scenes were local children cast as extras. In temporary remission from his chronic condition of psoriatic arthropathy, a rare skin and joints disease that first afflicted him at the age of 24, Potter and his wife Margaret were able to visit the location shoot in Dean.

&quot;Pennies...&quot; was transmitted in six episodes of approximately 75 minutes each from 7 March to 11 April 1978, on BBC1 and first repeated later that year. Roughly five million viewers watched the first episode, and by episode three this had risen to seven million. In spring of the following year, &quot;Pennies&quot; won the British Academy Television Award for Most Original Programme (Hoskins and Campbell were also nominated for BAFTA acting awards). In a 2000 poll of industry professionals conducted by the British Film Institute to find the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes of the 20th century, &quot;Pennies from Heaven&quot; was placed at number 21.

==Legacy==
The original television version was released on DVD by BBC Worldwide in 2004. The first and sixth episodes have an audio commentary from Haggard and Trodd.

Potter&#x27;s memorial service in November 1994 at St James&#x27;s Church in Piccadilly began with those in attendance singing &quot;Roll Along Prairie Moon&quot; to the accompaniment of a jazz quintet. Cheryl Campbell and Freddie Jones read their scene in the schoolroom from &quot;Pennies&quot;: &quot;As Jones stifled his tears, Campbell said: &#x27;Nobody ever ever stops yearning&#x27; ... In a comic interlude Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, Alan Yentob, controller of BBC1, and Kenith Trodd, Potter&#x27;s producer, read a scene from &quot;Pennies&quot;. [And Trodd] told of their last meeting before the playwright&#x27;s death from cancer: &#x27;Dennis slugging Courvoisier, fortified by liquid heroin and morphine ... after an hour he seemed to crumple and he said, &#x27;I do have one very real fear of death. It is that you might get asked to speak at my memorial service&#x27;.&quot;

==Episodes==
==Film adaptation==
In 1981, the series was adapted as a film, starring Steve Martin. Potter adapted his own screenplay, and Herbert Ross directed. Potter was nominated for the 1981 Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay. According to the &quot;Los Angeles Herald Examiner&quot;, Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer had him rewrite the script nine times, though &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported this as thirteen; Kenith Trodd remembered a &quot;dozen or so drafts&quot;. The movie features Bernadette Peters (as Eileen), Christopher Walken (as Tom) and Vernel Bagneris (as &#x27;the accordion man&#x27;). It was not successful at the box office.

MGM required Potter to buy back his copyright from the BBC (who demanded $100,000 plus half of any profits he would make from the film); the deal prevented broadcast of the original production of &quot;Pennies&quot; for approximately ten years. In 1989, the BBC was able to buy back the rights from MGM for what Trodd called &#x27;a very inconsiderable sum&#x27;, and rebroadcast &quot;Pennies&quot; in a six-week run beginning February 1990.

<text>Progress Energy was a power generation and distribution company. Prior to its merger with Duke Energy, it was a Fortune 500 energy company with more than 21,000 megawatts of generation capacity and $9 billion in annual revenues. Headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Progress Energy includes two major electric utilities that serve approximately 3.1 million customers in the Carolinas and Florida. As an independent company, the last chairman and CEO of Progress Energy was William D. Johnson; his predecessor was Robert McGehee, who died on October 9, 2007, at the age of 64 of a stroke while on a business trip to London.

Progress Energy is the majority owner and operator of the Brunswick, Crystal River 3, Robinson, and Shearon Harris nuclear power plants.

On October 16, 1999, third quarter earnings of Florida Progress Corp. fell 20.5 percent as damage from Hurricane Floyd.

On August 24, 1999, Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. said that it would acquire Florida Progress Corp. for $5.3 billion, creating the nation&#x27;s ninth-largest electric utility.

The company&#x27;s slogan prior to the Duke Energy merger was, &quot;People, performance, excellence.&quot;

==History==
In 2000, Carolina Power &amp; Light bought Florida Power Corporation and changed its name to Progress Energy. Progress Energy represents a family of companies, including CP&amp;L, Florida Power, Progress Telecom, NCNG and SRS, and an important new organization, Energy Ventures. The company built a new headquarters in downtown Raleigh in 2004.

On January 10, 2011, Duke Energy announced plans to take over Progress Energy in a $26 billion deal resulting in the country&#x27;s largest electric utility with 7.1 million customers. Duke Energy plans to &quot;maintain substantial operations in Raleigh.&quot; When the merger was completed on July 3, 2012, Duke Chairman James E. (Jim) Rogers became Chairman and CEO of the new combined company, while Progress CEO Bill Johnson resigned.

==Environmental record==
In 2008, the Corporate Responsibility Officer named Progress Energy to its list of 100 Best Corporate Citizens. Progress Energy was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index in 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006 and 2005.

The company is investing $300,000 in a UNC Chapel Hill study to map the offshore wind power potential of North Carolina. Progress Energy launched its SunSense-branded solar incentive programs in 2009.

Progress Energy has installed flue-gas desulfurization technology, or scrubbers, to remove sulfur dioxide emissions from its nine largest coal-fired power plant units.

Researchers at the University of Massachusetts Amherst identified Progress Energy as the 29th-largest corporate producer of Air pollution in the United States in 2002, when it released roughly 39 million pounds of toxic chemicals into the air. Major pollutants included nickel compounds, chromium compounds, sulfuric acid, and hydrochloric acid. Progress has also been named a potentially responsible party at the Carolina Transformer Co. Superfund toxic waste site, according to the Center for Public Integrity.

==Naming rights==
Progress Energy owned the naming rights to the University of Central Florida&#x27;s &quot;Progress Energy Welcome Center&quot;, St. Petersburg&#x27;s &quot;Progress Energy Park, home of Al Lang Field&quot;, Progress Energy Center for the Arts-Mahaffey Theater, and the &quot;Progress Energy Center for the Performing Arts&quot; in downtown Raleigh, NC.

<text>Psychonomics describes an approach to psychology that aims at discovering the laws (Greek: &#x27;nomos&#x27;) that govern the workings of the mind (Greek: &#x27;psyche&#x27;). The field is directly related to experimental psychology. The word is used most prominently by the Psychonomic Society, a society of experimental psychologists in the United States and around the world.

While the aims of psychonomics are, to some extent, similar to those of metaphysics its methods differ insofar as it takes a practical rather than theoretical approach.

<text>Charles Page Thomas Moore (February 8, 1831 – July 7, 1904) was a lawyer and justice of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals, who before the American Civil War had helped found the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in 1852 at Jefferson College (now Washington and Jefferson College) in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.

==Early and family life==

He was born in Lewisburg, Virginia in a portion of the state along the Ohio River which became West Virginia in his lifetime. His father had been born in Shenandoah County and moved across the Appalachian Mountains to the Greenbrier County area, but died when Charles was an infant. His paternal grandfather had married a daughter of Joseph Morgan, who helped settle the trans-Appalachian area. His mother, Augusta Delphia Page of Staunton, Virginia, a daughter of Major Charles Page, died in 1844 so Charles and his sister were raised by their uncle, George Moore in Mason County. When Charles was 16, he was sent to Marshall Academy in Huntington, and he would also study with John I Van Meter in Pike County, Pennsylvania, then attend Jefferson College (which later became Washington and Jefferson College) in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. While at Jefferson College, Charles Moore helped found the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity before graduating in 1853. Moore then briefly attended Union College in New York. Returning to Virginia, he studied law at the University of Virginia and completed the course in 1856.

He married Urilla Katherine Kline (1835-1897) of Hagerstown, Maryland, and they had four daughters: Ida Ogden Moore (1867–1948), Rebecca Francis Moore Bland (1870–1967), Mai L Moore (1873–1965) and Elizabeth Van Meter Moore (1874–1948).

==Career==

Admitted to the Virginia bar, Moore established his legal practice at Point Pleasant along the Ohio River near his foster father&#x27;s farm. In 1860 he won election as the Commonwealth&#x27;s attorney for Mason County. At various times he had legal partnerships with Nicholas Fitzhugh, James H. Couch and William Tomlinson.

After former Confederates were again allowed to hold office, Moore defeated Republican James F. Brown in 1870. He sat as a judge in the first session of the West Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals in 1870. Two years later, West Virginia adopted a new state Constitution, thereby cutting short all the terms of the three-judge court. Moore was a nominee of both parties in 1872 and among the five judges elected to the new Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals. He wrote and delivered 107 opinions before resigning in May 1881. His successor, Richmond-born James French Patton, a fellow Democrat, had been a former Confederate officer. However, in 1888, fellow Mason County lawyer John W. English would be elected to the West Virginia Supreme Court, then George Poffenbarger.

==Death and legacy==

Moore died at Gallipolis Ferry, Mason County, West Virginia in 1904. He is buried at Bruce Chapel cemetery in Mason County.

<doc id="906783" wikidata="Q5164405" url="?curid=906783" title="Constructible function">
<text>In complexity theory, a time-constructible function is a function &quot;f&quot; from natural numbers to natural numbers with the property that &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) can be constructed from &quot;n&quot; by a Turing machine in the time of order &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). The purpose of such a definition is to exclude functions that do not provide an upper bound on the runtime of some Turing machine.

==Time-constructible definitions==
There are two different definitions of a time-constructible function. In the first definition, a function &quot;f&quot; is called time-constructible if there exists a positive integer &quot;n&quot;0 and Turing machine &quot;M&quot; which, given a string 1&quot;n&quot; consisting of &quot;n&quot; ones, stops after exactly &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) steps for all &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;n&quot;0. In the second definition, a function &quot;f&quot; is called time-constructible if there exists a Turing machine &quot;M&quot; which, given a string 1&quot;n&quot;, outputs the binary representation of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) time (a unary representation may be used instead, since the two can be interconverted in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) time).

There is also a notion of a fully time-constructible function. A function &quot;f&quot; is called fully time-constructible if there exists a Turing machine &quot;M&quot; which, given a string 1&quot;n&quot; consisting of &quot;n&quot; ones, stops after exactly &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) steps. This definition is slightly less general than the first two but, for most applications, either definition can be used.

==Space-constructible definitions==
Similarly, a function &quot;f&quot; is space-constructible if there exists a positive integer &quot;n&quot;0 and a Turing machine &quot;M&quot; which, given a string 1&quot;n&quot; consisting of &quot;n&quot; ones, halts after using exactly &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) cells for all &quot;n&quot; ≥ &quot;n&quot;0. Equivalently, a function &quot;f&quot; is space-constructible if there exists a Turing machine &quot;M&quot; which, given a string 1&quot;n&quot; consisting of &quot;n&quot; ones, outputs the binary (or unary) representation of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), while using only &quot;O&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) space.

Also, a function &quot;f&quot; is fully space-constructible if there exists a Turing machine &quot;M&quot; which, given a string 1&quot;n&quot; consisting of &quot;n&quot; ones, halts after using exactly &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) cells.

==Examples==
All the commonly used functions &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) (such as &quot;n&quot;, &quot;nk&quot;, 2&quot;n&quot;) are time- and space-constructible, as long as &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is at least &quot;cn&quot; for a constant &quot;c&quot; &gt; 0. No function which is &quot;o&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) can be time-constructible unless it is eventually constant, since there is insufficient time to read the entire input. However, is a space-constructible function.

==Applications==
Time-constructible functions are used in results from complexity theory such as the time hierarchy theorem. They are important because the time hierarchy theorem relies on Turing machines that must determine in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)) time whether an algorithm has taken more than &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) steps. This is, of course, impossible without being able to calculate &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) in that time. Such results are typically true for all natural functions &quot;f&quot; but not necessarily true for artificially constructed &quot;f&quot;. To formulate them precisely, it is necessary to have a precise definition for &quot;a natural function f&quot; for which the theorem is true. Time-constructible functions are often used to provide such a definition.

Space-constructible functions are used similarly, for example in the space hierarchy theorem.

<doc id="906784" wikidata="Q56371" url="?curid=906784" title="Anlo Ewe">
<text>The Anlo Ewe are a sub-group of the Ewe people of approximately 6 million people, inhabiting southern Togo, southern Benin, southwest Nigeria, and south-eastern parts of the Volta Region of Ghana; meanwhile, a majority of Ewe are located in the entire southern half of Togo and southwest Benin. They are a patrilineal society governed by a hierarchal, centralized authority. Their language (self-name &quot;Anlogbe&quot;) is a dialect of the Ewe language, itself part of the Gbe language cluster. The Ewe religion is centered on the Supreme God, Mawu and several intermediate divinities. Christianity has been accepted in every part of Anlo Ewe land, with a minority of people still practicing traditional Vodun beliefs. The Vodu religion is slowly becoming a previous religion among the Anlo Ewes, with the youth of the community today practicing Christianity much more. However, those who still practice the Vodu religion also believe their tradition is a factor that keeps integrity and probit, while Christianity stands to pave way for integrity, honesty and probity to be washed away as years go by. It is for this reason that some Anlo Ewe people do away with Christianity when it comes to issues of accountability.

==Etymology==
The name Ŋlɔ (nlo) (&quot;of Aŋlɔ or Anlo&quot;) is said to derive from the Ewe term ŋlɔ or &#x27;nlo&#x27; which means rolling up or folding into oneself. It could also be interpreted as shrunken or shriveled skin. Torgbui Atsu Wenya, the founder of Anlo state was reputed to have uttered the words “me nlo “ in Ewe in his reluctance to migrate further when prompted by his kinsmen to do so. Wenya had separated from the other groups at nearby Wheta for the seashore.

==History==
It is thought they migrated to their present home from Notsie, Togo sometime in the later part of the seventeenth century. The move is said to be more of an escape than migration from a regime change in the city. Upon first arrival in Notsie, the current king, Adela Atogble, received them well, but after his death the successor, Togbe Agorkoli, ruled oppressively upon the Ghana Ewes. He ordered all elders to be killed. The King Agorkoli treated the people very badly. The city of Notsie was circumscribed by a large sacred wall which became a barrier to the Ewe devising escape. Upon consultation of the hidden elder, Tegli, the Ewe came up with an extravagant plan of escape. The people planned for the escape very well. For days the women of the group would moisten the wall in one place during their daily clothes washing activities. When the wall was weak enough, the plan then culminated in the gathering of all the Ewe, Tegli drawing the “Sword of Liberation” summoning the gods, and piercing the wall proclaiming, “O Mawuga Kitikata, ʋuʋɔ na mi ne miadogo, azɔ adzo” (Oh great God Kitikata, open the door for us so that we walk through). When they were escaping they walked backwards and separated, so that their King, King Agorkoli, would not trace or find them.

Most groups settled in villages in coastal regions of Togo, Benin, with some settling in south-eastern parts of the Volta Region of Ghana, many of which are associated with the slave trade that affected the Ewe populations. The Avenor Ewe settled to the north of the Anlo and are now to be found in Akatsi South District and Akatsi North District. A northern migration was the result of frequent slave raids and spread the Ewe people throughout southern Togo, southern Benin to south-western Nigeria. The shallow waters and many islands of Bight of Benin provided a safe-haven to all but the most aggressive slave traders.

==Political system==
The current political system stems from the necessity of military organization to deal with the conflicts in the 17th and 18th centuries. Upon arrival in the French Togoland, the Ewe people split into smaller subtribes or chiefdoms. Each was autonomous but acknowledged that they are all a single people. The Anlo is one of these tribes.

The Anlo adopted the military organisational methods of the Akwamu, including their wing system. The Anlo people were divided by geographical location to create three wings. The Lashibi, coming from the west, defended the left flank, the Adotri the center, and the Woe from the east, defended the right flank. All were under the rule of a loosely governing ‘central&#x27; authority, the king called Awoamefia.

Historically, the power of the central authority is rarely invoked; only in times of war or in need of serious judicial counseling. The king is chosen from one of two royal clans either the Adzovia or Bate; selection does not follow the traditional monarchal rule of primogeniture. The clans rotate the designation of kings, keeping one single clan from maintaining power. The selection is made by the elders of the clan from several candidates presented by the various sections of the clan. The elected king holds a position of divinity living in seclusion, only dealing with the three senior chiefs in charge of the geographical regions.

These three chiefs as well as the sub-chiefs and head-men in their respective areas have jurisdiction in investigation of crimes and to settle local disputes. The involved parties do have the right to appeal to the king after a ruling has been made in a lower court. The Awoamefia is assisted by two councils in the appeals decisions and general matters. One is composed of the elders of each clan; the other consists of the three military chiefs. Historically the council of elders is more influential based on the Anlo belief that the power of the king is vested in the people. “Du menɔa fia me o. Fiae nɔa du me” (The people do not live with the King. It is the King who lives with the people). If the King ruled out of favor of the people they had the right to replace him.

==Kinship system==

===The clan===
The Anlo-Ewe are a patrilineal people. Members each belong to a clan in which they believe to have descended along the male line. In most of the larger settlements, all clans are represented, sometimes by more than one lineage. Lineages are defined as a branch of the clan in which the male and female members can trace relationships back to a common male ancestor. The lineage, in contrast to the clan, is exogamous. Each lineage has its own symbols, ancestral shrine, common property and a lineage head. The head is usually the oldest surviving member of the lineage. He has the final say in most all decisions and disputes and regulates all dealings with lineage interests including land dispersal. On top of secular activities, the lineage head is also the chief priest. He leads many of the ceremonies and serves as the link between the living and dead as all religious offerings are presented to him.
The smallest unit within a lineage is a hut; this is either a wife and her unmarried children or the same with the husband as well. There is a practice of polygyny although a small percentage of men actually have more than one wife. The man is the head of the household or afe and can act without interference except from his father. There is a large respect for elders and as long as a father is around the son is expected to comply with any of his demands.

===Kinship terminology===

==Religion==
Traditionally, the Anlo-Ewe have one Supreme God Mawuga Kitikata or just Mawu. Mawu is synonymous with the Christian Almighty God and is believed to be all powerful and everywhere at once. There are no shrines or devotional ceremonies because of this omnipresent belief and instead the people practice religion through lower level divinities. These include Yewe, Afa, Eda, Nana, and Mami Wata. The first two are the most popular, each having a membership initiation process to worship.
Yewe is the god of thunder and lightning. When members are initiated under Yewe, a Yewe name is given at a graduation ceremony. The person&#x27;s old name now becomes taboo and if used, the speaker can be put in front of a council of priests to be sentenced to pay a large fine. 
Afa is the astral god of divination, also the younger brother of Yewe. Members do not get new names and keep their birth names. Performances are at the forefront of devotional activities for Afa. Members and non-members celebrate Afa together; however, the non-member must wear white clothing and can not dance next to a member unless at a funeral. If these rituals are not followed properly, non-members are fined.

===Funerals===
As elderly respect is in high regard in the Ewe society, funerals traditionally are extravagant events incorporating a multitude of events over a month&#x27;s span:

* Amedigbe: The body, previously preserved with herbs, is buried on this day usually two to three days after death.
* Ndinamegbe: The day after burial principal mourners are received.
*# Nudogbe: Day for wake-keeping 4–6 days after burial.
* Yofogbe: The day after wake-keeping lineage rituals are performed. Family members of the deceased receive gifts and donations for funeral expenses.
* Akontawogbe: Three days later donations are counted.
* Xomefewogbe: Several days after Akontawogbe a final cost of the funeral is calculated. If donations exceed costs, donations may be returned; if costs exceed donations additional sums may be raised.

Funeral donations are a main focus of ceremonies due to the high cost of an Anlo funeral. Costs include the coffin, burial clothes, public dances, food, alcohol, and provision of accommodations for distant guests.

In a more modernized and mobile society funeral ceremonies now usually take place over a single weekend, sometimes several weeks after death to allow for distant relatives to travel and allow for accommodation of employment or work.
Anlo-Ewe funerals are the most likely to involve colorful performances of dance and drumming groups. Lively and spectacular performances if the deceased was an honorable and involved member of the community. Sometimes distant family members may commission performances months after death if they could not be present at the actual funeral.

==Notes==

# Anlo is known for a peculiarity of its tonal system. Like neighbouring Ewe varieties, Anlo has three tone levels, High (H), Mid (M), and Low (L). Of these three levels, the lower two are not phonemically contrastive. However, Anlo contrasts with the other dialect in the possession of a fourth tone level, the extra-High tone (R). The R tone is viewed as an innovation of Anlo, since the most economic way of generalising about the R tone is to apply &#x27;R tone rules&#x27; to the common tonal forms to derive the Anlo tonal forms. Clements (1977) argues that the R tone is a case of tonal split caused by &#x27;reanalysis of downstepped tone sequences as sequences of tones on distinct tone levels&#x27; (p 168).

<text>Tommy Debo &quot;Tiny&quot; Lister Jr. (born Thomas Duane Lister Jr.; June 24, 1958 – December 10, 2020) was an American character actor and occasional professional wrestler known for his roles as the neighborhood bully Deebo in the 1995 film &quot;Friday&quot; and its 2000 sequel, and as President Lindberg in &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;. He had two short professional wrestling stints, with Hulk Hogan in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) after appearing as Zeus in the 1989 film &quot;No Holds Barred&quot; and resuming the feud as Z-Gangsta in 1996 for World Championship Wrestling (WCW). He was born with a detached and deformed retina and was blind in his right eye, which drooped, a unique look that he turned to his advantage in film. He played in both comedies and dramas, usually cast as &#x27;the heavy/big bully&#x27;.

==Early life==
Lister was born on June 24, 1958, in Pine Bluff, Arkansas, to Thomas Duane Lister and Mildred (Edwards) Lister. Since his birth, he had a deformed and detached retina in his right eye, causing permanent blindness.

Lister attended Palomar Junior College before transferring to Long Beach City College for his sophomore year. While at Long Beach, he recorded a shot put throw, which helped to earn him a scholarship to California State University, Los Angeles. In his senior year, he won the national shot put title with a mark of over . Lister was the 1982 NCAA Division II National Shot Put Champion.

After college, Lister competed for the Converse Track Club, eventually raising his shot put mark to , before trying out with the New Orleans Breakers of the United States Football League. He was cut after two exhibition games and opted to pursue acting instead.

==Acting career==
Lister was mostly recognized as the antagonist known as Deebo from 1995&#x27;s &quot;Friday&quot;. Deebo was the neighborhood&#x27;s dog-eat-dog thug and bruiser to every character, including Ice Cube&#x27;s main character Craig Jones. He reprised the role in the film&#x27;s sequel, &quot;Next Friday&quot; (2000), but did not appear in the third film of the series, &quot;Friday After Next&quot; (2002). He did, however, appear in Cube&#x27;s directorial debut &quot;The Players Club&quot;. He played the role of Obodo in Mario Van Peebles&#x27; &quot;Posse&quot; (1993), along with Tone Loc.

Lister had numerous guest appearances on TV series, including playing Klaang, the first Klingon to make contact with humans, in the pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;. He co-starred in a two-part episode of the courtroom series &quot;Matlock&quot; as Mr. Matlock&#x27;s in-prison bodyguard. He appeared in season 7 episode 9 of &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;, and in season 1 episode 15 of &quot;ER&quot;. He also starred in the sitcom &quot;1st &amp; Ten&quot; as Otis.

Lister&#x27;s film roles included playing in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; and &quot;Austin Powers in Goldmember&quot;. Lister was featured in &quot;The Fifth Element&quot; as the Galactic President. He appeared in the Adam Sandler film &quot;Little Nicky&quot; as Nicky&#x27;s older brother Cassius.

Lister was the main police officer in Chamillionaire&#x27;s &quot;Ridin&#x27;&quot; video and reprised his role as a police officer in Chamillionaire&#x27;s 2012 single &quot;Show Love&quot;. He has appeared in the Ice Cube videos for &quot;Friday&quot; (from the &quot;Friday&quot; soundtrack) and &quot;You Can Do It&quot; (from the &quot;Next Friday&quot; soundtrack). Lister appeared via both original footage and clips from the film. He was in the videos for Young Bleed&#x27;s &quot;How You Do Dat&quot;, French Montana&#x27;s &quot;I Told &#x27;Em&quot; and 50 Cent&#x27;s &quot;Many Men (Wish Death)&quot;. Lister portrayed Sancho in the Sublime music video &quot;Santeria&quot;.

In the Quentin Tarantino film &quot;Jackie Brown&quot;, he played bail agent Winston, who &quot;finds people who don&#x27;t want to be found&quot;. In 2015, Lister filmed &quot;Busy Day&quot; in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Lister had a supporting role in the 2016 Disney animated movie &quot;Zootopia&quot; as the voice of the diminutive fennec fox, Finnick. He appeared in a commercial that year for Ball Park-brand beef jerky, advertised as &quot;tough, but tender.&quot;

In the 40 years of his acting career, Lister accumulated more than 200 acting credits.

Cast as an habitual &#x27;bad guy&#x27; in films, his career prospered. He was a frequent collaborator with Ice Cube. Lister later became the spokesperson for Monster Energy Drink in the 2010s.

==Professional wrestling career==

===World Wrestling Federation (1989–1990)===
Lister appeared in the 1989 wrestling movie &quot;No Holds Barred&quot;, which was financed by the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) and starred Hulk Hogan. Lister&#x27;s role was Zeus, a brutal monster heel. &quot;No Holds Barred&quot; inspired a feud in the WWF during the latter half of 1989. Lister was billed as &quot;Zeus: The Human Wrecking Machine&quot;, and used the same &quot;monster heel&quot; gimmick in his matches by no-selling his opponent&#x27;s moves. He would yell, &quot;Aw! Aw!&quot; and pound on his chest several times during his interviews and in the ring. Zeus would eventually demand Hogan to face him in the ring.

Citing jealousy for being billed under Hogan and anger over losing to Hogan in the film, Zeus wanted to beat him in &quot;real life&quot;. Zeus formed an alliance with fellow Hogan rival &quot;Macho Man&quot; Randy Savage to feud with Hogan and his friend, Brutus &quot;The Barber&quot; Beefcake. The two teams faced off at the 1989 SummerSlam event in a tag team match which saw Hogan and Beefcake prevail as the victors, with Hogan pinning Zeus. Following SummerSlam, Zeus formed an alliance with &quot;The Million Dollar Man&quot; Ted DiBiase leading into that year&#x27;s Survivor Series.

At the event, the team of The Hulkamaniacs (Hulk Hogan, Jake &quot;The Snake&quot; Roberts, and Demolition) faced The Million Dollar Team (Ted DiBiase, Zeus, and The Powers of Pain). Zeus was eliminated from the match via disqualification after refusing to break a chokehold on Hogan and shoving the referee away. The Hulkamaniacs went on to win the match, defeating the other team. After the Survivor Series, the feud between Hulk Hogan and Brutus Beefcake versus Randy Savage and Zeus ended with a steel cage match on December 27, 1989, at the No Holds Barred pay-per-view event. Hogan and Beefcake were once again victorious in what would be Zeus&#x27;s last match in the WWF. Lister&#x27;s final WWF appearance was a promotional spot for the 1990 Royal Rumble.

===World Wrestling Council (1990)===
On July 7, 1990, Zeus fought Abdullah the Butcher in a double countout at a World Wrestling Council show in Puerto Rico.

===World Championship Wrestling (1996)===
Lister spent March 1996 in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Z-Gangsta, as part of The Alliance to End Hulkamania, culminating in failure at Uncensored. He debuted the previous week with fellow actor/wrestler Robert Swenson, who was billed as The Ultimate Solution.

==Legacy and awards==
U.S. national shot put title with a mark of over and 1982 NCAA Division II National Shot Put Champion.

The athletic department of Lister&#x27;s alma mater Cal State LA sponsors an annual track meet in his name.

In 2016, he was nominated for the &quot;Best Bad Mu#&amp;a Award&quot; at the All Def Movie Awards. In 2014 at the Orlando Urban Film Festival, he won &quot;Best Star Spotlight&quot; for his performance in &quot;No Weapon Formed Against Us&quot;.

==Personal life==

===Marriage===
He was married to Felicia Forbes, formerly of Cape Town, where they married.

They had one son, Thomas Duane Lister III.

===Legal issues===
On August 31, 2012, Lister agreed to plead guilty to conspiring to commit mortgage fraud, in a scheme that led to $3.8 million in losses. He was charged with fraudulently buying homes in order to withdraw $1.1 million in home equity loans. In April 2014, he was out on bail and was confident of avoiding prison. He stated, &quot;What&#x27;s so cool about God and our government is that you can make a mistake and they will forgive you if you just a good person and doing right.&quot;

===Health problems===
By age 55, Lister had type 2 diabetes.

Lister was diagnosed with COVID-19 around August 2020 and overcame the illness. He became ill with symptoms similar to COVID-19 a second time in early December, exhibiting weakness and trouble breathing, which forced him to cancel shooting for a film. His manager Cindy McGowen, who said it was not normal for him to miss filmings, became concerned and sent her assistant to his house to give him vitamins and antibiotics.

==Death==
On December 10, 2020, police performing a wellness check found Lister dead in his home in Marina del Rey, California; he was 62 years old. The coroner&#x27;s office investigated his cause of death, However, the final autopsy report revealed that the cause of death was hypertension and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease.

In a Twitter encomium, Ice Cube recalled Lister&#x27;s sense of humor: &quot;RIP Tiny &#x27;Deebo&#x27; Lister. America&#x27;s favorite bully was a born entertainer who would pop into character at the drop of a hat terrifying people on and off camera. Followed by a big smile and laugh ... Thank you for being a good dude at heart. I miss you already.&quot;

<doc id="906788" wikidata="Q11142874" url="?curid=906788" title="Jope Seniloli">
<text>&quot;[[Ratu]]&quot; Jope Naucabalavu Seniloli (14 June 1939 – 28 June 2015) was a Fijian chief who held the title of &quot;Turaga Taukei Naua&quot; and who served as Fiji&#x27;s vice-president from 25 March 2001 to 29 November 2004, when he was forced to resign following his conviction for treason on 6 August 2004, and the rejection of his appeal early in November.

== Biography ==
Seniloli was appointed vice-president in 2000 as an apparent gesture of appeasement towards the supporters of the 2000 coup which deposed the lawfully elected government of President &quot;Ratu Sir&quot; Kamisese Mara and Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry. The 6 August 2004 verdict found Seniloli guilty of unlawfully proclaiming himself President during the coup, and of illegally swearing in cabinet ministers, including George Speight, the chief instigator of the coup, as Prime Minister. Seniloli&#x27;s lawyer, Mehboob Raza, maintained that he had done so only &quot;under duress,&quot; at gunpoint, a defence rejected by High Court Justice Nazhat Shameem, who agreed with the state prosecutor that Seniloli had known of the coup plot in advance and had deliberately aided and abetted it. Shameem said that she had originally intended to sentence Seniloli to six years&#x27; imprisonment, but had opted for a four-year sentence instead, taking account of his many years of service to Fiji, including thirty-three years as a schoolteacher.

Along with Seniloli, the Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives, &quot;Ratu&quot; Rakuita Vakalalabure, and three other defendants, were sentenced to terms of between one and six years for the same offence.

In a controversial move, Attorney-General Qoriniasi Bale announced on 29 November 2004 that he had decided to release Seniloli from prison on medical grounds, a decision which angered the Labour Party. &quot;The FLP is outraged by the jailed VP&#x27;s early release from prison,&quot; declared Senator Jokapeci Koroi, the national president of the Labour Party. &quot;This is nothing but a conspiracy by the Government to save those who are in positions of power.&quot; Koroi called the release of Seniloli, who had served less than four months of his four-year term, an &quot;act of defiance to subvert the course of justice and the rule of law.&quot; Reverend Akuila Yabaki of the Citizens Constitutional Forum also criticized the release.

The military forces were also displeased, and took what was widely seen as an extraordinary step by issuing a public statement. Captain Neumi Leweni of the Royal Fiji Military Forces media cell called the early release &quot;an insult to our sense of justice and the rule of law&quot; and a &quot;riot.&quot; &quot;We are falling fast into the abyss and if nothing is done about this quickly, we will continue falling, never to recover,&quot; Leweni said. He and other senior military said they believed the release of Ratu Jope was a political ploy to gain the support of &quot;the same type of people who gathered in droves at the parliamentary complex in 2000&quot; – a reference to the supporters of the coup. The officers predicted that if the Attorney General was not reined in quickly, there could be &quot;a return to the mayhem of 2000.&quot; Leweni&#x27;s judgement that Ratu Seniloli&#x27;s release threatened national security was subsequently backed up by Commodore Frank Bainimarama, the Commander of the Armed Forces.

Joji Kotobalavu, a spokesman for Prime Minister Laisenia Qarase, rejected the criticism and said that the military had acted improperly by issuing a political statement. The senior officers should have notified the Home Affairs Ministry of their feelings privately, he said, adding that by publicly airing their opinions, the military was creating a climate of &quot;uncertainty,&quot; leading people to wonder whether the government or the military was running the country.

Ratu Seniloli&#x27;s early release was coupled with his resignation from office. Although not stated, this was believed to be a condition of his release. A government spokesman said that Ratu Seniloli would receive a pension equivalent to 30 percent of his vice-presidential salary.

By law, prisoners are not eligible for release until half their sentence has been served, but a special case was made for Seniloli due to the poor state of his health. He was released into &quot;compulsory supervision,&quot; under which he is required to report daily to the police, and is not allowed to change his address or travel outside of Fiji without permission.

The Fijian Constitution assigns a purely ceremonial role to vice-president, with one important exception: he assumes the powers and duties of the presidency in the event of the President being unable to carry out his duties. With the 84-year-old president, &quot;Ratu&quot; Josefa Iloilo suffering from Parkinson&#x27;s disease and requiring frequent visits to Australia for medical treatment, the resignation of the vice-president left Fiji with no one to take Iloilo&#x27;s place should he become incapacitated, and the appointment of a successor was considered a priority. On 15 December 2004, the Great Council of Chiefs approved President Iloilo&#x27;s choice of Ratu Joni Madraiwiwi as the new vice-president.

* &quot;See main article: 2006 Fiji presidential election&quot;

On 16 February 2006, the Fiji Village news service claimed that some Tailevu chiefs were quietly campaigning for the Great Council of Chiefs to reinstate Seniloli as vice-president. The Council was due to meet as an electoral college on 8 March to choose the president and vice-president, whose terms were due to expire. Without naming Seniloli, the Military expressed its opposition to any coup-convict being appointed president or vice-president. Seniloli himself, however, revealed to &quot;Fiji Village&quot; on 22 February that as he was still technically serving his prison sentence extramurally, he was not eligible for reinstatement.

He died on 28 June 2015 at the age of 76.

<text>&lt;section begin=Lead /&gt;
The Annexation of Hyderabad (code-named Operation Polo) was a military operation launched in September 1948 that resulted in the annexation of the princely state of Hyderabad by India, which was dubbed a &quot;police action&quot;.

At the time of partition of India in 1947, the princely states of India, who in principle had self-government within their territories, were subject to subsidiary alliances with the British, which gave control of external relations to the British. With the Indian Independence Act 1947, the British abandoned all such alliances, leaving the states with the option of opting for full independence. However, by 1948 almost all had acceded to either India or Pakistan. One major exception was that of the wealthiest and most powerful principality, Hyderabad, where the Nizam, &quot;Mir&quot; Osman Ali Khan, Asaf Jah VII, a Muslim ruler who presided over a largely Hindu population, chose independence and hoped to maintain this with an irregular army. The Nizam was also beset by the Telangana rebellion, which he was unable to crush.

In November 1947, Hyderabad signed a standstill agreement with the Dominion of India, continuing all previous arrangements except for the stationing of Indian troops in the state. India felt that the establishment of a Communist state in Hyderabad would be a threat to the country. Nizam&#x27;s power had weakened because of the Telangana Rebellion and the rise of a radical paramilitary group known as the Razakars whom he could not put down. On 7 September, Jawaharlal Nehru gave ultimatum to Nizam, demanding ban on the Razakars and return of Indian troops to Secunderabad. India invaded the state by 13 September 1948, following a crippling economic blockade, and multiple attempts at destabilising the state through railway disruptions, the bombing of government buildings, and raids on border villages. After the defeat of Razakars, the Nizam signed an instrument of accession, joining India.

The operation led to massive violence on communal lines, at times perpetrated by the Indian Army. The Sunderlal Committee, appointed by Indian prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru, concluded that between 30,000 and 40,000 people had died in total in the state, in a report which was not released until 2013. Other responsible observers estimated the number of deaths to be 200,000 or higher.&lt;section end=Lead /&gt;

== Background ==

After the Siege of Golconda by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in 1687, the region was renamed as &quot;Deccan Subah&quot; (due to its geographical proximity in the Deccan Plateau) and in 1713 Qamar-ud-din Khan (later known as &quot;Asaf Jah I&quot; or &quot;Nizam I&quot;) was appointed its Subahdar and bestowed with the title of &quot;Nizam-ul-Mulk&quot; by the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar. Hyderabad&#x27;s nominal independence is dated to 1724 when the Nizam won a military victory over a rival military appointee. In 1798, Hyderabad became the first Indian princely state to accede to British protection under the policy of Subsidiary Alliance instituted by Arthur Wellesley, and was thus named as the State of Hyderabad.

The State of Hyderabad under the leadership of its 7th Nizam, &quot;Mir&quot; Sir Osman Ali Khan, was the largest and most prosperous of all the princely states in India. With annual revenues of over Rs. 9 crore, it covered of fairly homogeneous territory and comprised a population of roughly 16.34 million people (as per the 1941 census) of which a majority (85%) was Hindu. The state had its own army, airline, telecommunication system, railway network, postal system, currency and radio broadcasting service. Hyderabad was a multi-lingual state consisting of people speaking Telugu (48.2%), Marathi (26.4%), Kannada (12.3%) and Urdu (10.3%). Despite the overwhelming Hindu majority, Hindus were severely under-represented in government, police and the military. Of 1765 officers in the State Army, 1268 were Muslims, 421 were Hindus, and 121 others were Christians, Parsis and Sikhs. Of the officials drawing a salary between Rs. 600 and 1200 per month, 59 were Muslims, 5 were Hindus and 38 were of other religions. The Nizam and his nobles, who were mostly Muslims, owned 40% of the total land in the state.

When the British departed from the Indian subcontinent in 1947, they offered the various princely states in the subcontinent the option of acceding to either India or Pakistan or staying on as an independent state. As stated by Sardar Patel at a press conference in January 1948, &quot;As you are all aware, on the lapse of Paramountcy every Indian State became a separate independent entity.&quot; In India, a small number of states, including Hyderabad, declined to join the new dominion. In the case of Pakistan, accession happened far more slowly. Hyderabad had been part of the calculations of all-India political parties since the 1930s. The leaders of the new Dominion of India were wary of a Balkanization of India if Hyderabad was left independent.

Hyderabad state has been steadily becoming more theocratic since the beginning of the 20th century. In 1926, Mahmud Nawazkhan, a retired Hyderabad official, founded the Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (also known as Ittehad or MIM). Its objectives were to unite the Muslims in the State in support of Nizam and to reduce the Hindu majority by large-scale conversion to Islam. The MIM became a powerful communal organisation, with the principal focus to marginalise the political aspirations of the Hindus and moderate Muslims.

==Events preceding hostilities==
===Political and diplomatic negotiations===
&quot;Mir&quot; Sir Osman Ali Khan, Nizam of Hyderabad, initially approached the British government with a request to take on the status of an independent constitutional monarchy within the Commonwealth of Nations. This request was, however, rejected by the last Viceroy of India, The 1st Viscount Mountbatten of Burma.

At the time of the British withdrawal from India, the Nizam announced that he did not intend to join either new dominion, and proceeded to appoint trade representatives in European countries and to begin negotiations with the Portuguese, seeking to lease or buy Goa to provide his state with access to the sea.

B. R. Ambedkar, the Law Minister in the first independent Indian government considered the state of Hyderabad to be &quot;a new problem which may turn out to be worse than the Hindu-Muslim problem as it is sure to result in the further Balkanisation of India&quot;. According to the writer A. G. Noorani, Indian Prime Minister Nehru&#x27;s concern was to defeat what he called Hyderabad&#x27;s &quot;secessionist venture&quot;, but he favoured talks and considered military option as a last resort. In Nehru&#x27;s observation, the state of Hyderabad was &quot;full of dangerous possibilities&quot;. Sardar Patel of the Indian National Congress, however, took a hard line, and had no patience with talks.

Accordingly, the Indian government offered Hyderabad a standstill agreement which made an assurance that the status quo would be maintained and no military action would be taken for one year. According to this agreement, India would handle Hyderabad&#x27;s foreign affairs, but Indian Army troops stationed in Secunderabad would be removed. In Hyderabad city there was a huge demonstration by Razakars led by Syed Qasim Razvi in October 1947, against the administration&#x27;s decision to sign the Standstill Agreement. This demonstration in front of the houses of the main negotiators, the Prime Minister, the Nawab of Chattari, Sir Walter Monckton, advisor to the Nizam, and Minister Nawab Ali Nawaz Jung, forced them to call off their Delhi visit to sign the agreement at that time.

Hyderabad violated all clauses of the agreement: in external affairs, by carrying out intrigues with Pakistan, to which it secretly loaned 15 million pounds; in defence, by building up a large semi-private army; in communications, by interfering with the traffic at the borders and the through traffic of Indian railways. India was also accused of violating the agreement by imposing an economic blockade. It turned out that the state of Bombay was interfering with supplies to Hyderabad without the knowledge of Delhi. The Government promised to take up the matter with the provincial governments, but scholar Lucien Benichou states that it was never done. There were also delays in arms shipments to Hyderabad from India.

Jawaharlal Nehru in a reception to the Bombay Union of Journalists on 26 April 1948 laid out his government&#x27;s position:

&quot;If the safety of the people in Hyderabad was endangered by the activities of Razakars, the Government would intervene in Hyderabad State. The time 
had arrived when this hostility must cease. If the Hyderabad Government could not stop it, other measures would be adopted.&quot;

Muhammad Ali Jinnah reportedly warned the then Viceroy Lord Mountbatten, &quot;If Congress attempted to exert any pressure on Hyderabad, every Muslim throughout the whole of India, yes, all the hundred million Muslims, would rise as one man to defend the oldest Muslim dynasty in India.&quot; According to Taylor C. Sherman, &quot;India claimed that the government of Hyderabad was edging towards independence by divesting itself of its Indian securities, banning the Indian currency, halting the export of ground nuts, organising illegal gun-running from Pakistan, and inviting recruits to its army and its irregular forces, the Razakars.&quot; The Hyderabadi envoys accused India of setting up armed barricades on all land routes and of attempting to economically isolate their nation.

In the summer of 1948, Indian officials, especially Patel, signalled an intention to invade; Britain encouraged India to resolve the issue without the use of force but refused Nizam&#x27;s requests to help.

The Nizam also made unsuccessful attempts to seek the intervention of the United Nations.

===Telangana Rebellion===

In late 1945, there started a peasant uprising in the Telangana area, led by communists. The communists drew their support from various quarters. Among the poor peasants, there were grievances against the jagirdari system, which covered 43% of land holding. Initially, they also drew support from wealthier peasants who also fought under the communist banner, but by 1948, the coalition had disintegrated. According to the Indian Intelligence Bureau Deputy Director, the social and economic programs of the communists were &quot;positive and in some cases great...The communists redistributed land and livestock, reduced rates, ended forced labour and increased wages by one hundred per cent. They inoculated the population and built public latrines; they encouraged women&#x27;s organisations, discouraged sectarian sentiment and sought to abolish untouchability.&quot;

Initially, in 1945, the communists targeted zamindars and even the Hindu deshmukhs, but soon they launched a full-fledged revolt against the Nizam. Starting in mid-1946, the conflict between the Razakars and the Communists became increasingly violent, with both sides resorting to increasingly brutal methods. According to an Indian government pamphlet, the communists had killed about 2,000 people by 1948.

===Communal violence before the operation===
&lt;section begin=prior /&gt;
In the 1936–37 Indian elections, the Muslim League under Muhammad Ali Jinnah had sought to harness Muslim aspirations and had won the adherence of MIM leader Nawab Bahadur Yar Jung, who campaigned for an Islamic State centred on the Nizam as the Sultan dismissing all claims for democracy. The Arya Samaj, a Hindu revivalist movement, had been demanding greater access to power for the Hindu majority since the late 1930s and was curbed by the Nizam in 1938. The Hyderabad State Congress joined forces with the Arya Samaj as well as the Hindu Mahasabha in the State.

Noorani regards the MIM under Nawab Bahadur Yar Jung as explicitly committed to safeguarding the rights of religious and linguistic minorities. However, this changed with the ascent of Qasim Razvi after the Nawab died in 1944.

Even as India and Hyderabad negotiated, most of the sub-continent had been thrown into chaos as a result of communal Hindu-Muslim riots pending the imminent partition of India. Fearing a Hindu civil uprising in his kingdom, the Nizam allowed Razvi to set up a voluntary militia of Muslims called the &#x27;Razakars&#x27;. The Razakars – who numbered up to 200,000 at the height of the conflict – swore to uphold Islamic domination in Hyderabad and the Deccan plateau in the face of growing public opinion amongst the majority Hindu population favouring the accession of Hyderabad into the Indian Union.

According to an account by Mohammed Hyder, a civil servant in Osmanabad district, a variety of armed militant groups, including &quot;Razakars&quot; and &quot;Deendars&quot; and ethnic militias of Pathans and Arabs claimed to be defending the Islamic faith and made claims on the land. &quot;From the beginning of 1948, the Razakars had extended their activities from Hyderabad city into the towns and rural areas, murdering Hindus, abducting women, pillaging houses and fields, and looting non-Muslim property in a widespread reign of terror.&quot; &quot;Some women became victims of rape and kidnapping by Razakars. Thousands went to jail and braved the cruelties perpetuated by the oppressive administration. Due to the activities of the Razakars, thousands of Hindus had to flee from the state and take shelter in various camps&quot;. Precise numbers are not known, but 40,000 refugees were received by the Central Provinces. This led to terrorising of the Hindu community, some of whom went across the border into independent India and organised raids into Nizam&#x27;s territory, which further escalated the violence. Many of these raiders were controlled by the Congress leadership in India and had links with extremist religious elements in the Hindutva fold. In all, more than 150 villages (of which 70 were in Indian territory outside Hyderabad State) were pushed into violence.

Hyder mediated some efforts to minimise the influence of the Razakars. Razvi, while generally receptive, vetoed the option of disarming them, saying that with the Hyderabad state army ineffective, the Razakars were the only means of self-defence available. By the end of August 1948, a full-blown invasion by India was imminent.

===Hyderabadi military preparations===

The Nizam was in a weak position as his army numbered only 24,000 men, of whom only some 6,000 were fully trained and equipped. These included Arabs, Rohillas, North Indian Muslims and Pathans. The State Army consisted of three armoured regiments, a horse cavalry regiment, 11 infantry battalions and artillery. These were supplemented by irregular units with horse cavalry, four infantry battalions (termed as the Saraf-e-khas, paigah, Arab and Refugee) and a garrison battalion. This army was commanded by Major General El Edroos, an Arab. 55 per cent of the Hyderabadi army was composed of Muslims, with 1,268 Muslims in a total of 1,765 officers as of 1941.

In addition to these, there were about 200,000 irregular militia called the Razakars under the command of a civilian leader Kasim Razvi. A quarter of these were armed with modern small firearms, while the rest were predominantly armed with muzzle-loaders and swords.

===Skirmish at Kodad===
On 6 September an Indian police post near Chillakallu village came under heavy fire from Razakar units. The Indian Army command sent a squadron of The Poona Horse led by Abhey Singh and a company of 2/5 Gurkha Rifles to investigate who was also fired upon by the Razakars. The tanks of the Poona Horse then chased the Razakars to Kodad, in Hyderabad territory. Here they were opposed by the armoured cars of 1st Hyderabad Lancers. In a brief action, the Poona Horse destroyed one armoured car and forced the surrender of the state garrison at Kodad.

===Indian military preparations===
On receiving directions from the government to seize and annex Hyderabad, the Indian army came up with the &quot;Goddard Plan&quot; (laid out by Lt. Gen. E. N. Goddard, the Commander-in-Chief of the Southern Command). The plan envisaged two main thrusts – from Vijayawada in the East and Solapur in the West – while smaller units pinned down the Hyderabadi army along the border. Overall command was placed in the hands of Lt. Gen. Rajendrasinghji, DSO.

The attack from Solapur was led by Major General Jayanto Nath Chaudhuri and was composed of four task forces:
# Strike Force comprising a mix of fast-moving infantry, cavalry and light artillery,
# Smash Force consisting of predominantly armoured units and artillery,
# Kill Force composed of infantry and engineering units,
# Vir Force which comprised infantry, anti-tank and engineering units.
The attack from Vijayawada was led by Major General Ajit Rudra and comprised the 2/5 Gurkha Rifles, one squadron of the 17th (Poona) Horse, and a troop from the 19th Field Battery along with engineering and ancillary units. In addition, four infantry battalions were to neutralise and protect lines of communication. Two squadrons of Hawker Tempest aircraft were prepared for air support from the Pune base.

Nehru, in a letter to V. K. Krishna Menon dated to 29 August 1948, wrote that &quot;I am convinced that it is impossible to arrive at any solution of the Hyderabad problem by settlement or peaceful negotiation. Military action becomes essential, we call it as you have called it Police Action.&quot; It was also believed that there could be a possible military response by Pakistan. The &quot;Time&quot; magazine pointed out that if India invaded Hyderabad, Razakars would massacre Hindus, which would lead to retaliatory massacres of Muslims across India.&lt;section end=prior /&gt; On September 7, Jawaharlal Nehru gave ultimatum to Nizam, demanding ban on the Razakars and return of Indian troops to Secunderabad. Pakistan foreign minister Muhammad Zafarullah Khan warned India against this ultimatum. Nehru then launched the invasion on 13 September, after the death of Jinnah on 11 September.

==Commencement of hostilities==

===Day 1, 13 September===
Indian forces entered the state at 4 a.m. The first battle was fought at Naldurg Fort on the Solapur Secunderabad Highway between a defending force of the 1st Hyderabad Infantry and the attacking force of the 7th Brigade. Using speed and surprise, the 7th Brigade managed to secure a vital bridge on the Bori River intact, following which an assault was made on the Hyderabadi positions at Naldurg by the 2nd Sikh Regiment. The bridge and road secured, an armoured column of the 1st Armoured Brigade – part of the Smash force – moved into the town of Jalkot, 8 km from Naldurg, at 0900 hours, paving the way for the Strike Force units under Lt. Col Ram Singh Commanding Officer of 9 Dogra (a motorised battalion) to pass through. This armoured column reached the town of Umarga, 61 km inside Hyderabad by 1515 hours, where it quickly overpowered resistance from Razakar units defending the town.
Meanwhile, another column consisting of a squadron of 3rd Cavalry, a troop from 18th King Edward&#x27;s Own Cavalry, a troop from 9 Para Field Regiment, 10 Field Company Engineers, 3/2 Punjab Regiment, 2/1 Gurkha Rifles, 1 Mewar Infantry, and ancillary units attacked the town of Tuljapur, about 34 km north-west of Naldurg. They reached Tuljapur at dawn, where they encountered resistance from a unit of the 1st Hyderabad Infantry and about 200 Razakars who fought for two hours before surrendering. Further advance towards the town of Lohara was stalled as the river had swollen. The first day on the Western Front ended with the Indians inflicting heavy casualties on the Hyderabadis and capturing large tracts of territory. Amongst the captured defenders was a British mercenary who had been tasked with blowing up the bridge near Naldurg.

In the East, forces led by Lt. Gen A.A. Rudra met with fierce resistance from two armoured car cavalry units of the Hyderabad State Forces, equipped with Humber armoured cars and Staghounds, namely the 2nd and 4th Hyderabad Lancers, but managed to reach the town of Kodar by 0830 hours. Pressing on, the force reached Munagala by the afternoon.

There were further incidents in Hospet – where the 1st Mysore assaulted and secured a sugar factory from units of Razakars and Pathans – and at Tungabhadra – where the 5/5 Gurkha attacked and secured a vital bridge from the Hyderabadi army.

===Day 2, 14 September===
The force that had camped at Umarga proceeded to the town of Rajeshwar, 48 km east. As aerial reconnaissance had shown well-entrenched ambush positions set up along the way, the air strikes from squadrons of Tempests were called in. These air strikes effectively cleared the route and allowed the land forces to reach and secure Rajeshwar by the afternoon.

The assault force from the East was meanwhile slowed by an anti-tank ditch and later came under heavy fire from hillside positions of the 1st Lancers and 5th Infantry 6 km from Suryapet. The positions were assaulted by the 2/5 Gurkha – veterans of the Burma Campaign – and were neutralised, with the Hyderabadis taking severe casualties.

At the same time, the 3/11 Gurkha Rifles and a squadron of 8th Cavalry attacked Osmanabad and took the town after heavy street combat with the Razakars who determinedly resisted the Indians.

A force under the command of Maj. Gen. D.S. Brar was tasked with capturing the city of Aurangabad. The city was attacked by six columns of infantry and cavalry, resulting in the civil administration emerging in the afternoon and offering a surrender to the Indians.

There were further incidents in Jalna where 3 Sikhs, a company of 2 Jodhpur infantry and some tanks from 18 Cavalry faced stubborn resistance from Hyderabadi forces.

===Day 3, 15 September===
Leaving a company of 3/11 Gurkhas to occupy the town of Jalna, the remainder of the force moved to Latur, and later to Mominabad where they faced action against the 3 Golconda Lancers who gave token resistance before surrendering.

At the town of Suryapet, air strikes cleared most of the Hyderabadi defences, although some Razakar units still gave resistance to the 2/5 Gurkhas who occupied the town. The retreating Hyderabadi forces destroyed the bridge at Musi to delay the Indians but failed to offer covering fire, allowing the bridge to be quickly repaired. Another incident occurred at Narkatpalli where a Razakar unit was decimated by the Indians.

===Day 4, 16 September===
The task force under Lt. Col. Ram Singh moved towards Zahirabad at dawn but was slowed by a minefield, which had to be cleared. On reaching the junction of the Bidar road with the Solapur-Hyderabad City Highway, the forces encountered gunfire from ambush positions. However, leaving some of the units to handle the ambush, the bulk of the force moved on to reach 15 kilometres beyond Zahirabad by nightfall despite sporadic resistance along the way. Most of the resistance was from Razakar units who ambushed the Indians as they passed through urban areas. The Razakars were able to use the terrain to their advantage until the Indians brought in their 75 mm guns.

===Day 5, 17 September===
In the early hours of 17 September, the Indian army entered Bidar. Meanwhile, forces led by the 1st Armoured regiment were at the town of Chityal about 60 km from Hyderabad, while another column took over the town of Hingoli. By the morning of the 5th day of hostilities, it had become clear that the Hyderabad army and the Razakars had been routed on all fronts and with extremely heavy casualties. At 5 pm on 17 September, the Nizam announced a ceasefire, thus ending the armed action.

== Hyderabad at the United Nations ==
The Government of Hyderabad, on 21 August 1948 informed Security Council that a &quot;grave dispute which had arisen between Hyderabad and India&quot; be brought to its attention. Later on 12 September reported first the &quot;threat of invasion, and then an actual invasion by India&quot;. The issue was admitted to the agenda of the Security Council at its 357th meeting, held at Paris on 16 September 1948. Nizam deputed five men to represent Hyderabad at the United Nations. These five were Moin Nawaz Jung, Muhammad Hamidullah, Yousuf Hussain Khan, Zaheer Ahmad and Pingle Venkatram Reddy. The representative of Hyderabad stated that Hyderabad had obtained full independence on 15 August 1947 when British suzerainty over the territory ended. Hyderabad representatives expressed a willingness to hold a plebiscite under the supervision of the United Nations. They asked the council to use its powers to halt the &quot;invasion&quot; and ask India to withdraw its troops. The representative of India maintained that Hyderabad was not competent to bring any question before the Security Council as it was neither a State nor independent. India also informed the Security Council the reign of terror by &quot;private armies&quot; in Hyderabad, and other events which, he said, had obliged the Government of India to take action.

On September 20, 1948s, during the 359th meeting of Security Council a representative from India informed that Nizam had instructed the representative of Hyderabad to withdraw the complaint from Security Council. On 22 September 1948 a cable sent by Nizam to Secretary General confirmed the same. The cable also stated that that Hyderabad delegation at United Nations ceased to have any authority to either represent Hyderabad or the Nizam. The Hyderabad delegation denied this, however on 24 September the delegation of Hyderabad confirmed the same and informed Security Council that Hyderabad State has surrendered and Government India had instructed Agents-General of Hyderabad to suspend all overseas activities. In December 1948, Moin Nawaz Jung later once again approached the Security Council claiming that Nizam had given instructions to withdraw the complaint &quot;under duress&quot;.

Out of the five men who represented Hyderabad at United Nations, Moin Nawaz Jung and Muhammed Hameedullah never returned to India. Yousuf Hussain Khan quit his job at Osmania University and moved to Aligarh Muslim University. Zaheer Ahmed joined Government of India and later got important postings in Foreign Services. However Pingle Venkatram Reddy was arrested on his return and interned in Chanchalguda Jail and later was put under house arrest.

==Capitulation and surrender==

===Consultations with Indian envoy===

On 16 September, faced with imminent defeat, Nizam &quot;Mir&quot; Sir Osman Ali Khan summoned his Prime Minister, &quot;Mir&quot; Laiq Ali, and requested his resignation by the morning of the following day. The resignation was delivered along with the resignations of the entire cabinet.
On the noon of 17 September, a messenger brought a personal note from the Nizam to India&#x27;s Agent General to Hyderabad, K. M. Munshi, summoning him to the Nizam&#x27;s office at 1600 hours. At the meeting, the Nizam stated &quot;The vultures have resigned. I don&#x27;t know what to do&quot;. Munshi advised the Nizam to secure the safety of the citizens of Hyderabad by issuing appropriate orders to the Commander of the Hyderabad State Army, Major-General El Edroos. This was immediately done.

===Broadcast by Nehru===

On 18 September, Jawaharlal Nehru in his broadcast said on the military action:

&quot;It is natural that we should rejoice at this swift termination of the action we undertook after prolonged and painful thought and each deliberation. As I have repeatedly said we are men of peace, hating war and the last thing we desire is to come into an armed conflict with anyone. Nevertheless, circumstances which you will know well, compelled us to take this action in Hyderabad. Fortunately, it was brief and we return with relief to the paths of peace again.&quot;

===Radio broadcast by the Nizam===

It was Nizam &quot;Mir&quot; Sir Osman Ali Khan&#x27;s first visit to the radio station. The Nizam of Hyderabad, in his radio speech on 23 September 1948, said &quot;In November last [1947], a small group which had organised a quasi-military organisation surrounded the homes of my Prime Minister, the Nawab of Chhatari, in whose wisdom I had complete confidence, and of Sir Walter Monkton, my constitutional Adviser, by duress compelled the Nawab and other trusted ministers to resign and forced the Laik Ali Ministry on me. This group headed by Kasim Razvi had no stake in the country or any record of service behind it. By methods reminiscent of Hitlerite Germany it took possession of the State, spread terror ... and rendered me completely helpless.&quot;

===The surrender ceremony===
According to the records maintained by the Indian Army, General Chaudhari led an armoured column into Hyderabad at around 4 p.m. on 18 September and the Hyderabad army, led by Major General El Edroos, surrendered.

== Communal violence during and after the operation ==

&lt;section begin=communalLater /&gt;
There were reports of looting, mass murder and rape of Muslims in reprisals by Hyderabadi Hindus. Jawaharlal Nehru appointed a mixed-faith committee led by Pandit Sunder Lal to investigate the situation. The findings of the report (Pandit Sunderlal Committee Report) were not made public until 2013 when it was accessed from the Nehru Memorial Museum and Library in New Delhi.

The Committee concluded that while Muslim villagers were disarmed by the Indian Army, Hindus were often left with their weapons. The violence was carried out by Hindu residents, with the army sometimes indifferent, and sometimes participating in the atrocities. The Committee stated that large-scale violence against Muslims occurred in Marathwada and Telangana areas. It also concluded: &quot;At several places, members of the armed forces brought out Muslim adult males from villages and towns and massacred them in cold blood.&quot; The Committee generally credited the military officers with good conduct but stated that soldiers acted out of bigotry. The official &quot;very conservative estimate&quot; was that 27,000 to 40,000 died &quot;during and after the police action.&quot; Other scholars have put the figure at 200,000, or even higher. Among Muslims some estimates were even higher and Smith says that the military government&#x27;s private low estimates [of Muslim casualties] were at least ten times the number of murders with which the Razakars were officially accused.

Patel reacted angrily to the report and disowned its conclusions. He stated that the terms of reference were flawed because they only covered the part during and after the operation. He also cast aspersions on the motives and standing of the committee. These objections are regarded by Noorani as disingenuous because the commission was an official one, and it was critical of the Razakars as well.

According to Mohammed Hyder, the tragic consequences of the Indian operation were largely preventable. He faulted the Indian army for neither restoring local administration nor setting up their military administration. As a result, the anarchy led to several thousand &quot;thugs&quot;, from the camps set up across the border, filling the vacuum. He stated &quot;Thousands of families were broken up, children separated from their parents and wives, from their husbands. Women and girls were hunted down and raped.&quot;

== Hyderabad after integration ==
=== Detentions and release of people involved ===
The Indian military detained thousands of people during the operation, including Razakars, Hindu militants, and communists. This was largely done based on local informants, who used this opportunity to settle scores. The estimated number of people detained was close to 18,000, which resulted in overcrowded jails and a paralysed criminal system.

The Indian government set up Special Tribunals to prosecute these. These strongly resembled the colonial governments earlier, and there were many legal irregularities, including denial or inability to access lawyers and delayed trials – about which the Red Cross was pressuring Nehru.

The viewpoint of the government was: &quot;In political physics, Razakar action and Hindu reaction have been almost equal and opposite.&quot; A quiet decision was taken to release all Hindus and for a review of all Muslim cases, aiming to let many of them out. Regarding atrocities by Muslims, Nehru considered the actions during the operation as &quot;madness&quot; seizing &quot;decent people&quot;, analogous to experience elsewhere during the partition of India. Nehru was also concerned that disenfranchised Muslims would join the communists.

The government was under pressure to not prosecute participants in communal violence, which often made communal relations worse. Patel had also died in 1950. Thus, by 1953 the Indian government released all but a few persons.

=== Overhaul of bureaucracy ===

Junior officers from neighbouring Bombay, CP and Madras regions were appointed to replace the vacancies. They were unable to speak the language and were unfamiliar with local conditions. Nehru objected to this &quot;communal chauvinism&quot; and called them &quot;incompetent outsiders&quot;, and tried to impose Hyderabadi residency requirements: however, this was circumvented by using forged documents.

<text>William Henry Letterman (August12, 1832May23, 1881) was the co-founder of the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity in 1852 at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania.

==Early life and education==
Letterman was born in Canonsburg. He graduated from Jefferson College (now Washington and Jefferson College) and then went on to receive his M.D. from Jefferson Medical College in 1856, where he was president of his graduating class.

==Family==
His father was the physician to the town of Canonsburg and died early in William&#x27;s life.

He is the younger brother of Jonathan K. Letterman who is known as the &quot;father of battlefield medicine&quot;. His system enabled thousands of wounded men to be recovered and treated during the American Civil War.

== Phi Kappa Psi ==
Letterman and his mother were living just a few houses away from Jefferson College. In the winter of 1850–1851, a typhoid fever epidemic broke out in the area and William and his friend, Charles Page Thomas Moore, spent long nights caring for a sick friend. Letterman and Moore grew to appreciate their service, and decided to form an organization that would ensconce these ideals. On the night of February 19, 1852, the brotherhood of Phi Kappa Psi was born.

== Freemason ==
On January 17, 1868, Letterman received his Freemasons (Masons) apprentice degree from Concordia Lodge #13 in Baltimore, Maryland. He also helped to organize the Masonic Lodge, in Duffau, Texas.

== Life and death ==

In the late fall of 1875, Letterman went to Prairie Home, Missouri, because of continued poor health and remained there for about three years. Then he decided the climate in Texas would be advantageous, so in the spring of 1878 he made a two-month tour to that state.

In November, 1878, with his wife and baby daughter, Laura, he left Missouri for Dallas, Texas, and then went to Stephenville, Texas by stage coach. He stopped at the Texas Hotel and the following day he hired a carriage and arrived at Duffau, Erath County, that afternoon.

At Duffau there were some mineral wells, and he had been told that the railroad would be built through Duffau, westward. However, the railroad was constructed through Hico and Stephenville. When he went to Texas, he carried letters of introduction signed by many prominent men of the East.

He helped organize a county medical association and also a district medical association in Stephenville, and he was elected the first president. He was a member of the Northwest Texas Medical and Surgical Society. He was examined and given a certificate to practice by M. S. Crow, M.D., chairman of the board of medical examiners, Erath County, Texas, and this was recorded on the twenty-seventh of November, 1878, at the office in Stephenville by W. H. Fooshea.

His health grew worse, and he was advised to make a trip to the Gulf. In a covered wagon, with his brother Ritchie as driver and with his wife and two children riding nearby in a buggy, he set out from Duffau on May 15, 1881. Because he grew worse daily, all were compelled to return within a week. Before he turned back, he stayed for a short while at the home of a friend in what is now downtown Austin. The historical site is presently part of 6th street&#x27;s bar district. While the upstairs loft where Letterman spent his last days has held many merchants during the last century, it is currently a bar named Peckerheads. A small shrine in Letterman&#x27;s honor exists there today. He died on May 23, 1881, and was buried in the cemetery at Duffau.

The Revered Mrs. Hugart conducted services at the church, and Mr. Franks conducted the Masonic service. Mrs. Letterman sold a riding pony, which her husband had given her, and had a monument placed at his grave. This monument still stands. Shortly after Letterman&#x27;s death, his widow and children returned to the home of Mrs. Letterman&#x27;s father, Professor Slaughter, in Missouri.

<doc id="906799" wikidata="Q4603241" url="?curid=906799" title="2004 Redfern riots">
<text>The 2004 Redfern riots took place on the evening of Sunday 15 February 2004, in the inner Sydney suburb of Redfern, New South Wales, and were sparked by the death of 17-year-old Thomas Hickey, also known as TJ Hickey, resulting from a bike accident in the neighbouring suburb of Waterloo on 14 February 2004.

==Thomas Hickey&#x27;s death==
The circumstances surrounding Thomas &quot;T.J.&quot; Hickey&#x27;s death are disputed. On the morning of Saturday 14 February 2004, the 17-year-old Aboriginal Australian boy was riding his bicycle downhill while a police vehicle was patrolling the nearby area. According to New South Wales Police, he collided with a protruding gutter and was flung into the air and impaled on a high fence outside a block of units off Phillip Street, Waterloo, causing penetrating injuries of the neck and chest. Police officers at the scene administered first aid until New South Wales Ambulance officers arrived. Hickey died with his family by his side early on 15 February 2004.

A large proportion of the inquest centred on whether police were &quot;pursuing&quot; Hickey, or &quot;following&quot; him. At the conclusion of the coronial inquest, NSW Police Commissioner Ken Moroney was interviewed on ABC Radio and gave this explanation of the distinction: &quot;I think if you were to ask the person on the street the definition between, and not a Concise Oxford Dictionary definition, but if you were to ask somebody their interpretation of being followed and being pursued I think they are two distinct and clear actions. Being followed, I think, in the ordinary layman&#x27;s mind, creates a particular picture. Being pursued by police creates a completely different picture and clearly there was no evidence that Mr Hickey was being pursued in the normal definition of that word&quot;.

Moroney supported the driver of the police truck, Senior Constable Michael Hollingsworth, in his refusal to give evidence. Both maintained this was a &quot;normal civilian right&quot;.

According to police, they arrived at the scene quickly with Constables Hollingsworth and Reynolds arriving a few minutes after the first police vehicle. Thomas was hanging by his shirt and was not seen to be impaled but in a serious condition. Police immediately rendered first aid and were unable to save him as &quot;the injury was probably non-survivable&quot;. At no time was Police Rescue or NSW Ambulance called off from attending. Evidence exists of Hollingsworth making numerous calls for the ETA of ambulance paramedics. When ambulance officers arrived, Hollingsworth and Reynolds Helped move Thomas into the Ambulance. A female cousin of Hickey made herself known to Hollingsworth and accompanied both Hollingsworth and Reynolds in the police truck when they left the scene, escorting the ambulance to the Children&#x27;s Hospital at Randwick
. Upon arrival at the hospital, Hollingsworth and Reynolds waited at the accident and emergency department. Some time later Hollingsworth and Reynolds, still at the hospital waiting for TJ&#x27;s family, were ordered away by a hospital social worker, possibly because Hollingsworth was covered in blood and might have upset the family and members of the public. There was an outstanding arrest warrant in Hickey&#x27;s name, but police have consistently maintained that the patrol car was searching for a different individual, wanted in connection with a violent bag snatch at Redfern railway station earlier the same day. There was no evidence of a pursuit with Hollingsworth and Reynolds being the second Police vehicle (caged truck) to attend the scene.

The Hickey family and supporters dispute this version of events, claiming that witnesses saw Hickey&#x27;s bike clipped by the police car, thus propelling him onto the fence. This claim was not supported by the testimony of two Aboriginal Liaison Officers to a NSW Parliamentary Inquiry into the death, though neither of the officers were present at the scene. (One of the officers was later convicted of murder and arson, an act for which he had blamed police.)

Despite calls to re-open the coronial inquest, the New South Wales government has refused to do so.

An appeal to the United Nations Human rights commission by lawyers acting for the Hickey Family to investigate the death and any racial motivation concluded the death to be an accident.

==Riots==
On the evening of 15 February, Aboriginal and non-Indigenous youths and adults, most of them from The Block, the Waterloo estate and other inner city housing precincts gathered at Eveleigh Street quickly after the word of the death spread. Persons were seen preparing petrol bombs and stockpiling bricks, resulting in police closing the Eveleigh Street entrance to the station, which turned the crowd violent and they began to throw bottles, bricks, live fireworks and Molotov cocktails. The violence escalated into a full-scale riot around the Block, during which Redfern railway station was briefly set alight, suffering superficial damage. The riot continued into the early morning, until police used fire brigade water hoses to disperse the crowd. Total damages included a torched car and 40 injured police officers.

==Post-riot==
A memorial service was held on 19 February 2004 in Redfern, and in Walgett, New South Wales (Hickey&#x27;s hometown), on 22 February 2004.

In 2005, the University of Technology Sydney&#x27;s students&#x27; association donated a plaque with TJ&#x27;s portrait, with an inscription that read: &quot;On the 14th February, 2004, TJ Hickey, aged 17, was impaled upon the metal fence above, arising from a police pursuit. The young man died as a result of his wounds the next day. In our hearts you will stay TJ.&quot; Local police, the NSW government and the Department of Housing have refused to allow the plaque to be placed on the wall below the fence where Hickey was impaled unless the words &quot;police pursuit&quot; were changed to &quot;tragic accident&quot;, which the family has refused to do.

In 2007, the New South Wales Police were fined $100,000 after the NSW Industrial Relations Commission found it had failed to ensure the health, safety and welfare at work of its employees under the Occupational Health and Safety Act.

==Legacy==
The 2013 film &quot;Around the Block&quot; focuses partly on the riots.

<doc id="906807" wikidata="Q5500893" url="?curid=906807" title="Freeform role-playing game">
<text>Freeform role-playing games, also called freeforms, are a type of role-playing game which employ informal or simplified rule sets, emphasise costume and theatricality, and typically involve large numbers (eight to two hundred and fifty) of players in a common setting. Actions are typically adjudicated on the spot by a referee, though variants exist whereby players jointly mediate their own actions.

==Theatre-style LARP==

The most common form of freeform game is the Theatre-style live action role-playing game (LARP). Such freeforms have sprung up around the world independently. 
Some sources suggest the genre originated in Australia where the first large-scale (100 player) freeform was played at the CanCon gaming convention in Canberra in January 1983, quickly spreading to Melbourne and later Sydney gaming conventions. Others suggest Iceland, or to games played at the University of York and popularised in the fanzine Aslan in the late nineteen eighties. 

Freeforms are particularly popular in Australia, where rules-based LARP games have only become common during the last decade. Some Australian conventions run specific tournaments for small-scale freeforms that challenge the players or the normal conventions of roleplaying in ways not possible with other types of games. Such freeforms may experiment with different narrative styles, contemporary social issues or unusual themes, and can be very realistic. Such games are often restricted to mature players.
&quot;Multiform&quot; or &quot;systemless&quot; styles of gaming are theatrical hybrids of traditional and freeform role-playing which may also incorporate elements of LARP. They typically emphasise theatrical expression and close emotional identification with the characters portrayed. In a multiform game, players sit at the table for social or strategic roleplaying and may even use standard tabletop rules, but will stand to act out more physical aspects of the game, often without use of formal rules sets. This style of gaming is frequently used at Australian conventions and many tabletop games employ it without being specifically labelled as multiforms, though it is not often used in home games.

==Freeform computer-assisted gaming==
&quot;Freeform&quot; can also refer to online text-based role-playing games which lack rules or contain only basic guidelines, relying instead on the player&#x27;s acting abilities and commitment to a good story. (In MUSH or IRC settings, these are often called consent-based, because what happens to a character is influenced by a potential &quot;veto&quot; from that character&#x27;s player.) These systems must either rely on carefully selected individuals or strict moderation, in order to prevent less mature players from taking advantage (god-moding) of the rule-free environment, for example by unrealistically shielding their characters from the consequences of their actions.

Similarly, &quot;freeform&quot; can refer to online forum-. and email-based role-playing games which lack rules or which lack statistics by which to judge a character&#x27;s abilities. As with freeform MUSHes and IRC games those running the game rely instead upon the players&#x27; writing talents and use of description to determine outcomes--&quot;if&quot; a GM is used to control the game at all. Some online freeform games closely resemble collaborative fiction, while others have much more structured rule sets, such as the Role Player&#x27;s Creed.

<doc id="906814" wikidata="Q571618" url="?curid=906814" title="Galápagos fur seal">
<text>The Galápagos fur seal (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) is one of eight seals in the genus &quot;Arctocephalus&quot;. It is the smallest of all eared seals. It is endemic to the Galápagos Islands in the eastern Pacific. The total estimated population as of 1970 was said to be about 30,000, although the population has been said to be on the decline since the 1980s due to environmental factors such as pollution, disease, invasive species, and their limited territory. Due to the population having been historically vulnerable to hunting, the Galápagos fur seal has been protected by the Ecuadorian government since 1934

== Description ==

Galápagos fur seals are the smallest otariids. They are born with a black natal coat that they molt to reveal a lighter brown coat before becoming adults. Of the otariids, Galápagos fur seals display the least amount of sexual dimorphism. The males are up to 2x heavier than the females and 1–1.3 times longer. Males grow to be 1.5 m (5 feet) on average and weigh about 64 kg (140 lb). Females grow to be 1.25 m on average and weigh 27 kg. (60 lb). They also have large eyes which allows them to hunt at night. The Galápagos fur seals look very similar to the Galápagos sea lions so it is important to note some of their differences. 
== Population ==
Over the course of the 19th century, Galápagos fur seals experienced an extreme decrease in their population size due to sealing. Fortunately, their population was able to recover in the 20th century. Around the late 1970&#x27;s, there was an estimate of around 30,000 of them, and even though they were able to partially recover from their protection in the Galapagos, they still experienced multiple shifts in their population due to other environmental factors in the late 1980&#x27;s that has resulted in a decline. Most fur seals have been found around the northern and western areas of the Archipelago. Even though there has not been a lot of evidence of immigration of this species, there were sightings in Ecuador during an El Niño event and southern Mexico.

== Range and habitat ==

The Galápagos fur seal is endemic to the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador, South America. It is present on nearly all the islands of the Galapagos. They are typically found close to the coastline where there are rock ledges and crevices that they can find shade in, in such a warm climate. It is classified as a non-migrant species. Females that are lactating do not travel long distances and tend to stay within the colony and only have moderately brief outings when they do venture out. However, recent research has documented the presence of Galápagos fur seals in Mexico and Guatemala.

== Reproduction ==

Galápagos fur seals live in large colonies on the rocky beaches of the Galápagos Islands. These colonies are then divided into territories by the male seals during breeding season, which is mid-August to mid-November, with a peak in late September and early October. Each successful reproductive female will choose a territory on the beach to pup on.
===Maternal care===

Galápagos fur seals have the lowest reproductive rate reported in seals, and it takes an unusually long time to raise seal pups to independence. Females bear only one pup at a time, and she remains with her newborn for a week before leaving to feed. She then periodically returns to the pup and stays to suckle it for a few days before leaving on another hunting trip. Females recognize their own pups by smell and sound, and pups also learn to identify their mothers by the females’ &quot;pup attraction calls&quot;. Mother-pup recognition is crucial because females exclusively nurse their own pups, often violently rejecting strange pups that approach. Orphaned seal pups usually try to sneak up on sleeping or calling females to suckle, but stealing milk is not enough to sustain the pups, and they usually die within a month.

===Interbrood conflict===

Fur seal pups rely on their mother&#x27;s milk for the first eighteen months, and weaning may be delayed for up to two or three years if conditions are poor. The result is that every year up to 23% of pups are born when an older sibling is still suckling. Survival of the younger sibling greatly depends on the availability of resources. In years when there is abundant food, the mortality rate of second pups is as low as 5%, which is equivalent to the mortality rate of pups without siblings. In years when food is scarce, 80% of pups with suckling older siblings die within a month. The younger sibling thus serves as an insurance in case the first sibling dies, and also provides extra reproductive value in case conditions prove better than expected. Such a bet-hedging strategy is particularly useful in Galapagos fur seals, since there is a great deal of maternal investment in raising a seal pup to independence in an environment that has great fluctuations in food.

The high level of resource uncertainty, late weaning, and potential overlap time of suckling young all lead to violent sibling rivalry and provide a good environment for studying parent-offspring conflict. From an offspring&#x27;s point of view, it would be most beneficial to continue suckling and receive more than its fair share of milk, but to the mother seal, it would pay to wean the older, more independent offspring in order to invest in the next pup. Thus, studies show that 75% of mothers intervened, often aggressively, when the older sibling harassed the newborn pups. Mothers would bite or lift the older offspring roughly by its skin, which sometimes caused open wounds. Maternal aggression towards the older sibling diminishes with time after the second sibling&#x27;s birth. Even without direct aggression, older siblings may still indirectly harm their younger siblings by outcompeting them for milk. The older offspring usually suckles first and allows their younger sibling access to the mother only after it is satiated, resulting in very little milk left over for the younger pup. Thus, the younger siblings often die from starvation.

During periods when there is very little prey, interbrood conflict increases. Galápagos fur seal population is drastically affected by El Niño, a period accompanied by high water temperatures and a deepening thermocline. Food becomes scarce during El Niño, and thus older seals exhibit an intense aversion to weaning, causing the mother seal to neglect the younger sibling.

Male competition 

Males will compete for the females when they become large enough by establishing territories on the beaches. The beaches are valuable pupping substrate for females. They have territories that average 200 m2. This is large compared to amount of territory occupied by most otariid males. 

== Feeding and predation ==

The Galápagos fur seal feeds primarily on fish, squid and shellfish. They feed relatively close to shore and near the surface, but have been seen at depths of . They primarily feed at night because their prey is much easier to catch then. During normal years, food is relatively plentiful. However, during an El Niño year, there can be fierce competition for food, and many young pups die during these years. The adult seals feed themselves before their young and during particularly rough El Niño years, most of the young seal populations will die.

The Galápagos fur seal has virtually no constant predators. Occasionally, sharks and orcas have been seen feeding on the seals, but this is very rare. Sharks and orcas are the main predator of most other seal species, but their migration paths do not usually pass the Galápagos.

== Conservation ==

=== Anthropogenic Threats ===
The Galápagos Islands are heavily trafficked by tourists. However, tourism is well regulated and restricted by the Ecuadorian government. Collisions with boats which frequent the waters near the islands could also be fatal to the Galapagos fur seals. Historically, the Galápagos fur seal has also been threatened by hunting and invasive species. Whalers and sealers used to hunt the seals for their fur. The threat of hunting has been removed since the declaration of the Galápagos islands as a national park and the protection of the species under law.

=== Environmental Threats ===
The fur seals’ habitat is naturally restricted which makes them more threatened by environmental changes. Other potential and existing threats are tourism, oil spills, and boat collisions. Oil spills would be particularly damaging to the fur seal as their thick pelage is an important part of their thermoregulation. The waters near the archipelago are trafficked by vessels of ranging sizes that could contain and release moderate amounts of oil.

Isabela Island was documented as having a population of dogs that were known to kill the Galápagos fur seals. Since then all of the feral dog population on Isabela Island has been exterminated and the seals no longer face this threat. Now, the biggest direct threats to Galápagos fur seals involve climate change which includes ocean warming as well as ESNO weather events. Some of the indirect threats for them are marine pollution, pathogen spillovers, and bycatch. There is not a lot known about the relation between pathogens and pinnipeds, but there were diseases found carried by dogs and cats on Isabela Island.

=== Biological and Chemical Pollution ===
Animals such as rats, domestic dogs, and feral cats are considered to be a threat to the Galápagos fur seals because they can be both hosts and carriers of infectious diseases. These diseases would then be spread to marine mammals. Although the fur seals are not exactly in close proximity to many domestic animals, feral cats are typically found around the islands. Many tests were done on such dogs and cats, and these proved that they are exposed to many pathogens. This could result in the fur seals being at risk of getting infected by cats and dogs. Both Galápagos fur seals and sea lions were tested to see if they had strains that were susceptible to the bacterium found in the cats and dogs. From the results of a PCR analysis, it was found that 70% of the tissue samples had the presence of multiple strains. In the past few years, the presence of these strains could have resulted in lower mortality rates for the sea lions. If sea lions are infected by this in the future, this could affect fur seals as well since sea lions have specific regional movements which will most likely have a huge contribution to the spreading of these pathogens, as they may infect multiple fur seal colonies. The Galápagos fur seal&#x27;s health was also exposed to danger by chemical pollution, such as chemical attacks by hydrocarbons, metals, oil spills, and other organics pollutants referred to as POPs (Persistent Organic Pollutants). The two most popular POPs that threatened the fur seals are toxic and bioaccumulative. This was uncovered through the discovery of different pesticides in the fur seals, raising many concerns for their health.

=== Status ===
Galápagos fur seals have had a declining population since the 19th century. Thousands of these seals were killed for their fur in the 1800s by poachers. Starting in 1959, Ecuador established strict laws to protect these animals. The government of Ecuador declared the Galápagos Islands a national park, and since then no major poaching has occurred. Despite the laws, another tragic blow to their population occurred during the 1982–1983 El Niño weather event. Almost all of the seal pups died, and about 30% of the adult population was wiped out. Since 1983, no major calamity has occurred to decrease their population significantly.

=== Efforts ===
Under the IUCN red list, Galápagos fur seals are classified as an endangered species due to the fluctuation in their population and the decline in their population size over the past 30 years. The seals are now protected by Ecuadorian law as is most of their habitat. They are also protected under the Special Law of the National Park and Galápagos Marine Reserve. This National Park was established in 1959 along with the Ecuadorian Law. This meant there was more management and protection of the area as well as its surrounding waters where there is a no-fishing zone for many miles. Since they are located in a national park, sometimes the tourism is heavy but it is well regulated and so the seals are protected. The National Park Service has also been able to regulate the feral dogs that have attacked and killed many Galápagos fur seals in the past. In 1991 Ecuador started a plan for the conservation of marine mammals, including Galápagos fur seals, in the southeast Pacific. As of now, people are trying to study the risk of marine plastic pollution to the wildlife in this area including the fur seals under what is known as the Plastic Pollution Free Galapagos program. It is also important to note that the Galápagos Islands was one of the first places to be identified as a Natural World Heritage Site which helps preserve the island even more. Galápagos fur seals continue to face threats to their population due to their limited distribution across the islands of the Archipelago.

<text>Edwin Baruch Winans (May 16, 1826 – July 4, 1894) was a U.S. Representative from and the 22nd governor of Michigan.

==Early life in New York and Michigan==
Winans was born in Avon, New York, and moved with his parents, John and Eliza (née Way), to Michigan in 1834. The family first moved to Scio Township in Washtenaw County and in spring 1836 moved to Unadilla Township in Livingston County. His father died in the fall of 1843, and Winans moved with his mother to Hamburg Township, also in Livingston County. His mother died in July, 1852 and Winans worked for four years in a wool carding mill. At the age of twenty, he attended Albion College, Albion, Michigan, for two and a half years in preparation for entering the Law School of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.

==California Gold Rush==
Before completing his studies, Winans was drawn by news of the California Gold Rush, and in March 1850 left for California by an overland route to seek his fortune. Arriving July 20, he engaged in mining first on the north branch of the American River near Placerville. He continued the same work with some varied success in different parts of the state. In 1853, he was one of the members of the celebrated Randolph Hill Mining Company in the town of Rough and Ready (now a town west of Grass Valley in Nevada County). In 1855, he returned to Michigan to marry Elizabeth Galloway and then returned to California, where he continued with the company until its dissolution in 1857. He was a principal stockholder in the Rough and Ready Ditch Company and also engaged in banking in Rough and Ready.

==Politics in Michigan==

He returned to Michigan in 1858 and purchased a 400-acre (1.6 km2) farm in Hamburg Township, Michigan, where he and his wife had two sons, Edwin, Jr. and George. He was twice elected a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives 1861–1865 and was a delegate to the state constitutional convention of May 15, 1867. He was a Hamburg Township supervisor, 1872–1873 and probate judge of Livingston County 1877–1881.

Winans was elected as a Fusion candidate and seated with the Democrats in the United States House of Representatives for the Forty-eighth and Forty-ninth Congresses, serving from March 4, 1883, to March 3, 1887. He resumed agricultural pursuits in Livingston County and served as Governor of Michigan 1891–1893. He was the first Democrat elected governor after the American Civil War (Josiah Begole had been elected in 1882 on a Fusionist ticket combining the Greenback and Democratic Parties). During his tenure, several election reform bills were sanctioned, the most significant of which was the secret Australian ballot. His son, George, acted as his private secretary.

==Death and legacy==
Winans died in Hamburg, Michigan at age 68, and is interred in Hamburg Cemetery.

Winans&#x27;s son, also named Edwin Baruch Winans, was a major general in the United States Army and commanding general of the Third Army from September 15, 1932, to September 30, 1933. He also served as superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York in 1927.

<text>William Powell Lear (June 26, 1902 – May 14, 1978) was an American inventor and businessman. He is best known for founding Learjet, a manufacturer of business jets. He also invented the battery eliminator for the B battery, and developed the car radio and the 8-track cartridge, an audio tape system. Throughout his career of 46 years, Lear received over 140 patents.

==Career==
Lear was born on June 26, 1902, in Hannibal, Missouri, to Rueben Marion Lear, a carpenter, and Gertrude Elizabeth Powell Lear. His mother left his father and he stayed with his aunt, Gussie Bornhouser, in Dubuque, Iowa. Later, Otto Kirmse took him in and raised him as his stepson. The family relocated to Chicago where Lear attended Kershaw Grammar School. On Sundays, he attended the Moody Tabernacle (now Moody Church). &quot;From listening to Paul Rader, of the Moody Tabernacle, he learned grammar and how to speak. He found out how to meet people, how to shake hands, and what to say when he did so... He learned about hypocrisy, too&quot;, and ceased any further church affiliation.

While in Chicago, Lear was employed briefly at a local airfield. He spent one summer with his father in Tulsa, re-building a Model-T car. Too independent to move back with his mother in Chicago, Lear struck out cross country. He joined the U.S. Navy and was sent to Great Lakes Naval Training Station. After discharge, and with a young family, &quot;he decided to complete his high school education. Starting a radio repair shop in his home, which he could tend nights, Lear enrolled at Tulsa Central High School, taking eight solids, heavy on the math. He was at the point of wrapping up the entire four-year curriculum in one, when he was again dismissed for showing up teachers.&quot;

===Radio engineer===
Lear was self-taught: &quot;He had read widely on wireless, including the works of Nikola Tesla, the scientist/inventor. He had even built a radio set, based on a twenty-five-cent Galena crystal which he sent away for, and he had learned the Morse code, the fun ending with the ban on radio during World War I.&quot;

One of his first ventures was with Lawrence Sorensen, selling &quot;Loose Coupler&quot; radios. Lear had been an &quot;instructor in wireless&quot; in the U.S. Navy so he confidently identified himself as a radio engineer to Clifford Reid in Quincy, Illinois. Reid was selling auto supplies and hired Lear to expand into radio. With contractor Julius Bergen, he founded Quincy Radio Labs and built speaker boxes for radios. Lear also helped develop WLAL which evolved into the powerful station KVOO.

In 1924, he moved to Chicago and built a B-battery eliminator for the Universal Battery Company with R. D. Morey. He met Waldorf Astoria Smith of the Carter Radio Company who helped him with radio theory including Ohm&#x27;s law. Tom Fletcher of the QRS Company was so impressed by Lear&#x27;s radio set designed around a QRS rectifier tube that he hired him, offering 60% more pay than Universal Battery. Bill Grunow of the Grigsby-Grunow-Hinds Company topped that offer when Lear fixed a problem with 60,000 B-battery eliminators that they had manufactured. He came up with an invention in 1924 when power inverters installed at Stevens Hotel failed to perform for the Radio Manufacturers&#x27; Association. Lear also built audio amplifiers and cases for Magnavox speakers. The Magnavox &quot;majestic dynamic speakers&quot; that he produced with Grunow were very popular. 

Lear pioneered an early step toward miniaturization in electronics. Tuning coils in the radio frequency stage of a set were rather large; Lear reduced their size by using Litz wire, braided from many fine strands to create a large surface area, giving it high conductivity at radio frequency. Lear borrowed $5,000 from his friend Algot Olson to build machines to wrap the strands, braid the wire, and wind the coils. The industry was set up in the basement of his mother&#x27;s old house on 65th street, and run with assistance of Don Mitchell, a railroad electrician. Lear called the company Radio Coil and Wire Corporation. Eugene F. McDonald of Zenith Electronics ordered 50,000 coils, which were one-quarter the size of coils made with solid wire.

Lear traded his Radio Coil business for one-third interest in Paul Galvin&#x27;s Galvin Manufacturing Company. At that time the radio had not yet been developed for use in automobiles. Lear worked with his friend Elmer Wavering to build the first car radio. Lear partnered with Howard Gates of Zenith; Lear designed the circuit and layout, Gates did the metal work, and Lear completed the assembly. Galvin initially dismissed the prototype, but later ordered a 200-unit production run. Galvin and Lear mulled over names for the product on a cross-country trip and came up with &quot;Motorola&quot;, which was a portmanteau of &quot;motor&quot; and the then popular suffix &quot;-ola&quot; used with audio equipment of the time (for example &quot;Victrola&quot;). The product was such a success that Galvin changed the name of his entire company to Motorola.

===Aviation===
In 1931, Lear bought his first aircraft, a Fleet biplane for $2,500 from a woman in Dearborn, Michigan (). The challenges of aerial navigation led Lear into the development of radio direction finders and avionics products.

Lear founded Lear Developments, a company specializing in aerospace instruments and electronics. Lear developed radio direction finders, autopilots, and the first fully automatic aircraft landing system. He was awarded the Collier Trophy for this contribution in 1949.

Lear also developed and marketed a line of panel-mounted radios for general aviation. His &quot;LearAvian&quot; series of portable radios, which incorporated radio direction finder circuits as well as broadcast band coverage, were especially popular. The company earned about $100 million during WW II for its products. 

Lear changed the name of Lear Developments to Lear Avia, Inc. in 1939. The company rebranded again in 1944 to Lear, Incorporated and in 1949 opened a manufacturing facility in Santa Monica, California.

In 1960, Lear moved to Switzerland and founded the Swiss American Aviation Company (SAAC). The company&#x27;s goal was to redesign the FFA P-16 jet fighter—a project that had been abandoned after two crashes during test flights—into a small business jet, the SAAC 23.

During the brief existence of SAAC, King Michael I of Romania met Lear and agreed to work as a test pilot for the Swiss part of the company. This was during the king&#x27;s forced exile, which lasted for 50 years until 1997.
In 1962, Lear sold his interest in Lear, Incorporated to the Siegler Corporation after failing to persuade Lear Incorporated&#x27;s board to go into the aircraft manufacturing business. The resulting company was thereafter known as Lear Siegler.

Lear next moved to Wichita, Kansas, to manufacture the converted SAAC 23 design. In October 1963, Lear Jet started test flights on the Learjet 23, the first mass-produced business jet. The first Lear Jet was sold in 1963; it could carry eight passengers at 560 mph and cost about $650,000 fully equipped (), about $400,000 less than its competitors at the time. Although the Lear Jet was quite successful and remains in production, Bill Lear was eventually forced to sell Lear Jet Corporation to the Gates Rubber Company in 1967 due to other financial losses.

In the early 1970s, Lear backed the Foxjet ST600 with its first order. The Very Light Jet project failed, but the VLJ concept became popular again 30 years later.

In 1976, Lear sold an option to his LearStar concept to Canadair, a Montreal aircraft manufacturer. The idea was to design an executive aircraft which would bring together a supercritical wing with Lycoming&#x27;s new turbofan engine. However, the concept was only a very rough outline, prepared by a consultant. Although Canadair took up its option, Lear eventually realized that the Canadians had simply been interested in using his reputation and skills at promotion to penetrate the market. Canadair&#x27;s design had little relation to Lear&#x27;s concept, and Lear had no role in its development. Nevertheless, the Canadair Challenger business jet was to have a long career, with several variants. Bombardier Aerospace, by that time the parent company of Canadair, acquired Lear Jet in 1990.

One of Lear&#x27;s most innovative projects was his last — a revolutionary aircraft called the LearAvia Lear Fan 2100, a seven-passenger aircraft whose single pusher propeller was powered by two turbine engines. The fuselage of this aircraft was made of lightweight composite materials, instead of the more typical aluminum alloys. The Lear Fan was ultimately never completed; at the time of his death Lear asked his wife, Moya, to finish it. With the help of investors she attempted to do so, but the aircraft failed to obtain FAA certification and so was never put into production.

==Other notable inventions==
Lear developed the 8-track tape music cartridge in 1964. Lear&#x27;s invention was an improvement on the four track Muntz Stereo-Pak tape cartridge, marketed by Earl &quot;Madman&quot; Muntz in California in 1962, itself a version of a 3-track system, Fidelipac. The 8-track was a commercial success that provided good audio quality and was easily adapted to vehicle and home use. The Lear Jet Stereo 8 Division offered home, auto, and portable versions. A popular theory is that Learjets also included 8-track players. In 1965, a partnership between Ford, RCA, and Lear offered the first pre-recorded 8-track music cartridges. RCA released the first Stereo 8 Tape Cartridges in September 1965, issuing 175 titles.

In 1968, Lear started work on a closed circuit steam turbine to power cars and buses. He built a transit bus, and converted a Chevrolet Monte Carlo sedan to use this turbine system. It used a proprietary working fluid dubbed Learium, possibly a chlorofluorocarbon similar to DuPont Freon. A prototype racing car was built to enter the 1969 Indianapolis 500, the Lear Vapordyne. The car never entered the race and never ran at competitive speeds.

<text>Baron Playfair, of St Andrews in the County of Fife, was a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 3 September 1892 for the scientist and Liberal politician Sir Lyon Playfair. He was succeeded by his only son, the second Baron. The second Baron was a Brigadier-General in the British Army. The second Baron&#x27;s only son, the Hon. Lyon George Henry Lyon Playfair (1888-1915), was a Captain in the Royal Field Artillery and was killed in action in the First World War, unmarried. Consequently, the title became extinct on the death of the second Baron in 1939.

<text>Stratus Technologies, Inc. is a major producer of fault tolerant computer servers and software. The company was founded in 1980 as Stratus Computer, Inc. in Natick, Massachusetts, and adopted its present name in 1999. The current CEO and president is Dave Laurello. The founder of Stratus was Bill Foster, who was CEO until Stratus was acquired by Ascend Communications in 1999. Prior to 2022, Stratus Technologies, Inc. was a privately held company, owned solely by Siris Capital Group. The parent company, Stratus Technologies Bermuda Holdings, Ltd., was incorporated in Bermuda. In 2022, the company was acquired by Smart Global Holdings (SGH) and currently operates within SGH&#x27;s Intelligent Platform Solutions (IPS) business.
Stratus Computer was a Marlborough, Massachusetts, based producer of fault-tolerant minicomputers. It competed with computers from Tandem Computers and to a lesser extent Digital Equipment Corporation&#x27;s VAX.

Starting in 1983, its computers were resold worldwide by Stratus&#x27; own sales force as well as partners such as Olivetti under the CPS/32 (&quot;Continuous Processing System&quot;) brand. Then, from 1985 to 1993, its computers were resold by IBM under the IBM System/88 brand. The company is now based in Maynard, Massachusetts.

==History==
Stratus shipped its first computer in February 1982, 21 months after its founding. The customer was the West Lynn Creamery, located in nearby Lynn, Massachusetts.

The company was founded in 1980 by Bill Foster, Bob Freiburghouse, and Gardner Hendrie. In 1974 Bill briefly worked with the founders of the first fault tolerant company, Tandem Computers. That experience motivated him to start Stratus, and use new 32-bit microprocessor technology to compete against them. Bill knew Freiburghouse and Hendrie from his work experience at Data General. They raised $1.7 million venture capital dollars in May 1980. 23 engineers, mostly from the MIT Multics project and Data General, produced their initial product in just 21 months, and delivered it to a local company, the West Lynn Creamery. The owners of West Lynn insisted that they be allowed to purchase stock in Stratus, indicating their confidence in the company. Stratus went public in 1983.

The company&#x27;s traditional markets have been financial services companies such as banks and credit card companies. Beginning in the 1990s, the company moved into the telecommunications industry, particularly in the area of network management and custom services. In time, its telecommunications revenues surpassed those from enterprise computing. This led to a buyout of the company by Ascend Communications in 1998 (later acquired by Lucent Technologies).

The enterprise server portion of the business was of little interest to Ascend and that portion was spun off in a management buyout in 1999, with funding from international investment firm, Investcorp. The company was named Stratus Technologies, Inc.

In the second quarter of 2002, Lucent sold the telecom product lines that originally came from Stratus to Platinum Equity, a buyout firm based in Los Angeles. That unit was eventually named Cemprus LLC. Stratus purchased Cemprus in 2003. It is now a wholly owned subsidiary of Stratus. This acquisition gave Stratus the SS7 signaling software for phone networks and intelligent gateway software so that traditional and IP voice equipment are able to communicate. This software can be used to support higher-level telephony applications such as calling-card and toll-free phone number services.

In 2006, Stratus purchased Emergent Network Solutions of Allen, Texas. Stratus sold off Emergent in 2009, and Emergent is now known as Stratus Telecommunications. The two companies are now separate entities. One is not the parent of the other. On July 16, 2010, as a reverse merger between YMax and VocalTec - all of the Stratus Telecommunications technologies are owned by VocalTec.

In 2012, Stratus acquired the assets, products, services, and intellectual property of Marathon Technologies along with its customer base and channel-partner network.

Now privately held, Stratus Technologies, Inc. was acquired by Siris Capital Group on April 28, 2014. On 29 June 2022 Smart Global Holdings announced the acquisition of Stratus from Sirus for US$225 million.

==Products and customers==
Its legacy product line was originally based on Motorola MC68000 processors (FT and XA series), and then migrated to Intel i860 processors (XA/R series), then to Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s PA-RISC processors (Continuum series), and finally to Intel Xeon processors (V Series). That line runs the VOS operating system, which originally had many features inspired by or derived from Multics. Other operating systems supported on the legacy platforms (XA/R, Jetta / Continuum)—HP-UX and a home-grown UNIX product called FTX (Fault-Tolerant UNIX)—are supported but no longer actively sold.

In June 2002, Stratus introduced the ftServer line of Intel-based servers, running Microsoft Windows 2000 and higher. The Stratus ftServer line sold today supports Windows Server, VMware vSphere, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. The company sells models of ftServer designated as entry-level, mid-range and enterprise-class fault tolerant servers.

The company began offering Stratus Avance software in June 2008, a high availability product with virtualization built in. Avance runs on two general-purpose x86 servers and allows deployment of applications across high-availability virtual machines, freeing up existing x86 servers. The two servers comprising the Avance high-availability platform may be separated by up to three miles for purposes of disaster recovery and business continuity. Avance is intended to serve small-to-medium size businesses&#x27; need for affordable and simple high availability and virtualization.

Stratus has a large presence in Maynard, Massachusetts, its U.S. headquarters, and in Phoenix, Arizona, as well as several worldwide offices, in locations such as the UK, the Netherlands, South Africa, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, China, Japan and India.

The company has a vast customer base, but popular types of its customers include banks and credit unions, emergency response centers (such as 911 in the USA), police departments, fire departments, hospitals, clinics, governments, credit card companies, stock exchanges, telcos/phone companies and Internet providers.

<text>Felipe Poey (May 26, 1799 – January 28, 1891) was a Cuban zoologist.

==Biography==
Poey was born in Havana, the son of French and Spanish parents. He spent several years (1804 to 1807) of his life in Pau then studied law in Madrid. He became a lawyer in Spain but was forced to leave due to his liberal ideas, returning to Cuba in 1823. He began to concentrate on the study of the natural science and traveled to France in 1825 with his wife. He began writing on the butterflies of Cuba and acquiring knowledge on fish, later supplying Georges Cuvier and Valenciennes with fish specimens from Cuba. He took part in the foundation, in 1832, of the Société Entomologique de France.

Poey returned to Cuba in 1833 where he founded the Museum of Natural History in 1839. In 1842, he became the first professor of zoology and comparative anatomy at the University of Havana. He also took part in the creation of the Academy of Science (natural, physical and medical) of Havana and was a president of the Anthropological Society.

<doc id="906835" wikidata="Q538440" url="?curid=906835" title="Calayan rail">
<text>The Calayan rail (Aptenorallus calayanensis) is a flightless bird of the rail, moorhen, and coot family (Rallidae) that inhabits Calayan Island in the Philippines. It is the only member of the genus Aptenorallus. Though well known to natives of the island as the &quot;piding&quot;, it was first observed by ornithologist Carmela Española in May 2004 and the discovery was officially announced on August 16, 2004. 

== Description ==
The Calayan rail is a relatively large flightless rail. Its plumage is dark grayish overall, with a blacker face and slightly browner upperparts. The bill and legs are bright orange-red, unique among similar-sized dark-colored ground-dwelling birds on Calayan. Its vocalizations are loud, harsh, and nasal-sounding.

== Taxonomy ==
It was initially discovered by Carmela Espanola during fieldworlk in the area. The formal description as a species new to science appeared in the journal &quot;Forktail&quot; (Allen &quot;et al.&quot; 2004).

Prior to 2022, it was classified in the genus &quot;Gallirallus&quot;. Following studies in 2012 and 2013, all recent species in the genus &quot;Gallirallus&quot; aside from the Calayan rail and the weka of New Zealand were moved to the genus &quot;Hypotaenidia&quot;. Following this, the Calayan rail and the weka were considered the two extant species of the genus &quot;Gallirallus&quot;. However, a 2021 phylogenetic study found the Calayan rail to be basal to the species classified in &quot;Habroptila&quot;, &quot;Eulabeornis&quot;, &quot;Gallirallus&quot;, and &quot;Hypotaenidia&quot;, and thus classified it into its own genus, &quot;Aptenorallus&quot;. This was accepted by the International Ornithological Congress in 2022.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
Stomach contents of a specimen contained various insects including snails, beetles and millipedes. This bird forages by pecking and turning over dead leaves. This species has weak wings and can barely fly. It is often observed alone or in small groups.

Nest found in June and contained 4 eggs. Lays on the ground at the base of a tree loosely made of dried leaves and stems. Eggs are pale pink and are blotched reddish brown and dark purple.

== Habitat and conservation status ==
It is found on the primary and secondary forest on coralline limestone areas on Calayan.

IUCN has assessed this bird as vulnerable with an estimated population of just 2,500 to 4,300 mature individuals. It was initially estimated by biologists in 2004 that there were just 200 pairs on the island. It has since been found to be locally common, with an estimated area of occupancy of 36 km2. However recent species distribution modelling estimated its area of occupancy at 90.2 km2 . 

The species&#x27; main threat is habitat loss with the clearance of forest habitats as a result of logging and agricultural conversion within its range. It is also occasionally caught in snares meant for red junglefowl. It is also threatened by introduced species such as cats, dogs and rats which could prey on these birds and their nests. 

The Calayan municipal council has passed Municipal Ordinance No. 84, which prohibits the capture, sale, possession and collection of the species. There are currently many awareness campaigns using this rail as a flagship species. The municipality of Calayan has passed an ordinance establishing the Calayan Wildlife Sanctuary which covers 29km2 of the island interior.

Conservation actions proposed include more research is needed to clarify the habitat requirements, range size and population size of the species. Promote the establishment of an environmental monitoring system. Conduct further community consultations and education campaigns. Set up a volunteer network for conservation activities. Develop capacity of local officials and community leaders in managing the recently established wildlife sanctuary and in enforcing its rules and regulations.

Brasserie Bofferding was founded in 1842 in Bascharage (where the Brewery of Brasserie Nationale is still located today) by Jean-Baptiste Bofferding. The brewery continuously expanded in southern Luxembourg until finally merging with Brasserie Funck-Bricher in 1975.

===Brasserie Funck-Bricher===

Brasserie Funck-Bricher was founded in 1764 (hence the marked date on today&#x27;s Bofferding bottles) and brewed in the Grund district in Luxembourg City. The brewery of Brasserie Funck-Bricher was located next to the Grund bridge over the river Alzette. In 1916 Brasserie Funck-Bricher was named &quot;fournisseur de la cour&quot;.
In 1964 Brasserie Funck-Bricher successfully bought Brasserie de Dudelange.

===Creating Brasserie Nationale===
In 1975 Brasserie Bofferding and Brasserie Funck-Bricher merged. After the fusion of the two breweries was completed, the newly founded Brasserie Nationale closed the old brewery at Grund in Luxembourg-City and relocated its production completely to the Bofferding brewery in Bascharage. They also decided that all beer brewed from then on would be sold under the name Bofferding, thus the Funck-Bricher beer brand ceased to exist.
In 2004 &quot;Brasserie Nationale&quot; bought &quot;Brasserie Battin&quot; from Esch-Alzette (which was founded in 1937) and transferred the production of Battin-beer also to its brewery in Bascharage where it is still brewed today.

==Economy==

As of 2013 Brasserie Nationale with its beers &quot;Bofferding&quot; and &quot;Battin&quot; emerged as clear market leader in Luxembourg, with a share of 56 percent (&quot;Bofferding&quot; 44 percent and &quot;Battin&quot; 12 percent) in the sale of local brews – the equivalent of more than 32 million pints.
Around 20 percent of all beer brewed by Brasserie Nationale is exported to foreign countries: to France, Belgium, China (since 2007) and the United States (since 2014).

==Brands==
The Brasserie Nationale is currently selling beer under two brand names: &quot;Bofferding&quot; and &quot;Battin&quot;.

===Bofferding===
The following brands are sold under the Bofferding name:
* &quot;Bofferding Pils&quot;
* &quot;Bofferding Hausbéier&quot; (lager)
* &quot;Bofferding Christmas&quot; (darker beer, served only during winter)

<text>The Joint Entrance Examination – Advanced (JEE-Advanced) (formerly the Indian Institute of Technology – Joint Entrance Examination (IIT-JEE)) is an academic examination held annually in India that tests the skills and knowledge of the applicants in physics, chemistry and mathematics. It is organised by one of the seven zonal Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs): IIT Roorkee, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras, and IIT Guwahati, under the guidance of the Joint Admission Board (JAB) on a round-robin rotation pattern for the qualifying candidates of the Joint Entrance Examination – Main(exempted for foreign nationals and candidates who have secured OCI/PIO cards on or after 04-03-2021). It used to be the sole prerequisite for admission to the IITs&#x27; bachelor&#x27;s programs before the introduction of UCEED, Online B.S. and Olympiad entries, but seats through these new media are very low.

Other universities, such as the Indian Maritime University Kolkata, the Indian Institute of Petroleum and Energy, the Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Petroleum Technology and the Indian Institute of Space Technology, use the score obtained in the JEE-Advanced exam as the sole basis for admission. The Indian Institute of Science also uses the score obtained in the JEE-Advanced exam as one of the basis for admission. The JEE-Advanced score is also used as a possible basis for admission by Indian applicants to non-Indian universities such as the University of Cambridge and the National University of Singapore.

The JEE-Advanced has been consistently ranked as one of the toughest exams in the world. High school students from across India typically prepare for several years to take this exam, and most of them attending coaching institutes. The combination of its high difficulty level, intense competition, unpredictable paper pattern and low acceptance rate exerts immense pressure on aspirants, making success in this exam a highly sought-after achievement. In a 2018 interview, former IIT Delhi director V. Ramgopal Rao, said the exam is &quot;tricky and difficult&quot; because it is framed to &quot;reject candidates, not to select them&quot;. In 2024, out of the 180,200 candidates who took the exam, 48,248 candidates qualified.

==History==
The first institute among IITs, Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur, started in 1951. In its initial years before 1961, students were admitted based on their academic results, followed by an interview in several locations across the country. From 1955 to 1960, admissions for the Indian Institute of Technology Kharagpur were conducted via a national examination. Academic disciplines were allotted to the students via interviews and counselling sessions held at Kharagpur.

The IIT-JEE was first conducted in 1961 as Common Entrance Exam (CEE), coinciding with the 1961 IIT Act.

In 1978, the English paper was not considered when ranking participants&#x27; performance in the examination. In 1998, the English test was discontinued.

In 1997, the IIT-JEE was conducted twice after the question paper was leaked in some locations.

Between 2000 and 2005, an additional screening test was used alongside the main examination, intended to reduce pressure on the main examination by allowing only about 20,000 top candidates to appear for the examination, out of more than 450,000 applicants.

In 2002, an additional exam called the AIEEE was introduced, and it was used for admissions to many institutions of national importance other than the IITs.

In June 2005, The Hindu newspaper led a campaign for reforming the IIT-JEE to eradicate the &quot;coaching mania&quot; and to improve gender and socio-economic diversity. Two possible solutions were proposed - either a convergence between the screening test and the All India Engineering Entrance Examination (AIEEE), or a two-tier examination. Whereas ranks from the first tier can be used to gain admission to the NITs and other engineering colleges in the country.

In September 2005, the group of directors of all the IITs announced significant revisions to the examination. These were implemented from 2006 onward. The revised examination consisted of a single objective test, replacing and abolishing the earlier two-test system with screener. In the revised examination, to be eligible for taking it, candidates in the general category had to obtain at least 60% aggregate marks in the 12th-grade examinations organized by various educational boards of India, while candidates belonging to Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Persons With Disabilities (PwD) categories needed a minimum score of 55%.

In 2008, the director and the dean of IIT Madras proposed further revisions to the examination, arguing that the coaching institutes were &quot;enabling many among the less-than-best students to crack the test and keeping girls from qualifying&quot;. They expressed concern that the present system did not allow for applicants&#x27; 12 years of schooling to have a bearing on admissions into IIT.

In 2008, the Indian Institutes of Technology began offering their admission tests in Dubai. Annually, the number of candidates for the examination in Dubai varies between 200 and 220.

In 2013, the AIEEE was renamed JEE-Main, and IIT-JEE was renamed JEE-Advanced; the JEE-Main had become the screening exam for JEE-Advanced.

The two-tier reform suggested in 2005 may become a reality as the Indian government has announced plans for a single entrance exam for all engineering colleges from 2018, with students aspiring for the IITs having to pass the nationwide standardized engineering entrance exam JEE-Main with high marks, and then take the JEE-Advanced to qualify for the IITs. In 2018, the JEE-Advanced exam started being conducted online.

== Qualifying percentage (As of JEE Advanced 2024) ==
Minimum percentage of aggregate/subject marks may be lowered subsequently considering the toughness of the paper and the need of students.

== Number of applicants by year ==

== Organizing institute ==
The JEE – Advanced exam is conducted by the seven zonal Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs): IIT Roorkee, IIT Kharagpur, IIT Delhi, IIT Kanpur, IIT Bombay, IIT Madras and IIT Guwahati on a rotating basis. This list shows the organizers of the exam in recent years.

==Paper pattern==
JEE (Advanced) is conducted in two papers of three hours each – Paper-1 and Paper-2 (both compulsory) consist of questions from three major subjects: physics, chemistry and mathematics. Unlike most of the other exams, the type, the number of questions being asked in the paper, the total marks and the marking scheme varies from year to year depending upon the organizing institute, with an average of about 36–38 questions asked from each subject across both the papers. For example, the 2021 JEE-Advanced paper had 38 questions (19 questions in Paper-1 and the next 19 in Paper-2) from each of the three subjects.

Each paper in every subject is divided into 4 sections (the marking scheme may vary from year to year): 

Some previous year papers also included matrix match type questions instead of single-correct multiple choice questions.

==Syllabus==
Since the starting of the examination in 1961, the syllabus majorly consists of topics that are taught in Indian High schools, from the curriculum of Class XI and Class XII. These include topics from mathematics, physics and chemistry (organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry and physical chemistry). A recent change in the syllabus was carried out in November 2021, when a revised syllabus was adopted for the exam, this syllabus has been implemented from 2023 onwards. A brief overview of topics asked is listed below.

==Seats==
Source:

The number of students taking the examination increased substantially each year with 506,484 candidates registered for JEE-Advanced- 2012. However, with the two stage JEE-Main + JEE-Advanced structure from 2013, the number of candidates in JEE-Advanced is fixed at 150 thousand students in 2013 and it is increased in subsequent years to 250 thousand as of 2022. The total seats available in each institute (Seat Matrix) is summarized in table below.

&quot;Note: This intake is only about bachelor&#x27;s program intake through JEE-Advanced and it is not about intake in IITs, because some IITs also admit students through UCEED and Olympiads.&quot;

In 2011, additional courses were introduced in the IITs. IIT Tirupati and IIT Palakkad were started in 2015 and four more institutes (IIT Bhilai, IIT Dharwad, IIT Goa, and IIT Jammu) opened in 2016. In 2018, to ensure minimum female enrollment of 14%, the IITs introduced &quot;female-only&quot; and &quot;gender-neutral&quot; seats based on 2017 enrollment statistics; and &quot;super-numerary&quot; seats were allocated per-institute and per-course to reach a 14% target. With these, and slight overall seat increases, the total seat availability was over 12,000, including 801 &quot;super-numerary female-only&quot; seats. For 2019, with the partial rollout of a 10% EWS quota (without a reduction in non-reserved seats) and the increase of the female enrollment target to 17%, the total seats available went up to over 13,500, with over 1200 super-numerary female-only seats. In 2020, with the full rollout of the 10% EWS quota and a 20% female enrolment target, total available seats increased further to 16,053, with over 1500 super-numerary female-only seats.

==Criticism==
In 2012, Super 30 founder and mathematician Anand Kumar criticized the New Admission Norms, saying that the decision of the IITs&#x27; council to give a chance to students in the top 20% from various boards in the class 12 examinations was &quot;a decision in haste&quot;. &quot;This is one decision that will go against the poor, who don&#x27;t have the opportunity to study in elite schools,&quot; he added.

The IIT-JEE is conducted only in English and Hindi; it has been criticized as being harder for students from places where other Indian languages, like Telugu, Tamil, Kannada, Malayalam, Urdu, Oriya, Bengali, Marathi, Assamese, or Gujarati, are more prominent. In September 2011, the Gujarat High Court acted on a Public Interest Litigation by the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad, demanding the examinations be conducted in Gujarati too. A second petition was made that October by Navsari&#x27;s Sayaji Vaibhav Sarvajanik Pustakalaya Trust. Another petition was made at the Madras High Court for conducting the exam in Tamil. In the petition, it was claimed that not conducting the exam in the regional languages violates article 14 of the Constitution of India. The Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) party, a political party in Tamil Nadu, held a demonstration at Chennai for conducting the IIT-JEE and other national entrance exams in regional languages also, particularly Tamil in Tamil Nadu.

The PMK party filed Public Interest Litigation in the Madras High Court to conduct the IIT-JEE entrance exam in Tamil. They claimed that every year 763,000 students were completing grade 12 in Tamil Nadu, 75% of them from Tamil Medium. They had to take the entrance exam in English or Hindi, neither of which was their medium of instruction nor their mother tongue, and so were denied their fundamental right to take the entrance exam in a language familiar to them. Shiv Sena urged the MHRD to conduct the IIT-JEE and other national undergraduate entrance exams in regional languages, particularly Marathi in Maharashtra. In 2017, the Supreme Court ordered JAB to put a bar on the ongoing counseling process. There were three questions comprising a total of 11 marks that were unclear.

JEE(Advanced) has also been criticised for its notoriously tough, unpredictable paper pattern, for a high school student, the questions asked go way beyond the scope of conventional teaching in schools, this forces the students to opt for coaching classes. The coaching classes create a situation of extreme pressure for the students, gradually affecting their mental health.

==Coaching==

These academies included mock tests multiple times a week, up to 200 students per class, and long hours, ranging from 4 to 7 hours a day, in addition to regular high school work. There were hundreds of academies across the country, and the most famous—in Kota, Rajasthan—attracted approximately 125,000 students each year.

Coaching programs are major corporations, listed on the Indian stock market and also attracting billions of dollars of investment from private equity firms. The high-pressure environment at these coaching institutes has been blamed for a significant number of suicides. To mitigate this pressure, initiatives like National Level Common Entrance Examination (NLCEE) provide students with exposure visits to prestigious institutions, helping them make informed decisions and reduce stress.

==Recent modifications in the exam==

There were several changes made to the exam in 2018. The Joint Admission Board (JAB) decided to conduct the entire exam online from 2018 onwards, hoping to reduce the chances of paper leak and make logistics and evaluation easier. It said that the online exam would neutralize the problem of misprinting.

JEE(Advanced) 2020 was scheduled on 17 May 2020. However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the JEE-Main 2020 April attempt was postponed to September (JEE(Main) 2020 September attempt was held from 1 September 2020 to 6 September 2020). JEE(Advanced) 2020 was also postponed and was held on 27 September 2020.

A series of schedule revisions were carried out in 2021. The former Education minister of India, Ramesh Pokhriyal confirmed the dates for the exam. JEE-Main exam was slated to be conducted in eight sessions over four days—two sessions each day—for each phase, with a total of four phases being held in four different months. The first phase was organized from 23 to 28 February, while the other phases were scheduled to be organized in the subsequent months of March, April and May. The JEE-Advanced exam was scheduled to be held on 3 July 2021 but was postponed—together with the third and fourth phases of the JEE-Main examination that were to be held in the respective months of April and May—due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The third and fourth phases of the JEE-Main examinations were later held on 20 July – 3 August and 26 August – 2 September, respectively. The JEE-Advanced exam was held on 3 October 2021.

JEE-Advanced 2022 was scheduled to be held on 3 July 2022 in the usual two sessions - Morning and Afternoon (both compulsory). However, with 2022 JEE-Main being postponed from April/May to 20–29 June/21–30 July, JEE-Advanced 2022 was also postponed and subsequently held on 28 August 2022.

On 5 November 2024, it was announced by IIT Kanpur, and Joint Admission Board(JAB) that the attempts of JEE-Advanced are now increased from 2 to 3. But after about 13 days, on 18 November 2024, this decision was canceled by the Joint Admission Board, and the old criteria were reinstated. During the course of these 13 days, some students left their colleges and joined coaching institutes for JEE(Main) and JEE(Advanced) preparation. A petition was filed in the Supreme Court of India by a group of students demanding the restoration of third attempt. The Supreme Court of India granted bail to the dropouts and said that the third attempt would only be applicable to those students who dropped out between 5 November and 18 November 2024.

<text>Imre Madách de Sztregova et Kelecsény (20 January 1823 – 5 October 1864) was a Hungarian aristocrat, writer, poet, lawyer and politician. His major work is &quot;The Tragedy of Man&quot; (&quot;Az ember tragédiája&quot;, 1861). It is a dramatic poem approximately 4000 lines long, which elaborates on ideas comparable to Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot; and Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. The author was encouraged and advised by János Arany, one of the most famous of the 19th-century Hungarian poets.

==Life==
Madách was born in his family castle in Alsósztregova, the Kingdom of Hungary (today Dolná Strehová, Slovakia) in 1823 at the heart of a wealthy noble family. From 1829 Madách studied at the Piarist school of Vác. During a cholera epidemic he stayed in Buda in 1831. In 1837 he began his studies at the university of Pest. In 1842 he officially became a lawyer.

He took part in the Hungarian revolution of 1848–1849 and was imprisoned; on his return to his small estate in the county of Nógrád, he found that his family life had meanwhile been completely wrecked. This only increased his natural tendency to melancholy, and he withdrew from public life till 1861, devoting his time mainly to the composition of his chief work, &quot;Az ember tragédiája&quot; (&quot;The Tragedy of Man&quot;). He died in Alsósztregova.

==Works==
*&quot;A civilizátor&quot; (&quot;The Civiliser&quot;) – 1859
*&quot;Mózes&quot; (&quot;Moses&quot;) – 1861
*&quot;Az ember tragédiája&quot; (&quot;The Tragedy of Man&quot;) – 1861

==&quot;The Tragedy of Man&quot;==
The dramatic poem &quot;The Tragedy of Man&quot; is Madách&#x27;s major and most enduring piece of writing. The tragic events of the failed Hungarian Revolution of 1848/49 in addition to the deaths of close family members such as his sister and her husband, captain Karl Balog de Mánko-Bük, and his temporary stay in prison fueled the emotional status in which he completed his work. Today it is the central piece of Hungarian theaters&#x27; repertoire and is mandatory reading for students in secondary school. Many lines have become common quotes in Hungary. Madách, then a country nobleman with virtually no literary experience, sent the work to the poet Arany who enthusiastically encouraged him and suggested some emendations to the text. The piece was at first only published in printed form, not staged, because the many changes of scene (15 scenes) were hard to come by through the technical standards of the day.

The main characters are Adam, Eve and Lucifer. The three travel through time to visit different turning-points in human history and Lucifer tries to convince Adam that life is (will be) meaningless and mankind is doomed. Adam and Lucifer are introduced at the beginning of each scene, with Adam assuming various important historical roles and Lucifer usually acting as a servant or confidant. Eve enters only later in each scene. &quot;The Tragedy of Man&quot; contains fifteen scenes, with ten historical periods represented.

==Honors==
A postage stamp was issued in his honor by Hungary on 1 July 1932.
On 23 June 2010, &quot;The Tragedy of Man&quot; is 150 years old - Miniature Sheet issued by Hungary.

<text>Charles Bruce Catton (October 9, 1899 – August 28, 1978) was an American historian and journalist, known best for his books concerning the American Civil War. Known as a narrative historian, Catton specialized in popular history, featuring interesting characters and historical vignettes, in addition to the basic facts, dates, and analyses. His books were researched well and included footnotes. He won the Pulitzer Prize for History and the National Book Award for Nonfiction in 1954 for his book &quot;A Stillness at Appomattox&quot; (1953), a study of the final campaign of the war in Virginia and third book in his &quot;Army of the Potomac&quot; trilogy.

==Early life==

Charles Bruce Catton was born in Petoskey, Michigan, to George R. and Adela M. (Patten) Catton, and raised in Benzonia, Michigan. His father was a Congregationalist minister, who accepted a teaching position in Benzonia Academy and later became the academy&#x27;s headmaster. As a boy, Catton first heard the reminiscences of the aged veterans who had fought in the Civil War. In his memoir, &quot;Waiting for the Morning Train&quot; (1972), Catton explained how their stories made a lasting impression upon him:
 During 1916, Catton began attending Oberlin College, but he quit because of World War I without completing a degree.

==Journalism career==

After serving briefly with the United States Navy during World War I, Catton became a reporter and editor for the newspapers The &quot;Cleveland News&quot; (as a freelance reporter), the &quot;Boston American&quot; (1920–1924), and the Cleveland &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; (1925). From 1926 to 1941, he worked for the Newspaper Enterprise Association, a Scripps-Howard syndicate), for which he wrote editorials and book reviews, as well as serving as a Washington, D.C. correspondent. Catton tried twice to complete his studies, but found himself repeatedly distracted by his newspaper work. Oberlin College awarded him an honorary degree in 1956.

==Writing career==

At the start of World War II, Catton was too old for military service. During 1941, he accepted a position as Director of Information for the War Production Board, and later he had similar jobs in the Department of Commerce and the Department of the Interior. His experiences as a federal employee prepared him to write his first book, &quot;The War Lords Of Washington&quot;, during 1948. Although the book was not a commercial success, it inspired Catton to quit federal employment to become a full-time author.

In 1954, Catton accepted the position as founding editor of the new magazine &quot;American Heritage&quot;. Catton served initially as a writer, reviewer, and editor. In the first issue, he wrote:
===Army of the Potomac trilogy===

In the early 1950s, Catton published three books known collectively as the Army of the Potomac trilogy, a history of that army. For &quot;Mr. Lincoln&#x27;s Army&quot; (1951), the first volume, Catton recounted the army&#x27;s formation, the command of George B. McClellan, the Peninsula Campaign, the Northern Virginia Campaign, and the Battle of Antietam. For the second volume, &quot;Glory Road&quot; (1952), Catton recounted the army&#x27;s history with new commanding generals, from the Battle of Fredericksburg to the Battle of Gettysburg. For his final volume of the trilogy, &quot;A Stillness at Appomattox&quot; (1953), Catton recounted the campaigns of Ulysses S. Grant in Virginia from 1864 to the end of the war during 1865. It was his first commercially successful work and it won both the Pulitzer Prize for History and a National Book Award for Nonfiction. The three volumes were reissued in 1984 as a single volume reprint, titled &quot;Bruce Catton&#x27;s Civil War&quot;. In 2022 the books were reissued in one volume by the Library of America.

===Centennial History of the Civil War===

From 1961 to 1965, the Centennial of the Civil War was commemorated, and Catton published his Centennial History of the Civil War trilogy. Unlike his previous trilogy, these books emphasized not only military topics, but social, economic, and political topics as well. For the first volume, &quot;The Coming Fury&quot; (1961), Catton discussed the causes of the war, culminating in its first major combat operation, the First Battle of Bull Run. For the second volume, &quot;Terrible Swift Sword&quot; (1963), he discussed both sides as they mobilize for a massive war effort. The story continued through 1862, ending with McClellan&#x27;s dismissal after the Battle of Antietam. For the third volume, &quot;Never Call Retreat&quot; (1965), the war continued through the battles of Vicksburg and Gettysburg, and the bloody struggles of 1864 and 1865 before the final surrender.

===Ulysses S. Grant trilogy===

After the publication of &quot;Captain Sam Grant&quot; (1950) by historian and biographer Lloyd Lewis, Catton wrote the second and third volumes of this trilogy, making extensive use of Lewis&#x27;s historical research, provided by his widow, Kathryn Lewis, who personally selected Catton to continue her husband&#x27;s work. In &quot;Grant Moves South&quot; (1960), Catton discussed the increasing experience of Grant as a military commander, from victories at the Battle of Fort Henry and the Battle of Fort Donelson, to the Battle of Shiloh and the Vicksburg Campaign. In &quot;Grant Takes Command&quot; (1969), Catton discussed Grant&#x27;s career from the Battle of Chattanooga (1863) through the 1864 Virginia campaigns against Robert E. Lee and the end of the war.

===Other Civil War books===

In addition to these three important trilogies, Catton wrote extensively about the Civil War throughout his career. In &quot;U. S. Grant and the American Military Tradition&quot; (1954), Catton writes what many consider one of the best short biographies of the general. In &quot;Banners at Shenandoah: A Story of Sheridan&#x27;s Fighting Cavalry&quot; (1955), Catton wrote for young people about Union cavalry commander Philip Sheridan in the Shenandoah Valley during 1864. &quot;This Hallowed Ground&quot; (1956) was an account of the war from the Union perspective. Upon its publication, it was widely considered the best single volume history of the Civil War, receiving a Fletcher Pratt Award from the Civil War Round Table of New York during 1957.

In &quot;America Goes to War&quot; (1958), Catton made the case that the American Civil War was one of the first total wars. In &quot;The American Heritage Picture History of the Civil War&quot; (1960), Catton wrote the accompanying narrative to a book that included more than 800 paintings and period photographs (this book was republished without pictures in 2004 by Mariner Books as &quot;The Civil War&quot;, with an introduction by James M. McPherson). It received a special Pulitzer Prize citation during 1961. In &quot;The American Heritage Short History of the Civil War&quot; (1960), Catton offers a narrative that discussed the military and political aspects of the war. In &quot;Two Roads to Sumter&quot; (1963), written with his son William, Catton recounted the 15 years prior to the war, as considered from the points of view of the two main politicians involved in the conflict: Abraham Lincoln and Jefferson Davis. In &quot;Gettysburg: The Final Fury&quot; (1974), Catton offered a slim volume concerning the Battle of Gettysburg, dominated by photographs and illustrations.

===Other books===

In addition to Civil War histories, Catton published other books, including &quot;The War Lords Of Washington&quot; (1948), an account of Washington, D.C., during World War II, based on his experiences in the federal government, &quot;Four Days: The Historical Record Of The Death Of President Kennedy&quot; (1964), a 144-page collaboration of the &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine and United Press International on the John F. Kennedy assassination, and &quot;Waiting for the Morning Train&quot; (1972), about the author&#x27;s Michigan boyhood. Toward the end of his life, Catton published &quot;Michigan: A Bicentennial History&quot; (1976) and &quot;The Bold &amp; Magnificent Dream: America&#x27;s Founding Years, 1492–1815&quot; (1978).

===Poetry===
&quot;Names from the War&quot; (1960), a long poem, was published in 1960. It was set to music by Alec Wilder.

== Reception ==
In a review of Catton&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Waiting for the Morning Train&quot;, New York Times writer Webster Schott wrote, looking back over Catton&#x27;s career, that &quot;As much as anyone who has ever written about the Civil War, Bruce Catton made it real. Catton not only told us how and why it happened, he made us feel it. He brought to his writing an extraordinary combination of scholarship, literary skill and intimate concern.&quot;

Oliver Jensen, who succeeded Catton as editor of &quot;American Heritage&quot;, wrote that &quot;No one ever wrote American history with more easy grace, beauty and emotional power, or greater understanding of its meaning, than Bruce Catton... There is a near-magic power of imagination in Catton’s work [that] almost seemed to project him physically onto the battlefields, along the dusty roads and to the campfires of another age.&quot;

American writer Gore Vidal criticized Catton for a hagiographic approach to writing about prominent Americans of the past, calling him &quot;that ubiquitous clone of Parson Weems.&quot; Vidal groups Catton with American historians who &quot;never accept as a fact anything that might obscure those figures illuminated by the high noon of Demos...&quot; As an example, he cites Catton&#x27;s dismissal of stories related to Grant&#x27;s alcohol consumption during the Civil War and places Catton &quot;in Parson Weems land where all our presidents were good and some were great and none ever served out his term without visibly growing in office.&quot;

==Personal life==

On August 16, 1925, Catton married Hazel H. Cherry. During 1926, they had a son, William Bruce Catton, who taught history at Princeton University and at Middlebury College, Vermont, where he was the first Charles A. Dana Professor of History.

==Death and legacy==

Bruce Catton died in a hospital near his summer home at Frankfort, Michigan, after a respiratory illness. He was buried in Benzonia Township Cemetery in Benzie County, Michigan.

During 1977, the year before his death, Catton received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s greatest civilian honor, from President Gerald R. Ford, who noted that the author and historian &quot;made us hear the sounds of battle and cherish peace.&quot;

Of the many Civil War historians, Catton was arguably the most prolific and popular. Oliver Jensen, who succeeded him as editor of the magazine &quot;American Heritage&quot;, wrote:
The Bruce Catton Collection is housed in the Archives of The Citadel, the Military College of South Carolina.

===Bruce Catton Prize===
Since 1984, the Bruce Catton Prize was awarded for lifetime achievement in the writing of history. In cooperation with American Heritage Publishing Company, the Society of American Historians during 1984 initiated the biennial prize that honors an entire body of work. It is named for Bruce Catton, prizewinning historian and first editor of &quot;American Heritage&quot; magazine. The prize consisted of a certificate and $2,500.

The prize was awarded to Dumas Malone (1984), C. Vann Woodward (1986), Richard B. Morris (1988), Henry Steele Commager (1990), Edmund S. Morgan (1992), John Hope Franklin (1994), Arthur Schlesinger, Jr. (1996), Richard N. Current (1998), Bernard Bailyn (2000), Gerda Lerner (2002), David Brion Davis (2004), and David Herbert Donald (2006).

<doc id="906857" wikidata="Q716237" url="?curid=906857" title="Song Jiang">
<text>Song Jiang was a Chinese historical figure who led an armed rebellion against the ruling Song Dynasty in the early 12th century. His band marauded over a region straddling the present-day Chinese provinces of Shandong and Henan. They eventually surrendered to the Imperial Court. The historical Song Jiang was turned into a fictional character in &quot;Water Margin,&quot; which became one of the four famous Classic Chinese Novels. He is the central figure in the book, leading the 108 Heroes who gather as bandits in Shandong&#x27;s Liangshan Marsh.

==Life==
Song Jiang is mentioned in the &quot;History of Song&quot;, the most authoritative of records on the history of the Song dynasty. His name appears in the portion relating to Emperor Huizong (), which says: 

Another account, from the portion relating to Zhang Shuye in the &quot;History of Song&quot;, records the following: 

==In &quot;Water Margin&quot;==

The fictional Song Jiang in &quot;Water Margin&quot; is based on the historical character as well as folktales that had been circulating in the Shandong region. One tale, for example, is about &quot;36 huge banners and 72 smaller banners of local bandits&quot;, which might be whom the 108 Stars of Destiny in &quot;Water Margin&quot; were based on&quot;.&quot; 

===Background===
In &quot;Water Margin&quot;, Song Jiang is depicted as short, swarthy and having a big squarish mouth and eyes like those of a fenghuang. He lives and works in Yuncheng County, where he serves as a clerk of the magistrate. He is nicknamed &quot;Timely Rain&quot; because he is generous and helpful, often assisting heroes in difficulties as well as the indigent. As he is known to be filial, he is also called &quot;Filial and Righteous Dark Third Son&quot; and &quot;Dark Song Jiang&quot;, with &quot;dark&quot; referring to his complexion. After all the 108 Stars of Destiny come together at Liangshan, he goes by another nickname, &quot;Protector of Justice&quot;, to advertise his mission in life. He is trained in both scholarly and martial arts, but he is apparently great in fighting. He has a younger brother named Song Qing. 

Song Jiang is a close friend of Yuncheng&#x27;s chief constables Zhu Tong and Lei Heng, as well as Chao Gai, the headman of Yuncheng&#x27;s Dongxi Village. After Chao, in conjunction with seven other men, hijacked valuables being escorted as birthday gifts to the Grand Tutor Cai Jing in the imperial capital Dongjing, the government of Jizhou is under pressure to solve the case as Yellow Mud Ridge, the site where the robbery took place, is within his jurisdiction. He Tao, the chief constable of Jizhou, is tasked with tracking down the robbers. Song runs into He outside the magistrate office of Yuncheng, who tells him he has identified Chao Gai as the mastermind of the heist. Upon hearing this, Song excuses himself and rushes to Dongxi Village to warn Chao of his impending arrest. The robbers thus manage to pack up in time and escape. They seek refuge in the outlaw stronghold at Liangshan Marsh. But Wang Lun, the chief of Liangshan, does not welcome them. Chao is elected in his place after Lin Chong killed Wang.
===Killing Yan Poxi===
Meanwhile, Song Jiang has taken Yan Poxi as his mistress at her mother&#x27;s insistence as a way to repay him for paying for her father&#x27;s funeral. They get along without problem initially. However, Yan Poxi soon dislikes Song Jiang, who has no fancy for women, after knowing Zhang Wenyuan, Song&#x27;s clerical assistant, and has an affair with him.

To convey his gratitude, Chao Gai sends Liu Tang to deliver one hundred pieces of gold each to Song Jiang and Zhu Tong, who has also aided his escape. Liu also brings along a letter from Chao for Song. Song is shocked to find Liu greeting him on the street of Yuncheng one night. He refuses to take all the gold, accepting only one piece as a token. That night he is forced to go to sleep with Yan Poxi by Yan&#x27;s mother. Yan discovers Chao&#x27;s letter, which reveals Song&#x27;s involvement with the outlaws of Liangshan. She threatens to report him to the authorities unless he meets three demands: divorce her and allow her to marry Zhang Wenyuan; let her keep all the things he has given her; and hand over all the gold pieces he has received from Chao. Song agrees to the first two but could not accede to the third as he has accepted only one gold piece. As Yan refuses to believe him and repeatedly threatens to expose him, Song becomes agitated and kills her with a dagger that he always carries in his bag. He flees to hide in a pit in the house of his father. Zhu Tong, who is sent to arrest him, locates him in the vault as Song has once told him about the hiding place. But Zhu lets him go. Song runs away from Yuncheng becoming a fugitive.

===Battle of Qingfeng Fort===
Song Jiang takes shelter in the residence of nobleman Chai Jin, where he meets Wu Song. He runs into Wu again, who has become an itinerant priest to hide his identity after killing several people for revenge, when he is staying at the Kong Family Manor at Mount White Tiger. Song next heads to the house of Hua Rong, garrison commandant of Qingfeng Fort (清風寨; in present-day Qingzhou, Shandong), invited by Hua. When he comes near to the fort, he is trapped and nearly killed by the three bandit chieftains of Mount Qingfeng (清風山) -- Yan Shun, Wang Ying and Zheng Tianshou. The trio treat him with respect upon learning he is Song Jiang as he is famous for his chivalry. Song prevents Wang Ying from raping a woman he has abducted and gets her released when he finds out she is the wife of Liu Gao, the governor of Qingfeng Fort and Hua Rong&#x27;s superior.

On the Lantern Festival night, Song Jiang, who is then living in Hua Rong&#x27;s house, goes outdoor to watch the celebrations. Liu Gao&#x27;s wife spots him and lies to her husband that Song had abducted her at Mount Qingfeng and attempted to rape her. Believing his wife, Liu orders Song arrested. Hua Rong breaks into Liu&#x27;s house and frees Song. As Song flees to Mount Qingfeng following Hua&#x27;s advice he is waylaid and re-arrested by Liu&#x27;s men. Meanwhile, Hua is seized in an ambush by Huang Xin, a military officer sent from Qingzhou prefecture, which oversees Qingfeng Fort. As Huang escorts Song and Hua back to Qingzhou, the convoy is intercepted by the bandits of Mount Qingfeng, who rescue the two prisoners. Liu is killed in the fight while Huang escapes. Qingzhou sends Qin Ming, a high-ranking military officer, to eliminate Mount Qingfeng. But Qin is caught in a trap and brought before Song. Although Qin is glad to meet Song, having heard much about him, he refuses to join the stronghold. As Qin spends the night at Mount Qingfeng, Song sends bandits led by a man disguised as Qin to pillage and raze a suburban settlement of Qingzhou. Murong Yanda, the governor of Qingzhou, falls for the ruse and executes Qin&#x27;s family. That forces Qin to defect to Song&#x27;s camp. As Qinghou is likely to send a bigger force to crack down on them, Song suggests the group go join the band at Liangshan. But he leaves the group on the way there as he runs into Shi Yong, who hands him a letter from Song Qing which falsely claims that their father has passed on.

===Banished to Jiangzhou===
Song Jiang returns to Yuncheng to mourn his father but find the latter alive. The old man has faked death to lure him back to prevent him from falling into bad company. Alerted to his return, Yuncheng&#x27;s authorities arrest Song over the killing of Yan Poxi. Due to his past service at the magistrate office, Song is spared the death penalty. He is tattooed on the face and exiled to Jiangzhou (江州; present-day Jiujiang, Jiangxi).

On the way, Song Jiang and his two escorts come by Jieyang Ridge and are nearly slaughtered by the innkeeper Li Li to be made into minced meat after being drugged. He is saved by Li Jun, another of his admirers. Informed of Song&#x27;s banishment to Jiangzhou, Li Jun has been waiting by the Xunyang River expecting to meet him. During the wait, he happens to come to Li Li&#x27;s inn for refreshment. They revive Song after confirming his identity through the official document carried by the escorts. They treat him with hospitality before seeing him off to Jiangzhou.

At Jieyang Town, Song generously tips Xue Yong, a street performer of martial arts, seeing that not one spectator awards him. In doing that he offends the brothers Mu Hong and Mu Chun, who wield immense influence over the town. Because Xue, who is from out of town, has not gone to pay them respects, the Mus have ordered the townsfolk not to give him a cent. That night Song and his escorts happen to be offered lodging in the Mus&#x27; house by their kindly father. When Song discovers they are in danger, the three flee. Pursued by the Mus, they desperately board the boat of pirate Zhang Heng at Xunyang River. Midway across the river, Zhang wants to kill them and take their possessions. Song is again saved by Li Jun, who accidentally comes by in his boat. Zhang and the Mu brothers are shocked to learn that the man is Song Jiang. Song receives warm treatment from his new friends before proceeding on to Jiangzhou.

At Jiangzhou, Song Jiang meets the chief warden Dai Zong, who is a friend of Wu Yong, the chief strategist of Liangshan, and jailer Li Kui. He and Li take to each other as Song is generous and Li straightforward. Song also meets the fishmonger Zhang Shun, Zhang Heng‘s younger brother. As Song is allowed to move freely in and out of jail by Dai, one day he goes alone to drink at a restaurant on the bank of the Xunyang River. Feeling miserable over his misfortunes, he writes a poem in drunkenness on the wall in the eatery. He forgets the incident the next day.

Huang Wenbing, a petty official, discovers the poem, which he concludes is seditious, and reports it to Cai Jiu, the prefect of Jiangzhou. Cai, a son of Cai Jing, orders Song jailed and sends Dai Zong to Dongjing to seek advice from his father on the matter. However, Dai ends up in Liangshan where he discloses the news to the outlaws. Wu Yong forges a letter ordering Cai Jiu to transfer Song Jiang to Dongjing. The plan is to rescue Song on the way when he is being conveyed there. But Huang Wenbing spots a giveaway in the fake letter. Furious, Cai Jiu sentences both Song and Dai to death. Wu Yong meanwhile has realized the mistake and sends a number of chieftains to Jiangzhou to rescue the two. They storm the execution ground and carry the two away. But they are stranded at a riverbank. Fortunately Li Jun arrives with all the friends of Song Jiang from the Jieyang region in boats and the entire bunch are ferried to safety. After killing Huang Wenbing, Song goes with the bunch to Liangshan, where he takes the second position as deputy to Chao Gai.

===As chief of Liangshan===

Song Jiang goes home alone to fetch his father and Song Qing to Liangshan. But news of his return leaks and constables come after him. Fleeing, Song stumbles into the temple of a goddess and hides in a closet. Falling into a nap, he dreams of meeting the goddess Jiutian Xuannü, who gives him three heavenly books which she says would guide him in his leadership of Liangshan. He wakes up to find himself holding the three books. 
In almost every of Liangshan&#x27;s military battle, Song Jiang is the commander. He leads the three offensives on the Zhu Family Manor, the attack on Gaotangzhou to save Chai Jin, the fight against Huyan Zhuo&#x27;s attempt to stamp out Liangshan, the battle at Qingzhou which ends with absorption of three strongholds, the effort to rescue Shi Jin and Lu Zhishen at Huazhou, the engagement with Fan Rui at Mount Mangdang, the assault on Daming to save Lu Junyi and Shi Xiu, the face-off against Guan Sheng, and the expedition against the Zeng Family Fortress to avenge the death of Chao Gai. Chao was earlier killed in action when he, for the first time heading a military force of Liangshan instead of Song, battled with the Zeng Family Fortress. Following his death Song Jiang becomes Liangshan&#x27;s acting chief pending the capture of Chao&#x27;s killer Shi Wengong. Chao has left word that whoever seizes his killer would succeed him. Although in the end it is Lu Junyi who catches Shi, Song Jiang becomes the chief of Liangshan with wide support among the chieftains. That also comes after he beat Lu in a contest in which they had agreed whoever overran the prefecture assigned to him first would be made chief. Song conquered Dongping first while Lu stalled in his effort to take Dongchang. 

Although his crimes are egregious and he is regarded as a enormous threat by the government, Song Jiang harbors the wish to serve the Song Empire. He crafts a slogan &quot;Deliver Justice on Heaven&#x27;s behalf&quot; (替天行道)&quot; to hint that Liangshan is committed to championing just causes on behalf of the emperor. After many attempts, including enlisting the help of Li Shishi, a Gējì patronised by Emperor Huizong, Song Jiang finally wins an imperial amnesty for Liangshan. But the emperor sends them on a series of expeditions against invaders from the Liao Empire and rebel forces in Song territory to prove their loyalty. The last of these expeditions, which is against the rebel Fang La, is highly costly, with at least two thirds of the 108 heroes killed in action or by disease.

===Death===
Finally through with the expeditions, Song Jiang is appointed governor of Chuzhou (楚州; present-day Huai&#x27;an, Jiangsu). But the corrupt officials in the imperial court are unhappy that he is doing fine. They send him a jar of poisoned wine in the emperor&#x27;s name which he is obliged to consume. When Song Jiang realizes he has been poisoned, he is worried that the hot-tempered Li Kui will rebel against the Song Empire and tarnish the good name of Liangshan. So, he invites Li to Chuzhou and offers him the same wine. Both of them die.

In the last chapter of &quot;Water Margin&quot;, the ghosts of Song Jiang and Li Kui appear in Emperor Huizong&#x27;s dream and tell him about their wrongful deaths. Although the emperor orders an inquiry, it comes to nothing as the key witness – the emissary who delivered the wine to Song Jiang – has died mysteriously on the way back to Dongjing. The emperor makes amends to Song only by conferring on him a posthumous title.

==Song Jiang&#x27;s seditious poem==
The following two poems were written by Song Jiang at Xunyang Tower in Jiangzhou after he got drunk. It is the second one that is said to carry a seditious message.


Song Jiang then reads what he has written, laughing hysterically. He consumes more drinks and starts to dance in a frenzy of joy. He picks up the inkbrush and writes another four lines:


He then signs off: &quot;Work by Song Jiang from Yuncheng&quot; (鄆城宋江作).

The second poem is deemed seditious because of the last two lines. Huang Chao had started an uprising near the end of the Tang dynasty, leading to its collapse. Huang Wenbing interprets these two lines to mean: &quot;If Song Jiang ever gets an opportunity to start a rebellion against the Song dynasty, he will do worse things than what Huang Chao had done.&quot;

<text>Rollo Howard Beck (26 August 1870 – 22 November 1950) was an American ornithologist, bird collector for museums, and explorer. Beck&#x27;s petrel and three taxa of reptiles are named after him, including a subspecies of Galápagos tortoise, &quot;Chelonoidis nigra becki&quot; from Volcán Wolf. A paper by Fellers examines all the known taxa named for Beck. Beck was recognized for his extraordinary ability as a field worker by Robert Cushman Murphy as being &quot;in a class by himself,&quot; and by University of California at Berkeley professor of zoology Frank Pitelka as &quot;&quot;the&quot; field worker&quot; of his generation.

==Early years==
Rollo Howard Beck was born in Los Gatos, California, and grew up in Berryessa working on apricot and prune orchards. He completed only an 8th grade education, but took an early interest in natural history, trapping gophers after school on neighborhood farms. One of his neighbors, Frank H. Holmes, was a good friend of the ornithologist Theodore Sherman Palmer. Palmer also introduced Beck to Charles Keeler, who studied birdlife of the San Francisco Bay Area, and Beck learned about upland birds hunting quail with Holmes. Beck&#x27;s interest and knowledge of birds grew, and he soon learned how to make ornithological specimens and mount birds for museum collections. He joined the American Ornithologists&#x27; Union in 1894, and was among the first members of the newly formed Cooper Ornithological Society which formed in San Jose, California. He participated in early ornithological expeditions to the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Yosemite, and Lake Tahoe with Holmes and Wilfred Hudson Osgood, and collected and helped describe the first eggs and nests of the western evening grosbeak and hermit warbler.

==Expeditions==
===Channel Islands of California===
In the spring of 1897, Beck headed south to Santa Barbara, California, where he learned to sail a moderate-sized schooner under captain Sam Burtis. He visited the Channel Islands of, including Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa, and San Miguel islands collecting and documenting birds as well as nests and eggs. Beck was the first to collect and document the differences of the island scrub-jays that live on the Channel Islands, now recognized as distinct from mainland forms.

===Galápagos Islands, Ecuador===
Later in 1897, while on his way back to the Sierra Nevada Mountains, Beck was invited to join an ornithological expedition to the Galápagos Islands off the coast of Ecuador, organized by Frank Blake Webster and funded by Lionel Walter Rothschild, of Tring, England, later, and only after his father&#x27;s death in 1915, Lord Rothschild. The expedition was launched to study and collect giant tortoises and the land birds of the Galápagos, and here Beck also polished his sailing skills and became better acquainted with seabirds and the unique fauna of the Galápagos. Beck returned again to the Galápagos to collect more specimens around 1901, and he personally delivered these specimens to Walter Rothschild in Tring. While in Tring, he planned future potential collecting trips to Colombia for Rothschild, and he returned to California by way of Washington, DC, in order to apply for the necessary permits.

===Cocos and Galápagos===
Back in San Francisco, Beck met with Leverett Mills Loomis, Director of the California Academy of Sciences. Loomis was interested in seabirds, especially the Tubinares, now the Procellariiformes, and hired Beck to collect in Monterey Bay, the Channel Islands of California, and the Revillagigedo Islands of Mexico, while he waited for his Colombia permits. In 1905–1906, Beck was hired by the California Academy of Sciences to organize and lead a large seagoing expedition to Cocos Island and the Galápagos Islands aboard the Schooner “Academy.” Loomis organized scientific specialists in botany, herpetology, entomology, and malacology, geology, paleontology, as well as ornithology. Besides Beck, the expedition&#x27;s scientists were: Alban Stewart, botanist; W. H. Ochsner, geologist/paleontologist/malacologist; F. X. Williams, entomologist/malacologist; E. W. Gifford and J. S. Hunter, ornithologists; J. R. Slevin and E. S. King, herpetologists. Together they assembled the largest scientific collection of specimens from the archipelago ever, leading to our great understanding of the biota of the islands.

The great April 18, 1906 San Francisco earthquake and three days of subsequent fire struck while Beck and the expedition were still in the Galápagos Islands. They would not return to San Francisco until Thanksgiving Day, November 29, 1906. Their extensive collections of some 78,000 specimens allowed the academy as an institution to rise, literally and figuratively, from the ashes of &quot;the great conflagration&quot; that devastated San Francisco. The schooner “Academy” acted as the meeting place and storage place for the California Academy of Sciences for several months after their return. Some historians believe that had Beck and the expedition not been out to sea and collecting, the academy would have suffered a lethal blow.

Beck married his wife and lifelong companion, Ida Menzies of Berryessa, in 1907 in Honolulu, Hawaii. He went to work for Joseph Grinnell, the Director of the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of California, Berkeley, in the spring of 1908, and collected waterbirds for Grinnell&#x27;s studies of California birds. Before long, Beck was offered even more money by Dr. Leonard C. Sanford, of New Haven, Connecticut, to collect birds in Alaska for the well-known ornithologist Arthur Cleveland Bent, who was collecting for his studies of “The Life Histories of North American Birds.” He did much of the field work with the young Alexander Wetmore, who had recently graduated from college.

===Brewster-Sanford Expedition to South America===

In 1912, Dr. Leonard Cutler Sanford proposed a larger two-year expedition (that ended up taking five years) to South America for Rollo and Ida, and financed by Mr. F. F. Brewster. They traveled up into lakes and highlands of the Andes, along the coast, and out at sea to the Falkland Islands and Juan Fernández Islands, sailed around Cape Horn in a 12-ton cutter, and up into the Caribbean. This work and these collections proved invaluable to Robert Cushman Murphy, who later published “The Oceanic Birds of South America” based in part on the Brewster-Sanford Expedition collection of Rollo Beck.

===Whitney South Sea Expedition===
In 1920 Beck was contacted by Dr. Sanford who proposed an extended South Pacific expedition. The fieldwork was funded by Harry Payne Whitney of New York, and the specimens were bound for the American Museum of Natural History. This became the longest and greatest of all Beck&#x27;s expeditions and, as with the &quot;Academy&quot; expedition of 1905–06, he was joined by many other accomplished biologists and field collectors with complementary skills, including E. H. Quayle, J. G. Correia, Dr F. P. Drowne, Hannibal Hamlin, Guy Richards, Ernst Mayr, E. H. Bryan Jr., and others. Beck left the expedition in 1929, after sailing through the Pacific, from Tahiti to New Guinea to New Zealand and visiting hundreds of islands between. Rollo and Ida Beck returned to California in 1929 with over 40,000 bird skins and a large anthropological collection. This expedition remains to this day the most comprehensive survey and study of birds in the south-west Pacific islands, and has been written up in dozens of important scientific monographs of birds. The specimens residing at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City form the most comprehensive collection of Pacific birds anywhere.

Rollo and Ida Beck retired to the northern California town of Planada, near Merced, where they continued to study natural history and provide specimens of great scientific value. Most of these later specimens are housed at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco, and at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology at the University of California, Berkeley. There is also a substantial collection at San Jose State University. There is a smaller collection of mounted specimens on exhibit at the Pacific Grove Museum of Natural History, in the town of Pacific Grove, California, as well as a permanent exhibit devoted to the life and work of Rollo Beck.

==Contributions to science==
The work of Beck and other early ornithologists was undertaken primarily to document biodiversity before it was lost forever without being recorded, and to understand the evolution and ecology of organisms from the regions visited during the expeditions. The work of Beck and others brought an awareness of and a catalog of regional biodiversity that is essential to have in order to do modern conservation. Much of what we know about western U.S. birds and Pacific ornithology – from Bent&#x27;s &quot;Life Histories of North American Birds&quot; to Murphy&#x27;s &quot;Oceanic Birds of South America&quot; - rests on the fieldwork of Rollo Beck and other early ornithologists. Some believe that our understanding of global biodiversity and the practice of modern conservation biology, much of which seems to be anti-collecting, owes much to these early collectors who worked so diligently to document and preserve voucher specimens in museums.

==Collection methods ==
Human history is replete with examples of island species that were being persecuted by farmers, ranchers, hunters, and sailors; were being harvested unsustainably; and were being decimated by introduced species. By comparison, scientific collectors were relatively few in number and seldom took large numbers of specimens of any one species, but competition between museums and private collectors to acquire the rarest of the rare put disproportionate collecting pressure on species whose populations were already teetering on the brink for other reasons. Beck and others in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were responding to published statements that &quot;time was running out&quot; and that species should be collected and documented in museum collections &quot;before it is too late.&quot; In the absence of a conservation framework and infrastructure, Beck and others engaged in what can be called &quot;salvage collecting,&quot; which hastened the extinctions and which does not correspond to modern conservation thinking.

Rollo Beck has been blamed for having collected a sample of Guadalupe caracaras in 1900 which were being exterminated by goat herders who viewed the bird as a predator. At the time he assumed the birds were common on Guadalupe Island, but in retrospect he wrote that those he collected might have been the last. Beck also collected, as museum specimens, three of the last four individuals of the subspecies of Galápagos tortoise &quot;Geochelone nigra abingdonii&quot;, the Pinta Island tortoise. The last individual of that island&#x27;s tortoise population became known as Lonesome George when it was found on Pinta Island in November 1971.

==Reptiles named in honor of Beck==
Rollo Beck is commemorated in the scientific names of three taxa of reptiles.
*&quot;Chelonoidis nigra becki&quot;, a tortoise
*&quot;Sceloporus becki&quot;, a lizard
*&quot;Sphaerodactylus becki&quot;, a lizard

<text>S7 Airlines, legal name JSC Siberia Airlines (, &quot;АО Aviakompania Sibir&quot;), is an airline headquartered in Ob, Novosibirsk Oblast, Russia, with offices in Moscow. As of 2008, it was Russia&#x27;s largest domestic airline, with its main bases at Domodedovo International Airport and Tolmachevo Airport. It is a member of the Oneworld alliance, but its membership is currently suspended due to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

==History==
===Early years===

What is now S7 Airlines started in 1957 as &quot;the Tolmachevo united squadron&quot; of the General Directorate of Civil Aviation of the Soviet Union. After the Soviet Union disintegration and during the 1990s Russian economic reforms, a state-run Siberia Airlines was created based on the squadron in 1992 and later privatized in 1994. The same year Siberia was assigned an IATA airline code.

In 1997, Siberia Airlines tried to buy Vnukovo Airlines, to make Moscow its next main hub, but the purchase did not proceed. After the 1998 Russian financial crisis, Vnukovo Airlines was heading towards bankruptcy, and Siberia Airlines offered to merge the two airlines, but Vnukovo refused. In 1999, Siberia Airlines signed a document offering to take over Vnukovo Airlines, in the event Vnukovo ceased operations due to insolvency.

===Development 2000–2009===

Siberia Airlines began merging with Vnukovo Airlines in 2001. The same year, the airline absorbed Baikal Airlines and then in 2004, the airline absorbed Chelyabinsk Airlines and Enkor. 

Siberia Airlines acquired its first non-Russian aircraft, Airbus A310s, in 2004. In the summer of 2004, during the Farnborough Airshow, the company signed a memorandum of understanding to purchase fifty Sukhoi Superjet 100s, with the first to be delivered in 2007. However, the airline subsequently dropped its plans to order this aircraft, citing that the aircraft&#x27;s changed specifications no longer met its requirements.

Siberia Airlines rebranded itself as S7 Airlines in 2005.

In line with an International Air Transport Association (IATA) resolution, from December 2006 the airline began to publish its fares for international destinations originating in Russia in euros, rather than US dollars. This resulted in a fare increase, as the conversion rate used was 1 euro = 1 US dollar. Fuel surcharges were also published in euros. Its domestic fares were still to be shown in the local currency. Also in December 2006, the airline became the second Russian air carrier to complete, and pass, the IATA Operational Safety Audit, which is the first global air safety standard.

In April 2007 S7 announced that it had set up a new division, called Globus, focused on charter flights for tourists to foreign holiday destinations. Initially, the aircraft for this division were drawn from the mainline fleet, but during 2010–2014, ten Boeing 737-800 aircraft were leased with an all-economy layout, with the option for a further ten aircraft.

===Development 2010–Covid===
S7 joined the Oneworld airline alliance in 2010.

In November 2015, S7 Airlines offered to acquire a majority stake in the bankrupt Transaero; the proposal was subsequently rejected by shareholders.

In 2016, the American band OK Go partnered with S7 to film a &quot;zero-g&quot; music video for their song &quot;Upside Down &amp; Inside Out&quot;, aboard a reduced gravity aircraft.

On 28 August 2018, S7 would invest $192.87 million in a new manufacturing plant in Moscow, part of its &quot;Victory&quot; business plan. In December 2018, a few months after the completion of its purchase of Sea Launch the parent holding company was renamed &quot;S7 AirSpace Corporation&quot; to reflect the transition from an aviation-only business.

On 31 March 2019, chairwoman and co-owner Natalia Fileva died after the Epic LT private plane she was in crashed while landing at Frankfurt Egelsbach Airport. In August 2019, S7 Airlines announced it was collecting donations for Siberian forests damaged by massive fires. The airline decided to use a hybrid-retro livery on one of its Airbus A320-200 to the hybrid-retro livery, underlining its previous name and current callsign: Siberia Airlines. The livery is a combination of one from 1992–2005 and one from 2017–today. Also in August 2019, the airline announced that S7 Airlines and Globus Airlines would merge by December 2019, ending Globus&#x27; operations. By early December 2019, the merger had been completed.

===Development 2022–present===
In February 2022, as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, S7 and other Russian airlines were banned from EU airspace and that of other countries. This led to S7 suspending operations in Europe on 25 February 2022 and a suspension of all international flights by 5 March 2022. The owner of aircraft leased to S7 Airlines, AerCap is seeking to repossess their aircraft. In April 2022, S7 was suspended from Oneworld. In July 2022, S7 announced a halt to all plans for its new low-cost subsidiary Citrus due to the required aircraft not being delivered. The US Commerce Department, who had previously sanctioned US manufactured aircraft, extended sanctions to the European manufactured Airbus aircraft in S7&#x27;s fleet in August 2022. 

In September 2022, S7 reached an agreement to hand back its two leased Boeing 737 MAX to their lessor. The aircraft VQ-BGV and VQ-BGW, were transferred via Turkey, a neutral country. Air Lease Corporation are seeking to recover six Airbus A320s, two Airbus A321ceo, and five A321neo, as the lease payments are not being made.

October 2023 saw problems for S7, with spare parts for engines and the servicing of aircraft, as a result of sanctions, have reduced the number of Airbus aircraft that are operational to around 13, or 20%, of the Airbus fleet.

In December 2023, an agreement was reached with AerCap, ALC, SMBC Aviation Capital and others to purchase 45 aircraft for around 45-50 billion rubles, with help from the Russian National Wealth Fund.

In July 2024, Dmitry Yadrov, the head of Russia’s civil aviation regulator confirmed reports from S7 that they were &quot;decommissioning&quot; their A320neo and A321neo aircraft due to ongoing issues with the Pratt &amp; Whitney PW1000G engines and international sanctions preventing regular maintenance of the engines.

However, the order was officially cancelled on 29 January 2009, with S7 stating that it was considering the possibility of taking the aircraft under a leasing scheme. As of November 2008, all Soviet-made aircraft had left the fleet.

In April 2018, S7 renewed interest in the Sukhoi Superjet by planning to purchase 25 Sukhoi Superjet 75 aircraft, with an option of 50 more for the new modification of the Superjet family, and become the launch customer. These will replace the airline&#x27;s aging Embraer 170 aircraft. The airline plans to take deliveries of this aircraft from 2023. However in September 2019, it was announced the project had been scrapped.

In October 2018, the airline took delivery of its first Boeing 737 MAX 8 and became the Russian launch customer of the aircraft type. In September 2022 the aircraft were returned to their lessor.

<text>Auguste Henri André Duméril (30 November 1812 – 12 November 1870) was a French zoologist. His father, André Marie Constant Duméril (1774–1860), was also a zoologist. In 1869 he was elected as a member of the Académie des sciences.

Duméril studied at the University of Paris, and in 1844 became an associate professor of comparative physiology at the university. From 1857, he was a professor of herpetology and ichthyology at the Muséum National d&#x27;Histoire Naturelle in Paris.

In 1851, with his father, he published &quot;Catalogue méthodique de la collection des Reptiles&quot;. With zoologist Marie Firmin Bocourt (1819–1904), he collaborated on a project called &quot;Mission scientifique au Mexique et dans l&#x27;Amérique Centrale&quot;, a publication that was the result of Bocourt&#x27;s scientific expedition to Mexico and Central America from 1864 to 1866. The section on reptiles is considered to be Dumeril&#x27;s best written effort in the field of herpetology. Duméril died in 1870 during the siege of Paris, and &quot;Mission scientifique au Mexique et dans l&#x27;Amérique Centrale&quot; was continued by Bocourt, Léon Vaillant (1834–1914) and other scientists.

As part of the &quot;Collection des Suites à Buffon&quot;, he issued a two-volume ichthyological study titled &quot;Histoire naturelle des poissons, ou Ichtyologie générale&quot; (1865, 1870), research that complemented the works of Georges Cuvier (1769–1832) and Achille Valenciennes (1794–1865) by describing species not covered by the two famous naturalists. Duméril also conducted significant research involving the axolotl (&quot;Ambystoma mexicanum&quot;).

==Tribute==
&quot;Saurogobio dumerili&quot; was named in honor of Duméril, who invited Bleeker to examine Chinese cyprinids in the Muséum national d’Histoire naturelle’s collection.

<text>Lee Hyun-il (; born 17 April 1980) is a former badminton player from South Korea. He is a former World and Asian Championships bronze medalist, and was part of South Korean team that won the 2003 Sudirman Cup as well the gold medals at the 2002 and 2014 Asian Games.

== Career ==

=== 2002 Asian Games ===
Lee competed in the 2002 Asian Games where he showed signs of promise as an ace singles player for team Korea. In the men&#x27;s team event, Lee dominated the opponents he faced in the tourney, completing all three matches less than 30 minutes and allowing only seven points in the semifinals and eight in the final. Team Korea eventually won their first men&#x27;s team gold medal since 1986 when Park Joo-bong and Kim Moon-soo led the team.

=== 2003 Sudirman Cup ===
At the 2003 Sudirman Cup held in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, Lee helped his team to win its third Sudirman Cup title, winning all three singles matches. Though many great doubles players from South Korea had won numerous international competitions, team Korea had always struggled to win the Thomas and Sudirman Cup competitions due to the lack of top men&#x27;s singles players. However, Lee, the winner of the 2003 Swiss Open, showed spectacular performances through the Sudirman Cup tournament, not dropping a single set. In the semifinal, Lee defeated 2001 World Championship runner-up and 2001 All England Open semifinalist Peter Gade 2-0, which led his team to a 3-2 victory over Denmark. Lee won another 2-0 upset victory over world number one ranked Chen Hong in game 1 of the South Korea&#x27;s final team event against China.

=== 2004 Olympics ===
Lee competed in the 2004 Summer Olympics, which was his first Olympic appearance. Lee easily defeated Stuart Brehaut of Australia in the first round. However, he was surprisingly eliminated in the second round by Boonsak Ponsana of Thailand.

=== 2006 ===
At the 2006 IBF World Championships held in Madrid, Spain, Lee captured his first World Championship medal in the men&#x27;s singles event. He defeated Chetan Anand, Jan Fröhlich, Eric Pang and Chen Jin before losing to Bao Chunlai of China in the semifinals.

=== 2008 Olympics ===
In 2008, he defeated top rank players Lin Dan and Lee Chong Wei in the Korea Open. He participated in the Beijing Olympics, where he reached the semi-finals before being defeated by world number one, Lee Chong Wei from Malaysia, and then being beaten by Chen Jin of China in the bronze-medal playoff.

=== Retirement and comeback ===
After the 2008 Olympics, Lee announced his retirement from international badminton and only competed in national competitions. However, in April 2010 he came out of retirement after much persuasion from the coach and teammates to fill the void of singles players in the Korean national squad. In May 2010, Lee participated in the 2010 Thomas Cup and played in two singles matches.

=== 2012 Summer Olympics ===
Lee lost to Chinese Chen Long in the badminton bronze-medal playoff on 5 August 2012.

=== 2019 ===
Lee who joined the Miryang City Hall team since 2018, decided to retire from the team on 22 November 2019.

<doc id="906875" wikidata="Q928594" url="?curid=906875" title="Grimspound">
<text>Grimspound is a late Bronze Age settlement, situated on Dartmoor in Devon, England. It consists of a set of 24 hut circles surrounded by a low stone wall. The name was first recorded by the Reverend Richard Polwhele in 1797; it was probably derived from the Anglo-Saxon god of war, Grim (more commonly known as Woden, or Odin).

In 1893 an archaeological dig was carried out by the Dartmoor Exploration Committee, which recorded many details of Grimspound as well as, controversially, making a reconstruction of the site.

The site was designate as a scheduled monument in 1928.

==History==
The site was first settled in about 1300 BC. The 24 hut circles are surrounded by a massive granite perimeter wall, which may have stood at 1.7 metres in places. The roundhouses, with an average diameter of 3.4 metres, were each built of a double ring of granite slabs with a rubble infill, a technique still used in dry-stone walling. Hut 3 has a surviving porchway, with the two jamb stones still upright, although the lintel has fallen.

There is evidence of human activity: artefacts include pottery, scrapers and pot boilers. Organic remains such as wood and textiles have not survived owing to the acid nature of the soil.

===Early descriptions===
The name &quot;Grimspound&quot; was first recorded by the Reverend Polwhele in his &quot;Historical Views of Devonshire&quot; in 1793. He called it &quot;The seat of judicature&quot; for the River Dart area, and also surmised that it was &quot;one of the principal temples of the Druids. Other ideas about Grimspound include supposed uses as an Iron Age fort, an encampment for tin miners and even a Phoenician settlement. His interpretation was as a judicial centre for a cantred of the Durius, but his comparison to the Stannary courts show he has explicitly used a modern interpretation and so may be far-fetched ideas Lysons was the first to measure the site, giving an estimate of the walls’ height and thickness as and a measurement of the enclosed area, alongside a description of previous interpretations: a religious site, a ‘british town’ and connected to the Birch Tor mines. He notes two entrances, one to the south (presumably the present one) and one to the north, which despite him probably not ever seeing Grimspound, the estimated measurements are fairly accurate, falling within half an acre of the actual measurement - 1.45 hectares.
Others queried its function, with Burt suggesting in 1826 that the site was a walled town and a place to keep cattle A contemporary writer named Bray supported the notion of it being a ‘town’ and referenced Strabo and Caesar&#x27;s descriptions of early sites as comparisons to Grimspound Around the middle of the 19th century, opinions begin to change. The valley position is noted and its function interpreted as defending cattle against wolves with the hut circles for the owners and cattle herders Two men resisted this change of opinion and saw the site&#x27;s use as protecting the common Dartmoor mineral of tin Interestingly, another author highlighted its location on a possible ancient route through the break in the ridge of Hameldown.

Grimspound was first mapped by A. C. Shillibear in 1829. When overlain on the 1990 map, the discrepancy between the two is very slight, a testament to Shillabeer&#x27;s accuracy of locating features. This includes the pens, gateway, the central hut circles and even a large stone at the northern end of the site. However, the interesting points are the presence of several now-vanished features. In the western side of the enclosure, many features can be seen. To the north of the semi-circular enclosure, is a line of two parallel walls. When compared to the most recent survey, this has disappeared. The semi-circular enclosure has also vanished and, possibly due to the 1893 and 1894 excavations, many internal features of the hut circles are gone. 
An 1855 plan by Nick Whitely shows hut circles outlying the perimeter wall, unrecorded elsewhere.

During September 1904, Bertram Fletcher Robinson had a non-fictional article entitled &quot;The Fortress of the First Britons. A Description of the Fortress of Grimspound, on Dartmoor&quot; published in &quot;Pearson&#x27;s Magazine&quot; (Vol. XVIII, pp. 273–280). This article is illustrated throughout with both drawings and photographs and it was republished during 2008 by Brian Pugh and Paul Spiring in their biography about Robinson, which is titled &quot;Bertram Fletcher Robinson: A Footnote to the Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;.

===Excavation===
In 1893 the Dartmoor Exploration Committee began a dig at the site. The dig, one of whose members was the Reverend Sabine Baring-Gould, reconstructed some of the site, a move criticised by some of the Committee at the time and also by later researchers, including R. Hansford Worth. The excavation commenced with the location of the entrance and then removing the topsoil and any loose stones, before a trench was cut through the hut circle, with straight-edged stones left in place. Once a hearth was discovered, the earth was sieved carefully for environmental finds such as charcoal, seeds and flint. Both halves of the hut circle were then cleared and the soil sieved. Once the entire hut circle had been cleared, the site was backfilled and the huts reconstructed. Whilst this was an antiquarian endeavour, several aspects of the excavation could be seen as highly progressive for the time. On many of their excavations, charcoal and bone samples were collected for museum deposition which along with their sieving of soil indicates an early observance of the importance of environmental evidence, perhaps to date the site or examine in a laboratory for microscopic finds. However, some aspects of their methodology was flawed, such as bias in what they identified as a hut or cattle pen then determining what was an wasn&#x27;t excavated, and to what extent it would be excavated - some huts like Hut II had only a single trench through it. The lack of a drawing and extra information in comparison to Hut I or Hut III is further evidence of their bias.

The 1894 report surmised it was a Neolithic enclosed site and the succeeding report determined its function as a cattle enclosure, with their main reason for reaching this conclusion was the three areas of higher ground surrounding the site, making it militarily indefensible. It could also be argued that they reached this conclusion due to a reliance on the time of the three-age system, which determined the dating of many sites based on the absence or presence of stone, bronze and/or iron objects - the language in the conclusion of the first report suggests that this may have been the case, too.

===Post-excavation===
Since 1894, very little has been done at Grimspound. Many early writers of the 20th century disagreed with the conclusions of the DEC, on both dating and function. The etymology was discussed in 1919 and Watkin concluded that it was of Saxon origin, due to a Saxon etymology of Grimspound meaning &#x27;Witches Enclosure&#x27;. In 1927, Chanter firmly disagreed with the DEC, citing a lack of permanent occupation and therefore concluding that it was a defensive site to protect the tribe from cattle raiders. In 1964 Lady Aileen Fox, a prominent Dartmoor archaeologist during the later 20th century, helped restore the site primarily to help prevent erosion that had taken place since the excavations. Following a 60-year gap in Grimspound literature, Griffiths re-evaluated the date, placing it within the 2nd millennium BC, making it a Bronze Age site Alongside Griffith, Fleming contextualised the site by placing it within the Hameldown reave system, giving the site a &#x27;territory&#x27; and then later interpreting it radically as a defensive camp for warrior bachelors.

Marking the 100th anniversary of the DEC&#x27;s first excavations, the Devon Archaeological Society dedicated their 52nd volume to Grimspound, including articles evaluating the knowledge gained over the past 100 years, including two on Grimspound. Simon Timms critiqued the DEC excavations and identified a need to re-excavate the site and also drew particular attention to the &#x27;massive&#x27; walls, both arguably important points that showed Grimspound may be more significant than had been identified before. Pattison and Fletcher also argued for a re-excavation of the site, and whilst they do not necessarily conclude a function or date, they do identify that it may have also had ceremonial or ritual protection for the inhabitants, rejecting the defensive theory due to the wall size being an illusion and not as substantial as they are thought to be - however, there is little evidence provided for this argument 
Jeremy Butler, a well known author on the archaeology of Dartmoor during the 1990s, provided a description of Grimspound that for the first time recognised possible re-occupation of the site after the Bronze Age. Although he notes there has been a lack of damage to the site between Shillabeer&#x27;s survey and the book&#x27;s writing, he also identifies a need for re-excavation of the site, particularly in the empty areas.

Post 1994, there is a lack of sources on the site although many references and brief descriptions are present in hiking guides and other generic Dartmoor enthusiasts’ books. However, these references contain contradictory statements on dating, function and generic mimicking of information from the DEC. Despite no absolute dating evidence, these range from generic ‘Bronze Age’, to ‘Middle Bronze Age&#x27;, ‘Late Bronze Age’ and ‘Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age’.

Many also disagree over the function, interpreting it as a ‘fortress’, ‘permanent settlement’, &#x27;village&#x27;, and ‘fortified village’

===Geophysical survey===
In 2019, Jowan Albon (as part of an undergraduate dissertation for the University of Leicester) and the Cambridge School of Mines embarked upon a geophysical survey of the site to identify new structures in the empty areas of the site and the extent of wall foundations.

The surveys took place during the Summer and Autumn of 2019, in two parts. The first was an electromagnetometry survey using a GSSI EMP-400 and Wenner Array resistivity using a Chauvin Arnoux soil resistivity tester, on a four-node Wenner Array setting. The second survey was a twin probe resistance survey using an RM85 resistance meter.

The results of the Electromagnetometry were largely inconclusive and showing water in the soil and the natural geology interfering with the results, but some grids also showed potential for possible rubbish pits, as well as a curious horizontal feature. 
The first resistance survey encountered technical difficulties and couldn&#x27;t be accurately located, but did show up a new porched hut circle similar to hut III and also possible features associated with the walls. The second resistance survey was more conclusive, showing four new hut circles, possible stone alignments and curvilinear features that may be paddocks or to do with later re-use of the site. One curious feature in particular was a double circular feature, one half possibly stone-built with the other half being a possible ditched feature, with an unknown function.

==Location==
Grimspound is located in the valley between Hameldown Tor and Hookney Tor, at 450 metres above sea level. The nearest village, Widecombe-in-the-Moor, is a few miles to the south.

==Description==
The site is enclosed by a stone wall, interrupted by a large, paved entrance facing south, uphill towards Hameldown. The wall would have been substantial – in some places its ruins are more than in thickness. However, the site is of limited value from a defensive point of view, so the assumption is that the wall was to keep livestock in, and predators out. It is possible that it was topped by a hedge or fence. On the northern edge of the site is the start of the West Webburn, which was the main water source for the settlement.The walls are predominantly local granite rock as suggested by Sabine Baring-Gould in the initial Grimspound report and can be seen in how Hameldown Tor weathers, providing large thick boulders suitable for facing slabs. It is thought the walls were originally hollow, although recent authors suggest they were double walled with rubble infill which could potentially provide space for a wall-walk on top of it if it were topped with a palisade fence.

The entrance is described as &quot;the most imposing of all&quot; by Jeremy Butler. It is a paved and stepped corridor 5.5 metres long and almost 2 metres wide, with megaliths and other large stones forming the sides. Butler states that it was not designed to exclude livestock. However, there are parallel wall lines to the western side of the enclosure as indicated by Shillabeer in 1829, these may be a corridor-like entryway. It faces downslope suggesting a more defensible entrance. Many of the original stones may have been robbed from the current entry which could mean it was larger.

Excavations at other sites on Dartmoor have shown that such walls were probably built by small teams of men working simultaneously on a section each, as shown by differences in building style; some evidence of this is visible here. However, these may simply be due to the reconstruction work by the 1894 excavation &quot;(see below)&quot;.

===The hut circles===

Twenty-four stone hut circles have been officially recorded here, although there are probably remains of more within the enclosure, which has an area of over 16,000 square metres (four acres). Many of these hut circles feature L-shaped porches. The doorways are paved with naturally flat stones, and all face both downhill and away from the prevailing wind.

The 1894 excavation reported that the huts nearest the entrance (save for Hut 12) were devoid of signs of human habitation, and were therefore used for livestock or storage, as was hut 2 at the opposite side of the compound.

The huts range between in diameter, with walls about thick, made of upright granite slabs packed with an infill of rubble and possibly peat. Excavations at sites such as Holne Moor have shown that such huts had an interior plank lining.

The hearth was variously located at the centre of the hut, or opposite the door. Ash from the hearths was found to be from oak and willow twigs. A lack of log remains and the presence of peat ash shows that by the time of Grimspound&#x27;s occupation, the local forests had been replaced by enough peat buildup for it to be cut for fuel. Cooking holes contained granite pot boilers, pieces of stone heated in the fire and dropped into pots of water sunk into the ground (the pottery of the time not being fireproof).

To the right of each hut entrance is a raised, level area, which the Committee called a &quot;dais&quot; and which was probably the sleeping area.

Four of the huts (3, 7, 17 and 18) contain raised or upright stones, described as &quot;anvil&quot; stones, the purpose of which is unknown.

Unlike many similar sites on Dartmoor, there is no obviously larger hut that can be identified as a headman&#x27;s dwelling, although the Committee did suggest that a pillar outside Hut 19 could have meant that the headman lived there.

===Other objects===
The acidic soil of Dartmoor has destroyed nearly all organic material; it is therefore difficult to tell what Grimspound must have been like during its occupation. A flint arrowhead found nearby, and the lack of querns for grinding cereals, hint at some dependency on goods from outside the area (flint is not local to Dartmoor). The Exploration Committee also declared that the clay used in pottery fragments did not come from a local source.

<text>A metamaterial (from the Greek word μετά &quot;meta&quot;, meaning &quot;beyond&quot; or &quot;after&quot;, and the Latin word &quot;materia&quot;, meaning &quot;matter&quot; or &quot;material&quot;) is a type of material engineered to have a property, typically rarely observed in naturally occurring materials, that is derived not from the properties of the base materials but from their newly designed structures. Metamaterials are usually fashioned from multiple materials, such as metals and plastics, and are usually arranged in repeating patterns, at scales that are smaller than the wavelengths of the phenomena they influence. Their precise shape, geometry, size, orientation, and arrangement give them their &quot;smart&quot; properties of manipulating electromagnetic, acoustic, or even seismic waves: by blocking, absorbing, enhancing, or bending waves, to achieve benefits that go beyond what is possible with conventional materials.

Appropriately designed metamaterials can affect waves of electromagnetic radiation or sound in a manner not observed in bulk materials. Those that exhibit a negative index of refraction for particular wavelengths have been the focus of a large amount of research. These materials are known as negative-index metamaterials.

Potential applications of metamaterials are diverse and include sports equipment optical filters, medical devices, remote aerospace applications, sensor detection and infrastructure monitoring, smart solar power management, Lasers, crowd control, radomes, high-frequency battlefield communication and lenses for high-gain antennas, improving ultrasonic sensors, and even shielding structures from earthquakes. Metamaterials offer the potential to create super-lenses. Such a lens can allow imaging below the diffraction limit that is the minimum resolution d=λ/(2NA) that can be achieved by conventional lenses having a numerical aperture NA and with illumination wavelength λ. Sub-wavelength optical metamaterials, when integrated with optical recording media, can be used to achieve optical data density higher than limited by diffraction. A form of &#x27;invisibility&#x27; was demonstrated using gradient-index materials. Acoustic and seismic metamaterials are also research areas.

Metamaterial research is interdisciplinary and involves such fields as electrical engineering, electromagnetics, classical optics, solid state physics, microwave and antenna engineering, optoelectronics, material sciences, nanoscience and semiconductor engineering.
==History==

Explorations of artificial materials for manipulating electromagnetic waves began at the end of the 19th century. Some of the earliest structures that may be considered metamaterials were studied by Jagadish Chandra Bose, who in 1898 researched substances with chiral properties. Karl Ferdinand Lindman studied wave interaction with metallic helices as artificial chiral media in the early twentieth century.

In the late 1940s, Winston E. Kock from AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories developed materials that had similar characteristics to metamaterials. In the 1950s and 1960s, artificial dielectrics were studied for lightweight microwave antennas. Microwave radar absorbers were researched in the 1980s and 1990s as applications for artificial chiral media.

Negative-index materials were first described theoretically by Victor Veselago in 1967. He proved that such materials could transmit light. He showed that the phase velocity could be made anti-parallel to the direction of Poynting vector. This is contrary to wave propagation in naturally occurring materials.

In 1995, John M. Guerra fabricated a sub-wavelength transparent grating (later called a photonic metamaterial) having 50 nm lines and spaces, and then coupled it with a standard oil immersion microscope objective (the combination later called a super-lens) to resolve a grating in a silicon wafer also having 50 nm lines and spaces. This super-resolved image was achieved with illumination having a wavelength of 650 nm in air.

In 2000, John Pendry was the first to identify a practical way to make a left-handed metamaterial, a material in which the right-hand rule is not followed. Such a material allows an electromagnetic wave to convey energy (have a group velocity) against its phase velocity. Pendry&#x27;s idea was that metallic wires aligned along the direction of a wave could provide negative permittivity (dielectric function ε &lt; 0). Natural materials (such as ferroelectrics) display negative permittivity; the challenge was achieving negative permeability (μ &lt; 0). In 1999 Pendry demonstrated that a split ring (C shape) with its axis placed along the direction of wave propagation could do so. In the same paper, he showed that a periodic array of wires and rings could give rise to a negative refractive index. Pendry also proposed a related negative-permeability design, the Swiss roll.

In 2000, David R. Smith et al. reported the experimental demonstration of functioning electromagnetic metamaterials by horizontally stacking, periodically, split-ring resonators and thin wire structures. A method was provided in 2002 to realize negative-index metamaterials using artificial lumped-element loaded transmission lines in microstrip technology. In 2003, complex (both real and imaginary parts of) negative refractive index and imaging by flat lens using left handed metamaterials were demonstrated. By 2007, experiments that involved negative refractive index had been conducted by many groups. At microwave frequencies, the first, imperfect invisibility cloak was realized in 2006.

From the standpoint of governing equations, contemporary researchers can classify the realm of metamaterials into three primary branches: Electromagnetic/Optical wave metamaterials, other wave metamaterials, and diffusion metamaterials. These branches are characterized by their respective governing equations, which include Maxwell&#x27;s equations (a wave equation describing transverse waves), other wave equations (for longitudinal and transverse waves), and diffusion equations (pertaining to diffusion processes). Crafted to govern a range of diffusion activities, diffusion metamaterials prioritize diffusion length as their central metric. This crucial parameter experiences temporal fluctuations while remaining immune to frequency variations. In contrast, wave metamaterials, designed to adjust various wave propagation paths, consider the wavelength of incoming waves as their essential metric. This wavelength remains constant over time, though it adjusts with frequency alterations. Fundamentally, the key metrics for diffusion and wave metamaterials present a stark divergence, underscoring a distinct complementary relationship between them. For comprehensive information, refer to Section I.B, &quot;Evolution of metamaterial physics,&quot; in Ref.

==Electromagnetic metamaterials==

An electromagnetic metamaterial affects electromagnetic waves that impinge on or interact with its structural features, which are smaller than the wavelength. To behave as a homogeneous material accurately described by an effective refractive index, its features must be much smaller than the wavelength.

The unusual properties of metamaterials arise from the resonant response of each constituent element rather than their spatial arrangement into a lattice. It allows considering the local effective material parameters (permittivity and permeability). The resonance effect related to the mutual arrangement of elements is responsible for Bragg scattering, which underlies the physics of photonic crystals, another class of electromagnetic materials. Unlike the local resonances, Bragg scattering and corresponding Bragg stop-band have a low-frequency limit determined by the lattice spacing. The subwavelength approximation ensures that the Bragg stop-bands with the strong spatial dispersion effects are at higher frequencies and can be neglected. The criterion for shifting the local resonance below the lower Bragg stop-band make it possible to build a photonic phase transition diagram in a parameter space, for example, size and permittivity of the constituent element. Such diagram displays the domain of structure parameters allowing the metamaterial properties observation in the electromagnetic material.

For microwave radiation, the features are on the order of millimeters. Microwave frequency metamaterials are usually constructed as arrays of electrically conductive elements (such as loops of wire) that have suitable inductive and capacitive characteristics. Many microwave metamaterials use split-ring resonators.

Photonic metamaterials are structured on the nanometer scale and manipulate light at optical frequencies. Photonic crystals and frequency-selective surfaces such as diffraction gratings, dielectric mirrors and optical coatings exhibit similarities to subwavelength structured metamaterials. However, these are usually considered distinct from metamaterials, as their function arises from diffraction or interference and thus cannot be approximated as a homogeneous material. However, material structures such as photonic crystals are effective in the visible light spectrum. The middle of the visible spectrum has a wavelength of approximately 560 nm (for sunlight). Photonic crystal structures are generally half this size or smaller, that is &lt; 280 nm. 

Plasmonic metamaterials utilize surface plasmons, which are packets of electrical charge that collectively oscillate at the surfaces of metals at optical frequencies.

Frequency selective surfaces (FSS) can exhibit subwavelength characteristics and are known variously as artificial magnetic conductors (AMC) or High Impedance Surfaces (HIS). FSS display inductive and capacitive characteristics that are directly related to their subwavelength structure.

Electromagnetic metamaterials can be divided into different classes, as follows:

===Negative refractive index===

Negative-index metamaterials (NIM) are characterized by a negative index of refraction. Other terms for NIMs include &quot;left-handed media&quot;, &quot;media with a negative refractive index&quot;, and &quot;backward-wave media&quot;. NIMs where the negative index of refraction arises from simultaneously negative permittivity and negative permeability are also known as double negative metamaterials or double negative materials (DNG).

Assuming a material well-approximated by a real permittivity and permeability, the relationship between permittivity formula_1, permeability formula_2 and refractive index &quot;n&quot; is given by formula_3. All known non-metamaterial transparent materials (glass, water, ...) possess positive formula_1 and formula_2. By convention the positive square root is used for &quot;n&quot;. However, some engineered metamaterials have formula_1 and formula_7. Because the product formula_8 is positive, &quot;n&quot; is real. Under such circumstances, it is necessary to take the negative square root for &quot;n&quot;. When both formula_1 and formula_2 are positive (negative), waves travel in the &quot;forward&quot; (&quot;backward&quot;) direction. Electromagnetic waves cannot propagate in materials with formula_1 and formula_2 of opposite sign as the refractive index becomes imaginary. Such materials are opaque for electromagnetic radiation and examples include plasmonic materials such as metals (gold, silver, ...).

The foregoing considerations are simplistic for actual materials, which must have complex-valued formula_1 and formula_2. The real parts of both formula_1 and formula_2 do not have to be negative for a passive material to display negative refraction. Indeed, a negative refractive index for circularly polarized waves can also arise from chirality. Metamaterials with negative &quot;n&quot; have numerous interesting properties:
*Snell&#x27;s law (&quot;n&quot;1sin&quot;θ&quot;1 = &quot;n&quot;2sin&quot;θ&quot;2) still describes refraction, but as &quot;n&quot;2 is negative, incident and refracted rays are on the &quot;same&quot; side of the surface normal at an interface of positive and negative index materials.
*Cherenkov radiation points the other way.
*The time-averaged Poynting vector is antiparallel to phase velocity. However, for waves (energy) to propagate, a –&quot;μ&quot; must be paired with a –&quot;ε&quot; in order to satisfy the wave number dependence on the material parameters formula_17.

Negative index of refraction derives mathematically from the vector triplet E, H and k.

For plane waves propagating in electromagnetic metamaterials, the electric field, magnetic field and wave vector follow a left-hand rule, the reverse of the behavior of conventional optical materials.

To date, only metamaterials exhibit a negative index of refraction.

===Single negative===
Single negative (SNG) metamaterials have either negative relative permittivity (ε) or negative relative permeability (μ), but not both. They act as metamaterials when combined with a different, complementary SNG, jointly acting as a DNG.

Epsilon negative media (ENG) display a negative ε while μ is positive. Many plasmas exhibit this characteristic. For example, noble metals such as gold or silver are ENG in the infrared and visible spectrums.

Mu-negative media (MNG) display a positive ε and negative μ. Gyrotropic or gyromagnetic materials exhibit this characteristic. A gyrotropic material is one that has been altered by the presence of a quasistatic magnetic field, enabling a magneto-optic effect. A magneto-optic effect is a phenomenon in which an electromagnetic wave propagates through such a medium. In such a material, left- and right-rotating elliptical polarizations can propagate at different speeds. When light is transmitted through a layer of magneto-optic material, the result is called the Faraday effect: the polarization plane can be rotated, forming a Faraday rotator. The results of such a reflection are known as the magneto-optic Kerr effect (not to be confused with the nonlinear Kerr effect). Two gyrotropic materials with reversed rotation directions of the two principal polarizations are called optical isomers.

Joining a slab of ENG material and slab of MNG material resulted in properties such as resonances, anomalous tunneling, transparency and zero reflection. Like negative-index materials, SNGs are innately dispersive, so their ε, μ and refraction index n, are a function of frequency.

=== Hyperbolic ===
Hyperbolic metamaterials (HMMs) behave as a metal for certain polarization or direction of light propagation and behave as a dielectric for the other due to the negative and positive permittivity tensor components, giving extreme anisotropy. The material&#x27;s dispersion relation in wavevector space forms a hyperboloid and therefore it is called a hyperbolic metamaterial. The extreme anisotropy of HMMs leads to directional propagation of light within and on the surface. HMMs have shown various potential applications, such as sensing, reflection modulator, all-optical ultra-fast switching for integrated photonics, imaging, super high resolution and single photon source, steering of optical signals, enhanced plasmon resonance effects.

=== Bandgap ===

Electromagnetic bandgap metamaterials (EBG or EBM) control light propagation. This is accomplished either with photonic crystals (PC) or left-handed materials (LHM). PCs can prohibit light propagation altogether. Both classes can allow light to propagate in specific, designed directions and both can be designed with bandgaps at desired frequencies. The period size of EBGs is an appreciable fraction of the wavelength, creating constructive and destructive interference.

PC are distinguished from sub-wavelength structures, such as tunable metamaterials, because the PC derives its properties from its bandgap characteristics. PCs are sized to match the wavelength of light, versus other metamaterials that expose sub-wavelength structure. Furthermore, PCs function by diffracting light. In contrast, metamaterial does not use diffraction.

PCs have periodic inclusions that inhibit wave propagation due to the inclusions&#x27; destructive interference from scattering. The photonic bandgap property of PCs makes them the electromagnetic analog of electronic semi-conductor crystals.

EBGs have the goal of creating high quality, low loss, periodic, dielectric structures. An EBG affects photons in the same way semiconductor materials affect electrons. PCs are the perfect bandgap material, because they allow no light propagation. Each unit of the prescribed periodic structure acts like one atom, albeit of a much larger size.

EBGs are designed to prevent the propagation of an allocated bandwidth of frequencies, for certain arrival angles and polarizations. Various geometries and structures have been proposed to fabricate EBG&#x27;s special properties. In practice it is impossible to build a flawless EBG device.

EBGs have been manufactured for frequencies ranging from a few gigahertz (GHz) to a few terahertz (THz), radio, microwave and mid-infrared frequency regions. EBG application developments include a transmission line, woodpiles made of square dielectric bars and several different types of low gain antennas.

===Double positive medium===
Double positive mediums (DPS) do occur in nature, such as naturally occurring dielectrics. Permittivity and magnetic permeability are both positive and wave propagation is in the forward direction. Artificial materials have been fabricated which combine DPS, ENG and MNG properties.

===Bi-isotropic and bianisotropic===
Categorizing metamaterials into double or single negative, or double positive, normally assumes that the metamaterial has independent electric and magnetic responses described by ε and μ. However, in many cases, the electric field causes magnetic polarization, while the magnetic field induces electrical polarization, known as magnetoelectric coupling. Such media are denoted as bi-isotropic. Media that exhibit magnetoelectric coupling and that are anisotropic (which is the case for many metamaterial structures), are referred to as bi-anisotropic.

Four material parameters are intrinsic to magnetoelectric coupling of bi-isotropic media. They are the electric (E) and magnetic (H) field strengths, and electric (D) and magnetic (B) flux densities. These parameters are ε, μ, &quot;κ&quot; and χ or permittivity, permeability, strength of chirality, and the Tellegen parameter, respectively. In this type of media, material parameters do not vary with changes along a rotated coordinate system of measurements. In this sense they are invariant or scalar.

The intrinsic magnetoelectric parameters, &quot;κ&quot; and &quot;χ&quot;, affect the phase of the wave. The effect of the chirality parameter is to split the refractive index. In isotropic media this results in wave propagation only if ε and μ have the same sign. In bi-isotropic media with &quot;χ&quot; assumed to be zero, and &quot;κ&quot; a non-zero value, different results appear. Either a backward wave or a forward wave can occur. Alternatively, two forward waves or two backward waves can occur, depending on the strength of the chirality parameter.

In the general case, the constitutive relations for bi-anisotropic materials read 
formula_18
formula_19
where formula_20 and formula_21 are the permittivity and the permeability tensors, respectively, whereas formula_22 and formula_23 are the two magneto-electric tensors. If the medium is reciprocal, permittivity and permeability are symmetric tensors, and formula_24, where formula_25 is the chiral tensor describing chiral electromagnetic and reciprocal magneto-electric response. The chiral tensor can be expressed as formula_26, where formula_27 is the trace of formula_28, I is the identity matrix, N is a symmetric trace-free tensor, and J is an antisymmetric tensor. Such decomposition allows us to classify the reciprocal bianisotropic response and we can identify the following three main classes: (i) chiral media (formula_29), (ii) pseudochiral media (formula_30), (iii) omega media (formula_31).

===Chiral===
Handedness of metamaterials is a potential source of confusion as the metamaterial literature includes two conflicting uses of the terms &quot;left-&quot; and &quot;right-handed&quot;. The first refers to one of the two circularly polarized waves that are the propagating modes in chiral media. The second relates to the triplet of electric field, magnetic field and Poynting vector that arise in negative refractive index media, which in most cases are not chiral.

Generally a chiral and/or bianisotropic electromagnetic response is a consequence of 3D geometrical chirality: 3D-chiral metamaterials are composed by embedding 3D-chiral structures in a host medium and they show chirality-related polarization effects such as optical activity and circular dichroism. The concept of 2D chirality also exists and a planar object is said to be chiral if it cannot be superposed onto its mirror image unless it is lifted from the plane. 2D-chiral metamaterials that are anisotropic and lossy have been observed to exhibit directionally asymmetric transmission (reflection, absorption) of circularly polarized waves due to circular conversion dichrosim. On the other hand, bianisotropic response can arise from geometrical achiral structures possessing neither 2D nor 3D intrinsic chirality. Plum and colleagues investigated magneto-electric coupling due to extrinsic chirality, where the arrangement of a (achiral) structure together with the radiation wave vector is different from its mirror image, and observed large, tuneable linear optical activity, nonlinear optical activity, specular optical activity and circular conversion dichroism. Rizza &quot;et al.&quot; suggested 1D chiral metamaterials where the effective chiral tensor is not vanishing if the system is geometrically one-dimensional chiral (the mirror image of the entire structure cannot be superposed onto it by using translations without rotations).

3D-chiral metamaterials are constructed from chiral materials or resonators in which the effective chirality parameter formula_32 is non-zero. 
Wave propagation properties in such chiral metamaterials demonstrate that negative refraction can be realized in metamaterials with a strong chirality and positive formula_1 and formula_2.
 This is because the refractive index formula_35 has distinct values for left and right circularly polarized waves, given by

: formula_36

It can be seen that a negative index will occur for one polarization if formula_32 &gt; formula_38. In this case, it is not necessary that either or both formula_1 and formula_2 be negative for backward wave propagation. A negative refractive index due to chirality was first observed simultaneously and independently by Plum &quot;et al.&quot; and Zhang &quot;et al.&quot; in 2009.

=== FSS based ===
Frequency selective surface-based metamaterials block signals in one waveband and pass those at another waveband. They have become an alternative to fixed frequency metamaterials. They allow for optional changes of frequencies in a single medium, rather than the restrictive limitations of a fixed frequency response.

==Other types==

=== Elastic ===

These metamaterials use different parameters to achieve a negative index of refraction in materials that are not electromagnetic. Furthermore, &quot;a new design for elastic metamaterials that can behave either as liquids or solids over a limited frequency range may enable new applications based on the control of acoustic, elastic and seismic waves.&quot; They are also called mechanical metamaterials.

=== Acoustic ===

Acoustic metamaterials control, direct and manipulate sound in the form of , infrasonic or ultrasonic waves in gases, liquids and solids. As with electromagnetic waves, sonic waves can exhibit negative refraction.

Control of sound waves is mostly accomplished through the bulk modulus &quot;β&quot;, mass density &quot;ρ&quot; and chirality. The bulk modulus and density are analogs of permittivity and permeability in electromagnetic metamaterials. Related to this is the mechanics of sound wave propagation in a lattice structure. Also materials have mass and intrinsic degrees of stiffness. Together, these form a resonant system and the mechanical (sonic) resonance may be excited by appropriate sonic frequencies (for example audible pulses).

=== Structural ===
Structural metamaterials provide properties such as crushability and light weight. Using projection micro-stereolithography, microlattices can be created using forms much like trusses and girders. Materials four orders of magnitude stiffer than conventional aerogel, but with the same density have been created. Such materials can withstand a load of at least 160,000 times their own weight by over-constraining the materials.

A ceramic nanotruss metamaterial can be flattened and revert to its original state.

=== Thermal ===
Typically materials found in nature, when homogeneous, are thermally isotropic. That is to say, heat passes through them at roughly the same rate in all directions. However, thermal metamaterials are anisotropic usually due to their highly organized internal structure. Composite materials with highly aligned internal particles or structures, such as fibers, and carbon nanotubes (CNT), are examples of this.

=== Nonlinear ===

Metamaterials may be fabricated that include some form of nonlinear media, whose properties change with the power of the incident wave. Nonlinear media are essential for nonlinear optics. Most optical materials have a relatively weak response, meaning that their properties change by only a small amount for large changes in the intensity of the electromagnetic field. The local electromagnetic fields of the inclusions in nonlinear metamaterials can be much larger than the average value of the field. Besides, remarkable nonlinear effects have been predicted and observed if the metamaterial effective dielectric permittivity is very small (epsilon-near-zero media). In addition, exotic properties such as a negative refractive index, create opportunities to tailor the phase matching conditions that must be satisfied in any nonlinear optical structure.

=== Liquid ===
Metafluids offer programmable properties such as viscosity, compressibility, and optical. One approach employed 50-500 micron diameter air-filled elastomer spheres suspended in silicon oil. The spheres compress under pressure, and regain their shape when the pressure is relieved. Their properties differ across those two states. Unpressurized, they scatter light, making them opaque. Under pressure, they collapse into half-moon shapes, focusing light, and becoming transparent. The pressure response could allow them to act as a sensor or as a dynamic hydraulic fluid. Like cornstarch, it can act as either a Newtonian or a non-Newtonian fluid. Under pressure, it becomes non-Newtonian – meaning its viscosity changes in response to shear force.

=== Hall metamaterials ===

In 2009, Marc Briane and Graeme Milton proved mathematically that one can in principle invert the sign of a 3 materials based composite in 3D made out of only positive or negative sign Hall coefficient materials. Later in 2015 Muamer Kadic et al. showed that a simple perforation of isotropic material can lead to its change of sign of the Hall coefficient. This theoretical claim was finally experimentally demonstrated by Christian Kern et al.

In 2015, it was also demonstrated by Christian Kern et al. that an anisotropic perforation of a single material can lead to a yet more unusual effect namely the parallel Hall effect. This means that the induced electric field inside a conducting media is no longer orthogonal to the current and the magnetic field but is actually parallel to the latest.

=== Meta-biomaterials ===
Meta-biomaterials have been purposefully crafted to engage with biological systems, amalgamating principles from both metamaterial science and biological areas. Engineered at the nanoscale, these materials adeptly manipulate electromagnetic, acoustic, or thermal properties to facilitate biological processes. Through meticulous adjustment of their structure and composition, meta-biomaterials hold promise in augmenting various biomedical technologies such as medical imaging, drug delivery, and tissue engineering. This underscores the importance of comprehending biological systems through the interdisciplinary lens of materials science.

==Frequency bands==

=== Terahertz ===
Terahertz metamaterials interact at terahertz frequencies, usually defined as 0.1 to 10 THz. Terahertz radiation lies at the far end of the infrared band, just after the end of the microwave band. This corresponds to millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths between the 3 mm (EHF band) and 0.03 mm (long-wavelength edge of far-infrared light).

=== Photonic ===
Photonic metamaterial interact with optical frequencies (mid-infrared). The sub-wavelength period distinguishes them from photonic band gap structures.

=== Tunable ===
Tunable metamaterials allow arbitrary adjustments to frequency changes in the refractive index. A tunable metamaterial expands beyond the bandwidth limitations in left-handed materials by constructing various types of metamaterials.

=== Plasmonic ===
Plasmonic metamaterials exploit surface plasmons, which are produced from the interaction of light with metal-dielectrics. Under specific conditions, the incident light couples with the surface plasmons to create self-sustaining, propagating electromagnetic waves or surface waves known as surface plasmon polaritons. Bulk plasma oscillations make possible the effect of negative mass (density).

== Applications ==

Metamaterials are under consideration for many applications. Metamaterial antennas are commercially available.

In 2007, one researcher stated that for metamaterial applications to be realized, energy loss must be reduced, materials must be extended into three-dimensional isotropic materials and production techniques must be industrialized.

=== Antennas ===
Metamaterial antennas are a class of antennas that use metamaterials to improve performance. Demonstrations showed that metamaterials could enhance an antenna&#x27;s radiated power. Materials that can attain negative permeability allow for properties such as small antenna size, high directivity and tunable frequency.

=== Absorber ===

A metamaterial absorber manipulates the loss components of metamaterials&#x27; permittivity and magnetic permeability, to absorb large amounts of electromagnetic radiation. This is a useful feature for photodetection and solar photovoltaic applications. Loss components are also relevant in applications of negative refractive index (photonic metamaterials, antenna systems) or transformation optics (metamaterial cloaking, celestial mechanics), but often are not used in these applications.

=== Superlens ===
A &quot;superlens&quot; is a two or three-dimensional device that uses metamaterials, usually with negative refraction properties, to achieve resolution beyond the diffraction limit (ideally, infinite resolution). Such a behaviour is enabled by the capability of double-negative materials to yield negative phase velocity. The diffraction limit is inherent in conventional optical devices or lenses.

=== Cloaking devices ===
Metamaterials are a potential basis for a practical cloaking device. The proof of principle was demonstrated on October 19, 2006. No practical cloaks are publicly known to exist.

=== Radar cross-section (RCS-)reducing metamaterials ===
Metamaterials have applications in stealth technology, which reduces RCS in any of various ways (e.g., absorption, diffusion, redirection). Conventionally, the RCS has been reduced either by radar-absorbent material (RAM) or by purpose shaping of the targets such that the scattered energy can be redirected away from the source. While RAMs have narrow frequency band functionality, purpose shaping limits the aerodynamic performance of the target. More recently, metamaterials or metasurfaces are synthesized that can redirect the scattered energy away from the source using either array theory or generalized Snell&#x27;s law. This has led to aerodynamically favorable shapes for the targets with the reduced RCS.

=== Seismic protection ===

Seismic metamaterials counteract the adverse effects of seismic waves on man-made structures.

=== Sound filtering ===

Metamaterials textured with nanoscale wrinkles could control sound or light signals, such as changing a material&#x27;s color or improving ultrasound resolution. Uses include nondestructive material testing, medical diagnostics and sound suppression. The materials can be made through a high-precision, multi-layer deposition process. The thickness of each layer can be controlled within a fraction of a wavelength. The material is then compressed, creating precise wrinkles whose spacing can cause scattering of selected frequencies.

=== Guided mode manipulations ===
Metamaterials can be integrated with optical waveguides to tailor guided electromagnetic waves (meta-waveguide). Subwavelength structures like metamaterials can be integrated with for instance silicon waveguides to develop and polarization beam splitters and optical couplers, adding new degrees of freedom of controlling light propagation at nanoscale for integrated photonic devices. Other applications such as integrated mode converters, polarization (de)multiplexers, structured light generation, and on-chip bio-sensors can be developed.

==Theoretical models==

All materials are made of atoms, which are dipoles. These dipoles modify light velocity by a factor &quot;n&quot; (the refractive index). In a split ring resonator the ring and wire units act as atomic dipoles: the wire acts as a ferroelectric atom, while the ring acts as an inductor &quot;L, &quot;while the open section acts as a capacitor &quot;C&quot;. The ring as a whole acts as an LC circuit. When the electromagnetic field passes through the ring, an induced current is created. The generated field is perpendicular to the light&#x27;s magnetic field. The magnetic resonance results in a negative permeability; the refraction index is negative as well. (The lens is not truly flat, since the structure&#x27;s capacitance imposes a slope for the electric induction.)

Several (mathematical) material models frequency response in DNGs. One of these is the Lorentz model, which describes electron motion in terms of a driven-damped, harmonic oscillator. The Debye relaxation model applies when the acceleration component of the Lorentz mathematical model is small compared to the other components of the equation. The Drude model applies when the restoring force component is negligible and the coupling coefficient is generally the plasma frequency. Other component distinctions call for the use of one of these models, depending on its polarity or purpose.

Three-dimensional composites of metal/non-metallic inclusions periodically/randomly embedded in a low permittivity matrix are usually modeled by analytical methods, including mixing formulas and scattering-matrix based methods. The particle is modeled by either an electric dipole parallel to the electric field or a pair of crossed electric and magnetic dipoles parallel to the electric and magnetic fields, respectively, of the applied wave. These dipoles are the leading terms in the multipole series. They are the only existing ones for a homogeneous sphere, whose polarizability can be easily obtained from the Mie scattering coefficients. In general, this procedure is known as the &quot;point-dipole approximation&quot;, which is a good approximation for metamaterials consisting of composites of electrically small spheres. Merits of these methods include low calculation cost and mathematical simplicity.

Three conceptions- negative-index medium, non-reflecting crystal and superlens are foundations of the metamaterial theory. Other first principles techniques for analyzing triply-periodic electromagnetic media may be found in Computing photonic band structure

==Institutional networks==

<text>Boonsak Ponsana (; ; born 22 February 1982) is a Thai badminton player. His younger sister Salakjit Ponsana is also part of the Thailand badminton team. He got a Bachelor of Laws from Sri Patum.

== Career ==
Ponsana competed at the 2000 Summer Olympics, but was defeated in the round of 64. At the 2004 Summer Olympics, he was defeating Chris Dednam of South Africa and Lee Hyun-il of South Korea in the first two rounds. In the quarterfinals, Ponsana defeated Ronald Susilo of Singapore 15–10, 15–1. He advanced to the semifinals, in which he lost to Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia 15–9, 15–2. Playing in the bronze medal match, he again lost to an Indonesian, this time Soni Dwi Kuncoro by a score of 15–11, 17-16 for a fourth-place finish. At the 2008 Summer Olympics, he reached the second round of the men&#x27;s singles, where he lost 2 – 0 to Indonesia&#x27;s Sony Dwi Kuncoro.

In 2007, he won the gold medals at the Summer Universiade in the men&#x27;s singles and mixed team event. He also won some international tournament in 2004 Thailand Open, 2007 Singapore Open, and in 2008 India Open. He competed in 2009 Superseries Finals but he did not qualify for the semi-finals. He played for Thailand in 2009 SEA Games in Laos, helping to win a bronze medal for Thailand in men&#x27;s team. In 2012, he repeated his successful run at the Singapore Open Super Series beating Wang Zhengming of China in a thrilling two set match. Prior to his participation in the 2012 Singapore Open, injury had caused him to skip some tournaments in 2011, and his earlier 2012 results had not been especially good, although he did qualify for the Olympics again. In 2013, Boonsak has changed his speciality to men&#x27;s doubles and he is now teaming with Songphon Anugritayawon.

<doc id="906890" wikidata="Q686881" url="?curid=906890" title="Benthic zone">
<text>The benthic zone is the ecological region at the lowest level of a body of water such as an ocean, lake, or stream, including the sediment surface and some sub-surface layers. The name comes from the Ancient Greek word (), meaning &quot;the depths&quot;. Organisms living in this zone are called benthos and include microorganisms (e.g., bacteria and fungi) as well as larger invertebrates, such as crustaceans and polychaetes.

Organisms here, known as bottom dwellers, generally live in close relationship with the substrate and many are permanently attached to the bottom. The benthic boundary layer, which includes the bottom layer of water and the uppermost layer of sediment directly influenced by the overlying water, is an integral part of the benthic zone, as it greatly influences the biological activity that takes place there. Examples of contact soil layers include sand bottoms, rocky outcrops, coral, and bay mud.

==Description==

===Oceans===
The benthic region of the ocean begins at the shore line (intertidal or littoral zone) and extends downward along the surface of the continental shelf out to sea. Thus, the region incorporates a great variety of physical conditions differing in: depth, light penetration and pressure. Depending on the water-body, the benthic zone may include areas that are only a few inches below the surface.

The continental shelf is a gently sloping benthic region that extends away from the land mass. At the continental shelf edge, usually about deep, the gradient greatly increases and is known as the continental slope. The continental slope drops down to the deep sea floor. The deep-sea floor is called the abyssal plain and is usually about deep. The ocean floor is not all flat but has submarine ridges and deep ocean trenches known as the hadal zone. For comparison, the pelagic zone is the descriptive term for the ecological region above the benthos, including the water column up to the surface. At the other end of the spectrum, benthos of the deep ocean includes the bottom levels of the oceanic abyssal zone.

For information on animals that live in the deeper areas of the oceans see aphotic zone. Generally, these include life forms that tolerate cool temperatures and low oxygen levels, but this depends on the depth of the water.

===Lakes===
As with oceans, the &quot;benthic zone&quot; is the floor of the lake, composed of accumulated sunken organic matter. The &quot;littoral zone&quot; is the zone bordering the shore; light penetrates easily and aquatic plants thrive. The &quot;pelagic zone&quot; represents the broad mass of water, down as far as the depth to which no light penetrates.

==Organisms==

Benthos are the organisms that live in the benthic zone, and are different from those elsewhere in the water column; even within the benthic zone variations in such factors as light penetration, temperature and salinity give rise to distinct differences, delineated vertically, in the groups of organisms supported. Many organisms adapted to deep-water pressure cannot survive in the upper parts of the water column: the pressure difference can be very significant (approximately one atmosphere for each 10 meters of water depth). Many have adapted to live on the substrate (bottom). In their habitats they can be considered as dominant creatures, but they are often a source of prey for Carcharhinidae such as the lemon shark.

Because light does not penetrate very deep into ocean-water, the energy source for the benthic ecosystem is often marine snow. Marine snow is organic matter from higher up in the water column that drifts down to the depths. This dead and decaying matter sustains the benthic food chain; most organisms in the benthic zone are scavengers or detritivores. Some microorganisms use chemosynthesis to produce biomass.

Benthic organisms can be divided into two categories based on whether they make their home on the ocean floor or a few centimeters into the ocean floor. Those living on the surface of the ocean floor are known as epifauna. Those who live burrowed into the ocean floor are known as infauna. Extremophiles, including piezophiles, which thrive in high pressures, may also live there. An example of benthos organism is Chorismus antarcticus.

==Nutrient flux==
Sources of food for benthic communities can derive from the water column above these habitats in the form of aggregations of detritus, inorganic matter, and living organisms. These aggregations are commonly referred to as marine snow, and are important for the deposition of organic matter, and bacterial communities. The amount of material sinking to the ocean floor can average 307,000 aggregates per m2 per day. This amount will vary on the depth of the benthos, and the degree of benthic-pelagic coupling. The benthos in a shallow region will have more available food than the benthos in the deep sea. Because of their reliance on it, microbes may become spatially dependent on detritus in the benthic zone. The microbes found in the benthic zone, specifically dinoflagellates and foraminifera, colonize quite rapidly on detritus matter while forming a symbiotic relationship with each other. In the deep sea, which covers 90–95% of the ocean floor, 90% of the total biomass is made up of prokaryotes. To release all the nutrients locked inside these microbes to the environment, viruses are important in making it available to other organisms.

==Habitats==
Modern seafloor mapping technologies have revealed linkages between seafloor geomorphology and benthic habitats, in which suites of benthic communities are associated with specific geomorphic settings. Examples include cold-water coral communities associated with seamounts and submarine canyons, kelp forests associated with inner shelf rocky reefs and rockfish associated with rocky escarpments on continental slopes. In oceanic environments, benthic habitats can also be zoned by depth. From the shallowest to the deepest are: the epipelagic (less than 200 meters), the mesopelagic (200–1,000 meters), the bathyal (1,000–4,000 meters), the abyssal (4,000–6,000 meters) and the deepest, the hadal (below 6,000 meters).

The lower zones are in deep, pressurized areas of the ocean. Human impacts have occurred at all ocean depths, but are most significant on shallow continental shelf and slope habitats. Many benthic organisms have retained their historic evolutionary characteristics. Some organisms are significantly larger than their relatives living in shallower zones, largely because of higher oxygen concentration in deep water.

It is not easy to map or observe these organisms and their habitats, and most modern observations are made using remotely operated underwater vehicles (ROVs), and rarely submarines.

==Ecological research==
Benthic macroinvertebrates have many important ecological functions, such as regulating the flow of materials and energy in river ecosystems through their food web linkages. Because of this correlation between flow of energy and nutrients, benthic macroinvertebrates have the ability to influence food resources on fish and other organisms in aquatic ecosystems. For example, the addition of a moderate amount of nutrients to a river over the course of several years resulted in increases in invertebrate richness, abundance, and biomass. These in turn resulted in increased food resources for native species of fish with insignificant alteration of the macroinvertebrate community structure and trophic pathways. The presence of macroinvertebrates such as Amphipoda also affect the dominance of certain types of algae in Benthic ecosystems as well. In addition, because benthic zones are influenced by the flow of dead organic material, there have been studies conducted on the relationship between stream and river water flows and the resulting effects on the benthic zone. Low flow events show a restriction in nutrient transport from benthic substrates to food webs, and caused a decrease in benthic macroinvertebrate biomass, which lead to the disappearance of food sources into the substrate.

Because the benthic system regulates energy in aquatic ecosystems, studies have been made of the mechanisms of the benthic zone in order to better understand the ecosystem. Benthic diatoms have been used by the European Union&#x27;s Water Framework Directive (WFD) to establish ecological quality ratios that determined the ecological status of lakes in the UK. Beginning research is being made on benthic assemblages to see if they can be used as indicators of healthy aquatic ecosystems. Benthic assemblages in urbanized coastal regions are not functionally equivalent to benthic assemblages in untouched regions.

Ecologists are attempting to understand the relationship between heterogeneity and maintaining biodiversity in aquatic ecosystems. Benthic algae has been used as an inherently good subject for studying short term changes and community responses to heterogeneous conditions in streams. Understanding the potential mechanisms involving benthic periphyton and the effects on heterogeneity within a stream may provide a better understanding of the structure and function of stream ecosystems. Periphyton populations suffer from high natural spatial variability while difficult accessibility simultaneously limits the practicable number of samples that can be taken. Targeting periphyton locations which are known to provide reliable samples especially hard surfaces is recommended in the European Union benthic monitoring program (by Kelly 1998 for the United Kingdom then in the EU and for the EU as a whole by CEN 2003 and CEN 2004) and in some United States programs (by Moulton et al. 2002). Benthic gross primary production (GPP) may be important in maintaining biodiversity hotspots in littoral zones in large lake ecosystems. However, the relative contributions of benthic habitats within specific ecosystems are poorly explored and more research is planned.

<text>Captain James K. Dressel (October 14, 1943 – March 24, 1992) was an Air Force pilot, and a Michigan politician in the 1970s and early 1980s. Although he was a conservative Republican, in 1983 he co-sponsored the state&#x27;s first bill to protect gay and lesbian people from discrimination in employment and housing. He was profiled in Randy Shilts&#x27; book &quot;Conduct Unbecoming&quot; in the chapter &quot;Heroes&quot;.

==Biography==
Dressel was born in Holland, Michigan, to German and Dutch parents, and raised in the United Methodist Church. He graduated from Hope College in 1967, then enlisted in the air force. Beginning in 1970, he served a tour of duty in the Vietnam War, piloting fighter jets and bombing enemy supply runs from a base in Thailand, receiving the Distinguished Flying Cross and other decorations.

Following his military service, he became a member of the Air National Guard and began a career in politics as a Republican. He was elected to the Ottawa County Commission, and served as county treasurer before being elected to the Michigan House of Representatives in 1978, serving the 95th District. Although he was a conservative Goldwater Republican, he cooperated with Democratic legislators on programs to aid the city of Detroit and other practical issues facing the state.

He surprised his constituents in October 1983 by co-sponsoring House Bill 5000, an amendment to the state&#x27;s Elliott-Larsen Civil Rights Act to prohibit discrimination based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot; in employment and housing. A 40-year-old bachelor, he was subsequently speculated to be gay, but refused at the time to confirm or deny it, citing the principle he was trying to demonstrate: that it shouldn&#x27;t matter. He was soundly defeated in the Republican primary for re-election in 1984, by a candidate he had easily out-polled in the previous primary.

He was later somewhat more open about his homosexuality, and became active in advocating civil rights protection for gay and lesbian people, including a stint leading the Michigan Organization for Human Rights. He died of AIDS-related pneumonia in 1992, at the age of 48. The Michigan Legislature passed a resolution honoring him upon his death.

<text>Wong Choong Hann (; born 17 February 1977) is a Malaysian former badminton player. He was the first Malaysian to win a medal in the men&#x27;s singles event at the BWF World Championships. He resigned as the coaching director for the Malaysia national badminton team in June 2023.

== Career ==
Wong Choong Hann&#x27;s career began with the 1996 Malaysia Open. The first tournament he won was the 1997 Dutch Open. He represented Malaysia in 2002, where Malaysia emerged runners-up to Indonesia in the Thomas Cup championships.

In 2003, Wong reached the World Championships finals. In a thrilling three-set match between the veterans (both he and his opponent were above 24 years old then), he eventually lost out to the champion from China, Xia Xuanze.

Wong played badminton at the 2004 Summer Olympics in men&#x27;s singles, defeating Przemysław Wacha of Poland in the first round. In the round of 16, he was defeated by Taufik Hidayat of Indonesia.

The low point of his career occurred during the 2006 Thomas Cup when he injured himself by snapping an achilles tendon while playing in a quarter final match against South Korea, and was required to rest for almost 6 months. He made a comeback to the sport in the Asian Games later in 2006 but was clearly off form.

In the 2008 Summer Olympics he defeated reigning Olympic champion Taufik Hidayat but once again failed to advance past the round of 16, losing to Hsieh Yu-hsing of Chinese Taipei.

He has set up a company &quot;Pioneer Sdn Bhd&quot; with former shuttlers Lee Wan Wah, Chan Chong Ming, and Chew Choon Eng to conduct badminton programmes and hopefully produce world-class shuttlers for Malaysia.

In May 2010, Wong was called back to play for the Malaysian Thomas Cup squad.

In 2011 he played his last world championship, where he lost to Boonsak Ponsana in the second round.

== Personal life ==
Wong Choong Hann married Leaw Pik Sim on 11 June 2005. They have a daughter, named Kyra Wong Xinyue, and a son, named Kayden Wong Zixuan. He currently resides in Sri Petaling, Kuala Lumpur. In September 2012, he co-founded LavieFlo International—the first preserved flower retailer in Malaysia.

<text>Edward R. Coode, MBE (born 19 June 1975) is a British rower, twice World Champion and Olympic Gold medalist.

==Early life==
Born in Cornwall in 1975, Coode boarded at Papplewick School and Eton College. He studied marine biology at University of Newcastle upon Tyne and Keble College, Oxford, and rowed in the Oxford crew at the 1998 Boat Race.

==Career==
Coode won his first World Championship in 1999, as a substitute in the British men&#x27;s coxless four, rowing with Steve Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent and James Cracknell. When Tim Foster returned to the four, Coode was put into the coxless pair with Greg Searle. They finished fourth at the 2000 Sydney Olympics having led for most of the race and being overtaken by three crews in the last 600 m, finishing 12/100th of a second (about 2 feet) out of third place.

In 2001, he won a second World Championship in the men&#x27;s coxless four with Steve Williams, Rick Dunn and Toby Garbett. In 2002, he missed the World Championships due to injury, Josh West taking his place in the coxless four, and was in the men&#x27;s eight in 2003 that won the bronze at that year&#x27;s world championships.

With the injury to Alex Partridge, Coode was moved from the eight to the coxless four for the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, rowing with Pinsent, Cracknell and Williams. In a close race with World champions Canada, they won gold.

==Retirement==
In October 2004, Coode announced he was retiring from rowing – taking a year out to travel in South America and then study for a law degree at University of the West of England in Bristol. Following two years at university he spent two years as a trainee solicitor at Bristol firm Burges Salmon, before qualifying and joining family law firm Coodes Solicitors, which has branches across Cornwall.

==Personal life==
Coode was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2005 New Year Honours for services to sport.

On 17 September 2005 Coode married Clare Smales in the St Mary&#x27;s and St Julian&#x27;s Church, Maker, Cornwall. They have four children.

<text>Walter Henri Dyett (also known as Captain Walter Henri Dyett; January 11, 1901 – November 17, 1969) was an American violinist and music educator in the Chicago Public Schools system. He served as music director and assistant music director at Chicago&#x27;s predominantly African-American high schools; Wendell Phillips High School and DuSable High School.

== Career ==
After studying pre-medical courses at University of California, Berkeley, Dyett returned to his home town of Chicago, where he worked in vaudeville orchestras and directed an Army band, after which he was known as Captain Dyett.

He also, once again, came runner-up at the All England Open as he was defeated by Chinese player, Xia Xuanze.

=== 2000 Sydney Olympics ===
Hidayat participated in the men&#x27;s singles competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney. In his first Olympics, he was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Ji Xinpeng of China.

=== 2004 Athens Olympics ===
Hidayat won the men&#x27;s singles gold medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics defeating Hidetaka Yamada of Japan and Wong Choong Hann of Malaysia in the first two rounds.

Hidayat won the men&#x27;s singles gold medal at the Asian Games in 2002 Busan and 2006 Doha. He also won the 2007 Asian Championship, and two men&#x27;s singles gold medals at the SEA Games in 1999 Bandar Seri Begawan and 2007 Nakhon Ratchasima.

=== 2012 London Olympics ===
For the fourth time, Hidayat participated in the Summer Olympics. Hidayat competed at the 2012 Summer Olympics but he was eliminated in the round of 16 by Lin Dan of China.

Popular media has at times focused on the perceived rivalry between Hidayat and Chinese player Lin Dan, referring to the two as &quot;arch rivals&quot;. This was the last time that Hidayat participated in the Summer Olympics.

== Personal life ==
He married the daughter of Agum Gumelar, Ami Gumelar, on 4 February 2006. They had a daughter in early August 2007, named Natarina Alika Hidayat. She was born shortly before he had to leave for the World Championships.

In December 2012, Hidayat officially opened a badminton training center named the Taufik Hidayat Arena (THA), located at Ciracas, East Jakarta. This &quot;house of badminton&quot; is both named and owned by Taufik.

== Player attributes ==
Hidayat&#x27;s shot-making strengths were his backhand (as he is perhaps most famous for his backhand smash, revered for its unusually high generation of power), forehand jump smash, drop shot (reverse slice in particular), smooth footwork and deceiving net play. Hidayat&#x27;s forehand jump smash in the 2006 World Championships was once the fastest smash recorded in singles competition; he recorded in a match against Ng Wei. This power on both his forehand and backhand, combined with his tenacity at the net and scope for deceptive shots, provided him with an extremely diverse weaponry on court, making him one of the most difficult players to face on the open circuit. Criticisms were aimed at his occasional lack of fitness, impatience with loud crowds, and his propensity to return a net shot with another net shot even when his opponent was dangerously close to the net.

== Participation in the Indonesian team ==
* 6 times at Sudirman Cup (1999, 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2011)
* 7 times at Thomas Cup (2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012)

<text>Dworshak National Fish Hatchery is a mitigation hatchery located on the Clearwater River within the Nez Perce Reservation near Ahsahka, in north-central Idaho, United States. It was constructed in 1969 by the Army Corps of Engineers, and is co-managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Nez Perce Tribe. The hatchery is one of the largest combination producers of anadromous (migratory) fish in the world. These fish make a 1000-mile round trip to the ocean and back to spawn in the Clearwater River. The Dworshak Dam blocks access to the historical spawning areas on the North Fork-Clearwater River for the steelhead, and it is too high for a fish ladder.

Steelhead, chinook and coho salmon are spawned and reared at the facility. The hatchery attempts to mitigate or make up for some of the lost spawning area by collecting mature adult fish, fertilizing their eggs, and raising them for 1–1½ years, until they are large enough to begin their 500-mile journey to the Pacific Ocean. The young fish must survive a variety of hazards in the long journey, including swimming past eight dams on the Snake and Columbia Rivers. During the summer months the dams increase their water releases to aid fish migration downstream.

The Dworshak hatchery is unique because of its ability to control the water temperature in the steelhead rearing ponds. By keeping the temperature at 54 degrees Fahrenheit, the juvenile steelheads are able to be released after one year at a length of 8 inches. In cold water, it would take an additional year to grow those same 8 inches. The hatchery accomplishes this through the recirculation of up to 90 percent of its water.

The hatchery is part of Dworshak Fisheries Complex, which also includes Kooskia National Fish Hatchery, the Idaho Fish Health Center, and the Idaho Fisheries Resource Office.

Dworshak National Fish Hatchery is open to visitors during daylight hours. The facility has a self-guided tour route and offers pre-arranged guided tours. The hatchery is located approximately three miles west of Orofino, ID on Highway 7.

The best fish viewing seasons are: February - April for adult steelhead, June - August for adult chinook, and October - December for coho and steelhead.

Dworshak Dam and Hatchery were named after Henry Dworshak, a Republican Senator from Idaho during 1946–1962.

<doc id="906920" wikidata="Q8021522" url="?curid=906920" title="Willie Garvin">
<text>Willie Garvin is a character in the long-running British comic strip series &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;, as well as a series of novels based upon the strip. The character was created by Peter O&#x27;Donnell in 1963 and, alongside Modesty Blaise, made his first appearance in the story &quot;La Machine&quot;, appearing for the first time in strip no. 21. Willie Garvin also appears in every volume of the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; book series.

== Character background ==
Willie Garvin appears throughout the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; series as Modesty&#x27;s confidant and right-hand man. His background is never presented in an ordered, chronological context, but rather in bits and pieces over the course of the comic strip, which ran from 1963 to 2002, and the literary series, which shared a more-or-less common continuity and ran from 1965 to 1996.

What is known can be pieced together from the many tidbits revealed by O&#x27;Donnell over the years. Willie Garvin is British and has a rather shady background. He was born in Whitechapel to an unwed mother who died young, leaving him in the care of his &quot;auntie&quot;—an aged and alcoholic prostitute—who &quot;taught him how to duck.&quot; He was then put in an orphanage which he ran away from after crossing a bully known as Dicer and losing his virginity to a girl nicknamed &quot;Annie the Bang&quot;. He served in the French Foreign Legion, including the gruesome Battle of Dien Bien Phu, and later lived in Thailand, where he learned his skills as a Thai boxer.

It is during his time as a Thai boxer in Saigon (or Bangkok, O&#x27;Donnell changed the story at some point) that he first meets Modesty Blaise, who despite being only twenty, runs a powerful (but moralistic) criminal organisation called The Network. Modesty sees Willie in one of his fights, and sees him getting arrested afterwards (&quot;for the brawl he&#x27;d been involved in the night before&quot;). Modesty buys him out of jail and tells him that she believes he is capable of being more of a man than he currently is. She tests him by having him collect money owed by a person in Hong Kong. This simple order gets so complicated that Willie actually has to break the man out of a prison in mainland China just to complete the mission. Modesty is astonished and impressed by Willie&#x27;s ingenuity and so invites him to join The Network. Willie accepts and spends six months training with Modesty to the point where they trust each other as much as they trust themselves. Willie becomes Modesty&#x27;s most trusted man in The Network, and stays on for six years until Modesty shuts the organisation down. Afterwards, the two remain close friends—Willie opening a pub 25 miles (40 km.) from London called The Treadmill—and when Sir Gerald Tarrant offers Modesty a chance to put her skills to work on behalf of British Intelligence, she easily recruits Willie to fight by her side.

== Character traits ==

Willie has a well-developed, if slightly dark, sense of humour, and often jokes about his and Modesty&#x27;s lifestyles. He is given to quoting psalms, as he was once imprisoned for a year in Calcutta with only a psalter to read. Very sociable, he has a number of female acquaintances from all social levels (as Modesty humorously describes them, &quot;from &quot;premier cru&quot; to honest &quot;vin de pays&quot;&quot;), and is often reminded of anecdotes of them in the most unusual situations (such as when swimming in shark-infested waters or when hauling heavy objects up slopes). 

The one exception to his romantic conquests is Modesty Blaise herself; feeling that he owes her a debt greater than anything physical can offer, he refuses to consider her in a romantic light and Modesty, in return, reciprocates by treating Willie as her one trusted friend. Willie rarely refers to Modesty Blaise by her name; his preferred nickname for her is &quot;Princess&quot;. On occasion, he literally provides a shoulder for her to cry on (one of Modesty&#x27;s character traits is that she occasionally weeps following the conclusion of a particularly nasty mission). The novel &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Handle&quot; (which begins with an extensive prologue detailing his first mission for Blaise and The Network) indicates that, despite acknowledging her attractiveness, Garvin from the start never thought of Blaise in a sexual way. Frequently in the novels and comic strip, Garvin and Blaise often need to explain to colleagues why they are not a romantic couple. In media adaptations, the 1966 film version of &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; departs from this by having Blaise and Garvin not only enter into a romance, but become engaged in the movie&#x27;s finale.

Willie Garvin is a tall and extremely strong man, though not heavily muscle-bound. He has a scar on his right hand made by a man named Suleiman, who was later killed by Modesty because he was torturing Willie. Like Modesty, he is a polymath of the first order: adept in safe-cracking and lock-picking, micro-electronics, expert at military tactics and a student of the criminal arts. He speaks several languages, including German, Spanish, Arabic and French; his English has a heavy cockney tone to it, though he is able to turn it on and off like a switch. Willie is a master knife thrower and can throw almost any object with extreme precision. He makes his own knives and is deadly with them at ranges up to 90 feet. He does not like pistols (because he thinks that guns give people too much confidence), and he and Modesty have also stated that he is a poor shot, but he has shown himself to be capable on the rare occasions that he uses such weapons. As an ex-soldier, he is skilled with rifles and submachine guns, and has on occasion also used a sniper rifle.

Willie, like Modesty, has a strong sense of right and wrong that is governed more by his morals than by the law. Although he avoids using deadly force whenever possible, usually taking his cue from Modesty as to whether to fight &quot;for keeps&quot; (the duo&#x27;s euphemism for killing), he will not hesitate to kill to protect Modesty (see, for example, the conclusion to the 1975 comic strip &quot;Cry Wolf&quot;).

Willie and Modesty both smoke Gauloises (&quot;Sabre-tooth&quot;).

==I Had a Date with Lady Janet==
With one exception, all of the literary adventures of Modesty Blaise are told in the standard third person. The sole exception to this is the short story &quot;I Had a Date with Lady Janet&quot;, which first appeared in the collection &quot;Pieces of Modesty&quot;. That story is told in first person from Willie Garvin&#x27;s point of view. An audio-book of this story was narrated by John Thaw.

==Fate==
Although Willie Garvin continued to appear in the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; comic strip until O&#x27;Donnell retired in 2002 (actually he retired in 2001, but a book-length strip based upon one of his short stories subsequently appeared in a Scandinavian publication the next year), chronologically his final appearance comes in the closing story of the 1996 short story collection &quot;Cobra Trap&quot;. (This last story is also called &quot;Cobra Trap,&quot; like the book.)

The story takes place a number of years into the future, with Modesty in her early fifties and Willie approximately 60 years of age. During a caper to protect a trainload of innocent people, including some children, from a group of rebels, Modesty suddenly kisses Willie romantically (for the first and only time) and reveals to him that she is dying of a brain tumor. She orders Willie to leave with the train, allowing her to die alone in the battle against the rebels. Before he can react, Modesty is shot dead, and moments later, in a mortar attack, Willie&#x27;s ankle is broken. Willie buries Modesty and then moves off slowly, hoping to escape through the jungle, but then Willie is also shot dead. As the story ends, O&#x27;Donnell describes Willie meeting Modesty in an ethereal environment, some kind of afterlife.

==Portrayals==

O&#x27;Donnell has said that he had Michael Caine in mind when he created Willie Garvin and would have liked to see him portray him, but this never happened.

Willie Garvin has been portrayed on film on a couple of occasions.

Terence Stamp portrayed Willie Garvin in the 1966 film version of &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;, a year after the publication of the first novel. In this film, Willie is portrayed as slightly psychotic when he first appears on screen. Later, the writers of the film choose to break O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s anti-romance taboo and have Willie and Modesty fall in love and even talk about getting married.

Willie Garvin next appeared on screen in the 1982 television pilot &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; with Ann Turkel as the title character, which was not made into a television series. In this version, Willie is portrayed by Lewis Van Bergen.

Also in the early 1980s, John Thaw recorded an audio adaptation of &quot;I Had a Date with Lady Janet&quot; which he performed in character as Willie Garvin.

One of the &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; novels, &quot;Last Day in Limbo&quot;, was adapted as a BBC World Service radio drama in 1978 with James Bolam as Willie.

Carl Prekopp played Willie in a 2012 BBC Radio 4 adaptation of &quot;A Taste for Death&quot;. In the 2014 BBC Radio 4 adaptation of &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot;, he was played by Neil Maskell.

The 2003 film &quot;My Name Is Modesty&quot; was produced as a prequel to the comic strip and novels; as such it is the only &quot;Modesty Blaise&quot; adventure in which Willie Garvin does not appear.
